[0:00] god bless you folks being with us
[0:01] tonight good thing you come to fill some
[0:03] seats because we have so many going in
[0:05] look at this good to have you
[0:08] praise the lord amen it only takes two
[0:10] or three
[0:12] that's what i hear from the word only
[0:14] takes two or three so we got enough that
[0:16] the lord can show up
[0:17] we got the right numbers amen praise the
[0:20] lord good to have you all tonight praise
[0:22] the lord we're
[0:23] in a good place in the right place at
[0:25] the right time i believe that
[0:26] amen i wanted to talk a little bit
[0:29] tonight
[0:30] about anger and also just the victory
[0:34] that goes for the christian and
[0:36] we were on that a little bit on sunday
[0:37] and talk about jonah and
[0:39] we appreciate some of the response that
[0:42] we get back
[0:43] and uh looking at the life of jonah but
[0:46] tonight i just wanted to just take take
[0:48] anger in the book of ephesians and also
[0:50] just a
[0:51] few things about it that can teach us
[0:52] and some other some of this is
[0:54] revisiting
[0:55] um a few foundational things that we
[0:58] spoke here before
[0:59] we'll just spring off of that i think it
[1:01] was four or five years ago i dealt with
[1:02] the subject
[1:03] at length and uh so i just wanted to get
[1:06] back into it a little bit tonight and
[1:07] then we'll have
[1:08] just a few other things examples in the
[1:10] scriptures i believe
[1:12] that will be a blessing to us and
[1:13] helpful with us
[1:15] and understanding these things and if
[1:17] you're not struggling in this area
[1:19] uh that you've got maybe years ago
[1:21] you've got your anger
[1:22] resolved and under control and the holy
[1:24] spirit's guiding you in such a powerful
[1:26] way
[1:26] i say praise the lord because that's the
[1:28] goal for all of us is to bring
[1:30] our this emotion that's so much a part
[1:32] of us under the lord's
[1:34] control and under his his holy spirit
[1:37] guidance and leadership
[1:39] and how many knows a lot of things in
[1:40] life to make us angry
[1:43] i mean there's many people that can make
[1:44] us angry
[1:46] amen even our own children sometimes can
[1:48] make us angry
[1:49] and there's a lot of potential for anger
[1:52] in this in the world we live in
[1:54] uh you can if you if you stay on the
[1:56] news about 15 minutes it has the
[1:58] potential to make you
[1:59] pretty angry if you have any discernment
[2:01] at all about the word of god and the
[2:03] kingdom of god and you see where we're
[2:05] going
[2:06] almost on a daily basis my personal
[2:08] choices and my
[2:09] personal rights are being taken away
[2:12] from me on a daily basis
[2:15] uh it's happening on a daily basis and
[2:17] we'll no longer have it's interesting
[2:18] about
[2:19] some parties in politics that have
[2:21] pushed to us the woman's choice for
[2:23] years the woman's choice and her right
[2:25] to her own body and then turn around and
[2:27] and i don't have a right
[2:28] or a choice of a thing in my own body
[2:32] what to do what to
[2:32] not to do so that's kind of like a
[2:35] contradiction but that's the world we
[2:37] live in and if you look at the news very
[2:38] long you're going to be upset
[2:40] but i got something for you to look at
[2:41] tonight the word of god i believe that
[2:42] can help us
[2:44] and to just live in a different way
[2:47] uh as we look at the scripture here just
[2:49] in some teaching we see that
[2:51] paul deals with the subject of anger in
[2:54] our inheritance chapter of ephesians and
[2:56] he says to be a be ye angry and sin not
[2:59] let not the sun don't go down upon your
[3:01] wrath neither give place to the devil
[3:04] so i'm going to isolate the two
[3:05] scriptures just a little bit
[3:07] and look at that as though there's two
[3:09] two real dangers
[3:11] that we watch for of where our anger can
[3:14] take us or our anger can go the wrong
[3:16] way
[3:17] and anger can take us to wrong places
[3:20] the release of anger in the wrong way
[3:23] can make things very unchrist-like can
[3:25] grieve the spirit can grieve other
[3:26] people
[3:27] can grieve our spirit and actually can
[3:29] be the dismantling of
[3:31] families and churches and everything
[3:33] it's kind of like a fire it just kind of
[3:35] begins to burn up everything
[3:37] uncontrolled anger unresolved anger can
[3:39] begin to destroy
[3:41] good things that you have so we have to
[3:43] look at and realize there's a couple
[3:44] dangers here
[3:45] because anger has a great danger matter
[3:47] of fact anger is one letter
[3:49] short of the word danger
[3:54] so you always have the potential anger
[3:58] has the potential to do a couple
[4:00] damaging things to
[4:02] to believers if they're not careful and
[4:04] because of that we must
[4:06] face it and we must expose it and we
[4:08] must bring it to the lord and we must
[4:10] resolve it
[4:11] and we must bring it to his throne and
[4:13] say lord whatever it is that has begun
[4:15] to eat at me or make me upset in my
[4:18] emotions
[4:18] i want to deal with that and i think
[4:20] that we should resolve it
[4:22] as quickly as we can and what i want to
[4:24] present to you tonight in a teaching is
[4:26] that
[4:27] the reason that we want to resolve it as
[4:29] quickly as we can because anger is the
[4:31] type of thing that has a potential
[4:32] that grows it will grow inside of you it
[4:36] will grow
[4:36] like a cancer grows inside of you anger
[4:39] can grow
[4:40] like a cancer anger can grow in your
[4:43] spirit and
[4:44] take over your spirit sometimes affect
[4:47] you physically
[4:48] and so it's not the type of thing just
[4:50] to leave unresolved it's the type of
[4:52] thing to bring to the cross and say lord
[4:54] help me to release this help me as i as
[4:57] we sang the song tonight
[4:59] to leave it there help me to release it
[5:01] and leave it there because if i hold on
[5:03] to it
[5:03] it has the potential to grow in me like
[5:06] a cancer
[5:08] and when it begins to grow as a cancer
[5:10] then it has a lot of other things that
[5:11] go to it and there's a couple things
[5:13] that he says here
[5:14] he says some instruction don't let
[5:17] another day
[5:18] uh go on to carry on with it in other
[5:20] words before the sun goes down in other
[5:22] words to resolve it don't let the sun go
[5:25] down upon your wrath and upon your anger
[5:27] so that's one thing is that there's a as
[5:30] a danger that we let it go on to another
[5:32] day
[5:33] don't let it go on to another day bring
[5:35] it to the lord
[5:36] do everything you can to just release
[5:38] things even at the end of the day
[5:40] sometimes we don't do that but the bible
[5:43] is instructing
[5:44] us is that this is something that has to
[5:46] be resolved and brought to the lord
[5:48] and if you can do it before the sun goes
[5:50] down the better so that's number one
[5:52] don't let another day carry on with it
[5:54] and the second thing
[5:55] don't give the devil an open place to
[5:58] work and that's what i want to title
[5:59] this tonight
[6:00] anger can give the devil a place
[6:05] and that's why it's so dangerous to us
[6:08] spiritually because anger has the
[6:11] potential
[6:12] to give satan ground to give satan
[6:15] a place to give him somewhere that he
[6:18] can begin to work and
[6:20] as christians in our inheritance we're
[6:22] not up to giving the devil
[6:24] any of our ground this is an inheritance
[6:26] can you say man this is ours
[6:28] our souls belong to him our spirit
[6:31] belongs to him
[6:32] and the possession of inco that we have
[6:34] in jesus christ
[6:35] it belongs to us it doesn't belong to
[6:37] the devil and so when the devil comes
[6:39] and squats on something and jumps in and
[6:41] takes a place
[6:42] in our land then we quickly rise up and
[6:44] say no that's not your land that's my
[6:47] land amen
[6:48] and so what a powerful statement don't
[6:51] give a place to the devil why would he
[6:53] say that in the book of ephesians
[6:55] because the book of ephesians is our
[6:57] inheritance chapter
[6:58] it's our joshua chapter the book of
[7:01] ephesians is our inheritance as a
[7:03] christian
[7:03] and so our inheritance belongs to us
[7:06] neither give place
[7:07] to the devil no don't give them any room
[7:10] at all
[7:10] don't give them any place at all there's
[7:12] not one corner
[7:13] of our land that we're going to give up
[7:15] to the enemy it doesn't belong to him it
[7:18] belongs to us
[7:19] it's interesting that he brings our land
[7:21] in not giving a place of our land to the
[7:23] devil
[7:24] in the subject of anger
[7:28] see i always love to look at that
[7:30] because in the message many times we get
[7:32] really
[7:32] highfalutin and it's the it's all the
[7:34] mysteries and everything and then paul
[7:36] here's talking about your anger
[7:37] and he says you better resolve your
[7:38] anger and the next scripture he says
[7:40] don't give a place to the devil
[7:41] it's related to our inheritance because
[7:43] every day the enemy
[7:45] challenges us with becoming angry and
[7:47] not resolving our anger
[7:49] and i'm telling you if you don't bring
[7:51] it to the lord and relieve it
[7:52] the devil has a place to get in
[7:56] the devil is out to take some of your
[7:58] property
[8:00] the devil's out to take some of your
[8:01] land that belongs to you can you say
[8:03] amen
[8:04] and so now we we get we look at a
[8:06] victory in this for a believer
[8:08] these are two great victories for a
[8:10] believer i believe is to resolve it
[8:12] before the day is over and that also
[8:14] that nothing
[8:15] bad should be allowed to continue very
[8:18] long
[8:19] in our spirit and i'll just go quickly
[8:21] through this because
[8:22] i've taught on these things before i'm
[8:24] just picking it up again it bears
[8:25] repeating especially after
[8:27] uh quite a few years so these are just
[8:30] repeating some things but
[8:31] nothing should get in our let me just
[8:33] say it this way
[8:35] nothing should be allowed to get lodged
[8:38] in your spirit or your motion so deeply
[8:42] nothing should be allowed to get lodged
[8:44] there very deeply for too long
[8:46] nothing of the enemy nothing that
[8:48] bothers you nothing that makes you angry
[8:50] should be allowed to get too lodged in
[8:52] your spirit now the reality
[8:54] of it is you're going to get angry it's
[8:55] an emotion the reality of is there's
[8:57] going to be things that make you angry
[8:59] the
[8:59] reality is is that you're not a sinner
[9:02] because you get angry that would be
[9:03] denying you as a human being
[9:06] he's not talking about uh not having any
[9:09] anger and if you have anger you're not a
[9:11] christian
[9:12] you don't have the holy ghost he said be
[9:14] angry
[9:16] but sin not amen right it's like when
[9:19] you talk about money it's not
[9:21] money that's wrong it's the love of
[9:22] money
[9:24] you see so you have to balance those
[9:26] things but anger
[9:27] it's a it's it's a part of our emotions
[9:29] sometimes matter of fact you can be
[9:30] angry at the
[9:31] at the right things you can have the
[9:33] anger of god towards the wrong things
[9:35] and keep the devil at bay because you
[9:36] get angry at sin you get angry at things
[9:38] in your life
[9:39] that you want to see out uh you you got
[9:42] to keep if you want something
[9:43] done you have to keep hating it you have
[9:45] to keep hating something
[9:47] and wanting deliverance over it can you
[9:48] say amen uh
[9:50] i've mentioned before some of the people
[9:52] that go through uh
[9:53] financial counseling and want to dig out
[9:55] of their hole the counselor has asked
[9:57] the questions over and over and every
[9:58] session
[9:59] how mad are you at this debt how upset
[10:01] are you how mad are you
[10:02] because if you don't say stay mad at it
[10:05] you won't resolve it you'll loosen up
[10:06] about it
[10:07] so there's certain things to remain mad
[10:09] at to get out of your life that's wrong
[10:12] so anger is a part of us but when it
[10:14] gets lodged in our
[10:16] spirit it can't do that because anger
[10:19] must be short-lived
[10:20] and we can't continue to think about
[10:23] things that make us angry
[10:25] we can't continue to dwell on things
[10:27] that make us angry
[10:29] god help us to listen tonight we can't
[10:31] continue to
[10:33] uh dwell on things that make us angry we
[10:36] our anger must be very short-lived let
[10:39] not the sun go down on it
[10:41] we must move on we must release it we
[10:44] must quickly through prayer and
[10:46] forgiveness
[10:46] say this is over it's done i want to
[10:48] leave this alone
[10:49] i want to leave it at the cross because
[10:52] if something is lodged in our spirit
[10:54] we it may be there for too long we want
[10:57] it to be
[10:57] finished we want it to be healed we want
[11:00] it to be over with
[11:01] and then go to the next day and say lord
[11:03] what is it today that i need to overcome
[11:05] but we don't want an accumulation
[11:07] of all kinds of things building up in
[11:09] cancer to make us angry and resentful
[11:12] we want to see it resolve through
[11:13] healing because the next day sufficient
[11:16] unto today is the evil thereof
[11:18] jesus said sufficient unto the day is
[11:20] the evil thereof in other words every
[11:21] day
[11:22] we're going to go through things that
[11:23] would make us angry we don't need an
[11:25] accumulation of years of anger built up
[11:28] we need to say god forgive me and god
[11:30] help me to forgive others
[11:32] let me leave that at the cross
[11:35] blessed be his name that's what the
[11:36] scripture is encouraging us to do
[11:39] and thankfully we can do it through the
[11:40] blood of jesus christ and through his
[11:42] grace
[11:42] so we must make take more time and make
[11:46] sure things are cleaned out
[11:48] and and and cleansed out don't
[11:51] let anything that's wrong stay in your
[11:53] spirit too long
[11:55] get back up quickly and and every day
[11:58] consider a new day with the lord his
[12:01] mercies
[12:02] are new every morning and every day is a
[12:06] new day with my lord
[12:08] when he says don't let the sun go down
[12:10] upon your wrath and start every he's
[12:12] saying
[12:12] every day should be a new day with my
[12:15] lord
[12:17] could it be possible that the lord
[12:18] allows us through his blood and through
[12:20] the cross
[12:21] to end every day and take all the
[12:22] victories and all the battles
[12:24] and take all the things and mistakes
[12:26] that we've done wrong
[12:27] and take all the things that made us
[12:29] angry and at the end of the day to say
[12:31] lord
[12:32] i give it all to you i turn it over to
[12:36] you
[12:37] it's in the past it's done forgive me
[12:39] for what i've done wrong
[12:41] and lord let me forgive those who've
[12:43] done me wrong
[12:44] and lo could it be that the lord lets us
[12:47] get a fresh
[12:48] start every morning could it be that
[12:51] what david said his mercies are new
[12:54] every morning could it be that he gives
[12:58] us permission
[12:59] to forget those things which are behind
[13:01] and press toward the mark of the high
[13:03] calling in christ
[13:04] could it be the lord allows us you bring
[13:06] it up and you remember it and the devil
[13:08] brings it up but could it be he says
[13:10] you don't have to bring it up if it's
[13:11] underneath the blood yesterday was
[13:13] yesterday
[13:14] today is today and you got a fresh start
[13:16] with the lord
[13:17] hallelujah i tell your friends i'm going
[13:19] to preach tonight whether you say amen
[13:21] or not
[13:23] the lord's mercies are new every morning
[13:27] and we have the opportunity to get a
[13:28] fresh start but but that person's never
[13:31] made things right
[13:32] the situation hasn't changed yet but you
[13:35] you can say lord i have a fresh morning
[13:37] with you
[13:38] i have a fresh start with you today what
[13:41] i've done is under the blood forgive me
[13:43] lord let me never do it again
[13:45] what they do is between them and god but
[13:47] i want to go on with you
[13:49] i want to serve you with all of my heart
[13:52] today
[13:54] oh what a god we serve friends what a
[13:57] mighty god we serve
[13:59] so the reason that we do it and resolve
[14:01] it is because anger can grow like a
[14:02] cancer
[14:04] inside of us the bible speaks of
[14:06] bitterness the same way
[14:08] did you know the bitterness is the same
[14:09] way bitterness and anger are of course
[14:11] similar
[14:12] in hebrews 12 it says follow peace with
[14:15] all men
[14:16] and holiness without which no man shall
[14:18] see the lord
[14:19] follow peace with all men another place
[14:22] in the bible says follow peace with all
[14:23] men
[14:24] as much as possible because sometimes
[14:26] it's not possible
[14:28] but as much as possible live peaceable
[14:30] with all men and verse 15 says looking
[14:32] diligently
[14:34] lest any man fail of the grace of god
[14:38] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[14:42] trouble you and therefore many others be
[14:45] defiled
[14:46] so the same way anger can grow
[14:49] resentment can grow
[14:51] and he calls it something can start up
[14:53] if you fail of the grace of god
[14:55] and you're not living by his grace and
[14:57] you're not having grace for others
[14:59] hint if you're not having grace and
[15:03] living in the grace of god
[15:05] guess what can happen a root of
[15:07] bitterness now that's an interesting way
[15:09] he words it but we're talking about
[15:11] a plant we're talking about something
[15:13] that grows
[15:15] inside of you weeds
[15:18] weeds i hate weeds it's the middle of
[15:21] summer
[15:22] every day we're pulling weeds they come
[15:24] i don't know where they come from and
[15:26] they
[15:26] thrive in this heat my plants don't
[15:29] thrive in this heat
[15:31] i have to water them but when i water
[15:32] them i water the weeds and then they
[15:34] thrive in the heat
[15:35] and they're there and i'm pulling them
[15:37] constantly if i want a healthy yard if i
[15:39] want a healthy flower
[15:40] garden i'm always pulling the roots
[15:43] and you got to get it by the roots is
[15:46] anybody
[15:46] relating tonight a little bit got some
[15:49] weeds
[15:50] yeah you can't just grab the time i'm
[15:51] trying to train one of my neighbor boys
[15:53] to take care of my yard
[15:54] my rental property and i keep training
[15:56] them you know
[15:57] hopefully he's not listening tonight but
[15:59] bless his heart you know
[16:00] you can't grab the top of that weed and
[16:03] clip the top of it off it's gonna be
[16:04] there next week and grow taller
[16:07] i try to teach you get down there and
[16:08] get your fingers down in the
[16:10] dirt and you grab that thing and you
[16:12] pull it up by the roots
[16:15] the bible's speaking here of bitterness
[16:17] and anger
[16:18] a root of bitterness springing up
[16:20] because we don't live by the grace of
[16:22] god
[16:23] we must live by his grace we must have
[16:25] grace for others we must live in his
[16:27] grace
[16:28] we must accept god's forgiveness we must
[16:30] live if we make a mistake bring it under
[16:32] his blood
[16:33] we must live in the grace of god
[16:37] we don't live by works we don't live
[16:39] being critical all the time of other
[16:40] people
[16:41] we that's not living in the grace of god
[16:43] has anybody ever heard preaching like
[16:44] this before
[16:45] living in the grace of god is living in
[16:47] the grace of god
[16:48] and that means we live in god's grace
[16:51] because we can do no other
[16:52] and we have grace for others
[16:56] god let me forgive that person that's
[16:58] living in his grace
[17:00] god don't let me hold a grudge against a
[17:02] person that's living in his grace
[17:04] if you don't do that a root of
[17:06] bitterness springs up
[17:09] and roots become plants weeds plants
[17:12] become big things they grow and grow and
[17:14] grow
[17:15] the bible is talking about bitterness
[17:17] and being a root of bitterness
[17:19] springing up and notice what it does it
[17:21] troubles you
[17:22] and and makes others defiled
[17:26] that's hebrews 12 14 and 15 you want to
[17:28] read it
[17:29] it's powerful it troubles you thereby
[17:32] springing up
[17:32] trouble you and thereby many
[17:35] others be defiled so why do we need to
[17:39] resolve
[17:41] anger and bitterness why do we need to
[17:43] quickly
[17:44] get it resolved because it'll start
[17:46] affecting your spirit
[17:48] and it'll start affecting other people
[17:52] so christians just can't let it go on we
[17:54] can't let it keep growing
[17:56] we can't let a 20 year old grudge keep
[17:59] eating
[18:00] at us brother jason we can't we can't
[18:03] let these things go on and on for years
[18:06] we've got to say lord take these things
[18:08] i release these things
[18:10] i'm finished with these things i want to
[18:12] live in the victory as a christian
[18:15] and so i think that's uh proof enough to
[18:18] show us
[18:19] that it can trouble us it's a root it's
[18:22] something that grows
[18:23] anger frustration irritation
[18:26] is a part of our flesh and part of our
[18:29] life experience
[18:30] even as a christian
[18:33] we're never going to get to the place
[18:34] we're not around something that would
[18:36] make us
[18:36] angry around situations that make us
[18:38] angry but when it comes there
[18:42] it's not that you sin because it come
[18:44] that it comes
[18:45] you haven't sinned because you're
[18:46] frustrated you haven't sinned
[18:49] because you become irritated at
[18:50] something is anybody glad to hear that
[18:53] tonight amen
[18:54] i'm glad because i get irritated at
[18:56] stuff
[18:58] you haven't sinned because you become
[19:00] irritated you're a human being you have
[19:02] human emotions
[19:03] but right at that point the christian
[19:05] says now wait a minute
[19:06] give no place to the devil this is not
[19:10] going to be allowed to go
[19:11] any further and a lot of times when it
[19:13] goes further it it jumps in our mind
[19:17] we're frustrated but then then we just
[19:20] start
[19:21] bringing the whole scenario into the
[19:24] production room
[19:26] of our imagination i always say the
[19:29] imagination realm is like the
[19:31] the movie production room
[19:34] you know a lot of christians don't go to
[19:36] movies but they have tons of movies in
[19:38] their head all the time
[19:40] they direct it they produce it and they
[19:42] sit in their theater and they watch it
[19:43] all day
[19:46] never go to a movie in a message church
[19:48] at all the conventions
[19:50] but if your imagination is not under
[19:52] control the holy spirit
[19:53] you could be looking at stuff that's
[19:54] just as bad in the movie theater
[19:57] oh i'm not going to get too many amens
[19:58] on that but i'm preaching the truth
[20:00] anyhow
[20:01] your imagination is a powerful station
[20:04] to be able to
[20:05] produce all kinds of bad movies in your
[20:07] head
[20:08] you sit there in the movie theater of
[20:10] your imagination and you sit there
[20:12] some of you young people some of you
[20:14] people in the privacy of your own you
[20:16] think your privacy
[20:17] and you think nobody knows what you're
[20:18] thinking and you go through all these
[20:20] scenarios
[20:20] whether lustful or whatever it is i'm
[20:23] telling you
[20:24] that's when a christian needs to bring
[20:26] his imagination his conscience its
[20:28] affection and reasonings
[20:29] under the lord and say no i'm not
[20:31] allowed to do that
[20:33] this body belongs to god
[20:37] amen amen amen amen
[20:41] so now uh we might get irritated but we
[20:44] haven't sinned because we've done that
[20:46] the sin is when it stays inside
[20:48] and is allowed to take root and is
[20:50] allowed to grow
[20:51] and when it does then the devil takes
[20:53] your land
[20:54] he squats on some land he takes a place
[20:58] he takes a corner it might be more than
[21:00] a quarter you give up
[21:02] land when you let anger
[21:05] fester
[21:11] you give up land when you let anger
[21:13] fester
[21:15] and but when you don't
[21:19] and when you turn to the lord and when
[21:22] you say lord i want
[21:24] to release this to you cast my cares on
[21:27] you
[21:28] maybe you remind the lord of his promise
[21:32] and he says cast all your cares upon me
[21:34] you know what cares are
[21:36] worries you think the
[21:39] why did the lord say that he he gave us
[21:41] a place
[21:43] to cast our worries on him oh i don't
[21:46] want to bother the lord with all my
[21:47] words kind of like people with a pastor
[21:49] sometimes
[21:49] he's too busy i don't want to bother him
[21:51] but listen that's what i'm here for is
[21:52] to pray with you about your
[21:54] about your you want to get victory in
[21:56] your life that's what i'm here for but
[21:57] we do that with the lord
[21:59] oh he's he's to all my worries he's too
[22:01] busy for
[22:02] and yet he said cast all your cares upon
[22:05] me
[22:06] for i care for you become a
[22:09] place in prayer take your burdens to the
[22:12] lord
[22:13] and not only says pray leave them there
[22:18] lord i'm going to leave this with you i
[22:20] don't know how to resolve this
[22:22] so i'm going to leave it with you and
[22:23] let me know what you want me to do
[22:26] man that's like the ultimate
[22:30] uh psychologist
[22:33] you know no psychologist says you know
[22:35] what i'll take care of all this you
[22:37] leave it all here and i'll deal with it
[22:38] nobody says that and the lord says
[22:40] cast it on me leave it there for i
[22:43] care for you let me handle it let me
[22:45] take care of it
[22:48] ain't no lawyer that says that no
[22:51] psychologists doctors no they give you
[22:53] medicine
[22:55] deal with it with the medicine but our
[22:57] lord says
[22:58] why don't you just leave that here but
[23:01] you come to the altar
[23:02] i want you to leave that here and i'll
[23:06] get back with you i'll take care of it
[23:08] amen
[23:10] [Applause]
[23:12] amen
[23:15] praise the lord can i get an amen
[23:19] amen praise the lord my little
[23:21] granddaughter was here i'd
[23:23] if i'm hurting for amends i know she'd
[23:25] give me one right now
[23:26] amen she'd say
[23:30] little eleanor but you know what you
[23:33] knew why we say it because
[23:35] victory comes in our lives believers are
[23:38] about victory can you say amen
[23:40] and we have victory when the devil has
[23:42] no place to get in
[23:44] give no place to the devil living that
[23:47] way
[23:48] is the believer's victory now hold open
[23:50] your bibles and i'm going to read the
[23:51] same scriptures
[23:52] through ephesians 4. starting at verse
[23:55] 26
[23:56] i'm going to read it in the amplified
[23:57] version and you listen how he words it
[24:00] i'm going to read all the way through to
[24:01] the
[24:01] 32nd verse because i think it's all tied
[24:03] together
[24:05] it says be angry yet do not sin
[24:09] verse 26 do not let your anger
[24:13] cause you shame nor allow it to last
[24:16] don't let your anger last until the sun
[24:19] goes down
[24:21] and do not give the devil an opportunity
[24:25] to lead you into sin by holding a grudge
[24:29] by nurturing anger or how by harboring
[24:33] resentment or by cultivating bitterness
[24:36] there's about four sermons right there
[24:39] don't give the devil an opportunity
[24:42] to lead you into sin by number one
[24:45] holding a grudge
[24:46] that's when the devil gets ground
[24:48] nurturing anger
[24:50] harboring resentment or cultivating
[24:52] bitterness
[24:53] that is where the devil takes his ground
[24:57] your anger is one thing but now the
[24:59] devil has a place to work
[25:00] when it becomes resentment when it
[25:02] becomes this and so then he goes on to
[25:04] say in verse 29
[25:05] do not let unwholesome foul
[25:08] profane worthless vulgar words ever come
[25:11] out of your mouth
[25:12] which it's interesting sometimes that
[25:14] happens when we become angry
[25:17] it's what comes out of our mouth
[25:19] sometimes that hurts other people
[25:22] offends the holy spirit amen
[25:27] see you thought you were coming to get a
[25:29] nice flowery sermon tonight on wednesday
[25:31] night
[25:32] and i'm i'm right down where we all are
[25:35] where the rubber meets the road
[25:38] if he's if he's saying don't let
[25:40] unwholesome words come out of your mouth
[25:41] and he's tying it to anger
[25:42] that means our anger can let some pretty
[25:44] unwholesome words come out of our mouth
[25:48] words come out and they spill out don't
[25:50] let that happen but only such
[25:51] speech as is good for building up others
[25:54] according to the need and the occasion
[25:56] so that it will be a blessing to those
[25:58] who hear you speak
[26:00] and do not grieve the holy spirit of god
[26:03] interesting
[26:04] that he's put in this scripture about
[26:05] grieving his spirit whereby you're
[26:07] sealed into the day of redemption
[26:09] in the subject of anger in the subject
[26:11] of what we say
[26:15] the potential is there to grieve his
[26:17] spirit that's right
[26:19] with our anger and uncontrolled anger
[26:20] and our unresolved anger
[26:22] the potential is theirs do not potential
[26:26] is there is the grievous spirit
[26:27] so he says uh do not grieve the holy
[26:30] spirit by whom you were
[26:31] sealed and marked for the day of
[26:33] redemption the final deliverance from
[26:35] our consequences of sin verse 31 so then
[26:38] let all bitterness
[26:39] and wrath and anger and clamor
[26:43] and that means perpetual resentment
[26:46] strife
[26:47] fault-finding let and slander
[26:50] let all of that be put away from you god
[26:53] help me as a christian
[26:55] god help us as christians let all
[26:58] bitterness and wrath
[26:59] and anger and clamor and strife and
[27:02] fault-finding
[27:03] and slander let it just be put away from
[27:05] us
[27:06] along with every
[27:10] kind of malice and verbal abuse
[27:14] and male violence and spitefulness
[27:18] verse 32 be kind and helpful to one
[27:21] another
[27:22] be tenderhearted compassionate
[27:24] understanding
[27:26] forgiving one another why does he bring
[27:28] them the word forgiveness because that's
[27:30] the key
[27:32] to resolving anger he has to mention
[27:36] forgiveness because
[27:37] and i'm not talking about mechanical i'm
[27:39] sorry
[27:40] like we get from our kids sometimes i'm
[27:43] talking about
[27:44] the forgiveness that flows from calvary
[27:50] and flows into your heart and flows out
[27:52] and genuine
[27:54] i forgive you he was at calvary
[27:57] when he said those words forgive them
[28:01] father for they know not what they do
[28:04] so true forgiveness flows from calvary
[28:07] to our souls and that's when we can say
[28:10] i forgive that person
[28:13] the understanding forgiving one another
[28:14] readily and freely doing it
[28:16] just as god in christ also
[28:20] forgave you forgiveness and prayer
[28:23] is the antidote for anger when you stand
[28:26] praying jesus said forgive if you have
[28:30] faith you could have faith to remove
[28:31] mountains and then the next scripture he
[28:33] says when you stand praying
[28:35] forgive brother braham says faith is
[28:37] based on forgiveness
[28:39] based on what jesus said faith is based
[28:41] on
[28:42] forgiveness you can never take
[28:43] forgiveness away from releasing
[28:45] more of your faith how many want more
[28:47] faith tonight
[28:49] you can never have an unforgiving spirit
[28:52] and have more faith
[28:54] you can't do it you will not proceed
[28:57] into greater revelations and faith
[28:59] if you have an unforgiving spirit it's
[29:02] impossible
[29:03] the one word he says when he says if you
[29:06] say to this mountain be thou removed and
[29:07] cast into the sea
[29:08] a couple scriptures later and when you
[29:11] stand praying
[29:13] forgive faith is based upon
[29:17] forgiveness
[29:21] forgiveness is the release of your
[29:24] spirit
[29:25] of everything in the way of faith
[29:28] forgiveness is the release of your
[29:30] spirit of everything that's in the way
[29:32] of faith
[29:34] don't talk about faith with unresolved
[29:36] anger in your heart
[29:38] don't tell me all your great revelations
[29:40] of the message if you have no
[29:42] forgiveness
[29:44] don't talk to me about all your
[29:46] revelations of the message and all your
[29:48] faith
[29:49] in for healing or anything else if you
[29:52] have an
[29:53] unresolved anger in your heart jesus
[29:56] said it doesn't work that way
[29:59] don't tell me all your great relations
[30:00] revelation if you don't have forgiveness
[30:02] and you're holding long grudges for many
[30:04] many years
[30:05] your faith is hindered hindered and you
[30:08] can't grow in faith
[30:09] with an unforgiving spirit now let me
[30:12] just change this up
[30:13] and and start wrapping things up a
[30:15] little bit
[30:16] a few uh you know i don't want to be too
[30:19] long tonight
[30:21] but are you learning something have we
[30:22] learned something and there's a bible
[30:24] study here this wednesday night i feel
[30:25] like really preaching though i'm really
[30:26] enjoying this subject
[30:28] but um i want to wrap it up because i
[30:30] know i don't want to be too long on this
[30:32] wednesday night
[30:33] and plus i forgot to bring my water and
[30:35] so i'll start getting thirsty pretty
[30:36] soon
[30:38] i think i left it in the office there's
[30:40] a few men in the bible of course there's
[30:42] quite a few men
[30:43] that come into some anger i'm only going
[30:46] to talk about three of them tonight
[30:47] and then sunday we'll continue with
[30:49] jonah but there's a few of them
[30:51] in the bible and i want you to see what
[30:53] it was that triggered their anger
[30:55] and then i want you to see what they did
[30:57] with it and the results that come from
[30:59] it their anger
[31:00] and how the enemy got in because that's
[31:01] what i'm speaking about tonight is that
[31:03] give no
[31:04] place to the devil anger can give a
[31:06] place to the devil
[31:07] and so uh here we have men in the bible
[31:10] men that we have respect for men of god
[31:13] and here their anger was triggered by
[31:15] something i want you to see what it was
[31:16] triggered by
[31:18] because it can happen with us as well
[31:19] sometimes and then what they did in
[31:22] their anger what was the results of
[31:23] their
[31:23] in other words what did they do when it
[31:25] was triggered what was their response
[31:27] and
[31:27] how did they how did they you know act
[31:30] with their anger
[31:32] and then how the enemy got into that of
[31:34] course and caused something that wasn't
[31:36] right
[31:36] uzziah is an example of someone who got
[31:40] angry and it wasn't at first
[31:41] isaiah watched his eyes life he was a
[31:43] godly king he wasn't a priest he wasn't
[31:45] a prophet isaiah was a prophet
[31:47] uzziah was a god a godly man he served
[31:50] the lord faithfully and god blessed his
[31:52] kingdom
[31:53] uzziah's kingdom was blessed because he
[31:55] was a good man
[31:56] and isaiah watched him since a boy that
[31:58] he was agreeing you could find this in
[31:59] the message of brother branham if you
[32:01] want to listen to it
[32:02] in the message called influence i
[32:04] believe that he preached that sermon
[32:06] more than any other sermon the message
[32:07] of influence and he read about uzziah
[32:09] and isaiah
[32:10] and uzziah in in second chronicles 26
[32:13] thank you very much you want me to
[32:14] preach longer henry
[32:21] uzziah in second chronicles 26 if you
[32:24] want to write down where it's at
[32:26] in your bible scene study it later it's
[32:28] in second chronicles 26
[32:31] after a while he got lifted up in pride
[32:33] and thought he was real some
[32:34] real somebody and isaiah also watched
[32:36] this and he got so lifted up in pride
[32:39] that he he stepped out of his place he
[32:41] walked into the temple
[32:43] he walked straight through the priests
[32:44] he walked straight through everyone
[32:46] and he was going to go
[32:49] back and begin to do the service of a
[32:51] priest i'll go get my answer myself
[32:53] and all this was violating all the rules
[32:56] because only the priests were supposed
[32:57] to serve in the temple and do these
[32:58] things
[32:59] the urim of thumb the the coal fire all
[33:02] these other things that they did in
[33:03] there
[33:03] was not didn't belong to a king to
[33:05] handle that god set the priest to do it
[33:07] so
[33:08] in his pride he says he stepped out of
[33:10] order he stepped out of his position
[33:12] and uh many there's a bunch of the
[33:15] priests that tried to stop him
[33:17] from doing it because they knew the
[33:19] order and uh they respected the king but
[33:21] he was getting out of
[33:22] out of his place so as he walked in and
[33:25] began to head towards doing that
[33:26] he was warned they ran after him don't
[33:28] do this this is for the priest to do god
[33:29] said that
[33:30] and so they they tried to correct the
[33:32] king
[33:33] and this is where his anger rose up
[33:38] is that when he got corrected by the
[33:41] priest
[33:42] this is when his anger was triggered
[33:45] and his pride said i don't need to be
[33:48] corrected
[33:49] especially by these priests because his
[33:51] pride had told him
[33:53] over time i can do anything i want i can
[33:56] do ever whatever i want to
[33:58] i'm the king and his pride had grown so
[34:01] much
[34:01] that he was instantly angry at anyone
[34:04] who corrected him now pride
[34:06] can grow as well in a person's life
[34:10] and i find pride is associated and can
[34:14] be linked with
[34:15] anger anger can be building up inside
[34:17] somebody
[34:18] because they build up their pride and so
[34:20] they get themselves on edge that they're
[34:22] carrying their feelings on their
[34:23] shoulders
[34:23] but their pride says i can do whatever i
[34:26] want
[34:27] nobody tells me what to do nobody
[34:29] corrects me
[34:30] at times we find young people become
[34:32] this way and it's just their pride
[34:33] nobody's going to tell me what to do not
[34:35] my parents not anybody not any preacher
[34:37] pride does that and they beca they lose
[34:40] their humility
[34:41] and so now at all of this that was
[34:43] inside of yazay that had been growing it
[34:45] wasn't just pride but his anger was
[34:47] growing
[34:48] at a moment he got into a quick rage at
[34:51] someone who disagreed with him or didn't
[34:53] want didn't let him do what he wanted to
[34:55] do
[34:55] and i personally believe that yazai's
[34:57] anger was already festering
[34:59] inside of his pride it just was
[35:01] triggered
[35:02] by a priest trying to correct him
[35:06] you need to ask yourself the question
[35:08] tonight how do i respond to correction
[35:10] brother michael taught a little couple
[35:13] services on it that was excellent
[35:15] how do we respond and taking correction
[35:17] especially from the holy spirit from the
[35:19] word from his vessels
[35:21] we we need to brother branham commented
[35:23] on this and he says
[35:24] we need to know that we're able to take
[35:26] correction we need to be able to take
[35:28] correction
[35:28] isaiah couldn't take correction and he
[35:31] got anger his angry
[35:33] anger was triggered because
[35:36] he got mad because he couldn't take
[35:39] correction from the priest examine your
[35:42] life
[35:42] and see if this is the source of your
[35:44] anger and source that makes you angry is
[35:46] when the word corrects because i'll tell
[35:48] you
[35:49] the word always corrects the air
[35:52] in our lives the holy spirit has a
[35:54] nature to him it's a gentle nature
[35:57] it's not belligerent it's not a bully
[35:59] but don't ever forget the holy spirit
[36:02] when he's around if there's something to
[36:04] correct
[36:05] he wants to correct it we'll let it go
[36:08] we'll leave it alone
[36:09] a lot of churches will leave it alone
[36:11] but when the holy spirit is present
[36:14] he will be looking for the air in our
[36:16] lives when everybody else is patting us
[36:18] on the back
[36:19] the holy spirit was saying but i can't
[36:21] leave that alone
[36:22] i'm going to be a gentleman and correct
[36:25] what's wrong
[36:26] the word always corrects the air so
[36:28] uzziah
[36:30] got angry because the word was
[36:33] correcting him
[36:35] the priest was correcting him
[36:38] so then the results was he was
[36:41] instantly struck with leprosy how many
[36:43] know what leprosy is
[36:45] leprosy represents sin so his pride
[36:49] made him angry at correction in his
[36:52] anger
[36:53] brought leprosy and when leprosy came
[36:55] the devil took over and took his place
[36:57] in his life
[36:58] he lost everything he lost the kingdom
[37:00] and he died of leprosy and had to go to
[37:02] a leper colony
[37:04] why it all started with pride and anger
[37:08] unresolved anger and it brought leprosy
[37:11] in his life elijah is another man that
[37:12] i'll quickly go to
[37:14] what triggered anger one day with elisha
[37:18] what triggered anger with elijah
[37:20] elisha
[37:23] and i'm speaking about the incident
[37:25] where he turns to some kids
[37:26] and he curses them and the she-bear
[37:28] comes out and kills them
[37:30] brother brahm said that wasn't right he
[37:31] shouldn't have done that and he did it
[37:33] in his anger
[37:35] and but what triggered it is interesting
[37:38] because
[37:40] they were making fun of him because
[37:43] of his bald head right
[37:46] it's true he got angry because
[37:50] kids were making fun of his bald head
[37:54] and calling him baldy they would
[37:55] probably wrote a song about it and they
[37:57] were probably
[37:58] singing it baldy oh
[38:02] baldy elisha
[38:05] and brother brown referred to his
[38:07] parents their parents talking around the
[38:09] kitchen table
[38:10] their disrespect to the prophet and it
[38:13] passed down to the kids and so when they
[38:15] got from he hadn't they had no respect
[38:16] for the prophet of god
[38:18] so the parents were responsible too he
[38:21] said that the shebears killed those
[38:22] children
[38:23] and really the responsibility went back
[38:24] to the parents and their disrespect for
[38:26] the prophet of god
[38:27] talking about things they shouldn't have
[38:28] in front of the children but it was
[38:30] to elijah now why would he get so angry
[38:32] well probably the disrespect
[38:34] but it might have been linked to a
[38:36] complex about him
[38:38] be involved so my lesson to you is that
[38:41] sometimes our anger is triggered by
[38:44] somebody who takes in a personal attack
[38:47] to us a personal attack
[38:51] to our character a personal attack
[38:54] and we really don't like it when they've
[38:56] falsely accused us
[38:58] how many can get angry when somebody
[39:00] falsely accuses you
[39:02] yes something personal is something
[39:06] personal somebody does something to our
[39:07] children
[39:08] that's personal and it can trigger anger
[39:12] within us we're going to defend our kids
[39:15] because we quickly act upon something
[39:17] because it's a personal thing and so i'm
[39:20] not saying that's not real and don't
[39:22] happen but i
[39:23] say that elisha was wrong to respond in
[39:26] anger the way that he did
[39:28] because it was a personal attack at him
[39:31] so i'm asking the question
[39:32] is there sometimes that our anger gets
[39:34] uncontrolled and gets out of hand and
[39:36] the devil
[39:37] gets a place with our anger because
[39:39] somebody has attacked us
[39:41] personally it's a personal attack
[39:46] and where do we need to be growing to
[39:47] say lord
[39:49] um well first of all lord you were
[39:52] personally attacked
[39:55] you were persecuted you
[39:58] were slain you were made fun of you were
[40:02] mocked
[40:03] so how am i going to get through this
[40:05] with christ without getting some mocking
[40:07] going on
[40:08] um so uh is our anger triggered by
[40:12] something personal
[40:13] someone teasing us or something like
[40:15] that we may feel it but what do we do
[40:18] with it we may
[40:18] feel the anger coming up but what we
[40:21] what do we do with it
[40:23] and to act as he did
[40:26] and i i think in in anger in growing in
[40:30] him
[40:31] the kids that day mess with a very
[40:34] sensitive area
[40:36] which kids are well at doing
[40:40] and he cursed them and he called she
[40:42] bear out to kill them
[40:45] let me just end this and say ministers
[40:48] and all saints of god we must
[40:51] constantly bring our personal complexes
[40:54] to the lord and die to them if we can
[41:00] because personal complexes and when
[41:02] somebody gets them
[41:03] can trigger anger in our lives and we
[41:05] start defending ourselves
[41:08] and responding and we need to bring our
[41:10] complexes i tell ministers this
[41:12] you can preach and get behind the pulpit
[41:15] but i like to see a life
[41:17] growing in the word not just what he can
[41:20] preach over the pulpit
[41:22] but he's dying to his complexes he's
[41:24] bringing him to the throne
[41:26] he's got his family in order and he's
[41:28] striving to get closer to the lord it's
[41:30] not just what you preach here
[41:32] are you dying to your complexes and the
[41:33] reason i say that to ministers because
[41:35] i've watched older ministers and if they
[41:36] can minister 30 40 50 years
[41:39] have a great following if they don't die
[41:41] to their complexes early on in their
[41:43] ministry it'll spill over in their
[41:44] ministry eventually
[41:46] and affect the sheep i know that's being
[41:49] honest but i've watched it so much
[41:51] i'm always saying to the lord help me to
[41:52] die to my complexes help me not to make
[41:54] that
[41:55] prevalent thing because it can be an
[41:57] attack to us
[41:58] if we don't die to those things and all
[42:00] of a sudden we start attacking people
[42:01] back across the pulpit
[42:03] and that's not going to help the sheep
[42:04] at all
[42:06] right so uh a minister if he goes many
[42:10] many years
[42:11] he'll start abusing his authority and
[42:13] all it is behind the scenes is he's got
[42:15] huge complexes that he'd never died to
[42:18] and now he's defending himself and using
[42:21] the authority of the word
[42:22] to do it
[42:26] ministers but all people that are people
[42:29] of god should
[42:31] bring your complexes to the lord and say
[42:32] lord help me to die to those things
[42:35] or at least help me to bring them under
[42:37] the control of the holy spirit
[42:39] the last one i want to talk about
[42:41] tonight is moses i'd like you to turn
[42:43] the book of numbers and we'll read this
[42:45] one before we go this evening can you
[42:46] can you give me one more character
[42:49] moses a prophet of god and this is an
[42:51] interesting
[42:52] section of scripture that really became
[42:55] really real to me
[42:56] today as we looked at it again numbers
[42:58] chapter 20
[42:59] and we'll start here at verse 2. and
[43:03] there
[43:03] numbers 20 and verse 2 and there was no
[43:05] water for the congregation
[43:07] and they gathered themselves together
[43:09] against moses and against aaron
[43:11] and the people chode with moses and
[43:14] spake
[43:14] saying would god that we had died when
[43:16] our brethren died before the lord
[43:18] and why have ye brought up the
[43:21] congregation of the lord
[43:22] into this wilderness that we in our
[43:25] cattle should die there
[43:26] and where you know it's interesting the
[43:28] children of israel
[43:30] when they were in egypt they were crying
[43:32] to god to deliver them
[43:34] and god did deliver them and they have
[43:36] so forgot that
[43:37] they're actually blaming the prophet for
[43:39] bringing them out of egypt
[43:40] and they're the ones that cried to god
[43:42] to come out of it
[43:44] but immaturity and wherefore have you
[43:46] made us to come up out of egypt to bring
[43:48] us into this evil place
[43:50] it is no place of a seed or figs or
[43:52] vines or pomegranates
[43:54] neither is there any water to drink and
[43:55] moses and aaron went from the presence
[43:57] of the assembly
[43:58] unto the door of the tabernacle of
[43:59] congregation and they fell upon their
[44:01] faces
[44:02] and the glory of the lord appeared unto
[44:04] them and the lord spake unto moses
[44:05] saying
[44:06] take the rod and gather thou the
[44:08] assembly together thou and aaron thy
[44:10] brother and
[44:11] speak he unto the rock before their eyes
[44:13] and it shall give forth his water
[44:16] and thou shalt bring forth to them water
[44:18] out of the rock
[44:19] so thou shalt give the congregation and
[44:22] their beast
[44:22] drink and moses took the rod from before
[44:25] the lord as he commanded him
[44:27] and moses and aaron gathered the
[44:29] congregation together before the rock
[44:31] and he said unto them
[44:33] hear now ye rebels must we
[44:36] fetch you water out of this rock and
[44:39] moses lifted up his hand
[44:40] and with his rod he smote the rock twice
[44:44] and the water came out abundantly and
[44:46] the congregation drank
[44:48] and their beast also anybody notice what
[44:51] went wrong
[44:54] he disobeyed god he said to speak to the
[44:58] rock
[44:59] not to smite the rock so now you've got
[45:02] to look at moses and say
[45:04] what is it that's festering in him
[45:07] to make him smite the rock twice
[45:11] instead of obey god and speak to the
[45:13] rock
[45:15] it was anger and it was anger that had
[45:18] festered for quite a while
[45:20] towards god's people and finished the
[45:24] story real quickly
[45:25] and the lord spake unto moses and aaron
[45:28] because she believed me not to sanctify
[45:30] me in the eyes of the children of israel
[45:32] therefore ye shall not bring this
[45:33] congregation into the land
[45:34] which i've given them pretty serious
[45:36] they're not going to get to go into the
[45:37] land
[45:38] this is the water of maraba because the
[45:40] children of israel strove with the lord
[45:41] and he was sanctified in them so let me
[45:43] make a few points before we
[45:45] close tonight can you give me 10 more
[45:46] minutes
[45:48] so this is an amazing scripture it
[45:50] reveals so much i can preach another
[45:52] sermon just on this
[45:54] it's amazing scripture because it shows
[45:56] us a man
[45:57] a prophet of god getting to the place to
[46:00] step
[46:01] out of his place because of one thing
[46:04] and that's because his
[46:05] anger that had grown over time against
[46:09] god's own people and their ways and
[46:12] their complaining
[46:14] and their immaturities a man of god a
[46:16] prophet
[46:17] gets frustrated and eventually anger and
[46:19] that he didn't resolve the anger it was
[46:21] growing inside of him
[46:23] and his anger was towards god's people
[46:26] and their ways and their complaining and
[46:29] their immaturities it got to them
[46:32] it started to really eat at him and
[46:36] those who are bible studiers know that
[46:38] back in exodus
[46:40] when they were coming across the land
[46:42] they ran
[46:43] out of water they needed water to live
[46:45] by
[46:46] and god instructs moses to strike the
[46:50] rock
[46:52] right so the first time they needed
[46:54] water he instructs
[46:56] moses to strike the rock he struck the
[46:58] rock
[46:59] one time struck at one time how many
[47:02] know that the rock is a type of christ
[47:05] how many know the waters of life come
[47:06] out of christ
[47:08] how many know that he was smitten one
[47:10] time at calvary
[47:11] how many know when he was spitting at
[47:13] calvary the water of life flowed to your
[47:15] life
[47:16] but he was only to be smitten one time
[47:19] he doesn't have to go to calvary again
[47:21] you don't have to go to calvary again it
[47:23] doesn't need to be smitten again
[47:25] he was spitting one time and that
[47:27] provided the water of life for the
[47:28] people of god
[47:30] so moses in doing that brother braham
[47:31] says is breaking
[47:33] every type of the bible he's breaking
[47:34] all these types and shadows
[47:36] he goes into the very permissive will of
[47:38] god by doing this
[47:40] because the shadow and the type is you
[47:42] don't have to smite that rock twice
[47:44] the next time you just speak to the rock
[47:46] and the water will come
[47:49] hallelujah oh i can preach another
[47:51] sermon tonight
[47:52] he doesn't have to go to calvary again
[47:54] we don't have to smite anything again
[47:56] we just speak the word can you say amen
[47:59] and the waters flow freely tonight right
[48:01] to our lives
[48:03] hallelujah his waters are still flowing
[48:05] from calvary tonight for your need
[48:07] if you're thirsty and hungry for god the
[48:10] waters are still flowing tonight
[48:13] blessed be his name so
[48:16] so what happened in exodus
[48:19] was it was a need of the people
[48:23] all right they got thirsty it was the
[48:25] need of the people
[48:27] people will always have needs
[48:34] you're going to have family members that
[48:36] always have needs
[48:39] you have needs family members pulling on
[48:42] you that have needs
[48:44] okay but pastoring a congregation
[48:47] until we get out of here people are
[48:49] always going to
[48:50] be needy and have needs and
[48:54] often the needs bring symptoms
[48:58] of complaining and
[49:01] immaturities this is the children of
[49:03] israel but
[49:04] it's us too it's congregations today
[49:08] so you have a need i'm craving i'm
[49:10] missing something in my life i'm missing
[49:12] and a lot of times when people are
[49:14] missing and craving something a lot of
[49:15] times they need the word of god they
[49:17] need refreshing of the holy spirit
[49:18] they need and so but they don't know
[49:20] what they need and so they're just
[49:21] complaining
[49:23] and they're acting immature and they're
[49:25] gossiping and they're backbiting and
[49:27] they're
[49:27] all the symptoms come out and guess what
[49:30] you can get
[49:31] mad at the symptoms
[49:35] but the symptoms come from a need
[49:39] how many has ever been in a conversation
[49:41] because i have i don't know if you have
[49:42] but you're
[49:43] you know you say something i can't
[49:44] believe that person's doing that i can't
[49:46] believe they did that to me
[49:47] they did that other person and so you're
[49:49] going on and on
[49:50] and then somebody says this statement
[49:52] you're going to say i can't believe
[49:53] they'd even do that
[49:54] and somebody says but isn't that a cry
[49:56] for help
[50:01] and you go shut up i wasn't thinking
[50:02] about that
[50:04] but they speak truth all these symptoms
[50:07] of people acting crazy and immature and
[50:09] doing all these stupid things
[50:11] isn't that a cry for help in a lot of
[50:14] cases
[50:15] it is so now we will judge people and we
[50:19] will speak and we will get
[50:21] angry and frustrated as moses did with
[50:24] the people of god i shouldn't be walking
[50:25] around tonight
[50:26] because we have very limited video
[50:28] people to follow me around here
[50:31] i get used to it we tend to judge people
[50:35] by the symptoms
[50:36] and the complaining and the immaturities
[50:39] and fail to get to the need
[50:43] god always wants to know what they need
[50:45] is matter of fact the song says
[50:47] he looked beyond my faults
[50:51] and saw my need praise the lord brothers
[50:54] and sisters
[50:54] shouldn't we be that way how about we
[50:57] look beyond
[50:58] people's faults like god does to us
[51:02] and see their cry for help and see their
[51:05] need
[51:06] the symptoms of something no matter how
[51:08] bad a person gets
[51:10] it started with some need that was being
[51:13] unmet
[51:15] by christ or by some other means
[51:19] but mostly it's because they needed the
[51:21] lord they needed
[51:23] calvary so now all this
[51:26] ugliness comes out in a person
[51:30] and it's a cry for help
[51:33] we focus on the way they're acting we
[51:36] become angry with the way they're acting
[51:38] yet god looks beyond our faults and sees
[51:40] our need moses
[51:42] over time he grew angry and so him
[51:45] smiting the rock twice came from some
[51:48] growing
[51:49] cancer of anger inside of his spirit
[51:52] he got tired of the complaining of the
[51:55] people
[51:56] and the the immaturities of the people
[52:01] moses was told this time to speak and
[52:04] not strike
[52:05] why christ did not need to be smote
[52:08] again
[52:09] only speak it out but his anger made him
[52:13] smite it twice
[52:14] and he broke all the types of christ
[52:16] putting him in the permissive will of
[52:18] god
[52:19] your anger will have you even use
[52:23] the word
[52:27] on your family
[52:32] when our anger you holding tight here a
[52:34] minute
[52:35] are you listening
[52:39] your anger will sometimes even have you
[52:42] using the word
[52:44] on your family and even to a church a
[52:46] pastor to a church
[52:48] and put you right in the permissive will
[52:51] of god
[52:52] because the word is right but your anger
[52:56] is wrong
[53:02] moses was right to go to the rock
[53:07] but his motive for going to the rock and
[53:10] smiting it twice his motive
[53:12] was wrong preachers can preach
[53:15] the complete truth of this message out
[53:17] of anger
[53:20] and it's not blessed
[53:24] preachers can preach but preach with the
[53:25] wrong motive
[53:27] let's not preach just the preachers
[53:28] tonight let's talk about all of us
[53:31] right and a church will be come into the
[53:34] person miss the will of god
[53:36] because the pastor is using the word
[53:41] but his anger has grown so much and he's
[53:44] frustrated with the frustrate
[53:45] for with the immaturity of the people
[53:47] and he's just he's going to strike it
[53:49] he's going to strike it he's going to
[53:52] strike
[53:53] out and he strikes out in his anger
[53:58] and you know what happens
[54:01] the water comes out anyway because god
[54:04] will not deny his people
[54:07] if somebody has a need the water comes
[54:08] out the water came out of the rock for
[54:10] israel anyway
[54:11] but like brother brahm says the water's
[54:13] flowing out the children israel
[54:14] rejoicing
[54:15] and they're over there oh we got water
[54:16] praise the lord god provided the need
[54:19] and then he says moses aaron come over
[54:21] here a minute
[54:26] not in front of everybody he brought
[54:27] tomorrow says moses and aaron
[54:29] right there you glorified yourself
[54:33] and not me so you see the promised land
[54:36] over there you don't get to go
[54:41] wow now
[54:44] interestingly enough i'm closing i know
[54:48] 10 minutes i know i got it i got the
[54:51] clock up there
[54:53] two chapters before that you read your
[54:55] bible tonight
[54:56] god calls the children of israel
[55:00] rebels
[55:03] so moses in his anger he said well god
[55:06] called them rebels
[55:07] so now i'm going to call them rebels
[55:11] and so he was so burnt up at these
[55:13] people complaining
[55:14] he had dealt with it for years and even
[55:17] sometimes when god would get angry see
[55:19] god's anger is different than our anger
[55:21] he has anger and god wouldn't get angry
[55:24] and he says i'm trying to swipe the
[55:25] whole thing off they're all finished and
[55:27] moses steps in like christ said
[55:28] lord don't do that this is your people
[55:32] that was christ and moses but god's
[55:35] two chapters are there calls them rebels
[55:37] this is how you deal with the rebels and
[55:38] moses just thought you know what
[55:40] i am so sick of these people okay lord
[55:42] you told me to go
[55:44] speak to the rock he takes that thing
[55:45] over and strikes that rock
[55:47] ye rebels you always need stuff
[55:51] didn't come out sick of all you people
[55:57] and the water comes out but god says
[56:00] come over here
[56:02] you just glorified yourself that's what
[56:05] men will do
[56:06] if they don't resolve their anger and
[56:07] preach their anger
[56:09] they eventually glorify themselves
[56:14] and god will not share his glory with
[56:17] anybody
[56:19] no preacher no popular preacher nobody
[56:21] not even you
[56:22] he's not going to share it with anybody
[56:24] we're in the service of the lord to obey
[56:26] what he said to do
[56:28] and to do it the way that he said to do
[56:30] it and i wish i had five more minutes
[56:32] but let me just say this
[56:34] striking out with the word to deal with
[56:36] rebellion
[56:37] instead of letting the water flow from
[56:39] the word to meet the needs
[56:42] i think we could we should speak the
[56:44] word today
[56:46] we don't have to strike anything my
[56:49] question to you is
[56:50] are you smiting or are you speaking
[56:59] are you smiting or are you speaking or
[57:01] you are your words
[57:02] your words are smiting but they're not
[57:05] really speaking anything
[57:07] they're smiting words
[57:12] important
[57:22] i got a last note here that says
[57:25] this word and to get the results of it
[57:28] only needs to be spoken like moses
[57:30] was told speak to the rod it's already
[57:33] been smitten
[57:34] just speak to the rock it only needs to
[57:37] be spoken to
[57:38] to meet the needs of the people
[57:41] but it needs to be spoken with the holy
[57:44] ghost
[57:45] and love behind it
[57:48] not anger
[57:52] when anger is behind it it might be the
[57:55] very word
[57:56] and it might break the water to the
[57:57] people but it's not the right motive
[58:00] that we should speak the word but when
[58:02] his word
[58:04] is spoken with the holy ghost behind it
[58:07] and with love behind it that's when
[58:09] we're getting somewhere in maturity
[58:13] and our anger is is put
[58:16] is washed away
[58:19] our anger is brought to the cross
[58:24] on a daily basis and when it's brought
[58:28] to the cross on a
[58:29] daily basis then it gives no place
[58:33] to the devil to get in
[58:36] speak to the rock moses i've already
[58:39] smitten it it's already there
[58:41] calvary's already provided just speak
[58:43] the word in love
[58:45] speak the word with the right attitude
[58:49] and that's the way i want to see it
[58:52] presented we never accomplish
[58:56] anything for his kingdom when we have
[59:00] unresolved anger in our hearts
[59:05] but when our spirit is free
[59:08] and we're motivated by love god
[59:12] can really further his kingdom in a
[59:15] mighty way
[59:17] everybody say amen praise the lord leave
[59:20] it there
[59:23] you got to leave it there let's stand
[59:26] together

[1:01:47] there it says
[1:01:48] when you're in enemies are said
[1:01:53] and your heart begins to fail
