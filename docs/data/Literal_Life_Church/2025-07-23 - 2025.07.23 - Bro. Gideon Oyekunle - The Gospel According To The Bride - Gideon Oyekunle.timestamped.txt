[31:21] Second Kings chapter 5. Now non captain
[31:26] of the host of the king of Syria was a
[31:28] great man with his master and honorable
[31:33] because by him the Lord had given
[31:36] deliverance unto Syria. He was also a
[31:39] mighty man in veil, but he was a leper.
[31:43] And the Syrians had gone out by
[31:45] companies and had brought away captive
[31:48] out of the land of Israel, a little
[31:52] maid. And she waited on Neon's wife. And
[31:56] she said unto her mistress, "Will God,
[31:58] my Lord, were with the prophet that is
[32:01] in Samaria, for he will recover him of
[32:05] his leprosy."
[32:08] Revelation
[32:10] chapter
[32:13] 10
[32:16] I read from verse 8.
[32:24] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[32:26] spake unto me again and said, Go and
[32:30] take the little book which is open in
[32:32] the hand of the angel which standed upon
[32:35] the sea and upon the earth. And I went
[32:38] unto the angel, and said unto him, Give
[32:41] me the little book. And he said unto me,
[32:45] Take it and hear it up, and it shall
[32:48] make thy belly bitter, but it shall be
[32:51] in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took
[32:54] the little book out of the angel's end,
[32:57] and held it up, and it was in my mouth
[33:00] sweet as honey. And as soon as I had
[33:03] eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he
[33:06] said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again
[33:11] before many peoples and nations and
[33:14] tongues and kings." May the Lord bless
[33:17] the reading of his holy word. Amen. God
[33:20] bless me. Be seated.
[33:28] The gospel according to the bride.
[33:32] The gospel according to you. The gospel
[33:36] according to me. Amen. All right. So, uh
[33:41] I remember a good friend of mine,
[33:44] brother Shalas, you know that sent
[33:46] greetings to you. Amen. God bless you.
[33:49] You know so many of them.
[33:52] If I should stand here to give
[33:54] greetings, maybe that will be the
[33:56] service.
[33:58] God bless you all. All right. So tonight
[34:02] we want to speak on the gospel according
[34:05] to the bride. Amen. Is that brother
[34:08] Michael? Right. God bless you brother
[34:11] Mike. Thank you. And the family. Amen.
[34:14] So the gospel according to the bride
[34:17] basically you know the gospel means good
[34:20] news.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; That is the meaning of the word gospel.
[34:23] It means good news. Not bad news but
[34:27] good news. But when we look into the
[34:30] world today, all what you hear is bad
[34:34] news.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Bad news everywhere. You tune in the
[34:40] radios, you read on the newspaper, on
[34:42] the media, social media, everywhere. Bad
[34:45] news. Because when we look into the
[34:47] world today, we can see how science is
[34:50] advancing.
[34:51] But yet in all those advancement,
[34:55] you can see you know the hazard. you
[34:57] know that are behind those things the
[34:59] dangers you know behind the labors and
[35:03] the effort of man on the planet earth.
[35:06] So he's bringing you know bad news into
[35:09] the world more and more and more
[35:13] &gt;&gt; and it has become as it was in the days
[35:16] of Sodom.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; The news in Sodom was fixing the
[35:22] righteous soul of Lot. But Lot has no
[35:25] grace, you know, to stand against it
[35:28] because the prophet of God said his wife
[35:31] will not allow him to speak against it.
[35:34] And he said, you know, that's the type
[35:36] of the church today because we have a
[35:39] lot of lot in Sodom whose righteous soul
[35:42] are being fed, you know, but the woman,
[35:45] the church will not allow them, you
[35:48] know, to speak against it. They don't
[35:51] have the grace.
[35:53] is the season is the time that we are
[35:56] living in.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; But brothers and sister there is
[36:00] difference between you and Lot.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Difference between me and Lot
[36:06] &gt;&gt; because we are not in Sodom.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; We are outside Sodom.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; We are Abramite. Abraham never lived in
[36:14] Sodom. But Abraham said, you know why
[36:16] the reason why Lot's soul was being
[36:19] fixed was because Lot has been with it.
[36:22] Abraham before before he went down into
[36:25] Sodom. And brother, when you look into
[36:27] the war today, that's the type of Sodom.
[36:31] The word the prophet said is in sodom
[36:33] condition.
[36:35] And the whole world, not, you know,
[36:37] without an exception, the whole world is
[36:40] in sodom condition. I don't care you
[36:43] know how best you know they can try to
[36:46] produce or present anything before us in
[36:49] the world today is still Sodom and the
[36:52] bride of Jesus Christ a type of Abraham
[36:56] was is not in Sodom but we are living
[36:59] outside Sodom and that's the reason why
[37:02] tonight I can tell you that this bride
[37:04] is not living in America
[37:07] &gt;&gt; this bride is not living in England this
[37:09] bride is not living in Canada we are not
[37:12] living in Europe. We are not living in
[37:14] Nigeria. But where do we live? We are
[37:17] living, you know, in heaven on earth.
[37:21] That's where we live. We are seated, the
[37:24] Bible said, in heavenly places in Christ
[37:27] Jesus.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Is an atmosphere that has been brought
[37:31] down and we are raptured into the
[37:33] atmosphere. And that is where we live.
[37:36] The Bible said in the book of Hebrews
[37:38] chapter 12 that we are gathered here.
[37:41] Hallelujah. Not in literal life church
[37:45] but we are gathered in here where in
[37:48] heaven Jerusalem.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; We are here in heaven in the presence of
[37:53] the angels. The Bible sayable companies
[37:56] of angels through the spirit of just men
[37:59] made perfect through Jesus Christ the
[38:02] mediator of the new testament. the new
[38:06] covenant to the sprinkling of the blood
[38:09] which speaketh better things than the
[38:11] blood of heaven. Hallelujah. That is
[38:13] where we live. That's where we gather.
[38:17] And we are not just only gather here
[38:19] tonight. We are there all the time.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are hearing from home
[38:25] because that is our homeland. And we are
[38:28] hearing from home from day to day. We
[38:30] are hearing from home tonight. We are
[38:32] hearing from home tomorrow. Whether
[38:34] there is church or no church, we are
[38:36] hearing from home. Hallelujah. Because
[38:39] you know our soul comes from there. And
[38:42] then brothers and sister, we are living
[38:44] by the word of God. And I want to ask
[38:47] you tonight, how long have you heard
[38:49] from whom? Since when have you heard
[38:52] from whom? Oh brother, there must be a
[38:54] pool within you. You know, every night,
[38:57] every day, every moment, every hour.
[39:00] Hallelujah. You know, we got to fill the
[39:02] pool all the time. Like our gracious
[39:04] brother Paul here, you know, sing the
[39:06] song, I feel the pull, I hear the call.
[39:10] Hallelujah. And you know the prophet
[39:13] said, if there's a deep in you calling,
[39:15] there will be a deep to respond to the
[39:17] call. Hallelujah. And then we got to
[39:20] feel that pool every day. Hallelujah.
[39:23] Remember that this earth, you know, we
[39:26] are pilgrims and we are strangers. We
[39:28] are not part of this earth. We don't
[39:30] belong in here. This earth is the land
[39:34] of our captivity. It is not our
[39:37] homeland. It is Satan's Eden.
[39:40] Hallelujah. But brothers, our ears is
[39:43] tuned and inclined to the things of
[39:46] heaven. And the brother of what we are
[39:48] hearing is good news from heaven all the
[39:51] time. Angels of God. Hallelujah.
[39:54] Whispering. Hallelujah. Blessed
[39:57] assurance. Oh my.
[40:00] No fixation of soul, no fixation of
[40:04] spirit because there's always a good
[40:07] news.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not confused. We are
[40:11] not disturbed. We are not moved. We are
[40:14] hearing good news. Hallelujah. Oh,
[40:17] blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[40:19] brothers,
[40:21] &gt;&gt; just as we go, do you know that good bad
[40:24] news started in Genesis?
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Bad news started in Genesis.
[40:30] Yes. Everything you know started in
[40:34] Genesis. It all that's why Genesis was
[40:37] called Genesis. That's the seed chapter.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; You know that's Genesis the beginning
[40:43] and the bad news started in Genesis
[40:46] after the fall because before the fall
[40:49] at the creation it was good news all the
[40:52] way.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; You know from the first day of creation,
[40:56] Amen. it was good news. The first day
[40:59] the Bible says and it was good. The
[41:02] second day and it was good. The third
[41:05] day and it was good. The fourth day and
[41:08] it was good. The fifth day and it was
[41:11] good. On the sixth day, the Bible say it
[41:13] was very good. Hallelujah. Good news all
[41:16] along the road. Oh my God. Blessed be
[41:19] the name of the Lord. And on the sixth
[41:21] day and it was very good. Why? Because
[41:25] Adam, the son of God, the governor of
[41:28] the earth, has finally arrived.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; He was man in God's own image. He was
[41:34] created with the breath of life in him
[41:37] and was given dominion over everything
[41:40] to rule over them. That was his nature.
[41:44] Adam, you know, was not afraid of
[41:46] anything because there was no sin. There
[41:49] was no sickness. There was no evil.
[41:51] Hallelujah. All was good. Amen. And you
[41:56] know supernatural was the original
[41:58] nature of Adam. Supernatural to Adam was
[42:02] a regular routine. It seems supernatural
[42:06] every day. It was part of his life. It
[42:09] was his nature. It was his way of life.
[42:13] It's supernatural.
[42:15] That was the man that God made and gave
[42:17] the breath of life. Hallelujah. It
[42:20] doesn't need to study engineering in
[42:23] order to construct bridge over the
[42:26] waters of Michigan.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need, you know, to build
[42:30] bridges over the lake Michigan that we
[42:33] went yesterday, Pastor Paul and brother
[42:36] Tomball. Amen. You know, look at that.
[42:39] And we got to walk, you know, on the uh
[42:43] on the beach and then, you know, on
[42:45] those uh concrete steps and, you know,
[42:49] just walking on that. Adam doesn't need
[42:52] that. He didn't need all those things.
[42:55] Adam could walk on water
[42:57] &gt;&gt; like he would walk on the dry ground
[43:01] &gt;&gt; because that was his nature.
[43:04] There was no cause for alarm. He can be
[43:08] walking on water. He was not afraid. He
[43:11] was not scared.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Adam does not need to go to any American
[43:16] embassy to obtain visa and then go, you
[43:20] know, to a line and buy ticket and fly
[43:23] plane down to America like brother
[43:26] Gideon has done from Nigeria.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Adam taught it and is already there.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; He travels like a thought. Hallelujah.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; That was the man in God's own image.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need those things. Oh
[43:43] brother, you look at that. What a great
[43:45] science and what a great scientist that
[43:48] Adam was there.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a civilization
[43:54] that was living by. It was faith
[43:57] civilization.
[43:58] And by the power of restoration tonight,
[44:02] I have this good news for you. Amen.
[44:05] that tonight we are getting into a
[44:08] perfect faith into a rapturing condition
[44:11] and that we are getting into an
[44:13] atmosphere again where all things are
[44:17] possible.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That all Adam lost
[44:24] &gt;&gt; they are being restored back again.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Oh what a glorious thing brothers.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; But look at it brother just before we
[44:32] go. Adam had all these things happening
[44:35] around him, happening to him and he was
[44:38] experiencing it. He was living by that.
[44:42] But one day
[44:44] while all these things were perfectly
[44:46] set, it was good news.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; But one day another scientist came
[44:54] that oh serpent the devil.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And he broke into Adam's house.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] Do you know that he was a scientist?
[45:05] That was why he came and he preached
[45:06] wisdom versus faith. Are you hearing me
[45:10] now? Adam lived by faith. But here came
[45:13] another scientist, you know, by wisdom.
[45:16] You know, to do what? To break into
[45:18] Adam's house in his absence. And the
[45:20] brothers, I want you to remember tonight
[45:23] that the prophet of the Almighty God
[45:24] says that we are God's spiritual
[45:26] scientist.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; We are scientists. And the all the
[45:30] treasures and the resources that are in
[45:32] God's laboratory belong to us.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; All belongs to us. But brother look at
[45:40] the headless scientist. They broke into
[45:43] God's laboratory to perfect those things
[45:47] fooling around. The prophet said until
[45:48] they killed themsel. He said and the
[45:51] devil is a thief and the father of it.
[45:54] And a thief came to ruin and to destroy
[45:58] and he broke into what does not belong
[46:01] to him. And anybody that broke into what
[46:04] does not belong to him is a thief and
[46:07] robber.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the devil. He's a thief and
[46:12] robber.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And there's
[46:15] the father of all those artificials and
[46:18] science and the wisdom you know all came
[46:23] you know from the devil that was the
[46:25] tree of knowledge of good and evil. That
[46:29] scientist came and preached another
[46:32] gospel
[46:34] not to Adam but to the woman
[46:39] because Adam was made in the image of
[46:42] God. He was infallible. The Bible says
[46:45] that Adam was not deceived, but the
[46:49] woman was deceived. But Adam stepped
[46:52] down with his 2020 in order to save that
[46:57] woman. And the Adam doing those things
[47:00] was reflecting the second Adam.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; He was showing grace.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; He was showing the restoration that we
[47:10] come. Yes.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Adam cannot restore
[47:15] himself.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But the second Adam
[47:20] says, I have power to lay down my life
[47:23] and to take it off again. Oh, brother.
[47:26] Because it was God from heaven. Oh,
[47:28] blessed be the name of the Lord. Look at
[47:31] that, brothers.
[47:33] When the serpent
[47:36] preached another gospel and the woman
[47:38] believed it,
[47:40] Then what happened?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; They lost all what they had.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Adam went into it 2020, right? In order
[47:48] to bring the woman back. The prophet of
[47:49] the Almighty God says that the angel
[47:52] went back home weeping.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:58] The angel went back home to heaven
[48:01] weeping. Oh, oh, your son is lost.
[48:09] And it became bad news ever since. And
[48:13] ever since that time we have more
[48:16] hospital, more death. There should be
[48:19] labor. There should be no labor pain.
[48:21] There should be no hospital built. But
[48:24] today we have bad news everywhere. More
[48:27] hospital, more death, more cars, more
[48:30] crisis.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Wiser and weaker. Death, death, death,
[48:36] death. But thanks be to God for Calvary.
[48:40] Hallelujah. Thanks be to God for
[48:42] Calvary. Hallelujah. Thanks be to God.
[48:45] When the news got to heaven, God came
[48:48] down. Hallelujah. He came down and he
[48:52] heard a conference together with every
[48:54] one of them that were involved. And when
[48:57] God has concluded in his conference, he
[49:00] said Genesis 3:15 will be the key
[49:05] to the bad news. Hallelujah. Oh, Genesis
[49:10] 3:15, there will be the seed of the
[49:13] woman, and the seed of the woman will
[49:15] bruise the head of the serpent, and the
[49:17] seed of the serpent will bruise his
[49:19] heel. Hallelujah. And brothers and
[49:22] sisters, that was the conclusion
[49:25] of the conference in the Garden of Eden.
[49:28] And Genesis 3:15 produces Isaiah 7:14.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Behold, the virgin shall conceive. There
[49:37] is the seed of the woman. And Isaiah
[49:40] 7:14 produces Matthew chapter 1 and two.
[49:44] Hallelujah. Oh, brother. And here we can
[49:47] see in the book of Luke
[49:51] how the angel came to the woman.
[49:53] Hallelujah. In the spirit
[49:56] of Genesis 3:15.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; And the angel came unto the woman and
[50:03] told the woman, "Hey, thou are highly
[50:06] faithful. The Lord is with thee. Blessed
[50:08] art thou among women." And when she saw
[50:11] him, she was troubled as he is saying or
[50:16] is he saying, and cast in her mind, what
[50:18] manner of salutation this should be. And
[50:21] the angel said unto her, Fear not Mary,
[50:24] for thou has found favor with God. And
[50:27] behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
[50:29] and bring forth a son, and shall call
[50:32] his name Jesus.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; He shall be great, and shall be called
[50:37] the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God
[50:40] shall give unto him the throne of his
[50:43] father David. And he shall reign over
[50:45] the house of Jacob forever, and of his
[50:48] kingdom there shall be no end. Then said
[50:50] Mary unto the angel, How shall this be?
[50:54] Saying, I know not end. And the angel
[50:56] answered and said unto her, The Holy
[50:59] Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
[51:02] power of the highest shall overshadow
[51:05] thee. Hallelujah.
[51:07] also thy holy thing which shall be born
[51:10] of thee, shall be called the son of God.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she
[51:16] hath also conceived a son in her old
[51:20] age, and this is the sixth month with
[51:23] her who was called barren. For with God
[51:26] nothing shall be impossible.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What a message from the
[51:33] angel of God. Hallelujah. And the angel
[51:36] means messenger. And tonight, brothers
[51:38] and sister, you have an angel in the
[51:41] church. You have the pastor in the
[51:43] church. You have the minister in the
[51:45] church. You have all this angel in the
[51:46] church. And I'm one of them tonight
[51:48] standing before you. And I'm telling you
[51:51] the same thing tonight that with God
[51:53] nothing shall be impossible.
[51:57] All things are possible. Hallelujah. And
[52:01] Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the
[52:04] Lord. be hid unto me according to thy
[52:08] word. Hallelujah. Oh brother, this is
[52:11] the spoken word of God. Hallelujah. And
[52:14] the spoken word of God is trying to find
[52:17] a bedding ground. Hallelujah. And
[52:20] brothers, when the seed finds a bed
[52:23] ground, oh brother, the right place for
[52:25] the seed, it will quicken.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; It will grow.
[52:31] Amen. And tonight, brothers, if your
[52:34] heart is a right ground for the word of
[52:36] the living God, the word of God is a
[52:39] seed that the sow. Hallelujah. All the
[52:42] promises in the book is ours.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; All the promises in the books, they are
[52:53] ours.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; We can claim them. We can receive them
[52:58] tonight. Oh, brother. Simple faith.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me
[53:05] &gt;&gt; according to thy word.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And brothers, Mary contributed nothing.
[53:16] No,
[53:19] &gt;&gt; no, nothing. He didn't she didn't
[53:21] contribute ahead. It was a creation.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. only sinful faith to receive
[53:30] the spoken word. Hallelujah. And the
[53:33] prophet of God said that Jesus Christ
[53:35] was born apart from human male
[53:37] instrumentality.
[53:39] Is that right? And that is you know the
[53:41] virgin birth because Mary was just an
[53:44] incubator. The egg and the hemoglobin
[53:47] were the creation of God and Mary just
[53:50] carry it, you know, to the bath so that
[53:53] we can have a redeemer related to the
[53:56] human race. Hallelujah. Because he has
[53:59] to pass through the woman in order for
[54:01] you and I to call him our brother and in
[54:04] order for him to call us our brothers.
[54:07] Hallelujah. And that's why the Bible say
[54:09] he was not ashamed to call us brethren.
[54:12] Hallelujah. saying, I will make my thy
[54:15] name manifest unto my brethren. In the
[54:18] midst of the congregation, we like
[54:20] praise day. Hallelujah. And tonight,
[54:22] brothers, we have a relation.
[54:25] We have a brother in redemption. Jesus
[54:28] Christ is our brother in redemption. The
[54:30] devil has been stripped.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; He has lost his authority. He has lost
[54:36] his power because we have a brother in
[54:39] redemption tonight. Oh, praise be to
[54:41] God.
[54:43] No wonder the angel can come. You know
[54:46] right there at the birth of our Lord
[54:48] Jesus Christ in the book of Luke in
[54:51] chapter 2 from verse 8 to 14 the Bible
[54:54] says there were shepherd in the field.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And when the shepherds were there in the
[55:00] field what were they doing? They were
[55:02] just wearing they don't know anything
[55:04] but brother the angel came down. Oh
[55:08] praise God. And the angel saluted the
[55:10] serpent. And then here come you know the
[55:13] light amen that surrounds them. The
[55:16] glory of the Lord shine around them. Oh
[55:19] praise God. And the angel said fear not.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. It's always a wonderful
[55:29] time brother that whenever God sends
[55:32] angel angel will say fear not.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to be afraid of. You
[55:39] don't have to be fearful.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be fearful. The Bible
[55:44] says, "Do not be dismayed
[55:47] &gt;&gt; at the signs of heaven. For the heathens
[55:50] are dismayed at these things."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's only the heathens that are
[55:56] afraid. It's only the heathen that are
[55:58] dismayed. It's only the heathen that are
[56:00] perplexed. It's only the heathens that
[56:02] are troubled. Amen. We are believers of
[56:05] the word of God. We can rest upon the
[56:07] word of God. There's nothing to be
[56:09] afraid of. We can rest. Amen. Little
[56:13] bride. Rest. All is well.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; The angel said, "Fear not. I bring unto
[56:22] you glad tidings of great joy."
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glad tidings of great joy. Oh, for
[56:30] lo unto you is born this day in the city
[56:33] of David. Oh, in Bethlehem. The word has
[56:37] been born into existence, vindicated in
[56:40] his full strength. It unto you this day.
[56:43] Oh, praise the Lord.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Unto you.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Can I hear somebody say,
[56:52] "Unto me."
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Unto me.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Great tiding of great joy. Glad tiden of
[57:00] great joy. Unto me.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you believe
[57:06] that?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Call it yours.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; The good tidings, that glad tidings of
[57:18] great joy is unto you and unto me. Amen.
[57:22] What is it, brothers? Good news is back
[57:27] on earth again.
[57:29] Hallelujah.
[57:31] Good news is back on earth again.
[57:34] Remember in Genesis there was good news.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; The old creation there was good news.
[57:41] Then this is the beginning of the new
[57:43] creation of God. I believe you
[57:46] understand. And then he brings back
[57:48] what? Good news to the earth. Oh, glory
[57:52] to God. Good news is back on earth
[57:55] again. But when he died, the prophet
[57:57] said, "And he rose again on the third
[57:59] day, it was the greatest news flash in
[58:03] his
[58:06] &gt;&gt; brother said when Jesus Christ was born,
[58:09] it was good news."
[58:12] Amen.
[58:13] In the message of the rising of the sun
[58:16] in Proverbs 60, he said, "No wonder the
[58:20] gospel is good news." The very word
[58:23] gospel means the good news.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; The good news. What? If a man die for
[58:29] our sake, that's good news. If Christ
[58:31] was born, that's good news.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But never a news,
[58:38] never was there news like this,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; like this news that he who made a
[58:43] promise has confirmed the promise that
[58:46] is alive forever more. And now the keys
[58:48] of both death and hell in his end all
[58:52] the gloom was shook away. There was no
[58:55] more gloom to be seen. Oh, praise the
[58:58] Lord. He said, for the son was come out
[59:01] from the grave. There was no well he
[59:03] will come or he may come. He had already
[59:06] come. The gospel good news. Amen. Notice
[59:11] the very message of the gospel he said
[59:13] is to prove to the people that he is
[59:16] risen. God tell my disciples that I'm
[59:19] risen from the dead and I will meet them
[59:22] to confirm this to them. Oh God, how in
[59:27] this last day there shall be light again
[59:30] across the earth and I will prove to my
[59:32] disciples. God tell them that I am not
[59:35] dead and I'm not a tradition but I am a
[59:40] living Christ. I will meet them. Tell
[59:44] this message to my disciples that I'm
[59:46] risen from the dead. You say is that
[59:48] right? Hebrew 13:8
[59:51] is the same yesterday, today and
[59:53] forever. We his beneficiaries are to
[59:56] prove his life in us. Now the
[59:59] beneficiary of this life. The life there
[1:00:03] never was a life live like it. He was
[1:00:06] the son of God and he died and that shut
[1:00:09] it out. But when he raised again from
[1:00:12] the dead on Easter morning, then we as
[1:00:16] his servant are commissioned by him to
[1:00:19] go into all the world and to bring this
[1:00:22] good news to every person
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; that he is a gospel that he is a living
[1:00:28] rather. And how can we do it by word
[1:00:31] only? For it is written, the gospel came
[1:00:35] not by word only, but through the power
[1:00:38] and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:42] to prove that he is alive.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:49] Oh, what a glorious time that the good
[1:00:51] news is back on earth.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through the birth of Christ, the
[1:00:58] good news is back through his death,
[1:01:00] burial, and resurrection. The good news
[1:01:03] is bad. Brother Brown said it was good
[1:01:05] news that Christ was born. Is that
[1:01:07] right? He said but when he died and he
[1:01:11] rose again. Hallelujah. He said never
[1:01:15] have we ever had a news like that.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And but Abraham call it the greatest
[1:01:21] news flash in the history.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Why? When you go into the book of
[1:01:29] Revelation in chapter 5, we find out
[1:01:34] that John was there when that book was
[1:01:37] taken. Hallelujah. Oh brothers, the book
[1:01:41] was in the hand of the eternal one. And
[1:01:44] there was a call for the worthy one and
[1:01:46] there was no one worthy to take the book
[1:01:48] or to lose the sevens thereof.
[1:01:50] Hallelujah somebody. But brothers, John
[1:01:53] said, I wept. Amen. Because why? That
[1:01:57] was a bad news. Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:02:01] John said, "I wept." But the prophet
[1:02:03] said he didn't weep for a long time. For
[1:02:06] one of the elders, he said, "Weep not,
[1:02:09] John, for the land of the tribe of
[1:02:11] Judah." Hallelujah. He has prevailed to
[1:02:15] take the book and to lose the seven
[1:02:18] thereof. Hallelujah. And the John said
[1:02:20] and I turned to say the lion of the
[1:02:23] tribe of Judah but lo in the midst of
[1:02:25] the truth was the bleeding lamb.
[1:02:28] Hallelujah. There he is stand the
[1:02:31] bleeding lamb. There he is tonight our
[1:02:34] mediator. There he is tonight our
[1:02:37] intercessor. There is it tonight our
[1:02:40] redeemer. There is it tonight our
[1:02:42] sacrifice. There is it tonight our
[1:02:45] pardon. Hallelujah.
[1:02:47] Oh my good news.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And John said there was a jubilee
[1:02:54] thereafter.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Weep not John. Amen. And all of a sudden
[1:03:03] the weeping turned into joy.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Abraham told us in the
[1:03:10] message
[1:03:12] a man running away from the presence of
[1:03:14] God. He said, "I believe I am
[1:03:18] prophesying."
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Great joy
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; lays ahead." That's right.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And many saddened heart will be turned
[1:03:28] into joy.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brothers, I believe that
[1:03:34] God is unveiling his word in this last
[1:03:37] days. Great things will be happening in
[1:03:39] the midst of the church. But we are the
[1:03:41] beneficiary of the prophecy of the
[1:03:44] spoken word. Hallelujah. We are not just
[1:03:47] looking for it. It's already here with
[1:03:50] us. The word is here. The word is mighty
[1:03:53] even in thy mouth. Hallelujah. We have
[1:03:57] it right here to turn our sudden heart
[1:04:01] onto joy. Hallelujah. And no wonder
[1:04:04] there was a great jubilee in heaven. And
[1:04:06] they started, you know, to jubilate.
[1:04:08] They started to worship. Hallelujah. It
[1:04:11] was a great time. Oh brother and
[1:04:14] brothers, I want to tell you tonight,
[1:04:17] you have nothing to weep about.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Whip not John.
[1:04:23] Whip not brother. Weep not sister. That
[1:04:26] doctor's report, hallelujah, is not your
[1:04:30] death certificate. Whip not brother.
[1:04:33] Whip not John. The doctor was only
[1:04:36] basing it upon what he study in the
[1:04:38] school and that was according to the
[1:04:41] medical book. But brother, we have the
[1:04:44] book of the great scientist, the book of
[1:04:47] the great physician that says by my
[1:04:51] stripes you were healed. Not that you
[1:04:54] shall be healed, you were healed
[1:04:56] already. Whip no brother, whip no
[1:04:59] sister. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:05:07] whip notep.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I bring to you tonight
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; the glad tidings of great joy.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Whip not at the doctor's report.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Whip not.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; You just got to take God at his word and
[1:05:27] only believe.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Only.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Just as we are closing tonight.
[1:05:32] Hallelujah.
[1:05:34] We have the four synotic gospel Matthew,
[1:05:38] Mark, Luke and John. Now all these four
[1:05:42] gospel they are gospelers.
[1:05:46] They are not the gospel.
[1:05:49] They are synopsis.
[1:05:52] They are the abstract.
[1:05:55] The book written about the gospel
[1:05:58] itself. The gospel himself is the Lord
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:04] They are writers.
[1:06:06] They are gospelers.
[1:06:08] And that's why you know they can present
[1:06:11] him the way they saw him for they were
[1:06:14] placed at different angle to look at the
[1:06:17] same object from different angle. And
[1:06:19] the Matthew can say he was the king and
[1:06:23] you know Mark can say he was the
[1:06:24] sacrifice. Then you know Luke and say
[1:06:27] he's the son of man the prophet. But
[1:06:29] brother when he comes you know to John
[1:06:31] John look at him and he said this is
[1:06:33] deity.
[1:06:35] This is God in human flesh.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; This is the word that was in the
[1:06:39] beginning with God which was God himself
[1:06:41] but now made flesh to dwell among us.
[1:06:44] Are you hearing me tonight? And brothers
[1:06:47] that was what they saw. And those are
[1:06:50] the four different anointing that went
[1:06:53] forth in every generation. And that
[1:06:56] anointing you know went forth down from
[1:06:59] the Hisian church to this Leician
[1:07:01] church. And then we are right here now
[1:07:04] in this Leician age. And the this
[1:07:06] Leician age there was an Exodus which
[1:07:09] was the bride. For the prophet of the
[1:07:11] almighty God says you know that the
[1:07:13] Leodian church they are the Pentecostals
[1:07:16] and the Pentecostal they do not live
[1:07:18] under the anointing of the age but they
[1:07:20] are living under the anointing are you
[1:07:22] hearing me now of the past age but
[1:07:25] brother we have the anointing of the
[1:07:27] eagle right here which worked upon John
[1:07:31] and that's why John was caught up and he
[1:07:33] can see so many thing amen because he
[1:07:36] was living under such an anointing and
[1:07:39] tonight Brother, we have the same
[1:07:41] anointing
[1:07:43] upon us that was upon them back then.
[1:07:47] Hallelujah. Is working right now in the
[1:07:50] midst of the church to bring Christ the
[1:07:53] gospel before us. Hallelujah. Deity.
[1:07:56] Brother Abraham said deity is not in
[1:07:59] heaven. He said deity is in you. It is
[1:08:03] Christ in you. Christ in me. The hope of
[1:08:06] glory. Hallelujah. That's the reason why
[1:08:09] the message of the hour is all about
[1:08:12] Christ.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; The message is not about the prophet.
[1:08:16] The message is not about bra tabernacle.
[1:08:19] The message is not about literal life
[1:08:21] church. The message is not about Shakana
[1:08:23] tabernacle in Nigeria. The message is
[1:08:26] about Christ.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; For hallelujah, when it shall begin to
[1:08:32] sound, the mystery of God shall be
[1:08:35] finished. And Christ is the mystery of
[1:08:38] God revealed. Hallelujah. And the
[1:08:41] Christ, amen, is not in heaven.
[1:08:45] His deity revealed. And that that deity
[1:08:49] is not in heaven. Brother, that deity is
[1:08:52] in your
[1:08:53] prophet said that deity will be revealed
[1:08:56] in man bringing to pass the thought of
[1:09:00] their heart. The thought of human flesh.
[1:09:04] Your thought, my thought. Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] It's not me bringing it to pass. It's
[1:09:08] not you bringing it to pass, but God
[1:09:11] himself.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; That endures you by the power of the
[1:09:16] Holy Spirit is bringing to pass what he
[1:09:19] had in his mind. Hallelujah. Before the
[1:09:23] foundation of the world. Oh brother, we
[1:09:26] are good messenger of good news.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] And brother Abraham said
[1:09:36] he said
[1:09:38] a messenger.
[1:09:40] He said you are a messenger this
[1:09:42] morning. You are a messenger. In the
[1:09:45] message Hebrews he said you are a
[1:09:47] messenger of good news or a messenger of
[1:09:52] bad news.
[1:09:54] He said, "Isn't it beautiful to know
[1:09:57] that we are ambassadors, that we are
[1:09:59] angels, the messenger of the
[1:10:01] resurrection, and we are God's messenger
[1:10:04] to the sinful world, that Christ lives."
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. In our heart, he lives in our
[1:10:12] spirit. He lives and he bring us
[1:10:16] from the Lord the bachelor life of sin
[1:10:20] and exalt us up and gives us a
[1:10:23] hallelujah in our soul and make us a new
[1:10:27] creation.
[1:10:29] We are messenger angels of the covenant.
[1:10:33] How wonderful. Hallelujah. Oh, praise
[1:10:36] the Lord. And I ask you tonight,
[1:10:40] are you a messenger of good news or bad
[1:10:42] news?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Which messenger are you?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; A messenger of good news or bad news.
[1:10:54] Because brother Abraham said, you are
[1:10:55] either a messenger of good news or a
[1:10:57] messenger of bad news.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; But brother, we are messengers of good
[1:11:02] news. Messenger of the covenant. the
[1:11:04] covenant, the new testament, which is
[1:11:07] Christ himself. Hallelujah. With all his
[1:11:10] power, with his redemptive blessing.
[1:11:13] Hallelujah. As Jehovah Rafa, as Jehovah
[1:11:16] jury, Jehovah, at Jehovah Rah.
[1:11:19] Hallelujah. Oh brother, it's Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ. Jehovah Shalom, our peace.
[1:11:25] Hallelujah. Our healing, our life, our
[1:11:28] redeemer, our shepherd. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:11:32] brother, we are good news of these
[1:11:33] things. Jesus Christ turned around to
[1:11:35] the disciples and says, "You are
[1:11:37] witnesses of these things."
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what we should be tonight.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Witnesses
[1:11:46] of his power, of his resurrection.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And how can you witness that unless you
[1:11:52] possess him in you? Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; That's why you know when those 10 spies
[1:11:57] were sent forth
[1:11:59] to where to spy the land the land of
[1:12:03] promise
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; 10 of them they came back
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; with bad news
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; bad report
[1:12:11] but two of them
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Caleb and Joshua they return with good
[1:12:16] news
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; g
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; those 10 spies bad number they said we
[1:12:24] are like grasshopper.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; There are giants in the land. We are too
[1:12:30] small. We cannot take it. But Caleb and
[1:12:33] Joshua said, "We are more than able
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; to take the land."
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us go all at once
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and possess the land for we are more
[1:12:44] than able." That was the testimony
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; of the two witnesses which are the true
[1:12:50] witnesses. The true messenger, the
[1:12:54] messenger of good news. Hallelujah. And
[1:12:58] the length is ours. Are you hearing me
[1:13:01] tonight? That land is the land that God
[1:13:04] has promised which is ours. And how do
[1:13:07] we enter into the land? By one spirit.
[1:13:09] We are all baptized into the land of
[1:13:12] good news into Christ. Are you hearing
[1:13:15] me now? Oh brothers and there are two
[1:13:18] messenger Caleb and Joshua that made it
[1:13:22] brother with testimony before the people
[1:13:24] and they are the one that can say we are
[1:13:27] more than able. Are you hearing me
[1:13:29] tonight? And brother Abraham said that
[1:13:32] Caleb is a type of the believer and the
[1:13:34] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:36] Hallelujah. And brother it will be you
[1:13:39] and the Holy Ghost that will take the
[1:13:42] land tonight. It is you and the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost that will possess the blessing
[1:13:46] tonight. It is you and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] that will receive, hallelujah, all the
[1:13:51] promises that are in the book tonight.
[1:13:53] Nobody will be able to do that. But it
[1:13:55] will take you and the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah. For that is our message.
[1:14:00] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you live in.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Caleb and Joshua, the believer and the
[1:14:16] Holy Ghost is an atmosphere that you
[1:14:19] live in.
[1:14:22] Like that little lady
[1:14:25] in Syria,
[1:14:27] she was living in the atmosphere.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere of the supernatural.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; She has seen it all. Amen. And she was
[1:14:36] living in there. The prophet said that
[1:14:39] lady probably you know she has never
[1:14:42] seen Elisha healed a leper.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; But friends she believed
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; that all things are possible. It's an
[1:14:52] atmosphere
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; that she was living in the atmosphere of
[1:14:56] the Holy Ghost. Caleb and Joshua the
[1:14:59] atmosphere of possibility.
[1:15:02] Are you hearing me tonight? And we got
[1:15:04] to live under the atmosphere of
[1:15:07] possibility. And then you know all of a
[1:15:09] sudden in the land of our captivity
[1:15:12] where tonight we are living now in the
[1:15:15] land of our captivity. Is that right?
[1:15:18] That's where we live. This earth is not
[1:15:20] our home. Is a werness of is a
[1:15:23] wilderness of hallelujah. We are
[1:15:26] pilgrims and we are strangers. But
[1:15:28] brother, while we are here, we can live
[1:15:30] in heaven on earth with testimonies and
[1:15:34] of good news. Hallelujah. From head to
[1:15:37] glory. Amen. From this earth until
[1:15:41] rapture, praise the Lord.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And brothers, she said, who my lord
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; non were with the prophet in Samaria,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; he would have just recovered of his
[1:15:56] leprosy. Yes. Yes.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. And Nema was a great man.
[1:16:05] He was the captain of the Syrian army.
[1:16:08] Miracles or deliverance has been wrought
[1:16:11] through him. But the Bible says but he
[1:16:14] was a leper. And brother said leprosy
[1:16:19] is contacted through diet. I mean wrong
[1:16:22] diet. M
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; is a wrong diet brings leprosy
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; and that's the situation of the world
[1:16:31] today. The situation of the church
[1:16:33] today, the situation of Leician church
[1:16:36] tonight is leprosy. The Pentecostal
[1:16:39] church is dominated by the sin of
[1:16:43] leprosy, by sickness of leprosy.
[1:16:46] Everywhere leprosy, unbelief is a
[1:16:49] disease. And that's the reason why
[1:16:51] tonight you cannot carry Pentecostalism
[1:16:54] into this message because leprosy.
[1:16:58] Hallelujah. We don't want it brother. We
[1:17:02] have been given the word of God. When
[1:17:04] you don't have the right diet, you will
[1:17:06] have leprosy. But brother, the word has
[1:17:09] been open.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The sins has been opened. The word has
[1:17:13] been born into existence, vindicated in
[1:17:16] his full strength. We have balanced diet
[1:17:20] revealed unto us is set on the table.
[1:17:23] For Jesus has a tablesp
[1:17:26] where we can all pay. Hallelujah. We can
[1:17:30] feed our soul. Tonight on Jesus table,
[1:17:34] he satisfied the hungry all the time.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah. No wonder the angel said,
[1:17:40] "John, go and take the little book and
[1:17:43] he the little book." Hallelujah. So that
[1:17:46] John can become the word for thou must
[1:17:49] prophesy again. And brother, the book
[1:17:52] that has been opened tonight has been
[1:17:54] revealed unto us is our diet.
[1:17:58] We are feasting upon the book. We are
[1:18:00] feasting upon the word. We are feasting
[1:18:02] upon the revelation. Hallelujah. Of the
[1:18:05] word of God. We are not feisting upon
[1:18:07] creed,
[1:18:09] upon dogmas, upon tradition.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We are feasting upon the unfailing body
[1:18:15] word of the son of man.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; For where the cases,
[1:18:23] there are the eagles be gathered. Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; We are feisting upon the word.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; No leprosy.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; We are getting bigger all the time,
[1:18:33] getting stronger all the time. And
[1:18:35] that's why we can have testimonies,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; testimonies
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; of possibilities.
[1:18:43] And when Neymar had it went to the king
[1:18:46] of Syria and the king of Syria wrote a
[1:18:48] letter, give it to the king of Israel
[1:18:51] when you get there. And brothers, he was
[1:18:55] taken a roundabout.
[1:18:57] But that lady, the prophet said, did not
[1:18:59] talk about the king, the political
[1:19:01] leader. But he only talked about the
[1:19:04] prophet.
[1:19:06] Amen. She was talking about the prophet.
[1:19:10] She was not talking about who? About the
[1:19:12] king, about political leader. And
[1:19:14] brothers and sister, this bride of Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ and the prophet and the spirit.
[1:19:21] The prophet said they will be saying the
[1:19:23] same thing. We are not preaching
[1:19:25] politics. We are not preaching
[1:19:27] economics. We are not preaching
[1:19:28] prosperity. We are not preaching worldly
[1:19:31] worldliness. We are not preaching
[1:19:33] materialism. We are preaching about
[1:19:35] Jesus Christ. He is our message. He is
[1:19:38] our gospel. Jesus Christ the same
[1:19:41] yesterday, today and forever. That is
[1:19:44] our gospel. That is our message. And we
[1:19:47] are standing on that. Hallelujah. And
[1:19:50] he's changing not from glory to glory.
[1:19:52] Hallelujah. He's the same tonight. The
[1:19:55] same way he was then, he's the same
[1:19:57] right here.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; That's what we are preaching. Yes.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And the king
[1:20:07] took his garment when he read a letter
[1:20:10] and he tore it and he said, "Are my God
[1:20:16] that I should make leaf or that I should
[1:20:19] I should kill."
[1:20:21] Luke is seeking quarry.
[1:20:24] The king thought the days of miracles
[1:20:27] were over. But when the Elijah Elishah
[1:20:30] the prophet had said bring him here and
[1:20:33] he shall know that there's a king in
[1:20:34] Israel, there is a God in Israel.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah. And then when Nan got there,
[1:20:42] Elijah the prophet did not even come
[1:20:44] out. He has no business to come out
[1:20:48] because he was engaged in his presence.
[1:20:51] He told one of the messenger, one of the
[1:20:54] servant, he said, "Go and tell him to
[1:20:57] wash in Jordan seven times." And that's
[1:21:00] all.
[1:21:02] And the messenger came out and stood
[1:21:06] before Captain Neymar. I said, "Captain
[1:21:09] sir, the prophet said, the prophet said,
[1:21:13] the prophet said,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; the prophet said,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; the prophet said, the prophecy."
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. How many of you believe with
[1:21:21] me tonight? Amen. The prophet said, and
[1:21:25] that's why we are here tonight to tell
[1:21:26] you the prophecy. The prophecy. The
[1:21:29] prophecy. The prophecy. You believe the
[1:21:32] message? I don't have any message of my
[1:21:34] own, but the prophecy. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:21:38] praise the Lord. The prophet said, the
[1:21:40] prophet said, the prophet said, but
[1:21:42] Abraham said in every age, he said God
[1:21:45] does not just only raise up messenger
[1:21:47] for the generation, he said, but God
[1:21:49] raise up wonderful helpers.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said God will raise up
[1:21:57] young men that will carry this message
[1:21:59] and preach it in a more powerful way
[1:22:02] than it is now. Hallelujah. God's
[1:22:05] prophet ordained 5
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; to carry this message. Amen. Brother
[1:22:11] Abraham told us God raise up faithful
[1:22:13] men. Hallelujah. And Apostle Paul, he
[1:22:16] places those faithful men to pastor
[1:22:19] those churches. Hallelujah. And that's
[1:22:21] the work of the five tonight. The work
[1:22:24] of the five tonight, they can play, but
[1:22:27] they can preach as well because they
[1:22:30] will only say what the message say. They
[1:22:32] will only say what the prophet say. That
[1:22:35] is, you know, their job. They will enter
[1:22:37] into the realms of God. They will be
[1:22:40] anointed with the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah. And they will continue to
[1:22:44] say the same thing
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; that the prophet has said.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm here tonight,
[1:22:52] brother, to tell you the prophet said.
[1:22:55] The prophet said, the prophet said, Oh,
[1:22:58] praise the Lord. You believe the message
[1:23:01] tonight?
[1:23:04] Oh, praise God.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; And non misunderstood supernatural
[1:23:10] and he was rot and he started to leave
[1:23:15] and he was going. But one of the boys
[1:23:18] said, "Captain sir,
[1:23:23] if you said habaner and and vaper
[1:23:27] are better than the waters of Damascus,
[1:23:32] You want to keep your leprosy
[1:23:37] and if you want to keep your leprosy you
[1:23:38] can go ahead
[1:23:40] captain sir if that prophet told you
[1:23:44] something higher
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; or heavier
[1:23:48] you know something greater than what he
[1:23:50] told you wouldn't you do it
[1:23:54] then he thought
[1:23:56] let me give it a try and he went down to
[1:24:00] river Jordan. The prophet said he went
[1:24:02] down tiptoeing
[1:24:07] and when he got in the river, he ducked
[1:24:12] inside Jordan. The first time the
[1:24:15] prophet said seven times.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Second time
[1:24:21] is dirty water.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; The third time
[1:24:27] some bubbles. It doesn't want it because
[1:24:30] it was daring
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; but brother seven times
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; seven times
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; seven completion
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; brothers
[1:24:43] and I want to tell you tonight full
[1:24:46] obedience
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; to the word
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; total obedience to the word complete
[1:24:56] obedience to the word Yes.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will give you your
[1:25:01] blessing.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Jordan means death.
[1:25:09] Seven means completion.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Perfect. You must perfectly die
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; to that idea
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; that there is something better.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Than the message of the prophet.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Habana and vapa. The waters of Damascus
[1:25:28] are better.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You must die to that idea.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; You must let that idea die. Perish.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Die to your superstitions.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Die to your unbelief.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Die to creed and dogmas.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; To whatever you have ever cherished in
[1:25:50] life. You got to die to it.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You must submit yourself. Apostle Paul
[1:25:56] says I die daily. There are a lot of
[1:25:59] things brothers you know we God will die
[1:26:01] to them. That's why we don't see God is
[1:26:04] because we are misunderstanding
[1:26:06] supernatural. We are trying you know to
[1:26:09] you know to to to to to bring in things
[1:26:13] you know that are not part of the
[1:26:15] message.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Things that are not what the prophet
[1:26:19] said. We are trying to esport them.
[1:26:23] press things into the revival into the
[1:26:27] gospel of the bride. But Abraham said
[1:26:30] the prophet, the spirit and the bride,
[1:26:34] they'll be saying the same thing.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; And brother, we got to say it now. We
[1:26:41] got to die.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And the when the man die completely to
[1:26:46] everything, are you hearing me in
[1:26:48] church? Then his flesh became like that
[1:26:51] of a little baby. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:26:54] And we serve the same God tonight. If
[1:26:57] that God can give nan good earth, good
[1:27:01] body, new body. Amen. It's the same God
[1:27:03] that we are serving tonight. If we can
[1:27:05] die to unbelief, die to Christ and
[1:27:07] dogmas and our own ideas. Amen. Church,
[1:27:11] we can receive our desire tonight. Amen.
[1:27:14] That same God that gave n man good body
[1:27:20] flesh like that of a little baby. He can
[1:27:22] give you the healing. Hallelujah. God
[1:27:25] gave you know a boy one time in the
[1:27:27] ministry of the prophet a new set of
[1:27:30] lung. We are living we are serving the
[1:27:32] same God tonight. He can give you a new
[1:27:34] set of lung. He can give you a new set
[1:27:37] of kidney. It can give you a new set of
[1:27:39] pancrea. It can give you a new heart. He
[1:27:42] can give you a new body, a new fresh.
[1:27:45] Hallelujah. He can give you your sight.
[1:27:48] He's the same God that we are serving
[1:27:51] tonight. How many of you believe with
[1:27:53] me? God bless you. God bless you,
[1:27:55] pastor.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[1:28:13] God bless you, brother.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I said I feel inspired by that story of
[1:28:25] non tonight and uh I could go ahead and
[1:28:28] preach on with it a little bit more, but
[1:28:29] I'll hold it till Sunday. I think I I
[1:28:31] got I think I got my service for Sunday.
[1:28:34] Praise be to God. How many can say amen?
[1:28:37] And if you didn't say it during the
[1:28:38] sermon, go ahead and say it now if you
[1:28:40] agree.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh to have a window
[1:28:44] into the word the way that we have it
[1:28:46] through our brother tonight and all the
[1:28:48] services we hear. It's a window to see
[1:28:50] what we were before the fall to see the
[1:28:53] the the what Adam was in the image of
[1:28:55] God, what he did, what he acted like.
[1:28:58] And we think, "Oh, that's just so far
[1:28:59] above us." But Calvar's to restore us
[1:29:02] back to everything that lost. Whether
[1:29:04] you feel like that tonight or not, it's
[1:29:06] what the word says. It's what Calvary
[1:29:08] did. It's to bring us back as sons of
[1:29:11] God back to that position again where
[1:29:13] things aren't controlling us, but we're
[1:29:15] controlling things. And I think it was a
[1:29:17] rich word tonight. We are blessed. You
[1:29:19] can't put a price tag on what you heard,
[1:29:21] your heart heard tonight. Can you say
[1:29:23] amen?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And we should rejoice in the Lord.
[1:29:25] Praise be to God. And Gideon, both the
[1:29:28] Gideonss working under the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] tonight, what did he sing? We can create
[1:29:32] an atmosphere.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what he preached tonight. We
[1:29:36] create an atmosphere. We have the power
[1:29:38] to do it. Even living in that little
[1:29:40] servant girl, living there with non. And
[1:29:43] she's just she's in captivity. She's not
[1:29:45] in the right place, but she's being a
[1:29:47] light. She's being a testimony. And
[1:29:49] she's saying, "There's a prophet in the
[1:29:51] land. If you go see him, you can be
[1:29:53] healed of that leprosy. We're lights in
[1:29:55] this dark world." Can you say amen? And
[1:29:58] in captivity, she could create her own
[1:30:00] atmosphere by testifying in a bad job.
[1:30:03] In a Can you say amen? In a atmosphere
[1:30:06] work that's just perverted. It doesn't
[1:30:09] matter. Lord, help me to create my own
[1:30:10] atmosphere here. How many believe you
[1:30:12] can do it?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what our sister
[1:30:14] Rebecca's song said, too. Praise the
[1:30:16] Lord that we can create that atmosphere.
[1:30:19] We believe it. Father, we thank you for
[1:30:21] this precious word tonight. Lord, we are
[1:30:23] grateful every time the word is broken,
[1:30:26] the bread is broken to us this way. And
[1:30:28] Lord, we find, how is it, Lord, that a
[1:30:30] brother across the other side of the
[1:30:32] world, Lord, can come and find a kindred
[1:30:36] spirit, find something that registers in
[1:30:38] our hearts and our souls, it's because
[1:30:40] Lord, the same message, the same Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost is teaching him is the same one
[1:30:45] that's teaching us. And Lord, we can
[1:30:47] say, "Amen. We can our hearts can
[1:30:48] rejoice in it at a revival because Lord,
[1:30:51] we know that Father, this isn't a work
[1:30:54] of man. This isn't a political work.
[1:30:55] This isn't a work of man at all. This is
[1:30:59] your word, Father. And we stand upon
[1:31:01] that foundation. Bless us and help us
[1:31:03] tonight, Lord, as we worship and sing
[1:31:05] together and just pour praises upon this
[1:31:08] word. That's what our prophet said. You
[1:31:10] just just water this word with our
[1:31:12] praise. And as we do that, Father, I
[1:31:15] pray it bring forth a crop in our lives.
[1:31:17] Bless and help and strengthen your
[1:31:19] people, we pray. And bless our brother
[1:31:21] and his journey and his ministry in
[1:31:23] Nigeria. He has blessed our church. He
[1:31:25] has put a blessing on our elders. He has
[1:31:27] put a blessing on this. He said so many
[1:31:30] things. Lord, may you bless brother
[1:31:32] Gideon's ministry back home. May you
[1:31:34] bless the church, not just the building,
[1:31:36] but the people. May you give him souls.
[1:31:39] Lord, may there just be a great work of
[1:31:41] God continue on there and put your hand
[1:31:44] over his life. We pray as we give it all
[1:31:47] to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Your
[1:31:52] truth is what I follow.
[1:31:55] It'll still be true tomorrow.
[1:31:59] What I believe is not the work of any
[1:32:03] man.
[1:32:07] His kingdom can be shaken
[1:32:11] on this glorious foundation.
[1:32:14] While others fall,
[1:32:18] here I stand. Your truth is what I
[1:32:21] follow. Oh, your truth is what I follow.
[1:32:27] It'll still be true tomorrow.
[1:32:31] What I believe is not the word of any
[1:32:35] man.
[1:32:38] Oh, his kingdom can be shaken
[1:32:43] on this glorious foundation while others
[1:32:47] fall. Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] Here I stand.
[1:32:54] Why do they leave?
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:32:58] Isn't this message still the same? Why
[1:33:02] do they see? Think about it.
[1:33:06] for something more than simplicity.
[1:33:10] Why do they turn
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:14] turn their backs on you, oh Lord? Why do
[1:33:18] they
[1:33:22] for something more?
[1:33:26] Your truth is what I follow.
[1:33:30] It'll still be true tomorrow.
[1:33:34] But I won't worship the Lord tonight.
[1:33:36] Why don't you take take time and worship
[1:33:38] the Lord? Why are your praises upon this
[1:33:41] word? His kingdom can't be shaken
[1:33:46] on this glorious foundation. While
[1:33:49] others fall,
[1:33:53] here I stand.
[1:33:57] I know you stand.
[1:33:59] Think about it now. There's a great
[1:34:03] falling away. I know they try
[1:34:09] to complicate what you say, but in my
[1:34:13] soul.
[1:34:16] I'm sure of the rock I stand upon. One
[1:34:20] thing I know. Oh, say it tonight. I will
[1:34:25] press on.
[1:34:28] Why? Your truth is what I follow. Oh,
[1:34:33] it'll still be true tomorrow.
[1:34:37] What I believe is not the work of any.
[1:34:43] Oh, his kingdom can't be shaken.
[1:34:49] All this glorious hour,
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:56] here I stand.
[1:34:59] Oh yeah, let's sing it. Oh, on Christ
[1:35:03] the side
[1:35:05] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:35:11] seeking.
[1:35:14] All of the ground is sinking.
[1:35:20] Bring that second verse up again. I just
[1:35:22] want to I know you said there's a great
[1:35:25] falling away. How many know the Bible
[1:35:26] says that there'll be a great falling
[1:35:28] away? And
[1:35:31] it's not that they would maybe go
[1:35:33] completely out, but it's a slow fading
[1:35:37] away from being close to the Lord.
[1:35:39] Sometimes it's a slow fading away.
[1:35:41] Friends, let's not let that happen.
[1:35:43] Let's keep the spirit of revival in our
[1:35:45] hearts. Don't don't get distant from
[1:35:47] him. It's too late for that. Don't let
[1:35:49] the busyiness of life Can you say amen?
[1:35:52] Don't let the busyiness of life, don't
[1:35:54] let the trial, don't let the depression
[1:35:56] take you over. Oh, say, I know I'm not
[1:35:58] going to be a part of that group that
[1:36:00] falls away. I know they try to
[1:36:02] complicate what you say, but in my soul,
[1:36:05] in my soul,
[1:36:08] I'm sure of the rock I stand upon.
[1:36:14] I will press. I will press on. Singing
[1:36:19] now
[1:36:21] your truth. Tell the Lord tonight. Oh,
[1:36:25] it'll still be true tomorrow.
[1:36:29] What I believe is not the work of any
[1:36:33] man
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:39] can be shar.
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:50] Let's give our Lord praise just for your
[1:36:52] praise. Wallow the word with your praise
[1:36:54] tonight. Oh God,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; May it bring forth fruit we pray in
[1:36:59] Jesus name. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:37:01] you tonight. I want you to in the back

[1:37:11] there that we'll sing as we go. Good
[1:37:14] news. You guys have that any songs in
[1:37:17] there you don't think there is? I know
[1:37:21] about three of them, but they must not
[1:37:22] be in there.

[1:37:27] those put in. God bless you tonight. K

[1:37:32] bloodwash band. Praise the Lord. And I'm

[1:37:38] gospel of Jesus Christ. You can be a
[1:37:40] bearer of bad news. You can be a bearer
[1:37:42] of good news. I want to be like that
[1:37:44] little servant girl that brings good
[1:37:46] news in a depressed atmosphere. Praise
