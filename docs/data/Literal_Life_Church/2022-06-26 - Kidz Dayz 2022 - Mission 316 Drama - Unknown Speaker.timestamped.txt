[31:21] [Applause]
[31:23] foreign
[31:24] [Music]
[31:33] [Music]
[31:51] you must uh you must be Celeste
[31:55] sit down and act natural
[31:57] congratulations over the miles you've
[32:00] been chosen for a mission
[32:02] yes oh really
[32:04] um what what oh sorry one mission
[32:09] agent Morris you've been chosen by the
[32:12] chief director himself for mission 316.
[32:16] this Mission should you choose to accept
[32:18] it we'll require you travel to the four
[32:21] corners of the world and find four
[32:23] hand-picked special agent recruits
[32:26] must return this formula before the
[32:28] ending forces get enough
[32:31] um wait enemy forces what are you
[32:35] talking about
[32:37] um
[32:37] I didn't know this was going to be
[32:39] dangerous
[32:40] agent miles it is perfectly normal to be
[32:43] nervous on your first mission but God
[32:46] will be with you
[32:47] the chief director would like you to
[32:49] share this formula for the new recruits
[32:51] and then get them back to headquarters
[32:52] so then they begin their training as
[32:54] soon as possible
[32:55] even though this is your first mission
[32:57] it is critical and essential to the
[33:00] future of the world
[33:02] this is a life or death matter this
[33:05] Mission success could mean the
[33:07] transformation of the world as we know
[33:10] it here look at this I think about the
[33:13] content of the formula to be quite
[33:14] surprising
[33:16] top secret
[33:22] whoa
[33:25] am uh am I reading that right the only
[33:29] content in the formula this says l-o-v-e
[33:34] love love yes that's correct but it's
[33:39] not just any kind of love
[33:40] it's a special kind it's the only thing
[33:43] that can save us it brings eternal life
[33:46] to those who choose to receive it
[33:48] [Music]
[33:50] um so that means we have a choice
[33:52] miles God is not a bully he gives his
[33:57] love freely to save us but it is our
[34:00] choice whether or not we want to accept
[34:02] the formula
[34:03] there is however a man named Dr Diablo
[34:06] who is a bully he's been sabotaging our
[34:10] efforts and no doubt that causing
[34:12] trouble among the new recruits he has a
[34:15] few dead beats to send me here's a few
[34:18] dead beats he sends out to do his dirty
[34:20] work but the formula in this Caster will
[34:23] help you reach the neighborhoods
[34:25] see
[34:26] Dr Diablo has produced many different
[34:29] kinds of love as a substitute for God's
[34:32] love but he's never been able to come up
[34:35] with anything quite like the love of God
[34:38] so that's why this formula is so special
[34:41] yes see this kind of love was so
[34:45] powerful that it caused God to risk his
[34:48] own son's life on a Mission of Hope for
[34:51] the entire world
[34:53] for God so loved the world that he gave
[34:55] his only begotten son and whosoever
[34:57] believeth in him should not perish but
[35:00] have everlasting life
[35:02] so wait what you're saying is this
[35:05] mission
[35:06] this goes all the way back to God yes
[35:09] and this formula has also withstood the
[35:13] test of time
[35:14] you will start to see the changes that
[35:16] the formula will create in the lives of
[35:18] the recruits as soon as you share it
[35:20] with them their countenances they will
[35:22] change they will find themselves with
[35:24] more strength to overcome the enemy and
[35:27] they will find themselves loving others
[35:29] the way Christ loved them
[35:32] dude are you hearing this we better get
[35:36] back and tell Dr right away
[35:40] it's away
[35:42] this is a pretty big mission
[35:45] um are you sure I'm the man for the job
[35:50] deep director is never wrong about who
[35:53] he chooses miles if he has chosen you
[35:55] you can know with confidence that this
[35:59] this is what you are called to do and he
[36:03] will give you everything you need to be
[36:05] successful on your mission
[36:07] everything including
[36:10] this formula yes
[36:15] [Music]

[39:34] out there in the world it's hard to tell
[39:36] if something is real and sometimes we
[39:39] get confused just remember that God is
[39:42] not the author of confusion he wants to

[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:48] foreign
[1:24:09] you see agent miles took a special
[1:24:12] formula with him which means Dr Diablo
[1:24:15] now has the formula for himself
[1:24:17] we've also received Intel that Dr Diablo
[1:24:19] plans to dilute the formula and render
[1:24:21] it powerless
[1:24:23] but we know that the machine Emmanuel
[1:24:24] says that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:24:26] flood the spirit of the Lord raises up a
[1:24:29] standard against him and it also says if
[1:24:32] we resist the devil he will flee from us
[1:24:35] and so agents what shall live inside of
[1:24:37] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:24:40] against us he that spared not his own
[1:24:43] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:24:45] shall he not freely give us all things
[1:24:48] Romans 8 30 verses who shouts are Brutus
[1:24:51] from the love of Christ shall
[1:24:53] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:24:55] of famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:24:58] nay and all these things we are more
[1:25:00] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:25:03] it for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:25:05] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:25:08] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:25:11] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:25:15] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:25:17] us from the love of God which is in
[1:25:19] Christ Jesus our lord
[1:25:24] who shall separate us
[1:25:27] from the love of Christ
[1:25:29] [Music]

[1:27:59] I'm going to change the formula and
[1:28:01] dilute it

[1:28:04] but it won't have any power and
[1:28:09] the only reason I'm telling you this is
[1:28:12] because you won't be around to see the
[1:28:14] devastating effects I will cause all the
[1:28:18] entire world

[1:28:24] you
[1:28:24] you have nothing
[1:28:27] that's not true Diablo I have the pure
[1:28:31] formula within my heart and you know
[1:28:34] what I've been sharing it with recruits
[1:28:36] all around the world
[1:28:37] you will never stop us from sharing the
[1:28:40] love of God
[1:28:41] and with that you will never stop the
[1:28:44] formula we'll see about that
[1:28:48] but I'm just staring at you fools let's
[1:28:50] open the canister out with it

[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:05] served I have one concern the secret
[1:35:08] formula
[1:35:09] it was with agent miles
[1:35:11] the secret formula with Dr Diablo that
[1:35:14] is no concern because the enemy is
[1:35:17] unable to put it into action for it only
[1:35:21] works on those who have faith that is no
[1:35:25] concern
[1:35:26] now
[1:35:28] purpose of the mission from which you
[1:35:31] have just returned yes sir what is it
[1:35:35] for God so loved the world
[1:35:40] that whosoever believeth on him
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:55] but
[1:35:58] but have
[1:35:59] everlasting life
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:09] foreign
[1:36:10] yes that is true but do you know what
[1:36:13] that means
[1:36:16] do you know what that means
[1:36:19] for God so loved the world
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:25] so loved the world
[1:36:28] that he wanted to share his love with
[1:36:32] the world
[1:36:33] and the only way for God to do that
[1:36:38] of Heaven come to Earth be born on the
[1:36:42] manger in Jesus Christ
[1:36:46] and wherever Jesus Christ went
[1:36:50] preaching healings followed Miracles
[1:36:54] followed Deliverance is followed the
[1:36:57] force of Darkness were pushed back
[1:37:00] many were drawn to him
[1:37:03] who for many years had carried their
[1:37:06] sorrows had carried their own burdens
[1:37:08] their pains in their heart their
[1:37:11] disappointments and they came
[1:37:16] these men and women who came to him they
[1:37:19] became his disciples what we would call
[1:37:21] today in our drama they became his
[1:37:24] special agents
[1:37:25] and you know what
[1:37:27] Jesus Christ is still looking for
[1:37:30] disciples today
[1:37:33] still today now today we've talked about
[1:37:37] a special formula and I want to
[1:37:40] introduce you to
[1:37:42] most sacred formula there has ever been
[1:37:46] and that is the formula of God's love
[1:37:49] where crew 3 come forward
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:37:57] here we have
[1:38:00] and this bottle
[1:38:03] purplish liquid
[1:38:05] this represents the sin in each one of
[1:38:09] our hearts
[1:38:10] if we were to take that liquid and pour
[1:38:12] it over my white shirt it would stain
[1:38:15] terribly we couldn't get that out
[1:38:17] that is exactly what sin does in our
[1:38:20] hearts but we have sin in our hearts
[1:38:23] we're miserable we're angry we're
[1:38:25] frustrated we have pain we cause pain
[1:38:28] and God never created us
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:33] inhabitors of sin to be the Tabernacles
[1:38:36] of sin God created us to be the
[1:38:38] Tabernacle of his presence but that's
[1:38:41] how we're born
[1:38:43] how can we
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:46] hives we try many ways to overcome it in
[1:38:49] our own strength but how can
[1:38:51] it
[1:38:52] if we have our hearts closed the sacred
[1:38:55] formula being in church being in the
[1:38:57] right situation I could pour it on there
[1:38:59] and it does absolutely nothing I have
[1:39:02] the right formula of the love of God but
[1:39:04] to a heart that is closed it does
[1:39:06] nothing
[1:39:07] once opened our hearts
[1:39:11] hard Opening Our Hearts we have to admit
[1:39:13] I can't do it on my own Lord and we open
[1:39:15] our
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:19] open our hearts it meant Lord I am a
[1:39:21] sinner I have carried my griefs my pains
[1:39:23] long enough I don't want him anymore
[1:39:25] Lord I want your formula the love of God
[1:39:28] to come into my heart and when that
[1:39:30] happened a miracle takes place The
[1:39:33] Impossible happens as God's love comes
[1:39:35] into the sinful heart that sin is
[1:39:37] transformed and removed and we become
[1:39:40] white as snow
[1:39:44] thank you
[1:39:48] why why would we want to keep sin in our
[1:39:52] hearts all it takes is open up our
[1:39:54] hearts Lord Jesus I've had enough I
[1:39:57] can't do it on my own would you come
[1:40:00] inside amen and every person you today I
