[0:52] mistake it's that one regret that haunts
[0:56] her to this day
[1:00] it just won't
[1:03] fade so many different stories we
[1:08] thought could not be redeemed but it's
[1:12] against our darkest
[1:16] failures we start to see the beauty of
[1:20] the
[1:21] blood the goodness of his grace the
[1:27] mercy undeserved
[1:30] that could never be
[1:33] explained Heaven's best takes all our

[2:01] [Music]
[2:04] thought just a single drop forever wipes
[2:11] away our every
[2:15] stain and with it
[2:20] power every chain that has us bound
[2:24] lights at our
[2:26] feet and we stand free
[2:30] that's the beauty
[2:32] of the blood the goodness of his grace
[2:39] the mercy UND deserted that can never be
[2:46] explained Heaven's rest takes all our
[2:50] scars for the worst in all of
[2:54] us that's the glory of the cross the one
[3:00] of his love that's the beauty of the
[3:07] [Music]
[3:12] blood when you get
[3:17] news from the doctor that you hoped
[3:21] you'd never
[3:24] hear and fear sets in
[3:30] but then the
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] word like a standard it cries out do not
[3:40] fear for you are
[3:43] heal that's the beauty of the
[3:47] blood the goodness of this
[3:51] Grace the mercy on deserted that could
[3:57] never be explained
[4:00] Heaven's best has paid the price for our
[4:05] healing by his
[4:07] stripes that's the glory of the
[4:11] Cross The Wonder of his love that's the
[4:16] glory of the
[4:19] Cross The Wonder of his
[4:27] love that's the beauty of of the
[4:31] [Music]
[4:35] blood the
[4:37] beauty of the
[4:43] blood amen Psalms chapter 112 a just the
[4:47] two just the two verses chapter 112 and
[4:50] 7 and 8 he shall not be afraid of evil
[4:54] Tidings his heart is fixed trusting in
[4:57] the Lord his heart is established he
[5:00] shall not be afraid until he see his
[5:04] desire upon his enemies I like to title
[5:08] this not afraid of bad news because this
[5:11] is how this brother in the scripture is
[5:13] living this uh believer and I'm so
[5:17] impressed with all the scriptures before
[5:19] it and afterward to talk about his
[5:20] strength and the favor of the Lord that
[5:23] he has and he's so blessed in so many
[5:25] ways he's prospering in so many ways and
[5:28] that's because he fears the Lord he
[5:30] respects the Lord he respects his
[5:33] Commandments he respects the word he
[5:35] walks in those precepts and though thus
[5:38] he becomes a a blessed man nevertheless
[5:40] even though he's a blessed man even
[5:42] though he's a prosperous man even though
[5:45] things are going good because he fears
[5:47] the Lord uh it did not mean that he
[5:50] would not be given evil Tidings that's
[5:52] what it says in verse 7 he even though
[5:56] he's blessed and he's prospered and has
[5:58] so many good things he's still going to
[6:01] receive evil Tidings well why is that
[6:03] well probably because he lives in the
[6:05] same he lived in the same world we live
[6:07] in and that is you're not going to get
[6:09] back by without uh evil Tidings coming
[6:13] to you which is bad news and everybody
[6:16] sitting here and sitting at home has had
[6:19] bad news come your way and usually it
[6:22] comes at the most unopp ofune times
[6:25] sometimes you feel like that you have
[6:27] done everything right sometimes s you
[6:29] have followed the Lord with all of your
[6:31] heart sometimes we bring that back to
[6:34] God lord I don't understand you're not
[6:36] alone many people in the Bible felt like
[6:38] they did everything right and you know
[6:40] what some people like job did everything
[6:42] right and bad news came to him anyway
[6:46] and so bad news we cannot stop bad news
[6:50] until we're in a Rapture and then bad
[6:52] news will stop can you raise your hand
[6:54] and say now I'm looking forward to the
[6:56] Rapture cuz I'm tired of getting bad
[6:58] news but you will not live a life
[7:01] without getting some bad news every now
[7:03] and then and maybe it's come a lot to
[7:05] you and so this man he's prosperous he's
[7:08] blessed he fears the Lord he's walking
[7:10] there's so many positive things to his
[7:12] life you say this guy doesn't even
[7:14] deserve to get any bad news and yet it
[7:17] says he gets evil Tidings bad news comes
[7:20] to good people sometimes bad news comes
[7:23] to Christians sometimes but what I like
[7:26] about this fellow fow is how he responds
[7:29] responds to the bad news at the very
[7:31] moment that he receives the bad news he
[7:34] is not afraid and why why is that the
[7:37] contrast because bad news brings fear
[7:42] bad news our first reaction is fear we
[7:45] heard something really bad from the
[7:47] doctor we heard something bad from our
[7:49] boss we lost our job you're fired uh
[7:53] whatever it is okay but the but our
[7:56] first reaction oh what am I going to do
[7:58] now uh you you the the doctor says
[8:00] you've got this uh you got this coming
[8:03] and bad news is funny you know the the
[8:05] story that says that the man was at the
[8:08] doctor's office and the doctor said I've
[8:10] got bad news and worse news he said my
[8:13] I'll take the bad news first he said
[8:15] you're you're only going to live for 24
[8:16] hours he said what what could be the
[8:18] worst news he said I I I found out
[8:20] yesterday I should have told you
[8:21] yesterday 24 hours ago so but that's it
[8:25] sometimes it just keeps coming doesn't
[8:26] it and sometimes it comes when we feel
[8:29] like we don't deserve it but here
[8:31] there's a a a brother here that is is
[8:34] fixed in his heart the Bible says is his
[8:37] heart is fixed and when our heart is
[8:40] fixed and established then it is not
[8:43] afraid of evil Tidings it's not afraid
[8:45] of bad
[8:46] news um in other words it does not get
[8:49] us all wound up it doesn't get us all
[8:52] scared of the bad news and why is it
[8:54] that we could have the ability to live
[8:56] that way that our first reaction cuz
[8:58] remember I said our first reaction is
[9:00] fear if we let it grip us our first
[9:02] thoughts my what are we going to do
[9:04] about this what are we going to do so
[9:05] that's our first reaction but this
[9:07] Fell's first reaction is he's not afraid
[9:10] of bad news he's not afraid of it in
[9:13] other words he's stabilized his heart to
[9:16] the place that I'm not going to react
[9:19] first out of fear I'm going to just wait
[9:21] for a moment and see what this is and
[9:24] he's got a lot of confidence in his
[9:26] heart you know why because when you
[9:28] serve a god of Resurrection ction power
[9:30] you know that God can eventually turn
[9:33] bad news into good news he's probably
[9:36] holding in his heart uh that confidence
[9:39] in God that God's going to watch over
[9:41] him no matter what the bad news is if he
[9:43] was in the New Testament he could refer
[9:45] back to Romans where it says all things
[9:48] work together for the good that love God
[9:51] and are chosen according to his purpose
[9:53] all things and so now that's why he
[9:54] stands there without a fear overtaking
[9:57] him because the bad news can turn out to
[10:00] good
[10:01] news praise the Lord so he he's been
[10:05] stabilized the reason he can be is he
[10:07] been stabilized on the word and uh it's
[10:10] as I preached Sunday he his his heart is
[10:13] following the security that has come to
[10:16] his soul it is anchored Hebrews 6:19
[10:19] says which hope we have as an anchor of
[10:23] the Soul both sure and steadfast and
[10:27] which entereth into that Within in The
[10:29] Veil The hope that we have as a Believer
[10:32] has an anchor we have an we have hope as
[10:35] an anchor and it's not out here as we
[10:38] look at the Old Testament Tabernacle
[10:40] it's within the veil it's not out here
[10:42] because if our Hope was out here we
[10:44] wouldn't be anchored but it's not where
[10:46] the elements are it's not outside it's
[10:48] not the bad news of the world it's not
[10:51] the news that we hear from the doctor
[10:53] we're anchored within the veil which is
[10:55] within our soul and that Anchor Holds no
[10:58] matter what storm or news that we get
[11:00] I'm just going to be very simple that
[11:02] the stability of the Soul can hold on
[11:05] and direct the heart to not be so
[11:07] reactive when we get bad news and this
[11:10] is what the Christian is there's
[11:12] something deep within us within the veil
[11:14] that's anchored and the and the heart
[11:17] has to line itself up with the security
[11:21] that is in the soul the hope we has of
[11:23] is an anchor it's not out here or
[11:25] changed or affected by the outside
[11:27] elements it's anchored within the Veil
[11:30] behind that behind the veil is not
[11:32] affected by the elements not affected by
[11:35] the storms that come but The Anchor
[11:37] Holds within the veil but our mind and
[11:40] heart has to Anchor to what the soul is
[11:42] saying our minds and our hearts have to
[11:46] be in line with and be anchored to what
[11:49] the soul is saying cuz your mind and
[11:51] your heart your emotions will will play
[11:53] tricks on you will guide you a different
[11:55] way the rush of fear will overtake you
[11:58] and that's why we said Sunday our hearts
[12:00] have to be in line in line with where
[12:02] our soul is at now I I realize as a
[12:05] minister Soul and Spirit are used
[12:08] interchangeably and heart even is used
[12:10] interchangeably in the Bible so
[12:12] sometimes I speak of the soul and it
[12:14] means the person's Spirit sometimes
[12:16] it'll speak of the heart and it means
[12:17] the soul but then sometimes as I read
[12:20] out Sunday when it speaks of the heart
[12:22] it says uh the heart is deceitful above
[12:24] all things well that's not talking about
[12:26] the soul the soul can't be deceitful but
[12:28] your heart can so that's why I've been
[12:30] preaching it that the other parts of you
[12:32] the mind the spirit the emotions the
[12:35] heart that can be unstable has to come
[12:38] to a
[12:40] stability like is in your soul yeah has
[12:43] to be anchored it has to be as he said
[12:46] here he was fixed his heart was fixed
[12:49] and fixed means to be fastened securely
[12:53] in its
[12:54] position fasten securely in its position
[12:57] when it is then that's how the fear
[13:00] moves away when the bad news comes in
[13:05] when the bad news is presented and the
[13:07] evil Tidings come before you that's when
[13:10] fear is rushed is pushed away and it is
[13:14] fastened in its position just hold study
[13:17] in the soul you're listening to the soul
[13:19] is saying hold study here a minute this
[13:21] is bad news it's really happening but
[13:24] let's just hold study let's just pray
[13:26] let's just take a minute and let's just
[13:28] remember the god that works all things
[13:30] for his good amen let's let's be stable
[13:33] a minute let's let's not uh be getting
[13:36] mad and angry at God I don't deserve
[13:40] this God and all why don't why don't we
[13:42] grow up a little bit and when we get bad
[13:44] news just Just Hold Steady for a minute
[13:47] let's let's wait and see what God is
[13:49] doing can I get an amen tonight when you
[13:51] get your bad news how do you react to it
[13:53] just hold study for a few minutes I
[13:55] don't have enough this week I got a a
[13:58] decrease in my pay and I don't know how
[14:00] I'm going to pay the bills and you
[14:01] receive that from the the office at your
[14:03] job that's the news that you receive
[14:05] we're going to have a lot of bad news
[14:07] but it's how we react to it that's right
[14:09] say Lord I'm just going to hold on to
[14:11] your promise here just a minute and and
[14:13] and and hold on to what God can give us
[14:16] so I want to say a couple things
[14:17] initially here about bad news um you
[14:20] know uh and hearing bad news on the news
[14:23] which we hear a lot of that today and
[14:25] we've always heard a lot of that matter
[14:26] of fact somebody told me about 40 years
[14:28] ago
[14:29] a a new a brand new news company wanted
[14:32] to change things up and set a rule that
[14:35] they would not report anything except
[14:38] positive things on the on the air and
[14:40] they said we're not going to report
[14:41] anything negative we're only reporting
[14:43] the positive you know it never made it
[14:45] to any success at
[14:47] all never made it anywhere so then you
[14:51] ask why well because we are trained more
[14:55] to live in fear and feed on bad
[14:59] news then we are the
[15:02] good so they're only feeding human
[15:04] beings actually what they like to
[15:08] hear because we're so accustomed to it
[15:12] you see and so they're they're not going
[15:13] to that wasn't successful because we
[15:16] have a bent in this world and that is
[15:18] that they're used to dwelling in fear
[15:20] and so they're looking the next thing
[15:22] that brings them fear and they keep
[15:23] feeding on it and feeding on it and it
[15:26] just keeps bringing Their Fear so that
[15:28] they kind of exib
[15:29] but you see now if we were more used to
[15:31] positive all the time then the negative
[15:34] news wouldn't affect as us as much but
[15:37] the reason that why that was not
[15:38] successful is we are trained in this
[15:40] world to live more in fear and to feed
[15:43] on bad news and uh you know so I want to
[15:46] talk about this because I want to be
[15:47] relevant always relevant to the hour
[15:49] that we're living in I want to talk
[15:51] about a little bit about social media
[15:53] and the news and keeping up feeding on
[15:55] those things because that's being
[15:57] relevant we're not 50 years ago now now
[15:59] we're in
[16:00] 2024 and we can safely say that the
[16:03] things that we can easily feed on we can
[16:06] easily surround ourselves with bad news
[16:10] all the time we are exposed to it all
[16:13] the
[16:15] time and sometimes we expose ourself to
[16:19] it sometimes we hang around people that
[16:23] are
[16:25] negative who you hang around is the
[16:28] atmosph osphere they
[16:30] create and so you sometimes you're
[16:33] courteous to people and if you have to
[16:35] be around them a little bit okay I know
[16:37] this is out there but it's hard to spend
[16:39] a lot of time with those people but
[16:41] sometimes we do and uh as you know my
[16:44] son Soloman has told me there's some
[16:46] people they're just show so used to
[16:48] drama in their life and they're so used
[16:50] to the negative in their life that if
[16:52] there's no drama going on they're
[16:55] uncomfortable and the devil knowes that
[16:57] so he just dwells in that realm of
[16:59] negativity and bad news and bad news and
[17:02] then that's how we call the Great Vine
[17:04] we call it the Great Vine we call this
[17:06] uh bad news travel how many knows bad
[17:08] news travels faster than good news
[17:11] exactly does yes because you see it's
[17:14] something within us but it's also
[17:16] something the devil Works in and people
[17:18] hang around that they feed on it and
[17:21] they're around people who talk about it
[17:24] and uh you so what I'm talking about
[17:27] first is that this isn't bad news coming
[17:29] to you this is you going to it so before
[17:34] we talk about surprising bad news that
[17:37] you go oh I never I didn't know that was
[17:39] going to happen you hang around the
[17:41] wrong people you feed on the wrong
[17:44] things you're actually running towards
[17:46] bad
[17:48] news that's really bad news isn't it
[17:52] that's bad news within itself that
[17:54] you're running towards things that are
[17:56] the are negativity that you're putting
[17:58] yourself around it that you're always
[18:00] feeding it on your phone and on your
[18:02] computer and you're going to it it's not
[18:05] coming to you you're going to it so we
[18:07] should deal with that first why does bad
[18:09] news travel faster I looked it up why
[18:11] does bad news travel faster than good
[18:13] news bad news spread so quickly because
[18:17] negativity is a survival
[18:20] Instinct people want to know what's
[18:22] going on in the world and whether it
[18:24] poses a threat to their way of life
[18:26] negativity provokes a strong emotional
[18:29] response make it an effective way for
[18:33] news outlets to engage Their audience
[18:36] they're all about ratings they're all
[18:37] about numbers they're all about how many
[18:39] is going to listen in and that's why
[18:41] that company could not promote positive
[18:43] because the people want to feed on the
[18:45] negativity and and somebody's lying in
[18:47] their pockets because the more we watch
[18:49] it the Richer they get and the more they
[18:51] feed us the bad
[18:53] news so it says it spreads more quickly
[18:56] because negativity is a survival
[18:58] Instinct human beings without the Lord
[19:00] and without something else that's real
[19:02] in their lives they actually it's a
[19:04] survival Instinct people want to know
[19:06] what's going on the world and whether it
[19:07] poses a threat to their way of life
[19:10] people whistling in the graveyard
[19:12] pretending they're not afraid and people
[19:14] are walking whistling in the graveyard
[19:16] of this world CU they know judgment is
[19:18] coming they know they're condemned they
[19:20] know they have no place to take their
[19:22] sin well they do but they won't go there
[19:24] they won't go to the Cross bring their
[19:26] sin with their sin they live in their
[19:28] guilt they know Judgment Day is coming
[19:31] sometimes Sinners know it more than than
[19:34] Christians know there's a judgment day
[19:35] coming because they feel the guilt of it
[19:37] and they know they're not right they
[19:39] know they're headed for hell someday
[19:42] some of them sing songs about it and
[19:44] actually boast that they're heading for
[19:45] hell that's when you're really becoming
[19:47] numb right that's when the world is with
[19:50] a hot iron is seared your conscience the
[19:54] Bible says boy I don't want to become
[19:56] that way you I know where I'm going I'm
[19:59] headed there and and so uh another
[20:03] article says addicted to bad news how
[20:05] Doom scrolling is affecting your mental
[20:07] health I'll let you know what that is
[20:08] here in a minute Doom scrolling it's a
[20:10] new term often find yourself down you
[20:13] often if you often find yourself down
[20:16] the rabbit hole scrolling through
[20:18] negative stories articles and posts for
[20:20] hours on end if the news is making you
[20:22] feel anxious it might be time to unplug
[20:26] from your phone for a while what is
[20:28] Dooms scrolling Doom scrolling is when
[20:30] you do exactly what we describe above
[20:33] sit on your device for long periods of
[20:36] time consuming bad
[20:39] news the term has gained popularity in
[20:41] recent years related to significant
[20:43] events like the covid-19 pandemic the
[20:46] 2020 us election natural disasters and
[20:49] conflicts in the Middle East and in
[20:51] Europe that's what's happening now
[20:53] because social media platforms serve
[20:55] content using algorithms you're more
[20:58] more likely to see content that's
[21:00] similar to content you've engaged in
[21:03] before or that people who share interest
[21:05] or a location with you uh that that you
[21:08] have engaged with this means it's more
[21:11] likely if you've looked at bad news
[21:13] content before and you spent time
[21:15] engaging with it you'll be served more
[21:19] bad news and before you know it your
[21:22] doom
[21:23] scrolling maybe you didn't know that
[21:25] tonight but I'm not trying to attach
[21:27] another title to you but if that's what

[21:42] Rapture can you say Amen we're called to
[21:45] rapturing Faith right now can I get an
[21:47] amen tonight we're not called where this
[21:49] world is going we're not called where
[21:51] the bad news is going this C is headed

[22:02] that's going down we're on the the The
[22:05] Old Ship of Zion somebody say praise the
[22:08] Lord we're on The Old Ship of Zion and
[22:10] we're headed to Zion we're marching to
[22:13] Zion hallu
[22:15] Hallelujah and so now we can't feed on
[22:18] all this cuz we're not headed in that
[22:20] direction so we don't need to be Doom
[22:22] scrolling like the rest news anxiety
[22:25] hopefully this will be a rebuke to you
[22:26] tonight if you're too involved in all
[22:28] the news but in this world with without
[22:30] God they hear the news this morning they
[22:33] feel unsafe they feel afraid can you say
[22:36] Amen it's just fear upon fear upon fear
[22:40] that's right it goes on to say because
[22:42] social media platforms serve content oh
[22:44] I already read that news anxiety is
[22:47] nothing new but it's on the rise fear
[22:49] and anxiety around the state of the
[22:51] world and possible future scenarios are
[22:53] not limited to the 21st century even
[22:56] ancient texts tell tales of the end of
[22:58] the world or Invaders from far away
[23:01] places the difference today is that our
[23:03] constant access to information
[23:06] particularly news and opinions means we
[23:09] can confirm our fears with a quick
[23:12] online search or by opening our social
[23:15] media apps so you got fear and you feed
[23:19] on of us it confirms fears now who wants
[23:21] to live a life confirming
[23:23] fears how pitiful is that we're actually
[23:27] feeding on things that's confirming our
[23:30] fears fears are not based on any truth
[23:33] so it's like I fear that my I'm going to
[23:35] lose my job I fear the economy is going
[23:37] to crash I fear that I'm not going to be
[23:40] able to get move into this because this
[23:42] may happen to the economy so it's
[23:44] unfounded yet but if you read the news
[23:47] it may confirm your fears right I just
[23:51] friends I just don't know if we should
[23:52] be living here in this kind of
[23:55] atmosphere confirming our fears
[23:59] NE in fact negative content gets twice
[24:01] as much engagement on social media than
[24:04] positive
[24:06] content the psychological effects of
[24:08] excessive consumption of negative or
[24:11] threatening content can be serious
[24:13] especially if you have a pre-existing
[24:15] mental health concerns such as
[24:16] depression or anxiety feelings of fear
[24:19] hopelessness sadness and isolation are
[24:22] all associated with doom scrolling and
[24:24] news anxiety in extreme and in extreme
[24:26] cases the symptoms can your PTSD
[24:30] post-traumatic stress disorder consuming
[24:32] happy or calming content on the other
[24:35] hand can improve a person's Outlook and
[24:37] make them more likely to perceive their
[24:39] own personal challenges in more a
[24:41] positive way the best way to reduce news
[24:44] anxiety sounds real simple but it can be
[24:48] tough to do in practice stop reading bad
[24:52] news I got too much to do for his
[24:55] kingdom you have too much to do for the
[24:57] kingdom of God to be worried about the
[25:00] bad you got too there's too many good
[25:02] things to do there's too much good news
[25:04] in the world there's too many good
[25:06] things that God wants out of your life
[25:08] and he said it in Matthew he says won't
[25:10] the father give us all good
[25:13] things if we ask him he's got a load a
[25:17] motherload of good things to download to
[25:20] you can you say amen God has good things
[25:23] for believers Our God Specializes Joe
[25:26] hoo wrote the song Our God
[25:28] specializes in good things things that
[25:32] you and I really need good things for
[25:35] the body and spirit all you have to do
[25:38] is just believe good things good things
[25:42] are God Specializes in good
[25:47] things we know those songs positive
[25:50] songs but it's it's truth God has good
[25:54] things so we don't want to feed on all
[25:56] the bad what you're feeding on is
[25:58] directly related to The Rush of fears
[26:01] that you will feel that's right in most
[26:03] cases I want to say in most cases cuz
[26:05] some cases anxiety hits and you can't
[26:09] find the source of it you don't know but
[26:11] if you're feeding on the wrong
[26:13] things you can be pretty sure it's
[26:15] contributing to the rush of fear in you
[26:18] yes sir so watch what you're feeding on
[26:20] we get overwhelmed by negative things we
[26:22] get in anxiety we get overwhelmed so if
[26:25] they are using the
[26:26] algorithms that's what you call it
[26:28] they're using our algor algorithms in
[26:31] order to what we're feeding on then they
[26:34] give us more of it they give us more of
[26:36] it they pinpoint you as an individual
[26:38] off your phone there's no privacy they
[26:40] find you they find what you're looking
[26:43] at this ought to tell people if they
[26:46] know what you're looking at God
[26:47] certainly knows what you're looking at
[26:50] and listen they picked up on something
[26:52] you got algorithms you have a certain
[26:54] thing and you have weaknesses and you
[26:56] have strength and if they know that God
[26:59] knows it and the devil knows it and I
[27:03] don't think we should let people just
[27:04] control us like that I don't think we
[27:06] should let the devil control us I think
[27:08] we should let God control us feed on the
[27:11] right things and then he might see send
[27:13] some more good things our way it's not
[27:15] reality that we won't have feelings of
[27:17] fear come around us I I I wouldn't
[27:19] preach that tonight because that would
[27:21] be preaching a perfection in our flesh
[27:24] in other words deny that you feel fear
[27:28] deny that you don't feel have feelings
[27:30] of fear I wouldn't ask you to do that
[27:32] because they are real they're around you
[27:35] but it's that initial reaction of what
[27:37] you're hanging on to and if your heart
[27:39] is stable its first reaction isn't to be
[27:42] given into the fear the rush comes along
[27:44] say Noe hold study right there I'm not
[27:46] going to give into that fear my future
[27:48] belongs to God wouldn't it be good that
[27:50] our first reaction is Faith instead of
[27:53] fear wouldn't it be good if we were
[27:55] built up that we can can handle bad news
[27:58] when it comes and not fear it wouldn't
[28:01] it be good to be living closer to that
[28:04] that we can handle bad news and we're
[28:07] not afraid of evil Tidings thank you for
