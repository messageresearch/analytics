[Music] You are you are you over everything you're [Music] king of be Jesus Jesus [Music] Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. Every day he wanted to dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord. And that was his one desire above money, above riches, above business, above anything. We need one main desire and that's to stay in the presence of the Lord. For in the time of trouble, now to me, this is a prophetic t uh scripture for our time. And we know that in the history of Israel, God's people, Israel, the Jews, we know they they come to times of extreme trouble, time of trouble. Daniel speaks of a time of trouble for the children of Israel. And uh so we we realize that'll uh begin to climax towards we get to getting to end time events. The trouble will be that the whole world will surround Israel and come against Israel and the whole and armies will surround. So now when when David says he's feeling that there's armies encamped about me, Israel will go through the same thing in prophecy that they'll be encamped. the enemy will be encamped around. We spiritually go through what Israel will go through literally. And so then he says one thing, I have a desire of the Lord. And then he says, in the time of trouble, verse 5, for in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. That's that has a lot of revelation in it to tell us where this is at. Number one, it's the secret of his tabernacle. It's not out there publicly openly. It'll be a secret as to where God's dwelling place is. But for the people of God, he will show them where he is so that they can live in his presence. This last part I want to go. He shall set me up upon a rock. How many know in the Bible that rock means revelation? So what do we what what is our secret place? It's really the revelation that God has given us. And you know you can't give yourself a revelation. It comes directly. He told Peter, he says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this. You didn't learn it in seminary. My father has given you this revelation. Satan can't get it. Can't get his grubby mitts on it. But when he gives you a revelation, it becomes the hiding place and it becomes the stability." Can you say amen? And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. You know what a believer does when he's surrounded by demon power? He raises his hands, his head's lifted above all of it and he just starts to praise the Lord. And then the devil gets more mad. Can you say, "Amen? I'm so glad in my trials and troubles I can lift my hands and give a song to the Lord." I want to title this today, hide me in the safe place of revelation. Just before our deliverance, just before our ultimate deliverance, we realize that the increased pressure, the armies gathered around us, the the pressure will not decrease, but it will increase. So much so that sometimes mentally we don't know if we can handle it. The only cry that we can cry is what David said, "Hide me in your secret place during this time." And I believe that's the the the place that you're living in that develops this rapturing faith, builds this rapturing faith. But we know there's great pressure on the outside. How many can say amen? There's great pressure on the outside. The heat has been turned up on the bride. Can you say amen? It I it it is it's it's it's in such an increased state that it's hard to fathom how much more pressure can come. And and I just wanted to say this that if that pressure is too much for you and you want that pressure off of you, then just stop standing up for the right things. If you don't if you can't handle the pressure of this hour, then just stop standing for things because a lot of your pressure is because you're standing up for something. You're standing for the message of the hour. Um, I'm going to elaborate on that a little bit later, but but if you if you don't like the pressure, stop he stop living a holy life. I want to say that it's the ones standing on revelation that are being surrounded and encamped by demons. The ones that are experiencing criticism, heavy criticism is probably the ones that are making a stand. And if you want an easy life without a lot of demons against you, then just be a borderline believer today because there's a lot less pressure on a borderline believer. But when a believer makes a stand for the truth and wants to live in holiness and live in sanctification and stand I believe this message with all my heart, get ready for more pressure. It's the ones that are making a stand that get more criticism. And if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen. Yeah, you can release a lot of pressure. Can you say amen? You can get out of a lot of this if you don't make a stand for anything. And uh you can, you know, you can be out of a lot of it. Matter of fact, you can there's choices you can make to just release a lot of pressure in your life and just kind of take the normal uh status of this world or maybe a borderline believer. It'd be a lot less pressure than this. But once you begin to stand, once you begin to articulate and speak this message and speak what you believe, whatever environment it is, if you do that, get ready for more pressure. And it's not people as much as it is demons don't like somebody to make a stand. Amen. Amen. So, you know, and and and you got to take a stand for things. You think that the trouble in this world is the economy, or you think the trouble is the scare of war. Uh, you think your trouble is you don't have enough money to meet your bills this week. You think that's my trouble. I don't have enough money. That's not really your trouble. When the Bible says it's a time of trouble, it's not it's not that you can't meet your bills this week. It's a much deeper trouble than that. And I'm not belittling that trouble in your life. We all have trouble. But the trouble the Bible is speaking of is not just that some friend forsake you or or or you don't have enough money or you lost your job. Your trouble I as standing for a believer your trouble is a lot deeper than that. David was talking about a much deeper trouble armies encamped around him. Everything against him. Can you say amen? And so the the the scare of war and money trouble your your trouble is not really that. It's much deeper than that. The devil likes company. So the devil wants to draw you into the same gossip. They feel better if someone else will join in the gossip with them. So they they it's not good enough to gossip, but it's they want to draw you in with the gossip. They want to draw you into their opinion because they need allies. They want to draw you down to their lies that they're telling. They want to draw you to their concrete conclusions that may not be based in truth. Can I get an amen this morning? It's it's it's it's an effort to bring you down and bring you into their dimension and their realm. And they want to war with you. Sometimes they want to battle. They want to they have have a good scrap. I've said it before. There are people in life that they just like a good scrap every day. They like drama. They like a good scrap. They like a good fight. They like competition between families. They they create it because you are a creator. Amen. The pressure to choose sides to pull you down. But then I go back to that scripture that David said, "God is lifting me above all these things." Can you say amen? And I can raise my hand. and he's going to set me upon the rock of revelation above mine enemies. Now, when you say above, it doesn't mean I'm better than my enemies, but I'm above it. In other words, I can live above it. I can live in that secret place. I can live upon a rock. And I got up on the chair last week. I'm living up here and all down here. They're saying, "Come on down. Fight with us. Come on down into my fear. I'm nervous about stuff. Can you be nervous with me?" No, I'm not. I'm just praising the Lord. I will pray for you, but I'm not coming down to that level. I'm I I that you know that's not where I want to live. And when God is raising you to a to higher levels, get ready for more devils. Amen. That was borrowed from borrowed from TD Jake. When you want to go to the next level, get ready for more devils. Because you can't go to the next level spiritually unless there's a fight to keep you away. It's just the way it works. Because you're making a stand. You're making a better stand. You're making a higher stand. And you don't want to be brought down. How many would raise your hand say, "I don't want to be brought down by people living in fear. I don't want to be living with a Jonah." Can you say amen? I want to be praising the Lord all the time, no matter what I'm going through. Can you say amen? You get up here say, "No, I'm not coming down there. Why don't you come up here with me and praise the Lord a while? Why don't you come out of that fear? I just want to go into this prophecy of Israel just a little bit. The theme of prophecy for Israel is to in prophecy to become surrounded by the enemy, literally the world against them. And many Jews see and believe prophecy of deliverance. They believe it today that their Messiah will deliver them. They believe the the the deliverance part, but they don't see what comes before their deliverance. They don't understand that. And there will be great armies gather around that uh that uh piece of land there. And it's not because of the piece of land necessarily, but it's who's there and God's people. And so we see then that that the armies I'm going to skip some of this because some of some of this is revisiting what I've already preached on before, but I just wanted to bring in this element of Israel literally now. And so if you turn with me to Daniel 12, we'll see something happen here. when all the armies gather around just after all the armies uh in prophecy all surround Israel in Daniel chapter 12 if you turn with me there to verse one there's a little bit of prophecy for Israel here I wanted to deal with we see then when it comes to this trouble and it's called this is Israel's time of trouble worse than any trouble they've had a lot of trouble but this is the worst time is when all nations will gather against them That's right. And it's it's a time of trouble like never seen before. Chapter 12 says, "Then at that time," and this is a time where the pressure will come, "shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people, and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time." Now, Israel had a lot of trouble through the years. They had 6,000 years of trouble. They had times of trouble. They had times when they went in rebellion against God and they went into Babylon into captivity. They had a lot of troubling times. But this scripture says at the end they've never had any trouble compared to this trouble. And I just look at that spiritually and say that for the bride spiritually, there's no trouble like we're having now in the spiritual realm. There's no other pressure like we're having now. Right? Now you say, "Brother Paul, I don't know what you're talking about. My life is good. I'm doing pretty good. I got a good salary and everything's pretty comfortable. Um, so I'd only say to that, what are you doing right? I'd say that first, but then I would say check your life because anybody who's making a stand and that's the elect of God, the guns are pointed on you. It says says now the the the the and it talks in the Bible here, let me just finish this. in the time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to the same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that should be found written in the book. Notice now there's the elect written in the book of life. So we got several reasons now why the armies are encamped around this particular people, right? They're in the book of life. Can't you remember that when you're being surrounded? Can't you remember that? There's a reason that I'm being fought with demons probably because my name is in the book of life and I'm the elected. Can you say amen? And I'm part of him. Now we go to book of Revelations. Revelations 12:17. Just another small element I want to bring in that you would understand why there's an increased demonic power. And Satan maybe is in the time where he's very nervous and he's, you know, he doesn't understand the word. He doesn't understand revelation and he can't have what the bride has. He can't have it. And this is why he's jealous. It's why he fights against it to stop it. You know, you've always had what the devil wanted. That's right. With Adam and Eve, he had the creative power and was the ruler of this earth. And that's what devil wanted. From so from the very start, you the believers have always possessed by revelation and had it in them what the devil wanted. And you wonder why he's against you and he can never have it. That's enough to have a really shouting time on Monday. Put it on your refrigerator if you have to. Devil, you will never have what I have. [Applause] And and from the beginning, I like to point this out. It's like he comes on the scene because he's jealous of what Adam and Eve have. And eventually he had to be kicked out. You know what? Actually, it happened before. He was kicked out of heaven. He he got this stir with all the the brothers, the angels and a third part of the angels with influence with him to come against. He wanted to raise his kingdom. So he was jealous. He couldn't have the position he wanted. And so now he creates a ser finally they he was kicked out of heaven with his angels. He was kicked out on earth. He's kicked out of the garden. Even the son and daughter were kicked out of the garden because they fell with him. He was kicked out. Then there's tension between uh Isaac and uh Ishma. There's tension between Cain and Abel. And then then that ended and then there's tension between Ishmael and Isaac and he had to be kicked out of the camp. We got to get rid of cast out the bond woman and her son. And then I could go scripture after scripture where the tension rises, he gets kicked out. The tension rises, he gets kicked out. Why do you let this guy bother you? When he's been kicked out of every believer's situation from the beginning, if he's been kicked out all the way through, then why don't you give him the boot every now and then, all the way to the end when we get the book of Revelation and Satan and his angels will be cast out. The accuser of who? The accuser of the brethren stood there with tension, with accusations, keeping things tense all the time, accusing, accusing, and but but one day, one day, it's the same history. He's going to be kicked out, and you'll never hear that voice again. I don't know how he can't look in the book of Revelations and see his end. He's going to be kicked out at the very end of it. Kicked out of the atmospheres. Kicked out of heaven. Kicked off the earth so the bride can come back and enjoy this without the devil here. Praise God. Hallelujah. Give him the boot every day because he's used to it. When he's trying to come in and make you a gossiper, give him the boot and stop your family and say, "We don't do that." Because that's the realm the devil works in. Give him a boot. That's not you. You're teaching your children to be gossipers. teaching your children to be accusers of the brethren. To be accusations against elders, that's a serious thing. No, no, that's not the kingdom of God. That's Satan's kingdom. In the time of trouble, the time of trouble is our is the time of deliverance. And this is what he says in Psalms 27. In in the time of trouble, he will hide me. So, in this time of trouble is the time for our deliverance and a rapture. If we're surrounded by the enemy, ganged up on by the enemy, guess what? And it's if it's showing no relief, I I and it shows nothing in the prophecy for it to stop. You know, and the thing is is that until God steps in, he lets the pressure continue. He lets the pressure go. The only hope we have is a hiding place until he delivers us in a rapture. But we have that hiding place. The only thing it's doing is setting us up for the total deliverance and that's a rapture. My friends, if you hear the simplicity of what I'm expressing for my spiritual life and your spiritual life, the only place we need, the one desire we need to be in every day is to live in that secure safe place in the word. Daniel 3:8, wherefore at that time certain Chaldans came near and accused the Jews. They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh king, live forever forever. Thou, oh king, hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of their cornet, uh, flute, harp, sack, butt, sultry, doulamer, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image. Um, I'd like to preach a little sermon in here that did you notice bowing to the image was associated with all kinds of music. Music was used to open their emotions to bow to the image because music is used to open up your emotions. We use it here in the service. But what is it opening up your heart to receive? Right? And whosoever falleth not down and worshipeth that he should be cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews whom the whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. These men, oh king, have not regarded thee. They serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage point. This man was mad, but now he's in a rage. And what is he in a rage about? What is his in his anger increased about? Believers who made a stand against him. That's what it was about. His anger increased. His rage increased. I'm going to do something more now because I'm angry. Why am I angry? Because they won't join in with the rest and bow to the same thing. They're not going to bow. His rage was increased. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shad. Can you imagine? We get mad at a lot of things, but can you imagine what this guy is on rage and fury about? He's against three believers who make a stand and you make a stand. See, some of you today, I'm I'm I'm encouraging you. I pray you feel the pull of the Lord for your family, your wife, girlfriend, whatever it is. I I pray that you feel the pull through the preaching that Christ is pulling you because you haven't made a stand yet. You haven't made a real stand, but you need to make a stand. You're a daddy. You need to make a stand for the rest of the family. So, he's in a rage. He's in a fury. In verse 14, Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I've set up? Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sagput, sultry, doulamer, I don't know why all the names of the instruments are mentioned again. And all kinds of music, ye shall fall down and worship the image which I have made well. But if ye worship not, ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands, threats, pressure, anger coming against you. Wow. So he gave him another chance. My dad used to preach this. I always loved when he preached Shadak Meshach a minute ago because he said, "I'm going to give you guys another chance. Okay, we're going to do this privately. The whole world doesn't need to see. Just come over here in a minute. And here's the image right here. And just while nobody's watching, just get down and bow. That's all you have to do. Just do a quick little bow privately, secretly. I'm giving you another chance to bow. And here's their answer. Verse 16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered instead of the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter." In other words, in our language, let me make myself perfectly clear, perfectly transparent. We don't want any question in your mind. Amen. We're being very careful to answer very direct to you. Glory be to God. Take a stand. Don't be afraid of the enemy. Have we made ourselves perfectly transparent? If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fire furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. So God's able to do it. But if not, be it known unto thee. May we make it crystal clear to you, oh king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. You want a little amen? There's a believer to me. God is able at this moment to deliver me from whatever it is, cancer, emotional instability. God can heal me. God can raise the dead. And I believe it with all my heart. I've watched it happen. I know it can happen. But I want to let the devil know that if something happened, God chooses to take somebody in cancer. I'm still not bowing to the world. I'm still not bowing to your image. That's the language of a believer. These three men fell bound into the midst. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king, verse 24, astonished, rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto the counselors, "Did not we cast three men bound in the midst of the fire?" They answered and said unto the king, "Oh tree, true king, we only sent three in there." He answered and said, "Lo, I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire, unharmed by the flames, surrounded but unharmed." How many would raise your hand and say, "That's where I want to be living. I don't care the flames are I if I'm surrounded I want to be unharmed by the protection of God.
