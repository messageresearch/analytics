TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign God bless you all right I didn't have the blue screen of death on my computer but it wasn't acting up so we'll just give it a minute to restart and while we're waiting and standing perhaps we can just turn in our Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter two just roll doing well middle of our work week and thank the Lord we're healthy and able to be here there's a lot of sickness going around my goodness so by his grace this evening I'd like to begin speaking about the pergamian church age and um I wanted to give a little bit of a historical background and then take a little thought about uh about faith living by his faith let's see here we're almost there yep all right Revelation Chapter 2 and verse 12. and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things said he which hath the sharp sword with two edges he says I Know Thy works and where they are dwellest even where Satan's seat is and that's what it can emphasize uh that's a how how Christ is describing this pergamian church it's Satan's seat this is not this is a president talks about the modern day being Satan's Eden pilgrims has talked about being Satan's seat this is where these Believers had to live in Satan's seat and you and yet you hold fast my name and have not denied my faith even in those days where an antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth again emphasizing Satan's seat where Satan's dwelling of the churches where um Christ wants to be dwelling and Satan has gotten this figured out so well that now he is dwelling in the very place where Christ should sit in the throne but I have a few so he's saying uh um you've got really really tough circumstances um and you're still living for me great that's that's wonderful because I have a few things still against you because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and commit fornication and you also have them and that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit of sat into the churches to him that overcometh will I give to each of the Hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and in this Stone the new name written which no man knows saving he that receiveth it and not just pray Heavenly Father we just ask your blessing upon your word this evening lord it's been the been the busy day for all of us and how easy it is when we get relaxed in the warm building we can just get to get tired and Lord I pray nonetheless that you would just take control of me this evening Lord help me to get out of the way father but you might Minister something of of Grace and of help Lord to each one of us we are struggling and then battling in some way Satan's got a Punch coming to each one of us Lord and it can be difficult the battle can be draining I pray Lord that in some way that you would just give encouragement to each one in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated so I'll just do a little bit of a little bit of a review a little bit of a historical background and then talk about how um some of a couple of things that the Lord speaks to the Believers of pergamus how they're able to live uh for God in this place where Satan's dwelling where Satan's seat is how can they live for God nonetheless we'll just say one thing that's there's no way that we can be Overcomers today or they could be Overcomers in their day living by their own faith or By Their Own Strength it's only by his faith any of them or any of us have a chance at overcoming so again the seven letters uh in Revelation two and three that John is writing um transcribing for uh for his for for Christ um these are written to seven different churches in Asia Minor and these churches have uh characteristics that are going to be coming up in future Church ages and chapter um in in the future centuries in the Revelation chapter 1 calls this book a word of Prophecy so it's it's very it's it's a very good interpretation you see that this is not just uh these letters not just for the time of John's writing it's for the future Church ages to come so we've talked about the Ephesus and Smyrna and then that they will be looking at pergamis or their brand name identified the time period being from 312 to 606 and he identified a man named Martin of Tours as being the um church as being the angel of the Church of Smyrna or the messenger to that age and I think it's nice to put a picture of these uh Brothers up I started typing it in there I almost put in their Saint Martin of tourists that no I shouldn't put Brother Martin of Tours because all of these are very catholicized images if we ever hear about cultural expropriation it's one of those nice woke terms today how you had to rename the Cleveland Indians because here we have all these white people I have all kind of be careful what I say and they have all kinds of people trying to profit off of a Native American tribe who was uh who uh was handled very unfairly by the people who are now profiting from them well you could look at whenever the Catholics are taking these Saints and men and women of the past and calling them saints I think it's almost cultural expropriation because these are brothers and sisters who believe the truth and they're being pushed into this other mold into the Halo behind and say these were Catholics so they weren't um but Martin of tourists I'm not going to read I'm not going to read anything about him this evening if there's a better Brandon shares some testimonies about what God accomplished in his life he's pictured as a soldier because um it said that he's as he's going through the city as a soldier he he shares his cloak with the beggar man one evening and that and that night Christ comes to him in a dream and uh and he um and he calls him and then and Martin responds and that was a a transforming uh moment in his life but the um his life was characterized by the by the supernatural and he and he lit um um the fire for for the further Church there and and Tours France at that time period I want to take a look this evening um as we look at the history how did the church get to be this in in the spot where they're called Satan's seat where Satan himself dwelleth because this is quite uh quite a slide away from the book of Acts where the Holy Spirit comes down and Pentecost and the true church is founded how does this happen and um if you I don't have this on this slide if it's at the very front page of the notes in Acts chapter 18 there is something referred to um Paul has leaves Athens and he comes to Corinth and he says he found a certain Jew there named Aquila born in pontus lately come into come from Italy with his wife Priscilla this is where Paul makes acquaintance with Aquila and Priscilla and he says they've lately come from Italy and they uh so they they're coming from Rome why did they just come from Rome why are they leaving Italy well um after the persecution in the early church there around Jerusalem other places Jews left Jerusalem believing Jews left Jerusalem as a scatter all over the Empire within a few years some of them even make it so far as Rome the capital city of the Empire and they actually establish a small Church there now Paul writes letters to them and he talks about um a genius Andrew Nyquist who Apostles helped found the church there in Rome so there was a small Church there in Rome that was founded however um in about 80 36 um um that church has established and it goes there for several years but I think the Roman has one of the Roman historians talks about how they were altercations but the Roman authorities didn't like the the Jewish and and the Christians being there in the capital and one Emperor Claudius bans them from the capitol so who would have been the the um the most knowledgeable stable Christians at the time well it would have been the ones who brought the gospel who had probably been Jews so now this this church has just been around for a few years and Claudius bans the Jews from the capitol so this church is losing its seasoned leadership Aquila and Priscilla and others and brother Branham talks about this in the church age book in page 209 it says with the Jews banished from the city the backbone of that little church was practically broken perhaps even the elders had been Jewish and so would be gone the flock would be unattended and since the word had not been written as a guide it'd be very easy for this little flock to drift or be inundated by the philosophers and pagans of that day and he says we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslidden and began to introduce Pagan's ceremonies under Christian titles in this time of banishment lasted for 13 years and this was the first church of Rome and the devil sees us as a prime opportunity if I could get in here this is the First Church of Rome and I can get influence in the leadership and I can start blending paganism and idolatry together what an opportunity this is It's almost like a hacker comes in here and takes over your channel and is now sending out your as if you're being your Instagram Channel everybody expecting your family pictures to come hacker comes in and starts broadcasting something else that's a very jarring experience my wife had her Instagram hacked back in August and all of a sudden weird things just kind of coming out of it you've lost all control over your channel well that's kind of what the devil's hoping to accomplish as he takes over this first church in Rome but the title page is still first like the crook family Instagram all kinds of things to be going out of there with my picture on there my kids pictures on there and they're like we stand behind that that's the kind of public relations coup the devil hopes to accomplish by this first church in Rome so um after this time of banishment is is over is time of banishment lasted 13 years just imagine a young Church been around for two or three years and then all the deacons all the Ministries gone what can this is the Devil's Playground we have some sincere young believers and he's just going to go in there and have his time or after the time of banishment is uh is passed Junius andronicus come back in 54 A.D and brother Branham has imagined their horror to find a church with a Christian title for Christian Church's room and he walks in there and he sees nothing Chris well you might see like imagine like a like a little message first you see brother Brandon's picture there and you see brother a different brother is from the West you might have supported it and you've got Brother Paul's picture there in the corner but different other ones and he comes in and he sees nothing else that's good but I'm associated with this that's what had happened they they see a courage with a Christian title that's woefully Pagan there were altars in the church but they placed incense on it celebrated Pagan rights the established leaders of the church couldn't be approached they had these established should just have something good going now this is a money Mill for them they're not going to be approached by Junius and Andrew nikus they don't want anything to do with the true gospel anymore so Andrew nycus and Junior start a second Church the second Church of Rome now when you look at two churches on the street you see the First Church of Rome the second Church of Rome which one probably is the better pedigree the one that goes back to the original gospel you think it would be the First Church of Rome and that's what the devil wants as well and again go to the First Church of Rome that's the original that's what we got going and that's what the devil still wants people to think today but when they establish this new church this second Church of Rome that's where God started working and the devil does everything he can to distract people from the true work and gets them to think this is how God this is where God really should be operating and just think how does how does God do things he he comes and operates by grace through faith these are the key words of how how the Holy Spirit operates in our lives what does the devil have a chance now to do to twist the way God works twist our understanding of how God wants to work because he took over God's Institute the devil took over Christ's Instagram Channel they're in the first church he's sending out all kinds of messages to twist their understanding of what the gospel is really like well this First Church of Rome grows in numbers it becomes um some big enough for the government to notice it and they do everything they can't turn the government against the second Church to turn the government against the True Believers because the True Believers are a thorn in their side and brother Branham talks about how even the polycarp heard that the First Christian Church of Rome was involved in the such paganism and had corrupted the truth of the Gospel that he went there to implore them to change but it was to uh to no avail he says he saw them light candles and burned incense on the altar he saw them celebrate the Passover under the name of Easter where they elevated this disc-shaped bread and honored the Sun God by saying this is really the body of Christ and they poured out the wine as an offering to the gods but this aged Saint who had traveled 1500 miles could not arrest their downward plunge and God spoke to him as he was leaving Ephraim as married to his idols LED them alone and polycarp never returned and this is how very gradually the Antichrist spirit is getting into the church and the false mind is just trying to put its tentacles out around the True Vine and just suffocate it the false finds turning its anger against the Living God by trying to kill the elect persecute it and uh all the while still claiming that they were the true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ have wanted the fact that they were the original Church Etc if you look at that and the one of the descriptors descriptions of the pergamian church it talks about in Revelation 2 6 sorry this is the Ephesian Church it says this thou Hast that though hadest the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate already in the Ephesian Church age which has been in the time of Andrew nikus and Junior as his First Church of Rome is getting established Christ is commending the Ephesian church I I you hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate by the time the pergamian church comes around the Deeds have become Doctrine and that's not just changing word um because we can if we're doing things that are wrong in our lives these are these are wrong actions but we might not really want to try to talk about it too much because we know it's not quite right but we still tolerate it we still do it but when we're willing to defend ourselves with a well-reasoned defense why my actions are not just acceptable they're they're good that's when Deeds become Doctrine where I'm not I'm I'm tolerated the Deeds of Nicolaitans I'm tolerating something I know that really isn't right but I'm doing anyway and just don't spend too much time talking about it that's kind of how it wasn't Ephesus this wasn't official by the time pergamus rolls around the Deeds of the Nicolaitans they're wanted their official talking points this is Doctrine it's acceptable it's defensible and this has become a big part of the church and as as this rule as this goes on um you know the the programian church starts at the church age starts in 80 um 3 12 I believe it was and this is the year that emperor Constantine um fights a particular battle at a place called the milvian bridge and Constantine is right there to the left of center there on this white horse before Constantine was the Roman emperor Diocletian and under him the Roman Empire kind of started splintering apart and I think there was a tetch rocket there were four different rulers and the Constantine and his rival makes inches were able to consolidate things under themselves so they were just two and then they have this big battle at the place called The milvian Bridge which you can see to the right Oh but before the battle it said the Constantine says he had to dream of a white cross and then he felt that this was an omen that if he could get the Christians to pray for him that God would be merciful to his army and they would have the victory so the next morning he says that he had all of the soldiers paint white crosses on their Shields and the next day they did have a victory in Constantine it was enough for him to become a Christian and he declared the persecution of the of the Christians to be ended I watched a when I taught world history a couple years ago I came across interesting History Channel um documentary about this particular battle and it turns out that Constantine tells this story he doesn't come up with the story about the crosses and everything like that until years later he comes up with a story about the about this Vision that he has right before the Council of nicaea 13 years later when he has all the bishops from around from around the Empire coming because now that he's a Christian he's using Christianity as a way to unite his Empire but there's a dissension about the godhead and he doesn't like this dissension because it's hurting his political Unity so he wants to get everybody together but he's this pretty much a pagan emperor what does he have to pull out to get all these these Christian Bishops to listen to him well he pulls out this spiritual Ace card that I had a supernatural Vision this is what happened this is what we did and we got this Victory and that was enough to help increase his his credibility there and he uh and he and he um became a patron of the church there in Rome um he was he was supporting them politically he stops the he stopped the persecution an under Constantine the Pagan Roman Empire which had fall but which was which had already splintered under Constantine the Pagan Roman Empire is resurrected into a Papal Roman Empire and we see that this is the this is the image that the Nebuchadnezzar dreamed and Daniel interpreted and at the very bottom of the image we've got this is this is typing the four World kingdoms Babylon meets the Persians the Greeks and this fourth Kingdom be the Romans and as it's splitting into iron and clay it's going to this this Beast is going to be powerful but it's going to die and it's going to be resurrected to something else and for their brand he quotes um I think from Revelation 13 the Beast was killed it was not it then it rises up again and that is when pagodrome is killed papal Rome takes its place all this happens under Constantine he's he's breathing new life into this dying Roman Empire and this is an opportunity for um for for the devil Satan is now winning official access to the first church of Romans winning official access to the Church of Christ and he's able to enthrone himself in the temple of God he's able to be worshiped as God this is something he was dreaming of being able to do all the way back in the book of Isaiah Satan he wants to exalt himself above the stars of God he wants to be up on the sides of the north he wants to be like the most high and now he's actually accomplishing it here on the acreage on planet Earth here in the time of Constantine and he's he's enthroned himself in the temple of God to be worshiped as God himself and this is this is a a a huge victory for Satan so circus is called Satan's throne room because the first church in Rome is gradually becoming um um his church the Satan's Church yeah under the wrong name under the name of Christ church and state are being united under Constantine and this is what the Revelation 2 talks about being the doctrine of Balaam Balaam was able to try to get the midianites to unite with the with the Hebrews and they'd have these big feasts and everybody would come together it'd be it'd be political it'd be a good thing and this is what church and state does do under Constantine the Pagan Empire becomes the papal Roman Empire and then Satan wins access to the name of Christ sits and thrown to be worshiped and like I said this is this is a huge opportunity for Satan to mess with the Believers Minds what does Christ actually like because Satan is sitting enthroned in this new church and he's sitting in there acting like he's God and he said that he's changed all the symbolism he's got different priests he's got different ever when when in the Old Testament when when Moses raised up the Tabernacle all the symbolism was to point to God in a certain way all the sacrifices were were meant to be done a certain way as a lesson as a symbol as a type and all those things are being twisted and broken even the priesthood that's being twisted and broken to the false image of God can be given over to the people and when the talk about then how at that and that age how could the Believers live and overcome in that time and then thinking for ourselves how can we then also live and overcome in this time if Satan has access to the name of Christ if Satan were to be able to take over um The Message Church broadcast for a couple for a couple of weeks what damage could you do how would he be doing it and you think about how has he done it even today where people who have grown up in the message had wrong experiences about the message have a completely wrong image they think they hate the message but they hate something that really isn't the message that's the very thing that he was trying to accomplish in the age of pergamus he was he was given The False Image but making people think it was the True Image and they really have no they have no concept of who God actually is that's what he was trying to do then it's what he's doing now and one thing I want to talk look at um Satan wants to take us away from the Simplicity that is in Christ if he can make something complicated and confusing he'll have us Checkmate we won't even have we we won't even be battling him he'll be able to have a victory without actually getting his hands dirty and war with us I'm just going to take take a look back how how do we fight our battles how do we win um they're on the middle of Page Three Revelation Chapter 2 um verse 13 Jesus says I know your Works where you dwell even where Satan seat is and you hold fast my name and that's not denied my faith and I just want when brother Bram talks about there's a about a one and a half page section in the church age book where he talks about thou has not denied my faith any any underscores the truth that there is no faith but God but my faith if you have any faith it's only because God gave it to you and that's something that we can get real confused about sometimes we think that we have to have faith to uh to to believe in God that our faith produces something it's not the case it's his faith completely so we just want to talk about in the wild the only way to live for Christ is by the Faith of Christ and when I look at this the first time years back I God used a couple couple ministers or priests on this topic and it just brought such a rest into my heart because we hear from in Hebrews chapter 11 that you unless you have faith you can't please God like wow I better make sure I have faith because if I don't have faith there's no way for me to please God and that can get our mind raising how could I even please God then and I just this this really brought rest I pray it will bring rest to you all heart as well the devil wants us to think you have to have having faith is something that's superhuman in order to have faith you have to be a superhero you just have to now you've got in order to have faith you have to go on a heroic Quest you have to draw your sword you have to slay the dragons you have to bring the damsel back when you come back what you've gotten that's faith we hear Brother Bear I'm talking about how faith is this big guy with with a hairy chest and there's a ripped with muscle that's faith and we think man if I've got to be all those things to have faith I look in the mirror and says man I'm a long way from that and the devil wants to think and you might already have faith but he's going to think you've got to have you got you have you have to look like faith in this glossy beautiful magazine if you don't have faith it looks like this you don't have it and if he can convince you that you don't have something that you might actually have then you won't be using what God gave you to fight the devil with and he's got it off easy and I think that's a big strategy of the devil Romans chapter 10 says the righteousness which is of Faith speaks on this wise don't say in your heart who shall Ascend into heaven to bring Christ down from above this is where I think this is like this heroic Quest idea of faith I want to pray so hard I can climb up the ramparts of heaven and fall Before the Throne of God and then I can get the holy spirit because I've prayed so hard I've made it there it's no that's not how Faith Works and don't say who shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ up again for me I've just got to go so hard and fight so many battles to get God's attention then they'll do it for me no that's not what it is what is it he says the word is naivee even in my mouth and in my heart The Word of Faith with which we preach that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in your heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved that's it it's not some superhuman kind of thing we have to be a superhero to have faith no that's not what it is at all Romans 9 16 is as uh so then it depends not on human will or exertion but on God who has Mercy Faith doesn't depend on you your spiritual victories and your spiritual battles don't depend upon your faith depends upon God's faith in the message interavailable brother Branham says Christianity is not something where you just have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve and everything like that to get something certainly not then he goes on to say I'm not against fasting that's that's not it but we don't go with it at the motive where I just have to make myself starve so badly then Christ will finally see I need something he says no you don't do things by works it's by Grace God and Sovereign Grace and with that that mentality that Satan tried to get the pergamy in church to to to to accept if we could we just have to flagellate ourselves we'd have to do whatever we have to burn enough candle say enough prayers and then Christ will finally pay attention to us and that can that can get into our minds as well I could buy I just have to do so many things and then Christ will finally soften his heart toward me and give me what I'm asking for his but brother Ram says no that's not how Christianity works you don't do things by works it's by grace and sometimes we have the idea that um yes I'm saved by grace but I've got to be good enough to get the Holy Ghost that that that's false it's all Grace he calls you by Grace he forgives You by Grace he sanctifies You by Grace he fills you with the Holy Spirit by Grace he raptures You by Grace it's all Grace it's none of the things that we were to do if one as if God were one moment to take his hand from Office we'd fall flat on the ground it's all Grace amen Ephesians 2 8-9 where does faith come from for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of God you didn't have faith God Gave You faith it's not a work such any man should boast Ephesians 3 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so whose faith is it by the faith of him it's Christ's Faith he gives it to you it's you don't have it to begin with God gives it to you Philippians 3 9. not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ whose faith is it it's Christ's faith we don't have faith to begin with Hebrews 12 2 looking unto the author and finisher of our faith Jesus begins the faith he finishes the faith he writes the story all in between it it's his story the history isn't our story it's his story that he's doing in US Galatians 2 16 knowing that the man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ it's all his faith all his faith and sometimes we can I think we can be like Winnie the Pooh sometimes the Winnie the puhi he goes off and and he has he has a problem and he and if when he has a problem he just goes I gotta think think think and when we get in there probably like I just gotta believe believe okay I gotta believe I gotta get this faith become a faith faith faith come on faith it's ridiculous but that's that's how Winnie the that we've got Winnie the Pooh kind of believer sometimes he's got a faith faith faith faith come on faith but that's not how it works because Winnie the Pooh didn't have faith in the faith he had something that God gave him and God works that faith and it's not Winnie the Pooh doing anything it's not you or me doing anything we just kind of relax and let Christopher Robin save the day or we get the idea it's all by the Faith of Christ my brethren have not the faith who's faith of our Lord Jesus Christ you don't have your own faith any faith you have it's given to you by the Lord Jesus and what the scripture that brother bran uses had never seen this scripture that I was reading in the church age book that's why I recommend getting in that book yourselves because there's all it's it's we talk about we sometimes one of the the big barriers to entry of the church age book or something it's all these deep Mysteries I won't get anything out of it that's wrong there is some there is some stuff that can be hard to understand but what I've got here this evening about faith it's in there this is simple this pertains to Everyday living it's there and I encourage you put your own Roots down and these things make it your own book um that that'll it'll it'll change your life but the this is Acts 3 16 Peter is responding he's sharing about this miracle it was just performed I think by the gate beautiful and Peter is saying it's not me it is his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whomisia no yea the faith which is by him have given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all so whose faith is it it's not Peter says it's not my faith it wasn't even this man's Faith it's the faith which is by him it's the Faith of Christ that the faith that Christ gives that Christ quickens we just happen to be there Peter says I was I just had to front row seat at the gate beautiful when the Lord came down and quickened this brother's faith it wasn't me I just happened to be there it was the Faith of Christ because if any of us can claim that any of us had any kind of role in anything that Christ does it's of works and not of Grace it has nothing to do with us what does Satan want to do as he's sitting in Thrones during the temple he wants to put a little bit of poison in this beautiful pool this beautiful pool is the Waters of Grace the Waters of faith and the Satan just put one little drop of works it pollutes it his faith his grace we had absolutely nothing to do with it nothing brother Brandon's right right here Peter did not claim it was his own human faith and he had more than he claimed it was his own name he said that Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed the great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2 13. it was his faith it was not faith in him or we are just putting our will more strenuously toward the right thing and that brings direct result no it's not that it's the Faith of Christ not our not our Attention our strenuous attention to it it's not the faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers I think that's a game changer that is what brings us into rest because as long as we think that we have anything to do about it any kind of failure of God's work in our lives can be a tributable to us to the extent that we think we have something to do about it but we have nothing to do with God's work in their lives when you say Lord have your way that's all that we do have your way and the more that I try to participate and help God in his work I just frustrate the grace of God no I'm gonna I'm putting my hand decide I don't want to mess up God's work in my life Lord Just Have Your Way and I want to take some time this evening I don't usually do this but I'd like to read some read multiple quotes where brother Branham talks about faith and well as I read these it just brings a real rest to me he says and message proving his word you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God you can only have it as God gives it to you so it's not like Winnie the Pooh faith faith faith bacon hopefully I get enough oh that we're doing that by on our own you can only have faith as God gives Faith it's a gift of God he says in the message faith is a substance it ain't what you try to make yourself believe it's simple nothing you can work yourself up to it's no excitement I notice people come in line and just get to shaking themselves and saying oh God hallelujah amen glory to God and that can happen sometimes and if you're coming in and then when the Holy Spirit Falls that produces that result but if we think I've got to do all these things first we're in the cart before the horse and then we're hindering the work of God so we can't say just because someone's shaking that they're hindering the work of God no because maybe the Holy Spirit came first and caused that but we can't think I have to do this in order to get God to come down and notice it that's not it all he says don't don't do that you interfere with faith there you interfere with God come up reverently and just lay your hand up and believe that's all all God need is an open vessel that's all he needs can we get empty enough so that God can fill us that's all that's our only challenge Faith you don't work yourself up to it faith is something that's already in your heart how did it get there God put it there you just come and believe and he says it's just the Simplicity of it one of the types of faith in the Bible is from the Old Testament story of The Exodus where the death angel was going through the land and Moses told the children of Israel put Blood on the doorpost so a lamb was slain typing Christ who was slain for us and then they had to take a brush of some sort and put the apply the apply the blood to the doorpost well they didn't have Sherwin-Williams paint brushes back then what they did have was a field Full Of Weeds they just went cut a bunch of those weeds up tied it up and then they'd dip all those weeds in the blood and wipe it up there all the these weeds were called hyssop and brother Brahm his hyssop is a type of Faith readily accessible free all you gotta do is go get it that's how simple faith is you have to go buy it somewhere just walked out grabbed it off the ground tied it up and used it that's how simple faith is the message works his faith expressed there's no faith as a revelation he's revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you never had Faith it's given to you by the grace of God because you know what if we can work ourselves up into faith when we're feeling we're on the mountains we've got faith we're in The Valleys we don't got no faith and we go up and down up and down because a Christian shouldn't be tossed about like that we can't work ourselves up into faith we can't work our way into God's favor we can't work our way out of God's favor we're a son and daughter of God I'll love my son or daughter if they're a good boy or girl if they're a bad boy or girl if they get another home from the teacher they got they should get busted for something I still love them it doesn't matter it's nothing you did you think it's beautiful that faith is completely a gift of God the Bible says it and we forget it a lot of times why because just like in that picture me and age still today Satan's trying to put a little drop of work into the pure Waters of faith now what's neat is that God not only gives us his faith he says let me use the faith let me be the one who operates it we see this in Colossians 2 12. is buried with him in baptism wherein ye also are Arisen with him through the faith of the operation of God who uses the faith who quickens the faith God is the one who operates the faith we don't God gives it to us and then he'll use it in us we think that we've got to use it in some sort of way no God gives it to us he'll operate it because he's the one who really knows how to operate it our confidence is not in the strength of our prayer it's in the strength of God's promise we see a quote here on the bottom of page five brother branham's praying says God not with confidence in my prayer but confident in your promise no matter how little it is what it is how weak our prayer is you promised it Christ sometimes we think oh somebody could just pray for me this really I just have this nice strong sounding spiritual sounding prayer that that that that that that'll make it to Heaven no we don't have confidence in the strength of our prayer it has nothing to do with how strong our prayers is Satan I think with the brand is the weakest Saint on his knees causes hell to tremble it doesn't matter how how strong our prayer is and just imagine you've got this little core that you're trying to plug into an outlet this little chord Is Us so so weak we can't do anything but as soon as we get plugged into the outlet it doesn't matter how weak the court is how afraid the cord might be but once we're in the outlet in contact with Christ by faith man it's gonna work it's going to work so it doesn't we don't have confidence in our prayer anything that we do it's confidence in Christ and in his promises and then there's a whole series of quotes I want to share with you where brother Branham talks about how faith is an unconscious thing where we can have faith and maybe not even know it and the message he swore by himself he's saying listen I'm going to say something his look faith is unconscious you believe that I've learned that in years of travel around the world and meeting peoples of all different walks faith is unconscious you got faith and don't even know it that's right and that can blow our minds sometimes you think man if somebody has Faith they know it they'll come under expectation they'll come under expectation they'll expect their names to be called out by the prophet because they're coming with expectation if you expect something you you have a reasonable I can't avoid using the word expectation that it'll be fulfilled but he says you can Faith is unconscious you have it and might not even know it I said Jesus was unconscious of anything around him he says he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I fast long enough wonder if I did this he just walked on right unconscious and Jesus Is Our Lord but he's also our elder brother he's giving us the pattern for how we should walk with the Lord now we hear people so many people say well if I only had faith Faith doesn't mean long drawn-out prayer meetings we think that sometimes because no faith doesn't mean that it doesn't mean long fast faith is an unconscious thing your real Faith your unconscious of it you don't know the faith you've got it's an unconscious matter with you if we could just re once God started doing work on their lives we can just rest because everything brother Branham talks about the apple and that that seed everything that that seed needs to come and become an apple is Right within it everything you need to come to Perfection God has already put within you if you just get in his atmosphere except all the nutrients of the sun and the water it's going to grow into a beautiful apple tree and produce fruit it's going to all you have to do is just relax and that's the hardest thing in the world to relax the devil tries to get this thing I got to do something I gotta do something good no just relax let go let God have his wonderful way and I got to thinking about this particular quote and I got to thinking about uh our perception of faith can be the very things that brother Branham says isn't we think faith means a long drawn out for a meeting Faith me and that's nothing wrong I love those things but that doesn't mean that once I've done that then I've got faith and I got to thinking about this story of Elijah there on Mount Carmel and you know at the very beginning of the day the prophets of Baal come around there and the prophets of Baal they had Church they come in the morning all morning long all afternoon long they might have had a 12-hour church service and they had people doing all kinds of things in their church service it looked they were in the spirit they were caught up in the moment and they it was loud it was all kinds of things it looked like to the outward Observer they're having church and they're gonna but what are they doing at all by Elijah spoke and fight at him the whole time says my play a little bit louder get that tambourine a little louder maybe maybe God's fallen asleep maybe maybe he had to go to the John you just got to go go a little bit longer he's doing all that maybe he's on vacation be a little louder a little louder and they just and he just he just gets them going what he's doing he's poking exactly what the weaknesses you think you better do something to get your God's attention that's how all Antichrist systems are going to work you've got to do something to get your God's attention instruments we think the same thing what did Elijah have to do to get this God's attention I did this one time and the chapel server had the if you just the prophets of Bill were there for at least 12 hours and if you take a stopwatch and time his prayer it's just 63 words he just says Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that you are God in Israel and I am your servant and I've done all these things that you were Hear Me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and you have turned their heart back in amen came right there with fire prayed probably less than the minute didn't look spiritual no volume no great speakers no singing no nothing that we associate with let's have church all he did he prayed and the fire fell like that and it just showed everything all human will and exertion was poured out in the altar of Baal for nothing all they allowed you to do just pray Lord we need you would you come just show your power tonight amen boom Elijah did nothing to marry God's attention God just goes there and shows what it is how do we in our mind think we have to approach God sometimes we think we've got to pray like the prophets of Baal did we got to pray along with the prophets build it be more sincere than the prophets of Baal have better this and the prophets of Bill better than that no we just got to pray that's it it's just that simple amen the message Queen of Sheba says how many's been in the meetings raise your hands now and seen this done raise your hands everywhere certainly certainly it's perfect it's God sometimes people have more faith than they think they have you try to make yourself have faith in God Winnie the Pooh faith faith faith no don't do that just humble yourself there's a man sitting right there the light still around them right there didn't it surprised him that he had that much faith that's right but he had it isn't that right sir if that's right raise up your hand yes the man that's healed right down there that's right it surprised you you don't think you have it but it's just simple just believe it and we think that to have faith we're going to come in and inspecting he's going to call me tonight yes I told you he was going to and God honored my faith that's not how it works think about when Jesus tells this parable of a of a public and who goes in to the temple to pray and the Publican is there praying praying praying and then after the public and comes in there's this Pharisee who comes and the Pharisee comes in they just Praises loud spiritual sounding prayer and Jesus asked the question which one do you think Was Heard by God which one looked like the spiritual prayer or the the Pharisee and the I think the more conscious we are of how spiritual we are the less spiritual it probably is because the public and he wasn't even aware of any kind of good thing or any kind of faithful thing he'd done he just thinks Lord help me Lord and that was about all the prayers he could get out nobody even sees it he doesn't even he he he despises his own prayer probably he thinks my prayer is not good enough isn't he in the back of his as he's praying he can hear in the back this public this Pharisee praying he said oh no he's taking up all the bandwidth now my prayer is not going to get through it's not going to make it that's what the public can probably think I don't have a chance because I don't pray well enough but he was absolutely unconscious of anything he could be doing that could be pleasing to God and that kind of faith that kind of prayer gets right into God's presence because that's God's faith working nothing of our own will nothing ever own exertion brother Branham says lady second lady from the end there elderly lady with a pair of glasses on look looking this way you've got you got low blood pressure you believe Jesus Christ would heal you sister you that sitting there on a pink cushion looking at me with a spotted dress on say looking up yes see how hard he has to work to get your attention you believe that Christ will make you well raise up your hand if you believe it all right accept it then amen see how unconscious faith is the woman sitting there thinking in her heart so much that she didn't even hear me talking to her that's right but you see God spoke to her she's so busy in her own thoughts yet she still has faith that got through despite herself because it wasn't her faith it was God's faith and the message here he him on page six what do you think sitting there on the end of the seat sir suffering with Qatar you believe Christ will make you well all right if you believe it you can have it that scared you you didn't know you had that much faith faith is an unconscious thing just have faith and believe and again we think if we someone has Faith they're not going to be scared of anything God does they're expecting it when God actually come to the person they didn't they weren't aware of how much God was listening to their heart the call of their heart when God answers their call it it scares them but they had Faith they didn't realize how much Faith they had message greater than Solomon he says your faith is unconscious don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you just relax yourself and believe just believe now and have faith amen and be reverent just have faith just believe sometimes your faith is unconscious you have it and you don't know it that little woman had it and she didn't know it we underestimate if God started working in our heart we underestimate the power of that once God started working there that will change you all the way to Kingdom Come it starts the work he continues the work he finishes the work nothing you have to do just continue with continue walking with him it'll be a done work that's why in the Old Testament so much longer the New Testament the New Testament only one thing you have to tell they came to the Lord and that was it because the rest of the journey was assured he says super sign what about the balcony somebody believe you believe it that he's the same now I see a woman she don't even realize she's got that Faith it's a hidden Faith she don't even confess it She's suffering with a headache sitting here looking at me right up here a Mrs singer surprised you didn't it your headache's Gonna Leave You Now now you tell your critics to answer that and we've talked about how faith is a gift of God that is Faith of the operation of God these people didn't even realize they had the faith but God gave it to him and God operates the faith we don't operate the faith if it depended upon being able to operate the faith well enough to get to heaven we'd have a lot of crashes along the way it doesn't depend upon us operating the faith faith is a gift brother Raymond says a true gift is just getting yourself out of the way so that God gives it and he can operate it he uses it on page seven in the message blasphemy misnames brother Branham talks about mental faith and we can we we can hear that man I've got so much mental faith and but I'm talking you have to have a spiritual Faith but how can I transform my mental faith into a spiritual faith I I just can't do it but he says the biggest part of our faith is mental faith and this I hear Brothers I feel a little bit better now because yeah that is the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith but by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God yes I recognize that but if this coming from above if it ever strikes this Faith then that transforms it to a Godly spiritual faith you can't transform your mental faith into a spiritual faith God does that all you do is put yourself in the right place listening to the right thing and it'll it'll happen we don't have anything to do with it Christ does that work into US it says when the word is pouring itself into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual revelation and I love this from an ordered ones at the end time it's in the middle of page seven because sometimes we can be be praying for something whether it be the baptism of the Holy Ghost whatever it might be let's say it's the Baptist of the Holy Ghost do you believe that if you've repented him and baptized is it God's will to fill you with the Holy Spirit yes Acts 2 38 says if you've done these things you've repented God's going to do it it is it is his will maybe it hasn't happened yet but if it's his will it's going to happen brother Branham says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so maybe it hasn't happened yet but you believe this is God's will for me I'm still having faith in expecting it because God it's God's promise maybe as an app dip I'm going to keep on waiting for it because God will provide God will keep his promise I'm not depending upon the strength of my prayer I'm depending upon the strength of the promise and God's promises you can take those to the bank true faith is getting yourself out of the way it's relaxing yourself getting yourself out of the way then God comes in and uses you the way he wants to but we've talked about this evening the faith being a gift of God of the operation of God and unconscious faith that it's working in us without us being involved in the process at all I think it's just such a these prayer lines such a good illustration of how what these scriptures are describing and showing how these scriptures work in practice but it's the opposite of what Paul calls will worship in Colossians chapter 2. here he says wherefore if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world or the principles of the world if you're dead with Christ why as though living in the world are you subject to ordinances or laws like touch not taste not handle not all these are to perish with the using why are you doing this these are Commandments and doctrines of men which things happen to eat a show of wisdom and a will worship the most self-disciplined person can look like they're a really holy person because they're able to keep themselves from this not do this not do this it has a show of wisdom and a will worship because I've got a strong enough will where I'm going to keep myself I'm gonna I'm gonna keep myself from feeding the animals inside me I'm gonna keep myself from doing this wrong thing that wrong thing that that wrong thing it looks like I'm living a good Christian life but it's all because I've been able to concentrate my will and keep myself in check and there are some people who are pretty pretty strong-willed people and can live at what looks like a really holy life for a long time but remember it's not by human will or exertion and eventually things are going to happen even in their lives where they just get tired and all of a sudden they just stop because I've done it for so long I'm just worn out I want to break and then that what in the world happened all that time we thought they were walking with the Lord and had the real thing it was just there they were really worshiping their own will so I how strong they were they having a show of wisdom and will worship humility neglecting the body but not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh that's not what it is it looks like it could be a good thing but the more aware that we are of our own spirituality the less spiritual it probably is it's a lot more rap and a lot less of Christ the more I am aware of what it is a page a page eight it's kind of wrapping things up here emphasizing that the whole thing is by Grace from repentance to Rapture it's all by Grace um let me read one more quote just just above that in the world falling apart and just kind of I read I read this quote already how we Christianity is not something we have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve to get something from the Lord you don't do it by works by grace brother Brandon talks in world falling apart here um how it's a good prayer to pray Lord your will be done and sometimes people like man pray your lord your will be done that's a faithless prayer because we should be telling God what we need from and expecting him to do it instead of just praying Lord your will be done and he says um thy kingdom come thy will be done he says where do we find that kind of prayer being prayed we're always wanting God to run errands for us or do something for us but when we're willing to say thy will be done commit ourselves to our ways to him all that we are committed to him that's when God will move when you're willing to let him work on you not you work on him sometimes those prayers that we think are so strong and powerful they're an exertion of our will trying to get God's will to do what we want them to do but he says God moves when we're willing to let him work on us not us work on him let him tell you not you tell him and twist it around because how we can get things so messed up in our prayer lives and we pray what seems to be such a strong prayer of faith and we can say a declaration I believe the Lord is going to do this or this or this if God hasn't told you that you can get in some big trouble there because you raise expectation that that's going to happen but that is your word and not God's word and we've asked God please do but we can't tell God to do it we're twisting things around and we're putting ourselves out there's God I want you to do this work of healing now hurry up because it's they're hurting bad no God's on the throne and we can say no we we've committed this to him and trust and and we're and we're trusting ourselves to him I love I think the three Hebrew boys they have such a good Declaration of faith nebuchadne they're coming before Nebuchadnezzar and he says Nebuchadnezzar we don't know what God's going to do but even if you throw us into this furnace and he doesn't get us out of there he's going to get us out of your hand one way or the other they didn't say in the name of Jehovah we're going to come out of those Flames alive they didn't say that that would have gotten lots of amens but they didn't say that because they didn't they must not have had thus Seth Lord I don't know why they didn't say but they didn't but they give us an example we know what's going to happen but we're going to step out and trust God that he'll take care of us that is Faith because they were letting God work on them without them having to work on God so what I just see here why is Faith so important to God it's of faith that it might be by Grace there were they were through anything else than Faith it'd be because of an ounce of your will or an ounce of your exertion but it's by faith so that it can be entirely completely 100 percent by grace and um again I just want to hark back uh one thing I said this is closing here from repentance to Rapture it's all great unless we get the idea in their minds I know I'm saved by grace but I pray Lord I can be good enough that that day when you come in the Rapture I hope I'm walking with you that day because I I hi I'm not good enough we think we have to be good enough for the Rapture or something but it's all Grace how is Enoch translated Hebrews 11 says by faith Enoch was translated did he have faith none of us have faith faith is the gift of God that God uses yeah the raptures of Revelation as well you can't give yourself Revelation it's all Grace First Corinthians 15 says I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep we shall all be changed the Rapture is that last step that God is changing us so every day that we're walking with the Lord he changes a little bit today a little bit tomorrow a little bit tomorrow a little bit the next day each of those little changes are connecting us to that Monumental change that's just coming but that Monumental change is nothing without the little changes happening each and every day don't live just for the Rapture live for God today because he's changing us now he's changing us tomorrow and one day he's going to change us for the last time we're going to be in his presence it's all by grace the Rapture is the last step of our Earthly walk with God all the changes God's working out now in our lives from carnal to spiritual are our connection to that climactic change for mortality and mortality walk with God each and every day amen come on up musicians and this pergamian age brother Branham says where men were humanizing salvation and that's what's still being done today the devil has done everything he can to humanize Salvation some way to make us think you've got something to do with it and the more that we think we have to do with it the more we just get in the way but he says human Faith wasn't enough then and it's not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands Paul didn't say he lived by by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the son of God is from last time the devil wants us to have this kind of cliff-hanging relationship with God for we can I can just hold on long enough I'll make it they were surviving on their own will our own exertion but here we're connected to the Faith of Christ his faith is what's holding us and we can rest in that let's pray heavenly father I thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I thank you Father for all the ways that you worked in the brother Brandon's Ministry to show how Faith worked and there was just such an encouragement to me all the people there who you spoke to and he said you had faith and even realized you had faith and how often do we feel so faithless sometimes but after you've started a work in US you put your faith in us I pray Lord that you would help us to take our hands off the wheel not try to have you as our co-pilot let you operate the faith use it Quicken it Lord bring us all the way home oh God lord and I pray there are those who are just um Lord strung out and not sure um where they are with you Lord or or thinking I just hope I'm good enough Lord I pray that you might bring them into a rest a real true rest or they can just rest in your promises and stop trying to to think their way and believe their way and manufacture enough Faith they can just rest that you would do a mighty work complete that in them oh God bring us into your rest I pray in Jesus name amen could we
