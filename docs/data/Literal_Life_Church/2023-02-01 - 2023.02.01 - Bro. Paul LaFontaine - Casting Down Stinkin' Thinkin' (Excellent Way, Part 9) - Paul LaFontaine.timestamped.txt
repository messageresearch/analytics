[0:00] that we ended come off of them from
[0:02] Sunday and just break it down a little
[0:04] bit tonight in this Wednesday service we
[0:06] welcome all of you it's good to be in
[0:08] his house and we appreciate the the
[0:10] spirit of entering into worship and
[0:13] inviting our Lord to come and do what he
[0:15] feels and is wants to do tonight in this
[0:18] service God bless you well the devil's
[0:20] on the run I'll tell you after Sunday
[0:22] the devil's on the run and I think with
[0:24] the service and also sister amariah's
[0:27] testimony online and her song I'm
[0:31] telling you it dealt a deadly blow to
[0:33] the enemy I'm telling you it dealt a
[0:35] deadly blow we're hearing testimonies
[0:37] from a lot of places we don't give glory
[0:40] to man or to sister and Mariah but I'll
[0:43] tell you when someone Rises to the
[0:45] occasion and says I'm going to give the
[0:47] devil a black eye I'm going to speak
[0:49] about what God's done we're getting a
[0:51] lot of response and I think the devil's
[0:53] angry
[0:54] that's her job right can he say man to
[0:57] defeat him and make him angry praise be
[0:59] to God good to be with you tonight
[1:01] second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[1:04] 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:08] not war after the flesh
[1:10] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:13] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:15] pulling down of strongholds and that's a
[1:19] reference to something in war where you
[1:22] have strongholds we have walls in the
[1:24] Old Testament different things that are
[1:25] are blocking us and so we have a power
[1:29] within the word and within the spirit of
[1:31] God that will pull down strongholds and
[1:34] we're thankful for that but remember we
[1:36] don't walk in the flesh we are we are
[1:38] fleshly we are human we make mistakes
[1:41] can you say Amen so but though he said
[1:43] we walk in the flesh verse three we do
[1:45] not war after the flesh so we cannot
[1:47] fight demons with fleshly power
[1:51] we can't respond to demonic forces and
[1:55] what Satan brings us with just an
[1:57] intellect or something human it has to
[1:59] be something more powerful so even
[2:01] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[2:03] war after the flesh weapons of our
[2:05] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[2:07] through God to the pulling down of
[2:09] strongholds casting down imaginations
[2:11] and every High thing that exalteth
[2:15] itself against the knowledge of God and
[2:18] bringing into captivity every thought to
[2:20] The Obedience of Christ and having an a
[2:24] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[2:27] when your obedience is fulfilled that's
[2:30] quite a statement in itself that having
[2:32] a Readiness we're prepared to Revenge
[2:34] all uh all Disobedience so no that now
[2:39] that's you know we talk about revenge
[2:41] we're not supposed to take revenge on
[2:43] our own hands towards someone else but
[2:45] any Disobedience that's in our life
[2:47] Disobedience and our thoughts that's
[2:50] something we can take revenge John and
[2:52] come against so the whole thought here
[2:54] is as Paul's thought to be able to bring
[2:57] these thoughts captive to him to be
[3:00] ready to Revenge all Disobedience and
[3:03] that our obedience was fulfilled I
[3:04] personally believe this scripture speaks
[3:06] of a final Victory also uh in when he
[3:09] says when your obedience is fulfilled
[3:11] someday your complete obedience will be
[3:14] fulfilled
[3:15] can you say man the bride is going to
[3:17] fulfill a complete obedience and I
[3:19] believe she's going to recognize her
[3:21] position and when she fully does she'll
[3:23] take a Rapture Lord bless your word
[3:25] tonight anoint it be with us in this
[3:27] teaching and we pray you'll bless those
[3:29] that are here that have come and those
[3:30] that are listening we pray that you'll
[3:32] use us Lord and may we receive your
[3:34] unction your ministering Spirit from
[3:37] your throne to speak through us tonight
[3:38] we humbly submit to it in Jesus name
[3:41] amen God bless you may be seated
[3:45] I just trust that all this from last
[3:47] Sunday and speaking about these things
[3:49] would be more than a lesson to us and
[3:51] more than just a teaching but I trust
[3:55] that we can take the things home and
[3:56] apply them everything that we speak we
[3:59] want to be able to apply it we want to
[4:01] be able to use it against the enemy and
[4:04] so I trust that you would take these
[4:06] these Sundays and these Wednesday nights
[4:08] and these lessons as more than a lesson
[4:10] and more than a teaching but it's it's
[4:13] to be applied and to Echo what I said
[4:15] Sunday when the love of God moves us
[4:17] then we need to go without and we need
[4:20] to watch what it does can you say Amen
[4:22] when the love of God moves you you need
[4:25] to go with that and go because we need
[4:27] to trust that and then watch what the
[4:29] love of God can do supernaturally and
[4:32] don't let your thinking talk you out of
[4:35] it
[4:36] do you know that your thinking can talk
[4:38] you out of good things that's supposed
[4:40] to come your way
[4:41] your fears can influence your thinking
[4:44] and talk you out of something really
[4:46] good that's supposed to happen to you
[4:48] God's sending something your way and you
[4:50] can talk yourself out of it
[4:52] amen so think about how powerful that is
[4:54] that's what what will speak of but we
[4:56] don't want to let our thinking interrupt
[4:58] and we want to apply in every situation
[5:01] during during the day uh what we're what
[5:04] we're we're learning can you say Amen
[5:05] that love is flowing through us it
[5:07] should flow out of us and that we need
[5:09] to apply it to every situation my
[5:11] problem I don't know if it's your
[5:12] problem but there's certain situations
[5:13] come up I'll Resort back to I'll figure
[5:16] this one out myself but but we're
[5:18] supposed to say Lord but now here's
[5:20] another situation I'm speaking to my
[5:22] child I'm speaking to this one or that
[5:24] one or speaking to someone else and
[5:26] every situation we just lay back say now
[5:29] what would the love of God want to say
[5:31] here I was going through the Valvoline
[5:34] Instant Oil last night and doing getting
[5:36] my oil changed and my mom's van there
[5:39] and so I won't be long on this but I was
[5:42] just sitting there and when I told him
[5:44] it was a church related vehicle this
[5:46] young man this young man just began to
[5:48] really talk to me and I told him as a
[5:49] church but the talk was very bitter uh
[5:52] he let me know clearly he was an atheist
[5:54] he let me know he grew up in a
[5:56] Conservative Christian Home In Georgia
[5:57] and said well you don't have an accent
[5:59] anymore and he'd only been here just a
[6:01] few years I said usually my wife she
[6:03] still has her accent you know and he
[6:04] said he don't have that well that just
[6:06] opened up and then he talked about his
[6:07] the legalism of his childhood and his
[6:10] parents and just he went on and on and
[6:12] on and on and luckily he had other guys
[6:15] working on my car to get the job done
[6:16] but he just talked and so then you know
[6:19] this is how I thought and just being
[6:21] honest with you not my first thought was
[6:23] that that's a ton of scriptures came to
[6:26] me that I could address this I could
[6:27] correct this I could respond quickly
[6:29] because you know I've fed on the word
[6:31] since I was 16 years old and that was
[6:33] the first but I just sat back and said
[6:35] no wait a minute this is an opportunity
[6:37] to say what what's God want to do here
[6:39] instead of just giving a bunch of
[6:41] scriptures and he might associate we me
[6:44] with his family and his childhood and I
[6:46] said Lord what are you doing here
[6:47] because this man's really opening up to
[6:49] me and I don't know him from from
[6:50] anybody and he just really is letting me
[6:53] have it he didn't know as a pastor but
[6:55] you know I was a church related and he
[6:56] just kept getting going and I said I
[6:58] said well isn't it interesting I said I
[7:00] thought the Lord led me to say this
[7:01] isn't it interesting that God you're an
[7:03] atheist Now isn't it bad that somehow in
[7:06] this world God has to be tainted by some
[7:09] bad things that the church does
[7:12] it's too bad that God got tainted for
[7:14] you because to me God should be separate
[7:18] than that he's pure he doesn't have
[7:20] anything to hurt you but yet you
[7:22] associate it with that you know I just
[7:24] said that's too bad and then he went on
[7:25] and on he did all the talking and uh
[7:27] kept going and I said what what was it
[7:30] what was the re what's the real deal
[7:31] he's showing me a tattoo of joining
[7:33] Satan's church and all of it's in
[7:35] retaliation let my parents know I mean
[7:37] it this this guy was he was a friendly
[7:40] guy but man was he ever bitter and I
[7:42] just said nor let my love reach out to
[7:45] this young man what do you want to say
[7:48] to him and I just begin to feel I'm
[7:49] going to just to say a few things I told
[7:51] him I appreciate you sharing your heart
[7:53] I knew I'd be through there again I said
[7:55] I'll see you next time and just plant
[7:57] the sea a few seeds there that's what I
[7:59] felt to do but I said what was it what's
[8:01] really what what happened he said I'll
[8:03] tell you he said
[8:04] he said the church was trying to be put
[8:07] on such a such a front to everybody and
[8:09] make me put it on he said when I was
[8:11] molested sexually by my uh by uncles or
[8:15] whoever it was as a little boy the
[8:16] church covered that up they wouldn't
[8:18] talk about it they wouldn't deal with it
[8:19] they wouldn't preach against it and he
[8:22] says that's what I said I and you know
[8:23] what fella I understand how you feel
[8:26] because I said that should never happen
[8:29] and so he still was very cold and
[8:31] everything but you know what I got a
[8:32] chance to say a few things and I'm
[8:35] trying to look past as the prophet of
[8:37] God was led to do just to look past all
[8:40] the front of all the bitterness and look
[8:42] past and the way he was talking to me
[8:44] it's almost like he felt like that he
[8:47] was reaching out for something and
[8:49] unsettled and that's what I said and so
[8:52] I I'm going to say I'm going to leave
[8:54] and leave him with some good words and
[8:55] I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for him
[8:58] I'm going to prayer for and I don't know
[9:00] his name I wouldn't say it here tonight
[9:01] but I'm going to pray for him so every
[9:04] everything nothing should be left out of
[9:07] in our lives of something we come up
[9:09] against
[9:10] of praying saying now Lord how do you
[9:12] want your what that which is within me
[9:14] to come out in this situation it might
[9:17] be your husband in an argument with your
[9:18] husband
[9:20] may not be the guy at Valvoline it might
[9:23] be your husband or wife
[9:24] so we need to think about that can you
[9:26] say man now if we look at our text
[9:28] tonight in second Corinthians 10 the
[9:30] subject that Paul brings out here is
[9:32] actually first related to Paul being
[9:35] misread by uh a few Believers and so
[9:39] This Is How They misread him back in the
[9:41] first scriptures if you want to break it
[9:43] down in second Corinthians chapter 10 he
[9:45] said I Paul myself beseech you by the
[9:47] meekness and gentleness of Christ who Am
[9:49] presence and base among you
[9:52] but being absent and bold towards you
[9:54] I'm going to pick it up in the Amplified
[9:55] and read it so I want you to catch why
[9:58] Paul's writing this chapter and the
[10:00] theme behind it it's it's some Believers
[10:02] that were Mis uh misunderstanding Paul
[10:04] and this is how they must understood him
[10:06] uh now I Paul urge you to buy the
[10:08] gentleness and graciousnesses of Christ
[10:09] I who am meek he said now I who am meek
[10:14] so they say when I'm with you face to
[10:16] face but bold outspoken and fearless
[10:18] towards you when I'm absent so it's not
[10:20] he said that they're actually
[10:22] criticizing some Believers and saying
[10:24] Paul he's so different when he's in the
[10:26] Pulpit he's so different when he's face
[10:28] to face and he's so he's so humble and
[10:30] he's just so gentle about things but the
[10:32] letters we're getting from him my
[10:34] goodness he's raking us over the goals
[10:37] and they were they were clearly
[10:39] misunderstanding his love and
[10:41] misunderstanding him and these were
[10:43] Believers that were doing that and he
[10:45] goes on to say then he says they say
[10:48] when you when you're face to face you're
[10:50] humble and meek but bold when you're out
[10:53] smoking a Fearless when you write us
[10:54] your letters I ask that when I do come I
[10:57] will not be driven to the boldness that
[10:59] I intend to show towards those those few
[11:02] who regard us as if we walked to the
[11:06] flesh like men without the spirit so he
[11:09] discerned that these guys were being
[11:11] these brothers were being carnal about
[11:12] how they were viewing Paul and he said
[11:15] when I come I'm praying that I won't be
[11:17] driven to be bold towards those men and
[11:20] also the the how they've misread me for
[11:23] though then he goes into for though we
[11:25] walk in the flesh as mortal men we are
[11:27] human we are mortal men we are we are we
[11:31] have mortal weakness can you say Amen we
[11:34] are not but we are not carrying on our
[11:37] spiritual warfare according to the Flesh
[11:40] and using the weapons of man so they
[11:43] were misreading Paul in what he was
[11:45] saying that somehow it was some carnal
[11:47] agenda that he what he was saying uh in
[11:50] his letters to them and uh I I just
[11:53] could just tell you I have been there
[11:55] and done that and I feel that feeling
[11:57] sometimes people misread your motives
[11:59] and misread the things that you're
[12:01] saying and sometimes would even take it
[12:03] personal and I never intend to want to
[12:05] do that if I do it I apologize for it
[12:08] but I not never want to intend to do
[12:10] that but you know I've met ministers and
[12:12] you can sit across the table from them
[12:14] and you you can't hardly get a word out
[12:17] on they're just so quiet uh and they're
[12:19] just they don't hardly say nothing you
[12:21] can't hardly fuss with because they're
[12:22] just so humble and so quiet we see
[12:24] humble is quiet that's what we associate
[12:26] it with
[12:27] and and but then you see them in the
[12:29] Pulpit just as bold and you know just
[12:33] say it like it is you know and so
[12:35] sometimes the anointing will bring a
[12:37] minister to do that and he's saying
[12:40] things that might appear carnally to you
[12:42] that might hurtful but you don't want to
[12:45] take it as hurtful you want to say this
[12:47] may be the Lord speaking to me
[12:50] but you know he goes on to say here
[12:53] for though we walk in the flesh we are
[12:55] not carrying our Warfare according to
[12:57] the Flesh and using the weapons of man
[12:58] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[13:00] physical weapons of Flesh and Blood our
[13:02] weapons are divinely powerful for the
[13:06] destruction of fortresses we are
[13:08] destroying listen to this we are
[13:11] destroying sophisticated arguments and
[13:14] every exalted and proud thing that sets
[13:18] itself up against the true knowledge of
[13:21] God we are warring against sophisticated
[13:24] arguments on the internet today
[13:28] that's what we're warning at but we're
[13:30] not warring against it with reasoning or
[13:32] or the spirit of argument can you say
[13:34] man we're coming at it with the love of
[13:37] God and the weapons of our Warfare are
[13:39] our spiritual not carnal you can't fight
[13:42] anger with anger
[13:44] you can't fight carnality with carnality
[13:46] you can't fight an evil spirit with
[13:49] another evil spirit you can't do that it
[13:51] has to be something greater than that
[13:53] evil spirit and so I loved how he this
[13:56] is worded in the Amplified we're
[13:57] destroying the sophisticated arguments
[14:00] and every exalted and proud thing that
[14:02] sets itself against the knowledge of God
[14:04] and we are taking every thought and
[14:07] purpose captive to The Obedience of
[14:10] Christ being ready to punish Every Act
[14:13] of Disobedience when your own obedience
[14:15] as a church is complete so now what we
[14:18] pull out of this section of scripture is
[14:22] something beyond what Paul was saying
[14:24] that these men are judging me carnal he
[14:26] we get the lesson that our the weapons
[14:28] of our Warfare are not carnal they're
[14:30] spiritual and we don't fight back with
[14:32] something carnal Paul's saying I'm a
[14:34] human being being but I can't fight back
[14:36] with something human it has to be
[14:38] something greater than that it has to be
[14:40] the love of God it has to be the the
[14:42] knowledge of God and so now but we take
[14:45] a lesson out of this and what's the
[14:48] lesson we learn Paul is giving the power
[14:52] the the huge power of our own
[14:56] imagination
[14:58] and that's what I want to elaborate on
[15:00] tonight but the the power of our
[15:02] imagination I want to title this if I
[15:05] can the casting down stinking thinking
[15:11] as I mentioned that to you Sunday
[15:12] casting down he said casting down
[15:14] imagination we're casting down stinking
[15:17] thinking because it's stinking thinking
[15:19] that gets in the way of God
[15:21] it's stinking thinking that gets in the
[15:23] way of the love of God and so he's he's
[15:26] catching it down so we want to go a
[15:28] little bit into the power of our
[15:29] imagination and the thoughts that are
[15:32] inside our spirit realm they're not in
[15:34] our soul the mind of Christ is in the
[15:36] soul but but in our spirit realm is
[15:39] memory imagination conscience effects or
[15:40] reasoning and and these things that in
[15:43] our spirit realm if they're not under
[15:45] the control of God they become very
[15:47] powerful to sway a human being even
[15:50] Christians can be swayed by their
[15:53] emotions by their feelings by their
[15:55] imaginations by their own thoughts in
[15:58] their Spirit if they let that rule and
[16:00] Reign it can quench the spirit of God
[16:02] working in your life
[16:04] this is this is our walk with the Lord
[16:05] now it's actually what I believe is
[16:07] being spoken to the bride right now you
[16:09] hear other ministers speaking about it
[16:10] that our power comes when we bring this
[16:14] body under subjection to him that that
[16:16] uh that every channel is cleaned out and
[16:20] ready for service for the Lord that the
[16:22] devil doesn't know what channel to get
[16:24] into
[16:25] that's the victory for the bride then
[16:27] let God do what he wants to do through
[16:28] that but our vessel's got to be
[16:30] submitted to him we can't have a
[16:32] Victorious Life over to the devil if our
[16:34] imaginations are going wild we can't
[16:36] have a Victorious life if we're
[16:37] reasoning with the word all the time we
[16:40] have to bring those things in our spirit
[16:42] under his leadership
[16:45] so the power of our own imagination in
[16:48] our spirit realm and the worst thing
[16:51] about
[16:52] this realm of imagination is when it
[16:55] will exalt itself above the knowledge of
[16:58] God can you imagine the arrogance
[17:00] Lucifer did it at the beginning
[17:05] he got thoughts he was the right-hand
[17:07] angel of God
[17:09] and he got started to have thoughts and
[17:12] those thoughts got him into the
[17:14] different thoughts of lifting himself I
[17:16] will be above the most high can you
[17:18] imagine the arrogance
[17:20] and so his thoughts became so powerful
[17:24] that he actually began to a a connive a
[17:28] plan to somehow bring in and lift
[17:30] himself above the knowledge of God and
[17:33] set himself above God and so now we
[17:36] shouldn't always we know the devil did
[17:38] that but it shows the power of a human
[17:40] mind
[17:42] that can be in us even
[17:44] let me just say it this way if the
[17:46] Lucifer did that at the beginning his
[17:48] own thoughts eventually got so arrogant
[17:50] that I will lift myself above though I
[17:52] would sit as him and be worshiped of God
[17:55] if if if your thoughts
[17:58] exalt itself above the word of God who
[18:02] are you being inspired by
[18:07] who are you being inspired by if the
[18:10] your thoughts can be lifted above the
[18:13] knowledge of God
[18:14] you know who you're inspired by you're
[18:16] already off track
[18:19] so this is you know the worst thing
[18:21] about it is it lifts itself above the
[18:22] knowledge of God that's a serious thing
[18:24] that's a tragic thing when it's happened
[18:26] it's actually to me the worst thing that
[18:29] a Christian can let happen is to let our
[18:32] own thinking or Satan's things thinking
[18:34] lift itself above the knowledge of God
[18:37] what does it do it quenches the spirit
[18:39] of God from moving in you
[18:42] it quenches the spirit of God from
[18:45] moving in the church it stunts your
[18:47] growth
[18:49] it keeps marriages and families from
[18:52] finding that key to get out of the rut
[18:55] that they're in to get out of the spirit
[18:56] that's with them for years it's stunts
[18:59] and it keeps a marriage and family from
[19:02] the key because sometimes there's just a
[19:04] key of faith that unlocks and all of a
[19:07] sudden in a moment's time forgiveness
[19:09] comes in and things are changed and
[19:12] Everything's changed can you say Amen
[19:14] but if our minds interrupt that it
[19:16] quenches that from happening you see and
[19:19] people can live in a miserable marriage
[19:20] for years sometimes even living together
[19:23] living separate but it's because there's
[19:25] something holding them from getting that
[19:27] key that unlocks Faith to change the
[19:30] situation
[19:31] and so when our thoughts lift themselves
[19:35] above the knowledge of God it quenches
[19:36] the love of God it quenches the spirit
[19:38] of God it stunts our growth it it
[19:40] hinders families it brings bondage to
[19:43] marriages and families what what is it
[19:45] your own thinking has the power to do
[19:48] that your own thoughts
[19:51] the power of our own imagination realm
[19:54] I'm going to borrow something a quote
[19:56] that was quoted by brother Donnie last
[19:59] Sunday and I just say this I don't get
[20:01] much time to listen
[20:02] to some of the other brothers I I don't
[20:04] have the time they probably don't have
[20:06] the time but when someone recommends
[20:07] something usually I'll go and listen to
[20:09] it someone recommended the last two
[20:10] Sundays by the Donnie especially last
[20:11] Sunday so we took the time my wife and I
[20:13] to listen to some of it and I'll tell
[20:16] you he brought a quote I'd never knew
[20:18] brother Bram said I'm going to read it
[20:19] to you tonight I don't have it on the
[20:21] board so just listen he says back in
[20:22] 1954 he about imagination I want you to
[20:25] notice the power and the an example of
[20:28] what your imagination can do you just
[20:31] imagine somebody hates you once
[20:35] and they don't hate you
[20:38] but you imagine that they do
[20:42] and you just keep thinking that they
[20:45] don't like me they don't like me
[20:48] they hate me and the first thing you
[20:50] know you'll be shunning that person
[20:55] now it's not reality you don't know if
[20:57] it's truth
[20:58] and brother might say it's not truth
[21:00] they don't hate you but your imagination
[21:01] has made it true and now you're acting
[21:04] upon your imagination that says
[21:06] something true and you're shunning them
[21:08] and they're probably wondering why
[21:09] you're shutting them
[21:11] what's the deal what happened how come
[21:13] they're shutting me well something's
[21:15] happening in your mind in your
[21:17] imagination it's just creating something
[21:21] that's untrue
[21:23] you better all be listening
[21:26] and online you better all be listening
[21:28] preachers deacons everybody ought to be
[21:31] listening because your mind and your
[21:34] imagination has the power to do little
[21:37] things like this and you could go for
[21:39] weeks for months and even years with the
[21:43] wrong Concept in your imagination living
[21:45] it out as if it was true
[21:48] we're not called to do that
[21:51] he said they don't mean first thing you
[21:52] do you'll be shunning that person when
[21:54] they haven't done nothing to you and
[21:56] after a while notice how Brother Martin
[21:58] gives the process here after a while it
[22:00] becomes so a reality to you to you
[22:03] actually believe that that person
[22:05] doesn't like you and you might ball them
[22:09] out or say something to you so now you
[22:12] got one thing that shuns them now you're
[22:14] going to ball them out
[22:16] all these actions now you're going to
[22:18] ball them out so one thing that makes
[22:21] you shun people then you're going to
[22:22] ball them out and so now uh he says here
[22:25] you might ball them out or say something
[22:27] for instance your wife your husband to
[22:29] your neighbor or something like that
[22:30] when the person the person is absolutely
[22:33] innocent of any ill thing
[22:36] it's because that you just imagine it so
[22:40] till it become a reality to you
[22:45] how powerful is your imagination
[22:50] it can take you so well I'm a Christian
[22:52] that doesn't happen to me really
[22:55] you're a Christian you got the holy
[22:56] ghost in your soul but the rest of you
[22:58] is not born again
[22:59] your imagination is not born again your
[23:01] reasoning is not born again your memory
[23:03] is not born again your soul is born
[23:05] again but the rest of you two-thirds of
[23:07] you is still unconverted
[23:11] and will be till we hit a rapture
[23:14] so the overcoming power of a Believer is
[23:16] to take that power and that which is in
[23:19] the soul that has the power of God to
[23:21] live an overcoming life let it flow out
[23:24] and take over the mind and the spirit
[23:26] and say no you're not allowed to think
[23:28] that way imagination you're not allowed
[23:31] to imagine anything that's not true and
[23:33] I'm going to use it for the sake of the
[23:35] Lord and you know people do that they
[23:36] use their imagination inspiration and
[23:39] things for the kingdom of God
[23:41] and God gets glory for it
[23:44] but when it's under the anointing of
[23:46] Satan even as a Christian it becomes
[23:49] damaging to the body of Christ and
[23:51] damaging to your life
[23:53] it has such power to it and don't you
[23:56] put this off to your grandmother or
[23:58] grandfather every one of you had the
[24:00] realm of imagination here tonight and
[24:01] are capable and you probably have done
[24:04] the very thing that he's talking about
[24:06] tonight that you have imagined something
[24:09] that hates you and they must hate me and
[24:12] the next week they do hate me and you
[24:15] either shun them or you ball them out
[24:17] and everybody's wondering who has the
[24:19] problem here and the problem is your
[24:21] imagination
[24:23] nobody likes me nobody everybody hates
[24:25] me nobody will talk to me
[24:27] when are you going to quit listening to
[24:29] your own thoughts
[24:31] and start believing the truth
[24:35] I thought that was so powerful
[24:38] and there's an example after example I
[24:39] hadn't seen that one but man it's so
[24:42] true that they somebody hates me they
[24:44] don't hate you okay now there's people
[24:47] who do hate you
[24:50] there is people who do hate you
[24:53] but guess what the love of God
[24:56] is the answer
[24:58] for both
[25:02] so there's no sense in getting nervous
[25:04] when somebody does hate you and you know
[25:05] it the way they're acting they're
[25:07] slapping you in the face and they're
[25:09] there's demons coming out of them and
[25:11] they're vicious with you okay this
[25:14] person hates me
[25:16] what's the answer the love of God
[25:18] it's still a love of God
[25:20] we still got to overcome it
[25:22] we still got to respond right
[25:24] so but this is so powerful that the
[25:27] other end of it is that and I've often
[25:29] said people live in such fear of what's
[25:32] going to happen tomorrow that uh it
[25:35] hasn't even happened yet and they're
[25:37] living as if it's already happened
[25:40] we'll get into that a little bit more
[25:42] tonight so this is how powerful it is it
[25:44] becomes so real and you call it truth
[25:46] and you conclude then when you conclude
[25:49] in your mind that it's true then you go
[25:51] to some extremes then it becomes it can
[25:54] become so concrete and I don't have the
[25:56] word for this I'm just using concrete
[25:58] some of your thoughts can become so
[26:00] poured with concrete that they are there
[26:03] for life and there's nothing that will
[26:06] change that thought you are determined I
[26:09] will always think that may about that
[26:11] person I will always and it becomes
[26:13] concrete nothing can move it even the
[26:16] spirit of God himself is quenched and
[26:18] has a hard time changing that concrete
[26:21] thought
[26:23] it becomes so embedded in your thinking
[26:26] and it's so true and it's so concrete
[26:29] that you're and people say I will never
[26:32] I will never be careful of those words
[26:36] I will never respond to that person
[26:38] again I will never do that again we've
[26:41] got a case here with a mom and a sister
[26:44] in this church that testified brought
[26:45] her mom a few weeks ago and that's where
[26:47] she coming after her early years with
[26:49] her mom what she did to her and listen
[26:52] friends the love of God through this
[26:54] series and through the holy spirit said
[26:56] you can't do that letter in a different
[26:58] direction invite her to church and
[27:00] trying to find some grounds to even
[27:02] though she's she maybe don't have the
[27:04] Lord yet to find some grounds to love
[27:05] her I'll tell you that's beyond human
[27:07] can you say man that's when the love of
[27:10] God broke up that concrete thought and
[27:12] say I will never talk to her again I
[27:15] will never do that yet only the love of
[27:17] God breaks the concrete and says oh no
[27:19] you can't be concrete like that crushes
[27:22] our own thoughts it says let me give you
[27:24] another thought
[27:26] there is a power that can change your
[27:28] thinking and break the concrete
[27:31] some people are so concrete and stubborn
[27:35] oh I'm not preaching about any I'm sure
[27:38] I'm preaching about somebody out there
[27:39] online not you people sitting here
[27:41] tonight I'm sure it's for somebody else
[27:44] not you
[27:46] but some people can be so concrete and
[27:50] stuck and stubborn in their thinking I
[27:53] will never
[27:56] and that's how perfect quenches the
[27:58] spirit of God from your life
[28:00] I'll never get up and shout and act like
[28:02] those people act that's fanaticism
[28:07] criticize it can you say I mean you
[28:08] shouldn't do that
[28:10] because if you got free and let the
[28:13] spirit lead you you might do some crazy
[28:16] things too
[28:18] amen that's right because when someone's
[28:21] free brother Brian says if you get
[28:23] enough victory in your life you'll dance
[28:25] I'm just quoting the prophet now you get
[28:27] enough Victory you're going to dance and
[28:29] you criticize other people's deaths it's
[28:31] feeling free it's feeling the
[28:33] stimulation of the Revelation it's
[28:35] feeling I'm being set free here there's
[28:37] something happening in my mind there's
[28:39] something happening to my heart there's
[28:41] a Revival happening in me
[28:44] and the same thing that makes your
[28:45] emotions go crazy at a baseball game now
[28:48] the holy spirit is moving those emotions
[28:50] I don't care what people think anymore
[28:52] I'm going to worship God
[28:56] and it stops quenching the spirit in
[28:58] your life
[29:00] and it starts releasing and being you
[29:03] the real you
[29:06] praise the Lord somebody say praise the
[29:08] Lord
[29:10] our thoughts
[29:12] even the spirit of God is quenched it is
[29:14] not even
[29:15] the some people's concrete thoughts are
[29:17] not given room to be corrected or
[29:19] challenged our thoughts can never be put
[29:22] in such a place that that cannot be
[29:25] corrected
[29:27] there's not one thought of your own that
[29:30] can that that is in a place that
[29:32] wouldn't be under the spotlight of God's
[29:34] word to be corrected all the time
[29:37] there's not one final thought I said
[29:39] it's Sunday there's only one person
[29:41] that's the first thought they had was a
[29:42] perfect thought they never have to go
[29:44] back and rethink it they know how never
[29:46] have to have another meeting about it
[29:47] they don't have to re-examine it examine
[29:50] it can you say man that's why the niacin
[29:51] Council was so perverted
[29:55] God had his thoughts about
[29:57] he was in Christ he was one can you say
[30:00] man God has his talks about and he
[30:02] didn't just think it he lived it out in
[30:04] front of him
[30:06] because God's thoughts became material
[30:08] and he never wanted man you listened in
[30:10] online he never he never organized a
[30:13] group of men to say we need to get
[30:15] together and decide what the godhead is
[30:18] and establish it for the church for the
[30:20] rest of time and split him into three
[30:22] persons God never LED you to do that God
[30:25] never LED you to believe that God had a
[30:28] thought I am one can you say amen and
[30:31] I'm coming in my son I'll still be one
[30:34] when I come in my son
[30:36] glory be to God he had a thought and he
[30:39] manifested and he doesn't need your
[30:41] interpretation to it
[30:43] the first time he thought it it was
[30:45] perfect
[30:47] and men shouldn't get together we need
[30:48] to have a meeting to dissect this
[30:51] godhead
[30:53] you messed it all up
[30:55] you messed it all up oh I say it
[30:58] respectfully but God God never intended
[31:02] that
[31:04] Satan orchestrated things to split God
[31:08] into three persons and make an idolater
[31:11] out of you
[31:13] anything more than one God
[31:16] and more than one person
[31:18] makes an idolatrous worship
[31:21] I got no problem with God being a
[31:24] trinity in three offices
[31:26] I'm one person but I got I've got 50
[31:30] offices that I fulfill
[31:32] husband father son all these other
[31:35] things but I'm still only one person and
[31:37] God's only one person
[31:40] God's only one person amen the flesh
[31:43] body of Jesus say well that was he had a
[31:45] different Spirit yeah the flesh body had
[31:48] to come as a flesh body and go to
[31:49] Calvary but the Bible says he was the
[31:51] fullness of God and the fullness of God
[31:52] dwelt in him
[31:54] it was all of God in that vessel
[31:56] praise the Lord so now I'm going back to
[31:58] the thought God doesn't need us to
[32:01] correct his uh his thought is perfect
[32:04] the first time but your thoughts have to
[32:07] be corrected
[32:09] some people have such arrogance say I
[32:12] thought this and that's what happened
[32:13] and because I thought it it's conclusion
[32:16] no it ain't
[32:18] our thoughts always have to be corrected
[32:21] our thoughts and conclusions are never
[32:23] to be made permanent or unchanging or
[32:27] will stop growing will stop learning I
[32:30] if I'm 85 years and if I live that long
[32:32] I never want my thoughts to not be
[32:36] corrected by the word of God
[32:38] I appreciate this so much about one of
[32:40] my mentors brother Lonnie Jenkins it was
[32:42] one of my mentors and what I appreciate
[32:44] he was a teacher and teachers kind of
[32:46] they explore and they bring new things
[32:49] sometimes that God's showing them in the
[32:50] word of God but I would hear him say
[32:52] years back he'd preach something and
[32:54] then I'd hear him say at 80 years old I
[32:57] said what do you think about this
[32:59] subject he said well I always thought
[33:00] that way but the other day the Lord
[33:02] corrected me and so I corrected that and
[33:04] started to preach it just a little bit
[33:05] more perfect according to the scripture
[33:07] an 80 year old man how many 80 year olds
[33:10] how many 80 year olds do you see in this
[33:12] world that are concrete they're never
[33:14] going to change their mind about life
[33:17] I don't want to be that way friends
[33:19] I want to say Lord
[33:21] I'm I'm 95 years old I'm here at literal
[33:24] life today I'm not the pastor anymore
[33:28] but I'm here to worship God and Shout
[33:30] Whatever my body will let me do and I'm
[33:33] here to be corrected by the word of God
[33:36] if I'm thinking wrong let the spotlight
[33:38] shine on my thinking and let me change
[33:41] somebody say praise the Lord tonight
[33:46] our thoughts and conclusions are never
[33:49] to be permanent or will stop growing and
[33:51] learning our thoughts are never to be
[33:53] unaccountable
[33:55] for life
[33:57] our thoughts are to be under the
[33:59] spotlight of God's word and his spirit
[34:02] all the time always subject to to uh to
[34:07] being corrected
[34:10] always subject to the scrutiny of the
[34:13] Holy Spirit
[34:15] always
[34:18] because of 9 11 happening in our country
[34:20] we will never ever enter an airport
[34:23] again without walking through the
[34:25] scanner
[34:27] do you realize that we'll never have a
[34:30] day when we won't be walking through
[34:31] something to scan what's on our body
[34:34] after 9 11.
[34:37] because we learned
[34:39] the enemy can get through
[34:42] and so now we have to have scanner
[34:43] you're not an enemy you might not have a
[34:45] gun you're not a terrorist but because
[34:48] everybody's suspect right we all got it
[34:52] for the rest of our lives we're never
[34:53] going to change it we'll never enter an
[34:55] airport again without a scanner and if
[34:57] that's a lesson for us to realize if you
[34:59] have a 911 in your life and you have a
[35:01] jolt in your life of what the enemy did
[35:04] to you to tear up your marriage or tear
[35:05] up your life or make you fall that's a
[35:08] 911 that says from now on every thought
[35:11] is captive to the Lord and every thought
[35:13] is scanned scanned and checked by the
[35:17] Holy Spirit
[35:18] because it was my thought life that got
[35:20] me into all that it was my thoughts in
[35:23] pornography that led me to adultery
[35:27] it started with my thoughts is anybody
[35:30] listening tonight it starts in the
[35:32] thought life nobody goes and sins right
[35:34] away it starts in their thinking it
[35:37] starts and then they things that I want
[35:38] more of that Allah so I'm going to look
[35:39] at pornography I'm going to look at this
[35:41] magazine I'm going to look at this woman
[35:42] I'm going to keep doing but it started
[35:44] in their thoughts they let their
[35:46] thoughts be uncontrolled and unchecked
[35:48] by the Holy Spirit
[35:49] and then it turns into sin and so if you
[35:52] have a 911 you better start saying every
[35:55] thought comes under the Captivity of the
[35:57] Lord there is no thought allowed to
[35:59] think on my own it's scanned by the Holy
[36:01] Spirit
[36:02] and if it's a negative thought it's a
[36:04] thought to put somebody down if it's a
[36:06] thought against me when you've got
[36:07] everything under the blood and Satan's
[36:09] accusing you if it's a thought from
[36:11] Satan you're an unworthy believer you
[36:13] don't deserve to come and worship God
[36:14] you don't deserve to even pray today
[36:16] because of what you've done that's a
[36:18] thought that originates in the pits of
[36:19] hell and you quickly say that's not of
[36:21] God it gets scanned it gets out of here
[36:24] it's Satan trying to be bring a gun
[36:25] through the airport can you say man he's
[36:27] bringing a weapon against you in the
[36:29] airport but it gets scanned and it gets
[36:31] confiscated
[36:34] that thought gets confiscated and will
[36:36] not be allowed to go any further into
[36:38] the airport
[36:40] oh glory be to God praise God
[36:43] let every thought get confiscated
[36:47] that's not of him
[36:49] praise the Lord so now under God's
[36:52] Spotlight this is where we need to and
[36:55] we Christians we we need Christians to
[36:59] say never again will a thought be
[37:02] allowed to Lodge in my mind without
[37:04] being brought through the scanning light
[37:07] of the word of God can you say Amen
[37:10] so this is our text
[37:12] casting down
[37:14] imagination
[37:16] for the weapons of other casting down
[37:18] imaginations
[37:20] and and everything that exalteth itself
[37:24] above against the knowledge of God it's
[37:27] contrary so we cast down that
[37:29] imagination we cast down that stinking
[37:33] thinking we cast down what's lifting
[37:36] itself higher than than the leadership
[37:39] of the Lord then you say Amen you think
[37:42] I'm not talking to you as a teenager
[37:43] tonight
[37:45] or as a young man or as a young woman
[37:48] say well I don't even know about what
[37:49] what you're preaching I you know I can't
[37:51] catch all of it you can catch this
[37:54] say I'm only 12 years old you can catch
[37:56] what I'm saying here because guess what
[37:58] when you leave here and even tonight
[37:59] while I was preaching your thought just
[38:01] wandered off somewhere what am I going
[38:04] to do tomorrow
[38:05] I wonder if my my school is going to be
[38:07] difficult tomorrow you have a mind you
[38:09] have a brain you had thoughts
[38:12] and if you looked at something dirty
[38:14] today then your mind's going back to
[38:15] that and I might go back and look at
[38:17] that when I get home
[38:18] so this message is for you tonight this
[38:21] message is for you teenager and it would
[38:24] be better that you get filled with this
[38:26] Holy Spirit and bring your mind under
[38:28] control when you're 10 12 years old it
[38:30] would be better you listen to this fat
[38:32] preacher now and get you now
[38:37] and you could live a lot more Victorious
[38:39] the rest of your life
[38:41] because when you get to 25 30 years old
[38:43] and you fed on wrong things and your
[38:45] mind is all messed up
[38:46] it's a lot harder for the Lord to get a
[38:48] hold of you
[38:50] becomes concrete you'd be like that guy
[38:53] Valvoline oil Instant Oil Change that is
[38:56] so bitter and atheist I don't even
[38:58] believe in God anymore
[39:00] that's how far mind can go
[39:03] but I'm going to keep loving because
[39:05] there's a there's a force of love of God
[39:08] that can change that
[39:10] doesn't matter how bitter they become
[39:12] that's how your mind can get so concrete
[39:14] though so it gets God I'm amazed I don't
[39:16] even believe in God it's crazy to think
[39:18] that people believe that I don't believe
[39:19] in God they believe isn't a god look
[39:21] around you you know how can you believe
[39:23] there's not a god
[39:26] but in their own thoughts it it grows
[39:29] and grows and grows against exalts
[39:31] itself against the knowledge of God my
[39:34] what a what a heart that was
[39:36] just reaching out what I my my my
[39:38] feelings went out for the young man
[39:41] and I knew he loved his mom and dad but
[39:43] such hatred towards him and his
[39:45] upbringing and the legalism and just all
[39:49] the phoniness and I just my heart just
[39:51] was crying for him oh God save this
[39:55] young boy
[39:57] so casting and down imagination and
[40:00] every thought
[40:02] we should do it because we don't want to
[40:05] be in the inspiration of Satan can you
[40:06] say Amen and when your thoughts
[40:10] are led to the exalt itself above the
[40:13] word of God then what inspiration are
[40:15] you under that's under the same one as
[40:17] Lucifer from the beginning can you say
[40:19] Amen
[40:21] so we have stinking thinking
[40:23] we have we're to cast down any stinking
[40:26] thinking when it has a smell on it we
[40:30] need to admit that it smells you ever
[40:32] had somebody that smells and they don't
[40:34] smell it
[40:38] but everybody else can
[40:42] and so they need a shower or they
[40:44] something you don't need something and
[40:45] and so but it smells and and so we need
[40:48] to have a sensitivity when thoughts are
[40:51] stinking thinking that's a thought
[40:52] that's thinking that smells that doesn't
[40:54] ring with the aroma of God
[40:56] amen we need to admit it when something
[40:59] a thought doesn't smell right and it's
[41:02] pretty bad when we lose our smell for
[41:04] stinking thinking
[41:09] covid messed with a lot of people's
[41:11] smell sense mess with mine I can never I
[41:14] haven't been able to smell the same
[41:15] since I can't smell some things I can't
[41:18] smell some things that are on me so I'm
[41:20] thankful I have a wife to remind me
[41:23] I'm serious what a devil now what a
[41:26] devil what a demon Spirit now I don't
[41:28] know if it's done to you but my smell's
[41:30] never been I don't smell things the same
[41:31] I don't smell food the same and I I
[41:34] can't smell certain things and and so
[41:36] what a devil that's in that disease and
[41:40] it might be a type and a shadow of what
[41:42] the devil's doing to us
[41:44] you know the Bible says whose conscience
[41:46] is seared like an iron the conscious
[41:49] becomes seared they don't have a
[41:50] conscience anymore they can't sense
[41:52] right and wrong anymore they can't sense
[41:54] when they sin anymore because their
[41:56] conscience has been seared with a hot
[41:58] iron and so the now the smell of disease
[42:00] that takes the smell and messes with the
[42:02] smell and they can't pick up on the
[42:04] smell of sin anymore we should be able
[42:07] to see so sensitive we can smell sin
[42:09] when it's coming we can smell a
[42:11] Temptation when it's coming at us and we
[42:13] can smell stink and think in a bad
[42:15] thought that Satan's thought we can
[42:17] smell it when it's coming and get rid of
[42:19] it
[42:20] amen
[42:22] so you know I don't know how how much
[42:25] further to go tonight because I could
[42:26] split this up and get it Sunday what
[42:29] time are we at here 807 all right
[42:31] so you know I didn't realize that when
[42:34] when we talk about this thing we have
[42:36] some
[42:37] um I'll just give it a few more minutes
[42:39] if it's okay with you
[42:40] I could pick this up maybe Sunday but I
[42:43] want I was wanting to go into something
[42:44] else Sunday a little bit and take it
[42:46] further but you know there's a there's
[42:48] an article that says what is thinking
[42:50] thinking and how to manage it and this
[42:52] is what psychology does and I didn't
[42:53] realize they call it stinging thinking
[42:55] but they say human beings the
[42:56] psychological part of human beings
[42:59] it has what they call stinking thinking
[43:01] and they've narrowed it down to 10 main
[43:04] things and they say uh they call it
[43:06] cognitive distortions
[43:09] or stinking thinking cognitive
[43:12] distortions or stinking thinking are
[43:14] negative or irrational thoughts that
[43:17] lack evidence
[43:20] cognitive distortions this is every
[43:23] human being cognitive distortions or
[43:26] stinking thinking are negative or
[43:29] irrational thoughts that lack evidence
[43:31] and influence how you feel or your
[43:35] behavior
[43:37] it's the psychology of it I don't mind
[43:39] reading it because they Peg it right I
[43:41] know that because how I live you know it
[43:43] because how you live
[43:45] this is cognitive distortions and they
[43:48] can become extreme or they can be at a
[43:50] low level but there are distortions
[43:51] they're stink and think they are
[43:52] negative irrational thoughts that we
[43:55] should get rid of because they destroy
[43:56] our lives now tonight I'm going to read
[43:59] a few from that article and of course
[44:01] psychology always you know the title of
[44:03] this article is uh how to manage it
[44:05] they're going to give their reasons to
[44:07] manage it I'm going to skip some of that
[44:09] part you can read it if you want because
[44:11] I I believe the word of God has given us
[44:14] answers to manage it
[44:16] can you say man that's what we respond
[44:19] with when we have a human psychology of
[44:21] what it's doing we've got a holy ghost
[44:22] we got the word we got the Lord that can
[44:25] speak to us and we yield ourselves to it
[44:26] and he'll help us through our thought
[44:28] process does the Bible speak about what
[44:30] we should think about very clearly
[44:33] whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is of
[44:35] good report think on these things it
[44:38] tells us what to direct our minds to
[44:40] think about
[44:41] but the cognitive negative and
[44:43] distortions bring stinking thinking and
[44:46] that's what they call it everyone they
[44:47] say experiences cognitive distortions to
[44:50] some degree there's a natural part there
[44:52] they are a natural part of human of the
[44:55] human being but when they happen too
[44:57] frequently or in more extreme forms they
[45:00] can be harmful and contribute to
[45:02] problems such as anxiety and depression
[45:06] your thoughts go in a certain direction
[45:08] contributes can contribute to anxiety
[45:11] and depression goes back with thought
[45:13] just like I said when somebody ends up
[45:15] in an adultery or sin it started with
[45:17] their thought life
[45:18] it had stages to it so anxiety and
[45:21] depression we don't belittle someone
[45:23] from that but it has to start some way
[45:24] and a lot of times it's Satan attacking
[45:26] your thoughts can you say Amen it starts
[45:29] here what you're thinking about all the
[45:30] time if you don't bring that under
[45:32] control he'll take your way off can you
[45:34] say ma'am so that's what this this
[45:36] stinking thinking or this cognitive
[45:37] distortions in our thought process can
[45:40] bring anxiety and depression there are
[45:42] many ways to manage negative thoughts in
[45:44] the moment and begin to change the
[45:46] pattern of stinking thinking the first
[45:49] step in managing stinking thinking is to
[45:52] understand the different types of
[45:53] cognitive distortions so that you can
[45:56] recognize them when they're happy why
[45:57] don't you disagree with that but they're
[45:59] saying that the first step is managing
[46:01] in managing this stinking thinking is to
[46:03] understand the different types of
[46:05] stinking thinking I'm gonna correct that
[46:08] and say the first step dealing with this
[46:11] is to start yielding to the Holy Spirit
[46:14] letting him expose your wrong thinking
[46:19] praise the Lord
[46:21] and I'm going to give a second step the
[46:23] second step is to be transformed by the
[46:26] word in the renewing of your mind I'm
[46:28] going to give answers from the word of
[46:30] God because God gives answers to the
[46:32] human suffering and The Human Condition
[46:34] and your spirit he understands it he
[46:37] builds you can you say Amen how would
[46:39] God build us with a spirit memory
[46:41] imagination and Consciousness affection
[46:42] and then not give us power or give us
[46:45] answers how to bring it under control
[46:46] God wouldn't do that but he says the
[46:50] glory of God will dwell in man when he
[46:52] brings it under subjection
[46:55] it says the first step is man of
[46:57] managing them is to understand the
[46:59] different types I think I'm going to
[47:00] read the different types that they give
[47:01] tonight but I can tell you the first
[47:03] step is yielding the Holy Spirit and let
[47:05] him expose your wrong thinking you sit
[47:08] in a service where the holy spirit is
[47:09] and he's exposing your wrong thinking
[47:12] about stuff
[47:14] I trust that you're Whispering under
[47:16] your breath oh God I'm getting
[47:18] correction today I shouldn't think like
[47:20] that
[47:21] take that thought out of my mind
[47:24] the first the first uh Distortion how
[47:28] people think is called the All or
[47:30] Nothing thinking all the nothing thing
[47:31] sometimes called black and white
[47:33] thinking is the tendency to think in
[47:36] absolutes I
[47:38] I have to do right
[47:41] or I'm not going to do it at all I have
[47:43] to do it right I have to be perfect or
[47:45] I'm not going to do it at all it's it's
[47:47] thinking in extremes and other things
[47:49] black and white thinking it's only
[47:51] perfect or I'm not going to do it at all
[47:53] and then they give their thing to help
[47:57] um you know the prophet talks about
[47:59] um a boss at a certain Corporation and
[48:02] he interviewed a guy for a job and he
[48:04] had him sign his signature and he
[48:06] brought his own pencil and he says how
[48:08] come your pencil doesn't have an eraser
[48:09] and the guy said because I don't make
[48:11] any mistakes
[48:13] and the boss said I'm not hiring you
[48:15] because usually people who don't make
[48:17] mistakes are they won't do anything on
[48:18] the job
[48:21] and I know that's simple and then the
[48:23] prophet goes on and describes he says if
[48:26] we don't we have to be willing to work
[48:29] for the kingdom of God and step out and
[48:31] do things and be willing to make the
[48:33] mistakes and ask God's forgiveness for
[48:35] those mistakes he says if we approach it
[48:37] I'm not going to do anything because I
[48:39] don't want to make any mistakes then we
[48:41] end up not doing anything
[48:43] and we can learn from our mistakes it's
[48:46] not where you intentionally go make
[48:47] mistakes but if we're human we'll make
[48:49] them
[48:50] can I get an amen
[48:52] okay so we we must not be afraid of
[48:55] making mistakes in our thinking people
[48:58] they won't do anything because they're
[49:00] afraid of making mistakes doing so they
[49:02] won't learn something new they won't do
[49:03] something because their thought process
[49:05] says I'm not going to do it if I can't
[49:07] do it perfectly right then I'm not going
[49:09] to do it at all
[49:11] I'm not going to be perfect in front of
[49:14] everyone this is religion on the outside
[49:15] is that I'm I have to be perfect in
[49:19] front of everybody or I'm not
[49:20] participating
[49:25] Prophet said how can you fail where
[49:27] you're in Jesus Christ
[49:29] we'll make mistakes but when you're in
[49:31] Christ how can you fail you can't fail
[49:33] you've got everlasting life all demons
[49:35] and hell can't shake see I'm answering
[49:37] these things with the word of God
[49:38] tonight can you say amen I can give
[49:40] psychologies answers but I'm answering
[49:42] it with the word of God and the prophet
[49:44] said all demons in hell can't shake you
[49:46] you've got everlasting life Jesus said
[49:48] so so don't be scared of failure don't
[49:52] be afraid of failure you say well I'm
[49:54] afraid that I'll get fanatic I'll be a
[49:56] fanatic I'd rather have a little
[49:57] fanaticism than to sit still and do
[50:00] nothing
[50:02] oh
[50:04] amen we need a balance but he said I
[50:07] prefer a little fanaticism might be
[50:10] corrected then people scent like bumps
[50:12] and log and they're not going to enter
[50:13] in
[50:14] you know why they don't enter in because
[50:16] their minds talk them out of it
[50:18] I'm not going to be a religious zealot
[50:20] and get up there and make a fool of
[50:21] myself and your mind is taking you away
[50:24] from being led by the spirit of God
[50:25] convicted by the spirit
[50:27] worshiping in the spirit can you say
[50:30] Amen
[50:31] freedom of the spirit your mind talked
[50:33] you out of it
[50:35] the second thing you people think about
[50:38] in in an abnormal thought or stinking
[50:41] thinking it's over generalization over
[50:44] generalization is seeing a pattern based
[50:47] upon a single event and being overly
[50:49] broad when drawing conclusions so you've
[50:52] seen one thing and you and you take a
[50:55] single event and you generalize all
[50:57] future events and being overly broad
[50:59] when drawing the conclusions I feel
[51:02] awkward I I felt awkward on my date that
[51:06] I went on
[51:07] I'm always so awkward
[51:12] so it's the generalization of your
[51:14] entire character I felt awkward tonight
[51:16] you know what I'm always awkward
[51:18] I'm always awkward and see this is what
[51:20] they call a stinking thinking because
[51:22] you let your mind take one event
[51:24] one thing that you felt embarrassed and
[51:26] now you start judge your entire
[51:28] character by it and there may not be
[51:29] truth to that
[51:31] I know this might be simple to some and
[51:33] it might be psychology to some it is
[51:35] psychology
[51:37] but it the thing is friends is you and I
[51:42] do this in our thinking sometimes
[51:44] it's an over generalization can you say
[51:47] Amen
[51:49] praise the Lord
[51:51] so
[51:53] or I always do this or I'm always so bad
[51:57] and it may not be true the devil wants
[52:00] little mistakes to Define your whole
[52:02] character and Destiny and identity
[52:07] that's the devil's thoughts
[52:09] he wants one little mistake to Define
[52:12] your entire character your entire
[52:14] Destiny your entire identity but tonight
[52:16] I'm here to tell you he's a liar Satan's
[52:19] a liar we repent we move on and our
[52:23] ultimate identity and destination is In
[52:26] Christ Alone can you say Amen
[52:28] our ultimate identity and destination is
[52:30] not in our own thoughts it's what God
[52:32] Said that we are and God said and so now
[52:34] then the third one I've got to move
[52:35] quick because there's ten and I'd like
[52:37] to get you uh going here tonight a
[52:40] mental filter people think and this is
[52:42] stink and thinking a military filter a
[52:44] mental filter is when you only pay
[52:45] attention to certain types of evidence
[52:47] certain types of evidence or focus on
[52:49] the negative for example you focus on
[52:51] one criticism in an otherwise
[52:54] positive performance reveal at your job
[52:57] so you got everything else positive
[52:59] everything else positive but you have
[53:02] one negative review and you judge your
[53:04] entire character by the negative review
[53:06] that's the way your thought process it's
[53:08] a mental filter to bring it through the
[53:10] negative filter all the time and miss
[53:12] all the positive
[53:15] pastors can notice everybody who's
[53:17] missing from church instead of noticing
[53:19] everybody who's there
[53:22] instead of rejoicing of who was there
[53:23] he's worried about who wasn't there well
[53:26] to me it's their fault they wasn't there
[53:28] it's their fourth they weren't listening
[53:30] online they're cheated out of it I'm
[53:32] doing my job I'm here to raise the the
[53:34] bar and the standard before the people
[53:36] can you say Amen but pastors can get
[53:39] under complexes and they say they spend
[53:41] all week with wonder why so and so
[53:42] wasn't there you know I quit doing that
[53:44] years ago it's not that I don't pray for
[53:46] you but listen I don't worry about it
[53:48] because God was there and there was some
[53:51] hungry people there and that's what
[53:53] happened and that's what took place and
[53:55] that's the positive
[53:57] but you and your thinking can think
[53:59] about the one negative thing that
[54:02] happened in the day
[54:04] and everything else was positive but
[54:07] you're gonna be you know vegan on the
[54:10] couch with two gallons of ice cream
[54:14] whoa that's right
[54:16] because you remember the one negative
[54:19] thing that happened to you somebody made
[54:21] one sentence to you and it's just your
[54:24] spirit is crushed
[54:27] you might have got all kinds of
[54:28] compliments from everybody else and all
[54:30] kinds of encouraging things
[54:32] but you're going to dwell on the one
[54:34] negative
[54:36] that's a mental filter that's stinking
[54:38] thinking
[54:40] praise the Lord
[54:43] your mind chooses the negative of
[54:45] yourself every time but what God says
[54:47] about me is the only real truth can you
[54:49] say Amen I'm giving you the word of God
[54:50] one mistake or one sin is not the final
[54:54] word on my life
[54:56] he gets the final say
[54:59] what they say in that night of worship
[55:00] for Jehovah gets the final say is that
[55:04] what the name of the song was Jehovah
[55:06] Jehovah gets the final say the devil
[55:09] doesn't get the final say I don't get
[55:12] the final say Jehovah Jehovah gets the
[55:16] final say
[55:19] all right get back up here we got seven
[55:21] more to finish
[55:24] the fourth one is thinking thinking is
[55:26] discounting the positive that's similar
[55:28] with the last one you discount the good
[55:30] things that have happened or feel like
[55:31] your accomplishments don't count my
[55:33] answer doesn't count because it was a
[55:35] lucky guess
[55:37] and so now that's the way it's a
[55:39] negative thought process and I think we
[55:41] need to be positive towards the enemy
[55:43] towards people I think we need to remain
[55:46] positive in our minds and our confession
[55:48] God help us to see this tonight help me
[55:50] to be better at this
[55:52] to say I may lose a battle now and then
[55:55] but I've already won the war
[55:57] there used to be a song that said I may
[55:59] lose a battle every now and then but
[56:02] I've already won the war he's made us
[56:04] victorious in Jesus Christ
[56:06] I'm going to think on the good things
[56:09] and not the things that let me down or
[56:11] bring me down number five and stinking
[56:14] thinking is jump into conclusions I know
[56:17] none of you ever jumped to conclusions
[56:19] you just don't do that here you're too
[56:22] holy you're just too holy of people but
[56:24] there's some of us in our stinking
[56:26] thinking that jump to conclusions
[56:29] we do this when we interpret the meaning
[56:31] of a situation with little or no
[56:34] evidence at all it can come in the form
[56:36] of the following mind reading imagining
[56:40] we know what others are thinking or
[56:41] believe people are amazing they're like
[56:43] prophets they can imagine and they know
[56:45] what other people are thinking about
[56:46] them
[56:47] they're not prophets but they think they
[56:49] are because they thought I know they're
[56:51] thinking out about me that's what
[56:52] they're thinking how do you know you're
[56:53] not a mind reader
[56:56] mind reading imagining we know what
[56:58] others are thinking or believing for
[57:00] example you might think
[57:02] the boy canceled our date he must not
[57:05] think I'm attractive
[57:08] you don't know that
[57:11] he might have canceled it because
[57:13] he couldn't make it he wants to
[57:14] reschedule and he does think you're
[57:16] attractive
[57:18] come on all you people
[57:21] I think that's a good example
[57:24] they canceled coming over for dinner
[57:26] because they really didn't like us to
[57:28] start with
[57:29] you mind reader
[57:31] you know what mind reading course did
[57:33] you take
[57:36] how do you know that
[57:38] it's jumping to conclusions and it's
[57:42] stinking thinking
[57:46] people fear things that haven't even
[57:47] happened yet
[57:49] it's enough to overcome what's really
[57:50] happened in our life that's enough
[57:53] to have to overcome things that haven't
[57:54] happened yet
[57:56] most of the testimony people you know
[57:58] what I like about this congregation are
[58:00] most of the people who are testifying of
[58:02] things and they're going to go get a
[58:03] test at the doctor because there's a
[58:05] hint that something might be wrong and
[58:07] Through the Years in this church most of
[58:09] the time sister Inez all of them most
[58:11] the time are confessing and saying I'm
[58:13] believing that there's going to be
[58:15] nothing in that test
[58:18] can you say Amen instead of believing
[58:21] that the worse can you say Amen
[58:25] the doctor is going to tell me today
[58:27] that I have cancer and they say it
[58:30] predicting the future
[58:32] the doctors I know that I know I know I
[58:35] know they're going to tell me that I
[58:36] have cancer and what I've heard is the
[58:38] confession say they're not going to tell
[58:40] me I have cancer and time after time I
[58:43] watched it to be true sometimes there's
[58:45] something there but a lot of times
[58:46] there's nothing there could have been
[58:48] but the confession got honored
[58:51] and the test was clear
[58:54] I got a testimony and sister my did I
[58:57] send this to you from Andrea Andre Grant
[58:59] here she wanted you to have it
[59:02] hello brother Paul this is Andrea Grant
[59:04] from Linden Washington I spoke with you
[59:05] when you were in BC at Living Word past
[59:08] this past Sunday I should have
[59:10] remembered to tell you that sister
[59:11] Rebecca would probably remember the
[59:13] grants the grant girls who used to come
[59:15] to Winter YouTube way back in the day we
[59:17] sure loved going to Winter youth retreat
[59:19] that was such a blessing to us and
[59:20] brought us all closer to the Lord thank
[59:22] you so much for all you did to make that
[59:23] Retreat such an awesome experience for
[59:25] us over the years that we went I also
[59:28] really enjoyed the services you preached
[59:29] and the songs you sang at Living Word
[59:31] Fellowship this past weekend I was so
[59:33] moved by your song wounded that it was
[59:36] so beautiful and such a powerful message
[59:37] it really spoke to me as I'm sure it
[59:40] does to many others as well thank you so
[59:41] much for sharing the word of the of the
[59:43] Lord in your heart with us I wanted to
[59:45] share my testimony of you over my recent
[59:46] miraculous healing from mustastic uh
[59:50] breast cancer of the bone below is a
[59:52] link to a 12-minute video clip of the in
[59:54] testimony and song that I said at a
[59:56] Living Word Fellowship please feel free
[59:59] to download the the video and share this
[1:00:01] link with everyone
[1:00:02] that you feel it is uh that will bless
[1:00:04] the follow-up to the testimony above is
[1:00:07] that I had an appointment with my doctor
[1:00:09] after that to discuss the Pet Scan
[1:00:12] results she said when she read the Pet
[1:00:14] Scan results she she exclaimed oh thank
[1:00:17] God I started crying there in the exam
[1:00:19] room as she said this and I told her how
[1:00:21] we were thankful for the Lord she said
[1:00:23] she went through each and every scan
[1:00:25] herself and told me that I was
[1:00:27] completely cancer free as I left the
[1:00:30] exam room we were both laughing and
[1:00:31] smiling and we and we even exchanged a
[1:00:34] big hug of Joy this moment so struck me
[1:00:37] with significance here I was in a Cancer
[1:00:40] Center full of very sick people and yet
[1:00:43] I was able to walk out laughing smiling
[1:00:46] and exchanging hugs of Joy even the
[1:00:49] nurses and staff in the hallway pause
[1:00:50] what they were doing to watch this
[1:00:52] moment I stand completely whole today
[1:00:55] and testify that only God could do this
[1:00:58] even the doctor had to declare the work
[1:01:00] of God
[1:01:03] Hallelujah
[1:01:06] this sister's not very old probably in
[1:01:08] the 30s or 40s I'm not sure but but
[1:01:10] listen you know look at that breast
[1:01:12] cancer already Satan trying to do that
[1:01:14] but but here it's the confession maybe I
[1:01:17] can send that link and you can watch the
[1:01:19] whole testimony number six of stinking
[1:01:21] thinking and I'm closing here hopefully
[1:01:23] in three or four minutes
[1:01:25] the magnification or catastrophizing
[1:01:29] crap you know catastrophe I don't know
[1:01:32] how to say that word but uh
[1:01:35] they have a new word called
[1:01:39] catastrophizing I guess it is
[1:01:41] here you exaggerate the importance of a
[1:01:44] problem or assume the worst possible
[1:01:46] outcome if I fail this test I won't pass
[1:01:49] the class
[1:01:51] and I'll flunk out of school
[1:01:54] so once again it's the negative thinking
[1:01:56] it's the magnification of something and
[1:01:59] predicting the future exaggerating
[1:02:01] thoughts must be corrected exaggerated
[1:02:04] thoughts must be corrected and brought
[1:02:06] in Balance can you say Amen imagination
[1:02:09] can make it real but I say the scripture
[1:02:11] all things work together for the good
[1:02:14] that love God and are called according
[1:02:16] to his prop that's the scripture that
[1:02:18] you need can you say Amen instead of
[1:02:20] predicting the future and exaggerating
[1:02:21] the future say I know whatever happens
[1:02:24] all things work together for my good
[1:02:26] number seven of stink and thinking is
[1:02:28] emotional reasoning and brother Brown
[1:02:30] taught us the realm of reasoning started
[1:02:32] in the Garden of Eden this is when
[1:02:34] negative feelings inform your thoughts
[1:02:36] without facts to support those thoughts
[1:02:38] for example you may say I feel like
[1:02:40] nobody likes me this may be brought on
[1:02:42] by feelings of loneliness even though
[1:02:44] you do have friends again you try to
[1:02:47] examine these things and look at these
[1:02:48] thoughts as being are they true I feel
[1:02:51] like nobody likes me do you know brother
[1:02:52] Branham said that himself he said I get
[1:02:54] Moody I get in spells and he said the
[1:02:57] devil tells me I don't have a friend in
[1:02:59] the world
[1:03:00] I'm so glad that the prophet was honest
[1:03:02] about what he felt
[1:03:05] he admitted his humanness he said I get
[1:03:07] moody I get spells the devil speaks to
[1:03:10] me I don't think think of a man now that
[1:03:13] has all the people he knows in the world
[1:03:15] and affected in the world and all the
[1:03:17] ministry people and the devil has this
[1:03:19] crazy stupid thought you don't have a
[1:03:21] friend in the world
[1:03:23] it was a lie
[1:03:25] but the devil can try to tell us the
[1:03:26] same thing can you say Amen
[1:03:29] it's reasoning how you feel does not
[1:03:32] mean it's the truth
[1:03:34] feelings cannot be lifted above the word
[1:03:38] of God
[1:03:40] emotions a woman gets emotional man gets
[1:03:43] emotional your emotions can tell you a
[1:03:45] lot of things but can never be lifted
[1:03:47] about above the word of God don't let
[1:03:49] your emotions control you and control
[1:03:51] your thoughts number eight is should
[1:03:53] statements think and think and should
[1:03:55] statements these statements often
[1:03:57] include words like should must or alt I
[1:04:00] should always be friendly organized nice
[1:04:02] Etc should statements can lead to
[1:04:04] feelings of guilt or like you've already
[1:04:07] failed at something
[1:04:09] like brother Henry has a famous
[1:04:11] statement says I should be an optimist
[1:04:13] but I doubt if I could be one
[1:04:19] if only he has that type of humor
[1:04:23] it's special
[1:04:25] you know what
[1:04:27] I should do this I should do that I
[1:04:29] should do this but it's always the guilt
[1:04:31] I should have done it this way I should
[1:04:33] have done it that way you're bringing
[1:04:34] guilt on yourself it's stinking thinking
[1:04:38] God doesn't tell you to think like that
[1:04:40] God loves to see us trying
[1:04:43] and the word be therefore perfect the
[1:04:46] father Christ said your father says be
[1:04:49] therefore perfect means not sinless
[1:04:52] Perfection but growth
[1:04:55] to maturity
[1:04:57] be her perfect I won't do nothing unless
[1:05:00] I can do it perfect you look I've got I
[1:05:02] should do it there I should have done it
[1:05:03] this way you see it's it's being perfect
[1:05:05] it's growth to maturity growth to
[1:05:08] production are you trying God loves to
[1:05:11] see somebody who keeps trying a Son of
[1:05:13] God falls down but he gets back up one
[1:05:15] more time then when he falls he said God
[1:05:17] forgive me I'm going to keep going God
[1:05:19] wants to look at if you keep trying
[1:05:21] when you quit trying is when you're in
[1:05:23] trouble
[1:05:26] I'm going I'm on my way and to look at
[1:05:29] that beauty is in the eyes of the
[1:05:31] beholder number nine is labeling things
[1:05:34] labeling yourself labeling people uh as
[1:05:37] the name suggests it assigns labels to
[1:05:39] ourselves and other people I get so
[1:05:41] upset with myself when I make a mistake
[1:05:43] or I feel bad when I let others down and
[1:05:46] so so you you label let me just say it
[1:05:49] this way
[1:05:50] you become a professional at putting
[1:05:53] people in a certain category and putting
[1:05:55] you in a certain category I did this so
[1:05:57] I must be in this category of people
[1:06:00] it's stinking thinking
[1:06:02] and I can say this you're more
[1:06:04] professional at putting other people in
[1:06:05] categories than you
[1:06:07] there's pockets in this message that
[1:06:09] have become professionals at putting
[1:06:11] people in categories
[1:06:15] we got all this truth of predestination
[1:06:17] and whose serpent seed whose
[1:06:19] predestinated seed and all these other
[1:06:20] things so we become professionals that
[1:06:23] we make it a judgment of what category
[1:06:24] they end we do not know what category
[1:06:27] they're in the grace of God can save
[1:06:29] someone who looks like serpency
[1:06:32] but we in the message become
[1:06:34] professionals at putting people in a
[1:06:36] certain category they're an unbeliever
[1:06:38] they're a make-believer they're this
[1:06:39] they're a they're a borderline believer
[1:06:41] and I preach against borderline
[1:06:43] Believers I preach it up here but I
[1:06:45] don't have a personal right and you know
[1:06:46] to put somebody in a category and guess
[1:06:49] what you don't have a right to put
[1:06:51] yourself in a certain category
[1:06:54] the only category I want to put myself
[1:06:56] into what God said that I am whatever he
[1:06:59] says I am that's what I am whatever the
[1:07:02] devil says I am I'm certainly not going
[1:07:04] to believe that and whatever category
[1:07:06] God has put me in I'm happy for it and a
[1:07:09] matter of fact it's like David said
[1:07:12] those words let my sentence come forth
[1:07:15] from God it's God that decides who I am
[1:07:18] on Judgment Day or whatever it is God
[1:07:20] will decide and I'm happy with whatever
[1:07:22] God decides to put me in what category
[1:07:25] in my soul says I'm a predestinated Son
[1:07:28] of God the word confirms that and
[1:07:30] vindicates that can you say Amen but
[1:07:32] listen I'd be happy with whatever if I
[1:07:34] live my whole life for God and he sent
[1:07:36] me to hell I'm happy with that I'm happy
[1:07:38] with that that's what brother Brown said
[1:07:40] now
[1:07:41] because listen it's God that chooses the
[1:07:44] category am I
[1:07:48] you define Yourself by social media
[1:07:51] you define Yourself by better looking
[1:07:53] people than you you know what you're
[1:07:55] doing you're putting yourself in a
[1:07:56] certain category they're better looking
[1:07:58] than me so I am in this category
[1:08:01] you're defining Yourself by the
[1:08:04] categories this world splits up
[1:08:07] Ultra pretty not pretty ugly
[1:08:10] there's more of them
[1:08:13] puts you in categories you put yourself
[1:08:14] in a category but I say to the devil I
[1:08:17] am fearfully and wonderfully made by a
[1:08:21] Divine designer
[1:08:23] this is a scripture several times I
[1:08:25] brought up with my daughter the last few
[1:08:27] months and I'm only open about it
[1:08:29] because she's been open to tell the
[1:08:31] world to give the devil a black eye but
[1:08:34] I quoted to Uriah I looked her in the
[1:08:36] eye you are fearfully and wonderfully
[1:08:38] made by God that's what the word says
[1:08:41] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:08:42] you're made by a Divine designer
[1:08:45] who made you just the way that you are
[1:08:48] for a purpose can you say every teenager
[1:08:51] everyone listen to me you're made the
[1:08:53] way your ears your nose your mouth
[1:08:55] you're made the way you are for a
[1:08:57] purpose I couldn't stand my freckles
[1:08:59] when I got freckles I had millions of
[1:09:01] freckles I thought they were the ugliest
[1:09:03] thing in the face of the earth I had
[1:09:04] them all over I tried to get my dad to
[1:09:06] buy me some cream I bought some special
[1:09:08] expensive cream to get them off and then
[1:09:10] I put the cream on and slept on it and
[1:09:12] the next day I had more freckles after
[1:09:13] the cream I had more of them and when I
[1:09:16] live in Arizona when I was a kid mom
[1:09:17] took me dad took me to Arizona in the
[1:09:19] sun I got more freckles
[1:09:25] and so when I
[1:09:27] started to get to know my wife I had two
[1:09:29] questions
[1:09:30] do you have the Holy Ghost second
[1:09:32] question what do you think about
[1:09:33] freckles
[1:09:36] I love them
[1:09:38] that's what she said I love freckles and
[1:09:41] she was speaking from her heart no you
[1:09:43] look at all the pictures of some of her
[1:09:45] boyfriends in school they were redhead
[1:09:47] and freckles
[1:09:50] she proved it to me
[1:09:54] you have the Holy Ghost yes what do you
[1:09:55] think about freckles I love them I said
[1:09:58] praise the Lord let's get married
[1:10:03] it's good enough for me
[1:10:05] he said God gave me my freckles so my
[1:10:08] wife could enjoy them
[1:10:12] and I was so mad at the freckles and God
[1:10:14] has a purpose even for freckled faced
[1:10:18] people
[1:10:23] glory be to God
[1:10:25] taking too much time tonight number 10
[1:10:28] of stinking thinking personalization and
[1:10:31] blame this is the belief that you're
[1:10:32] responsible for events outside of your
[1:10:35] control
[1:10:36] our team lost because of me
[1:10:42] it happened because of me events
[1:10:44] sometimes the force of nature can have
[1:10:47] something take place and we're going to
[1:10:48] take the blame for it sometimes God
[1:10:50] allows something to take place and we're
[1:10:52] going to take all the blame for it
[1:10:53] that's stinking thinking if you don't
[1:10:55] know if you have something you take the
[1:10:57] blame for but you don't take the blame
[1:10:59] for for things that you couldn't control
[1:11:01] can you say Amen take the bling and
[1:11:04] thinking or or thinking who's to blame
[1:11:05] trying to find somebody to blame a lot
[1:11:07] of times people don't blame themselves
[1:11:08] they blame other people and we're trying
[1:11:10] to find if something terrible happens
[1:11:11] who to blame for it I got to find
[1:11:13] somebody because I feel better about
[1:11:15] that sometimes there's no answer for it
[1:11:17] sometimes we won't know who's to blame
[1:11:19] for it sometimes the force of nature
[1:11:21] sometimes things happen
[1:11:23] and it's terrible and we're trying to
[1:11:26] explain the force of nature but it's the
[1:11:27] force of Nature and it's stinking
[1:11:29] thinking though to try to explain it try
[1:11:31] to take the blame for it and most all of
[1:11:33] this is just simply negative thought
[1:11:36] process and guess what friends I'm
[1:11:38] closing that all of these stinking
[1:11:40] thinking things all of these thoughts in
[1:11:42] our cognitive in our mind all of it
[1:11:44] keeps us defeated all the time but we
[1:11:47] are not defeated in Jesus Christ we are
[1:11:50] more than conquerors through Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ that loved us we are Sons and
[1:11:54] Daughters of God we are human beings but
[1:11:57] don't ever let that part dominate your
[1:12:00] life we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:02] created in the image of almighty God
[1:12:07] we're called to defeat the Devil can you
[1:12:09] say Amen musicians can come can you say
[1:12:12] man look at this what we're supposed to
[1:12:13] think about stand together with me if
[1:12:15] you would Philippians 4 8 and the
[1:12:17] Amplified finally does the bible tell us
[1:12:19] what to think about he is invited he he
[1:12:23] has asked us to invite his thoughts to
[1:12:25] invade our thoughts every day and to
[1:12:27] purge our thinking let me say it again
[1:12:29] I'm going to raise your hand and say I
[1:12:30] want his thoughts to invade my thoughts
[1:12:32] and my thoughts to be purged by the word
[1:12:35] of God
[1:12:36] every day his thoughts to purge my
[1:12:39] thoughts
[1:12:40] for Philippians 4 8 finding Believers
[1:12:42] whatever is true whatever is Honorable
[1:12:44] and worthy of respect whatever is right
[1:12:47] and confirmed by God's word whatever is
[1:12:49] pure whatever is wholesome whatever's
[1:12:52] lovely and brings peace
[1:12:55] whatever is admirable or of good repute
[1:12:57] if there is any Excellence if there's
[1:12:59] anything worthy of Praise think
[1:13:02] continually on these things Center your
[1:13:05] mind on those things and implant them
[1:13:07] into your heart not verse 9 the things
[1:13:10] which you have learned and received and
[1:13:12] heard and seen in me practice these
[1:13:15] things in daily life and The God Who is
[1:13:19] the source of peace and well-being will
[1:13:24] be with you
[1:13:27] I'm going to get all this from God in
[1:13:29] peace every day by just directing my
[1:13:31] thoughts
