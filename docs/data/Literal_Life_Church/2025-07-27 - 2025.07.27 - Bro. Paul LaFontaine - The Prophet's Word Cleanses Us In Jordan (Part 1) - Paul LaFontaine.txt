We have a wonderful group of people that help to serve in that area. So, we ask you to get them here on time to they can enjoy that 10:30 a.m. next Sunday. We're starting Sunday school again. We're thankful to give a break to the teachers for the summer, but we're going to resume that August 16th. We have a night of worship, a live recording.

And we have a lot of visitors from many different states and some countries coming in for that live recording and that night of worship. If you wanted to join us, we'd love to have you just worshiping the Lord together. We appreciate that. We appreciate sister Jerusa singing this morning. We missed the blessing of having her sing more because her and brother Blessing are um transferred. It's still happening. I've been trying to stop it, but it's going to happen. They have to move. We have enjoyed. What a great name for brother blessing because they and him and his wife has been a blessing to us and uh we hope someday we can fellowship together again and you guys can be back. May God bless you as they go to Florida and he finishes his doctor degree there. We send you with our blessings. God bless you guys and we appreciate you being in the congregation in that special this morning as well. 2 Kings chapter 5 and verse 9. We can read together. So non came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elijah Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. But non was wroth and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, &gt;&gt; you know, my dad used to say, that's where we get in trouble. Behold, I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper. Are not Abna and far uh Farpa uh rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? May I may I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. and his servants came near and spake unto him, and said, "My father, if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much rather than when he saith, wash and be clean?" I mean, the scripture in Isaiah, I think it is, he says, "Don't despise the day of small things." We're living in that day where God can get glory and bring deliverance through small things and small obedience to the Lord. Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. May the Lord add his blessings to the word this morning. God bless you. You may be seated. Once God sends a prophet and the prophet speaks that word, after that prophet is even gone, the word remains. &gt;&gt; And I would say it this way that once he speaks it to his prophet and his prophet goes on, it is out of the picture. What he said remains and it's there. If I can say it this way, it's in the land. God spoke spoke it and all of the purpose God gave with that word. It holds its purpose still. It holds purpose behind it. It holds power behind it. It will never return void to God. That's what the Bible says. God says, "My word will never return void." And we know he uses prophets to bring his word. But when he brings it and even after the prophet's gone, if that word has been spoken and it's in the land, it has the purpose in it. It has power in it. It'll go forth and reach into the whole earth. Can you say amen? And it will accomplish what God sends for it to do. There's nothing, and I say this, there's nothing Satan can do to stop that word &gt;&gt; once it's in motion. And when I say in motion, once it's been spoken and it's in the land and it goes out, there's nothing Satan can do to stop it, it's going to accomplish what God sent it to do. And so that should give us a great strength this morning. There's nothing Satan can ever do to stop it from reaching every seed and challenging the very worst of sin and habits in the people. Once that word has been spoken, it's going to go forth into every parts of the land. And it's going to reach his elected seed. It's going to call them. And then when that elected seed is bound by habits and sin and fear and whatever it is, that word is going to call the seed. And it's going to deliver them from any habits of this age, any leprosy, any sin. That word, the prophet doesn't have to be here, but the word is in the land. And the word will not return void. The word will still have the power in it. The word will still have a purpose in it. I'll tell you, you're not under a denominational word. You're living by a word that has power and has purpose in it. And it will accomplish in your life. Everything that you're missing, this word is going to provide. &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're not depending on Paula Fontaine. Can you say amen? And you're glad. You should be glad of that, too. Or any preacher for that matter. It's the word that the preacher preaches. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When I walk out every Sunday morning and walk into this, I say, "Well, thank God there's people here today." It's it's a, you know, it's nice because you see people hungry for the word of God. Can you say, "Amen." It would be bad if I walked out and nobody was here. It's hard to preach when nobody's there, but when people are there, then they know there's got to be something in this word for me. Can you say amen? And it's because when it's spoken by a prophet, it has the power within it to go forth and accomplish and in this case take us into a rapture. How many want to go in a rapture? This is a rapturing faith word that we're under. &gt;&gt; You'll never stop it. And when anybody who aligns themsself against a prophet's word, when anybody aligns himself against this, you're not aligning yourself against a prophet or the people who follow it. When you align yourself against the word of a prophet, that means trouble for you. &gt;&gt; Great trouble in your life. You've aligned yourself against the wrong thing. You can align yourself against the president, against country, against politics, your local government, but let me tell you something. When you align yourself against not a prophet, but against the prophet's word that's in the land, you've aligned yourself against the wrong thing. I'm amazed at this story of non so inspired on Wednesday night as our brother broke a few things to us. Brother Gideon from Nigeria. And I was so amazed I couldn't get over this. And although I want to go into some other things, I I just wanted to go back to this story after Wednesday night. And to to realize that Elisha was only actually carrying on the ministry of Elijah. That's interesting to us because we've had that spirit of Elijah return to this land according to scripture. If you're listening in, uh you'll be able to know from scripture that Elijah is used five times in the Bible. God so trusted that spirit to send that to speak to his people. And we're in the I believe the fourth time that God used it in our generation. He said, "I I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord." And he'll send that. It's God sending his servant. And then uh then he said, John the Baptist had the spirit of Elias Elias on him, Elijah. And so that he sends it again. He's going to send it one more time to the Jews according to the book of Revelations. But you see now in this incident when the first time Elijah come we realize that Elijah was uh was gone already and Elisha was there now and he had only received he received a double portion of Elijah's spirit. So we realize Elijah is not even there but the word of Elijah is still carrying on. The word of Elijah is still in the land. It was years later that he pronounced judgment over Jezebel. But it was after Elijah was gone that that judgment came to pass. because everything that he said, if it come from God, it's going to come to pass even when Elijah's gone. &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; So Elisha has a double portion of this. And Elisha is a type of the bride. He's not he's he's carrying on what Elijah had. And and Elisha and you even had that sh in there, that she it's the feminine part. He's the type of the bride. I love to read Elisha because that's the days we live in. and and and the incident with non is something that happened that's a type of our our time. So the bride is a prophetic people just like Elisha was carrying on the prophecy of Elijah. The bride listen now is a prophetic people because she is speaking and holding to the same word under Elijah. &gt;&gt; We're not just Christians but we're a people. We're a prophetic people. We're under a prophecy. Can you say amen? We're under a word that's God has put in the land and not just in the land. Then he puts it in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is not just church. This is not just another gathering of Christians. No, we are a prophetic people carrying out God's word for this age. &gt;&gt; And uh it it it's an amazing word. It's a powerful word. And it's nothing in ourselves. But she she is a prophetic people because she's speaking and holding to the same word of Elijah. Elijah's word is in the land. It's in his people. His servants are carriers of that word. They don't have the power, but they have the authority with that word to use the power of God. Like a policeman, he doesn't have any power within himself, but he has authority. And he has all the city backing him up. Every believer here this morning has all of heaven backing you up. You don't have a power but you have authority to use the power of God. You don't want a power within yourself. You can do nothing but you have access to the power of God which is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then the the that word reaches all the way now now just catch this that word reaches all the way out to the even to the headquarters of the Syrian army to a man named non who was a captain in the Syrian army. So watch how far that word goes now. It reaches all the way to the headquarters of the enemy army Syrian army uh the ones that fighting against Israel. The word reaches in there by a little maid girl that's she's away. She's in captivity. But the word of the prophet reaches through a little maid girl. And she sees an incident and there's no cure for it. There's no cure for leprosy. But she knows there's a prophetic word. There's a prophet. There is a source that's in the land for deliverance for something that's completely incurable. How many know how many incurable diseases we got today? And we're trying to get sights. We're trying to tackle all of them. But listen now. When there's no cure for a habit or a sin or a demon, there is a cure within the land and we are witnesses to that. &gt;&gt; We are carriers of that word. this little girl, she starts to hear this and I'm getting ahead of myself, but she just says, "Listen, there's a word in the land. &gt;&gt; If you can get to that word, leprosy is not leprosy is not a problem." &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I feel like shouting this morning. &gt;&gt; Do you know that beyond what you think of yourself, the word that he's put in this land and put in your heart is more powerful than any demon that can come against your life. It's more powerful than any anxiety. It's more powerful than any trial in your life. It's not you, it's the word he's placed within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word reached all the way to the headquarters of a army that was fighting against Israel and a little maid girl working in non's home in captivity. Away from all the comfort of her own people and her own church, away from all the comforts. We got it pretty nice today. We got believers that we can fellowship with. We got to cover our children have a pretty safe place to be. But this girl was taken away from her parents, away from her church just like Daniel was and his friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. They were taken into Babylon, away from Jerusalem, away from the comfort of being able to go to church every week. And we don't know how much pressures will come against. But when that word, when you're carrying that word, you can be in the worst of Babylon. You can be in the worst of atmospheres. Can I get an amen this one? You can be in in your employment or your school in the worst of atmospheres and you're carrying something within you. That's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't ever underestimate that word and where it will reach and the witness of it. Right. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the last days message of Christ that we preach is man-made, it should have never reached as far as it has today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I preach the message of Christ for the last days, and if it was man-made, it would have never reached as far as it's reached. &gt;&gt; True. because it's God's word &gt;&gt; where it's it's going gone into country countries that to me and I could elaborate on this but to me I it it went against all communism in countries. It's getting into places that it's never going to get in there. It's never going to be accepted there. But somehow it's getting in cuz God's looking for his elected seed. Don't ever estimate where the word will reach and the witness of it. If this last days messes of Christ is man-made, it would have never reached as far as this. God had a little cleaning girl way away from her people, but she got a source that she can tell pe people about. And as she heard conversations in the home like, and I'm just elaborating, how in the world did our great captain non get leprosy? Our master, he's honorable. He's mighty. He's a mighty warrior. How in the world did he get lep leprosy? It's not fair. We learned something this morning. We learned that leprosy, which is a type of sin, can affect anyone. &gt;&gt; It's a captain in the Syrian army. And the Bible says in chapter 5 and verse one, a man with his master in honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. He was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper. And so this teaches us something. sin, leprosy can get to anybody. I don't care how much money you have. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; He He was It can Your position in the world doesn't matter. Your money doesn't matter. Your status does not make you I hope you're listening online this morning as well and on the broadcast. Sin can reach if you've got all the money in the world. If you got all the position in the world, if you're the president, whatever position, your status does not make you immune from the disease of sin. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this, &gt;&gt; the disease of sin, except by the blood and the token, we're not immune from it either. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm in the message. I've been in the message for 40 years. Those things don't bother me. You live in the flesh, my brother. Twothirds of you is not born again. And if you give yourself to the wrong thing, you'll take on the disease of sin. It may not get to your soul, but it'll start to work in your life. You feed on the wrong things and you're going to start taking the disease of sin in your life. You're going to It doesn't matter because sin will go to any it'll take you further than you want to go. It touched a a mighty warrior here that would have never expected. And that's why we need to realize we start saying, "Well, this is unfair. That person lives such a good life. Why were they struck with this disease? Anybody ever said that? &gt;&gt; It just seems so unfair that they would get this particular let somebody else get it. That's a bad person. &gt;&gt; No, Satan don't work that way. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't work that way. He goes for the juggler. He goes for anybody and especially believers. &gt;&gt; If he would want to strike somebody with cancer, he's going to strike a believer. But he doesn't know when he strikes a believer, he's in big trouble. &gt;&gt; When he strikes a believer, he's dealing with something different because he he didn't he's not going to know what hit him. Can you say amen? He's not going to know what hit him because he struck the wrong thing, &gt;&gt; the wrong person. Because if they're carrying that word, if God decides to take them, that's still up to God. That's still a victory in God. But listen now, he tries to get this to believers and all these diseases, especially the disease s, you know, the disease of sin is worse than cancer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and we get nervous about that and and and and sometimes we're human, we do that. But let me tell you what you feed on in worldly things. And the disease you can get from that is worse than the disease of cancer. &gt;&gt; The disease of the mind and the disease of uh things that come to your spirit, emotions, and mind, it's worse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we learn that leprosy, sin can affect anyone. Your position in the world, all these other things doesn't matter. But also we learn that this word will reach anyone. So the the the disease of sin, leprosy struck somebody that we wouldn't expect. But you see now we also the positive thing is the word that will deliver them will reach anyone as well. This little young person must have had the belief that the healing is in the word and it was for everyone. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been testifying in the house. She believed it was for everyone. She believed this word. If they'll respond to it and go to it, it's for everyone. Listen, we don't have a right to be exclusive with this message. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's for everyone who will believe. &gt;&gt; I know there's predestinated seed. I know there's categories, but we don't worry about this category. That little girl said she if she would have been selective, if she would have been said, "Well, these guys aren't even believers and they're the enemy." If she'd have had that attitude, he wouldn't have got his deliverance. Before she even said something, she had to have the attitude, "This word is for everybody." &gt;&gt; If she'd have looked at that man and said, "This is a cusser. He's cussing all the time around. I can't even stand the atmosphere. He's drinking. He's got all kinds of this stuff around his body. He's, you know, if we judge people by how they look on the outside, then we'll start thinking this word must have been for me &gt;&gt; and not them. &gt;&gt; She didn't do that. She didn't have that attitude. &gt;&gt; Anybody listening this morning? I'm trying to correct a lot of message pride that says we're better than everybody else and we got an exclusion on this word. it's ours and we're going into rapture and the rest of us can and fodder. That's that's terms that a prophet can use. But you be careful how you use those because you might rule somebody out. &gt;&gt; She's here. She's hearing them talk and say, "Why does this have to come to him for days? This is not fair. He's got this leprosy all over his skin. He could die of it." And even though there was no cure, the word of a prophet, she she pipes up and says, "I know a man. If you can get to him, if you can get there, you can be delivered of this leprosy." &gt;&gt; A minister spoke one time on deception. And we know the bride of Christ, his wife, can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. The bride can't be deceived. But but the bride and all people can be affected with the disease sometimes temporarily. Even though they're not completely deceived, you can come under a deception temporarily. You have to realize we're not above temptation. How many can say amen to that? We're not above temptation. Not above being affected by spiritual diseases. We're not above that. Um we we we can never as a believer, it can never lead us to death. spiritual uh uh the the death angel if we have the token cannot fully strike the home that way but but it can try to infect the home. It can try to affect a believer. It can never lead to death or denying Christ but it sure can afflict us sometime. It's like a snake bite. It's like some people get a snake bite and they get poisoned. Some people die of it, but some people get healed. Some people are poisoned for a time once they have that poison in their system. That's a type of us. We may not die of a spiritual disease, but we can be temporarily poisoned. &gt;&gt; We can be temporarily tempted and sometimes on the surface deceived by something and God in his grace wakes us up and God purges us and God heals us. It's like some people listen too much to the internet and they leave the message because they've been poisoned. I pray for those people because hopefully hopefully they just been bit. They listen to the the hiss of the serpent just like Eve did. Can I get an amen this morning? You're on that stuff. You're listening to the hiss of the serpent. Well, a snake, if you stay close to it, it'll bite you. I hate snakes. I stay away from snakes. And the two things with snakes, if you're a little boy, you want to play with snakes, you you shouldn't do that because the pleasure will be short &gt;&gt; and the pain will be great. Right. &gt;&gt; It's good advice. &gt;&gt; I learned that when I was a little boy, &gt;&gt; go ahead and play with them. &gt;&gt; But the the the pleasure will be short and the pain will be great. &gt;&gt; And these people listen to all this stuff on the internet and it poisons you. I've watched people poison, but I've watched God heal them of that poison. And they come back to say there's no other. I've watched them go to theological colleges and schools and spend 20 years of their life trying to dispel this thing and they come right back and saying there's not never been a supernatural God express himself than through this ministry and this last days what he's doing in the bride. This is where God is is trying to work through his people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let me get done with I just want to add this in. You can be bit by a snake. Some die, some don't. So we need to pray for the people that are poisoned by the by by the wrong spirit that they don't die of it spiritually &gt;&gt; that they're healed. &gt;&gt; Leprosy is an infectious disease. How many knew that leprosy is an infectious disease and it's on the skin by the way which we might point out that leprosy is a type of sin. Brother Bram says and leprosy is is a skin disease. It gets on the sink. Brother Gideon said Wednesday night, he said it actually comes from a bacteria and that bacteria can come from the food that you're eating. Believe it or not, it came through the food back in that day. Bacteria can come through food. So he preaching up a storm Wednesday night. Listen to that service was really great. He's we got to feed on the right things. We're taking the book. We're feeding on the book. This open book of redemption. Can you say amen? But you're on your social media and all those things for 24/7. I'm rarely on my phone and I still get a time slot at the end of the week. You've been on your phone 3 hours every day this week and I'm going, "No, not me. How? Who in the world?" The three hours. No, but I know if I'm 3 hours and don't think that I'm on it, uh, I think some of you need to take a look at your time on the phone. &gt;&gt; I know I won't get a lot of shouts and glory and amens out of that. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you straight, you better be have your Holy Ghost armor on. Can you say in mind? You better be holding because this stuff brings in sin subtly &gt;&gt; on the surface. But you see, see now it's on the surface. Not inside you yet, but it can move on the inside and it leprosy can kill. That was what their worry and fear was. The surface the surface things of sin has the potential to kill you. And we think it's okay on the surface. We think a lot of things are okay on the surface. Leprosy came on the surface first &gt;&gt; and when you get something they had no cure for this but when we get infectious diseases and different things I remember my wife got sick of salmonella she got really sick from a restaurant we went to MRI was just born she was a she was a preeie and so my wife in those first two weeks which I got my father-in-law and mother-in-law here uh today uh brother Emanuel sister Carol I forgot to announce them there a great honor to have them in the service today. Let's give them a hand. Amen. God bless you guys. It'd be a joy to be with him this week. A joy to have in the service. They don't travel too much anymore. So, we're glad to have him. And my father-in-law is not so bad. Even though he keeps me in my place, you know, when I married Becca and they said, "You're a Lefontaine. That don't matter to me. You put your pants on the same as everybody else." &gt;&gt; So, he keeps me in line. He keeps me humble. I like my mother-in-law a little better than my father-in-law, actually. She cooks some good biscuits. &gt;&gt; I can't use any of the mother-in-law jokes on my mother-in-law. She's a wonderful woman and she wanted me as a son-in-law. She didn't care who which daughter that I married of her family. She wanted me as a son-in-law. So, we've had a really good relationship for 32 years. How How did I get into this? Why am I talking about my mother-in-law? Oh, she was here when my wife gets sick. So, she's in the hospital in Flower Hospital. She's up on the third or fourth floor there and they're saying that she's and she's fading out. I can tell that this may end up in a death. And I I'm I'm desperate. I'm just a young father and young husband. And so, it's a it's a disease. So, it's just something that's come in her system, in her blood. And uh she's going on going on. And the regular doctors, you know, they're just saying this is not looking good. Then my daughter Rya gets it and she's down and uh uh Mama Wade has to come in and take care of her while my wife is in the hospital. And then my my daughter gets it and she's down in emergency at Flower Hospital. A lot of you know Flower Hospital. She's down emergency just on the verge of dying. My daughter my wife's on the verge of dying upstairs. And uh my mother-in-law's down there. You remember this, Sister Carol? And she's down there and she's I had to go upstairs and see my wife. I stopped by in the bathroom. I'm just weeping and asking God. I said, "If I have to go through what brother Brandon went through, then you'll give me grace, but oh God, would you have mercy on my family at this moment?" And uh so she's down there when I was away and she sees Rya uh just kind of tighten up and the the line on the meter, what's it called? The &gt;&gt; heart. It goes straight. It goes Is that when they're going? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, and it just goes and she sees it and Rya stops breathing and mammo goes, "Satan, I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." And Rya just takes a breath like that and she's she's here in the service this morning. God spared my daughter. &gt;&gt; And God spared my wife as well. Amen. These are people of faith here, &gt;&gt; Brother Emanuel, Sister Carol. They believe that God is still God. And uh but I just wanted to say that they had to bring in she was about ready to go and I I know I give the glory to God, but they brought in an infectious disease specialist. And after a week, they thought we better bring in a specialist. And I'm going, why didn't you bring him in the first day, you know, but when he when they she came in a specialist in this? And I was only saying it to realize that we've got diseases and we've got things today. It don't just take a general doctor. It takes a specialist. And I want to tell you, our Lord Jesus is a specialist in every disease of sin. My doctor is a specialist in every disease of leprosy and sin. &gt;&gt; And he come in there. She come in there and she said, "Oh yeah, I know what this is." And and within a few days, she was out of the hospital. I give God glory. But it took a specialist. I'll tell you, in this age, it takes a specialist for the problems. It takes a specialist for the diseases. &gt;&gt; They're too subtle. Can you say amen? us preachers, if we don't yield to the Lord, we don't preach the things. If we don't get in the mind of the Lord, then we can't address the things Satan is bringing subtly into people's lives and young people's lives. &gt;&gt; So, we pray, God, you're the specialist. Bring a word that delivers your people cuz this is too subtle of disease. Sometimes it's on a surface and people are begin to get that surface of leprosy sin. They don't even realize it, but it's got to be exposed. It's got to be dealt with by a specialist. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I want to say thank you to the young people for a couple of days of wonderful refreshment and fellowship and and joy. It was such a restful time the last couple days with them. I enjoy all of them. We have shared in the word. And I'll just tell you, I don't say this to boast, but I just give glory to God. On Thursday night when we shared in the word from our hearts, the Holy Spirit come down in that living room and we prayed together. And I'm telling you, he was present. He was on the scene. Just 20 of us there. But all the young people, how many raise your hand and testify our Lord was present in that room. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that because in this age and this time of 2025, we need more than just head knowledge. We need more than just somebody said just believe or prophet. No, we need the reality and the power of that word. &gt;&gt; And we need an infectious disease specialist. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need it this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There are some diseases so subtle and creep in so slow that it takes a a specialist, not just a regular doctor. The way sin creeps in our life today, it takes the word. A word that's got a word that's got the devil's number and knows what he's talking about. Just as God makes a way of escape from temptation. How many believe God will make a way of escape from temptation? Yes, the Bible says that. But you see now, he also makes a way and a remedy for every part of sin. the nature of sin and the influence of sin. It's not just having the nature of sin that you're born with. Calvary, the blood takes care of the very nature of sin. That's why you need a new birth because you were born with the nature of sin. That's why you like to sin. That's why you like to you're attracted to the things of the world. That's the nature of sin. Calvary kills the nature and desire of sin. &gt;&gt; But also, there's an influence of sin. And the blood also has power. The word has power against the influence of sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you know, being under the feast of atonement spiritually is where we're at at now. If you know your Bible and know as these feasts have been restored, starting with Jesus Christ, the the the uh the feast of the Old Testament that they worshiped under, Christ fulfilled every one of them. the feast of Passover, uh the feast of Pentecost. As time has went on in 2,000 years, we see those the spiritual fulfillment of the feast fulfilled in the bride. Christ doing it, but many of them through the bride. Now, we're in the day of the feast of atonement being restored. And I I just wanted to touch on this to say the feast of atonement that we're living in now is not another killing of the lamb. That was that was the feast of the lamb. That was the feast. But if you read in Leviticus 23, uh if you write it down, you read all the feasts of the Old Testament, all seven, and you'll read in there, read the feast of uh atonement that I'm talking about this morning, because you will find it's not another killing of the lamb, but what we find in that feast of atonement that it's a washing, it's a it's and and God knew that the feast of atonement was needed today more than any other time because he knew how dirty and how diseaseinfested the world would become. &gt;&gt; And he knew the bride would live in it. But he's not left us without a specific word to deal with it. &gt;&gt; And we we do what we we lean to the word to keep oursel out of temptation, but how to and how to escape it, but then how to quickly be cleansed of a disease. This is the day of atonement in this hour. And you'll find in the atonement if you read it there, it wasn't another killing of the lamb, but it was a a mourning or a conviction or a repentance in that. So, in other words, Christ didn't go have to go to Calvary again. He was the Passover lamb. He already fulfilled that. But this in this feast of atonement, it's a restoration back to what our atonement did for us. &gt;&gt; And when the message was revealed to us, it brought us back to the true atonement. Let me quote the prophet. He says that this this message of the last days brings us out of Pentecostal and world traditions &gt;&gt; to the genuine atonement, the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. This message was to bring us out of out of Pentecostal and world traditions. Boy, I could preach another sermon on that. This message has not come to take us back into Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That's a deception. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message has come to bring us out of Pentecostal and world traditions to the genuine atonement, the word. &gt;&gt; Why do we need the word resto? Why do we need a word in the last days? Because in the word, it's bleeding for us. It has a washing. It's the washing of the water by the word. &gt;&gt; And more than any other healing, God is healing cancer here. God is God is doing mighty things because his atonement are provided for it. But you know what you need the atonement for in this hour more than anything? To clean you and wash you &gt;&gt; from the filthiness and the disease of sin. &gt;&gt; The word washes us. &gt;&gt; The priests in the Old Testament were washed and dressed by the prophet. &gt;&gt; This word is washing a people and cleaning a people. Why? Because in the end time, she'll get dirtied again. Satan wants to dirty her. &gt;&gt; You stay in this word. It'll wash you. &gt;&gt; Non. It'll wash you. &gt;&gt; It'll clean you. &gt;&gt; You're a clean through my word. Jesus said, can you say amen? Jesus said, you're a clean through my word. Praise the Lord. I'm going to have to skip some of this here. Now, if you want to know what hour we're living in, we're under the feast of atonement. The message calls us out of Pentecostal world traditions to the genuine atonement, the word. This is a washing like no other. God knew at the end time how dirty and how diseaseinfested this world would be. He knew the bride would be living in it. And he has not left us without a specific word to deal with it. What to do to keep oursel out of temptation. We know what to do. The word. Can you say amen? And also to quickly be cleansed of the disease of sin. I just want to make a note. This is why this church, Literal Life Church, is here. It's to preach the power of the blood through the word. &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about. Can you say saving people from their sin, their leprosy? &gt;&gt; That's for you. And that's for anyone who walks through that door. We preach the power of the blood of Jesus Christ, which is the only remedy for sin. &gt;&gt; I should get bigger amens to that. That's what this church is all about. You have a strange person show up, I believe we should embrace him and welcome him or her. And I believe we should create do everything in our power to create an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit can come down and they be washed in the blood of the lamb. You have a part in that. You're not just coming to church to sit there like a bump on a log. But when you worship, when you say amen, when you join in, you're creating an atmosphere &gt;&gt; that his power of his blood can purge the leprosy, clean the people, and the worst sinner that walks through these doors, you ought to create an atmosphere so they can be delivered. That's what this church is about. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you came in this morning all consumed by other thoughts, the music, the temperature, I believe the music is part of it. But if you got your mind on the music or what temperature it's too hot or too cold in here, or the problems that's in the church, which we're not immune from that, or how you look to everybody or you're thinking about your job or your money, shame on us for coming to church that way. It's an important time to come and see the blood do its work. Everybody should have a chance at this. &gt;&gt; And you have a responsibility to not only be clean yourself, but to say we have a word here that can clean any. The worst of sinner, the worst of habits, the worst of addictions, the worst of panic attacks, the worst of depression is under the atonement. If you believe that like I believe it, we ought to stand together every service Wednesday night or Sunday and create an atmosphere &gt;&gt; that he comes down and says, "I'm pleased in this atmosphere." It's not people that are, you know, I just say something as a little rebuke from the pastor. God didn't call us here to just sit on the sit like a bunk on bump on the log and not say, "Amen, just be quiet and go back out again." No, we engage because we're part of bringing our lick of fire. You're part of that young person. You're part of that. &gt;&gt; Sometimes this becomes too intellectual where we just come and hear in a sermon. We get in our cars and go. We're not here just to hear a sermon. We're here to see what he can do in our lives. For the word to clean us, wash us. That that river from Calvary because we've created Aperture will flow right from Calvary right through this whole audience. Somebody say, "It's gone. It's finished. It's done." &gt;&gt; That's why when the Holy Spirit come down in that youth meeting the other night, that girl confessed something. She said, "I've never confessed this before." Many of them were confessing things and conf the Bible says, "I didn't ask for that." The Bible says, "Confess your faults one to another. You expose the devil." And God becomes pleased at the honesty, the humility, and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit drops down. We begin to pray. But it's because she said, "I believe because I've done this tonight. I believe this is over tonight. This that I've had most of my life, it's done tonight." And I said, "If you're going to confess that, we're going to stand and pray right now and stand behind that confession. Right now. It can be done right now." That's what we should be believing. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they'll get it someday. No, you better seize that moment. &gt;&gt; You might ought to seize it this morning and say, you know, whatever is the devil bothering me, I'm going to confess it's going to be over and I'm going to leave this building this morning without that habit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we talk about waiting on the Lord. But when he moves the waters, you better get in the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you thinking about that's too much of a trouble in your life? What are you thinking about? Don't keep thinking about it. Confess it before the Lord. Say, "God, I want you to take this thing right now. &gt;&gt; This pornography, this temptation, this this thing that's binding my life, this bitterness towards other people. &gt;&gt; Take it right now. &gt;&gt; Let the flow of the washing of the word wash through here and just wash it out of my life. &gt;&gt; I feel his presence here this morning so real." Hallelujah. Somebody lift your hand. Say, "God, I receive what you have for me this morning. I receive it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; I take it because it's the word you've given for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, we are the church. We stand as a church that way. We stand being washed of our sin and our spirits and our attitudes and our habits and our prejudice and our pride. That's why we come to church. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even leprosy, they never had a cure for it for thousands of years. Did you know the physical disease of leprosy, they never had a cure in the Bible, of course, but they never had a cure for leprosy until the 20th century. &gt;&gt; Well, isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; They never found a care. And brother Bram says that's a type of sin. And I know he went to Calvary and he paid the price. But now we come in Satan's Eden, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the people of God living in that. We're going to need a revelation of what our atonement has done for us. &gt;&gt; I said we're going to need a revelation &gt;&gt; and worship under this feast of atonement. And I forgot to mention you in Leviticus 23. It's a mourning. It it is a repentance. It's not another killing of the lamb. You'll see in there it's also don't get don't work that day. Don't work that because what is our feast of atonement? It's rest. You'll see the word rest. It's a rest. Don't you dare go to work. Don't you dare do that. What are we resting in? The finished work of Calvary. This is not another killing of the lamb, but it's a feast that we worship. I'm resting in what the lamb has done for me. I don't have to get to heaven by my works. &gt;&gt; I'm resting in a finished work. &gt;&gt; And the last thing he says, I love this part about the feast of atonement. It is your day to celebrate. &gt;&gt; Celebrate what? Celebrate our atonement. &gt;&gt; I am covered. Covered. Covered by his blood. &gt;&gt; Walking by faith. What are you doing? I'm celebrating my atonement. Living in love. I am covered. Covered. Covered by his blood. Oh Jesus has rescued me. Anybody else want to celebrate? I am covered. Covered, covered by his blood. Oh, walking by faith. Oh, living in love. I am covered, covered, covered by his blood. Oh, Jesus has rescued me. It's not another killing of the lamp. It's celebrating our atonement. &gt;&gt; It's worshiping and saying, "God, did you really do this for me? That there isn't any addiction? There isn't any sin. There is no leprosy that this atonement didn't cover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to be happy about that. &gt;&gt; It's time to celebrate. &gt;&gt; Boy, when that lamb took the book, there was worship going on. In Revelations 1, they worshiped because he was Lord. They worshiped because of his creation. In Revelations 5, they worship because of redemption. &gt;&gt; That's a deeper worship. A lot of the church world is worshiping their songs saying because of creation. That's great. But when you come to the power of redemption and what Calvary's done for you, it's time to celebrate. It's time to worship. &gt;&gt; It's time to shout, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Because you see now people like you can come and you say, "I don't feel worthy and I got all this baggage and I' I've come through a divorce." Whatever it is this morning, the atonement says if you'll repent and mourn and say, "God, I bring my life under this feast of atonement." He says he'll answer back, "Forgive you completely." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You no longer had to sit there this morning thinking, "This is for everybody else, but I'll never get in." That's a lie of the devil. This blood is for your mistakes. This blood is for your sin. Lift your hand and receive it this morning. It's for me. It's for my problems. It's for what I've come through. Every one of you have a story. And none of you wanted the story that you got. &gt;&gt; But you have a story. And the story doesn't end with just your problems. The story ends in redemption. &gt;&gt; The story ends in redemption. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your biography, your book is going to end not because you perfected yourself, but because the blood washed you clean. &gt;&gt; How many want to be clean? Washed in the water of his word. Clean of this leprosy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I you know, I know I can't I can't finish preaching this morning. I think we ought to stand and rejoice and celebrate our atonement. &gt;&gt; I'll finish this wherever God says to finish it. But you ought to lift, shout, "Thank you, Lord. Glory be to God. Thank you for my atonement, Lord. Thank you for what you did for me. It was for my problems. It was for my past mistakes. It's for my habits. It was for my addictions. It's for my sin that I did last year or last week. This is God. I confess it. There has to be a true repentance to say, "God, I repent." How many would say before this, "I repent. &gt;&gt; I repent. I I I God, I bring it to you. Whatever it is, I bring it to you. Father, I pray, Lord, that you will come, Lord, and just once again identify yourself among your people." Lord, we could ask for a lot of things. There's many sicknesses and many things, and we ask for those things. But Lord, we are celebrating and rejoicing that your washing of the water of the word is still here for your people. And if the mind has become dirty through social media, if the spirit has been tainted and dirtied, if we've even taken on filthy spirits, may your blood cleanse us as we repent this morning. Let it wash it all away in Jesus name. In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say praise our God. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to lift some praise to him this morning. The musicians can come, but you don't need music to praise the Lord. You don't need to sing a song. You just say, "Lift your voice. Say, I thank you, Lord. Deliver me, Lord. Wash me, Lord. Wash me of all those things. Let me come Lord before your presence in this day of atonement. This feast of atonement. Let it be a celebration. You know friends, the message rank sometimes is they're debating this feast of atonement. They're debating over the atonement. Who's in? Who's out? Let's stop debating the atonement and start celebrating our atonement. &gt;&gt; I say it online. Let's stop debating this message. Let's start celebrating the atonement. Let's start worshiping about it. Let's let the effect of this atonement affect us in our lives instead of debating about what season we're in and what feast we're in and all these other things. I told you I believe we're in the feast of atonement cuz the next one is the feast of tabernacles, the last one. And God's going to fulfill that too. You know what it is? It's little tents, little places, little dwelling places. Guess what? When we go in a rapture, we're getting a new dwelling place. And that's when we'll fill we'll fill the feast of fulfill the feast of tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Getting ready to cross over into my little tent. &gt;&gt; And it's a word body. It never gets sick and never can be tempted. The devil can't whisper in my ear. And that's the next feast I'm headed towards. But before I get there, I'm worshiping under this feast of atonement. Look what the Lord has done for me. &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord has done for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners. Oh, give him glory. people for his blood has washed away each sin. Let me hear you sing it now. Oh, I will praise him. Yes, I will praise him. Praise the L for Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blood can wash away. Let our lamb hear your voices. Sing it without the music. Let the lamb hear your voice. I &gt;&gt; I will praise you &gt;&gt; with all your heart now. &gt;&gt; I will praise him. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the lamb for sinners. Oh, give him glory, oh ye people. For his blood has washed away, each day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah Lord. Hallelujah. And when the book was open, they worshiped. They praised because he has made us kings and priests. We have been redeemed by his blood. Out of every kindred and nation and people, out of every situation, out of every story, you've redeemed them. You You brought us back. Your word has found us, Lord. May no matter if we're raised in the message or raised in the world or you found us. You found us. Your redemption found us. And that's why our hearts are joyful this morning. Let me say before we sing again, this atonement feast is not without repentance. And deliverance is not without repentance. Non had to dip seven times in a river. He didn't want to. When God asks you to dip in humility seven times, wherever he asked you to do, would you have the repentance in your heart? You're not going to get there without saying, "Lord, I repent for what I've done. I'm sorry, Lord. Can I please have access to this blood of the precious lamb?" How many would do it just now? If you haven't given your life to the Lord, if you haven't rededicated your life to Jesus Christ, maybe you're coming to church, but you haven't rededicated. I'm encouraging you other this feast. When you are saying, I mourn for my sins. I mourn for what I've done, but now I want to celebrate. I don't want to be free in Jesus name. Bless those hearts. Bless those lives, Lord. God, you'll not leave one of them out, Lord, that are called. You reached all the way over into the Syrian army to a non who was stubborn, who's prideful, thought he was too big to go in the Jordan, but you reached out. Your word went to him and found him. May your word reach out to every person here this morning. And may your word reach out to this community. May you find your elected seed. I'm asking for them, Lord. May they hear us on the broadcast. May they come to visit. May they hear through a witness of a servant that's standing here. But may you find your last elected seed in this community and this area and bring them to the washing of the water of the word. Not to a church, but to the washing. Lord, &gt;&gt; grant it.

My daughter called me and said, "Dad, what should I do? Should we trust in God? Should I turn this kidney down? Just believe in God." So I got a hold of brother Paul. I said, "Brother Paul, what should I do? My daughter's crying." She said, "Should we just trust in God and not take this kidney?" And he said, "Brother, if God hasn't established the healing yet, go what the doctors are doing." &gt;&gt; So but listen to brother Paul said, "Lonnie, this is what we need to do."
