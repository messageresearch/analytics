TRANSCRIPT
========================================
get my clock all right verse 21 it says keep yourselves in love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some having compassion i believe what a day we're in that we should have compassion for one another the world's the choir saying they sing about a crook the world's basically falling apart but our god is the peacemaker he's our all-in-all but we should have compassion for one another and it says making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spoiled by the flesh you may be seated father we just come before your throne tonight father we just come as an oracle for you lord not to be seen by any men father just to be in your perfect will tonight father may you speak to these youth may you come down in the mighty way lord may you touch their lives father this is where lives change in your presence father may you just anoint the service we thank you for the song service so far in your presence may you come down in a mighty way tonight we love you in jesus name amen i love that tonight where it says verse 22 and some of having compassion making a difference what a great time we're in to make a difference for the world i know it it seems like it's impossible but i tell you a christian can make a difference you young people can make a difference for jesus christ you can shine a light i don't care what the devil tells you what your friends at school or wherever you go to school at but you can make a difference in this dark world because if you ever took a flashlight and walked and i don't care if it's barely have any batteries in it and you turn it on and all the power goes out you turn on the weakest light and it could be the strongest light in that pres in that darkness it will light the whole room up and you don't even realize how much light you need so don't let the devil tell you that you can't be a light in this darkness and it says and others say with fear pulling them out of the fire and i believe one of what a greater time of the battle of satan is fighting all these young people today on every mind every mind battle you're going through but he's going to pull you out of the fire that's one thing i want to hone in tonight is having the whole armor of god on and every situation everything you do is to be equipped for the battle is to be equipped for the battle and so let's turn to ephesians ephesians tonight ephesians 6. verse 10. it says finally my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of his might if you're you want to under underline some words tonight the other underlying strong power and might you can be strong in the lord and you have his power of his might not your might tonight but it takes his might tonight now i want to just tell you young people paul is not writing this letter and he's not in sitting at his desk somewhere paul is in a prison paul his last words i want you to understand tonight some of the last words can be some of the strongest and more profound words today but he's he's saying something to you tonight could you write a letter like this and encourage the saints being in a prison cell paul's not home he's got some last words to tell you to be strong in the lord and the power of his might and it says put on the whole armor of god that you may able to stand against the wiles of the devil the so he's equipping you today he's equipping you with something to fight the devil and that's not the devil knows what spot brother said he knows what you've got to cover that spot up brother says he knows this weakest spot a christian has or we have as as believers and we have to cover that up the day we live in but i tell you i tell you it's one of one more time to cover that up one more time to shield it with with the lord jesus christ brother graham says oh i'm telling you when as soon as you say you've got the holy ghost satan's got every gun right on you he said then you got the whole armor on then you you take the of faith the sword of the spirit or the word and take the buckle and shod yourself with the gospel and take the old middle piece here the breastplate and pull and clench it up and tighten yourself a little bit and get ready boy because it's coming don't you worry he said yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble but remember greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world that's the promise tonight that's what he says in the word and we got to take it take it i think we got to take the entire word and we got to clothe ourselves tonight with it he also says satan has no power only as he can bluff with it if he can bluff you into it all right you have it he said you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every power that was taken from him at calvary every power young people was taken at calvary i think sometimes we give them too much authority we give them too much credit and we're living in a day that we want to give the devil credit the only one worthy of credit is jesus christ and it's time to give him credit where credits do not to the devil but to jesus christ [Applause] he said he's doing nothing but a bluff he said if you ever want to listen to his all bl his bluff well all right but you don't have to you are free tonight so young people if you come chained up and you've been listening to his bluff he's been telling you this telling you that telling you're not a believer if you haven't met jesus christ and you haven't met him as a personal savior i encourage you tonight i provoke you tonight to meet jesus christ because i'm telling you if he could change this person he could change anyone tonight he said and now some some he says something in the word can make you realize that you are free by his grace he said if something realized in the word makes you understand or act of god that it that is included you it includes us all then you just accept it on those bases he said in your free you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all it's not based upon jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it it's faith he said that's our faith faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds the two the sharp two-edged sword of god and that sharp two-edged short will cut away every promise if the arm the faith is able to yield that sword some people have has very weak muscle trouble and he says they can just maybe cut a little scratch enough to join a church others can just come into justification some can go all the way to the baptism of the holy spirit he said a strong arm holding this bible can cut every promise tonight that's right be strong in the lord so young people i'm here to tell you you're going to go through battles you're going to go through troubled waters you're gonna go through uh dating relationships tonight that will lead you to the wrong person you're by being it tonight i don't know but i'm just here to tell you you you need to line up with the bible tonight everything you do you need to line up from jesus to revelation and every every person you talk to everything you do hey if they're not of god then get away from them you know what because you know why you stay in a pig pen long enough you'll become just muddled up like a pig as well but i'm here to tell you young people to stay out of the pig pit i'm not saying go talk to them and encourage them but don't get caught up being sucked in to where they're at don't be caught up sucking the devil telling you well i'm i'm strong enough no we're not strong enough with our might it takes jesus christ in jesus christ alone and you gotta use his might tonight it's a dark world and it's it's chaos but i tell you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world let's go to verse 12. for we wrestle not listen against flesh and blood but blood grants principalities against powers against rulers of darkness in this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and brother bram says he says in this he's talking about in the scriptures he said that's right oh my precious faith precious glorious faith god gave me faith god gave me faith by abraham by faith isaac by faith abel offered him to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain he said yeah he died yet testified oh how we need faith he said i love him i want more faith my desire in this life and for you for this new year coming is more faith in god more faith than god i believe god said hey more faith you hear of rumbling out there more faith more faith he says satan fights at me he fights at you he tries to shoot his arrows but may i have that shield of faith always before me to withstand the wiles of the devil he said he said to knock off his fiery darts is my sincere prayer god bless you a super sense 1959. let's go down to verse 13 wherefore we take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day i believe we're in the evil day i believe he's speaking to us we're in such an evil day listen what he says and haven't done all to stand just stand in jesus christ stand for what you believe be proud for what you believe paul be proud you stand up like heidi wright tonight and i'll tell you it gave her the salvation of her of her boys and i tell you what i'm not ashamed of this message because i tell you you wouldn't know what you know today without the message from jesus to revelation i'm so thankful that he sent a prophet in this day don't be ashamed you stand up you go to school wherever you're at you stand up for jesus christ i tell you what you'll bear a reproach but it's worth the worthy cause it's worth a worthy cause to stand for jesus [Music] he said that's the only way you can be saved is by faith you've got to look at the unseen and the whole armor of christianity is supernatural how amen he said how the man can say that he believes in god and preaches in a church and says he does not believe in the supernatural when the full armor of god the full armor of christianity is supernatural what is armor of christianity listen love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness patience faith holy spirit you want all the fruits of the spirit say god killing me tonight give me all of them lord empty me out end you this vessel out tonight i'll tell you i'm tired of playing around time to play at church i'm tired of not listening to mom and dad i'll tell you get in jesus tonight it will take care of all your problems you don't need a counselor tonight you need to meet with the almighty god that's the main counselor that will change from the inside and change on the outside and i'll tell you you will act different all the time that's who you got to trust he said what is love what is joy going down to the drug store and buy me so a quarter's worth of it he said i don't need it right now i need it right now sorry he said i need it right now see you can't buy love joy peace long server goodness patience uh gentleness faith you can't buy it it's supernatural and the whole armor of the christian is supernatural and we're bidding by the scriptures to put on the whole armor of god be girded up about the whole armor the queen of sheba 1960. aren't you thankful for this let's go to verse 14. there stand there for having your loins gird about with truth we had the truth it says and having on the breastplate breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace the gospel of peace brother braham says in this message he says let's just not let's just take the loins gird it about with a girdle he said that's the belt that holds the rest of it together gird your loins with truth in the day brother when there's all kinds of isms and fat fanaticism he said it's time to gird yourself with the truth hallelujah jesus said i am the truth the truth i tell you when people say what about this and what about that it's good to feel that old truth buckled around you isn't it knowing you're where you're standing then stand there let them say well you have this that and the other he said you know where you're standing had the whole armor buckled on and he says and with a gird around your ear buckle down good and tight pulled down he said and the truth of god's word anchored in your heart anchored in your heart he said all devils in hell can't upset you all devils in hell he said that's right you can meet satan say it's written hallelujah i tell you brother did you take up serpents no sir i believe jesus christ he said did you do this did you do the other no sir i received the baptism of the holy ghost he said buckled about and armored on girded with truth israel and the church so i believe we're living in a day that we have to put the whole armor of god on not just some of it but to ask god to say lord i don't want to leave here until you feel me tonight i want to leave here i'm going through fires i'm going through trials at home i'm going through this my parents don't pray my my parents say they believe a message and they don't read the bible but on sundays i'm just just being frank today but you know what that should hold you back tonight that shouldn't hold you back that you should still get in the word of god you got enough time to play on games and white what fall through social media tonight but i'm telling you if you could treat the bible like that tonight we'll be so much farther kids it's time you it's time to pick it up and say lord i tell you you need to just download it on your phone and use it as an app and let it go up and just stream through it and see that the lord is good and see that his benefits outweigh anything in this world that's our god bless verse verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation in the sword of the spirit which is in the word word of god but i love this verse 18 praying sometimes praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit praying always somebody's saying you want to just talk to god occasionally but you can pray to him always you could be in your car you'll be at home be in your school pray before you do a test whatever it is pray always and if you got someone coming against you pray for them don't kick them down just pray for them they don't dress like you hey just pray for them just be salty tonight holy oh they don't need to hear about this than that just be salty to them and let let god if you do the catching they won't last long but let jesus christ you just live a life and you just ooze god all over them use your life all over them and i'll tell you young adults young kids i'll tell you see what happens see what happens to your friends your influences and you know what's so funny the ones that don't want to hang out they feel condemned they're going away they're going to go away because they don't want to be around that influence they want to be our influence the devil's already got but i tell you stay in this atmosphere stay in this uh parents keep bringing them to this i'll tell you it blesses my heart i don't care how long if it takes you two hours or one hour 30 minutes it's worth it all right it's worth more than your paycheck it's worth more than anything to get your kids in this presence where he changes things not in my presence but his presence and i tell you you won't have no problems at home anymore because when he fills you up when he fills you up brother bram says he said that's what the not an idol but individual all-out ought to be dressed let us put the whole armor of god the helmet of salvation he said this great big shield the size of door of faith oh brother it's not what he is but what he represents that's what the officer it ain't that little man standing there he's just an ordinary man but what he represents our armor is jesus christ yes sir all devils slide their breaks he says breaks when they see that that wonderful he says all devils slide their breaks when they see that you know brother brahma also says when the weakest christian gets on his knees the devil's trembles you imagine if you pray always you're in the word of god you're filled with the holy ghost what the devil does when you get on your knees and you go by your bed silent night and you pray or wherever you're in your car wherever you're at at home i'll tell you what let your parents see that let them see you reading the word of god let them see you get in it i'll tell you it'll motivate the family real quick it'll boggle them real quick it says that's he said our armor is jesus christ yes sir all devils slide their uh slot slide their brakes when they see that when they see that the full armor of god the true baptism of the holy ghost amen he said that seated coming straight from the throne of god dressed in the full armor of his resurrection the full armor of his resurrection i believe we gotta we're living in such a late hour but everyone preaches a message out of this called the greatest battle ever fought and i believe we're in a time that is the greatest battle but i tell you we're here to overcome this battle we're on the winning side today and i tell you he talked about been jude pulling you out of the fire pulling you out of the fire you think about the hebrew children tonight and you think about when they went up to the fire nebuchadnezzar they heated it seven times hotter seven times harder tonight and here they are they said you know what i don't care i'm going anyway and you know what brother bram says he asked the three boys one of them looked at the hebrew children one of them looked at each other he said are you prayed up now he said are you prayed up now he said yeah we can go in now brother braham says this i love how he brings it out he says are you ready he said yeah i'm good now i'm prayed up because he started talking to the master and when the fires and things get rough out here talk to the master sometimes i tell you he's the master of the wind he's the master of all situations he knows it all before it starts and he can put the fire out but i like what he said i wanted to share some of you tonight he didn't imagine he didn't throw them to where they made the mistake if they would have threw them one by one think about it he said when two or three are gathered he's in the midst when he said two or three are gathered he's in the midst so where they made a mistake was is when they started throwing them as all as a group because jesus had to honor his word he had to honor his word so when they when they went to throw them in there they threw them all together so jesus had to show up and so i'm telling you it takes me he takes you he takes these young people tonight to get in jesus christ it takes all of us in the body of christ not to be fighting not to be complaining not to be murmuring not to be talking about this person and now i found this there was a cloud there wasn't a cloud look there is nothing but everything if he said it was the cloud there was a cloud if he said this or whatever the bible says you believe it tonight you believe it tonight you believe with all your heart but i'm so glad what brother brahm said about that you know what he said he said you know the three hebrew children went down there and he says they got to the furnace i love how brother brandon brings it out he says they get to the furnace and he says he heats it seven times higher the guards were dying he gets down there and all of a sudden he says the angels come to god and ask permission to go down there he asks god says gabriel all these the angels came up to him and said hey you want me to go put it out with water you see your people down there you know you know what jesus tells me he says no he said this is for me this is for me that's our god protecting you today that's our god when you go into a situation god gets off the throne says i'm going to go down there because i have to honor my word and i tell you heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not so i have to honor my word and he's here every time young ones he will honor every word if you stay in his words and stay with all your heart stay in it he will honor it and i'm so glad he does because i'll tell you i'll fail you men will fail you your parents will fail you but jesus christ i'm pointing you to one that will not fail you that will get you through every battle that gets you through every situation to get you get you through a uh a a dating relationship whatever it is that's why it's called courtship tonight i don't know why i keep going there but that's why it's called courtship it's to get to know who you're going to spend the rest of your life with it ain't it you know this thing i tell you when you start i met rachel and i'll tell you about when i met rachel i was like lord i told rachel this i said sweetheart i said you you saved your whole life i said all we'll do and that sounds crazy to you but i'm just going to tell you this is for me that's what i did i said no more than holding hands i said i will never disrespect you more than that i said because you could be someone else's [Music] i'm just being real with you tonight i said i'll just all i'm gonna do is hold your hand and the whole time we did it all i did was hold her hand if we were around to hold her hand we might hug like a sideways hug but that's it that's it that's it and i'm not bragging on who i am but i was in the world play and it will take you farther than you want to go longer than you want to stay and i tell you the devil will knock you off your feet tonight put you on a ditch and laugh at you and keep on going but i'm here to tell you jesus christ wants jesus christ will fill every one of you give you somebody that you can love and cherish all your life be a housewife to a to a wonderful family and i'll tell you you wait for that one right you wait for rachel was probably what 30 years old when i'm at 29 28 i don't know 28 when i met her and she about said i about gave up she said i about gave up i said well i'm glad you didn't because i was just praying lord lord but god i tell you god's got someone for you he's got someone special for you and i believe if you'll trust jesus christ through every fiery dart through every trial and then line them up with the word of god and you look at their husband your your wife you look at her and you go can i live with this the rest of my life can i live with this i don't know why i'm going here but i just am good i'm here to tell you i'm telling you don't don't you just line it up with the word of god and you make sure they love jesus more than they love you make sure they love jesus i'm not just saying i believe a quote or i believe this so i believe that but i tell you make sure it's on the inside make sure it's their life support i told rachel i said this is my life support i said i love it and i'll fall more in love with it every day and i said this love letter and young people make this be your love you can be on all these uh game sites and do all this i see it everywhere and we're fighting demons and all this but get your face in this book keep your life in a book keep your life in the holy word of god keep it in the holy word of god take the whole take 17 and take the helmet of salvation the sword of spirit which is the word of god as brother uh solomon comes tonight don't let this alarm you we have a fireman here tonight and i believe that we're going through fiery darts today but i want to just bring out some things about this fire suit tonight young people that want to share with you this is not just some ordinary suit you can't go through a fire without getting on a suit that's fire retardant you can't just go to a fire casually dressed up i know we like to chase fires i know we like to see when smoke is out there way out in the distance and we go running and looking for the fire don't you worry the fire is coming looking for you the devil's looking for you you don't have to chase it but i tell you he's got this fire suit on tonight and just thinking in jesus christ's terms to bring it down to your level this is fire retardant and when you get holy spirit brother brad says they can't burn the holy spirit out of you now i don't care how hard they put the fire on tonight they can't be no matter how far they can't burn the holy spirit out of you but there's a few things tonight i want to bring out in the scripture it says in verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation in the sport the sword of the spirit which is the word of god so you see he's got this helmet on tonight and you know what a fireman does when he's going through the ambers there might be a fireman tonight so you can correct me later but i got this suit from the fire department god bless them and i tell you what you think about the helmet of salvation tonight you'll need to put the helmet of salvation and look through the shield of jesus christ and everything you look through in life you look through the shield tonight and with everything you see you look to a cross in your rearview mirror and you look through jesus christ it's about what you put in your life what in your eyesight tonight what are games whatever it is how much time are you spending with jesus but when going through a fire he's got this fire suit on but the ambers won't hit him in the head the ambers things of this world won't hit you in the head and knock you out and get you down and the devil say just stay down but it burning it protects your mind and then the breastplate the breastplate of righteousness it says right here it says in verse stand there for having your loin skirt about with truth have it on the breast place of righteousness and i'm here to tell you if you look at his suit tonight if he turns around i want to bring something out tonight that really just lit me on fire that if you look at this suit if everybody can see this it stands for charlestown volunteer fire department do you see any name on here of who is in this suit do you see any name think about it when you get buried in jesus christ and when you take on his name you are representation of jesus christ hey i'm here to tell you tonight you're no longer yourself but you're identified with jesus christ you're identified with the one that wants to represent you and i love that because they have no name but the representation of who they represent and that's what young people tonight you know that everywhere you go everywhere you go they're looking at your life and they're seeing who you represent another thing about this fire suit tonight as he turns around as the reflectors on it and i started thinking about when they're going through a fire they have to see one another because they're looking for one soul or one child or one adult whatever it is and i'm the same way here tonight everywhere we travel it's just one more soul for his kingdom because he said one soul is worth 10 million worlds that's more than any money you can make and you know what that's just not for the preachers tonight that's for everybody in this church you can go out there and be a be a light in this dark world and touch a soul or touch a young one i don't care who it is tonight but you reflect jesus christ everywhere you go you reflect this message you reflect jesus christ you represent jesus christ everything's jesus christ and that's what you got to know when they're going through a fire and they're crawling through amber's are falling they want to see each other they want to see each other and his job is to save one more and another thing is if you look through his fire suit tonight if we can take it he's got suspenders on he's got suspenders on and that's what holds the the bottom suit to the top part and i'm telling you young children tonight young adults if you'll take this word of god and you let it shield your life and take the hormone of god and let it let it buckle you together from bottom to the top to your head to your heart to all of it and let it shield and let it buckle let this be your buckle let the word of god cinch it up tonight and everything you go through you give it the word test everything you go through life dating living your life whatever it is for jesus christ you line it up with jesus christ if it doesn't line up then get it out of your life but you shoot it you remember this you buckle up and then the roman soldiers would do the same thing they had their armor and they would have their bottom top part and they would cinch it up and they would switch it up and they would tighten it up and it would all put it together and you see these boots tonight but that's not regular boots they're also fire retardant when they go through fires they have special boots they have and you know what when you get filled with the holy ghost he can carry you through every situation every situation you go through every trial you go through the thing sometimes why we struggle so much is we haven't got let god release his holy spirit in us and release and fully relinquish ourself and say lord you take my life you take control you take control and there's a couple things i want to bring out tonight as he comes down here down the front i want you to see this there's two things that they said that they give the firefighters i was talking to a couple firefighters there's two things they give them before a fire they said they give them an instruction manual and they said they have to know the front and the back of that instruction manual before every fire they don't just learn the instruction manual when they're in the fire they learn it before they get there they learn the instruction manual from front to back before they get in the fire because he said he wants to see and know what he's going to be enter countering he wants to know what hammers are going to fall what support beams what people he needs what tools he needs but i'm here to tell you just don't know the book when you're in the fire know the front in the back of this book when you're going through a fire when you're not going through a fire when you're not going through a storm when you're going through a storm and i'm telling you he'll get you through everything he'll get you through you ask everyone the older adults in here me myself brother paul whoever it is i'm telling you if you anchor in jesus christ and you know this book just like he said i let him know the front to the back of the book in the middle and everything because i want him to know what he's getting into i want to know and secondly he does one more thing they even did this in the military he says he gives him a boot buddy he said he give everyone a sign another man to go through the fire he gives them a boot bunny he gives them a boot buddy to go through the fire because he don't want him alone and he says through every fire there's boot buddies all around here tonight if you look to your left you look to your right they're your brother and sister in christ and they're your boot buddy tonight they're your boot buddy tonight not your enemy they're your boot buddy tonight i'm your boot buddy tonight if you ever have anything just call us up because we're your boot buddy tonight and i want to show you something as he gets on his knees and starts crawling and he says they're going through the fire as he's crawling come here goes grab onto his boot and he says as they're going the other boot buddy starts to follow him and he says as the ambers are falling he's pressing on and he's grabbing his boot and he's saying we're going to make it we're going to make it every fire situation we're going to make it i don't care what we're going through tonight but we're going to make it we're going to see jesus christ and i'm here to tell you to keep grabbing a boot tonight and you grab a boot buddy and you get beside him tonight and you say brother i don't care it might be you might can't see anything but there's one point i'm going to and that's jesus christ and i'm telling you tonight get you a boot buddy tonight get you a boot thank you brother get you a boot buddy tonight and he says he gets him a boot buggy he gets him a boot buddy he said he gives him the instruction manual and the boot buddy where he can hold on through the fire and i'm here to tell you it's not too long tonight but i'm here to tell you to get you a boot buddy get you somebody that you can trust that you can talk to and with even jesus christ mostly but get a friend that loves the lord get somebody that you can call up and you can pick up the phone and call somebody and say hey i'm going through this trial i'm going through this situation hey i just want to be i just want to pour my heart out that you can trust and they can say hey i'm not going to criticize you i'm not going to come against you but i'm here to pray with you i'm here to pray with you and in closing i want to share this as the musicians come tonight here's brother branham's notes with the woman at the well i don't you've seen this before you probably have but brother brahms notes he's got the woman of the well and the pharisees and it's far and you see it goes up through the bible to the word and jesus the bible and the word and brother brethren
