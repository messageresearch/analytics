========================================

chapter 10 and we'll join in reading the scripture together we appreciate brother Phillips singing that song I'm going to continue with that subject today that we were on last week somebody died for me and get to a scripture a couple of references that we didn't get to last Sunday to add to the subject a little bit and I trust it will be a blessing to your you and your Christian Journey God bless you each one we welcome all that's here I think we have a few visitors so we don't want to miss anybody God bless you good to have you with us this morning Hebrews chapter 10 just been a special section of scriptures here the last couple of weeks to me and looking at over Hebrews chapter 10 and I'm just going to pull out a few things in relation to our subject of somebody died from me and I want to speak this morning on the feeling of someone dying for you the feeling of someone dying for you Hebrews chapter 10 and I'll just pull out a few places here I'll just start at verse six and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the value of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burn offerings and offering for sin thou what is not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O Lord he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away our sins but this man this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified what is this saying somebody died for us and guess who it affects it affects all of them that they be Sanctified for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified somebody died for us now I want you to notice something here towards the end of the chapter that Paul brings in here and uh it's kind of like our response or our feeling and our continuance of the value of what God has done for us and that here in verse 22 what would we do in response how should we live and the first thing he says in verse 22 says because because he's died for us let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water I'm just going to cover this while you're standing here just a minute first thing is he says knowing he's done this for us we should not draw away but we should draw near we should keep drawing near him when we have a a a value for someone who has given his life for us then we don't draw away we actually draw near so that's the first thing the second thing verse 23 is let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise so part of our value of knowing what he has done is that we not only keep drawing near but we hold fast our profession you know our profession doesn't need to be one week I'm in one week I'm out one week I'm weak one week I'm strong our profession needs to be faithful our profession of faith that we believe Jesus Christ we believe is word we believe the message that he sent our profession needs to be consistent can you say Amen verse 24 says let us consider one another so that's another part of this uh Drawing Near to God is considering one another did you know the person sitting next next to you is more than likely a part of the body of Christ and you can't be an island they're part of the body of Christ and so we it's about one another as well part of drawing near him is drawing near the body of Christ not further away let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good work stir up Good Works among one another verse 25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so what are they doing they're drawing away and even makes the emphasis here that if we're drawing closer then we're not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together it's part of it I could you know I could preach a sermon on that but there are those forsaking the assembling of themselves together for lots of reasons I won't give all those reasons but but we see that but this is part of let us draw near let us hold our profession it's part of you have a feeling for this person that has died for you that you're Drawing Near I'm not going to forsake the assembling of myself together why because that's how you draw near as the matter said but exhorting one another that's how we draw near and so much the more as you see the day approaching now this next scripture and I'm I'm gonna close my opening here in a minute this is serious scripture here for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth their remaineth no more sacrifice for sins now that's been used for years and for a lot of different agendas I don't want to try to interpret it and I don't use it to try to kick people out but it's the soberness of that scripture should make us all sober because that's what Paul wanted it's not just an animal that's died for you because that doesn't take your sins someone has died for you and we need to never lose the feeling when someone is willfully sinning and just trampling upon the blood of Jesus Christ that's a serious serious thing because they lose the feeling of It Go assemble yourself together draw near to me keep this cycle going of staying close to the Lord why because it shows you have a value that somebody died for you we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge through their remaineth no more sacrifice their sins but a certain fearful looking for the judgment and fury ignition which shall Devour the adversaries he that despise Moses law died without Mercy into under two or three Witnesses my what severe Judgment of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall ye be thought or worthy who have trodden underfoot the Son of God and have counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of Grace for we know that he has said Vengeance belong let's just skip down here to uh if you would all the way to verse 35 cast not away your confidence which has great recompense or reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and ye shall he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back now notice if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him that's God speaking I began in verse 22 if you compare let us all draw near but here's a soul who draws back in other this says in unbelievers this is somebody who knows about the finished work of redemption of and they just draw back from it they draw back their lives the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but praise the lord we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul I'm not I don't want to be in that group that draws back I want to be in that group that draws closer and draws nearer to the cross father bless your word today and we commit it to you and the word you've spoken Lord and had in your mind before the foundation of the world you gave a word even for this Sunday for me to speak for the benefit of the people of God I pray they would catch it Lord and we pray for their souls that you'd bless and prosper them in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated so we're on this theme that someone died for you last Sunday we were on it and it's an appreciation for the reality of someone I mentioned taking a bullet for you if someone took a bullet for you next to you jumped out in front of you and they took a bullet you would be very appreciative of that person dying for you you would attend the funeral you would be appreciative to the family and you'd probably probably live a very grateful life knowing that person personally stood in the stood in the Gap and jumped in front and took a bullet for you and it's like the song that's ministered to me that brother Phillips saying is that we're forever grateful and I like that lyric at the end that says every day every day is a gift to me because somebody died for me this isn't just it lasted two years and you forget what he did for you every day is a gift to me because somebody and when you keep the feeling of it when you keep the the honor of it can you say Amen when you keep that in your heart then every day is the gift because I'm the one that deserved to die but somebody else took the bullet for me and so every day is a gift so now I was reading to you an article how the generations sometimes when they're not connected with somebody who has served in the military we're getting more and more where the generations don't know somebody that served in the military they haven't served themselves and they don't know somebody personally who actually died for them if they know somebody like that especially a family member then we realize that they're more connected to that sacrifice that was made so that there's an appreciation for the freedoms that came for that sacrifice and they were saying I was reading it to you last week that about 12 percent of the total U.S population were a part of the Armed Forces during World War II and so as she goes on she says uh uh she's I'm just picking up I don't want to read the whole thing again of course um she says that the she talks with the veterans excuse me I just wanted to catch this last part in our society we've seen this real shift she said not less than one percent of our population has served the experience of going to war and coming home we don't have as much awareness we have a disconnect in our society about what's going on who has served what they've experienced and the ones that also that have died as I said a half a million people over the nation's history those have died in order to preserve our freedom and one place he says here of the military related task fewer Americans have a personal connection to someone in the armed forces or someone who died for them this is something that happens over generations and I'm I'm pulling that out fewer Americans have a direct connection or a personal connection this relates to the Gospel of Jesus Christ because every believer must have a personal connection with the one that died for them I know that's simple this morning but if you don't have that you'll lose the feeling of it you won't see what it's done for you personally you'll be like a grandchild that carries things on in the church and I'm I'm here and I go to church because my parents told me to do it but that's not what church is all about you go someone has died for you someone has sacrificed their life because of your sin and your life and so if you don't catch a revelation of that and see what God's done for you you won't have a value and appreciation to say I'm living today spiritually and naturally even but I'm living today spiritually because someone sacrificed their life for me I'd like every Christian to keep that value the rest of their lives and stay near The Cross can you say Amen so we see then that there's a Detachment when it says that you lose the Personal Touch of someone that died there's a Detachment Generations become too far removed from the reality of War for the freedoms that they have and as I mentioned last Sunday you take a mom who's lost their son to war she's going to feel that because it's personal and and she's going to feel proud that he served but she's going to hurt from the pain of losing her son it's a personal thing to her and the same thing applies even more to what the Lord has done for you this morning [Music] if the new generation has no personal connection with the blood that was shed for our country or someone who died they become listen now they become insensitive they become carnal they become violent they become destroying one another and destroying things in our country of True Value isn't that happening right now to this generation they don't care anymore they have no sensitivity to hold up our freedoms they actually mock it their carnal they're violent people they'll destroy one another and they'll kill they'll turn their guns towards the innocent nobody would ever do that number one if they had God in their life but if they had an appreciation for human life and that God saved us and gave us a free country because people died for their lives to be able to enjoy this Freedom now in our own country now we have guns turned towards one another violence comes uh carnality comes destroying one another why are you elaborating on that brother Paul because I'll tell you why when someone begins to lose their feeling for what God has done for them they'll do the same things within the Christian church they'll turn their guns towards one another they'll turn their hatred towards one another and lose their appreciation for the body of Christ why because you take your freedoms for granted and humility is lost it's Pride it's humility when a person loses a real touch with our dying lamb they also become carnal and as brother Matt Watkins was saying the scripture the carnal mind is an enemy against God and he says we all have a carnal mind I was just amazed to think that is that we as Christians we have we have the Holy Spirit or we should have the Holy Spirit we have the Holy Spirit but we still have a carnal mind and that carnal mind left to itself is a continual enemy against God if you don't live by the spirit and the feeling of what Calvary has done for you on a daily basis you will let this carnal mind turn as an enemy against the people of God and against God himself because that's what the carnival it's an enemy against God and and you know the thing is is that this new generation and just that if if you look at a child like my grandchild here this morning uh you know and if you have a child you learn that they they don't have the maturity yet but they they they don't have a regard for precious things uh and they're not connected not connected to things that are of value that you have paid for they don't have a value for it and even teenagers for that matter I mean somebody pays for that light bill and they won't turn their lights off they have no idea of the sacrifice that's made somebody else I feel like tell them somebody died for you somebody paid the light bill for you just use your sermon and they don't have a value of the sacrifices made can you say Amen a lot of ministers have made sacrifices to their lives for countless years in prayer when they could have been off Saturday doing some enjoyable thing they're in study all day and fasting and prayer for your lives if people don't have a value of it I think we should appreciate the fifo ministry and the you may not like them personally but the sacrifices that are made is because of where you're at today amen the children you know it's like yesterday she come over while I was studying and uh Ryan brought over you know and so Ellie you know you have to watch over because she you know I've got a nice piano the Lord's blessing bless me with lately nice baby grand piano and uh then Ellie has Ellie are you listening she has a little baby grand piano that's a toy grand piano and she plays that and I get on mine and she gets on that and we get to going and she but the problem is I only paid about 50 bucks for hers and she doesn't know what I've paid for this one and she wants to get on and bang that one like her toy and it's not a toy but she doesn't know that just just going on and hit it and then she's got a stick in her hand and you're going oh she just could scratch that and it's not their fault they just don't have a value of the bill that's coming in for that piano still I'm still trying to pay it off and you know they don't have a feeling for it and who who paid you wish you could tell three-year-old do you know how much I paid for that thing stay away from that so we go outside and we get something else if they want to throw sticks out there Ellie you can throw all the sticks you want to outside okay we get them distracted we get them away from the valuable things and then you get you you turn on baby shark for an hour I'm only saying that because it's still ringing in my ears I had to do everything to work on studying last night because all night long baby get that out of my mind but you do what you got to do you got to do things because they don't see the value and so this is a reflection of the immaturity of a generation of people who are not connected with the sacrifices that have been made this applies more to Christianity and the gospel legit and applies to this message movement as well I can tell you someone can have all of the Seven Seals and all the books of the prophet and all these other things but when you lose a feeling for the people of God for what God has done for you and keep a humility about yourself then you become carnal and you lose the value of things and that's why your tongue slips and you gossip and you give yourself permission to do this and divide and do everything else because why you've lost something and then people draw away he said draw near you draw away I don't need anybody you draw away no no we're supposed to draw near to him and draw near to one another can I get a few amens that's what your Bible says that's what the Bible says so now I want to bring in something before I read a quote and I won't be long today but I just want to finish up what we got started last week but you see now there's in the Old Testament there's seven feasts that the people celebrated and they came three times a year to celebrate in these feasts there was seven of these feasts and they all represented something in a shadow they all represented the Christ coming Christ was the Fulfillment of all seven feasts let's see if I can remember a feast of Passover feast of unleavened bread Feast of first fruits uh Feast of Pentecost Feast of uh Tabernacles uh somebody have a feast of atonement uh and there's another piece of trumpets trumpets atoma Tabernacles and so there's seven of them and that's just types and shadows and the people went three times a year and they worshiped and they were they were supposed to be at these feasts they were coming Worship in Jerusalem at all three times a year bring their families and then you're supposed to be there you're supposed to show up and they would bring sacrifices and they would do this and this is how they worship so now bringing it to the New Testament Jesus is in in Jesus in his bodily form is a fulfillment spiritually of all seven feasts how many know that Jesus is the Passover Lamb so he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of Passover and given a little teaching here it's preaching preaching and teaching together pass over lamb what's the next one Feast of unleavened bread how many know that Jesus is the unleavened bread no sin leaven means sin there's no sin in him so he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of unleavened bread all right the Feast of first fruits which is the resurrection he is the Fulfillment he's the one that come up the third day so he's the Fulfillment he not only went and it's an interesting thing about Jesus is when he was here on Earth he was attending these feasts and while he was there at the temple attending these natural feasts he was the Fulfillment and they didn't realize that he's not only just a tradition of going to the feast he is the Fulfillment of the feast to say that this morning I don't want to just come to church I don't want to just come because it's a duty but I want to be the Fulfillment of why we come to church I want to see Christ lived out in these things so now the last four the last four Feasts I want you to catch this they're fulfilled also by Christ but not in the body of Christ in the sense of his body two thousand years ago the last four are still Christ but he fulfills them through the body of the Bride so number four is the Feast of Pentecost who was it that was in the upper room while this Feast was being fulfilled it was 120 believers so it was Jesus in them can you say Amen not in his body that came to Jesus of Nazareth but now it's in the body of people that he has actually fulfilling during the time of the Feast of Pentecost while there in the temple in an upper room God is fulfilling that reality that's why I say these things have to be a reality to you church has to be a reality it's not about coming and seeing friends and showing off what we wear no it has to be a personal connection when you and the Christ of this message can you say Amen you have to be connected to him because this is a reality this isn't a ritual this is a thing that we go through in time in our clock to say I got to give about a two hours to go to church with my family then I got lots more to do shame on us we we got to come for deeper reasons for that and so now we see that number four I got to finish with this because this is not my subject but I want you to just catch one thing out of it number four is the Feast of Pentecost it was fulfilled then we have a long period of time in the seven feasts the last three from the fourth one there's a longer period of time interestingly in the Old Testament from the fourth all the way to the last three which is perfect because when you come from the day of Pentecost two thousand years of church history when you get to the end time is the Fulfillment of the last three feasts still through the bride but you're going to have the Feast of trumpets you're going to have the Feast of atonement and then you're going to have the Feast of Tabernacles all to be fulfilled at the end time so if you live in the end time which you do then you realize wow where am I living I'm living in the Fulfillment of these three I need I need Lord help me to catch this we're not just going to church here we're fulfilling the word here can you say Amen you're actually fulfilling the word when the Bible says not forsaking The Sibling of yourself together Hey listen you're fulfilling the word when you come through these doors it isn't just church hey I'm walking in the word when I come praise be to God and listen again on the internet as far as because you're hungry you want to hear the word of God and I think that's a wonderful thing so now we we see then that the the lamb and in the last three feasts then let's let's hone in on the Feast of atonement all right the lamb was killed under the Feast of Passover he fulfilled that in his body the and they said now the Jews will experience these feasts as well spiritually they will experience these feasts because they have in the Feast of the trumpets the prophet dreams about brings out that it's a drawing and Gathering his people well when he had Hitler and all these men that that persecuted the Jews it was spiritually being used to drive it was part of the trumpets driving the Jews back into their Homeland that's why we look at our trials not as curses can you say man but it's getting us to where we need to be can he say Amen even Hitler and I don't endorse Hitler here today he was an evil evil man but God in his big plan used it to get the Jews back into their Homeland a lot of deaths a lot of sacrifices for that to get the people in the Homeland you see but it's the Feast of trumpets and so we're under spiritually these pieces of trumpet because where's the scripture for us wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together there's a trumpet that's called you here I've heard a spiritual trumpet the voice of God that's called me here we got some new ones you think a fat preacher is drawing you here no God's calling you here God's drawing God's Gathering you together it better be God I reminded somebody of children this morning we don't go to church for people we go to church because we're hungry for the word of God and that's it that's it are you hungry and you need to ask yourself that question am I coming because I'm hungry for the word and if you're not that's a serious question to ask yourself because you're coming for other reasons you need to come because you're hungry for the word of God that's why I come I also enjoy the fellowship this is my family I was with a few of you on Monday for Memorial Day I love it the sincerity lack of guile just the purity of people I love the fellowship I love being around there's no there's no clouds or something that's just pure fellowship and enjoying one another we don't always talk about the word sometimes it's just about funny stuff or whatever life but there's there's not this well pins and needles you have to walk on and this is my family I love it I love to be in the house of Lord with my family and be with my family it's just the way I look at it amen so now they gathered where's whatever the carcasses so now when you come to this Feast of atonement this is an important one must be so important because I'm spending a lot more time on it than what I wanted to so the Jews will experience this Feast of atonement and when they do someday the Bible says that they were mourned for days they'll go into repentance because it's not that they're that their Messiah is coming they're looking for their it's not they realize that their Messiah has already come and the lamb for their sins has already died so Jesus won't have to come again and go to the Cross he's already done that so I want to make this one the Feast of atonement is not another killing of the Lamb he's already died for you so what's the Feast of atoma because we know that Calvary and when he did 2000 years ago gave us our atonement for our sins what is the feast of atonement is it another killing no the Jews will come back in Repentance and realize that he's already come and die for them they didn't know it and when they recognize it they will mourn and repent for days feeling feeling that they crucified the one that they were looking for remember the Jews didn't reject the Messiah they rejected the way that he come wow they were they were singing about the Messiah they were prophesied he's coming he's coming then he came and they didn't know him because he didn't come the way that they thought could it be everybody listening on the broadcaster that could it be Christ could come again people are not rejecting Christ but they're rejecting the way that he comes they did it before history repeats itself the Jews never rejected the Messiah they rejected the way the Messiah came very very deep point to think about but now they realize they've killed their Messiah and after two thousand years of Christianity this happens to us too because we get away from what Calvary did we get away from the true atonement we get away from the True Fellowship of it religion and tradition for two thousand years takes the place of the reality of God we get away from the feeling of the atonement we get away from the power of the atonement it becomes a tradition it's not personal so that's why we need a Revival and a revelation of what the atonement really was what did he really do for me at Calvary this power needs to come into my life the power the feeling the sensitivity the the the all that's come from Calvary because the church lost it it's a powerless religion God hates a powerless religion God hates a religion that has no power has no Supernatural in it has no God in it can you say amen and specifically not so much for miracles but he hates the fact that religion replaces the power of the spirit to change a life and transform their desires that they have no more conscience of sin That's The Power of somebody dying for you that it so Burns sin out of your soul that you no longer have a conscience of sin that's how powerful this is I know you got your mind that tries to think about it but in the desires Calvary so it's not just saying I shook the preacher's hand and I believe Christ died for my sins mechanically intellectually they don't have the feeling of it you'll baptize uh dry Sinners and bring up wet centers if they don't have a reality of what God has done for them there's a power in this atonement there's a fellowship of it there's a feeling of it can you say amen and over time it becomes impersonal I just want to pull up this first quote it's just a few sentences it's always been a powerful quote to me the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to so go to the first line the seventh Angel's message and by the way here we we quote a lot from the seventh messenger there were seven Messengers Seven Stars in his right hand in the Book of Revelations and so we because we live in the seventh age then we would be looking for if we're in the seventh age the seventh uh star in his right hand the seventh messenger Earthly messenger we live under that now because we live in the seventh age so we quote a lot from him we quote a lot from that so just to explain that but this is what that seventh Angels message is supposed to do the seventh Angels message under the same chapter everything is to call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the Gen genuine atonement the word there's a lot in that statement what happened did something wrong thank you appreciate it God bless you assistants have to do everything I'll tell you seventh angel message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal it's called The Bride you want to know what the purpose of the last day's message is to call us out of Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement of the word there's a lot in this let me say first of all if we had to be called back after 2000 years back to the atonement that means we lost the meaning of the atonement and there's thousands of churches getting up and singing about the cross this morning but some of them have lost the meaning and the power of what the atonement purchased for us what the atonement is people say I believe Christ died for my sins but there's no power in the atonement they don't know what it did for them they don't know the apost they don't have a clue and I think that's a a tragedy to mislead people as long as you just confess with your mouth he died for my sins you're saved I think that's a tragedy that life has to be transformed and chased that Soul has to be converted there has to be a new birth Jesus said it himself you must be born again by the power of the Cross not a head knowledge of the cross that means your life has changed that means your desires are changed that means you come to an altar in your seat whatever it is is that I accept what God has done somebody died for me and now I want to live for him that's an experience with God that tears the world out and like Sherry's song says it's true I can do whatever I want I can do whatever I want but my wants have been changed that's the work of the Lord I can do whatever I want today I can leave this service and go to the bar and go do whatever I want but I don't want to go to the bar I don't want to look at the things of the world Calvary took care of that I don't have a desire for those things so we must have lost the genuine atonement over 2000 years history and guess what the seventh Angel's message is to call us out of did anybody notice out of Pentecostal traditions now if you didn't know there's Pentecostal Traditions you should know it by this quote there are Pentecostal Traditions now the original Pentecost on the in the upper room that's the experience we want can you say man that the reality of it but Azusa Street was a fulfillment only of the gifts of the church California Azusa Street that was a work of the Lord to restore the gifts only to restore the gifts not the full word it was only a work of reformation it was part of the work of God and that's why the gifts were restored but but out of I don't know why I'm taking so long on this out of Azusa Street after just a few years we developed Pentecostal Traditions now why did that happen because every time God does a work of a work of the lord the devil jumps into that work and misleads the people from the real experience of Luther's day Wesley we heard it Wednesday night with brother rap at where I loved how he said how he worded his study I love being here with him I was so enjoyable I love the word I love sitting and being taught the word of God I love it brother Ralph I I was sitting there and I thought of the Glorious Reformation with a question mark was it So Glorious because the in the church age book and also in the in the Book of Revelations they didn't peg him So Glorious in that day and yet it was Luther day it was the start of the Reformation it was a great day right well some of the men took Luther's message begin to twist it up it become a denomination now every age does that including Pentecost so now we have Pentecostal traditions that we're calling many churches are calling it what happened in the upper room but how do you know that be careful you don't take an Azusa Street tradition or something that come from Isuzu Street and attach it and say we need to see this one Minister said we the young people need to see people doing this well listen now let's make sure that that's the original work of God changing a young person's life instead of pressuring them or bringing an atmosphere that you better do this or you don't really have the Holy Ghost is it okay to say that I'm very concerned because this message was not to take us back to Pentecostal traditions is to take us further not backwards there's no rapturing faith back in Azusa Street there's no rapturing faith back in the Traditions that came from Azusa Street actually the prophet said it was a different word that fell in the day of Pentecost and even today that was a different word they had a word they grabbed a hold of for that day and the Holy Ghost fell because the Holy Ghost was always tied for the word of your age they had a different word even for in the upper room that they got a hold of today is a different message a different word that's come and it's not to take us back to Pentecostal traditions so God may you help us Lord to separate original true dying out Pentecost repentance change of lives can you say Amen the supernatural all that was in the book of Acts bring it all back but Lord help us not to develop Pentecostal traditions because the message has come to call us out of them it's also called us out of world Traditions as well this is what the message in the last days was sent to do and so because you have Lutheran traditions in a western tradition you have Pentecostal traditions because when they leave the word and denominate then they get traditions because the devil always has to give somebody else something to do as a tradition to think that they're still in Christ instead of following the word for every age you can't denominate the word of God in the last days but people can certainly have denominational spirits that make movements within our ranks to make this camp in that camp in this camp and separate yeah it's happening it's happening because wherever God's working the devil is working can I get an amen and that's why when the devil fights us so hard here I said well praise the Lord God must be doing something I must be doing something right because the devil's fighting like crazy if you got in your life and the devil's fighting you then you ought to just look at the right way and say I must be doing something right because the devil don't like me wherever God is that's where the devil is wherever he's doing a work of God which is the message of this age he's right there he's got everybody else he wants to take this and make it a tradition because of what you wear you're okay and gonna make a Rapture I'm here to tell you it's not because of what you wear that gets you in a rapture we do that out of appreciation for God because he asks for the women to rest dress different and the men to dress different thank God the prophet said things and reminded us of the Bible about it because of this trans world we live in thank God the prophet reminded us of the word of God but we don't do that to gain Heaven sisters no it's not a dress code that we make it in a Rapture it's because the Holy Ghost is living on the inside and we're filled with the spirit you see how you can take the message and make it a tradition I'd say after 40 50 years whatever it's been now I'd say the devil's working to try to do that young people sitting around without the new birth older people raised up in the message and they don't have the new birth yet so I get all confused you know and you wonder what was their start in this because it just I'm questioning everything now I don't know I'm teeter-tottering well you better look at your whole experience because something that anchors down here it's sealed into the day of redemption and when those thoughts have come doubting this message to me which they do come they're quickly dismissed because the soul dismisses them wow I'm taking a lot of time the Feast of atonement I want to draw three elements out of it it's okay I got next Sunday to finish this and the next and the next praise the Lord God is good amen out of Pentecostal and World traditions I am so excited about what that says I'm excited about the word I'm so glad this is getting me off of baby shark doo doo doo doo baby this is wonderful that's what the message was said to do bring us out of Pentecostal and World Traditions two the genuine atonement the words so it's a feast to bring us back to the meaning and the power of what the atonement did for us what the atonement is so I draw three elements out of it if you want to read them in Leviticus 23 in Leviticus 23 you find all the the feasts there at the very if you read the atonement one you're going to find three elements out of the Feast of atonement repenting um they they were in I forget the word that's used or you can read it in Leviticus 23. their souls were smitten their souls were spitting they were repenting so it's repenting it's resting and it's rejoicing you'll find those three things in the Feast of atonement repenting because they realize what the atonement has done for them the Jews will repent because they killed their Messiah okay but the bride repents because you know be zealous therefore and repent Revelations 3 says if you're in the lateral cnh the you want to have Zeal how many want to have zeal brother Brian says in later see it Zeal is to repent and say we're wrong and he's right we're wrong I've been studying why people won't admit they're wrong so that's another sermon but the Zeal of this age is to say I'm wrong he's right I'm wrong people can't say they're wrong so repenting resting which means the Sabbath honor the Sabbath that's rest and this rejoicing so we will come we we will talk about afflict ourselves that's the word they Afflicted their souls in there in this time don't do any work and celebrate so the first thing that is mentioned is deflict our souls Souls that come this this this refers not to the inner man but to the body and actually the whole flesh of man then uh to afflict the souls in Hebrew uh it means to fast most Jews still do this on the day atonement Yom Kippur uh July 10th uh Kipper and kafir is Hebrew for atonement means cover to purge to reconcile atonement means reconcile today it means that one minute Oneness at one minute atonement at one minute making us in God one being in harmony with someone but it's deeper it's a humbling ourself it's a remorse it's a deep regret when it refers to afflicting your souls it's a deep regret for the wrongs committed the Jews will acknowledge that he was the source for their cleansing of their sin and they killed the source for the cleansing of the sin and I have rejected that source and I want to repent it's one thing to reject the Messiah it's another thing to realize that he was the true atonement for sin and the only way to being reconciled back to God when a person really sees this for the reality of what it is there's a Mourning in their heart a Brokenness a deep regret a real genuine repentance I would say if we're under the spiritual Feast of atonement it starts with true genuine repentance and Brokenness in our heart God forgive me let your blood cleanse me you should never lose true repentance I'd rather see a Revival when there's true sobereness and repentance than any healing Revival and I mean that respectfully but if you get all the healings God performing those things and no true repentance no Brokenness of the heart The Pride isn't broken then you haven't really had a Revival can I get an amen but when a person sees the reality that Brokenness comes a deep regret a real genuine repentance that that which is coming from a revelation it's not a dry-eyed I'm sorry it's a repentance repentance is not just words but a broken and a humble heart admitting that they have done wrong also repentance has fruits of change to it I may know that repentance as fruits of change Scholars have a tough time seeing this part because afflict your souls don't seem to go with rest in the Sabbath when we rest and afflict your souls that don't seem to go together and rejoicing in this those don't but you see I don't believe this morning under the Feast of atonement I don't believe this morning or this remorse listen now is to carry cause you to carry guilt the rest of your life that doesn't match Romans where Paul says in Romans in a Justified State he says there's there's therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus so this morning or this Affliction under this Feast of atonement can't mean that you carry guilt the rest of your life for sin no there's no condemnation in Christ Jesus but I believe this morning and this this jolting this reality is that what God is somebody's died for me and it keeps it in our life didn't Paul say I Die daily because he's living a life that every day I live because he died for me and so now I want to die out to myself because I want to do that I don't want to do it yearly at Camp I don't want to do it every five years Paul said I Die daily give us this day our daily bread blessed be God that daily loaded us up with his benefits it's a daily thing serving the lord can I get an amen this is not every year at camp this is a daily thing this is not every Sunday in church this is a daily dying out to yourself I don't believe it's a condemnation under this Affliction of souls I believe it's a morning and it's a sensitivity to what our atonement has done I don't believe this morning where most is carry guilt sad faces the rest of your life sad faces on Christians until the Rapture we're just gonna barely make it in oh we're just so woe as me and this is the bride we're just gonna just barely large grab my hand please and pull me out of this that's sad that's really sad that's not the bride oh I just grabbed my hand I can't take this and just jerk me up in the rapture no there's a rapturing faith in the word of God and it keeps growing can you say Amen it says I'm ready to go humming's been saying that I'm ready to go I'm ready to go now keep building my faith I'm ready to go jump into that other dementia not drag me it's not when the saints come dragging you it's when the saints come marching in excited praise the Lord I'm having a good time today praise the Lord having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have so now not sad faces beat yourself up and do Penance the rest of your life for things you have done can't be that there's no condemnation but in this Affliction of souls as part of the atonement is true repentance and I believe a constant sober reverence and gratefulness for his grace see they've messed up Grace in the church world today they've messed it up to me Grace is bigger than just saying uh he forgave me of my sins Grace is when he keeps me from sin can you say Amen there's a soberness in humility maintained always in the heart of the believer for wrongs they've done for rejecting but not guilt all sin all guilt of sin all desire sin all condemnation is washed away with the believer and there's a Zeal to repent all the time why lest I should disrespect all that God has done for me by my pride it's an Affliction of yourself if you want to write down Zechariah 13 is when the Jews return and when they begin to recognize in their feast of atonement what they've done for days they'll go from house to house mourning and repenting Zechariah 13. if it has that effect on the Jews then what should this spiritual Feast have an effect on us I don't arrogantly say I'm in the message and I know all the quotes and I'm good because I went and did something nice to somebody this week all that's washed away I stand humbly grateful for the cross of Jesus Christ I need his atonement I need it for my sins and I need it every day to live but it's coming back to the fullness of what he died for you for your life and victory repenting resting and rejoicing is the Feast of atonement repenting resting what's the rest mean okay what's the rest mean what's the Sabbath mean it means arrest in other words you're not laboring to try to gain your way into heaven you're resting in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is arrest you're resting in a finished work of Calvary so there's no labor in it but then he says celebrate he said rejoice in the day of atonement this is a celebration that's why when he took the book in Revelations 5 when he took of the book all creation heard John shouting hurt me he's seen his name there can you say amen he looked at those 12 elders and he's seen he was one of those 12 elders and he said I'm there I'm around the Throne of God I'm one of them he started to shout he said everything down in the Earth above everything in the sea heard him shouting he was saying amen a lot louder than you are this morning because he's excited this is a time of rejoicing when you know what the atonement has done for you you don't mind lifting your hands you don't mind shouting a little bit you don't mind being expressive this isn't a dead religion can you say Amen notice the connection to the real Quirk of Christ and I realize the time now so I'm I'm being mindful notice the connection to the real work of Christ what he did the feeling for it just like it happens for Generations who don't appreciate the lives given for a free country it's magnified and peace of people losing the feeling and sincerity for Christ the message the lamb that not only went to Calvary but broke the seals off 2000 years later for us there's a lack of feeling sometimes and sincerity for the work of Christ for our lives and so the prophet brings out this feeling of sacrifice even in the Old Testament something bled and died and he would go back even up to 1965 and refer to the way that the people brought the bulls and goats and I'm going to read it so he can that it can be said the way he said it but he says it's true with the Old Testament and it's true also with the New Testament our sacrifice that our Lord made can never become so detached from us from the feeling of it it can never become common to us I fear in the message sometimes we've complicated things way too much and several messages the prophet drops in this hint of the concern for losing the feeling of this death one place these Praises oh dear dying lamb dear dying lamb what a term to use dying loud because he said the word bleeds for you that's why it's a Perpetual benefit coming through the word as he's washing Us by the bleeding word that's come to us can you say Amen what floated Calvary is still flowing to his people through the bleeding word something that's alive something that's bleeding it's dying but it's something that's alive the word is alive today and if you'll receive it it's bleeding for you it bled for you two thousand years ago but the benefits of the blood can come to you this morning I fear in the message we have complicated things so much and he lays this in he has the concern this becomes powerless because God hates a powerless religion we complicate things we narrow things down to just teaching and and dazzling everyone so many things can be said but I don't want to be negative but dazzling everyone with how much revelation we know and how much the message has brought us and how deep the preacher can be and it becomes about everything else and about the pride of it and the guile what's in the people sometimes the Simplicity is lost the sincerity is lost can you say amen and it becomes just a dress code but it must be something real the Christ of this message must be real to you every day and not live in some fictitious world we're called to live in God's world God's reality can you say Amen I'm preaching sometimes and there are people look at me like I'm from a different planet well I am from a different planet I'm not called to hear this world is not my home can you say Amen they even said Men Are from Mars and women from Venus and all that different planets trying to explain the differences in men and women I don't know about all that but I know I'm I'm not from Earth and by the way I was in Long Island last week two weeks ago and uh I got weight on a scale we went to the aviation museum there it's a nice place I got weighed on a lunar scale brother Stephen and all I could say is I'm going if you ask me I'm going with my lunar weight 50 pounds and I don't have to tell you I just it's looter wait unless you ask that's it I loved it what a skill honey on the moon I weigh 50 pounds all right let's get in this quote and then we'll close so in the old days when God accepted this substitute how the Jew used to come down the road with his slick Bullock and he'd say you know I'm a sinner Jehovah requires me to offer blood so he goes and gets his lamb or his bollock he takes it down to the high priest down to the temple and he lays his hands upon his sacrifice what does that do that identifies the worshiper with his sacrifice this is not a detached thing this is not something we're not connected to he does it for us he dies for us but we're not disconnected from it not got some distant Christianity God is watching us from a distant Bette Midler God is watching us God is watching us number one song here I'm aging myself here God is watching us I'm a distance and it's so warm and to have a god that's just watching and if we get into trouble he'll step in for us that's the god that they want just watch us from a distance we don't want you in our home we don't want you in our soul we don't want you in our everyday life we like you from a distance that's religion that's idolatry because the idolater has no connection with the god he's worshiping he can't connect with that with that Scott you can connect with and become one with [Applause] and he lays his hand upon the second what does he do that that identifies the worshiper with his sacrifice and the priest comes and kills the boa and catches the blood and sprinkles it upon and this worshiper sincerely knowing this Jew that that's what Jehovah required of him the man went home with a good feeling feeling the quiver and shaking of that lamb I'm not so sure here but other places it refers to the priest laying his hands on it maybe the worshiper laying his hands on I'm not so sure about that but he still feels it the man went home with a good feeling feeling the quiver and shaking of that land the blood spraying all over his hands and so forth and see that little fella kicking and dying as his throat was cut it's not some distant relationship he sees what's happening that that something is dying for him he feels that he's connected with it can you say amen that's in the Old Testament look what happens now and he knowed he ought to be that one he looked at his sacrifice he thought he knowed he should be that one dying he looked at his sacrifice he identified himself by laying his hand upon it I should be that one and then when they cut its throat it's dying and bleeding and going on and the little fellow quiver and quieting down and the worshipers stand there and say oh Jehovah you've accepted that instead of me I'm ashamed of myself and the man went home Justified because he had done exactly what Jehovah required that was fine but by and by it became a family tradition now he takes this sacrifice say well let's see now oh yes it's getting to be a new moon Feast I guess I better it's a cleanse in the Tabernacle it's a feast of Pentecost they tended three times a year and they used to do it with excitement they used to do it with fervor he used to come to church with a smile on their face now it's become a tradition they don't come with a smile anymore they come because it's a duty a clock in my time losing the sincerity losing the feeling the passion of it by might became a family Tradition now he takes a sacrifice say well let's see oh it's getting to be new moon Feast I guess I better it's a cleanse in the Tabernacle it's a feast of Pentecost I guess I better go down and offer me a lamb go on down there and kill it with no feelings at all but go on back with the same idea he had coming in there and then what did he do Jehovah said here in Isaiah speaking a little later on he said your solemn feast are become a stink in my nose now before Calvary God had to accept that is the as the sacrifice for their sin but after a while why didn't he accept it like we read in Hebrews 10 he says the sacrifices now because the Covenant had changed but even back then it's become a stink in my nostrils it's become a stink to me in Isaiah 66 it says the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my footstool where is the place you will build me God said to this man will I look to him that it's poor humble and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at my word that's what I'm looking for and then he goes into the sacrifices your sacrifices become a stench in my nostrils it's as if you offered swine's blood it has no meaning it has no feeling to it if you really want to know what I'm looking for in all this I'm looking for humility I'm looking for a Brokenness and keep a Brokenness about what you're doing when you lose that you lose a lot we must come not like a bunch of rickies and rickettas we must come not like a bunch of formal and so forth that they have today of these traditional religions we have Pentecostals let's come with a deep sincerity lay our hands upon the sacrifice Yonder at Calvary and feel the bleeding and suffering of Jesus Christ as we identify ourselves that we are dead to the things of the world and this modern ideas of the day were as Sodom and Gomorrah and were living there this is 1963. here we are in 2028 I would you say we're in Sodom and Gomorrah yeah whereas Sodom and gomor and we're living in that let the righteous spirit in US these sins Vex are so daily let the sins of this world and the Fashions of Hollywood and all this Hollywood evangelism and nonsense all this makeup and beat the music and jump up and down the Music Stops down you go when a man is washed in the blood of the Lamb he don't need music or nothing else the power of God just works upon him and he can Shout Scream praise God and do anything else whether there's music or not the Holy Ghost is in him and he's identified with Jesus Christ but today we just want to we have to jump around a little bit as Pentecostals because our fourth fathers did it it's the only reason they're doing it says their forefathers did it become a tradition there's no connection with what the blood has done for you I tell you that's when somebody's really shouting and dancing you'll enjoy that's when it's real the blood has struck somebody and they realize the revelation of what God did for me and I thought it was supposed to be when that Revelation come then the after effect is stimulation of Revelation we don't push the stimulation first we just preach Revelation and let the stimulation worry about itself and if I see somebody sit and weep and cry and Brokenness that's fine with you somebody's going to shout you're gonna it's not going to scare me dance all over whatever but it's a reaction it's a reaction to True Revelation Brokenness in your heart true Revelation that's what we do we don't promote the stimulation first we don't hand out the wine first it's the wine and the oil it's the true Holy Spirit You Preach Revelation just preach the word Brothers if you're listening pastors Brothers young ministers just preach this message in power and let the stimulation take care of itself don't legislate it don't work it up just preach this message let God do the work they had something to jump around about then this Holy Spirit making them jump and when they come back now down always live as high as you jump if you don't don't jump at all we come down today we come down today and live all kinds of lives we come down from jumping and shouting and live all kinds of life no no something's not right we bring a reflection upon the very thing that we're standing for okay this is okay okay yeah I didn't expect to do this one but this is what when you've been pardoned this isn't just okay I accept the pardon the Lord's pardon me of my sin you're released from guilt is what you wish to place this on apart from God as a release from guilt not the Turning Away by psychological doctrine of some sort that might in some way give you a little feeling that you've done what's right by joining Church taking up a Creed but it's a release from your guilt by the power of Calvary something has released you there's no more guilt there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now a man when he's released from sin a man or a woman there's no more desire in their heart to walk after the things of the world he is freely pardoned and becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus and his affections are set on the things that are above where Christ sets at the right hand of God he's freely released pardon isn't just saying I accept the pardon it's a release from guilt it's a release from sin it's a power to live can you say Amen praise be to God and I'm early today it's only twenty to one I'll go ahead and take the next one but it pleased God to Smite him and he was smitten stricken Afflicted he bore our transgressions was bruised for our iniquities and by his stripes we are healed we were healed oh it should be attractive to people no I think it's a Believer who recognizes that that's attractive to them that's not attractive to the world smitten stricken Afflicted he bore our transgressions but it should be attracted is that attractive to you today are you looking for some Modern Church they're just pat patty on the shoulder and say you're doing pretty good there's plenty of them out there plenty of them out there but if this is attractive to you coming through the bleeding word being preached it's what our Lord has done for us it should be attractive to be what really should it should stir the heart but you know what's the matter we've took out the Wednesday night prayer meeting and put in a television program that keeps all the people in her team and where the heart is the treasure is there's your heart also and what makes people want to go to the things of the world you know the reason you do that the reason people does that What Makes a Man want to get drunk what makes people want to act the way they do the world what would a person stay home on Wednesday night from a prayer meeting to watch a certain television program what would they do that for is because there's something in them that desires to be satisfied they want there's a little place in a man's heart or woman's heart and God made that place for himself and dare you try to take the things of the world and put it in there where God made for himself to set there God is our joy God is our pleasure God is our satisfaction oh Lord Jesus let me let you know this morning I may not be perfect but through the blood I am and that's my desire right there that he's my satisfaction he's my pleasure I don't care what's being said on social media he is my pleasure he's my satisfaction that's where it belongs in here let God in and then the other things are so dead you don't even care about nothing about them no more praise the Lord I think those said it well amen Senator let's Stand Together God bless you friends we have a sacrifice and a pardon that has been done for us

personally would become real to you and if you haven't seen it to turn back your life over to the Lord yet I encourage you that today if you feel that in your heart you should come to an altar and talk to God you should give your life to him I wouldn't wait any longer I would talk to God and bring it to him this morning God valued so so you so much that he value more important even than his own blood because he gave his blood that he might save you amen let's remember that Heavenly Father we just come to the close of this service Lord and we just are feeling sobered by your Holy Spirit once again reminded Lord of sacrifice that was made for us we know we do it the communion service the Lord's supper and you actually ask us to remember your death never want us to forget it but Lord it seems these last two Sundays you just brought this to us Lord to remind us that we should never lose the feeling never go so far as to trample upon the blood of Jesus Christ and get so insensitive Lord there will remaineth no more sacrifice for sin as someone willfully tramples upon it oh God help us never to do that Lord help us Lord to live every day in appreciation and gratefulness in the power of what you've given us Lord didn't even deserve it but you gave us this gift of salvation of eternal life of the Holy Spirit we are so grateful for it this morning it causes us to want to live closer to you and as Paul said there in Hebrews that a man that draws back you have no pleasure in that it it can it makes you grieved the Lord let us draw near with a pure heart let us draw closer let us not forsake the assembling ourselves together let's provoke one another to Good Works let's hold the convection confession of our faith let's draw closer to you that's what our desire is Lord because of what you've done for us move on every heart Lord in this presence make it real to us father commit the people and this word to you for each heart in Jesus precious name we ask him amen amen
