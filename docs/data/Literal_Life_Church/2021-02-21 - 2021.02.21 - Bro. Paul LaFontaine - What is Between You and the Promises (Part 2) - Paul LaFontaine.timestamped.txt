[0:12] i want to read in ii
[0:14] peter and then in second corinthians
[0:17] chapter 7 and verse 1 as well
[0:20] and we're talking about what is between
[0:23] you
[0:24] and the promises so let's just read
[0:27] first of all in second peter speaks of
[0:28] the promise in second
[0:30] peter chapter 1 and verse
[0:33] 3 and 4 according
[0:36] as he as his divine power hath given
[0:40] unto us
[0:41] all things that pertain unto life and
[0:43] godliness
[0:44] through the knowledge of him that hath
[0:46] called us to glory and virtue
[0:49] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[0:52] great
[0:53] and precious promises that by these ye
[0:56] might be the partakers of the divine
[0:58] nature
[0:59] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:02] the world
[1:03] through lust so it's through the
[1:05] precious promises of god
[1:07] and that's why it's so important for us
[1:09] to take possession of all the promises
[1:12] of god as our own
[1:13] because the power is that we become a
[1:16] partaker of the divine nature
[1:18] and we escape the corruption of the
[1:21] world
[1:22] that's pretty powerful and then back
[1:24] here in second corinthians if you would
[1:26] chapter 7
[1:27] and verse 1 it said as we read this last
[1:30] sunday we want to read it again
[1:31] put it back in our minds having
[1:33] therefore these
[1:35] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[1:38] ourselves from all filthiness
[1:41] of the flesh and spirit perfecting
[1:43] holiness
[1:44] in the fear of god and to remind you
[1:46] from last sunday
[1:48] for when he refers to these promises
[1:50] you'd have to read
[1:51] a few scriptures before that and what is
[1:54] the promises
[1:55] that when we become separate he will be
[1:58] a father to us
[1:59] ye shall be my sons and daughters i will
[2:02] walk in them
[2:03] they will be my people and when we have
[2:05] those words we have relationship
[2:08] with him and so the promises of god
[2:11] what these promises are a relationship
[2:14] with him
[2:15] there's nothing more important in our
[2:16] lives than our relationship with him
[2:19] and that's a promise it's it's not just
[2:22] something we work ourselves into
[2:23] but it's a promise of god and
[2:27] a promise of god it stands alone by
[2:29] itself but we have to possess it and
[2:31] take it
[2:32] once we take it then all that god has in
[2:34] that promise will flow
[2:36] and and have the power behind it because
[2:38] we don't have to
[2:39] work to make that promise work it is
[2:41] what it is god provides for
[2:43] amen may god bless the reading of his
[2:45] word this morning and baby seated
[2:53] paul in the bible refers to
[2:57] the mystery of christ and
[3:02] he's the first one to refer to that term
[3:04] the mystery of christ as a matter of
[3:05] fact paul said
[3:06] i preached christ in a mystery and
[3:09] nobody back in that day really
[3:10] understood all that he was saying by
[3:12] that
[3:13] but he didn't just say i preached christ
[3:15] if he were just to say
[3:16] i preached christ then he would have
[3:19] talked about
[3:20] jesus three and a half years of ministry
[3:22] in matthew mark luke and john
[3:24] he would have referred because that's
[3:25] the only christ people knew
[3:27] then is the christ that had spent three
[3:29] and a half years on the earth
[3:31] and so i don't know if you know this but
[3:33] paul wasn't there for that the disciples
[3:35] were but paul
[3:36] wasn't there to observe jesus in that
[3:39] state in his
[3:40] fleshly body as he healed the sick and
[3:42] raised the dead
[3:43] and so we have that account today
[3:45] matthew mark luke and john
[3:46] but paul had a bit of a deeper calling
[3:49] in that he says i preached
[3:51] christ in a mystery nobody had ever
[3:53] heard that term before
[3:54] so that shows us it's not complicated
[3:56] that there was a mystery in christ
[3:58] further
[3:59] than what he acted out in matthew mark
[4:01] luke and john there was something within
[4:03] him
[4:03] can you say amen john makes another term
[4:06] in first
[4:06] revelations one he says the revelation
[4:09] of jesus christ
[4:10] i don't think too many people had heard
[4:12] that term so it was taking
[4:14] things a bit deeper and paul was
[4:15] commissioned 14 books of the new
[4:17] testament
[4:18] paul had a special calling on him to
[4:20] bring something deeper than just talk
[4:22] about jesus life of three and a half
[4:24] years
[4:24] he was preaching the mystery of christ
[4:26] in other words there was a mystery
[4:27] inside of christ
[4:28] further than just jesus when he was on
[4:30] earth it was to continue on
[4:33] how do we understand that how do we
[4:34] understand what that mystery was
[4:36] i like simple terms i like to understand
[4:39] it by
[4:39] shadows and types in the bible and
[4:42] understanding it simple i have to have
[4:43] it simple how many
[4:45] like to have it simple i like to have
[4:47] things simple because if it says
[4:49] if it's mysterious and i'm not getting
[4:51] it what good are we
[4:52] why are we here but god has a way of
[4:54] making things simple to us
[4:56] and the simplest way we could go
[4:58] throughout the bible and show what the
[4:59] mystery of christ is
[5:00] but the simplest way is to look at adam
[5:03] the first
[5:05] the first adam adam was the first adam
[5:09] and we had the second adam jesus christ
[5:11] but when he was created
[5:13] there was a mystery in adam
[5:17] and that mystery was eve
[5:20] right and god formed her but he took
[5:24] eve from adam and so she was part of the
[5:27] mystery of adam
[5:28] she was part of him she was one with him
[5:30] in spirit can you say amen
[5:32] and so this mystery that laid within him
[5:34] he was one
[5:35] a matter of fact one scripture in
[5:37] genesis refers to them being both adam
[5:39] and eve
[5:40] but it wasn't until then he took the rib
[5:41] out and he formed eve
[5:43] that we finally get to see this mystery
[5:45] that was laying
[5:46] in adam and that was eve she was the
[5:49] mystery laying within adam
[5:50] so that shows us when christ was at
[5:53] calvary
[5:53] there was a mystery laying within him
[6:00] so it wasn't just jesus of the three and
[6:03] a half years
[6:03] but when he went to calvary and the
[6:05] soldier took that spear
[6:07] and pierced his side and water and blood
[6:10] came out and spirit came out
[6:11] we realized spirit came out and that it
[6:14] didn't end right there with jesus
[6:16] but there was a mystery in him if
[6:17] there's how many believe that
[6:19] that jesus was the second adam that's
[6:22] biblical can you say man
[6:24] well if there's a second adam there has
[6:26] to be a second eve
[6:28] if there's a first eve that fell by the
[6:30] word there has to be a second eve that
[6:32] comes back to the full word
[6:34] and she is the bride the chosen ones the
[6:38] believers
[6:38] who are going to fully believe christ
[6:41] she has it within her to believe all of
[6:43] christ
[6:43] because she's a part of christ she came
[6:47] out of christ
[6:50] when paul begins to bring this then you
[6:53] know he
[6:54] you say well where are you referring to
[6:56] well he brings it in so many ways but
[6:58] one place he talks about the jews he
[6:59] said the jews
[7:00] they have their place and different
[7:02] things but he said god was going to
[7:03] bring in a gentile bride
[7:05] and he said he blinded the jews for a
[7:07] season so he could bring in a gentile
[7:09] bride
[7:09] so he's preaching the mystery of christ
[7:11] the mystery of christ is the bride
[7:14] coming out of christ in every age in
[7:16] every church age
[7:17] culminating in this last age there will
[7:20] be a bride that won't fall like eve did
[7:22] but shall be a word bride can i get an
[7:26] amen this morning
[7:28] so uh that's my complicated part and
[7:31] hopefully it was simple but that's
[7:33] that's uh i'm gonna get move on a little
[7:34] bit now because i have a lot of
[7:36] practical things today
[7:37] to talk about when we talk about what is
[7:39] between you and the promise
[7:41] so the disciples could relay the stories
[7:44] of christ in his earthly ministry
[7:46] but paul said there's a mystery in
[7:48] christ and we realize
[7:50] it it was she that was in him so
[7:54] you see then that this relationship with
[7:57] christ
[7:58] is a relationship it's not a religion
[8:03] men follow after religions
[8:07] and men follow after even some of
[8:09] christianity that's become a religion
[8:12] but it's never meant to be a religion
[8:15] when you talk about a husband and wife
[8:17] becoming one by spirit
[8:18] that's not a religion my marriage with
[8:20] sister rebecca is not a religion
[8:23] of do's and don'ts she tells me what to
[8:26] do and i do them
[8:29] or i tell her what to do and she better
[8:31] do them
[8:32] what kind of marriage would that be but
[8:35] out of love
[8:36] out of her heart and we connected and
[8:38] something jailed i just happen to
[8:39] believe there's something
[8:40] before the foundation of the world in
[8:42] god's plan that had us
[8:43] as mates together can you say man and if
[8:46] you believe that about your marriage
[8:48] that that
[8:49] she was something within you she was
[8:51] taken out of you
[8:52] she's a counterpart that's a part of you
[8:54] and god gave me back to her
[8:56] if you believe that about your marriage
[8:57] which you should then we ought to
[8:59] believe it about christ and his bride
[9:01] that it's not a religion
[9:05] it's a relationship
[9:08] amen it's not a duty it's a love
[9:11] we connected because she was a part of
[9:13] me and so much more the christ and his
[9:16] bride
[9:17] it's not a religion it's not a duty we
[9:19] are dutiful people we do follow
[9:22] the rules but if it's a religion and not
[9:24] a relationship we've lost something
[9:30] so this is a mystery and when a person
[9:32] receives this they become one with
[9:34] christ by the holy ghost his promises
[9:36] become
[9:37] his promises become our promises in
[9:40] other words adam and eve
[9:41] christ and his bride his promises are
[9:43] ours we inherit those promises
[9:45] everything that he said we can take that
[9:47] as a promise from him
[9:48] and he's a groom he's a he's a husband
[9:51] who hasn't ever broke his promise
[9:53] now praise the lord we as human men
[9:56] we might break a promise we shouldn't
[9:59] but we we're flawed by humanness can you
[10:01] say amen
[10:02] but this husband of christ has never
[10:04] brother ray he's never broke a promise
[10:06] he's never failed that's what we
[10:08] preached last sunday
[10:09] his covenant can never fail you can fail
[10:12] but he can't fail
[10:15] his covenant is not dependent upon you
[10:17] your mistakes or
[10:18] whatever it is it's not it's dependent
[10:20] he swore by himself
[10:21] he made a covenant by himself and i'm
[10:23] glad he didn't make a covenant with me
[10:25] because i would fail but when you come
[10:27] into the promise and covenant of god
[10:29] it has an element to it it there's no
[10:32] flaw in it
[10:32] it doesn't fail it's going to carry
[10:34] through it's going to be
[10:36] finished his promises are yea and amen
[10:39] and god will fulfill every promise he's
[10:42] always done it he always will
[10:45] now i don't know about you but me a
[10:48] bride
[10:48] takes great security from a man that
[10:51] keeps his promises
[10:53] can you say praise the lord i take great
[10:55] security in that
[10:57] he's never broke a promise so i can
[10:58] trust in every promise of this bible
[11:00] and every promise of this bible is mine
[11:02] i don't dump any of it out it's mine i
[11:04] take it as a possession
[11:06] so now the enemy though is against you
[11:08] coming together in this union
[11:10] and this relationship how many know the
[11:11] enemies against it
[11:13] the enemy is against oneness the enemy
[11:17] his main thing is against oneness when
[11:18] the people become one with god he's
[11:20] against
[11:21] it jesus when he did his miracles
[11:25] you never hear the jews or the pharisees
[11:28] taking up stones against them
[11:31] but when jesus said one day i and my
[11:34] father
[11:35] are one they took up stones against him
[11:40] and that wasn't just them that was the
[11:41] enemy who hates
[11:43] oneness can you say amen and this bride
[11:46] of christ and christ is becoming one
[11:49] with his word
[11:50] more and more as we speak in this last
[11:52] days she's becoming one
[11:53] and that's why the devil's fighting you
[11:55] so hard that's why he's against you it's
[11:57] not your personality
[11:58] it's not that he don't like being around
[12:00] you it's when you become one in relation
[12:02] with
[12:02] ship with christ and you begin to grow
[12:05] in that relationship
[12:06] and the devil's put on your feet he
[12:07] doesn't know what to do with you but
[12:09] he's going to keep fighting
[12:10] this week in my family and we had one of
[12:13] the roughest times this week
[12:14] besides me having to haul a foot of snow
[12:17] out of my quarter-mile driveway
[12:21] that was that was just a natural thing
[12:22] that i didn't expect you know i've had
[12:24] people visit my home last summer when i
[12:26] got it and
[12:26] one of the nice things about it's a
[12:28] quarter mile driveway a beautiful tree
[12:29] especially in the fall
[12:30] and you just drive down it and it's so
[12:32] nice a quarter of a mile just to get to
[12:34] the house and it's like
[12:35] you know you're just toting along there
[12:37] this is beautiful people have said
[12:38] what a beautiful drive you know and i
[12:40] get in my truck and
[12:41] i've never had that i've lived right on
[12:43] the street in toledo right in the street
[12:44] in slovenia
[12:45] and traffic going by so i quarter my oh
[12:48] wow that's great
[12:49] you know it's almost heaven west
[12:51] virginia
[12:52] blue ridge you just feel like you're
[12:53] going out to west virginia
[12:57] but i forgot when the snow came
[13:00] i wasn't thinking that i'd be out a half
[13:03] a day
[13:04] hauling a foot of snow out of that
[13:05] quarter-mile driveway but praise the
[13:07] lord anyhow
[13:08] the devil's been fighting in other ways
[13:10] my family this week
[13:11] mental battles depression
[13:15] sickness he's not going to let up
[13:19] and the reason he doesn't like us
[13:20] friends is not because of our
[13:22] personality or something
[13:24] it's because when we come in one with
[13:26] this word in our relationship
[13:28] he cannot stand that oneness that's why
[13:32] i'm preaching today
[13:33] about what is between you and the
[13:35] promises of god what is between you and
[13:37] the relationship with god
[13:38] because anything that's between you and
[13:40] the relationship you want to remove it
[13:42] nothing can you say amen and brother
[13:44] branham says here in
[13:46] 1963 this is a great quote from brother
[13:48] branham why do you hunger church
[13:50] why do you thirst if you guys can pull
[13:52] that up if you had it
[13:54] the enemy is against this oneness and
[13:55] this is the way you said it in christ
[13:57] the mystery of god reveal
[13:58] you guys have that why do you hunger
[14:00] church why do you
[14:02] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[14:04] this hidden secret to you
[14:06] but you let so many things get it out of
[14:08] you you let your job
[14:10] you let your wife you let your husband
[14:12] you let your children
[14:13] you let the cares of this world you let
[14:15] some pastor
[14:16] you let somebody else get it out of you
[14:18] when you know that way down in your
[14:20] heart
[14:21] you're thirsty hungry it's god trying to
[14:24] reveal it to you
[14:25] see the revelation at the beginning the
[14:27] quote why do you hunger church why are
[14:29] you thirst who put that thirst within
[14:31] you
[14:31] god put a thirst within you for more of
[14:34] him
[14:35] he created a thirst for more of him and
[14:38] so you have that craving
[14:40] but he's saying there's things that get
[14:43] in between you
[14:44] and him revealing that to you he's
[14:47] mentioned the pastor he's mentioned
[14:48] your husband and wife the cares of this
[14:50] world that's pretty close
[14:52] things but we have our trials and we
[14:55] have our
[14:56] our hiccups in life and we have our
[14:58] sicknesses and we have
[14:59] all kinds of things that come and all
[15:02] many times
[15:03] it's something to get in between we have
[15:05] people who are against us people gossip
[15:07] against us
[15:07] people and i'll talk about some more
[15:09] things today but
[15:10] things get in between us and the
[15:12] promises and what we learn is we've been
[15:15] speaking in this
[15:16] about the promised land and joshua
[15:17] coming into the promised land
[15:19] and the difference in the people being
[15:20] under moses a prophet and under joshua
[15:23] in the promised land
[15:24] is the agenda to come out of egypt and
[15:26] come out of the wilderness
[15:27] is to take the promised land that was
[15:29] theirs and they had to fight
[15:31] every inch of the way to get it you have
[15:34] to fight for every promise of god
[15:37] it's not going to come easy can you say
[15:38] amen the devil doesn't want you to take
[15:41] the promises
[15:42] and so the land that god gave israel was
[15:44] the type of our land
[15:46] our bible promises satan doesn't want
[15:48] you to take them and possess them and
[15:50] take them for yourself
[15:51] as long as the pastor's preaching about
[15:53] them that's fine
[15:54] but i'm preaching you should take the
[15:56] promises yourself
[15:57] and live in those promises and remove
[16:00] the things that are in between you and
[16:02] the promises
[16:04] they had to remove what was in between
[16:06] they had to destroy the enemy
[16:07] they had to put the enemy under their
[16:08] feet so you are
[16:10] so that you're not stuck where you are
[16:13] in your relationship with the lord you
[16:15] have to break through
[16:16] and go beyond where you are how many
[16:18] want to go beyond where you are
[16:20] god bless you three four of us
[16:23] i said how many wants to go beyond where
[16:25] you are
[16:27] you know back when they they they
[16:29] realized there was a sound when they had
[16:31] the
[16:31] supersonic airplanes or whatever they
[16:33] realized when they got to a certain
[16:35] speed
[16:36] they would break what was called the
[16:37] sound barrier but did you know once it
[16:39] gets
[16:40] right to that moment of of breaking
[16:42] through the sound barrier
[16:44] the the unit begins to shake and there's
[16:46] noise and
[16:47] we hear that noise sometimes and that's
[16:49] what happens a lot of times in people's
[16:51] life
[16:51] they can't get beyond their sound
[16:53] barrier they can't be
[16:54] get they get stuck in a certain area in
[16:56] their life and that's because the enemy
[16:58] is holding them back
[16:59] and so sometimes the preaching comes
[17:01] forth from the pulpit
[17:03] and people even shake a little bit and
[17:04] they squirm a little bit because why
[17:06] god's calling them to a deeper walk with
[17:09] christ
[17:09] and they can't break the barrier they
[17:12] can't go beyond where they're at
[17:13] but what you don't realize in that sound
[17:15] barrier it may shake a little bit it may
[17:17] make a lot of noise
[17:18] but once it breaks through it becomes
[17:20] unlimited the speed that it can take
[17:24] and i'll say to your life once you break
[17:26] through the barriers that satan has put
[17:27] there
[17:28] you're going to find victory on the
[17:30] other side you're going to live in the
[17:32] promises of god
[17:33] you're going to have a victory that
[17:34] you've never experienced before saying
[17:36] all the promises of god are yeah and
[17:38] amen
[17:39] they are my promises they're not just
[17:41] the pastors they're not just someone
[17:42] else
[17:43] but they're my promises and satan's
[17:45] keeping me from them and i'm going to
[17:47] fight every inch of the way
[17:48] until i take them back for me this is my
[17:51] inheritance
[17:52] you remember when i started this series
[17:53] i said people get pretty
[17:55] ugly sometimes when they know they have
[17:57] an inheritance coming and
[17:58] and it's not theirs yet they go fight
[18:00] for it they go to court for it
[18:02] if somebody's not just giving it to them
[18:04] they got to go fight for what's theirs
[18:06] somebody left me inheritance and i'm
[18:08] going to go fight for it
[18:10] but people spiritually won't fight for
[18:12] their spiritual inheritance
[18:14] they won't fight for their land they let
[18:16] too many things get in the way
[18:18] of this mystery as brother branham
[18:21] called it
[18:22] and so number one everybody ready for
[18:24] these i got about 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 of
[18:26] them
[18:27] but i'm only going to get to about four
[18:28] today so we'll continue this the next
[18:31] few sundays because i'll never have
[18:32] realized last night i'll never get to it
[18:34] that's one of the greatest promises if
[18:35] you turn with me to acts 2 38
[18:37] and i'm preaching on what is between you
[18:40] and the promises
[18:41] acts 2 acts 2.
[19:00] verse 37
[19:07] now when they had heard this they were
[19:09] pricked in their heart and said unto
[19:11] peter and to the rest of the apostles
[19:13] men and brethren what shall we do and
[19:14] notice that prick in their heart means
[19:16] they were convicted
[19:17] by the preaching that peter had just
[19:18] done there's a conviction in the heart
[19:20] that's where it starts the holy spirit
[19:23] moves upon a life under conviction
[19:25] it's not a mechanical exercise but the
[19:27] holy spirit convicts the heart
[19:28] they were pricked in their heart what do
[19:30] we do need to do to be saved
[19:32] god was already working on their hearts
[19:34] before they come to this
[19:35] and peter said to them repent and be
[19:37] baptized every one of you
[19:39] in the name of jesus christ for the
[19:40] remission of sins
[19:42] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[19:44] holy ghost next scripture
[19:47] for the promise is unto you and to your
[19:50] children
[19:51] and to all that are far off even as many
[19:54] as the lord our god
[19:56] shall call the holy ghost coming to you
[19:59] is the promise
[20:03] it is a promise but is one of the
[20:05] greatest promises
[20:07] can you say amen and so he says that the
[20:10] promise is unto you and your children so
[20:12] but if you step back in the scripture
[20:13] before what would keep somebody from the
[20:16] promise of the holy ghost
[20:17] lack of repentance and that's my first
[20:19] one if you want to write it down
[20:21] first one that we have as something that
[20:23] gets in between you and the promise of
[20:25] the holy ghost
[20:26] is repentance because if you don't
[20:28] repent you can't come to the gift of the
[20:30] holy ghost
[20:31] if you don't repent you can't come to
[20:33] the gift of the holy ghost can you say
[20:35] amen
[20:35] and notice it didn't end you know some
[20:38] churches say that the holy ghost ended
[20:40] in the book of acts it doesn't end in
[20:42] the book of acts matter of fact there's
[20:43] no amen at the book of acts
[20:45] the book of acts didn't end at acts it
[20:47] continues on
[20:48] no man has a right to say that every
[20:50] everything stopped there
[20:52] no man has a right to say that there's
[20:53] no amen at the end of it and here's
[20:55] another proof
[20:56] he said this promise of the holy ghost
[20:58] is unto you
[20:59] and unto your children as many as the
[21:02] lord our god shall call
[21:03] i don't find any ending to that so today
[21:06] i can believe from my children
[21:07] that they should receive the holy ghost
[21:09] as well he didn't put an end of an age
[21:11] he didn't put any time he said this
[21:13] promise it's your promise
[21:15] it's the gift of the holy ghost if you
[21:17] repent you receive the gift of the holy
[21:19] ghost
[21:20] and it doesn't end in acts it's unto you
[21:22] and to your children
[21:24] there's a multi-generational vision
[21:27] there's a goal for your kids
[21:29] teach them the things of god teach them
[21:31] that they get them right in that rest
[21:32] atmosphere do all of that
[21:33] but i'll tell you you need to pray that
[21:35] a true experience with christ
[21:37] happens with your kids more than
[21:38] anything else and guess what parents
[21:40] this promise is unto you and your
[21:42] children
[21:44] and all that are far off even as many as
[21:46] the lord our god
[21:47] shall call i'm in the last generation
[21:50] here but i'm saying people
[21:51] god's still calling people and if he's
[21:54] still calling people
[21:55] people can still receive the holy ghost
[21:58] oh there ought to be a bigger amen than
[22:00] that
[22:00] this is bible friends this is repentance
[22:04] and baptism but
[22:05] what keeps people from the holy ghost
[22:08] repentance true
[22:09] genuine repentance and not talking about
[22:11] a forced thing
[22:12] not talking about a mental exercise god
[22:16] is convicting the heart
[22:17] god is pricking the heart and if you
[22:20] don't repent
[22:21] then you can't have this rep promise and
[22:23] so this may be very basic to you but
[22:25] listen this is probably
[22:27] the ultimate promise to talk about what
[22:29] has been between you and the promise of
[22:30] the holy ghost
[22:31] lack of repentance
[22:35] something in between you and
[22:38] one of these and this promise and acts
[22:41] 19 verse 2 says by the way
[22:43] have you received he said to the men
[22:45] that were already baptized under john's
[22:47] baptism
[22:48] have you received the holy ghost since
[22:51] you believed
[22:52] not when you believe but since you
[22:53] believed showing that this is something
[22:56] deeper than just a mental exercise
[22:58] this is a conversion this
[23:02] is a change of nature this is
[23:05] his divine nature coming inside of us
[23:08] this isn't us trying to be like christ
[23:11] with our old nature
[23:12] this is him changing our nature to put
[23:14] his nature within
[23:16] us that we can live this word
[23:20] genesis chapter 12 and verse 1. we'll go
[23:22] to abraham here for the next one
[23:24] and we're talking about separation a
[23:26] little bit what's things that keep you
[23:27] from the promises
[23:28] well here abraham and genesis 12
[23:32] had to boy they got it quicker than i
[23:34] got my bible open they got it up there
[23:35] already genesis 12
[23:37] and verse 1 now the lord said unto
[23:39] abraham
[23:40] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[23:43] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[23:46] a land that i will show thee
[23:48] and i will make thee a great nation and
[23:50] i will bless thee and make thy name
[23:51] great
[23:52] and thou shalt be a blessing and i will
[23:55] bless them that bless thee and curse
[23:56] them that curseth thee
[23:58] and in thee shall all families of the
[24:00] earth
[24:01] be blessed praise the lord what a
[24:04] blessing what a promise he gave to this
[24:06] heathen man he was a heathen he was an
[24:09] idol worshiper
[24:11] and god comes and says i'm going to
[24:14] bless you
[24:15] i'm going to bless your generation and
[24:16] bless your seed him and his wife were
[24:18] barren as they said last sunday
[24:19] they were barren and he had to believe
[24:22] something impossible
[24:23] that he would be the father of many
[24:24] nations and here's
[24:26] here's the promise i'm giving you a
[24:28] promise i'm making you a promise abraham
[24:32] but what did he have to do first what
[24:33] was in between abraham and the promise
[24:35] right there
[24:36] separating from his country
[24:41] separating from his kindred
[24:45] so i want to talk about just a minute
[24:47] family
[24:51] what would happen if abraham said you
[24:53] know what my family's too close to me
[24:56] my father's house we're just too tight
[24:59] would abraham would have taken the
[25:00] promise no because god told him
[25:02] you've got to separate from all that in
[25:04] order to receive the promise
[25:07] did he not say it now i'm not here on a
[25:10] campaign today
[25:11] to separate all your family members
[25:12] that's not what i'm trying to do
[25:14] what i'm trying to say is that when god
[25:16] calls you to his promise
[25:17] of relationship with him nothing can
[25:20] stand in the way
[25:21] and many times i'm speaking from
[25:23] experience
[25:24] and i'm speaking from watching people's
[25:25] lives family is the thing
[25:27] that keeps you from moving on with
[25:29] christ
[25:30] believe it or not family and maybe
[25:33] that's why god told abraham
[25:35] in order for this to work in order for
[25:36] you to latch a hold of the promise and
[25:38] go to your land
[25:39] you're going to have to leave your
[25:40] kindred leave your father's house
[25:42] and it's kind of like he says to the
[25:43] young man when he's leaving leave and
[25:45] cleave in other words
[25:46] a man must leave father and mother and
[25:49] cleave unto his wife
[25:50] separation is involved and if a person
[25:53] isn't willing to separate
[25:54] then they're not willing to take the
[25:55] full promise of god can you say amen
[25:58] and so this was in between him and the
[26:00] promise and so it may seem to you
[26:02] it may seem strange to you that god
[26:05] would say this but family
[26:07] can get in between you and the promises
[26:08] sometimes family can be the greatest
[26:11] thing in the world
[26:12] or they can be the greatest hindrance
[26:14] sometimes to your life in christ
[26:16] i'm gonna get real practical here family
[26:19] can be the greatest thing in the world
[26:21] but in my observation i have watched
[26:24] family members
[26:25] with an agenda to keep people from
[26:28] moving on to the promise of god
[26:30] usually it's unbelievers but guess what
[26:32] sometimes it's not always unbelievers
[26:35] sometimes as people don't have a true
[26:36] experience with christ and they're in
[26:37] church
[26:38] but they're influencing them to do a
[26:40] different thing
[26:42] instead of move on with god
[26:45] and you have to watch
[26:48] this so closely because it's it's almost
[26:52] like a default thing that we do to cling
[26:55] to family
[27:00] it has such emotional ties to it right
[27:04] has a lot of emotion to it and some of
[27:06] that is good some of that is normal in
[27:07] fact
[27:08] that is that is normal we have closer
[27:10] emotional ties to family
[27:12] sometimes than we do that are not family
[27:14] but
[27:15] if we take it too far we tend to draw
[27:18] our safety
[27:19] and our counsel from family because we
[27:21] have the roots there
[27:22] we have the emotional thing there we
[27:24] have the tie there and we tend to
[27:26] default to clinging back to family
[27:28] when life gets a little bit of struggle
[27:29] we can clean the family instead of
[27:31] clinging to the lord you might get quiet
[27:34] but that's all right i'm going to go
[27:35] ahead and say it anyway
[27:37] i'm telling you family can be used of
[27:39] the enemy if you're not watching closely
[27:41] to keep you from crossing the sound
[27:43] bearer and drawing closer to the
[27:44] promises of god
[27:46] mother-in-law's father-in-law's and i
[27:48] never like to speak against my
[27:49] mother-in-law because she's not one of
[27:50] those bad ones
[27:51] all the mother-in-law jokes i can't use
[27:53] on my mother-in-law
[27:54] because she's a great one she's a woman
[27:56] of god holy ghost filled
[27:58] wonderful wonderful woman i always like
[27:59] to use those jokes but i can't use them
[28:01] because i got a good mother-in-law
[28:02] you know the joke that says the penalty
[28:04] for polygamy what's the penalty for
[28:05] polygamy
[28:06] two mother-in-laws
[28:10] so now i could go on and on and on but i
[28:11] can't use them with my mother-in-law but
[28:13] i'm telling you i've watched situations
[28:14] mother-in-law
[28:15] mothers fathers
[28:19] can not realize it but they're getting
[28:21] in the way
[28:23] of a son or a daughter finding the holy
[28:26] ghost
[28:27] finding their own life in christ
[28:28] sometimes finding their vision for life
[28:30] finding what their calling is and
[28:32] they're micromanaging and just keeping
[28:34] all that famine together
[28:36] and mother hen is is controlling the
[28:38] whole thing
[28:39] now am i alone in this or have people
[28:41] seen this before
[28:45] and it becomes a detriment to a young
[28:46] man or a young woman because
[28:48] they're in they've drawn a comfort from
[28:50] the security of a family
[28:52] i've actually watched where parents will
[28:54] shield their kids from the conviction of
[28:56] the holy ghost
[28:57] thinking that's doing them damage you do
[28:59] not want to shield your kids
[29:01] if it's the true conviction of the holy
[29:02] ghost if they're crying and being moved
[29:05] by the spirit of god to give their heart
[29:06] to god
[29:07] and be baptized that's nothing to be
[29:09] afraid of
[29:10] if they've been corrected by the word
[29:12] that's nothing to be afraid of
[29:14] you want that in their lives you want
[29:17] the voice of truth in their life
[29:18] you want them to be corrected but to
[29:20] step in there and try to
[29:21] to be a buffer for the oh we don't want
[29:24] to hurt their feelings you're a
[29:25] detriment to that child
[29:28] let them hear the truth let them hear
[29:30] the voice of truth
[29:31] let them be convicted by the holy spirit
[29:34] because that's when they come to a real
[29:36] true experience with the lord can you
[29:38] say amen
[29:39] amen i hope i'm making i hope i'm not
[29:41] making more enemies here this morning
[29:43] praise the lord family can be the
[29:45] greatest thing in the world but it can
[29:46] be a great hindrance
[29:47] families can make decisions for other
[29:50] family members
[29:51] and it can take you away from your life
[29:52] in christ can you say amen
[29:55] mother-in-laws mothers sometimes
[29:57] sometimes
[29:58] overly exercise too much control over
[30:01] the entire family
[30:02] mom has exercised control over our boys
[30:04] and they won't let them become men
[30:07] exercise too much over their boys and
[30:09] won't let them become
[30:10] men they're too involved they're
[30:12] treating them like a little boy still
[30:14] that's a great problem especially if
[30:16] they're coming to their own vision and
[30:18] their own calling in life
[30:19] you can be a hindrance to that
[30:23] you say amen and
[30:26] the normal pattern is for moms to raise
[30:29] them
[30:29] then the daddy and this is in leadership
[30:31] that you'll find this
[30:32] in the message leadership after mom
[30:34] raises them then she turns them over to
[30:36] a schoolteacher
[30:37] and then the school teacher influences
[30:39] them and then daddy teaches in the
[30:40] family trader whatever he teaches he
[30:42] teaches and trains them for life
[30:44] then at that point mother is to withdraw
[30:46] and kind of a little bit and not her
[30:48] love
[30:48] but withdraw her input as much when he
[30:50] becomes a man because the daddy gives
[30:52] some of that this is the normal thing if
[30:54] that doesn't happen
[30:55] you're going to be a detriment to that
[30:56] young man it's not like it was when this
[30:59] momma
[31:00] and baby it's not liking us and then
[31:02] even daddy's
[31:03] gives them training does all he can but
[31:05] there's a certain point
[31:06] that they have to cut the cords and let
[31:09] that boy find
[31:10] his calling and the blueprint for his
[31:12] life you see
[31:13] god has the blueprint for your
[31:15] children's life
[31:17] not you not you
[31:22] but when you got it all figured out and
[31:23] what career they're going to do and
[31:24] which directions they should go
[31:26] so you weigh in pretty heavy and that
[31:28] boy or that girl struggles because
[31:30] they're praying about what god wants
[31:31] them to do
[31:33] they're calling in life they're supposed
[31:36] to find
[31:37] their way and god god has a blueprint
[31:40] for that young man that young woman's
[31:42] life god has a plan now if they come and
[31:44] ask
[31:45] which a lot of times some kids don't
[31:46] come and ask anymore which is very
[31:48] frustrating to me
[31:49] because i'm used to being asked and if
[31:50] i'm not asked i weigh in my opinion
[31:52] anyway
[31:54] me and becca are both firstborns we're
[31:56] both
[31:57] drivers and you know that can have an
[32:00] effect on kids after so many years
[32:02] because we weigh in and we you know we
[32:04] do it and so it's been a transition for
[32:06] us
[32:06] to wait until they ask us to weigh in
[32:11] and there's a lot of biting of the
[32:12] tongue that goes on
[32:14] because you want to say something now if
[32:17] they live in my home
[32:18] let me just balance this out they live
[32:20] in my home and they're doing something
[32:21] that's bringing a bad spirit in my home
[32:23] or they're living something that's not
[32:25] the representation of our home
[32:27] they're going to hear it from us because
[32:28] that's my duty as a parent
[32:30] i'm going to be polite about it and say
[32:31] we don't believe that as a family i
[32:32] don't want that in my home
[32:34] if you want to have all this worldly
[32:35] stuff you're going to have to move out
[32:37] i've never had to say that thankfully
[32:38] but
[32:38] we weigh in when things are wrong if
[32:40] there's an evil spirit we sense that's
[32:42] keeping us up at night we're going to be
[32:44] vocal about it and that's the problem
[32:45] today parents aren't vocal enough about
[32:47] those things
[32:48] you can't let those things go but as far
[32:50] as the calling on a man's life young
[32:52] man's life
[32:54] let that boy get a hold of god and find
[32:56] what his calling is
[32:57] because god has the blueprint for his
[32:59] life what am i talking about i'm talking
[33:01] about family members
[33:03] who can get in the way of of us
[33:06] sometimes
[33:06] even you that are older ones family
[33:08] members are still weighing in pretty
[33:10] heavy
[33:10] and they determine decisions that are
[33:13] made and
[33:14] i just say for you young men young
[33:16] married men and young married women
[33:17] get all the advice you can you have to
[33:20] make the decisions for yourself
[33:21] but don't let everybody else always make
[33:23] your decisions
[33:24] get all the good counsel you can but
[33:26] then go before god
[33:28] and make a decision based on the word of
[33:30] god
[33:31] and stick with it and if some other
[33:34] influence from family says
[33:36] you don't have to do that and oh you
[33:38] don't have to do that don't spank those
[33:40] kids
[33:42] that's a grandparent's statement
[33:46] oh you don't need to do that
[33:49] that's a good little boy i mean look at
[33:50] all the good that he's done and
[33:52] his smiles and how pretty she is
[33:56] back off a little bit and then your kids
[33:58] are looking to say back off
[34:00] you didn't back off from me
[34:04] let's this back off come from where's
[34:06] that come from i don't remember you
[34:08] backing off at all
[34:12] but we have to be careful because
[34:13] there's a certain point in his head
[34:15] if they're asking for the advice but
[34:16] we've got to let the image of god and
[34:19] what god has called them to
[34:21] to serve the lord as their family we've
[34:23] got to give that freedom
[34:28] the worst part is when it hinders
[34:31] somebody's walk with the lord
[34:33] in a family's walk with the lord there's
[34:35] a normal letting go especially when god
[34:37] is calling
[34:38] god has a blueprint specific to their
[34:40] lives and it wasn't drawn up by mom or
[34:42] dad
[34:43] but god but family is a very strong
[34:45] influence it gets in between you and the
[34:47] promises
[34:48] many times be careful of that it's
[34:50] terribly strong on human beings because
[34:52] we we we we we have
[34:56] roots with our family we have
[34:57] connections emotional
[34:59] connections um and so
[35:02] sometimes we can talk people right out
[35:04] of the conviction they feel for god to
[35:06] do something
[35:07] and talk them right out of being at
[35:09] church faithfully
[35:13] and let me say this as i come to the end
[35:16] of this part
[35:17] it is not good for parents to pass on
[35:21] their resentment towards the church
[35:24] or towards the church people that is so
[35:28] unfair what you need to do is get an
[35:32] honor repentance and repent of your
[35:33] resentment
[35:35] and get healed of your resentment but if
[35:37] you don't don't pass that resentment on
[35:39] to your kids
[35:41] let them have a fresh look at christ
[35:44] a fresh look at the church a fresh look
[35:47] at people in the church
[35:49] let them have a fresh look don't require
[35:52] them to continue on your bitterness
[35:56] it's unfair many times you say well why
[35:59] don't kids respond more to the gospel
[36:01] and why don't kids
[36:02] many times it's family members who have
[36:05] put so much seeds in their mind
[36:07] against preachers and against the church
[36:10] and pete church people and be leery of
[36:12] them and they're the legalistics and all
[36:15] be careful the seeds you plant in those
[36:18] kids mind
[36:19] my dad used to say it this way and he
[36:21] was talking about elisha
[36:23] when those parents talked about elisha
[36:26] and put him down and called him baldi
[36:28] around the kitchen table probably and
[36:31] then those kids could go and just
[36:33] disrespect elijah and call them old
[36:35] baldy and elijah called a curse on him
[36:37] and the she bears come out
[36:39] you see but he said it was the parents
[36:41] that somebody had to tell those kids
[36:43] that
[36:44] to have such disrespect for the prophet
[36:46] like that somebody had to say it and
[36:48] they heard it around the house
[36:50] putting down preachers putting down
[36:51] ministers
[36:53] you know it seems like the holy spirit
[36:54] just wants me to keep on this subject a
[36:56] little while
[36:57] there's something wrong when that goes
[36:58] on because you are putting
[37:00] something in between your kids in the
[37:02] promises
[37:04] and he said he talked to them so much
[37:06] and said this so much to parents
[37:07] that now they had disrespect for him and
[37:09] god just god destroyed their
[37:11] at least elijah he called the shebas out
[37:13] and so when we we have to be careful
[37:15] we're not passing on our old bitterness
[37:17] and our own
[37:18] incidences that happen took place our
[37:21] old things that
[37:22] that our old old conversations and
[37:24] corrupted
[37:25] conversations we pass it on to our kids
[37:28] and it's not fair
[37:29] they need a fresh look at christ
[37:36] they need to keep their innocence about
[37:38] them
[37:40] you know the pastor's home is a
[37:42] difficult place because we have to
[37:43] go out of our way to be careful that we
[37:45] don't say things that would put
[37:47] impressions sometimes the wrong
[37:48] impression in people's
[37:50] minds and our kids minds we have to be
[37:52] so careful and more more careful
[37:54] but all of us need to be mindful that we
[37:56] can pass on
[37:58] our bitterness and our resentment let me
[38:00] go back to your parents
[38:01] you know what either the altar here or
[38:05] the altar in your heart is the only
[38:07] solving of that bitterness
[38:12] and that's what we'll get into in the
[38:13] next couple sundays people can get in
[38:16] people who have done you wrong can get
[38:17] in between you and your full promises of
[38:20] god
[38:21] you're living way below your potential
[38:23] in the lord
[38:24] because you are so affected
[38:27] by people who have looked at you wrong
[38:30] who have done you wrong
[38:32] well guess what you know if if the
[38:34] church is the only place that that
[38:35] happens
[38:36] then you're being lied to because i can
[38:40] have people look at me wrong at walmart
[38:43] i don't even know who they are if i was
[38:45] going on how people looked at me
[38:47] and they give me the elevator look or
[38:48] they give my wife the elevator look up
[38:50] and down and up and down
[38:51] people do that everywhere shouldn't we
[38:53] teach our children our kids that people
[38:55] are people anywhere even within the body
[38:58] of christ they have their humanness
[39:00] about them
[39:01] and they'll fail you why do we have this
[39:04] thing that their
[39:05] church have to be perfect and when
[39:07] they're not perfect oh they should have
[39:09] been a better christian than that i'm
[39:10] leaving the church
[39:11] and they go find all their friends out
[39:13] in the world thinking they're never
[39:14] going to do them wrong
[39:15] i'm here to tell you the world is a lot
[39:17] more cruel in things
[39:20] i'd rather any day to have my kids
[39:22] around this congregation
[39:24] take the very worst of us in this
[39:26] congregation which i won't mention names
[39:32] i stand with the very worst of us here
[39:35] okay as being people of god
[39:39] and i would lead my children to say
[39:41] listen you're better off to be around
[39:43] people like that
[39:44] than the people of the world
[39:47] with all their corpse and all their
[39:48] weirdness and you know
[39:50] things they say out of place sometimes
[39:52] you're better off there because
[39:54] in the midst that some holy ghost-filled
[39:55] people can't find a better
[39:57] atmosphere than holy ghost people
[40:00] is this all right with everybody we have
[40:03] to be careful
[40:04] and we have to be careful of mamas and
[40:06] daddies and and
[40:07] sometimes somebody can be older and
[40:09] still depending on their daddy
[40:11] depending on their mommy and they're
[40:13] making decisions for them
[40:15] they're making decisions for them that's
[40:17] actually keeping them from a
[40:18] deeper walk with god because mom you
[40:20] know she's everything
[40:22] dad he's everything be careful of that
[40:25] they may be getting in between you and
[40:27] their promise and guess what they don't
[40:28] even know it
[40:29] they don't even know they're doing it
[40:31] it's just become a normal thing to them
[40:33] and it's like a coddling of little my
[40:36] baby boy
[40:36] or calling him my baby girl and
[40:40] listen on the other side of this is the
[40:44] promises of god for you
[40:46] it's a great thing just
[40:50] if you bring up matthew chapter 10 verse
[40:53] 34
[40:55] this is the way jesus said look what he
[40:56] said
[40:59] think not that i come to send peace on
[41:01] the earth
[41:02] i came not to send peace but a sword for
[41:05] i am come to set a man at variance
[41:07] against his father
[41:09] and the daughter against her mother and
[41:12] the daughter-in-law against her mother i
[41:13] didn't say it jesus said it
[41:16] thought he was supposed to come to see
[41:17] peace well he is some sent to and peace
[41:19] to us
[41:20] but if there's something in between you
[41:21] and him the word is the sword
[41:24] and it's going to cut you away from that
[41:26] so you can be closer to the lord
[41:28] you understand what the scripture is
[41:29] saying so i've come to sin
[41:31] there's going to be variants and there's
[41:32] going to have to be some separation if
[41:34] it's keeping you from he explains it
[41:36] later he that loveth father and mother
[41:37] more than me
[41:38] is not worthy of me and he that loveth
[41:42] son or daughter more than me is not
[41:44] worthy of me
[41:44] ask yourself the question do i love my
[41:47] family more than i love the lord
[41:50] oh it's so quiet in here do i love my
[41:54] daughters and sons more than i love the
[41:55] lord
[41:56] what if they were to go awry are you
[41:58] going to continue with the lord are you
[42:00] just going to go along with them
[42:03] it's about you and the lord it's about
[42:04] you in the promises
[42:06] he says and he that taketh not up his
[42:08] cross and followed after me
[42:10] is not worthy of me he that findeth his
[42:12] life shall lose it and he that loseth
[42:14] his life for my sake shall find it did
[42:16] he just tie
[42:17] losing your life and finding it to
[42:19] family sometimes
[42:20] that you can embrace a life with family
[42:23] family
[42:24] family and lose the life of the lord
[42:28] could it be that's what jesus is saying
[42:31] what if some of your family is in
[42:33] between you and the promises that's all
[42:34] i'm saying if your whole life is just
[42:36] your family
[42:37] it'll be empty at the end i'm going to
[42:40] say it again
[42:42] if your whole life is wrapped up in just
[42:43] your family it'll be empty at the end
[42:47] don't be discourteous to family members
[42:50] love them
[42:52] be kind but don't let them get
[42:55] in between you and the promises of god
[43:00] is that okay with everybody what time is
[43:02] it
[43:05] all right it's time oh my 20 to one so
[43:09] i'm gonna have to skip let's skip to the
[43:11] end
[43:14] skip to the end there's a few in hebrews
[43:17] i want to get to i'll get to them next
[43:18] sunday
[43:19] some really good ones in hebrews the
[43:22] children of israel and i want to talk
[43:23] about this
[43:23] really good ones that gets them in
[43:25] between us and the promise
[43:27] but here's let's take let's jump to the
[43:29] last one here on the
[43:30] on one that i believe is gets between
[43:32] you and the promise and that's
[43:34] compromise
[43:36] the first meeting to compromise is
[43:38] settle a dispute by mutual concession
[43:41] meet each other halfway find the middle
[43:42] ground come to terms come to an
[43:44] understanding make a deal
[43:46] if you're making a deal with the devil
[43:48] it's not a good thing
[43:50] making concessions find a happy medium
[43:52] strike a balance give and
[43:53] take split the difference sometimes we
[43:55] have to do this in a marriage sometimes
[43:57] so it can be a good thing but then we
[44:00] realize
[44:00] it can be a bad thing when it comes to
[44:03] the devil or compromising
[44:04] on the word of god we don't compromise
[44:07] the word of god
[44:08] for family or anyone else we don't
[44:10] compromise uh when it comes to the devil
[44:12] telling us something different than the
[44:13] word of god
[44:14] we don't make a deal with the devil the
[44:15] other meaning to compromise is
[44:17] accept standards that are lower than
[44:19] desirable you compromise on standards
[44:21] that you used to believe years ago god
[44:24] does not want us to compromise
[44:25] if it was true 30 years ago it's true
[44:28] today
[44:29] if it was in the word many years ago we
[44:31] believed it and lived it and dressed
[44:32] that way and acted that way
[44:34] it's still true don't let culture take
[44:37] away our absolutes
[44:40] if it was true you know what for a woman
[44:42] that wore a bikini
[44:43] 100 years ago she was put in the jail as
[44:46] an insane woman
[44:48] if that was true back then it's true
[44:50] today there's something wrong with a
[44:52] woman like that
[44:53] now you wouldn't never say that to
[44:56] personally to a person but it's
[44:57] happening in culture that things that
[44:58] are
[44:59] acceptable now were not acceptable years
[45:01] ago common sense said there's something
[45:03] wrong with that person being naked
[45:05] don't compromise on the standards of the
[45:08] word of god can you say amen
[45:10] if you're living a compromising life
[45:12] then then it's keeping you from the full
[45:14] promise of god
[45:15] can you say amen compromise keeps you
[45:18] from the promise but sometimes if we
[45:20] remove the compromises out of our life
[45:23] then we realize we're left with one
[45:24] thing a matter of fact if you took the
[45:26] word
[45:27] calm off of this then you would have
[45:30] your promise
[45:34] amen
[45:38] if you took some dot-coms out of your
[45:39] life
[45:43] you'd have a lot more of the promises oh
[45:47] way too many dot coms that are not
[45:49] healthy
[45:50] that are not right some of you boys
[45:52] dabbling in some of those dot coms
[45:55] that are wrong and you know it maybe if
[45:58] you remove those dot coms
[46:00] you'd be a moral boy that's taken
[46:02] possession of the promises of god in
[46:04] your life
[46:04] and in a greater relationship with
[46:06] christ
[46:08] brother brahman says something here that
[46:09] will end on today is such a good thing i
[46:11] wanted to read it in this service
[46:14] wonderful thing he says here we never
[46:15] join the church or come into the church
[46:17] to come to a picnic we must realize we
[46:20] are coming to a battleground
[46:21] i never come for people to pat me on the
[46:23] back and say brother branham you're a
[46:25] wonderful person no sir
[46:27] i come there with a shield on i don't
[46:29] need a shield for that
[46:30] i come with a helmet and the armor i
[46:32] come to fight fight
[46:34] every inch of the ground god told joshua
[46:37] every place the soldier of your foot
[46:39] treads upon that i give you
[46:41] so footsteps meant possession and when
[46:44] the church
[46:45] gets to a place it compromises with
[46:48] creeds
[46:49] and compromises with the word and
[46:51] compromises with the world look at that
[46:54] compromises with creeds creeds and
[46:56] dogmas take away from the bible
[46:59] trees and dogs makes people compromise
[47:01] and take certain parts out of the bible
[47:03] that they shouldn't
[47:04] we don't have a right to do that leave
[47:06] the bible the way that it is
[47:09] the denominational creeds set up their
[47:12] thing that takes pieces of the bible out
[47:14] this isn't meant to be this isn't and so
[47:16] they establish it that's a compromise
[47:19] and then he says copper white was the
[47:20] next one he says compromising
[47:22] with the word we shouldn't compromise
[47:24] with the word and then we shouldn't
[47:25] compromise
[47:26] with the world i mean i mean then it's
[47:29] losing ground it's taking back
[47:31] what we need tonight is soldiers to
[47:33] possess every divine promise of this
[47:36] bible
[47:36] that god promised to the church whole
[47:39] armor of god
[47:41] and to stand can you say amen with the
[47:43] whole armor of god
[47:46] as brother andrew said wednesday night
[47:48] we are we are contenders of the faith
[47:51] that was delivered to the saints one
[47:53] scripture says they withdraw from the
[47:55] faith but otherwise says we contend for
[47:57] the faith
[47:57] there's millions of people withdrawing
[47:59] from the original faith but this bride
[48:01] of christ
[48:02] will not withdraw shall contend for it
[48:04] i'm holding on to it i've got my armor
[48:06] on
[48:07] i'm taking hold every promise of god
[48:09] people are trying to take them away from
[48:11] me
[48:11] but i'm holding on to the promises of
[48:13] god i stand
[48:14] on his promises i'm standing on his
[48:18] promises
[48:19] one by one can you say amen and i love
[48:22] that because he says we can't compromise
[48:23] on the world
[48:25] with the world we can't compromise with
[48:26] the word and we can't compromise with
[48:28] creeds and dogmas
[48:30] so many influences that cause us to
[48:31] compromise but if we remove those
[48:34] compromises
[48:35] we're left with the promise of god to
[48:37] embrace
[48:38] to hold and to say every promise
[48:41] in the book is mine
[48:46] next sunday the next two sundays
[48:47] probably is looking like now more and
[48:49] more and i can guarantee you
[48:50] it's going to get even more practical
[48:52] than it got today
[48:53] i'm a rubber meets the road preacher how
[48:56] many in my congregation would raise your
[48:57] hand say that's true
[48:59] so close to the road i don't even like
[49:00] it sometimes
[49:02] but we're going to get down to the
[49:04] nitty-gritty some more because it does
[49:06] no good to just preach way up here in
[49:07] the mysteries of god
[49:09] if we don't get down where we're living
[49:10] at and find what's in between you my
[49:12] brother and sister
[49:14] and the full promise of god just on the
[49:17] other side of jordan
[49:18] is all the promises of god and they
[49:20] belong to you they don't belong to the
[49:22] world
[49:23] they belong to you why aren't you taking
[49:25] them why aren't you saying lord
[49:27] every promise in the book is mine
[49:32] every chapter every verse every line
[49:36] and i am trusting in his love divine
[49:41] every promise in the book it can get
