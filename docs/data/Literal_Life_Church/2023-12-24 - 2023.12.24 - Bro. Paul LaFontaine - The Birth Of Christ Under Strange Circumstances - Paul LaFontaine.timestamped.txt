[28:05] amen praise the lord we invite your
[28:09] attention to Matthew chapter 1 this
[28:10] morning in your
[28:12] Bibles Matthew chapter 1 and I'd like to
[28:15] speak on the birth of Christ under
[28:17] strange
[28:19] circumstances and this was given to me 3
[28:22] or 4 days ago in my morning devotion as
[28:24] I was reading the scripture and I trust
[28:26] it'll be a blessing to you
[28:28] and that
[28:29] we be filled with more of his Spirit
[28:32] refilled with his
[28:34] Spirit we come to know him in a deeper
[28:36] way praise the
[28:39] Lord I have some announcements just I'm
[28:42] just going to leave them to the end
[28:44] today Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 now
[28:47] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[28:50] wise when as his mother Mary was espouse
[28:53] to Joseph before they came together she
[28:55] was found with child of the Holy Ghost
[28:58] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[29:01] and not willing to make her a public
[29:03] example was minded to put her away
[29:06] privately but while he thought on these
[29:09] things behold the angel of the Lord
[29:12] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[29:13] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[29:16] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[29:19] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[29:22] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[29:25] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[29:27] he shall save his people from their sins
[29:31] now all this was done that it might be
[29:34] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[29:37] by the prophet saying Behold a virgin
[29:40] shall be with child and shall bring
[29:43] forth a son and they shall call his name
[29:47] Emmanuel which being interpreted is god
[29:50] with us then Joseph being raised from
[29:53] sleep did as the angel of the Lord had
[29:56] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[30:00] and knew her not till she had brought
[30:02] forth her firstborn son and he called
[30:05] his name Jesus our heavenly father we
[30:08] pray Lord as we've gathered this morning
[30:11] that you will bless your word Lord the
[30:14] song that brother Gideon sang this
[30:17] morning Lord that we're rich in faith
[30:19] and hope and love I stand here this
[30:22] morning and I know many of the people
[30:24] can identify and agree that we are a
[30:26] very blessed people we are very rich
[30:30] people Lord we may not be rich in these
[30:33] Earthly goods and Lord there might be
[30:35] different ones in the congregation Lord
[30:37] trying to make ends meet and things but
[30:39] Lord we are so wealthy when it comes to
[30:41] the Revelation and the the things you
[30:44] have done to touch our hearts and change
[30:46] our lives we are a rich people so Lord
[30:49] we can only reach back on this this
[30:51] Christmas Eve and just worship you and
[30:54] express our hearts to you and sing to
[30:56] the top of our our voices Lord let it be
[30:58] just a little incense that would rise to
[31:01] you this morning that you know Lord that
[31:03] you are loved and that you are
[31:04] appreciated and that you're adored and
[31:07] Lord that you're worshiped this morning
[31:08] from the depths of our heart we're so
[31:11] thankful father we're so blessed and
[31:14] Lord one of the things that we enjoy as
[31:16] a Believer is that we might have many
[31:19] things that's happened in the past to us
[31:21] but Lord today we know that we can look
[31:24] with hope and with Joy To The Future
[31:27] because we have our future in your hands
[31:31] and Lord when we held on to you at the
[31:33] beginning you will hold on to us at the
[31:35] end Lord Jesus I anchor that that this
[31:38] morning as that lyric has ministered to
[31:40] me and now this little message that You'
[31:42] given me for the people may it minister
[31:45] to them may we grow we pray father in
[31:47] Grace and knowledge of Christ as we
[31:50] commit this service to you in Jesus name
[31:53] amen I bless you may be seated this
[31:56] morning
[31:59] praise the
[32:00] Lord I'm just going to work my way a
[32:03] little bit through the scriptures here
[32:04] this morning and as I said I want to
[32:07] speak on the birth of Christ under
[32:09] strange circumstances and when it worded
[32:12] it this way when it said the birth of
[32:15] Jesus Christ was on this wise the
[32:18] Amplified says there the birth took
[32:21] place under these type of circumstances
[32:23] and when I was reading it the other day
[32:25] I realized that the that his birth took
[32:28] place was kind of a strange setting and
[32:31] that's why I've titled that this morning
[32:32] the birth of Christ under strange
[32:34] circumstances because the circumstances
[32:37] and the setting and what took place and
[32:39] how it took place was uh from the carnal
[32:43] mind a pretty troubling type of setting
[32:45] it was a pretty strange setting and as a
[32:49] matter of fact we wouldn't believe that
[32:50] God would be doing something as great as
[32:52] send coming himself and connecting with
[32:55] us as God he would do as it says in the
[32:59] scripture for the purpose of saving his
[33:01] people from their sins I'll tell you
[33:04] that's a pretty big condescension that's
[33:06] a pretty big moment that's happening
[33:08] right here that he's beginning the
[33:10] process of saving his people from their
[33:13] sins how many know that you're a sinner
[33:16] this morning we're all Sinners without
[33:18] hope without Christ coming can you say
[33:21] amen I I praise uh Franklin Graham as I
[33:25] was reading yesterday and he was uh
[33:27] addressing the Pope's new uh new thing
[33:30] to that the priest can bless uh uh
[33:33] homosexual marriage and everything they
[33:34] can bring a blessing they don't have to
[33:36] line up with the word but they can bless
[33:37] it and Franklin Graham basically said
[33:40] listen we're all Sinners and we all need
[33:42] Christ and even the pope is a
[33:46] centner woo is he ever going to get in
[33:48] trouble for that but the man spoke truth
[33:51] and he says I don't know what he's doing
[33:52] it's going to bring all kinds of
[33:54] confusion he said but we when we all
[33:56] come before God we're going to need the
[33:57] blood of Jesus Christ else we come under
[34:00] judgment for our sin and he told it
[34:02] straight can you say Amen so this is a
[34:04] very amazing spot of Prophecy to be
[34:07] fulfilled it's one of the greatest uh
[34:09] places of Prophecy to be fulfilled that
[34:12] it's called Emmanuel this would be God
[34:14] with us this would be so significant
[34:16] it's God With Us it's God condescending
[34:20] to us and we know he came in a little
[34:21] baby at first and began life that way
[34:24] but it was actually God condescending to
[34:26] us
[34:27] it was God coming and connecting with us
[34:30] it was it was the birth of the king not
[34:33] a king it was the birth of the ultimate
[34:37] King and and and yet it's in shrouded
[34:40] it's it's it's surrounded and clouded as
[34:42] if I could say that the whole greatest
[34:45] thing of the birth of Christ was clouded
[34:48] by very strange
[34:51] circumstances and in fact I can safely
[34:53] say that that it this this um this
[34:57] situation that Christ was born in was
[34:59] actually out of sync completely with the
[35:02] normal thought patterns of the world and
[35:06] also I want to emphasize this he came
[35:09] out of sync with the normal thought
[35:11] patterns of the religious
[35:15] organizations completely contrary to the
[35:18] way they thought he would come because
[35:19] even their minds in relig religious
[35:22] denominations and organization even
[35:25] their minds although they were worship
[35:26] Shing God their minds had be become
[35:29] Twisted by their Creeds and their dogmas
[35:32] that they weren't looking at God
[35:34] correctly they didn't see God right so
[35:36] when he slipped in in Simplicity and
[35:38] enshrouded with kind of a a situation
[35:41] that was very very strange and looked
[35:43] ungodly when God came in that they were
[35:46] so messed up in the way they thought
[35:48] about God is that they couldn't
[35:51] understand why God would do
[35:54] this and so uh because it was against
[35:58] the thought patterns and the normal
[35:59] thought patterns it seems that it's a
[36:01] strange circumstances and the carnal
[36:03] mind the carnal mind would never see
[36:06] this never understand this if they seen
[36:08] God behind this it would take a
[36:10] revelation to see God behind the
[36:13] circumstances can you say
[36:15] Amen so you can really say it this way
[36:18] to make it understandable this wonderful
[36:20] Jewish believing couple believed in
[36:22] Jehovah God this wonderful Jewish
[36:25] believing couple Joseph Mary fell in
[36:27] love and they got
[36:30] engaged it sounds good so
[36:33] far this wonderful Jewish believing
[36:36] couple Joseph and Mary fell in love and
[36:38] got engaged and then she turns up
[36:40] pregnant before they got
[36:44] married said she turns up pregnant
[36:46] before they got married and they hadn't
[36:48] been together yet to have a child
[36:50] they're only engaged a spouse to one
[36:52] another the final marriage hadn't taken
[36:54] place and they were not together yet and
[36:56] and she turns up
[36:59] pregnant so you could easily you could
[37:01] really say that this is circumstances
[37:04] that are very very strange for God to be
[37:06] born in and come in his kingdom and
[37:09] first of all It Don't Fit with how God
[37:12] in our minds would do things remember
[37:15] how many believe it this morning
[37:16] remember God is a righteous God he is
[37:20] righteous he's the ultimate of righteous
[37:22] he's where we get righteousness
[37:24] from how many believe God is righteous
[37:27] how many believe he's the only one
[37:29] that's righteous and so we know that and
[37:32] most people go we know God is righteous
[37:34] and it don't seem like God like his
[37:37] nature to reveal and to bring his
[37:41] righteousness to us with circumstances
[37:44] that did not look righteous at
[37:47] all and when you take the laws of God
[37:50] and the things that we're still today
[37:52] teaching young people about uh saving
[37:54] sex before marriage and saving that
[37:56] honor for the marriage day and all these
[37:58] things that were taught to the Jews in
[38:00] the Old Testament we still teach today
[38:02] even in 2023 because there are God's
[38:04] principles they're God's laws and they
[38:06] are true can you say amen and they still
[38:09] apply to the human being can you say
[38:11] Amen so this is what Joseph and Mary
[38:14] believe this is what Mary's parents
[38:16] believe this is what the churches still
[38:17] held on to as a matter of fact the law
[38:19] they held on to so long if somebody
[38:21] committed adultery then they held to the
[38:23] Old Law that they had to be stoned they
[38:25] actually had to be stoned if they broke
[38:27] that and were found pregnant before the
[38:29] marriage so now this is what happens and
[38:32] so the carnal mind could never look at
[38:35] what's happening and see God behind
[38:38] it I'm just stopping for a minute and
[38:40] I'm saying why Lord why Lord did you do
[38:43] it this way and I don't even have all
[38:46] the answers because I don't understand
[38:48] all of God but I know I can look through
[38:51] the Bible and see a pattern of him when
[38:54] he comes he reveals himself in
[38:58] Simplicity and also he comes and he's
[39:01] working in a in in a thing that if we
[39:04] looked at it from our eyes carnally we
[39:07] wouldn't find God in
[39:11] it why don't I just jump to you on why
[39:15] don't I talk about you when you're
[39:18] living in sin and when you're out there
[39:19] and then God begins to work in your life
[39:21] and you still got habits and different
[39:23] things but God's being to beginning to
[39:25] work and nobody knows what what's
[39:26] happening it's a good thing God didn't
[39:28] judge you right there it's a good thing
[39:30] he could look inside and see the seat of
[39:32] God within you it's a good thing that
[39:35] somebody could look beyond what was
[39:37] happening in your
[39:39] circumstances I'm preaching to you today
[39:41] we have to look past the circumstances
[39:44] that surround our life and we have to be
[39:46] looking for the god that's trying to
[39:49] reveal
[39:50] himself L we miss god brother Paul I've
[39:54] had some trouble this year that I never
[39:56] dreamed what happen in my family
[39:58] domestic life whatever has happened I've
[40:00] had some things you wouldn't dream it's
[40:02] unprecedented well it's not
[40:03] unprecedented it's probably happened
[40:05] before but you think it's unprecedented
[40:07] but when you look at it with from the
[40:09] carnal eyes and the embarrassment of
[40:11] everything everybody else that sees your
[40:12] life you can only be looking at your
[40:14] circumstances but there's only one
[40:16] answer from the message that we're to
[40:17] look at in circumstances we are not to
[40:20] bow to our circumstances we are not to
[40:22] read read the wrong thing into our
[40:24] circumstances we're actually supposed to
[40:26] embrace our particular circumstances
[40:28] because we know that in those things God
[40:32] can be revealing
[40:37] himself if I have any lesson for the
[40:39] church this year this is my this is my
[40:43] New Year's
[40:44] revelation we better stop looking at the
[40:47] outside and the surface we better start
[40:50] looking for God to be revealing yourself
[40:52] I'm looking for
[40:53] God where is he trying to reveal himself
[40:58] is everybody with
[40:59] me because you can judge matters and
[41:02] think you got it right and you're
[41:03] completely wrong you can judge another
[41:06] person by even how they would act or
[41:08] dress sometimes and you can judge it
[41:10] completely
[41:12] wrong we have to grow up and not judge
[41:14] things by the flesh Paul said we know no
[41:17] man after the flesh including Jesus
[41:20] Christ he says I know we knew him after
[41:22] the flesh he lived here for 30 but we
[41:25] can't even know Jesus
[41:26] after the flesh we have to know him by
[41:29] this Elohim this being this Christ that
[41:31] comes into our
[41:33] lives but we can't know any man after
[41:35] the Flesh and so now we find then that
[41:39] first of all you don't see God that
[41:40] would fit into these things because he's
[41:42] a righteous God I'm going to get into
[41:44] that a little bit more in a minute what
[41:45] righteousness really is it don't seem
[41:47] like God would reveal himself and bring
[41:49] his righteousness in circumstances that
[41:52] were not righteous at all and yet we
[41:54] know from 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[41:57] 27 it expresses to us that God will
[42:00] stumble conventional wisdom and will
[42:02] hide himself in base things this is the
[42:04] way it's worded 1 Corinthians uh 1:27
[42:07] but God ha chosen the foolish things of
[42:10] the world to confound the wise and God
[42:13] had chosen the weak things of the world
[42:16] to confound the things which are Mighty
[42:19] and base things of the world and things
[42:21] which are despised hath God chosen yay
[42:25] and the things which are not to bring to
[42:28] not things that are that no flesh could
[42:33] glory in his
[42:36] presence God's got an
[42:38] agenda God's going to make the world
[42:41] look stupid one
[42:42] day come on can you say amen God is
[42:46] going to confound the wise God he's
[42:48] already done it he'll do it again that
[42:50] someday they're going to say there is no
[42:52] way that God sent his last day's message
[42:55] through a package like this there's no
[42:57] way you can do it but God's going to
[42:58] confound all the wisdoms of every
[43:01] University of every Seminary of every
[43:05] God is going to make them look stupid
[43:07] when he shows that's exactly what I was
[43:10] doing in the end time and you missed
[43:12] [Applause]
[43:15] me so we know by 1 Corinthians 1 that's
[43:18] God's nature to do that so it's not like
[43:21] God in our own minds to do things this
[43:23] way and then through the eyes of
[43:26] everyone around Mary and Joseph think
[43:28] about it now when this happens and she
[43:31] comes to her mom and dad and says I'm
[43:34] pregnant you know uh Through The Eyes of
[43:37] everyone Mary's parents Joseph Mary the
[43:42] church that was around them would who
[43:43] would eventually hear you know word bad
[43:47] uh negative travels faster than
[43:52] positive oh
[43:54] yes and
[43:56] so uh everyone's going to know about it
[43:59] and through the Through The Eyes this
[44:02] all looks very very bad and also it
[44:05] looks embarrassing one of the Traditions
[44:08] that we have and I've told you before we
[44:10] we watch during Christmas time I don't
[44:11] know if it be tonight or tomorrow we
[44:13] watch a movie it's called The Nativity
[44:16] Story please don't tell the whole world
[44:18] we watch a movie but if anybody hears
[44:21] it's a movie about it's one of the best
[44:22] movies about the birth birth of Christ
[44:24] and how Mary went through all those
[44:26] Transitions and so we watch it every
[44:28] year and uh I love it because it's so
[44:31] real in some places a lot of the you
[44:34] know the the movies of Christ are just
[44:36] really glossed over and a bit too
[44:38] Orthodox and even the music is orthodox
[44:41] but this one they're really real and and
[44:43] so when when Mary and Joseph's parents
[44:46] and I can't remember completely I should
[44:47] remember it because we watch it every
[44:49] year but I can't remember what Happ was
[44:50] but I know the tension and I know Mary's
[44:53] dad he became he didn't know what to do
[44:55] when he heard this she's sitting there
[44:57] by herself saying the angel told her
[44:59] this and their spouse he's encouraged
[45:02] this engagement with Joseph and Mary
[45:04] he's real proud because he's got a
[45:05] business and he's watching out for his
[45:07] daughter he's got a good Mary was a
[45:09] little reluctant in the movie to to go
[45:10] with him but they you know they
[45:12] eventually fell in love and so now this
[45:14] whole he's very happy why is the Daddy
[45:16] happy this is going to be a normal thing
[45:18] I got somebody to take care of my
[45:19] daughter this a normal life and then the
[45:21] girl his daughter comes and says I'm
[45:24] pregnant
[45:28] what
[45:31] what and it's just you see the tension
[45:34] mared Mar he's he's you know he's pacing
[45:36] the floor and then he looks at Joseph
[45:39] and Joseph's
[45:41] going because in something like this
[45:43] you're trying to find somebody to blame
[45:45] you're trying to find what's going on
[45:47] this is interrupting the whole plan the
[45:50] whole normal let me tell you something
[45:52] God will interrupt your plan
[45:59] you people that are control
[46:01] freaks get ready for a lesson if you
[46:04] come close to God God's going to show
[46:06] you you're not in control of life you're
[46:08] not in control of your
[46:11] family and so Mary's dad felt that's
[46:14] this is all in the bag everything is
[46:15] normal and she turns up pregnant and so
[46:18] now the people are going to hear with
[46:20] everybody who looks from that point on
[46:22] this whole thing is going to be
[46:23] embarrassing it's going to be looked
[46:25] down on and yet in the middle of this is
[46:28] what God's doing to bring his kingdom to
[46:30] the world to the
[46:32] earth I don't understand all
[46:35] that I don't understand some of the
[46:37] people that are sitting here this
[46:39] morning I don't understand some of you
[46:41] you shouldn't be here in church with
[46:43] your family worshiping the way that
[46:46] you're
[46:47] worshiping everything in the carnal mind
[46:50] says no not you when you look at when
[46:52] I'm looking over your lives and seeing
[46:55] some of you shouldn't be here some of
[46:57] you come up under a real strict
[46:58] background and so sometimes that
[47:00] strictness makes you distant towards God
[47:03] and you're hesitant towards God because
[47:04] you come up in a legalistic background
[47:06] but some didn't we got some drug addicts
[47:08] here we got some people that slept
[47:09] around we got some people you're sitting
[47:11] next to you that weren't
[47:16] perfect we got a deacon here with a lot
[47:18] of facial
[47:20] hair that you've heard his testimony of
[47:23] what he came from there isn't anything
[47:25] our caral minds and say this young man
[47:27] and his family should be sitting here
[47:29] filled with the spirit of God there
[47:31] isn't anything that says it but I'm
[47:33] telling you why we looked and maybe
[47:35] could judge God was doing something in
[47:38] his life is Lindsay's
[47:41] life and if we' have been too quick to
[47:43] judge and if you do that one we got all
[47:45] kinds of testimonies here this morning
[47:47] you shouldn't be here and that's why we
[47:49] have to mature and grow and not judge
[47:51] things by the outside
[47:53] appearance because the circumstances can
[47:56] look very very
[48:00] unrighteous and God's trying to birth
[48:03] true
[48:05] righteousness can I get a witness this
[48:08] morning when God's trying to birth true
[48:12] righteousness in us and I'll get to this
[48:14] in a minute he may have to purge
[48:21] self-righteousness even people in the
[48:24] message who have become self-righteous
[48:27] they got it all figure out they know
[48:30] everything they got everybody figured
[48:32] out there's a stage that Christians go
[48:35] through many go through depending on
[48:36] their personality they go through a
[48:37] legalistic stage so they get Sanctified
[48:40] sometimes they're just Sanctified don't
[48:41] have the Holy Ghost yet but boy they're
[48:43] really on a campaign now purging their
[48:45] life from everything they're going to
[48:46] cleanse everything and they're going to
[48:48] make sure everybody else cleanses their
[48:49] life then they become critical and
[48:50] legalistic towards other people their
[48:52] daughter's not dressing right their
[48:53] son's not dressing right they become
[48:55] critical because they're going through a
[48:56] stage in their life that everything is
[48:58] only through their eyes righteousness is
[49:00] through their
[49:01] eyes and they see those quotes and they
[49:03] jump onto them but they become real
[49:05] Pharisees with them because they're
[49:06] apply them to everybody else nobody's
[49:08] Measuring Up nobody's really living as
[49:10] close to God as they
[49:12] are I didn't expect it's not in my notes
[49:14] I'm saying it
[49:16] anyway and God if they're a Son of God
[49:19] God will have to deal with that man in
[49:21] such a deep way to show him how filthy
[49:24] his righteous really is and God did not
[49:28] send us a message so that we can enhance
[49:31] our own righteousness God sent us a
[49:33] revelation of his atonement that we
[49:35] don't need any of our righteousness we
[49:38] need the righteousness of
[49:40] God can I get a witness this
[49:43] morning yeah it's just a stage and you
[49:45] just let them go through it and if
[49:47] they're a Son of God but you see when it
[49:49] all looks bad you know when things look
[49:51] bad in the circumstances and and there's
[49:54] a maybe even a a a just a a shadow over
[49:57] this whole thing how do you convince
[49:59] anyone in this world that this word is
[50:02] right this word the words being
[50:03] fulfilled in the last days this is God
[50:06] coming to us how do you witness to
[50:08] someone that this is the word of the
[50:09] hour and this is the message when it
[50:12] comes in this kind of
[50:15] package it's a hard
[50:19] sell it was a hard sell for Mary but she
[50:22] kept holding on to she said listen the
[50:24] angel of the Lord spoke to me and I
[50:27] don't care if the highest priest in
[50:29] Jerusalem says I'm a liar I know that
[50:34] his word is being born in me and
[50:38] birth I don't care if the greatest
[50:40] theologians in Jerusalem can dispel this
[50:43] and but I'm saying the word he spoke to
[50:46] me I know this true and I'm ready to
[50:48] bear this message I'm ready to Bear the
[50:51] reproach that goes with it I'm ready to
[50:53] Bear articles and and news articles and
[50:56] interviews and things that's taken place
[50:58] more and more against the last day's
[51:00] message I'm ready to Bear the reproach
[51:02] of it because it's not about figuring
[51:05] this message out with my mind it's about
[51:07] what he's done in my heart somebody say
[51:09] praise the
[51:12] Lord hallelujah and when it all looks
[51:16] bad then it's a hard witness sometimes
[51:19] but we keep on witnessing we keep saying
[51:21] it's the
[51:22] truth hallelujah huj
[51:26] it's easy for us today to believe this
[51:28] was Emanuel 2,000 years ago it's easy
[51:31] for us to believe because we see he was
[51:33] birthed we see that he grew up we see he
[51:36] had Miracles and signs and wonders
[51:37] there's no man like this in the face of
[51:39] the Earth that's lived for 33 years then
[51:41] we see it all end in a death burial and
[51:44] a resurrection his he has an empty tomb
[51:46] so now it's easy for us to say today
[51:49] that this was Emanuel but back when he
[51:52] was being born nobody could identify and
[51:55] say there's no way that Emanuel God With
[51:57] Us is happening in these
[52:01] circumstances everybody can say it today
[52:03] a matter of fact you can have
[52:04] unbelievers singing carols with you
[52:07] about Emanuel God With Us they sing
[52:09] right along with you outright
[52:11] unbelievers will join in the carolling
[52:14] and join in the songs this powerful
[52:16] birth of the Son of God and God came to
[52:18] us and you know sometimes atheists will
[52:20] just join right
[52:23] in and maybe it better than
[52:28] you after seeing all that Jesus did in
[52:30] his life most will say it's God now but
[52:33] in that hour the circumstances around it
[52:35] would have you very confused that can't
[52:37] be God that can't be God working it's
[52:40] just not the way that God would do it
[52:41] and verse 19 speaks of Joseph now I want
[52:44] you to start bringing this out verse 19
[52:46] Matthew 1:19 then after we they all find
[52:49] out about the pregnancy then we find out
[52:51] verse 19 then Joseph her husband being a
[52:53] just man and not willing to make make
[52:55] her a public example was minded to put
[52:57] her away privately so now here's the
[52:59] next thing I want to show that we can do
[53:01] sometimes is that when you have
[53:03] something embarrassing take place and
[53:05] and and and and you have something even
[53:07] in your own life a mistake or whatever
[53:09] and you have something Tak place we're
[53:11] always trying to what can we do in our
[53:13] minds to cover this up what can we do to
[53:15] fix this how can we minimize the
[53:19] gossip is anybody listening this
[53:22] morning how can we and so Joseph and and
[53:26] Mary's dad is in this mode of trying to
[53:29] to to to to get something together here
[53:32] to keep this private because it's
[53:34] embarrassing to the
[53:35] family what do we do here why can't we
[53:38] do this and and and so so the thoughts
[53:41] and this is when circumstances happen in
[53:43] our lives that are not pleasant that are
[53:45] negative the first thing we engage in is
[53:48] our mind and our thought life to try to
[53:50] figure out how to fix it try to hide it
[53:53] because no human being likes to be
[53:54] embarrassed
[53:56] we all like to
[53:58] appear good to everybody
[54:02] else and so when something happens when
[54:04] your testimony something's going to go
[54:06] out that you're not uh uh coming out
[54:08] smelling like a rose we will do things
[54:11] on our mind to try to private and he
[54:13] says he's a just man I think it was very
[54:14] honorable I've preached that to young
[54:16] people this was an honorable man because
[54:18] he's thinking of Mary and all that's
[54:20] going to go around about her so he's
[54:21] thinking I'll just go ahead and start
[54:23] start the divorce proceedings even
[54:25] before we're technically married and
[54:26] we'll keep this as private as we can and
[54:28] we'll do this that and the other and so
[54:30] that was all fine that was all fine that
[54:32] was just but that wasn't God's
[54:35] plan and because Joseph was going to act
[54:38] upon this and not marry her the angel of
[54:40] the Lord had to step in like he has to
[54:43] step in with your life sometimes when
[54:46] your mind has figured everything out and
[54:48] you're going to do it this way to cover
[54:50] for yourself the angel of the Lord May
[54:53] step into your life and say no no you're
[54:55] not going to do that because what you
[54:57] don't see is what's happening is the
[54:59] word is being fulfilled in your
[55:02] life how many would raise your hand and
[55:04] say I thank God for his grace in my life
[55:07] that he sends his angels his Messengers
[55:10] his 5-4 ministry and when I was about
[55:13] ready to act upon foolishness and act
[55:16] upon something that I thought was right
[55:18] the angel of the Lord over the pulpit
[55:20] stood and said don't do that stop sit
[55:23] still watch I was looking for a quote
[55:25] last night I was looking cuz there's
[55:27] some situation where that I can't
[55:29] remember who it was maybe it was just a
[55:31] few months ago but it's just like sit
[55:33] still God's doing something sit still
[55:36] God's doing something don't act too
[55:37] quickly cuz God's doing something and
[55:40] that's the way we got to be in maturity
[55:42] we got to be careful that we don't act
[55:43] too quickly with this can I get an amen
[55:46] this morning we got to be careful that
[55:48] we don't act too quickly when our
[55:50] circumstances make us embarrassed and we
[55:52] got to do something about it maybe sit
[55:54] still
[55:55] God might be doing something sit still
[55:58] and see the glory of God stand still and
[56:00] see the glory of
[56:03] God we act upon our own carnal Minds
[56:06] because sometimes of the embarrassment
[56:09] of what it's going to look like to
[56:10] everybody else and this is the mode that
[56:12] Joseph was in and he's a man of honor
[56:14] and respect to help cover for Mary he
[56:17] sets out to do a private divorce really
[56:19] thinking to think through all this and
[56:20] figure out a plan we do that in our
[56:22] circumstances trying to figure out our
[56:24] ourselves the best way we can do things
[56:27] because it makes us nervous when
[56:29] something happens out of the normal is
[56:31] anybody
[56:33] listening it makes us nervous when
[56:35] something happens out of the normal it's
[56:38] going to look bad to everyone else it's
[56:40] going to make you look bad and human
[56:41] beings do not like looking bad often
[56:44] human beings do not look they don't like
[56:46] looking bad and often they deflect
[56:48] attention to someone else by gossiping
[56:51] and putting another one down people
[56:53] criticize to make them themselves look
[56:57] better but human because human being
[56:59] beings don't like to be uh to be looked
[57:03] at in a way that would embarrass
[57:06] them and human beings don't like
[57:09] criticism I don't like criticism I'm a
[57:11] human
[57:12] being it's all together important how we
[57:15] react to
[57:17] criticism had an older Minister tell me
[57:19] one time we might as well accept the
[57:22] fact we will be criticized
[57:25] I as a pastor will be criticized but I
[57:29] must choose what I'm criticized
[57:33] for and if I'm criticized for preaching
[57:36] the balance of God's word with all my
[57:38] heart if I make a mistake I believe God
[57:40] will correct me but if I am criticized
[57:43] for striving for a balance to preach the
[57:45] full counsel of this message let that
[57:47] criticism come I embrace it because I'm
[57:49] going to stay with that
[57:52] balance my my my point is to you this
[57:55] morning is we step into action quickly
[57:58] sometimes to deal with
[57:59] situations and is amazing what we do to
[58:02] cover up our shame and our embarrassment
[58:04] so that we can look righteous and holy
[58:06] in front of everybody life dishes out
[58:08] some abnormal things and we want to
[58:11] appear normal we want to appear good to
[58:15] everyone this mindset is
[58:18] flawed that's
[58:21] right this action and effort to
[58:26] make ourselves look good to everybody is
[58:33] flawed because it's trying to work it
[58:36] out ourselves it's trying to make us
[58:38] appear right to others but the main
[58:40] reason it's f is it might be against
[58:44] what God is really trying to
[58:47] do God may be trying to reveal his true
[58:50] righteousness and you are trying to
[58:51] maintain your own
[58:53] righteousness why not stop and watch
[58:55] what God is
[58:58] doing let me talk about righteousness
[59:00] for a minute human beings have had not
[59:03] not had not had human beings have not
[59:06] had a good success interpreting the
[59:10] righteousness of
[59:12] God we're talking 6,000
[59:16] years human beings do not have a good
[59:20] success rate at interpreting what the
[59:23] righteousness of God
[59:25] really
[59:27] is even after Moses brought the law
[59:30] which was from
[59:32] God they took it and they made it
[59:35] something else and then 400 years before
[59:37] Jesus that we developed these Pharisees
[59:40] and Sadducees that were believe the law
[59:42] but they actually took the law and added
[59:44] to it and added some things to it that
[59:46] weren't actually in there but it was
[59:48] there interpretation of the law and so
[59:50] now it by the time Jesus got here to
[59:53] come they're so rapid up in the law
[59:56] being the righteousness of God if you do
[59:59] the law and if you do it right and if
[1:00:02] you do it perfect you have God's
[1:00:04] righteousness and I'm here to tell you
[1:00:06] scripturally the law is not the
[1:00:09] righteousness of
[1:00:11] God news flash I'm getting ready to read
[1:00:15] some scriptures in Romans that Paul had
[1:00:17] to separate the law from the
[1:00:20] righteousness of God he's the one that
[1:00:21] used the term the righteousness of God
[1:00:23] the righteousness of God and he
[1:00:25] separates us say the law is not the
[1:00:27] righteousness of God cuz if that were
[1:00:28] true we didn't need
[1:00:31] Calvary we didn't need the Son of God to
[1:00:33] become and die for our sins can you say
[1:00:35] Amen because we already had enough
[1:00:36] righteousness to be acceptable to God
[1:00:39] but if we just did the law if we did the
[1:00:40] law we'll be fine the righteousness of
[1:00:43] God is not the law of
[1:00:51] God and so human beings they judge by
[1:00:55] the surface they judge by what's on the
[1:00:57] outside they take the fruits of the law
[1:01:00] and the fruits excuse me the fruits of
[1:01:01] righteousness and say that's righteous
[1:01:03] so now you do have the fruits of
[1:01:04] righteousness because there's a
[1:01:06] scripture
[1:01:07] in uh Philippians 1:1 that says being
[1:01:12] filled with the fruits of righteousness
[1:01:14] so there are fruits that come from his
[1:01:17] righteousness but the fruits are not the
[1:01:20] actual
[1:01:21] righteousness they're only the fruits of
[1:01:24] righteousness
[1:01:26] denomination makes the
[1:01:28] fruits the actual
[1:01:31] righteousness that's scary because we
[1:01:33] could have manifested all the fruits and
[1:01:36] put them on and do them and if you honor
[1:01:39] God's word and you do it praise the Lord
[1:01:41] God will honor you that's a wonderful
[1:01:43] thing but don't ever say that you're
[1:01:45] righteous before God because you do the
[1:01:47] law that's a twisting of man the
[1:01:50] righteousness of God is much deeper than
[1:01:53] just doing the law
[1:01:55] it's it's the person of righteousness
[1:01:59] it's him can you say Amen he's the only
[1:02:01] one there's you know the the Rich Young
[1:02:04] Ruler come to Jesus and said good master
[1:02:06] and he corrected him right away he said
[1:02:09] good he said there's none good but God
[1:02:12] he's correcting because he's getting
[1:02:14] ready to judge the Commandments and his
[1:02:16] acceptance of eternal life he's getting
[1:02:18] ready to judge it by what can I do more
[1:02:21] to get eternal life what can I do more
[1:02:23] and he says have you followed the law he
[1:02:25] says yeah I've done this since I was a
[1:02:27] kid I've done all that and I still don't
[1:02:28] have eternal life but the first thing
[1:02:31] Jesus had to say to him was to say don't
[1:02:33] call me good there's none good but God a
[1:02:37] foundational thing that you need to know
[1:02:39] before you can properly come to the
[1:02:41] righteousness of God is to say there is
[1:02:44] no one righteous except
[1:02:51] God there's no one righteous except God
[1:02:55] and if we have it it's because by spirit
[1:02:58] that same God has come in
[1:03:00] us so I'm I'm off my notes here but
[1:03:05] 6,000 years of bad history of human
[1:03:07] beings don't let human me beings don't
[1:03:10] let denominational systems don't let
[1:03:13] theologians and the
[1:03:15] message mess with the righteousness of
[1:03:18] God that's right they never get it
[1:03:23] right now we go back in our Bibles with
[1:03:26] through the road Romans road all have
[1:03:29] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:03:31] God all these the Romans road they call
[1:03:33] it he bring somebody through
[1:03:34] it and then and then Paul goes to
[1:03:38] Abraham reachs back to their their
[1:03:41] father literally he reaches back to
[1:03:43] their father Abraham because their
[1:03:44] lineage we came from Abraham we're
[1:03:46] Abraham's sons okay I'll use
[1:03:49] Abraham and he goes into this teaching
[1:03:51] and he says you know that when God came
[1:03:54] to down and give the word of the Lord to
[1:03:56] Abraham when he believed that word it
[1:03:58] says I'm in it for the long haul I'll
[1:04:00] believe it if I'm 990 years old I'll
[1:04:03] still be believing it I'm going to have
[1:04:04] a son you're going to make me a a man of
[1:04:06] many nations I don't know how it's
[1:04:08] because my wife is Barren but I believe
[1:04:10] it with all my heart I'm in for the Long
[1:04:14] Haul and God's a a credited his account
[1:04:19] Abraham you are
[1:04:23] righteous
[1:04:28] he didn't hear all the other
[1:04:31] quotes the law hadn't come yet now this
[1:04:34] is can you imagine Pharisees just trying
[1:04:36] to figure well wait a minute now how do
[1:04:38] we bring the law with this you know how
[1:04:40] do we do this well don't try to figure
[1:04:41] it all out I'm just telling you that
[1:04:43] before your law came you're making the
[1:04:45] law a righteous person that follows the
[1:04:47] law perfectly but I'm saying your father
[1:04:49] Abraham he didn't know any of the law he
[1:04:51] didn't do any of it yet he didn't know
[1:04:52] the dress code
[1:04:57] and God says I've imputed it unto
[1:04:59] Abraham because you believe this way you
[1:05:02] are righteous before me that's it so
[1:05:06] there's got to be a key here that when
[1:05:08] he sends his true word his spoken word
[1:05:10] of the hour and a heart says like Mary
[1:05:12] be it unto me according to Thy word I'm
[1:05:15] willing to go through the reproach I'm
[1:05:17] willing to be laughed at I don't care
[1:05:19] what the websites say about it I believe
[1:05:21] it with all my
[1:05:23] heart
[1:05:24] Revelation now you're tapping into the
[1:05:27] righteousness of
[1:05:30] God and then we go we make it a dress
[1:05:32] code which listen friends the fruits of
[1:05:35] righteousness will bring
[1:05:38] modesty the fruits of righteousness will
[1:05:41] bring a distinction in a man and woman
[1:05:44] what they're
[1:05:45] wearing the fruits of righteousness will
[1:05:48] bring the fruits of the spirit in your
[1:05:51] life right there is fruits of
[1:05:54] righteousness but you have to have his
[1:05:57] righteousness
[1:06:02] first Hallelujah well I'm enjoying this
[1:06:05] this
[1:06:08] morning we need to hear this because we
[1:06:12] can mess with the righteousness of God
[1:06:16] ourselves we turn it into something and
[1:06:18] this is why the setting of his birth is
[1:06:21] enshrouded or or is is covered up
[1:06:23] because if she comes up pregnant it's
[1:06:25] probably one of the worst things that
[1:06:26] could have happened around the birth of
[1:06:28] Christ for people not to believe that
[1:06:31] there was a supernatural
[1:06:34] conception God has placed it in a way
[1:06:37] that most the people are not going to
[1:06:40] believe because everybody's in a mindset
[1:06:42] if she's pregnant she's been with a man
[1:06:44] that's it that's conventional
[1:06:48] knowledge and yet their Bible said a
[1:06:50] virgin shall
[1:06:52] conceive how did they miss that that
[1:06:55] it's possible a virgin shall conceive
[1:06:57] but they what are they covered over by
[1:06:59] they're covered over by religion they're
[1:07:00] covered over their concept of God
[1:07:02] they're covered over by a a
[1:07:05] righteousness that no you just you stick
[1:07:07] to your game there and you stick to what
[1:07:09] you're supposed to be doing now when all
[1:07:11] this happened it it God I don't know why
[1:07:14] but he allows it to be and probably in
[1:07:16] that day the worst thing for a woman to
[1:07:18] lose her
[1:07:19] virginity it still should be that way
[1:07:22] our girls should value them El you say
[1:07:25] well I made a mistake then get a hold of
[1:07:27] the thing that you will value yourself
[1:07:29] get a hold of God can you say Amen you
[1:07:32] should vow yourself but in that day and
[1:07:33] in this day but in that day today it's
[1:07:35] cheapened today it's it's it's mocked
[1:07:38] today people sleep together they do it
[1:07:40] all the time it's a mess but back in
[1:07:42] that day in the Jewish setting it was
[1:07:44] probably the most thing that's looked
[1:07:46] down upon and it happens in their eyes
[1:07:49] they're never going to see it any other
[1:07:50] way then you try to witness and Mary
[1:07:53] tries to witness
[1:07:55] this is Isaiah being fulfilled in
[1:07:58] me right you're just trying to justify
[1:08:01] yourself you're trying to find an excuse
[1:08:04] for you sleeping
[1:08:06] around or you and Joseph being together
[1:08:09] you're trying to cover this up they're
[1:08:11] never going to receive it because God
[1:08:13] somehow laid it out that
[1:08:17] way and I don't understand all the
[1:08:19] reasons but I do
[1:08:21] know that it's for for a reason it's for
[1:08:25] a reason that
[1:08:28] God God's elect God's
[1:08:31] people could look
[1:08:34] past the
[1:08:38] circumstances can I can I just have you
[1:08:41] drop that truth in you for this coming
[1:08:44] year how many's excited about the coming
[1:08:46] year I so excited about this assembly
[1:08:50] and the the work of God and everything
[1:08:52] that's taking place in the missions but
[1:08:56] spiritually we need to be in a mode of
[1:09:00] looking for God to be manifested in one
[1:09:05] another and don't stumble at the
[1:09:11] circumstances let me finish this about
[1:09:13] the righteousness of God Paul brings it
[1:09:15] in and he says Romans 1:17 for therein
[1:09:20] is the righteousness go of God revealed
[1:09:22] so he's presenting to the Jews to the
[1:09:24] Romans but he's got to separate the
[1:09:26] righteousness of God with the law 117
[1:09:29] for therein is the righteousness of God
[1:09:30] revealed so he says we're just now we're
[1:09:32] just now starting to see what the
[1:09:33] righteousness of God it's just now being
[1:09:35] revealed after Christ's first coming
[1:09:37] Romans
[1:09:38] 3:21 but now the righteousness of God
[1:09:42] without the law is manifested being
[1:09:44] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[1:09:45] say I'm going to read it again now Paul
[1:09:47] says the righteousness of God without
[1:09:50] the law is being manifested imagine
[1:09:52] Pharisees and Jews saying what they
[1:09:55] never separated the law from
[1:09:59] righteousness now the righteousness of
[1:10:01] God without the law is manifested being
[1:10:02] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[1:10:04] Romans
[1:10:05] 10:3 for they Israel the Jews they the
[1:10:09] Jews being ignorant of God's
[1:10:11] righteousness and going about to
[1:10:13] establish their own
[1:10:16] righteousness have not submitted
[1:10:18] themselves unto the righteousness of
[1:10:22] God you know if we're going about to
[1:10:24] establish our own theories and our own
[1:10:26] righteousness and our own version of the
[1:10:30] word and our own version of the message
[1:10:32] if you're busy doing that you may miss
[1:10:34] the righteousness of God the Jews did it
[1:10:38] Galatians
[1:10:39] 2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God
[1:10:43] for if righteousness come by the law
[1:10:44] then Christ is dead in vain once again
[1:10:47] separating it Philippians
[1:10:50] 3:9 boy you guys are fast and be found
[1:10:53] in in
[1:10:54] him not having my own righteousness
[1:10:58] which is of the law but that which is
[1:11:00] through the Faith of Christ the
[1:11:02] righteousness which is of god by faith I
[1:11:05] love that term the first line and be
[1:11:08] found in him how many this morning want
[1:11:11] to only be found in him and in his
[1:11:15] righteousness not in something you
[1:11:17] smeared on the outside not in putting on
[1:11:19] a show to everybody else but I prayed I
[1:11:21] repented of my sin B AP ized filled with
[1:11:24] the spirit and I want to be found in his
[1:11:27] righteousness not my own that day when I
[1:11:30] go to the other side I want to be found
[1:11:32] in one thing his
[1:11:34] righteousness clothed in his
[1:11:37] righteousness not my own we have to
[1:11:40] separate it right or we could look look
[1:11:42] over what God's doing right now we can
[1:11:45] become blinded by our own righteousness
[1:11:47] it blinds us to the real manifestation
[1:11:49] of God in people's lives sometimes a
[1:11:51] simpler heart sometimes we can be
[1:11:54] blinded and not see God moving among us
[1:11:56] and not see what God is doing because
[1:11:58] we're blinded by our own religion or
[1:12:00] we're blinded by our complicated heart
[1:12:03] and sometimes a simpler heart that
[1:12:05] doesn't know very much catches it and we
[1:12:11] don't
[1:12:13] amen Lord help me not to be blinded by
[1:12:16] my own righteousness Lord help me not to
[1:12:18] be blinded by my own legalistic
[1:12:22] ways
[1:12:24] Lord help me find you I don't want to
[1:12:25] miss you in every service every day we
[1:12:29] should be praying is everybody with me

[1:12:33] right thing God I want to find you in

[1:12:39] life looking for the god moments the god

[1:12:43] throughout the day if you get distracted
[1:12:45] by circumstances you won't you'll miss
[1:12:47] the god moments Lord help me every day
[1:12:50] to catch the god moments when I go to
[1:12:52] church help me catch the god moments
[1:12:54] what are you trying to say to me help me
[1:12:57] not to miss those things I had an email
[1:13:00] this week from the man that sold us this
[1:13:02] church and if you know the story it was
[1:13:04] Supernatural all the way through how we
[1:13:06] got this building every building that we
[1:13:08] got has been Supernatural but then once
[1:13:10] again he he He blesses this and we we
[1:13:13] had a need we didn't have a lot of money
[1:13:16] and so you know the story uh we seen the
[1:13:19] building and it was already sold going
[1:13:21] to closing it was a Christian man who
[1:13:22] wanted to bring his business in here and
[1:13:24] change it the neighbors didn't want it
[1:13:25] he had to fight to get the zoning
[1:13:27] changed eventually he won and he was
[1:13:29] getting ready to go to closing we seen
[1:13:31] the building and then once we seen it my
[1:13:35] dad said that's the building for you my
[1:13:37] wife was saying hey she's the one that
[1:13:39] said we should look for buildings
[1:13:40] besides building on the other lot she
[1:13:42] said and a deacon I can't remember
[1:13:43] brother Jim or one of the deacons said
[1:13:45] why don't we look for other buildings I
[1:13:46] said no no no I want to BU I want to
[1:13:47] stay there I like it and so my
[1:13:49] stubbornness
[1:13:52] was don't
[1:13:54] left my stubborn was is just going to be
[1:13:56] this way it's the normal we're settled
[1:13:58] here on Whiteford Road this is you know
[1:14:00] that you know and God had this in mind
[1:14:02] that's
[1:14:04] right and uh you know little did some of
[1:14:08] you know uh Becca grabbed sister
[1:14:12] inz and come over here in the in the
[1:14:14] winter in February the gate was closed
[1:14:18] she comes over here in a Sunday
[1:14:19] afternoon after church walks sister inz
[1:14:22] through the snow and they lay their
[1:14:23] hands on the building and pray that God
[1:14:25] will give it to us even though it's sold
[1:14:29] already cuz she's a woman of Faith
[1:14:32] sister ANZ she's listening God bless you
[1:14:35] she's a woman of Faith she's seen it in
[1:14:37] her life she knows it's real so they do
[1:14:40] that and then just before we go to
[1:14:42] Israel I write a little email to um this
[1:14:45] uh man I say we've seen the building we
[1:14:48] like it congratulations on your new
[1:14:50] building and if something happens you
[1:14:53] know we would be interested in the
[1:14:54] building that's all I said we should be
[1:14:56] looking beyond the
[1:14:59] circumstances to what God's trying to
[1:15:01] birth is everybody catching that
[1:15:03] today we have to the message tell us to
[1:15:07] master our perfect Faith Masters us
[1:15:09] every
[1:15:10] circumstance and never caused them for
[1:15:12] us to miss God so men have done this and
[1:15:14] even today among ourselves let's just
[1:15:16] pass some of that but we could go into
[1:15:18] the our our present environment and go
[1:15:21] into even uh uh a a mixture of the
[1:15:24] righteousness of God with Works
[1:15:26] perfection in the flesh the Holy Ghost
[1:15:28] when it comes to you is not perfection
[1:15:29] in the flesh if it's preached that way
[1:15:31] it's not preached
[1:15:33] correctly but can we apply these
[1:15:35] circumstances and the cloud that was
[1:15:37] over the birth of Christ in his first
[1:15:39] coming can we apply it to his second
[1:15:42] coming as well we can because he brought
[1:15:45] this word of this generation remember
[1:15:47] now I don't know if you knew this but I
[1:15:49] want to make sure that I don't assume
[1:15:51] that you know it the first com coming of
[1:15:53] Christ was not just a moment true it was
[1:15:56] a sequence of
[1:15:58] events it was a cycle of events it began
[1:16:02] with some dreams to people it began with
[1:16:04] the prophecy 400 years before then it
[1:16:06] some people had some dreams and uh and
[1:16:08] then Elizabeth uh she got pregnant she
[1:16:11] couldn't get preg she got pregnant and
[1:16:12] so it was a process then Christ was born
[1:16:14] but that wasn't the first coming then he
[1:16:16] would grew up then he had three and a
[1:16:18] half years of ministry then he died and
[1:16:20] rose again so the first Advent or the
[1:16:22] first coming of Christ was not just one
[1:16:24] moment it was a series of
[1:16:27] events the last coming of Christ or the
[1:16:29] second coming is the same way it's not
[1:16:31] one moment of the Rapture even though
[1:16:33] we're looking forward to that the second
[1:16:35] coming begins with the word being born
[1:16:39] without man's hands on
[1:16:41] it the Virgin word Born Again Untouched
[1:16:45] by denomination the seals are taken off
[1:16:48] of
[1:16:50] it but if you try to present how God
[1:16:54] would launch the second coming of Christ
[1:16:57] and presented uh the seventh angel and
[1:17:00] the and uh uh Kentucky
[1:17:03] hillbilly with a seventh grade education
[1:17:07] God did the whole backrop of how it
[1:17:10] would happen in a intellectual
[1:17:13] environment in a seminary environment in
[1:17:16] a in a figuring everything out in the
[1:17:18] logistics of it in an intellectual age
[1:17:21] beyond the industry age the
[1:17:23] technological age all this would happen
[1:17:25] and God says in the middle of all that
[1:17:27] intellect I'm going to pick a seventh
[1:17:30] grade education man and I'm going to
[1:17:32] bring this word he'll finish his work
[1:17:34] and go on to his reward but I'm going to
[1:17:36] use this fessel it's a hard
[1:17:40] cell but it ain't different than the
[1:17:42] first coming and when sin abounds the
[1:17:45] grace of God abounds even more that's
[1:17:48] what the Bible
[1:17:50] says when circumstances become extreme
[1:17:53] and it looks impossible that's when the
[1:17:55] god rich in Mercy steps in because we
[1:17:59] need in this hour a god rich in Mercy
[1:18:02] families are Tor apart there's things
[1:18:03] that happen in families we didn't want
[1:18:05] to happen oh God why did that happen to
[1:18:07] me that's embarrassing to me and so we
[1:18:10] we repent we go on with God but
[1:18:12] thankfully The God Who is rich in Mercy
[1:18:15] when we need it steps in and he's not
[1:18:18] he's not poor in Mercy in this day he
[1:18:20] has to be rich in Mercy how many raise
[1:18:23] your hand I need a God rich in Mercy
[1:18:26] with my mistakes I need a God rich in
[1:18:30] Mercy in leoda in this perverted sexual
[1:18:35] age when thoughts come to us all the
[1:18:37] time I tell you I need a God to correct
[1:18:39] me I need a God rich in Mercy I need his
[1:18:42] grace I need his his forgiveness can you
[1:18:44] say amen I needed more than I've ever
[1:18:46] needed it
[1:18:49] before amen God always stepped in with a
[1:18:52] god rich in Mercy the first sin and
[1:18:55] man's hiding he's in hiding covering
[1:18:57] himself with fig
[1:18:59] leaves hiding away from God in his
[1:19:01] presence he was always in the presence
[1:19:02] of God always Fellowship me he sins he
[1:19:05] goes hides like we do he hides away
[1:19:07] there's people sometimes attending my
[1:19:08] congregation you're still hiding you
[1:19:10] still got your wall up oh once you trust
[1:19:13] the Lord and quit putting your wall up
[1:19:15] be free in Jesus Christ bring your sins
[1:19:18] to the cross your pth to the Cross let
[1:19:20] it all be washed away and be free in
[1:19:23] Jesus
[1:19:24] Christ quit holding back quit holding
[1:19:26] your heart back from the rest of the
[1:19:28] congregation and from God don't do that
[1:19:30] don't be afraid of people people may
[1:19:32] hurt you but you become bigger than that
[1:19:34] can you say Amen he's he's bigger than
[1:19:36] all my problems he's bigger than the
[1:19:38] people who criticized me he's bigger
[1:19:40] than my past can I get an amen this
[1:19:42] morning he's bigger than all of
[1:19:46] that what was I talking about than you
[1:19:51] Lord please somebody remind
[1:19:56] me huh God God rich in Mercy and he goes
[1:20:01] he finds them and he's hi they're hiding
[1:20:05] say what are you doing hiding he calls
[1:20:07] them out of their hiding come on I want
[1:20:10] I've got to find a place to fellowship
[1:20:12] with you again I tell that was a god
[1:20:14] rich in Mercy they didn't deserve that
[1:20:17] right come out here stand out here and
[1:20:19] they covering
[1:20:21] themselves
[1:20:23] said God grabs skins throw those things
[1:20:26] down throw some skins on you bloody lamb
[1:20:31] skin and this will begin the
[1:20:34] beginnings so I can find some place to
[1:20:36] fellowship with you
[1:20:38] again friend if you're away from God or
[1:20:41] your heart is blocked to God there's a
[1:20:44] God rich in
[1:20:46] Mercy there is a God who is rich in
[1:20:49] Mercy and He is wanting his word to be
[1:20:55] born and
[1:20:57] manifested in your
[1:20:59] life oh my I'll finish this next
[1:21:05] time I like it verse 20 because he says
[1:21:08] by but while Joseph thought on these
[1:21:10] things what's he thinking about how can
[1:21:12] I fix this what can I do put her away
[1:21:14] privately we got to do this we got to
[1:21:16] cover it up while he was thinking all
[1:21:18] those things the angel of the Lord
[1:21:19] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[1:21:20] Joseph the son of David fear not
[1:21:23] why is he saying fear not because he's
[1:21:24] living under fear because of his
[1:21:27] circumstance aren't you glad when God
[1:21:29] rich in Mercy comes and says stop
[1:21:31] fearing the future stop fearing your
[1:21:35] circumstance stop being fearful because
[1:21:38] what's happening in Mary this that is
[1:21:41] happening was already spoken by a
[1:21:46] prophet and you're trying to cover it up
[1:21:49] you're trying to no no no the word the
[1:21:52] word of is being fulfilled in your
[1:21:54] life marry that woman you know that I'm
[1:21:57] just going to close this by saying I got
[1:22:00] a bunch of quotes I wanted to read and
[1:22:01] everything I want to say this was the
[1:22:03] next the last scripture says in verse 25
[1:22:07] verse 24 then Joseph being raised from
[1:22:10] sleep did as the angel of the Lord had
[1:22:13] been him and took unto him his wife both
[1:22:17] Mary and both Joseph when they got the
[1:22:20] picture from the angel what this really
[1:22:22] was and what was going on they both
[1:22:25] offered to God what was needed to begin
[1:22:28] the process I tell you friends it
[1:22:30] doesn't take just God's word it takes a
[1:22:32] heart saying be it unto me it takes a
[1:22:35] heart said I'm willing to Bear the
[1:22:37] reproach I'm willing to live like a
[1:22:39] young girl and dress like a young girl
[1:22:41] should dress I'm willing to follow God
[1:22:43] I'm willing to his word to be fulfilled
[1:22:45] in my life a young man it takes a young
[1:22:47] man say like Joseph okay now it's
[1:22:50] settled I'm all
[1:22:51] in I'm here for the
[1:22:55] duration and we will carry this word I
[1:22:57] will take care of this word I will raise
[1:22:59] this son even though he's not my own I'm
[1:23:02] I'm all we need young people to say I'm
[1:23:05] all
[1:23:06] in we need people to say I'm not on the
[1:23:09] internet toss between two no I'm all in
[1:23:12] that's finished I'm done with that I'm
[1:23:13] all and I'm carrying a burden I'm
[1:23:15] carrying a reproach people are going to
[1:23:17] laugh at me but I'm ready to carry the
[1:23:20] reproach I'm ready to follow through
[1:23:23] a lot of you done it years ago and
[1:23:24] you've been carrying it all these years
[1:23:25] God bless you we're going to continue to
[1:23:27] carry it until the Rapture we're going
[1:23:29] to we're going to be on CNN
[1:23:34] someday that's right we're going to be
[1:23:37] on CNN and you know what's going to
[1:23:39] happen it's not going to be the best
[1:23:41] representation of this message it's
[1:23:43] probably going to be some of the
[1:23:45] worst I hope it is I hope it's good but
[1:23:49] more than likely with the media it's
[1:23:51] probably not
[1:23:53] and we Associated and that's when we'll
[1:23:56] find out where everybody
[1:24:01] stands it'll be a real revealing time
[1:24:03] it's already happening but boy when
[1:24:05] we're on CNN I tell you it'll be a real
[1:24:08] test that's
[1:24:10] right because God likes to test his
[1:24:13] people to prove I got one quote here one
[1:24:17] quote you guys don't have it up there
[1:24:19] can I read one quote before we close I
[1:24:21] read this to the staff the other night I
[1:24:24] read it I said I just read this in
[1:24:27] possessing the enemy's Gates and I'll
[1:24:29] just pick this up and close my Bible
[1:24:31] just as
[1:24:33] proof This is the
[1:24:36] End he's talking about Israel he says it
[1:24:38] was only a few years later when the
[1:24:40] Trials come for Israel in the old in the
[1:24:42] wilderness and the church got All Shook
[1:24:43] Up as is so easy for a Congregation of
[1:24:46] people to do when something just don't
[1:24:49] seem to happen the way it's supposed to
[1:24:52] happen
[1:24:54] God makes it that
[1:24:56] way God brings tensions into the
[1:25:01] church because every son that cometh to
[1:25:04] God must be tried must be proven and
[1:25:07] must be
[1:25:09] tested he lets sickness strike you he
[1:25:12] lets disease come on you to test you and
[1:25:15] to prove you to show the world that
[1:25:18] you're truly the Seed of Abraham why
[1:25:21] does he do it to show the world this is
[1:25:24] my Seed of Abraham they believe no
[1:25:26] matter what they
[1:25:29] believe people wouldn't know that until
[1:25:31] God puts a test and puts an environment
[1:25:33] says wow they're going to be really
[1:25:35] tested am I going to am I going to keep
[1:25:37] carrying the burden of this word or am I
[1:25:39] going to ditch
[1:25:41] it he permits it that the show the world
[1:25:44] that you're a Seed of Abraham I'll tell
[1:25:46] you I'm ready for a test that shows that
[1:25:47] I'm a true sa Abraham I'm ready for you
[1:25:50] know well I say I'm ready I'm probably
[1:25:52] not
[1:25:53] ready but I just say to the devil Bring
[1:25:56] it
[1:25:57] on Bring it on if it's the proof of who
[1:26:01] his elect are if it's to finish this
[1:26:03] race Bring It
[1:26:06] On he permits his own will he permits
[1:26:11] disasters God permits the F for friends
[1:26:14] to turn against you he permits all these
[1:26:17] things and turns the devil loose to
[1:26:20] tempt you and he'll do all but take your
[1:26:23] life he could throw you on a bed of
[1:26:25] Affliction he could turn your neighbors
[1:26:27] against you he could turn the church
[1:26:29] against you he could do most anything
[1:26:31] and it's God's will for him to do it we
[1:26:34] are taught that these things are more
[1:26:37] precious than gold to US that's right
[1:26:40] it's way we got to look at it last
[1:26:41] Sunday brother Nathan he says it if they
[1:26:44] haul up with the truck was it going to
[1:26:45] dump all this gold out would you rather
[1:26:48] have that gold or would you have your
[1:26:50] rather have your trials
[1:26:53] what a great question for us especially
[1:26:55] those of us that need money right
[1:26:59] now I use just one block of that
[1:27:03] gold and we let stand and say I'll take
[1:27:07] the
[1:27:08] trials because they're more precious
[1:27:10] than that
[1:27:11] gold I'll take the
[1:27:13] testing I'll take people speaking
[1:27:16] against me I'll take the tensions in the
[1:27:18] church we have it we have it but God
[1:27:21] allows it God permits it to test us are
[1:27:23] we going to grow up are we going to run
