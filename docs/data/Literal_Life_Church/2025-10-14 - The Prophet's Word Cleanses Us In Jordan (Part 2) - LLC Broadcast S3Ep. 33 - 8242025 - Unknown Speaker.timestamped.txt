[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:27] the sound in lights ablaze. If that's
[0:31] the measure you must take to crush the
[0:34] idol.
[0:37] Jerk the pews and all the decorations
[0:41] too until the congregation's few then
[0:45] have revival.
[0:49] Tell your friends that this is where the
[0:52] party ends. Until you're broken for your
[0:55] sins, you can't be social.
[1:00] Then seek the Lord and wait for what he
[1:03] has in store. And know that great is
[1:06] your reward. So just be hopeful
[1:10] cuz you can
[1:13] sing all you want to. Yes, you can
[1:18] sing all you want to.
[1:23] You can sing all you want to and still
[1:28] get it wrong.
[1:30] Oh, worship is more than a song.
[1:37] [Music]
[1:45] Take a break from all the plans that you
[1:48] have made and sit at home alone and wait
[1:52] for God to whisper.
[1:56] Beg him please to open up his mouth and
[1:59] speak and pray for real upon your knees
[2:03] until they blister.
[2:07] Shine the light on every corner of your
[2:10] life until the pride and lust and lies
[2:14] are in the open.
[2:18] Then read the word and put to test the
[2:21] things you've heard until your heart and
[2:24] soul are stirred in rocks and broken.
[2:28] Cuz you can
[2:30] sing all you want to. Yes, you can
[2:36] sing all you want to.
[2:41] You can sing all you want to and still
[2:45] get it wrong.
[2:47] Oh, worship is more than a song.
[2:53] We must not worship something that's not
[2:58] even worth it.
[3:03] Leave the stage.
[3:06] Make some space for the one who deserves
[3:10] it.
[3:17] Anything I put before my God is an idol.
[3:27] And anything I want with all my heart is
[3:33] an idol.
[3:38] And anything I can't stop thinking of is
[3:44] an idol.
[3:48] And anything that I give all my love is
[3:54] an idol. Oh,
[3:58] cuz I can sing all I want to. Yes, I can
[4:04] sing all I want to. And we can
[4:09] sing all we want to. And we can
[4:14] sing. All we want to.
[4:19] We can sing all we want. It's wrong.
[4:25] Worship is more than a song.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Second Kings 5 picking up again at verse
[4:37] 9. So non came with his horses and with
[4:40] his chariot and stood at the door of the
[4:43] house of Elisha. And Elisha sent a
[4:45] messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash
[4:48] in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh
[4:50] shall come again to thee, and thou shalt
[4:53] be clean." But non was wroth and went
[4:55] away and said, "Behold, I thought he
[4:58] will surely come out to me and stand and
[5:01] call on the name of the Lord his God and
[5:03] strike his hand over the place and
[5:05] recover the leper." Non had all of this
[5:09] preconceived in his mind how God was
[5:11] going to do it. And he was wrong on all
[5:14] points. All points. This is when our
[5:18] minds gets in the way of God. This is
[5:21] when our minds get lifted up above the
[5:24] ways of God and how he's going to do
[5:26] things. Don't underestimate how powerful
[5:30] the creative mind can be. But when it
[5:32] gets in trouble is when it interrupts
[5:34] the way God wants to do things.
[5:37] Are not then he complains about the
[5:39] rivers. Are not Abna and uh Farar rivers
[5:44] of Damascus better than all the waters
[5:46] of Israel? May I not wash in them and be
[5:48] clean? So he turned and went away in a
[5:51] rage. And his servants came near and
[5:53] spake unto him and said, "My father, if
[5:55] the prophet had bid thee to do something
[5:57] great, wouldest thou not have done it,
[5:59] how much rather than when thou say, he
[6:02] saith, wash and be clean?" Then when he
[6:04] went down and dipped himself seven times
[6:07] in Jordan, according to the saying, the
[6:09] man of of the man of God, and his flesh
[6:11] came again like unto the flesh of a
[6:13] little child, and he was clean. Elisha,
[6:18] which has a a a bit of a feminine she
[6:21] is, is he becomes a type of the bride.
[6:23] And in his ministry, in what he does, uh
[6:27] we find types in there for our lives as
[6:30] well. So, we want to pay close attention
[6:32] to that. We want to be listening. And we
[6:34] find then that we uh uh in the early
[6:38] days of Elisha, we find Elisha so
[6:41] consumed. I don't want to miss these
[6:42] points about Elisha. We find him so
[6:45] consumed with staying very close to
[6:48] Elijah. Elisha was staying very close to
[6:51] him. Elijah actually tried to get him
[6:53] and say, "You stay here and I'll go
[6:54] somewhere else." Elijah said, "No, I'm
[6:56] not going to leave you. I'm staying
[6:57] right with you." And then he said, "What
[6:59] do you want from me?" And he said, "You
[7:01] know what? I I'm asking for a double
[7:03] portion of your spirit to come on me."
[7:05] Talk about it's asking for big things.
[7:08] Even Elijah said, "My, this is a big
[7:10] request, but you ask it." And God gave
[7:13] it to him.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; But but look at how closely linked he
[7:17] wanted to be to Elijah cuz he knew that
[7:20] was God's man. He knew it was God's man
[7:22] for the hour. He knew that he was
[7:24] eventually leaving, but he didn't want
[7:26] him to leave until he said, "I want a
[7:28] double portion of that spirit to come on
[7:30] me." He asked for it. He got it. And see
[7:32] then we see him go and he knew the time
[7:35] was time for a transition going from
[7:38] Elijah and now the ministry being on
[7:40] Elisha for the work to be able to
[7:43] continue it the the work of the Lord did
[7:46] not end with Elijah. It continued in
[7:49] Elisha. And so when Elisha seen this
[7:52] change in this uh in in in this
[7:55] transition going on and it was going to
[7:57] change from Elijah to God positioning
[8:00] Elijah for a work to continue. The first
[8:03] thing he cried out while holding the
[8:06] mantle of Elijah. The first thing he
[8:08] cried out he said where is the Lord God
[8:11] of Elijah? First thing he says this is
[8:14] how close he wanted to stay to this. I
[8:16] want a double portion of his spirit
[8:18] spirit. But then he says, he takes that
[8:20] mantle, he actually strikes the Jordan
[8:23] and it opens up just like it did Elijah.
[8:25] Can you say amen? But he says, "Where is
[8:28] the Lord God of Elijah?" I want you to
[8:30] notice he didn't cry out, "Where's
[8:32] Elijah? What are we going to do?
[8:34] Elijah's gone." He did not cry, "Where's
[8:37] Elijah?" He cried, "I want the Lord God
[8:41] of Elijah."
[8:43] That's a big difference because we have
[8:46] movements among us that are trying to
[8:48] keep Elijah alive, trying to say maybe
[8:52] he's going to come back. We don't have
[8:54] anything. But I told you last Sunday
[8:56] when God sends his word through Elijah,
[8:58] Elijah may leave, but the word is still
[9:01] here.
[9:04] The word is still in the land. And then
[9:07] that the bride becomes a carrier of that
[9:09] word. It has all the power in it. It
[9:12] will not return void. It will finish his
[9:14] work. But how's it going to finish it?
[9:16] It's going to finish it in you.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Not
[9:22] where is Elijah. Where is the Lord God
[9:24] of Elijah?
[9:26] &gt;&gt; It's where the Lord God of Elijah is
[9:28] what we want. And he called a
[9:30] revelation. There's a transition. And I
[9:33] don't need Elijah to come back. I need
[9:35] the Lord God of Elijah. He called a
[9:37] revelation. It's not to repeat Elijah
[9:40] again. It's not to have him come back.
[9:42] We're not trying to be a prophet or look
[9:45] for another one like that prophet. Can
[9:48] you say amen? We're looking now for how
[9:50] the God in that prophet will work
[9:52] through us. It's amazing how when a gift
[9:56] looks so similar to a discernment of a
[9:59] prophet, it's amazing when a gift would
[10:02] rise up and it looks so similar to a
[10:04] prophetic gift, people flock after it.
[10:09] I just say it safely. They have not
[10:11] recognized the awakening of the bride.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; If they flock after a gift that's
[10:16] similar to the prophet trying to make it
[10:18] happen again, they have not recognize
[10:20] the awakening of the bride. They have
[10:23] not caught a revelation of the
[10:25] transition.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; And so they reach back into the past and
[10:29] they're looking for the same type of
[10:31] gift to the work. And they're reaching
[10:33] back into Pentecost. But that's not what
[10:35] Elijah's catching. He's saying, "I don't
[10:37] need Elijah to come back. I need the
[10:39] Lord God of Elijah to come help me
[10:41] finish this work."
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now people flock after
[10:47] that. I won't say much more about that,
[10:49] but I'm telling you, they haven't
[10:50] recognized and they deceive the people
[10:52] somewhat because they take them
[10:54] backwards instead of forward. Elisha
[10:56] didn't want to go backwards. And
[10:58] incidentally, if you read your Bible, uh
[11:01] the sons of the prophets, soon as Elijah
[11:03] went up in the chariot, the sons of the
[11:05] prophets tried to influence Elijah to go
[11:09] find Elijah. They said, "Isn't this
[11:12] interesting?" They said, "Maybe he's
[11:15] just took the chariot up to a mountain.
[11:17] If we send out a search team, you've got
[11:19] 50 men here." It's these these prophets,
[11:22] it's the ministers that are saying,
[11:24] "Let's try to get Elijah back.
[11:28] Oh, that's too true to this hour.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; We're nothing without Elijah coming
[11:33] back. The the tent, whatever's got to
[11:35] happen where nothing's going on. No,
[11:37] there's no been no revival going on.
[11:39] Elisha didn't think that because he just
[11:41] took the mantle and struck the waters
[11:43] and it opened up like Elijah. Don't tell
[11:46] me God's not around. Don't tell me the
[11:48] God of Elijah isn't here. The God of
[11:51] Elijah has performed miracle after
[11:53] miracle. The God, the God of Elijah has
[11:56] called a bride
[11:59] &gt;&gt; to take and carry this word.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; And so we find that Elisha called a
[12:06] revelation. And these guys said, "I
[12:08] can't get past this point." These guys
[12:10] said, "Go send out and try to find
[12:13] Elijah again." And Elisha said, "No,
[12:15] don't do that." Why did he say, "No,
[12:16] don't do it." Because he had a
[12:18] revelation. Elijah's work was finished.
[12:20] And so now we find then the sons tried
[12:22] to do that. I want to finish the story
[12:24] there. I'm having a hard time cuz I'm
[12:26] I'm wanting to preach this morning these
[12:28] things. They said go. He said, "Don't
[12:30] go." Finally, it weighed on him and
[12:31] Elisha said, "Go on up." They went to
[12:33] trying to find Elijah. They couldn't
[12:35] find him. Well, that's because God took
[12:38] him in a chariot.
[12:40] Couldn't find him. Come back. We
[12:41] couldn't find him. We couldn't find
[12:43] Elijah. We've got to find Elijah. He
[12:45] said, "I told you. I told you not to
[12:48] go." Elisha had to stand against that
[12:52] spirit
[12:53] of idolatry in order to come into his
[12:57] own position.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Elijah had to stand against that spirit
[13:03] of idolatry
[13:05] to find his positioning in the word of
[13:09] God. After Elisha then began his
[13:11] ministry, there were very few things
[13:13] that Elisha did that was similar to
[13:14] Elijah. Some were similar, but there
[13:16] were very few things. And yet Elisha has
[13:20] a double portion of the spirit of
[13:22] Elijah. You would think if he's got a
[13:24] double portion, all the works that
[13:27] Elisha is doing would be similar to
[13:28] Elijah, but they weren't. They were
[13:31] different. A matter of fact, Elijah,
[13:32] he's speaking to an entire generation,
[13:34] to the whole nation of Israel, to the
[13:36] politics, everything else. He rebukes
[13:39] Jezebel and the Jezebel system. But when
[13:41] it comes to Elisha, it's a little bit
[13:43] more personal to a widow woman, to this,
[13:45] to that, and the other. It's a little
[13:47] bit more personal. There are things that
[13:48] are similar, but there are things that
[13:50] are not similar. And here's the biggest
[13:52] point. Watch how God does things a
[13:55] little bit different to bring healing
[13:58] through the ministry of Elisha. Because
[14:01] we always think, well, he's going to do
[14:02] it the same way he did it before. He's
[14:04] going to do it. We we listen to certain
[14:06] things. He's going to do it this way. He
[14:07] did it this. And if he's done something
[14:09] before, he can do it again. Just don't
[14:11] get your mind involved to say, "I want
[14:12] him to do it just like he did it back in
[14:15] the days of Elijah." God did things
[14:17] different on Elisha. And what did you
[14:18] have to trust? Not Elisha, but trust the
[14:21] God that was in Elisha that when he gave
[14:23] a word,
[14:25] &gt;&gt; if it's a word of God, you better go dip
[14:28] seven times in Jordan. You can complain
[14:31] all you want to, but you better go dip
[14:33] in Jordan if you want to be washed. We
[14:36] find then that the the miracles of
[14:39] Elisha were a bit different and it was
[14:42] Elisha's ministry that healed this
[14:44] leprosy. Now we have one incident before
[14:46] this when Miriam was struck with leprosy
[14:49] because her disrespect towards the man
[14:51] of God. Her and her brother criticized
[14:53] the marriage of Moses. That's all they
[14:55] did. And uh she was struck with leprosy.
[14:59] And then we find that God after seven
[15:00] days brought her back in the camp. So
[15:02] obviously she was healed. But this
[15:04] healing was the next incident that
[15:06] leprosy comes up. And leprosy comes up
[15:09] in the Bible. It's important for us to
[15:11] talk about because leprosy I I want to
[15:14] just break it down a little bit more
[15:15] than I did last Sunday because we find
[15:17] the prophet is the one who told us that
[15:19] leprosy was a type of sin. There was no
[15:22] cure back then for leprosy. Matter of
[15:25] fact, last Sunday I told you it was
[15:26] about 1940. They they finally got a cure
[15:29] for leprosy. 1940s. Is God going to deal
[15:33] with the leprosy, the sin of leprosy,
[15:35] the leprosy, the sin? Is he going to
[15:36] deal with it in the end time? He has to
[15:38] deal with it. And he's not going to deal
[15:40] with something new. It's the same
[15:41] atonement from Calvary, but he's going
[15:43] to renew it and bring the revelation to
[15:45] the people. I've given you my atonement,
[15:49] and it is just as powerful it's ever
[15:50] been. And guess what? You're going to
[15:52] need it cuz it's a dirty age. It's a
[15:54] leprosy age. It's an unclean age. You're
[15:58] going to need to be washed by the water
[16:01] of the word.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Not just baptized, but your mind's going
[16:06] to need to be washed.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; Your spirit's going to need to be
[16:09] washed. Your emotions are going to need
[16:11] to be washed.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; And sometimes your body is going to need
[16:15] to be healed.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; The atonement, how many believe the
[16:18] atonement's still in action today?
[16:21] &gt;&gt; It's still just as real. Praise the
[16:23] Lord. So the prophet brought it back to
[16:25] this is a type of leprosy. There was no
[16:27] cure back then. And so because there was
[16:29] no cure under the Levitical law, God
[16:31] actually put in specifics for leprosy
[16:34] how to deal with it. And that's what you
[16:35] have to do when you don't have healing
[16:36] for it, a complete healing like non.
[16:39] Then you deal with things. You you put
[16:40] things in place to deal with it. And the
[16:42] way God dealt with it that they had to
[16:44] go through a process. There was an
[16:46] isolation for people that had leprosy,
[16:49] isolation from the rest of the people.
[16:51] They had to go outside the camp. Uh, and
[16:54] leprosy came in the human body. And if
[16:56] it was in the human body, starting in
[16:58] the skin, then if they came into their
[17:00] house, then it would get in the house,
[17:02] it would infect other people, it would
[17:04] get in the clothes, it would get in the
[17:06] fabrics. It It was a filthy, filthy
[17:08] thing. And it just begin to invade
[17:10] everything. And God specifically had to
[17:13] deal with it someday. But he gave
[17:16] instructions how to deal with something.
[17:17] Now, I want you to notice God will help
[17:20] us sometimes deal with something.
[17:23] He'll give us something to deal with
[17:25] something. And it's wonderful to deal
[17:27] with it. But always remember, God does
[17:31] not want you to just deal with it the
[17:33] rest of your life. In fact, that's what
[17:34] people will tell you sometimes. Just
[17:37] deal with it. Everybody ever heard that?
[17:40] What do I What do I do? Just deal with
[17:42] it. This is kind of a don't care
[17:44] attitude.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Just deal with it. No, God doesn't just
[17:48] say deal with it the rest of his life.
[17:50] Rest of your life. He's got an atonement
[17:52] that's going to heal it until it's baby
[17:55] skin again.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is a powerful word and
[18:01] atonement he's given us. Don't you ever
[18:03] underestimate it. And don't block it
[18:05] from coming in your life.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; So, God specifically deals with it now
[18:09] with a healing. And we come to the the
[18:11] story of non when he deals with it. And
[18:14] look how he deals with it. Now, here's
[18:15] what brother Bram said about leprosy.
[18:17] Leprosy, there was no cure for leprosy.
[18:19] They haven't found it yet. This was
[18:21] 1953. He says this. They they haven't
[18:25] found it. So, it took a while for the
[18:27] the cure for leprosy to get out. 1941, I
[18:30] think, is when they found something, but
[18:31] it didn't spread the word. That's
[18:32] probably why Brother Bram saying they
[18:34] haven't found the cure for leprosy. If
[18:35] you guys can put that quote up if you
[18:36] have it. They haven't found it yet. Only
[18:39] God can cure leprosy. They haven't found
[18:42] even nothing for it to help it. But it's
[18:44] a type of sin. It sets in so gradual.
[18:48] It's painless. Just moves right in and
[18:52] you don't know it until you're dying.
[18:55] It's a type of sin. And that's how sin
[18:58] works in our life. In our life, it's not
[19:00] it's painless. It moves in gradual. Just
[19:03] moves right in. Don't know it until
[19:04] you're dying. Big white warts come out
[19:07] and all over you. Limbs drop off and
[19:10] everything. Eats you right into it. Just
[19:12] it just eats you up. Leprosy. Jesus was
[19:16] the only one who could heal this
[19:17] leprosy. He's the only one today who
[19:20] could heal this leprosy. He's not just
[19:23] talking about the natural leprosy. He's
[19:24] talking about sin. Jesus is the only one
[19:27] that can heal this type of sin.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I had a couple pictures here. It
[19:31] starts out with a you can't even feel
[19:33] these rashes that come. You can't even
[19:35] hardly feel it. And as he said here,
[19:37] it's gradual and it just it's painless.
[19:39] You can't even feel it. Then it starts
[19:40] to get itchy and then but look at the
[19:42] final result now. Then it starts to eat
[19:45] away. This is sin. It starts gradual. It
[19:47] starts at the surface. But if you leave
[19:50] it there, it eventually it eats up your
[19:52] entire body. It takes limo. It takes the
[19:56] flesh off. It eats the flesh. Is anybody
[19:59] listening to me, young people, you
[20:00] listen to me, you dabble around with the
[20:02] things of sin. You may not feel the
[20:05] effects of it yet, but if you let it
[20:07] stay there, it's going to eat everything
[20:09] good out of your life. There's a word
[20:11] here that's continually washing the
[20:13] bride, cleaning the bride.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; And so, what I was thinking about last
[20:18] night as I was just looking at this and
[20:20] praying after we it it's hard to type
[20:23] this sin with the nature of sin that
[20:25] we're born with because the nature of
[20:27] sins is not something you got gradual.
[20:30] You were born with the nature of sin.
[20:33] And the atonement had to cut cut to the
[20:35] very core of the nature of sin. You were
[20:38] born with it. How many raise your hands
[20:39] say? I was born with the nature of sin.
[20:41] You didn't do anything bad to get that.
[20:43] You were born with it. You didn't look
[20:45] at the wrong website to get that type of
[20:48] sin. You were born with that. We were
[20:51] born defeated. Can you say amen? We were
[20:53] born losers.
[20:56] What a terrible thing to say. That's not
[20:58] politically correct. But according to
[21:00] our first birth, you're born a loser.
[21:04] You have nothing to go on. I know,
[21:06] brother Paul. I'm pretty good. I've made
[21:08] it pretty successful in life. You were
[21:09] born a loser. And without the new birth,
[21:12] you were you're you're you're going
[21:14] straight to the wrong place without a
[21:17] new birth.
[21:20] You try to handle your nature of sin all
[21:21] you want to with giving to the poor and
[21:24] dressing up nice on the outside and but
[21:26] you need a new birth and that changes
[21:28] your desires. It actually kills the
[21:30] nature of sin. It kills the spirit of
[21:33] unbelief that's inside you. But I don't
[21:35] know if this leprosy and forgive me if
[21:38] I'm just going off on a limb here but I
[21:40] don't see that sin as being gradual.
[21:42] That's you're born with that. That does
[21:44] not come gradual. this more types a slow
[21:48] surface rash that comes in your life of
[21:50] sin but if it's not dealt with it eats
[21:53] everything up it's a slow work this is
[21:55] maybe not the nature of sin but the
[21:58] infection of sin
[22:02] maybe this is not the nature of sin
[22:04] you're born with but this is the
[22:05] infection of sin is there such a thing
[22:08] yes I believe there is the infection of
[22:10] sin into our body into our spirit and
[22:13] into our mind so After we see his
[22:16] prophet's word is still in the land
[22:18] under Elisha, we see non who is a great
[22:22] man gets infected with this leprosy. And
[22:24] as we said last Sunday, leprosy will
[22:27] affect anybody. No matter how great your
[22:28] position, no matter who you are, he was
[22:31] a great warrior and all of a sudden now
[22:33] one day he gets these warts and things
[22:35] on his hands. It keeps growing. It's
[22:38] like he's saying, "Why me? Why do I get
[22:40] this? I'm a great man. I got great
[22:42] money." He couldn't buy his way out of
[22:43] it. He couldn't talk his way out of it.
[22:46] He got it. Which shows us that sin is
[22:48] not a respector of persons. Praise the
[22:50] Lord. And so non, he's a great man. He's
[22:53] saying, you know, why, you know, it's
[22:55] like what an inconvenience to my life.
[22:57] You know, it's like now this comes
[22:59] along. you know, life was going great
[23:01] and wonderful. And I just want to
[23:03] examine the thought patterns of non
[23:06] because I think it's way too close to
[23:08] the way we think about when something
[23:11] strikes us in life and all of a sudden
[23:13] now this isn't fair. This is an
[23:16] inconvenience to me. This is this this
[23:19] messes up my schedule.
[23:22] I'm a commander in the army. I've got to
[23:24] do this and I've got to do that. But
[23:25] sometimes God allows something. You see
[23:29] now friends, why did God allow this
[23:31] leprosy in non for a number of reasons.
[23:34] He's going to learn h have to learn how
[23:37] to come to the true God for healing.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; He's going to have to learn that he
[23:42] can't go to any other source except the
[23:44] true God.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; He can't buy his way out. He can't talk
[23:48] his way out of it. He and then but it's
[23:50] just this whole process of mindset. This
[23:52] is not fair. This doesn't belong to me.
[23:54] And God allows things to come in our
[23:57] lives sometimes that interrupt. It's
[23:59] inconvenient. It interrupts our
[24:01] schedule. I had a plan. I had a plan.
[24:04] Everything's got to be just so. And so
[24:05] you get a plan. And then God interrupts
[24:08] that plan.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Non had a plan. And all of a sudden, the
[24:13] whole thing's interrupted by something
[24:15] pretty huge. And he can't find anything
[24:17] to get rid of this inconvenience in his
[24:20] life.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; That's the way God wanted it.
[24:25] That's the way God allowed it. Because
[24:28] we can't get in a mindset, I don't want
[24:30] any minds. I don't want any anything to
[24:33] infect my life. I don't want anything to
[24:35] change my life. Non, he's a great man.
[24:37] He gets infected. But he has to humble
[24:40] himself to how the word was going to
[24:42] play out for his life. And he had to
[24:44] have no preconceived ideas, no money
[24:46] paid, no seeking for great things. He
[24:50] needs to be made clean and the word will
[24:52] heal him. But he needed to take the
[24:55] prophet's word and submit to God's
[24:58] provided way for the hour.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; But he thought it out ahead of time. And
[25:05] we tend to prethink
[25:08] how God's going to bring deliverance. We
[25:11] say, "I know God heals. I know he's
[25:13] going to heal me." The problem is is
[25:14] when when non said, "Behold, I thought,"
[25:18] where he got in trouble. And when we
[25:20] start to prethink how God's going to do
[25:22] something, we hurt God's plan. We hurt
[25:26] God's provided way. And non thought, I
[25:28] just know when I go, I just know the
[25:32] meeting is going to go this way.
[25:34] Sometimes our own unrealistic
[25:36] expectations or pre-planned expectations
[25:39] set ourselves up for disappointment. Can
[25:42] I get an amen? You may have done it to
[25:44] yourself because you told God how he was
[25:46] going to do it. You gave them a time
[25:48] frame. You gave them how it fit in your
[25:50] schedule.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; You gave all of your instructions and
[25:56] it's just you had it all in your mind.
[25:58] Maybe you didn't tell nobody, but you
[26:00] had it all in your mind. It's going to
[26:02] go this way. And he walked up and he had
[26:05] it all planned. I'm going to stand up
[26:07] there by the door. I'm knocking on the
[26:09] front door. And uh Elisha's going to be
[26:13] there standing up. Elisha. He's standing
[26:16] up and he's going to open the door and
[26:18] I'm going to stand there and Elisha is
[26:22] going to hit me on the head.
[26:26] Too scared to do it.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; You want me to hit you?
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:30] Boy, you're a nice fella. You're not the
[26:32] Elisha that I want. You know, I want to
[26:35] be hit on the head. I'm going to stand
[26:37] there. The door's going to open. I'm
[26:38] going to have my eyes closed and
[26:39] Elisha's going to hit me on the head and
[26:42] say, "Be healed.
[26:49] But it's okay. I'll forgive you
[26:50] afterwards.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; No,
[26:53] &gt;&gt; you ain't doing it. No,
[26:54] &gt;&gt; man. What a brother. This guy. He's a
[26:56] good guy. All right. Thank you. Anyway,
[26:59] okay. Yeah, I picked the wrong guy. Be
[27:02] nice. I stood there at the door and he
[27:05] hit me on No, no, that's not how Elisha
[27:07] acts. And he hit me on the head and say,
[27:10] "Be healed.
[27:14] be healed.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[27:18] And that's how it's going to happen. And
[27:20] I want all of you servants to have your
[27:23] phones rolling because I want to get
[27:25] this all on video and post it right
[27:29] away.
[27:31] There might be, you know, lights around
[27:33] and everything going on and I want to
[27:36] get that on film so that I can post it
[27:39] right away. We always think it through
[27:42] to something great.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; And God had non's number to teach him.
[27:48] Don't you dare come to church with a
[27:50] preconceived idea how God's going to
[27:53] heal you. Don't live every day with a
[27:55] preconceived idea and time limits and
[27:57] all that. Just say, "Where is the Lord
[28:00] God of Elijah? Let him come on the scene
[28:02] in his own time. Let me be delivered,
[28:04] Lord." And Lord, I give you full sway to
[28:07] do it your own way
