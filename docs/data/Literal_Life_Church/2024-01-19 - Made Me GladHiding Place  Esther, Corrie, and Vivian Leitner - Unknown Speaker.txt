Made Me Glad/Hiding Place

Made Me Glad Lyrics:
Verse 1
I will bless the Lord forever
And I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all fear
And He has set my feet upon a rock

Pre-Chorus
And I will not be moved
And I'll say of the Lord

Chorus
You are my shield, my strength
My portion, Deliverer
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help

Verse 2
Whom have I in heaven but You
There's none I desire beside You
For You have made me glad
And I'll say of the Lord

Written by Miriam Webster (Hillsong Worship)

Hiding Place Lyrics:
Chorus
You're my hiding place;
Safe in your embrace,
I'm protected from the storm that rages
When the waters rise,
And I run to hide;
Lord, in You I find my hiding place.

Verse 1
I'm not asking You to take away
My troubles, Lord,
'Cause it's through the stormy weather
I learn to trust You more.
So I thank You for Your promise;
I have come to know
Your unfailing love surrounds me
When I need it most.

Written by Steven Curtis Chapman, Jerry Dean Jr. Salley
