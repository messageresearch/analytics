========================================

amen i'd like to invite you to turn into your bibles to the book of numbers chapter 16 and we'll read a scripture praise the lord i really did try to get out of preaching i really did paul wouldn't let it but we're here by god's grace amen numbers chapter 16. let's go to verse one nakora the son of ishar the son of kohath the son of levi and dayton and abraham the son of eliam and on the sun appeal sons of reuben took me and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation man of renault they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them you take too much on you seeing all the congregation the holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the lord and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spake unto color and said to all his company said even tomorrow the lord will show who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him amen you may be seated may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word praise the lord amen i would like to uh take a little thought this evening uh i pray that you just listen to what is in our heart um i want to take a thought the declaration of independence the declaration of independence which we know that we just recently as a country celebrated that day uh which we also call it uh the fourth of july but uh i was reading the history about these things i don't know the deep deep history i don't get in depth in it but i just read enough that catches my attention and then i began to read a few things about it i'm pretty sure many of you know what it is but i'm gonna just go over it briefly what it is and because i believe everything in the natural pretty much you can see spiritual types in it that's what i believe especially when it's happening to a country on a national scale of things like that even inventions when something newly being invented a lot of times you can see a spiritual type inside of that just like the prophet when he preached a message countdown he was just looking at astronauts and things like that and it caught his attention so there's a lot of things catch my attention sometimes i might hear a word or so and it just sticks in my mind and i can't get it out my mind i just go study upon that word that's kind of what i normally do but i decided to uh look up some things on the declaration of independence and i find it to be quite interesting because to me it's it's the is fitting this age that we're living in now in our case when it comes to the declaration of independence we understand that when america started we know the history of it how that we was coming here for freedom of religion running from the catholics and so forth like that and just wanted to have freedom of religion and then when our country began to get established and so forth and it's my understanding is correct uh i think we was on a british rule british trying to rule us or european something like that i just can't quite remember all of it but i know when the declaration of independence was written it was written because they wanted to be free because the word independence means to be free amen that's what that word mean but it says here i just wrote some of their notes down they say independence day also called fourth of july in the united states the annual celebration of nationhood it commemorates the passage of the declaration of independence by the continental congress on july 4th 1776 independence day is a celebration on monday july the 4th which is past a man i mean couple weeks ago in the united states so i begin to look into all these things and look into the words uh i look at the word declaration the word declaration it means a formal or an explicit statement or an announcement in other words uh you got something that you want to put out there something that you want to say you want to declare something amen and then it says here in the declaration of independ in declaration of independence i'm just going to read from the first portions of it of what it says when they begin to write this declaration which it was several men involved in uh writing this writing these things up it says it said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal now naturally when uh we was wanting our freedom here in america to be free from the british naturally that was fine you know i can understand that i really do understand that then it said that all men are created equal they say that they are endowed by their creator with certain and illinois inalienable rights that's what it says it says inalienable rights and and then so i went and looked at the word an ineligible what that kind of meant because i didn't know what that word meant so i said i'll just look it up and just see what it means that means uh i just had the definition here i think it means um rights that can't be taken away so in other words they're saying these are the rights our creator giving us our ineligible rights that can't be taken away then it said that among these it begins to tell what the rights are it said among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now it's interesting that when obama passed the hate crime law this is what he used but the part that he used i actually got this on my computer he made sure he used the third part when he said the pursuit of happiness he said because he feel that every he said this this has been something we've been fighting for decades and he said and today uh this is a victory that's what obama said he said everybody should have that right to choose their into their own in the pursuit of happiness but if they realize what they said in the declaration of independent they're talking about that that men are created equal that they are endowed by the creator with sudden unalienable rights now the creator didn't give them that right can we say man to a man to marry a man a woman married a woman so that's a little twisted up can we say man but notice it that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness other words what we can do what we want to do live the way we want to live we want our freedoms to be able to do what we want to do and then it stated in here that to secure these right right in other words we want to make sure our rights are secured and it says to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed in other words amen then it said then whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish and institute new government in other words when the government is not doing what we want to do it's our people we have the right as people to get into the office who we want to put in them to fit our desire of what we want can we say man that's why we are democracy country we can choose that's why we select our governments and all these things which uh we say we select but i'm here to tell you just that i don't want to bush above god select can we say man because the bible tells us god he sets up kings he sets them down god let whoever he wants to be in the office for his purpose to be fulfilled can we say man even the prophet tells us about these crooked voting machines and stuff all like this all these things god already know who's going to be the president even if the world be here another 10 years god already know who it's going to be whoever it's going to be it's going to be somebody that's going to fit god's purpose will perfect will it for god's purpose but here it is the rights of the people that's why when they get somebody voted in because you got to understand something especially in south carolina now we got people trying to get voted in for this a seat in the house and so forth you begin to see little uh uh flyers everywhere just everywhere but what's so interesting about politics all of those politicians to get elected they're gonna tell you what they want you to believe whether they believe it or not they're gonna they're gonna find out what's in the mind of the people what the people want then they're gonna start making promises i promise you you you get me into the office this is what i'm going to do i'm going to take care of all of this but soon as they get voted they don't do none of it in other words they say gotcha a me and now now i'm going to express what i really want to do that's politics can we say man it's just like i remember when obama got elected you know i used to hear amongst the black people and how we got obama obama and then all of a sudden about five months six months later i said man i wish i never voted for that man look what he doing i said well you only voted for him because he's black just to be prized that's the only reason why you did oh he black that's now you see what you voted for and so forth so they all make promises of what they're going to do but once they get in office they're going to start trying to fulfill their agenda but notice it's the rights of the people in other words the rights of the people when the government that they choose is not doing what they want to do they can either alter or abolish you know impeach we got to get them out of the office we need to do what we want to do that's the rights of the people and it's in our declaration of independence that's what the declaration dependence kind of in a nutshell is all about but what's so interesting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness praise the lord when i began to read that especially when it said there these are inalienable rights that our creator uh that are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights now inalienable and unalienable are actually kind of the same word i think you say one of them is approval plural and one of them is an adjective but they're kind of the same but what i find that's interesting you go right into the church a book the prophet of god said what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable rights amen he said originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost now they're going to declare that in the declaration of independence these are rights we're going to want nobody to take them away now the prophet god use the prophet to let us know what our rights are our rights are it's the word of god that's our rights to have everything that god promised us in this age it belongs to us and we gonna let nobody take that away from us can we say amen but now the declaration of independence people want their freedom they want their liberty they want to pursue their own way or happiness i find that is fitting to the leonicy and age on the spiritual sides people rights rights of the people this age have declared to god we want our independence we have a declaration of independence we want to live how you want to live whatever we want to do to fulfill our happiness lord they declaring this against god this is exactly what this age has done declare this against god we want our freedom we want our liberty and we want to pursue our own happiness regardless of what your word says but i want to go to your heaven that's what this world has actually done they have declared their declaration of independence against god can we say amen and then the prophet began to say this he says in the resume of the church ages he says i really like how he began to bring things down and begin to break him down because he said in the in the blue church eight book he said this time we haven't set forth the history of how the churches of these things happen he said we want to try to establish that now so he began to go back into the history of things he says i like how he began to break it all down he said the birth the birth of the church was at pentecost he said as the first adam was given a bribe fresh from the hand of god it was undefiled for a brief span so was christ the last adam giving a bribe per and fresh at pentecost and she remains separate and undefiled for some time so you got to watch the pattern he began to talk about when adam when god gave uh adam his wife she come fresh from the hands of god and she was undefiled for a short span that he says can we say amen did he begin to type it with pentecost because you remember on the pentecost on the day of pentecost uh that was the birth of the church but he said for a short time just like eve for a short time was undefiled so after pentecost when did the church start beginning to get defiled again it was under the ephesian church age when that nicholas and spirit was coming back up in the church to defile the church to make it powerless to make it lukewarm that's what it began to happen again so we find that even in the opening of the word god gave a fresh anointing to the bride of jesus christ but now the spirit's trying to slip back up in there can we say man to my amen to try to defile god's bride but she's too late can we say man because it's been prophesied god bride is not going to fall she's not going to be defiled she's going to overcome in this age it is the exact same pattern taking place amen but then he began to type these things amen then he began to give the scripture like in the book of acts how they was praising god having the favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as to be saved he began to express how that at the day of pentecost how the manifestation would take place and the gift was taking place how the believer was knitted together all these wonderful things was taking place but the devil was also there amen saying now i got to find a way to defile these people see one thing you got to understand about the devil if he can't beat you he'll join you then when he join you he'll try to defile you those are his tactic those are his ways can we say amen praise the lord and the devil know how to act like a christian amen he knew how to act very well just like a christian because he know how a life christian life's supposed to be so he knows how to act it out can we say praise the lord then you know the prophet began to give the different scriptures uh or how god was doing and man things were manifesting in the church he said how long this continues we do not know but one day excuse me he said how long this continues we do not know but one day even as eve was tempted and seduced by satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit amen now listen how he put this he said what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall he said what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans now look now at the declaration of independence this the declaration of independence is all about people governing themselves to what they want and how they want things to be and if it don't be the way they want it to be they can abolish it or they can alter it can we say amen so now listen to what he says he said already the first age had turned from following the per word of god they turned from god's demand notice he said they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely depending on him see god has always always will wants his church to be dependent on him not themselves god don't want us to be dependent on ourselves he want us to be dependent on him and how do we be dependent on god is by putting his word before all things can we say amen but now he began to talk about how the antichrist spirit began to come in amongst the first church and then he said they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely depending on him depending entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government other words we want god to fulfill what he's saying apart from human government we want god to do it not no kind of human government to do it notice what he says now he said to nicolaitanism which is organizing a human government within the church so that nicolaitan spirit is actually making a declaration to god we're going to alter your word we're going to change your word we want everything to fit the way that we want to fit and live how we want to live or whatever your words say we're going to change it that's what they're trying to do to the master they want to change it try to say the prophet didn't mean this and he didn't he meant exactly what god told him to say what are we understanding or not he meant exactly what he said so who are we to alter it whenever somebody try to take this message change it what you're doing is on a declaration to god you want your independence you want your freedom to do whatever you want to do it's exactly what it is yes sir which is organized organizing the human government within the church he said which which as all governments do legislate for the people see government legislate for the people amen whatever you want them to do you pro you bring it to them you press them then they they'll try to fulfill that for you you see that's what we was reading here in the book of numbers that was a declaration that they brought to moses against god exactly what that was praise the lord let's look at that scripture again they come to moses they find the scripture again that was pretty strong how they come to it it ain't no different today what people do he said they rose up before moses with certain other children of israel i like all the scripture worded not just anybody of the children of israel certain so the devil anointed them to pick out the right ones amen he didn't know anybody listen to what he says certain other children israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown other words nathan and cora picked people with influence and he knew they got some influence on the other people so we need to pick the right ones to throw the influence the same pattern that the devil was using here it haven't changed today who are some of the most biggest influences it's preachers from the pulpit can we say man that's why the devil or not certain one of them to try to tear down this message what god given us this day not not just to anybody he wants somebody with some influence that they're known that's why i tell a preacher you need to humble yourself if god bless you got doors open for you you're able to go here you over go there you got to thank god for that but i'm here to tell you the more you go out the bigger target you come for the devil to get you to fall because that he know if he can get you to fall he can do damage you got to understand about something about satan satan is more interested in you he yeah he wants you to die he want to kill you but the devil is more interested in a backslider living than killing you and taking you to the grave he get more done through a backslider that is alive then this taking somebody's life you say oh where you going with that brother burly no now simpson why did they kill samson they didn't want to kill him they wanted to make sport out of him they just put his eyes out it wasn't more glory for them to see a defeated son of god still alive that was more glory for the devil that's so they didn't want to kill him they want to make mockery out of it that's why that's why the devil loved backsliders amen he loved people that are still alive and bring a reproach to this gospel so that other people can see it and discourage them so people be like wow this brother this system was going 20 years and now that i'm falling is this message right it's this gospel right i'm here to tell you this message is right i don't care if the whole world falls very well is gonna stand because i got the holy ghost and the holy ghost is a seal it'll keep you not from revival to revival it'll keep you until the day of your redemption that's what the holy ghost will do to you amen praise the lord so we're so thankful for that that's what the devil loves to do because the backslider the bible said is full of their own ways i don't personally don't even like talking to them because i got no time to hear their i already know they're full the bible tell me they're full of their own ways so what good is going to do me to sit down two or three hours listen to their ways as soon as i detect who they are say go you don't want no help we're here to help people not debate with them and you know when somebody wants help hey man some people just want company misery loves company can we say man i ain't got time for it my brothers and sisters but people have brought a declaration against god against this message declaring to god just like dayton and cora went to moses people doing the same thing they go i declare i want my independence the devil to deceive people so much that even when they leave the message they say the bible has come a new book to me no it has not yeah that's not the opening of the word make the bible a new book to us you don't reject it how can the bible come and do what the bible has now become veiled to you can we say praise the lord god open eyes the devil closes them yes sir declaring against god they rose up against moses gather themselves against moses and against aaron see that's the type against the prophet gets the priest so you're gonna have the same thing today they're gonna go against malachi 4 and they'll go against ministers that are trying to hold this message in a balance see today when you try to balance things that's when people get offended no it got to be a balance this message did not come to tempt the scales this message come to balance the skills it come to balance everything this message to balance your life come on now it'll balance your church it'll balance you because this is a balanced message praise the lord it's exactly right and you're wondering why a lot of things happening i don't get offended hey this is just like walking on a tightrope you know when you walk on a tightrope they use a stick you have seen the people using them sticks but if you notice they're not falling but it's a lot of movement in the stick why is that the stick is what helping them keep that balance so that's why we don't mind questions in the message when somebody asks this question this question we gonna study it and we start tossing it but we don't stop we keep moving because we're looking for that balance and we know god if you got the right attitude god will give you that balance yes he will he'll give it to you every time i'm so thankful for that world renowned famous in the congregation you see they already had pride thinking that there was something in the first place and i never knew exactly how to choose them that's why i humble myself that pride i'm gonna tell you something friend god know how to let pride out of your life he knows exactly how to suck it out of it whenever you get to a place you think you're something get ready for a fall i'm telling you these things from experiences i remember one time i gonna name the country i preached my heart out i really did at a service service was over a guy walked up to me he said a good service he said but you know i kind of like how your pastor preached you know michael t he said no that's kind of well the preaching that i like i said okay he said but it was a good service i walked off because i know i had a second service i walked off went in the room started studying come to the second service i remember the message i preached i preached a message called the truthiness of pentecost oh i preached my heart out of church jumping and i preach i preach i preach then when the surf was over the guy come up to me that's it that's what i'm talking about but when i went to my room god came and spoke directly to me he said you just preached to one person in that congregation to prove a point it let all my air out i got in the pulpit to prove a point and preach to one person even though the people was enjoying it i knew who i was preaching to to prove a point i got revelation too i can preach like michael t i can do it i can lay some things out but i learned from that i'll be me i'll preach exactly what he wants me to preach but he took god two times expect me good for my eyes to wake up another time it was at a youth meeting oh i preached i was young man i don't do that now a young fella boy i preach but paul i come out of that youth meeting chess all stuck out people was at the altar crying i come out it was a little boy came up to me he said hey yeah he said you're the most funniest preacher i ever heard in my life i said i just eased off and walked back god used a child to let me know i'm nothing without him god knows how to humble you he knows exactly that's why when i see people get dealing with high heads i said that's that's okay i believe that they're sons and daughters of god but did god know exactly where to stick the needle in you and let that air out of you he knows exactly how to do it see i'm just being honest some of you probably been through but you don't tell nobody but i'm just being honest god knows how to keep us humble because that's where power is at when you can humble yourself that's where the power is at right there but everybody want to be strong and brave and be known and forceful it's not all about their friends and we all it's all about giving god all of the glory and everything can we say praise the lord but there was a declaration that they actually bring against god for their independence moses did not choose god god chose moses the bible also said that god in the book of psalms it said god elevated moses moses did not elevate himself can we say ma'am god elevated brother branham brother branham did not elevate himself god is going to elevate his bride she's not going to elevate herself god is going to do it god is doing it can we say praise the lord so all these little things that are happening going on is all for a purpose and it's all for a reason but they don't have they don't brought a independent declaration spirit against the word of god that's what don't happen that's what's happening right now in this day can we say praise the lord i'm going to say this and i'll close we're living in a world all just thinking about this we live in a world of services it's a service for everything we got to have doctors nurses plumbers electrician it's a service for everything even the garbage man it's a service i begin to look in all of the things that for this uh society for the countries to move it got to be services to help this thing go i seen a video of the the garbage that they disposed daily in new york it's unbelievable daily not just one day daily so you and i certain day of the week you just pull your trash can out there there it goes they come and get it when institutes or whatever but that's a process all that stuff somebody had a service it goes so many different places before i get to where it's going that's a service i was thinking of this this country we wouldn't even be able to function without services because you got to have somebody to do something this and i i was shocked i was working on an individual house uh i'm pretty sure y'all got it up here too they got services they'll come to your house and change your oil in your car i said wow how lazy can you get now some people i know they do it's not because they're lazy because they don't have time cause some people are office people they just ain't got time to do it what i understand but i'm just like man what kind of service can i just think of right because they're out there they even got a laundry service you don't have to go to the laundry and take your clothes they come and get them take them iron them up and bring them right to you now we got uber we got all of these things services sir doordash all of these things but if we need all of these things so this uh society think and function god got something he need to he has a bride god has a five-fold ministry for us to be his servants his sons and daughters well we know we're his bride he's an israel servants we're his bride but god got you and me here so he could live through us to finish go to the message what is the holy ghost giving for he said it's for to finish the work the work that jesus did uh stopped it well at pentecost he said the holy ghost was given to the disciple so the ministry of jesus christ could continue on and that is the same reason why we have the holy ghost today so this ministry of jesus christ can continue on he doing it through us that's the reason why he give us the holy ghost he said the holy ghost is your comforter it's your rapture it's your salvation it's your peace it's your joy everything is in the holy ghost when you're born again you got it all just the same as a baby when it comes out of his mama wound though it's a baby everything is already in that baby to become a woman or a man fully grown it's in there but it has to grow the same as us being born again everything you have in you immediately when you're born again for the rapture is in you but still we have to grow daily in our walks with christ we grow daily can we say praise the lord amen and i believe we should grow daily i believe we should be able to look today and see something i grew a little higher from yesterday my thinking is a little different from yesterday hey man i think we should be able to reflect back on some things and we can see i have been growing by his grace is that right and you know so god has a bride regardless of all of the things that's happening he's going to have a people that's going to overcome all of these obstacles in this day because it's christ in us the hope of glory can we say amen i'ma say this some of you probably read this article uh about this uh airplane pilot falling asleep in his airplane i'ma paraphrase it i can't quite remember it word by word i was just reading it recently and it really stuck it really stuck to me it was these two lawyers and out in alaska and um i guess they were doing a case over there so they was getting ready to fly back to anchorage and they ran across a preacher a pilot and the pilot told them he said i could save you some money i got my own private plane i can take you back to anchorage now this lawyer guy he said how did he say he don't know why he agreed to do it from out of his best judgment he said the man talked them into it to get into the plane and said i'll fly you to anchorage he said he just did it of his best judgment then he said when he got there it went into the hangar seen the airplane airplane clean everything looking nice and stuff he said then it gets into the plane one of them sat in the back one of them sat in the front then the pilot takes off he said when they started flying the pilot said there are some clouds coming he said when i get in cloud he said i pass out now the lawyer thought he was actually joking he said it was a cloudy day that day i mean why do you even want to try this so when they got up there in the clouds he said he's looking at the man and then all of a sudden just assures the world the man passed out then the one that was sitting in the back he told them get the radio you know i can't remember the words that you they call it airplane language i don't it's a word that they use but he began to say help help help help but there was a plane in the area a cargo plane in the area picked up the help thing and he said y'all don't understand uh it it's some kind of word pilot talk and they said no sir he said we're on a plane and the pilot has passed out so the man that was in the freighter plane he said okay he said i'm going to go in a circle he said i'm going to go in a circle he's because if i keep i think he was heading to tokyo he said because if i keep flying he said i'm going to lose you he saw him a circle around he said the first thing i want to do is get you in contact with the uh what they call it is it flight command control tower he said i need to get you in contact with the control tower and then all of a sudden the control tower come on the plane and then the man said hello my name is so-and-so i'm calling you from the control tower he said yeah he said now understand you you got a situation he said you have a situation that the pilot has come passed out and they said yes he said now listen to me he said you gotta he's the one thing i got to get you to agree with he said what's that he said that you'll listen to my voice he said now you can't see me he's but i can see you first he said let me find where you're at so he looked at the radar he said now you can't see me he's but i can see you he said in four minutes you're gonna hit a mountain he said but if you listen to my voice he said i can get you home safe he said listen to my voice so all of a sudden uh i think he come back he got him away from the mountain when he got him away from the mountain and then he come back on the radio he said now you get ready to go through a bunch of clouds you know they can tell you all this stuff on them radar he said you get ready to go through a bunch of clouds he said it's going to get bumpy but what you still need to do is listen to my voice and the man said he was in the position he wasn't going to be like oh i got to listen to you he said oh no because in a situation like that you you'll be willing to listen to anything it's just like a drowning man you know a drowning man he'll drive he'll grab a toothpick if it floating right across and he'll reach and try to grab it so he said it's going to be bumpy it's going to be cloudy and i like what the man told him from the control place he said don't try to look at the storm he said because if you do you will die he said just listen to my voice and then all of a sudden he said that the man stopped talking to them now they're flying and he's bumping and bumping and bumping and they flying he said but then all of a sudden when all the bumping stopped they get out of the cloud he said the voice come back i said isn't that like our lord jesus christ sometimes you could be going through a bumpy storm but don't look at the storm you might can feel a lot of bumps and this going wrong that go wrong but don't look at that and then it'll seem like he ain't even there but faith should tell you he is there when that man said we didn't hear the voice for a while sometimes you don't hear god's voice for a while you want to hear it but you don't hear it you desire to hear it you don't hear it but that does not mean he is not there we know he is there because he promised and then all of a sudden when they went through all those bumps and storms he said then the voice came back on the radio while that man explaining all of this i'm looking at it totally different i said that's just like our lord when you went through something didn't understand why but when you don't made it through then he comes and speaks and then he tell you why this is why i let you go through that this is why this happened to you in our mind like lord why you just can't tell me up front what's going to go on that ain't the way he works because he got a test and he got to try your faith when jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word proceedeth out of the mouth of god if you really want the impact of what jesus was saying in that scripture you have to go back to numbers to get the impact of it because remember the conversation well he said moses didn't give you that bread he said but my father from heaven gave you that bread so that gives us the authority to go back to see what that happened and it happened in numbers but the impact of it was god had them out in the wilderness god knew they was going to get hungry none of this surprised god because the bible said god suffered them to hunger he permitted them to hunger because god wanted to displace some things then they start telling oh you know we hungry you brought us out here in this wilderness to die and so forth and then you know here's the thing god said you tell them come tomorrow it's going to be they're going to have quail they're going to have uh what they call it manna we know it's called manna but you got to catch it when god told them that he was going to send it he spoke through a prophet and told them how to gather it because if god wouldn't have gave instructions they would have just jumped in there to fight me no i want more give me give them a note god said today you only pick so much look how that is that's why man can't live by bread alone but every word the manna the quail what's the bread but to tell them how much they can pick up and which day they can do it what's the word god testing them is they gonna keep the word they could have eaten and said come on man you already don't start out here you can tell me i can only get so much mother told him said no he said you pick up so much today and then when you do that don't lean none over it'll rot now think about moses telling them that they're like yeah whatever whatever whatever but you know what the next day it stinks just like moses told them because they they tried to go against the word like it ain't gonna happen then moses tell them if you don't pick up so much today and you try to wait till the sabbath to do it it ain't going to be none seen their mind is dropped today you drop tomorrow you're going to have to drop again guess what if they didn't do the pick up what they posted done saturday come on savage day when they they they can't make it fall because god was in control so god was proving them my word is what i say not what you want to do what you think i am the one that's in control and they was not keeping god's commandment that's how god does things and this man the voice kept talking to him and then he told him in the plane he said you're going to begin to descend down he said you're going to see some lights he said they're going to be in the shape of a cross he said when you see those lights i want you to know them the one's gonna guide you home now he said took them a couple times to try to land the plane but it got landed but what gets me after they landed well he said as soon as they land the plane that's when the pilot wakes up that's interesting but he said they got him and they put him in a motel that night he said then later on that night they heard a knock at the door i thought the man name was dave a knock at the door when the man knocked at the door he opened the door the lawyer opened the door he said how you doing he said you're dave i think it was dave he said yes he said he said i know he said i've never seen you till now he's but i remember your voice now i can put a face to the voice he said because it was the voice that i listened to got me here that's what the scripture says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel god didn't want us to focus on what he looked like people want to know if god black is he white is he pale i said i said where in the scripture that god commanded us to focus and figure figure out what he looks like i said it ain't there i said god ain't interesting for us to know what he looked like he's interested enough for us to lead and know what his word says was a fan you want to debate over color and all that's not bernie williams that's why he's in his word i said but if you really want to know what color god is i said you really want to know i can help you with that they said what do you mean i said whatever country you go to whoever was born again in that country that's god's color because that's god dwelling in them god dwelling in his bride if you want to know what color god is he wants us to hear this voice see it's not the fact listening to a tape hearing brother bannon's voice that ain't it it's the voice that's behind the voice because many people hear tapes every day still don't hear the message they don't hear what's behind the voice that's why you get those say well brother branham said just a man just a man no no no no i go back to the message unseen the uh the uns i can't even remember the title but you know the one that when god took over brother bread and body no looking to the unseen he said this this is not william branham this is a vessel that surrendered to me i'm using his voice god was behind the voice that's what i listened for jesus said my sheep will know my voice jesus was not talking about his literal voice because we don't have a clue what jesus voice sounded like his voice is in his word that's what he wants us to hear the people that brought a declaration of independence to god in this age and i'm here to tell them they're going to lose they're going to lose paul told him he said i seen your superstition to these inscriptions you got to this unknown god but that god that you talk upon so i got a declaration cause i want to declare him to you false i want to declare this god to you in other words paul said i'm going to make him known to you how did paul do it through the word because god was inside of paul god is in his bride how many of you believe the final voice is in the bride i believe that with all my heart that's why they ought to make us humble ourselves i never in my life and this time in the mess have seen so much attacks on marriages it's just happening everywhere attack on marriages because that's the devil the devil hates healthy marriages he can't stand it naturally or spiritual satan can not stand it but i'm here to tell i would challenge anybody you tell me you're born again you're born again your wife born again both of y'all born again now tell me why you got problems because the holy ghost inside of you will take you to the word and correct you it will correct you see we spend so much time trying to correct one another but not letting the word correct both of us the holy ghost will correct you in the word but selfishness in marriage is what kills them selfishness lack of communication finances all of these things kills a marriage and i promise you because they're not both relying on god for all those things if you don't know how to communicate with your wife i can help you with that easy go back to it when you was courtney you was willing to talk huh you was willing to talk because you want to convince her i'm the man didn't get married you okay why are you not talking and then man i got you now you should never stop that communication because if we don't communicate with one another in the marriage somebody's going to communicate with you and it's going to be old diablo exactly right he's going to communicate in your mind because he loves to tear up marriages healthy communication it just missed the devils up in marriage it messes him up huh i was just preaching at another church man i think i don't know if i offend him or not but i was being honest i said you know i said around the message we tell lies yeah oh i said i'm explaining to you friend that's when you asked your wife are you okay she said yeah and she knows she's not okay you asked her are you okay yeah and he know he's not okay you asked him again ain't nothing wrong with you no you ask again you sure ain't nothing wrong with you no what makes you think something is wrong with me when we are going to tell the truth now that's different if you're going through something but your faith don't come to a level you see the end that's different you can say i'm fine nothing wrong with me but when you know something wrong with you and you need your prayer partner you need your wife or your husband to help you through it you might always tell the truth yes i'm struggling i got a problem i'm going through something i know we don't want to um and it's hard for me to do that because we want to be macho you're going to say nah i'm going to show no weakness to my wife i want to know she got a strong man let me tell you show me a weak humble man that's a strong man that'll be willing to tell his wife his faults and his errors and so forth because he said hey i need you to pray for me listen what the prophet told about this woman this woman told her husband if you go out there and you mess up she should come back home i'll be waiting on you you our mind oh no i can't don't come back don't you come back here but i believe this by him telling her that and him seeing what kind of woman he got he would say how dare i even mess up with such a woman like this nah even though she would be waiting for me i ain't gonna mess up because this is a good woman that's exactly right but today nobody don't want to communicate we communicate with everybody else you know what most people that they might communicate with facebook more than they do that in life facebook i call it the vent television everybody want to vent vent vent when they should be catching the carriage upon jesus casting all your cares upon jesus all these things that wrapped up traps you're gonna use the wrong way and then you people put so much stuff on facebook and then you might go to a meeting you might see the person say are you okay and then we're like why are you asking me that oh the post that you posted i just want to know how you overcome that see all your information out there and you can be getting mad what's wrong with you you think i'm a weak christian whatever yeah you put it out there you created that they just responded praise the lord it's just the truth give me say amen give me give the lord a hand may god bless you tonight i'll start right there but this is what i want to help you just get this little short little thought that's in my heart that is the spirit of laodicea she had written a declaration of independence against the word of god saying i'm a widow i have need of nothing i'm going to live the way i want this is my rights these are my inalienable rights that's what they have told the lord jesus christ but the bride says lord i have no rights i let them all down lord because i want with what your word says for me about me to me that's what i want so i give myself away people are saying that someone i give myself away i give myself away that ought to be a true song that we literally just give ourselves away to it this is where it's supposed to be so he can't use us god said give me go give me give it get get come on give me give me you give it to me let me fix it i was talking to a guy i said i got a phone call i was telling brother paul [Music] four o'clock monday morning my phone rang and i answered it it was somebody i didn't even know he was a young boy he said sir i hate to call you this time of night he's about the demons the demons are trying to take me he said somebody gave me your card with your number on it he said and i kept it in my wallet he said something told me get it and call you he said i'm hoping i'm not disturbing i said friend when it comes to something like this there's no disturbance and he began to talk about the things he done and all of those things i said listen somebody tell you something young man there's nothing you can do there's no life you can live so low there's nothing you can jump into and just i don't care how horrible it is but god can't turn it around i said god can turn it around the only thing i know god can't fix is blasphemy but anything else god can fix it god specializes in taking the worst situations and turn them around that's how god does things can we say amen you and i god has given us the word of the hour and brother burnham said the word of god defeats the devil and satan can't stand it it's the word but that word has to be in you and come out of you and know how to withstand this devil that we're fighting so i told this young boy he began to talk about his daddy all his problems bitterness all of those things and i listened to him because i wanted him to talk and i said let me tell you something young man [Music] i said my daddy killed my mother when i was seven and i said i was in her lap when he did it i said when i gave my house heart to the lord we was able to lead him to the lord jesus christ i said when god come in my heart i couldn't hate my daddy because god changed me and just telling that boy that he said thank you now i see that there's hope for me for all of the things that i've done i wanted him to see all of this bitterness and stuff that you're doing in your life you just you just the devil want to keep you in that shape that's what the devil want to do bitter hating unforgiveness and then and payback revenge the devil want to keep people to them states but when you experience the love of god you can't hate you don't want revenge you don't want to pay back you let it all go because you know he forgave you when you experience forgiveness you can give forgiveness when you can see what jesus does for you can we say man because every one of us deserve to go to hell every one of us deserve to go to hell is that right there was a story this is a slave time a boy was found guilty and they was going to kill it [Music] but in that country before they can hang the slave the bell got a ring [Music] and the day that he was to get home his mother went the night before and climbed up in the bed they put the rope around his neck and then the man should pull the rope pull it he tried to ring the bell the bell wouldn't ring because she was in between it and was bumping her and then the man said something wrong with the bell he said pull it a little harder they started yanking on the bell harder harder harder the bell went right and then that man said according to our custom we're gonna have to let this boy go free and then when they let him go free his mama fell out of the bell i'm so thankful for the blood of jesus christ and when the devil went to take my life when the devil wanted to kill me but because of calvary the bell couldn't reign i thank god for that what we need to do more and more in our lives every day fall in love with jesus because the more you fall in love with him all the things of this world just begin to vanish away and then you begin to realize my savior my redeemer and all the rest of this stuff is just a bunch of nonsense that's what it is may the lord bless you this evening better just sing a free version of that song i'm not a singer but that's what we need to do is give ourself away [Music]
