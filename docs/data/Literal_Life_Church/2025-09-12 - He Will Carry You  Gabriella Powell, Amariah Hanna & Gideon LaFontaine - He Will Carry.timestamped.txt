[0:00] [Music]
[0:18] Do you ever find yourself
[0:21] asking God where he's been?
[0:24] [Music]
[0:26] ever get up out of bed saying, "I can't
[0:30] do this again."
[0:32] [Music]
[0:34] Have you ever been afraid of what
[0:38] tomorrow's going to bring?
[0:42] And you're facing it alone. At least
[0:45] that's what you think.
[0:50] I can tell you after going through that
[0:53] valley,
[0:55] even though I didn't see it at the time,
[0:59] it was in my weakest moments that he
[1:01] held me. And they know you'll find he
[1:06] will carry you when you can't go on. He
[1:10] will be your strength when your strength
[1:13] is gone. He will lift you up. He will be
[1:16] enough
[1:19] to get you through.
[1:22] When the road is long and you want to
[1:25] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[1:28] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[1:32] into his arms.
[1:34] [Music]
[1:37] He will carry you.
[1:39] [Music]
[1:43] And when you get the kind of news that
[1:46] you hoped you'd never hear.
[1:51] And when you're chasing down a dream
[1:54] just to watch it disappear.
[1:59] And when somebody that you love
[2:02] turns and walks away.
[2:07] and they leave you standing there
[2:10] with shattered
[2:12] faith.
[2:15] You don't have to pick up all the broken
[2:18] pieces.
[2:19] You don't have to try to cover up the
[2:22] scars. You are loved and you can always
[2:25] run to Jesus
[2:27] just as you are. He will carry you when
[2:32] you can't go on. He will be your
[2:36] strength. When your strength is gone, he
[2:39] will lift you up. He will be enough
[2:44] to get you through.
[2:46] When the road is long and you want to
[2:49] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[2:53] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[2:57] into his arms.
[3:02] He will carry you.
[3:08] His Lord is never weary.
[3:12] No, he's never tired. Through the
[3:15] toughest fight, through the longest
[3:18] night, through the fight and through the
[3:21] fight,
[3:24] he will carry you when you can't go on.
[3:29] He'll be your strength. When your
[3:31] strength is gone, he will lift you up.
[3:34] He will be enough
[3:38] to get you through.
[3:40] When the road is long and you want to
[3:44] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[3:47] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[3:51] into his arms.
[3:56] He will carry you.
[4:02] Oh, he will carry you.
[4:08] [Music]
[4:16] [Applause]
