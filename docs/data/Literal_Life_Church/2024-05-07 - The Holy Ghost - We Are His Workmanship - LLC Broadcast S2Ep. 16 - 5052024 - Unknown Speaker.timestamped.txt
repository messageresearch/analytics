[4:26] found fir Foundation
[4:30] my God you are
[4:32] [Music]
[4:34] found my God you
[4:37] are of
[4:40] foundation my God you
[4:45] are Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8 for
[4:49] by grace are ye saved through faith and
[4:54] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[4:57] God there is nothing
[5:00] that we contribute when it comes to the
[5:02] gift of Salvation And the gift of the
[5:05] Holy Ghost there's nothing that we
[5:06] contribute it's a gift of
[5:09] God not of Works lest any man should
[5:12] boast that's why God has set it up this
[5:15] way because if we had a part in it then
[5:17] we would boast and we would take our
[5:19] part and probably glory in that but it's
[5:21] not of any of our works that we receive
[5:23] any of this from God anything that God
[5:26] does in us whether it's salvation or
[5:28] whether it's whether it's uh
[5:30] sanctification or whether it's he uh
[5:33] blesses us in a certain whatever it is
[5:35] the Holy Ghost it all is a gift of God
[5:38] and it's not by our works at all how
[5:40] many know
[5:41] that for we are his workmanship you're
[5:45] not your own workmanship you're not
[5:48] working on
[5:49] yourself when you come into the kingdom
[5:51] of God in his presence you have to know
[5:54] we are completely his workmanship from
[5:57] day one until he finishes the the work
[5:59] and how many know the scripture he he
[6:02] who hath begun a good work will he's the
[6:05] one that will finish it so he is he he
[6:08] is the one that's T that that that has
[6:11] all of this we are his workmanship
[6:15] created in Christ Jesus un good works so
[6:19] this is not just a a Reformation this is
[6:23] not just m god making you better this is
[6:27] a creation we are created in how many
[6:30] know that Jesus is a
[6:32] Creator how many know he created the
[6:34] heavens and the Earth the same creator
[6:38] that created the heavens and the Earth
[6:40] is creating something in
[6:43] you you are his new
[6:46] creation so you the reason I keep
[6:49] emphasizing this before I even preach
[6:51] this morning is that we've got to see
[6:53] that we are his workmanship and we are
[6:55] his creation and what he does is not
[6:58] just a little work it's actually him
[7:00] creating something in you the creator
[7:03] has come into your life and he's
[7:04] creating and anything good that comes
[7:07] out of you that's of God he created it
[7:09] in
[7:10] you looks at it a different way for we
[7:13] are his workmanship created in Christ
[7:15] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[7:18] before ordained that we should walk in
[7:21] them and anybody says there's no truth
[7:23] to predestination it's all through the
[7:25] Bible it's right there that we have been
[7:27] ordained before the foundation of the
[7:29] world world that we should walk in the
[7:31] manifestation of Christ on this Earth
[7:33] but it's not because of your works it's
[7:35] not because of you getting better it's
[7:37] not because your own efforts it's
[7:39] because he's creating in you what he's
[7:42] going to
[7:43] do we are his workmanship now the last
[7:47] time we ministered we talked about the
[7:50] Holy Ghost a little bit and I'm going to
[7:52] continue that series and uh we laid a
[7:55] foundation in speaking about the Holy
[7:57] Ghost uh called the Simplicity of Christ
[8:00] Paul said I fear that your minds would
[8:03] be corrupted from the Simplicity of
[8:05] Christ and so I I laid that Foundation
[8:07] I'll just have a little bit more of that
[8:09] today because that's before we talk
[8:11] about the Holy Ghost what is it how do
[8:13] we know that we have it before we get
[8:15] into those things I I I want us I wanted
[8:18] to speak about the Simplicity of Christ
[8:20] because the enemy takes something so
[8:23] precious as this and he wants to confuse
[8:25] it more than any other doctrinal subject
[8:27] he like to confuse this because because
[8:29] this is your experience this is this is
[8:31] your uh walk with God this is the reason
[8:34] you have a walk with God is because the
[8:36] Holy Ghost comes into your life and so
[8:38] if he can mess that up he wants to do it
[8:40] but I wanted to simp so in my series on
[8:42] the Holy Ghost that's my foundation and
[8:44] effort to simplify it so even the
[8:47] youngest child can understand it because
[8:50] the devil has complicated it may God
[8:52] help me to to bring it that this the
[8:55] youngest child could understand it the
[8:58] Simplicity that's in Jesus Jesus Christ
[9:00] so it's really this that there is a
[9:02] promise of God I want to simplify it
[9:04] there is a promise of God given for your
[9:07] life to give you his Spirit within you
[9:11] the power of God for this life and to
[9:14] transfor transport you into the next
[9:16] life so I want to say it again there's a
[9:19] promise of God given for your life to
[9:22] give you his Spirit within you which is
[9:25] the power of God for this life to live
[9:28] in this life and then to transport you
[9:30] into the next life guess what it's not
[9:33] any more complicated than what I just
[9:37] said sir should I say it again go ahead
[9:41] there's a promise it's your
[9:44] promise it's a promise God has given for
[9:46] your life that he would put his Spirit
[9:49] within you and that will be the power of
[9:51] God for this life and the power to get
[9:53] us in the life to come it's not any more
[9:55] complicated than that amen can you say
[9:58] Amen amen so you know when you when you
[10:01] speak about the Holy Ghost then you you
[10:04] realize the world has messed up the term
[10:06] even ghost would be scary because the
[10:08] world is messed it up and we realize
[10:10] that that's not the way we look at when
[10:12] the scripture says the Holy Ghost people
[10:14] uh don't know the real meaning of it the
[10:17] church the churches today and the the
[10:19] new Bibles that are written they tend to
[10:21] lose the Ghost part and they call it the
[10:23] Holy Spirit which is the same thing but
[10:26] they like to lose the Ghost part because
[10:27] that's too scary for kids and that's
[10:29] just to it doesn't fit in our culture I
[10:32] like to use the Bible
[10:34] terms it's just if you don't understand
[10:37] it and and so you could say if you read
[10:39] Webster's Dictionary it says this the
[10:41] ghost is the spirit of a dead man well
[10:43] that's his his thing but you see if
[10:45] you're more specific about the meaning
[10:46] of ghost it's the spirit of a living
[10:49] person without a flesh body so that's
[10:51] why it's termed the Holy Ghost it's the
[10:54] spirit of a person that's living can you
[10:56] say Amen that is doesn't have a bot form
[10:59] but is able to come in another bodily
[11:02] form by pouring himself into the people
[11:04] so that's why it's called the Holy Ghost
[11:07] the Holy One of Israel the Holy One of
[11:09] God the the person of Jesus Christ so
[11:12] this Holy Ghost is a person it's it's a
[11:15] living person it's the holy person of
[11:18] Christ the word that came out from God
[11:21] in the beginning uh uh and wherever you
[11:24] see God like for example in the Old
[11:26] Testament whenever you see God and he
[11:28] moves on the situation and most of all
[11:30] he moves on prophets to speak the word
[11:33] because the the the person of Christ is
[11:36] the word can you say man he came out in
[11:38] the beginning in the beginning was the
[11:40] word and the Word was with God it was
[11:42] the word the logos that came out of God
[11:46] and then we see them throughout him
[11:47] throughout history in the Old Testament
[11:49] moving upon the prophets there's a
[11:51] scripture that says holy men of old were
[11:54] moved by the Holy Ghost so back there it
[11:57] was the Holy Ghost and it always always
[11:59] moved into the prophet for that age to
[12:02] speak the word for the age so remember
[12:04] something about the Holy Ghost it'll
[12:06] never work outside of the word for the
[12:09] age it is sent to make alive the word
[12:13] for the age and to make it live in the
[12:15] people that's what the Holy Ghost was
[12:17] sent for so that's why you see them in
[12:19] the Old Testament with all the prophets
[12:20] and there they are and God moves on them
[12:23] by the Holy Ghost to speak that word for
[12:25] their age this is what the term the holy
[12:28] ghost means when every you see God in
[12:29] the Old Testament you see that person of
[12:32] Christ working there to bring his word
[12:35] to pass for that age but in the New
[12:38] Testament that person was not just to
[12:41] anoint prophets but to set Abode in the
[12:44] soul of man or of a woman and guess what
[12:48] he did
[12:51] it he fulfilled it the same holy ghost
[12:54] that moved upon prophets in the Old
[12:56] Testament now it moves to the New
[12:58] Covenant it would not be just anointing
[13:00] them to speak the word it would not be
[13:02] just a h uh making uh David shout and
[13:06] dance the way he did it wouldn't just be
[13:08] something outward but he would move now
[13:11] into the very Soul the control tower of
[13:14] man that same Holy Ghost would move to a
[13:16] different thing and why could he come
[13:18] into your soul because Calvary had come
[13:21] because if you were born with the nature
[13:23] you're born with the Holy Ghost couldn't
[13:24] sit there it's too holy can you say man
[13:28] there was no way that the Holy Ghost
[13:30] could sit at your soul level you were
[13:32] born in sin can you say im you had the
[13:35] the the nature of the serpent from the
[13:37] beginning you were born with that but if
[13:39] he could go to Calvary and and do away
[13:41] with sin and a person receives it then
[13:44] you make a place for the spirit of God
[13:46] himself the Holy Ghost to dwell in your
[13:49] life that's what the Holy Ghost is and
[13:52] so now in the New Testament he sets his
[13:54] Abode in the soul of man or woman and he
[13:57] did it and guess what he still doing it
[14:01] that's why I say this morning to
[14:03] everyone including the young people it's
[14:05] something you should never be afraid of
[14:07] it's the greatest priority in life that
[14:10] you seek and you say God I want this
[14:12] promise for me I see it in my pastor I
[14:16] see it in my parents but I want it for
[14:20] me most important thing in your life
[14:22] more important than jobs and money and
[14:24] career and marrying a wife or husband
[14:26] it's more important than anything that
[14:28] you say Lord this promise is for
[14:31] me praise the lord it's a promise that
[14:34] he will live in you and when a heart
[14:36] says I see it I'm asking for it I'm
[14:39] seeking it that promise is mine too I
[14:41] see that it's for me and then he gives
[14:44] it it it's you know friends it's not any
[14:46] more complicated than what I just said a
[14:49] heart says I see it I want it it's my
[14:52] promise I'll receive it and he's more
[14:54] willing to give it to you than you're
[14:56] even willing can you say amen and he
[14:58] says I'll come to a heart like that I'll
[15:00] draw a heart like that I'll come to that
[15:02] heart that's open he doesn't want to
[15:04] complicate this experience of the Holy
[15:07] Ghost it's man that's complicated
[15:12] it but we learn that Satan is the author
[15:15] of confusion and especially confusing
[15:17] the Holy Ghost to take the simple things
[15:19] of God and do all that he can to keep
[15:22] people from it so be and you got to
[15:25] realize also about Satan that he has a
[15:28] history of when he knows something's
[15:30] coming to try to stop it he he steps out
[15:33] in front of it and particularly at times
[15:36] when a birth was coming a very important
[15:37] birth Moses birth was very important so
[15:40] now he moves upon pharaoh to kill all
[15:42] the children you got to look at Satan's
[15:45] nature and that is I'm gonna I want to
[15:47] be there at the point of
[15:50] birth I'd like to stop it I'd like to
[15:53] confuse it I'd like to disrupt it he
[15:55] would love to stop it at the point of
[15:58] birth that I can con refuse that person
[16:00] or that I can kill and so at the that
[16:02] birth of Moses and the birth of Jesus
[16:04] Christ this is what Satan did at the
[16:07] point of birth at the moment of birth
[16:09] he's trying to stop
[16:11] it I would say his nature is the same
[16:14] way
[16:14] today and that's why there's a confusion
[16:17] about the experience of the Lord and a
[16:19] true experience of connecting with him
[16:22] that God baptizes you with his spirit
[16:24] and your desires are changed from the
[16:26] things of the world to the things of God
[16:28] and you love the word I the greatest
[16:31] evidence in my life has been I love the
[16:33] word of God I have no resistance in my
[16:36] soul to any of the word of God and I got
[16:40] that because it's 16 years old he
[16:42] replaced it with a serpent nature what's
[16:44] the serpent nature it wants to serve the
[16:46] world but it also wants to worship its
[16:48] own way Cain wanted to worship but he
[16:51] wanted to worship God his own way when
[16:53] you're born with that many of you want
[16:55] to worship but you want to do it your
[16:57] own way most of the church world are
[17:00] worshiping God their own
[17:02] way a lot of the music is C worship it's
[17:06] worshiping the way they want to worship
[17:08] I'm going to sing about the cross but
[17:10] I'm going to live any way I want to live
[17:12] I'm going to have my tattoos in my
[17:14] earrings I'm going to blast out the rock
[17:16] and roll can you say Amen because it's
[17:18] Cain worship but God when he brings a
[17:21] new birth old things pass away All
[17:24] Things become new and we're not
[17:26] manifesting the world anymore we're man
[17:28] manes in Christ Satan is confusing it he
[17:32] tries to stop it at the moment of birth
[17:34] then to try to copy so if he can't stop
[17:37] it at the new birth then he we then you
[17:39] try to uh he tries to copy or imitate
[17:42] the manifestations of the Holy Ghost and
[17:44] tries to copy the gifts tries to point
[17:47] us to a sign or a gift or an emotion as
[17:49] the evidence and to get people to trust
[17:52] in the wrong thing avoiding the real New
[17:54] Birth avoiding uh the the real change
[17:57] people gravitate towards the Manifest
[17:58] inations of the Holy Ghost rather than
[18:00] the Holy Ghost himself as a person
[18:03] coming into your life that becomes
[18:05] confusion as well the confusion that he
[18:07] points the people to depend on a sign or
[18:10] to bend on a gift or depend on an
[18:11] emotion as an evidence that you
[18:13] personally have it all those things are
[18:15] manifestations of the Holy Ghost and we
[18:18] see them but they're not to be used as
[18:20] an evidence that you have
[18:23] it and so this creates confusion when I
[18:26] go into this series I want to show you
[18:27] when he the Holy G ghost be descends
[18:29] upon a generation there's a lot of
[18:32] things that God will do but there's
[18:35] there's few in there that's actually
[18:37] getting what the Holy Ghost was sent
[18:40] for it's on the inside people
[18:43] gravitating to what the Holy Ghost is
[18:45] doing on the outside but remember I said
[18:47] a couple Sundays ago I was saying that
[18:49] it's from the inside out God's work God
[18:53] works so the real there's a there's a
[18:55] reference to the Holy Spirit when Jesus
[18:58] said
[19:00] in the last day of the feast I don't
[19:02] have it in front of me but in the last
[19:03] day of the feast he says he said the the
[19:06] the spirit will come and he says out of
[19:08] your belly shall flow rivers of Living
[19:11] Water so that that uh word picture is
[19:15] something coming from the inside of you
[19:17] going
[19:19] out and then the next scripture says
[19:21] this is referring to the spirit when it
[19:24] comes so when the spirit comes it's
[19:27] actually going to be a work I know know
[19:28] it says they were in the upper room and
[19:30] they all filled with the Holy Ghost
[19:31] because they emptied out but really
[19:33] what's intended to do is it's going to
[19:34] work from the inside out not the outside
[19:37] in and so that which is down there will
[19:39] like be like a rivers of living water
[19:41] flowing from your in innermost being so
[19:46] now we have a distinction it's on the
[19:48] inside so we have to be grown up we have
[19:50] to be mature in the Lord to realize the
[19:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost really in a
[19:55] person's life is not something they're
[19:57] graving gravitating or something out the
[19:59] outside but it's something that's coming
[20:01] from the inside out not the outside in
[20:05] and that's why he says it's the inside
[20:07] it's the inside we will go through that
[20:09] at length at at another time because
[20:12] when the Holy Ghost begins to move many
[20:14] people in fact I'm going to read to you
[20:17] when we get to it I'm going to read to
[20:18] you the first time the Holy Ghost begins
[20:20] to be mentioned in the Book of Matthew
[20:22] and that's the B it's at the conception
[20:24] of Jesus Christ he starts using the term
[20:28] and so
[20:29] uh Simeon and Hannah and uh Joseph
[20:34] receives a dream and he tells him what's
[20:37] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so
[20:39] that's the first time we hear the term
[20:40] mentioned and it's around it's around
[20:43] the birth of
[20:44] Christ it says
[20:46] something so it's it's not coming just
[20:49] to anoint a prophet now it's not coming
[20:50] to give a feeling now it's coming
[20:52] specifically to bring that conception to
[20:55] bring forth the word and so now but
[20:58] you'll have people affected people
[21:00] having dreams people being shown by the
[21:02] Holy Ghost it says he was shown by the
[21:04] Holy Ghost this is the Messiah the Holy
[21:05] Ghost showed him that so but you see now
[21:08] everybody was receiving some of the
[21:10] benefits of the Holy Ghost coming in
[21:12] that era and that time but only one
[21:15] person is conceiving the Holy Ghost
[21:17] Inside
[21:18] them so the Holy Ghost can do a lot of
[21:21] effect people can feel better after a
[21:24] service even like this people can feel
[21:27] better just by being being in the
[21:29] atmosphere of the Holy
[21:31] Ghost people can have dreams people can
[21:34] they can have a lot of things can be
[21:36] done but in that day it was only Mary
[21:40] that had the depth of the Holy Ghost
[21:42] conceiving a new life Christ within
[21:47] her so now we draw a distinction because
[21:50] that's going to come from the inside out
[21:52] that's not going to be see she's trying
[21:54] to produce something that's going to be
[21:56] that a life started within her a new
[21:59] life is growing within
[22:03] her everybody still
[22:06] awake and she couldn't stop
[22:09] it and it was without sensation she
[22:13] wasn't with a man it wasn't carnal
[22:15] wasn't a sexual experience it was the
[22:17] Holy Ghost without
[22:19] sensation she didn't feel anything she
[22:21] just said Let It Be unto me according to
[22:24] Thy word bang something she didn't feel
[22:26] any of it but a conception started a new
[22:30] life was in her now after a few months
[22:33] as some of her sisters being pregnant
[22:35] then you start to see wow there's
[22:38] another life growing within her that's
[22:41] why I say about the Holy
[22:42] Ghost sometimes you wait to see the
[22:44] fruit from it you wait to see the life
[22:47] that comes see if the desires are
[22:50] changed because you can tell you
[22:51] couldn't tell anything was changed with
[22:53] with Mary until it started to grow she
[22:56] realized the baby starts kicking all
[22:59] these things begin to happen and you
[23:00] realize there's been a change because
[23:02] there's a new life that's growing inside
[23:03] me praise the Lord now we're talking
[23:06] what the Holy Ghost really wants to do
[23:08] from the inside out a new life Christ
[23:12] being formed in you that's the Holy
[23:16] Ghost Beyond an emotion Beyond enjoying
[23:19] the benefits you can be around a
[23:21] congregation and enjoy the benefits for
[23:22] your children and families just by being
[23:24] around the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[23:27] but do you have it for
[23:30] yourself is New Life conceived in you
[23:32] and is it
[23:34] growing when you have a new life inside
[23:36] of you how can you tell something's
[23:38] happening with a mom sometimes that
[23:40] something's different she gets cravings
[23:41] for things and Foods she never had
[23:43] cravings for before you will get a
[23:45] craving for the word of God like never
[23:47] before I never had this before I crave I
[23:50] want to be there at church I want to
[23:52] hear I want to get in my Bible it's an
[23:54] Evidence something has changed I want it
[23:56] for myself I want to be fed by this word
[23:58] yes and the and the Cravings come and
[24:01] you have to go sometimes at 3: in the
[24:03] morning and get that wife what she
[24:05] needs my fir the first baby with Beck
[24:08] and I was
[24:09] Seafood all the time seafood seafood we
[24:12] don't do that anymore but with that baby
[24:13] she craved Seafood so we were at Red
[24:15] Lobster all the time feel like I should
[24:17] own stock in Red
[24:19] Lobster I should
[24:22] have every baby had a different craving
[24:26] some of them I like some of them I
[24:27] didn't like
[24:30] I think it was it was Solomon or Gideon
[24:33] there and the craving was hot fudge cake
[24:35] at Big Boy I love that
[24:39] one that was awesome even if it was 3 in
[24:42] the morning it tasted great we went
[24:44] we're
[24:45] going cuz she couldn't finish all of
[24:55] it
[24:56] so we'll get back to that a little bit
[24:59] on the inside but I want to uh start
[25:01] wrapping it up just on this point he
[25:03] said all the father have given will come
[25:07] predestination clears confusion of the
[25:09] Holy Ghost it should and that is his
[25:13] sons and daughters will
[25:16] come now see we we have to take a rest
[25:19] in that not a rest that we could become
[25:21] lazy to seek the Holy Ghost but AR rest
[25:24] that all the father has already given
[25:27] will
[25:29] come God prepares the heart to receive
[25:32] the Holy
[25:35] Ghost this isn't a mechanical thing of
[25:38] our own
[25:39] works but we are his
[25:43] workmanship I'm glad this morning that
[25:45] I'm his
[25:47] workmanship and if I'm under the
[25:49] Potter's hand why are we so worried
[25:51] about what we don't
[25:54] have why are we so afraid of what we're
[25:57] lacking if I'm under his workmanship he
[26:00] will create in me what is needed I'm
[26:02] under the
[26:04] Creator lift up Christ and he said I'll
[26:07] draw all men unto me it's in everyone's
[26:10] own time can you say Amen what the worst
[26:13] case is God's Not drawing that person
[26:15] yet the worst case is to force that
[26:17] person to try to mechanically do
[26:19] something we encourage them we tell them
[26:21] what they need in their lives if their
[26:23] life is just full of all kinds of
[26:25] messing around with sin and porn and and
[26:28] and you you tell them as a pastor you
[26:30] need something you need the holy ghost
[26:31] in your life but never to force them
[26:33] because if that heart's not drawn by God
[26:35] they're not
[26:38] ready but I do believe if they'll begin
[26:40] to say Lord and ask say Lord I know I
[26:43] need this if they'll begin to say that
[26:45] God's all over it if we know the Lord is
[26:47] in our lives drawing our hearts if this
[26:49] morning I just want to simplify this and
[26:52] say if you've got a calling if you got
[26:54] something down there that's still
[26:56] drawing you and saying I need need more
[26:58] of God you should raise your hand and
[27:00] say thank God that I have that a lot of
[27:02] you you shouldn't be here things have
[27:04] happened in your you've have lost loved
[27:05] ones and all that and yet and you've had
[27:07] struggles and you've questioned God and
[27:09] you've questioned why did this happen I
[27:11] I I Pastor you I know some of those
[27:13] things and it's sometimes it can be so
[27:15] real the devil can really get you off
[27:16] track is this worth it all these other
[27:18] thoughts come all that but listen let's
[27:21] try to let's try to look at what God is
[27:23] doing in our lives that there's some
[27:25] reason that something deep down is reson
[27:28] and saying I know that I can't ever
[27:31] leave Christ and if you're in the hands
[27:33] of the Creator his
[27:36] workmanship I bet none of us in this
[27:38] church this morning could deny and say I
[27:41] I'm not under the hand of God I'm under
[27:43] the his work I bet everybody could raise
[27:45] your hand and say I believe that I'm
[27:47] under his
[27:49] workmanship and if he's in charge if
[27:51] he's under if he's in charge of molding
[27:55] your life then everything you lack you
[27:57] just offer a heart before God you just
[28:00] say Lord whatever Brother Paul's
[28:02] preaching on the holy ghost or any other
