[4:24] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[4:27] even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon
[4:29] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[4:32] fell though a host should encamp against
[4:34] me my heart shall not fear though War
[4:37] should rise against me in this will I be
[4:40] confident one thing I have desired of
[4:42] the Lord that I will seek after that I
[4:45] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[4:47] the days of my life I tell you this
[4:50] experience with the Lord and where David
[4:52] wanted to live is not a one year at
[4:54] Camp's experience it's not once a week
[4:56] at church he said this is the one thing
[4:59] I desire in my life and that is I'd seek
[5:01] after this and that's to dwell in the
[5:04] presence of the Lord every day of my
[5:06] life can you say amen and so and to
[5:09] behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire
[5:11] in his Temple for in the time of trouble
[5:14] he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[5:17] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[5:20] me he shall set me up upon a rock and
[5:23] now shall mine head be lifted up above
[5:27] mine enemies round about me therefore
[5:30] will I offer in his Tabernacle
[5:33] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[5:36] sing praises unto the Lord I want to
[5:40] speak a little bit out of Psalms 27 and
[5:42] I want to title this hide me in this
[5:44] time of trouble hide me in this time of
[5:47] trouble David is the only one that used
[5:50] this term four or five times in his
[5:52] writings uh besides job and uh he just
[5:55] says those words hide me and uh he asked
[5:58] God God hide me hide me and I'm only one
[6:02] of the reasons I'm preaching this is
[6:04] because that's why that's the way I have
[6:06] felt lately and that is Lord just hide
[6:08] me just hide me there's a certain
[6:11] protection can you say amen and so he
[6:14] asked the Lord but I I was looking at it
[6:16] uh the last couple days and it seems a
[6:19] bit mysterious if you don't understand
[6:21] why David is saying hide me it seems a
[6:24] bit mysterious because we know that
[6:26] David is a warrior David was a fighter
[6:29] David from his very young years as a
[6:32] teen was had faith in God and he wasn't
[6:36] afraid of anything he proved himself to
[6:39] be unafraid of the enemy since he was a
[6:41] little boy so if we were to use the
[6:43] context of him saying Lord hide me my
[6:46] enemies are encamped about me hide me it
[6:48] doesn't seem like it's the right thing
[6:50] for David to say because he doesn't look
[6:52] like somebody that would hide from the
[6:54] enemy he actually ran towards
[6:57] Goliath he didn't have have a problem of
[7:00] being afraid of the enemy and it it just
[7:02] seems mysterious that he would say Lord
[7:05] hide me from the enemy they're encamped
[7:07] about me and and and there's and there's
[7:09] there's I feel it moving in and
[7:12] approaching them to me kind of like we
[7:14] feel in the time we live in and so he
[7:16] but you see we we we don't have the
[7:18] impression from David's life that he was
[7:21] one that would be one that would run
[7:23] from the enemy or to hide and and yet
[7:26] he's asking the Lord hide me Lord hide
[7:29] hi me yet it is not running away or it's
[7:32] not being scared in other words he's not
[7:34] saying hide me because he's afraid
[7:36] because he said it the Beginning To Whom
[7:38] Shall I Fear I don't fear anything he
[7:41] says the Lord is my strength of whom
[7:42] shall I be afraid he's not saying hide
[7:45] me because he's
[7:48] afraid he's not saying it because he's
[7:51] wanting to run from the enemy that's not
[7:53] David and yet it is not a running away
[7:55] or a scared he he says he is not afraid
[7:59] uh To Whom Shall I Fear I'm not afraid
[8:03] he said in this will I be confident
[8:05] there's full confidence here there's no
[8:07] fear here but yet we must realize that
[8:10] fear is around him fear is surrounding
[8:14] him can you say Amen uh uh uh the
[8:17] there's there's the enemy surrounding
[8:18] him my foes that were coming to eat my
[8:20] flesh he's being completely surrounded
[8:24] by the enemy and so he's saying hide me
[8:26] not because he's afraid but because if
[8:29] he don't live in that secret place then
[8:32] he's vulnerable to become influenced by
[8:35] this fear that's right praise the Lord
[8:40] so uh he says I'm confident but he says
[8:43] do hide me that he says let me live in a
[8:47] place that's protected and a place
[8:49] that's higher another place that opens
[8:52] up to me that would be higher than the
[8:54] enemy now but in Psalm 642 the way he
[8:58] says it and hide me he says it this way
[9:00] he says hide me from the secret counsel
[9:03] of the
[9:04] wicked from the Insurrection of the
[9:07] workers of
[9:08] iniquity so now we get a little bit more
[9:11] window into what he's saying hide me
[9:13] from and that is the the secret counsel
[9:16] of the wicked from the Insurrection of
[9:18] workers of iniquity the secret counsel
[9:20] of the wicked in other words hide me
[9:23] don't let me be affected by what's being
[9:26] said about me in private yeah
[9:31] things are being said about from my
[9:33] enemy and that's the secret counsel and
[9:35] things are but so NE this is something
[9:37] he said hide me from that and I'm just
[9:39] just just pondering this morning with
[9:41] you why would he say hide me from that
[9:43] I'm going to bring this out if I can why
[9:45] is David saying hide me from the secret
[9:48] counsil of the wicked I wonder if this
[9:50] hide me is not so much is is is not so
[9:53] much protection from a regular war or
[9:56] arrows that are coming at him uh he
[9:58] wouldn't be afraid of that but maybe
[10:00] what he will hear that is being said
[10:02] about him and what he would hear being
[10:04] said about him might affect him a little
[10:07] bit and that would influence him and may
[10:09] influence him out of this place of
[10:12] protection uh just bear with me as I
[10:14] just lay these foundations maybe he hide
[10:17] me means that I don't want to be
[10:19] affected affected by what's being said
[10:22] about me I I'm just preaching this
[10:24] because this the way I'm feeling lately
[10:26] before the Lord God just hide me I just
[10:28] feel like I
[10:29] lately I just feel like I'm trying to
[10:31] stay out of the line of fire has anybody
[10:35] ever felt that that way you know just
[10:38] don't say too much because if you say
[10:41] something if you say too much it can and
[10:44] will be used against you in the court of
[10:46] law and that's how the enemy is can you
[10:49] say am man you can have the best
[10:50] intentions and say something it gets
[10:52] twisted by the enemy can I get an amen
[10:55] and so it kind of makes you on edge is
[10:57] that I'm just trying to stay out of line
[10:58] of of fire things being shot at me
[11:00] things being said this how David felt
[11:02] this is all through the book of Psalms
[11:04] where he talks about the enemy and
[11:06] things coming at him and his enemy what
[11:08] they're saying about him and so David
[11:10] had to live in another place David had
[11:13] to live in a higher place because why
[11:16] words can affect us the enemy's attacks
[11:20] can affect us especially if we have a
[11:22] lot of
[11:23] complexes the enemy abuses those things
[11:26] so he wanted to live in a higher place
[11:28] that he wasn't affected or brought down
[11:30] by that and he was saying hide me it
[11:33] hide me from those things God just hide
[11:35] me and sometimes it's safer not to say
[11:38] anything or the devil can twist it and I
[11:40] I just want to be I don't know about you
[11:43] but in this last age where there's such
[11:45] a and I'll talk about this in a minute
[11:47] just such a a pressure such a pressure
[11:50] and such enemy power against Christians
[11:54] I just want to be a simple Christian
[11:56] with no gu and no pre
[12:00] pretense I just want to be
[12:03] nice and I do that and I still can't do
[12:06] things
[12:07] right job is the only other man who said
[12:10] hide me and he says it this way which is
[12:12] to me a mystery behind it job 1413 says
[12:15] oh that thou wouldest hide me in the
[12:23] grave oh that thou wouldest hide me in
[12:26] the grave that thou wouldest keep me
[12:29] secret until thy wrath be passed that
[12:32] thou wouldest appoint me a set time and
[12:36] remember me now I want to elaborate on
[12:38] this because uh all that job went
[12:40] through this is what he says in all that
[12:42] he's gone through on Earth he said hide
[12:45] me in the grave in other words there's a
[12:48] lot of pressure he went through a lot of
[12:50] losses he had in this life but he had a
[12:53] revelation of Resurrection how many know
[12:55] that job had a revelation of
[12:57] Resurrection how many know that job was
[13:00] not afraid of the Grave he's not afraid
[13:03] of the Grave he's not afraid of dying
[13:05] because he knows the grave is not the
[13:07] end for him he's got a revelation that
[13:10] if I go there it's not the end it's
[13:12] actually just the beginning and I will
[13:14] end this life someday I will end the
[13:17] pressure here someday and if I'm put in
[13:19] that grave to hide there that's a good
[13:21] place for a Christian to hide because
[13:23] God's going to come and pull me out of
[13:24] that grave someday and job says hide me
[13:27] in the grave that says a lot there's a
[13:30] mystery behind this that only job knew
[13:33] and that is nobody would ask God to hide
[13:35] me in the grave that's not a place most
[13:38] people on the face of the Earth are
[13:39] saying just hide me in the grave you'd
[13:41] have to have a revelation to ask God
[13:45] hide me in the
[13:48] grave you'd have to have a revelation of
[13:51] resurrection and Rapture to say hide me
[13:54] in the grave and so job has that
[13:57] Revelation and unless they they knew
[13:59] people knew that it was some sort of a a
[14:01] Hideout and I believe Jo job did not
[14:03] look at it as death he looked at it as
[14:05] kind of a hideout until the resurrection
[14:07] this is what psalms 27 is because the
[14:10] revelation of the Rapture is tied to
[14:13] psalms 27 how many Believers know that
[14:16] psalms 27 is the text that was used for
[14:18] Rapture the revelation of the Rapture is
[14:21] tied to this very mysterious scripture
[14:23] where he says in Psalms 27 what we read
[14:26] read today though a host should encamp
[14:28] abound me those fears around me I will
[14:30] not fear I will be confident but Lord I
[14:33] need one thing one thing I desire to
[14:35] dwell wherever your dwelling I need to
[14:37] be in the secret of your Tabernacle I
[14:40] need to live in that protection can you
[14:42] say Amen because this is the conditions
[14:44] before Rapture there had to be a a a
[14:47] hideout there had to be a secret place
[14:50] and if we didn't have it we won't
[14:52] survive Le O deia we won't survive the
[14:55] judgments of God we won't survive the
[14:57] conditions we better be real and say
[15:00] without the Holy Spirit and living in
[15:03] his presence none of us have the human
[15:07] capability to survive the times that
[15:10] we're living in right now now the
[15:12] quicker some of us raise our hands and
[15:13] be honest about it there's nothing
[15:16] within you that can make it in these
[15:20] times without the Holy Ghost secret
[15:24] place you can't get rapturing Faith
[15:26] unless you're in that place that's the
[15:28] room that's the place he gives you Faith
[15:31] because why outside of that is doubt is
[15:34] Fear Can you sayen you're not going to
[15:36] get rapturing Faith by feeding on the
[15:38] things of the world you're not going to
[15:40] get rapturing Faith by feeding on a
[15:42] denominational Creed you're not going to
[15:44] get rapturing Faith by just some nominal
[15:46] Christian thing God has provided the
[15:49] food to bring rapturing Faith to his
[15:51] people in the last days and if you stay
[15:54] outside of the secret place then you
[15:56] realize you don't have the strength teen
[15:58] anger I'm going to tell you as your
[16:00] friend and your servant of the Lord you
[16:03] cannot make it in this lustful age
[16:05] without the Holy
[16:08] Ghost your mental capability your
[16:11] willpower it's not good enough for
[16:14] Satan's Eden come on friends can I get a
[16:17] greater amen it's you're not good enough
[16:20] there's nothing going to make it except
[16:22] you get in Christ in that place with
[16:24] Christ families are not going to make it
[16:27] without being in this word in being in
[16:29] with
[16:30] Christ marriages are not going to make
[16:32] it without being rooted very heavy in
[16:35] that secret place with Christ where the
[16:37] word is the most important thing in your
[16:40] life oh I can play around this I can you
[16:43] know what no no it's too much maybe in
[16:46] Luther's day you might have survived it
[16:48] a little bit but in this Satan's Eden it
[16:51] takes this answer to the Rapture to
[16:53] develop rapturing Faith it's a
[16:55] developing room job thought it was a it
[16:58] was was a it's it's a hideout it's a
[17:01] place job never seen it as the end but a
[17:03] hideout a waiting room a Green Room you
[17:06] me know what everyone know what a green
[17:07] room is it's the Green Room green room
[17:10] before the big stage
[17:12] event The Green Room is where all the
[17:14] artists go and they wait it out before
[17:18] they are invited to the big stage event
[17:20] and to perform job is in the green room
[17:23] waiting to be called for the big
[17:26] Resurrection event praise the Lord
[17:28] everybody
[17:29] body he wanted to be hiding until Jesus
[17:32] cried out and there he was all the Old
[17:34] Testament Saints who died in the Lord
[17:37] there they are hiding out in the grave
[17:39] they're hiding in the grave and
[17:40] everybody thought they're dead and
[17:41] they're gone no they're just in the
[17:43] green room waiting to be called on
[17:46] stage and sure enough when Jesus cried
[17:49] out with a loud voice there was a power
[17:52] behind his voice of resurrection and the
[17:54] Bible says they come out of the green
[17:56] room and they showed thems El in the
[17:58] city streets of
[18:01] Jerusalem their life wasn't over the
[18:04] grave the grave wasn't the end they were
[18:07] just hiding out
[18:09] there hide
[18:11] me appearing now the Bride of Jesus
[18:14] Christ on
[18:16] stage and as she goes to the Grave she's
[18:19] waiting in the green room because it's
[18:20] gonna how many knows it's going to
[18:22] happen again how many knows there's a
[18:23] voice of
[18:24] Resurrection how many knows there's a
[18:26] shout for the rapture Jesus said the
[18:29] shout Paul said the shout the voice and
[18:30] the Trump the three phases of the
[18:32] Rapture that means that we're already in
[18:34] the cycle of it the shout the voice of
[18:37] the Resurrection the same voice that
[18:39] called the Saints out of the Grave is
[18:40] the same voice that's here
[18:44] now the message ended up being the the
[18:46] shout ended up being something different
[18:47] we ever thought from a Pentecostal view
[18:49] view and here he presents it the shout
[18:52] as a message and a prophet to gather the
[18:54] people together so we're already in the
[18:56] cycle of it now we're looking for that
[18:57] voice of the resur Resurrection which
[18:59] will be in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[19:01] she's the Earthly body on Earth
[19:04] something's going to happen in her to
[19:05] trigger the resurrection is that David
[19:07] said hide me in the secret of his
[19:09] dwelling place and that types with the
[19:12] Rapture or that uh links with the
[19:14] Rapture because we know this he says put
[19:17] me in not your Tabernacle not your
[19:19] Pavilion The
[19:20] Secret of your
[19:23] Tabernacle the Rapture also is a
[19:26] secret can you say amen so that ties
[19:31] together perfectly with the Rapture
[19:32] because we're talking about a secret
[19:34] place secret place uh when you have a
[19:38] secret place it means that not everybody
[19:41] knows where it
[19:43] is not everybody knows where it is or
[19:47] not everybody is called to that secret
[19:49] place uh it's a place that God develops
[19:53] us for rapturing Faith it's a place
[19:56] seekely it has to be a place why because
[19:58] all around is doubts and fears and
[20:01] questions all around us is doubts and
[20:04] fears and questions and Satan messing
[20:07] with absolutes all the time Satan
[20:10] closing in on us with his doubts you
[20:12] can't get more rapturing faith when
[20:14] you're being destabilized by Demons of
[20:17] Doubt let me say it again you can't get
[20:20] rapturing Faith to get out of here when
[20:22] you're exposing yourself online on
[20:25] social media to all kinds of doubt
[20:27] you'll never get rapturing Faith from
[20:29] those
[20:30] sources and if you expose yourself too
[20:32] much to it you'll find yourself doubting
[20:35] cuz that's all that produces it'll never
[20:37] bring rapturing
[20:39] Faith preaching some Creed will never
[20:42] bring rapturing Faith going back to
[20:44] Pentecost will never bring rapturing
[20:46] Faith but God has provided the place
[20:49] that he will preach rapturing Faith to
[20:51] his people he will Rapture his Fe people
[20:54] how many want to be raptured amen but
[20:56] you need rapturing faith Rapture is a
[20:58] revelation I need that Revelation above
[21:00] any re Revelation just before the coming
[21:03] of the Lord and during the midst of the
[21:05] coming scoffers R will rise up and you
[21:08] know what they're scoffing at not just
[21:10] that you're a Christian we always get
[21:12] that but they're scoffing the promise of
[21:15] the Rapture they're scoffing the coming
[21:17] of the lord they're scoffing and making
[21:20] fun of this promise that you believe
[21:24] you're saying Amen to this morning
[21:25] you're saying I believe I'm a part of it
[21:27] there's scoffing they're making fun of
[21:29] that they say where is the promise of
[21:31] his coming for since the fathers came
[21:34] all things continue just as they are
[21:37] that's what the world says that's a lot
[21:38] of times what in the Christian church
[21:40] says that's doesn't mean anything that
[21:42] that that just doesn't mean nothing and
[21:44] so now we have a doubting we have
[21:46] scoffers that are scoffing the promise
[21:48] the very promise that we believe can you
[21:50] say Amen so if we have a day of scoffers
[21:53] then the whole thing is mocking and
[21:55] questioning that whole question when
[21:58] where is the promise of his coming the
[22:01] questions where is the Vindication for
[22:04] all of this so This mocking of things is
[22:07] also mocking what happens in end times
[22:09] events and also especially the promise
[22:12] of the Rapture the coming of the Lord
[22:14] mocking the coming of the Lord and just
[22:16] before Rapture our promise uh we realize
[22:20] that there's an increased intensity of
[22:22] pressure and trouble and that's why I'm
[22:23] pulling out that word out of Psalms 27
[22:25] the time in the time of trouble in the
[22:28] time of trouble how many believe we're
[22:29] in the time of trouble in the time of
[22:32] trouble I need you to hide
[22:34] me in the time of trouble there is a
[22:37] great intensity of the enemy be being
[22:41] encamped around the people of God in the
[22:44] time of trouble there'll be a lot of
[22:46] trouble we we we ask the Lord to hide us
[22:49] because we don't want to be caught in
[22:51] the trouble it it's it's Pride to say
[22:55] that I won't be caught in all this
[22:58] trouble you have the vulnerability to be
[23:01] caught in the trouble around you you
[23:04] have the the humanness The Human Side
[23:07] the fleshly side of you if you feed on
[23:10] things enough you will be caught in the
[23:13] web just like everybody else is caught
[23:15] in the web of pornography of adultery of
[23:19] Family Division you'll be caught in that
[23:21] world because you're vulnerable to it
[23:23] you'll be caught in it yourself but God
[23:26] gives us an escape God gives us a place
[23:31] out and so in the time of trouble is
[23:34] when he's saying would you please Lord
[23:36] hide me there's no need for us to
[23:39] hide
[23:41] unless there's danger all around can you
[23:46] say amen
[23:47] amen why is David saying hide me Lord
[23:50] hide me because there's danger all
[23:52] around
[23:54] you if you don't realize there's danger
[23:56] all around you and that it could affect
[23:58] you then you're not asking Lord hide me
[24:01] hide me hide me in that rock put me on
[24:04] that rock he's saying lift me above my
[24:06] enemies in the time of trouble please
[24:09] hide me he wouldn't be asking that
[24:10] unless there's danger all around the
[24:12] time of trouble if you don't see there's
[24:14] danger around then you don't see the
[24:16] value of that secret place we need to be
[24:18] hidden away with Christ the Bible says
[24:21] also that we live in perilous times
[24:23] testing times can you say
[24:25] Amen besides all the spirits and Hell
[24:29] being un loosed around Unleashed around
[24:31] us besides the lustful Spirits the
[24:33] perverted Spirits all these things
[24:36] surrounding us it's a time of trouble
[24:39] but then the Bible says in the last days
[24:41] there will be perilous times that means
[24:42] testing time we're vulnerable outside of
[24:45] his daily protection there is a hedge
[24:48] from the spirit of this world there's a
[24:50] protection from the spirit of this world
[24:53] is safety in Jesus Christ the word can
[24:55] you say Amen so in psalms
[24:59] 27 I would say this that it's not so
[25:02] much hiding even though he uses that
[25:04] word but when the other words are there
[25:06] when it says he he shall lift my head
[25:09] above he shall set me up upon a rock and
[25:11] he shall lift my head above my enemies
[25:14] it's not so much about hiding in this
[25:16] but it's but it's lifting us above it
[25:19] all that we can live above it all set me
[25:22] on a rock above my enemies praising the
[25:25] Lord because it says here he sets me up
[25:28] my head above the enemies how many would
[25:30] say I want to live above my
[25:32] enemies it's another atmosphere it's
[25:34] something else I want to live above it
[25:36] and therefore will I offer in this
[25:38] Tabernacle sa sacrifices of joy and I
[25:41] will sing yay I will sing praises unto
[25:44] the Lord so David is so confident here
[25:47] he says when you lift me up above my
[25:49] enemies you put me in a place set me on
[25:51] a rock and you lift me up above my
[25:53] enemies that I can at least be above
[25:56] them and and and then what I'm doing up
[25:59] there is I'm praising I will offer the
[26:01] sacrifices of
[26:03] Joy I will just praise the Lord like I'm
[26:06] not going to be shy to praise the Lord
[26:09] you know is it wouldn't it be annoying
[26:11] as you know David sat on the Rock and he
[26:13] just praising the Lord and all his
[26:15] enemies are down there and he's not even
[26:17] looking at
[26:18] them glory be to God praise be to God
[26:24] and you start sing like I will not come
[26:27] come down to the devil's level he set me
[26:32] up on a rock can you say Amen I'll pray
[26:34] for you my brother but guess what I'm
[26:36] not coming down to where you're at I
[26:39] don't want your fear I don't want your
[26:41] doubts I don't want your nervousness I
[26:43] want to live in this secret place above
[26:45] my
[26:47] enemies and you can imagine if this
[26:49] spirit is true that it's always trying
[26:51] to drag you down they're not happy that
