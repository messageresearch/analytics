[0:00] see amen
[0:01] this morning we're going to read
[0:02] together in the scripture
[0:04] if you have your bibles
[0:06] we're going to read in luke chapter 5
[0:09] if you would join with us
[0:11] and
[0:12] thank you brothers for playing and thank
[0:14] you for the special and just bringing us
[0:16] into the presence of the lord
[0:18] and we are depending and trusting on him
[0:22] the snow may be beautiful but up in
[0:25] newfoundland they call it the devil's
[0:28] dandruff
[0:29] i don't know if they call it that in
[0:30] edmonton or not brother from detroit
[0:33] here but they call it the devil's
[0:34] dandruff and sometimes
[0:36] he tries so hard to interrupt things
[0:39] even though it's pretty but so but we're
[0:41] not backing down this morning we're here
[0:43] the lord's here
[0:45] and
[0:46] when he's present then
[0:49] many wonderful things can take place if
[0:51] your heart is open to him
[0:53] amen praise the lord luke chapter 5 and
[0:56] verse 17 if you would luke chapter 5 and
[0:59] verse 17 and it came to pass on a
[1:02] certain day
[1:03] as he was teaching that there were
[1:05] pharisees and doctors of the law sitting
[1:07] by which were come out of every town of
[1:10] galilee and judea and jerusalem
[1:13] and the power of the lord was present to
[1:16] heal them how many want to believe this
[1:18] morning that the power of the lord is
[1:20] present
[1:21] to heal them
[1:23] and behold men brought in a bed a man
[1:25] which was taken with palsy
[1:28] and they sought means to bring him in
[1:30] and to lay him before him and when they
[1:33] could not find by what way they might
[1:35] bring him in because of the multitude
[1:38] they went up upon the housetop
[1:40] and let him down through the tiling with
[1:43] his couch into the mist before jesus and
[1:46] when he saw their faith he said unto
[1:49] them man
[1:50] thy sins are forgiven thee and the
[1:52] scribes and the pharisees begin to
[1:55] reason of course uh and so i want to
[1:58] elaborate this morning on our thought
[2:00] life and thoughts and so now i want you
[2:03] to notice the scenario of something
[2:05] happening here that is very strange very
[2:07] out of the ordinary
[2:09] and actually would uh provoke many
[2:12] thoughts from everybody in that room
[2:14] everybody outside
[2:16] of course the pharisees and sadducees
[2:18] are going to be critical but i think it
[2:20] would provoke different thoughts from
[2:22] everybody in that room as they watch the
[2:25] tiles being torn off the roof and
[2:27] somebody with so much faith wanting to
[2:29] get near jesus is willing to tear the
[2:32] roof apart and be and be lowered down in
[2:34] front of jesus i like that kind of faith
[2:38] but that kind of faith
[2:40] provokes a lot of uh critical thoughts
[2:45] especially from pharisees
[2:48] and so this this
[2:49] this is what god gave me to bring in the
[2:52] channel of this thought about our
[2:54] thought life and what we think about the
[2:57] scribes and the pharisees begin to
[2:58] reason saying who is this which speaketh
[3:01] blasphemies who can forgive sins but god
[3:04] alone
[3:05] but jesus but when jesus
[3:08] perceived their thoughts so this is
[3:11] things that was they were thinking it
[3:13] wasn't they weren't saying it they were
[3:15] thinking it but when jesus was present
[3:19] he knew what they were thinking
[3:23] so i'm letting all of you know whether
[3:25] it's me or you or whoever it is jesus
[3:29] this morning knows what you're thinking
[3:34] there isn't any thought that's hidden
[3:36] from him
[3:39] when jesus perceived this which is the
[3:41] scripture that the prophet used many
[3:44] times
[3:45] to show what shadow of ministry god was
[3:48] speaking through in the last days again
[3:50] under the son of man and that was he
[3:52] knows the secrets and thoughts intents
[3:54] of the heart so he used this because if
[3:56] jesus did this before he can do it again
[3:59] and he used this that jesus perceived
[4:01] their thoughts
[4:02] he answering said unto them what why
[4:04] what reason ye in your hearts whether it
[4:07] is easier to say thy sins be forgiven
[4:10] thee or to say rise up and walk and that
[4:13] ye may know that the son of man has
[4:15] power upon earth to forgive sins he said
[4:18] unto the sick of the palsy i say unto
[4:21] thee arise
[4:22] take up thy couch and go into thy house
[4:25] and he immediately he rose up before
[4:28] them took up the wherein he lay and
[4:30] departed into his own house glorifying
[4:33] god
[4:34] and they were all amazed
[4:37] and they glorified god and were filled
[4:41] with fear saying
[4:43] we have seen strange things today
[4:50] hallelujah
[4:52] jesus likes to do
[4:55] strange
[4:56] things
[4:57] to the human mind
[5:00] and when he wants to do strange things
[5:03] we should let him do strange things
[5:07] if it brings victory
[5:09] if it brings healing
[5:10] if it brings deliverance
[5:12] then let god do what he wants to do
[5:16] can you pray with me

[5:20] today we pray
[5:21] that lord everything that you have given

[8:24] christ for your glory
[8:26] amen
[8:28] amen once you shake somebody's hand as
[8:30] your take your seat this morning god
[8:32] bless you each one
[8:35] now we want to deal with another
[8:38] avenue of the subject of our thought
[8:41] life
[8:42] and i trust you all be
[8:44] listening good this morning and
[8:46] listening intently
[8:48] and uh we don't we we'll see how long
[8:50] we'll go because we want to leave time
[8:52] for special prayer
[8:54] and
[8:56] i believe we have a subject that we've
[9:00] been speaking of of our thought life
[9:02] and i believe with all my heart saints
[9:04] that we can't preach about
[9:06] our thought life enough
[9:08] i could probably take the next year and
[9:10] keep talking about it and preaching
[9:12] about it i believe it's very important
[9:14] the reason i believe it's important to
[9:16] talk about what you're thinking every
[9:17] day and what you're thinking even right
[9:20] now
[9:20] i believe it's important because i
[9:22] believe this is a key to greater faith
[9:25] and greater victory
[9:26] and i am convinced that satan hates it
[9:30] when ministers expose
[9:32] things like how the mind works
[9:34] and things like how satan comes into our
[9:38] thoughts
[9:39] i'm convinced that satan is very much
[9:41] upset and satan does not like ministers
[9:44] to talk about your thought life because
[9:47] this is the area satan wreaks havoc so
[9:50] much it's in your thought life it's the
[9:52] hidden world it's the private world it
[9:55] is the world nobody sees but god but it
[9:58] is a world satan can attack you in and
[10:01] so this is the part that's why satan of
[10:04] course being the
[10:05] the creature or the being that likes to
[10:07] keep everything hidden he doesn't like
[10:10] to be exposed and because your thought
[10:12] life is is hidden and is is private and
[10:15] no one else can see it that's why satan
[10:18] uses it because you can hold things and
[10:21] we know from the scripture your thoughts
[10:23] certain thoughts can bind you and satan
[10:26] loves to bind
[10:27] and so he doesn't like this type of
[10:29] preaching and talking about these things
[10:31] and i'm certainly i know that our enemy
[10:34] this morning did not like it all the way
[10:36] back when brother brown preached the
[10:37] greatest battle ever fought as he dealt
[10:40] with our mind and our spirit and that
[10:42] we're a three-part being and that satan
[10:44] gets in these realms of emotions and see
[10:47] taste feel smell and hear and memory
[10:49] imagination conscience affection
[10:51] reasoning as he explored how satan and
[10:55] one minister told me this week i
[10:57] appreciated that that
[10:59] brother branham and god through the
[11:00] prophet was teaching sons and daughters
[11:03] of god how to go to battle in the last
[11:06] days and because the battle will be in
[11:08] the mind he's teaching us how to go to
[11:11] battle in the battle of the mind and not
[11:14] just to battle but to win
[11:17] he preached that so sons and daughters
[11:20] of god can win the battle
[11:22] over the mind
[11:24] can you say amen
[11:27] so this is important and so
[11:29] i came to this text of jesus perceiving
[11:31] their thoughts
[11:33] and uh when you talk about
[11:35] the uh the subject or this part of jesus
[11:39] that can discern the thoughts and can
[11:40] know what you're thinking i i thought
[11:43] about it yesterday and i was thinking
[11:44] how it's it seems to me and i could be
[11:47] wrong but it seems to me that this part
[11:49] of jesus that can discern your thinking
[11:52] and discern your thoughts is not
[11:54] preached about a lot in the christian
[11:56] realm this part of jesus is actually
[11:58] hardly ever spoke of in christian realms
[12:01] we hear so much about jesus especially
[12:04] in christianity we talk about all the
[12:06] facts of the facets of jesus we talk
[12:09] about becoming more like jesus we talk
[12:11] about jesus and his miracles we teach
[12:13] our children sunday school stories of
[12:16] what god did in jesus and when he lived
[12:18] on this earth for three and a half years
[12:20] and so much as jesus of jesus has talked
[12:22] about but when you think about there's
[12:24] not a lot of messages about jesus
[12:26] knowing our thoughts back then he
[12:28] perceived their thoughts and if he can
[12:30] do that back then he can do it this
[12:32] morning
[12:34] because jesus christ is the same
[12:37] yesterday today and forever and no man
[12:40] no denomination has a right to say he
[12:43] did it back then but he can't do that
[12:45] now jesus is the same in the service
[12:48] this morning as he ever was and if he
[12:50] knew their thoughts within a moment back
[12:52] then then he knows your thoughts now
[12:56] but it's not preached about a lot
[12:58] this part of jesus is not preached about
[13:01] and thank god for the message of the
[13:02] hour who brought this part of jesus back
[13:05] to life again
[13:06] and showed us this is the part of jesus
[13:08] that's very important to us and very
[13:11] important to the kingdom of god that
[13:13] jesus knows your thoughts because we
[13:15] know if jesus can know your thoughts
[13:17] jesus can correct your thoughts and you
[13:19] can get the right thoughts in your mind
[13:22] the right mental attitude towards any
[13:24] promise of god will bring it to pass
[13:27] you can't say i got the holy ghost and
[13:29] ignore your thought life
[13:31] you can't say i got the holy ghost and
[13:32] ignore what you're thinking every day
[13:34] you can't have the holy ghost and ignore
[13:36] what you're thinking right now
[13:39] so our thought life has to be in line
[13:42] with our soul
[13:46] i said our thought life has to be in
[13:48] line with our soul
[13:52] or we're going to struggle
[13:57] so this part of jesus and and thankfully
[14:00] this part was was raised to our
[14:03] attention through the last day's message
[14:05] again
[14:07] and uh
[14:09] it is so significant
[14:11] it is mostly the message that has shown
[14:13] this
[14:14] vision realm of jesus that jesus could
[14:17] see a vision
[14:19] and in a moment's time he could see by
[14:21] vision what the thoughts of the of the
[14:23] person was we see this in the four
[14:25] gospels and we see uh see it displayed
[14:28] but it has been talked about so now we
[14:30] see that he quickly could tell what
[14:32] people were thinking
[14:34] and he could speak it he could expose it
[14:37] and the reason why
[14:38] this side of jesus is revealed to us
[14:41] today and brought back to us is because
[14:43] the son of man is going to repeat itself
[14:45] again and we would see a very unique
[14:48] ministry repeat itself as jesus said it
[14:50] would when the son of man reveals
[14:52] himself in the last days i'm all on the
[14:54] bible now for those who are listening in
[14:56] and those anybody who who uh maybe has
[14:59] not heard these things before i'm right
[15:01] in the bible because jesus prophesied
[15:04] and said in in the last days when it's
[15:06] the coming of the son of man when it's
[15:08] the days like sodom and gomorrah when
[15:10] it's a days like noah's day he will
[15:12] repeat as son of man again son of man is
[15:15] prophet son of man is discerned and a
[15:17] prophet can discern through god now not
[15:20] in himself but he can discern the
[15:22] thoughts and intents of the heart he
[15:23] could tell you exactly in a moment's
[15:26] time what you're thinking he could tell
[15:28] you what your doctor said to you last
[15:30] week he could tell you 20 years ago what
[15:32] happened in your life in a moment's time
[15:34] and he did it jesus did it by vision
[15:38] he could see it can you say amen it
[15:40] wasn't a guessing game
[15:42] it was by vision
[15:45] and so when when uh jesus began then
[15:48] when in the last days when we see this
[15:50] repeated again
[15:51] the reason why this side of jesus is
[15:53] revealed to us is because the son of man
[15:56] repeats again that it's jesus christ the
[15:58] same yesterday today and forever in all
[16:01] aspects it is wrong to say he is not the
[16:04] same in every aspect if any denomination
[16:07] has taught you that he's not the same in
[16:09] every aspect then that denomination has
[16:12] deceived you
[16:13] because jesus christ is the same
[16:15] yesterday today and forever he's the
[16:17] same in every aspect say well why don't
[16:20] i see things in my particular church
[16:22] because it takes faith to believe that
[16:25] jesus can do what he did in the past it
[16:27] takes believers to say i just simply
[16:30] believe it i don't have to go through
[16:32] all kinds of teaching about it
[16:34] he said it he can do it again and i just
[16:37] have simple faith i just believe you can
[16:39] do it
[16:41] and i believe it whether i see it or not
[16:46] i believe he can open up a blind man's
[16:48] eyes whether i ever see it or not
[16:51] but we have seen it and we do see it i
[16:54] believe he heals cancer whether i ever
[16:56] see it or not but friends we have
[16:58] too many testimonies that say otherwise
[17:04] blessed be his name so it takes
[17:06] believers to believe it and so now
[17:08] uh
[17:09] so so
[17:12] i'm just going to move on from that so
[17:14] now this part of jesus being real
[17:16] and this part of jesus
[17:19] of course
[17:20] being real to us in knowing the thoughts
[17:23] it's important and it always has been
[17:25] there in other words
[17:27] there's an element that came through
[17:29] jesus that really has always been there
[17:31] even though you have a unique gift in a
[17:34] prophet that can see by vision certain
[17:36] things
[17:37] we know that this element is always
[17:40] among us
[17:41] because and if you're listening and you
[17:43] want bible for it
[17:44] hebrews quotes and says the word of god
[17:47] the word of god not not just your bible
[17:51] when you think of the word of god not
[17:53] just your written bible that's just a
[17:54] written bible to help us but the word of
[17:56] god the person of christ because jesus
[17:58] is the word the word of god is quick and
[18:02] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[18:05] sword
[18:07] piercing to the dividing of sunder of
[18:09] soul and spirit
[18:11] and is a discerner of the thoughts
[18:16] and the intents
[18:19] of the heart
[18:21] so really this has really never left the
[18:24] church
[18:25] if the word is present
[18:28] jesus the word
[18:30] then he knows the thoughts
[18:33] and it may enable us better if there's a
[18:35] prophet there that can see it by vision
[18:38] and we say my that would be great your
[18:40] faith would probably build if we had the
[18:43] prophet and he could
[18:44] have you up and he could tell you and
[18:47] say i know what the doctor said to you
[18:49] this week and he verbatim word for word
[18:51] tells you what the doctor said and then
[18:53] he tells you your house number and he
[18:54] doesn't know you but he tells you
[18:56] exactly what you're thinking just even
[18:58] in this service he starts to go through
[19:00] and tell you what you were thinking 10
[19:02] minutes ago in the thought that came to
[19:04] your mind and all of a sudden when that
[19:05] happens and we would our faith would be
[19:08] you know what your faith would be saying
[19:10] this is real
[19:14] jesus christ is among us
[19:17] it would sober us up
[19:22] it does a lot of things it sobers us up
[19:24] that god's real this isn't just church
[19:27] this isn't just not a a beautiful place
[19:29] god has given us and i'm not just
[19:31] filling my time and putting and punching
[19:34] the clock to be here for church no no
[19:36] wait a minute wait a minute this is real
[19:39] he's here
[19:41] so everything changes when he's here
[19:44] so now our faith would build to be able
[19:46] to get out of our thought life and get
[19:48] out of our doubts and get out of our
[19:50] criticalness to say i don't care about
[19:52] all that he's here he knows my life he
[19:56] knows what my burdens are and if he's
[19:58] here he can bring deliverance for it
[20:03] that's what that kind of faith builds
[20:05] you say well i wish i could see it that
[20:07] real
[20:10] but didn't he say to thomas
[20:12] thomas i'll i'll let you touch my side
[20:16] but i want you to know
[20:18] blessed is he
[20:20] who has not seen
[20:23] and yet believes
[20:27] blessed is that brother and sister who
[20:29] just
[20:30] hears that he can do that
[20:32] blessed is them who who
[20:35] in simple faith
[20:37] believe it they don't try to figure it
[20:39] out they don't let their mind go through
[20:41] a whole process
[20:44] just simple faith
[20:47] i believe he's here
[20:49] i believe he can do anything
[20:52] and that's actually what god's looking
[20:53] for
[20:57] so
[21:00] time after time and
[21:02] you can raise your hand
[21:04] where
[21:06] it's happened to you
[21:08] where they say
[21:09] brother paul
[21:12] were you
[21:13] [Music]
[21:14] at our dinner table last night
[21:19] i know you weren't but
[21:21] were you in the next room
[21:23] did you hear what we discussed the whole
[21:25] evening
[21:26] because you preached a lot of that this
[21:28] morning word for word
[21:31] brother paul
[21:32] were you in our car this morning on the
[21:34] way to church
[21:35] i hear it all the time
[21:38] you know some ministers maybe
[21:40] that don't have the character would
[21:42] start saying man i must really have
[21:44] something here
[21:45] i don't have nothing
[21:49] brother barry sent me a quote yesterday
[21:50] it says we preachers we really don't
[21:52] even preach
[21:54] we call ourselves preachers no no we
[21:56] don't preach god preaches to his people
[22:00] you're saying about me do you think i'd
[22:02] ask unless you know what you talked
[22:03] about in your car on the way to church
[22:06] some of you certainly don't want the
[22:07] preacher in the car on the way to church
[22:12] but god's there
[22:15] god's there
[22:18] hears every conversation and not just
[22:20] conversations the very thoughts the
[22:22] intents of the heart this is the kind of
[22:24] jesus that we serve
[22:28] and it doesn't scare me it doesn't make
[22:30] me afraid
[22:31] i've come years ago to an open life
[22:34] before him like this and whenever i
[22:36] begin hiding something i know i can't
[22:38] hide it but when i try to hide something
[22:40] it never goes good
[22:43] when i try to hide this little thing
[22:44] let's do this years ago with my family
[22:46] to see if this will work every time i
[22:48] try to hide something god exposes it no
[22:50] that's you can't do that
[22:51] this is where this goes you let your
[22:53] kids watch that this is what they become
[22:56] so this wonderful work of the lord
[22:58] convicting me and exposing things i'm
[23:00] used to it now and i'm i'm all open all
[23:03] arms to it you don't scare me when you
[23:06] come and you have criticisms and things
[23:08] to say to me if i'm off the word i want
[23:10] to know about it if you have something
[23:12] to say i'm not going to it's not going
[23:13] to be the end of the world if you come
[23:15] to me because why i'm open if it's the
[23:17] lord correcting through you i want to
[23:19] hear it
[23:21] if it's just your carnal mind
[23:22] criticizing i'm okay with it as well
[23:25] at the end of the day other decisions
[23:27] might be made i don't know but listen
[23:29] we've got to grow to maturity to quit
[23:31] being afraid when god exposes
[23:35] what we're thinking
[23:37] because that's that's the message we're
[23:39] under right if we've been back in the
[23:41] days of the prophet we would have seen
[23:43] we wouldn't walk into a service like
[23:44] this and you realize there's nothing
[23:46] that you can hide there isn't a thought
[23:48] within a moment and he's looking back
[23:50] and saying now i caught that thought
[23:52] back there
[23:53] i caught what you just thought and now
[23:55] you can't hide that right now how many
[23:57] know the message to know that's what he
[23:58] was doing
[24:00] and how many knows that no human being
[24:01] could do that it had to be gone using a
[24:04] human being but what a service to be in
[24:07] when it's like oh my goodness wow i just
[24:09] thought that two seconds ago and he
[24:11] picked it up
[24:13] what in the world's going on what an
[24:15] atmosphere
[24:17] god
[24:18] was perceiving
[24:20] their thoughts when jesus perceive their
[24:24] thoughts
[24:25] so now our story here
[24:27] uh
[24:29] let me just say this first why does this
[24:31] part of jesus get ignored satan likes it
[24:34] when things are hidden
[24:35] in our thought life that's keeping you
[24:38] from more faith
[24:40] because men can hold thoughts what kind
[24:42] of thought so i pray the lord can just
[24:44] help me elaborate through what he wants
[24:46] to say this morning because there's so
[24:48] much to say about what we're thinking
[24:50] about all the time
[24:51] it can be good it can be bad it can be
[24:54] critical it can be hesitance of
[24:56] preachers it can be i'm never going to
[24:58] fully give my heart to that and that
[25:00] stronghold holds your thoughts so many
[25:02] things it's so important to talk about
[25:05] because we can hide things in our
[25:07] thought life men can hold thoughts of
[25:09] unbelief how many know you can hold
[25:11] thoughts of unbelief
[25:12] men can and women can hold thoughts of
[25:14] fear you can hold on to your fear
[25:16] men can hold thoughts as i know more
[25:18] than everybody else and i've i've read
[25:20] more books and i'm educated even if
[25:22] you've been educated in a seminary the
[25:24] problem with that is you build your life
[25:27] on a foundation of education and i heard
[25:30] the prophet say the other day
[25:31] education's fine but why always watch
[25:34] where education leads you without god
[25:37] education without god makes you proud
[25:39] and a know-it-all and will explain god
[25:41] away
[25:46] men can hold thoughts of unbelief that
[25:47] men can hold thoughts and i know
[25:49] better than everybody else men can hold
[25:52] thoughts that i am better than everybody
[25:54] else
[25:55] my family's better
[25:57] we're just a notch above the rest
[25:59] that's why it's hard for them to
[26:01] co-exist and connect with people because
[26:04] at the end of the day
[26:05] they're kind of here and the other
[26:07] family's here
[26:10] all that happens in the thought world
[26:13] you never say something like that to
[26:14] somebody most of you but if it's in the
[26:16] thought
[26:18] then
[26:19] you wonder what's going on here what's
[26:20] going on well they think they're better
[26:23] they just think they're better
[26:25] why can't they fellowship with anybody
[26:27] else because they just think they're
[26:28] better that's all there is to it
[26:31] the devil is going to get mad this
[26:32] morning
[26:34] men can hold thoughts of their church
[26:36] background i've always been a baptist
[26:39] i've always been a methodist and they
[26:41] can that background can hold you from
[26:43] going on with the word of god
[26:46] that church background warned you stay
[26:48] away from people like that stay away
[26:50] from people who believe in prophets stay
[26:52] away from do you see that thought is
[26:54] holding you
[26:55] from looking at the bible purely can you
[26:58] say amen
[26:59] all these other thoughts it's those
[27:01] thoughts that quench the spirit of god
[27:04] from moving in your life thoughts can
[27:06] quench the spirit
[27:10] and so this in this incident
[27:12] where we find that it's a great
[27:14] provoking of critical thoughts let me
[27:16] just deal with this just a minute so we
[27:18] have a house that's full of people it's
[27:21] packed full they're waiting on the
[27:22] outside nobody can get in and so now
[27:25] this incident where the man
[27:27] with seth's face gets on top of the
[27:29] house with all of his friends maybe he
[27:31] couldn't do it very easy they had to
[27:32] help him and they start tearing the roof
[27:35] apart and they open up an opening and
[27:37] they lower this man right in front of
[27:39] jesus i i just wonder the thoughts that
[27:42] were going on i know what the the
[27:44] pharisees were thinking but everybody
[27:46] this provokes all kinds of
[27:48] thoughts
[27:50] like what in the world
[27:52] don't tell me you people wouldn't be
[27:54] thinking it very strange if if you
[27:58] started to hear noises
[28:00] we're not packed
[28:02] but they started hearing noises and they
[28:04] couldn't get in so they're tearing the
[28:05] roof apart
[28:07] and
[28:08] i keep preaching and they're lowering
[28:10] somebody to be prayed for right in front
[28:12] of the pulpit don't you tell me
[28:15] that all these thoughts would be come up
[28:18] to you
[28:21] you just can't get around it
[28:23] and you're watching it for the you know
[28:25] thought
[28:27] that's just really stupid
[28:32] never seen this happy before their
[28:33] thought
[28:36] is this in church order
[28:37] that's a thought
[28:40] can somebody go back to the library and
[28:41] get a cod book and let's let's look this
[28:43] up a lot of message people are going
[28:45] that this is completely off a church
[28:47] order
[28:49] i mean last sunday gideon went over 30
[28:52] minutes on the song service and that's
[28:53] out of church order he went over 30
[28:55] prophet said 30 minutes
[28:59] get on the word brother
[29:04] tell you all the time
[29:07] is this somebody get a code but let's
[29:09] check this it's like they're coming down
[29:11] thoughts thoughts
[29:13] can't they just do it this way can't
[29:15] they do it and yet your thoughts your
[29:17] thought
[29:18] is completely ignoring what's really
[29:20] happening
[29:22] god's fixing to do something your
[29:24] thoughts have ignored the faith of this
[29:25] man
[29:27] your first thought as a believer should
[29:29] say i'm i'm gonna something's happening
[29:31] here and i'm gonna lay aside my critical
[29:33] thoughts because something's going on
[29:36] i'm not gonna be critical i'm gonna
[29:38] start praying for a man who's willing to
[29:40] tear the roof off of this house
[29:43] and that's why i'm teaching you to
[29:45] correct your thoughts quit being
[29:46] critical quit jumping to the first
[29:48] thought of being critical of other
[29:50] people and every other thing why don't
[29:51] you step back and say now wait a minute
[29:53] i'm bringing my thoughts in line with
[29:55] the word god may be doing something here
[29:58] that person is sitting here in the
[29:59] service and they're not dressed right
[30:01] and they don't look right and they got
[30:02] earrings hanging from the ear whatever
[30:04] they got don't you dare let your
[30:07] thoughts
[30:08] quench the spirit of god
[30:12] for a hungry soul
[30:14] that's starting to search for him don't
[30:16] you dare criticize them don't you dare
[30:19] jump all over them don't you dare meet
[30:21] them in the back door and criticize them
[30:23] you pray that the holy spirit will draw
[30:26] that heart
[30:28] because their problem is more than their
[30:30] earrings that's not the real problem the
[30:32] problem is that god that's a living god
[30:35] a kid needs access to that life and soul
[30:38] and when he does
[30:40] he will do the work
[30:46] because we're not sending people on to
[30:48] heaven just trying to get their earrings
[30:50] off trying to send them in with no birth
[30:53] they can't get in without a birth
[30:57] real birth and personal relationship
[31:00] with jesus christ
[31:02] this person that's so real that i met
[31:05] when i was 16 years old
[31:06] i met him he's invisible but i met him
[31:09] they need to meet this person of the
[31:11] message
[31:12] the business the message the person of
[31:15] the message is jesus christ
[31:21] how many has met him this morning raise
[31:22] your hand i meant the person of the
[31:24] message that's why i love it so much
[31:27] it's not rules to me it's not just god's
[31:29] center prophet it's not that it's christ
[31:33] my living savior
[31:36] don't your thoughts and here here's this
[31:40] scenario and so that you could think all
[31:42] kinds of things and we know what the
[31:44] pharisees said jesus says and i'm not so
[31:47] sure friends that jesus didn't
[31:49] he had this in his mind before the
[31:51] foundation of the world i'm not so sure
[31:53] that jesus doesn't allow
[31:55] strange
[31:56] things to happen
[31:58] to provoke
[32:00] and to let you see where your thought
[32:02] life is
[32:05] i'm not so sure that sometimes i don't
[32:07] preach out of the ordinary or some
[32:09] minister gets out of the order or says
[32:11] something or something's done to provoke
[32:13] and to bring up to let you see how
[32:16] critical your thoughts can be sometimes
[32:18] and that you're not willing to say i'm
[32:20] going to pray i'm not going to be
[32:21] critical i'm not going to let my
[32:22] thoughts go on and on and on and on
[32:26] but i'm going to pray something
[32:27] different has happened it's out of my
[32:28] it's out of my comfort zone it's out of
[32:31] the norm it's out of the box
[32:34] and i'm i'm gonna just watch and pray
[32:37] what's going on here so he did that and
[32:40] it was it was my my father preached this
[32:43] text over and over again when we
[32:45] traveled
[32:46] as children and you remember the title
[32:48] of this sermon sharon and ike and sherry
[32:52] ike's
[32:52] they're not here but you know what he
[32:55] titled it
[32:56] and i heard it preached a million times
[33:00] every church he preached the same
[33:01] sermons
[33:03] that's an evangelist you know
[33:05] it's like he had about
[33:07] i don't want to disrespect my dad today
[33:09] but there's about 20 sermons that's
[33:11] different than a pastor always coming up
[33:13] with something but you know sometimes
[33:14] you preach the same messages again and
[33:16] again and it's a blessing to people
[33:19] oh i heard this message you know he
[33:20] titled this text
[33:22] crazy faith but he wouldn't just say
[33:24] crazy he said i'm going to preach on
[33:26] today crazy
[33:28] faith
[33:32] if you want to know the title of my
[33:33] sermon it's crazy
[33:35] faith
[33:36] and then he would go like no other
[33:38] preacher could do and do this whole
[33:40] scenario of this guy tearing the roof
[33:42] and bringing it down in front of jesus
[33:44] and everybody critical and you know i'll
[33:46] never be able to preach it like he did
[33:47] but it was called crazy
[33:50] faith i guess he was eating some black
[33:53] preacher or something i don't know but
[33:54] that's so how he said it crazy faith
[33:57] and i watched over and over again as it
[33:59] built faith and the congregations were
[34:01] blessed can you say amen
[34:03] and i heard those sermons so much i
[34:05] could preach and myself verbatim today
[34:08] but you know what the scenario was it
[34:09] was crazy faith
[34:11] it was out of the box faith
[34:13] could it be that god wants us to have
[34:15] crazy faith
[34:17] could it be god wants us to get out of
[34:18] our box get past our thinking quit
[34:21] overthinking things quit trying to
[34:22] figure it out and just step out in
[34:24] simple faith i'm believing this i'm
[34:26] going with it
[34:30] could it be that god wants us to have
[34:32] this kind of faith as this man that i'm
[34:35] wanting to get there i'm wanting to get
[34:36] in the presence of jesus i'm i'm wanting
[34:39] to do this can you say amen crazy faith
[34:42] out of the box and here's what the
[34:44] prophet said of that incident he said
[34:46] and remember when the master stood there
[34:48] uh in pool of the bethesda he says
[34:50] remember when the master stood there and
[34:52] the pharisees even around him he said
[34:55] knowing their thoughts that's the reason
[34:57] i'm taking the way i am tonight there's
[34:59] people here i know your thoughts so he
[35:02] refers to
[35:03] luke chapter five that i read and the
[35:06] first quote there if you guys have it he
[35:07] says remember when the master stood
[35:09] there and the pharisees even around him
[35:12] he said knowing their thoughts that's
[35:14] the reason i'm talking the way i am
[35:16] tonight it's 1950. there's people here i
[35:20] know your thoughts and know what you're
[35:21] thinking about all right lady that
[35:23] nervous trouble that you had has left
[35:25] you and you're healed do you believe it
[35:28] god bless you you may you may go on your
[35:31] road rejoicing won't bother you no more
[35:34] let's say praise to praise praise to god
[35:37] there's not a thing in the building but
[35:39] what god knows just exactly what it is
[35:42] and the thoughts of your mind is made
[35:45] known to him
[35:47] and he will make his secrets known to
[35:50] his servants
[35:51] the prophets amos 3 7. do you know your
[35:54] bible
[35:55] amos 3 7.
[35:57] surely the lord god will do nothing
[35:59] except he revealeth his circus his
[36:01] secrets to his servants the prophets so
[36:03] going back to the quote and the thoughts
[36:05] of your mind is made known to him and he
[36:07] will make his secrets known to his
[36:08] servants is that right surely all right
[36:10] everybody have faith believe anything
[36:13] could happen where the lord's people are
[36:16] gathered
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:22] did i just
[36:23] read that quote
[36:25] that says you better
[36:27] bring your thoughts in line
[36:30] because anything
[36:32] could happen
[36:34] when our thoughts are in line
[36:37] and
[36:38] simply believing
[36:40] god can do this
[36:44] he goes on to say in 1951 in testimony
[36:47] all right bring the ladies sister before
[36:49] i look at you i want to come right you
[36:51] just come right around here come around
[36:54] here my back like this i ask some time i
[36:57] want you just to believe with all your
[36:59] heart so that someone know that say just
[37:02] you're just stuttering a bit there
[37:04] look you look at
[37:06] look you
[37:07] someone said you look them in the eye
[37:09] brother branham oh that does it you
[37:11] think i don't know what you're say that
[37:12] you're saying that oh yes i do yes i do
[37:14] it's not me it's our heavenly father he
[37:16] knew their thoughts and that's the
[37:18] reason we're covering this up now sister
[37:20] dear i'm not looking at your eye but i'm
[37:22] asking you something do you believe so
[37:24] just stop right there that's what's
[37:25] going on okay he brings the sister up to
[37:28] pray
[37:29] and somebody has a thought
[37:32] you're reading them by looking in their
[37:33] eye
[37:35] so the prophet intentionally says
[37:37] because you've thought that okay i'm
[37:40] gonna sometimes he put up maybe
[37:42] something in between them i would cover
[37:44] this up i turn my back to them and he's
[37:47] intentionally doing that why because
[37:48] he's catching the thoughts of the
[37:50] critical people
[37:52] so he's adjusting the service
[37:58] now let me just say this
[38:01] if you have believers there and their
[38:04] thinking is right
[38:05] he shouldn't have to adjust the service
[38:09] if there's simple faith but when there's
[38:11] thoughts of criticalism and say i don't
[38:13] know if i can trust this and i'm just
[38:15] here just look checking it out first
[38:18] when all that's there he has to go out
[38:20] of his way to counter that thought to
[38:22] say i'll turn my back to these people if
[38:24] i have to i'll walk over here i'll put a
[38:27] cover saw on my eyes not looking at them
[38:30] because why the thoughts the thoughts
[38:34] are affecting the service
[38:42] the thoughts
[38:43] are affecting
[38:45] the faith
[38:47] of the service
[38:52] now see i'm not looking in your eye but
[38:54] i want ask you something do you believe
[38:56] what i've told you is the truth all
[38:57] right you've been suffering with nervous
[38:59] trouble haven't you
[39:02] all right
[39:04] you've been
[39:05] suffering with nervous trouble haven't
[39:06] you all right
[39:07] go and be well jesus christ maketh thee
[39:10] whole
[39:11] go on and don't think no more about it
[39:14] just rejoice and be happy
[39:16] that that would seem like it's a little
[39:18] bit
[39:19] pretending
[39:21] but i don't believe it's pretending
[39:23] i believe you're taking a step
[39:26] of a little bit of faith to go on your
[39:28] way rejoicing and be happy not because
[39:31] you don't see all the results yet but
[39:33] because you just simply believe
[39:35] i'm coming out of this
[39:38] and it would be better to go on your way
[39:39] happy and rejoicing
[39:42] then
[39:43] sad
[39:44] and depressed
[39:47] god's going to work better with some
[39:48] faith that says
[39:50] i'm happy today
[39:52] i still got this sickness but it's
[39:54] going the devil's on the run
[39:57] i've been prayed for by holy ghost phil
[39:59] people i've got people praying for me
[40:02] and i don't see the results yet but you
[40:04] know what it's going
[40:06] i'm gonna overcome
[40:08] god can work with that a little better
[40:10] in that attitude than he can with the
[40:12] mully grubs
[40:16] go on your way happy and rejoicing i'm
[40:18] turning this way because they come up
[40:20] this side of the platform go on your way
[40:22] brother sister happy and rejoicing
[40:25] setting them in a certain pattern in a
[40:27] certain mood
[40:28] to receive their healing
[40:33] going your way just rejoice and be happy
[40:36] you're nervous
[40:37] it's a real nervous condition he never
[40:39] asked him to deny that it's real
[40:42] it's a real nervous condition i'd say
[40:45] there's some preachers that
[40:47] preach it that way that you know pretend
[40:49] it's not there and all these other
[40:50] things no he said it's a real nervous
[40:52] condition
[40:54] and you want to live a close life
[40:58] and satan's telling you
[41:00] you can't do it
[41:04] i'd say if i ask your hands
[41:08] you know this devil speaks to you as
[41:10] well
[41:11] that you're unworthy
[41:14] that you're unworthy
[41:16] and i want more of god and i want to be
[41:18] closer to god and the devil's telling
[41:20] you
[41:21] you can't
[41:24] i know that devil
[41:29] my heart is get closer to god
[41:31] every time i speak it the devil is just
[41:33] not trying to knock it out at every
[41:35] stage
[41:37] it's only believers that are saying that
[41:39] they want more of god it's only
[41:40] believers saying that she's the only
[41:41] group of people on the face of the earth
[41:43] the bride the true holy ghost is the
[41:45] only one saying
[41:47] i really want all of him
[41:50] so that's the devil that's who the
[41:51] devil's against
[41:53] but he says that satan's telling you you
[41:55] can't do it you go on and do it in the
[41:57] name of the lord jesus
[41:59] you do it in the name of the lord jesus
[42:03] our thoughts
[42:06] so so let's let's just look at it this
[42:09] way our thoughts
[42:10] is a whole
[42:12] other world
[42:14] than what we see
[42:18] even in a service like this our thoughts
[42:21] is a whole other world
[42:23] and god
[42:24] god
[42:26] came into that thought world god if we
[42:30] can say it invaded in these services
[42:33] and he continues to do it god wants to
[42:35] invade your thought life
[42:40] god knows the secrets of the hearts and
[42:42] so but god it's not just that he knows
[42:44] it but he wants to reveal it he wants to
[42:47] he wants to come into that and and
[42:50] uh he wants to he revealed to his
[42:52] prophet what was being thought
[42:55] and then sometimes the prophet would
[42:57] change the way he did the meeting
[42:58] because of critical thoughts
[43:01] why would god do this why would god
[43:04] allow the prophet to expose thoughts say
[43:07] i know what you're thinking you can't
[43:09] hide that thought right now that why
[43:11] would god want to do that to embarrass
[43:13] somebody to to why would god why doesn't
[43:16] god just do
[43:18] just do his work and leave the thought
[43:20] life and what's being thought in the
[43:22] service why don't he just leave that
[43:24] alone
[43:26] i'm probably asking more questions this
[43:29] morning than answering them for you
[43:31] but i like to ask these questions
[43:33] why is god doing this
[43:36] in our eyes god doesn't have to do this
[43:38] he doesn't have to embarrass somebody
[43:39] all of a sudden they're in the back row
[43:42] excuse me to the people in the back row
[43:44] and they're the furthest from the
[43:45] preacher and he says i just you just
[43:47] thought that just now and they're going
[43:50] oh i thought it would help to sit in the
[43:52] back row
[43:54] but if you went in your car if you went
[43:56] out to your car god knows your thoughts
[44:00] and to be sitting there and saying he
[44:02] just exposed but but would god do it to
[44:05] to embarrass somebody would god do it
[44:07] too
[44:09] it's to be convicting of course and it's
[44:11] to be but it's to
[44:13] but but why i'm asking the question why
[44:15] would god
[44:17] come into the thought life of a service
[44:19] and everybody's thought life and want to
[44:22] get into that realm of our thoughts and
[44:25] either have exposed or correct it why
[44:27] would he do it i'll tell you this is
[44:29] what god gave me it's because our
[44:31] thought life has the power
[44:35] to quench the spirit
[44:37] and to hinder the work of god
[44:39] [Music]
[44:42] he was hoping for a bigger more
[44:44] mysterious answer
[44:46] but that's it what you're thinking
[44:49] what you're thinking
[44:52] can hinder
[44:54] what i'm thinking can hinder in a moment
[44:57] if i get to a quote he's praying for
[44:59] somebody
[45:00] and he corrects them because there he
[45:02] says you've been thinking for days this
[45:04] and he corrects their thinking but then
[45:06] he corrects his own
[45:08] because he got critical standing there
[45:10] praying for somebody he says i don't
[45:13] understand why the person did this i'll
[45:15] get to in a minute he's correcting his
[45:17] own thinking and he says i'm sorry lord
[45:19] for thinking that thought
[45:24] the thought life's got to be corrected
[45:26] this is my series i'm preaching on it
[45:27] last sunday appreciate all the response
[45:29] but i'm going on with it because because
[45:31] it had such good response if we don't
[45:33] address what we're thinking every day
[45:36] and we're not willing to bring it every
[45:38] imagination under and casting down
[45:40] imagination every high thing that
[45:42] exalted itself above the knowledge of
[45:44] god you're going to be limited where you
[45:47] go with the lord
[45:50] and a service like this and as services
[45:53] can be limited by what thoughts you're
[45:56] bringing into
[45:58] the service
[46:02] because here we are
[46:03] and i wonder what it would be
[46:05] even in the last 30 minutes whatever
[46:07] i've been preaching
[46:08] i wonder
[46:10] if i've had to bring my belt up a couple
[46:12] times and because
[46:14] i'm losing weight and it falls a little
[46:16] bit i hate to say that in international
[46:19] video but
[46:20] my wife has to remind me and stuff but
[46:22] you know
[46:24] things can be
[46:26] distractions it's like
[46:28] i like this guy's preaching but why
[46:30] don't he fix his pants
[46:33] it would be interesting to know
[46:36] if god were just shh
[46:39] and somehow the tech crew
[46:41] could catch everybody's thoughts the
[46:43] last 30 minutes
[46:45] and put them up on both of these screens
[46:49] person by person
[46:51] starting with josiah cornette
[46:56] and there every thought he's thought not
[46:59] this week every thought he's thought the
[47:01] last
[47:02] 30 minutes would be displayed
[47:05] and then we'll go to brother ted
[47:07] and then we'll go to janus
[47:10] and then we just keep going
[47:13] sister lisa rebecca
[47:18] aubry
[47:21] hayley ryan
[47:25] i got everybody in a good spot right now
[47:27] i just feel like i got everybody into
[47:29] good have you ever thought about it you
[47:31] think about everything else have you
[47:32] ever thought about this
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:37] so so maybe you can go back
[47:40] we don't have the technology this
[47:41] morning i'd love to do it just for the
[47:43] fun of it
[47:45] but we don't have the technology but i
[47:46] can tell you there's something greater
[47:48] than technology in the service today
[47:50] that's her heard in heaven louder than
[47:53] your words heard every thought that you
[47:55] thought
[47:57] so how does it has the power to change a
[47:59] service well yeah if it's not a simply
[48:02] believing what the man is preaching if
[48:04] it's the word and just simple faith and
[48:06] you're not able to shut out gotta quote
[48:07] them and it says we need to need to shut
[48:09] out all the other thoughts i wonder if
[48:11] you put it on the screen if you start
[48:12] going through people you thought about
[48:14] your schedule this week
[48:16] you thought about
[48:18] that hunger pain you feel in your
[48:20] stomach and what's for lunch
[48:22] i know josh and i my son-in-law and i we
[48:24] have those thoughts
[48:27] he
[48:28] he's worse than me because he only
[48:29] thinks about he's hungry but he has to
[48:32] think through where he's going to eat
[48:34] because that's important i eat anywhere
[48:36] that they take me
[48:37] he's got to think it through
[48:40] so i wonder josh i better leave him
[48:41] alone
[48:43] i like him to allow me to see my
[48:45] grandbaby and i don't want to hinder
[48:46] that
[48:51] thoughts
[48:54] i'm just going to go ahead and say this
[48:55] to you there are some people that are
[48:57] still coming to this church
[48:59] and you have resentful thoughts towards
[49:01] somebody else in the church
[49:03] they've done you wrong or something
[49:05] happened 10 years ago somehow two years
[49:07] ago and you hold that thought and i'm
[49:09] here to tell you
[49:11] that there's a place to take those
[49:12] things
[49:13] to forgive
[49:15] but when you bring it to church
[49:16] sometimes i don't even know why people
[49:18] come because they've got all these
[49:20] critical thoughts of everybody else and
[49:22] some people they're looking for
[49:23] something they're looking just looking
[49:25] for a reason to leave the church or
[49:26] something i don't know and brother
[49:28] brahma said this way if you come
[49:30] finding fault you will find it
[49:33] you're gonna find fault we're not
[49:35] perfect we're broken people
[49:38] somebody's gonna say something that they
[49:40] shouldn't say sometimes somebody's gonna
[49:42] say something in the flesh somebody's
[49:44] going to get a little too much anger and
[49:46] even a holy ghost-filled person can step
[49:49] in the flesh
[49:50] and say something they shouldn't say you
[49:52] know why i know they can do it because
[49:54] you do it yourself
[49:58] it's okay get quiet all you want to but
[50:00] i'm going to say this
[50:01] a lot of times we bring this to you and
[50:03] then we expect god oh lord come down
[50:06] praise the lord and your whole thought
[50:08] life is filled with resentment towards
[50:10] people in the church and i say you need
[50:12] to hit an altar and say god purge me of
[50:14] this resentment of this brother and
[50:16] sister they are a brother they are a
[50:18] sister i i may not know them very well
[50:20] but it's not right for me to continue
[50:23] having these thoughts towards them
[50:26] i can show you a bible for it i can show
[50:28] you bible it's wrong to hold on to
[50:30] resentment and bitterness towards
[50:32] somebody who said something wrong
[50:34] against your family and you circle the
[50:36] wagons don't you be doing that buster is
[50:38] that christianity
[50:41] i might as well go on and say it you got
[50:43] something wrong
[50:44] then your first phone call is to you
[50:47] usually and i'm trying to teach you now
[50:49] is not to
[50:51] you not to someone else not to unload on
[50:53] somebody you
[50:55] scripturally the bible says you're if
[50:58] you have an all or they have it all
[50:59] against you you're supposed to go to
[51:01] that brother and that sister this isn't
[51:04] politics this isn't your your local
[51:07] school this is the house of god and
[51:10] though you may not think anybody's got
[51:12] the holy ghost there's some people here
[51:13] with the holy ghost and you're in the
[51:15] kingdom supposed to go to that person
[51:18] not one of your children
[51:20] not not wanna you can go to a deacon and
[51:23] that's fine but listen ultimately if
[51:25] you're acting mature i've got this all
[51:27] and i'm gonna go to that person because
[51:29] they are a brother
[51:30] they are a sister
[51:33] but instead instead of resolving it you
[51:35] unload on somebody else
[51:37] and then you hold that okay that's it
[51:39] you hold that thought
[51:43] you don't think i'm preaching to myself
[51:45] sometimes
[51:46] this week
[51:48] i admit it publicly and i don't do it to
[51:51] be proud i'm just saying i made a huge
[51:53] mistake this week
[51:54] oh well i better not say huge because
[51:56] people will be wondering what it is
[51:58] i'll just i'll tell you what it is i
[52:01] i got in the flesh and i got really
[52:03] i don't know if it was my righteous
[52:05] righteous indignation or just my human
[52:07] anger it doesn't matter i had to
[52:08] apologize for it i was on the phone with
[52:10] another brother not from here
[52:11] and i just said this and i said
[52:13] something demeaning about another
[52:14] brother because i feel like he acted
[52:16] wrong and i said it to this brother and
[52:18] the moment i said it i knew i'd said the
[52:20] wrong thing
[52:22] i i just i called him a certain name to
[52:25] belittle him i did it
[52:27] and i felt so bad i actually feel still
[52:29] grieved in my spirit
[52:30] but i've made it right to them and i've
[52:33] made it right before the lord
[52:36] and that's what god said to do with it
[52:39] i'm just being transparent with you you
[52:41] know i'm preaching that sunday on your
[52:42] thought life and i was doing good until
[52:45] that happened
[52:46] and then i realized there you go buddy
[52:49] you got to bring it before the throne of
[52:50] grace
[52:51] you can't let that hide you can't hold
[52:53] that resentment to that brother and you
[52:55] got to make that right right now
[52:57] i thank god i got the holy ghost in me
[52:58] to make it right right now
[53:01] it wasn't just my conscience was
[53:03] bothered man there's something deeper
[53:04] that say you can't let that go and i
[53:05] want to tell all you people who believe
[53:07] in the holy ghost you can't let those
[53:08] things go you can't come to this church
[53:11] with prejudice and attitudes towards
[53:14] other people that said something they
[53:17] have to grow you have to grow there has
[53:19] to be a forgiving heart to say i'm gonna
[53:22] not let that be my dominant thought
[53:25] because you know why
[53:26] you can never feel full freedom when you
[53:29] come to this church you can never
[53:32] worship freely if you hold thoughts in
[53:35] your mind against someone else you can't
[53:39] be totally free you will always be arms
[53:42] linked you will always be hesitant to
[53:44] give your full heart you'll always be
[53:46] that why where's it going on it's your
[53:48] thoughts
[53:50] binding you up
[53:52] i didn't expect to be so plain today but
[53:54] i pray it's in it's in the holy spirit's
[53:56] leadership to teach us you can't hold
[54:00] thoughts in a service or at home
[54:03] you can't do it you can't do it you
[54:05] can't let the holy spirit be free in
[54:06] your
[54:08] life every thought whether it's a dirty
[54:11] thought whether it's a filthy thought
[54:13] whether it's a resentment thought if
[54:15] it's not of god as we said last sunday
[54:17] you have the security and that thought
[54:20] has to go through security
[54:22] i remember how many kids remember what i
[54:24] did last sunday with solomon and gideon
[54:27] every thought has to come through
[54:29] security
[54:30] and be checked that's what the bible
[54:31] says
[54:33] like at our airports because we had a
[54:34] 911 and after 9 11
[54:37] then we get security
[54:39] and everyone's got everybody it's got to
[54:41] pass through every thought has to pass
[54:43] through security before it lodges in our
[54:45] mind
[54:48] if we hear a beep beep beep beep beep
[54:52] beep you don't you don't let him go
[54:54] through you don't let that thought go
[54:55] through
[54:56] resentment towards a brother or
[54:58] belittling or i don't believe
[55:00] i don't believe this miracle is for me i
[55:02] don't believe healing's for me it must
[55:04] be for everybody else you can't let that
[55:05] thought into your mind
[55:08] that's it buddy you're out don't get too
[55:10] good get on the plane
[55:12] this is the plane that only has
[55:14] passengers of the thoughts of god
[55:18] that's it it's over
[55:22] this incident
[55:24] with jesus let us know he perceived
[55:26] their thoughts
[55:27] and it was a crazy incident
[55:30] but i want you all to
[55:33] so just try to find a moment here and
[55:35] we'll finish the rest of this wednesday
[55:36] night
[55:37] i want to be mindful of
[55:41] the faith
[55:42] in your hearts
[55:45] building
[55:47] because that we're at a moment that we
[55:49] have some
[55:50] not talking about anybody specific but
[55:53] we have some
[55:54] mental emotional
[55:57] maybe financial
[55:59] some soul struggles
[56:02] internally in the thought life going on
[56:05] and i don't teach this just as a
[56:07] teaching i teach it so the believers can
[56:09] bind together
[56:10] to pray today for one another even if
[56:13] you're listening from our congregation
[56:14] online we're going to bind together and
[56:16] pray
[56:18] and we say lord we want to see an end
[56:21] to the devil's
[56:24] wreaking havoc
[56:26] on our sisters minds and our brother's
[56:28] minds
[56:30] and i'm just asking you to join with me
[56:32] in a few minutes
[56:35] do you believe if i pray for you and the
[56:37] ministers pray for you do you believe
[56:38] you can be healed
[56:41] it's not more any more complicated than
[56:43] that that's right
[56:44] do you know how many times the prophet
[56:46] said have your pastor pray for you
[56:50] and he kept doing that because remember
[56:51] he got into everybody had to come he had
[56:53] to be the prophet had to be him lay
[56:54] hands on him
[56:56] so he discouraged that he kept
[56:57] mentioning tons of quotes my wife took
[56:59] them up one time you get your pastor to
[57:01] pray for you lay hands on you you get
[57:03] your pastor to pray for you
