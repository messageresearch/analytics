you a firm foundation a firm foundation my solid my Solid Rock you can't be Shen you won't be stop be F you never leave you are the hope to which I cling a found a bur Foundation God my God you are my God you are a firm foundation my God you are Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 13 and verse 8 charity Divine love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whe whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away so Paul here and this is where my subject is from in 1 Corinthians 8 and the first three words there charity never faileth prophecies they'll fail tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish Away Paul here is actually bringing an eternal uh the Eternal part of what divine love is that if it never fails then it's Eternal it's always been there it'll always be there there are some temporal things in the ch Church like prophecies and like tongues that in the meaning of this means that they will fade away someday they will fade away prophecies will cease prophecies will fail knowledge shall vanish away so there are things even in the church that will vanish and fade away someday there are things that we won't need someday so there are things that will fade away but then there are things that are Eternal and things that will never fail and will never fade away and divine love is one of those things it will never ever fade away it'll never fail you it'll never fail because we know God can't fail God can't fail and so Paul's bringing in this eternal part that it can't fail other things will fail they'll vanish away but charity never faileth verse 9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so it shows what we're seeking for what we're looking after is not just to emphasize something that's temporal but to have our eyes not just toward something that's surface or temporal but to have our eyes on the Unseen and that which is eternal if you would go with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 I want to add a scripture in in relation to the Eternal and how we're to live looking at the Eternal and it says here Second Corinthians 4: 16 yes for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day so this a cycle that's happening that our outward man is perishing but our inward man is being renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment I I think it's interesting how Paul takes our life and the trials of it and all the suffering and caus it a light Affliction wow I want to look at my life like that our light Affliction in other words our life with all of its pain with all of its suffering with all the hurts and all the things people did wrong to us he's calling it when when you're looking at in light of Eternity it's just a light Affliction but isn't it amazing how big we make our afflictions and we make it bigger than God sometimes Paul says but our light Affliction is but for a moment it's working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen they're temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal and out of all the dimensions the many dimensions and vastness that we have covered about Divine love this one here today is not to be overlooked I want to take a look at it and I want to title this Divine Love Never Fails this part of divine love should not be overlooked uh we have appreciated all the different dimensions of looking at Divine love and its characteristics but this one is not to be overlooked and I felt to finish 1 Corinthians 13 and finish the scriptures and what and and ask what is the rest of 1 Corinthians 13 saying what does the rest of it say and this window that we've been calling it a window into the more excellent way he says there's a more excellent way then he gives the characteristics of that way it's divine love it's God's love it's it's it's agape love and then he explores in this little window in between this Corinthians which is a book of Correction the Corinthians is you could call it a book of Correction because Paul basically is setting things in order in the church that got out of order and so in the midst of all this correction and correcting the gifts and all these other things and setting he has this excellent way just sandwiched right in the middle and it's a window to the more excellent way to show us what it is this chapter stands separate to itself and it is looking at when a Christian breaks beyond the surface of feeling or temporal manifestations even of the spirit or temporal surges of Faith or temporal surges of Hope to bring the Christian beyond the surface surf to a depth to a depth of stability and power how many this morning that want to rais my hand I said I want to grow to more stability and Power in my life and not stay a surface Christian this is what Paul's trying to do there's a more excellent way there's manifestations of the spirit there's prophecies there's giving to the poor there's uh there's an understanding all the Mysteries he takes all of that but he says that's all these things are all temporal if you get knowledge of something it's all temporal but there's something Eternal in here and there's something beyond the surface of living every day by surfaced feeling let me just say that right away Christians cannot live by sight they must live by faith and Christians cannot live off of their feelings Christians cannot live by their feelings you cannot judge your day and judge your Christian walk and judge your fellowship with God based upon how you feel because from one day to the next you will feel very different one day you'll feel good one day you'll feel saved the next day you won't feel saved and those days when you don't feel saved Satan likes those days and he capitalizes it and he's in your ear on your shoulder saying that's right not only do you not feel saved I wonder if you're even saved at all boy he's a quite an enemy isn't he so hey we can't live off of our feelings we can't live with our feelings as the dominant king that's setting in our heart that's dictating our life every day that this is how I feel this is how and a lot of times people will conclude on matters conclude a lifelong confusion conclusion based upon their feelings of what happened based upon lack of facts and based upon well I feel this way so it must be true we can't do do that we can't live on feelings we have to live deeper than that and this is a realm into which we are coming to live in a way that perfect Faith which worketh by perfect love Masters every circumstance it's a Deeper Life of stability and Power in the Christian's Life by the Holy Ghost it's a realm of mastering every circumstance that comes our way so this characteristics of Love Never Love Never failing this characteristic should not be over look that love never fails Paul is saying we enjoy faith we enjoy prophecies and I want to just get this across it doesn't mean that we eliminate what he's saying here that it'll it'll fail prophecies will fail these things will cease knowledge will fade away it doesn't mean we those things stop happening as a manifestation of the spirit but what it means is they will fade away they are temporal I didn't intend to say this but I I I years ago the Lord showed me that there are things are you listening there are things that God gave us in the Bible as as as rules and guidelines and protections and boundaries that we will not need when we get on the other side can you say amen and when you start breaking down teaching what we teach about young people and the boundaries and not touching one another before marriage and all these other things these is this is all in the scripture and it's what God gave us to live in this life of sexual temptation of our flesh taking over it it he gives us the Holy Ghost but he gives us guidelines from the Old Testament to the new and we can't dump those things out we need them for this life you can't mock or ignore the preachers that are preaching God's guidelines for sexual Temptation there's some things in here he gave us for this life and we honor that but we won't need it for the other life we won't need the scriptures for sexual Temptation in the other cuz there won't be any demons there there won't be any lust there can you say Amen there won't be any of that there it'll be gone there won't be de no devil there there won't be any accuser of the Brethren there won't be no sickness can you say Amen we won't need the scriptures to apply Faith to Divine Healing to believe God can heal the sick we won't need those scriptures anymore because we'll never get sick but do we need them now yes so Paul says we enjoy faith we enjoy prophecies we enjoy knowledge especially when it's from the Lord but it will only have a season to it it will fade it will have a temporal help for you you know how many know that you can be prayed for and completely healed by the atonement but you're going to get sick again sometimes so your healing sometimes is temporal now sometimes somebody's healed that's it they're prayed for they don't have that problem again they don't have that eye problem again it's over can you say Amen but but if we live in these bodies we're going to get sick with something else again so our healing can be tempered Al and and so because of that we it's a season it will fade it has a temple help for us but you see we can't put all of our eggs in one basket we can't live solely upon knowledge why it'll fade someday we can't rest our Eternal destination on temporal things they will fade they will have certain limitations to it and to the Corinthians you can't Paul says you can't put an emphasis on these things too much because they are temporal in other words you can't have all your eggs in one basket you can't take a prophecy or you can't take knowledge and put all your eggs in one basket and say that's it that is my that I I rest my eternal destination upon the knowledge that I have you can't do that because it's temporal it will fade away amen but perfect love never Fades never fails it's constant it never walks away God's perfect love for you will never never ever walk away when you fail when you fail his love will not fail how many raise your hand said I failed before but his love don't fail you it's going to keep trying it's going to keep loving you it's going to keep drawing you and there'll always be something if you're a daughter of God or Son of God there's always something down there you got all this stuff on the outside all the guilt and the shame that goes with it all the things you've done wrong that's all the stuff but down here if something's churning that's because God's still dealing with you and that means his love never fails I don't care what you've done his love never fails it never gives up it's constant it never walks away why it was it because his love is not wavering by emotions by Feelings by Life Changes by people his love doesn't change with people because people change his love doesn't is not wavered and moved and changed by emotions or feelings or the stock market or losing a job or gaining a job or his love does not fail during those times his love is constant it's always there but perfect love never faades it never fails it's constant it's not moved by feelings or the stock market or insurance policies or sickness life is that seasons change good and bad things end lives fade away even good lives loved ones will die even good things in life will pass away but his love is still here aren't you glad God takes people from us but he doesn't take himself from us his love is still here it'll never fail you people leave us us people hurt us but his love stays with us Paul's teaching the Corinthians who need they need correction they were sensationally driven they were feeling driven putting all things on sensation or prophecies or emotion you know the Corinthians had great Services they had great Services Spirit-filled pouring out of the spirit tongues interpretation of tongues praise be to God from Pentecost those things would happen and even happen happen have them happen today but you see now it the Corinthians put their emphasis all on that and Paul could recognize it they didn't see it but Paul could see you're putting way too much emphasis on this and if you put it on it feels good it visibly feels like more signs are here and more things are happening it feels better it's a confirmation that God is with us the problem with that is when that is over when that feeling is gone how many can raise your hand and say I have felt the presence of the Lord anybody says no you can't feel it oh yeah you can you might be feeling it today that that you feel don't be afraid of that don't be afraid of thatall it's him coming near us you never you can be afraid of a lot of things but you need to don't need to be afraid of what you feel in your heart in the presence of the Lord the problem is when it's all over sometimes uh people start to wonder well we didn't have a service like that so is God With Us Now what a terrible thing to say all things from God are good but some things are temporary can you say amen and that feeling that I felt and I feel it this morning I love it but I can tell you that feeling isn't always there but there is something that's always there that I can't get away from it's the unfailing love of God that has never failed me never left me amen say I didn't feel the presence of God with you may not feel the presence of God but you have no scripture to say he left you his love can't leave you it can't fail you it can't stop it can't end now friends shouldn't we be interested in something in a world that's failed Us in people who have failed us even preachers have failed us isn't it isn't it not time for us to latch on to with all of our hearts something that never will fail us never will his love will never fail it'll still be there no matter what we go through no matter what people have done no matter what our trials his love is constant it's still there it's still drawing your heart never gives up never fails never will fade away always will be there I've got some wonderful memories of feeling the presence of God in my life being on spiritual highs like never dreamed of I've got some wonderful memories of camp meetings sometimes in our own Services I'll tell you uh there's been times even our own Services I felt like shouting running the aisles and sometimes I ran the aisles but you see now I don't judge how close I am to the Lord by how fast I ran the aisles okay because I may have felt good I felt blessings I felt Liberty but when I get in my car for some reason when I get in my car are the devil's in my car he's there he's on my shoulder he's whispering in my ear he's distracting me to all the you know I'm going to call it the devil you come out of be a service you be thinking of things of God and rejoicing and all of a sudden he's got you thinking about your business what you got to do Monday what you got to do Tuesday you better do this and all of a sudden pressure starts to come in a matter of 10 minutes the all the glory that you felt is went out the window of the car was it really that [Music] important but it's temporary I've learned it in these great mountains what I've learned in my Christians experience if it's a blessing to you today to know this is those I've learned this journey isn't always a mountain this journey has valleys God loves to hear Hallelujah from the valley when I was a young Christian I was not saying hallelujah from the valley I don't know what I was saying but it wasn't that but that's what God wants to hear it's easy to shout hallelujah from the mountains it's easy to shout when you're at church it's easy to shout hallelujah at camp meeting but it's in the valley he wants to hear the Praises of God glory be to God praise our God in the middle of a valley I learned that there's not just mountains in this journey there's Valley but one of the greatest things I've learned is there's a constant in my life there's a constant I might have mountains I might have valleys but there's something always constant there's something always consistent the God on the mountain is still God in the valley and when I crash I just fall back on him amen one Minister said here when you fall if you're going to fall you may fall but when you all fall back on him when I crash I fall back on him and his love has never failed it's never changed something really strong keeps holding me something keeps holding me something stronger than myself something stronger than my good feelings at meetings or the bad feelings during The Valleys something stronger than what people feel about me something stronger is in my life there's a constant in my life and it's the love of God Divine Love Never Fails we've seen people with their up ups and downs and watching other people ups and downs and ins and outs and sometimes I say Lord you know I've labored for their lives I prayed for their lives and just still that roller coaster up and down and up and down I say oh God if that's in my own life take it out but let let me cling to the constant that's in my life let me cling to the consistency that's in my life something stronger than myself when I come from my own inconsistencies and I have to apologize and God God forgive me you know that's the thing is that the devil takes failures we're not we got to look at this from an eternal perspective because from an eternal perspective your failures don't make you a failure well is it you didn't know that well wake up and smell the coffee because you f failed does it make you a failure not in God's kingdom not in an eternal perspective can you say amen amen and I'm sure a few of us this morning have failed just raise your hand just a few of us all right but because you failed doesn't make you a failure not in God's eyes amen but that's where the devil likes to take it he likes to take it and your inconsistencies and other people's inconsistencies dominate your Christian walk can dominate your life for Untold years we've got to stop that today we've got to stop that and we've got to look at something that's constant in our life we may be inconsistent other people may be inconsistent but there's something that's never inconsistant it's always there and always will be there fathers fail us mothers fail us siblings fail us cousins fail us uncles fail us churches fail us but please get my message this morning there's one thing that will never fail you and that's the love of God in your life thank you for
