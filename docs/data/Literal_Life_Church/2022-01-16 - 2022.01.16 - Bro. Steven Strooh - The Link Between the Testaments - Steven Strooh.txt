TRANSCRIPT
========================================
kind of what roles from one scripture to another so you're welcome to follow along in your bibles i i have been given a strict time frame sister julie so not to worry and you know i'm taking off my watch i see that i'm 15 minutes behind schedule here brother paul's want you to notice that um so little boy asked his mom what does it mean when the preacher takes off his watch and does that and she said absolutely nothing so at least if if i see something that's going to make me concerned it's when people are holding their watch up to the ear to hear if it's still ticking because things seem to be going slowly so i'll take that as a queue so uh we really appreciate uh being here this morning what i'm going to be doing is a little bit difficult um in uh less than four or five hours which is the parameters that i was given so so what i'm what i've done is i've broken it up quite extensively so the first part is going to be this keystone we're going to talk about the keystone um the next and we're going to talk about the arc today as well um we're going to start with that picture and then we get into the keystone but i'm also going to introduce you to the dna pattern that god laid out in in the dna now you know that that was really in the 1970s that they really made a good uh francis crick made a you know created the picture of the dna that you know the two strands that intertwine what i didn't realize is that there was a a gospel story in that dna structure very very critical uh to our understanding of scripture actually and then as you'll see as we just introduced that topic this morning but what i'd like to do with brother paul's permission and if you guys can stand it i notice a lot of people aren't here today because they heard it was coming so if if we can stand it out i might be able to come back and do the second part of this which will actually be about the dna and how that um how that is a natural picture of something we see in scripture so uh with that uh being said let's get started so in hebrews nine uh there's uh paul talks about the blood of bulls and goats and then in verse 14 he says how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god so if we take out that little explanation in the middle how much more shall the blood of christ purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god so purging your conscience this is a a this is a scripture for all ages but is it more so for today the anxieties and the pressures and the the guilt and everything that is is laid on people today i mean if you don't wear a mask you're guilty of something you know i'm not saying that you shouldn't wear a mask or you should that's not the point the point is we're we're constantly being challenged by the by the woke people in the world about some other issue you know it's it's you don't even know that you're doing something and you're offending somebody and it's because you're made to feel guilty about so many things right and and everybody's virtue signaling everybody wants to be more virtuous than the other person in the culture and so this scripture is going into the base of belief and uh and sin and uh the fact that peter remember in the epistle he says that baptism even so does baptism save us not from the putting away of the filth of the flesh but of the answer of a good conscience toward god so you can see that this is obvious that there's that we have conscience paul said that even the even the sinners do by nature the things of god in other words our conscience so the blood of christ is central to this theme in other words you can't get anywhere if you don't go through the blood right so we have to have that purging of our conscience then in verse 15 he goes on and he says for this cause and this is so direct for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament anytime you see the first testament or the old testament will be in red anytime you see the new testament will be in blue so you can keep that cue going so the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they are called that they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance so he ties the blood the good conscience the mediator between the new and the old testament for those who are the called who then are eligible for this promise of eternal inheritance so you can see that paul's tying this all together and the important thing that i want you to take away from today's service is the old and the new testament in order to fully commune with god you have to be able to commune through the old and the new testament you you have to see how they come together so when teachers start talking about this type or that shadow or this principle from the old testament it's not just interesting it's critical to our ability to commune with god because he's communing with us through his word his spirit on his word is the way god talks to us so if we can't bring all the the the the word of god together make it fit we can't really commune with god so um if somebody says to me why was jesus baptized and and i say well it's because there was a there was a commandment in the old not a commandment there was a principle in the old testament that required that the high priest is washed and that the blood was put on his ear his thumb and his toe and that he would be anointed with oil all right and by the prophet so when jesus went to get baptized and john snow i need to be baptized of you and jesus says no it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness righteousness to a jew is the law and so john does the sort of heal to the you know foreign uh response of course and he baptizes jesus without further argument because he knew is that leviticus 8 has the story of when moses prepared aaron to be the high priest and he baptized he washed him he took the anointing oil and poured it on him he took the blood from the sacrifice put it on his ear his thumb and his toe and that absolutely represented what happened to jesus he was baptized and then of course he was the holy spirit came down his anointing and then at calvary uh the crown of thorns with blood on his ear his hands and his feet were nailed and so that requirement for a high priest was fulfilled so when the scripture says that he's the mediator of the new testament that by his death redemption sins under the first testament the old testament they which are the called might receive the promise of eternal so jesus didn't come and set up a new system that didn't bear any resemblance to the past on the contrary he was absolutely following the pattern that was laid out in the altar and if he hadn't he wouldn't be the mediator he wouldn't be the crowd now i i'll get to this word mediator so a mediator is one who intervenes between two either in order to make or restore peace or for ratifying a covenant and we'll see a scripture in a minute that speaks to this a mediator is a medium of communication an arbitrator so when we look to christ when we look to the one who's the mediator between the old and the new testament that ability for us to see how that measures together is a medium of communication it's a way for us to have the word speak to us in a very special way right so galatians chapter 3 verse 24 says wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith what is a school master in this context it's a tutor but especially it's a guardian and a guide for boys so in other words as we're growing in maturity in the word it's helpful for us to have a tutor and who's the tutor well ultimately it's the holy spirit but it's the holy spirit through the old testament that's bringing us to when i've done bible studies in revelation and which i've done for years and years sometimes that's how long it took uh just for a couple of chapters um just so you know in four hours you know it's a bit of a constraint so when when i did that what i found was that so many people had no background if i wanted to talk about joseph as a type or moses as a type or elijah and elisha they didn't know those stories they didn't go to sunday school and so i saw um sister elizabeth this morning with the barbel story arthur maxwell's bible story series and i highly recommend that if you're looking for back thank you she's holding it up so um i highly recommend that it's what i grew up on as a child my my folks bought one of those every every month and it was just it was just so wonderful uh to get that foundation and that's what people need they need that foundation in the old testament because that's the school master to bring us to christ all right so and obviously that's as you're learning the scripture as you mature all right now you're no longer needing as much of that old testament understanding what you need now is the mediator to bring those two things together to be in the new testament but with that background with that and now you can stand on your own feet so paul talks about the milk of the word versus the meat of the word so you can see how this is tying together now in galatians chapter 3 verse 17 and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ so christ confirmed the covenant that was made to abraham about a promised son that was christ christ confirmed the covenant and even though there was 430 years from abraham until isaac was born because remember they went through the the the period of captivity if you like in egypt with the law which was 430 years after remember the law came during their travels to the promised land cannot disa null that it should make the promise of effect so john chapter 6 63 says the words that are speaking to you they are spirit and they are life you see that was jesus ministry at least um in his three and a half year ministry ultimately it was to die on calvary but in that three and a half years that wasn't you know kind of just a allow you know between baptism and death that was a very important time when jesus was actually bringing those old testament principles to life he was actually he says the words that i speak to you they are spirit and life in other words i'm going to put life into that old doctrine that you heard i'm gonna make it make sense to you and you remember when the disciples were on the road to mass and they and they they he stopped and he opened the scriptures and he went through all the scriptures concerning who he was that made all the difference up until that point the disciples with all due respect and maybe the sermon won't make it to heaven but uh they didn't know what was going on they were a little bit clueless all right and their expectations were all over the board from you know judas who wanted a insurrection to peter who wanted to cut off people's ears and he was going to be a soldier i mean they were all over the board right and jesus had to rebuke them and but once the holy spirit came but it's all different right now they're able to understand what it is that jesus really came to do and so that's what jesus was setting the scene for and saying that the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life and just uh just so you understand this word life is that word zoe so you hear brother branham talk about zoe life the that's the literal life of god right so literal life tabernacle i thought it's a good place to put that in brother paul and so zoe is that kind of life and it's not just any life it's this supernatural life so in the natural we also have uh something that illustrates life the that's the that's the program of life or the language of life and that's the dna it controls every living cell when we allow the bible to control our lives then the word of god is the language of eternal life so you can see how important it is because you notice there's two strands in in the dna you have to have the old and the new testament and you have to have what's in between so this this will be what we get into next time why are there four gospels they all tell the same story of jesus but each one gives a slightly different viewpoint but all pertain to eternal life in christ i i'm reading that and it's on the screen but i want you to to think about telling the same story so brother branham says unless you can see jesus in every page of the bible you miss him and go back to it again but it's because it's all telling the same story and i'll give you an illustration of that as we rush through here 15 minutes in by the way for those that are watching so the um the illustration that kind of makes the best sense to me um is that we're we're always um [Music] aware of the fact that there is a seed gene these are words that are common to us but when you understand that dna is the building is the is the program that actually creates the body does it make sense every seed is given its own body if i can put it this way every dna will create its own body all right and we are that body so what's the program of life where does this eternal life come from well it doesn't just magically appear it comes from the fact that we're attributes of god we were the dna of god and if i can put it just quickly in this way we'll get more into this but god has human attributes as well as divine attributes all right and but it's all part of god so when we look at ourselves in the context of being part of god we that dna that is made making his body was in god to begin with it's part of god so the human expression of the divine life was part of god's plan from the beginning adam and evil the prime example all right expressing his life all right in a human form that didn't come out of nowhere now god's not part animal but god is part human if i can put it that way or rather humans are part god quite a quite a thought isn't it but that um that the dna helps us to understand that and you say well what did brother branham say about dna well i don't know if this quote is about dna or not i like to think it is i don't know what else it could be but brother branham says in perseverance in 1963 he says two little strings the new and the old testament holding jesus between them [Music] and that's not dna i don't know what it is i'm open to suggestions but that strikes me as being something that brother branham saw in in a in a macroscopic level that wasn't discovered yet that i know of so if if it was discovered then then he was led to read about that discovery but as far as i know it was the 1970s so let's uh let's look at this um in terms of the four ministries of christ the the uh four gospels uh so let the left hand uh curly bit be the uh the red bit be the old testament and the right hand curly bit that's the that's the new testament so that's setting the scene for next time so if you're curious about that please come back and tell your friends so the ministry of jesus this is where i was my title the link between the testaments the link between the testament is jesus and his ministry obviously comes between the new and the old testament so he is that link that ties the old and the new testament together and and paul says in ephesians chapter 2 verse 16 that he might reconcile remember he's the mediator he's between the two the two pieces right just like the dna just like the old and the new testament that he might reconcile both and to god in one body by the cross so remember he was talking about jew and and gentile in the middle wall of petition and so forth so for the jews it was the old testament now they have the new testament church but the cross of calvary jesus holds that together and that's why it's in the middle that's why there's four gospels we'll talk about that later and paul just makes us super clear to the corinthians he says for i've determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified because that's the starting point that's where the old and the new testament come together where everything in the old testament now starts to make sense so brother branham says this in 1965 in december 1965 obviously a famous uh service in in the rapture jesus was the keystone between the old and the new testament because he had to first die and then be raptured he died came to life walked around here with us and then was raptured up because he was the key stone that tied the two together so let's look at an old testament example so i've talked about it but now i want to actually show you how this works so i was so pleased because when you have 178 slides on a subject and you're only allowed to use 30 or something you you begin to wonder if you've got the right ones because you know i'm going you're going to go back to the crooks house after this with a pool you know i wanted to make sure at least i got some supper i wasn't sent to bid without any supper so i had to make some adjustments all right so so sister julie was at the family camp in 19 2001 where i preached a one hour sermon in three hours and the food went cold and it was a nightmare for the folk in the kitchen and sister julie has a long memory so so i i i'm under orders so this is the uh the what's called the ark of the testament or the ark of the covenant let's read about it exodus chapter 25 verse 22 and there i will meet you and i'll commune with thee remember i said we have to have the old and the new testament talking to each other understandably linked so that we can talk to god that god can talk to us our communion with god is in both testaments why do we have two ears all right old testament new testament so you can see and then let this mind be in you that was also in christ so we have to be able to take that old testament and and unite it seamlessly with the new testament just by the way paul what was paul's job in the natural what did paul do other than preach tent maker what's a tent maker good at sewing panels of canvas together all right and if a tent is gonna leak where is it gonna leak it's gonna leak at the seams if the seams aren't done correctly it's going to leak through those loopholes right in the where the two seams come together so for paul to be an excellent tent maker meant he was very good at sewing two pieces of fabric together so they didn't leak and we don't want our knowledge of the old testament and the new testament to leak all right we need it to be tightly held together properly properly positioned so that it can perform its function and that's what the two uh parts communing together it why it's so important and he says that he will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony so he's going to commune with us from between the two cherubim okay so hold that thought so in hebrews chapter 9 paul's saying this and after the second veil going through into the holy of holies the ark of the covenant which was a figure for the time then present it was representing something else it wasn't just about the ark and the tablets of stone and aaron's rod that budded it was more than that the showbread it was more than that it was a symbol of something that was coming it was it was a figure for that time so why don't we have an ark up here brother paul i mean isn't this supposed to be like the holy of holies well we do have it it's called our bible it's the old and the new testament and you can't fly with one wing you fly with one ring you go around in circles that's what happens to a lot of people when they when they emphasize one testament over the other they're a bit lopsided and they go around in circles so we need to have a balance in the word and that's because we understand because as school master prepared us properly to understand the new testament now we can put forth our wings as eagles and run and not be weary amen all right sorry so exodus chapter 25 verse 20 and 21 and the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be so i was saying i was felt confident to go down this road this morning when i went into brother paul's uh office and he has a actual model of the ark and it's and it's a very good model they're not all so good but if you look at that picture it's very similar to the ark that brother paul has on his uh in his office so it's wonderful but the point that i'm going to bring you to today that's important is that their faces shall look one to another so brother branham says put down in between the arch of the wings of these cherubim was a supernatural light hanging in there which was the halo of god that lit the whole room so where was christ in the in the holy place just a a pillar of fire just you know we sometimes see the pictures in the books you know the tall pillar of fire coming out of the top of the of the of the um sister loretta it's lovely to see you i didn't see you over there god bless you mo you see um brother branham had an angel you know that was with him all the time and so i'm really glad when kathy comes because then i've got my angel with me so thank you very much but so but kathy's shining so brightly i didn't see sister loretta so lovely to see you sister loretta so it's not necessarily that big pillar of fire that we see in the pictures where brother branham calls that halo the pillar of fire and it's between the wings of the cherubim it's on it's in the space in between the two cherubim that's important so let's uh picture ourselves walking into the holy of holies it's a bit dimly lit until obviously the spirit of god comes in and brother random says between the arch of the wings of this chairman was a supernatural light could it be the same supernatural light that we see in the photograph that's the way i've represented it who knows so obviously this whole um box is the ark and then between the wings is the mercy seat that we just read about and then you have the two cherub on either side cherubim it's funny i don't understand the plural brother rap maybe you you understand that so cherub is singular cherubim is plural but in the bible they're always called cherubims so i'm confused so anyway i just think they're cherubs i don't know if that's right or maybe they are actually cherubim and then of course one can be representing the old testament the other one can be representing the new testament and what's in between is christ and it's in the form of the four gospels that come between the old and the new can you see that picture all right so let's look at this idea that their faces shall look one to another all right what does that mean they're seeing eye to eye all right they're looking at each other and if you want to put it this way you can say they're in agreement you know if you say i see eye to eye with this brother it means we're in agreement so that old and the new testament were never supposed to be opposing forces they were never supposed to be oh that's the old testament this is the new testament you understand they're in a complete agreement if you don't see that agreement you've missed something because you haven't been to the school master you haven't had the training and the teaching that you need to understand how the old testament and the new testament comes together i told you about those revelation bible studies that i did the first three chapters of revelation and two years every tuesday night for about two hours okay just so you know four hours is is quite a stretch for me all right to fit everything in four hours um so you know two hours on a wednesday or tuesday night was also hard but the thing that i was so blessed by is the pentecostal couple that started coming uh they uh he said to me he said after eight or nine months of these bible studies he said i've learned more in these eight months then i've learned eight years in my church because we were tying the old and the new testament together and i will tell you it's very satisfying it's very satisfying because in our heart of hearts we know they should be in agreement we know they should be talking to each other and we know that our means of communication is through their agreement we're able to come to christ because these two testaments are in agreement okay amen so the old testament example of the two cherubims see above the ark represents the new and the old testament that agree with each other as the old testament is the shadow or outline of the new testament there's a key right there all right so thinking of old testament faith old testament faith now we're at half an hour okay old testament faith is the physical restricted promised land that was given to abraham by god that was their promised land what is our promised land we'll get to that when they were called on to fight for every foot on which every step of which every uh what is the scripture every step on which your foot shall tread something sorry but for every step that they took they had to fight for that ground though it was promised to them they had to take it they that god wasn't just going to deliver to them on a platter they had to fight for it and they fought as humans they fought with natural swords now of course can god supernaturally do something he did it many times for them but nevertheless the overall principle was they were fighting for every inch of ground that they were taking and they hated those who killed them so if somebody killed some one of them they went and retaliated and wiped out a whole village because that was the way it worked back then and if you were to be blessed in the old testament like job or abraham you were blessed in natural material things remember job when he came through his trials he got double what he had lost all right god the bible says he was restored double what he had lost and that was the sign that he had come through the the trial with flying colors because in the physical realm he got twice as many you say well uh-huh brother stephen i know that story he got the same number of children back he didn't get twice as many children but remember the other children job was making sacrifice for them they were already in heaven so he did get double because he now had twice as many children because they were already in heaven right so it still works okay so that's the material world of the old testament now let's look at it in terms of the new testament the promise is the holy spirit that's what our promises we're going we are promised the holy spirit and to you and to your children all those that are afar off and our land is to live by every word that's written in the bible the member of israel that was promised was boarded on all four sides by water from the river euphrates to the north to the river of egypt which is wadi al-irish to the south and of course the jordan uh to the uh let's see the east and the mediterranean to the west and so that was the natural boundaries of the promised land uh that was that was promised to to abraham and what are our boundaries it's still the word all right but what happens when the word drives up that's when those 100 million are contributing the number 200 million demons are released from their river euphrates it's when the word dries up that's when those demons are released okay so that's a just a thought to be to be thinking about so the word is our promised land and of course now we're saved as individuals not as a nation and it's by grace not by the law so that god can guide us and use us for his will rather than having us pursue our own will so in the old testament they were given the ability to pursue it in their own will they were given the power they were given the knowledge they were given the instruction to take the land all right but we have to relinquish our will and yield our will to god which jesus illustrated and mary illustrated not you know be it unto me according to that will and jesus said not my will be done but that and so now we're seeing jesus as the mediator between the old and the new testament showing us the change in the transition from the old to the new and this is just one example so the physical realm is no longer the main aim all right our main aim is to get ready for the coming of the lord all right and we have no natural enemies that we need to be concerned about because we fight against sin and error we don't fight against human beings if you're targeting a human being you're missing the mark that's not the target what i have done in the past when somebody's really in my face and being rude and aggressive i look to the right of him just to his shoulder and i can and i say in my mind i can see you i see who you are i know i know you i've dealt with you before and i'm not looking at the poor individual he's being used by satan at that time i'm looking over his shoulder the one that's whispering in his ear and i tell you what that helps you have a lot of sympathy for the individual that's that's speaking to you because you know he's in a lot worse shape than you are until you let him hop onto your shoulder which unfortunately we do because again if your spirit comes in agreement with that spirit there's a there's a it jumps over so you always have to keep yourself aware of where the battle is it's not against flesh and blood it's against powers and principalities right and our sword we don't go around cutting off people's ears our sword is the word of god so you can see how the understanding of the old testament informs our understanding of the new testament so jesus said to to pray for those who who who despitefully use you and say all men are of evil against you falsely for my name's sake and how many of us have experienced that in the church world when it says for my name's sake i often question if anybody's in the in the in the church world is being persecuted because they don't even know the name and so they can't be persecuted for his namesake because they don't know the name all right but it's it's our reaction to that to pray for them that uh despise you and evil evilly use you right so we love those who hate or even kill us because whether we win or lose in the physical world is not of first importance in our lives so when somebody says something offensive or does something or hurtful or whatever that's not the battle that's your natural man reacting naturally but that's not the battle the battle is against spiritual powers and wickedness and high places right that's the battle that's brother paul talked about that right the the battle that's in our mind in our thoughts that's where we need to be aggressive that's where we need to be confronting our enemy not your poor fellow citizens on earth in the new testament the most important thing is not to gain wealth it's not to have lots of sheep it's not to have a a big fancy chariot all right it's to get saved then we've got to live holy and receive the baptism of the holy spirit you'll know that as justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit but let me warn you against jargon those words mean a lot to us i mean we've been grown up with that brother rap did a a whole series called decoding and it's to take some of the terminology and break it down and i've took a lesson from that brother rep and so we can just say get saved and everybody knows what we're talking about up to a point and live holy everybody understands that and then receive the bachelors of the holy spirit the problem is without an understanding of the old testament they don't even know what holiness means they don't understand the concept in fact brother paul was telling me some well-known people actually are sarcastic about the standard that message people have all right because they they see that as um as some kind of fabrication some kind of artificial put on and and no doubt they've experienced that right where you know the catholic uh priests when they when they have to come out and do the transubstantiation and take the the bread and the and the wine and turn it into the literal body of christ that's a scary thing you remember the martin luther movie remember how he was shaking at the altar thinking that you know this him as a sinner was going to have to perform this this task but what he was told and what priests are told is that when they put on those vestments it doesn't matter how drunk they are it doesn't matter how immoral they've been living when they put on those vestments they've put on holiness and now they can come to that altar boldly so think about it in terms of your own life when those people are sarcastic it's because they've seen the hypocrisy of putting on the outside but not living it from the inside all right and they it's like putting on a vestment it's like i've put on my clothes so now i look right but that doesn't mean you are right all right the oil comes from the inside out and so it's very important that we don't fall into that trap of thinking that we're putting on our vestments now it's okay i heard that yeah sometimes in the church world even if they have some kind of a dress standard at church it's only for church so as long as you do this in church you're okay but outside of church you can wear anything that's exactly the same thing coming into church and putting on the vestment all right doesn't make you holy and what is the reason for being saved living holy and receiving the baptism of the holy spirit that's the beginning not the end that's how we start the real purpose of god going to all the trouble of bringing up the stinky vessel out of the mud and cleaning it up and filling it up is to put it into service we're to be positioned according to the giftings and the and the the talents that god has given us so let's go back to genesis chapter one the first thing that happened was there was light the darkness that was around the earth was dispelled and light struck the earth all right that's getting saved then the second thing that happened was the waters separated from the waters and the waters from the dry land so separation was the characteristic of the second day living holy separating from the old things and then on the third day life came into the seed that's the baptism of the holy spirit forgive me for all of you have heard this all before but the fourth day is what i want to concentrate on the fourth day is when the sun and the moon and the stars were positioned for a purpose sun move over there you're going to rule the day moon you're going to rule the night stars you're going to be for signs and for seasons and for days and years so when the sun is gone the moon and the stars are all we have to guide us the sinner's bible remember we're the sinner's bible that's like the stars in heaven so when you look up in the night sky and you see orion you see the pleiades you you see the big bear you see these constellations you go oh that's that direction oh that's that direction how do we get our direction from the stars you see that so those those things were created in verse 1 in the in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth the earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep so that positioning of the sun moon and stars came on the fourth day they weren't created on the fourth day he said he made them on the fourth day and he made them for a purpose that's our adoption and so you can see how important this is that we understand even from genesis 1 to understand salvation okay so what are we doing here in the new testament what's our goal in the old testament was to get to the promised land it was to have as many children as possible and and your seed shall be as the as the sand of the sea and the stars of heaven that was their mission all right our mission is that we're in training for raining we're gonna reign with him and this whole experience here brother brandon said anything we take with us is our character is training so i want to just encourage everybody we've all made mistakes we've all gone through difficult times we've all had backslidden moments years months lifetimes and yet it's all training it's all god building us up into his image those stones that built up the the tabernacle those were not perfect stones they weren't shaped with precision absolutely square if you look at any of the buildings of that time they're all misshapen stones that actually fit together very very well supernaturally if you like but not all the same so there's something about unity that i always like to mention because unity is a big subject we always want to have unity we don't want to have uh you know dissension within our ranks but remember unity is not uniformity uniformity is what you see when you look at a monastery and you see all those nuns coming out looking exactly the same that's uniformity we are not interested in uniformity we're all different made for a different purpose for a different time for in in a different place and we have different shapes and i can tell you that if you're rubbing shoulders with somebody and it's not quite comfortable it's because they've got pieces that are sticking out in the wrong places and you might have pieces that are sticking out in the wrong places for them but it's all part of god's economy it's all part of god's plan and it's training us for reigning so when we have to judge when we have to make decisions uh for the kingdom of god especially in the millennium obviously as the natural part of that we're accustomed to these things we understand them so never be concerned about the training period when you fall down and you and and something breaks if you weren't falling down and something was breaking you wouldn't be being trained think about any time you're learning something or training there's always this period where i don't know if i'm ever going to get this it's exactly the same in the kingdom of god and of course it's actually a lot harder because the lessons are so much more serious so somebody said to me but god doesn't tempt us so i want you to picture somebody being trained to climb a hill to climb a mountain and i see brother john there and sister laura lovely to see you and the girl nice to nice to see the family but brother john knows this from from military training i also went through some but they put you through some rugged circumstances and that's not because they're trying to hurt you they're trying to make sure you won't get hurt at some stage so if you're training to be a mountain climber they're putting you on steeper and steeper and steeper slopes and driving you up there to build the stamina to build the muscles to get used to the climate all of those things so that when you get to actually climb the mountain you're prepared for it you've been trained for it it's hard going through the training but if it wasn't for that training it would be much harder so when when god puts us through a training exercise an obstacle course if you like he's not trying to hurt us he's trying to build us up and the ministry when you sometimes feel like you know the ministry is a bit harsh remember the the purpose of the ministry is the edification or the building up of the body and how's that done it's done by training it's done by exercising by going through those steps over and over until they become automatic until they become natural and so that's what you're going through brother and sister and if just think about it i'm going to rule and reign with him one day and what i'm doing now is going to be what i'm going to take with me into eternity all right so christianity is the only religion in the world that follows the blueprint of a previous religion this is tying the old and the new testament together right so there's an importance to this because it's the only religion in the world that does that there's no other religion that has an old testament there's no old bhagavad-gita it doesn't exist right there's only the bhagavad-gita you understand so buddhism is buddhism right there's no like pre-buddhism it's buddhism and so this is very important that we understand when we talk about judeo-christian we are the only ones who have that term the old and the new judeo-christian all right so the new testament is the fulfillment of the old testament but here's the point gosh it's already 45 minutes okay god only speaks to us when we make the new testament and the old testament agree with each other that's the message from the ark that's how god speaks to us so we all want god to speak to us right we want him to speak to us from his word but if you only have half the signal you're only catching every second word that's hardly a way to have a conversation you need the sentence to be complete you need the whole word of god not just a portion of it do you mind if i take off my jacket brother paul this is for the second three hours uh okay so exodus chapter 25 verse 22 just to remind you what it says i'll meet you then i'll with you from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims so the word speaks to us when we make the new and the old testament agree with each other and that's why jesus came between the two testaments in the four gospels because it's telling us the story of his life the ministry of jesus which is what's tying the two pieces together because if you just had the old testament that would be one picture if you just had the new testament that would be another picture but when you put it together then the picture is complete so at kaddish brother brennan preaches this in 1956 at kaddish bonier all the old testament and all of its characters and characteristics was only a foreshadow of the keystone the new testament that joined the law and this dispensation together joined the law and this new testament dispensation together so brother branham's saying there's a keystone between the two how many of you know what a keystone looks like keystone's the white bit in between and does it look familiar that shape if you turned it upside down it's a pyramidal shape right and that's what we understand in our uh understanding of of uh some of these buildings don't have any mortar they just put the blocks together put the keystone in they have a frame like a scaffold that holds up both arches then they put the keystone in and they pull the scaffolding away and it just stays there actually the forces actually hold it together pulling it down actually holds it together so when brother branham uses the term keystone that's no accident that's an absolute picture because christ bore the weight of all of our sin at the cross on on golgotha he is that keystone between the old and the new testament all right praise god for that ephesians chapter 2 verse 22 in whom you are also bolded together for inhabitation of god through the spirit so here we have the old testament foundation of the prophets and in the new testament first corinthians chapter 3 verse 10 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder the new testament together to be in the same position relative to the keystone according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another builds on so in other words paul's the messenger he's saying this is what it should look like he's he's leonardo da vinci with his sketches all right and he's saying this is how i think it's going to work and then the ministers that come along later they're following the pattern that paul laid down to bring us to christ amen is this making sense right all right praise god so from a human viewpoint each of us is a member of the christian church and the church really starts with the book of acts which is the acts of the holy spirit in the church so there's a building process that we understand from the book of acts but in the book of acts we finally see the disciples getting it they go okay now we know so silver and gold have our none such as i have a give it unto thee and and i just want to see jesus smiling somewhere in heaven that's my boy you got it [Music] you were listening in class how many of us don't feel like that when somebody gets something that we've taught i can just see jesus oh man did you see that gus he got it so during the ministry of jesus the disciples followed but they followed blindly they had i want i'm going to have to talk to them one day i don't want to say anything bad but they just didn't get it by the way if you ever talk about any minor prophets you know the major prophets you know daniel and jeremiah and then you've got all those minor prophets that we don't know anything about habakkuk and jose just remember if you get to heaven please don't call amos aman a prophet i think you might get an earful a theological term that's there's nothing minor about any of those prophets believe me the only reason they're called mine is because their books are a little bit thinner and also that reminds me if you haven't read habakkuk in any time just remember you are going to be asked by habakkuk did you read my book you don't want to be caught no no habakkuk were you even in the bible so we we we you know we there's a reason that we we read all those smaller smaller prophets right so the old testament um was the schoolmaster the the disciples knew the old testament but they hadn't yet come to grips with the keystone they hadn't quite seen how the ministry of jesus works but during those four gospels obviously jesus knew what he was doing and they were to become the heart of the gospel or at the heart of the bible and that's where the ministry of jesus really speaks to us is when we can position that instruction precisely taking from the old testament seeing it into the new testament as a keystone going this is how it all fits together and we have that knowledge in spades because of the message we know things that other people have never heard of i mentioned earlier that why was jesus baptized brother rap noses from old days ask any any christian anytime anywhere any minister why was jesus baptized i have never once in 45 50 years more than that 50 years ever had anybody say because of leviticus 8 because moses had to wash aaron for him to be the high priest not once even though it's so plain it's as plain as the nose on your face if you have the understanding if it's been opened to you if you know it's important to bring the old and the new testament together then it makes sense but otherwise they're flying on one wing so in this keystone we know that it's in the supreme position the whole thing doesn't work without that one stone it's the absolute position everything has to come to that position and only his life could support and bring together but there's only one keystone and that without that keystone they all fall down nice experiment for sunday school class by the way get some blocks put them together hold them up put the keystone in it and watch it sit it's going to be quite interesting all right back to kadesh barnea the christian dispensation lasted three years and six months the law lasted for several hundred years and then the christian dispensation is what bridged or keystoned the new and the old testament together do you think brother branham had this picture absolutely i believe this wasn't this is what he was saying so the old testament looks forward to jesus the new testament looks back to his ministry on earth and so we've heard this before the old testament informs the new testament the new testament fulfills the old testament so jesus said think not that i'm come to destroy the law of the prophets i'm not come to destroy but to fulfill you talk to many people that are flying on the new testament wing this is the problem all right is they think that jesus came to do away with the law and he didn't he came to fulfill the law and there's an exact scripture that says that by the way when you know you have to kind of you know cross that one out in your bible for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass not one jot or one tittle shall and no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled to the law isaiah 8 verse 20 one of my favorite verses to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them what is light light is understanding light is also christ light is also the holy spirit light is also the sun all these things point to one thing is that we need to be illuminated we need to have understanding of the law and the testimony on the one hand and then the understanding of christ on the other hand so by the way when i leave and somebody tells me that they found the service very refreshing that's not a compliment because it means they felt like a new man when they woke up so that's the so please nobody say you found it refreshing okay so matthew chapter 5 verse 17 18 20 we'll go through these quickly for i sent you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees shall in no wise enter in the kingdom of heaven hands up all of those who think they're more righteous than those pharisees oh there's one no no he was just moving his arm sorry so here's the thing those people live by the law they had to be squeaky clean every eye was on them you're a pharisee they had a huge position in the community think of a rabbi today but these people were ten times rabbis all right you know the difference between pharisees and sadducees the pharisees were far eye seas because they believed in the resurrection the sadducees were the sad you sees because they didn't believe in the resurrection so that's how you can tell the difference between the two so these scribes and pharisees were extremely righteous in the law how can we possibly exceed his right their righteousness it's because we're no longer putting on the vestment we're no longer putting on the cloak of respectability it's coming from the inside out it's coming from a changed heart it's coming from a soul that's been reborn it's coming from the inside of the inside and our nature has changed because the nature of our nature has changed so the this the nature of the flesh is the spirit the nature of the spirit is the soul so when you change the soul that works its way out into your life into the way you think and that in turn changes your behavior all right so that's how we can exceed the righteousness of the pharisees the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable what is this word honorable it's uh it means to make glorious so when the bible says that god is going to have a glorious church without spot and without blemish ultimately righteous it's because we have the righteousness of god in christ in christ it's as if we've never sinned conviction will bring you back under the umbrella of god's protection under the umbrella of his blood so when you sin you step out prick figuratively speaking from that umbrella the holy spirit convicts you you go oh sorry i repent and you back under the blood watson i don't see any sin so satan is trying to accuse us watson [Music] think what we have i'm closing one hour brother paul on the dot think of what we have in the message this ability to commune with god through the old and the new testament like they did in the figure in the ark of the testament the ark of the covenant where these two testaments agreed with each other and christ is in the midst of that so our ability to have communion with him is built on our knowledge of the old and the new testament not just the knowledge of it but the understanding of it we can make it live in our lives and we have that to give freely have we received freely give so as we close i want to remind you of this scripture brother branham said and now also i come to these i come to throw my net in with these brethren that's how i feel come to throw my net in with you brethren now you know each one of us are fishermen he didn't exclude anybody each one of us is fishermen isn't that isn't that a beautiful way to think of it we're all fishermen and believe me the bible called us to be fishermen called us to be fishes of men not keepers of the aquarium so we have a lot of in reach but we do need outreach and it's always been something that i've been very passionate about is that we need to take what we know and freely share it when you charge a battery do you charge up the battery you go and buy a battery you charge it up you put it in the closet i've got a charged up battery no you charge up the battery so that you can use it for some purpose to to illuminate somebody's life to give something out of yourself that's why you got charged up you didn't get charged up to just sit there and vibrate with holiness okay it's because you have to give that out if you don't give it out you're just going to tremble and shake all day because it's got to go somewhere oh i love that song don francisco i gotta tell somebody do you hear you remember that the way that it's it there's so much angst in it i've got to tell somebody i've got to tell somebody i've got to tell somebody what jesus did for me that should be every one of us doing that and so as i finished god bless you thank you for having me and just want to finish with this quote and just then remember the the three pulls and just then the one behind me said now i'll teach you to fish how to catch those that's still the gospel today we're still fishing for that special anointed seed of god that's out there and guess what when you start tying the old and the new testament together it's going to register something in their heart because that dna was in them from the foundation of before the foundation of the world and so when you start knitting those together they're going to go that there's something here this is something that i need this is something that resonates with me and we never know when that's going to happen so we preach as if everybody can receive it but when we receive it we know it was the anointed seed it was the gene seed of god that receives it so we receive it with predestination but we preach it as if everybody could be saved so god bless you thank you for having me and brother paul i'll just hand over to you we can just say your prayers we do some musicians you can come let's just stand to uh just to acknowledge him again heavenly father i just pray you'll take these words lord and speak to each heart according to their need as they have desires and and needs and even questions and and things that concern them lord i just pray that just on the day of pentecost you took and every man heard them in their own tongue that every person in here lord hear exactly what it is that you would have had them to hear and may that linger with them and may they meditate on your word day and night lord and may they be able to commune with you because of the the fantastic understanding that we've been given in this age to bring these two testaments together in christ so god bless each and every one lord i pray you would richly bless them bless their families lord bless their work bless every aspect of their lives i ask it all in jesus name amen amen hallelujah brother bram says teaching stabilizes teaching positions the church and um i really thoroughly enjoyed this this morning and these are one of those things that you guys can go ahead and put it on the archive or wherever else you put it and post it because this is when you have to go back and listen and let it sink in teaching us a lot of time that way but i really enjoyed it we have a modern church world that is basically written off the old testament you get into discussions about modesty and all those other things the only way they can do justify what they're doing is to write off the old testament right but when you see this and you see our prophet bring the two together and why he had to keep referring to never never dishonored never devalued never put up but grabbing that old testament as a prophet and bringing it together with what god has given us new covenant that's exactly god said why he sent his prophet and i think it was just wonderful when you have a church world that's writing it off then you see god blessing us to be able to tie it together like that and it's good for witnessing too because you're you're sharing with somebody you know i've done that in witnessing where you reach back in something that we just know that happened in a shadow in the old testament i reach back there and then i use a scripture new testament i reach back there for a shadow and i i say gee and they go wow you see jesus and that you see jesus and joseph and you explain it to him and it all comes together that's the way we have to witness that's we have to talk to him talk about it and the mind of god is just as much in those scriptures back there than in the new testament and so that's why we pray say god it's a revelation to catch your mind of what's laying back there can you say amen that's why brother uh steve and i enjoy i've been lately in my life enjoying the minor prophet so i won't be calling those guys minor because now that i grow in the lord i'm enjoying those even more because there's nuggets in there you just have to wait and pray about them brother steve has we've known him stephen is many years now and a wonderful teacher out there in des moines and we're glad to have them probably i haven't announced it yet we're glad to have them as part of our congregation can you say amen praise the lord thank you
