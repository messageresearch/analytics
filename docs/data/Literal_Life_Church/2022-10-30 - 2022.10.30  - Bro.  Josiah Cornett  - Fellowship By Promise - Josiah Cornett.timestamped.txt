[0:02] all right here enough amens to say that
[0:05] we're there
[0:07] this is Christ speaking and he's giving
[0:10] Comfort to the disciples as he's
[0:13] um beginning to let them know that he
[0:15] won't be around very much longer and you
[0:17] read the whole chapter and you find it
[0:19] it makes them a little bit nervous
[0:22] and John and John he retells
[0:26] the promises of Christ he says I will
[0:28] pray the father
[0:30] and he shall give you another comforter
[0:32] that he may abide with you forever
[0:36] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[0:37] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[0:40] neither knoweth him but you know him
[0:43] and he dwelt with you
[0:46] basically saying hey I'm him I am the
[0:49] spirit of truth I am that comforter but
[0:51] he says further shall be in you
[0:54] and I will not leave you comfortless I
[0:57] will come to you yet a little while and
[0:59] the world sees no me no more
[1:02] but ye shall see me because I live he
[1:05] shall live also and that day you shall
[1:07] know that I am in the father and ye in
[1:10] me and I in you but the comforter which
[1:13] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:15] send in my name he shall teach you all
[1:17] things and bring all things to your
[1:19] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:21] you peace I leave with you and my peace
[1:24] I give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:26] give I unto you
[1:28] let your heart not be troubled neither
[1:31] Let It Be Afraid
[1:33] and Genesis
[1:35] 4 16.
[1:41] seeing
[1:43] fourth chapter of Genesis is the telling
[1:45] of the two sons of
[1:47] Adam and Eve and the first murder
[1:52] and after Cain slays Abel well just go
[1:57] ahead and
[1:58] pick up what happens after Cain has a
[2:01] conversation with the Lord
[2:05] in verse 14.
[2:08] 4 14 behold thou has driven me out this
[2:10] day from the face the Earth and from thy
[2:12] face shall I behead and I shall be a
[2:14] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and
[2:16] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[2:18] findeth me shall slay me and the Lord
[2:19] said to him therefore whoever slayeth
[2:21] came Vengeance shall be taken Sevenfold
[2:23] and the Lord said A Marked upon Cain
[2:26] lestening finding him should kill him
[2:28] and Cain went out from the presence of
[2:31] the Lord
[2:32] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[2:34] word and may be seated
[2:38] thank you brother I sure appreciate that
[2:47] so we see here in the scripture
[2:49] we've got this
[2:51] great culmination that Christ is coming
[2:53] to
[2:54] and he
[2:55] now here at the end of end of the Old
[2:57] Testament he's beginning to wrap it up
[2:59] he's about to seal the New Testament
[3:01] with his blood and right before that
[3:04] ceiling when he's about to leave the
[3:05] Earth and and he's going to leave his
[3:07] disciples have been walking with him for
[3:09] the past three and a half years he
[3:11] begins to give them these words of
[3:12] comfort he says I'm not going to leave
[3:14] you comfortless I'm not going to abandon
[3:16] you matter of fact not only will I not
[3:19] only will I not abandon you but I'm
[3:21] going to be in you I'm going to be
[3:22] dwelling inside of you that that I'm I'm
[3:26] with you right now but I'm going to be
[3:28] in you and in that day you'll know that
[3:30] the father dwells in me and you and me
[3:32] and I and you so there's this he's
[3:35] trying to bring the disciples to this
[3:36] they can't quite understand it yet
[3:39] because the holy spirit is not yet given
[3:40] but he's trying to bring them to what
[3:42] he's trying to bring the whole church to
[3:44] he's like
[3:45] for the last two thousand four thousand
[3:47] years of History we've been trying to
[3:49] get to this singular point
[3:51] where you'll never leave me and I'll
[3:54] never leave you and will always be able
[3:56] to abide to each other with with one
[3:58] another
[3:59] he says I will pray the father
[4:01] and he shall give you another comforter
[4:03] that he may
[4:06] abide with you
[4:08] not sometimes not here and there not not
[4:11] on Sunday mornings but that he may abide
[4:13] with you forever
[4:15] what a what a comfort that ought to be
[4:18] to our hearts this morning that God
[4:20] would be abiding with us forever but to
[4:22] catch the full scope of it I just want
[4:24] to maybe take a little bit of a reprise
[4:26] this morning and and go back into church
[4:30] history and pull back where where the
[4:32] church came from before this singular
[4:34] moment in history where the Holy Ghost
[4:36] was given and you see here that Cain
[4:40] went out from the presence of the Lord
[4:42] of course that's just like his father
[4:44] and his mother they they started this
[4:46] whole thing about hiding themselves in
[4:48] the present the Lord by their sin back
[4:51] in the Garden of Eden they hid
[4:52] themselves behind some fig leaves and
[4:54] tried to hide themselves from the
[4:56] presence of the Lord and you can turn me
[4:57] down a little bit in the monitors here
[4:59] this morning but he tried to they tried
[5:01] to hide themselves from the presence of
[5:03] God and that was man's Fellowship being
[5:07] broken
[5:09] man's Fellowship being broken back in
[5:11] the Garden of Eden and then of course
[5:13] Cain comes and he breaks even further
[5:15] instead of instead of rejoicing with his
[5:18] brother Abel that Abel found a way to
[5:20] get back into God's Fellowship that he
[5:22] he found a way to get connection with
[5:24] God through his his sacrifice not of
[5:27] fruits but a sacrifice of blood a blood
[5:30] sacrifice and and it was too messy maybe
[5:32] for Cain and he thought his sacrifice
[5:34] was pretty enough and he said instead of
[5:37] saying my brother how wonderful it is
[5:40] let's let's do this together give me a
[5:42] lamb too that I may be able to have
[5:44] fellowship and a connection back with
[5:46] God that that our parents had lost
[5:47] instead of fellowshipping like that he
[5:49] took a big old stone or a blunt object
[5:51] of some sort we don't know but he killed
[5:54] his brother
[5:55] and he went out from the presence of the
[5:57] Lord and you read the the then the the
[6:00] continual history of Cain and it says
[6:02] that he married it seems like he went on
[6:04] had a fine life he builded his City he
[6:07] named his son enaki named the city Enoch
[6:10] after him and he just began to create
[6:13] his own legacy but it was Legacy
[6:15] completely outside the presence of God
[6:19] meanwhile
[6:21] Seth is born to Adam and Eve and
[6:24] he has a son named Enos and the Bible
[6:27] says that from that time then man began
[6:30] to call upon the name of the Lord
[6:32] and so you have this cane in his race
[6:34] and they're completely satisfied to
[6:37] create a dwelling outside the presence
[6:38] of God
[6:39] they completely turned their back on God
[6:42] and they're going to do all the worldly
[6:44] accomplishments and they're gonna
[6:45] they're gonna marry and given marriage
[6:47] and they're going to have family and
[6:48] they're going to create a legacy and
[6:50] they're going to do it completely
[6:51] outside of God's presence
[6:54] but I'm so happy today that I'm standing
[6:56] before some of the descendants of Seth
[6:59] I'm standing before some of the
[7:00] descendants of you know by Enos by faith
[7:03] that there was not a there was a people
[7:05] that was not happy to live outside the
[7:07] presence of God that there was a people
[7:09] that rose up and said then the the men
[7:12] of the world began to call upon the name
[7:14] of the Lord the story didn't end at Cain
[7:17] but there was a race that came after
[7:19] Seth a people a Heritage a family line
[7:22] that said I want to get back in the
[7:24] presence I don't know how to do it
[7:26] exactly I I know that we we made a big
[7:29] mistake here with with turning our back
[7:31] on God I know that I know that my family
[7:33] tree is broken right now I I know that
[7:36] my family tree is in charge right now
[7:38] but somehow despite the murder despite
[7:41] the infidelity and the adultery and
[7:43] everything else that's in my family tree
[7:44] I want to find a way to get back into
[7:47] God's presence oh I I believe that's why
[7:50] we're here this morning isn't it because
[7:51] there's a people that still wants to
[7:53] find God's presence if it still wants to
[7:55] find God's Fellowship this morning and
[7:57] you might not know all the time how to
[7:59] do it and how to get past your complexes
[8:01] and how to get past your own past let
[8:03] alone the past of your family but you're
[8:05] here this morning because you're saying
[8:07] somewhere in your heart I want to call
[8:09] upon the name of the Lord I want to get
[8:11] back in fellowship with God yes my
[8:14] family tree is rough you may be yes even
[8:16] my own history is rough but I want the
[8:18] fellowship of God
[8:20] oh Hallelujah that's the father and
[8:23] that's the mother that we have in faith
[8:25] as these these Heroes of Faith that have
[8:28] gone down the line and as we follow the
[8:30] story of our fathers and mothers of
[8:32] faith we we pick up that Abel he had
[8:35] that Revelation and then after Abel and
[8:37] after Seth we come along and Seth's
[8:40] great great great great grandson Enoch
[8:43] comes along and he says no no longer did
[8:46] they just call upon the name of the Lord
[8:48] this one found a walk with the Lord
[8:51] and I I wonder how much he must have
[8:53] looked forward to his walking with the
[8:55] Lord
[8:57] how much he must have looked forward to
[8:58] be able to have whatever level of
[9:02] Fellowship he was afforded by God at
[9:04] that time it may have not been the level
[9:06] of Fellowship that Adam and Eve had in
[9:08] the cool of the evening with Christ in
[9:11] the garden but it was some kind of
[9:13] Fellowship somewhat so that the Bible
[9:15] said he walked with the Lord and then he
[9:17] was not because God saw fit to take him
[9:21] oh hallelujah what a beautiful type of
[9:23] the day that we're living in when we
[9:26] come down we read through Genesis and
[9:29] it's a beautiful story of God's people
[9:30] as they try to find a way back into
[9:32] God's Fellowship but it's not just
[9:35] them finding God but God finding his
[9:37] people
[9:39] we look at Noah and Noah was out there
[9:42] and he God had to bring upon an
[9:45] antediluvian destruction but he said he
[9:48] found one righteous and he saved no one
[9:50] as household not that Noah was going out
[9:53] to God and saying save me but God came
[9:56] to him and said I'm going to save you
[9:58] we see the same kind of pattern later on
[10:00] as we pick up the story of Abraham he
[10:02] was just a man caught up in idolatry his
[10:06] his father was a maker of idols and a a
[10:09] Graver a sculpture of graven images
[10:13] and yet God came to him and said here I
[10:16] have a promise for you
[10:18] I have a land for you to walk in
[10:20] I I I have a plan for you
[10:23] and you can't imagine the plan and I'm
[10:26] not going to tell you everything about
[10:27] it right now but I just want you to come
[10:29] over into this land and every place that
[10:32] your footsteps I'm going to give it to
[10:34] you and you can't fathom it because
[10:36] you've never had children but don't
[10:38] don't ask all the questions about why or
[10:41] how or or the mechanics of it but I'm
[10:44] going to
[10:45] give you a Heritage I'm going to give
[10:47] you a people I'm going to give you a
[10:49] name so that you can't even number the
[10:51] the number of your people
[10:54] I wonder what that must have been like
[10:56] for Abraham I wonder if he gets kind of
[10:58] like got kind of like us and said well
[11:01] How's that gonna work
[11:04] right how
[11:06] you know kind of like we do how am I
[11:07] going to get past these complexes
[11:11] maybe you can read a book about it
[11:15] maybe I could go to the public library
[11:17] and check out a self-help book and how
[11:21] am I going to get past this cycle of sin
[11:23] that I'm in I
[11:24] I just I've never been and my father did
[11:27] the same thing before me and I I mean he
[11:31] probably figured I've always been an
[11:32] idol worshiper how could there how can I
[11:34] worship just one God
[11:37] I thought my wife and I we've always
[11:40] been bare and how could we possibly
[11:44] and we find out that that's exactly what
[11:46] he did he he tried to put himself in the
[11:49] picture and try to work the mechanics
[11:51] himself and sometimes I think that's
[11:53] where we get off track
[11:56] is like Abraham he tried to inject
[11:59] himself in there and rather his his wife
[12:02] tried to do it and she said here take
[12:04] this woman over here and then that'll
[12:06] fulfill God's promises and then she of
[12:08] course hated Hagar afterwards and the
[12:10] whole mess that came from that and
[12:11] entire people that that wasn't part of
[12:13] the promise and and they battled the
[12:15] children of Israel all those times and
[12:17] all the mess that we come up with trying
[12:19] to help god with his plans in our life
[12:23] all the mess that we here here God let
[12:25] me help overcome my complexes with you
[12:29] uh hell let me help let me help you know
[12:32] try to break this cycle of sin in my
[12:34] life and we should be proactive but in a
[12:37] way that's yielding
[12:38] Lord you show me the steps you show me
[12:40] what needs to be done here
[12:45] so we see that
[12:47] God had a dedication to people he he he
[12:50] wanted to bring man back into fellowship
[12:53] with him even though a man was really
[12:55] good at breaking off fellowship with God
[12:56] God was really good at bringing man back
[12:59] into Fellowship
[13:00] and you even look at Abraham's life and
[13:03] it didn't seem like Abraham had that
[13:05] many instances where he had a fellowship
[13:07] with the Lord
[13:08] matter of fact I think he'd be jealous
[13:10] of most of us here this morning because
[13:12] you pick up Abraham's story
[13:15] and it seems like for years he'd go
[13:17] without a clear direction from God
[13:20] he's like
[13:22] you know I I you gave me this promise of
[13:25] a son and I didn't know what to do with
[13:28] it and years went by and I didn't hear
[13:31] from you so we just kind of did this
[13:32] over here
[13:33] how wonderful would it have been for him
[13:35] to be able to come to church this
[13:37] morning
[13:38] and to be able to come in underneath the
[13:41] tutelage of God's word he you got to
[13:43] remember Abraham didn't even have the
[13:45] tank Commandments at the time it was
[13:47] just living by the conscience that God
[13:49] placed into his heart and by whatever
[13:51] instruction God gave to him
[13:55] but yet God was calling man into
[13:57] fellowship and so we see that God begins
[14:00] to release more of himself in the world
[14:02] he through Abraham he he creates a a
[14:05] chosen people and to those chosen people
[14:08] he begins to reveal himself through the
[14:11] Ten Commandments and and showing people
[14:13] a picture of of what God wants
[14:16] my wife was asking just yesterday how is
[14:19] it that the law is a tutor and we got
[14:23] into a conversation about how the law is
[14:25] a tutor for people
[14:26] and even today the law that God gave to
[14:30] the children of Israel is a tutor for
[14:32] people it's a school Master to bring
[14:34] them up to
[14:36] repentance up to the baptism of the Holy
[14:39] Ghost up to a relationship with Jesus
[14:41] Christ
[14:42] can you imagine what would have happened
[14:43] if God had never given a distribution of
[14:46] himself through his Chosen People Israel
[14:49] if he had never revealed the Ten
[14:51] Commandments if he had never revealed
[14:53] what he wanted from man
[14:56] it's like it's like if if I come into
[14:58] relationship with you for the first time
[15:00] the first questions I'm going to ask is
[15:02] what's your favorite color
[15:05] what kind of food you like to eat
[15:08] now we're not in full relationship with
[15:11] each other but I have to know a little
[15:13] bit about you before I can
[15:15] have fellowship with you
[15:17] I have to know what your preferences are
[15:19] I have to know what you want
[15:21] that's why this whole world is treating
[15:23] just any kind of Jesus they want it's a
[15:24] completely different kind of Jesus
[15:27] if you respect the personhood of God
[15:29] you're going to try to find out what God
[15:32] wants
[15:33] and you know I'll I'll tell you the
[15:35] first time I found out that my wife
[15:36] liked the color Navy
[15:38] you know what I didn't do I didn't tell
[15:40] her that's the stupidest color I ever
[15:42] saw in my life
[15:45] I didn't you know I that's one thing I
[15:47] didn't do I also didn't say why do you
[15:49] like the color Navy with big scrunch on
[15:52] my face
[15:54] could you tell me the mechanics let's
[15:56] let's go back in your birth history and
[15:59] and your psychosis and what about Navy
[16:01] originally appealed to you and could you
[16:04] just give me all the reasons why you
[16:06] like the colored Navy
[16:08] could you God could you just give me all
[16:10] the reasons why you want a man to wear
[16:13] pants and a woman to wear skirts because
[16:16] that that doesn't really make a lot of
[16:18] sense to me
[16:22] oh my
[16:24] could you just give me all the reasons
[16:26] why you don't want me to cuss and I mean
[16:28] it's just four letter words anyhow
[16:31] could you just give me all the reasons
[16:33] why
[16:34] I can't steal from the rich when they
[16:36] have plenty of money anyhow
[16:40] God could you just you know I think I
[16:42] think I think maybe
[16:44] you're a little bent out of shape here
[16:46] God
[16:48] that's that's not how I treated my wife
[16:50] when I first met her that's not even how
[16:52] I treat my friends let alone The
[16:54] Sovereign ruler of the universe
[16:58] and yet we'll throw questions at God all
[17:00] day long before we even really get to
[17:02] know him
[17:06] so when we read The Ten Commandments
[17:09] it's become so natural to us well of
[17:12] course we shouldn't steal of course we
[17:13] shouldn't lie I'm sure of course we
[17:14] shouldn't commit adultery but it wasn't
[17:17] natural to the people back then
[17:19] well under what conditions I think
[17:21] there's certain conditions under which I
[17:23] can steal these people over here they're
[17:25] they're a totally different family a
[17:26] whole totally different tribe I should
[17:28] steal from them anytime I want to
[17:31] or what about not committed adultery
[17:33] what was adultery back then they had so
[17:34] many wives anyhow
[17:39] not only that but their their Pagan
[17:41] practices it allowed that kind of
[17:43] activity around their worship and
[17:45] Incorporated that into it can you
[17:46] imagine how crazy that was to them
[17:49] but yet it was God's grace
[17:52] saying let me let me show you what my
[17:54] favorite colors are
[17:56] yeah let me show you what I like to eat
[17:58] when I sit down and dine with my people
[18:01] let me show you how to make me happy
[18:04] oh and while I'm at it because this
[18:06] isn't just about me but because I also
[18:08] created you let me show you how you work
[18:11] let me show you how to live
[18:14] let me let me come down and recalibrate
[18:16] your broken hearts
[18:18] instead of just trying to try to figure
[18:21] it all out and ask me why
[18:23] how about you just get to know your
[18:25] author a little bit how about you just
[18:27] accept the grace of my Revelation that
[18:30] I'm getting giving to you
[18:32] the Bible says that Israel became a
[18:35] light to all the world
[18:37] why because Israel was God's Avenue for
[18:41] God revealing himself they were the
[18:43] people through which God called all the
[18:46] Earth come and look at me there's a
[18:48] people that I'm revealing myself to if
[18:50] you want to see the one true God if you
[18:52] want to see your maker come to the
[18:54] people of Israel that's why unlike most
[18:57] other tribes the time God made a way for
[18:59] the Foreigner to come into the
[19:01] encampment of Israel it wasn't just
[19:03] Rahab was a special case there were
[19:05] special laws and Provisions for the
[19:07] Foreigner to be able to come into the
[19:09] camp because God wasn't just revealing
[19:11] himself to God to this special people
[19:13] but this was a special people that was
[19:16] made as an Avenue to reveal the whole
[19:18] world
[19:20] so much so that you can go into the
[19:22] darkest place of Toledo or Los Angeles
[19:25] or New York and and those little kids
[19:28] that may have never been Church before
[19:30] and may have been raised up underneath
[19:32] the drug addict they know in their heart
[19:34] of hearts that it's wrong to steal that
[19:36] it's wrong to commit adultery because
[19:39] why at least the very little at least
[19:41] they'll say that it's illegal
[19:43] but why do you have that it's because of
[19:45] Western laws why do you have Western
[19:47] laws it's because of the influence all
[19:49] the way back through the children of
[19:52] Israel by God's sovereignly revealing by
[19:54] his grace what his preferences were what
[19:57] he desired from his people and how his
[19:59] people perfectly operated
[20:01] that was God calling man back into
[20:05] Fellowship by showing them who he was
[20:08] now that's not the end of it because I
[20:10] didn't get married or even try popping
[20:12] out a ring as soon as I found out what
[20:14] her favorite color was
[20:17] might have liked to but I waited off a
[20:20] little bit longer brother Mike you know
[20:23] at least a few weeks
[20:28] so there's this whole process that God's
[20:30] bringing us through
[20:32] then we follow down God's family tree
[20:36] and the people of Israel we pick up
[20:38] David and it says here here David was a
[20:41] a man after God's Own Heart
[20:43] a man that was so confidence in God's
[20:45] presence that he said where shall I go
[20:48] that I would Escape your presence I
[20:49] could go into the depths of hell and
[20:51] still you would find me I could go I
[20:53] could take wings as the morning and go
[20:55] into in the heavens and still you would
[20:56] be there
[20:58] and yet in the same in just a couple of
[21:00] chapters over he'd he'd say oh God cast
[21:03] not thy Holy Spirit from me
[21:08] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[21:12] see he he still didn't have what God
[21:14] wanted to bring him to he didn't have
[21:17] that abiding presence of God
[21:19] he actually still feared that he could
[21:21] lose the Holy Spirit
[21:23] because why the Holy Ghost was only
[21:25] given as an anointing upon the spirit at
[21:27] that time but it was not given as a
[21:30] personhood to the soul of man to change
[21:32] his nature and seal him unto the end
[21:35] God was still bringing man to that
[21:39] oh my they were still underneath the
[21:41] blood of bulls and goats at that time
[21:43] have you ever thought of how complicated
[21:45] that must have been to live underneath
[21:47] the blood of bulls and goats
[21:50] and how maybe jealous people that wanted
[21:52] to be in the presence of God
[21:54] might have been of that high priest that
[21:56] got to go one time in the holy of holies
[21:59] David said oh I would that I could live
[22:01] all the days of my life in the house the
[22:04] Lord
[22:05] I wonder a man who felt that way if he
[22:07] sometimes felt about the high priest I
[22:09] wish I could be that guy
[22:11] you know we see even examples of Kings
[22:14] uh I can't remember the the name of the
[22:16] king just now but he was he was he was
[22:18] struck with Leprosy because he wanted
[22:20] the office of the priesthood
[22:23] and now I'm standing before people who
[22:26] God has made Kings and Priests
[22:29] has cast out the leprosy of Sin from
[22:32] amongst us
[22:33] imagine how privileged we are friends
[22:37] the scripture says it this way that
[22:38] every priest standeth daily and offering
[22:40] oftentimes the same sacrifices but those
[22:43] sacrifices could never take away the
[22:45] sins but this man Christ Jesus after he
[22:49] had offered one sacrifice for sins
[22:51] forever sat down at the right hand of
[22:54] God
[22:54] Christ the Lamb of God came and spread
[22:57] his arms for you and me
[23:00] one time
[23:01] oh can you imagine the power of that
[23:04] sacrifice
[23:05] where thousands and millions of the
[23:08] blood of bulls and goats had stacked up
[23:10] over the years and and all Christ has to
[23:13] do one time is Lay the price down on the
[23:16] on the table and say it's paid it's paid
[23:19] from every man woman and child since the
[23:22] birth of Adam and Eve onward Until the
[23:24] End of the Age every baby that's ever
[23:26] born and never comes to the age of of
[23:28] accountability that baby is mine
[23:32] Ever every man and a woman that would
[23:34] come past the AIDS of accountability and
[23:36] become aware of their sins as long as
[23:38] they repent and claim the name of Jesus
[23:40] Christ they will be saved
[23:43] if they just call upon my name
[23:45] oh Hallelujah
[23:47] now he begins to set up
[23:51] the way of Perpetual fellowship with God
[23:54] not just
[23:55] coming in and offering
[23:58] sacrifice for sins
[24:02] but to have a perpetual and abiding
[24:04] presence
[24:06] of Christ their lives
[24:10] I wonder if
[24:12] if you were back in the time of the
[24:15] Israelites
[24:16] how many times would it be enough for
[24:18] you
[24:18] to come into God's presence
[24:23] imagine for the high priest is one time
[24:25] per year
[24:27] I my family and I just left for 30 days
[24:30] and
[24:31] it was so marvelous being able to come
[24:33] back into
[24:34] this church service this morning
[24:40] but would you be satisfied
[24:42] one time per week
[24:44] would that be enough for you to come
[24:46] into God's presence
[24:50] I want to let that question linger this
[24:52] morning
[24:54] how often do you want to be in God's
[24:56] presence
[25:03] you know sometimes we we feel like we
[25:05] have to
[25:06] work
[25:08] for our Redemption
[25:10] that every time we sin we seem to have
[25:13] to work back
[25:15] make enough propitiation for our sins
[25:18] make enough penance
[25:21] to be able to
[25:23] feel like we're accepted of God
[25:29] but Redemption was a one-time event at
[25:32] Calvary
[25:35] he paid for your PR your sins one time
[25:40] and all you have to do is accept it one
[25:44] time
[25:45] and that closes the case
[25:50] the Bible says that he who the son has
[25:52] freed is free indeed
[25:56] all you have to do is take that blood
[25:57] and apply it over your life one time by
[26:00] the simple hyssop of faith
[26:04] and say God has forgiven me it's a clean
[26:07] slate
[26:11] then of course we we do have sins and we
[26:14] make mistakes and
[26:16] things that distance ourselves from the
[26:18] fellowship of God
[26:20] but John says it this way so beautifully
[26:22] he says if we confess our sins he is
[26:25] faithful and just forgive us our sins
[26:26] and to cleanse us from all
[26:28] unrighteousness
[26:30] I the last time we were together
[26:32] I'm still just setting up a foundation
[26:34] for what I want to get to
[26:36] you that were here last time we were
[26:39] fellowshipping about on the fellowship
[26:41] by Grace may have recognized me to
[26:43] repeating myself a lot but just wait for
[26:46] me to get to it if you would this
[26:47] morning
[26:48] but we commented on this scripture that
[26:51] it's amazing that God would bring into
[26:54] this that he's not only faithful to
[26:56] forgive us our sins
[26:58] because that would be faithful to a
[27:00] promise but he also ties his Justice to
[27:02] it
[27:05] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[27:07] and just to forgive us our sins
[27:11] now we think of God's justices if he was
[27:14] just he would completely eradicate me
[27:18] from the face of the Earth like when
[27:20] when man becomes so aware of his sins
[27:24] that's what God he's aware that God's
[27:27] justice requires death
[27:30] but the moment that you accept the blood
[27:32] of Jesus Christ you pass over
[27:35] from God's justice requiring death
[27:39] and you pass over his prom the threshold
[27:42] of his promises that say whoever calls
[27:45] upon me shall be saved
[27:48] and once you have that threshold of
[27:50] Promise underneath your feet
[27:52] now he says it's my Justice to give you
[27:55] life
[27:56] because I promised it
[27:58] I paid the price for it already and
[28:01] because I paid the price for it and
[28:03] because I brought myself under
[28:04] obligations to you by my promise
[28:07] it is now my Justice
[28:10] to forgive you of your sin
[28:13] so this morning if you brought a load of
[28:16] sin
[28:18] you can lay it down this morning
[28:22] and you don't have to work for it
[28:25] you don't have to come and pound this
[28:27] altar this morning
[28:28] it doesn't matter what you've done it
[28:31] might be it might be so embarrassing and
[28:33] so black that you would never want to
[28:35] even breathe it in a Congregation of
[28:37] these Saints
[28:40] but if you breathe it before the
[28:41] presence of God and simply say Lord I
[28:44] Repent of that
[28:45] from a true and honest heart he says
[28:49] it's now his Justice
[28:51] to forgive you of it
[28:54] do you know what Justice Means it
[28:57] doesn't mean that God is just doing you
[28:59] a favor now
[29:00] it means
[29:02] even if
[29:04] someone came up and brought up all the
[29:06] dirt against you
[29:09] let's say
[29:10] I'm seeing this political season it
[29:12] seems like people are really good at
[29:14] bringing up dirt about their opponents
[29:15] and they they dig way back into coffers
[29:19] and the skeleton is in the family
[29:20] Clauses they bring up all this dirt and
[29:23] they try to get people to to judge them
[29:26] at the ballot
[29:27] well isn't that just like the devil
[29:30] he brings up all this dirt on you he
[29:33] says you did this and you did that and
[29:35] look at what you did just this last week
[29:38] and look at the habits in your life even
[29:40] if you repented of that you've done it
[29:42] so many times you're just going to do it
[29:44] again
[29:44] you can't repent them of a cycle of
[29:47] habits in your life you'll never break
[29:48] that he says
[29:52] but yet God says
[29:55] if you confess your sins I am faithful
[29:57] and just to forgive it and to cleanse
[30:00] you from all unrighteousness
[30:03] and it's popped over in the sea of
[30:05] forgetfulness
[30:06] where if you do it again God's still
[30:08] going to forgive you he's still going to
[30:10] forgive you he's going to forgive you 70
[30:12] times 70. how could he be just and not
[30:14] forgive you 70 times 7.
[30:17] think about that because he told us to
[30:19] forgive seven times seven how much the
[30:21] more then should the infinite supreme
[30:23] ruler of the universe forgive 70 times
[30:26] 7.
[30:27] that's 490 have you gone through 490
[30:30] cycles of sin
[30:31] maybe you have I think God's well able
[30:35] to go even beyond that
[30:38] and if Satan brought the case before
[30:40] God's judgment seat this morning it
[30:43] wouldn't even make the bar because God
[30:45] would just simply throw that out of
[30:47] court because his Justice he's already
[30:49] paid the price and he's not going to
[30:51] hear an invalid case
[30:56] so now we come down to really getting
[30:59] into fellowship with God
[31:00] for past four thousand years of church
[31:03] history and how God's injected himself
[31:06] by his grace into the human race through
[31:08] revelation
[31:09] and now it's beyond Revelation to the to
[31:12] the people of Israel but it's God
[31:13] injecting himself into his people
[31:15] through the blood and the life that's in
[31:18] that blood because the life of an animal
[31:20] can never come back upon man but when
[31:23] God gave his sacrifice there was a life
[31:25] in it
[31:26] otherwise what was the what was the big
[31:28] deal about the the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:30] if it was just blood
[31:33] but the difference of it was is that the
[31:35] life that was in that blood could come
[31:37] back upon man whereas the life of an
[31:39] animal cannot do anything for us the
[31:42] life that was in that blood the Holy
[31:44] Ghost the life of Jesus Christ could
[31:46] come back upon man and bring him into
[31:48] Fellowship into Oneness into Unity with
[31:51] God through a divine nature change
[31:55] so now we have open access to fellowship
[31:57] with God
[31:58] the Bible says you were called Under The
[32:00] Fellowship of Jesus Christ Our Lord
[32:04] you were called not you weren't
[32:06] searching after not you tried to find
[32:08] God
[32:09] but God called you
[32:12] do you know what that makes you this
[32:13] morning
[32:14] not only are you called but you've been
[32:16] invited
[32:18] by God
[32:20] I can't imagine a better invitation and
[32:22] if he invited me that means he he
[32:25] thought about me
[32:27] he thought about me from the foundation
[32:29] of the world I'm told in this Bible
[32:32] he knew my name
[32:34] the prophet says that he knew me in the
[32:38] inward parts of my mother before I was
[32:39] even birthed forth God knew my name
[32:43] that he predestinated me the Bible says
[32:45] it this way according as he hath chosen
[32:48] Us in him before the foundation the
[32:50] world you're chosen this morning
[32:53] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[32:55] before him in love having predestinated
[32:58] us into the adoption of children by
[32:59] Jesus Christ to the praise the glory of
[33:02] his grace wherein he hath made us
[33:04] accepted in the Beloved
[33:08] you're accepted this morning
[33:10] can I just take a moment to just push
[33:12] back a few lies the enemy in your hearts
[33:14] this morning
[33:15] you're maybe when you I don't know what
[33:18] your lives are like outside this very
[33:20] very few do I have that kind of chance
[33:22] to connect with you so intimately that I
[33:25] would know your complexes and what you
[33:27] deal with and and the trials that you
[33:29] have in this past week
[33:31] but whatever you're going out to
[33:33] whatever the world calls you oddball
[33:36] two-faced maybe they they have all sorts
[33:40] of names for you maybe they
[33:42] maybe they think you're awful weird
[33:44] you know the Bible also says that we're
[33:46] A peculiar people so I'll go ahead and
[33:49] take that label of being weird this
[33:50] morning
[33:51] I'll go ahead and take that label of
[33:53] being an oddball this morning I'm A
[33:55] peculiar people
[33:56] but you're chosen my God
[33:59] you're accepted of him this morning
[34:02] maybe there's sometimes new life where
[34:05] you don't even feel accepted by your
[34:06] friend group you don't feel accepted on
[34:09] social media nobody liked on your cool
[34:10] comments this week and you thought they
[34:12] were so funny on Facebook and nobody
[34:14] liked them you feel so unaccepted but
[34:17] you know what who's you know who's gonna
[34:19] like you every single time
[34:21] all you have to do is breathe the name
[34:23] of Jesus Christ this morning and you've
[34:26] got the supreme ruler of the universe
[34:28] the creator of your soul pressing your
[34:30] like button and saying yes you know what
[34:33] I didn't just like you this one time
[34:34] based on what you said but if you follow
[34:37] your your your history with me not your
[34:40] Facebook history but your history with
[34:42] me I liked you back in Genesis I like
[34:45] you back before Genesis I liked you
[34:47] before the foundation of the world I
[34:49] didn't just like you I put my heart
[34:51] right there that was my heart button and
[34:54] my heart button stayed with you
[34:55] throughout all the course of time no
[34:57] matter what you've done
[34:59] oh Hallelujah you're chosen my God
[35:01] you're accepted this morning
[35:04] you're accepted amongst the Beloved
[35:09] not only are you accepted amongst the
[35:10] Beloved but you are his beloved the
[35:13] Bible says even us whom Heath called not
[35:16] the Jews only but also the Gentiles
[35:19] as he said in Hosea I will call them my
[35:23] people which were not my people and her
[35:25] beloved which was not beloved
[35:28] you're God's beloved this morning your
[35:31] God's spouse his bride
[35:34] I don't think we always let that sink in
[35:36] for us as an individual it's easy to see
[35:38] to come to church and say oh yeah we're
[35:40] the we're the Bride of God
[35:42] but how about I'm the Bride of God
[35:46] I have the attention of God when I get
[35:50] on my knees
[35:51] God hears my prayer
[35:53] if God heard the prayer of David how
[35:55] much more would he hear the prayer of
[35:58] someone who's come underneath Fellowship
[36:00] by his blood
[36:02] if he could hear the prayer of the
[36:03] prophets that were underneath the
[36:05] fellowship
[36:06] of a blood of a lamb's blood Covenant
[36:09] how much more would he hear your prayer
[36:11] this morning Under The Fellowship of the
[36:13] Lamb
[36:15] oh Hallelujah
[36:22] not only are you beloved and chosen
[36:24] accepted
[36:25] but this morning
[36:27] you are complete in God
[36:30] it says in him dwelt the fullness that
[36:32] God had bodily and you are complete in
[36:34] him which is the head of all
[36:36] principality and Power
[36:39] you might not feel complete this morning
[36:41] you might feel like a work in progress
[36:43] how many times have we said well
[36:47] at least I can say this
[36:49] I'm not what I want to be but thank God
[36:52] I'm not what I used to be
[36:55] but I I remember what God sees
[36:58] God sees the end from the beginning he's
[37:02] outside of time when he looks at you
[37:04] underneath the blood Covenant of Jesus
[37:06] Christ he doesn't even see your current
[37:09] mistakes
[37:11] he sees you as he took that family
[37:14] picture before the foundation the world
[37:16] he sees you complete in him this morning
[37:19] have that confidence when you approach
[37:21] the Lord
[37:22] knowing that you're a new creation in
[37:24] God knowing that you're God's friend
[37:29] he said that you're my friends if you do
[37:31] whatsoever I have commanded you
[37:34] no I I used to be I've said it before
[37:36] but I used to be real jealous of Abraham
[37:38] because the Hebrews in the faith chapter
[37:40] said that Abraham was a friend of God
[37:42] I'm like man that'd be pretty neat to be
[37:44] a god
[37:45] I'd love to be God's friend
[37:48] and then come to find out
[37:51] Jesus said to us
[37:53] you are my friends I call you no longer
[37:56] servants
[37:57] no longer just the ones that do my
[37:58] bidding but I call you my friends
[38:01] if you do whatsoever I commanded you
[38:04] have you done his Commandments friends
[38:06] have you made yourself have you repented
[38:09] in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:11] have you been baptized in the name of
[38:13] Jesus Christ
[38:14] have you done all that was asked of you
[38:16] by this word then you're his friends
[38:19] this morning
[38:20] the fairy friend of God
[38:23] I have so many things that I got written
[38:25] down here but I think it would take all
[38:27] the time that we have this morning just
[38:28] to go over what God has called you
[38:32] though even the psalmist said that you
[38:34] know how wonderful are thy thoughts
[38:36] towards me O Lord and thy thoughts
[38:39] towards me are past numbering
[38:42] you want to know what God thinks about
[38:43] you just start reading in your Bible
[38:45] again
[38:47] I did say again because some of us
[38:51] going through little Cycles I'll just
[38:53] I'll just give the I'll just be honest
[38:55] here this morning where this busy life
[38:57] and all the things that distract us pull
[39:00] us away that we kind of get away from
[39:02] the Bible
[39:03] and get away from reading it like we
[39:05] should and refreshing our memories on
[39:07] what God told us you might say well I've
[39:09] read the Bible before you cover to cover
[39:11] sure but do you remember it
[39:15] do you remember what God's
[39:17] thoughts towards you are
[39:19] because I think a lot of these complexes
[39:21] that we deal with would get washed away
[39:25] if we just
[39:27] have a little bit more memory of what
[39:29] God's already said about us
[39:32] that you are his chosen people that you
[39:34] are accepted that you are complete in
[39:36] him that you are his beloved that you
[39:38] are his this morning that you are sealed
[39:40] in the day of your Redemption that you
[39:43] that no man not even the Devil Himself
[39:45] not even you yourself can pluck you from
[39:47] his hand
[39:49] these are the things that God says about
[39:51] you that you're his friend that it's not
[39:53] like Enoch how many times have we been
[39:55] jealous of Enoch that walked with God
[39:57] but he's called you into deeper
[39:58] fellowship and even Enoch had
[40:01] remember the types and shadows of the
[40:03] Old Testament are just types and shadows
[40:06] what is greater this morning my shadow
[40:08] here on the uh on on the platform
[40:12] or myself
[40:15] Enoch was only my shadow
[40:20] Enoch was only the shadow of the seventh
[40:22] Church age that would be called up into
[40:24] a Rapture with God
[40:27] the walk that we have is that much
[40:29] greater we're far past the Revelation
[40:31] The Ten Commandments we've got the
[40:33] revelation of the seven churches we've
[40:35] got the Revelation the of the Seven
[40:36] Seals we know the threefold purpose of
[40:38] God of Jesus Christ
[40:40] from the very beginning
[40:43] we're walking with God
[40:45] don't take it lightly
[40:48] and yet despite all this and this is
[40:51] where I'm trying to get to what I've
[40:52] wanted to achieve this sermon
[40:55] this is where we take the corner
[40:58] despite all this I find
[41:01] that as we go back to our scripture
[41:03] reading
[41:04] we had two scriptures one I will pray
[41:07] the father and he shall give you another
[41:08] comforter that he may abide with you
[41:10] forever
[41:11] and the other was and Cain went out of
[41:13] the presence of the Lord
[41:15] and so many times despite all that God's
[41:17] achieved through through six thousand
[41:19] years of human history now
[41:21] we want to go back
[41:23] we want to go back from John and go all
[41:25] the way back to Genesis and identify
[41:28] ourselves with Cain
[41:30] and say
[41:31] and Cain went out of the presence of the
[41:33] Lord
[41:34] there's me
[41:36] and we'll come to church and we'll see
[41:39] everybody singing and worshiping around
[41:41] us
[41:42] and we'll hear them
[41:45] singing The Words the goodness the Lord
[41:47] is running after me and we'll mouth it
[41:50] along with them but there's a little
[41:52] part in the heart that says I wish God's
[41:55] goodness was running after me
[41:59] or we'll sing songs about the presence
[42:02] of God
[42:04] and we'll just say I wish I was in God's
[42:11] instead here I am
[42:13] for months now
[42:15] here with Cain
[42:16] I've gone out from the presence of the
[42:18] Lord you might feel
[42:21] and yes just like canine
[42:23] I've got my family I've got my children
[42:25] I'm building my kingdom like Cain built
[42:28] this city but it's all outside of God
[42:35] and I just want to attack a few lies the
[42:38] enemy this morning if I could
[42:40] because that's really nothing but a lie
[42:44] that
[42:45] God's presence isn't with you this
[42:47] morning
[42:51] the God's presence isn't with you
[42:53] tomorrow
[42:55] that God's presence will ever leave you
[42:59] because here in John he said I will send
[43:02] the comforter and he will be with you he
[43:05] will abide in you and he will not leave
[43:08] you he will be with you forever
[43:12] that you cannot Escape let me put it
[43:14] this way the holy ghost-filled Child of
[43:18] God the holy ghost-filled daughter or
[43:21] son of God cannot Escape God's presence
[43:24] not like David said where one in one
[43:27] chapter he was saying I I can't escape
[43:29] God's presence but in another chapter he
[43:31] said it casts not thy Holy Spirit from
[43:34] me we're Beyond an Old Testament
[43:36] experience with the Holy Ghost because
[43:39] this Holy Ghost is no longer on the
[43:41] spirit like it was with David this Holy
[43:44] Ghost has now been made a way there's
[43:46] been made an Avenue by the blood of
[43:48] Jesus Christ that the Holy Ghost could
[43:50] drop down into a man's Soul feel the
[43:53] doors shut behind him and say nobody's
[43:56] coming in this Soul until the end of
[43:58] time it don't matter how hard Sodom
[44:01] knocks at the door it doesn't matter how
[44:03] hard Facebook and the internet and
[44:05] pornography and entertainment and your
[44:08] own sins and your own mistakes and the
[44:10] old Temptations knock at your door no
[44:13] one's coming this Soul because I've
[44:15] found an Avenue I've found a way and
[44:17] I've paid the price of the propitiation
[44:19] of all sins for the beasts in
[44:22] the world and I am the Lamb of God God I
[44:25] spread my arms across a tree one day two
[44:28] thousand years ago and I paid the price
[44:32] the price and I paid it for my children
[44:33] and I'll not suffer anyone to knock at
[44:36] the door of their heart once they've
[44:38] invited me in once I've sealed that door
[44:40] shut behind me I'm not leaving this
[44:43] throne room
[44:44] oh Hallelujah now that might sound
[44:46] pretty good on paper but yet there's
[44:49] something that still answers Into the
[44:50] Heart of Believers that I find they
[44:53] still will relate back to Cain and say
[44:55] yes I know that in my head because it's
[44:57] written there in the scriptures and
[44:59] black and white white and even red but I
[45:03] still identify with Cain
[45:05] I still don't feel that I'm in God's
[45:08] presence
[45:09] there's something separating me
[45:13] and I just want to come against that lie
[45:15] a little bit this morning
[45:16] I want to tear down a few strongholds
[45:20] this morning
[45:22] oh Hallelujah
[45:26] you cannot get away from God's presence
[45:28] but here's Satan's trick
[45:30] is he'll believe he'll twist our
[45:33] understanding to make us believe that we
[45:35] can
[45:42] he'll twist your understanding
[45:44] even about
[45:46] what God's presence is
[45:49] and he'll maybe water down words you
[45:52] know we we see this trick throughout
[45:54] time that Satan will change words so
[45:57] their meaning is lost to us
[46:00] he'll even change the the meaning of the
[46:02] word male and female
[46:03] so that over time as the generations go
[46:06] down
[46:07] it may not happen in our generation but
[46:09] if time continues as generation goes
[46:12] down it'll be so overlapped until
[46:15] without
[46:16] without correct understanding
[46:19] will have just as much confusion about
[46:21] it as we do about what a woman's garment
[46:23] is and what a man's haircut looks like
[46:27] because he changes the meaning of things
[46:30] he'll take things like even the word
[46:32] omnipresence and he'll water down God's
[46:36] omnipresence
[46:38] did you know that brother Branham said
[46:39] that God is Not omnipresent
[46:42] not in the way that we would think it
[46:44] would be I'm trading trading on some
[46:46] dangerous ground this morning so I'm
[46:47] going to read the quote directly
[46:50] he said God is a being not just like a
[46:52] myth not like the wind over the Earth
[46:55] but God's not just like the air
[46:58] if he would you would have never had to
[47:01] seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you
[47:04] because he'd be filling everything
[47:07] makes good sense don't it
[47:09] I love it when things make good sense
[47:13] gives me a good answer to the devil
[47:15] don't it
[47:16] says
[47:17] God's omnipresent sure
[47:20] by being omniscient and knowing all
[47:23] things but God has a Dwelling Place
[47:28] because why because he's a being
[47:31] if you want to know where God's dwelling
[47:34] place is
[47:35] if you want to know where his presence
[47:37] is you've got to find out where his
[47:40] dwelling place is
[47:42] now you're on the Journey of job where
[47:44] he said oh if I could just go up and
[47:45] knock on God's door
[47:48] but I believe that many have already
[47:50] completed the journey you're just not
[47:53] maybe recognizing it this morning
[47:56] God has a dwelling place and God dwells
[47:59] with Fellowship under the shed blood of
[48:02] the son and that's
[48:05] that alone
[48:08] David said oh if I could just dwell in
[48:11] the presence of the Lord if I could just
[48:13] dwell in the Tabernacle and the house
[48:15] the Lord all the days of my life
[48:18] yet he didn't realize that that wasn't
[48:20] God's objective
[48:22] God's objective was not for you to come
[48:24] here this morning and to stay here and
[48:26] isolate yourself in the world
[48:28] so you could stay here all the days of
[48:30] your life this was never to be God's
[48:33] Tabernacle
[48:35] how amazing would David have felt if he
[48:38] had known that God's objective was oh if
[48:42] I could just dwell in David all days of
[48:45] his life
[48:46] that God wasn't looking for man to come
[48:49] to his dwelling place but God said
[48:52] sacrifices and offerings I would as not
[48:54] but a body thou Hast prepared for me I'm
[48:58] looking to dwell in a body
[49:00] that's where God's dwelling place is
[49:03] so if you want to get around God
[49:06] you're going to be stuck with me
[49:12] I'll tell you what if you don't have the
[49:14] Holy Ghost yet this morning and you want
[49:15] to get around God
[49:18] just find the Holy Ghost filled believer
[49:21] that's where he dwells
[49:23] I'll tell you what
[49:24] if you want to be sure that God's with
[49:27] you all the days of your life just get
[49:29] the Holy Ghost
[49:30] you don't have to keep on finding God
[49:32] and losing God and being caught out
[49:34] there on the outside and the outer
[49:36] courts like David was saying oh cast not
[49:39] by Holy Spirit from me one day I feel
[49:40] your anointing and one day I don't
[49:43] it was all on the spirit level
[49:45] but there's a whole nother level where
[49:47] God wants to step into your soul and
[49:49] fulfill his promise to you that I'll
[49:51] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[49:54] I'll be with you even in you forever
[50:00] holidays ever been out in the woods or
[50:03] maybe in a strange place and
[50:06] maybe you were with your partner or your
[50:08] family and you got lost
[50:11] found yourself all alone
[50:14] how'd that feel
[50:16] maybe as a child you could remember it
[50:18] or some of us even as adults we still
[50:20] get scared of being alone
[50:23] what about a promise that you would
[50:24] never be alone
[50:27] and what would it be
[50:29] if that promise has already been
[50:31] fulfilled to you that you are never
[50:33] alone
[50:34] not by because God's omniscient and so
[50:37] he's kind of with you everywhere just
[50:39] like he's with the other guy down the
[50:40] street everywhere because he feels all
[50:42] time in space see that's the watered
[50:44] down way
[50:46] God's not with you like he's with the
[50:48] sinner across the street
[50:52] he wants to be in you
[50:55] he wants to come to you and abide with
[50:57] you
[50:58] so that you'll never be alone
[51:02] that every trouble of life God is just a
[51:05] breath's prayer away
[51:08] now that's a door to Fellowship
[51:11] that's a real door to Fellowship right
[51:13] there
[51:15] here's another thing that Satan will do
[51:16] for us
[51:18] for us or to us I guess it would be how
[51:21] about when you come into church and you
[51:23] sing some different songs
[51:26] like
[51:27] for example
[51:28] there's nothing like the presence
[51:32] there's nothing like the presence of the
[51:35] Lord
[51:37] how many have you ever how many has ever
[51:39] felt that or sang that and felt
[51:42] there really is nothing like the
[51:44] presence of the Lord because the
[51:45] anointing is just so thick at that
[51:47] moment and then you don't realize it but
[51:49] it's the devil that comes to you and
[51:53] you think
[51:55] if I could just take this presence with
[51:57] me
[52:00] now we're getting the difference between
[52:02] God's anointing and his presence
[52:04] confused and letting Satan pull the wool
[52:07] over your eyes that you're not taking
[52:09] the presence of the Lord with you
[52:14] so we have to be very careful about our
[52:16] language and even very careful about the
[52:17] way we sing and understand our songs
[52:20] so that we can have the right
[52:21] understanding of things it's like the
[52:23] song we bring the sacrifice of praise in
[52:26] the house the lord well usually when we
[52:28] sing that we're understanding also that
[52:30] we are also the house the Lord there's
[52:32] this duplicity of language that's
[52:33] happening
[52:35] and that's why I like the song um
[52:38] this is your house
[52:41] I remember the first time we ever sang
[52:42] that song here
[52:44] well no the first time we ever sang that
[52:46] song I sang we just sang the first
[52:48] chorus this is your house this is your
[52:49] house finally come and dwell and you
[52:52] know I in my mind's eye I thought about
[52:54] it as the congregation of Saints and the
[52:57] fact that we were all here together and
[52:58] this is your house and we're preparing
[53:00] forth service and Lord come and speak to
[53:02] us in in the broader sense right
[53:05] but how many remember the first time you
[53:07] sang that second course and it it went
[53:10] from this is your house to we are your
[53:12] house
[53:14] I am your house
[53:16] and now we we really understood what the
[53:18] song was talking about it's I'm the
[53:21] Tabernacle of God
[53:22] Lord come and come and dwell here if
[53:25] you're not already abiding in me and
[53:27] your Holy Spirit Come and come and make
[53:28] me your Tabernacle I'm your house I was
[53:31] built for the presence of God I was
[53:32] built for the inhabitation of the Holy
[53:34] One I was built to be holy as he is Holy
[53:37] and now all of a sudden the right
[53:40] understanding of the song brings forth
[53:42] all this Revelation and understanding in
[53:45] this beautiful worship before the Lord
[53:48] I wonder if we can maybe if a sound and
[53:51] audio video team could bring up that
[53:53] song
[53:55] um
[53:56] the song that uh in the presence of the
[53:58] Lord
[53:59] um
[54:01] forgive me it was
[54:03] there's nothing like the presence of the
[54:05] Lord
[54:07] as they bring up the lyrics you'll see
[54:08] there's nothing like the presence of the
[54:10] Lord there's nothing like the in in your
[54:13] presence there is peace and your
[54:15] presence there is forgiveness
[54:17] and your presence there's healing
[54:22] and and if we're singing it wrongly
[54:25] we'll think while I'm here in this
[54:28] moment there's peace
[54:31] while I'm here in this moment there's
[54:32] healing and there's forgiveness and and
[54:34] we're not recognizing the presence of
[54:36] the Lord that the the daily presence the
[54:39] Lord is going unrecognized
[54:41] go ahead and go to the next song brother
[54:45] there's Deliverance there's joy
[54:48] there's freedom
[54:49] there's healing
[54:52] there's Revival in the presence of God
[54:56] and we think oh
[54:58] here in this moment in the here now all
[55:00] these things are available to me and
[55:03] Satan will be like yeah if you don't get
[55:04] it right now you're just gonna have to
[55:06] wait until the next service the
[55:07] anointing comes
[55:09] see he wants to change our understanding
[55:12] well even sing like
[55:14] that we're coming into the presence of
[55:16] the Lord
[55:18] but what is what are we really singing
[55:20] about or singing about the fellowship of
[55:23] God
[55:24] so there's a difference between God's
[55:26] Fellowship
[55:28] God's presence
[55:30] because while it's true that the holy
[55:32] ghost-filled Christian
[55:35] cannot get away from God's presence
[55:38] you still have a choice because God's a
[55:41] gentleman whether or not you're going to
[55:42] be in a fellowship with him
[55:44] he doesn't get up in your face and and
[55:47] make you have fellowship with him
[55:51] the Bible says it this way
[55:54] Christ says abide in me and die in you
[55:58] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[56:00] itself
[56:01] accept it abide in the vine no more can
[56:03] ye accept ye abide in me I am the vine
[56:07] you are the branches he that abideth in
[56:09] me shall bear much fruit but without me
[56:12] you can do nothing
[56:15] so now we're moving from God just
[56:17] abiding in US
[56:19] to are we abiding in God
[56:22] now we're moving down at the real
[56:24] question that Satan doesn't want us to
[56:26] ask
[56:27] and it becomes a little bit more
[56:29] difficult
[56:31] because now it's no longer well
[56:34] presence of God with me or not and if
[56:37] the presence of God isn't with me then
[56:40] there's Talent like this
[56:43] I don't know the shared responsibility
[56:45] maybe he's not here so you know I'm not
[56:50] fully culpable right now but if he's
[56:52] here
[56:54] then now the only thing that's left is
[56:57] are you entertaining his presence
[57:00] if he's abiding in you the only thing is
[57:02] left is are you abiding in him
[57:04] you made a choice 10 or 15 or 20 years
[57:09] ago or maybe just a month ago to receive
[57:11] the gift of the Holy Ghost and he's
[57:13] abiding in you
[57:14] but are you making the choice daily
[57:16] to abide in him
[57:19] now we're
[57:21] delving down to uh your responsibility
[57:26] we're moving from just
[57:28] being in God's presence
[57:31] to being
[57:32] in fellowshipping and communion with him
[57:36] and so many times I I wonder if we're
[57:40] making a little excuse for ourselves
[57:42] well I'll just wait till church and then
[57:44] I'll get in the presence of God but what
[57:46] if you were so aware that God's presence
[57:48] was with you in the car
[57:50] would you choose that radio station or
[57:53] would you choose to speak to him
[57:58] what if you were aware that God's
[58:00] presence was with you in your living
[58:01] room and your home
[58:03] what would be your choices
[58:05] see Satan wants you to think that God's
[58:07] way out here oh he's watching it's from
[58:10] a distance like his omnipresence it's
[58:12] there but it's kind of from a distance
[58:14] his eyes are from a distance but what if
[58:17] what if
[58:18] you know he said I I'm knocking on your
[58:21] heart store whoever will open I'll come
[58:23] in and sup with him and you've already
[58:25] opened the door and he's he's sitting
[58:27] over here at your table
[58:31] and he's just waiting to sup with you
[58:33] now
[58:34] you've already opened your heart's door
[58:36] with him he's not leaving he's not going
[58:39] anywhere he's going to fulfill his
[58:40] promise to you he said I'm here I'll
[58:43] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[58:46] but now what are we going to do
[58:48] are we going to entertain his presence
[58:51] are we going to fellowship with him
[58:57] or are we going to be distracted
[59:02] you know David pled Lord turn not thy
[59:05] face from me
[59:06] but now I feel like maybe we're all just
[59:09] turning our faces from the Lord over to
[59:11] our cell phones
[59:13] it's like he's over there I mean anybody
[59:15] ever caught yourself doing this with
[59:17] your spouse or even God forbid a guest
[59:20] because at least your spouse you know
[59:22] they're just your spouse after all
[59:24] but a guest it's embarrassing when it
[59:27] happens to a guest and you just out of
[59:28] habit pulled out your cell phone and
[59:30] you're you're looking at it
[59:32] just
[59:33] your face is just engrossed and they're
[59:35] over there and kind of tooling their
[59:36] thumbs
[59:38] that's God's presence today
[59:43] brother Brandon piece of sermon the
[59:45] presence of God unrecognized and how
[59:47] many times we're still not recognizing
[59:49] the presence of God in our daily lives
[59:55] here's another one
[59:57] Captain he's present
[59:59] but we're hurried
[1:00:02] we're in a rush
[1:00:05] were
[1:00:07] we've got the next thing coming
[1:00:09] got to get ready for work and after once
[1:00:11] we get done once we once we get in the
[1:00:13] car we've we've got to catch up with the
[1:00:14] news and once we get to work we've got
[1:00:16] to catch up with this and and and and
[1:00:18] this whole world is just so set up to
[1:00:21] hurry us
[1:00:22] technology has bought us so much time
[1:00:25] but it's
[1:00:26] substituted with chains of bondage back
[1:00:29] to it we we got the washing machine
[1:00:31] along with the washing machine we got
[1:00:33] the television we got the laptop to make
[1:00:36] this more effective at work and now I
[1:00:39] have to work so many hours but with a
[1:00:41] laptop we also got social media and cell
[1:00:43] phones in our pockets everything else
[1:00:46] so it comes down to your choice where
[1:00:47] are you going to put your time at
[1:00:50] are we going to be fellowshipping with
[1:00:51] God
[1:00:53] and I'd like to say this that abiding
[1:00:56] is incompatible With A hurried lifestyle
[1:01:01] some of us just need to slow down
[1:01:06] God has bought all of this for you he's
[1:01:09] bought for you access to his presence
[1:01:12] that you can come boldly before him
[1:01:14] anytime
[1:01:16] and come into fellowship with them that
[1:01:18] you don't have to work like an
[1:01:20] Israelites did and say well if I want to
[1:01:22] come into a fellowship with God I'm
[1:01:24] going to have to pick out the best
[1:01:26] unblemished
[1:01:28] cattle and unblemish sheep and I'm gonna
[1:01:30] have to come and bring it before an
[1:01:32] altar and I'm going to have to do all
[1:01:33] this and spill some blood and it's it's
[1:01:35] a whole day prayer just to be able to
[1:01:37] dress ourselves up for the presence of
[1:01:39] God
[1:01:41] but God's removed all those barriers
[1:01:44] but have you removed yours
[1:01:47] God's removed all the barriers to get
[1:01:49] into his presence
[1:01:51] and the only thing that's remaining
[1:01:54] is the barriers that you've allowed this
[1:01:57] world Direct
[1:01:59] for that Fellowship
[1:02:01] to happen
[1:02:02] the only barriers between you
[1:02:05] and God
[1:02:06] are the barriers that you've allowed to
[1:02:09] be erected no longer the barriers that
[1:02:12] Adam and Eve have erected
[1:02:14] those have been torn down
[1:02:18] the middle wall has been torn down that
[1:02:20] wall of separation but now we've got the
[1:02:23] walls of our cell phones and our hurried
[1:02:25] lifestyles
[1:02:29] some of us just need a little bit more
[1:02:31] quiet places in our life
[1:02:34] you know even to his disciples who
[1:02:35] didn't have cell phones at the time
[1:02:36] Christ came along and said hey come away
[1:02:38] to a quiet place we're too busy right
[1:02:40] now
[1:02:41] and they had to have that Fellowship
[1:02:43] that communion in quiet places
[1:02:49] how about
[1:02:51] present but you're just not interested
[1:02:57] that you find it easier
[1:03:01] to enjoy the fellowship with Allah the
[1:03:03] world than the fellowship with God
[1:03:06] maybe because it's easier to press a
[1:03:08] button it's more
[1:03:10] instantly gratifying get your dopamines
[1:03:13] up by jumping on Facebook
[1:03:17] um
[1:03:18] it's just too hard to slow down and
[1:03:20] change your lifestyle you've you've sold
[1:03:22] out too much to it and you're enjoying
[1:03:25] it too much
[1:03:27] and you're not recognizing the beauty
[1:03:30] that God wants to offer you
[1:03:32] that would be kind of like
[1:03:34] the Gentiles and the people of Israel
[1:03:37] before the Ten Commandments came
[1:03:39] and God comes along and offers the Ten
[1:03:41] Commandments and in there it says don't
[1:03:43] commit adultery and they're too busy
[1:03:46] having fornicating affairs with everyone
[1:03:51] and they're like this is too much fun
[1:03:55] I'm not
[1:03:56] going to give up that lifestyle
[1:03:59] and not saying wait this is God's grace
[1:04:01] to me he's he's got a better way for me
[1:04:06] and we know now because we've been
[1:04:09] following him this way long enough that
[1:04:11] we know that a one-woman man and a
[1:04:14] one-man woman
[1:04:15] is the best way that it could possibly
[1:04:17] be
[1:04:18] right that's God's grace to us that it's
[1:04:21] a beautiful wonderful thing and how we
[1:04:23] would never want to go back to anything
[1:04:24] else
[1:04:26] we even talk about it when when someone
[1:04:28] makes that mistake they we say they they
[1:04:30] fell because we're way up here and this
[1:04:33] is just so way down here
[1:04:37] what if what if we changed our
[1:04:39] priorities so much
[1:04:41] and I'm culpable this morning I'm here
[1:04:43] with you I'm I'm going through this
[1:04:46] myself I'm
[1:04:47] I I allowed myself to come underneath
[1:04:50] that same that same lie of the enemy
[1:04:53] that God's presence was was distant from
[1:04:55] me and that it was God that was distant
[1:04:57] and I didn't know how to get into his
[1:04:58] presence there was just too much work
[1:05:00] and all the this facade of lies that
[1:05:02] were constructed
[1:05:04] and just the other day I was in the car
[1:05:06] and the Lord just began to speak to my
[1:05:08] heart and was like God just missed me
[1:05:11] and I found out that as he began to peel
[1:05:15] back the lies in my own heart
[1:05:17] I said you're right Lord you are present
[1:05:20] I don't have to work at this thing
[1:05:23] I don't have to work at climbing a
[1:05:25] mountain to get back into God's presence
[1:05:27] I don't have to go climb Mount Sinai
[1:05:30] all I have to do is just breathe his
[1:05:32] name
[1:05:34] and when I breathed that precious name
[1:05:36] of Jesus I said Lord
[1:05:38] would you like to have fellowship with
[1:05:40] me right now
[1:05:42] peace in the presence of the Lord just
[1:05:44] came into the car and my next stop I
[1:05:46] just had to wipe away the tears
[1:05:48] I said Lord
[1:05:50] was it that easy the whole time
[1:05:52] because in my mind I built it up a lot
[1:05:55] more than that
[1:05:57] I built it up like your presence was so
[1:05:59] far from me and I had to do this this
[1:06:01] and this to get back into presence with
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:05] and now I'm coming out from the other
[1:06:07] side of that lie and I'm saying Lord
[1:06:08] your presence is right here now I want
[1:06:10] to enjoy your fellowship
[1:06:12] and whatever I have to do to change my
[1:06:14] lifestyle
[1:06:15] that's the way I want to do it
[1:06:18] and I believe that if the Lord takes me
[1:06:20] on this road
[1:06:22] I'll be able to look back one day and
[1:06:25] and just as I'll be able to say wow that
[1:06:28] cell phone is so far beneath me now
[1:06:31] just like adultery would be so far
[1:06:33] beneath me after I was after I've
[1:06:36] enjoyed what God has for me in a
[1:06:38] one-woman marriage
[1:06:40] it's so far beneath me I hear about what
[1:06:43] these people and and and Hollywood do
[1:06:46] and these billionaires do and they're
[1:06:48] like wow they've got all those billions
[1:06:52] richest man in the world maybe in that's
[1:06:55] what he's doing with his life
[1:06:57] wow my life is way better than his
[1:07:02] and I believe that
[1:07:04] if we could have that lesson from the
[1:07:06] old Ten Commandments given 5 000 years
[1:07:09] ago or so
[1:07:11] how much more if we could learn a few
[1:07:13] Lessons In This Modern Age that we need
[1:07:16] to rearrange our priorities and not fall
[1:07:18] prey to the lifestyle of this world
[1:07:21] and lift up fellowship with God and
[1:07:23] fellowship with his people above
[1:07:25] everything else
[1:07:26] what is that what saith in scripture
[1:07:28] gather yourselves together so much the
[1:07:31] more as that day
[1:07:33] cometh
[1:07:35] gather yourselves together like this
[1:07:37] or maybe gather yourselves together all
[1:07:39] watching a movie together no that's not
[1:07:42] what I'm talking about
[1:07:43] gather yourselves together in Fellowship
[1:07:46] that's what we need to be focusing on
[1:07:49] right now is to rearrange all of our
[1:07:51] priorities so that it becomes the most
[1:07:54] interesting thing in our lives
[1:07:57] you know I find out that the thing that
[1:07:59] you feed on the most becomes the thing
[1:08:02] that's most interesting to you
[1:08:04] I've had Hobbies and that I no longer
[1:08:07] like anymore because I don't feed on
[1:08:09] them anymore
[1:08:10] some of them were perfectly fine Hobbies
[1:08:12] had to be kind of
[1:08:13] you know be kind of silly for me to
[1:08:15] share some of the Hobbies right now that
[1:08:16] I want that I had when I was a 12 year
[1:08:18] old
[1:08:19] or even some of the hobbies that I had
[1:08:21] in my 20s
[1:08:22] but I put those things away like Paul
[1:08:25] said I put away the childish things when
[1:08:28] I became a man
[1:08:30] and I think there's still some Childish
[1:08:31] things in my life and maybe in yours too
[1:08:34] that I'm working to put away
[1:08:37] because
[1:08:38] I want to enjoy the manly fellowship
[1:08:41] with the most manliest man that ever
[1:08:44] walked the face the Earth
[1:08:45] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] and the more that we feed on that
[1:08:52] the more interesting it will become
[1:08:54] maybe it just becomes a bunch of black
[1:08:56] letters to you right now
[1:08:58] but you keep feeding on it and you keep
[1:09:00] feeding on it you find yourself in the
[1:09:02] word
[1:09:03] and you find out wow God has a lot to
[1:09:06] say about men in here you find out God
[1:09:08] called me his friend and he called me
[1:09:09] accept and beloved and complete and
[1:09:11] redeemed and sealed into the end and
[1:09:14] then he he starts talking about my
[1:09:16] brothers and sisters in here how we're
[1:09:17] all caught up together and having places
[1:09:19] and we're gonna live in a city where the
[1:09:21] lamb is the light
[1:09:23] have you ever thought about the city
[1:09:25] where the lamb is the light and wondered
[1:09:27] I hope I make it out there
[1:09:29] I hope I make it to where the lamb is
[1:09:31] the light
[1:09:33] I hope I don't have to be one of those
[1:09:35] ones that live outside the city
[1:09:40] well there's another lie of the devil
[1:09:42] this morning
[1:09:43] because how could it be that you will
[1:09:46] have the promise that God would be with
[1:09:48] you forever and then you get up right to
[1:09:50] the Gates of Glory it says oh yeah that
[1:09:53] ex that promise has expired here's the
[1:09:55] city where the lamb is like you're going
[1:09:57] to live just over there outside the city
[1:10:02] that's just a lie at the enemy trying to
[1:10:04] confuse you with all these wonderings
[1:10:06] just have confidence in God this morning
[1:10:09] or what about
[1:10:11] I hope I don't make I don't I hope I
[1:10:13] don't end up in hell what is hell but
[1:10:15] the absence of God's presence
[1:10:17] and if God has sealed his presence
[1:10:19] presence into you for all of time
[1:10:21] how could you ever go to hell
[1:10:24] your very makeup who you are could would
[1:10:28] ruin hell itself
[1:10:30] because the moment that you stepped into
[1:10:33] hell
[1:10:33] hell would no longer be hell
[1:10:36] because there would be the presence of
[1:10:38] God
[1:10:40] hell hell is reserved for the devil and
[1:10:42] his angels and it's it's a place of
[1:10:44] separation from God's presence and if
[1:10:47] God has promised that he who receives
[1:10:49] the Holy Ghost could never be separated
[1:10:52] from my presence then you could never be
[1:10:54] placed in hell
[1:10:55] how do you receive it this morning
[1:10:57] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:10:59] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:11:01] of your sins paid for by the Lamb of God
[1:11:04] and he says I will bring you into
[1:11:06] Fellowship underneath my blood Covenant
[1:11:08] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:11:10] Ghost
[1:11:11] there's your promise this morning
[1:11:16] might be saying though but brother
[1:11:18] Josiah
[1:11:20] will feel so
[1:11:22] distant from God
[1:11:24] and there are times in our lives where
[1:11:26] we do feel distant from God
[1:11:29] a lot of it I think is because we allow
[1:11:31] these lies to come in and make us
[1:11:34] believe that we're distant from God's
[1:11:35] presence even when we're not
[1:11:38] but there is a place where although
[1:11:41] God's presence doesn't leave us brother
[1:11:44] Branham said it's almost like that Dove
[1:11:47] on the lamb flies up and rests on a
[1:11:50] little Branch somewhere when you take on
[1:11:53] the nature of a wolf how many remembers
[1:11:55] that that quote
[1:11:57] now remember once your nature is changed
[1:12:01] fundamentally on the soul level that
[1:12:03] nature will always be divine
[1:12:06] so what brother bran I'm speaking about
[1:12:07] is on the spirit level
[1:12:10] you change from that land that's easily
[1:12:12] led by the dove and you watch you go out
[1:12:15] and watch some some horror flick try
[1:12:17] doing that no don't
[1:12:20] but you let's say you you watch some
[1:12:22] movie that's incompatible
[1:12:24] with the spirit of the dove
[1:12:27] and you pollute your own spirit
[1:12:30] now that Dove can't rest on you that
[1:12:33] Dove can't lead you you've LED yourself
[1:12:35] into a place that now your spirit is
[1:12:38] incompatible with his
[1:12:40] and yes there's a there's a temporary
[1:12:42] breaking in Fellowship
[1:12:45] he's just kind of out a limb somewhere
[1:12:47] waiting for you to change that spirit
[1:12:49] that nature back to that land
[1:12:53] so if you're there this morning friends
[1:12:55] you do have some work to do to enjoy
[1:12:58] God's presence enjoy that Fellowship
[1:13:00] again
[1:13:01] but the work isn't so difficult
[1:13:03] the work isn't nearly as hard it was for
[1:13:05] the Israelites God's made a path of
[1:13:08] repentance so much solely said if we
[1:13:11] confess our sins
[1:13:13] I am faithful and I am just
[1:13:16] to forgive you of your sins and to clean
[1:13:19] up your spirit realm of all that filth
[1:13:21] and all that pollution
[1:13:23] and cleanse you from all unrighteousness
[1:13:26] that's God's promise to us this morning
[1:13:30] as the musicians would perhaps come
[1:13:37] I hope this has been a help for you this
[1:13:39] morning
[1:13:42] to take away from you the lies the enemy
[1:13:45] that God's presence isn't with you
[1:13:49] but to come back to the word
[1:13:51] you know that's the that's the Surefire
[1:13:53] way to get
[1:13:55] the devil off your back is to just come
[1:13:58] back to the word
[1:13:59] come back away from reasoning away even
[1:14:02] from song lyrics because you see how the
[1:14:05] devil will twist your understanding of
[1:14:06] even beautiful songs
[1:14:12] and mess with your understanding there
[1:14:13] but if you get back the word and just
[1:14:16] believe God's promises and filter
[1:14:18] everything else through that I wonder if
[1:14:20] musicians would start playing that song
[1:14:23] Maybe
[1:14:24] there's nothing like the presence of the
[1:14:25] Lord
[1:14:27] we'll filter I want us to I want us to
[1:14:30] sing that to the Lord this morning
[1:14:31] brother Michael you can come and maybe
[1:14:34] back
[1:14:37] maybe sing that this morning with the
[1:14:39] right understanding
[1:14:42] there's nothing like the presence of the
[1:14:43] Lord
[1:14:45] there's nothing like God's abiding
[1:14:47] presence that will never leave you it
[1:14:49] will never forsake you there's nothing
[1:14:51] like the presence of the Lord that has
[1:14:53] been bought and paid for by his own
[1:14:55] blood there's nothing like The
[1:14:58] Fellowship of the Lord
[1:15:00] there's nothing like The Fellowship of
[1:15:02] the Lord that leads to healing and
[1:15:03] Redemption to to Deliverance
[1:15:06] let's sing that together now brother
[1:15:12] [Music]

[1:19:53] ever since I was 13 years old I had this
[1:19:56] problem over here I can't tell you all
[1:19:59] the technical ways to get out of a cycle
[1:20:01] of bondage you might go through years of
[1:20:04] counsel with somebody and sit down with
[1:20:06] a brother or sister who's who's had
[1:20:08] victory in their life but with a family
[1:20:10] issue that your family is dealing with
[1:20:12] or the personal personal thing that
[1:20:14] you're dealing with over here you might
[1:20:16] have years of cycle of bondage on the
[1:20:18] internet years of cycle of bondage over
[1:20:21] some kind of Addiction on a video game
[1:20:22] or whatever you're dealing with I don't
[1:20:25] know friends
[1:20:26] but I can tell you one thing that
[1:20:28] delivers Jesus Christ
[1:20:31] you can do all the technical things you
[1:20:34] can strip your your computer of the
[1:20:37] internet
[1:20:38] you can throw away your cell phones you
[1:20:41] can enlist yourself in a in a monastery
[1:20:43] if that's what you think you need to get
[1:20:46] more serious with God
[1:20:49] that will yield any fruit
[1:20:51] unless you abide in Jesus Christ
[1:20:55] if you abide in me then you'll bear much
[1:20:59] fruit he says that fruit will push away
[1:21:02] all the bad food but he says if you
[1:21:04] don't abide in there you can do nothing
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] God wants to show you this morning
[1:21:12] this presence is
[1:21:15] here on this platform
[1:21:16] I want to get that lie so far away from
[1:21:19] our hearts this morning
[1:21:20] not hear your seat this morning but
[1:21:23] God's presence he said it's a Bobby that
[1:21:25] you prepared him I want to dwell in your
[1:21:28] Tabernacle I want to dwell in your heart
[1:21:30] you were created for my presence you are
[1:21:32] created for my Holiness you are created
[1:21:34] to be a holy being unto me
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:39] when you leave here this morning you
[1:21:41] have not left the presence
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:45] of God if you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:47] you I keep saying that because it's so
[1:21:49] important Paul himself said make your
[1:21:51] calling and your election sure be
[1:21:53] certain of your own salvation but if
[1:21:55] you're certain this morning of God's
[1:21:57] Gift the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:22:00] in your life and be certain
[1:22:02] be certain of his presence of you if
[1:22:06] you're dealing with some
[1:22:07] some repetitious and friends that you
[1:22:10] feel like I I just I'll repent of it and
[1:22:14] I don't feel good because I know it's
[1:22:16] just gonna happen again
[1:22:18] why don't you just try letting that
[1:22:21] burden grow this morning
[1:22:24] they're saying I I'm just going to start
[1:22:27] driving with
[1:22:30] I'm going to start by going the presence
[1:22:32] of the chain breaker
[1:22:35] I'm going to start by going into the
[1:22:36] presence I've been talking to all these
[1:22:38] people that have so much advice about
[1:22:41] how to get free
[1:22:42] I'm gonna go to the one who freed them
[1:22:46] I've been having counselor with a pastor
[1:22:48] about how to how to be a better
[1:22:49] Christian I'm going to go to the one who
[1:22:52] made my pastor a better Christian
[1:22:55] I've been listening to so many sermons
[1:22:57] about brother Branham I'm gonna go to
[1:22:59] the source where brother Branham got his
[1:23:01] sermons
[1:23:03] you know if you do anything else
[1:23:06] if you try if you just focus on hearing
[1:23:09] what other men have to say the spirit
[1:23:12] told me this oh my let me write that one
[1:23:14] down the spirit told me this that's
[1:23:15] really good but if you can never say the
[1:23:18] spirit told me this then you're just
[1:23:21] feeding off somebody else's spirituality
[1:23:24] and there will be no fruit in that he
[1:23:27] did not say if you abide in Paula
[1:23:29] Fontaine you'll bring more more food he
[1:23:32] did not say if you abide in Josiah
[1:23:34] Cornett he'd even say if you abide in
[1:23:36] the William Brandon you'll bring forth
[1:23:37] much through
[1:23:40] he wants to make this personal with you
[1:23:43] if you abide in me
[1:23:46] so that's that song one more time but
[1:23:48] let's let's sing it with a feeling
[1:23:50] knowing that you hear this he's talking
[1:23:53] to you
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:24:05] [Music]
