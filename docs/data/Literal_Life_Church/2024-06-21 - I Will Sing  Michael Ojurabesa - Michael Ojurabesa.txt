I Will Sing

Lyrics:
Lord, you seem so far away
A million miles or more, it feels today
And though I haven't lost my faith
I must confess right now that it's hard for me to pray

But I don't know what to say
And I don't know where to start
But as You give the grace
With all that's in my heart

I will sing (yes)
I will praise
Even in my darkest hour
Through the sorrow and the pain

I will sing
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true
I will sing

Lord, it's hard for me to see
All the thoughts and plans you have for me (yes, it is)
But I will put my trust in You
Knowing that You died to set me free (oh, thank God)

But I don't know what to say (what to say)
And I don't know where to start (where to start)
But as You give the grace
With all that's in my heart

I will sing
I will praise
Even in my darkest hour
Through the sorrow and the pain

I will sing (yes, I will)
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true (sing it again)

I will sing (oh, we sing tonight)
I will praise
Even in my darkest hour
Through the sorrow and the pain

I will sing
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing

Oh, we sing to You, Lord
Oh, we sing to You, Lord, tonight
(Hallelujah) we sing to You, Lord
Oh, we lift our voices and say
We worship you, Lord
We sing to you, Lord, we sing, we sing, we sing
We sing, we sing, we sing
Oh, we worship You, Lord

Oh, thank You, Lord
I will sing
Oh, yes, I will
I will sing (Jesus, oh, Jesus)
