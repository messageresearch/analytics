========================================

[music] or mountains and [singing] valleyies. 11 at night, a star of most radant light. The wise [music] men rejoiced [singing] as they journeyed a far to behold [music] such a beautiful smile. [music] Yes, others saw the star, but they [music and singing] followed it not. To them it would come and would pass. [music and singing] But wise men kept trusting with all [singing] of their heart that the star would find the baby at [music and singing] last. And when they saw the star, they rejoice with great joy. When they saw the star, they [music and singing] rejoice. When they saw the star, they [music] rejoice with great joy. They rejoice [singing] with exceeding great joy. [music] [singing] Oh, so long [music] I had traveled [singing] in darkness of night with [music] no one to show me [singing] the way. But one day the Lord let his [music] light shine on me. And now I'm walking in his [singing] love every day.
