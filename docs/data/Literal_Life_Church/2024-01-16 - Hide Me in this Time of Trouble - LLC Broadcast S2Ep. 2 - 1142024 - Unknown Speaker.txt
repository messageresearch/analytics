and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life I tell you this experience with the Lord and where David wanted to live is not a one year at Camp's experience it's not once a week at church he said this is the one thing I desire in my life and that is I'd seek after this and that's to dwell in the presence of the Lord every day of my life can you say amen and so and to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord I want to speak a little bit out of Psalms 27 and I want to title this hide me in this time of trouble hide me in this time of trouble David is the only one that used this term four or five times in his writings uh besides job and uh he just says those words hide me and uh he asked God God hide me hide me and I'm only one of the reasons I'm preaching this is because that's why that's the way I have felt lately and that is Lord just hide me just hide me there's a certain protection can you say amen and so he asked the Lord but I I was looking at it uh the last couple days and it seems a bit mysterious if you don't understand why David is saying hide me it seems a bit mysterious because we know that David is a warrior David was a fighter David from his very young years as a teen was had faith in God and he wasn't afraid of anything he proved himself to be unafraid of the enemy since he was a little boy so if we were to use the context of him saying Lord hide me my enemies are encamped about me hide me it doesn't seem like it's the right thing for David to say because he doesn't look like somebody that would hide from the enemy he actually ran towards Goliath he didn't have have a problem of being afraid of the enemy and it it just seems mysterious that he would say Lord hide me from the enemy they're encamped about me and and and there's and there's there's I feel it moving in and approaching them to me kind of like we feel in the time we live in and so he but you see we we we don't have the impression from David's life that he was one that would be one that would run from the enemy or to hide and and yet he's asking the Lord hide me Lord hide hi me yet it is not running away or it's not being scared in other words he's not saying hide me because he's afraid because he said it the Beginning To Whom Shall I Fear I don't fear anything he says the Lord is my strength of whom shall I be afraid he's not saying hide me because he's afraid he's not saying it because he's wanting to run from the enemy that's not David and yet it is not a running away or a scared he he says he is not afraid uh To Whom Shall I Fear I'm not afraid he said in this will I be confident there's full confidence here there's no fear here but yet we must realize that fear is around him fear is surrounding him can you say Amen uh uh uh the there's there's the enemy surrounding him my foes that were coming to eat my flesh he's being completely surrounded by the enemy and so he's saying hide me not because he's afraid but because if he don't live in that secret place then he's vulnerable to become influenced by this fear that's right praise the Lord so uh he says I'm confident but he says do hide me that he says let me live in a place that's protected and a place that's higher another place that opens up to me that would be higher than the enemy now but in Psalm 642 the way he says it and hide me he says it this way he says hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the Insurrection of the workers of iniquity so now we get a little bit more window into what he's saying hide me from and that is the the secret counsel of the wicked from the Insurrection of workers of iniquity the secret counsel of the wicked in other words hide me don't let me be affected by what's being said about me in private yeah things are being said about from my enemy and that's the secret counsel and things are but so NE this is something he said hide me from that and I'm just just just pondering this morning with you why would he say hide me from that I'm going to bring this out if I can why is David saying hide me from the secret counsil of the wicked I wonder if this hide me is not so much is is is not so much protection from a regular war or arrows that are coming at him uh he wouldn't be afraid of that but maybe what he will hear that is being said about him and what he would hear being said about him might affect him a little bit and that would influence him and may influence him out of this place of protection uh just bear with me as I just lay these foundations maybe he hide me means that I don't want to be affected affected by what's being said about me I I'm just preaching this because this the way I'm feeling lately before the Lord God just hide me I just feel like I lately I just feel like I'm trying to stay out of the line of fire has anybody ever felt that that way you know just don't say too much because if you say something if you say too much it can and will be used against you in the court of law and that's how the enemy is can you say am man you can have the best intentions and say something it gets twisted by the enemy can I get an amen and so it kind of makes you on edge is that I'm just trying to stay out of line of of fire things being shot at me things being said this how David felt this is all through the book of Psalms where he talks about the enemy and things coming at him and his enemy what they're saying about him and so David had to live in another place David had to live in a higher place because why words can affect us the enemy's attacks can affect us especially if we have a lot of complexes the enemy abuses those things so he wanted to live in a higher place that he wasn't affected or brought down by that and he was saying hide me it hide me from those things God just hide me and sometimes it's safer not to say anything or the devil can twist it and I I just want to be I don't know about you but in this last age where there's such a and I'll talk about this in a minute just such a a pressure such a pressure and such enemy power against Christians I just want to be a simple Christian with no gu and no pre pretense I just want to be nice and I do that and I still can't do things right job is the only other man who said hide me and he says it this way which is to me a mystery behind it job 1413 says oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me now I want to elaborate on this because uh all that job went through this is what he says in all that he's gone through on Earth he said hide me in the grave in other words there's a lot of pressure he went through a lot of losses he had in this life but he had a revelation of Resurrection how many know that job had a revelation of Resurrection how many know that job was not afraid of the Grave he's not afraid of the Grave he's not afraid of dying because he knows the grave is not the end for him he's got a revelation that if I go there it's not the end it's actually just the beginning and I will end this life someday I will end the pressure here someday and if I'm put in that grave to hide there that's a good place for a Christian to hide because God's going to come and pull me out of that grave someday and job says hide me in the grave that says a lot there's a mystery behind this that only job knew and that is nobody would ask God to hide me in the grave that's not a place most people on the face of the Earth are saying just hide me in the grave you'd have to have a revelation to ask God hide me in the grave you'd have to have a revelation of resurrection and Rapture to say hide me in the grave and so job has that Revelation and unless they they knew people knew that it was some sort of a a Hideout and I believe Jo job did not look at it as death he looked at it as kind of a hideout until the resurrection this is what psalms 27 is because the revelation of the Rapture is tied to psalms 27 how many Believers know that psalms 27 is the text that was used for Rapture the revelation of the Rapture is tied to this very mysterious scripture where he says in Psalms 27 what we read read today though a host should encamp abound me those fears around me I will not fear I will be confident but Lord I need one thing one thing I desire to dwell wherever your dwelling I need to be in the secret of your Tabernacle I need to live in that protection can you say Amen because this is the conditions before Rapture there had to be a a a hideout there had to be a secret place and if we didn't have it we won't survive Le O deia we won't survive the judgments of God we won't survive the conditions we better be real and say without the Holy Spirit and living in his presence none of us have the human capability to survive the times that we're living in right now now the quicker some of us raise our hands and be honest about it there's nothing within you that can make it in these times without the Holy Ghost secret place you can't get rapturing Faith unless you're in that place that's the room that's the place he gives you Faith because why outside of that is doubt is Fear Can you sayen you're not going to get rapturing Faith by feeding on the things of the world you're not going to get rapturing Faith by feeding on a denominational Creed you're not going to get rapturing Faith by just some nominal Christian thing God has provided the food to bring rapturing Faith to his people in the last days and if you stay outside of the secret place then you realize you don't have the strength teen anger I'm going to tell you as your friend and your servant of the Lord you cannot make it in this lustful age without the Holy Ghost your mental capability your willpower it's not good enough for Satan's Eden come on friends can I get a greater amen it's you're not good enough there's nothing going to make it except you get in Christ in that place with Christ families are not going to make it without being in this word in being in with Christ marriages are not going to make it without being rooted very heavy in that secret place with Christ where the word is the most important thing in your life oh I can play around this I can you know what no no it's too much maybe in Luther's day you might have survived it a little bit but in this Satan's Eden it takes this answer to the Rapture to develop rapturing Faith it's a developing room job thought it was a it was was a it's it's a hideout it's a place job never seen it as the end but a hideout a waiting room a Green Room you me know what everyone know what a green room is it's the Green Room green room before the big stage event The Green Room is where all the artists go and they wait it out before they are invited to the big stage event and to perform job is in the green room waiting to be called for the big Resurrection event praise the Lord everybody body he wanted to be hiding until Jesus cried out and there he was all the Old Testament Saints who died in the Lord there they are hiding out in the grave they're hiding in the grave and everybody thought they're dead and they're gone no they're just in the green room waiting to be called on stage and sure enough when Jesus cried out with a loud voice there was a power behind his voice of resurrection and the Bible says they come out of the green room and they showed thems El in the city streets of Jerusalem their life wasn't over the grave the grave wasn't the end they were just hiding out there hide me appearing now the Bride of Jesus Christ on stage and as she goes to the Grave she's waiting in the green room because it's gonna how many knows it's going to happen again how many knows there's a voice of Resurrection how many knows there's a shout for the rapture Jesus said the shout Paul said the shout the voice and the Trump the three phases of the Rapture that means that we're already in the cycle of it the shout the voice of the Resurrection the same voice that called the Saints out of the Grave is the same voice that's here now the message ended up being the the shout ended up being something different we ever thought from a Pentecostal view view and here he presents it the shout as a message and a prophet to gather the people together so we're already in the cycle of it now we're looking for that voice of the resur Resurrection which will be in The Bride of Jesus Christ she's the Earthly body on Earth something's going to happen in her to trigger the resurrection is that David said hide me in the secret of his dwelling place and that types with the Rapture or that uh links with the Rapture because we know this he says put me in not your Tabernacle not your Pavilion The Secret of your Tabernacle the Rapture also is a secret can you say amen so that ties together perfectly with the Rapture because we're talking about a secret place secret place uh when you have a secret place it means that not everybody knows where it is not everybody knows where it is or not everybody is called to that secret place uh it's a place that God develops us for rapturing Faith it's a place seekely it has to be a place why because all around is doubts and fears and questions all around us is doubts and fears and questions and Satan messing with absolutes all the time Satan closing in on us with his doubts you can't get more rapturing faith when you're being destabilized by Demons of Doubt let me say it again you can't get rapturing Faith to get out of here when you're exposing yourself online on social media to all kinds of doubt you'll never get rapturing Faith from those sources and if you expose yourself too much to it you'll find yourself doubting cuz that's all that produces it'll never bring rapturing Faith preaching some Creed will never bring rapturing Faith going back to Pentecost will never bring rapturing Faith but God has provided the place that he will preach rapturing Faith to his people he will Rapture his Fe people how many want to be raptured amen but you need rapturing faith Rapture is a revelation I need that Revelation above any re Revelation just before the coming of the Lord and during the midst of the coming scoffers R will rise up and you know what they're scoffing at not just that you're a Christian we always get that but they're scoffing the promise of the Rapture they're scoffing the coming of the lord they're scoffing and making fun of this promise that you believe you're saying Amen to this morning you're saying I believe I'm a part of it there's scoffing they're making fun of that they say where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers came all things continue just as they are that's what the world says that's a lot of times what in the Christian church says that's doesn't mean anything that that that just doesn't mean nothing and so now we have a doubting we have scoffers that are scoffing the promise the very promise that we believe can you say Amen so if we have a day of scoffers then the whole thing is mocking and questioning that whole question when where is the promise of his coming the questions where is the Vindication for all of this so This mocking of things is also mocking what happens in end times events and also especially the promise of the Rapture the coming of the Lord mocking the coming of the Lord and just before Rapture our promise uh we realize that there's an increased intensity of pressure and trouble and that's why I'm pulling out that word out of Psalms 27 the time in the time of trouble in the time of trouble how many believe we're in the time of trouble in the time of trouble I need you to hide me in the time of trouble there is a great intensity of the enemy be being encamped around the people of God in the time of trouble there'll be a lot of trouble we we we ask the Lord to hide us because we don't want to be caught in the trouble it it's it's Pride to say that I won't be caught in all this trouble you have the vulnerability to be caught in the trouble around you you have the the humanness The Human Side the fleshly side of you if you feed on things enough you will be caught in the web just like everybody else is caught in the web of pornography of adultery of Family Division you'll be caught in that world because you're vulnerable to it you'll be caught in it yourself but God gives us an escape God gives us a place out and so in the time of trouble is when he's saying would you please Lord hide me there's no need for us to hide unless there's danger all around can you say amen amen why is David saying hide me Lord hide me because there's danger all around you if you don't realize there's danger all around you and that it could affect you then you're not asking Lord hide me hide me hide me in that rock put me on that rock he's saying lift me above my enemies in the time of trouble please hide me he wouldn't be asking that unless there's danger all around the time of trouble if you don't see there's danger around then you don't see the value of that secret place we need to be hidden away with Christ the Bible says also that we live in perilous times testing times can you say Amen besides all the spirits and Hell being un loosed around Unleashed around us besides the lustful Spirits the perverted Spirits all these things surrounding us it's a time of trouble but then the Bible says in the last days there will be perilous times that means testing time we're vulnerable outside of his daily protection there is a hedge from the spirit of this world there's a protection from the spirit of this world is safety in Jesus Christ the word can you say Amen so in psalms 27 I would say this that it's not so much hiding even though he uses that word but when the other words are there when it says he he shall lift my head above he shall set me up upon a rock and he shall lift my head above my enemies it's not so much about hiding in this but it's but it's lifting us above it all that we can live above it all set me on a rock above my enemies praising the Lord because it says here he sets me up my head above the enemies how many would say I want to live above my enemies it's another atmosphere it's something else I want to live above it and therefore will I offer in this Tabernacle sa sacrifices of joy and I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord so David is so confident here he says when you lift me up above my enemies you put me in a place set me on a rock and you lift me up above my enemies that I can at least be above them and and and then what I'm doing up there is I'm praising I will offer the sacrifices of Joy I will just praise the Lord like I'm not going to be shy to praise the Lord you know is it wouldn't it be annoying as you know David sat on the Rock and he just praising the Lord and all his enemies are down there and he's not even looking at them glory be to God praise be to God and you start sing like I will not come come down to the devil's level he set me up on a rock can you say Amen I'll pray for you my brother but guess what I'm not coming down to where you're at I don't want your fear I don't want your doubts I don't want your nervousness I want to live in this secret place above my enemies and you can imagine if this spirit is true that it's always trying to drag you down they're not happy that you're up there but they're saying hey get down here I got something to talk about with you you get down what do you get down here why can't they come up with you they might not be called to it but if they are they don't want to come up there you need to hear my case you need to hear my disgruntled you need to hear this get down here step off of that chair and get out of that place and we're saying no I want to live there one thing have I desired can you imagine a Believer saying out of all all the things that we could ask for there's really today only one thing I want above money possessions retirements I know I can say this in my heart above a better job above more money above retirements above all the things one thing is what I really want and I'm going to seek after it I want to dwell in the house of the Lord every day of my life I want to stay there I'm going to stay up on that chair can you say amen I will not get down here get down here no
