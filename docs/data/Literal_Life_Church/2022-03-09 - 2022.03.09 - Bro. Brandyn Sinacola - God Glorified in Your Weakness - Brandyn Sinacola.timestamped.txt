[0:02] blessed is the nation whose god is the
[0:04] lord
[0:06] and the people whom he hath chosen for
[0:08] his own inheritance
[0:10] the lord looketh from heaven he
[0:11] beholdeth all the sons of men
[0:14] from the place of his habitation he
[0:16] looketh upon all the inhabitants of the
[0:18] earth
[0:19] he fashioneth their hearts alike he
[0:21] considereth all their works
[0:23] there is no king saved by the multitude
[0:25] of and host a mighty man is not
[0:27] delivered by much strength and horse is
[0:30] a vain thing for safety
[0:32] neither shall he deliver any by his
[0:34] great strength
[0:38] his great strength being a man's
[0:40] strength behold the eye of the lord is
[0:42] upon them that fear him upon them that
[0:44] hope and his mercy
[0:46] to deliver their soul from death and to
[0:48] keep them alive and famine
[0:50] our soul waiteth for the lord he is our
[0:52] help and our shield
[0:54] for our heart shall rejoice in him
[0:56] because
[0:57] we have trusted in his holy name
[1:00] let thy mercy o lord be upon us
[1:02] according as we hope in thee
[1:06] so as i was reading this i just kind of
[1:08] put it in my words what spoke to me
[1:10] the other morning when i read this out
[1:12] of the devotional
[1:13] what i what i seen was god made man in
[1:16] his frailty
[1:18] same god made man
[1:20] and man has really no strength in his
[1:23] own
[1:24] david continues to write he says
[1:27] the the the greatest king a king is the
[1:29] strongest among us right
[1:32] a horse you can't find safety all the
[1:34] strong things that we could as humans
[1:36] find our strength in it's all frailty
[1:40] yet his eyes are always upon man
[1:43] and in the presence of the lord our very
[1:45] strongest means nothing to god
[1:48] it's in the things we'd call weakness
[1:50] that the lord really shows himself
[1:52] mighty in
[1:53] yes amen let's pray father we come
[1:56] before you lord just one more time
[1:58] asking you to help each one of us to get
[2:00] out of the way and hear from you
[2:03] pray lord just
[2:06] take me off my notes through my notes
[2:08] whatever the people need i ask you lord
[2:10] to speak that thing to him
[2:12] granted father let your heart be
[2:14] delivered in jesus name and lord we pray
[2:17] all the needs god that we read tonight
[2:19] for ukraine we ask in jesus name
[2:22] amen
[2:23] amen you can be seated
[2:28] and you don't you don't have to turn
[2:30] there tonight but
[2:33] i've been
[2:34] going through perfect strength by
[2:36] perfect weakness
[2:37] um just something that the lord laid on
[2:39] my heart um
[2:42] a week or more ago
[2:44] and
[2:45] when brother branham takes his text he
[2:47] reads from hebrews 11 and i never i
[2:49] never caught this before
[2:51] so i want to read it to you hebrews 11
[2:53] 32
[2:54] and what shall i say more say for the
[2:56] time would fail me to tell of gideon and
[2:59] of barack and of samson and of jephthah
[3:02] of david also and samuel and of the
[3:04] prophets
[3:05] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[3:07] wrought righteousness obtain promises
[3:10] stop the mouth of lions
[3:12] quench the violence of fire escape the
[3:15] edge of the sword
[3:16] this is a pretty strong report so far
[3:19] and if we take it from the beginning of
[3:20] hebrews 11 we find out that the men and
[3:23] women of faith and and
[3:25] what their testimony is over here in the
[3:27] new testament that paul's writing about
[3:29] is all of their strengths and all that
[3:31] they did and and the the mightiness of
[3:33] the hand i mean escaping the edge of the
[3:35] sword quenching violent violence of fire
[3:38] and
[3:38] wrought righteousness of obtained
[3:40] promise
[3:42] mouths of lions being stopped these are
[3:44] all great mighty things and conquering
[3:46] things but yet
[3:48] verse 34 it says out of weakness we're
[3:50] made strong that's right
[3:52] out of their weakness they were made
[3:54] strong waxed valiant and fight turned to
[3:57] flight the armies of the aliens so this
[3:59] is just it's kind of a unique thing to
[4:02] nestle here in the midst of all of this
[4:03] that out of weakness
[4:06] they were made strong
[4:08] and you know i uh oftentimes it's just
[4:11] maybe my makeup but i i'm continually
[4:14] looking inward and and when i do that
[4:16] most of the time i see all of my
[4:18] weaknesses and you know it gets me down
[4:20] a lot and things you know so we got to
[4:23] be careful doing that but there's
[4:25] there's also a
[4:27] a benefit to seeing your weaknesses too
[4:29] and i want to get into that a little bit
[4:31] but
[4:32] just before i do as as i was listening
[4:35] to the message
[4:36] this this afternoon
[4:39] i don't want to dwell too much time on
[4:41] this but there's there's another side of
[4:44] of what i want to go into tonight that
[4:46] i i'm calling pride and arrogance
[4:49] and that's thinking that god needs your
[4:51] strength to be strong
[4:54] because if we look at each of these
[4:55] scenarios
[4:56] in the hebrews of faith and the heroes
[4:58] of faith and hebrews we can look at them
[5:01] and we could say oh man you know gideon
[5:03] mighty man of valor
[5:05] but when you go back and you look at the
[5:07] story of gideon
[5:09] he was spineless
[5:12] and when you go and you look at barack
[5:14] i wanna i wanna talk a little bit more
[5:16] about these later but when you go and
[5:17] you look at barack he he had he had no
[5:20] backbone he had a woman telling him what
[5:22] to do and then you look at you look at
[5:25] david and he's a rejected king and and
[5:28] getting spit on and and you know
[5:31] can't can't seem to have strength to
[5:33] serve the lord
[5:35] falling to women and then
[5:37] samson i mean we all know samson
[5:40] he had he had strength but yet he was
[5:43] weak with women
[5:45] and so you can you can look at all these
[5:47] things and and you know we could look at
[5:49] these stories though in samson my what
[5:51] strength you know look at all the great
[5:52] things he did
[5:54] but yet it's it's nothing
[5:56] our righteousness the bible says is as
[5:58] filthy rags
[6:00] the very best foot that we can put
[6:02] forward
[6:03] means nothing to god in the presence of
[6:06] god brother branham said this when but
[6:08] when we are thinking that we are able to
[6:10] do it i didn't send you any slides
[6:12] tonight so don't don't worry about it up
[6:14] there but when we are thinking that we
[6:16] are able to do it then god can't use us
[6:19] because we're wanting to do it ourselves
[6:22] and this is
[6:23] a lot of times i guess what had me
[6:25] really thinking about weaknesses and
[6:27] and strengths and things is wondering if
[6:30] some of my weakness isn't trying to do
[6:33] things in my own strength
[6:35] and when you do that it never works
[6:39] so as long as we are trying in ourselves
[6:41] and depending on our own abilities and
[6:42] so forth well we'll do nothing but when
[6:45] we get to a place where we know we're
[6:47] nothing then god can use us
[6:49] the important thing one of the important
[6:51] things that we must master now listen to
[6:53] this this caught my attention now
[6:55] remember this and especially you young
[6:57] preachers and then he says and lay
[6:59] members alike
[7:00] there's one thing that we got to master
[7:02] if we
[7:03] uh expect to fulfill god's desire in our
[7:06] life that is we have to master the
[7:08] thought of human ability
[7:11] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[7:14] that we can do it with our own
[7:15] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[7:18] got to master that in such a way that we
[7:20] get rid of the thing and lay it aside so
[7:23] that god can use use us that's right
[7:26] human ability
[7:28] your very best that you have to offer
[7:31] god we got to get rid of it
[7:34] now in in in you know preaching this i
[7:37] think we i wanted to try my best to
[7:40] define a little bit that there's a
[7:41] difference in confidence and arrogance
[7:44] okay because we can take these things
[7:46] and we can oh you know well now you know
[7:49] it's
[7:50] my strengths i gotta you know me timid
[7:53] you know i'm i'm nothing
[7:55] i gotta be humble
[7:57] and you're really brother branham said
[7:58] if you think too far that way then you
[8:01] don't do nothing
[8:02] you're too afraid to move
[8:04] and oftentimes i'm just being
[8:05] transparent using myself as an example
[8:07] but oftentimes i have a great fear of
[8:09] failure and so if i have that if i if i
[8:13] allow that to control me then i won't do
[8:15] anything
[8:16] you know if you're if you're if you're
[8:18] not failing then you're not doing
[8:19] anything
[8:21] right you're going to have mistakes
[8:22] you're going to have times where you've
[8:24] got to use the back side of the pencil
[8:26] and erase what you what you did because
[8:28] you made an error
[8:29] amen
[8:31] but we can go forward in confidence
[8:33] without it being arrogance so this is
[8:36] what i believe the lord gave me for you
[8:38] tonight sometimes we're afraid to show
[8:40] it because confidence because we don't
[8:42] want it to appear arrogant there's a
[8:44] difference in thinking you have a right
[8:46] so this is this is on the spiritual side
[8:48] now there's a difference in thinking you
[8:50] have a right to come to the throne of
[8:52] grace
[8:54] and you take that attitude no i have a
[8:57] right to come before the throne of gates
[8:58] there was a king who thought he had the
[9:00] right to go into the inner veil
[9:03] and he didn't have that right
[9:04] he was out of place
[9:06] it was it was in his pride that he got
[9:08] lifted up it was he went in in his own
[9:10] strength
[9:12] and so
[9:13] you can you can think that you can go to
[9:15] the throne of grace and you're relying
[9:17] because
[9:18] well
[9:19] this week i i said so many good
[9:21] compliments to somebody and i went to
[9:23] church both sunday and wednesday and i
[9:26] was even early one of those days
[9:30] and you you rely because you're a good
[9:32] person
[9:33] you know i and i've always i thought
[9:35] about that one time years ago long and
[9:37] hard i think it was it was a family
[9:39] member that was passing and i was just
[9:40] thinking and i thought how do you answer
[9:43] somebody when they say well but he was a
[9:45] good person he's going to be in heaven
[9:48] well i don't know that in those times
[9:50] necessarily is the time to really bring
[9:52] out you know theology and and you know
[9:54] doctrine and things and say no he's
[9:56] going to hell you know that's
[9:58] what a great comfort you are but
[10:00] i got to thinking about that from my own
[10:02] self and i thought you know the the lord
[10:05] brought my to my memory the rich young
[10:07] ruler
[10:08] and he came to go to christ and he said
[10:10] how do i inherit eternal life and christ
[10:13] looked at him and he's and he saw that
[10:15] he was he was upright and he and he was
[10:17] a good person and he and he followed the
[10:20] law exactly and he said you know do the
[10:23] commandments and he said i've done them
[10:24] i've been taught from my youth and then
[10:26] when jesus gave him the word on the
[10:28] matter
[10:29] he rejected it look at all when listen
[10:33] now when jesus said
[10:35] give up your strength
[10:37] because the man was drawing strength
[10:39] from his money in the in his possessions
[10:41] when jesus said give that up
[10:43] the man turned it down because he didn't
[10:46] want to show weakness
[10:49] but there's a difference in that and
[10:51] then there's a difference in coming
[10:52] boldly to the throne because you have a
[10:54] revelation that you're a nobody
[10:57] that he made a somebody and opened the
[11:00] way for you by his blood amen that gives
[11:03] you the boldness
[11:05] because boldness is is actually humility
[11:08] and when you come humbly realizing that
[11:10] you can't come before the presence of
[11:12] god and yourself you have you have no
[11:15] right within your own strength to ask
[11:18] god for nothing
[11:20] you don't deserve nothing from god but
[11:22] yet he made a way through his blood for
[11:25] you to come to the throne of grace and
[11:27] not only that he said come boldly
[11:30] come boldly recognizing what i did for
[11:33] you
[11:34] so you have no you don't rely on your
[11:36] strength coming and asking god for
[11:38] anything you come because christ made
[11:41] the way and he bid you come
[11:44] now there's a confidence that comes with
[11:46] experience both naturally and
[11:48] spiritually
[11:49] you know you gain as you gain experience
[11:52] in your job you have a confidence that
[11:55] yeah i can i can accomplish this task
[11:57] there's nothing wrong with that
[11:59] absolutely nothing wrong with it
[12:01] um now i wouldn't suggest that if you're
[12:04] a diesel mechanic that you go work on
[12:06] jet planes
[12:09] okay
[12:11] all the mechanics are saying
[12:13] i could do that you try it see
[12:18] but there's a confidence right that i've
[12:20] worked on so many engines that well
[12:22] let's look at it but to say you know
[12:25] no no you leave
[12:27] i'll get it to fly
[12:29] good luck
[12:33] so there's nothing wrong with it and
[12:34] there's nothing wrong with it
[12:36] spiritually you know there's there's
[12:39] there's a confidence even
[12:41] i i often i think about brother branham
[12:43] dealing with demons in in services
[12:47] dealing with sicknesses
[12:48] and after a while of even the sign in
[12:51] the hand he could he could take somebody
[12:54] by the sign
[12:55] and and i don't know if the angel the
[12:57] lord really had to tell him what it was
[12:59] after a while because he started
[13:01] recognizing it
[13:03] he could say this you know this pattern
[13:05] is this way and that's that's what it is
[13:07] and then even
[13:08] even seeing the other dimension and
[13:10] seeing demons crying out to each other
[13:13] now if you remember if you take that
[13:15] story when he was when he was first
[13:17] starting off in his ministry and uh that
[13:20] that that sister came and she said oh
[13:22] brother branham i'm lost i'm lost and
[13:24] she stopped at the step and found
[13:25] herself in the dance hall you remember
[13:27] the story
[13:28] when that demon came out
[13:30] brother branham was even a little bit
[13:32] afraid
[13:33] well i don't know what this is he says
[13:36] i don't know anything about this
[13:38] but he he he reached back to what he did
[13:41] know
[13:42] on the basis of the word and he spoke to
[13:44] that demon
[13:45] after a while of doing that he he i
[13:48] believe
[13:49] now i could have this wrong but i know
[13:51] that there's one spot i'm thinking of
[13:53] where he wakes up and he sees the demon
[13:55] in the room and it's kind of chomping
[13:57] and he said it looks like that comic
[13:58] carry character
[14:00] and he didn't even pay it any mind
[14:02] hardly
[14:02] it's because he had seen it so much and
[14:05] he had seen god's god's power not
[14:07] brother branham's strength casting him
[14:09] out but he's seen god's strength casting
[14:12] demons out and it created a confidence
[14:14] in him that god has power and authority
[14:17] over this other dimension and i don't
[14:19] have to be afraid of it i can speak in
[14:22] jesus name and demons have to flee
[14:25] because that's what the bible says amen
[14:28] so there's this confidence that goes as
[14:30] we as we live and and we toil in in the
[14:32] everyday of our spiritual walk now if
[14:34] you watch the ones who are confident and
[14:37] successful
[14:38] and i'm talking mainly spiritually but
[14:40] we can type this naturally if you talk
[14:42] to them that it's because they're always
[14:46] giving god the glory and the credit for
[14:48] where they're at
[14:50] their confidence they have a confidence
[14:52] they have an air about them that you
[14:53] know yes i i am successful but when you
[14:56] talk to them about it they take it back
[14:59] to what the lord's done you ask ask
[15:02] sister loretta how in the world do you
[15:04] have all your kids serving the lord and
[15:07] i remember her saying it's just the
[15:09] grace of god
[15:11] it's just the grace of god
[15:13] and when they put that back it propels
[15:15] their success forward and it makes it
[15:17] somebody we look at sister loretta that
[15:20] we say that's a pillar in the church
[15:22] that's an example that's somebody we can
[15:24] go talk to now and we have conf we have
[15:27] confidence
[15:28] in in them because of what they've been
[15:31] through
[15:32] he gave them the ability he gave the
[15:35] success he gave the blessing
[15:37] and he gets all the glory
[15:41] now i've heard people put down
[15:43] christians and say they really think
[15:45] that they're somebody
[15:47] and i think that they have a
[15:48] misunderstanding myself personally
[15:51] but and just to correct that a little
[15:53] bit they don't realize that even if they
[15:55] were right
[15:56] they show that they have the same
[15:58] attitude and are just as wrong by saying
[16:01] that
[16:02] so you put yourself you lift yourself up
[16:04] and your strength trying to say that
[16:07] this person is arrogant this person is
[16:09] is you know belittling me by the way
[16:12] that they live
[16:13] and they don't realize that they take
[16:15] the same attitude and they're just as
[16:17] wrong by saying that
[16:19] they have to make you have to say that
[16:21] you have to make yourself a little bit
[16:23] better than the other person that's
[16:24] right
[16:25] and and show and it shows that you have
[16:28] the same spirit
[16:32] now the prophet um
[16:36] so
[16:37] i wanted to put this in here because i
[16:39] was thinking about
[16:41] you know the prophet gives in this in
[16:43] this message perfect strength by perfect
[16:45] weakness he gives the reason we come to
[16:46] church
[16:48] and this goes along with what what has
[16:49] just been said
[16:52] the scripture says that
[16:54] judgment begins at the house of god
[17:00] and
[17:01] some come to church to get a pat on the
[17:03] back
[17:05] and they leave disappointed
[17:08] and and you know they you know you hear
[17:10] all kinds of things people people come
[17:13] one service you know you have somebody a
[17:15] visitor come and then they leave and
[17:16] they and it's just i was expecting a
[17:19] feel-good sermon
[17:20] um
[17:21] one guy came and i said you know he's
[17:23] i'm just looking for the holy spirit i
[17:24] said well you'll find it but just know
[17:26] we don't have 15-minute sermons
[17:28] he said okay that's that's fine
[17:31] and he walked out and complained it was
[17:33] too long and i said well you had fair
[17:35] warning
[17:37] but
[17:38] they come you know people come and they
[17:40] can expect a pat on the back and things
[17:42] and leave disappointed but the prophet
[17:44] says we come to find out where our
[17:45] faults are
[17:47] the things that we might better
[17:48] ourselves by and to find our bad places
[17:52] and i thought that was interesting i
[17:54] i've i've had a service on my heart and
[17:56] i've and i've just been putting it off
[17:58] but to find our bad places balak takes
[18:01] balaam
[18:02] to curse israel and he takes balaam
[18:04] around after it didn't work the first
[18:07] time he takes balaam around and he shows
[18:09] them the the hinder parts of israel
[18:12] and brother branham said that's the
[18:14] nasty parts that's the bad parts of the
[18:16] people
[18:18] and we come to church because
[18:20] judgment begins at the house of god
[18:23] now the minister doesn't just leave us
[18:26] feeling bad about ourselves he gives us
[18:29] the answer and he lifts us up amen
[18:32] the fivefold ministry is for the
[18:34] edification of the body you know there's
[18:36] something i i just love this
[18:39] i i
[18:40] so
[18:41] there's a message that i i love going
[18:43] back and listening to from time to time
[18:46] and and it's it's a message that was
[18:48] um i overheard a brother telling uh
[18:51] actually brother paul about it in a
[18:52] minister's meeting and he said this was
[18:54] a really good message and so i thought
[18:56] man i'm going to go find this out and i
[18:57] did
[18:58] and it's i just there's so many nuggets
[19:01] in there it's from a family camp years
[19:02] ago brother harold beckett it's called
[19:04] able ministers
[19:06] and i go back and i just i love
[19:07] listening to it and i and and i haven't
[19:09] shared this much but that's actually
[19:11] where you know a lot of things leading
[19:13] up
[19:14] showing me what my calling was here in
[19:16] the local assembly and and this this
[19:18] message just kind of
[19:20] when when i heard it i thought man this
[19:22] is everything that i feel called to so
[19:25] it's just been real good for me but
[19:28] he says you know he's talking about how
[19:30] people take the notion that well we only
[19:32] need the profit we don't need to go to
[19:34] church we only need the profit and he
[19:36] says the prophet can't can't correct you
[19:40] you do that because the prophet can't
[19:42] correct you and then he says something
[19:43] he says
[19:44] malachi 4
[19:46] anoints ephesians 4.
[19:49] malachi 4 we're all familiar with
[19:51] ephesians 4 the fivefold ministry and he
[19:54] says ephesians 4 anoints revelations 4
[19:58] and revelations 4 says come up higher
[20:01] so you so that's we we come to church
[20:03] for those things we come to find out
[20:05] where where our where our our our bad
[20:08] places are because then the ministry is
[20:11] saying no no there's a better way this
[20:12] is where this is where you're wrong but
[20:14] there's a better way come up higher
[20:17] come up higher come to christ amen
[20:20] so we come to church and and
[20:24] and we
[20:25] we receive encouragement and correction
[20:27] and building up but sometimes
[20:29] sometimes in services
[20:32] we need we need some tearing down what
[20:34] we've built
[20:36] so that god can raise up a building of
[20:39] his own work
[20:40] amen
[20:44] my dad's on a job right now and pray for
[20:46] him because he's having all kinds of
[20:47] problems but this this it's a little
[20:49] cottage on a lake
[20:51] and this house has no foundation to it
[20:54] they put it they built it right on the
[20:56] ground it's got these little
[20:58] clay pillars that's holding the house up
[21:00] and so it's caused all all kinds of
[21:02] problems and the ground's unstable and
[21:04] and it's collapsed a couple times so
[21:07] you know i just it just thinking through
[21:09] this it made me it made me think of this
[21:11] job that this house was built on on no
[21:13] foundation the the men who built it no
[21:15] doubt were strong because they were
[21:17] especially because they you know they
[21:19] weren't using the nail guns and things
[21:21] they were you know hauling everything up
[21:23] two stories to put the roof on and
[21:25] hammer it by hand and stuff so these men
[21:27] were strong and they and they built this
[21:29] house and it's and it's an old house it
[21:31] stood all this time but
[21:33] at some point it started rotting
[21:35] underneath and it's just sitting on the
[21:37] ground you can't build just sitting on
[21:39] the ground it starts to rot so
[21:41] what these men thought was strong
[21:44] building in their own strength became
[21:45] weak years later
[21:48] and so you know so we need to come to
[21:50] church
[21:51] to make sure we get the right building
[21:57] and the prophet said any other objective
[21:59] for coming to church we won't get much
[22:01] out of coming
[22:03] and so i just thought about it and i was
[22:05] going to list a couple of things here
[22:06] but i left it alone
[22:07] and i just thought i'd ask you and let
[22:09] you think about it why do you come to
[22:11] church
[22:13] and i'll just leave that there
[22:16] now if anyone had bragging rights it was
[22:18] it was paul and moses
[22:22] paul and moses if anyone could brag
[22:24] throughout the bible it was paul and it
[22:26] was moses moses was
[22:28] was grew up in the in the greatest
[22:30] palace in the superpower of the world of
[22:32] that time
[22:33] the military background that he had and
[22:35] the training and the education and and
[22:37] the in the promotion that moses had if
[22:40] anyone could brag
[22:42] it was him
[22:43] when he got his call from the lord to go
[22:46] and deliver israel
[22:48] if anyone could go in their own strength
[22:51] it was moses
[22:52] but god says you know what that ain't
[22:55] gonna work
[22:56] so moses god takes moses on the backside
[22:59] of the desert for 40 years and strips
[23:01] him of everything that moses could say
[23:04] is my own strength
[23:06] and then he sends him to israel
[23:08] and it and when he sends them to israel
[23:10] he says okay now you're ready go deliver
[23:13] my people he sends them with a stick
[23:16] an old man with a stick
[23:19] coming into israel saying i'm here to
[23:21] take over
[23:23] and moses could not rely on his own
[23:26] strength at any moment in time because
[23:29] if moses would have stood up and said i
[23:31] call for flies in his own strength
[23:34] they're not there would not have been
[23:35] one fly in all of egypt
[23:38] but because moses stood up in god's
[23:40] strength relying completely on the lord
[23:43] could you imagine
[23:44] god saying go call for flies you are
[23:47] absolutely helpless within yourself
[23:51] he had to go in the power of the lord
[23:54] jesus christ and the power of god in the
[23:57] word of the hour
[23:59] now paul i want to i want to read
[24:01] through this a little bit because paul
[24:03] actually gets an opportunity to brag a
[24:05] little bit so if you want to turn to
[24:07] second corinthians 11.
[24:21] i pray this is a help to you this
[24:22] evening
[24:28] second corinthians 11 and verse 12 is
[24:30] just just the back story and and if you
[24:32] read this you know it's just it's just
[24:35] amazing
[24:36] um what i'm what i'm getting out of the
[24:38] beginning of the chapter is is the
[24:40] people
[24:43] men coming in and telling the corinthian
[24:45] church that paul's paul's
[24:48] you know
[24:50] leading wrong
[24:51] is what i got out of it but he says this
[24:54] in verse 12 but what i do
[24:56] that will
[24:57] that i will do that i may cut off
[24:59] occasion from them which desire occasion
[25:02] now this is why he's going to brag on
[25:04] himself
[25:05] that wherein they glory they may be
[25:07] found even as we
[25:10] so
[25:10] paul basically steps up to the plate and
[25:13] he says
[25:16] you want to brag
[25:17] all right
[25:19] i can see him kind of roll up his
[25:21] sleeves
[25:22] and say
[25:24] let's let's let's have a bragging
[25:26] session here for a moment
[25:30] trying to gain so these men are trying
[25:32] to gain advantage above the influence of
[25:34] paul
[25:35] and paul and paul even he's he's writing
[25:38] to the corinthian church in one spot he
[25:40] says he says you know what have your fun
[25:42] because when i when i get there we're
[25:45] going to see who has power
[25:48] but he says you know to the corinthian
[25:50] church he says if you're going to follow
[25:52] the man with the most bragging rights
[25:55] then here we go
[25:57] now verse 12 or i'm sorry
[26:00] let's see
[26:04] i think i wrote this down wrong
[26:06] ii corinthians 11 12. we read that
[26:10] verse 16.
[26:13] i say again let no man think me a fool
[26:16] so he's kind of
[26:17] prefacing this is like i really don't
[26:20] want to do this
[26:21] and i'm going to seem really foolish by
[26:23] everything else that i've said up to
[26:24] this point about bragging and such but
[26:28] nonetheless
[26:29] if otherwise yet as a fool receive me
[26:32] that i may boast myself a little
[26:34] a little wait until you hear this that
[26:36] which i speak i speak it not after the
[26:38] lord but it as it were foolishly in this
[26:42] confidence of boasting listen what i'm
[26:44] about to tell you is nothing to do with
[26:47] the lord this is strictly bragging
[26:49] rights
[26:52] i just thought this was excellent seeing
[26:54] that many glory after the flesh
[26:57] sorry i gotta laugh
[26:59] seeing that many glory after the flesh
[27:02] i'm gonna get some
[27:04] glory for ye suffer fools gladly
[27:08] seeing ye yourselves are wise
[27:10] for ye suffer if a man bring you into
[27:12] bondage if a man devour you if a man
[27:15] take of you if a man exalt himself if a
[27:17] man smite you on the face i speak as
[27:20] concerning reproach as though we had
[27:22] been weak how be it wherever any is bold
[27:26] i speak foolishly now
[27:28] i am bold also
[27:31] are they hebrews so am i are they
[27:34] israelites so am i
[27:37] are they the seed of abraham
[27:40] big deal so am i
[27:43] are they ministers of christ i speak as
[27:46] a fool now i am more of a minister
[27:50] and laborers more abundant in stripes
[27:53] above measure
[27:54] i don't know if these guys were saying
[27:56] you know look at i got some stripes on
[27:58] my back paul's saying
[28:00] you don't even know what stripes are
[28:02] buddy
[28:04] in prison more frequent
[28:08] in deaths oft of the jews five times
[28:11] received i forty stripes save one
[28:14] thrice was i beaten with rods once was i
[28:17] stoned thrice i suffered
[28:19] a shipwreck a night and a day i have
[28:22] been in the deep in journeyings often in
[28:24] perils of waters and perils of robbers
[28:27] and perils of mine own countrymen in
[28:29] perils by the heathen and perils in the
[28:31] city and perils in the wilderness in
[28:34] perils in the sea in perils among false
[28:36] brethren are you getting the picture
[28:39] and weariness and painfulness and
[28:41] watching often in hunger and thirst
[28:44] if they want to brag how much they
[28:46] fasted in fastings i've done it often
[28:49] in cold and nakedness besides those
[28:51] things that are without that which
[28:53] cometh upon me daily the care of all the
[28:55] churches
[28:57] despite everything that i have to go
[28:59] through on a daily basis i also bear the
[29:02] burden of the church
[29:05] who is weak
[29:07] and i am not weak who is offended and i
[29:10] burn not if i must needs glory i will
[29:14] glory of the things which concern my
[29:15] infirmities
[29:17] the god and father of our lord jesus
[29:19] christ which is blessed forever more
[29:22] knoweth that i lie not
[29:24] in damascus the governor under the under
[29:27] euradies the king
[29:29] kept the city of damascus with a gut
[29:32] with a garrison
[29:33] desirous to apprehend me
[29:36] this king was going to hang me if he
[29:38] could ever get his hands on me and
[29:40] through a window in a basket was i let
[29:42] down by the wall and escaped his hands
[29:45] now
[29:46] i know this is lengthy reading but i'm
[29:48] getting to another spot here
[29:50] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[29:53] glory i will come to visions and
[29:55] revelations of the lord
[29:57] so he's saying look not only do i have
[30:00] all this going behind my belt
[30:05] i will come to visions and revelations
[30:07] of the lord that you'll never come to
[30:10] yourself
[30:12] and then he says
[30:14] and i believe he's talking about himself
[30:16] here because i believe brother branham
[30:18] refers back to him he says i knew a man
[30:20] in christ
[30:22] and i'm not certain but brother branham
[30:24] says paul was caught up in the third
[30:25] heaven if i believe i have that correct
[30:27] and that's what paul goes into here a
[30:29] vision being caught up into the third
[30:31] heaven being given revelation that he
[30:33] can't even speak at this time
[30:38] of such and one verse 13 i'm sorry 12 5
[30:43] of such and one will i glory yet of
[30:45] myself i will not glory but in my
[30:48] infirmities
[30:49] for though i would desire to glory
[30:52] i shall not be a fool
[30:54] i mean paul's just ripped these guys to
[30:56] shreds and now he's you know he keeps
[30:58] saying it but now he's just going to
[30:59] call it outright
[31:00] you know they're glorying but i'm not
[31:02] going to glory in all these things
[31:04] i'm just throwing it out there
[31:07] if that's who you want to follow but
[31:09] it's foolish
[31:11] for i will say the truth but now i
[31:13] forbear lest any man should think of me
[31:15] above that which he seeth me to be or
[31:18] that he heareth of me so he just lays
[31:21] all of this out
[31:22] and he says
[31:23] now because the corinthian church he
[31:25] calls them carnal in chapter 3.
[31:28] he says now because they're so carnal
[31:30] i don't want them lifting me up because
[31:32] that's not what i'm here to do i'm here
[31:34] to lift christ up
[31:36] so he says unless i should be exalted
[31:38] above measure through the abundance of
[31:39] the revelations
[31:41] there was given to me a thorn in the
[31:43] flesh the messenger of satan to buffet
[31:45] me lest i should be exalted above
[31:47] measure for this thing i besought the
[31:50] lord thrice that it might depart from me
[31:53] and he said unto me my grace is
[31:55] sufficient for thee
[31:56] for my strength
[31:59] is made perfect in weakness
[32:03] most gladly therefore will i rather
[32:05] glory in my infirmities that the power
[32:08] of christ may rest upon me
[32:10] i don't know what you're going through
[32:11] tonight i don't know how bad your week's
[32:13] been
[32:15] but
[32:16] christ speaks to paul
[32:18] in response to his prayer
[32:21] and he says my unmerited favor nothing
[32:24] you can do in your own strength to gain
[32:26] it
[32:27] my unmerited favor is all you need amen
[32:31] amen
[32:32] and in your weakness
[32:35] in your trials in your temptations and
[32:38] in your failings
[32:40] i'm made strong
[32:43] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[32:45] and reproaches and necessities and
[32:47] persecutions and distresses for christ's
[32:49] sake for when i am weak
[32:52] then am i strong
[32:56] in
[32:57] chapter 2 of first corinthians
[33:00] paul says i came to you not in all of
[33:02] this boasting
[33:04] i never brought this up before
[33:07] but i came to you in weakness in fear
[33:11] and in much trembling
[33:13] but in here the greek diaglo words that
[33:16] says my favor is sufficient for thee for
[33:20] power
[33:21] is perfected
[33:22] in weakness
[33:25] and i just wondered thinking of this now
[33:27] brother branham said real power
[33:30] is is knowing how to overcome
[33:33] i i'm not quoting that just exactly
[33:35] right but
[33:39] most gladly then i will boast rather in
[33:41] weakness so that the power of the
[33:42] anointed may abide upon me
[33:46] so
[33:49] through
[33:50] paul coming without all this boasting
[33:53] and without the words of wisdom and
[33:55] without giving his own strengths
[33:57] then god glorified paul
[34:01] god was glorified through paul by giving
[34:03] him power and demonstration of the
[34:06] gospel
[34:08] so paul bringing his weaknesses before
[34:10] the lord paul had to go on the backside
[34:11] of the desert too and be retrained
[34:14] and then when he gets into into his
[34:16] ministry
[34:17] then he's given power and demonstration
[34:21] brother branham says and then the other
[34:23] side of this we get these feelings and
[34:25] we we think that when we're insufficient
[34:27] and we we don't want to do it but then
[34:30] if we just listen to the call of god
[34:32] that's the very thing that god wants to
[34:34] get into that kind of shape so he can
[34:37] use us
[34:38] when we are insufficient ourselves then
[34:40] we are subjects to yield to god's spirit
[34:43] i'm going to read that again when we are
[34:45] insufficient ourselves
[34:48] then we are subjects to yield to god's
[34:50] spirit
[34:51] as long as we think that we can do it
[34:53] then we can't do it but when we get to a
[34:55] place where we know we can't do it
[34:58] then we yield ourselves
[35:00] to god and he does it
[35:04] so then if it's us trying to do it we'll
[35:06] fail but if we'll just yield ourselves
[35:09] to god then god can't fail
[35:13] there's only one thing that god cannot
[35:16] do
[35:16] and that's fail he can do anything else
[35:20] but fail
[35:22] but he cannot fail
[35:26] so
[35:30] let me try to wrap up here in the next
[35:32] few minutes
[35:35] when we can recognize our weaknesses we
[35:37] can turn them over to the lord
[35:40] we recognize where we need his help
[35:45] it's not weakness
[35:47] to know your weaknesses
[35:50] and it's not weakness to tell god of
[35:52] your weaknesses
[35:53] that's right that's right
[35:55] when we recognize them we recognize we
[35:57] need his help and we surrender that area
[36:00] to him and then his power is perfected
[36:03] in that spot in our lives
[36:06] the weakness doesn't go away
[36:12] it's always there and it can poke
[36:14] through at any time
[36:16] but when his power is abiding there and
[36:18] we leave that under the power of god it
[36:21] covers that weakness over and it
[36:23] actually makes it a strength in your
[36:25] life
[36:28] and i was just thinking even our sins
[36:30] and our mistakes god wants
[36:33] to cause you to be to be strengthened
[36:35] through
[36:36] you say you know i got i got this area
[36:39] in my life i just i just can't overcome
[36:41] it i i keep i keep falling but i want so
[36:43] bad to overcome
[36:45] you know god looks at that desire
[36:47] and when he sees that desire and you
[36:49] repent he don't even see the mistake
[36:53] but if you'll if you'll keep that before
[36:55] the lord
[36:56] and keep bringing it before god
[37:01] i believe that he teaches us sometimes
[37:03] through
[37:05] i don't want to say a sin cycle and i'm
[37:07] not trying to give you
[37:08] a license to sin because i can prove you
[37:10] by the scripture that we're not supposed
[37:12] to do that
[37:13] but for lack of better words i'm going
[37:15] to say you're in the cycle of sin
[37:17] and i wonder you know it's brother
[37:19] branham said you have one punch coming
[37:21] to you the devil has one punch that he's
[37:23] allotted to you
[37:24] and if you keep getting punched in this
[37:26] one area
[37:28] you know it's sometimes i feel like lord
[37:30] you know
[37:31] fool me once you know shame on you fool
[37:33] me twice shame on me you know that's
[37:36] what it feels like but if you keep
[37:38] getting punched in this one area then
[37:40] eventually you're going to realize you
[37:42] know
[37:43] you know oh that that hurt
[37:45] you get back up and you go at it again
[37:46] and oh that hurt
[37:48] and you come back at it oh that hurts
[37:50] and you might get hit several times but
[37:52] eventually you realize oh wait a minute
[37:54] i just block like that
[37:56] and then it don't hurt
[37:58] but at any moment now remember i said
[38:00] that weakness doesn't go away at any
[38:02] moment you can get careless and you can
[38:05] come up and oh oh that hurt
[38:07] what just happened
[38:09] and you know for for christians
[38:10] oftentimes it gives it gives us a big
[38:12] setback
[38:14] because you know no christian likes to
[38:16] make a mistake
[38:18] nobody likes to make a mistake no
[38:20] especially one that you keep you keep
[38:23] seemingly giving over to but if you get
[38:25] careless and you lift up then you get
[38:28] hit
[38:28] it's going to hurt
[38:30] so then you just you what do you do a
[38:32] righteous man follows seven times but he
[38:34] gets back up again
[38:36] so you get back up again and you just
[38:38] you keep it covered if he's gonna keep
[38:40] hitting you there keep it covered i feel
[38:42] like i'm ready to fight
[38:48] and
[38:49] are you still with me a little bit
[38:50] longer i'm really having a good time
[38:53] i was reading over in the book of romans
[38:55] the fourth chapter when paul wrote the
[38:57] divine commentary of life of abraham now
[39:00] we know that abraham many times got kind
[39:02] of frustrated like we do
[39:04] but when his commentary was written
[39:05] there wasn't any of his flusterations
[39:07] mentioned you see never mention them at
[39:09] all said abraham staggered not at the
[39:11] promise of god through unbelief but was
[39:13] strong giving praise to god
[39:15] he says this
[39:16] see
[39:17] and that's the way i hope mine will be
[39:19] wrote up there
[39:21] is not my mistakes and everything but
[39:23] just what i try to do
[39:25] the intention of my heart to do for
[39:27] god's people
[39:29] the intention of the heart is what god
[39:31] looks at
[39:35] let me just skip some of this here
[39:41] something that the lord showed me when
[39:43] when brother paul was going through the
[39:44] greatest battle ever fought and i and i
[39:46] started listening to it again
[39:48] brother branham makes the comment and he
[39:50] says you can't even sin until you lay
[39:53] god's word down
[39:55] you see sometimes we lose strength when
[39:57] we lay it down
[39:59] often times of our own choosing right
[40:01] james says of your own lust
[40:03] okay
[40:05] but
[40:07] if we hold that weapon and we hold tight
[40:09] to the word of god and we stay in the
[40:11] word of god and no matter what we
[40:13] we prioritize the word of god and prayer
[40:17] then you hold on to the word of god it's
[40:20] it's your strength it's it's the very
[40:22] strength in your time of weakness so
[40:24] don't lay down your sword amen
[40:29] so just real quick in closing here
[40:34] our weaknesses and god uses those
[40:36] weaknesses for his strength and then in
[40:39] hebrews 11 it mentioned gideon
[40:41] and if you think about gideon when the
[40:44] lord when the angel of the lord came to
[40:45] gideon he was hiding
[40:49] so when when paul's writing in hebrews
[40:52] this this commentary and he says he says
[40:56] you know through weakness they were made
[40:58] strong you know they're doing all these
[41:00] great things and he's naming them
[41:01] subverting the enemy driving the enemy
[41:04] back and then when you look at their
[41:05] lives you realize that there was no
[41:08] nothing to them that's right
[41:10] they they had no backbone
[41:12] so gideon i was thinking you know he was
[41:14] he was hiding he had all these excuses
[41:16] and then he didn't even go out on the
[41:18] word of the lord
[41:21] him
[41:22] probably being jew needed a sign
[41:25] and asked not just for one sign but two
[41:27] signs
[41:30] and you so you see this weak and this
[41:32] gideon weakened faith and yet god uses
[41:35] them and he's written in the heap in
[41:36] hebrews
[41:38] barack i i refreshed myself before
[41:40] service on barack and and
[41:44] again you can say so much on the subject
[41:46] but barack
[41:48] i believe it was deborah comes to him
[41:50] and she says you know prophetess and she
[41:52] says go up and and you're going to win
[41:54] and you're going to fight and and you're
[41:56] going to you know you're going to
[41:57] you're going to take it and you're going
[41:59] to be used of god
[42:01] and then barack
[42:04] being the man that he was said
[42:07] i'll go if you come with me
[42:09] but if you don't come with me i ain't
[42:11] going
[42:14] and i just thought what a weak
[42:16] backbone this guy had you know let
[42:19] can i say it let the wife lead the home
[42:21] if you lead i'll follow
[42:26] if you lead then i'll follow and she
[42:28] says you know what because you took that
[42:30] approach you're not going to get any
[42:31] glory here
[42:33] and then and the king that he was after
[42:35] that he was prophesied to take was
[42:37] actually killed by a woman
[42:40] she invited him in and then put a spike
[42:42] through his head
[42:44] and it was all because you know i was
[42:47] just kind of a little funny thing i
[42:49] thought you know
[42:50] barack couldn't grow a beard so he
[42:52] became weak
[42:55] beard had nothing to do with it but
[42:58] but brother branham says you know if you
[43:00] get the wishbone out of you and get a
[43:02] backbone and stop letting your wife wear
[43:04] those things or do those things then he
[43:06] said you know get a backbone about you
[43:08] and lead your home
[43:10] barack should have been leading not only
[43:12] his home but the children of israel in
[43:14] the battle and and judged them and
[43:17] and been a leader used of god
[43:19] but he relied on a woman to lead
[43:25] what strength is in that
[43:28] none of his own
[43:29] but yet
[43:30] he's in the hebrews
[43:34] samson i said we know samson brother
[43:36] branham said he he gave he gave god his
[43:38] strength but he gave delilah his heart
[43:41] right
[43:42] no glory whatsoever
[43:44] you could you could look at samson and
[43:46] you know ruddy ruddy little thing you
[43:48] know curly locks and just a little
[43:51] boy but yeah when the when the glory of
[43:53] god came on him he could he could take
[43:55] out a whole army with a with a
[43:59] dried up
[44:00] mule jawbone
[44:02] and you'd look at him and you'd say what
[44:04] strength and what power
[44:06] but yet
[44:07] god couldn't use any of it because
[44:11] he didn't give it to he didn't give his
[44:13] heart to god
[44:14] i mean god god did use it you understand
[44:16] but it wasn't to the full extent so how
[44:19] does he end up we look at him and he
[44:22] loses his strength and he's he's blind
[44:24] in the end of his life he he dies with
[44:26] the with the enemy
[44:28] what glory is in that
[44:30] and yet he's in the hebrews
[44:35] we could talk about david all night
[44:38] but i i thought a lot about david
[44:42] and lately about you know being a
[44:44] rejected king
[44:46] and and walking and that man spitting on
[44:48] him and making fun of him and calling
[44:50] him names and
[44:52] and david you know in in his weak
[44:54] moments
[44:55] you know
[44:56] led of the spirit of god he said no god
[44:58] told him to do that
[45:00] let him go god being led of the spirit
[45:03] but david we look at him fallen
[45:07] with bathsheba
[45:08] committed murder
[45:10] and we say
[45:12] what kind of man is this look at all of
[45:14] his weaknesses
[45:16] and yet
[45:17] and yet god said he's a man after my own
[45:19] heart
[45:21] these are paradoxes i believe
[45:23] that god would take our weaknesses
[45:26] and make them strengths you can stand to
[45:28] your feet as i try to just close this
[45:30] now
[45:35] what i what i really
[45:38] the message that i really wanted to get
[45:40] to you tonight
[45:44] is really david
[45:47] sums it up in the psalms
[45:51] you can bring
[45:53] you know a horse in the scripture as is
[45:55] power it's it's it's it's an authority
[45:58] on the battlefield and you know he says
[46:00] don't even you know a horse is a vain
[46:02] thing for safety well you get on a horse
[46:05] and you you hightail it out on that
[46:07] horse to safety
[46:09] and you think you're safe but god said
[46:11] that's that's nothing
[46:14] and oftentimes what i'm what i'm trying
[46:16] to say at the end of this to conclude it
[46:18] is
[46:19] we look at ourselves and we feel so weak
[46:21] so many times
[46:23] and we feel we feel we we see the
[46:27] we see the anxieties that we have in our
[46:30] daily in our daily living and we
[46:32] we see maybe the the mistake that you
[46:34] keep making and and
[46:36] we look at our weaknesses
[46:39] and you know as as christians i think
[46:41] oftentimes
[46:43] you know you don't even you can't even
[46:46] get the strength to come to the lord
[46:48] because
[46:49] lord look at all my weaknesses
[46:52] but yet
[46:54] what god said through the word tonight
[46:57] was bring your weaknesses to me
[47:00] and i'll give you strength
[47:03] bring bring your ashes
[47:06] and i'll give you beauty
[47:09] so no matter what you feel about
[47:11] yourself tonight
[47:13] god's eyes in psalms 33 maybe i'll just
[47:16] read that again to close blessed is the
[47:17] nation whose god is the lord and the
[47:20] people
[47:21] who he hath chosen for his own
[47:22] inheritance
[47:24] the lord looketh from heaven he
[47:26] beholdeth all the sons of men
[47:28] nothing you cannot hide from god
[47:31] he sees everything you do
[47:33] from the place of his habitation he
[47:35] looketh upon all the inhabitants of the
[47:37] earth
[47:38] he fashioneth their hearts alike
[47:41] he considereth all their works
[47:43] there is no king saved by the multitude
[47:45] of and host a mighty man is not
[47:48] delivered by much strength
[47:50] a horse is a vain thing for safety
[47:53] neither shall he deliver any by his
[47:55] great strength
[47:56] behold the eye of the lord is upon them
[47:58] that fear him
[48:00] and upon them that hope and his mercy
[48:04] to deliver their soul from death
[48:06] and to keep them alive and famine
[48:09] you might feel weak tonight
[48:11] but if you bring reverence before the
[48:14] lord
[48:15] you say lord i don't i don't want
[48:18] to do wrong and i don't mean to do wrong
[48:20] and and
[48:22] lord i just i have no strength of my own
[48:24] it's that's coming to the lord and fear
[48:26] and and then trembling and
[48:28] not lord i i'm no good in myself
[48:34] and yet
[48:35] he says the eye of the lord is upon that
[48:37] person
[48:39] he'll give mercy to that person
[48:42] he delivers the soul out of death
[48:44] one day soon i believe very soon we're
[48:47] going to wake up in glory
[48:50] and then you'll have strength
[48:52] like you've never had before
[48:55] the lord is our help
[48:58] and our shield
[49:00] for our heart shall rejoice in him
[49:02] because we have trusted in his holy name
[49:05] let thy mercy o lord be upon us
[49:08] according as we hope in thee
[49:12] if you just want to bow your hearts and
[49:13] prayer a moment and we'll
[49:16] we'll change the service and worship for
[49:18] a little bit
[49:21] and you just want to be remembered in
[49:23] prayer just lift your hand before the
[49:25] lord
[49:27] heavenly father we come before you
[49:29] tonight lord and
[49:31] lord maybe in a
[49:34] chopped up not elegant way father but
[49:37] i pray that your heart lord what what
[49:39] you really had lying in my heart behind
[49:41] this lord would get through to the
[49:43] people was
[49:45] first we have to strip ourselves of
[49:48] of human ability thinking
[49:51] just realize that we have no strength
[49:54] within ourselves that
[49:56] our very best is as filthy rags
[50:00] but yet for the people to realize
[50:04] that in all of that
[50:06] you offered a trade
[50:10] and it's lord to us it wouldn't be a
[50:12] fair trade but lord how
[50:16] how grateful we are father that you
[50:18] would trade all these things
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] and be our strength
[50:26] father i pray that if anyone feels weak
[50:28] in themselves tonight god that you would
[50:30] help them to look up
[50:33] and to see father that you're looking
[50:35] down and you're offering a strong hand
[50:40] help us lord i pray if if there's pride
[50:42] or arrogance in any one of us i pray
[50:45] that you would deliver us god
[50:48] give us humility lord but
[50:51] give us that confidence father
[50:54] that we can come to you because
[50:58] of what you did for us

[51:03] the people tonight and encourage them
