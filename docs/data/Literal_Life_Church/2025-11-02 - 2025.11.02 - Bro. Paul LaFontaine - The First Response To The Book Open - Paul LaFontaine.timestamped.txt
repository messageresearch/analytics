[36:32] Amen. We're going to sing this song. Uh
[36:34] chain breaker. Do you know he's a chain
[36:36] breaker this morning? How many can
[36:38] testify that in your life sometime could
[36:40] be today itself that the Lord broke the
[36:43] chains of bondage and he brought you
[36:45] into a freedom. Hallelujah. We want to
[36:47] sing this with all we got this morning
[36:49] and you guys don't if you guys know the
[36:52] song sing it with us this morning. We
[36:54] love it's just for worship. So sing it
[36:56] with us.
[37:21] If you've been walking the same old road
[37:24] for miles and miles.
[37:27] If you've been hearing the same old
[37:29] voice, tell the same old lies.
[37:33] If you're trying to fill the same old
[37:36] holes inside, let me tell you, there's a
[37:39] better life.
[37:41] Oh, there's a better life.
[37:45] If you got pain,
[37:47] he's a pain taker. Oh yes. If you feel
[37:51] lost,
[37:53] he's a way maker. Yes, Lord. If you need
[37:57] freedom or save him, he's a prison
[38:01] shaking savior. If you got chains,
[38:05] he's a chain breaker. Oh yes, Lord. Oh,
[38:11] and we've all searched for the light of
[38:14] the day in the dead of night.
[38:17] Oh, and we've all found ourselves worn
[38:20] out from the same old fight. Oh, yes.
[38:23] And we've all run the things we know
[38:26] just ain't right. But we know there's a
[38:29] better life.
[38:32] Oh, there's a better life.
[38:35] If you got pain,
[38:38] he's a pain.
[38:40] Oh, he lost.
[38:44] He's a way maker.
[38:46] Oh, fre.
[38:50] He's a prison shaking sify
[39:04] this morning.
[39:07] He's a way maker.
[39:10] Oh, freaking
[39:16] savior. Do not change.
[39:19] He's a chain breaker.
[39:22] Oh,
[39:24] now listen now. Oh, if you believe it,
[39:29] you got to believe it. You receive it.
[39:33] Oh, if you can feel it, somebody
[39:35] testify. Can you testify? Oh, if you
[39:39] believe it. Oh, if you receive it,
[39:45] you can feel it. Somebody testify.
[39:51] If you believe it,
[39:54] if you receive it,
[39:57] if you can feel it, somebody's
[40:16] a pain.
[40:18] Oh,
[40:22] he's
[40:26] freaking
[40:30] s
[40:40] pain taker. Oh, he could be lost.
[40:45] He's a rain maker.
[40:48] Oh, freaking
[40:54] savior.
[41:05] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[41:15] He's a
[41:17] sing.
[41:33] He's a chain breaker.
[41:38] He's my chain.
[41:40] Yes, Lord. Yes. Hallelujah.
[41:44] Oh Jesus.
[41:54] He's amazing.
[42:07] Heat. Heat.
[42:18] He's a pain.
[42:24] He's a way maker. Yeah.
[42:28] Freedom
[42:41] Satord.
[42:59] Hallelujah.
[43:01] Yes, you are Lord. Glory. A mighty
[43:03] conqueror stands in the gap for you this
[43:05] morning. Yeah. Hallelujah. Glory. Thank
[43:08] you, God.
[43:11] Oh, let's give the Lord another hand
[43:12] clap of praise. I pray.
[43:18] Hallelujah.
[43:20] It's more than a song. It should be more
[43:22] than a song to you. Can you say amen?
[43:24] The reason you can sing it and worship
[43:26] with it is because you know that it's
[43:28] true and it's been true in your life.
[43:30] How many's had chains broken in your
[43:32] life before? How many's had pain and he
[43:35] took the pain for you? Hallelujah. It's
[43:38] more than a song. It's more than just a
[43:40] form, but it's a life. Can you say amen?
[43:42] It's a worship. Praise the Lord. Oh, if
[43:45] you got pain,
[43:48] he's a painting. You sing it now. If you
[43:51] feel lost,
[43:54] he's a way. Yeah.
[43:57] If you need freedom and saving, he's a
[44:01] prison shaking savior. If you got chain,
[44:06] he's a chain. Sing it one more time. If
[44:09] you got pain.
[44:12] Yeah.
[44:14] Oh, if you feel lost.
[44:20] Well,
[44:23] save it. He's a prison shaking savior.
[44:30] He's a chain breaker. Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:34] We believe it with all of our heart.
[44:36] Thank you, Lord.
[44:39] Blessed be his name. Praise be to God.
[44:41] We believe it with all of our hearts.
[44:44] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. I
[44:47] enjoy singing that song. A few months
[44:49] ago at the night of worship, uh I did
[44:50] the soloist for it. So, I don't know how
[44:52] I got knocked out of it. My uh I was
[44:55] singing it with him. It was uh my son
[44:57] took my place there. I don't know what
[44:58] happened. I got demoted.
[45:01] I was I must not have sang good enough
[45:02] or something.
[45:04] It sounds, you know, Gideon. Um, I used
[45:07] to be my wife's favorite singer
[45:10] until Gideon came along. I used to get
[45:13] invited to all the weddings to sing and
[45:14] now Gideon gets invited.
[45:17] It's humbling. It really is. So, my
[45:18] subject is humility today.
[45:22] It really is humility. 2 Kings chapter
[45:25] 22 and verse 8. And Hilkaya the high
[45:30] priest said unto Shaan the scribe, I
[45:33] have found the book of the law in the
[45:35] house of the Lord. And Hilkaya gave the
[45:38] book to Chaan, and he read it. And Chaan
[45:42] uh the scribe came to the king Josiah
[45:45] and brought the king word again and
[45:46] said, "Thy servants have gathered the
[45:48] money that was in the house, and have
[45:50] delivered it into the hand of them to do
[45:52] the work that have the oversight of the
[45:55] house of God." And Chaan the scribe
[45:57] showed the king saying, "Hica the priest
[46:00] hath delivered me a book and Chaan read
[46:04] it before the king." So I just want you
[46:08] to notice here this passing of the book.
[46:10] Um Hilkaya finds it somewhere in the
[46:13] temple because the temple was so far
[46:15] away from God. They didn't even have a
[46:16] regard for the book. They found it under
[46:19] dust and somewhere. And so Hilkaya finds
[46:22] it. Then he hands it to Chaan, the
[46:25] scribe, and then Chaen takes it to the
[46:28] king. And so this passing of the book is
[46:31] kind of in Revelations 10 where we'll
[46:33] read in a minute where um our lamb comes
[46:36] and takes the book from him who's
[46:38] sitting on the throne. And and then he
[46:41] takes it and I think the way the prophet
[46:43] worded it said he takes this and he
[46:45] throws it to his prophet that's on
[46:47] earth, the seventh angel. And then that
[46:49] wasn't the last passing. Then John, a
[46:52] type of the bride, he actually went and
[46:54] asked and took the book and he ate of
[46:56] it. So there's just this there's this
[46:58] passing of this book.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But here's the response
[47:02] from it. Chaan read it before the king
[47:04] and it came to pass when the king had
[47:07] heard the words of the book of the law
[47:10] that he rent his clothes.
[47:14] First, I want to title this this
[47:16] morning. The first response to the book
[47:19] opened.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] Revelations chapter 5.
[47:31] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[47:33] on the throne a book written and on the
[47:35] backside sealed with seven seals. And I
[47:38] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[47:40] loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the
[47:43] book and to loose the seals thereof?"
[47:45] And no man in heaven nor in earth,
[47:48] neither under the earth was able to open
[47:50] the book, neither to look therein. The
[47:53] first theme with this book, the first
[47:55] theme is to to make it clear that there
[48:00] is no one worthy
[48:03] &gt;&gt; except our Lord.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; I don't care how good man is. I don't
[48:09] care what he's accomplished.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; We are still unworthy.
[48:15] to take it, to look at it, to be
[48:17] benefited by it,
[48:18] &gt;&gt; we are completely unworthy.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; And I I I honestly think that we don't
[48:23] approach this right unless we come to
[48:26] that. That this is not something you can
[48:28] bring any of your good
[48:31] &gt;&gt; anything that we have done. We can't
[48:33] contribute. We can't add it to our
[48:35] resume.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to get across. We are on
[48:39] all unworthy. Brother B. All the heroes
[48:41] of the B of the Bible are unworthy. You
[48:44] take your best and greatest that you see
[48:46] in this life when it comes to this. We
[48:49] are all unworthy and we're undeserving
[48:51] of it.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the only approach.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You know, when you need to be saved, the
[48:57] first approach, you have to know you're
[48:59] a sinner.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; You have to know you're unacceptable to
[49:04] God. you're born in sin and and there's
[49:06] nothing that you can do to correct it or
[49:09] you have to know that and then you're a
[49:10] candidate to really truly be saved.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; You can't be saved until you know you're
[49:15] lost.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; And John says, "I wept much because no
[49:22] man was found worthy to open and to read
[49:24] the book, neither to look there. And one
[49:25] of the elders saith unto me, weep not.
[49:27] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[49:29] the root of David, hath prevailed to
[49:32] open the book, and to loose the seals
[49:33] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[49:36] midst of the throne, and of the four
[49:38] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[49:40] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[49:41] having seven horns, and seven eyes,
[49:43] which are the seven spirits of God, sent
[49:45] forth into all the earth. And he came
[49:48] and took the book out of the right hand
[49:49] of him that sat upon the throne. And
[49:51] when he had taken the book, the four
[49:55] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[49:59] before the lamb, having every one of
[50:01] them harps and golden vials full of
[50:04] alders, which are the prayers of the
[50:07] saints. The first response to all of the
[50:09] elders when he took the book as they
[50:12] fell down,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; they bowed.
[50:16] Father, bless your word today. We sense
[50:18] you present with us.
[50:21] And Lord, you're
[50:24] you're the one, Father,
[50:26] if we focus on you.
[50:29] You're the one, Lord, who brings
[50:33] everything that we need.
[50:35] And we're aware of your presence here
[50:37] this morning.
[50:39] We are we just seek to worship you.
[50:43] We seek to lift you up, Lord.
[50:47] And I pray, Father, you take these
[50:49] precious lives that's here, the
[50:52] families, the children, the young
[50:54] people, the older ones. I pray you'll
[50:58] take them once again into your your
[51:00] hand. Those that are listening online,
[51:03] take us all in your hand and form us and
[51:06] fashion us and make us what you desire
[51:09] us to be and what you want to get out of
[51:12] our lives. Grant that, Father. Lord,
[51:16] victories come when you're present.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we know that you're here.
[51:22] Come, Father. Feel welcome among us. And
[51:25] we just pray that the word would enrich
[51:28] us and change us and fill us, Lord. And
[51:31] we we are so thankful that we have this
[51:33] whole day that we can dedicate to you.
[51:35] And we can have the Lord's supper
[51:37] together as you asked us to do, Lord,
[51:39] many years ago. We're thankful to have
[51:41] this time of fellowship, but Lord, at
[51:43] this moment, we pray that your word
[51:45] would prevail, that your word would have
[51:47] preeminence. And Lord, it would speak
[51:50] those things that are needed in our
[51:52] lives. We thank you, Father, in Jesus
[51:55] name. Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; God bless. You may be seated.
[52:06] The Lord certainly put a shadow or a
[52:08] type here, a wonderful shadow and type
[52:10] in the Old Testament of Josiah. Um, it's
[52:14] a type of the incredible day that we
[52:18] have come to that he opens the book of
[52:20] redemption to his elect. And I do
[52:23] believe that we have a shadow here in
[52:25] Josiah's life of the book opening to
[52:27] him. him not only hearing the book that
[52:30] had been lost, but it's also it was
[52:33] opened by the scribe to him. And then we
[52:37] know that there was something powerful
[52:38] going on because we can read the the
[52:42] response from Josiah of this book being
[52:46] open to him. Matter of fact, I could
[52:47] safely say that many people had read the
[52:50] book before. But his response um speaks
[52:54] of a revelation of something happening
[52:56] in Josiah as he heard the words of these
[53:00] book this book. It it was it was it was
[53:03] above and beyond. His response was above
[53:06] and beyond. And so we can say that
[53:08] there's something in the book and the
[53:10] book being open to us that that can have
[53:13] an effect on us that can be above just
[53:16] you trying to do good.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; You trying to do good is is nice but
[53:22] it's it's it has to go deeper than us
[53:24] just trying to do good. Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; And as we spoke about last Sunday, uh it
[53:29] goes so deep as even our sacrifices that
[53:32] we make sacrifices and and the these
[53:35] things God says, "Thou uh thou desireest
[53:37] not." But he says, "Lo, in the volume of
[53:40] the book is written of me to do these
[53:42] things." So something deeper than
[53:43] sacrifices and living a good Christian
[53:46] life. That's all fine, but there has to
[53:48] be something deeper. And so this type of
[53:51] Josiah speaks of our day. It speaks of a
[53:53] special time. um it never can be
[53:56] compared with what was before and that's
[53:58] out of a respect for what God did for
[54:00] 2,000 church a 2,000 years of church
[54:03] ages because as much as God dealt with
[54:06] his people in every generation God came
[54:08] down God had an angel to every church
[54:10] age God dealt with the people through
[54:12] that angel and also he dealt with them
[54:15] personally because as much as God did
[54:18] though as much as God did and dealt with
[54:19] his people for all these ages this book
[54:22] was still sealed all of those ages, this
[54:25] book was still sealed by seven seals.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; And and so Jeremiah speaks of a book and
[54:31] he said to seal it up until the time.
[54:34] Daniel speaks of this book and says it's
[54:36] to be sealed until the end time. And
[54:39] even John in the book of Revelations who
[54:42] actually got to look inside of it and
[54:45] when he looked inside of it then he then
[54:47] he was told uh I know you're excited
[54:50] about proclaiming some of these things
[54:51] but it's not time yet. it's not time to
[54:54] proclaim it. And he actually is told
[54:56] seal it up until the end time. And so we
[54:59] know that this this book was held till
[55:02] the end time. The unsealing of this this
[55:05] revelation and what was in here uh in
[55:07] the book of redemption was sealed up.
[55:09] And so I'll say it again. Uh it was
[55:12] sealed up until the day the days of the
[55:14] voice of the seventh angel. That's he
[55:16] gave us the time frame. It was sealed
[55:18] until the days of the voice of the
[55:20] seventh angel. And that's when this will
[55:22] begin to open. Uh when it and when it
[55:24] opens, it'll be a different time. With
[55:26] all that God has done before, he will
[55:29] show he can do things that he's never
[55:32] that he's done before, he shows he can
[55:34] do it again. How many believe this
[55:36] morning that we through this message
[55:38] even have been convinced that whatever
[55:40] God did before, he can do it again. He
[55:43] has proved that in the last days. This
[55:46] message has proved that. Don't you dare
[55:48] say that God cannot do it again cuz he
[55:51] has proved whatever he did 2,000 years
[55:53] ago, he has done it again and he can do
[55:56] it again this morning.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; He is well able to do whatever. It's
[56:01] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[56:04] and forever. And no denomination and no
[56:06] person has a right to put a restraint on
[56:09] that. The message set that free and says
[56:12] God that was God back then is God today
[56:15] again.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so God has proved that.
[56:18] And but you see now with all that God
[56:20] has done and he shows he will do it
[56:23] again. But somehow it must be something
[56:26] even deeper than that cuz when we get to
[56:28] the time of the breaking of these seals
[56:30] and the handing of this book and the
[56:32] book of redemption and our names in the
[56:34] book, so many of you have been taught so
[56:36] well, whatever church you attend or here
[56:38] uh the meaning to this and what it means
[56:40] to us. Uh and and so but you see and we
[56:44] see it's open to us but more than ever
[56:46] before we we see that God is taking us
[56:49] deeper because of this because he held
[56:52] it until the end time. So I'm just
[56:54] saying that if he held it to the end
[56:56] time that with all God has done and all
[56:59] God is doing there must be something
[57:01] related to us that God would want to do
[57:05] as we see our name in this book.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's a quite a time
[57:11] to live in, young people. That's quite a
[57:13] day to live in.
[57:16] A real big revelation to me is to see
[57:18] the results the results of this book
[57:21] being open to sons and daughters of God.
[57:23] Josiah's response in the scripture is a
[57:27] window into his response. And as I said,
[57:29] I want to speak about the first response
[57:31] to the book being open. One thing that
[57:34] we do know uh about the book being open
[57:36] is there seems to be when it's open and
[57:39] I think there's been more sermons about
[57:40] this than what I'm going to preach on
[57:42] this morning but there seems to be after
[57:44] the opening of this book uh worship and
[57:47] joy uh worship and joy reaches a whole
[57:51] uh a whole a higher level
[57:53] &gt;&gt; and we see that in Revelations 5
[57:56] &gt;&gt; because we see worship uh in Revelations
[58:00] 1 they worship because thou art the
[58:02] creator they worship worship because of
[58:03] creation. But the worship goes deeper
[58:06] deeper with this book being revealed.
[58:08] It's not just a worship because he's the
[58:10] creator, but it's a worship because he's
[58:12] the redeemer.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And no angels can worship that way.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; So something in that book brought the
[58:20] worship even greater,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; even louder.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; When the elders and all them begin to
[58:27] worship, they they cried with a loud
[58:30] voice.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Hallelujah. This was no formal
[58:33] setting. This was a loud voice that said
[58:36] he said they said amen and amen and thou
[58:39] art worthy to loose these seals. And now
[58:41] then John says John gets excited because
[58:44] the prophet said he he seen his name in
[58:47] there. He seen his position. He's seen
[58:49] his part in that. And he says everything
[58:52] under the ground, everything in earth
[58:53] and heaven heard me crying worthy is the
[58:56] lamb.
[58:58] Thou art worthy to receive glory and
[59:00] honor and power. So the the the level of
[59:04] worship increased after this was seen to
[59:07] them.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; So we know that and it wasn't a formal
[59:13] response. It was a very loud response.
[59:16] It was a very worshipful. It was joy
[59:19] that had set in. Oh my friends, don't
[59:22] don't get your joy from the things of
[59:24] the world or some some guys, you know, I
[59:28] like football, but listen, there is no
[59:30] joy them kicking a football, winning or
[59:33] losing. There's no joy in that compared
[59:35] to looking inside this book and seeing
[59:37] what God has done for you.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever depend on a joy like
[59:42] that. Something of the world, some new
[59:44] style, some new truck. There's no joy
[59:46] that compares with seeing your name in
[59:48] the book. Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; The worship increased
[59:52] &gt;&gt; and and John and and and and and uh
[59:56] Josiah even when we we go back, you
[59:58] know, Josiah, I said it last Sunday,
[1:00:01] going back to it, he seen his name in
[1:00:03] the book, he actually was hearing it and
[1:00:05] he heard his actual name from 300 years
[1:00:08] before. He heard Josiah and the priest
[1:00:11] was while he was reading it, it said
[1:00:13] there will be a young man Josiah and
[1:00:15] he'll do this, that, and the other. That
[1:00:17] was 300 years before. And Josiah
[1:00:19] actually stops him and says, "Wait a
[1:00:21] minute. Say that again. Read that
[1:00:23] again." He says, "And Josiah," this is
[1:00:25] 300 years before. "And Josiah shall pick
[1:00:27] up and have a revival in his land.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; He said my name."
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; He speaks of me here.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Talk about getting excited.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Josiah is saying, "I'm not making this
[1:00:41] up. I'm not trying going along trying to
[1:00:43] do this myself.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up." And guess what?
[1:00:47] God's not making it up as he goes along
[1:00:49] either.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world,
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; before the world was created,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; he wrote of me.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He spoke of me.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's exciting.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; That's exciting. God's not making it up
[1:01:05] as he goes along. Lo, and the book is
[1:01:07] written of me.
[1:01:09] But today I'll just pull a little
[1:01:11] something different because I assume
[1:01:12] that a lot of the sermons about it. Uh
[1:01:15] depending on what group you're around,
[1:01:17] there'd be a lot of service about when
[1:01:19] the book was opened and you know there
[1:01:21] was great worship and I believe in that
[1:01:24] because I've seen it in my life. I've
[1:01:25] seen seen what what this can do. But I
[1:01:29] want to go back to this first response.
[1:01:33] When he took the book and opened it,
[1:01:36] they bowed.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; The first response was not worship. The
[1:01:47] first response is they bowed.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And if you know your Bible, this speaks
[1:01:54] of humility.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; This speaks of being broken by it.
[1:02:00] This speaks of being grateful for it.
[1:02:03] This speaks of feeling unworthy of it.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; The first response
[1:02:10] is not something that becomes
[1:02:13] just worship or even just an
[1:02:15] intellectual
[1:02:17] dominance
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; that we would have over the next person.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt on. I'm going to
[1:02:24] preach this morning.
[1:02:26] Come on.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; The response was not some type of
[1:02:29] intellectual dominance that I'm better
[1:02:32] than the next person now.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; That I'm in a higher category now.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I'd say that we are in a higher category
[1:02:41] because when you see your name in the
[1:02:42] book, you realize it's the lamb's book
[1:02:44] of life
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; written in there before the foundation.
[1:02:47] I was a thought of God. It wasn't that
[1:02:49] just God thought of me. I was his
[1:02:51] thoughts.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It wasn't he was going to, oh,
[1:02:55] and I thought of I thought of Joe's
[1:02:57] friend. No, you were part of his
[1:02:58] thoughts. You were in his thoughts.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; He created everything and the world
[1:03:03] based around thoughts of his bride.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. Hallelujah.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; But you know the responses that we've
[1:03:16] had I I'm uncomfortable with sometimes
[1:03:18] some of our pockets within our with our
[1:03:21] when within our group not this church
[1:03:23] but you know just other places and maybe
[1:03:25] even individually you can apply that
[1:03:27] because the first response was not uh
[1:03:30] anything but just they bowed and bowing
[1:03:32] speaks of humility.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; When we're coming in touch with this
[1:03:36] revelation it should it we should be
[1:03:39] humbled by it.
[1:03:41] and not the other way. The other way is
[1:03:43] pride.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; It's a real deep grateful feeling that
[1:03:50] reaches back towards God, it bows. It
[1:03:53] you know when when you have that it's
[1:03:55] like when you feel I it's been said one
[1:03:57] time by a singer years ago said if he if
[1:04:01] he really came in to this room with all
[1:04:04] with all the the his glory and this is
[1:04:07] their their way of expressing it. But
[1:04:09] I've it's always touched me that if he
[1:04:11] really came into this room this morning,
[1:04:13] would we even want to speak? Would we
[1:04:15] want to say something? We'd probably be
[1:04:17] be all on the ground recognizing that
[1:04:20] he's here in a special way.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the presence of the Lord
[1:04:23] does. It doesn't make us more proudful.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make us more we've got the
[1:04:29] edge on everybody else.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make us gloat because the
[1:04:32] enemy is subject to us.
[1:04:35] Does any of you know that we're not
[1:04:37] supposed to worship because the devils
[1:04:38] are subject to us?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus taught us and taught his disciples
[1:04:46] when they come back rejoicing because
[1:04:48] the devils were subject.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; No, don't worship because the devils are
[1:04:53] subject.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Worship, rejoice, have joy because your
[1:04:58] names are written in the book of life.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That should be the purpose of our
[1:05:02] worship. That should be the exuberance
[1:05:05] of our worship. We ought to raise our
[1:05:07] hands. We ought to shout. We ought to
[1:05:09] cry. Can you say amen? Not because we
[1:05:12] have power, but because
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; our names are written in the lamb's book
[1:05:17] of life.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; It should be the purpose of our worship.
[1:05:24] Should be the motive. The mode of our
[1:05:27] worship. It's not I'm a son of God and I
[1:05:30] have power to zap the devils. We do have
[1:05:32] power over enemies, but that's not the
[1:05:34] reason we rejoice.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; How many meetings did people go out of?
[1:05:39] Oh, we had a meeting. The devils were
[1:05:41] going everywhere and there was tongues
[1:05:42] and interpretation and all kinds of We
[1:05:44] had a meeting. Praise the Lord. Praise
[1:05:46] the Lord. But don't forget the motive
[1:05:49] for worship is that somebody in that
[1:05:52] audience needed to catch their name in
[1:05:54] the book of life to be saved, to be full
[1:05:57] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:00] And if they don't get that, the worship
[1:06:02] doesn't have much value to it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; You come in touch with something that
[1:06:16] says, you know, I'm so deeply grateful
[1:06:20] back to my God.
[1:06:23] It's saying, I didn't do anything to
[1:06:25] earn this.
[1:06:28] I can't take any credit for it.
[1:06:31] I had no part of it whatsoever.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged to look and
[1:06:36] see.
[1:06:38] My eyes, this is the humility. My eyes
[1:06:41] have been privileged
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; to see what's in the book of life.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's the right response.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged to look and
[1:06:52] see. You know, didn't he say many
[1:06:54] prophets and sages
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; would have loved to look and see the
[1:06:58] things
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; that you see
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; and we take it for granted and we lose
[1:07:05] our humility and the the touch and the
[1:07:07] feeling.
[1:07:09] We shouldn't lose that.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; We should never lose the awe of it. We
[1:07:13] should never lose the feeling of feeling
[1:07:15] privileged that our eyes get to see
[1:07:17] this.
[1:07:22] Wonder how David would act. I've said it
[1:07:24] before.
[1:07:25] Wonder how David would act in the
[1:07:28] service this morning.
[1:07:31] You know, never mind the preaching, just
[1:07:33] the choir song and sister Paul and the
[1:07:35] other brother. And you know, before the
[1:07:38] cross, before the blood, before the Holy
[1:07:40] Ghost, David said, "I was glad when they
[1:07:43] said unto me, let's go to the house of
[1:07:45] the Lord."
[1:07:47] and he didn't have nothing in church
[1:07:49] like you had it this morning. And you
[1:07:50] said, "I'm glad to go."
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And maybe his wife said, "Well, you sure
[1:07:57] we got a little headache. You know, I
[1:07:59] was glad when they said,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Get dressed, family. We're going to meet
[1:08:06] the Lord this morning. We're looking for
[1:08:08] him to speak to us." But I wonder if he
[1:08:10] was transported in time.
[1:08:14] If he come to literal life service this
[1:08:16] morning, I wonder how he'd be acting
[1:08:19] because we know he acted a little
[1:08:21] strange
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; when the ark without the Holy Ghost was
[1:08:26] coming back to the into the city,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; embarrassed his wife, embarrassed
[1:08:32] everybody. He's just doing a dance
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And this is the word coming back without
[1:08:39] the Holy Ghost. This is only a type.
[1:08:41] This is only a shadow. And the man is
[1:08:44] acting crazy and he doesn't care.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says he looks up at his wife
[1:08:51] and says, "You think that's something?
[1:08:54] Watch this." And he goes on doing
[1:08:56] something else.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; He was unashamed. He didn't care. How
[1:09:02] many prophets and sages and kings would
[1:09:04] have loved to see the things and hear
[1:09:06] the things that's preached to you this
[1:09:08] morning. They would give all of their
[1:09:10] money to be transported past Calvary,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; past the book of redemption being opened
[1:09:16] by the lamb, and for them to come to a
[1:09:18] service this morning. I don't think he
[1:09:20] would just be sitting quietly and
[1:09:22] looking at his watch and saying, "When
[1:09:24] is he going to be done? I need to get
[1:09:27] going. I've got a schedule this week." I
[1:09:29] don't think that would be David. I think
[1:09:31] he'd be here for the day. I think when
[1:09:33] they songs of Zion came forth, I believe
[1:09:36] that he'd be worshiping the Lord because
[1:09:39] he's hearing things that he feels
[1:09:41] privileged to hear.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout, "Praise the
[1:09:45] Lord."
[1:09:47] And he's sitting there saying he's
[1:09:49] sitting on the edge of his seat and he's
[1:09:51] listening to the preaching and and
[1:09:53] brother Paul says and the lamb went to
[1:09:55] Calvary for us and he purchased we're
[1:09:57] completely it's none of our own
[1:09:59] righteousness and he's washed away every
[1:10:01] sin and he's like wait a minute wait a
[1:10:03] minute wait stop brother Paul let me
[1:10:05] shout a little while just on that point
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; and then I I speed ahead 2,000 years
[1:10:12] after Calvary and I say God's dealt with
[1:10:15] his people. I'm I'm repeating my sermon
[1:10:17] this morning. I've never done this
[1:10:19] before. I've never done this before. But
[1:10:21] he says, Brother Paul says, say that
[1:10:24] again. Brother Paul says, "And the lamb
[1:10:26] come that went to Calvary, the same lamb
[1:10:28] steps into John's vision. And now, now
[1:10:31] what he's purchased, the names in the
[1:10:33] book, he's coming forth to claim and
[1:10:36] take that book. Break it open so they
[1:10:38] can see their names. And then once they
[1:10:41] see that, he'll redeem everyone. and
[1:10:42] then I'm going to go get them and take
[1:10:44] them to a millennium together.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; And David says, "Wait a minute. Wait a
[1:10:48] minute. You've got to be kidding me.
[1:10:49] That's already happened. That's open to
[1:10:51] us. It's open." I don't think David
[1:10:54] would be sitting like a bump on a log on
[1:10:57] a pew this morning.
[1:11:09] I think he would be acting more like
[1:11:11] brother diggs. Cadre Diggs.
[1:11:17] There's no set form of worship or we
[1:11:20] become formal too. But everybody is
[1:11:23] affected in some way.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; In gratefulness
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; in humility.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; I'm unworthy.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve this. I can't take any
[1:11:33] credit.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; My eyes have been privileged
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; to look that he knew me and he chose me
[1:11:40] before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; When he wrote of each time frame in the
[1:11:46] Bible, he wrote that particular time
[1:11:49] frame with me in mind. I'm in there and
[1:11:52] I didn't even apply for the job
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; because my resume would never have been
[1:12:04] good enough
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; to occupy this position
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; and your resume wouldn't have been good
[1:12:11] enough.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; You got some good stuff. Well, praise
[1:12:14] the Lord. Your resume is still not good
[1:12:16] enough for this.
[1:12:23] Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] But I must have got the job. Wesley, you
[1:12:29] got the job. No, not Wes. Uh, Stevie,
[1:12:31] you got the job. Wes is still waiting
[1:12:33] for him. Stevie, you got the job. I just
[1:12:35] thinking, you got the job. He got the
[1:12:38] job he was praying for. He asked all of
[1:12:40] us to pray. So, he went a few days ago
[1:12:43] and he got the job. And probably his
[1:12:46] resume helped him and his character. But
[1:12:48] you know what? This position,
[1:12:51] none of us had anything to deserve it.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; And he already gave us the position
[1:12:59] before the foundation of the Lord to be
[1:13:01] sons and daughters of God. And to be
[1:13:03] kings and priests, that's what the open
[1:13:04] book makes us as kings and priests. And
[1:13:06] that type of position in the millennium
[1:13:08] as kings and priests. That's the highest
[1:13:10] position in the millennium. And none of
[1:13:12] us deserve to get it.
[1:13:17] Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Got the job, got the inheritance. You
[1:13:20] ever see somebody,
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; some kid that found out that he's in the
[1:13:24] he's in the will
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; and he's just been a dirt bag his whole
[1:13:29] life.
[1:13:32] And he gets a phone call from a lawyer
[1:13:34] says, "We want you to come in and we're
[1:13:35] going to read the will of the this
[1:13:37] ancestor that's there and you need to
[1:13:39] come in because your name is there." If
[1:13:41] the guy goes,
[1:13:43] "What? My name? Are you sure? You want
[1:13:45] to check that?" "Yeah, your name is in
[1:13:47] here."
[1:13:49] He heads to the office. He said, "I
[1:13:53] don't have anything. I've been a dirt
[1:13:55] bag. I haven't lived up to the name. The
[1:13:59] past that I come from is not deserving
[1:14:02] of this at all." And yet, he can sit in
[1:14:04] that room.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout, "Praise the
[1:14:07] Lord." Good.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; How in the world did you How did you
[1:14:11] become part of this inheritance?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; How did you get this, brother Michael?
[1:14:15] How did you get this, brother Rap?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; How in the world are you sitting in this
[1:14:20] room hearing your name in the book?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't deserve it. But he calls the
[1:14:24] guy and he sits there and he reads his
[1:14:26] name. And listen, you can't change the
[1:14:28] will. I'm in it whether I deserve it or
[1:14:31] not. God put me in this inheritance and
[1:14:34] everything. Brother Rabbit says
[1:14:36] everything that Calvary purchased
[1:14:39] belongs to every son and daughter of
[1:14:41] God.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; You know, it's just not portioned out
[1:14:45] like they do wills. It's everything that
[1:14:47] he purchased belongs to you.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Healing, revival. Can you say amen?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Healing for your mind.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Joy. Glory be to God. Happiness.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "Why are you so happy?"
[1:15:03] because I've got a right to be. I have a
[1:15:05] right to joy. I have a right to
[1:15:07] happiness.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And I didn't
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; deserve it. Can you say amen?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Our resumes would never be good enough.
[1:15:17] He gave it because one reason I'm his
[1:15:19] son.
[1:15:21] We are taught by this world
[1:15:24] a couple things is that we work our way
[1:15:27] up the ladder. we work our way up to
[1:15:29] something
[1:15:31] or we believe that we're entitled to
[1:15:33] something.
[1:15:36] How many knows we live in a world of
[1:15:37] people being feeling entitled
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; because I'm America and I'm entitled for
[1:15:42] the government to take care of me.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if there's a need, that's one
[1:15:46] thing. But people are living off it
[1:15:47] because of entitlement.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I'm entitled to this. Didn't do anything
[1:15:52] to earn it. So, you have a problem with
[1:15:54] entitlement. Wonder if that creeps over
[1:15:56] into sometimes message believers that I,
[1:15:59] you know, hey, I get this because
[1:16:01] because I am a message believer. It
[1:16:03] didn't come through entitlement
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; and it didn't because come because you
[1:16:08] worked your way up the ladder until you
[1:16:10] got it.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; So, this brings a feeling that we just
[1:16:15] we just we drop our head.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; We bow before him.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; It makes us humble. Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And that's true humility because it
[1:16:27] causes us, the reason that we dedicate
[1:16:30] all of oursel back to God is because of
[1:16:32] humility. We're ready to give it all
[1:16:34] back to him. We're ready to turn our
[1:16:36] life over to him because of the
[1:16:37] gratefulness we feel. And when Josiah's
[1:16:40] first response to the hearing of the
[1:16:42] book is the Bible says he rent his
[1:16:44] clothes and he wept. So rent clothes in
[1:16:47] the Bible. To rent your clothes is to
[1:16:49] tear one's garment as a public and
[1:16:50] physical demonstration of intense
[1:16:53] emotions like grief or sorrow. It
[1:16:55] happened in the Bible when someone died.
[1:16:57] It happened when there was great sorrow.
[1:16:59] But it also happened because they needed
[1:17:01] to repent. They they were they were
[1:17:03] smitten by their sin. And so they go so
[1:17:07] just tear their clothes. I've got to
[1:17:08] make it right with God. I've I've got to
[1:17:11] I feel that. And and then the other
[1:17:14] thing is shock in life. Shock will make
[1:17:16] them do it. H we don't have a lot of
[1:17:18] people doing this today, but I'm not
[1:17:19] preaching for people to rent their
[1:17:21] clothes, but I'm preaching for them to
[1:17:23] find the same humility and brokenness.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; It was a symbolic act of brokenness that
[1:17:31] showed the inner turmoil of a person
[1:17:33] often accompanied by other signs of
[1:17:35] mourning such as wearing sackcloth or
[1:17:37] ashes. That was Job. I was thinking of
[1:17:39] Job this morning and that moment that
[1:17:41] they walk in and his all of his children
[1:17:43] are dead and he's a son of God. Try to
[1:17:46] explain that one.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; How is it that Job did not turn
[1:17:52] against his God and blame God for that?
[1:17:55] How in the world, you know, you've had a
[1:17:58] lot of things happen in your life, but I
[1:17:59] don't think any of you has had that
[1:18:00] happen where in a moment's time, your
[1:18:03] precious thing that you pray for all the
[1:18:05] time, the devil kills him and God gave
[1:18:07] him perm permission to do that. You
[1:18:10] can't explain a God like that.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And yet, there's something there in him.
[1:18:15] He goes,
[1:18:19] he's he's in sorrow. He's renting his
[1:18:21] clothes, sackcloth, and ashes. But the
[1:18:24] Bible says in all this he didn't accuse
[1:18:27] God.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Later he found out that God endorsed it.
[1:18:31] God allowed it. But in all of it he
[1:18:34] never cursed God even when his wife was
[1:18:36] telling him to do it.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Just end it all. How how does that
[1:18:41] happen?
[1:18:43] I still just pondering that
[1:18:47] repentance and saw is renting of the
[1:18:48] clothes. it it's related to repentance
[1:18:50] and saw the practice was also used to
[1:18:52] express deep regret over sin such as
[1:18:55] when King Josiah tore his clothes after
[1:18:57] hearing the law of God being read which
[1:18:59] had been ignored by the people. So it's
[1:19:01] it's this soberness to the sin of his
[1:19:04] people that made him rent his clothes.
[1:19:06] God, where are we? What are we doing
[1:19:08] here? What's the state of the temple?
[1:19:10] There's all kinds of and I'll get into
[1:19:12] this in the next few weeks. There's all
[1:19:13] kinds of priestess of other gods.
[1:19:15] There's sodomite homes that have been
[1:19:18] built around the temple of God. There's
[1:19:20] priests of Baal. There's idols of Baal
[1:19:23] in the temple. They've kicked out the
[1:19:26] other things. And and and and and then
[1:19:28] so he didn't catch that soberness of
[1:19:30] where they were at until he heard the
[1:19:32] book and heard God's heart. You know
[1:19:33] what happened? He actually God had been
[1:19:36] getting angry over this. But guess what?
[1:19:38] Josiah begin to embody God's righteous
[1:19:41] anger. Yes. Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; How many would raise your hand this
[1:19:44] morning and say, "May I so personalize
[1:19:47] this that if God feels it, I feel it."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; That I would be so sick of sin like God
[1:19:55] is sick of sin.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "You go into one of
[1:19:58] these gas stations in the bathroom in
[1:19:59] this gas station and the stench and the
[1:20:02] smell and he says that's what sin smells
[1:20:04] like to God." Well, that's fine. is to
[1:20:07] God. But what happens when it makes us
[1:20:09] just as sick as it makes God?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; And we're going, oh, and this is he
[1:20:17] embodied the the as he heard this book,
[1:20:19] he embodied the righteous anger is that
[1:20:21] something's got to be done. Let me get
[1:20:24] past this is that another reason for
[1:20:26] renting of closes humility and
[1:20:27] supplication. The act was a physical
[1:20:29] manifestation of a broken heart and a
[1:20:31] state of humility sometimes done to
[1:20:34] plead for mercy or judgment. So all that
[1:20:36] is related to renting your clothes to
[1:20:38] tearing your clothes and crying like he
[1:20:41] did. It was an intense emotional
[1:20:43] response sitting and hearing this book
[1:20:45] read. He felt it. He became connected
[1:20:48] with it. He was spiit smitten by how far
[1:20:51] the drifting of God's people reminds me
[1:20:53] of the quote brother says, "I want to
[1:20:55] live a life that the least little bit of
[1:20:57] grieving I've done to my Lord, I would
[1:20:59] recognize it right away." Can I get an
[1:21:01] amen? That's the kind of life to live.
[1:21:03] not we become numb to sin and numb to
[1:21:05] the fact that we're drifting so far away
[1:21:07] from God. Maybe we're still a son of
[1:21:09] God, but we're drifting. We're dabbling
[1:21:11] in all kinds of junk of the world and we
[1:21:13] shouldn't be doing it. But the problem
[1:21:14] is is we become numb to how far we are
[1:21:16] away. May I live a life that the least
[1:21:19] little bit of grieving of my Lord, I
[1:21:21] would know it right away. I would repent
[1:21:23] and get their temple back where it's
[1:21:24] supposed to be. Somebody ought to say, I
[1:21:26] know this is hard preaching this
[1:21:27] morning, but there's only one way to
[1:21:29] live from this open book, and that's a
[1:21:31] life completely dedicated to him.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And that we humble ourselves
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; when sin is so close to us.
[1:21:43] You know, just a personal note about
[1:21:45] this being caught in this place and just
[1:21:48] saying this as a personal note so you
[1:21:50] understand my side as a pastor and as a
[1:21:52] minister and I say this in ministers uh
[1:21:55] devotions when I speak to them and their
[1:21:56] wives.
[1:21:58] The place of struggle for a minister
[1:22:01] many times is you're sitting here with
[1:22:04] this word so powerful and you catch a
[1:22:08] vision of where this word can take the
[1:22:12] people's lives.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; It's overwhelming.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Not me, but you're looking at the vision
[1:22:19] of this word and you catch the vision
[1:22:20] where this can take people. And then you
[1:22:23] look at the people's lives
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; and you just see, oh God, how do I get
[1:22:30] them from here to over here?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; How do I get them to see the vision?
[1:22:35] They're living below their privileges.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; They're living in their past. They're
[1:22:39] the devil's got them beat up for their
[1:22:41] past. They're living way below where
[1:22:43] they should be. Their marriage is
[1:22:45] nowhere near where it could be. This
[1:22:48] word,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; this word has power in it
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; to make us kings and priests.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the struggle because, you
[1:22:58] know, because we got our own human
[1:23:00] weaknesses and we're trying to tie that
[1:23:01] together. And a pastor really has to
[1:23:04] have grace because he'll sit and watch
[1:23:06] the sheep for years. And sometimes it
[1:23:08] takes years.
[1:23:10] Why couldn't they get it that Sunday?
[1:23:12] Why can't Why didn't they respond? There
[1:23:13] was there was there's the answer right
[1:23:15] there. And a pastor has a lot of
[1:23:17] patience. The evangelist doesn't
[1:23:19] sometimes.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; That's why he's not called to be a
[1:23:22] pastor.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; He's going to get them all saved and
[1:23:25] full of the Holy Ghost in one night.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And then he's going to leave town and
[1:23:29] leave the rest of the pastor.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; But guess what? We need the evangelist.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; God put him in the G body.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; We need that to shake us
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; of the state that we're in.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] Thank you for letting me share that. But
[1:23:47] to see the vision and to see where
[1:23:49] people are, it comes becomes a little
[1:23:52] bit discouraging because you see the
[1:23:53] potential of where this word can take
[1:23:57] us. It's amazing.
[1:23:59] You know, Josiah who was already king,
[1:24:01] he already had that position,
[1:24:04] but nothing was moving in his heart.
[1:24:06] There was no action. There was no action
[1:24:08] to take for the temple. He was
[1:24:10] comfortable in his place as a believer,
[1:24:13] but he had no feeling or heart in it
[1:24:17] until the book was read to him. Until
[1:24:19] the book became open to him. And when
[1:24:23] that happened, all of a sudden, it
[1:24:24] brought a feeling. It brought a
[1:24:26] sensitivity. It brought tears to his
[1:24:28] eyes. He was moved by the condition. He
[1:24:30] was convicted by the con the conviction
[1:24:34] that came with reading the book. It
[1:24:36] wasn't just he came to church. It wasn't
[1:24:39] just the book was mechanically being
[1:24:41] read. It wasn't just the pastor reading
[1:24:43] the Bible and we're good. There was a
[1:24:46] conviction that came with it.
[1:24:49] There was a feeling that come with it of
[1:24:51] the state that the temple was in at the
[1:24:54] state that the country was in.
[1:24:57] Didn't Didn't brother Brandon point us
[1:24:58] to Jeremiah where it says as an evidence
[1:25:01] of the Holy Ghost, go forth and mark
[1:25:03] them that are sighing and crying for the
[1:25:06] abominations done in the city.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Put a mark on those
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; because that's the ones nobody else
[1:25:12] really cares. But when we see this
[1:25:14] world, when we see the state it's in,
[1:25:17] when we see that we could be actually
[1:25:19] further along, it should move us to do
[1:25:22] something about it. And the first thing
[1:25:24] to do about it is to thoroughly repent.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; It moved him to a conviction. Joseph is
[1:25:33] saying, "I've been saying we're okay,
[1:25:36] but when reading this book, we're not
[1:25:38] okay.
[1:25:40] I've been saying I'm good, but we're not
[1:25:42] good.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; We need restoration. We need a
[1:25:46] supernatural God." Yes, we do.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; The word when it's doing its work, it is
[1:25:51] encouraging. And I'm glad it is
[1:25:53] encouraging. This word has an
[1:25:55] encouraging word to position sons and
[1:25:57] daughters that they can have the faith
[1:25:58] to believe in their position. So, the
[1:26:01] word will do its work in encouraging us.
[1:26:03] But the word is convicting as well.
[1:26:05] There's a soberness as well. Something
[1:26:08] in it would lead us to repentance. And
[1:26:10] that's not just when you first come to
[1:26:12] the Lord or the message. There's always
[1:26:15] something in this word to keep us sober
[1:26:17] and sensitive
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; to where we're at.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, we're missing
[1:26:23] something
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; because it not only raises up and I find
[1:26:27] I'm going to be honest, there's many
[1:26:28] conventions that's happened in this
[1:26:30] message that you can raise us preachers
[1:26:32] can raise the people in faith to a level
[1:26:34] that they can believe that they're sons
[1:26:36] and daughters of God. Nothing is
[1:26:38] impossible. I'm that's in this word as
[1:26:40] well because when a son of God sees his
[1:26:42] position,
[1:26:44] that really sees it by revelation.
[1:26:46] There's power when you recognize your
[1:26:48] position.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not against that type of
[1:26:51] preaching. But I've heard very little
[1:26:52] preach preaching about this part that
[1:26:54] there has to be a constant soberness
[1:26:57] that we are zealous to repent when we
[1:27:00] are wrong
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; because you're not in your corporate.
[1:27:03] You're not in your new body yet. You're
[1:27:05] not in your word body yet. You're in a
[1:27:07] fallen body. Twothirds of you is still
[1:27:10] not born again and won't be born again.
[1:27:12] And so you're imperfect. You're broken.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; We are imperfect. We are broken. Subject
[1:27:19] to mistakes.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Because we get the message and we're
[1:27:24] taught we're sons of God. Doesn't become
[1:27:27] this superhuman being that we zap the
[1:27:29] devil and we're above everybody else.
[1:27:31] No. As humans, we are still broken,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; susceptible to mistakes. That's right.
[1:27:38] That's right.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; So, I want to hear the the first
[1:27:41] response to this is he rent his clothes.
[1:27:45] He didn't say, "Glory be to God. I'm
[1:27:47] going to go do it right now." No, no,
[1:27:48] no, no. You rent his clothes because of
[1:27:51] the condition the temple was in.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; For those who are visiting this morning,
[1:27:59] I know this doesn't look like love, but
[1:28:01] I love you with all of my heart.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I love you. What kind of crazy preacher
[1:28:06] would stand up here and preach to you
[1:28:08] like this?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Unless it be the love of God. I don't
[1:28:12] even know some of you.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; So, I don't have any agendas to hurt
[1:28:16] your feelings.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; But I know enough about the love of God
[1:28:20] that he he gives us all that we need.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And it's God that leads us to
[1:28:27] repentance.
[1:28:31] I'm just going to say a few things
[1:28:33] before I
[1:28:35] wrap this up. Maybe wrap it up. I don't
[1:28:36] know.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You know, go ahead and before I go to
[1:28:40] this, go ahead and pull that quote up. I
[1:28:42] have one quote today of brother
[1:28:44] Brandham. And I just found this last
[1:28:46] night. I wasn't going to put us in this
[1:28:48] service, but I thought it was
[1:28:49] interesting how and this is in a prayer
[1:28:55] talking about what comes out of this
[1:28:57] open book. What comes out of seeing your
[1:28:59] name and in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:29:01] they are yours. They are love gifts of
[1:29:03] the gospel. They're memorials of the
[1:29:05] message tonight. Speaking about the
[1:29:06] people in front of them, your great
[1:29:08] presence with us. Put their names on the
[1:29:10] lamb's book of life there. Lord, we pray
[1:29:13] that each one of them will be there as
[1:29:15] your children, your beloved. So there he
[1:29:18] speaks of it wasn't just here at the
[1:29:20] altar. Their names are in the lamb's
[1:29:22] book of life.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's a special group of people. But
[1:29:27] what comes out of that revelation
[1:29:30] of knowing that, and he says this next,
[1:29:33] fill them with the Holy Spirit of God
[1:29:36] into their hearts. May their lives be so
[1:29:39] charged with the power of the almighty
[1:29:43] God. Stop right there. If we leave the
[1:29:45] rest of the quote, we're going to get a
[1:29:47] certain impression about being charged
[1:29:49] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Take the sword.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a certain truth to that.
[1:29:56] But I just wonder how the prophet
[1:29:58] discerned power in charged
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; that humility and love and kindness
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and gentleness
[1:30:13] will flow from them.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; That's saying everything I'm preaching
[1:30:20] to you this morning.
[1:30:22] You know, I could have just read that
[1:30:23] and sing, take the name of Jesus with
[1:30:25] you and that's it. That's what my wife
[1:30:27] says. You know, she how do you write a
[1:30:30] three or four minute song and preach a
[1:30:31] sermon in a 4-minute song and you preach
[1:30:34] for an hour and a half
[1:30:36] because you preach a sermon in a song.
[1:30:38] She says, "How can you do it there, but
[1:30:40] you can't do it in church?"
[1:30:43] And I say the same answer every time. I
[1:30:45] don't know, but I enjoy doing both.
[1:30:51] I could have just read this. He preached
[1:30:53] everything. What flows? What's the
[1:30:55] response out of the book being opened to
[1:30:58] us?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; What's the power? What's the What's the
[1:31:02] charge with the power of Almighty God?
[1:31:05] Well, it better not be missing these
[1:31:07] elements
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; or there's something desperately wrong
[1:31:10] with our interpretation
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; of the Lamb's Book of Life being open.
[1:31:15] Because if I'm seeing in the message
[1:31:17] things other than this that's coming
[1:31:19] from the revelation of the book being
[1:31:21] open,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; there's a problem.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I should get more amens of that. There's
[1:31:25] a problem.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Because what I see coming out of it is
[1:31:30] this humility and love and kindness and
[1:31:33] gentleness will flow from them. And
[1:31:36] guess what? Also a zeal to see others
[1:31:39] saved.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; That that was once their condition.
[1:31:44] Anybody who's come from a condition and
[1:31:46] God has redeemed you ought to have a
[1:31:48] humility to say, "This is not just for
[1:31:51] me. I understand the condition they're
[1:31:53] in and my love reaches out to them. I'm
[1:31:55] going to share this with them. I'm going
[1:31:56] to testify of it. I'm not going to be us
[1:31:59] for no more in the message walls. I'm
[1:32:01] going to say, "Oh, I'm just going to
[1:32:02] preach to the bride." No, no, no. You
[1:32:04] don't know who bride is. And if God has
[1:32:06] given you the greatest message that's
[1:32:08] ever hit the face of the earth, why
[1:32:10] would you want to keep it to yourself?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; What is this? innocent wants to keep it
[1:32:14] to ourselves
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; and say us four and no more.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; No. May we flow with love and humility,
[1:32:21] but may we have a zeal to see others
[1:32:24] saved. Can I get an amen this morning?
[1:32:27] May we have a zeal to see others saved
[1:32:31] because we were once in their condition.
[1:32:34] Grant, Lord. How many would say, "Grant,
[1:32:36] Lord."
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Say it loud. Grant it, Lord.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. That's what flows from
[1:32:40] this seeing your name in the book.
[1:32:43] That's what flows.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And this
[1:32:47] renting of clothes,
[1:32:52] you don't see a lot of this today.
[1:32:55] A real renting of clothes of repentance
[1:32:57] and anger at our condition. You don't
[1:33:00] see a lot of deep regret for sin
[1:33:03] where it goes beyond the feeling of
[1:33:06] feeling bad for what you did in your
[1:33:08] mistake. Oops.
[1:33:10] Shouldn't have done that. Sorry, Lord.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; That's not repentance.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Put a patch on it and say, "Okay, let's
[1:33:17] just get over this now." That's not what
[1:33:19] I'm talking about. I wonder if this
[1:33:21] world has taught us to be numb towards
[1:33:24] the the fruits of sin.
[1:33:27] I wonder if this world has taken the
[1:33:28] hard edge off of the damage sin can
[1:33:30] cause in our own lives. Or maybe we can
[1:33:33] see the damage of sin in all of our
[1:33:35] family members and we can easily preach
[1:33:37] to them,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; but we can't see the damage of sin that
[1:33:40] can hit us too.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; We become numb because we're believers,
[1:33:44] right? We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:33:45] We're above sin. We can even quote and
[1:33:47] say, "I have not sinned." Only by the
[1:33:49] revelation that he we are are sinless
[1:33:52] before how he looks us because of
[1:33:54] Calvary. I rejoice in that.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; But in your flesh, you're not sinless.
[1:34:03] The Bible teaches lining that revelation
[1:34:05] up that we are sinless before him and
[1:34:08] lining your body up to be under
[1:34:10] submission to that res revelation.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But the truth truth is when you line it
[1:34:14] up and you bring it under subjection to
[1:34:16] him and you keep under your body as Paul
[1:34:18] said, you always have the tendency to
[1:34:20] get off track
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; your mind, your thoughts.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; I just feel like preaching right now.
[1:34:30] We are living in a day where as Josiah
[1:34:33] seen prostitute houses built next to the
[1:34:36] temple of God.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Our phones are the closest thing to us.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to tell you that
[1:34:50] that's the time we live in that that
[1:34:53] instrument. Brother Paul, you going to
[1:34:55] tell us to get rid of our phones?
[1:34:57] Absolutely not.
[1:34:59] I'd like to
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; and I would make if you'd make the
[1:35:02] commitment, I'd make the commitment. You
[1:35:04] said, "Well, how are we going to
[1:35:05] function?" Well, we somehow did it
[1:35:06] before without phones,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; but it's not making a phone call to
[1:35:10] somebody. It's all the other trash.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be honest with you this
[1:35:14] morning. A few months ago, they put me
[1:35:16] on this I don't have any of those
[1:35:18] things. I tried one one time uh the the
[1:35:20] Twitter or the tweet or whatever it is,
[1:35:23] and I made a couple of posts and had
[1:35:25] some response and then I lost interest
[1:35:27] and that was it.
[1:35:28] So I don't I even Stevie, my blessed
[1:35:34] nephew, you know, was making fun of me.
[1:35:37] Oh, you're on you're on social media
[1:35:39] now. You know, I didn't think you
[1:35:40] believed in those things. I said, I
[1:35:42] really don't. And it's not because I
[1:35:44] just
[1:35:46] Anyway,
[1:35:50] they put me on this Snapchat
[1:35:54] and I'm gonna be real honest with you. I
[1:35:57] love it because they send personal
[1:35:58] things of all my grandkids constantly
[1:36:01] every half hour, you know, sometimes
[1:36:03] more. And I love it, you know. Oh my.
[1:36:06] Oh, my heart is warmed
[1:36:09] just, you know, this is so great. What
[1:36:12] What did
[1:36:14] uh Jim Jim say to me last night at the
[1:36:18] restaurant for the birthday party there?
[1:36:20] He said, he said, "If I had known the
[1:36:22] grandkids were this much fun, I would
[1:36:24] have just skipped my kids and went right
[1:36:26] to the grandkids."
[1:36:30] I said, "Amen" to that. This is what
[1:36:33] it's for, you know, and it's it's great.
[1:36:34] You know, you get to see them, but then
[1:36:35] there's this there's if I have my phone,
[1:36:37] I'll show it to you. And I told a young
[1:36:39] man in the church about he got his phone
[1:36:40] for the first time. I said, "This is my
[1:36:41] experience here. This to the right side
[1:36:43] is this other thing that you click on
[1:36:46] and it goes through these reels."
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; So, I did I went on there. So now I'm
[1:36:50] going through and there's advertisements
[1:36:53] on there and there's all this thing that
[1:36:54] I'm a little bit of a sucker for because
[1:36:57] oh this is you know how many steps do I
[1:36:59] got to do it per day and all this other
[1:37:01] stuff. So I'm reading this so what
[1:37:02] medicine do I need to take next?
[1:37:05] But but then then something comes up and
[1:37:09] it slips through
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; and it's an indecent dressed woman
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; and it sends a clear message of adultery
[1:37:18] or cheating
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; or some vile thought and then all of a
[1:37:22] sudden it's a cuss word dropping the
[1:37:23] fbomb. Right.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; So, it must happen where we enter a
[1:37:30] place that
[1:37:32] we're having to like find the sandwich
[1:37:35] in the garbage can.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be honest with you now.
[1:37:41] And this is I'm not preaching at you.
[1:37:42] I'm preaching at me. I'm telling you
[1:37:44] this become a temptation because you're
[1:37:46] wanting to see the good stuff. But then
[1:37:48] the way that we're built,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; the way that a man's eyes are built, the
[1:37:52] way that the man's mind thinks and
[1:37:55] emotional and the woman's more
[1:37:56] emotional, but the man is still has
[1:37:58] thirst within him for something to
[1:38:00] fulfill. And the eyes and that's the
[1:38:02] woman in Proverbs appro appealed to the
[1:38:05] man, the harlot woman by the way she
[1:38:07] dressed. She dressed like a harlot. She
[1:38:09] drove scantily. So that appealed to his
[1:38:11] eyes. And then she made her bed and got
[1:38:14] the bed ready for him. So that appealed
[1:38:16] to his desire for sex
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and but that wasn't it. I told the men's
[1:38:22] meeting a few weeks ago I said then the
[1:38:23] third thing she says is come together
[1:38:25] and let us take our soloulless together
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; and soloulless is an emotional need.
[1:38:31] Let's fill one another emotionally. Now
[1:38:34] how can that be happening to a man?
[1:38:36] Because we know the women is more
[1:38:38] emotional but a man has emotional needs
[1:38:40] too. And if a man feels like that's not
[1:38:43] being met in in that thirst in his wife,
[1:38:46] he will have the temptation to go to
[1:38:49] that woman who says, "I'll even fill
[1:38:52] that emotional need."
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; So, she's hitting on all three things in
[1:38:57] the thirst in a man.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And she's called the strange woman.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's true.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You know why she's the strange woman?
[1:39:06] Because it's any other woman other than
[1:39:08] your wife.
[1:39:10] Say, "Brother Paul, I'm not married yet.
[1:39:11] You have a wife somewhere."
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; So, still, any other woman than that
[1:39:16] wife that's coming is the strange woman
[1:39:19] in the book of Proverbs. You shouldn't
[1:39:21] look at her. You shouldn't text her. You
[1:39:23] shouldn't make communication with her.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Because that devil anointing her knows
[1:39:29] exactly how to appeal to a man.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going through this. I'm going,
[1:39:32] "Wow, this is this is some vile stuff."
[1:39:34] So right there, I'm at that thing that
[1:39:36] the Holy Ghost in me is saying, "This
[1:39:38] ain't right. I'm feeling convicted. I'm
[1:39:40] feeling condemnation." Your flesh is
[1:39:43] saying, "Probably like it does." But you
[1:39:45] know what? I've got to go through some
[1:39:47] of that so I can get to some of the
[1:39:49] other good things and the funny things
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; because we're built in the way that if
[1:39:56] something comes across and it makes us
[1:39:58] laugh,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; it kind of numbs us and makes us feel
[1:40:01] relaxed and oh, that's so funny. And
[1:40:04] I'll even show my wife and she'll show.
[1:40:06] That's so funny. That's so funny. But
[1:40:08] but we're a bit trapped because you see
[1:40:10] now our minds are built that we flip
[1:40:12] through something real quickly. But our
[1:40:14] minds are built that we caught it.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And I told the men a few weeks ago, I'll
[1:40:20] tell all of you, if you don't understand
[1:40:22] how you're built as a human being, and
[1:40:24] the devil does,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; you're in trouble. That's right.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; If you don't know how God made your mind
[1:40:30] and your brain,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and the devil has studied it for 6,000
[1:40:34] years,
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; the devil will have an advantage over
[1:40:37] you. Even if you're a Christian,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest with you.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; It'll appeal. You're going to be
[1:40:45] tempted. You're going to be It wants to
[1:40:47] trap you. And so, it's like, okay, you
[1:40:49] can't drag your soul and spirit through
[1:40:52] all of that just to get a nice nice
[1:40:55] relaxing moment. You can't do it.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; I told a story when I first moved to
[1:41:00] Toledo. I was single and I don't have a
[1:41:03] clue why I'm telling all this this
[1:41:05] morning, but I know I'm just trying to
[1:41:07] follow the leading of the Lord
[1:41:10] because I I hate the devil and his works
[1:41:13] to keep people from their potential of
[1:41:15] the sons and daughters of God they can
[1:41:17] be. We have been given the greatest
[1:41:19] message that's ever hit planet Earth.
[1:41:21] And your potential to be a son of God
[1:41:24] standing in your position is all here
[1:41:26] this morning. He's provided everything.
[1:41:28] But the devil is making you wander off
[1:41:30] into something that's not your position.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; I had to go down through the inner parts
[1:41:36] of Toledo. I I was getting something
[1:41:38] downtown.
[1:41:39] And this the first time I ever
[1:41:41] experienced this this real. And so I
[1:41:42] stopped at a stoplight and over there
[1:41:45] was what I as I looked at it learned to
[1:41:48] be a prostitute. It was a prostitute.
[1:41:51] and these areas of I guess it was that
[1:41:53] area. I probably shouldn't have been in
[1:41:54] that area, but anyway, I told the
[1:41:56] brothers in my church, I was honest with
[1:41:57] them at a prayer meeting. I said,
[1:41:59] "Listen, I can tell you." And she's over
[1:42:01] there and she's going,
[1:42:04] you know, she's going and she's pointing
[1:42:08] she's pointing to her apartment upstairs
[1:42:10] and she's inviting me to come and I'm
[1:42:12] stopped at a stoplight and I'm I'm I'm
[1:42:15] stuck there. I'm looking over at her and
[1:42:17] and and I was honest with her brothers
[1:42:19] to say I have to say my first thought
[1:42:22] was not a godly thought.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; that's a shame to say that.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It should have been godly. Should have
[1:42:29] been bless God. And yet I did get out of
[1:42:31] there. That was, you know, I didn't even
[1:42:33] I didn't even go any further. But my
[1:42:35] first thought was not a good one.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; What could this be? The curiosity. I'm a
[1:42:41] single man.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Never had sexual relations before. She's
[1:42:45] inviting me up there. She's scantily
[1:42:47] dressed and, you know, appealing to a
[1:42:49] young man who's never been with a woman.
[1:42:51] Probably like Joseph's situation with
[1:42:53] Pover's wife. And it's like my first
[1:42:55] thought wasn't that. It's because that's
[1:42:56] the way we're made.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; But if the devil does, you see, if I'd
[1:43:01] have been more versed and later on in
[1:43:03] the car, I thought of it. Not right
[1:43:04] away. If I'd have been really like I
[1:43:06] should be with some people say, "Holy
[1:43:07] Ghost, my first thought is that there's
[1:43:09] that strange woman and she's got that
[1:43:11] house up there out of book of Proverbs."
[1:43:14] And this is an exact scenario to that.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Should have been my first thought, a
[1:43:20] word thought, right?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Word believers.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; But I'm here saying in front of the
[1:43:25] whole world looks like now.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; But that was not my first thought.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; But thankfully, it wasn't going very it
[1:43:33] didn't go very far. And something from
[1:43:36] the inside reached up,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; pulled me into place.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And I didn't have a wife then. So, you
[1:43:43] know, it's just like sometimes it's it
[1:43:46] doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It's still damaged. And you have to have
[1:43:51] a soberness to sin
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; like God does.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You have to have a vision to say if I
[1:44:00] were to take steps towards that now, I
[1:44:02] got a vision of the destruction
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; after that one act.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; They don't look at it's just the
[1:44:10] pleasure for one moment. And I could
[1:44:12] hide it. Nobody would see it. I could go
[1:44:14] on with my church. I had started Bible
[1:44:16] study. I had started the church. I could
[1:44:17] go on. Nobody would know about it.
[1:44:19] Joseph could have had relations with
[1:44:21] Pontifer's wife and kept it quiet.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; But you know what he said to her before
[1:44:26] he ran? Bible says he ran.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; How can I do this sin against my God?
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; That's without the Holy Ghost. Now,
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; it wasn't about hurting her husband,
[1:44:40] which you can think of that.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't hurting her, hurting his
[1:44:44] reputation. It it was higher than that.
[1:44:47] How can I do this sin against my God?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; It's going to break relationship with my
[1:44:52] God. It's going to bring condemnation. I
[1:44:54] may not ever feel as close to God again.
[1:44:56] I don't know.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; But that's without the Holy Ghost what
[1:45:00] he thought.
[1:45:14] We should hate the smell of the world
[1:45:17] and the vileeness of it
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; just like God does.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I have Can I get an amen?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Is that Lily?
[1:45:30] Thanks for the amen, Lily.
[1:45:33] Now I'm gonna preach another half hour
[1:45:34] because you gave me that amen.
[1:45:37] Praise the Lord when you got a child
[1:45:39] saying it.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Can I say Can I say some things,
[1:45:47] brother Paul? You haven't yet.
[1:45:51] If we claim that this book of redemption
[1:45:53] has been opened,
[1:45:56] why do we have so much pride that's in
[1:45:59] our circles?
[1:46:05] If we're the people of the open book,
[1:46:07] why do we have things that produce
[1:46:10] persecution of other churches even in
[1:46:12] our own ranks?
[1:46:14] Why do we have preachers putting down
[1:46:15] other preachers because they have a
[1:46:18] different ministry or different vision
[1:46:19] for their own people? Why do we have
[1:46:21] that?
[1:46:23] Does that come out of the open book
[1:46:25] revelation?
[1:46:26] Or unless we do it their way at that
[1:46:28] church or preach it their way the way
[1:46:31] their new group is doing it, then we're
[1:46:33] not right and we're not in the bride's
[1:46:35] revival and that's that that's going on
[1:46:37] with their group and we need to join it.
[1:46:39] If you don't join it, you must be a cold
[1:46:41] formal church and you must not be
[1:46:43] catching the revival.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; If they feel like that we're not in or
[1:46:49] we don't have their revival, then why
[1:46:51] not pray for us? If you feel like I'm
[1:46:53] not in and I haven't caught your
[1:46:54] revival, why aren't you praying for us
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; that we get it
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; instead of bash us
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and procelite people in our congregation
[1:47:04] to come to the place?
[1:47:07] That's very good.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; I've seen this cycle go through that
[1:47:12] this group,
[1:47:15] this is, you know, 30, 40 years ago, 40
[1:47:18] years ago. This group in the message, I
[1:47:20] wouldn't give the name. It was on the
[1:47:22] west and they grew large, had a
[1:47:25] prominent, well-known ministry, a famous
[1:47:27] minister. I appreciated the minister.
[1:47:29] His ministry went around the world world
[1:47:33] and he could preach and the congregation
[1:47:36] grew very large. And then you start to
[1:47:38] hear
[1:47:40] this is the only place to be. How do I
[1:47:42] know they said that? Because they said
[1:47:43] it to me. This is the only place to
[1:47:45] move. This is the only place to be.
[1:47:49] And really there's only about five
[1:47:50] places in the entire message. If you're
[1:47:52] going to get it right and hear the
[1:47:53] preaching right, it's got to be in our
[1:47:55] circle. And there's four or five others.
[1:47:57] And you know, there's hundreds of
[1:47:58] faithful pastors around the world
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; with smaller churches.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; They don't have this dimming, this d uh
[1:48:08] classy ministry, this gifted person. But
[1:48:11] every Sunday and every Wednesday, I have
[1:48:13] friends now. I probably have more
[1:48:15] friends that are the faithful no-names
[1:48:18] in our ranks that have been doing this
[1:48:20] for 30, 40, 50 years. I believe they're
[1:48:23] going to receive a reward on the other
[1:48:25] side.
[1:48:26] That's right.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; But we judge things by who's the
[1:48:29] international ministry and who's this
[1:48:31] and and then they're bashing other ones
[1:48:33] and belittling and we must have the the
[1:48:35] the superior re where's the superior
[1:48:39] attitude come with your superior
[1:48:41] revelation. Where does that belong? Does
[1:48:43] that come out of this book? I'm even
[1:48:45] asking the question. I don't want to
[1:48:46] preach against. I'm just saying does
[1:48:48] that kind of attitude come out of the
[1:48:50] opening of this book?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I don't see it.
[1:48:54] And I would say to all of you that are
[1:48:56] listening is that if that would continue
[1:48:58] on, you don't want to have your family
[1:49:01] feeding on that type of spirit. It's not
[1:49:04] the word that's there. It's the type of
[1:49:06] arrogant spirit that goes with it.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So you need to pray and find a place
[1:49:12] that expresses all of the message.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I'm not saying here, but
[1:49:17] find a place where there's a humble even
[1:49:19] brother Brandon says if a a Holy Ghost
[1:49:22] boy wanted to find a right girl, he'd
[1:49:25] have to go to some come to some small
[1:49:27] little hol church and find a Holy Ghost
[1:49:29] fil girl. He didn't say go to all the
[1:49:31] big stuff. He said just keep looking for
[1:49:33] that simple, humble, Holy Ghost fil
[1:49:36] girl.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; It's not all about looks. No.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:49:45] There's only five places. And if you
[1:49:47] come to our place, you will be on the
[1:49:49] map with the rest of us because we're on
[1:49:50] the map now. What is all this?
[1:49:54] What is all this?
[1:49:56] And nobody else will say it. So, I guess
[1:49:58] that please don't be offended, but I'm
[1:50:01] going to say it. Is this what comes out
[1:50:03] of the opening of the greatest the book
[1:50:06] of redemption? is the denominational
[1:50:09] division that comes among us. Is that
[1:50:12] what comes out of the open book of
[1:50:14] redemption
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; superiority and this church is better
[1:50:19] than the other church and we've reached
[1:50:21] a plateau that everybody needs to go.
[1:50:23] You need to hear our pastor. And
[1:50:25] friends, listen, I don't believe that
[1:50:27] that's forming the people of the open
[1:50:29] book.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; We are the people of the open book. And
[1:50:32] the people of the open book are not
[1:50:34] expressing another denomination, another
[1:50:36] superior attitude, but expressing the
[1:50:39] true real spirit of Christ.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; It's not compromising. I don't believe
[1:50:44] in compromising.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; But we are all broken. And that's the
[1:50:48] the word I keep bringing you back to
[1:50:50] broken together. If we come not in
[1:50:53] arrogance, but in humility, if we'll
[1:50:54] come together and be broken. I'm going
[1:50:56] to talk about that at communion tonight.
[1:50:57] Broken together. Because brother
[1:50:59] Brandham says Jesus died not of the
[1:51:01] spear. He died of a broken heart.
[1:51:03] There's something about us remaining
[1:51:05] broken and humble before him that we
[1:51:07] keep ourselves in a place for more
[1:51:09] revelation,
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; for more of the move of God.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; But when we take the precious message
[1:51:16] and we become arrogant with it,
[1:51:18] we're getting off track.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; And they said, "You don't need to be at
[1:51:24] this church." The people who left that
[1:51:25] church, they said, "You'll come back.
[1:51:27] Everybody will be back here. Large
[1:51:30] place.
[1:51:31] And I thought after 40 years ago that
[1:51:34] we'd kind of learned not to build up
[1:51:36] ministries like that and not to have
[1:51:37] that attitude with one particular
[1:51:39] ministry. I thought we learned. But
[1:51:41] we're still having it. We still have it.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; A prominent very famous minister and and
[1:51:47] it's like this is the place. We're on
[1:51:49] the map now. This is the place to be and
[1:51:50] procelite others and you need to come
[1:51:52] here.
[1:51:56] And when that minister died, when those
[1:51:58] ministers die, the prominent ones, they
[1:52:02] look for the next prominent preacher in
[1:52:04] the message. They're big preacher
[1:52:07] followers.
[1:52:10] The next place they move is to follow
[1:52:12] the next big preacher. You need to move
[1:52:15] where that fella is your pastor
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; and his gift is feeding your family and
[1:52:21] your family is growing. It's just that
[1:52:24] simple. You don't look over the whole
[1:52:26] internet and say, "Well, who's the most?
[1:52:28] Who's growing the biggest and who's the
[1:52:29] prominent?" And that's the next place I
[1:52:31] move. You better pray about it
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and find for a real God-called man
[1:52:35] that's going to pastor your family.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Why do we make celebrities in the
[1:52:41] message? Is that what comes out of this
[1:52:43] book?
[1:52:46] Is that the people that comes out of
[1:52:48] this book of redemption? We make
[1:52:50] celebrities.
[1:52:51] We have elitism in the message. Elitism.
[1:52:55] I looked it up. It's not just a
[1:52:56] political philosophy. That's what they
[1:52:58] say. It's a political philos. Elitism is
[1:53:01] not just a political philosophy. It's a
[1:53:03] spirit. Do you know what it is?
[1:53:07] I'm glad you asked.
[1:53:10] Elitism is the attitude and behavior of
[1:53:12] a person or group who regard themselves
[1:53:15] as belonging to an elite. Elitism is the
[1:53:19] notion that individuals who form an
[1:53:20] elite, a select group with desirable
[1:53:23] qualities such as intellect and wealth
[1:53:25] or power or fame or physical
[1:53:26] attractiveness, notability, special
[1:53:28] skills, experience, lineage.
[1:53:32] This form of elite are more likely to be
[1:53:34] constructive to society and deserve
[1:53:36] greater influence or authority because
[1:53:38] they are the elite. Select persons or
[1:53:40] select groups who have superior superior
[1:53:43] qualities. That's elitism.
[1:53:47] And we have a a temptation for that.
[1:53:50] When we are the group who's been blessed
[1:53:53] to see the greatest opening of the word,
[1:53:58] we have the greatest tendency to become
[1:54:00] proud with it.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; To whom much is given,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; much is required.
[1:54:16] I've always read that scripture saying,
[1:54:18] you know, much is given, much is
[1:54:19] required that we give more or we give
[1:54:21] more money. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Let's let's think about character.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; The more people are blessed to whom much
[1:54:29] is given. How many would raise your hand
[1:54:31] and say much has been given to your life
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; through the Lord, through the message,
[1:54:37] much has been placed in your hands. And
[1:54:40] to whom much is given, then much
[1:54:42] character
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; is required
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; to carry it.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; People come in the environment of pride
[1:54:51] and makes them feel better to find
[1:54:53] they're in the right group now and every
[1:54:55] other church is wrong but their own.
[1:54:57] They become super spiritual themselves
[1:55:00] because they're attending the right
[1:55:01] place that have so many of this and so
[1:55:03] many signs. And
[1:55:05] I'm not against that. But if it brings
[1:55:08] pride and boasting and pointing to the
[1:55:09] minister of just that church, that's not
[1:55:12] what should be produced in this message.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; We lift up certain ones, they get lifted
[1:55:17] up. And ministers learn, we ministers
[1:55:22] can learn how to work a crowd
[1:55:25] into an emotional frenzy. You know why I
[1:55:27] say that? Because I know how to do that.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; You preach a lot for this many years,
[1:55:34] you can choose one thing. you can get
[1:55:35] the mind of the Lord and settle down.
[1:55:38] And if you don't feel any amens and
[1:55:40] there's not a lot of motion, you stand
[1:55:41] there flatfooted and you bring the word
[1:55:44] because it's not you that's doing it.
[1:55:46] It's the word that's doing the work.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; And he's here to do that.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; But me as a minister, I can step out of
[1:55:53] that because I've learned how to work a
[1:55:55] crowd. I've learned to work the crowd up
[1:55:57] to an emotion. And some of our young
[1:55:59] ministers have learned to do that. And I
[1:56:01] think it becomes a trap to those who are
[1:56:03] listening because they can get caught up
[1:56:04] in that. But my question is, does it
[1:56:07] become symbolism over substance?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; They become skilled at it. They're using
[1:56:18] quotes.
[1:56:20] He's preaching about the open book and
[1:56:22] it brings us power, but it has no power
[1:56:25] to conquer his pride.
[1:56:29] and he becomes on a head trip until they
[1:56:33] can't apologize when they're wrong.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; They might preach something that's wrong
[1:56:39] and they can't apologize. May God help
[1:56:41] all of us ministers
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; to have the humility that when we say
[1:56:45] something wrong, we get up and make it
[1:56:47] right.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; They preach something. If they prophesy
[1:56:51] something that's wrong, Brother Bam
[1:56:52] taught us you need to repent of that
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; or you have an evil spirit working.
[1:56:57] Well, it doesn't seem like an evil
[1:56:58] spirit. Oh, it's a No. If you prophesied
[1:57:01] something wrong and said it was the
[1:57:03] Lord, you need to make it right.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And a revelation of the open book, I
[1:57:10] believe, will bring that type of
[1:57:11] humility. Can you say amen?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; It's a personal burden of mine that I
[1:57:16] carry.
[1:57:18] And all of it is to say a people of the
[1:57:21] open book should not have fruits like
[1:57:24] this. And I'm not preaching against
[1:57:26] others. I'm preaching at us too this
[1:57:28] morning. The people of the open book
[1:57:30] should not have fruits that I've
[1:57:32] described, but a broken spirit that
[1:57:34] trembles in humility, fearful to say
[1:57:38] anything against anyone in a demeaning
[1:57:41] way.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; May God give us the reverence and
[1:57:44] respect that we would bite our tongues
[1:57:47] to say anything from your wife or
[1:57:50] husband to the preacher.
[1:57:54] May God put the fear of the Lord in our
[1:57:56] hearts and in our tongues that we would
[1:57:58] not say anything in a demeaning way
[1:58:01] against someone else.
[1:58:03] Let us see the first response from a
[1:58:05] real evidence that the book has been
[1:58:08] open to us. And the first response is a
[1:58:10] personal humility and repentance to see
[1:58:13] a true revival. And this is why I'm
[1:58:16] preaching this. I want to see a true
[1:58:18] revival in our lives.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Would you raise your hand? I want a true
[1:58:22] revival in my heart. I know this book
[1:58:24] brings a revival, but I want the true
[1:58:26] one.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I want the true one that has the fruit
[1:58:31] of passion for God's temple, a love for
[1:58:33] God, a love for one another, looking at
[1:58:36] ourselves first and not judging
[1:58:38] everybody else and saying, "It's me.
[1:58:40] It's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in
[1:58:42] the need of prayer. Not my brother, not
[1:58:46] my sister, but it's me, oh Lord,
[1:58:49] standing in the need of prayer.
[1:58:52] Not the deacon, not the pastor, but it's
[1:58:55] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[1:58:58] prayer. It's me, it's me, it's me, oh
[1:59:02] Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[1:59:07] It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord,
[1:59:12] standing in the need of prayer.
[1:59:16] What's the next verse?
[1:59:18] Not my father or my mother, but it's me,
[1:59:21] oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[1:59:27] Not my sister, not my brother, but it's
[1:59:29] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[1:59:33] prayer.
[1:59:35] It's me. It's me. It's me. Oh Lord,
[1:59:40] standing in the need of prayer.
[1:59:43] It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord.
[1:59:48] Standing in the need of prayer.
[1:59:53] So Josiah,
[1:59:56] the next thing he says after he rins his
[1:59:59] clothes and repents in tears,
[2:00:02] he says, "You men go to the prophetess."
[2:00:05] cuz that's the one that was the
[2:00:06] connection in that day. And I want you
[2:00:08] to ask her what she thinks of my desire
[2:00:12] now to do this and clean the temple and
[2:00:13] all this. Will God in this book I hear
[2:00:16] the judgments of God are on our people?
[2:00:19] But he's asking can there be something
[2:00:21] done? And he sends those men to the
[2:00:24] prophetess and you read it in your Bible
[2:00:26] next. She says the judgment stands.
[2:00:30] Israel will fall. They came in like a a
[2:00:33] hundred years later. Babylon came in,
[2:00:36] destroyed the temple, destroyed it, took
[2:00:38] all the vessels back to Babylon, took
[2:00:39] the young children. Judgment was coming.
[2:00:41] How many know in this nation judgment is
[2:00:43] coming in this world.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; But she said, she said, "Because you
[2:00:48] rent your clothes." Well, how did that
[2:00:49] prophet know? Cuz God knows that he rent
[2:00:51] his clothes. Because judgment's coming,
[2:00:54] but because you rent your clothes and
[2:00:56] you had brokenness in your tears and in
[2:00:59] your heart, I will give you a revival in
[2:01:02] your time. The people, you, the temple,
[2:01:05] whatever is on your heart to do,
[2:01:07] there'll be a personal light shine and a
[2:01:09] personal revival. Even though judgment
[2:01:11] was coming, you'll have your own
[2:01:15] connection to me.
[2:01:18] Hallelujah. That makes me feel good,
[2:01:20] friends. that repentance and renting of
[2:01:23] clothes and humility can get. He said,
[2:01:26] "I want a personal l word from the Lord.
[2:01:28] I hear the Bible, but I want a personal
[2:01:30] word from God's messenger. I need to
[2:01:32] know, will God give me a revival?" And
[2:01:34] she said, "Yes, because of your
[2:01:36] humility.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; I will give you that revival.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; It's me. It's me. It's me." Oh, stand
[2:01:45] together if you would. Standing in the
[2:01:47] need of prayer.
[2:01:57] Okay, it's too high. It's a little too
[2:01:59] high. I got it too high. It's me. It's
[2:02:02] me. It's me, oh Lord.
[2:02:05] Standing in the need of prayer.
[2:02:09] It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord.
[2:02:14] Standing in the need of prayer. Not my
[2:02:18] father or my mother, but it's me, oh
[2:02:21] Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[2:02:26] Not my sister, not my brother, but it's
[2:02:29] me, oh Lord. Oh, standing in the need of
[2:02:33] prayer. Lord, it's me. It's me. It's me,
[2:02:38] oh Lord. Standing in the need of prayer.
[2:02:44] It's me. It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
[2:02:49] standing in the need of prayer. We have
[2:02:52] another verse. Not the deacon, not the
[2:02:54] pastor, but it's me, oh Lord, standing
[2:02:58] in the need of prayer.
[2:03:01] Not the deacon, not the pastor, but it's
[2:03:04] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[2:03:08] prayer. Yes, it's me. It's me. It's me,
[2:03:13] oh Lord.
[2:03:15] standing in the need of prayer.
[2:03:21] It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need
[2:03:25] of prayer.
[2:03:29] Can we bow our heads and close our eyes?
[2:03:31] Maybe lay your hands on your person next
[2:03:34] to you and pray for them.
[2:03:44] You know that song, Kenny? Unworthy.
[2:03:50] Unworthy
[2:03:54] a beggar
[2:03:59] in bondage
[2:04:01] and alone.
[2:04:04] But he made me worthy.
[2:04:10] And now
[2:04:12] by his grace,
[2:04:14] his mercy
[2:04:18] made me.
[2:04:20] How many feel unworthy this morning of
[2:04:22] his grace? One more time before we pray.
[2:04:25] Unworthy.
[2:04:26] Just tell the Lord
[2:04:29] unworthy.
[2:04:34] A beggar
[2:04:39] in bondage
[2:04:42] and alone.
[2:04:44] But he made
[2:04:47] me worthy.
[2:04:49] And now
[2:04:51] by his grace,
[2:04:54] his mercy
[2:04:57] ordained me
[2:04:59] is all. Can we take a moment and lift
[2:05:02] our voices to him in humility? Pray for
[2:05:05] one another. Heavenly Father, we lay our
[2:05:07] hands on our brothers and sisters. Lord,
[2:05:10] we're sobered by your word this morning.
[2:05:12] We're a grateful, privileged people. And
[2:05:15] we want to express it and thank you,
[2:05:16] Lord. I feel privileged that I could be
[2:05:18] a part of your kingdom, that I could be
[2:05:21] in your mind before the foundation of
[2:05:22] the world. Lord, may I never take it for
[2:05:25] granted. May I never get a numbness to
[2:05:27] me that I forget what you've done for
[2:05:29] me. and Calvary and called me by name.
[2:05:32] May I never forget it. Lord, I truly say
[2:05:35] to you that we are undeserving and
[2:05:37] unworthy of this great gift that you
[2:05:40] have given us. But Lord, you made us
[2:05:42] worthy. You made us be able to accept it
[2:05:46] because Lord, you've seen us from the
[2:05:48] foundation of the world. Lord, may we
[2:05:51] have a heart that says, "Thank you,
[2:05:52] Lord, for that. I'm grateful for that.
[2:05:56] Lord, may it bring such a condition of
[2:05:59] the hearts and temples of the people
[2:06:01] that in the coming weeks, Lord, there'll
[2:06:03] be such a a true
[2:06:07] stir and revive on our hearts, Lord. A
[2:06:10] true thing, something that's beyond just
[2:06:14] religion, Lord, or something beyond a
[2:06:16] message status quo
[2:06:20] condition and change our hearts. Lord,
[2:06:24] make us what you want us to be. Father,
[2:06:26] I pray,
[2:06:28] we're sorry, Lord, for what we turn this
[2:06:31] into.
[2:06:33] Can the congregation agree with me and
[2:06:35] say, "I'm sorry what I turned this into.
[2:06:38] Let me not do that. Let me leave it what
[2:06:40] it is and let me believe it the way that
[2:06:42] it is."
[2:06:44] May you humble my pride, Lord, and
[2:06:47] answer our craving and need today, Lord,
[2:06:49] for what we need.
[2:06:52] Grant it, Father, every heart. May you
[2:06:55] prepare our hearts for the Lord's supper
[2:06:57] tonight as we remember that and enjoy
[2:07:00] that. Thank you, Father. Make our hearts
[2:07:02] broken before you, sensitive to you. We
[2:07:06] pray
[2:07:08] in Jesus name we ask. And everybody
[2:07:10] said, "Amen." Amen. Praise the Lord.
