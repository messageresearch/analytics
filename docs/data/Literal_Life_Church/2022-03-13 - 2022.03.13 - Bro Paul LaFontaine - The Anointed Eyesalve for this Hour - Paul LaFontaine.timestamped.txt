[0:00] blind man
[0:02] and by the way it took me by the surpri
[0:04] by a bit of a surprise that
[0:06] the faith was raised by last sunday by
[0:09] speaking of that not only for people to
[0:11] come forward and ask for spiritual
[0:14] healing of their eyes impaired
[0:16] spiritually
[0:17] people asking
[0:18] for prayer and coming forward and maybe
[0:20] you did it in your seat
[0:22] but not only that for people receiving
[0:24] faith to come and ask for problems with
[0:26] their child or their their physical eyes
[0:30] i was amazed and
[0:32] i'm believing that every need that was
[0:34] presented jesus is going to open their
[0:36] eyes
[0:38] we have children that's having trouble
[0:40] already and i thought praise god that
[0:42] the faith was raised say if jesus could
[0:44] do it back then he can do it now
[0:46] he's the god that opens up the blinded
[0:48] eyes and he's the god that heals
[0:50] impaired eyes
[0:53] amen
[0:55] so
[0:56] but the story that we read was a bit
[0:59] different and that's why i read it it's
[1:00] different than the familiar story of
[1:02] blind bartimaeus or the other blind
[1:04] people that came to jesus
[1:06] it's a bit different in the sense that
[1:08] there had there was a second phase
[1:10] of jesus completing his eyesight
[1:14] that was better the first time jesus
[1:16] touched him
[1:17] but and and and we know that god can do
[1:20] that and god's able to do it the first
[1:22] time he's able to do a complete healing
[1:24] the first time how many believe that
[1:27] but yet in this incident we see another
[1:30] example here set that that after jesus
[1:33] touched him the first time
[1:35] he was still a bit impaired in his
[1:37] vision it was better but it was not
[1:40] completely
[1:41] clear yet
[1:43] and i was just amazed at that and to see
[1:45] that his sight that was better as he
[1:48] touched him the first time but it was
[1:49] still impaired so it says that jesus
[1:53] touched his eyes again
[1:55] jesus ministered to him again jesus came
[1:58] and laid his hands on again and thank
[2:01] god because impaired vision spiritually
[2:05] impaired vision spiritually is one of
[2:07] the to me one of the greatest
[2:10] issues with christians today is that
[2:12] they have impaired visions spiritually
[2:15] and thank god that jesus our same jesus
[2:19] can take someone who's impaired in their
[2:21] vision spiritually and don't see jesus
[2:24] right and don't see people right
[2:26] jesus can touch your eyes again
[2:30] [Music]
[2:31] thank god of that this morning can you
[2:33] say mom
[2:34] he touched his eyes he spit in his hands
[2:36] and he rubbed the spit in his eyes and
[2:38] he touched his eyes again because he
[2:40] wouldn't leave him there in a in an
[2:42] impaired state he wouldn't leave him
[2:44] that it wasn't perfectly 20 20 vision he
[2:47] wouldn't leave him that way it was going
[2:49] to be 20 20 vision or be nothing because
[2:51] that's the way jesus wants to do it
[2:54] he must see and he must see clearly
[3:00] hallelujah
[3:03] so and as we ended last sunday
[3:07] you can keep trying and i said these i
[3:09] want to say them again you can keep
[3:10] trying to view things through your past
[3:13] you can keep trying to view things
[3:15] through your past hurts
[3:17] you can view things free through your
[3:19] rose-colored glasses
[3:22] you can keep viewing things from your
[3:23] past denominational view and mind you
[3:26] that does happen in this message were
[3:28] people in the message for years but they
[3:30] keep viewing the message through their
[3:32] pentecostal slant or through their
[3:34] baptist slat or through their messiness
[3:36] slant and they see it all that way
[3:38] that's an impaired vision we don't need
[3:40] to run it through a filter of
[3:41] denominations past but we need to see
[3:44] jesus clearly without any taintedness to
[3:46] the vision can you say mom and so you
[3:48] can continue to view it through your
[3:50] pride you can continue to view this
[3:53] church and what's preached and the
[3:54] message through your self-centeredness
[3:56] or you can say lord
[3:58] touch my eyes again
[4:02] touch my eyes
[4:04] that i can see this clearly
[4:09] hallelujah
[4:11] amen
[4:12] i wanted to read the laodicean church
[4:14] age because
[4:16] like
[4:17] jesus did with the blind man in a second
[4:20] touched he touched his eyes again
[4:23] really the same thing happens with the
[4:24] laodicean church age because the church
[4:27] who once had what she needed in other
[4:29] words
[4:31] the church through the ages had clear
[4:33] eyesight the church could see things the
[4:35] church could do things but now they're
[4:37] in a blinded condition but they
[4:39] originally because god touched the
[4:42] church
[4:42] they could they weren't in this state in
[4:44] the other ages you don't hear of them
[4:46] being naked you don't hear of them being
[4:48] blinded spiritually the other church
[4:50] ages you don't hear of them being poor
[4:52] spiritually it's only the last stage
[4:54] that we have this condition
[4:57] and so they were clear everything was
[4:59] fine then they end up in this condition
[5:01] but just like jesus touched the blind
[5:03] man again he gives the laodicean church
[5:06] an opportunity to come out of their
[5:08] blindness to come out of their nakedness
[5:10] can you say man he gives another
[5:12] opportunity he touches their eyes again
[5:15] he said i'll provide for you some i
[5:17] salve for your eyes and if you'll put it
[5:20] on you'll see in this blind age
[5:24] jesus loves you this morning
[5:26] jesus loves his church
[5:29] and his love provides what's needed for
[5:31] the conditions that we're in
[5:34] you can try to provide it yourself you
[5:36] can try to go to other means you can try
[5:37] to work it out yourself but jesus is
[5:40] provided for conditions especially
[5:44] spiritual conditions
[5:47] spiritual states that people are in
[5:50] god
[5:51] can transform a backslidden christian
[5:59] backslidden sometimes and don't know it
[6:01] but god
[6:03] can god can love them back
[6:06] into what
[6:07] kind of life that he wants them to live
[6:10] never give up on backslidden christians
[6:15] you don't give up on yourself
[6:19] isn't that funny how we never give up on
[6:21] ourselves
[6:23] we always come out smelling like a rose
[6:26] but if you don't ever give up on
[6:28] yourself and say well i still love god
[6:29] and i'm fine i'll come around someday
[6:31] well give that same grace to someone
[6:33] else
[6:36] amen so a church that once had what she
[6:39] needed now fell into a condition
[6:41] spiritually one thing was blindness the
[6:43] blindness is what i want to talk about
[6:45] this morning you know you can't get more
[6:47] tragic than a man stumbling around
[6:49] that's the way brother bram said it you
[6:51] can't get much more of a tragic
[6:53] situation of a man physically blind and
[6:56] physically naked
[6:58] stumbling around walking around and
[7:01] bumps into things and doesn't know where
[7:02] he's going that condition that's what
[7:04] was described by a symbolism that's the
[7:07] spiritual condition of the laodicean
[7:09] church as a whole that she's stumbling
[7:11] around spiritually you can't get worse
[7:13] than someone completely naked and not
[7:15] knowing they're naked and completely
[7:17] blind you can't get much more tragic
[7:19] than that i'm going to tell you that
[7:20] person needs help
[7:24] that person cannot get out of it on
[7:27] their own
[7:28] can i get an amen this morning
[7:30] that's a condition that they can't get
[7:32] around they can't function they can't cl
[7:35] they can't do anything they need
[7:37] somebody's help to get out of it
[7:40] [Applause]
[7:43] amen
[7:44] and so that's when he says
[7:46] it won't be as a big church revival but
[7:49] his grace offers a way out
[7:51] to individuals a way out of labor say he
[7:53] will lead you out of it and if he didn't
[7:56] we would all listen if god didn't give
[7:58] us a way out we'd all be laodicean
[8:00] christians
[8:02] we'd all be caught in the spirit of
[8:04] laodicea
[8:06] even us
[8:08] if god didn't give us a way out because
[8:10] god could not leave
[8:12] oh i just i love this god would not
[8:15] leave his elect
[8:16] with impaired vision
[8:20] i mean it's the last age
[8:23] it's the last time
[8:25] and at the very final thing
[8:28] he would leave
[8:31] leave us in a condition
[8:33] of being spiritually blind in this day
[8:34] when we need eyesight greater than we've
[8:37] ever needed it before
[8:39] to navigate and see through all the
[8:41] muddiness
[8:43] of politics
[8:45] through all the the fuzziness of
[8:48] opinions
[8:49] the information age
[8:51] the opinion age and all it does is make
[8:55] we think you know there's a lot of
[8:57] people that think that this is great the
[8:59] information age this is wonderful but
[9:01] there's a there's a downside to it
[9:03] and that is so many opinions of millions
[9:06] opinions are thrown out there and for a
[9:08] young simple heart that just needs god
[9:11] it's confusion because i wonder if this
[9:13] person's right i wonder if this person's
[9:14] right why is that person doing and
[9:16] wearing this and they're saying they
[9:18] believe this and it's just confusion and
[9:20] it blinds and makes everything all fuzzy
[9:22] can you say man
[9:24] i tell you we needed eyesight in this
[9:26] hour we needed isab for our eyes
[9:33] praise the lord
[9:35] he wouldn't leave his elect with
[9:36] impaired vision not in these times they
[9:38] have to see
[9:39] things have to be cleared and that's why
[9:41] the seventh messenger
[9:43] angel
[9:44] could not just be a reformal reformer
[9:47] excuse me the last messenger the seventh
[9:50] everybody knows there was seven angels
[9:52] to the seven churches
[9:54] their angels their messengers
[9:56] the last one
[9:58] could not be just a reformer
[10:02] the last one had to be a prophet
[10:06] why does the last one need to be a
[10:08] prophet because the prophet in the bible
[10:11] is the eye
[10:14] i mean he knows the prophet and the
[10:15] bible's an eye he's the eye by vision he
[10:19] sees when we're bound by fuzziness and
[10:22] can't make clarity of what's going on
[10:24] when israel was under ahab and he become
[10:26] fuzzy and he was so fuzzy in his clarity
[10:29] he lost all of what he was supposed to
[10:31] believe mary to jezebel everything was
[10:34] fight if you marry a jezebel you're just
[10:36] all cloudy you don't see who to marry
[10:38] correct and abhabab the king of israel
[10:40] his vision become cloudy
[10:42] you can safely say that by who he
[10:45] married
[10:48] praise the lord you can safely say that
[10:50] his vision had become cloudy choosing
[10:53] the character he needed to to choose
[10:55] because his vision was cloudy he chose
[10:57] the wrong woman he led israel the wrong
[10:59] way and the only answer was an elijah
[11:02] prophet with the eye of god to be able
[11:04] to give israel clarity and call it what
[11:07] it was
[11:08] [Applause]
[11:11] praise the
[11:12] lord so things have to be clear and
[11:15] that's why the seventh angel messenger
[11:16] cannot be a reformer but a prophet the
[11:18] prophet is the eye the eye part of the
[11:20] body of christ that's the prophet
[11:23] how can we function without our eyes
[11:25] without an eye how can we function
[11:27] without a prophet given a vision for the
[11:29] hour
[11:30] psalms 32 and verse 8
[11:32] psalms 32 and verse 8 says i will
[11:35] instruct thee and teach thee
[11:38] in the way which thou shalt go
[11:41] i will instruct thee and i will teach
[11:43] thee in the way which thou should go how
[11:46] many can say praise the lord for that
[11:48] god will be personal i will instruct
[11:50] thee and teach thee in the way that thou
[11:52] shalt go i will guide thee by mine
[11:57] that's a prophet
[11:59] that's a prophet
[12:02] so the bride has to have 20 20 vision in
[12:04] these times
[12:05] we we must see through this fog of this
[12:08] information age a knowledge age you know
[12:11] information is not revelation
[12:16] more information isn't always good
[12:21] knowledge is not always revelation
[12:24] knowledge is not revelation you've heard
[12:27] the term i've heard it in the last few
[12:28] weeks the fog of war i didn't know that
[12:30] term until recently the fog of war and
[12:32] that we that that that
[12:34] says that in the fog when war happens
[12:37] there's a fog in other words about how
[12:39] information gets out
[12:41] a lot of stuff can be reported that's
[12:43] not really happening
[12:46] it's the fog of war and everybody gets
[12:48] nervous and everybody starts reacting
[12:49] and this is happening because of this
[12:52] and brother jared one of our ministers
[12:53] of the church has been sending me some
[12:55] things directly from the ukrainian
[12:58] consulate from here in the states
[13:00] because i would rather be making sure
[13:02] that we read accurate information when
[13:04] we report on it and so we see that it's
[13:07] a fog foggy time for the fog of war the
[13:09] wrong information can get sent in these
[13:11] times more than ever and daniel 12 and
[13:14] verse 4 if you'd pull the scripture up
[13:16] daniel 12 and verse 4 says but thou o
[13:19] daniel and he remember he has the
[13:21] mystery of what's supposed to happen in
[13:23] the last days
[13:24] and he says oh daniel shut up the words
[13:27] seal the book even to the time of the
[13:30] end so now there's a mystery about what
[13:33] all is supposed to take in place seal it
[13:35] up until the end time says it in
[13:38] revelations 10 as well where john sees
[13:40] it and he says no it's not time yet seal
[13:43] it up john seal with 17 seals but at the
[13:46] end time he'll give eyesight in other
[13:48] words in an end time he'll burst the
[13:50] mystery forth and everybody will
[13:51] understand well excuse me i should say
[13:54] the elect is going to understand can you
[13:56] say amen but oh daniel shut up the words
[13:59] seal the book even to the time of the
[14:01] end many shall run to and fro and
[14:04] knowledge shall be increased
[14:09] you know what that's saying
[14:10] that in knowledge will be increased
[14:12] because of that people will run to and
[14:14] fro
[14:15] inconsistent unfaithful jumping around
[14:18] you don't know what they believe from
[14:19] one week to the next because of all this
[14:21] knowledge can you say man but he says
[14:24] right at the time where knowledge will
[14:26] be increased
[14:28] that's when i'm gonna take the seven
[14:30] seals off and reveal the mystery of god
[14:34] because why my people are gonna need it
[14:36] because they're gonna live in the middle
[14:38] of many run and to and fro not knowing
[14:40] the right information not knowing the
[14:42] revelation and the knowledge will be
[14:44] increased my people are going to need
[14:46] clarity they're going to need vision
[14:48] they're going to need to see and so save
[14:50] it save it save it until the end time
[14:52] [Applause]
[14:56] tell your friends i'm going to get
[14:57] excited in a minute here
[15:02] the grace of god
[15:03] gives it in the end time save this
[15:05] unveiling
[15:06] they're going to need it through the eye
[15:08] of a prophet
[15:09] it can't be a reformer
[15:12] tmi
[15:14] is too much information
[15:18] should preach a sermon on that tmi
[15:21] our children and our young people
[15:23] it's too much information
[15:29] florida had to block a law
[15:33] they wanted to bring
[15:34] the teaching
[15:36] of homosexuality
[15:38] to four and five-year-olds
[15:41] and thank god for a governor says we
[15:42] better pass the law and stop this
[15:44] imagine the mind of a parent can you
[15:47] imagine that the pervertedness of a
[15:49] parent that would say
[15:51] first of all it should be in parents
[15:53] hands completely to teach that child
[15:55] about sex
[15:58] and to teach them from the word of god
[16:01] this is correct and this is wrong this
[16:03] is sinful
[16:04] this is an
[16:07] but abomination
[16:08] what
[16:09] news flash
[16:10] they're coming for your kids
[16:14] sodom and gomorrah is coming for your
[16:17] kids
[16:20] they're coming for their minds at five
[16:21] years old
[16:27] in this age without a prophetic eye
[16:30] you will be like gehey's a high heisei
[16:34] you said oh lord
[16:36] what are we going to do
[16:38] elijah's servant
[16:40] what in the world are we going to do we
[16:42] are surrounded we're finished
[16:45] and it was all about the eyesight
[16:49] i mean this isn't just an unbeliever
[16:51] this is the servant of elisha under the
[16:53] prophet there's somebody that close to
[16:55] him and his eyesight is impaired
[16:58] come on people
[17:00] he's in the message
[17:02] he believes elijah's the prophet he's a
[17:04] servant to him but his vision is
[17:06] impaired
[17:08] and all of a sudden he's a
[17:11] we're surrounded we're finished they're
[17:14] everywhere
[17:16] and the prophet says oh lord that's the
[17:19] way brother bryan said please open the
[17:20] boy's eyes
[17:24] and sometimes
[17:25] i'd say most the time that's what we
[17:27] need
[17:28] if we're living in fear god needs to
[17:30] open your eyes if we're living in the
[17:32] lust of the world god needs to open your
[17:34] eyes if we're living by the fashions of
[17:36] the world god needs to open our eyes if
[17:39] we're with him with a tainted view of
[17:40] this message god needs to open our eyes
[17:44] that's the answer can you say man
[17:46] [Applause]
[17:47] lord opened the boy's eyes and all of a
[17:49] sudden his eyes were open and there was
[17:51] a host of angels and a host of chariots
[17:54] surrounding that army and that's all he
[17:56] needed to see we're all right we're fine
[17:58] let me tell you today friends i don't
[18:01] care what's going on in this world i
[18:03] don't care how fearful things are
[18:04] happening i don't care how many men's
[18:06] hearts are failing for fear
[18:08] [Applause]
[18:09] i'm looking at something different can
[18:11] you say man
[18:12] and elijah said boy
[18:14] there's more with us than with them
[18:16] [Applause]
[18:21] that's the way we need to see it when
[18:24] fear grips our heart and we're scared of
[18:27] what's happening in the world we need i
[18:29] see eyesight and a revelation guess what
[18:32] there's more with us than with them
[18:34] [Applause]
[18:37] the world's crowding into my family the
[18:40] world the spirit of satan is trying to
[18:42] take my marriage and to take my family
[18:44] but you need that faith that says but
[18:46] there's more that's supporting us that's
[18:49] what the devil's coming against us
[18:51] there's more with us
[18:53] there's more standing on your side
[18:58] there's more angels than there is demons
[19:00] can you say man there's more of god
[19:02] behind you than what satan is against
[19:05] you
[19:06] [Applause]
[19:08] i tell young people you make the
[19:10] slightest little desire towards god all
[19:13] of heaven is backing you up all of
[19:15] heaven is backing you up devil tries to
[19:17] tell you you don't have any friends the
[19:19] devil tries to tell you you're alone
[19:21] there's nobody i'm trying to do this all
[19:23] on my own i'm in this little church
[19:25] that's by myself there's no fellowship
[19:27] and let me tell you something i don't
[19:28] care the conditions you are not alone
[19:31] all of heaven is backing you up
[19:40] blessed be his name
[19:44] it's the seventh angel that the mystery
[19:45] of god is finished so he has to be a
[19:47] prophet because we need the eye of god
[19:49] to lead us out
[19:50] i'm gonna pull a couple quotes up here
[19:52] now
[19:54] if someone you know what let me just
[19:55] stop here if someone
[19:57] is blind
[19:59] then it until their eyes are open it
[20:01] takes another with eyes to lead them out
[20:08] you don't get another blind man to lead
[20:09] a blind man
[20:12] this is i know this is common sense
[20:14] preaching but
[20:15] excuse me
[20:17] let me just get it straight
[20:19] if you're becoming backslidden blind
[20:21] spiritually you don't need to be
[20:23] commuting communicating with somebody on
[20:25] the internet
[20:26] that's blind themselves
[20:29] you don't need to be forming friendships
[20:31] with anybody that doesn't have any
[20:33] eyesight whatsoever
[20:35] they're not going to lead you out
[20:43] solomon go to the back of the church
[20:50] solomon you're blind
[20:52] you're blind as a bat
[20:55] so i have to illustrate here a little
[20:57] bit
[20:58] how god has given us great to lead us
[21:00] out of the conditions of laodicea
[21:05] we're not going with the
[21:07] solomon you're blind you're naked
[21:10] you're poor
[21:11] we're not going with the naked here in
[21:13] the service
[21:14] you should be thankful for that
[21:19] don't open your eyes now
[21:21] you're blind
[21:22] you're naked you're poor actually the
[21:24] poor one someone's in that state right
[21:26] now so that's pretty good he's a
[21:28] starving student trying to finish
[21:31] up and makes a big money someday
[21:36] you're poor naked you're blind but the
[21:37] blindness is what i want to get to today
[21:40] and so
[21:41] i want you to do your best solomon with
[21:44] your eyes closed
[21:46] to make it out of your condition and
[21:47] make it up to me i want you to come to
[21:49] me

[22:46] you're in a condition if you live the
[22:48] rest of your life this way

[22:56] and so you're in this condition at
[22:58] laodicea
[23:00] i'll be your eyes solomon
[23:02] right
[23:04] and i'm going to guide you out of this
[23:05] condition completely
[23:18] it's hard to trust me
[23:26] i'll guide thee by mine eye
[23:28] i'll give you a prophet with eyesight to
[23:30] take you out of laodicea
[23:32] if you give your pastor respects he's
[23:34] ordained of god to lead you through to
[23:36] the other side
[23:41] take a step
[23:44] take a step
[23:46] one more step

[24:12] because i want you to know his friends
[24:14] now
[24:15] it's not just guiding somebody out of
[24:17] their condition
[24:19] the bible says anoint thine eyes with i
[24:22] said
[24:23] that thou mayest see
[24:26] you can't continue on and just depend on
[24:31] just someone else leading you he says no

[24:37] that you can see things right
[24:39] is that what the bible says
[24:41] it's not just the prophet at isaf it's
[24:43] not just the pastors have i said but i'm
[24:45] going to take it and if you'll let me
[24:47] i'll apply it i'll apply it to your eyes
[24:50] and when i apply the isab your impaired
[24:52] vision will come open
[24:54] and the first thing that you see
[24:56] is jesus christ the way you should see
[24:58] him

[25:07] [Applause]
[25:15] it's not just that he helps lead you out
[25:18] but he anoints your eyes with isabel
[25:21] isn't that the message
[25:22] isn't that what this is all about isn't
[25:24] it what i said last sunday is that
[25:26] unless you see jesus correctly nothing
[25:28] else will be right
[25:30] church this church that
[25:32] never be right we must be looking at
[25:34] christ in him alone
[25:36] thank you solomon god bless you let's
[25:38] give them a hand god bless you
[25:46] take those quotes
[25:49] i'll take those quotes here the first
[25:51] one in door to heart spiritual blindness
[25:54] is 10 million times worse than physical
[25:57] blindness
[25:59] if i had to go blind in my eyes and go
[26:01] blind in my spirit god take my eyes
[26:05] before my spirit
[26:07] let my eyes be open to see his glory
[26:09] anoint mine eyes lord with i salve don't
[26:12] let cold come in and set up infection
[26:16] and coldness indifference denominations
[26:19] creeds
[26:20] doctrines he's mentioning all the things
[26:22] that cloud the eyes
[26:24] spiritually
[26:25] doctrines and so forth that gives you
[26:27] pneumonia and your eyes have been all
[26:29] mattered and swelled up until now god
[26:31] can show his glory you can hear somebody
[26:33] enjoying it so-and-so got healed why
[26:36] can't i just open your eyes to see the
[26:38] glory he's here christ still lives
[26:41] the next one is i want to read in jesus
[26:44] at the door and another message he's
[26:46] preached on it here the other day a
[26:48] woman in louisville
[26:50] she was taking her little boy around to
[26:52] places and the counters of the 10 cent
[26:55] stores and she was saying look honey and
[26:57] the little fella set staring and she
[26:59] took him to another counter she said
[27:01] look honey and he just stared and the
[27:03] people begin to watch her and finally
[27:05] she picked up a little trinket that made
[27:07] a noise and she said look honey
[27:10] and the little fella just stared and she
[27:12] fell across the counter screaming and
[27:15] the people come to find out if they
[27:17] could comfort her
[27:19] they said what's the matter and she said
[27:21] he's a little human being
[27:24] said he's he's the offspring of our
[27:26] union husband and i and i said he's got
[27:29] to a place that he won't even notice
[27:31] things that pertain to human beings his
[27:34] mind has become add-on and he just
[27:37] stares
[27:39] here's a parent screaming
[27:41] and
[27:42] and anybody who is a parent
[27:44] has this start to happen to a child it
[27:47] affects us
[27:52] it affects us
[27:54] because you know i might be one thing at
[27:55] 55 years old and becoming vision
[27:58] impaired but to live the rest of your
[28:00] life that way
[28:01] that's a concern and now something's
[28:03] changing with his eyesight and his mind
[28:05] she said
[28:06] he doesn't even notice things that
[28:07] pertain to human beings something was
[28:09] happening and their reaction is just
[28:12] she's she's just screaming because she's
[28:14] about she's going crazy she's just oh
[28:16] don't let this happen oh i can't believe
[28:18] this is happening
[28:21] i can't believe i tell you parents need
[28:22] to be screaming in their hearts and
[28:24] crying to god because the devil's after
[28:26] your children's minds
[28:28] the devil wants to impair your vision
[28:34] the devil is after sodom was at lot's
[28:37] door knocking on the door
[28:40] we need some parents to arise
[28:43] we need some parents to check everything
[28:45] that their children are watching
[28:51] we need to be concerned about the hour
[28:53] that we live in in this case it's about
[28:55] our children just as much physically as
[28:57] this child is losing his eyesight but
[28:59] spiritually satan wants to impair the
[29:02] vision that the kids don't see marriage
[29:05] right and the kids don't see what a man
[29:07] and a woman is right
[29:09] kids don't see what a normal home is
[29:11] like kids don't see they don't they're
[29:14] starting to see another perspective
[29:15] because satan's going to teach them from
[29:17] a very young age just like this woman is
[29:20] screaming and concerned and all upset
[29:22] about physically we need to be just as
[29:25] just as concerned
[29:30] it should jolt us just so much that
[29:32] satan's taking the eyesight of my
[29:34] children
[29:35] i thank god for families here that have
[29:37] jerked their kids out of certain schools
[29:39] that have dirt their kids this way and
[29:41] it might be hard on the kids emotionally
[29:43] but they made the decisions based upon
[29:45] the spirit that's trying to take their
[29:47] children's minds
[29:49] god bless them can you say man god bless
[29:53] the governor of florida god bless people
[29:55] that are still have some eyesight
[29:57] [Applause]
[29:59] you may make hard decisions you might
[30:01] make hard decisions for your children it
[30:03] may be hard to hold up the standard in
[30:04] your home but listen hold to god's word
[30:07] and truth will always prevail
[30:10] someday that kid will thank you
[30:14] because they're too young to see
[30:16] the deception behind everything
[30:21] amen
[30:23] is there any more of that quote is that
[30:24] it no yeah and it if that ain't the
[30:27] condition of the church today god's
[30:29] showing billy grahams and oral roberts
[30:30] great signs and wonders and the church
[30:32] says that's not my denomination and they
[30:34] just stare because they're spiritually
[30:36] insane just stare oh this is my church
[30:38] that's not the sign that follows the
[30:40] believer they listen to their church and
[30:42] forget the spirit of god that makes you
[30:43] act christ-like that makes you love him
[30:46] and believe him
[30:47] but what happened their eyes are blinded
[30:49] they can't you say i have 20 20. but you
[30:52] see the blindness he's talking about is
[30:54] spiritual blindness
[30:57] he actually had a guy tell him and said
[30:58] when he's talking to him like this he
[31:00] said he says i have 20 20 vision i can
[31:02] see he said if you're a true prophet
[31:04] might be blind right now
[31:06] you imagine
[31:09] and he could have done it
[31:10] but he says no no he said you're already
[31:13] blind
[31:15] if you're saying the days of miracles
[31:16] are past and you're saying there's
[31:18] nothing to this and this is not
[31:19] scriptural you are blinded spiritually
[31:22] and that's a worse blindness than ever
[31:24] being blind physically
[31:27] i say amen
[31:29] when i'm talking about children i want
[31:31] to bring up
[31:33] disney
[31:37] not gaining any popularity
[31:41] votes this morning that's for sure
[31:48] did you read what the ceo
[31:50] bob chapek of disney did you read what
[31:52] he said
[31:53] this week when all this came up in
[31:55] florida did you read what disney said
[31:56] the guy that
[31:58] orchestrates producing all the
[32:01] disney films
[32:02] don't get up and walk out please stay
[32:04] where you're at just listen it's in the
[32:06] news he said it
[32:09] and first of all bob chapac didn't get
[32:11] behind
[32:12] trying to block the bill that the
[32:14] governor of florida
[32:16] put out
[32:17] and then he got such an uproar from his
[32:20] employees in the lgbtqu
[32:23] xyz
[32:25] community
[32:26] that he had to issue another statement
[32:28] well this is one of the initial ones he
[32:29] said and then he initiated a statement
[32:31] he's trying to explain himself why we
[32:33] don't get involved in that he's
[32:34] explaining why he wouldn't get involved
[32:36] politically to help change the social
[32:39] thing of the minds of people this is a
[32:41] reason i believe the best way for our
[32:44] company
[32:45] to bring about lasting change is through
[32:47] the inspiring content we produce
[32:50] the welcoming culture we create
[32:53] and the diverse community organizations
[32:56] we support there's a reason content is
[32:59] at the top of this list for nearly a
[33:01] century our company stores
[33:03] for nearly a century our company's
[33:05] stories
[33:06] have open minds
[33:08] inspired dreams shown the world both as
[33:11] it is
[33:12] and how we wish it could be
[33:16] and now more than ever before represent
[33:19] the incredible diversity
[33:21] of our society now i didn't say that
[33:25] somebody else didn't say that
[33:27] the guy who's in charge of disney now
[33:30] and he says the last century this has
[33:32] been the motive
[33:34] of disney
[33:39] amen
[33:52] we are telling important stories
[33:55] raising voices
[33:57] and i believe
[33:59] changing hearts and minds
[34:02] in kanto black panther
[34:06] reservation dogs coco soul modern family
[34:10] shang chi
[34:11] summer of soul love victor
[34:14] these and all of our diverse stories are
[34:17] our corporate
[34:18] statements well
[34:21] corporate statements i mean i thought
[34:23] you guys were just making some nice
[34:25] children's movies for my kids
[34:28] so they can laugh and
[34:35] maybe i shouldn't have read this this
[34:36] morning
[34:39] just let you know i've
[34:41] i've watched disney movies
[34:43] most of my kids lived on little house on
[34:45] the prairie
[34:47] until they were tired of it
[34:49] and vegeta veggie tales but we watch
[34:52] some dizzy movies
[34:54] and maybe there's some innocence to some
[34:56] of them
[34:57] maybe i don't know but i'm just reading
[34:59] what their agenda is
[35:01] is to change the minds of our kids
[35:03] and to do it slowly
[35:06] to accept things
[35:07] that are against the word of god
[35:10] i'm just telling the truth don't get mad
[35:12] at me if i'm telling the truth i'm
[35:13] telling the truth we watched them matter
[35:15] of fact the other day i watched through
[35:17] one with uh my daughter
[35:19] so because i'm critical you know i'm
[35:21] just trying to scan the whole thing and
[35:23] say okay what are they trying to stay
[35:25] here and i won't mention the movie but
[35:27] it was one of their newer ones and i'd
[35:28] say this is all fun and this is all
[35:31] great and my granddaughter ellie loves
[35:33] to some of these fun characters and it's
[35:36] all there but it was very hard to detect
[35:38] even with the holy ghost hard to detect
[35:39] how to put your finger on
[35:42] and as he says here he's trying to
[35:44] introduce things so i didn't get it's
[35:46] just hard to you know as it doesn't seem
[35:48] like there's anything wrong with this
[35:49] and then i began to notice this one
[35:51] character in it that was
[35:53] dressed in a way that you couldn't tell
[35:55] by his voice and by his stress you
[35:58] couldn't tell whether he was
[36:01] male or female
[36:04] i mean i couldn't tell i couldn't tell
[36:06] so then when i read this yesterday i
[36:07] thought now now i see but that's very
[36:10] subtle
[36:11] that the kid can't tell and they're
[36:13] teaching the kid you shouldn't be able
[36:15] to label them anything and you shouldn't
[36:16] be able to tell if they want to make it
[36:18] so you can't tell
[36:21] that's the way we want our kids to think
[36:24] in the future
[36:27] these and all of our divi diverse
[36:29] stories he continues our our corporate
[36:32] statements and they are more powerful
[36:34] than any tweet or lobbying effort
[36:42] they are more powerful
[36:45] what we're doing through
[36:47] hollywood and through these things are
[36:49] more powerful than any tweet or lobbying
[36:53] effort
[36:55] i firmly believe that our ability to
[36:58] tell such stories and have them received
[37:02] with open eyes
[37:04] open ears
[37:05] open hearts
[37:07] who wouldn't open their spirit to
[37:09] something fun like that
[37:13] music
[37:14] has a way
[37:16] of dismantling
[37:17] your thinking process
[37:23] and all of you know that's true right
[37:25] so we have to choose the music with us
[37:27] and do because whether it's christian
[37:29] music whether it's the choir singing or
[37:31] whether it's the wrong kind of music it
[37:33] still has a way of opening us up
[37:35] emotionally
[37:37] hopefully the choir is anointed enough
[37:39] to open your emotions that's not the
[37:40] wrong part about it opening your
[37:42] emotions to get your heart ready for the
[37:44] word that you open and receive and we
[37:46] were able to worship god freely that you
[37:48] lay everything else down all your
[37:50] troubles down and you open your spirit
[37:52] to receive the seed of god even if
[37:54] you've got a block up towards the word
[37:56] music can dismantle that should be all
[37:58] more open to hearing the word
[38:01] can i get any help this
[38:02] morning satan has known that from the
[38:05] very beginning so his music and his
[38:08] hollywood has an agenda to use that tool
[38:11] to open your spirit i need to laugh a
[38:13] little i need to break down life is too
[38:16] much pressure so i'm going to escape
[38:17] into this movie but be careful be
[38:20] careful i'm not against all of it but
[38:21] i'm just saying be careful what you're
[38:23] dismounting in your emotions and your
[38:25] laughter be careful the message that's
[38:28] coming through
[38:36] praise the lord
[38:38] laodicea i'm going to get off of it now
[38:40] which some are happy i'm getting off of
[38:42] it just chew on what i said
[38:46] we're in a different world than what we
[38:47] were even 20 years ago
[38:51] and these are the important things you
[38:52] need to look at in your life
[38:55] can you say man
[38:57] i think we should do everything around
[38:58] this church to keep our kids
[39:00] safe physically the congregation's safe
[39:03] physically
[39:04] how many agree with me
[39:06] that is my
[39:08] i'm telling you
[39:09] that is our motive to keep our children
[39:11] safe
[39:12] but there are more damaging things that
[39:14] happen through movies
[39:20] so i'm just asking you to examine if
[39:22] we're in the protection of our children
[39:25] then let's go the whole gamut
[39:28] and watch everything
[39:30] because
[39:31] we could protect them from a gun
[39:35] but we also need to predict them from
[39:36] what's getting in their minds
[39:45] praise the lord
[39:47] laodicea was a city and not just the
[39:50] prophecy of the age we live in but it
[39:52] was a city
[39:53] and possibly this is why paul uses the
[39:56] things of being
[39:58] naked
[39:59] and being
[40:00] poor
[40:02] and being blind
[40:03] because i found out that
[40:06] gold and clothing and ice have
[40:09] represent three major industries in the
[40:11] city of laodicea
[40:14] new inventions come in ioc that they
[40:16] didn't have before new isaf came there
[40:18] was a there was a scientist or a man who
[40:20] developed something because it was
[40:21] trouble with the eyes and so it was
[40:23] laodicea
[40:24] that a man was inspired to develop
[40:27] something that he he could actually and
[40:29] become
[40:30] it became used throughout throughout
[40:32] after that time because it said so they
[40:34] could go to this i don't know if they
[40:35] called him an eye doctor but he has this
[40:37] i savvy developed and if they had this
[40:40] he could put this on and it was helping
[40:42] their vision
[40:45] it was also that
[40:47] that their industries were banking
[40:49] money
[40:50] textiles and medicines
[40:53] laodicea
[40:55] had major industries
[40:58] of
[40:59] gold
[41:00] clothing
[41:01] and medicines
[41:04] this writer says gold spiritual riches
[41:06] contrast with
[41:07] poor and fire symbolizes trial so god
[41:10] advises the church to obtain spiritual
[41:12] riches
[41:13] produced through trials which the
[41:16] self-sufficient laodiceans avoid by
[41:18] compromising we're gonna there
[41:20] laodicea would give us some things to
[41:23] avoid going through trials to avoid to
[41:25] make a convenient life to make a
[41:27] comfortable life i want to be a
[41:29] christian but i don't want to be
[41:30] persecuted for it i want to live the
[41:32] word but i don't want to wear something
[41:34] that would maybe bring a laughing at me
[41:36] or being put down
[41:38] it's all right in this age we got you
[41:40] covered
[41:41] i'll give you a christian life you don't
[41:43] have to worry about that and you'll
[41:44] never get
[41:46] persecuted friends i'm telling you this
[41:48] morning i never expected to just be this
[41:50] straight i hate being this straight it's
[41:52] just the lord moving me just now
[41:55] i'm good this may be my last sermon
[42:01] i'm not preaching at anybody in
[42:03] particular i'm preaching to all of us
[42:05] and if this is the last sermon that i
[42:07] preached god help us to call for revival
[42:09] in our hearts and have our eyes anointed
[42:11] with eyesight
[42:13] [Applause]
[42:16] white garments contrast their nakedness
[42:19] clothing helps us to distinguish people
[42:20] in groups because of the differences
[42:22] between men and women's clothing sexual
[42:24] distinctions can be made amen clothing
[42:27] provides a measure of comfort and
[42:28] protection from the elements it hides
[42:30] shame clothing hides shame it hides
[42:32] deformity
[42:34] biblically god uses this symbol of
[42:36] righteousness he instructs the later
[42:38] scene to dress himself in the holiness
[42:40] of god to cover his spiritual nakedness
[42:42] and self-righteousness you can't clothe
[42:45] yourself spiritually with your own
[42:46] self-righteousness god said that won't
[42:49] work it says filthy rags
[42:52] but because of your nakedness
[42:53] spiritually i'll provide you with the
[42:55] clothes spiritually to address yourself
[42:57] in through the word dress yourself in
[42:59] the word
[43:02] take his righteousness over your own
[43:05] i'll give you true riches can you say
[43:07] amen i said it a couple services ago i
[43:09] can't remember now when it was but you
[43:12] if you're blessed in this message to
[43:13] have the word of god in the last days
[43:15] and you love it and you worship the lord
[43:17] on this then you are a spiritual
[43:18] billionaire you are a rich man
[43:21] you are a rich woman can you say man
[43:23] not because of how much money you have
[43:25] in the bank and how much your ira is can
[43:28] you say man we're rich spiritually
[43:30] because what god has provided in this
[43:32] age
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:34] you're a rich woman
[43:37] some of you wives say we're so poor we
[43:39] don't have any money for me to go get
[43:41] the things i'd like to get i'm saying
[43:43] the women because
[43:44] you know there's always something else
[43:46] that she
[43:47] needs
[43:49] or wants and it's not a bad thing it's
[43:51] not
[43:52] for me in my house when i was when i got
[43:54] married it's a good thing i married
[43:56] somebody because i would still just have
[43:58] basic things in there like one chair
[44:01] a cupboard full of mac and cheese
[44:06] the toilet works
[44:08] the bed and you don't really need to
[44:10] wash the sheets but maybe every couple
[44:11] months
[44:14] i'm told in myself didn't i
[44:17] just the basics that's it that's all you
[44:19] need
[44:21] but thank god for a wife that comes and
[44:22] says hey you need some things
[44:26] now i have this home and i have all this
[44:28] other and it's beautiful and it's
[44:29] decorated
[44:31] that's so much nicer
[44:33] matter of fact we have too much stuff
[44:35] and i won't get into that
[44:42] some of you wonder why my wife is still
[44:43] with me after all these weeks of saying
[44:45] these things
[44:46] she must love me
[44:48] but man i wouldn't trade it for anything
[44:49] in the world because you see and so i
[44:51] say
[44:52] there's always something else that she
[44:54] said we need this and we need that some
[44:55] of it needs some of its wants but that
[44:57] this is this is the laodicean the city
[45:01] they they said
[45:03] we see the need
[45:05] that the people need more money so we're
[45:08] going to provide loans and we're going
[45:10] to provide gold and we're going to
[45:11] provide
[45:12] banking a greater banking system because
[45:15] there's a need for more things laodicea
[45:17] was doing that that was the industry
[45:20] how many say this is our age
[45:23] and then the fashions become up in
[45:25] different clothing to distinguish men
[45:27] and make them prettier and all these
[45:29] other things that happened and they
[45:30] would see you and then paul says but
[45:32] wait a minute the church age you as a
[45:34] church in laodicea and the age that's
[45:36] going to come is going to have an
[45:37] emphasis on fashion and people will be
[45:40] emphasizing what they wear
[45:43] and besides that they'll be dressed in
[45:45] their own self-righteousness
[45:48] but when they're dressed in that they're
[45:50] naked
[45:52] they're not clothed right
[45:57] praise the lord he's still with me
[45:59] it's only 12 34 man i've got a half hour
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:04] and then and then the spiritual
[46:06] blindness
[46:08] a scientist or whoever did said in the
[46:10] city of laodicea
[46:12] develops an eye salve that's helping the
[46:15] people
[46:16] so the theme is
[46:19] laodicea could provide replacements for
[46:22] all their conditions of laodicea money
[46:24] and fashions and medicines
[46:27] we got you covered so paul used this
[46:30] god he said we'll provide you your need
[46:32] in these conditions not laodicea
[46:35] possessions and more money isn't always
[46:37] the answer following the latest fashions
[46:42] more medicated with things than
[46:43] believing in divine healing and you know
[46:45] i say that respectfully and the reason i
[46:47] say it respectfully about medicines he
[46:48] says because brother branham said god
[46:51] has allowed science god can use a
[46:54] medicine to be able to help you
[46:56] but the healing comes from god
[46:59] and don't ever lose sight of god being
[47:01] able to provide complete healing because
[47:04] if we don't believe that we become too
[47:06] dependent on the medicines
[47:09] that's what laodicea did you don't need
[47:11] to go to god you don't need to pray you
[47:14] don't need to ask god you don't need to
[47:15] have the pastor lay hands on you you
[47:17] don't need it you need more money we'll
[47:19] get you more money you need more
[47:21] fashions of the world we'll put out all
[47:23] the fashion magazines we'll change you
[47:25] every week
[47:27] can you say amen
[47:30] you need something for your eyes we'll
[47:32] give you something for your eyes
[47:34] so that you don't have to turn to god
[47:38] until they said
[47:40] we're good
[47:44] we're good we have need of nothing
[47:49] amen i could go home right now from this
[47:52] service
[47:53] and that house that's five minutes away
[47:56] be burnt to the ground
[48:00] and we know that for your home too
[48:02] there is no stability here we have no
[48:04] continuing city let's not trust in
[48:07] laodicea's riches let's not trust in
[48:09] laodicea's medicines
[48:12] [Applause]
[48:13] i'm not saying go off your medicine i'm
[48:14] not saying any of that i'm just saying
[48:16] let's not trust in it so much that it
[48:18] replaces
[48:20] you're depressed
[48:24] i got some new movies for you to watch
[48:27] that'll lift your spirits
[48:32] oh my
[48:37] following the latest fashions medicated
[48:39] with divine medicating without divine
[48:41] healing will never fill the craving for
[48:43] your spiritual walk did you know that
[48:46] entertainment music fashions sex
[48:49] cyber friends a boyfriend a girlfriend
[48:52] will never fill the craving
[48:55] for god in your life
[48:59] don't ever try to lean towards that
[49:00] fulfilling the craving for god
[49:02] god doesn't give you a boyfriend to fill
[49:05] your craving for the holy ghost and more
[49:07] of god
[49:09] that there wasn't god that did that
[49:12] you put the kingdom first and you're
[49:14] craving for god and you're satisfied in
[49:16] the lord completely and you wait for god
[49:19] to provide the right mate
[49:21] and he'll provide that too
[49:24] i'm going to say it again entertainment
[49:26] music fashions sex cyber friends
[49:29] boyfriend
[49:30] girlfriends
[49:32] will never fill the craving for your
[49:34] spiritual walk
[49:37] you know a few weeks ago i was delving
[49:39] into the thought life a little bit i
[49:41] think it's good to mention here again
[49:42] because
[49:44] we can talk about our thought life but
[49:46] beca because most things enter our fault
[49:49] life
[49:50] how do we know that most things enter
[49:52] our thought life
[49:53] through the eyes or through our hearing
[49:57] so once it gets in there and gets lodged
[49:59] in there then it becomes a part of our
[50:01] thought life but it came through a gate
[50:04] usually usually now i know we can get
[50:07] thoughts from satan and different things
[50:08] but usually things come through the gate
[50:10] of the eye the eye is the gate to the
[50:12] soul the eye is the gate to the spirit
[50:14] it's been said and so uh the eyes they
[50:16] get so so physically seeing something
[50:19] can connect with your spirit that's the
[50:20] thing about physical eyesight
[50:22] being connected with spiritual eyesight
[50:25] because what you see physically
[50:27] what you see physically
[50:29] can connect with your spirit and your
[50:32] mind
[50:34] so you see something
[50:36] but the message of it and the spirit of
[50:38] it can connect with your spirit and get
[50:40] lodged in your thought life get lodged
[50:42] in your spirit it's amazing how that
[50:44] kind of ties together and maybe that's
[50:45] why as brother boaz was bringing out the
[50:47] gates all the gates that's around the
[50:49] city for protection are gates of memory
[50:51] imagination conscience affection that's
[50:53] got to be sanctified by god and put
[50:55] under his control
[50:56] why why because because it is an inlet
[51:00] to get into your inner city
[51:03] so we can't just say i can just watch
[51:05] anything i want to watch no not really
[51:08] because over time it's going to affect
[51:10] you
[51:12] spiritually
[51:13] get enlarged in your mind get lodged in
[51:15] your heart
[51:18] and everything i'm saying here is all
[51:19] science proved
[51:22] even social media recently they're
[51:24] saying the damage it's done to teenagers
[51:26] social media
[51:30] so physically seeing can connect with
[51:32] our spirit and get lodged in our mind
[51:34] that's pretty powerful can you say amen
[51:36] that's pretty powerful
[51:39] i'd like to mention as i'm trying to
[51:41] draw this down now i'd like to mention a
[51:43] very essential service that the prophet
[51:46] of this hour preached in 1965
[51:48] very
[51:49] god revealing something very very
[51:52] important to this generation and the
[51:54] title of it if you want to listen to it
[51:58] is
[51:59] in shreveport 1965
[52:02] i have heard
[52:05] but now i see
[52:07] just the title if you just pray about
[52:09] the title i have heard of thee and he's
[52:12] quoting from job who said i have heard
[52:15] of thee
[52:16] by the hearing of the ear
[52:19] but now job says i see thee
[52:25] what an important thing
[52:28] that there is a it's incredible
[52:30] thing that the prophet through the lord
[52:32] would present
[52:34] that a christian
[52:36] can go many many years
[52:38] and hear
[52:40] and be filled with the knowledge of god
[52:42] and fill their mind with the message and
[52:44] fill their mind with the knowledge of
[52:46] god
[52:47] but they don't see it yet
[52:55] and were they christians before yes
[52:58] was job a christian before he's seen
[53:00] spiritually yes
[53:03] faithful christian serving the lord
[53:05] bringing sacrifices for his children
[53:07] doing his dutiful things just doing
[53:09] everything he could a man that god so
[53:12] trusted that satan said let me have him
[53:14] i'll make him curse you to your face and
[53:16] god so trusted the son of god said go
[53:19] adam don't take his life but you can
[53:20] take everything else i trust this man
[53:23] he's a faithful man i pray that god says
[53:25] that about me
[53:29] but yet but yet there was something that
[53:31] he needed
[53:32] needed to be revealed further that he
[53:35] couldn't see because when the trial
[53:36] first happened he had he had he had been
[53:39] uh
[53:40] in relationship with god he had done
[53:42] everything he knew remember there's no
[53:43] bible back then so he's just going on
[53:46] just you know god inspired him this is
[53:48] what needs to be done he probably
[53:49] thought back into
[53:51] uh the sacrifice at the beginning and
[53:53] he's seen because of history he knew
[53:55] that cain brought the wrong sacrifice of
[53:57] fruits abel brought the right one of a
[53:59] sacrifice blood is what gets us back to
[54:02] god so he took that says if i'm going to
[54:04] have my sins
[54:05] of my children and me taken care of i'm
[54:07] going to keep bringing sacrifices i'm
[54:09] going to bring extra ones i'm going to
[54:10] pray for my kids maybe they haven't
[54:12] sinned now but maybe they're going to
[54:14] sin what a daddy maybe they haven't
[54:15] sinned today but in the future i'm
[54:17] bringing this sacrifice in case they sin
[54:19] god holds your wrath back from them what
[54:21] a daddy
[54:22] it's the way this man lived and yet it's
[54:25] not till the last chapter of his book
[54:28] that he says i have heard of thee all
[54:30] these years
[54:32] by the hearing of the year
[54:34] but now i see ye
[54:36] i see it i see thee
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:42] i just talked to someone this week
[54:45] and
[54:46] and i talked to a lot of people but this
[54:48] is just brings it fresh to me and that
[54:51] that grown up all these years in the
[54:53] message
[54:55] and someone so honest is to say this
[54:57] believers saying so honest to say from
[54:59] five six seven years old
[55:01] i know this thing i know the quotes i
[55:04] know what we're supposed to do i know
[55:08] what we're supposed to do what we're
[55:09] supposed to not do just filled with it
[55:11] goes on comes into marriage comes
[55:12] everything and feel it and i just
[55:14] realized he said i realize
[55:16] that i i know it all
[55:19] by head knowledge
[55:21] but he said still something has to
[55:24] happen in me
[55:27] because obviously i'm missing something
[55:29] thank god
[55:31] for honesty
[55:33] because they recognize god still loves
[55:36] me
[55:37] i still love god
[55:39] but they're honest enough to say
[55:41] i still got a lot of this as information
[55:44] and i've been going through and doing it
[55:46] praise god for that but i have to be
[55:49] honest with i'm not seeing something if
[55:52] my life is bringing forth private fruits
[55:54] that aren't wrong
[55:56] excuse me aren't right fruits of my life
[55:58] that aren't right then i'm lacking
[55:59] something no matter how much knowledge i
[56:01] have of this message no matter how much
[56:03] i say i believe god sent a prophet no
[56:06] matter how much i acknowledge it i'm
[56:08] saying lord i'm not seeing something yet
[56:10] because if i seed it there'll be
[56:12] different fruits from my life
[56:17] thank god for that type of honesty
[56:20] instead of smearing on this message and
[56:22] say i'm okay
[56:25] i'm good
[56:27] i want to get into a sermon
[56:29] here's another one of my sermons
[56:31] well i got such good response right now
[56:32] i might just drop into that one for the
[56:34] next hour
[56:36] oh
[56:38] to see jesus
[56:41] give the parable of a man
[56:43] a pharisee who comes into the temple
[56:47] and says lord i'm
[56:50] there's a sinner over there in the
[56:51] corner hiding
[56:53] and he said lord i'm thankful that i'm
[56:55] not like that sinner over there
[57:02] i'm thankful i'm not like him
[57:04] and then he gives all his stuff that
[57:05] he's makes him a good person
[57:08] self-focused all selfless all his own
[57:10] righteousness this is not an unbeliever
[57:12] this person believe in jehovah god
[57:15] he said lord i'm thankful i'm not that
[57:18] i pay my tithes
[57:19] i give i do these things he lists the
[57:22] things that he does
[57:23] and it's just you know there is nothing
[57:26] in there in humility whatsoever
[57:32] and then
[57:33] when he's done
[57:35] there's there's a
[57:36] there's a guy over and the bible says he
[57:39] doesn't even feel worthy to even lift
[57:41] his head up to god
[57:43] and he's smiting his chest saying god
[57:46] please
[57:48] have mercy on me a sinner
[57:55] that's the difference
[57:59] and that's all he said
[58:00] he was he wasn't bringing anything
[58:03] he wasn't trying to impress god
[58:06] he wasn't saying i'm i'm okay okay so
[58:08] i'm just
[58:10] it was
[58:10] zero zero she's asking for one thing i
[58:13] need your mercy
[58:16] lord i don't want your justice because
[58:17] if i get your justice i'm finished
[58:21] because i've heard that you have mercy
[58:23] i'm asking for mercy
[58:24] that's it there's nothing more to it
[58:27] i don't want to preach my sermon because
[58:28] it's i believe it's going to be really
[58:30] come out bring out some things
[58:32] but uh just know this it's about
[58:34] justification
[58:36] because that man's trying to justify
[58:38] himself before god
[58:40] and this man's trying to get
[58:41] justification before god
[58:45] and he get he's hoping to get it through
[58:48] his own i'm good
[58:51] and this person's just saying
[58:53] i need you lord
[58:55] i need you lord right now
[59:00] i just need your mercy
[59:02] jesus says after the parable
[59:07] lord jesus
[59:10] that's why i've been saying lately
[59:12] people are complicating this so much
[59:16] you on the internet and you hear today
[59:19] many years people have complicated this
[59:21] message so much
[59:23] and confuse people so much and i'm not
[59:25] here to take stabs at anybody i'm just
[59:27] saying what i want for you as a
[59:28] congregation for you
[59:30] under our leadership
[59:33] i just want that simple relationship
[59:35] with the lord
[59:39] and i want to say to him this morning
[59:40] lord
[59:42] if i'm to come to adoption and all these
[59:44] glorious things that you said the bride
[59:46] would come to and i'd go all these other
[59:47] things
[59:49] then
[59:50] i'm asking just for one thing that
[59:52] you'll give me mercy to go there
[59:55] that's all i'm asking for
[59:58] if we're close to a rapture and this is
[1:00:00] the last sermon i preach i'm just asking
[1:00:02] for god's mercy
[1:00:05] rapturing faith to get me into a man
[1:00:06] into a rapture
[1:00:09] there's too much pride in this message
[1:00:15] there's too much self-righteousness
[1:00:21] jesus says
[1:00:24] that this this publican this sinner
[1:00:28] it's all about justification
[1:00:30] how many knows that the message restored
[1:00:31] the truth of justification
[1:00:33] invisible union
[1:00:36] we're enjoying the glories of the truth
[1:00:38] of justification that means to be
[1:00:40] completely cleared by god
[1:00:42] he never did it in the first place
[1:00:45] how do you get it
[1:00:48] jesus said this man
[1:00:50] went back to his house justified
[1:00:55] and this man didn't
[1:00:58] this man went back to his house
[1:01:00] with his own
[1:01:03] justification and he was seeking gods
[1:01:06] but he didn't get it
[1:01:08] because he was good in his own i'm good
[1:01:12] but he didn't go home with justification
[1:01:15] i would love for every person here
[1:01:18] to go home
[1:01:19] and they brought repentance before god
[1:01:21] say god i heard your word today
[1:01:25] brother braham says the cry the zeal of
[1:01:27] the end time is to repent
[1:01:30] and i laid my life in that service
[1:01:31] before you and i didn't bring anything
[1:01:34] to impress everybody i just need god
[1:01:37] and i really need him i don't know about
[1:01:38] everybody else but i just need him
[1:01:41] i'm weak without him
[1:01:43] and i would love for you to go home
[1:01:46] with the peace in your heart
[1:01:47] that god
[1:01:48] has justified you
[1:01:52] what a tragedy when people go home from
[1:01:53] services and they didn't even get
[1:01:56] they didn't get what they needed
[1:01:58] just got head knowledge
[1:02:00] but i'd love for everybody to go home
[1:02:02] because they just fully
[1:02:05] and they got you know i feel god has
[1:02:07] forgiven me
[1:02:09] i feel
[1:02:11] he's justified me
[1:02:14] because i just brought it to god
[1:02:19] i
[1:02:20] i don't know
[1:02:22] about these services the last few weeks
[1:02:25] i said lord i just want to preach it
[1:02:29] i just want to be fiery and i want to
[1:02:31] bring something that
[1:02:32] makes us swing from the rafters
[1:02:38] and it just gets so solid
[1:02:40] i'm sorry friends it just gets so it's
[1:02:43] it's i don't want surface things for you
[1:02:48] i don't want surface things for me i
[1:02:50] want him to go deep
[1:02:56] and so
[1:02:59] if you were to separate job's life the
[1:03:01] last chapter is when he said i have
[1:03:03] heard but now i see
[1:03:06] long about in job 19 he has a revelation
[1:03:10] if we were to separate now i don't have
[1:03:12] the right to do this but if we were
[1:03:13] looking at timeline
[1:03:15] after job's trial he comes to after his
[1:03:18] comforters are telling them things and
[1:03:19] you know if you read job but in 19 job
[1:03:22] 19 25 he said that's where he says i
[1:03:25] know my redeemer liveth
[1:03:28] and now now i will stand with him on
[1:03:30] that day
[1:03:31] i will stay shall stand on and in the
[1:03:34] last days
[1:03:36] he shall stand at the latter day upon
[1:03:38] the earth and i'll stand with him he has
[1:03:40] a revelation that he's a predestinated
[1:03:43] seed
[1:03:44] and if if the skin worms destroy this
[1:03:47] body yet in my flesh i'll see god i'm
[1:03:50] going to see him someday i'm going to
[1:03:52] see him someday can you say praise the
[1:03:54] lord what a revelation
[1:03:56] because i have a redeemer
[1:03:58] because i have somebody that stood in my
[1:04:00] place he's going to stand in the last
[1:04:02] days and guess what i'm going to stand
[1:04:04] with him
[1:04:07] what a revelation
[1:04:09] in job 19 the revelation that'll take
[1:04:11] you through a trial i might die and skin
[1:04:13] worms destroy this body but listen i'm
[1:04:15] not finished when i die because i have a
[1:04:17] redeemer
[1:04:21] i have a substitute for my sin
[1:04:23] i know my redeemer liveth i have someone
[1:04:26] who'll stand with me
[1:04:28] by revelation he's seen himself in the
[1:04:30] last days with christ and will
[1:04:32] physically see his god that's the future
[1:04:35] but in the last chapter it's a spiritual
[1:04:37] eyesight because evidently before he
[1:04:40] didn't see but he says i have heard of
[1:04:42] thee
[1:04:43] but now i see thee it's a spiritual
[1:04:46] eyesight he got
[1:04:48] i'm going to throw you a little curve
[1:04:50] here before i close
[1:04:52] and i'm going to have you go to job 31
[1:04:54] i'm aware of the time i run children
[1:04:58] getting
[1:04:59] antsy
[1:05:01] god bless you children
[1:05:05] young teens and young kids hey thanks
[1:05:08] for sitting quietly and listening to
[1:05:10] brother paul
[1:05:11] god will bless you for it thank you
[1:05:15] it's good he's living his thumb up thank
[1:05:17] you guys
[1:05:19] god will bless you for it
[1:05:23] what was it oh job 31
[1:05:26] so
[1:05:27] this is interesting
[1:05:29] so you got
[1:05:30] he has a revelation that he'll be with
[1:05:32] him in the last days and his redeemer
[1:05:34] will save him at the end of the i have
[1:05:37] heard but now i see he gets his eyes are
[1:05:38] open spiritually that he can see christ
[1:05:41] and he can see things but here in the
[1:05:44] middle he says something i'm just
[1:05:45] throwing a little curve here okay here
[1:05:46] in the middle he says something
[1:05:49] job 31 i made a covenant with mine eyes
[1:05:55] why then should i think upon a maid
[1:06:00] that's a virgin
[1:06:01] or a woman
[1:06:03] that's not his wife
[1:06:09] so it's easier for me to preach some of
[1:06:11] you maybe you shut me down but it's
[1:06:13] easier to preach about
[1:06:16] job proclaiming i know my redeemer
[1:06:18] liveth i shall stand with him in the
[1:06:20] last days
[1:06:22] i can preach i have heard thee but now i
[1:06:24] see thee with my eyes praise the lord
[1:06:27] but this scripture isn't really preached
[1:06:29] on too much and yet this is a part of
[1:06:31] job's spiritual life
[1:06:36] that job had to make a covenant
[1:06:39] with his eyes
[1:06:42] that he would not look upon
[1:06:44] another woman that was not his wife
[1:06:49] this is job i heard about joel's trials
[1:06:51] heard about job's comforters
[1:06:54] i heard about job's daughters
[1:06:56] heard about job job jumped up job
[1:06:59] he knows his redeemer what a revelation
[1:07:05] but i didn't hear too many sermons in
[1:07:06] the message about
[1:07:08] job made
[1:07:09] in the process he made a covenant with
[1:07:11] his eyes
[1:07:12] that he wouldn't look upon a young young
[1:07:15] maid
[1:07:19] so
[1:07:22] this is another
[1:07:23] step in a man's life
[1:07:26] and the whole chapter is about a eyes
[1:07:28] looking at a woman if you continue on
[1:07:31] verse two for what portion of god is
[1:07:32] therefore
[1:07:33] from above and what inheritance of the
[1:07:35] almighty from on high is not destruction
[1:07:37] to the wicked or
[1:07:39] strange punishment to the workers of
[1:07:40] iniquity doth not he see my ways and
[1:07:43] count all my steps
[1:07:45] if i have walked with vanity or if my
[1:07:47] foot have hasted to deceit let me be
[1:07:49] weighed in an even balance that god may
[1:07:51] know mine integrity if my step hath
[1:07:54] turned out of the way and my heart
[1:07:56] walked after mine eyes he said if i live
[1:08:00] i'm a believer
[1:08:02] i know my redeemer liveth but if i walk
[1:08:06] if i walked after mine own eyes
[1:08:09] and if any blot out hath cleaved to my
[1:08:11] hands then let me sow and let another
[1:08:14] eat let my offspring be rooted out you
[1:08:16] know what job's saying
[1:08:18] i'm a believer
[1:08:21] but if i walk with my eyes guiding me in
[1:08:23] this world
[1:08:25] and i don't make a covenant with my eyes
[1:08:27] i come under the same
[1:08:29] sowing and reaping
[1:08:31] as anybody else
[1:08:36] in other words i'm a believer but i'm
[1:08:38] not in a different category when it
[1:08:41] comes to my flesh
[1:08:42] i got to bring it under subjection just
[1:08:45] like anybody else
[1:08:47] he goes so far to make an agreement with
[1:08:48] his eyes
[1:08:49] that's what a covenant is it's an
[1:08:51] agreement with his eyes anybody ever
[1:08:53] made an agreement with your eyes
[1:08:55] today i make an agreement with my eyes
[1:08:58] that i won't look at certain things
[1:09:00] because i know that's destructive to
[1:09:01] everything in my life i know that the
[1:09:04] eye is the gate to the soul so i'm
[1:09:06] making a covenant i make an agreement
[1:09:08] with my eyes
[1:09:11] that i will not look at certain things
[1:09:14] and when i see it i will turn my head
[1:09:18] because i not only have a covenant with
[1:09:20] god i not only have brought sacrifices i
[1:09:23] not only go to church to brother paul's
[1:09:26] church but when i'm home and when i'm by
[1:09:28] myself i make a covenant with my eyes
[1:09:36] amen
[1:09:40] all the same fruits will come from my
[1:09:42] life god will judge me the same way
[1:09:45] i don't get special treatment
[1:09:47] if i'm letting my eyes guide my life and
[1:09:49] look at the wrong things no special
[1:09:51] treatment because i grew up in the
[1:09:52] message
[1:09:54] i'm losing amen but it's probably
[1:09:55] because you're tired
[1:09:57] we're not under special treatment
[1:10:01] because we grew up in the message
[1:10:04] or because we know we're predestinated
[1:10:09] so
[1:10:10] he for worldly things especially a man
[1:10:12] looking at a woman other than his wife
[1:10:14] makes a covenant with his eyes
[1:10:16] i'm i'm saying the revelation job had is
[1:10:18] that the eye the gate to the soul was so
[1:10:21] powerful that he says i have to make a
[1:10:23] covenant with it before my lord
[1:10:28] verse nine if mine heart had been
[1:10:29] deceived by a woman
[1:10:31] or if i laid weight because remember the
[1:10:33] theme here is a woman other than his
[1:10:34] wife if my heart have been deceived by a
[1:10:36] woman or if i've laid weight at my
[1:10:38] neighbor's door then let my wife grind
[1:10:40] unto another and let others bow down
[1:10:43] upon her in other words i don't deserve
[1:10:45] to have a wife that's serving me
[1:10:47] correctly
[1:10:49] if i'm not if i'm looking at other women
[1:10:53] let her grind for another man
[1:10:55] because i don't deserve her i don't love
[1:10:56] her right
[1:11:02] for this is a
[1:11:03] heinous am i saying that right
[1:11:07] this is a heinous crime yea it is a
[1:11:10] iniquity to be punished by the judges
[1:11:13] for it is a fire that consumeth to
[1:11:15] destruction and would root out all mine
[1:11:18] increase
[1:11:19] what
[1:11:20] looking at women that you shouldn't look
[1:11:22] at
[1:11:24] it's
[1:11:24] heinous
[1:11:26] it's
[1:11:27] it's true it's terrible
[1:11:36] what a way to end this service but i
[1:11:38] must say
[1:11:47] our eyes can see many things in our
[1:11:49] world
[1:11:50] and be hindered
[1:11:53] but without a doubt
[1:11:55] the most destructive evil forces
[1:11:58] in our culture
[1:12:00] is pornography
[1:12:07] and sexual sin outside of marriage
[1:12:09] whether seeing it
[1:12:11] or doing it
[1:12:18] believe it or not that's my last
[1:12:20] thing i typed in in my notes
[1:12:22] and i really don't know how to end the
[1:12:23] service now
[1:12:26] how do you end a service like that
[1:12:29] except for maybe saying
[1:12:31] nobody talks about it very much
[1:12:33] but it certainly is a destructive force
[1:12:36] sometimes in people's lives
[1:12:40] because our pride has given us
[1:12:41] permission to look at privately anything
[1:12:44] that we want to look at
[1:12:46] and watch anything we want to look
[1:12:48] at and it's destructive for marriages
[1:12:51] for families
[1:12:54] for children
[1:12:56] it's sodom and gomorrah
[1:12:59] say how many scriptures do you have
[1:13:00] going on that's all through the bible
[1:13:02] including the first destruction by water
[1:13:05] the ark
[1:13:07] and what was the problem the sons of god
[1:13:10] saw the daughters of men that they were
[1:13:13] pretty
[1:13:16] and then with the accumulation of their
[1:13:18] imagination and their violence and all
[1:13:20] this evil is where god says my goodness
[1:13:24] i'm just going to have to destroy the
[1:13:25] whole thing
[1:13:28] but
[1:13:30] i'll give grace to my prophet
[1:13:34] god always makes a way of escape
[1:13:39] so the escape was i'll send a prophet
[1:13:42] i'll have him build an ark
[1:13:44] because they can't get out of this
[1:13:45] themselves they are so bound by the
[1:13:48] pornographic messages by the beauty of
[1:13:51] women
[1:13:52] marriages are tore apart the families
[1:13:54] are tore apart
[1:13:55] it's a private thing that's going on but
[1:13:56] it's come to their imagination and
[1:13:58] they're actually becoming violent do you
[1:13:59] know the two are tied together
[1:14:03] you know anger
[1:14:04] some of anger is tied together the
[1:14:06] private sin going on it makes a man not
[1:14:09] free or a woman not free because i want
[1:14:11] to just preach at the men
[1:14:12] women sometimes are into this
[1:14:16] they said become violent violent you
[1:14:18] know how this world's become violence
[1:14:19] there's no control there's lawlessness
[1:14:22] they're walking into subways and just
[1:14:23] for no reason just killing an old woman
[1:14:25] in a subway just killing her just
[1:14:27] stabbing her
[1:14:29] and they can't be mad at that woman
[1:14:31] because the woman didn't do anything
[1:14:32] wrong but there's a festering anger
[1:14:35] and we got years of feeding on video
[1:14:37] games and
[1:14:39] pornography and this
[1:14:41] beast has risen up
[1:14:44] become violent
[1:14:46] i'm so under condemnation i'm so sick of
[1:14:49] myself i'm so sick that i can't be
[1:14:51] satisfied by any woman anymore now i
[1:14:53] gotta turn to a man i'm so blowing up
[1:14:56] that i've just got to take it out on
[1:14:57] somebody
[1:15:00] anger can have its root in the private
[1:15:02] things that's going on
[1:15:06] pornography is one of our
[1:15:08] greatest destructive things and it's in
[1:15:10] our culture
[1:15:12] the percentages in
[1:15:15] denominations you can read because we
[1:15:17] don't do polls in our own ranks
[1:15:22] the percentages are
[1:15:24] out the roof
[1:15:26] within the church
[1:15:33] and only because i deal with some things
[1:15:36] sometimes it's just
[1:15:37] lord when
[1:15:39] will preachers start talking about this
[1:15:41] from the word because
[1:15:43] there's more going on sometimes than
[1:15:45] what i'd really be comfortable with
[1:15:48] you're trying to fix problems and fix
[1:15:49] problems and then
[1:15:51] you realize here's the core
[1:15:55] and they haven't seen job said in my
[1:15:58] hour in my time and if i'm going to
[1:16:00] serve the lord
[1:16:02] the way i want to serve him
[1:16:04] i have to make a covenant
[1:16:06] an agreement
[1:16:08] with my eyes
[1:16:11] i love this message i love it people
[1:16:13] maybe think sometimes i'm taking i'm not
[1:16:15] taking stabs at the message itself
[1:16:17] there's nothing that's greater that's
[1:16:18] ever hit the face of the earth in the
[1:16:20] message of this hour
[1:16:24] but the reality is sometimes satan works
[1:16:26] in deceiving things
[1:16:28] in the undercurrents
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:32] privacy can't people be free why can't
[1:16:35] people free why can't why is it what are
[1:16:37] you feeding on what are you reading
[1:16:40] what are you looking at what are these
[1:16:41] eyes seeing
[1:16:45] so i can't talk about victory and the
[1:16:47] glories of the word
[1:16:50] unless we talk about what our eyes are
[1:16:52] really looking at
[1:16:56] praise god for people here has made a
[1:16:57] covenant with their eyes already
[1:17:00] god bless you and god bless you that are
[1:17:03] catching it by what i'm preaching
[1:17:05] that you're going to say lord i just
[1:17:07] need your mercy
[1:17:10] i need your grace i need help
[1:17:12] i need you lord right now
[1:17:15] that's when we become justified before
[1:17:17] god
[1:17:18] when we're honest when we're open he
[1:17:20] said i need you or i'm going to be
[1:17:23] caught in this laodicean thing
[1:17:25] the statistics and the denominations
[1:17:28] are pretty high for pornography and
[1:17:32] pretty high in ministers pastors
[1:17:35] pretty high
[1:17:37] so
[1:17:39] human nature is human nature
[1:17:42] right
[1:17:44] so i we don't take polls on my ranks i'm
[1:17:47] not going to do that but i'm just going
[1:17:48] to say
[1:17:49] we're called to something higher
[1:17:52] we're not called to be a laodicean
[1:17:55] we're not called to the age that we're
[1:17:56] living or call higher we're not called
[1:17:58] to be a part of those statistics what a
[1:18:00] shame if we were part of the same
[1:18:01] statistics
[1:18:03] but i'm not so sure it wouldn't be
[1:18:05] a bigger percentage and that's a shame
[1:18:07] we say lord you've called us to
[1:18:09] something higher than this
[1:18:11] so give us the answers give us your word
[1:18:13] give us the holy ghost fill us with your
[1:18:15] spirit
[1:18:17] lord i just need your mercy to change me
[1:18:22] amen amen
[1:18:24] praise the lord
[1:18:25] in our own ranks and here's another
[1:18:27] statistic 35 of protestant ministers
[1:18:30] resigned last year
[1:18:32] after the covet thing and the pressures
[1:18:35] 35 of protestant ministers resigned
[1:18:39] it's because of the times
[1:18:41] it's because of what we're going through
[1:18:43] and i can imagine it would be
[1:18:45] frustrating if you don't have any holy
[1:18:46] ghost there that you're preaching
[1:18:48] to change people's lives
[1:18:51] and you're seeing all this culture take
[1:18:52] hold in the peep you're saying oh god
[1:18:55] and you just give up the pressures of
[1:18:57] the coven the different opinions of
[1:18:59] covid that was part of it they're just
[1:19:01] saying hey you know what i'm done i'll
[1:19:03] go get a job at a auto place or whatever
[1:19:05] fix cars i don't have to deal with all
[1:19:08] this
[1:19:10] we're under an age of culture
[1:19:12] taking over laodicea taking over
[1:19:14] people's rights legacy taking over
[1:19:18] but what we really need is on every
[1:19:20] individual it's the simplicity of a
[1:19:23] submission to say i yield my life to the
[1:19:25] lord
[1:19:27] i have nothing to bring
[1:19:30] nothing to bring all my successes all
[1:19:32] the glories
[1:19:33] god done even god doing great things in
[1:19:35] your life i'm not bringing any of that
[1:19:38] because what it is is what you where you
