On March 26, 2023, Literal Life Church hosted a community outreach event, "Hymns and Classics Sing-Along". We pressed the record button that evening and received such positive response from the community afterward that we decided to make the audio recording available for free to the public. 

I Stand Amazed

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned, unclean

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song will ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them his very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
He suffered and died for me

Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love

Forever I will sing Your praise
Jesus, Risen King
Oh my God I stand amazed that You loved me

When with ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
It will be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me
