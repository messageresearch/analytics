victory belongs to Jesus Victory belongs to [Music] H oh the victory belongs to Jesus Victory belongs to Acts chapter 24 and uh this might a little lengthy reading but I'll go ahead and read it now uh verse 1-6 after 5 days ananas the high priest he descended with the elders and with a a certain orator named turus I don't know if I'm saying his name right but turus who informed the governor against Paul turus was a a lawyer hired by the priest hired by the Jews to come against Paul and to present the accusations against Paul and what they were saying that he did and they were trying to come against and take Paul out and finish him and they bring him before a Roman here and turus was the uh was the lawyer that they hired verse two and when he was called forth turus be to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy Deeds are done unto this nation by thy Providence we accept it always in our all places most noble Felix with all thankfulness so here's a good lawyer who's buttering bring up the judge and uh giv some compliments to him notwithstanding that I be not uh further tedious unto thee I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words for we have found this man Paul a a pestilent fellow uh that's a irritating fellow irritator and a mover of sedition among the Jews throughout the world and a ring leader of a sect of the nazarenes who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law but the chief Captain liasis Came Upon Us and with great violence took him away out of our hands commanding his accusers to come unto thee Felix by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him and the Jews also ascented saying that these things are true these things were so so everybody's agreeing Paul's standing here they got the lawyer they presented all the accusations and everybody's agreeing yes he's done these things then Paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered for as much as I know that thou Hast been of many years the judge under this nation I do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but 12 days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me but this I confess unto thee that after the way which is called heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward God which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the Dead both of the just and unjust in other words he's saying it says that in the law as well fellas and I believe all the law but I also believe that there's a resurrection of the Dead both the just and the unjust and herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men I I suppose we could say a conscious or heart free of condemnation is a subject we probably can't say too much about just simply because it's the main theme or the main thrust of the enemy he can bring sickness on you he could do a lot of things try to tear up your family but the main thing he focuses on is to get a Believer to question and have guilt and question and doubt who he is and who she is that's his main focus and if he if he does it to if he did it to Jesus then he'll do it to you how many knows he did it to Jesus he was the one that was trying to make Jesus question question whether he was the son of God imagine the arrogancy and the pride of this fell coming before Jesus the anointed Son of God and tempting him when he was hungry in the wilderness and making him bring up the question and say if thou be the Son of God he's bringing up that question in order to cause him to doubt and we know how Jesus responded there he come he come against the wrong person there because this is a man brother Braham said he had perfect Faith because he knew his place in the scripture can you say amen he knew where he stood he knew what he was there for there was no and when you know where you stand when you know you have confidence when you have no guilt no shame can you say Amen then you can stand against any devil and the devil can't penetrate himself to you and that's how Jesus was that's how we want to be is to have that kind of confidence and so it's him that comes and questions who we are it's him that brings the condemnation he's the author of lies he's the author of condemnation and this is the realm more than any other attack against the enemy and the bride in this age and against you more than any other thing is to bring condemnation and guilt and make you question and doubt the word and doubt who you are a lot of times I might say it a lot of times people are overwhelmed with all their pressures of Life they get alone too much they get overwhelmed with all the pressures of life and that's when the devil really hits them when they get alone and they have so many hits at the same time they can't just can't seem to process at all and then the devil brings up this thing well maybe I don't believe or maybe I'm not a Christian or something like that we got to know where we stand and as I said I don't think you can talk about a Christian being free of condemnation I don't think you can talk about it enough I believe we need victory in this I believe we need to walk in it every day because you're going to face an enemy that's going to come back at you again and again to try to bring guilt he he he the number one professional uh person to put a guilt trip on a Believer I know you got people you're thinking of probably right now that are Guilt Trip people can put a guilt trip on you you might be it might be the person next to you I don't know but people can put a guilt trip on you but there's nobody as professional at it as the enemy that's right and as I said Sunday he tries to put guilt on you even when you haven't done anything wrong that's pretty wicked can you say amen that's pretty sad so this is why we have to know where we stand so when when the deepest let me just say it this way when the deepest inner parts of us which is first of all your soul and then your heart what we spoke about Sunday which is the seed of your emotions we could say the conscience or the subconscious when you have when the the deepest inner parts of us the soul and the Heart Is emptied of all guilt and shame then I believe there stands a Christian at his very best I see Paul in that scripture a Christian at his very best he said I live and exercise a life that there's no offense there's no guilt before God there's no there's no shame and before men I won't let any man shame me I won't let any man falsely accuse me and he stood the very best now a lot of us would say the best of a Christian was is that he has Miracles and signs and wonders in the faith of Pentecost acting and doing these Mighty works and I believe believe that with all my heart I believe Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also the church will continue the works of Jesus Christ but how do we get to the faith to bring forth those works I guarantee you won't get to it with guilt on your heart I guarantee you won't get on a heart that's got all kinds of guilt and shame and condemnation you can't get to that kind of Faith so somehow the atonement washed all the guilt from the people in the upper room they were emptied out of everything all the guilt was gone all the shame was gone and now the faith kicks in to be like the Son of God that's why I'm preaching about this because we have to deal with this first before we come to the faith of the apostolic faith praise the Lord so I believe that's when a Christian that's when a Christian is at his very best you say where he's at his best when he's exercising all these Miracles he's at his best when he's standing there a Son of God free in his heart free in his mind free in his spirit I'm going to show you some places that this is echoed throughout the scripture and throughout the message especially throughout the message so this is a Christian at his very best and there's not much the devil can do when a Christian stands in that place there's he he can't penetrate this type of guilt-free this this type of lack of Shame there's no Shadows of doubt I know I who I am everything is under the blood of Jesus Christ he's pardoned me and I've accepted his pardon everything is under the blood there's nothing between people I've forgiven people and I'm standing here ready to be used by the Lord there's a vessel the devil's afraid of there's a vessel that the devil's going how how in the world am I going to get this guy down that's the very that's the Christian at his very best I'd say a Christian at his best is when the devil can't get anywhere with him and he says it in greatest battle ever fought he says when God can get a man in his hands till he can get his senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there now that seems unrealistic in this uh unbelieving age that we live in no Christian can live that close to God that's what Society tells you that's what the church can tell you nobody can live like the apostles but the word of God says we are to carry on the work of the Apostles and if he says a man can live that close to God with conscience cleaned out senses cleaned out till he stands with God behind it and the devil there's no devil that can poke a doubt in there I don't care how many unbelieving say Devils say that's not possible it's possible that I can live that there's no place for the devil to poke a doubt in you know us Believers we can reach for the stars because that's what God told Abraham his seed [Applause] was come on now your seed will be as the stars of Heaven first he says it'll be like the the sand but he says then it's going to go from dust to Stars you can reach for the stars and these these promises of the word because why you're the Stars you're Abraham's seed Hallelujah not movie stars Lord have mercy I don't want to be a movie star there's some of the most vile people some of the singers some of the most vile people on the face of the Earth you don't want to be like them spirits of Lucifer and spirits of all kinds of things that raise up stars and Divas like that we follow after them I tell you there's Sons and Daughters of God that are stars of God Abraham seed that's who I want to be that's the humble person I want to be in this face face of this Earth he go goes on to see it's your mind later in the quote he says it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it praise be to God now you're talking a Christian at his best state and the devil don't know how to mess with him it's wonderful so I love what Paul says here that he says I I stand with a conscience exercise myself you know when you use the word exercise you know what all of us Americans think of I make you think of the big gym and we think of exercis and we think of working out and we think if if you do that great uh it's a wonderful thing but we think of EX and we exercise us ourselves more in mental exercises and physical exercises we Americans tend to do that more than we do exercise ourself as the scripture says unto godliness but look at this one I ex this is a life of a Christian I exercise my self to have always a conscious void empty of offense toward God or toward men he says that's the way I've chosen to live I'm going to live that way I'm going to live without guilt there's going to be no offenses if there's something wrong I'm going to make it right right away and even people's accusations of me I will not let Lodge in my conscience God did I do it God forgive me did I hurt someone else go ask them for forgiveness it's done Washed by the blood of the lamb and I go the next moment clean by my Lord this is a lifestyle Paul lived I believe he was living his very best that he could say I could exercise to be free of guilt unmoved by any doubts about being accepted with God settled and also void of offense of men void of offense means this a conscience void of offense is a Guiltless conscience ience to be Guiltless means that all wrongdoings which were condemned by the conscience have been dealt with before God and have been forgiven by him I'm going to read that again it means to be guildless means that all wrongdoings which were condemned by the conscience now notice notice the devil if we make a mistakes our conscience is going to condemn us of course and we're going to feel conviction as well from the Lord conviction is a good thing but when conscience lingers and on when you've been forgiven then you've got to deal with the conscience say I've got to let God I got to take God's forgiveness here I've got to relieve my conscience so when we're condemned by our conscience that has the the wrongdoings have been dealt with before God they've been dealt with they're not lingering for years they're not hanging on you they have been dealt with before God and have been forgiven by God and what I've been preaching on lately it's not just God forgives us but it's us forgiving others it's dealt with deal with it deal with that all against a brother or sister deal with that unforgiving Spirit you got to you got to face it right and then he says hence there is no this is another writer or just the meaning of this a biblical meaning hence there is no more feeling my this is powerful this what this is what a conscious void of offense means there is no more feeling of guilt and condemnation resident in the conscience not that it's there not even a feeling would be left there of guilt why because we're supposed to live guilt-free that's right we're supposed to live guilt free so you got to realize in this incident with Paul there's false accusations and lies being told towards him in front of the whole uh the whole congregation there and all thew Jews that were accusing him and all the the high priest and Priests there wasn't any truth to what they were saying and they handed it off to a lawyer and he polished it up a bit like lawyers do and he made it sound real good to Felix and he presented this thing and he laid out about four or five things that Paul had done supposedly done and uh so you see now there's one thing to deal deal with what you've done wrong it's another thing to deal with guilt being put on you of what you have not done or things you have maybe been forgiven of already and Satan's bringing it back in this incident he hadn't done any of that right this was the enemy's lies against him now friends I'm emphasizing more that part because we should know by now if we make a mistake we bring it for for the Lord as I said Sunday brother Bri said I want to live such a sensitive life to the holy spirit that the least bit of grieving if I've grieved his spirit and if we're sensitive to the Lord we should know when we grieved his Spirit but I want to be sensitive that the least of the grieve I just feel like I grieved you Lord forgive me you go back through what did I say through the day what did I do Lord and you're quickly dealing with that so that's the realm we should be living in but there's a deeper thing there's a there's a deeper thing here of the accuser of the Brethren and other people being used of the accuser of their Brethren to make you feel guilty about stuff you didn't do a lot of us don't think we have to deal with that guil we we just deal with it we take it and mle over it for weeks and weeks and weeks somebody's put a guilt trip on us and we don't go through the process sitting out and say did I do that I didn't do that I didn't do that you just go through it say God you just relieve yourself God I didn't do that so now you come to conclusion many times something's been said as an accusation against me so what am I going to do with that you better do something with it because lies have a power over your spirit if you believe it if you if you let it Lodge in your mind if you let it Nest you know it hurts when somebody says something a lie against us none of us like that you shouldn't say them against other people unless you know your facts just shut your mouth don't care don't pass something on that you've heard just shut your mouth so if you don't like to get it then you shouldn't give it out but when you receive it it hurts so the hurt sometimes because it affects us and it hurts us and then it makes us a bit angry we Lodge it and we let it sit there and it's a lie lie has a power over somebody to bring them under a delusion and I'm thinking of first Thessalonians they'll believe a lie and be damned by it because they believed a lie God will send them strong delusion and under the delusion that's how they can believe a lie because they become numb to truth and a lie cast a a cloud and a shadow on somebody but lies can have power over us that actually some people begin to believe it I heard a really neat quote today where he said there's just three votes God voted for you Satan voted against you this election season by the way there's only three votes God voted for you he's already voted for you did you know that you already have God's vote man that ought to make us feel good but Satan's vote is against you and what what uh what takes the tying vote over is that he said what's your vote because when you vote for what God says about you when you vote for yourself it's a win can you say Amen but when you start listening to what the devil tells about you that's your vote you're going to lose but if you vote with God that's it two against one it's over you won Hallelujah he's the lawyer against you he's the accuser of the Brethren and Paul stood before every one of these people just as calm cool and collected unmoved by what was being said he said I live all the time with both my soul and my heart free of condemnation and this situation isn't any different than the way that I live every day how many you know when sons of God live that way then no pressure that comes from the government changes them Daniel had a process of praying three times a day opening up the window he had a habit he had a routine can you say Amen then the laws changed but the laws didn't change his consistency to God I don't change for no pressure from some law and government I don't change because somebody's trying to accuse me to worship other God there's only one God I worship I do it three times a day I'm going to keep doing it when Daniel had heard the law was passed he threw the windows open and worshiped as he did the day before there ain't no law that changes our relationship with God there ain't no law that changes our identity in Jesus Christ we know who we are Paul said my soul and my heart are free of condemnation I don't allow condemnation in my life and if it comes it's not allowed to go very long so I stand before you confident I didn't do any of the things that you said that I just did with boundaries strong I would call Paul a Christian at his very best and so Christians beat themselves up when they set boundaries for people not to abuse them because we're taught to give give always give be Christlike give give and we are to do that there's supposed to be something outflowing from us all the time but we don't do it in the name of somebody crossing the line back on us and our boundaries there are spiritual boundaries there are spiritual limits you you know uh in counseling sometimes if I go a long long time and people aren't listening to what you say and they're draining your energy after a while you got to set some B say I've given you this to go it's up to you now but you're not going to drain my time till alls of the night for weeks and weeks you're not going to do that because I don't see any change in your life you see so we have to have boundaries but and that's a whole different subject but to the enemy he's trying to cross your boundaries all the time he's going to try to take your joy he's going to try to get in your conscience he's going to step over in over the line and say I I wonder if I can get in here and I'll listen to a little bit of this music and so he gets a place in your life cuz you give him a place but the boundaries are no that stuff's out there this is my god-given rights and boundaries to keep my joy and you say it say say Satan you forgot but this is the line this is all the further you get to talk to me this is all the further you get to go I'm a Christian I'm a believer I'm a Son of God and this is my rights to stand right here thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like
