[0:00] your scriptures this evening to matthew
[0:02] chapter 6.
[0:07] and then we'll go to psalms 118.
[0:20] this is a very familiar portion of
[0:22] scripture
[0:28] and i'd like for you to help me with it
[0:30] if you will
[0:31] and after this manner therefore pray ye
[0:35] our father which art in heaven
[0:39] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[0:42] come thy will be done in earth
[0:45] as it is in heaven give us this day
[0:49] our daily bread and forgive us of our
[0:52] debts
[0:52] as we forgive our debtors and lead us
[0:56] not into temptation but deliver us from
[0:59] evil
[1:00] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:03] and the glory forever amen
[1:08] psalms 118 and verse 22
[1:13] the stone which the builders refused
[1:19] it's become the head of the corner
[1:23] this is the lord's doing
[1:27] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:30] [Music]
[1:32] whether you realize it or not this night
[1:34] was orchestrated by god
[1:38] this meeting was orchestrated by god
[1:42] this building was orchestrated by god
[1:49] this is the day which the lord
[1:53] hath made
[1:58] we will rejoice and be glad in it
[2:03] amen you can be seated this afternoon
[2:11] i'd like to just speak for a little
[2:12] while this afternoon on
[2:15] when god takes responsibility
[2:20] he is totally committed
[2:28] hallelujah when god takes responsibility
[2:32] he is totally committed
[2:38] john chapter 14 and verse 20
[2:41] at that day ye shall know that i'm in
[2:44] the father
[2:49] and ye and me and i
[2:52] in you brother branham would speak
[2:56] christ the mystery of god revealed
[3:00] and the mystery was you
[3:04] and when you realize that you were the
[3:05] mystery that was in him
[3:09] you've already walked with him and
[3:11] you've already
[3:12] been inside of him now he wants to live
[3:16] inside of you
[3:18] more than a beautiful building
[3:21] but you're the tabernacle that he's
[3:23] interested in
[3:28] you see we're very familiar as message
[3:32] believers
[3:34] familiar with a silver tip grizzly bear
[3:37] familiar of an animal with 42-inch horns
[3:40] exact familiar of squirrels
[3:44] familiar of the boy in finland when
[3:47] people would write it down for two years
[3:50] before
[3:51] and then it would take place
[3:55] you know we all can enjoy those visions
[3:58] because we look at them backwards and we
[4:01] can see
[4:02] it's easy to look back decades ago and
[4:06] see that that happened
[4:07] exactly and it was totally accurate
[4:11] then we watched the prophet of god as he
[4:13] stands in the pulpit and he begins to
[4:15] deal with one patient after another and
[4:18] he would begin to tell them that
[4:21] that what their name was
[4:24] they knew that tell them their condition
[4:29] they knew that maybe even tell them that
[4:32] when they were on the operating table
[4:35] while that they were asleep there was a
[4:38] heavyset
[4:39] doctor with thick glasses and he's got
[4:43] he's he's he's got your organ in his
[4:46] hand
[4:48] and he's shaking his head and and he
[4:50] doesn't give you any hope
[4:53] now he wasn't reading their minds
[4:55] because they were totally asleep when
[4:57] that operation
[4:58] took place
[5:01] and then tell them that you've got
[5:03] something on your heart
[5:05] it's for your little girl or or for your
[5:07] mother at home
[5:09] and one right after another he was
[5:10] reminding them that it was
[5:12] more than a man that was standing at the
[5:14] pulpit
[5:17] now where the church world got off was
[5:19] they thought it was a gift
[5:25] they thought it was the read of a mind
[5:27] or
[5:28] or the gift of knowledge but it was the
[5:31] mighty angel himself
[5:37] it had never been on display since the
[5:39] days of jesus christ
[5:42] and up to that time it had never been on
[5:45] display
[5:46] until back when abraham and sarah was
[5:48] sent in an attempt
[5:51] but god thought so much of you
[5:55] he so wanted you to get the message
[5:59] maybe you didn't walk in a prayer line
[6:02] but god called your name
[6:07] he knew where you were at maybe you were
[6:10] in a bar room maybe you were in some
[6:12] dead church somewhere another
[6:14] and god came and found you where you
[6:18] were
[6:21] let me just say this to you god's not
[6:22] ashamed of where you were
[6:25] because he knows what he placed in you
[6:28] before the foundation of the world
[6:31] there is where that he placed the the
[6:34] wedding band of
[6:35] predestinated unmerited grace
[6:38] on you before the foundation when you
[6:41] are in god's photo album
[6:50] so if i could bring you up to date you
[6:52] are in the vision
[6:57] it's not a man's vision to where that
[7:00] you can read into it and
[7:02] try to figure it out it's what caused so
[7:05] many people so many problems a few years
[7:08] ago
[7:08] they were trying to figure out the
[7:10] vision in a carnal realm
[7:12] you can't figure out god with a carnal
[7:14] mind
[7:19] amen
[7:23] but you're in the vision of god now
[7:30] you're in the vision of god god knew
[7:34] this day would come
[7:36] he knew this hour would come he knew the
[7:39] service would come
[7:42] he orchestrated it sometimes we feel as
[7:46] men and women that we think that we're
[7:47] making the choice
[7:49] how silly
[7:54] how silly it's god that's working it all
[7:57] out
[7:59] bringing it all together there's
[8:02] sometimes that we
[8:03] think well how can this possibly happen
[8:05] remember
[8:06] god is the great provider
[8:10] now if god could take 2 million people
[8:13] through a red sea
[8:14] then take them through the wilderness
[8:16] for 40 years
[8:18] and they never have to buy clothes
[8:20] imagine that
[8:23] they never have to worry about food they
[8:26] never have to worry about
[8:27] water
[8:31] it's mind-boggling the preparation that
[8:34] humanity
[8:35] would have had to make to get those
[8:37] people through that condition
[8:39] but god is a great provada
[8:42] [Applause]
[8:47] now you say brother ron you're standing
[8:48] there preaching with fourth stage cancer
[8:52] you know as long as the devil wants to
[8:54] be stubborn he's going to have to hear
[8:55] these sermons
[9:12] hallelujah
[9:13] [Applause]
[9:19] and if i didn't know better that devil
[9:22] just might get converted
[9:28] now let me just let me just background
[9:31] just for a bit
[9:32] john 14 and verse 1 jesus is standing
[9:36] there in his mortal flesh and he's
[9:38] speaking with the
[9:39] inner group of his disciples and he's
[9:43] talking about two worlds
[9:47] and he's talking about multiple
[9:48] dimensions
[9:50] and he said let not your heart be
[9:52] troubled
[9:54] you believe in god believe also in me
[9:58] in my father's house are
[10:02] many mansions and if it were not so
[10:06] i would have told you
[10:12] i go to prepare a place
[10:17] for you
[10:21] in this evening hour brother branham
[10:23] would stand about four hours
[10:26] and speak on future homes
[10:29] and in future home if you
[10:32] if you've listened lately you remember
[10:34] brother branham talks about
[10:36] the people that have came into the city
[10:38] for the meetings and
[10:40] and he talks about the restaurant owners
[10:42] and the hotel owners and
[10:44] the people that run the stores and he
[10:46] says what a good people that you you
[10:48] have that comes to your meetings and
[10:50] what a wonderful group we just love to
[10:52] take care of them
[10:54] you see he was not just spending 45
[10:58] minutes of time
[11:00] in preparation and you know admiring the
[11:03] people for their conduct
[11:05] he was actually talking about citizens
[11:07] from another kingdom
[11:11] and this is the way that they conduct
[11:13] themselves
[11:14] [Applause]
[11:16] you know if you want to know what's not
[11:18] in heaven just go read
[11:20] in in in revelations 21 where it tells
[11:23] the people that'll be left out murderers
[11:25] and adulterers and
[11:27] i dollar churchill gives a really nice
[11:30] list of what's not going to be there
[11:34] are you with me but i want to tell you
[11:35] what is going to be there
[11:38] i'm going to be there
[11:43] streets of gold walls of jasper that's
[11:46] incredible to hear
[11:47] gates of peril parks and avenues and the
[11:52] river of life running through
[11:53] every piece of property but what's
[11:56] really important is when you hear your
[11:57] name
[11:59] [Applause]
[12:02] it's okay for you to have your favorite
[12:05] preacher i know that's probably under
[12:06] the order but
[12:07] there you know everybody's got a likes
[12:09] and dislikes whether it's chocolate
[12:10] white chocolate coffee tea
[12:12] whatever you've got
[12:18] but let me let me just let me just share
[12:20] this with you
[12:22] god knows exactly what you like
[12:25] [Applause]
[12:29] and brother branham said he goes to
[12:30] prepare a city
[12:33] just to your liking
[12:38] well you say well brother ron that's
[12:39] that's that's not so big
[12:41] really then why do you paint your walls
[12:46] over and over again
[12:47] different colors get a couch
[12:51] get another one later buy a car a few
[12:54] months
[12:55] few years to get another car
[12:58] you you sometimes don't know what you
[13:04] like
[13:08] i'm taking you somewhere now especially
[13:11] if you're married
[13:14] if you're a bachelor all you needs a
[13:15] bowl and a spoon and
[13:18] a gallon of milk and a bowl of cereal
[13:22] but once you get married that changes
[13:25] you see in the garden of eden eve wanted
[13:27] things moved around
[13:37] it's like a man and a woman when they
[13:39] come to the wedding
[13:41] we really couldn't see the inside of
[13:43] that man
[13:45] until he chose a wife
[13:49] and you see she reflects the character
[13:53] that lays on the inside of that man
[13:57] and she's the lady the queen of the
[14:00] house
[14:04] listen just look around and you can see
[14:06] what god likes
[14:10] because you're a reflection of the
[14:12] inside of god
[14:13] his own very character
[14:17] so there was something about you that
[14:19] god liked brother jonathan
[14:26] now you see we are pre-planned by god
[14:30] we're built to overcome laodicea
[14:34] we're built to live in this age that has
[14:36] fallen apart
[14:38] it was a sermon decades ago a world
[14:41] falling apart
[14:42] but you're watching with your eyes like
[14:45] abraham
[14:46] watch the smoke rise
[14:50] there was a day where there was a
[14:51] conversation about
[14:53] if there's 50 there will you save it if
[14:55] there's 40 there will you save it
[14:56] if there's 20 there will you say that if
[14:59] there's 10
[15:00] abraham was negotiating with god
[15:04] and the two angels went to sodom and
[15:06] what a condition that it was
[15:08] we live in a day
[15:11] where we're watching the the world fall
[15:14] apart
[15:16] governments education
[15:20] the economic system falling apart
[15:24] around us they don't have an answer
[15:35] even the other day when a vision was
[15:38] fulfilled
[15:40] and there stood uh a woman
[15:44] in a purple dress
[15:48] even our critic said it was blue
[15:56] it's the same spirit that moses had to
[16:00] face
[16:03] they can't look at a vision for itself
[16:05] when it fulfills and it's just so plain
[16:11] god didn't need ten thousand angels
[16:12] standing on the the podium of the stage
[16:15] to fulfill a vision
[16:18] the vision happens it's over with and
[16:20] it's a sign
[16:21] for us
[16:24] it's just a sign that we're getting
[16:26] closer
[16:28] today in your fox news you you you could
[16:31] you could read the article of word that
[16:33] the government now says that they have
[16:36] videos of ufos taking place that's
[16:38] nothing new for us
[16:43] and they said that they have a super
[16:45] intelligence much more than what we've
[16:47] got i'd say they do
[16:49] they have an agenda and we are the
[16:52] agenda
[16:54] [Applause]
[16:59] now god's not going to have just a group
[17:01] of people that are
[17:03] that are going to just live in this age
[17:06] but we're going to
[17:07] overcome this age
[17:11] this age is not going to be an age to
[17:13] where that we're going to be
[17:16] escape free from problems
[17:20] or situations but god has equipped us
[17:25] with the greatest weapon that we could
[17:28] possibly have
[17:30] and not only equipped us with his word
[17:34] that is filled with every precious
[17:36] promise
[17:37] but it is our open book now
[17:42] to to read it and to take it in
[17:45] well brother ron that's just another
[17:47] statement well just think about all the
[17:49] schools
[17:50] that have been built throughout the ages
[17:54] to try to figure out this book
[18:02] i might as well scald the devil's height
[18:03] he gives me a hard time and he don't
[18:05] need me letting up on him
[18:09] they built tremendous schools of
[18:11] theology
[18:12] and literally maybe millions of
[18:14] preachers has come out of there
[18:16] that never could open this book but in
[18:19] our generation
[18:23] god himself came down
[18:26] even when the prophet said that was
[18:28] against this better
[18:29] judgment or he thought that this is the
[18:32] way tomorrow night would be
[18:34] that god came in the room
[18:37] who better to explain the book than the
[18:39] one that wrote the book
[18:48] and you are god's crowning achievement
[18:52] in this day your bone of this bone
[18:58] your life of his life your spirit of his
[19:01] spirit
[19:02] [Applause]
[19:04] brother branham would explain how the
[19:06] mechanics and the dynamics
[19:08] now don't try to go figure that out by
[19:10] some scientific fear
[19:12] listen god knows exactly the formula
[19:17] amen go through all kinds of steps to
[19:19] get born again
[19:20] just meet jesus
[19:25] just me jesus it's not so great you
[19:28] don't have to read 52 books just meet
[19:30] jesus
[19:30] [Applause]
[19:34] and welcome jesus to your home let your
[19:37] home be filled with jesus
[19:40] [Music]
[19:46] you don't have to go through every kind
[19:47] of rehab in the world
[19:50] you don't have to go through every kind
[19:51] of psychologist to figure you out
[19:55] jesus knew how to fix the woman at 12.
[19:59] in just a little bit of a conversation
[20:02] she went and told the city come see a
[20:04] man
[20:04] who told me everything she never went
[20:07] back to that lifestyle again
[20:10] you say well brother ron there's no hope
[20:12] for me there was no hope for lashes
[20:14] but jesus pre-planned the meeting
[20:20] as a matter of fact jesus went out of
[20:22] his way
[20:24] [Applause]
[20:26] in god's orchestration he couldn't go
[20:29] pray for him
[20:30] until he was dead
[20:35] so i'm not giving up
[20:39] i don't care what the report is i got
[20:40] another report
[20:42] i've got another physician
[20:51] now let me just say this to you and
[20:55] we're not looking for some great revival
[20:57] to come
[20:58] it's happening
[21:03] [Music]
[21:04] obviously this mic's not working we're
[21:07] not looking for some great revival to
[21:09] come
[21:11] it's happening
[21:18] it's not just happening here it's
[21:20] happening all over the world
[21:22] because who is among us the mighty angel
[21:25] himself
[21:27] we're not looking for some great
[21:29] preacher some superhuman being to come
[21:31] on the scene
[21:32] the mighty angel is healed but the man
[21:35] said you're not feeding on the mind of a
[21:37] man
[21:42] are you with me neither should we feed
[21:43] today on the mind of a man
[21:45] but you're feeding on the body word of
[21:48] the son of
[21:49] man that's where our diet is
[22:00] jesus should say blessed are your eyes
[22:03] for you see
[22:06] blessed are your ears for you here
[22:09] and you realize being one in a million
[22:11] your neighbor don't see it
[22:12] your parents don't understand it but
[22:15] your ears are open
[22:20] we live in a very heavily offended age
[22:23] where everybody's offended everybody's
[22:25] got a blog everybody's got an opinion
[22:30] but jesus said blessed are ye which are
[22:33] not offended
[22:34] [Applause]
[22:37] and he would turn and say except you eat
[22:39] my flesh and drink my blood
[22:41] you have no part with me
[22:43] [Music]
[22:50] hallelujah now
[22:53] brother branham would speak a sermon on
[22:55] recognizing your day and its message
[22:58] it's still an important sermon
[23:01] i would say it's an important service
[23:03] for tonight
[23:09] and he he went back and he talked about
[23:12] a group of people that
[23:13] had the hurdle of his coming said
[23:15] they're good people
[23:16] and they're constantly saying fast and
[23:18] pray fast and pray fast and pray
[23:21] fast and pray and and he later says the
[23:24] reason they do that is because they've
[23:26] not
[23:27] recognized the awakening
[23:30] of the bride
[23:36] and i'm afraid there's still too many
[23:38] today that that quote still appears to
[23:42] they're looking for something to come
[23:45] that is already happening
[23:51] are you with me i'm not trying to work
[23:54] you up into something
[23:55] listen this should cause a greater
[23:57] excitement than
[23:59] ohio state football or michigan football
[24:06] this is not some carnal something
[24:08] that'll fill you for a day or two
[24:12] you know so many times when you were in
[24:13] the world you went you had great
[24:15] expectation for something to be so
[24:17] exciting
[24:18] and then it was a letdown i've never
[24:20] been in a search
[24:23] i've never been in a place where i was
[24:25] under expectation for god to come
[24:27] that he didn't meet my expectation
[24:39] now understand this that god has taken
[24:42] responsibility for you
[24:51] he's taken responsibility for you
[24:55] so that means that he has watched over
[24:57] you
[24:58] since the foundation of the world
[25:04] are you with me now i want to remind you
[25:06] of some things that you already know
[25:08] god wanted you to be red-headed
[25:11] brown-headed whatever hair you've got
[25:14] he wanted you to be so tall
[25:18] come on so heavy
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] he wanted you to be the way that you are
[25:28] and
[25:28] even with certain strings in your life
[25:32] and certain complexes
[25:36] and he wanted you to be born on a
[25:38] certain day at a certain hour at a
[25:39] certain minute to be under the
[25:40] constellation of the sky are you with me
[25:46] and he knew that you would be alienated
[25:48] from god because you have to come from
[25:50] the sexual birth
[25:51] so god has to watch over you
[25:54] all the way back from the days of adam
[25:59] and he had this one to marry this one
[26:01] and this one to marry this one and this
[26:02] one to marry this one
[26:04] all in the same time he has to watch
[26:06] over your parents
[26:08] as they went through wars and plagues
[26:11] and coveted in every kind of situation
[26:13] he had to watch over every situation
[26:17] moving from one nation to another nation
[26:20] moving here moving down brother ron god
[26:24] don't do that don't tell me
[26:26] when he was to be born on the earth he
[26:28] caused taxation
[26:32] and he forced joseph to go back to his
[26:34] birthplace
[26:36] [Music]
[26:37] god knows how to move an entire nation
[26:39] for you
[26:42] whether you know it or not my god's a
[26:45] great big god
[26:48] he's so much bigger than you make him
[26:51] it's you
[26:52] that limits god it's not god that limits
[26:58] he feels all time space and eternity
[27:01] he said let there be and he spoke to
[27:04] that which was not
[27:05] and it became a consolation of stars
[27:09] [Applause]
[27:13] and he said it is good he even
[27:16] complemented his own work
[27:19] it is good
[27:20] [Applause]
[27:22] and whether you know it or not when he
[27:24] looks at you in all of his vision
[27:27] all the way since the photo album and
[27:29] now you're sitting here on this night
[27:33] blue suit black suit whatever dress that
[27:36] you've got on
[27:37] he said it is good
[28:01] sometimes you ask the question
[28:05] why does god let me go through
[28:14] difficulty
[28:16] brandon preached this message for
[28:19] decades
[28:19] with a condition in his body
[28:23] and seeing some of the most phenomenal
[28:26] miracles that has happened since jesus
[28:32] and yet fought with his own humanity
[28:36] god was bigger than brother branham's
[28:38] problems
[28:42] god was bigger than brother brown's
[28:44] mistakes
[28:46] i know that's almost blasphemy in some
[28:47] places
[28:50] but aren't you thankful that he's bigger
[28:52] than your mistakes
[28:58] aren't you really thankful that god has
[29:01] mercy
[29:03] allocated
[29:06] in his great provision he had it
[29:10] allocated i'll take care of their
[29:12] mistakes
[29:17] some of you were the woman at the well
[29:22] some of you were naked on a boat cursing
[29:26] hopefully not but some of you
[29:33] but some of you were some real doozies
[29:38] i never get really i get amazed
[29:40] sometimes after people been a christian
[29:42] for 20
[29:43] 30 years they they get amnesia
[29:46] and they forget about grace
[29:50] the grace that brought them in will take
[29:52] the same grace to take care of their
[29:54] children
[29:57] the blood that paid the price of
[29:59] redemption for them
[30:00] it'll take the same blood
[30:04] this is more than just handing your
[30:06] children a books
[30:10] or go play a tape and you'll get it it's
[30:13] going to take the same
[30:15] acts 2 experience that it did for you
[30:25] may this church be a place where people
[30:28] can weep their way to calvary
[30:32] and truly repent of their sins
[30:36] and be filled with the holy ghost
[30:39] you can't live this without god
[30:43] listen we don't want to have service
[30:45] without god
[30:47] we don't have a singing without god
[30:52] i don't want to set an appeal without
[30:54] god
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:58] well brother ronnie if you would just
[30:59] kind of preach and not
[31:01] raise your voice or scream at us it's
[31:04] because you're an unconverted baptist
[31:06] sentinel in the message
[31:07] [Applause]
[31:12] and what you really need is a pillar of
[31:14] fire
[31:16] are you with me
[31:20] brother brown said the modern church
[31:22] don't wanted them acts 238 speaking
[31:24] youngins around them
[31:27] whooping and crying and screaming said
[31:30] the modern church won't have it
[31:33] you think that's going to stay out there
[31:34] and the baptist church are going to come
[31:36] right in amongst you
[31:38] where you can't raise your hands where
[31:40] you can't praise the lord
[31:42] where you've just got a religious demon
[31:44] bigger than a bullfrog
[31:49] don't sit on me i'm not the kind of
[31:50] preacher you want to sit on
[31:53] [Applause]
[31:56] but god has provided a birth for you
[32:00] [Applause]
[32:02] where he can take your drug addict kids
[32:04] and turn them around
[32:06] in a moment's notice
[32:08] [Applause]
[32:12] you don't need a seminar on how to
[32:14] overcome pornography
[32:16] just get saved
[32:19] just get a baptism of the holy ghost
[32:22] and truly repent of your sins and never
[32:26] go
[32:26] back never go bad
[32:42] brother man said if mary had to go to
[32:43] the upper room so will you
[32:47] but too many times the devil offers us
[32:50] sitting on these pews without a birth
[32:56] he don't mind you walking in this
[32:58] building and being part of the
[32:59] attendance and
[33:00] crossing your arms and sitting there
[33:04] he don't mind you coming here because he
[33:06] needs a ride
[33:16] but what he does mind is when you get a
[33:18] part of god inside of you
[33:21] and it becomes reality and it's more
[33:24] than things that are to be and god's
[33:26] provided way of worship
[33:27] now you're that place that god has chose
[33:30] to live inside of
[33:45] brother walked to the pulpit there was
[33:47] many times that he was speaking
[33:49] before audience that had no clue what he
[33:51] was talking about
[33:56] and he speaks a subject of things that
[33:59] are to be
[34:02] and it's more than a sermon
[34:06] it's more than a vision and it's more
[34:09] than a prophecy
[34:11] this is not what might be
[34:16] this is what will be
[34:20] there he begins to explain
[34:23] that you are in the pre-planning of god
[34:31] you never was just a thought or some
[34:34] myth
[34:37] you were in the infinite god's mind
[34:41] before the foundational world before he
[34:45] ever created this celestial globe you
[34:48] will stand
[34:52] now if you was there then he explains
[34:55] eternal life
[34:56] to have eternal life you had to be in
[34:59] his mind
[35:00] then
[35:04] to be where you are now you didn't bring
[35:07] yourself to church god brooded over you
[35:09] and brought you
[35:13] you wasn't looking for god god came
[35:15] looking for you
[35:18] then brother branham will come down just
[35:19] a few just a few sentences in that
[35:22] and he said there's nothing out of cater
[35:26] and then he begins to say even this
[35:29] night
[35:31] was pre-planned
[35:34] my god now think about that that's
[35:38] bigger than sometimes we even
[35:40] well brother paul was thinking about a
[35:41] meeting no
[35:43] when george washington was fighting in
[35:45] the delaware
[35:47] god had this night on his mind
[35:51] when charles finney was preaching he had
[35:54] this night on his mind when jonathan
[35:58] golfer was overseas and he was
[36:00] doing missionary work he had this might
[36:02] on his mind
[36:04] when peter cartwright was inside of a
[36:07] building and
[36:08] and brother dan goes back in the
[36:09] greatest battle ever fought and he picks
[36:11] him up
[36:13] out of all the stories of history
[36:15] brother man picks up peter cartwright
[36:17] and he said he he went to a town and he
[36:20] he began to
[36:21] clean out the building and wash the
[36:23] women's and the
[36:24] you know the bully of the town came in
[36:26] and he was the sheriff of the mayor or
[36:28] whatever he was
[36:29] and he came in and said you can't have a
[36:31] meeting here until you get permission
[36:33] from me
[36:34] and you'll have to whip me first god had
[36:38] somebody there that would climb down off
[36:42] of the ladder
[36:43] [Applause]
[36:49] he needed a church to be there and he
[36:51] needed a pastor
[36:52] and he needed a people so he had a
[36:55] preacher to climb up there
[36:56] and clean the windows and get it ready
[37:00] and when it came time for the pastor to
[37:02] walk in
[37:03] and be a bully
[37:11] he simply took his coat off and said
[37:12] well that's the next thing i'll do then
[37:16] how would you like that to be your
[37:20] preacher
[37:22] well this church was started on a fight
[37:27] i got converted in the service that
[37:29] night after peter cartwright preached i
[37:31] got converted he whipped me
[37:33] then i came back to church and i met god
[37:38] i'd like for you all to meet the same
[37:40] god that i met
[37:43] oh brother ron all those things are by
[37:45] chance really
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] a man who's himself a a sepulcher
[37:54] because he has the ability and the
[37:55] provisions to do it
[38:01] and he works diligently in the hardest
[38:03] rock in the world
[38:05] to dig himself out a grave one day i'll
[38:07] lay him
[38:09] not knowing that jesus was going to need
[38:13] one
[38:14] only for three days
[38:19] it was more than coincidence
[38:26] i can hear him tell his wife she said
[38:27] you worked so hard
[38:29] you did so much work to try to build
[38:32] that for yourself and now you're gonna
[38:33] let this prophet
[38:35] some call it the messiah you're gonna
[38:36] let him lay there i can hear his answer
[38:39] he's not gonna lead it but for three
[38:44] days
[38:51] i find it that jesus is very detailed
[38:54] in his planning jarius comes
[38:59] makes his journey and on the way home
[39:02] they tell him his daughter's dead
[39:03] and jesus is operating in two worlds
[39:07] fear not did i tell you fear or not
[39:13] and it reminds him of who he is then he
[39:16] goes there and he
[39:17] gets all of the mourners to leave
[39:21] gets all the unbelief out of the room
[39:24] and then he speaks to her
[39:28] and she comes to life
[39:32] and then jesus tells him feed her
[39:37] she needs to eat
[39:42] you see he was mindful of you
[39:48] so he provided you a ministry
[39:54] where you could come on whatever your
[39:57] services are
[39:59] and eat
[40:03] because he knows that you need to eat to
[40:05] overcome laodicea
[40:08] you're not going to do it on your own
[40:10] you're not going to do it on your own
[40:12] energies
[40:13] so you need to eat
[40:18] so he will begin to deal with the pastor
[40:21] or the minister of the evangelist
[40:24] and maybe just in just a couple of words
[40:27] they'll be nervous for two or three
[40:28] weeks getting a subject together
[40:31] all different kind of things walk to the
[40:32] pulpit and it don't go
[40:34] nothing like they thought it would
[40:36] because you were here
[40:38] to eat and it's your need that gets
[40:41] god's attention
[40:46] are you with me listen jesus knows
[40:49] there's coming a woman that's going to
[40:50] touch the hem of his garment he don't
[40:52] know who it will be
[40:53] but he knows that as he walks somebody's
[40:55] going to touch it
[40:56] but he's got to wait on her to do it
[41:00] on the way brian bartimaeus cries out no
[41:03] way he could possibly hear
[41:05] but god knows your need
[41:15] he's a great provider
[41:19] understand something about god god is
[41:21] infinite
[41:24] and god has never been in a crisis
[41:35] he has the answer
[41:40] and he's always on time
[41:48] you don't have to prove god
[41:52] god will prove himself
[41:53] [Music]
[41:58] understand no doubt you have confidence
[42:01] in god
[42:03] but god's got confidence in his seed
[42:11] job is not the only one that god's had a
[42:14] testimony service about
[42:18] no doubt you've been sent through the
[42:20] ringer in your life
[42:22] and satan was trying to wreck your plans
[42:27] and wreck your marriage and wreck your
[42:29] life
[42:32] and god knew the seed that he planted
[42:35] and deposited in you
[42:37] would hold
[42:41] he don't have to send reinforcements to
[42:43] that seed
[42:44] that seed will hold
[42:56] no doubt as this building was being
[42:57] searched out god knew exactly where it
[42:59] was at
[43:01] no doubt it had a lot of other tenants
[43:04] that did all the a lot of the hard work
[43:07] to make this
[43:08] this place happen no doubt he grinned as
[43:11] they were preparing it
[43:15] you know kind of like he watched you
[43:18] when you were drunk
[43:22] and you said i'll never go to church
[43:28] and then he comes to your will
[43:34] hallelujah brother kelly he knows how to
[43:37] walk to a well
[43:39] he's not ashamed of where you're at what
[43:41] your past is what your
[43:46] he's not ashamed of you
[43:49] he's not ashamed of where you're at he's
[43:52] not ashamed of how scarred that you
[43:54] are in your life
[44:00] maybe you wouldn't want the woman that
[44:02] had five husbands to sit under your pew
[44:05] but once she meets jesus she's harmless
[44:17] maybe you don't want the biggest drug
[44:19] addict in the city to be here
[44:22] but once he meets jesus he's harmless
[44:26] [Applause]
[44:31] he knows how to clean fish
[44:38] so many times we preach the laws of do's
[44:40] and don'ts
[44:42] and it just becomes a legislation we're
[44:45] conforming people to it this is the way
[44:47] we do it this is the way we do it this
[44:48] is the way we do it
[44:49] and then later down the road they get
[44:51] tired of the way we do it
[44:52] but if they ever meet jesus
[44:56] and the life of god is poured inside of
[44:58] them
[44:59] there's no argument about a closet
[45:03] there's no argument about media there's
[45:05] no argument about the
[45:07] what god wants in your life you have a
[45:09] desire to please him
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:14] jesus said these words are in book of
[45:16] revelations 21
[45:17] forgive me he said i saw a new heaven
[45:22] and a new earth for the first heaven and
[45:24] the first earth were passed away
[45:26] and there was no more sea future event
[45:30] but it's going to happen
[45:33] what's going to happen with this world
[45:34] it's getting ready to get a
[45:35] transformation
[45:36] just like you got
[45:38] [Music]
[45:40] the birthing process is on for this
[45:42] world
[45:44] are you with me now there's a groaning
[45:46] in the earth
[45:48] that is taking place
[45:51] in in israel there's a groaning that's
[45:54] taken place
[45:56] they have been gathered they are a
[45:59] tremendous nation one of the most
[46:01] powerful nations in the entire world
[46:03] yet they're itty-bitty but because
[46:07] god has pre-planned it
[46:10] there's not an army in the world
[46:14] that can destroy them
[46:20] because you were pre-planned
[46:23] now i'm getting ready to preach to you
[46:25] i've laid my foundation let me preach
[46:29] because you were pre-planned
[46:33] there's not an army of devils in the
[46:35] entire world
[46:37] that can destroy you
[46:46] you may not agree with this but i'm
[46:49] going to say it
[46:52] i believe that satan sent his
[46:55] best cancer devil that he could to
[46:58] attack my body
[47:01] but i also believe that god sent his
[47:08] best
[47:13] i thought last night's sermon was so
[47:15] tremendous and timely
[47:17] here we are at the end of the end of the
[47:19] end
[47:20] and the people of god are being moved
[47:23] into another channel
[47:24] because we've got to have faith more
[47:26] than just to cure cancer
[47:27] we've got to have faith that this mortal
[47:30] becomes immortal
[47:31] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[47:34] this flesh
[47:34] gets changed
[47:38] because this is a rapture message
[47:41] and god will leave nothing undone
[47:49] god's not just gonna bring us out this
[47:52] far to leave us
[47:53] his angel is among us to see this
[47:57] message through
[47:58] and every detail and every promise
[48:09] hallelujah it's not here for rapture
[48:13] it's going to happen it's not if a
[48:16] resurrection
[48:18] there's going to come a resurrection
[48:20] [Applause]
[48:28] satan tries to corrupt you
[48:32] he tries to corrupt you and send every
[48:34] avenue to try to corrupt your life
[48:38] but i got a statement for him when jesus
[48:41] was laying in the grave
[48:44] 2000 years ago god would not let
[48:47] corruption
[48:48] enter his body then and i was in there
[48:51] then
[48:52] he couldn't corrupt me 2 000 years ago
[48:55] he don't have enough weapons to corrupt
[48:58] me now
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:14] the message is not if i overcome
[49:17] i'm going to overcome it
[49:21] because greater is he that is in me than
[49:24] he that is in the world
[49:26] it is not up for debate and it's not up
[49:29] for negotiation
[49:31] it is not up for challenge
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:34] god will prove his word there will be a
[49:37] bribe
[49:40] there will be a people
[49:47] [Music]
[49:51] [Applause]
[49:54] i've heard this for decades no doubt the
[49:56] people in noah's day thought they'd
[49:58] heard it for decades
[49:59] but one day there came a flood and god
[50:02] proved his word
[50:03] god will prove his word in this day
[50:07] you'll see your mom and daddy come down
[50:09] your your sidewalk
[50:11] he's coming he's not going to be old
[50:15] he's coming he's going to be a young man
[50:20] hallelujah and this message will be more
[50:23] than a book
[50:24] it'll be more than a promise it'll be a
[50:27] reality
[50:34] i want to remind you when brother john
[50:38] last year took his last breath his
[50:41] first breath was in heaven
[50:45] and he was not old because jesus said
[50:48] i go to prepare
[50:55] brother braham said it wasn't houses of
[50:57] stone and brick and mortar
[51:00] your body
[51:01] [Applause]
[51:07] my mama's not a gray-headed woman today
[51:10] your loved ones are not sitting in a
[51:12] wheelchair no more
[51:15] they're waiting on another dimension and
[51:17] they know this message is right
[51:20] cause the moment that your father
[51:23] went to that realm everything that he
[51:26] preached
[51:27] was in front of him
[51:45] praise the lord
[51:51] one day i was in my office on december
[51:53] the 22nd
[51:55] and the spirit of the lord spoke to me
[52:00] and said if you'll trust me i'll use you
[52:03] like never
[52:04] before
[52:10] i did not realize
[52:13] that in a few days while i was at
[52:16] brother bischo's preaching three sermons
[52:19] one was encouragement one was
[52:22] naaman was a leper and the third was
[52:26] take it back
[52:31] it wasn't until the last service
[52:34] just before walking to the last service
[52:36] we get a call
[52:40] you have cancer in your lung and i
[52:42] thought how fitting
[52:46] brother mitchell from my area had cancer
[52:49] in his lung
[52:51] and brother bristol interviewed
[52:58] brother mitchell it was at a a tv
[53:01] station
[53:02] where they did political uh
[53:07] advertisements political stories
[53:10] and it would take half a day to do a
[53:13] politician
[53:16] and when brother biscuit and brother
[53:18] mitchell goes there charlie i would grew
[53:20] up at charlie
[53:21] as a preacher and and
[53:25] they go and they sat down and in less
[53:27] than an hour they're done
[53:30] and so the producer said how could you
[53:32] do that and he said well we tell the
[53:35] [Applause]
[53:40] truth
[53:44] as i look back at the year before
[53:48] god gave me sermons like encouragement
[53:51] take it back where david was stripped of
[53:54] all of his possessions
[53:57] the enemy came in and attacked
[54:01] and the enemy would come in and attack
[54:03] me we we were
[54:05] preaching at that convention together
[54:07] and the enemy would attack
[54:08] me and give me a death sentence
[54:14] brother roy shrewsbury called me and is
[54:16] this okay

[54:34] has ever survived
[54:39] and he said but daniel told the king
[54:44] i'll see you in the morning

[1:01:50] to you in counsel with you for a few
[1:01:52] hours it would fix it just counsel with
[1:01:54] god
[1:01:56] most time people go to preachers because
[1:01:58] they really ain't prayed over it anyway
[1:02:01] and they don't want the fix that the
[1:02:03] preacher gives them
[1:02:05] what you really need is an old-fashioned
[1:02:07] backwoods
[1:02:09] hot skinning pentecostal prayer meeting
[1:02:24] the scripture says in first john chapter
[1:02:26] 4 year of god little children
[1:02:30] and have overcame them because greater
[1:02:33] is he
[1:02:34] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:02:38] world
[1:02:39] last night we heard about david david
[1:02:42] did not look for a cemetery to bury him
[1:02:47] he was not thinking about how bad the
[1:02:49] death's going to be
[1:02:52] he was not even measuring how big
[1:02:55] goliath was
[1:02:56] the lie told him don't you worry about
[1:03:00] telling how big your devil is he'll tell
[1:03:02] you how big he is
[1:03:04] he's nothing but a bluff to start off
[1:03:06] with just start picking up promises of
[1:03:08] stones
[1:03:10] and don't even worry about your ability
[1:03:13] to turn it loose
[1:03:14] it will find its targeted place
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:27] don't pick it up brother
[1:03:34] well i've had it
[1:03:38] it was two weeks of misery but he lost
[1:03:57] isn't the devil stupid just it'd be
[1:04:00] stupid
[1:04:02] he knows you're going to whip him yet he
[1:04:04] keeps coming back
[1:04:08] brother branham said he he heard him get
[1:04:10] in the car with him he was going to take
[1:04:12] a trip
[1:04:13] in arizona going to cheer to church take
[1:04:16] a trip

[1:04:20] going to sing to you
[1:04:22] he said i sung to him all the way
[1:04:27] so if the devil's gonna ride you give
[1:04:29] him a real ride
[1:04:53] romans 8 says who shall separate us from
[1:04:57] the love of christ
[1:04:59] it's tribulation distress
[1:05:03] persecution famine nakedness a peril of
[1:05:06] sort
[1:05:07] god's got it all in his preparation he
[1:05:09] knows you're going to have to go through
[1:05:10] some of these things
[1:05:13] but as it is written for thy sake we're
[1:05:15] killed all the day long
[1:05:16] and we're counted as sheep and for a
[1:05:18] slaughter nailing all these things
[1:05:23] now and all these things why don't you
[1:05:25] say it it wasn't whatever's going on in
[1:05:27] your life
[1:05:28] nay and all these things
[1:05:37] i can hear the devil saying man we
[1:05:39] showed up at the wrong meeting
[1:05:40] this weekend we started getting killed
[1:05:44] the first night and this guy
[1:05:46] ain't letting up none neither we are
[1:05:49] more than conquer us
[1:05:51] [Applause]
[1:05:52] through him that loved us for i am
[1:05:56] persuaded that neither death
[1:05:58] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:06:01] no powers nor things to come nor things
[1:06:04] or things nor things present or things
[1:06:06] to come nor
[1:06:07] height nor death nor any other creature
[1:06:10] shall be able to separate us
[1:06:16] there's not even a thought about going
[1:06:18] back
[1:06:26] think about that's the kind of people
[1:06:27] that you are
[1:06:30] all that he puts on you and there's
[1:06:33] not a thought about going back
[1:06:53] i know where i stand
[1:06:56] i know what i'm doing and i'm settled
[1:07:01] should god heal me i'm going to preach
[1:07:04] till the day i die
[1:07:07] should i go by the way of the grave i'm
[1:07:10] going to preach to the way that i die
[1:07:13] and if i die hell will self will
[1:07:16] celebrate because i'm gone
[1:07:22] but my faith is i'm going to take a
[1:07:24] rapture with you
[1:07:39] i refuse to retreat
[1:07:42] i'm saying this more for you tonight
[1:07:46] i refuse to retreat i want you to say it
[1:07:50] with me
[1:07:51] i refuse to retreat
[1:07:54] some of you are incredible singers you
[1:07:56] can say it better than that
[1:07:58] i refuse to retreat
[1:08:01] why don't you say it so loud that hell
[1:08:03] can hear it
[1:08:05] i refuse to retreat
[1:08:08] i want you to say it with attitude i
[1:08:11] refuse
[1:08:12] to be true
[1:08:20] i refuse to give up
[1:08:25] i refuse to give up
[1:08:28] i refuse to turn back
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] hallelujah there is no going back for a
[1:08:37] believer
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:09:00] the scripture says in revelations
[1:09:02] chapter 3
[1:09:04] and even satan's thrilled that i'm
[1:09:06] coming to an end
[1:09:12] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[1:09:15] sit with me
[1:09:17] in my throne
[1:09:20] even as i also overcame
[1:09:28] so he's reminding you when i was here
[1:09:31] and i had you in me i okay
[1:09:36] it's a little bit reversed right now
[1:09:38] you're here
[1:09:39] and i'm in you
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:45] now it's not your flesh it's gonna
[1:09:46] overcome
[1:09:49] but he that is in you
[1:09:53] is the one that accepts the challenge
[1:09:56] because what god deposited god's got
[1:09:59] confidence in it
[1:10:05] so when god says i am committed to the
[1:10:08] end
[1:10:13] he won't take you halfway and then lead
[1:10:15] you
[1:10:18] he won't desert you in your journey he
[1:10:21] is committed
[1:10:29] brother ron but why did we have to have
[1:10:31] such a big building
[1:10:32] there's a lot of seed that's still got
[1:10:34] to come in
[1:10:36] and the table's going to be full and
[1:10:39] something's going to be lame
[1:10:40] and something's going to be halt and
[1:10:42] something's going to be blind
[1:10:44] they're not qualified to sit at the
[1:10:46] table but god's going to make them
[1:10:48] qualified
[1:10:56] let me finish now some are going to be
[1:10:59] drug addicts and prostitutes and bad
[1:11:01] people
[1:11:02] but god knows how to clean them up he's
[1:11:05] got a ministry here that's ready
[1:11:07] he has prepared this place this is a
[1:11:11] prepared place for
[1:11:12] prepared people

[1:11:24] we will rickshaws
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:52] hallelujah
[1:12:10] this is not about brother ray's church
[1:12:12] this is not about brother john's church
[1:12:14] this
[1:12:15] is not about brother jonathan's church
[1:12:17] it's not about your church
[1:12:18] this is god's church
[1:12:22] we're a family we're universally a
[1:12:24] family
[1:12:26] we're believers and we do what believers
[1:12:29] will do
[1:12:30] we're fulfilling a vision
[1:12:35] this morning this molecules
[1:12:39] is going to take on immortality we
[1:12:43] are the fusion
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:13:02] hallelujah
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:16] god

[1:14:50] that he's here to supply your need
[1:14:53] every need even down to the minute
[1:14:56] detail brother

[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:09] your marriage your situation
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] he already knows brother jonathan he
[1:15:18] knows what you've been praying about as
[1:15:20] a pastor
[1:15:24] the hot things that you can't touch
[1:15:28] you can't touch it
[1:15:31] you know that when
[1:15:35] when you lay your hands on it you'll
[1:15:36] only make a mess

[1:15:44] times
[1:15:45] what do i do with this
[1:15:48] you know he's speaking to you even now
[1:15:55] but a god that's reaching mercy
[1:16:01] he don't see it in a time element like
[1:16:03] we see
[1:16:06] we get in a hurry
[1:16:09] and we worry about whether we'll make a
[1:16:11] mess out of it
[1:16:14] because generations are affected by some
[1:16:17] of the conversations that we have
[1:16:23] but but god's in a service like tonight
[1:16:28] and just in a moment of a world
[1:16:32] he gives abraham enough faith that'll
[1:16:35] change him back to a young man again

[1:16:54] that's in your thoughts but god's mercy
[1:16:57] is way
[1:16:58] greater than your mercy
[1:17:01] his grace is way greater than your grace
