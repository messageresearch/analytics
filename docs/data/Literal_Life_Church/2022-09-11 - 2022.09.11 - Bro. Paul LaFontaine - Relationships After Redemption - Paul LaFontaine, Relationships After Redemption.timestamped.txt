[0:00] acts chapter 4 we'll read our scripture
[0:01] this morning
[0:03] and we'll be mindful of the time as well
[0:04] as we have two services today but we
[0:06] want to get into the word here acts
[0:08] chapter 4
[0:09] and verse 32
[0:11] and the multitude of them that believed
[0:14] were of one heart and of one soul
[0:18] neither said any of them that ought of
[0:20] what things which he possessed was his
[0:22] own
[0:23] but they had all things common and with
[0:27] great power gave the apostles witness of
[0:29] the resurrection of the lord jesus and
[0:32] great grace was upon them all
[0:35] neither was any of them that lacked for
[0:37] as many as were possessors of lands or
[0:40] houses sold them and brought the prices
[0:42] of things that were sold and laid them
[0:44] down at the apostles feet and
[0:46] distribution was made unto every man
[0:48] according as he had need
[0:50] and joseph who was by who by the
[0:53] apostles was surnamed barnabas which is
[0:55] being interpreted the son of consolation
[0:57] a levite of the country of cyprus having
[1:00] land sold it and brought the money and
[1:03] laid it at the apostles feet i want to
[1:06] emphasize verse 32 today as under my
[1:10] text and subject i want to emphasize
[1:12] that this is where the people of god
[1:14] were after
[1:16] uh the redemption and the holy ghost had
[1:19] come
[1:20] this is the state of mind this is the
[1:22] state of heart is that they were of one
[1:24] heart and of one soul
[1:26] this is what the holy ghost does
[1:29] if you go back to acts 2 i'll go ahead
[1:31] and read this i'll refer to it later
[1:33] acts 2 it says a lot of the same thing
[1:35] after right in acts 2 after the holy
[1:37] ghost fell
[1:39] then he peter directs the people and
[1:41] then it comes down and it says verse 41
[1:44] acts 2 41
[1:46] then they gladly they that gladly
[1:48] received his word
[1:50] how many want to gladly receive his word
[1:52] today
[1:53] them that gladly received his word were
[1:56] baptized and the same day there was
[1:58] added unto them three thousand souls and
[2:00] they continued steadfastly in the
[2:02] apostles doctrine and fellowship and in
[2:06] breaking of bread and in prayers and
[2:09] fear came upon every soul and many
[2:11] wonders and signs were done
[2:14] by the apostles and all that believed
[2:17] were together and had all things common
[2:22] heavenly father we pray you will bless
[2:24] and anoint your word today we're glad
[2:26] that you have come father for any of us
[2:29] who have known you for years we know
[2:32] that your presence is near this morning
[2:34] we know that you've chosen to come and
[2:36] visit us wherever two or three are
[2:38] gathered in your name you promise father
[2:41] to show up and lord god angels are
[2:45] encamped around those that fear the lord
[2:48] and respect his word so father we ask
[2:50] that you would break every fetter we
[2:53] asked lord that you would break down
[2:54] every stronghold of the enemy we bro we
[2:57] ask lord that every wrong would be made
[3:00] right we ask that every mistake would be
[3:02] put under the blood of jesus christ lord
[3:05] we ask that every offense lord would be
[3:07] forgiven and we commit ourselves to
[3:10] listening to you and sitting at your
[3:11] feet today as lord we look to you in
[3:14] this time in this hour for such a time
[3:17] as this is what was told of esser
[3:20] perhaps god raised you up for such a
[3:23] time as this you didn't call us lord to
[3:26] live back in jesus day you didn't call
[3:28] us to live in luther's day but lord you
[3:31] predestinated us to this age that we
[3:33] live in so no matter the trials no
[3:36] matter the the satan's eden that we live
[3:38] in if you put us here then you've put us
[3:41] here for such a time as this and that is
[3:44] to be overcomers we believe that lord
[3:47] give us the strength anoint the people's
[3:50] faith and we'll put our trust completely
[3:52] in you this morning as we commit it to
[3:54] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:57] amen amen god bless you as you're seated
[4:00] this morning
[4:06] just a few weeks ago we were on a
[4:08] subject of
[4:10] relationships after the fall
[4:12] relationships after the fall and we were
[4:15] delving into after everything fell when
[4:19] mankind fell
[4:20] then we know that it wasn't just that
[4:22] they'd fallen in sin but everything in
[4:24] relationships began to fall number one
[4:27] their relationship with god was broken
[4:30] and their oneness with god was broken
[4:33] and that was the worst tragedy but not
[4:36] just their their relationship with god
[4:38] was broken and became strained and there
[4:41] was a wall between them and god not only
[4:43] their relationship with god but also
[4:45] their relationship with one another in
[4:47] their marriage and from that point on
[4:50] relationships were broken because of the
[4:53] fall of sin and so we elaborated on that
[4:55] talked about the relationships that took
[4:57] place in some of the attributes of
[4:59] fallen relationships and fallen things
[5:02] when man is away from god and when man
[5:04] is broken from god and away from god
[5:06] then we realize that he can't be right
[5:08] he can't be what he should be
[5:11] life is never correct life is never what
[5:13] it should be when we're not in
[5:15] relationship with god and so we
[5:17] elaborate on that but today i want to
[5:19] pick up the series again as i have just
[5:21] a little unfinished business to talk
[5:23] about because we don't want to leave man
[5:25] after the fall but we want to call talk
[5:28] about relationships after redemption
[5:31] relationships after redemption and we
[5:34] want to pick this up again
[5:36] relationships and what they look like
[5:39] and what they are and we're working out
[5:40] of the theme of the message oneness that
[5:43] the prophet preached the message oneness
[5:46] and we want to explore some
[5:49] windows in the scripture of after
[5:51] calvary and after resurrection we know
[5:54] the prophet said that this was the
[5:55] answer to fallen man is that he provided
[5:58] the only way for man to come back to him
[6:01] and the only way for our relationships
[6:03] to be right again and that is he would
[6:06] come and provide a sacrifice and he
[6:08] would deal with sin the reason he had to
[6:11] deal with sin is because we could not
[6:12] deal with our sin we there was nothing
[6:15] we could do there was no class there was
[6:17] no there was no uh bettering ourselves
[6:19] there was you could not deal with this
[6:22] this sin was so deeply rooted in us that
[6:24] only god himself could provide a way and
[6:28] praise the lord friends god provided a
[6:31] way through calvary and the resurrection
[6:33] for us to come back into relationship
[6:35] with god
[6:36] and so as as as the prophet was speaking
[6:39] on these things
[6:40] then we we jump to after the the calvary
[6:44] and resurrection and then when this
[6:46] great power began to come upon the
[6:48] people and he began to redeem his people
[6:50] by the holy ghost putting his spirit
[6:52] within them then we want to look at what
[6:54] happened right after that throughout the
[6:57] new testament because we want to see
[6:59] what relationships look like after a
[7:02] person has been redeemed because from
[7:04] what i understand everything that was
[7:07] lost in the garden god's power of
[7:09] redemption is powerful enough to redeem
[7:12] it all back and bring it all back not
[7:13] just half of it but all of it again
[7:17] uh and i'm glad it's that way so there's
[7:19] some windows in the scripture that talk
[7:21] about not only our relationship with god
[7:23] after we've been redeemed but our
[7:25] relationship with one another as well
[7:27] there's some windows in the scripture we
[7:29] want to look at as friday was the
[7:31] launching of the
[7:33] the homeschool co-op if you're a
[7:34] homeschooler it's a great group to be a
[7:36] part of and they asked me to do the
[7:38] devotion so we're just kicking that off
[7:40] on friday and we had a nice little time
[7:42] and in that little devotion i read some
[7:44] windows in the scripture of what jesus
[7:46] was doing when he was young we don't
[7:48] have a lot of picture of what he was
[7:50] doing when he was young but the
[7:52] scripture gave us a couple of windows to
[7:54] look at of what he was doing and we're
[7:56] thankful for that there's not a lot on
[7:58] it but there's enough there to we can
[8:00] see to give instruction i was telling
[8:02] the kids that god in his grace came down
[8:05] and lived out every age that we would
[8:07] live so that he would know how it feels
[8:09] to live in those ages and when we go to
[8:12] him in prayer he understands every age
[8:14] teenage eight years old five years old
[8:17] he was a baby can you say amen that's
[8:20] our god
[8:22] and so just taking that window but today
[8:25] we we do have some things to look at
[8:27] with what this was looking like
[8:29] of the power of god
[8:32] in people's lives after calvary after
[8:34] the resurrection and after they were
[8:36] filled with the holy ghost and that that
[8:39] we can praise the lord this morning that
[8:41] the oneness that was broken at eden was
[8:44] completely redeemed and restored and
[8:47] begin to express itself after they begin
[8:50] to come out of the upper room
[8:52] everything that was lost in eden was
[8:55] restored and they come out of that upper
[8:57] room with all the power laying within
[9:00] them that had been lost in the garden of
[9:02] eden can you say amen this is the way
[9:03] the prophet says that he said now then
[9:06] came
[9:07] it is this is in the message oneness if
[9:09] you just bring that microphone up here
[9:11] down just a little bit there's a bit of
[9:12] feedback now then came pentecost
[9:15] god made them one again then came
[9:18] pentecost god made them one again oh my
[9:22] then they had oneness with god god was
[9:25] in them now acts if you're putting it
[9:28] down acts 4 32 and this is the scripture
[9:30] i read as a text this morning the bible
[9:32] said that they were with one heart one
[9:35] soul
[9:36] one mind oh brother why they had been
[9:39] restored back to the original again can
[9:42] you say amen
[9:44] so all the oneness that they lost with
[9:46] god all the potential for oneness with
[9:49] one another that was lost in the garden
[9:52] pentecost got gave them the power to
[9:54] come back into oneness with god again
[9:57] they didn't have that before 400 years
[9:59] of the pharisees and sadducees
[10:01] developing all kinds of rules all kinds
[10:03] of regulations all the law everything
[10:06] was wonderful we appreciate the law we
[10:08] appreciate all that people have done but
[10:11] there was no true oneness with god until
[10:14] after they were filled with the holy
[10:16] ghost
[10:19] he said now then he said the only thing
[10:21] that they had left to be disposed of was
[10:23] an old city
[10:24] or they lived in there the old body
[10:26] called a senior temple that they lived
[10:28] in here that they had that had to rot
[10:30] because it had to die and corrupt but in
[10:33] listen to this now
[10:34] in spirit
[10:36] and life
[10:37] in purpose and in vision and everything
[10:41] they were one with god again
[10:45] i don't think there was enough amens on
[10:46] there i'm going to read it again in
[10:47] spirit when they come out of the upper
[10:49] room in spirit and life in purpose in
[10:53] vision and everything they were one with
[10:56] god just back just like back in the
[10:58] garden of eden can you say praise the
[10:59] lord
[11:01] if i'm hearing that right can you
[11:03] imagine now what kind of union this is
[11:05] that human beings had come back into
[11:08] such a union with god and with one
[11:11] another like eden again that the only
[11:13] thing missing was their theophany body
[11:18] in other words there wasn't anything
[11:19] else missing
[11:21] there wasn't anything else lacking when
[11:23] they come out of that upper room all the
[11:25] potential was with him everything was
[11:27] with everything that was lost in the
[11:30] garden of eden was all there
[11:33] and in purpose in vision in spirit in
[11:36] life
[11:37] everything was restored back
[11:40] praise the lord that's quite a powerful
[11:42] work of the lord that's why every one of
[11:45] us need to make sure lord fill me with
[11:47] the holy ghost
[11:49] not psychology can you say man not my
[11:51] own selfishness not my own plan to make
[11:54] myself better the holy ghost is we die
[11:57] out to him god let me make sure that i'm
[11:59] filled with the spirit of god because
[12:01] only through that path do we come back
[12:03] into oneness with god and only through
[12:05] that path do we find right marriages
[12:08] right relationships can you say family
[12:10] relationships can never be fully
[12:12] restored under psychology but only
[12:15] through the work of the holy ghost
[12:17] can i get a greater amen
[12:20] hallelujah so in in every way besides
[12:24] that theophany body that word body which
[12:27] is what they need we still need it but
[12:29] in every way they were one with god
[12:32] one with one another everything lost was
[12:35] put back into the believer again i'll
[12:37] tell you that's redemption everything
[12:39] was restored and those people coming
[12:41] down the stairs of that upper room
[12:44] had within them everything that adam and
[12:47] eve and eve had
[12:50] power
[12:52] dominion
[12:54] and that's the thing is that you
[12:55] couldn't
[12:56] you couldn't see any difference in them
[12:59] as far as their bodies
[13:02] except for
[13:04] they were a little drunk in the spirit
[13:08] how many knows they were drunk in the
[13:10] spirit
[13:11] but you couldn't see if if you're
[13:13] looking for the carnal eye you would
[13:15] watch them coming down on the upper room
[13:17] and you know something's changed because
[13:19] just the way they're acting shouting
[13:21] worshiping glorifying god and then god
[13:23] did a supernatural thing as they're
[13:25] shouting in their language the other
[13:27] people were hearing it in their own
[13:28] language so god could get the gospel out
[13:31] of what was taking place god did a
[13:32] supernatural thing but if you looked at
[13:34] them their eyes nose mouth their looks
[13:36] didn't change at all can you say man
[13:38] there was not a new body if they were
[13:40] old they were still old but i want to
[13:41] tell you when they come out of that
[13:43] upper room in every way they had come
[13:46] back into oneness as adam and eve again
[13:50] looking with the carnal eye didn't look
[13:52] like anything's different but i'll tell
[13:53] you it was different from that day on
[13:56] and they come down those people were
[13:58] coming down the stairs from the upper
[13:59] room with everything that adam and eve
[14:01] lost power dominion the only thing they
[14:04] still had that same body but in spirit
[14:07] all the potential was there they would
[14:09] not pray pray for it over time it was
[14:13] already in them but even those bodies as
[14:16] i said got so filled with god even those
[14:19] old bodies that were born in sin become
[14:21] drunk in the spirit
[14:24] how many has ever been drunk in the
[14:26] spirit of god
[14:27] just about six or seven of us
[14:30] it can happen
[14:32] we were here the night of worship and
[14:34] the lord came down in one of those songs
[14:36] the
[14:36] spirit was so strong just a few weeks
[14:38] ago and the reason i'm reliving it is
[14:41] brother kenny and i are doing some
[14:42] post-mixing to get the songs ready to
[14:44] put out and i i can't listen to them
[14:46] without still getting goosebumps and
[14:48] still feeling the presence of god and
[14:50] weeping in my truck
[14:52] and the lord came down there about the
[14:54] middle there and we just begin to sing
[14:56] that sing that course that we sang this
[14:58] morning
[14:59] hallelujah
[15:01] i'm telling you friends the lord showed
[15:03] up
[15:04] and we become so broken and so
[15:07] just awed by the presence of the lord
[15:09] just she just didn't want to
[15:10] speak it was wonderful how many has ever
[15:13] been in that presence
[15:16] and we're trying to mix the song that
[15:18] was after that and we can't hardly get
[15:20] it together because the singers didn't
[15:22] have it together
[15:24] they couldn't sing
[15:25] they couldn't sing a straight note
[15:28] because they were crying and broken and
[15:30] screaming in the presence of god and
[15:32] just could hardly pull themselves
[15:34] together for the next song that's being
[15:37] drunk in the spirit of god can you say a
[15:39] man he still does it friends
[15:42] [Applause]
[15:45] so all the potential was there and we
[15:48] see so many attributes that we had never
[15:51] seen before in the people of god in the
[15:52] book of acts begins to show this the
[15:55] book of acts begins to show uh what what
[15:59] god is doing now in oneness with his
[16:01] people and some of the attributes of it
[16:03] how many is thankful for the book of
[16:04] acts
[16:05] because we get it's the first account of
[16:08] what we begin to see what god looks like
[16:10] in this oneness back with his people
[16:12] again with power with dominion with
[16:15] signs with healing with wonders can you
[16:17] say amen so many things were happening
[16:19] and it's just like when the prophet said
[16:21] when the that tree of life christ he
[16:24] came two thousand years ago but he was
[16:26] the tree were the branches and when that
[16:29] tree of life put out his first branch it
[16:32] wrote a book of acts behind it
[16:35] that's why we have a book of acts
[16:37] because the branch came out from the
[16:39] tree and began to bring forth a fruit of
[16:41] what it would look like of god and his
[16:43] people again oneness in his people again
[16:48] when the the when the tree puts forth
[16:50] another branch
[16:52] he says it'll write another book of acts
[16:54] he says it'll write another book of acts
[16:55] so when this tree of life can you say
[16:57] amen in the last days because
[17:00] denominational creeds had destroyed it
[17:02] and ate away at it but when this pre
[17:04] tree puts out another branch in the end
[17:06] time it'll write another it's the way
[17:09] the prophet said it'll write another
[17:11] book of acts
[17:13] and guess what we're not waiting for
[17:15] that to come in the last 50 years this
[17:18] bride could write another book of acts
[17:21] they are healings there are wonders can
[17:23] you say amen there's restored
[17:25] relationships there's marriages restored
[17:27] can you say amen in the last 50 years
[17:30] since we received this word the the
[17:32] bride if we wrote it all down that's why
[17:34] i want your testimonies because we need
[17:36] to write it down and give the devil a
[17:38] black eye this bride could write another
[17:40] book of acts
[17:46] we can start from last week
[17:48] when our sister laura was prayed for
[17:50] had a lump
[17:52] worried about the lump
[17:53] laid a prayer cloth on her went this
[17:56] week there's nothing to it there's
[17:58] there's absolutely nothing to it
[17:59] whatsoever
[18:01] can you say man
[18:02] we can write another book of acts
[18:05] and then we just keep going back 50
[18:07] years the dead raised
[18:10] can you say amen
[18:14] hallelujah
[18:16] so and so now i
[18:18] i i build our faith with that but
[18:20] remember now
[18:22] the supernatural is there
[18:25] the apostles doctrine is there that's a
[18:27] part of the book of acts because they
[18:29] continued in the apostles doctrine you
[18:31] can't have a church without having
[18:32] doctrine can you say amen
[18:35] there was no church order there put in
[18:37] place yet i want to say that that in the
[18:39] book of acts there really wasn't any
[18:41] church order in place yet
[18:44] and you know they were doing good we
[18:46] just needed the church order later paul
[18:48] said we're going to need this we're
[18:49] going to put stuff in order
[18:51] there was no modesty teaching
[18:53] in the book of acts
[18:56] that's awful quiet
[18:59] that came later
[19:01] had to talk about those things later and
[19:03] what's interesting friends is a lot of
[19:05] times with a denominational spirit we
[19:08] will reach to the church order part we
[19:10] will reach to the dress part
[19:13] and we'll make that the emphasis if we
[19:15] can just get everybody just right and
[19:17] all those things and if we can have
[19:18] church order just right that's the
[19:20] vindication that we're the bride that's
[19:22] not the vindication where the bride the
[19:24] book of acts is the vindication that
[19:26] we're the bride i'm not eliminating
[19:28] church order i'm not a living modesty
[19:30] but if we jump past the book of acts if
[19:33] we jump past the life
[19:36] of the holy ghost
[19:38] and we jump right to the other stuff we
[19:40] make a denomination out of it
[19:44] you can do that i can do that anybody's
[19:46] susceptible to do that and what we need
[19:48] first before any of that is we need the
[19:50] life of the book of acts the life of the
[19:52] holy ghost
[19:54] because when you got that you can move
[19:55] forward with the lord
[19:57] come on now i should be getting greater
[19:59] amen than that
[20:01] there was no church order but there but
[20:04] life was there
[20:05] oneness was there you know it was just a
[20:08] simple thing but it was powerful
[20:11] no church order set up yet but
[20:14] life
[20:17] i tell you when we have life and when we
[20:20] have
[20:21] what they had in the book of acts
[20:23] when we have oneness
[20:26] i'm happy
[20:30] i love church order but church order
[20:32] without life i don't want that
[20:36] that's getting something that's that's
[20:37] the cart before the horse you have to
[20:39] have the life of pentecost the life of
[20:42] god the oneness the relationship with
[20:44] the lord first
[20:46] it has to be a relationship with the
[20:48] lord
[20:50] amen
[20:51] i want the life of what happened in
[20:52] those people i want the oneness can you
[20:54] say amen i want the relationship that
[20:56] they had with god i want the
[20:58] relationship that they had with one
[21:00] another after redemption this is what it
[21:02] looks like and it starts right away in
[21:05] our text and says they are of one mind
[21:08] and one heart and brother braham says
[21:09] that's the oneness it was pure one mind
[21:12] and one heart and all of a sudden so i'm
[21:15] just going to start elaborating on these
[21:17] these attributes of what it looked like
[21:19] in in um
[21:21] in
[21:22] the days of the book of acts
[21:24] let me just say this just a minute
[21:29] we had the supernatural manifested
[21:32] we had the life of god and the people we
[21:34] had oneness
[21:36] we had all those things happening but
[21:38] quite often the supernatural gets
[21:40] emphasized
[21:41] more than the oneness
[21:45] and quite often i've heard preachers
[21:47] many times
[21:49] bring it down to where that's the full
[21:51] vindication
[21:52] of the bride if we have the supernatural
[21:55] working among us and we have prophecies
[21:58] and we have all this going on that's the
[22:00] vindication that we're the bride and i
[22:01] just want to remind everybody that
[22:03] that's not the full vindication of the
[22:05] bride
[22:07] we should always have that god should
[22:09] always be dealing with us our young
[22:11] people need to see the power of god in a
[22:13] supernatural god but it's not the final
[22:15] vindication of we the bride because
[22:18] people out there in charismatics and all
[22:21] that god can honor faith and they can
[22:23] have the supernatural happen out there
[22:26] you can't put god in a box
[22:29] i might lose some of you right here but
[22:31] i'm going to just plunge on ahead you
[22:33] cannot isolate that to being the only
[22:35] vindication of the bride it's part of it
[22:37] but it's not the final vindication
[22:40] [Applause]
[22:42] they have healings there they have
[22:44] prayer lines they have results
[22:47] because it's our god that does it and he
[22:49] honors faith
[22:53] prophecies some of them come to pass
[22:56] sometimes some of them don't but they
[22:57] have true prophecies that come to pass
[23:00] they say well that's the book of acts
[23:01] church that's what happened you know
[23:03] somebody walked in the shadow of peter
[23:05] and they were healed right in the first
[23:07] few chapters praise be to god can that
[23:09] happen again yes that can happen again
[23:11] but don't make that the only vindication
[23:15] that it's the bride of jesus christ
[23:22] and i want to remind us as well that
[23:25] before the oneness of pentecost came in
[23:27] the holy ghost
[23:29] jesus had already given his disciples
[23:32] power
[23:35] without the holy ghost in their soul
[23:39] to pray for the sick and to cast out
[23:42] devils
[23:46] you did remember that right
[23:48] that they had that power
[23:52] to cast out devils before they had the
[23:54] holy ghost but they had no power for
[23:57] oneness
[23:59] they had now power to come in oneness
[24:00] with god they had no power to come in
[24:02] oneness with one another there was
[24:04] nothing there they couldn't even become
[24:06] one with christ i'll read a quote in a
[24:07] minute they couldn't even become
[24:09] completely one with christ they couldn't
[24:11] get on the same page with them they
[24:12] didn't understand why he was leaving
[24:14] they didn't understand the word there
[24:15] was hardly any revelation there can you
[24:17] say amen but they could cast out devils
[24:19] because we know when they came back they
[24:21] rejoice that even the devils are subject
[24:24] to us
[24:25] without the holy ghost
[24:31] so don't make that the final vindication
[24:34] of the bride that this is the bride
[24:37] because she can cast out devils because
[24:39] they were doing that before
[24:41] and you remember the other incident when
[24:43] they come back rejoicing he said don't
[24:45] rejoice because the devils are subject
[24:47] to you don't just be shouting because
[24:50] devils are being cast out
[24:53] the reason for your worship should not
[24:55] only be prophecies and casting out the
[24:59] devil he said don't rejoice because the
[25:01] devils are subject rejoice because your
[25:04] names are written in the lamb's book of
[25:06] life that's our worship
[25:09] the lamb's book of life the seven seals
[25:11] has been taken off it and i'm in oneness
[25:14] with god i know who i am i know from the
[25:17] foundation of the world who i am i see
[25:20] my name in the book of life
[25:22] that ought to make somebody shout the
[25:24] aisles
[25:29] you see how we can get off track
[25:30] sometimes and i mean it very
[25:32] respectfully because i'm a man who
[25:33] believes in the supernatural god they
[25:35] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[25:36] shall recover i'm a man who's cast out
[25:38] devils before i know what devils look
[25:40] like and i know how to cast them out and
[25:42] i'm going to keep doing it i do a lot of
[25:44] it while i'm preaching right now
[25:47] yes yeah yeah every sunday i cast out
[25:49] devils
[25:50] while i'm preaching
[25:55] but the power to do that stuff we got to
[25:57] be careful that we we don't make that
[25:58] the final vindication
[26:00] and
[26:01] so then
[26:02] what do we look at at the end time as
[26:05] the vindication they will write another
[26:08] book of acts
[26:09] okay so now even in the revival of the
[26:11] bride if we only look at the
[26:13] manifestation of miracles and signs and
[26:16] wonders you're only isolating one part
[26:19] of the book of acts but there's other
[26:20] parts in there i'll just say this is
[26:22] that if you're a book of acts church
[26:25] then it wasn't just the signs and
[26:27] miracles and wonders
[26:28] but when
[26:31] when the couple there
[26:33] lied about what they brought before the
[26:35] lord
[26:36] somebody help me out ananias friar which
[26:38] is just a few chapters in as well
[26:41] the holy ghost the book of acts church
[26:42] discerned that the holy ghost discerned
[26:44] it
[26:45] and didn't let it buy
[26:48] so how can we have just a lot of
[26:50] just a lot of casting out devils and yet
[26:53] i've watched in some churches where they
[26:55] can have a lot of that and a lot of
[26:57] prophecies and a sexual
[27:00] a pornography demon is binding somebody
[27:03] for 20 years
[27:07] and i think if it's a full back of a
[27:09] book of acts church
[27:10] i think it ought to be discerning
[27:12] those spirits as well
[27:16] how does it just sit there and miss the
[27:18] discernment of the holy spirit
[27:20] and that gets a free pass no when you're
[27:22] in the presence of the holy spirit
[27:24] nothing gets a free pass we stand open
[27:26] before him lord correct me lord change
[27:29] my life and lord deliver me from this
[27:31] devil it's not just devils of sickness
[27:34] and cancer
[27:35] and a lump and a little this no it's not
[27:37] just physical but it's mental healing
[27:40] can you say amen it's devils that plague
[27:42] our minds
[27:43] [Applause]
[27:46] and the book of acts church had it all
[27:48] can you say amen
[27:50] and they had oneness with god
[27:53] and one another and so if we're looking
[27:54] at the final vindication it's not just
[27:56] the supernatural
[28:00] i'd rather hear things like full
[28:02] adoption
[28:04] and when i say adoption we all come to
[28:06] an adoption the final age a bunch of
[28:09] intellectuals with our
[28:11] phones and our table on our phones
[28:13] and doctrinally we're intellectuals
[28:16] that's not the book of acts
[28:18] book of acts was life
[28:20] life of the holy ghost overcoming every
[28:23] day oneness with god fellowship with one
[28:25] another fellowship in the presence of
[28:28] god
[28:30] at the end time it's all changing and we
[28:33] get rid of all that pentecostal stuff
[28:35] and we become high intellectuals that's
[28:37] a that's not adoption to me
[28:40] but let me hear some sermons about the
[28:42] final vindication being adoption
[28:45] and being capstone love
[28:49] because i thought the final thing
[28:52] was this capstone of love coming down in
[28:55] the bride
[28:57] not
[28:58] mamsey pamsy love
[29:01] not a passive hate for one another
[29:04] but divine
[29:05] capstone love being poured into the
[29:08] bride and that brings it to a climax
[29:11] let's hear some sermons about the
[29:12] vindication of the bride being the only
[29:14] ones truly that can come to capstone
[29:17] love
[29:21] amen
[29:23] [Applause]
[29:25] praise the lord now that i got that off
[29:26] my chest
[29:28] we'll move on
[29:30] here's another thing that that happened
[29:32] it said
[29:33] what they owned
[29:36] all of a sudden something huge changed
[29:37] with the holy ghost and with oneness
[29:40] what they owned they did no longer say
[29:43] this is mine
[29:46] what's mine is mine and what's yours and
[29:49] yours yours is yours
[29:51] let me say that again
[29:54] what's mine is mine i own it what's
[29:57] yours is yours
[29:59] keep it separate leave me alone
[30:02] i have my life you have your life
[30:09] all that gets washed away
[30:13] now i might lose some of you
[30:16] i'm talking about what the book of acts
[30:18] did in the church to bring oneness and
[30:20] to bring relationship
[30:24] and it burned out
[30:26] this this is
[30:28] this is mine and you know uh my
[30:31] granddaughter just hit this stage the
[30:33] last six months
[30:36] where she begin to recognize what's hers
[30:40] you know we didn't teach her that in
[30:41] fact we teach her the other way right he
[30:42] said no share share with people
[30:45] and i'll tell you you can hear some real
[30:47] reactions out of them sometimes because
[30:49] there's certain things they are not
[30:51] going to share
[30:54] mine and then get oh this is mine you
[30:56] don't get it she won't even share her
[30:58] popsicle with me
[31:02] my popsicle nana gave it to me it's mine
[31:05] where's the salsa from a fallen nature
[31:10] and there's our divine this is my stuff
[31:12] and that's your stuff and then we can
[31:14] fight over it and then even siblings can
[31:16] say but that's mine and we bring it to
[31:18] the court of mom and dad to settle whose
[31:20] it really is
[31:22] it all comes from a fall in nature
[31:27] but we we might as well not
[31:29] laugh at my granddaughter or laugh at
[31:31] your children that do it as well we
[31:32] might not laugh because what does it
[31:33] speak up it speaks of children it speaks
[31:36] of immaturity so it speaks of immaturity
[31:38] say this is mine it speaks of immaturity
[31:42] that's in adults sometimes
[31:46] to act like children
[31:48] and say this is mine
[31:51] this is all mine
[31:54] so it's an attribute of children even if
[31:56] they're adults
[31:57] and i'm here to tell you
[31:58] the the change of the holy ghost and
[32:01] redemption begin to change this is mine
[32:04] thing this is mine
[32:06] and so now it's it's now
[32:09] that they begin to consider
[32:12] it common property in other words for
[32:15] the use of all
[32:18] i want to emphasize that this it's not
[32:20] just about property it's not just about
[32:21] what you own but it became common the
[32:24] word common is that
[32:26] you're and you remember as we elaborated
[32:29] on the fall in the beginning
[32:31] the first thing they did after the fall
[32:33] is begin to blame each other
[32:35] begin to brother brahm said pass the
[32:37] buck to one another
[32:38] they begin to act alone as separate
[32:41] entities eve begin to act alone adam
[32:43] begin to act alone and they begin
[32:46] fighting for themselves to protect their
[32:48] their own cells and blame somebody else
[32:51] and become very selfish they never were
[32:53] that way before but the fall brought in
[32:55] selfishness
[32:57] the fall broke relationships and you
[32:59] cannot have you cannot have decent
[33:01] relationship with selfishness involved
[33:03] you can't have a right marriage with
[33:04] selfishness you got it in your mind this
[33:07] i'm marrying this person they're going
[33:08] to meet all my needs
[33:09] all the needs that i want they're going
[33:11] to actually going to do it just this way
[33:13] and you're just on the wrong track
[33:15] buster
[33:17] you know
[33:18] it's to lay down your lives to one
[33:20] another it's saying i'm entering this
[33:22] marriage how can i make their life
[33:24] better how can i meet their needs
[33:27] that's a christian marriage
[33:30] amen because that came after redemption
[33:32] and we will get into that what marriage
[33:34] looks like after redemption we will get
[33:36] into that not today but they considered
[33:39] it common property for the use of all
[33:41] and and after the fall they were blaming
[33:42] one another standing alone as separate
[33:44] entities before they were one with one
[33:46] another adam was saying this is bone of
[33:48] my blown flesh of my flesh she's one
[33:50] with me if she does this i'm a part of
[33:53] her she's a part of me and it's all
[33:54] oneness after the fall he's saying the
[33:57] woman did this he did it he's protecting
[33:59] himself
[34:01] it came from the fall it comes in our
[34:02] fallen nature
[34:06] and and blaming one another and then he
[34:08] comes to the woman and she blames the
[34:10] serpent and and so
[34:12] but you see in this book of acts church
[34:14] friends it was no more it's whatever is
[34:17] mine is theirs whatever happens to them
[34:20] happens to me if there's a need if
[34:23] there's a burden then i have a need and
[34:25] i have a burden if there's a
[34:28] something that's happened to them then
[34:30] it's happened to me because i am one
[34:32] with them we are together in this we
[34:35] have all things common it wasn't just
[34:37] possessions but it was the whole spirit
[34:39] amongst the people that there was no big
[34:43] eyes or little yous or better people or
[34:45] better dressed people or rich or poor
[34:48] see that's the world we live in it's
[34:50] categories of people it's categories the
[34:52] rich the poor the preppies the the
[34:55] uglies the good-lookings it's it's
[34:57] separated us all none of that belongs in
[34:59] the body of christ it's all things are
[35:02] common and we're all saved by grace
[35:08] there is no
[35:10] people and anybody who gets a promotion
[35:14] becomes more of a servant
[35:20] anybody who gets more popular or becomes
[35:23] some we don't have idols and celebrities
[35:26] in this message i get so tired of it
[35:28] that doesn't belong in the in the
[35:29] message at all celebrity preachers and
[35:32] celebrity singers and and all these
[35:35] things it doesn't belong here at all
[35:40] if your gift gets better and better and
[35:42] effective to more people around the
[35:44] world that should make you more humble
[35:47] and you look at yourself less not a
[35:49] celebrity but less and you better stay
[35:52] humble before the lord because in that
[35:54] popularity you're a subject that can
[35:56] follow yourself
[35:59] stuff doesn't belong amongst the body of
[36:02] christ can you say amen
[36:04] they lost this whatever happens to them
[36:06] happens to me because they this other
[36:08] person next next if they didn't have
[36:11] churches yet so they met in houses this
[36:13] pretty person sitting on the couch next
[36:14] to my next to me now i'm not trying to
[36:17] look them look at them in the chair and
[36:20] examine where they came from and put
[36:22] them in a category and they're sitting
[36:23] there in that chair and we're sitting
[36:26] there in the same house and and so there
[36:28] no more were they looking back and say
[36:30] look at what he wears and looking about
[36:32] all this stuff and judging him by the
[36:34] outside i wonder where he comes from and
[36:36] then he starts to share and we prejudge
[36:38] them
[36:39] that was washed away friends washed away
[36:43] because they were together they had all
[36:45] things in common and if he has the holy
[36:47] spirit he's just as much a part of god
[36:50] as i'm a part of god
[36:58] i'm not above him because i'm the pastor
[37:01] this young man got baptized last year
[37:03] god is transforming his life i'm no
[37:05] better as a pastor i'm a brother in
[37:07] christ to this man and he has the same
[37:09] inheritance on the other side as i have
[37:12] the same inheritance
[37:23] is this okay with everybody
[37:28] so so life our life is shared our
[37:30] possessions it's strange that this is
[37:33] brought up
[37:34] uh they didn't view people as being rich
[37:37] and poor anymore
[37:38] whether they were or not it's kind of
[37:40] strange because you would think back in
[37:41] that time most of people were poor more
[37:43] likely they were but there were some
[37:44] rich people um different ones they were
[37:46] rich and it speaks here of
[37:49] of uh
[37:50] barnabas
[37:51] probably being a richer man selling some
[37:54] of his lands to go to the needs of the
[37:56] people and so there were some rich but
[37:58] more likely it was a lot of it poor so
[38:00] whether or not they were poor or not
[38:03] possessions
[38:05] must have a way of
[38:07] putting people in categories of better
[38:09] or worse
[38:13] possessions
[38:15] can possess us
[38:22] and i read a quote a couple weeks ago or
[38:24] maybe this last sunday i'm starting to
[38:25] forget from sunday to sunday but you
[38:27] know he said you have a family come into
[38:29] the lord and they're blessed and they're
[38:31] having family prayer together and
[38:33] they're excited they got life and i'm
[38:34] paraphrasing but he goes and they're
[38:36] doing fine and then god gives them a
[38:37] little money god blesses their business
[38:39] and they get this and they get that they
[38:41] get a new car they get a new house they
[38:43] move up he gets a promotion and so all
[38:46] of a sudden if they're not careful now
[38:47] all of a sudden the family prayer goes
[38:49] the life of god goes church goes
[38:52] everything gets to be laid aside
[38:54] and anybody could do it possessions have
[38:56] a way of possessing us
[38:58] maybe that's why they're mentioned in
[39:00] the book of acts whether you have a lot
[39:01] of them or whether you don't have a lot
[39:03] of them when the holy ghost came to
[39:05] these people possessions were not the
[39:08] most important things so much so they
[39:10] said i'm going to let go of this because
[39:12] there's a need over here i'm going to
[39:13] sell this and i'm going to give the
[39:15] money to help this need
[39:18] that's when it's sacrificial giving
[39:20] because sometimes when you're thinking
[39:21] of your retirement
[39:23] you think the book of acts church was
[39:24] thinking of retirement
[39:28] i don't have any hint of it in the book
[39:30] of acts
[39:32] except for this couple who kept back
[39:34] apart
[39:37] and who knows maybe they were saying but
[39:40] if we do this it's going to jeopardize
[39:42] our retirement
[39:44] right
[39:45] so they went and said it was this price
[39:47] it was they lied to the holy ghost it
[39:48] wasn't that they wasn't any problem
[39:49] keeping something back they lied about
[39:51] it
[39:54] they lied about what they were giving
[39:56] better be honest with your tithes and
[39:58] your offerings and what you give and if
[40:00] that's really the amount of your tithes
[40:02] 10 is holy to the lord
[40:06] and only you and god know
[40:08] that you better be honest about it
[40:10] listen i don't need your money i'm not
[40:12] preaching this for myself i don't need
[40:13] your money but god has a principle can
[40:15] you say amen don't be dishonest about it
[40:19] possessions have a way of putting people
[40:21] in categories of better or worse
[40:23] levels of success we live in a world of
[40:25] levels of success and
[40:27] degrees and and and we measure a person
[40:30] based upon degrees or houses or lands or
[40:34] the kind of car they drive or success
[40:37] that they've been we measure people
[40:39] based upon their gifts that they have we
[40:41] measure people upon their better looks
[40:43] that they have
[40:45] and this is not based upon
[40:47] looks or gifts or successes
[40:50] it's all washed away
[40:53] can you say man
[40:55] if this would have been based upon who
[40:56] was rich a lot of you would be out
[41:00] if it was based upon the good looking a
[41:02] lot of you would be out
[41:06] finished if this was based upon and i
[41:08] think i look pretty good but i know in
[41:10] comparison to the world
[41:12] if this kingdom of god was based upon
[41:14] good looks i wouldn't have made it in
[41:17] and i'm glad it wasn't based upon good
[41:20] luck
[41:23] i'm glad it wasn't based upon prestige
[41:25] or how many businesses i get or how
[41:28] successful i make it in life
[41:31] it's not based upon any of that
[41:35] none of it
[41:37] it's do you have the spirit of god
[41:38] within you
[41:39] and if you have the spirit of god guess
[41:41] what
[41:42] you're a millionaire spiritually
[41:46] so they let loose of relation they let
[41:48] loose of all relationships based upon
[41:50] status or position let loose a pride of
[41:53] selfishness they sold things sometimes
[41:55] you have to let go of something that
[41:56] you're holding on to so dearly they sold
[41:58] it
[41:59] maybe that's a good thing the holy ghost
[42:01] made them do that many times they just
[42:02] sold it got rid of it they're tied to
[42:04] something you ever seen somebody just so
[42:06] so obsessed and tied to something some
[42:08] possession that they have
[42:09] they're just that's it that's the
[42:11] ultimate that might be something you
[42:12] need to pray about and look at because
[42:14] you should never be that tied to
[42:15] something
[42:16] for status can you say amen
[42:19] supply someone else's needs sometimes so
[42:21] in conclusion in this part god purged
[42:24] the hearts in the book of acts he purged
[42:27] the hearts of self-focused self-pride
[42:30] true and brought true fellowship and
[42:33] love that could work amongst the people
[42:35] in relationships why because no one was
[42:39] better than the other they all had been
[42:42] promoted by the holy ghost they had all
[42:45] been promoted
[42:47] they had all received the promotion to
[42:50] sons of abraham
[42:52] can i get an amen they had all come to
[42:55] the sons of abraham and thus become
[42:57] spiritual millionaires they were all
[43:00] treated as the royalty of heaven
[43:08] every person
[43:09] should be treated
[43:10] as the royalty
[43:12] of heaven amen
[43:15] this is the son of king son of a king
[43:18] i'm talking to
[43:19] brother brown even brought it into your
[43:21] marriage and he says when you marry that
[43:22] person
[43:23] even when she gets old and have gray
[43:25] hair she said you should treat her right
[43:27] and you should treat her as a daughter
[43:28] of the king because she was a daughter
[43:29] of the king before she married you
[43:32] king
[43:34] well i'm king now well you're not the
[43:36] big king
[43:41] you're not the big king there's a king
[43:42] higher than you and that daughter of the
[43:45] king if she was serving the lord filled
[43:46] with the holy ghost she has someone
[43:48] higher than you
[43:50] and you better respect that daughter of
[43:53] a king and you girl better respect that
[43:56] son of a king
[43:58] that's the way we look at it after the
[44:00] book of acts after redemption we're to
[44:02] redeem to a royal family can you say
[44:04] amen don't buy into all these ideas from
[44:07] hollywood and how we treat one another
[44:09] and calling one another an old bag and
[44:11] all this other stuff
[44:14] take our cues from the word of god we're
[44:16] royalty friends we're royalty can you
[44:18] say amen our children are royalty we
[44:20] should treat one another in our homes
[44:23] like royalty
[44:27] praise the lord amen i'm rich this
[44:30] morning
[44:32] i'm rich in faith and how many is rich
[44:34] this morning you're spiritual
[44:35] billionaires this morning
[44:37] i like how trump says billionaires is
[44:39] bill billions he's got an emphasis on
[44:41] billions he likes to say that word
[44:43] because he's a billionaire
[44:45] billion you're a spiritual billionaire
[44:47] i'm rich in faith and hope and love
[44:51] i've gotten more than my share
[44:54] i've been moving to my mansion just over
[44:57] in glory where i'm a rightfully

[45:25] knowing that i'm his son
[45:28] well i'm rich in faith and hope and love
[45:33] i've gotten more than my shed
[45:35] i'll be moving to my mansion just over
[45:38] in glory where i'm a rightfully
[45:43] amen hallelujah
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:48] the rule is if nobody sings a special
[45:50] then i sing one and i just sing it for
[45:52] you
[45:53] look at that acts 2. look what it says
[45:56] they continued steadfastly in the
[45:58] apostles doctrine
[46:02] continued so this is this is a
[46:05] relationship with god after redemption
[46:08] they continued steadfastly
[46:11] consistently staying around
[46:13] the presence of god
[46:15] consistently staying around this wasn't
[46:17] a once in a cat meeting thing i'll make
[46:20] it to jerusalem once a year for the camp
[46:21] meeting
[46:23] it continued step this is the
[46:25] relationship they have with god it
[46:27] wasn't a one-nighter
[46:29] it wasn't every week at church this is a
[46:32] daily continued
[46:34] steadfast
[46:36] in the word
[46:37] in the apostles doctrine and why were
[46:40] they doing it because they had relations
[46:42] that they were connected with the lord
[46:44] in their souls can you say amen and when
[46:46] you're connected with the lord you're
[46:48] hungry i've got to hear more of the word
[46:49] i want to know more of the word i want
[46:51] to stay in fellowship with the word and
[46:53] i want to be steadfast i want to be
[46:55] consistent i want to continually be
[46:57] doing it today we have no consistency in
[47:00] things people are in and out they're up
[47:01] and down
[47:03] they're in and out of this and that they
[47:04] can't stay committed to something they
[47:06] can't stay committed to jobs many times
[47:08] they can't be consistent and some people
[47:10] can be ever committed to their jobs to
[47:12] be there every morning on time but
[47:15] you're not consistent with the lord in
[47:17] your relationship
[47:19] these people were so changed that they
[47:21] love the lord so much they continued
[47:24] steadfastly in a relationship with the
[47:27] lord
[47:29] doctrine's teachings and then it says
[47:31] they continued in the fellowship too it
[47:33] wasn't just it wasn't just the doctrine
[47:36] it wasn't just staying steadfast they
[47:39] were steadfast in their fellowship
[47:42] praise the lord
[47:44] they were
[47:45] steadfast
[47:46] in
[47:47] goes on to say
[47:49] uh in breaking a bread together
[47:53] the lord's supper
[47:55] and
[47:56] rather just i had a
[48:00] a message here a few months ago and i
[48:01] don't think
[48:03] i'm going to use myself i don't think we
[48:06] we applied it as much as we should
[48:09] that we are one
[48:11] and
[48:14] we should encourage
[48:17] times to be
[48:18] together i don't know what it is people
[48:21] are afraid of people today
[48:24] people have their walls up even to the
[48:26] body of christ sometimes
[48:29] people come from a lot people go through
[48:30] things and i understand that i want to
[48:33] understand it better but
[48:35] but when it comes to the book of acts is
[48:36] that they they encourage brother josiah
[48:38] was saying just
[48:40] make a phone call
[48:41] call and encourage that person
[48:43] invite him over for coffee get the
[48:46] families together they were together
[48:49] they were together
[48:54] i guess it comes back to priorities and
[48:56] people get discouraged sometimes
[48:59] because they go to a church and they
[49:00] don't know people because nobody opens
[49:02] up for fellowship
[49:08] it's not my notes i just i'm just
[49:10] feeling to say this
[49:12] go back and listen to brother josiah's
[49:13] message i think the lord was speaking to
[49:15] this congregation
[49:16] and we enjoy our sundays together but
[49:18] listen now you can't find any better
[49:21] friendships and fellowship to form than
[49:24] amongst the body of christ and i know
[49:27] the devil has told you they don't want
[49:29] it i'm scared of them and the devil's
[49:31] told you they might hurt me or whatever
[49:33] listen you always have the potential
[49:34] from hurt for hurt but listen we're the
[49:37] devil is robbing us
[49:41] of relationships
[49:45] do what you can to open up
[49:48] and reach out amen
[49:51] to your brothers and sisters
[49:54] maybe these testimonies will help when
[49:56] you read their testimony say man i
[49:57] didn't know that they did that i didn't
[49:59] know they had pierced ears and long hair
[50:02] like that i didn't know they were a
[50:03] biker you know i'm sitting next to them
[50:05] and god's changed them to transform them
[50:07] i didn't know he was involved in drugs
[50:09] and i was involved in drugs and you
[50:11] share your testimonies of what god's
[50:13] done in your life you make a connection
[50:15] there
[50:17] maybe the testimonies will help
[50:20] we're too isolated in our own worlds
[50:23] but a book of acts church says lord i'm
[50:25] going to let go of these things
[50:27] and the most important place i can be is
[50:29] around the word
[50:30] and around your people as we get ready
[50:32] for a rapture and we are going to go
[50:34] together
[50:36] that's right
[50:37] why don't we start worshiping like we're
[50:39] already there
[50:40] why don't we start fellowshipping like
[50:42] we're already there why don't we have
[50:43] oneness like we're already there can i
[50:45] get an amen this morning
[50:48] he's so together they had all things
[50:50] come there were signs
[50:52] let's finish it now and fear and so i
[50:54] didn't finish it doctrine and fellowship
[50:57] they continued steadfastly in doctrine
[50:59] and fellowship and in breaking of bread
[51:01] and in prayers we're gonna have the
[51:02] lord's supper tonight
[51:04] and fear came upon every soul that was
[51:06] respect and many wonders and signs were
[51:09] done by the apostles can you say praise
[51:11] the lord
[51:12] never eliminate that and all that
[51:14] believed were together
[51:18] and had all things
[51:20] common
[51:21] the system of positions
[51:23] and great ones and little ones
[51:27] was all gone
[51:30] brother brahm says in oneness the
[51:31] disciples even walking with jesus
[51:35] in oneness the disciples even walking
[51:37] with jesus i mean that quote now says
[51:40] the disciples even walking with jesus
[51:43] they didn't have no oneness they didn't
[51:46] have any unity no you have that quote
[51:49] says
[51:50] i wanted them to see that
[51:53] the disciples even walking with jesus
[51:55] they didn't have no oneness they didn't
[51:58] have any unity no they argued here's the
[52:02] disciples around jesus all the time
[52:07] jesus
[52:09] around his ministry around the son of
[52:11] man ministry
[52:13] walking with jesus they didn't have no
[52:15] oneness they didn't have no unity no
[52:17] they argued who's going to be
[52:20] bishop after this
[52:24] man could i preach now
[52:26] how many ministries in this message have
[52:30] risen up and had arguments about who's
[52:33] gonna take over from here
[52:37] so i'm gonna call it what it is you
[52:39] don't have any oneness yet with this
[52:42] lord when you're arguing about who's the
[52:44] greatest preacher
[52:48] fussing and stewing
[52:50] i can i can read you a quote in the
[52:52] token where he says he says he says
[52:54] pentecost fussing and stewing with one
[52:56] another shows the token is not showing
[53:00] man
[53:03] still got fussing going on who's this
[53:05] and now there's a new term they're using
[53:07] the supreme ministry in the message
[53:09] they're using it among themselves the
[53:10] supreme who taught you that there's a
[53:13] supreme ministry in the message
[53:15] who taught you that we're supposed to
[53:17] follow and be childlike like you said to
[53:19] the corinthian children they were
[53:21] children you're carnal he says because
[53:22] i'm of cephas and i'm a paul and they
[53:25] were already dividing over that because
[53:26] the antichrist spirit was making them
[53:28] selfish again to say i'm of this
[53:31] preacher i only go to his cat meetings
[53:33] i'll go if he's preaching if somebody
[53:35] else is preaching i'm not going to go
[53:37] and all these divides and categories it
[53:39] doesn't belong in the message at all
[53:43] and any gift that rises in popularity
[53:47] they should become more humble and we
[53:49] should never lift them up too high
[53:57] we're guilty of it
[53:59] come on now we're guilty of it
[54:01] we see a ministry rise up and oh that's
[54:03] where everybody needs to go we follow
[54:05] after it and and i'm i'm weary of it i'm
[54:08] weary of it in my soul i i don't want a
[54:11] big church i don't want a big ministry i
[54:13] thank the lord for the testimonies but
[54:14] we've been there we've done that we've
[54:16] got the t-shirt and people gravitate
[54:18] towards that and sometimes when you lift
[54:19] a man up you set him up for a fall we
[54:22] don't want to do that may that be washed
[54:24] away in the body of christ and maybe we
[54:26] come humbly before him every gift among
[54:29] us that's of the lord we received it and
[54:32] i got pastors that i know that some of
[54:34] my personal friends got a church of
[54:36] about 12 15 people they'll never be at a
[54:38] convention they'll never preach a
[54:40] convention they're nobodies but they're
[54:42] not nobodies to me and they're not
[54:44] nobodies to god they'll receive the same
[54:47] reward on the other side
[54:49] because they're steadfast they're
[54:50] faithful they're preaching this message
[54:52] and you'll never know their names
[54:56] they're no names
[54:57] but god knows the no names
[55:00] they're in the lamb's book of life
[55:04] got all this struggle and these
[55:06] disciples can you imagine right in front
[55:08] of the lord
[55:09] arguing and he picks up on it what i
[55:11] know what you guys are arguing and then
[55:13] he says things like are you able to
[55:15] drink of the cup that i'm going to drink
[55:17] of
[55:18] well no they weren't ready to do that
[55:21] they were childish and selfish and
[55:24] looking for positions and they they they
[55:27] couldn't even believe jesus they
[55:28] couldn't understand it thou speakest and
[55:29] riddles tell us plainly what you mean
[55:31] there was no unity between jesus and
[55:33] disciples or disciples of jesus and
[55:35] disciples among one another but i want
[55:36] to emphasize this bishop part this this
[55:39] thing that keeps us
[55:41] in circles around our ranks that we keep
[55:43] following after and looking for the next
[55:45] big ministry and the next big thing we
[55:47] need to stop doing that serve the lord
[55:50] be filled with the spirit find out who
[55:53] your pastor is serve him humbly before
[55:56] the lord and leave it at
[56:00] that praise the lord
[56:05] who's going to be the greatest that
[56:07] shows no oneness was showing because
[56:08] when the book of acts came and
[56:09] redemption came
[56:12] all that was washed away
[56:15] how many years are we going to continue
[56:17] to look for the next big ministry
[56:28] disciples were around jesus
[56:31] but no relationship
[56:36] could it be
[56:42] they they come and say but lord in your
[56:45] name
[56:47] have we not cast out devils
[56:50] have we not prophesied
[56:52] have we not done many wonderful works
[56:55] and he says depart from me because why
[56:59] there was no relationship
[57:02] i never knew you in an intimate
[57:04] relationship you were in the message you
[57:05] were around jesus you're around the son
[57:07] of man just like disciples
[57:09] but you never knew me
[57:12] no oneness
[57:15] the baptism of the holy ghost that i'm
[57:17] closing now
[57:18] is more about life and relationship
[57:22] than even the supernatural
[57:33] as i close i want to refer back to
[57:35] brother landlands message wednesday
[57:37] night if you didn't hear it i encourage
[57:39] you
[57:41] about the priesthood about the maturity
[57:44] of the priesthood about the selflessness
[57:47] and the selfless lives of the priesthood
[57:48] see he referred back to the children of
[57:51] israel i thought of that when he
[57:53] preached wednesday night i wrote it in
[57:54] my notes i wrote several notes
[57:58] but
[57:59] did everybody ever think that why they
[58:00] were called the
[58:02] children of israel
[58:09] because they acted like children
[58:14] they only wanted to see the supernatural
[58:19] and if they didn't see it for a few days
[58:21] or a few services
[58:23] they got nervous
[58:25] is god among us or not
[58:29] if they didn't see somebody prophesy if
[58:31] they didn't see this and if they didn't
[58:33] see this happening
[58:34] is this okay we we need to work it out
[58:36] you don't need to work that out
[58:41] and
[58:42] god says in exodus 19 6 if you don't
[58:45] mind pulling the scripture up god says
[58:46] this at the very beginning before
[58:49] anything he says
[58:50] and ye he's speaking to all the children
[58:52] of israel and ye shall be exodus 19 6 ye
[58:56] shall be unto me a kingdom of priest
[59:00] a holy nation
[59:02] these are the words which thou shalt
[59:03] speak unto the children of the children
[59:06] of israel
[59:08] they may be the children of israel but
[59:10] in the mind of god
[59:12] ye shall be
[59:14] a kingdom
[59:15] of priest
[59:17] something needs to happen to change you
[59:19] for the title from the children of
[59:22] israel to the priest of israel
[59:25] and there's another scripture that says
[59:27] i wish
[59:28] moses said god wishes all of israel we
[59:31] talk about priests and prophets and
[59:32] positions he said i wish all of you were
[59:35] priests unto the lord
[59:38] in the opening of the seals he hath made
[59:41] us kings and priests
[59:44] brother landland was great in showing
[59:45] the maturity that come and i really
[59:47] believe that joshua and caleb
[59:51] had come to that faith and had come to
[59:53] that maturity to take the land that they
[59:55] had to be encouragers to other ones the
[59:57] other 10 spies that were saying we can't
[59:59] do it we can't go there you know this is
[1:00:02] too much the walls are too great that
[1:00:04] was immaturity that was saying i want i
[1:00:05] want to go back to the wilderness where
[1:00:07] i'm dependent on god and he has to
[1:00:10] provide my water when i get thirsty and
[1:00:11] my food when i get hungry and i need to
[1:00:13] see a miracle and i need this
[1:00:15] i'll keep serving the lord
[1:00:17] and if you don't show me a miracle i'm
[1:00:18] just going to go back to egypt
[1:00:22] children of israel
[1:00:24] but a priest does not say that
[1:00:27] a priest comes to church
[1:00:29] whether he would see the supernatural
[1:00:31] not he prays for it but he's going to
[1:00:33] serve the lord whether he sees it or not
[1:00:36] a priest in maturity says i got faith to
[1:00:38] take my land and if i don't get any help
[1:00:40] i got the lord's help he'll help me
[1:00:42] fight my battles
[1:00:44] a priest said
[1:00:46] two priests chase joshua caleb said
[1:00:48] we're more than able to take the land
[1:00:50] and they were helping encourage the
[1:00:52] children of israel to become priests of
[1:00:54] israel to not just be a survivor to
[1:00:57] become an overcomer can you say amen
[1:00:59] we're not called to be survivors we're
[1:01:02] called to be overcomers
[1:01:06] and i loved it because he said they when
[1:01:08] they go in the promised land it's a
[1:01:09] battle and he said this is not a picnic
[1:01:12] and brother bryan said this is not a
[1:01:13] picnic that you came into
[1:01:15] this is not an association this is not a
[1:01:18] membership that sam's wholesale
[1:01:23] you you smile at me laugh but people
[1:01:24] make their message church even a
[1:01:27] membership
[1:01:28] an affiliation i pay my tithes there and
[1:01:31] i'm affiliated with the message i have
[1:01:33] an affiliation with them but this is not
[1:01:35] an affiliation this is not a membership
[1:01:38] this is a battle
[1:01:40] and i loved it when brother landlad said
[1:01:42] when we recognize who our enemy is which
[1:01:44] is not one another by the way
[1:01:47] he says we may he says he when he was
[1:01:50] watching some soldiers one place he said
[1:01:52] they were fussing a little bit in the
[1:01:53] barracks and they might have
[1:01:55] misunderstandings but when they put
[1:01:57] their armor on and they stepped into
[1:02:00] their position as a soldier
[1:02:02] all those misunderstandings were laid
[1:02:04] aside because they stood shoulder to
[1:02:06] shoulder
[1:02:09] stand up
[1:02:10] they had a position and they stood
[1:02:12] shoulder to shoulder
[1:02:14] because why
[1:02:16] that's the enemy out there he's not the
[1:02:18] enemy
[1:02:19] and we got an enemy to fight and we're
[1:02:21] going to stand together to fight the
[1:02:23] enemy
[1:02:25] can you say man
[1:02:27] oneness
[1:02:28] they were together
[1:02:30] one mind
[1:02:31] and one accord nobody was acting
[1:02:33] isolated to themselves they say we're
[1:02:35] going to stand together we're going to
[1:02:37] take our land and i'm going to help you
[1:02:39] take your land too
[1:02:40] if i can help you in any way ye that are
[1:02:43] strong
[1:02:44] bear the infirm the weakness of the
[1:02:47] hallelujah
[1:02:49] bring up that quote about i'll close on
[1:02:51] that last quote that i got
[1:02:54] rebecca
[1:03:04] it's the next one i know yeah it's the
[1:03:05] one just before that
[1:03:09] it's the one
[1:03:10] just before that
[1:03:12] when you're playing a ball game
[1:03:15] as it's football season
[1:03:19] oh boy it's football season now
[1:03:24] i won't say anything but
[1:03:26] don't make it your god
[1:03:32] amen all right
[1:03:34] you know we're very open in this church
[1:03:36] we've actually allowed ohio state people
[1:03:39] to come to this church and i feel that's
[1:03:40] very
[1:03:42] gracious
[1:03:43] we led unvaccinated people here
[1:03:47] it's amazing we have a very open door
[1:03:49] here
[1:03:50] when you're playing a ball game as it's
[1:03:52] football season the thing we want to do
[1:03:54] is not everybody try to take the ball
[1:03:56] away from the man that's got it he's
[1:03:59] trying to guard that man
[1:04:01] protect him let him get through
[1:04:04] we're trying to make a goal
[1:04:08] and he said it wednesday night he says
[1:04:09] it's being a team player can you say
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] the holy ghost book of acts church was
[1:04:14] team players not acting in their own
[1:04:16] thing they had everything common
[1:04:17] together they stood in battle together
[1:04:20] can you say a man laying down your
[1:04:22] misunderstandings and in a football game
[1:04:24] we're trying to have the same goal and
[1:04:26] get to the goal however we get there
[1:04:28] we'll do everything but you don't take
[1:04:29] the ball away from the quarterback can
[1:04:30] you say amen next one but you could
[1:04:33] could you imagine a team so untrained as
[1:04:35] to find one man their own man with the
[1:04:36] ball running to the field goal and then
[1:04:38] instead of trying to knock the enemy
[1:04:40] away from him the opposing team to let
[1:04:42] your own man that's got the ball take
[1:04:44] off with it every man trying to take the
[1:04:46] ball out of his hand while you're bound
[1:04:48] to lose
[1:04:50] and today we have the same thing when we
[1:04:51] see god come on the scene and going to
[1:04:53] bless a certain thing let's keep all the
[1:04:56] enemies away from it let's say praise
[1:04:59] god god's blessing that and let's fight
[1:05:01] the enemies away from him let's use our
[1:05:03] influences as tackles not runners
[1:05:06] tackles that protect the runner
[1:05:10] let's him pack the ball through because
[1:05:12] there's no
[1:05:14] opposition all he has to do is just keep
[1:05:16] running and we
[1:05:18] should be
[1:05:19] tackles
[1:05:21] when you're setting up your fantasy
[1:05:22] football league
[1:05:25] in your mind for the body of christ
[1:05:28] you're going to say lord
[1:05:29] i'll be a tackle
[1:05:32] i want to be the quarterback
[1:05:35] trust me if the quarterback is the
[1:05:37] pastor you don't want to be the
[1:05:39] quarterback
[1:05:41] lord have mercy you don't even what what
[1:05:42] you're dreaming about
[1:05:44] you do not want to be the quarterback
[1:05:47] he's the guy he really gets beat up
[1:05:48] sometimes
[1:05:51] when you're making out your fantasy
[1:05:53] football team
[1:05:54] when you're making it make it out they
[1:05:56] say lord
[1:05:57] let me humbly find my place in the body
[1:05:59] of christ
[1:06:00] you had to choose let me choose a tackle
[1:06:03] let me choose a tight end
[1:06:05] let me choose the defense
[1:06:07] because those positions are just
[1:06:08] important to getting to the goal
[1:06:12] as any other
[1:06:13] do you believe that this morning
[1:06:16] you know we need a deeper love for one
[1:06:18] another
[1:06:21] we truly need
[1:06:24] this book of acts holy ghost working
[1:06:26] among us
[1:06:28] to have a capstone divine deeper love

[1:06:38] with the divine capstone love let me
[1:06:42] live by it let me function by it let me
[1:06:45] manifest it
[1:06:47] let me lay down any differences or
[1:06:50] anything that doesn't contribute
[1:06:53] to every believer reaching the goal
[1:06:57] let me raise you and say i want to be a
[1:06:59] book of acts church
[1:07:02] and i want to have the relationships
[1:07:03] that they had
