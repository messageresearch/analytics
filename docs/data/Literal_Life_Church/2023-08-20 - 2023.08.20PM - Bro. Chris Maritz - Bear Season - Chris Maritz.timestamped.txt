[1:26] to speak on the subject um a bear season
[1:29] bear season and there's uh that's not a
[1:31] teddy bear
[1:32] that is the grizzly bear and they have a
[1:35] really bad temper you do not want to
[1:37] mess with grizzly bears and uh but you
[1:40] know this is maybe what it's what it
[1:42] feels like maybe if we could if we could
[1:44] exchange the the bear we could put your
[1:46] school there maybe that's what school
[1:48] feels like for you you know we're going
[1:50] back to school and that's kind of how it
[1:52] feels you got this big bear sitting
[1:54] there and and it looks like this big
[1:56] enormous thing and you know we've had
[1:58] such a wonderful summer amen and we've
[2:00] have we hear the testimonies and we we
[2:03] hear what God has done and and uh and
[2:05] it's amazing and praise God and we're
[2:07] around around friends of like Precious
[2:09] faith and and this is a good feeling
[2:11] amen this is where we feel strong this
[2:13] is where we feel encouraged and so when
[2:16] we think of going back to school
[2:17] you know it's like um I'm gonna be alone
[2:21] I'm gonna be with friends again that
[2:23] don't believe the same way I believe and
[2:25] and maybe you you're dreading going back
[2:27] to school and and it's like this big
[2:29] bear just waiting you know
[2:31] but you don't have to be afraid amen
[2:34] it's bear season so we're just going to
[2:36] look at this a little bit adjustable
[2:38] encourages first Samuel 17 and 32
[2:42] the Bible tells us and David said to
[2:45] Saul let no man's heart fail because of
[2:47] him thy servant will go and fight with
[2:51] this philistine
[2:53] and Saul said to David Thou Art not able
[2:56] to go against this Philistine to fight
[2:57] with him for thou art but a youth
[3:00] how many is a youth here tonight
[3:04] and he a man of war from his youth
[3:08] and David said unto Saul thy servant
[3:10] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[3:12] lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[3:15] the flock and I went out after him and
[3:19] smote him and delivered it out of his
[3:21] mouth and when he arose against me I
[3:23] caught him by his beard and smote him
[3:26] and slew him
[3:28] and thy servant slew both The Lion and
[3:30] the bear and this uncircumcised
[3:32] Philistine shall be as one of them
[3:35] seeing Heath he hath defied the armies
[3:38] of the Living God
[3:41] David said moreover the Lord that
[3:43] delivered me out of the Paw of the lion
[3:45] and out of the Paw of the bear he will
[3:48] deliver me out of the hand of this
[3:49] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[3:52] and the Lord be with thee
[3:55] amen let's burn our heads One More Time
[3:57] Lord we just thank you for your word we
[4:00] see what you did for David just little
[4:02] David a Shepherd boy oh God but you
[4:04] called him for a great work and so we
[4:06] see how you moved upon his life and you
[4:09] took care of the needs that he had and
[4:11] the challenges he faced Lord we asked
[4:13] that you would just come tonight and
[4:14] Lord you see the youth that are here
[4:16] this evening may you meet the challenges
[4:19] that that they face so God we know you
[4:21] will meet them may you give us courage
[4:23] and Faith oh God as we step forward into
[4:25] the change of seasons Lord as we go into
[4:27] this fall season and we're going to
[4:29] school again Lord will you would
[4:30] encourage us through your word tonight
[4:31] Jesus Christ's name amen
[4:34] maybe seated so David had a had a great
[4:38] challenge it was a great boast that had
[4:39] been made and and David witnessed this
[4:42] this boast and even though David was a
[4:44] youth you know he wasn't trained in the
[4:46] in the Art of War and and maybe he was
[4:48] not a deacon in the church and maybe
[4:49] he's not a preacher or something like
[4:51] that just just a youth you know just one
[4:53] of the the local Youth and you know
[4:55] maybe just maybe he's afraid to speak
[4:57] out or maybe he's just a little guy you
[4:59] know he's the little guy behind the
[5:00] scenes and even his brothers were kind
[5:02] of like what are you doing here David
[5:03] you know you're just trying to get out
[5:05] of your chores and trying to get out of
[5:06] the work you're supposed to be doing and
[5:08] you know but he was about his father's
[5:09] business he was bringing them their food
[5:11] you know but here's David and he's just
[5:13] a he's just a youth we we say it so
[5:16] casually just the youth well I want to
[5:18] tell the youth tonight that you are you
[5:20] are greatly feared from your enemy
[5:22] because if you had to recognize who you
[5:24] are if you had to stand your ground and
[5:27] recognize who the enemy is and recognize
[5:29] what God has done for you amen the enemy
[5:32] would be shaking in his boots and so
[5:34] he's going to do everything in his power
[5:35] to keep you afraid to keep you subdued
[5:39] to keep you feeling like you've got
[5:40] nothing to offer that you're not strong
[5:42] enough that you don't have enough Faith
[5:44] but my brother and sister tonight I
[5:46] wanted to let you know he's afraid of
[5:47] you he is scared out of his mind of you
[5:50] you know back home we we are coming into
[5:53] hunting season and I don't know when the
[5:55] hunting seasons are like here but but
[5:57] back home coming into September it's
[5:59] hunting season so the brothers back home
[6:01] you know they they're they're um they're
[6:04] cleaning their rifles
[6:06] you know if those bears in our mountains
[6:08] there could see what our brothers are up
[6:09] to man they would be shaking in their
[6:11] boots right why because it's bear season
[6:14] and you know you have every right as a
[6:17] hunter when you go and buy your tag that
[6:19] tag has been paid for right it's you you
[6:22] had to exchange money for it it was a
[6:24] purchase made and so now you've paid for
[6:27] your tag now you've got a license to
[6:29] Kill Bear right you are fully qualified
[6:32] you don't have to worry you don't have
[6:33] to fear the law or anything like that
[6:35] you have been you have been put into
[6:37] into you've been engaged you've been
[6:40] you've been activated you are now a bear
[6:42] hunter and you've got every right to go
[6:44] hunting bear so what do you do you go
[6:46] home because of your anticipation of
[6:48] this you go and prepare for the hunt
[6:51] right so what do you do you go and find
[6:53] all the right bullets for the right for
[6:55] the right rifle maybe you have a a 30
[6:59] odd six and so you get your 30 odd six
[7:01] out and and you start you know shining
[7:03] the barrel up and you start making sure
[7:05] the Scopes mounted just ride and then
[7:07] you get all your bullets right you start
[7:09] loading in the the ammunition into your
[7:11] rifle you know you're you're checking
[7:13] all the magazines making sure
[7:14] everything's working making sure you've
[7:15] got the right caliber right and that's
[7:17] what we're doing here tonight we are
[7:18] loading our guns right we are sharpening
[7:21] our swords we are shining our Shields we
[7:24] are we are girding ourselves up for the
[7:25] battle that lays ahead but we don't have
[7:27] to be afraid for this battle that we are
[7:29] facing amen is bear season we're allowed
[7:32] to destroy the enemy
[7:35] we don't have to be afraid of the enemy
[7:36] and so that's what David you know as a
[7:39] youth he comes on the scene here and he
[7:41] realizes that there's fear this fear has
[7:43] gripped the army of Israel and he
[7:45] doesn't understand what this fear is
[7:47] because he has seen God work in his life
[7:49] now you got to remember David you know
[7:51] he was he was anointed to be a king and
[7:53] you might say well I wasn't anointed to
[7:55] be a king but the Bible does say that
[7:57] God has made us Kings and Priests okay
[7:59] so we have the same Authority in our
[8:02] kingdom so we each and every one of us
[8:04] has has a little kingdom that God has
[8:06] given us authority over so we have been
[8:08] made Kings and Priests over our our
[8:10] families or the situations or our
[8:12] friends or lives our little kingdoms
[8:14] that God has given us to govern over and
[8:17] so but God has called us and and he
[8:19] doesn't just call us and say well go do
[8:20] this and in and then hope for the best
[8:22] no he knows what's inside of you he
[8:25] knows what he's prepared to do for you
[8:26] also you've got all the Angels you've
[8:28] got the word you've got everything to
[8:30] back you in your journey but isn't that
[8:32] amazing how that God sends Samuel a
[8:35] prophet to go and identify the next king
[8:38] of Israel and so he sends a prophet with
[8:40] a word to come and identify this young
[8:42] man then he says God has chosen you to
[8:45] be the next king over Israel
[8:48] now I'm sure the little boy standing
[8:50] there would be like wow that's amazing
[8:52] that sounds like a lot of fun but you
[8:54] know what he had to wait
[8:55] there was a lot of training that had to
[8:58] happen before he could become king see
[9:01] God had to prepare this man for the work
[9:04] that he had allotted to him right so God
[9:06] prepares him and he and and isn't this
[9:09] amazing that as David goes through his
[9:10] life that that David has this experience
[9:13] where he kills the lion and a bear
[9:16] a lion and a bear as a youth and God Was
[9:20] preparing him so that when he came to
[9:22] this great moment in front of all Israel
[9:24] and there's this Philistine a giant
[9:27] how many is facing Giants right
[9:30] he had this giant he had to face it was
[9:33] it was it was an impossible thing you
[9:35] know this is a giant this is someone
[9:37] who's bigger he's stronger he has been
[9:39] trained from his youth he knows the Art
[9:42] of War he's skilled at it you know the
[9:44] Devil he's been at this business for a
[9:46] long time he knows how to set traps he
[9:48] knows how to scheme and plan and lie and
[9:51] manipulate he knows how to do all that
[9:52] stuff right so what are we going to do
[9:54] as a youth well we've just seen what God
[9:57] has done for us in our walk with the
[9:59] Lord amen so God gives us experiences so
[10:02] that we can have confidence in the Lord
[10:03] when we Face our Giants but see we have
[10:06] to we have to be willing to go after
[10:08] that bear and the lion in our life
[10:12] thy servant is if I just go back maybe
[10:15] one
[10:15] thy servant kept his father's sheep and
[10:18] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[10:20] lamb out of the flock and I went after
[10:22] him and smote him most of us I think
[10:23] would run the other direction
[10:25] right but there was something in David
[10:27] see God put something in us we don't
[10:29] understand it but we we see a need we
[10:32] see somebody who's crying out and we
[10:34] start praying and we get behind that
[10:36] cause or we read our Bible and we find a
[10:39] scripture to fortify someone you know
[10:41] there's something inside of us that that
[10:42] wants to defy the works of the enemy we
[10:45] want to fight against that that's just
[10:47] it's a it's a nature of a Christian to
[10:50] fight against the works of the devil to
[10:52] stand against wrong amen and so this
[10:55] this little youth he goes after him and
[10:57] he smites him and delivered it out of
[10:58] his mouth and when he rose against him I
[11:00] caught him by his beard and smote him
[11:02] and slew him and my servants slew both
[11:04] The Lion and the bear now I've seen
[11:06] Lions face to face okay we have there's
[11:09] a lion in South Africa brother Brian
[11:12] Jones's Farm and and his name is big boy
[11:15] and that's the reason they call him big
[11:16] boys he's really big and this Lion Man
[11:19] you come walking up to the cage that
[11:21] he's in and he gets up on that cage and
[11:23] he gets his big claws up on the fence
[11:25] like that and he does that big low
[11:28] guttural kind of growl man
[11:31] you feel really little and then you
[11:33] think of David grabbing him by his beard
[11:38] you see we don't we don't
[11:40] we underestimate the power that is
[11:43] inside of us we underestimate the god
[11:47] that we serve
[11:48] and he's with us everywhere we go you
[11:51] know we underestimate you know these
[11:52] things The Lion and the bear can seem so
[11:55] big
[11:56] so overwhelming right so insurmountable
[12:01] but it's it's just not the case for the
[12:03] believer
[12:04] because God is with you
[12:07] so the bear is a type of the enemy
[12:09] you'll find this throughout the
[12:11] scriptures we normally associate a lion
[12:13] as a good type in scripture but remember
[12:15] Satan copies God and so Satan is also
[12:18] typed as a lion he goes around as the
[12:20] Bible tells us as a roaring lion be
[12:22] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[12:25] the devil uh adversary the devil as a
[12:28] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[12:30] he may devour our enemy is a roaring
[12:33] lion he's always got something to say
[12:35] he's always making a lot of noise always
[12:37] making a big boost just like this
[12:39] Philistine was making a big boast
[12:42] so The Lion and the Bear in scripture is
[12:44] typed as animals or beasts that destroy
[12:46] men
[12:47] we know that they are used many times to
[12:50] type the powers that are used by Satan
[12:52] like in we find in Daniel 7 and in
[12:54] Revelation 13 I've got a scripture here
[12:56] from Revelation 13 2 and it says and the
[12:59] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[13:01] leopard and his feet whereas the feet of
[13:04] a bear see it uses the the analogy of a
[13:07] bear the metaphor and he's his mouth as
[13:09] the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave
[13:12] him his power and his seat and great
[13:14] Authority so we see how that even the
[13:16] Bible will use lions and bears to show
[13:18] the great power or the great strength of
[13:21] the enemy right the Beast made up of all
[13:23] the powers into one form so if it wasn't
[13:26] bad enough that it was just a bear or
[13:29] just a lion hear this Beast system right
[13:31] which we face every day which you're
[13:33] going to face in your schools right that
[13:35] thing has become one one creature and it
[13:37] is God a lion and a bear mixed in there
[13:41] this Beast would be a composite of all
[13:43] the powers in Daniel they represent the
[13:45] Gentile kingdoms and the the medes and
[13:48] Persians and and the Greeks and
[13:49] Babylonians right all coming into one
[13:52] image right and here we see that this is
[13:55] the thing that we face in our lives in
[13:57] our walk as Believers is the system but
[14:00] it's it's comprised of these different
[14:02] animals right different characteristics
[14:05] different powers and it looks a certain
[14:08] way like a lion and a bear
[14:10] you will find many times in the Bible
[14:11] that The Lion and the bear being used
[14:13] together you know as of one like if as
[14:16] if one isn't bad enough
[14:18] Lamentations 3 10 says he was unto me as
[14:21] a bear lying in weight as a lion in
[14:24] secret places
[14:26] showing that the devil sets a snare he
[14:29] sets a trap for the believer my dad was
[14:32] telling a story when they were walking
[14:33] through the Wilderness in South Africa
[14:35] and and here they are and they and and
[14:37] they're just on foot walking through the
[14:38] bushfelt and my dad said he saw a lion
[14:41] on their on their right hand side a
[14:43] lioness and my dad goes over to Brother
[14:45] Brian he says hey there's a lioness over
[14:46] here you know I mean these are real
[14:48] lions okay this is not a zoo or
[14:49] something you know so this lioness is is
[14:52] is just walking off to the distance here
[14:54] and he says yeah yeah I know and so as
[14:56] they're walking they see another lioness
[14:58] on the left so he tells brother Brian
[15:00] hey brother Brian there's the Lioness on
[15:01] the left-hand side now he says yeah I
[15:03] know and so he noticed brother Brian is
[15:06] getting nervous also and he's watching
[15:07] this and he says he says if you haven't
[15:09] noticed there's lionesses behind us also
[15:11] right so they're forming this this like
[15:14] a shoehorn right the lionesses are smart
[15:17] you know they're hunters and they and
[15:19] they know how to scheme and and set
[15:21] snares and traps and and if you're not
[15:24] watching for those things before you
[15:25] know it you've walked into this big trap
[15:27] right so God's given us eyes to see so
[15:30] we can recognize the dangers around us
[15:32] so when you're in school and and a
[15:34] friend asks you over to some place or
[15:36] you or you're supposed to go to do
[15:37] something you know don't get caught in
[15:39] the Trap somewhere right have your eyes
[15:40] wide open and be aware of the of the
[15:43] lionesses around you right and so you'll
[15:46] see how how they were walking like this
[15:48] and and and and my dad said they were
[15:49] just walking a little way and this Brian
[15:51] turns around he says he says what you
[15:53] don't know is that there's some
[15:54] lionesses waiting up ahead as well right
[15:57] so we're boxed in so he says because
[15:59] that is their Instinct that's how these
[16:01] animals work they know how to
[16:02] communicate to each other and form a box
[16:04] like this and then push you into into an
[16:07] ambush like that he says what we've got
[16:08] to do is break their Instinct see they
[16:10] think they're in control and they think
[16:12] that we are going to based on our
[16:14] Instinct we are going to run at the
[16:16] first sign of trouble that's exactly
[16:18] what the Lioness wants you to do is run
[16:20] right because when you run you isolate
[16:22] yourself from the group and then and
[16:24] then you're an easy target for the
[16:26] lioness right and so he was saying you
[16:28] know we're going to we need to break
[16:30] that we need to break this this mode
[16:32] they're in hunting mode they're in
[16:34] they're in in kill mode you know they're
[16:36] they're all fixated on this one plan he
[16:38] says we need to show them there's a
[16:40] higher plan there's a different plan at
[16:42] work there's another Instinct working
[16:44] together we got to stay together he says
[16:46] get all the coffee coffee mugs together
[16:48] and get all the pillows together and
[16:50] we'll just pick a side
[16:51] and let's start pushing through this way
[16:53] right we don't want to get to the end we
[16:55] want to we want to break out of this
[16:56] thing right now and so they what did
[16:58] they do they they took all these these
[17:00] coffee mugs and they they picked what
[17:02] they thought was the weaker side and
[17:03] they went after this lioness on this
[17:04] side and just started throwing coffee
[17:06] mugs at it and and pillows and all kinds
[17:08] of things this lioness now it doesn't
[17:11] have a clue what's going on this is
[17:12] different I've never been treated like
[17:14] this no one's ever stood up to me like
[17:16] this before right this is unusual why
[17:19] aren't they running why aren't they
[17:21] afraid hallelujah amen why are they
[17:24] scared of their minds you know we we do
[17:26] this with the Impalas and we do this
[17:28] with the other animals and man they just
[17:29] we just scare them practically to death
[17:31] you just give a little Roar and the
[17:33] animal almost faints you know from from
[17:35] Fear right you know the Devil comes and
[17:38] it gives a little Roar and everybody
[17:39] shotters and we're not Mage like that my
[17:42] brother and sister we've been made more
[17:43] than Overcomers it's bear season amen so
[17:46] so it's time to break out if you see
[17:49] that you're you're in a trap or
[17:50] something like that just break out and
[17:52] the enemy doesn't know what to do with
[17:53] you just like that that poor stain huh
[17:58] Goliath when he was standing there he
[17:59] didn't know what to do with this little
[18:01] boy
[18:02] who Do You Think You Are
[18:05] huh I'm a Son of God and you're defying
[18:08] the armies of the Living God you've come
[18:10] against my God you've come on my turf
[18:13] you've come on on my grounds this is my
[18:15] ground this is my family this is my
[18:17] school this is my education right claim
[18:20] your ground my brother and sister you
[18:22] know we were we were just before we came
[18:24] here at some friends over from New
[18:26] Zealand
[18:28] and uh he wanted to go on a little day
[18:30] trip and so we we you know we wanted to
[18:32] go see some sightseeing so I took him to
[18:34] Hell's Gate
[18:36] I know that sounds really weird having a
[18:39] pastor take another young man to Hell's
[18:41] Gate now it's not literally Hell's Gate
[18:43] obviously right I know it sounds funny
[18:45] but it's just a location called Hell's
[18:48] Gate okay so they called it housegate
[18:50] because of how dangerous it is in this
[18:54] location it's a big canyon there between
[18:56] the in the big mountains there in
[18:58] British Columbia and in this massive
[19:01] Canyon there's this kind of like a pinch
[19:03] point where the water's really uh
[19:05] increase in speed and in turbulence and
[19:07] in current and so this little Point here
[19:10] it became impassable for the people that
[19:12] were navigating this and trading and you
[19:15] know and so forth and so this became a
[19:17] very dangerous area it became dangerous
[19:19] even for the for the animals and for
[19:22] salmon and so forth you know it's just
[19:24] because of its strong currents and and
[19:26] the fact that people can't even get
[19:28] through there with a little boat so it's
[19:29] called House gate for this reason it is
[19:31] a dangerous location right and here I
[19:35] thought it was so funny here we are
[19:37] visiting Hell's Gate you know we have
[19:38] complete Authority there we we bought
[19:41] our ticket we went down for it's the
[19:43] first time I went down with a gondola
[19:45] you know it's kind of a weird sensation
[19:47] normally you're going up the mountain
[19:48] with a gondola right but here we're
[19:49] going down into this Canyon into house
[19:52] gate
[19:53] and it's a it's an interesting kind of
[19:55] feeling you know this is Hal's gay but
[19:57] I'm not afraid
[19:58] I can walk all over the place here we
[20:01] are possessing the gates of our enemies
[20:03] right so we we just we just had complete
[20:06] Authority we didn't have to worry about
[20:07] anything we could stand right there we
[20:09] we noticed the dangers we saw those
[20:11] things but they made a bridge to get
[20:13] over the danger
[20:15] God bridged a gap for us right so we
[20:18] don't have to fear those things and even
[20:19] though there's great danger and there's
[20:21] great trap set and there's great great
[20:23] obstacles that need to be overcome God
[20:26] has made us more than Overcomers greater
[20:28] is he that is in us than he that is in
[20:30] the world you know there's such an
[20:32] amazing thing that I I saw there with
[20:35] the salmon everybody here knows what
[20:36] salmon is and and they it's a fish by
[20:39] the way right so they said just make
[20:41] sure everyone's awake so the salmon you
[20:43] know they they're out there in the vast
[20:45] ocean you know we can call that their
[20:47] summer right in the summertime they're
[20:49] just out there in the big Ocean and the
[20:51] salt water they've got all this room to
[20:53] move and and feel free and and feel
[20:55] relaxed and eat all that they can
[20:57] possibly eat and they feel really good
[20:59] but then there comes a season there
[21:00] comes a time when when something starts
[21:03] to pull something starts to call they
[21:05] were made for a reason my brother and
[21:07] sister they there's something on the
[21:09] inside that that there's a purpose
[21:11] there's an instinct that has to be
[21:13] manifested in in their lives and and
[21:15] even though there's great dangers that
[21:17] are ahead it doesn't matter that that
[21:19] manifestation that purpose has to be
[21:21] accomplished otherwise there will be
[21:24] just it'll they'll just die right so
[21:26] these these salmon they have to swim up
[21:28] these currents so they'll find you know
[21:31] here they are in salt water and and
[21:32] they'll find these little rivers that go
[21:34] up into the mainland in British Columbia
[21:36] especially the Fraser River but you know
[21:39] it's like think of the mentality here
[21:41] out there in the ocean there's no
[21:43] current there's there's really nothing
[21:45] to to Really worry about in that sense
[21:47] you know you've got all the space you
[21:49] need and you can swim to your heart's
[21:51] content and you're happy and there's
[21:53] lots of food now you're going to make a
[21:54] decision to go swim up some current some
[21:57] River that is fraught with Danger
[22:00] where there's Bears right
[22:03] where there's humans fishermen
[22:06] and to boot it's
[22:08] up River
[22:10] I've I've been in that Fraser River that
[22:12] current in that Fraser River is
[22:14] incredibly strong why would something
[22:17] make a decision to go swim upstream
[22:20] against all the current you know I I was
[22:23] gonna have I'm not going to do it we
[22:25] just don't have time tonight but you
[22:26] have a brother standing over here and we
[22:28] put like I don't know 10 Brothers over
[22:30] here and we have these brothers Walk
[22:31] This Way and this brother's got to walk
[22:33] this way through them right it's
[22:35] uncomfortable it's uneasy you're going
[22:38] against the flow it's not normal
[22:41] right just you know this world wants us
[22:43] to go with the current just go with the
[22:46] current you know just accept everything
[22:47] and just just be just be tolerant and
[22:50] just be this and just be that and and
[22:52] this is the way the world is and just
[22:54] accept it and and be tolerant of all
[22:56] those things you know you can fill in
[22:58] the gaps tonight but you know we're not
[23:00] made that way my brother and sister we
[23:02] were made to swim against the current
[23:03] not to be different and not to be
[23:06] awkward but there's a purpose there's a
[23:08] reason there's a new birth that's
[23:09] waiting for us at the end of of the of
[23:12] the Stream
[23:14] you know they called out for the salmon
[23:16] they call that homecoming season
[23:19] that's when when the salmon decides I'm
[23:22] going north I'm I'm done swimming around
[23:24] in this big ocean it's nice but but I
[23:27] want to fulfill my purpose I've got
[23:29] enemies to conquer I've got things to do
[23:31] for the Lord and for his Kingdom's sake
[23:33] to preach the gospel to lay hands on the
[23:35] sick and they shall recover and and and
[23:37] to believe and to have faith and pray
[23:40] and all those things and that includes
[23:42] all of us we all have that Ministry amen
[23:44] we all are are pulling them out of the
[23:47] fire so to speak and and so there comes
[23:49] a time when we realize it's time for me
[23:51] to swim against the current it's time
[23:53] for me to become who I was called to be
[23:56] I've been raised for such a time as this
[23:58] we don't have to be afraid don't worry
[24:00] you know if you had to start thinking
[24:02] about man I know around that certain
[24:04] band there's this great big grizzly bear
[24:06] and he gets a lot of them you know he
[24:07] gets over into that Creek and he just
[24:09] gives a big SWAT like that and he knocks
[24:12] all those salmon out of the creek and
[24:13] and then he eats them alive you know and
[24:15] you could start you know creating these
[24:18] stories in your mind your imagine nation
[24:20] and he can really scare yourself you
[24:23] know this is going to be hard this is
[24:24] going to be tough and my brother and
[24:26] sister we've been made to do this this
[24:28] is inside of us and you will never be
[24:31] happy you will never reproduce you will
[24:34] never have a new birth or a new life
[24:36] until you've gone through those
[24:37] experiences and you've conquered the
[24:40] bear and the lion in your life face your
[24:42] Giants don't be afraid of them just like
[24:44] Joshua and Caleb but you know when they
[24:46] when they heard the reports and they
[24:48] were in the minority don't be don't be
[24:50] surprised when you're in the minority
[24:51] regarding these things but you know he
[24:54] recognized that is my land that's where
[24:56] I belong that's my home that's my
[24:58] territory and I want to gain my land
[25:00] back and so what did they do they put
[25:02] the word first and they go and fight the
[25:05] Giants Drive the Giants off your land
[25:08] see it's one thing to be afraid of the
[25:10] Giants it's another thing to recognize
[25:11] Who You Are
[25:13] you are more than a match for the bear
[25:15] you're more than a match for for your
[25:17] Giants amen
[25:19] so we see this little salmon they start
[25:20] to swim upstream it's it's it's an
[25:22] incredible thing to witness
[25:25] they've got all the food and all that
[25:27] nutrition and everything they have need
[25:29] of already inside of them and then they
[25:32] start swimming Upstream this is like
[25:33] going to school now
[25:35] it's literally when you go to school you
[25:37] are going the opposite direction that
[25:39] everybody else is going spiritually
[25:40] speaking right
[25:42] and so you go to school and and you go
[25:44] up the stream and and you'll notice how
[25:46] that some of these areas it looks
[25:49] impossible how does a fish how does a
[25:51] salmon about that big you know get
[25:53] through some of these areas
[25:56] it looks so impossible unreasonable or
[26:00] unfair but yet they salmon make it every
[26:03] year there's salmon going up that River
[26:06] it's an incredible thing what a
[26:09] testimony if a fish can do that with a
[26:11] Basic Instincts that he has what can a
[26:13] son and daughter of God do
[26:15] but you know some of these areas you get
[26:16] into some of the these these Waters
[26:19] right and you can imagine what I'm
[26:21] talking about but you get into some of
[26:22] these Waters where it gets really
[26:23] shallow
[26:24] right and and you start to find that
[26:26] there's less and less water to swim in
[26:28] you know maybe you come around the
[26:30] corner and and and and this in the trial
[26:33] has been set for you you know this has
[26:34] been all planned out by the devil you
[26:36] know he's got just the right trap just
[26:38] the right thing and before you know it
[26:39] you find yourself in really shallow
[26:41] water and it's really hard to get
[26:42] swimming and get some momentum and get
[26:45] moving but you can't go back
[26:47] because if you're going back or if you
[26:49] stop the prophet tells if you stop
[26:51] you're backsliding
[26:53] so if you stop swimming what happens
[26:56] you're backsliding you're losing ground
[26:59] you're giving ground back to the enemy
[27:00] don't stop swimming don't ever stop
[27:02] swimming you'll make it through it might
[27:04] take a little longer to get through the
[27:06] shallow areas and it might be a little
[27:08] rougher and you might bump up against
[27:09] some rocks and get a little scrape here
[27:11] you'll scrape there but you'll make it
[27:13] through you're made for that that's what
[27:15] that salmon is made for it has just the
[27:18] right characteristics to get through
[27:20] those little shallow Waters and if you
[27:22] ever watch it man it's incredible they
[27:23] just kind of bounce around and flip-flop
[27:26] this way and I know it looks ridiculous
[27:28] sometimes our lives look ridiculous huh
[27:30] and we kind of flip this way and flop
[27:33] that way and you know we're just we're
[27:34] just trying to get Upstream we're trying
[27:36] to get home right and so we do
[27:37] everything we can to make it home
[27:41] we take we dig deep
[27:43] for that strength to take us home you
[27:46] know and these little salmon they just
[27:48] they just have an amazing ability but
[27:50] you know God has has these little safe
[27:52] havens also in the in the river as
[27:54] they're going Upstream
[27:56] you'll find that there there'll be
[27:58] little pockets so you know all the
[27:59] salmon will converge and come around a
[28:01] Bend or something and then there'll be a
[28:03] big rock and there'll be just this
[28:04] little area where there's no current
[28:06] you know and you'll see the salmon will
[28:08] make their way into this little this
[28:10] little pocket of water and and they'll
[28:12] just rest there for a little while
[28:13] they're just getting ready right and
[28:15] then another salmon will come in there
[28:16] and says how are you doing praise God
[28:17] we're gonna we're gonna keep pressing
[28:19] the battle I had such a good year at
[28:20] camp and and God did something for me
[28:22] and I and I've put it under the blood
[28:24] and I've been healed and this and that
[28:26] and you're just talking what are you
[28:27] doing you're you're strengthening one
[28:28] another because you're gonna you have to
[28:30] keep going you can't stop there's as
[28:32] nice as this is as nice as an evening
[28:34] like this is where we can sing and
[28:36] praise my brother and sister we can't
[28:37] stop here we weren't made to just stay
[28:39] here we were made to go worship Him in
[28:41] school we're made to worship him in our
[28:43] places of work and be a testimony and be
[28:46] a bright and a Shining Light and a dark
[28:48] crazy world
[28:50] so it's nice these little little safe
[28:53] havens God gives us
[28:55] we appreciate them and we encourage one
[28:57] another maybe you'll see someone come in
[28:59] and oh man he got really hit hard by
[29:01] that last Rock back there and you know
[29:03] and so you just kind of get up close to
[29:05] him and say Hey brother I'm praying for
[29:06] you you know I noticed you got you got
[29:08] hit really hard with that last one but
[29:10] you're still swimming praise God you're
[29:12] still swimming you're you're gonna make
[29:14] it
[29:15] right because we've already we are we've
[29:18] been made more than Overcomers
[29:20] and we don't have to be afraid you're
[29:22] going to make it this is what we do one
[29:24] for another we gird each other up lift
[29:26] up the feeble among you right pray one
[29:29] for another and I think that's so
[29:30] admirable and such a good idea brother
[29:32] Paul to to pray for the Youth is to go
[29:35] to go to school this year amen why we
[29:37] we're in that little puddle of water
[29:40] there we're in that little moment where
[29:41] we have a little rest a little time to
[29:43] strengthen one another
[29:45] but you can't stay there we've got to
[29:47] we've got to decide okay you take a deep
[29:50] breath I'm gonna do this Lord I'm
[29:52] putting my life in your hands I'm
[29:54] trusting in you right greater is he that
[29:57] is in me than he that is in the world I
[29:58] don't know what's around this next Rock
[30:00] I don't know what's around this next
[30:02] Bend I don't know there's maybe a
[30:04] grizzly bear or maybe there's maybe
[30:06] there's a fisherman and he said a trap
[30:07] or a net there's something there oh God
[30:10] but but I can't give up now
[30:12] I can't give up now I don't know what
[30:14] this is inside of me I don't know why
[30:16] I'm why what would make me go against
[30:19] the flow like this what makes me like
[30:21] this my brother and sister God puts
[30:22] something inside of each and every one
[30:24] of us we will never be happy until we
[30:27] have that full New Birth
[30:30] have that experience with the Lord
[30:32] keep swimming
[30:35] anyway these little fish oh it's not in
[30:37] my notes I don't know why I'm going in
[30:38] this direction
[30:39] by these little fish you know they they
[30:41] start to get upstream and they get to
[30:43] Hell's Gate
[30:45] Hell's Gate takes a lot of the salmon
[30:47] out
[30:49] a lot of them fall by the wayside there
[30:51] because the current is just too strong
[30:56] but you know maybe they would have a
[30:58] little conversation amongst themselves
[30:59] and say this is coming up Hell's Gate is
[31:01] coming up but we have a scripture that
[31:03] we shall possess the gates of his
[31:05] enemies
[31:06] and I want to I want to say to you youth
[31:08] remember when you're talking about Siege
[31:10] and you're talking about someone
[31:12] someone's Gates Right who is the
[31:15] defender and who is the aggressor right
[31:18] the one with the gates is the one trying
[31:19] to defend himself he's the one that's
[31:21] boxed in okay and the other one is the
[31:24] one who's the aggressor he's the one
[31:26] who's the one who is sieging besieging
[31:28] the city right so when we say we are we
[31:31] we are possessing the gates of our enemy
[31:33] I mean he's the one who's trying to
[31:34] defend himself he's the one who's
[31:36] cowering behind a little wall right he's
[31:38] the one with the gates not you you're
[31:40] the one who's free you're the one who
[31:42] has the siege weapons you're the one who
[31:44] is free to roam and to move and and and
[31:46] to muster food and all these kinds of
[31:49] things the enemy is the one who's
[31:50] running out of time
[31:52] right you ever seen a Siege before
[31:54] right so we we get to this place at
[31:56] Hell's Gate
[31:58] and these little salmon they just it's
[32:00] quite a remarkable Story how that how
[32:02] that someone had to intervene on their
[32:06] behalf to ensure that they would survive
[32:10] so so God allowed it you know in his
[32:13] great plant for a man to come down
[32:15] right
[32:17] and to build a bridge to build a system
[32:21] for those little salmon
[32:23] it's a little way around
[32:26] Hell's Gate and so if you look down into
[32:28] Hell's Gate there you'll see these big
[32:30] concrete structures okay at first I
[32:33] thought they were for Gates and for for
[32:35] damning up the water maybe you know in
[32:37] case there's flooding or something like
[32:38] that but that's not what it's for it's
[32:40] for the fish
[32:42] this massive like I can't imagine the
[32:45] the the the feat it would be to build
[32:47] these massive concrete structures in
[32:50] Hell's Gate like that in a place that is
[32:53] where where no human being should be you
[32:55] know it is a very dangerous place and
[32:57] yet somehow somebody made a way
[33:00] Somebody went down there and engineer he
[33:03] saw the need of those fish and he knew
[33:05] this was this this little spot here is a
[33:08] bad spot this little spot here it gets a
[33:10] lot of fish so I'm gonna build something
[33:14] oh my is the Waymaker amen his name is
[33:18] power amen just like we sang that song
[33:20] and so what do they do they they built
[33:22] this little Weir system so that the fish
[33:24] will still have to swim
[33:26] he's not he's not taking the fish out of
[33:29] the water and and you know and and and
[33:31] taking all your trials away and taking
[33:33] all of your struggles away that's not
[33:35] what he's doing right but he makes a way
[33:37] for you to go around the death trap
[33:41] that's what our Lord does for us amen
[33:43] just like he will do for you at school
[33:45] God makes a way for you everything
[33:47] you're going to face at school you are
[33:49] going to be stronger you're going to be
[33:51] more than capable to handle the
[33:52] situation there's no trial that God
[33:54] allows to come by your way that you are
[33:57] not capable of handling
[33:59] right
[34:00] and God makes a way of Escape every
[34:03] single time
[34:05] we just have to recognize that right so
[34:07] this little salmon come up there and
[34:08] they find those little side walls and
[34:10] they go around right and then they go
[34:12] all the way
[34:16] they go all the way around right
[34:19] and they find
[34:21] that little Homeland you know what
[34:23] happens to that salmon they actually go
[34:24] through a physical change when before
[34:27] they get to their place of birth a
[34:29] physical change they actually become red
[34:31] all over
[34:33] totally red you know that really spoke
[34:35] to me covered the blood of Jesus Christ
[34:37] right when they get there they are
[34:40] totally red their whole body has changed
[34:43] they they get this hump on their back
[34:45] like this and their whole form has
[34:47] changed I think of Jacob when he met the
[34:49] Lord right his his walk changed right he
[34:52] they noticed when they looked at Jacob
[34:54] from that day on they knew he was a
[34:55] prince with God
[34:57] amen
[34:58] praise the Lord all right well I'm not
[35:00] gonna
[35:01] I'm not going to finish my sermon
[35:03] tonight I just I don't know why we went
[35:05] that direction but but you are salmon
[35:07] okay
[35:09] you are the salmon we are we are we are
[35:11] swimming Upstream but we don't have to
[35:13] be afraid we don't have to worry about
[35:15] the The Lion and the bear and if I can
[35:17] just close maybe with this
[35:19] you know the prophet talks about Bear
[35:21] Country
[35:22] and he says how that even there's a
[35:24] there's a forest you know and he says
[35:27] even the the trees you know they sway a
[35:30] certain way and and it's even the trees
[35:31] that area is called the the place of the
[35:33] Giants and he says those trees move a
[35:36] certain way and it's kind of an eerie
[35:37] place you know it's just a a just an
[35:40] eerie place right and he's a hunter and
[35:43] so he knows you know he was called to go
[35:44] and hunt this bear and and he and it's
[35:47] amazing that brother Brandon when he's
[35:48] called to go hunt that bear and take
[35:50] care of that that issue that was in the
[35:51] woods there remember when he's when he's
[35:54] doing that he comes across a lion a
[35:57] bobcat a mountain lion right that's what
[36:00] he comes across first and so he sees
[36:02] this mountain lion and then he and then
[36:05] he goes after the bear it's amazing just
[36:06] how God allowed that in his life when he
[36:08] goes to destroy this bear and even
[36:10] there's this man that comes to him and
[36:12] he starts kind of making fun of him and
[36:14] says negative things to brother Branham
[36:16] not realizing brother brother Branham is
[36:18] therefore his as a courtesy to him
[36:21] right see sometimes we we don't realize
[36:24] what God has done for us in our day God
[36:27] sent us a hunter right a Woodsman
[36:29] somebody understands the woods somebody
[36:31] who is a ranger right and he knows the
[36:34] the the quirks and the the snares and
[36:37] the little characteristics of the bear
[36:39] and those things he can read the signs
[36:41] right he's got eyes to see all those
[36:42] things God sent us somebody as a
[36:45] courtesy to take care of the Bear in our
[36:48] life and how did he do that he gave us
[36:50] the ammunition he gave us the word that
[36:52] is how we overcome we overcome with the
[36:55] word amen let's Stand Together
[37:03] the prophet says that won't stop David
[37:05] he'll go right on out there after that
[37:07] fellow with a little slingshot
[37:09] you might say brother Chris I don't even
[37:10] have a slingshot that's okay because he
[37:13] can make something out of nothing
[37:15] with a little slingshot of ask anything
[37:17] in my name and it shall be given I don't
[37:20] care the doctors can laugh everybody
[37:22] else can make fun of him he'll go after
[37:25] him anyhow bringing that sheep back to
[37:27] the fold yes sir is God's child take
[37:30] your hand off of him knock this line
[37:32] down then the line rose up he grabbed
[37:34] him by the beard and killed him
[37:37] excuse me a little bitty Ruddy boy
[37:39] probably weigh 80 or 90 pounds
[37:43] right
[37:44] I don't know just how you feel and
[37:47] what's going on in your hearts or maybe
[37:49] if you have something that's nagging at
[37:52] you or you've got a fear of going back
[37:54] to school or work or you know just maybe
[37:56] sad that you know this beautiful summer
[37:58] has ended but my brother and sister
[38:00] don't forget this summer was here to
[38:02] give us strength for the journey that
[38:04] we're about to face and I personally am
[38:07] a little more excited about what's ahead
[38:09] than what is behind us
[38:12] because we have been raised for such a
[38:14] time as this God has God's word will
[38:17] meet every condition
[38:19] God's word will meet every condition
[38:21] there's nothing that you're going to
[38:22] face in school this year that his word
[38:24] cannot take care of
[38:25] his holy spirit cannot lead you through
[38:27] we have been made more than Overcomers
[38:30] amen praise the Lord Brother Paul
[38:33] amen
