[0:00] finishing up tonight
[0:02] brother paul are you going to be
[0:04] finishing tonight the jonah series
[0:06] tonight are you going to be finishing it
[0:09] well
[0:09] you know what i'll do my best to finish
[0:12] it just for you how about that
[0:14] matthew chapter nine
[0:16] we're going to read here in verse
[0:18] starting at verse 35
[0:21] and just remembering in prayer i don't i
[0:24] couldn't hear all the prayer requests
[0:25] but
[0:26] remembering brother rowell our friend
[0:28] here at the church in philippines and
[0:29] his wife and he has covered now so let's
[0:32] just remember him we're thankful for
[0:34] brother jim babb coming out of it and
[0:36] many others that we prayed and we're
[0:38] very thankful to the lord tonight his
[0:40] healing touch but we want to remember
[0:42] brother rowell's a
[0:43] just a servant here with the church and
[0:45] been here many times so let's remember
[0:47] him he's deep in my heart tonight and
[0:49] also the pruitt family who lost their
[0:52] mom and brother pruitt's wife last week
[0:53] and we just pray that god will be with
[0:56] him in these days of loneliness and
[0:57] these days of missing her it's a huge
[1:00] vacuum i'm sure and i just pray that god
[1:03] will comfort their hearts and just be
[1:05] with the pruitt family and the church
[1:07] there
[1:08] amen matthew chapter 9 and verse 35
[1:12] jesus went about all the cities and
[1:14] villages teaching in the synagogues and
[1:17] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:19] healing every sickness and every disease
[1:22] among the people but when he saw the
[1:25] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[1:29] on them because they fainted and were
[1:32] scattered abroad as sheep having no
[1:35] shepherd notice here jesus has
[1:37] compassion on the sheep that were
[1:39] scattered and also they had no
[1:41] leadership another and when you don't
[1:43] have a shepherd or you don't have the
[1:44] right kind of leadership you tend to
[1:46] follow the wrong type of leadership when
[1:48] you don't have the right shepherd then
[1:50] you tend to be overly influenced by
[1:52] other ones and when jesus seen that in
[1:54] these sheep his heart was moved his
[1:56] compassion he was moved with compassion
[1:59] for them verse 37 then saith he unto his
[2:01] disciples the harvest truly is plenteous
[2:04] but the laborers are few pray either for
[2:07] the lord of the harvest that he will
[2:10] send forth laborers
[2:12] into his harvest and i might add in back
[2:14] in the book of jonah the last
[2:17] scripture of the last chapter in the
[2:19] last scripture of jonah tonight

[2:38] nineveh that great city with six
[2:41] thousand six excuse me more than six

[4:07] please just work with me here uh but
[4:10] i've covered this whole jonah thing and

[4:26] preached what i preached and i'll finish
[4:27] tonight but this might be on a different
[4:30] level maybe for the children and i
[4:32] thought you would enjoy seeing this this
[4:34] evening so bear with me here in my folly
[4:37] if you would
[4:39] and you've probably seen this before but
[4:41] i thought this was pretty cute brother
[4:43] kyle if you want to pull that up
[4:47] the story of jonah
[4:50] long long ago there was a man named
[4:53] jonah who lived a good life and always
[4:56] obeyed god's laws he thought of himself
[4:59] as a true man of god
[5:02] joan was a hard worker
[5:04] through his labels he was able to buy
[5:06] chickens
[5:08] and a donkey
[5:09] and a goat
[5:11] one day
[5:12] god spoke to jonah
[5:14] jonah
[5:16] huh
[5:17] jonah who is that my earring ditch
[5:20] jonah
[5:22] i am the lord of god there is a city
[5:25] called nineveh far away
[5:27] it is filled with people that have
[5:29] become wicked lives they are forgotten
[5:32] about kindness and helping others
[5:34] why are you telling me about them god
[5:37] because i want you to go there
[5:40] and tell those wicked people i'm going
[5:42] to destroy them in their city because of
[5:45] their wicked ways
[5:48] yes lord i will go but they won't listen
[5:52] they're evil
[5:53] the more jonah thought about it
[5:56] more uneasy he became
[5:58] that night jonah did not sleep very well
[6:02] no
[6:03] ill hurt me
[6:05] nineveh is so far
[6:07] they'll laugh at me no
[6:10] jonah was denying god's plan for him
[6:14] nineveh
[6:15] those people don't even know about god
[6:18] why should they believe me
[6:21] they might even try to
[6:23] kill me
[6:25] more jonah thought about those wicked
[6:27] people the more frightened he became he
[6:30] decided to run away from god that very
[6:34] night he packed his clothes and hurried
[6:37] to the sheep for it
[6:39] that
[6:40] the next morning he saw a ship that was
[6:43] getting ready to share far across the
[6:45] sheet hope who goes there
[6:48] uh jonas
[6:49] sure uh please captain let me come with
[6:52] you i'll give you all my money for a
[6:54] place on your ship huh looks like
[6:56] trouble to me yes i wonder what he's
[6:59] running away from
[7:00] well i guess we can find a place for you
[7:04] jonah boarded the ship and hid deep in
[7:08] the hold as far away from god as he
[7:11] could at last he saw the anchor being
[7:13] drawn up onto the dick at last we're
[7:16] heading
[7:17] out to open sea god will never find me
[7:20] now
[7:21] i'm going to have a new light for myself
[7:25] as soon as the ship was fought with far
[7:28] from land god sent a storm
[7:31] for no one can hide from god said
[7:35] god sent great gusts flying over the sea
[7:40] and waves cashing over the ship
[7:43] men on dick we're taking on overboard
[7:46] captain we're shanking we need to
[7:48] overboard the ship throw the cargo
[7:51] overboard
[7:52] and all the sailors went under the
[7:55] when went inside the ship look he's
[7:57] sound asleep we need all hands on deck
[8:00] dick
[8:01] hey wake up
[8:03] wake up come we have no time to wake him
[8:06] now as the sailors closed the door joe
[8:09] no war fell asleep
[8:11] that
[8:13] outside it was dark as night the sailors
[8:16] began to throw the cargo overboard jonah
[8:19] ran a blind deck only
[8:21] one thing will save the ship
[8:24] stop
[8:25] stop
[8:26] you must throw me into the water instead
[8:30] what are you saying we can't throw an
[8:33] innocent man into this angry sea
[8:35] listen
[8:37] god has sent this storm to punish me
[8:41] punish
[8:42] why
[8:43] i tried to run away from him and now he
[8:48] has found me
[8:50] if we throw him over now he'll surely
[8:53] drown but the wind and the waves are too
[8:55] much for us we have no choice the
[8:58] sailors grabbed jonah and drew into the
[9:01] sheep
[9:03] the sea
[9:04] became calm
[9:07] down down
[9:09] down into the sea shank jonah
[9:13] gasping immediately drowning but god was
[9:16] not yet
[9:18] finished with jonah he sent a big fish
[9:21] to swallow jonah in one gulp
[9:24] jonah found himself in the stomach of a
[9:28] great fish
[9:29] oh it's so dark in here what will become
[9:33] for me now
[9:34] maybe god will still hear me jonah turn
[9:38] to the lord
[9:40] lord thank you for shaving me inside the
[9:44] fish jonah prayed for three days i'm
[9:48] sorry i tried to hide from you please
[9:51] let me out of this terrible prison i
[9:54] will do as you commanded
[9:56] god heard jonah
[9:58] and knew he had changed he made the fish
[10:01] spit
[10:02] out jonah onto the land
[10:06] thank you merciful lord for delivering
[10:09] me safely to land
[10:12] now jonah go to nineveh and tell those
[10:15] wicked people i am going to destroy them
[10:18] yes lord i'm listening i'm on my way
[10:23] jonah entered the city calling to the
[10:26] people
[10:27] people of nineveh listen to me
[10:31] the lord god will destroy you and your
[10:34] city stop your wicked ways
[10:38] watch did you hear that
[10:40] you have angered god he says the lord is
[10:44] angry with us why
[10:46] what have we done you are vain and
[10:49] shellfish
[10:51] maybe if we change our ways we've been
[10:53] too concerned with our fancy clothes you
[10:57] are greedy and unkind
[11:00] we should share our riches with the poor
[11:03] you are wasteful as the poor star
[11:07] we've been eating too much and not
[11:09] caring about our hungry neighbors it's
[11:11] true we've been selfish god will punish
[11:15] you
[11:16] we must all pray to the lord for
[11:18] forgiveness
[11:20] the people heard jonah
[11:22] prayed to god and me
[11:24] and began meaning their ways
[11:27] meanwhile
[11:28] god
[11:29] jonah climbed a hill above the city and
[11:32] sat down to watch god just
[11:34] destroy it he waited
[11:36] and waited
[11:38] i feel like a fool
[11:41] all my work has wasted
[11:44] god is not destroying nineveh jonah
[11:48] yes lord
[11:49] jonah will you never learn my love
[11:52] my love is great it is greater than my
[11:55] anger
[11:56] and it is for all my creatures didn't i
[11:59] give you another chance yes you did
[12:03] now i am giving the ninevites another
[12:06] chance go now jonah and try to love as i
[12:09] do
[12:10] then you will be a true man of god
[12:13] yay for god he has forgiven us
[12:19] so jonah began his long journey home
[12:23] and tried to love as god had taught him
[12:27] the
[12:28] end
[12:39] amen
[12:41] i i've had i've got all the children's
[12:43] attention right now
[12:45] i'll slowly lose it over the evening but
[12:47] i've got all of them looking
[12:49] praise the lord yes i
[12:51] look at youtube sometimes i know none of
[12:53] you do but sometimes i find something
[12:55] good on youtube
[12:57] i just don't know how she finishes what
[12:59] i've tried to preach in five services
[13:01] in seven minutes
[13:03] pretty much covered it didn't she amen
[13:06] praise the lord well we appreciate that
[13:08] and
[13:10] i just wanted to finish up tonight just
[13:12] a few thoughts from sunday and also just
[13:14] take it a little bit further in a couple
[13:16] scriptures the lord gave me and i know i
[13:17] mentioned sunday that i mentioned some
[13:20] things that went on personally in
[13:21] brother braham's life and i wanted to be
[13:22] a little bit more specific with that and
[13:24] he really come through some things like
[13:26] jonah
[13:27] and uh
[13:28] you know very similar in how god had to
[13:30] correct him and a few things
[13:32] and so i want to get into that we'll see
[13:34] how far we get tonight but hopefully we
[13:35] can finish up some of the things i'd
[13:37] like you to pay attention to matthew
[13:39] chapter 9 and make a few comments about
[13:41] jesus being moved with compassion
[13:44] for those sheep that have gone astray
[13:47] those sheep that it didn't have a
[13:48] shepherd and uh his compassion there was
[13:51] stirred up within him
[13:54] and uh other others could look at these
[13:56] sheep and look at these people these
[13:58] multitudes and and feel nothing
[14:01] but jesus could feel something
[14:04] jesus was stirred up in his heart jesus
[14:07] when he says that he was moved with
[14:09] compassion that means something was
[14:11] moved inside of him and it broke his
[14:13] heart and he felt something for these
[14:16] people where others didn't feel jesus
[14:18] felt he just didn't move on to the next
[14:20] campaign but he looked at them and he
[14:22] was moved with compassion
[14:25] that is what i want to be
[14:28] is that what you want to be tonight uh
[14:30] he was he was broke in his heart and i
[14:33] guess the opposite of being moved is
[14:36] being unmoved
[14:37] unmovable in your heart unmovable in
[14:39] your feeling unmovable in your
[14:41] compassion
[14:42] and being past feeling and overlooking
[14:46] the need of people that don't have
[14:48] leadership and i just say lord help us
[14:50] not to be to where our heart is unmoved
[14:53] would you raise your hand and say help
[14:55] me lord not to be in that place where my
[14:57] heart becomes unmoved but let my heart
[15:00] always be moved let my my spirit be
[15:03] moved with compassion let me let me
[15:05] never lose my feeling can you say amen
[15:08] this is a generation where we become
[15:10] numb by the sins of the world and numb
[15:12] by different politics and all these
[15:14] things going on and our feeling can
[15:17] jesus even said that the love of many
[15:19] would grow cold during the end time i
[15:21] don't want that to happen to me
[15:24] i want to stay with the fires of the
[15:25] holy spirit in my heart and burning for
[15:27] him my love of god comes natural but to
[15:30] stay on fire for him and keep the
[15:32] feeling of god that's what i want to
[15:34] keep and i don't want to just have love
[15:36] but we know have been taught by the
[15:38] prophet it's not just the love but it's
[15:41] when love projects that grace takes over
[15:45] so you can have the love of christ but
[15:47] it's when it's projected that it gets
[15:49] somewhere
[15:50] and so boy i'm just i'm moved by this
[15:52] scripture to see jesus
[15:54] and
[15:55] with his disciples and i just wanted to
[15:58] look at this because i suppose that many
[16:00] denominations and churches would look at
[16:02] jesus in this scripture and they'd see
[16:04] he turned to his disciple and he said
[16:06] pray that the lord sends laborers
[16:08] because the the need is great there's so
[16:10] many he looked at the multitudes he was
[16:12] moved with compassion and then he says
[16:14] pray the lord of harvest we'll send
[16:16] laborers we need more helpers there's a
[16:18] great job to do here and i suppose many
[16:20] of the big systems of churches would
[16:22] look at that and say that's what we need
[16:24] to do we need we need to employ more
[16:26] people we need more missionaries we need
[16:29] to employ missionaries to go over seed
[16:31] seas and we need to we need to send more
[16:34] the more the better we need helpers we
[16:36] need more bodies we need more volunteers
[16:39] jesus said we we need more servants and
[16:42] people with servants hearts and you know
[16:44] what servant's hearts mean that's chair
[16:46] stackers that's what one guy said it
[16:48] means he's a good cheer stacker well we
[16:50] believe servant's heart means something
[16:52] more than that here but that's what they
[16:54] think we need more bodies we need more
[16:55] volunteers we need more laborers but
[16:57] let's not forget the point that jesus is
[17:00] making his subject is we need more moved
[17:04] with compassion for the lost
[17:08] because you see you can have a lot of
[17:09] bodies and a lot of volunteers but are
[17:12] they move with compassion
[17:15] you could send a bunch of them overseas
[17:17] but if the holy spirit isn't moving them
[17:19] and they have a burden and they
[17:20] recognize the need and they want to help
[17:23] fulfill that need they in other words
[17:24] you have to be moved in your heart to be
[17:26] used of the lord if you want to be a
[17:28] laborer in his kingdom it's not
[17:30] mechanical it said i do it because i
[17:32] love people and i see there's sheep
[17:34] grown astray i want to be a witness i
[17:36] want to be a help to his kingdom
[17:38] can you say man so lest we just make it
[17:40] mechanical he's asking not just for
[17:43] laborers but he's asking for more of us
[17:45] to be moved with compassion for the lost
[17:48] not just more bodies the sheep are being
[17:51] misled and notice in this scripture says
[17:53] they are without a shepherd and so this
[17:56] is one of the reasons that he's moved
[17:58] with compassion is that the sheep have
[18:00] gone astray
[18:01] and that's what happens with us when
[18:03] people we see people go astray or we see
[18:06] friends leave what they believe before
[18:09] or we see people get uh
[18:12] just go at a certain direction and then
[18:14] it moves our heart but he's moved
[18:16] because they have no shepherd and that's
[18:18] what moved him because why they were
[18:20] being misled and one thing i want you to
[18:22] catch tonight as we go through jonah a
[18:24] little bit and also brother branham and
[18:25] speak about his life i want you to
[18:27] notice that many times it's because
[18:30] people are misled that they're going the
[18:32] direction they are
[18:35] and we have to remember that
[18:37] to have compassion for them because it's
[18:40] not always just the thing that they made
[18:42] a decision themselves they got away from
[18:45] god's shepherding and they're being
[18:47] influenced by what's on the internet
[18:49] they're being influenced by other
[18:50] spirits they're going down a direction
[18:53] but it's not always all of them and
[18:54] we're going to find brother benham said
[18:56] that sometimes it's god's people but
[18:58] they're being misled and so we have to
[19:00] have a compassion and not write them off
[19:03] can you say man but we have to realize
[19:05] they're just off track because they're
[19:07] like sheep going astray they've been
[19:08] misled they've
[19:10] under the wrong we do that with a young
[19:12] person you can watch them go through
[19:13] their stages of under all kinds of
[19:15] different influences and you can be very
[19:17] critical or you can pray for them love
[19:20] them admonish them in a godly way but if
[19:22] you get overly critical you have to
[19:24] realize they have to go through stages
[19:27] of learning and getting influenced by
[19:29] the wrong thing and we pray them right
[19:31] back again
[19:32] a lot of times you have to be careful
[19:33] because you'll you'll damage their heart
[19:36] too quickly by criticizing them and
[19:38] they're just under an influence for a
[19:39] season is that okay with everybody
[19:42] every one of us are susceptible to be
[19:44] influenced by the wrong spirit sometimes
[19:47] and if that can happen with you you say
[19:49] well not me i don't go out there and do
[19:51] that and wear those type of dresses
[19:52] those young girls are wearing and those
[19:54] things but you see you might be
[19:55] influenced by the wrong doctrine
[19:57] the wrong preacher
[20:00] right so all of us unless we stay close
[20:02] to the holy spirit can be influenced
[20:04] just like a young person or a kid can
[20:07] and so because of that we should have
[20:08] grace in our hearts and say they may be
[20:10] under an influence right now but god
[20:13] moved me with compassion to pray for
[20:15] them until they're restored back again
[20:18] so there's something about his being
[20:20] moved by this about the sheep going
[20:22] astray it touched him it made him feel
[20:25] for them he wanted to he wanted to do
[20:27] something about it and appeal to to more
[20:30] laborers that we need people it's not
[20:33] just that we need more people we need
[20:35] more people with holy ghost compassion
[20:38] and love
[20:41] praise the lord
[20:43] i began this series with this quote so
[20:45] i'm going to put it up again out of god
[20:47] doesn't call a man to judgment without
[20:48] first warning him
[20:50] and brother brahm said this is the
[20:51] reason i went into this series jonah
[20:53] took a different attitude
[20:55] he gets on top of the hill and said well
[20:57] it'd be a good if i never was born and
[21:00] oh how he went on and god had a little
[21:02] gourd to come up and make him some shade
[21:04] till he got cooled off
[21:06] up there but he said now here i went
[21:08] down there and they're going to say i'm
[21:09] a false prophet and god spoke to him and
[21:12] said look at the city down there look
[21:13] here jonah that whole city is repenting
[21:16] with sackcloth and ashes and then he
[21:18] told him about the little gourd and the
[21:20] worm that it cut down
[21:22] one day the lord willing
[21:25] i want to come to the tabernacle and
[21:26] take a series just on jonah oh there's
[21:30] so many great that east wind blowing and
[21:33] all oh my there's so many things in
[21:35] there it's it's thrilling
[21:38] them nuggets in there it all types right
[21:40] in fit it even brings jesus christ in it
[21:44] and everything else
[21:46] i'm certainly not replacing what the
[21:48] prophet could do in a series but that
[21:50] intrigued me to show there's a lot more
[21:51] in here than what we read on the surface
[21:54] i found the mystery of god in here i
[21:56] found that the first part of jonah's
[21:57] life type christ going in the tomb for
[22:00] three days and coming out but the last
[22:01] part types the bride that has to come to
[22:04] a victory in divine love and burn all
[22:07] the stubbornness out of us all the
[22:08] resentment all the bitterness can you
[22:10] say man if we're going to be effective
[22:12] for the lord with the wonderful message
[22:14] that we hold then we cannot have anger
[22:18] unresolved anger in our hearts we cannot
[22:20] have prejudice in our heart
[22:23] we can have we can we can't have a lack
[22:25] of something to where it would cause us
[22:27] to to not have feeling for the people we
[22:30] must have holy ghost feeling and
[22:32] affection for the people not compromise
[22:35] but we must have something that goes
[22:36] with this message it's not just having
[22:39] truth but it's it's it's the things that
[22:42] go with truth it's how truth is
[22:44] presented amen
[22:47] and it all comes in the spirit of christ
[22:50] so christ is revealed in the very last
[22:52] verse of jonah 4 11 the very last verse
[22:56] the depth of christ
[22:58] mercy
[23:00] compassion
[23:01] and forgiveness
[23:03] is revealed
[23:04] to jonah
[23:05] the last verse of the bible speaks of
[23:09] jesus christ
[23:12] and it's revealed that's what i want to
[23:14] tell this tonight the the compassion of
[23:16] christ revealed to jonah
[23:18] jonah was in the let me just say it this
[23:20] way all right
[23:22] jonah was in the message and declared
[23:24] the message
[23:26] but now the christ of the message was
[23:28] being revealed to jonah
[23:32] can i say it again
[23:34] jonah was in the message called to the
[23:36] message and even proclaimed the message
[23:39] but he hadn't yet seen the christ of the
[23:42] message to affect him yet
[23:46] and bring a tremendous victory in divine
[23:49] love so that's why i say
[23:52] if you look up the word truth there's
[23:54] words that go with it many times in the
[23:56] bible truth and mercy truth and love
[23:59] truth is usually never by itself it goes
[24:01] with something and that's because if we
[24:03] just held truth without the character
[24:05] christ without the love of christ
[24:07] without the forgiveness of christ then
[24:09] it's missing the element to it but if
[24:11] we're going to be a proclaimer of truth
[24:13] which i believe we have been blessed
[24:15] with restored truth like no other people
[24:17] has been blessed
[24:18] i i feel so blessed tonight i i just
[24:21] don't know how to thank the lord for
[24:22] what he's placed in our hands in the
[24:24] last days i look at people and i have
[24:26] compassion them because a lot of times
[24:28] it's they don't have light upon the
[24:30] scripture even and i'm blessed with much
[24:33] light tonight on the bible that i can
[24:35] understand things i thank god for it i
[24:38] don't deserve all this light that i hold
[24:39] within me i don't deserve all this
[24:41] revelation but there's one thing for
[24:43] sure i don't want to be stingy with it i
[24:46] don't want to have an attitude with it i
[24:48] want to be a light to this world
[24:50] expressing the character of jesus christ
[24:54] if they're going to see the message let
[24:55] it be more than doctrine let them see
[24:58] let them see the revealing of jesus
[25:00] christ
[25:02] and that's the last verse
[25:04] it's jonah was in the message declared
[25:06] the message but now the christ of the
[25:08] message was revealed to jonah let me say
[25:10] this
[25:11] god released his forgiveness to the
[25:14] ninevites
[25:16] but jonah had not released his
[25:18] forgiveness
[25:20] to the ninevites
[25:24] i'm summing up tonight
[25:26] god had released his forgiveness already
[25:30] to the ninevites but jonah was missing
[25:32] it to release something releasing him
[25:35] and release his anger and say let me get
[25:37] rid of my anger and let me be let me my
[25:41] forgiveness be released to them too now
[25:43] i know it's the same i know it's christ
[25:45] in us but this as we look at brother
[25:48] branham's life now he he himself admits
[25:51] he says i need a little change in me
[25:53] didn't need to be born again again
[25:58] didn't have a lack of the holy ghost
[26:00] but he'd come along there as god looked
[26:02] at him and there's just something laying
[26:04] there and he says god told me not to do
[26:07] this i was doing this wrong god told me
[26:10] not to think about it this way god told
[26:12] me not to have this attitude towards
[26:14] certain ones he's correcting me so it
[26:16] wasn't a problem with brother brahms
[26:17] experience can you say amen but it's
[26:19] something deeper that had to happen in
[26:22] him can you say amen that if there's
[26:24] some part of anger and the thing about
[26:26] anger friends anger holds back the
[26:29] forgiveness of god
[26:31] anger hold if you've got christ within
[26:34] you anger holds it back
[26:37] anger makes you withhold
[26:40] everything that's good in you anger
[26:42] makes you withhold it
[26:44] but when you resolve your anger and and
[26:46] just get rid of all that then everything
[26:48] that's within you gets released to the
[26:50] people
[26:53] how do we know that because god himself
[26:56] is a god of anger
[26:57] can you say amen but psalms is full of
[27:00] scriptures that says he gets he's passed
[27:02] his anger and his his compassion he's
[27:06] full he's full
[27:08] of compassion
[27:10] and his anger doesn't last very long
[27:14] he does get angry
[27:16] but it doesn't last very long
[27:18] because something is released to the
[27:20] people
[27:22] if christ
[27:23] is within us
[27:25] how many would raise your hand boldly
[27:26] and say i believe i have christ living
[27:28] within me
[27:29] that christ needs to be released
[27:33] and it can be held back
[27:35] by anger
[27:39] so god had forgiven
[27:41] god had released his forgiveness which
[27:44] jonah didn't understand especially when
[27:46] he spoke
[27:47] you people are going to die i give you
[27:49] 40 days it's over and he went on the
[27:51] hill to sit down as brother brahm said
[27:53] and watch this whole thing be destroyed
[27:55] i'm going to get my popcorn i'm going to
[27:58] sit up on the hill and i'm going to
[27:59] watch what i said is going to come to
[28:01] pass and all of a sudden it wasn't
[28:03] happening and down in nineveh god had to
[28:05] come and tell them they have repented
[28:07] and so now god releases his forgiveness
[28:12] to this whole ninevites
[28:16] was it supposed to happen that way
[28:18] but god is short in his anger he won't
[28:20] hold his anger forever
[28:22] when he's seen what he need to see i'm
[28:24] gonna show you two things tonight that
[28:25] he's seen number one was repentance he's
[28:26] seen repentance but he's seen something
[28:28] else and when that happened it released
[28:30] his forgiveness but but god released his
[28:33] forgiveness anger
[28:35] the anger in jonah
[28:36] held back
[28:38] his acceptance
[28:41] his forgiveness
[28:45] god's compassion released forgiveness to
[28:47] them
[28:49] but it was for what god seen in the
[28:51] ninevites
[28:53] and here's number one they repented and
[28:55] number two
[28:57] he's bringing out in verse 11
[28:59] that did you know jonah that they cannot
[29:02] even discern between their right hand
[29:04] and their left hand and they could not
[29:06] discern that here it is
[29:09] god released his forgiveness because
[29:11] they could not discern the condition
[29:14] that they were in
[29:16] amen
[29:18] were they in sin
[29:19] were they making god angry it got worse
[29:22] every day
[29:23] but god discovered these men can't even
[29:25] tell their left hand from the right and
[29:27] that's not just naturally but that means
[29:30] they did not have the knowledge or the
[29:32] discernment i don't know how many years
[29:34] it heaped up in sin but they did not
[29:36] know that they were in this life of sin
[29:39] they had no revelation that they were
[29:42] living that way are you holding on to my
[29:44] point now
[29:45] are you seeing christ in this are you
[29:47] seeing christ at calvary and what he
[29:49] said from the cross
[29:52] they had no they did not understand and
[29:55] god was angry at their sin but he seen
[29:58] something deeper they were so blind to
[30:01] it all they did not know
[30:04] or have any discernment of the condition
[30:06] they were in they had what the bible
[30:07] calls a their understanding was darkened
[30:11] darkness blackness is a lack of
[30:13] understanding spiritually light is
[30:15] revelation
[30:17] when light comes the people get
[30:19] revelation understanding they see where
[30:21] they're at if light doesn't come or they
[30:23] reject light they live in their darkness
[30:25] and that means that they not only start
[30:27] sinning
[30:28] they not only develop a life full of
[30:30] sinning but the worst part is is that
[30:32] light has come and they reject the light
[30:34] so they live in this darkened
[30:36] understanding of things in other words
[30:39] they're blind they're blind they don't
[30:41] have the discernment to tell
[30:44] what's right or wrong somebody tell me
[30:47] what generation that is
[30:50] no more discernment about what's right
[30:52] and wrong
[30:53] for that matter no can't even tell
[30:57] say clearly this is a boy and this is
[30:59] the girl can't do it anymore they'll
[31:02] defy science and biology and everything
[31:05] but their mind is so darkened they won't
[31:08] admit no if that boy girl chooses a
[31:10] different way it's their choice what
[31:12] arrogance is that amen
[31:14] what kind of arrogance are we raising
[31:16] when you say if i decide if it's against
[31:19] god if it's against science if it's
[31:21] against biology if it's against
[31:23] everything we can see it doesn't matter
[31:25] because i decided it's going to happen
[31:27] the parents are going to support it
[31:30] that's a darkened generation
[31:34] that's that's a generation that has no
[31:37] discernment that's a generation
[31:39] paul says it in the bible whose
[31:41] conscience
[31:42] has been seared
[31:44] with a hot iron
[31:46] because there used to be you'd have a
[31:48] conscience of right and wrong
[31:50] never mind the holy ghost just the
[31:51] conscience of what's right
[31:53] but when you get to the place the
[31:55] conscience is seared there's nothing
[31:57] left
[31:58] that's our generation
[32:01] and uh
[32:02] they were so blind they did not know i
[32:05] have any discernment of condition they
[32:06] were in a darkened understanding
[32:08] and he says
[32:09] jonah shouldn't i spare
[32:12] these people who not only are in sin
[32:16] but don't know who they are don't know
[32:18] they are in sin and don't know how to
[32:20] get out
[32:22] amen
[32:23] it's one thing to be in sin
[32:26] it's another level
[32:28] not to know that you're in sin
[32:33] or how you got there
[32:35] or how you get out oh the love of the
[32:38] lord when he brings you in
[32:39] it might take you years but he'll show
[32:42] you what life you were living he'll show
[32:45] you how you got there
[32:46] he can show you the very moment where
[32:48] you got off track
[32:51] he can go back and just it just in your
[32:53] whole life because he's got he's got the
[32:55] blueprint for your life i tell young
[32:57] people this he he's he's got it all he
[32:59] was aware of it all and he can point you
[33:01] back this is where this started wasn't
[33:03] the prophet doing that in the prayer
[33:04] lines
[33:07] can you say man
[33:09] and the thing i preach is a god that
[33:11] would know so perfectly your past
[33:14] wouldn't he know your future just as
[33:16] well
[33:18] praise the lord
[33:20] he went there into those vision and
[33:22] discernment and he pegged and said you
[33:24] were with the doctor here and he said
[33:26] this and this happened when you were
[33:28] young and and just pegging the very
[33:30] moment this nervousness started or the
[33:32] very moment this sin started that's when
[33:35] you got off track god knows friends
[33:38] god knows our lives and if he knows the
[33:40] past he knows the future
[33:43] brother brahm said that he says don't
[33:45] you think in this prayer line that the
[33:46] god that can show me that you that
[33:48] vision don't you think the same god
[33:50] could tell me that you're going to be
[33:51] healed from today on
[33:54] amen he's the god of the past but he's
[33:55] the god of the future
[33:57] praise the lord
[33:59] and i love a god like that can you say
[34:01] amen it's one thing to be in sin it's
[34:03] another level to not know it or to not
[34:05] know how you got there and to be blind
[34:07] and to not have leadership and to get
[34:10] under the wrong influence and to fall
[34:13] and so the forgiveness gets released
[34:15] from god based on the ignorance of the
[34:18] people
[34:19] so he did not destroy them because they
[34:21] repented and because they didn't know
[34:24] what they were doing
[34:26] which is in jesus jesus words it this
[34:28] way he asked god to forgive them at the
[34:33] cross
[34:34] for they know not what they do
[34:39] so that you know what that covered all
[34:41] all of us
[34:43] that would be his bloodshed
[34:46] and the spirit going throughout
[34:47] generation through his word
[34:49] that would be his blood that go through
[34:50] before we were even born we go through
[34:52] our life we start living a life of sin
[34:54] before we give our heart to the lord and
[34:56] start we go we go through we're going
[34:58] through it not knowing what we're doing
[35:00] not knowing who we truly are his blood
[35:03] begins to come there and he says father
[35:05] forgive them he's asking the father
[35:08] to go ahead and release the forgiveness
[35:14] and and we're not even born yet
[35:19] but he's all looking on the crowd as i
[35:21] said he's looking at the crowd that's
[35:23] killing him jews his own people
[35:25] but he knew they didn't know what they
[35:27] were doing if they didn't know what they
[35:29] were doing they wouldn't have been
[35:30] crucifying their messiah they're still
[35:32] looking for their messiah and 2 000
[35:35] years ago they killed him they sent him
[35:37] to pontius pilate they took care of him
[35:40] can you imagine now us
[35:42] how how does it happen that you're
[35:44] looking at your very own people and
[35:46] they're the ones that's orchestrating
[35:47] put you on the cross
[35:49] but
[35:50] forgiveness was released
[35:53] because he knew they did not know what
[35:55] they were doing
[35:58] that's powerful friends
[36:01] i'll release my forgiveness anyway
[36:05] i'm gonna let
[36:06] god i'm gonna ask you lord to forgive
[36:08] them i'm gonna stand in the gap for them
[36:11] right now
[36:12] i got a child
[36:14] they're wild they're a wild child
[36:18] they're embarrassing me on the internet
[36:23] but god i'm gonna ask you to release
[36:26] your power i'm going to ask you to
[36:27] release your forgiveness i'm going to
[36:29] ask you to release it lord and not have
[36:32] some type of standard they have to come
[36:34] through
[36:35] that before they're forgiven to say lord
[36:37] they need your power they need your
[36:39] change
[36:41] they need your forgiveness
[36:42] [Music]
[36:44] father forgive them they don't even know
[36:46] what they're doing now for a parent
[36:48] that's hard to say because a parent can
[36:50] easily say they know what they're doing
[36:52] i taught them better than that
[36:55] and i understand that part and there's a
[36:57] lot of rebellion and there's ones that
[36:59] do know
[37:00] but do they know by the holy ghost or do
[37:04] they know by you
[37:05] by what you put in their heads
[37:09] [Music]
[37:10] so you understand how the lord's taken
[37:12] us deeper how we judge things
[37:16] we could say they know better i taught
[37:18] them better that they grew up in a
[37:20] better church than that and so mentally
[37:22] now
[37:23] we're thinking that they know better how
[37:25] in the world can we get that result but
[37:27] you're only looking at it from from a
[37:29] mental standpoint
[37:31] and you may not know what's going on in
[37:33] that heart i don't i'm not here tonight
[37:35] to justify sin i'm not here to say just
[37:39] justify everything they're doing i'm not
[37:40] here don't push like on every wrong
[37:42] thing they're doing you're not helping
[37:44] that kid by pushing like that's my child
[37:46] i'm going to like what they're doing
[37:47] like like like like like i wouldn't be
[37:50] doing that
[37:51] but you don't have to like or unlike
[37:53] they know what you like and don't like
[37:55] they know what you believe can you say
[37:58] but it's not about you
[38:00] trying to fix them so that you look
[38:02] better to the whole world it's getting
[38:04] deeper saying father they need something
[38:07] they don't know what they're doing they
[38:09] really don't know what they're doing
[38:11] until they have a real experience
[38:15] the true experience they're operating
[38:18] from a mental
[38:20] uh a conscience or something
[38:22] and
[38:23] somebody who doesn't have the holy ghost
[38:26] and tries to live this message
[38:29] for years there's some people that max
[38:32] out because it's too hard to live
[38:35] without the holy ghost
[38:39] i'm not justifying their sin can you say
[38:41] man
[38:42] but we have to remember this is lived
[38:45] by a personal
[38:47] personal relationship with jesus christ
[38:51] a holy ghost a conversion can you say
[38:53] amen amen so who of any of us can tell
[38:59] can come down say this person
[39:01] they have it and they don't who
[39:03] who could do that
[39:04] we've tried to do it in the message for
[39:06] years and yet someone asked a question
[39:08] brother brahma i want you to tell us one
[39:10] thing that we can put our finger down
[39:11] and say this person has the holy ghost
[39:14] and this person don't brother brandon he
[39:15] was asked about it he says there's not a
[39:17] way in the world for you to do it
[39:20] and yet he preached all the fruits of a
[39:22] person's life he preached so many things
[39:24] that you could see this holy spirit
[39:26] evidence in our life but then he brings
[39:28] us back to the evidence
[39:30] it's not
[39:31] just fruits or it's not just dress wear
[39:35] you know what the evidence of the holy
[39:36] ghost is talk
[39:38] because you can't go that direction if
[39:40] you keep going a direction to make the
[39:42] evidence of the holy ghost dress where
[39:45] you become a denomination
[39:49] even though we believe in holy dress we
[39:51] believe in separating dress we leave
[39:53] guys
[39:54] be men girls be girls and all these
[39:56] other things
[39:57] but you can't go down that path too much
[39:59] like some churches have where you make
[40:02] the evidence now i can tell they have
[40:04] the holy spirit
[40:07] the bible says there's not a way in the
[40:09] world for you to do it that's right
[40:11] why because only god can see
[40:15] the innermost part
[40:17] of what's going on inside
[40:21] amen
[40:22] so we pray
[40:25] we pray earnestly
[40:27] and we can even say father
[40:29] forgive them
[40:33] brother brown said some places
[40:37] it was their only hope because somebody
[40:39] abraham up on the mountain was praying
[40:40] for law
[40:42] and it was the only hope he had amen
[40:45] we're standing in the gap
[40:48] father forgive them they don't know what
[40:50] they're doing
[40:51] they said that on the internet
[40:54] lord if they know what they're then they
[40:55] shouldn't said it but lord if they don't
[40:57] know what they're doing god
[40:59] forgive them
[41:00] change them
[41:02] love them draw
[41:04] them rebuke them in your way
[41:08] shock them shake them amen
[41:12] praise the lord amen
[41:16] father please forgive them now they
[41:18] don't know what they're doing so this
[41:20] this is christ in the last verse
[41:22] in other words
[41:24] forgiveness was not held back
[41:27] until they could see
[41:28] what they were doing completely
[41:34] go ahead and say amen i need a drink
[41:38] i just got thirsty
[41:43] forgiveness was not held back
[41:46] until certain requirements were made
[41:50] forgiveness not held back until they
[41:52] could see what they were doing
[41:54] completely
[41:55] because to see the wickedness of their
[41:57] ways completely
[41:59] forgiveness was not held back
[42:02] i tell you friends i'm sometimes i'm
[42:04] into a subject here that i'm just saying
[42:07] lord teach me
[42:08] because i feel like i'm
[42:10] i'm not treading upon waters that's not
[42:12] it's not something that's not solid here
[42:14] but it's new territory for me
[42:17] because i'm sometimes the guy that says
[42:19] how much do we do this and compromise
[42:23] those are the questions that i weigh
[42:25] which you have too
[42:28] but you cannot
[42:30] none of us have a right to withhold
[42:34] the love and forgiveness of god we don't
[42:37] have a right to withhold it
[42:40] amen
[42:42] so forgiveness not held back until they
[42:44] could see what they're doing wrong
[42:45] completely
[42:46] jonah's compassion and forgiveness was
[42:49] withheld it was held back because his
[42:52] anger was still there his anger was
[42:54] unresolved and we've explored why it was
[42:56] there but but his anger was still there
[42:59] and resolved his forgiveness could not
[43:01] be released because his anger was not
[43:04] resolved his compassion was limited to
[43:07] things
[43:08] instead of souls and that's what he
[43:10] preached sunday his compassion and his
[43:12] pity was on the gourd
[43:14] his compassion everybody remember the
[43:16] gourd from sunday remember the plant and
[43:18] remember that he was having such
[43:20] sympathy
[43:21] uh not empathy somebody came up sunday
[43:23] and told me there's a difference in
[43:24] sympathy and empathy
[43:26] empathy is deeper right
[43:28] sympathy i'm sorry that that happened to
[43:30] you empathy enters into the need of a
[43:32] person
[43:33] but here's jonah having sympathy for
[43:35] this plan you poor thing look at you you
[43:37] look what the worm did to you and just
[43:39] all this pour himself into this thing
[43:42] instead of souls
[43:45] his compassion was poured into
[43:48] something
[43:50] or a plant or something
[43:52] instead of souls and it was having
[43:54] sympathy it was relating and i can
[43:56] relate to you
[43:58] the plant that's been destroyed the gore
[44:01] you poor gourd
[44:02] that was destroyed by this worm it's not
[44:05] fair you're a victim and i can
[44:07] sympathize with you and cry with you
[44:09] because i'm a victim too
[44:12] i'm a victim you're a victim
[44:14] everybody's a victim wouldn't you like
[44:16] to be a victim too
[44:20] victim mentality
[44:22] now you're he's sympathizing with
[44:24] something like that and ignoring
[44:26] ignoring these souls that's right
[44:29] and i think i preached that enough
[44:30] sunday is that we're getting off track
[44:33] when we put such emphasis on things
[44:37] instead of souls
[44:40] is that okay with everybody
[44:42] jonah's compassion was forgiveness was
[44:44] withheld he held it back because anger
[44:46] is still there and when anger is still
[44:49] unresolved this is a bit of teaching
[44:50] tonight
[44:52] teaching and preaching so it's treaching
[44:56] his anger was still there and when anger
[44:58] is unresolved your forgiveness cannot be
[45:00] released
[45:02] his compassion was limited to things
[45:04] instead of souls plants and things made
[45:07] him happier than people he didn't even
[45:09] really like being around people he
[45:10] didn't like people
[45:14] plants and things
[45:17] made him happier than people
[45:20] he didn't even really like to be around
[45:22] people too much
[45:27] i'd rather just be alone with my
[45:32] whatever
[45:34] i don't need people
[45:36] it just doesn't work that way
[45:38] amen from the very way god created us in
[45:41] the beginning he said it is not good for
[45:44] man to be alone
[45:46] he made us relational
[45:49] god is relational
[45:51] god didn't want to be alone
[45:53] so he created sons and daughters of god
[45:55] so he could fellowship with you you know
[45:57] tonight wednesday was one of the
[45:59] purposes that god had from the beginning
[46:01] when he was alone i'm going to create
[46:02] sons and daughters so they'll come to
[46:04] church on wednesday night and i can
[46:05] fellowship with them
[46:08] they'll talk to me and worship and i'll
[46:09] speak back to them you're in the
[46:11] fellowship that god had wanted before
[46:12] the foundation of the world
[46:14] god was lonely he wanted fellowship
[46:16] god's a relational being he made us
[46:19] relational beings you can't be an island
[46:21] to yourself it's not going to solve
[46:23] anything i'm going to go away with all
[46:24] my anger it's not going to jonah said
[46:26] i'll die with my anger i don't need
[46:28] nobody i don't need the ninevites i
[46:30] don't need anybody and yes i'm better
[46:32] off with my anger and i'll die with it
[46:33] that's how stubborn he got
[46:36] people go off to themselves and they
[46:38] think that's the answer it's not the
[46:39] answer
[46:41] there needs to be a release of your
[46:43] anger so there can be a release of your
[46:45] forgiveness
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:48] blessed be his name turn with me if you
[46:49] would in matthew chapter 18.
[46:54] matthew 18.
[46:57] and i'm aware of the time yes matthew 18
[46:59] and verse
[47:00] uh just towards the end here jesus
[47:03] here's another expression of this
[47:05] god's forgiveness must be expressed also
[47:09] in us it's not just god forgiving but we
[47:13] also must express the forgiveness of god
[47:17] and it says here in verse 23 i think it
[47:19] is matthew 18 23
[47:22] therefore is the kingdom of heaven
[47:23] likened unto a certain king which would
[47:25] take account of his servants and when he
[47:26] had begun to reckon one was brought unto
[47:28] him which owed him ten thousand talents
[47:31] but for as much as he had not to pay his
[47:33] lord commanded him to be sold and his
[47:35] wife and children and all that he had
[47:37] and payment to be made that was under
[47:39] the law even the old testament is that
[47:41] how that's how you paid your debt if you
[47:42] got in debt you paid with your land but
[47:44] you also also paid with your family it'd
[47:47] sell your family your wife and your
[47:48] children
[47:49] all that he had and payment to be made
[47:51] verse 26 the servant therefore fell down
[47:54] and worshipped him saying lord have
[47:56] patience with me and i will pay the all
[47:58] then the lord of that servant was moved
[48:00] with compassion uh oh underline it
[48:02] there's the term again that's right
[48:05] the lord of that servant was moved with
[48:08] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[48:11] him the dead he asked
[48:14] he asked for time
[48:16] he showed humility can you say amen and
[48:19] forgiveness was released to him
[48:21] does anybody learn anything tonight amen
[48:24] it was loose to him compassion was loose
[48:26] to him forgiveness was loose to him he
[48:28] forgave him but the same servant went
[48:31] out and found one of his fellow servants
[48:33] which owed him
[48:34] a hundred pence and he laid hands on him
[48:36] and took him by the throat oh my
[48:38] goodness
[48:39] saying pay me what thou owest and his
[48:42] fellow servant fell down in his feet and
[48:43] he saw him saying have patience with me
[48:46] and i will pay thee said the same very
[48:48] same words he just said to his lord same
[48:51] words
[48:52] same humility but guess what no
[48:54] forgiveness is released to this guy
[48:58] his fellow servant fell down his feet he
[49:00] saw him saying have patience with me and
[49:01] i will pay thee and he would not but
[49:03] went and cast him into the prison so he
[49:05] should pay the debt so when his fellow
[49:06] servants saw what was done they were
[49:08] very sorry and came and told the lord
[49:10] that all was done then his lord after
[49:12] that he had called him said unto him oh
[49:14] thou wicked servant i forgave thee all
[49:16] that debt because thou desirest me
[49:19] should us not thou also have had
[49:21] compassion on my fellow servant even as
[49:25] i had pity on thee
[49:28] are you learning something here amen
[49:30] god doesn't look at it just he's
[49:33] forgiving but this forgiveness trickles
[49:35] down
[49:36] into our lives
[49:38] to others
[49:40] if he's going to release his forgiveness
[49:43] then we can't hold ours back
[49:46] oh
[49:47] say ouch or something
[49:51] should it not thou hast had compassion
[49:53] thy fellow servant and even i lay pity
[49:55] on thee and his lord was wroth and
[49:57] delivered them to the tormentors till he
[49:58] should pay all that was doing to him so
[50:00] likewise also shall my heavenly father
[50:03] do also unto you if ye from your hearts
[50:06] forgive
[50:07] not everyone his brother
[50:10] their
[50:11] trespasses so i don't have to bring it
[50:13] down home to a brother trespassing
[50:15] against you jesus did it himself he
[50:17] brings it right down to your life every
[50:19] day and if somebody do you wrong
[50:23] this scripture applies don't run to god
[50:27] and say god please forgive me give me
[50:30] time god please forgive my debt and then
[50:32] you turn around and not offer that to
[50:34] someone else something's wrong with this
[50:36] picture
[50:38] it doesn't work that way in the
[50:39] forgiveness of god forgiveness is not
[50:42] meant to be held back forgiveness is
[50:44] meant to be released
[50:46] can i get an amen tonight
[50:49] love and forgiveness and all these
[50:50] elements that we have within us friend
[50:52] that come from the holy ghost they're
[50:54] never meant to be held up you don't have
[50:56] a right to hold them back give them to
[50:58] some people not give them the other give
[51:00] them to another person not give them to
[51:02] other no it's to be released
[51:07] get given out can you say amen it's to
[51:10] flow through us
[51:12] but what about this what about that what
[51:14] if what if they did what if they do it
[51:16] again to me
[51:18] just just release the forgiveness of god
[51:26] so brother
[51:27] as i'm moving along here now
[51:30] brother bradham
[51:31] had a season that he went through
[51:34] and he called it a complex and it was
[51:36] from the people not listening to him and
[51:38] not responding and following the word
[51:40] like he felt like they should he
[51:41] preached around he said it seemed like i
[51:43] go to a certain city and i preach and
[51:45] the next year i come back it seems the
[51:46] people get worse and so he over time
[51:49] this built up he called it a complex and
[51:52] the people weren't obey him and then
[51:54] he says
[51:56] i had lost the feeling of the people
[51:59] he hadn't lost his gift
[52:01] he hadn't lost his holy ghost he hadn't
[52:04] lost his ministry
[52:07] he hadn't lost going to church he hadn't
[52:10] lost
[52:11] his friends
[52:13] something happened internally in him
[52:15] that really only him and god could see
[52:18] and then he finally admitted it
[52:20] that we must not lose the feeling of the
[52:23] people he's still preaching
[52:25] he preached the seals
[52:27] having this
[52:28] holding there in his heart
[52:31] my timeline shows when he referred back
[52:33] that this was going throughout when he
[52:35] preached the seven seals which to me was
[52:37] the
[52:37] the
[52:38] such a climax to what he was used of the
[52:41] lord to bring from the lamb of god
[52:43] and here he's preaching through all this
[52:45] time and internally this is happening
[52:48] and he i'm not saying this he admitted i
[52:50] have lost the feeling for the people
[52:53] still preaching to them
[52:55] the people are still being blessed
[52:58] people are still being healed
[53:01] but it's just interesting to me friends
[53:03] that it's a it's a lesson for all of us
[53:05] that we can be functioning and
[53:07] everything going we can be coming to
[53:09] church and god can bless us and he can
[53:11] bless our finances if we're faithful
[53:12] with this and all this can be going on
[53:15] but we really need to pay attention to
[53:17] where our motives are going where our
[53:20] spirit's going internally because all of
[53:22] a sudden something can happen
[53:25] and you're going in a certain direction
[53:27] and your heart is just going another way
[53:31] this is what was happening to him that's
[53:33] right and for him he finally admitted he
[53:35] said i realized that i had lost
[53:38] the feeling of the people he says here
[53:41] in the book of revelations when you get
[53:42] to latest in church age revelations the
[53:44] third so now i'm just going to read some
[53:46] things i've got plenty of time
[53:49] well i got 10 minutes
[53:52] but
[53:53] just hold with me here okay
[53:55] and i know once i get to a certain point
[53:57] i know
[53:58] that you're going to be all for me
[54:00] continuing this on another service
[54:04] you'll get a certain point say yeah
[54:06] maybe you ought to finish it another
[54:07] time
[54:10] but this is so good we just want to take
[54:12] our time with it
[54:13] this is good for me i don't know how
[54:15] you're feeling but this has been a great
[54:17] lesson for me
[54:18] because i believe the message and i
[54:20] believe i have the love of christ with
[54:21] me and i believe i've expressed it but i
[54:24] want to take god's hint when he says
[54:25] that there's still some prejudice in
[54:27] there is if i'm holding back something
[54:30] i want to know what it is because i
[54:32] don't have a right to hold that back
[54:36] now the book of revelations when we get
[54:37] to the latest in church age in the
[54:38] revelation the third chapter the bible
[54:40] said that this age the earliest and age
[54:41] was blind
[54:42] because you're rich you say you're rich
[54:44] and you're creased with goods greatest
[54:45] churches the finest dressed people the
[54:47] greatest that there isn't been any age
[54:49] because you say i have need of nothing
[54:51] noahust thou not that thou are poor
[54:53] miserable wretched naked blind and don't
[54:55] know it now if a man was in this
[54:57] condition and you could tell his tell
[54:59] him his condition and and would try to
[55:02] help himself if he was mentally right
[55:05] but when he's in that condition
[55:08] and you can't tell him any different he
[55:10] just don't believe that he's naked he
[55:12] doesn't believe that he's in that shape
[55:14] then it shows that here that he is blind
[55:16] the god of this world has blinded the
[55:18] eyes of those that refuse to serve
[55:20] christ and they're they're so blind that
[55:23] they can't see the sign that we're
[55:24] living in this hour the time that we're
[55:26] living in and remember there's already
[55:28] been one stand in the gap and no one
[55:30] else can stand this is in the message
[55:32] standing in the gap
[55:33] you either have to accept that that
[55:35] remedy or you're doomed and now to us to
[55:38] get close now to what i want to say
[55:40] could we stand now i'm preaching to
[55:42] myself in this
[55:44] could we stand and see a human being
[55:46] that's blind physically blind and know
[55:48] that he's walking over a cliff could we
[55:51] of our state of mind that we're in this
[55:53] morning could we stand and see a blind
[55:55] man walk over a cliff line and not try
[55:57] to warn him
[55:58] it would be there it would be so cruel
[56:01] we would be so indifferent in our heart
[56:03] could you imagine a person getting so
[56:05] indifferent that he could almost laugh
[56:07] and see a blind man that cannot see and
[56:09] can't help himself deliberately walk
[56:12] over a cliff that would be a bad thing
[56:14] do nothing about it well to my brethren
[56:16] world over i want to make this
[56:18] confession i humbly say it that that's
[56:20] just about what i was doing or fixing to
[56:24] do
[56:27] i didn't say that he
[56:28] said you know he's getting ready to
[56:30] leave the ministry
[56:32] over this complex
[56:34] and losing the feeling of people he's
[56:36] getting ready and making plans
[56:38] to exit the ministry that's right
[56:41] but you see even the great saint paul
[56:43] and this is the next quote
[56:46] in indictment
[56:47] even the great saint paul got between
[56:49] straits one time and many times that god
[56:52] has did things or let servants do it
[56:53] that was mistakes
[56:55] in order to prove these things now we
[56:57] know that human beings can make mistakes
[56:59] but god can make no mistake now if i get
[57:02] into the field of preaching and going
[57:03] that the way i do then i have to set up
[57:05] meetings ahead and get things lined up
[57:07] and perhaps this is that great time
[57:08] coming that we've been looking for and
[57:10] surely if this is in itself a tremendous
[57:13] thing that will bring to pass and may
[57:15] come to pass the tremendous victory in
[57:16] the love divine and that's the verb
[57:18] before the adverb then it's divine love
[57:20] which is god see and then it takes the
[57:23] love of god to dash out there on the
[57:25] front line and stand in the gap for the
[57:27] people
[57:30] and these
[57:31] um
[57:32] so this notice the sermon now god's
[57:34] showing him
[57:35] if there's no one to stand in the gap
[57:38] if there's no one to pray
[57:40] if moses wouldn't have stood in the gap
[57:42] god would have destroyed the people
[57:44] somebody's got to stand in the gap
[57:46] and sometimes it's only you that'll
[57:48] stand in the gap for somebody
[57:50] you have to have a feeling to do that
[57:52] you have to have love to do that and
[57:54] then it takes the love of god to dash
[57:56] out there on the front line and stand in
[57:57] the gap for the people
[57:59] and these rickeys and raketas that have
[58:01] so sassed the words and i've called them
[58:04] ricky and ricketta
[58:08] god give me to understand i shouldn't do
[58:11] that
[58:12] because that's many of them are still
[58:15] his children
[58:20] they can't help because they act so much
[58:22] different
[58:23] some of these old cold former churches
[58:25] has got them that spirit on them and
[58:27] they're much in in a person as israel
[58:30] was in prison as much israel was in
[58:32] prison just as much moses went down to
[58:34] deliver them from slavery human beings
[58:37] that loved jesus christ
[58:40] would serve him
[58:41] if they only knew what to serve him by
[58:45] and they're in bondage under
[58:47] denominationalism that tells them don't
[58:50] you do this and don't you do that
[58:54] so this is the term he started to use in
[58:56] 58 the rickies and raquettas and it's
[58:59] probably related to ricky nelson elvis
[59:02] he mentioned all those names and now all
[59:04] the world wants to follow the ricky
[59:05] nelsons and act like the recognizance
[59:07] but the biggest problem is when they
[59:08] tried to bring it in the church and now
[59:10] all of them were acting on stage like
[59:12] ricky nelson like elvis it was a
[59:15] deception and so he he didn't hold back
[59:18] this is the term he gave him rickey's
[59:19] and rickettas ricky's over and over and
[59:23] over again
[59:24] and here
[59:25] he says god
[59:27] showed me that i shouldn't do that
[59:30] because
[59:33] of the influence that they have been
[59:35] under
[59:36] of the denominations that taught them
[59:38] that's okay
[59:42] so when you look at it like who's at
[59:43] fault here
[59:46] they're at fault yes but who's that real
[59:48] thought he's looking deeper than just
[59:50] saying i'm going to take this person and
[59:52] quickly lay them label them a ricky and
[59:54] ricketta and that's it and take a
[59:56] personal stab at him but he's looking at
[59:58] a different god saying now wait a minute
[1:00:00] now when you look at the denominational
[1:00:02] systems and all that's been taught by
[1:00:04] the clergy that's failed in the word of
[1:00:06] god to tell them truth you've got a
[1:00:07] generation that's up there on the stage
[1:00:10] got the stage looks like a rock and roll
[1:00:12] concert and they i wouldn't call it
[1:00:14] ricky's today but they look like the
[1:00:16] justin bieber let's bring it up today
[1:00:18] justin bieber on the stage in the church
[1:00:20] trying to worship looking like justin
[1:00:22] bieber so i'll call him beepers brother
[1:00:25] brown i'm calling him ricky's america
[1:00:26] i'll call them beepers
[1:00:28] and he began to slam that and seen it
[1:00:30] come in the pentecostals even to some of
[1:00:33] the quartets and too much showmanship in
[1:00:35] the stage he labeled him ricky's up
[1:00:37] there ricky's up there rookies up there
[1:00:40] i know he'd get quiet but he did
[1:00:43] they're showing off instead of the
[1:00:44] sincerity of worshiping god it becomes
[1:00:46] just a big show even in the quartets and
[1:00:49] he's ricky's ricardo these ricky's but
[1:00:51] see god comes and corrects them a little
[1:00:53] bit and realizes that is it all their
[1:00:55] fault they're under an influence i said
[1:00:58] they're under an influence
[1:01:00] so you can keep
[1:01:01] labeling that that's fine but it's not
[1:01:03] going to do any good until another
[1:01:05] influence comes in their life and that
[1:01:07] stronghold is broke can you say amen
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:11] and who
[1:01:12] ultimately is responsible then
[1:01:17] in the next one he's bringing an
[1:01:18] indictment but the indictment is on the
[1:01:20] entire church world and the clergy that
[1:01:23] lead the people the wrong way misleading
[1:01:25] souls
[1:01:27] a lot of times i look at young people
[1:01:29] and if they're acting a certain way
[1:01:31] i look at how
[1:01:33] they were raised i look at their
[1:01:35] influence i look a lot before i quickly
[1:01:37] judge where they're at
[1:01:40] because to me
[1:01:43] sometimes
[1:01:45] they're a product of the influence that
[1:01:47] they've been under
[1:01:49] so yeah you could you could really come
[1:01:51] down and say they're all fault are they
[1:01:52] all at fault
[1:01:54] if a preacher abuses his authority and
[1:01:56] abuses the people
[1:01:58] on the judgment day will it be the sheep
[1:02:00] that answers for all of that
[1:02:06] the lord i'm really into it here tonight
[1:02:10] i'm just asking the the
[1:02:13] brother branham is being led by the lord
[1:02:15] to look at this different that's right
[1:02:18] and he said human beings that love jesus
[1:02:20] would serve him if they only know what
[1:02:23] to serve him by and they're in bondage
[1:02:25] under denomination that tells them don't
[1:02:27] do this and don't do that don't believe
[1:02:30] in that crazy stuff don't believe in
[1:02:31] that don't believe in that and and so
[1:02:34] the devil's telling to and yet and
[1:02:35] influence him to be like the world
[1:02:38] but don't believe what he's bringing in
[1:02:40] the message
[1:02:43] who's responsible for that
[1:02:44] oh friends i could say a lot right now
[1:02:48] who's responsible when parents misdirect
[1:02:50] a child
[1:02:52] against this message
[1:02:54] or hold your heart back from this
[1:02:55] message who's going to be responsible
[1:02:58] well they're acting like a wild person
[1:03:00] out there but who started who planted
[1:03:02] seeds to make them afraid of the message
[1:03:06] tell you the reckoning day is coming
[1:03:07] someday and it won't just be honing in
[1:03:10] on that person that's living out the sin
[1:03:12] it'll be a bigger picture than that
[1:03:16] he says an indictment how can you be a
[1:03:18] part of that word when you deny
[1:03:19] practically all of it and the so he's
[1:03:21] referring to him god correcting him and
[1:03:23] the reason it's done is because not
[1:03:25] because the people that's the reason i
[1:03:27] think god spoke to me about calling out
[1:03:29] the people the rickies and rickettes
[1:03:32] god
[1:03:33] spoke to the prophet about calling his
[1:03:36] people the reikis and ricketts
[1:03:40] these are quotes that you don't hear
[1:03:42] sometimes
[1:03:44] because they don't want to admit that
[1:03:46] god had to correct the prophet or he
[1:03:47] made him many mistakes
[1:03:49] god spoke to me about calling his people
[1:03:51] rickies and ricketts it's because of
[1:03:53] these selfish denominations has got
[1:03:55] those people living out there in the way
[1:03:57] that they're living
[1:04:02] you know i know something he continued
[1:04:04] to use the terms rickies and rickettas
[1:04:08] a lot
[1:04:11] so you know what i say to that
[1:04:14] i say
[1:04:16] that it wasn't what it's not wrong for
[1:04:18] god's prophet to rebuke what he sees
[1:04:22] it's the motive and the spirit that he
[1:04:24] was doing it in
[1:04:26] to hone in on that person and god's
[1:04:28] trying to it may not just be that person
[1:04:31] it's their influence
[1:04:33] because he said it you can you can
[1:04:35] search it from 63 he's still saying rick
[1:04:38] he's in ricketts and he's still the holy
[1:04:40] ghost has tell him to call out those
[1:04:41] things because that's what it is
[1:04:44] but what changed what changed
[1:04:47] god wanted the prophet's heart to change
[1:04:50] how he looked at it and look at it in
[1:04:53] the bigger picture
[1:04:55] come on friends haven't we had this
[1:04:58] happen in the message for years
[1:05:00] we think we're going to do a service by
[1:05:02] going in and just destroying quickly
[1:05:05] someone who's not wearing the right
[1:05:07] thing and you
[1:05:08] you run in there and just
[1:05:11] jump really quickly
[1:05:13] we've done it for years if i can just
[1:05:16] get this corrected everything the church
[1:05:18] will be all right if i can just make
[1:05:20] them do the right thing my home will be
[1:05:22] all right and you found it wasn't true
[1:05:26] because god is a relational being
[1:05:29] they're a relational being they have a
[1:05:31] soul
[1:05:32] can i get an amen
[1:05:35] i don't justify sin i don't justify
[1:05:37] dressing in modest any of that i'm just
[1:05:39] saying our approach you have to realize
[1:05:42] we're not just praying to change their
[1:05:44] dress we're praying that god will change
[1:05:46] their influence
[1:05:48] is that okay we're praying for a whole
[1:05:50] change and not just an outward change
[1:05:54] he continued to use the term but he had
[1:05:56] change in his heart and the feeling he
[1:05:57] had a feeling for them god did not say
[1:05:59] to not rebuke the rickies he corrected
[1:06:02] the prophet to know they are acting that
[1:06:04] way because of the wrong influence and
[1:06:07] all of a sudden now
[1:06:09] forgiveness was released brother brahm
[1:06:11] did not leave the ministry thankfully
[1:06:13] and forget what was happened through
[1:06:15] this rebuke to the prophet
[1:06:17] forgiveness was released it goes through
[1:06:19] all the way to the message shalom you
[1:06:20] can read it i'd refer to it sunday he
[1:06:23] cares do you care all this that he had
[1:06:24] done in the prophet and and it's it's
[1:06:27] have an effect on him that he has even a
[1:06:28] more effective ministry because he's
[1:06:31] preaching even in a greater way an
[1:06:33] anointing because why internally down
[1:06:35] here he knows his position that he may
[1:06:38] not be able to correct all of those
[1:06:40] things that he sees on the outside but
[1:06:42] he's got a message he's he's preaching
[1:06:45] the holy ghost
[1:06:46] and he has within him what to preach for
[1:06:50] a real change he has light
[1:06:53] he has the light
[1:06:55] and if you've got the light let the
[1:06:57] light go forth and do its work on the
[1:07:00] darkness
[1:07:01] is that okay with everybody
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:04] i love that now i i just can't leave
[1:07:08] tonight without reading this this last
[1:07:10] week i was looking for this quote
[1:07:13] and uh
[1:07:15] couldn't find it couldn't work it right
[1:07:16] to get it right and i wanted to read it
[1:07:18] before we closed tonight
[1:07:19] and i think this sums it up a lot i just
[1:07:21] i love if you if you want to go through
[1:07:24] you'll find this and standing in the gap
[1:07:27] then he refers to it here in the
[1:07:28] indictment i read it to you where he
[1:07:29] says god told me not to do not to do
[1:07:31] that and not to look at it that way he
[1:07:33] comes up to a few messages later and
[1:07:35] humble thyself and he says i need a
[1:07:37] little change in my life
[1:07:39] not so much he needed to be saved again
[1:07:41] or anything like but i he said i just
[1:07:43] i'm going to wait to pray i need a
[1:07:44] little change and he referred to the
[1:07:46] little changes being that attitude that
[1:07:48] he spoke of towards those if i speak the
[1:07:51] word and they reject it well that's up
[1:07:52] to them let him go he said no i should
[1:07:54] be running down the river and continue
[1:07:56] to pray and continue to speak to them
[1:07:58] and continue to reach out to them
[1:08:01] all along then he comes up 64.
[1:08:04] first message 64 shalom and he says is
[1:08:07] it because the people don't know what
[1:08:08] they're doing there's a lot of good
[1:08:10] people out there but they're under
[1:08:12] darkness and they don't know the state
[1:08:14] that they're in
[1:08:15] what's it going to take be a light share
[1:08:17] share light with them that's right and
[1:08:19] let the light do the work to break the
[1:08:20] darkness but meanwhile meanwhile there's
[1:08:24] a real love for someone
[1:08:26] who's under darkness and don't know
[1:08:29] the condition they're in
[1:08:31] don't they know better than that
[1:08:33] and these days they may not
[1:08:36] so you can write them off
[1:08:38] but they may not know by understanding
[1:08:40] what they're doing at all
[1:08:42] so i was looking for this quote and then
[1:08:44] all of a sudden a brother for the alex
[1:08:45] mcgillis
[1:08:47] after he heard what i preached he sent
[1:08:49] me this quote he said brother that's the
[1:08:50] one i was looking for and this is what
[1:08:52] it says you're going to love this
[1:08:54] well
[1:08:54] you might
[1:08:56] he might be repenting after this some of
[1:08:58] us
[1:09:03] yeah that one brother
[1:09:04] kyle if i have found grace in your sight
[1:09:08] through god
[1:09:09] you take my word for this brethren
[1:09:12] if you want to be a blessing
[1:09:14] and get a blessing
[1:09:15] go ahead stand up you can stand up come
[1:09:17] on
[1:09:20] if you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:09:22] blessing
[1:09:23] when a man has done you wrong
[1:09:25] and he is absolutely justly he i mean he
[1:09:28] has done you wrong and you know that
[1:09:31] he's done you wrong he's done you evil
[1:09:34] don't mention that well there's a lesson
[1:09:36] right there
[1:09:39] you're not supposed to talk about
[1:09:40] everybody else
[1:09:42] hello
[1:09:44] don't mention that
[1:09:47] we talked to everybody about it
[1:09:49] don't mention that you take him to
[1:09:52] prayer before god
[1:09:55] next and don't take it in a way of just
[1:09:58] a selfish and say well i'm supposed to
[1:10:00] do this but stand with your shoulder to
[1:10:03] his shoulder and stand in the presence
[1:10:05] of god our father
[1:10:07] way a prayer should be made in the
[1:10:08] presence of god say father he's my
[1:10:10] brother
[1:10:11] and he is justly he deserves punishment
[1:10:14] because he has done me evil
[1:10:17] and i don't see why he did it
[1:10:20] then let god do talk let god go to
[1:10:23] talking to you
[1:10:24] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[1:10:27] been through
[1:10:28] the devil has twisted him up somewhere
[1:10:31] and caused him to do that
[1:10:33] amen though he's absolutely wrong
[1:10:37] before you leave the throne of god
[1:10:39] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:10:42] stop right there you'll be you'll be
[1:10:44] feeling sorry for this is what prayer
[1:10:46] does this is what forgiveness is this is
[1:10:48] what softening your heart does
[1:10:50] instead of acting and telling everybody
[1:10:52] about stuff acting in your anger instead
[1:10:54] of saying he's done me wrong that's it
[1:10:56] it's over yes
[1:10:59] people do you wrong all the time i'm
[1:11:01] sure they do you're wrong your bosses
[1:11:03] and your husbands or wives or whatever
[1:11:05] sometimes they they do it wrong they
[1:11:06] stay wrong they accuse you wrong this is
[1:11:08] what the prophet says to deal with it
[1:11:10] don't mention anybody go to prayer about
[1:11:12] it and you put yourself that here's what
[1:11:14] he's doing god will go to talking to you
[1:11:17] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[1:11:19] been through the devil has twisted him
[1:11:20] up somewhere and caused him to do that
[1:11:23] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[1:11:25] leave the throne of god you'll be
[1:11:26] feeling sorry for that man why because
[1:11:28] you're looking at it from a different
[1:11:30] light from heaven's perspective
[1:11:33] you'll be sympathizing with that
[1:11:36] next quote
[1:11:38] you'll be sympathizing with that and
[1:11:39] when you get back down to earth again
[1:11:42] you'll go over to that brother and shake
[1:11:44] his hand because you know what he's been
[1:11:47] through
[1:11:49] oh lord jesus help us
[1:11:54] let's not let's let this penetrate into
[1:11:57] us because i know some of you
[1:12:00] hold grudges
[1:12:01] and you haven't went to that brother and
[1:12:03] shook his hand
[1:12:04] no he's done he's finished
[1:12:07] i've forgiven him really
[1:12:09] it's a strange way to express it
[1:12:12] no you haven't released forgiveness yet
[1:12:15] i already prayed about it but he's
[1:12:17] saying this is the effect of our prayer
[1:12:18] when you come back down earth you go
[1:12:20] over that brother and shake his hand
[1:12:21] because you know what he's been through
[1:12:23] you can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:12:25] presence of god and condemn anybody
[1:12:31] i don't believe no sir even if he's a
[1:12:33] rank
[1:12:34] sinner
[1:12:35] and what about a brother that has made a
[1:12:37] mistake though i say he's wrong
[1:12:41] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:12:44] not wrong
[1:12:45] you better know your information first
[1:12:48] but if he is wrong well if he will take
[1:12:50] him to the throne of god stand there
[1:12:52] shoulder shoulder with our brother
[1:12:53] knowing his immoral mortal and maybe his
[1:12:56] destination
[1:12:58] rest upon our
[1:13:00] attitude towards him
[1:13:04] powerful
[1:13:05] words
[1:13:06] from god's prophet
[1:13:08] powerful words lord
[1:13:11] let it be more than just a quote
[1:13:14] i need more of this can you say amen
[1:13:17] i need to look at it from heaven's
[1:13:19] perspective i need to grow into maturity
[1:13:21] this way
[1:13:22] my compassion needs to go deeper than
[1:13:24] what it is
[1:13:26] and if i can be that vessel that stands
[1:13:28] in the gap
[1:13:29] and he may be to realize his internal
[1:13:32] destination
[1:13:33] is based upon my response
[1:13:36] my response to this whole thing may god
[1:13:39] help us to watch our response he brought
[1:13:41] a bunch of things he could be wrong
[1:13:44] you ever consider that it could look
[1:13:45] like he's wrong and it isn't
[1:13:48] the devil twisted him up he is wrong or
[1:13:50] it could could be hearsay
[1:13:53] see it could be you get in the presence
[1:13:55] of the lord you realize
[1:13:57] we've done wrong too
[1:13:59] done the wrong things and so you just
[1:14:01] start to feel
[1:14:02] a comrade with that brother you realize
[1:14:04] that no matter how dastardly he's done
[1:14:06] you bad
[1:14:08] how could we do it like the little girl
[1:14:11] said that god said to jonah did i
[1:14:14] forgive you when you ran away from me
[1:14:18] and jonah had to admit
[1:14:19] yes
[1:14:21] so if i forgave you why can't you

[1:18:04] jonah was holding it back
[1:18:06] but lord
[1:18:07] you released it to the ninevites
[1:18:10] because they repented and because lord

[1:18:14] state they were in
[1:18:16] so he said i'm gonna go ahead and
[1:18:18] change and release my forgiveness and
