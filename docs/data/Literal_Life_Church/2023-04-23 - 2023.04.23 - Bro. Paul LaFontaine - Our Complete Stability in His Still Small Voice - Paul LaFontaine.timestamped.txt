[0:00] and we trust we can bring something out
[0:01] of the word of God this morning we are
[0:03] very blessed and we're a rich people
[0:05] we're spiritual billionaires
[0:08] the bride is spiritual billionaires and
[0:11] we are blessed this morning with an
[0:13] inheritance and blessed with his word
[0:14] and so we should not take it for granted
[0:17] what we have and what God is speaking to
[0:19] us and what he's doing in our lives and
[0:22] this is the core of who we are when we
[0:24] meet together and worship this way and
[0:26] get into the word this way this is the
[0:28] core of what makes us up here and we can
[0:31] have other events and other things in
[0:32] life and we appreciate those things but
[0:34] the word is our stability can you say
[0:37] Amen praise the Lord first and that's
[0:39] what I want to speak about this morning
[0:40] our complete stability in his still
[0:43] small voice
[0:44] our cons our complete stability is in
[0:47] his still small voice
[0:49] First Kings 19 and we'll start reading
[0:52] at verse 9. we're picking up where
[0:54] Elijah here in the third phase of how
[0:56] the Lord dealt with him here and he came
[0:58] thinner thither unto a cave and lodged
[1:01] there and behold the word of the Lord
[1:04] came to him and he said unto him what do
[1:07] us thou hear Elijah and he said I have
[1:09] been very jealous for the Lord God of
[1:11] hosts for the children of Israel have
[1:13] forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine
[1:16] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[1:18] sword and I even I only am left and they
[1:22] seek my life to take it and he said go
[1:25] forth and stand upon the mount before
[1:27] the Lord and behold the Lord passed by
[1:31] and a great and strong wind rent the
[1:34] mountains and break in pieces the Rocks
[1:37] before the Lord but the Lord was not in
[1:40] the Wind
[1:41] and after the wind and earthquake but
[1:44] the Lord was not in the earthquake now
[1:47] this is extremely important what's being
[1:50] said here because God is going to show
[1:53] what he is going to be in
[1:57] and he's also going to show what he's
[1:59] not in
[2:01] that's important especially when you
[2:04] have people who are thirsty to find God
[2:07] and thirsty to find more of God they're
[2:09] in a vulnerable state because we must
[2:11] not just seek it anywhere but we must
[2:13] find what God is in and what he's
[2:15] speaking through
[2:18] we could be very deceived into thinking
[2:20] God is in something but he must make it
[2:22] clear to the prophet here where God is
[2:24] in where God is in and he said he wasn't
[2:26] in the wind he was not in the earthquake
[2:29] and after the earthquake a fire all
[2:32] these real extravagant uh flamboyant
[2:35] things very extreme things but he's
[2:37] making it clear I'm not in any of those
[2:40] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[2:42] Lord was not in the fire and after the
[2:46] fire a still Small Voice and I can
[2:50] finish it God is saying that's where
[2:52] you'll find me
[2:55] that's where you'll find me strange
[2:57] isn't it we look for big things but God
[3:00] says at the end this is where you're
[3:01] going to find me
[3:03] Heavenly Father we pray you'll bless the
[3:05] word bless the Every Soul that's here
[3:08] Lord in our midst and also online and
[3:11] whoever should hear this I Pray you'd
[3:13] anoint our words and God although many
[3:15] of us tired from the weekend and
[3:17] different things but God there's an
[3:19] energy in your Holy Spirit father when
[3:21] we begin to open your word and look at
[3:23] your promises father we know that we
[3:25] will be encouraged and uplifted we pray
[3:27] you'll bless every life that's here God
[3:29] every song that sung everything word
[3:32] that said may it be an encouragement and
[3:34] a blessing to us this morning as we've
[3:36] come to your house meet with us here
[3:38] Lord we pray and we commit the service
[3:40] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:43] Christ for your glory amen amen God
[3:46] bless you may be seated
[3:48] now I'm just actually finishing and
[3:50] capping off uh some uh leftover things
[3:54] from last Sunday and so some of you
[3:57] visitors will just have to just catch on
[3:59] and we're just going to cap it and and
[4:01] just get the leftovers you know
[4:03] sometimes leftovers can be very very
[4:05] good you realize that right but just the
[4:09] capping off that I didn't get to last
[4:10] Sunday of this subject and we'll see
[4:12] where the Lord will leave from here but
[4:14] we want to finish this and last week I
[4:16] had preached on the cure for emotional
[4:19] and mental instability I know that seems
[4:22] like a strange title but uh it's very
[4:25] important under the the current uh
[4:28] climate of the hour God has chosen us to
[4:31] live in uh it's very important to talk
[4:34] about emotional instability and mental
[4:38] instability you say well why do I need
[4:40] to preach to Believers about that well
[4:43] uh we're the only ones I believe that we
[4:45] have a place that we can go to bring any
[4:48] instability can you say man we're the
[4:51] ones that have a place to go praise the
[4:53] Lord aren't you glad you raise your hand
[4:55] this morning that we have a place to go
[4:56] for all of that and that's what I'm
[4:58] trying to point you to but to say we
[5:00] don't need to talk about it well that
[5:01] would be denying us as a human being
[5:03] because we are affected emotionally by
[5:06] things we are affected sometimes
[5:08] mentally by things but God has promised
[5:11] in his word that he'll give us uh mental
[5:13] stability he says I wish above all
[5:15] things you prosper and be in health as
[5:17] your soul prospers and that he would
[5:19] give you a sound mind
[5:23] he would give us a sound mind and so
[5:26] Calvary did not just provide a saving of
[5:30] from sin but it also provided all things
[5:33] that we need to bring to him and so now
[5:36] in the age that we live in and I
[5:37] elaborated on it last Sunday so I don't
[5:39] need to talk about but we explored a
[5:41] little bit of the cultural plague of
[5:43] addiction the cultural plague of
[5:45] addiction how many knows that we're in
[5:47] an age of addiction
[5:49] and and the addiction is usually from a
[5:52] lack of the reality of God in man's Soul
[5:54] people people are turning to addictions
[5:57] and come to that because they don't have
[5:58] Gall they don't have the availability or
[6:00] at least they're not seeking God because
[6:02] God is the source for our soul God is
[6:05] the source for our emotions
[6:07] and and so now we have a whole uh nation
[6:11] and World addicted uh by many many
[6:14] things they're addicted to and it's
[6:15] because that they have not turned to the
[6:18] to the answer that God has given and uh
[6:21] there's no sense in preaching about
[6:22] other people but sometimes Christians in
[6:25] a hard time in their life don't turn to
[6:28] the answer that they know is the answer
[6:29] they'll turn to other things to calm
[6:32] their nerves they'll turn to other
[6:34] things to kind of settle them down and
[6:36] they go through mental times as I read
[6:38] last Sunday about Elijah when he was
[6:40] under the Juniper treat he was going
[6:42] through a real mental strain he was
[6:44] going through a depression so let's not
[6:46] deny who we are we can have juniper
[6:48] trees in our lives we can have low times
[6:51] in our lives
[6:52] and uh and so this is a reality in the
[6:55] hour we live in and I won't speak uh
[6:57] much more on those things because we we
[7:00] covered it last Sunday but we realized
[7:02] there's a thirst because we are a
[7:04] three-part being and because we are
[7:06] emotional because we have our minds and
[7:09] not just our souls but we have our
[7:11] emotions that there are things that
[7:13] deplete us in our spirit uh sort of we
[7:17] can call it this way constant
[7:18] withdrawals from our emotional bank
[7:21] accounts and we live in a world that
[7:24] constantly drains us
[7:26] emotionally
[7:28] drains us mentally can you say man and I
[7:32] mentioned three things that causes that
[7:34] and that is it can be family or domestic
[7:36] trouble
[7:37] uh it can be number two a severe trauma
[7:41] that's happened in your life you lose a
[7:43] loved one or you have something happen
[7:46] or someone treats you in a wrong way
[7:48] there's some trauma that happens to your
[7:50] spirit that's the second reason
[7:51] sometimes your spirit gets uh there's a
[7:54] withdrawal from your emotional bank and
[7:56] then there's family and domestic trouble
[7:58] that's number one but then there's the
[7:59] third thing of the Demonic forces just
[8:02] in the next Dimension that is an
[8:04] increased pressure against the Bride of
[8:06] Jesus Christ
[8:08] every day in the other dimension there's
[8:11] forces against you as a son and daughter
[8:13] of God that that are always trying to
[8:15] and I'm going to get to it today always
[8:18] trying to
[8:19] mislead you or pull you away from or
[8:22] cause you to lose the value of the
[8:25] fountain and the source for emotional
[8:27] stability to turn you to something else
[8:30] to accuse the Brethren can you say Amen
[8:33] most of the Christians that's in this
[8:34] room and Believers understand the battle
[8:37] that you face and it doesn't get any
[8:39] lighter it's stronger demonic forces are
[8:43] against the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[8:45] drain you try to drain you spiritually
[8:47] and even though your soul would be
[8:50] sealed into the kingdom of God Satan
[8:53] with what is left to try to drain you
[8:55] emotionally to drain you mentally to to
[8:58] drain you spiritually can you say Amen
[9:01] and and then we get weak and and then
[9:04] when we get weak we're emotionally uh
[9:07] just simple sometimes
[9:10] but the worst part of it is is when we
[9:12] turn to hundreds of other remedies
[9:14] for this instability that we feel
[9:18] come on
[9:20] the worst part of news is we turn to
[9:22] other things to calm our nerves
[9:23] sometimes
[9:24] and there can be even within the circle
[9:27] Believers and I can talk about many
[9:29] things I did last Sunday about things we
[9:31] even would turn to sometimes but we must
[9:33] be careful even something that is
[9:35] wholesome we must be careful that
[9:38] there's not a replacement in our lives
[9:40] for the true stability that's in the
[9:42] word of God my theme today is he's
[9:45] provided a voice within his word and
[9:47] that's still Small Voice is our full
[9:50] stability in our lives that voice that
[9:53] word is our stability for emotional pain
[9:56] that word provides all things needed for
[9:59] for mentally not feeling right can you
[10:01] say Amen
[10:03] and so there's a place that God has
[10:05] given no matter what we've gone through
[10:06] and then and then I didn't get a lot of
[10:09] time on the last Sunday but within the
[10:11] circle of Believers there's one
[10:13] sometimes that will seek signs and they
[10:15] will seek Miracles and they will seek
[10:17] wonders and they will seek emotional
[10:19] highs to try to satisfy their
[10:23] nervousness and instability
[10:26] I didn't figure I'd get too many amens
[10:28] on that one right there
[10:30] but you might as well talk about it is
[10:33] that people will turn to some emotional
[10:35] High
[10:36] even in a service and think that's the
[10:39] final answer but I've been serving the
[10:41] lord long enough to know that I can be
[10:43] in the greatest Sunday services and the
[10:45] greatest conventions can you say man and
[10:48] feel so good can you say Amen but when I
[10:51] go home the question is is did he bring
[10:54] stability in your life to face the enemy
[10:56] the next day
[10:59] if it doesn't bring stability and
[11:01] emotional stability then we realize that
[11:03] it stays shallow it stays a bubble dance
[11:06] Christians in this hour cannot live on
[11:09] casual bubble dances with the Lord our
[11:12] experience has to be deep with the Lord
[11:13] our River has to run deep can you say
[11:16] amen and I believe God is calling us to
[11:20] be a stable people of faithful people
[11:24] that we found the source in God to bring
[11:27] emotional stability mental stability can
[11:30] you say man
[11:32] praise the Lord
[11:34] so
[11:36] you know We crave
[11:38] the approval of others
[11:41] to meet an emotional depletion
[11:47] pictures crave to be approved by others
[11:51] you shouldn't be seeking to be approved
[11:53] by other preachers you should seek he
[11:56] told the Pharisees you love the Praises
[11:58] of men more than the Praises of God and
[12:01] that's because people live emotionally
[12:03] off of the Praises of men but it's more
[12:06] important that you have God's support
[12:08] God's approval then this since been your
[12:11] whole life trying to build a big church
[12:13] or do whatever to impress all the
[12:15] preachers I'm not here to do that to
[12:17] meet an emotional need my emotional need
[12:19] can be filled in the word of God can I
[12:22] get an amen this morning
[12:24] we're not here to build big churches
[12:26] we're not here to impress other message
[12:28] churches we're not here for that we're
[12:30] here to preach the message of the last
[12:32] days and see lives change
[12:35] and to minister and heal people that are
[12:38] struggling in this hour
[12:40] they need healing can you say Amen they
[12:42] need mental stability
[12:45] and guess what we've got the word to
[12:47] give it to them
[12:49] we've got a place for it this morning
[12:51] people need a lot of healing marriages
[12:53] need healing
[12:55] and I wouldn't even get up here unless I
[12:57] knew that I'm pointing to a word this
[12:59] morning I'm pointing to a still Small
[13:01] Voice that is the answer for every need
[13:07] there's been a fountain opened in the
[13:09] House of David
[13:10] if we'll drink from that he has the
[13:13] answer to our needs
[13:16] praise the Lord We crave the approval of
[13:18] others to be acknowledged
[13:20] you know I could go on all day talking
[13:22] about the emotional needs sometimes we
[13:23] meet it because we're thinking we're
[13:24] getting something spiritual but
[13:26] sometimes we're so obsessed with with
[13:28] image and appearance before others
[13:30] people in the message
[13:33] all this is try to fill a void of some
[13:35] somehow emotional void
[13:37] then sometimes the person has to have a
[13:40] position
[13:41] in a church or they'll just leave
[13:46] they have to be seen
[13:49] but you see you should never take a gift
[13:51] and you should never try to be seen to
[13:54] fill an emotional void in your life
[13:57] am I speaking the truth this morning I
[13:59] know this is right now where we're
[14:01] living but we've got to grow into stable
[14:03] people can you say man we can't lean to
[14:06] the approval of others and we can't live
[14:08] on our appearance if I can just keep my
[14:10] appearance and right in front of
[14:12] everybody then that feels no we must
[14:14] fill it with God's approval and God's
[14:17] love in our lives
[14:20] because I guarantee you if you keep
[14:22] trying to fill it with other things from
[14:24] Hollywood movies all the way to the
[14:27] approval of preachers if you're trying
[14:28] to fill some need in your life you will
[14:30] be disappointed
[14:32] that's Satan's kingdom can you say man
[14:34] every alternative he has is a
[14:37] disappointment
[14:39] but in God there's no disappointment
[14:41] there's only satisfaction
[14:44] there's only satisfaction and may look
[14:48] sometimes it may look sometimes like God
[14:50] he didn't answer oh it may look like
[14:53] God's disappointed but God never
[14:55] disappoints us
[14:57] God will never disappoint you
[14:59] got to fill your needs can you say Amen
[15:03] God will establish you God will
[15:06] stabilize you God will even you out can
[15:09] you say that
[15:11] God can take whatever you brought to
[15:14] church this morning and God can give you
[15:16] a stable peaceful mind and heart to say
[15:20] Satan I'm going through this by the
[15:22] grace of God
[15:24] man Hallelujah
[15:27] when we find all of it we're not we are
[15:31] not here to fill our thirst for
[15:33] stability with all this with something
[15:35] else but we'll find all of it in the
[15:38] Lord in his voice and that's my theme so
[15:40] now I believe God's calling us to be a
[15:42] stable people to express stability and
[15:45] consistency in an inconsistent world
[15:49] confidence the Bible says in Proverbs
[15:51] metal not with those people who are
[15:53] given to change
[15:56] don't Fellowship a lot with people that
[15:59] are given to change
[16:01] in other words from one week to the next
[16:04] you don't know where they stand
[16:07] you look at their posts and it's like
[16:09] one week they're posting something
[16:11] that's completely contrary to a
[16:13] Christian testimony
[16:14] and the next week they're quoting a
[16:16] scripture as if they're so close to God
[16:18] it's an age of instability don't meddle
[16:22] with them that are given to change and
[16:24] instability don't depend on the
[16:27] government don't depend on anybody else
[16:29] can you say Amen find your stability in
[16:32] the word of God and in his voice
[16:35] I believe it's the people that God is
[16:37] Raising to be confident not arrogant
[16:40] all right
[16:41] but confident
[16:44] now I'll say this when you're not a
[16:46] sinner because you get nervous sometimes
[16:48] you're a human being you're not a sinner
[16:50] because you get anger angry
[16:53] just be angry and send not
[16:56] God made us who we are we get angry it's
[16:59] an emotion we we get nervous we have
[17:01] nerves God put them in our body we just
[17:04] got to find something to keep them calm
[17:05] we've got to find the Lord
[17:07] but we will get nervous Elijah got
[17:09] nervous
[17:11] we can't deny how God made us but it's
[17:14] when we choose temporal things
[17:16] constantly and I'm speaking to the
[17:18] social media generation I'm speaking to
[17:21] all of us who have millions of
[17:23] alternatives to calm our nerves excuse
[17:26] me from medicine all the way to the
[17:28] entertainments of the world
[17:31] we're in we're in Satan's Eden here and
[17:34] if I could describe it he's the God of
[17:36] this world and because he's the God of
[17:38] this world he presents things to
[17:40] Believers even that would be an
[17:43] alternative to calm our nerves
[17:46] and I'm not against any of it as I said
[17:48] last Sunday I'm not against if a
[17:50] medicine is helping we give God glory
[17:51] but give God glory
[17:53] and don't ever think that's your
[17:55] ultimate end
[18:01] God helps you through that and say I
[18:04] give God glory he's helping me because
[18:05] he heals through medicine
[18:08] he heals through music
[18:09] he heals through the Mutombo family
[18:13] amen amen
[18:15] he heals through a little bit of love he
[18:17] heals through a little bit of caring for
[18:19] somebody
[18:20] don't you put in a box how God heals
[18:22] it's not just a healing line it's just
[18:24] not a healing God's bigger than that God
[18:27] can heal you right now while I'm
[18:29] minister in this word there's a still
[18:31] small voice speaking right now
[18:33] [Applause]
[18:36] you're not a sinner because you get
[18:37] nervous but it's when we choose temporal
[18:39] things constantly and we never stabilize
[18:41] into a more faithful consistent walk
[18:44] with God how many would raise your hands
[18:45] I want a consistent walk with God I want
[18:48] a relationship with him that doesn't go
[18:50] from cat meat into cat meeting
[18:54] consistency can you say Amen
[18:56] God the the pressures you know for a
[19:01] Believer that's the way we got to look
[19:02] at it if if more pressure comes on us
[19:04] then we look at it is it's going to turn
[19:07] it into more power over the enemy in our
[19:10] lives
[19:13] God's called You Higher
[19:15] don't forget that
[19:18] God's not called you to just be stay in
[19:21] a juniper tree and that's what we had
[19:22] the three phases of Elijah's life among
[19:25] Carmel how many has ever had a Mount
[19:27] Carmel
[19:28] how many would like to always every day
[19:30] have a Mount Carmel well it didn't
[19:32] happen in Elijah so it's not going to
[19:33] happen with you
[19:36] and then brother Bram says the second
[19:37] phase the first one was Mount Carmel
[19:39] then he went straight down hit rock
[19:41] bottom under a juniper tree
[19:44] sleeping it off for days depression
[19:47] people sleep they sleep they've turned
[19:49] all kinds of things but Elijah just slap
[19:51] it off and just that's why he tells
[19:53] pastors brother Graham says
[19:55] honey pastor's wife let the man sleep on
[19:57] Monday let him sleep
[20:00] I wrote a song about it for pastors once
[20:02] and a pastor's getaway brother matama
[20:05] was there it's Monday morning let the
[20:09] pastor sleep in
[20:11] because no one understands what he's
[20:13] been through
[20:15] it's Monday morning let the pastor sleep
[20:19] in
[20:20] I forgot the words
[20:23] oh cause this is what the word says he
[20:25] can do
[20:30] it's a quote
[20:34] oh let me sleep in on Monday mornings
[20:39] he said well I just sleeping it off so
[20:41] he had he had a low time he was wanting
[20:43] to kill himself God just kill me God
[20:45] just shoot me I'm finished I'm done I
[20:48] got Jezebel barking at my heels I've got
[20:51] all this stuff going on and I've just he
[20:53] just come from that real high ministers
[20:56] watch yourself you come that high to
[20:57] that low and he come right through that
[21:00] to experience even Jesus experience this
[21:03] depressing feeling can you say Amen
[21:06] it's real don't deny that it's not going
[21:09] on
[21:10] and and so but you see you have to know
[21:13] in those times that God has called you
[21:16] to something higher
[21:18] can I get an amen this way God has
[21:20] called you for something more can you
[21:22] say Amen
[21:24] it reminds me of the the pilot was in a
[21:27] one seat plane and he was going and
[21:30] flying at a certain level and he hears
[21:32] something in the back and he looks at
[21:33] the back and there's this little mouse
[21:35] in the back just chitter chattering and
[21:37] the mouse actually as he was flying and
[21:40] he only had one seat there he couldn't
[21:41] get back to the mouse he just starts to
[21:43] eat at some of the wiring that's running
[21:45] the plane he's eating it and he's he's
[21:47] going at it so this guy starts to sweat
[21:49] and get nervous he's wondering what am I
[21:51] going to do now I can't get to that
[21:53] Mouse and if he keeps eating this we're
[21:55] going down
[21:57] and he thought in a thought and he said
[21:59] that thing is still eating at those
[22:00] wires and all of a sudden he has this
[22:02] thought hey
[22:03] I can fly higher than that Mouse
[22:08] I'm built to fly higher
[22:11] than any little creature like that can I
[22:14] get an amen you know what he did he just
[22:17] went way up high until he's seen that
[22:19] Mouse just disintegrate and fall over
[22:21] dead
[22:23] I'm here to tell you this morning as a
[22:24] Believer you're not
[22:27] the world you're not called to
[22:29] addictions you're not called to any
[22:32] addiction you need to fly higher than
[22:34] that
[22:37] God's called you to something higher
[22:40] not because you deserve it but because
[22:43] he gave it to you
[22:45] say you're talking about everybody else
[22:46] in this room I'm sorry brother and
[22:48] sister I'm not talking about everybody
[22:49] else in this room I'm talking about you
[22:54] you're called to something higher
[22:56] we're not a mouse
[22:58] we're not grasshoppers
[23:00] how many remember that
[23:02] we looked like grasshoppers in their
[23:05] sight and in our sight as well you're
[23:09] not a grasshopper you're a son and
[23:10] daughter of God
[23:15] so when Elijah then when he comes to the
[23:18] juniper tree then he comes to the third
[23:20] phase which I read you this morning and
[23:23] he comes Elijah in the cave Mount Carmel
[23:26] the juniper tree and then the cave
[23:29] experiences the part that I'm
[23:31] emphasizing this morning the the cave
[23:34] was the third part of the mystery behind
[23:38] this the cave is the third part of the
[23:41] mystery how many know that three is
[23:43] perfection
[23:45] you will find in your Bible the basis of
[23:49] this number three being a part of the
[23:52] mystery and types throughout your Bible
[23:54] and I could list a bunch of them but
[23:56] this three has a spiritual meaning of of
[23:58] seven is completion but three is
[24:00] perfection so you when you hit the three
[24:02] then you hit a Perfection so in other
[24:05] words it's not in the first phase it's
[24:07] not in the second phase that you hit a
[24:08] Perfection but the third phase is what
[24:10] we're growing into and that's coming to
[24:12] Perfection and the number three means
[24:14] Perfection you'll find it throughout the
[24:16] Bible three means in the Bible means
[24:19] wholeness wholeness
[24:22] and Perfection not just perfection but
[24:24] wholeness
[24:26] Hallelujah
[24:28] it means wholeness how many you want to
[24:30] be whole this morning
[24:33] so you know it was the it was the third
[24:35] angel that came to Abraham with his
[24:38] final promise
[24:43] there was three parts to the Old
[24:45] Testament Tabernacle
[24:48] took three days for Israel to Cross
[24:50] Jordan it took ten to three days before
[24:51] they cross over Jordan Daniel Prayed
[24:54] three times a day
[24:56] Jesus said destroy this Temple and in
[24:59] three days I'll raise it up again
[25:01] and did he do it can you say my
[25:04] it was the third day that the mystery
[25:06] broke it was the third day that it was a
[25:08] Perfection that came
[25:10] I could read you hundreds and more you
[25:12] can look them up yourself the number
[25:13] three has a significance to it Jesus
[25:15] said destroy this Temple Paul was three
[25:17] years in the Arabian Desert until he
[25:19] come out with the mystery to preach the
[25:21] mystery of Christ there's three phrases
[25:23] to the Rapture can you say Amen a shout
[25:26] a voice and a trump
[25:28] the mystery breaks under the three
[25:33] Mount Carmel God gives you power and
[25:37] boldness like he did Elijah
[25:40] the Juniper what is that experience it
[25:42] tells us God will nourish us and sustain
[25:45] us when we are that low because he
[25:48] couldn't sustain himself we learn in the
[25:51] juniper tree that when you can't take
[25:53] care of yourself
[25:55] God will take care of you God will
[25:57] nourish you
[25:59] how many races I've been there done that
[26:01] I know what it feels like that I don't
[26:03] have the strength to go on and God's
[26:06] faithful to me to send me some
[26:08] Supernatural cakes can you say Amen a
[26:10] little bit of water can you say Amen let
[26:13] him sleep it off a little bit rise up
[26:15] take nourishment can you say Amen
[26:17] because we can't even get it for
[26:18] ourselves but we learned under our
[26:20] juniper trees that God will be there and
[26:23] sustain us when we can ourselves we
[26:26] learn in Mount Carmel to be bold and
[26:28] speak the word of God
[26:30] call fire down from heaven if needed
[26:35] Hallelujah
[26:38] but you see now then we come
[26:41] to this third thing
[26:45] it's kind of like two Extremes in our
[26:47] walk must have been two extremes for
[26:49] Elijah
[26:50] to go from a Mount Carmel which is the
[26:52] extreme of something glorious and God
[26:55] vindicating so much you could tell God
[26:58] was there
[27:00] God came and showed up
[27:04] God showed up God brought the fire god
[27:07] proved to the whole world all the nation
[27:10] of Israel this is my Prophet this is him
[27:13] this is God showed up in a a in a big
[27:17] way how many has had that happen in your
[27:19] life
[27:21] and it's it's a wonderful but it's like
[27:23] the two extremes because then you come
[27:24] to the juniper tree and it's the
[27:26] complete opposite and yet God is still
[27:28] there
[27:30] the same God that brought fire down and
[27:33] Vindicated himself to all of Israel now
[27:36] he doesn't need to vindicate himself to
[27:38] all of Israel
[27:39] now he needs to just be a nourishment
[27:42] to his prophet
[27:44] let me tell you friends God loves you so
[27:47] much that the same God that performed
[27:49] the supernatural in in brother branham's
[27:51] life
[27:52] the same God that the men the mighty
[27:54] works with seven times around the world
[27:56] the same God that stood there with him
[27:59] it's the same God who come comes and
[28:02] ministers to you when you need it the
[28:05] most
[28:07] it's not a different God
[28:09] it's the god of Elijah somebody say Amen
[28:11] it's not a different God than William
[28:13] branham's God can you say man it's the
[28:15] same God that was there it's the same
[28:17] God in the juniper trees the same God
[28:19] that answered by fire is the same God
[28:22] that can give you nourishment through
[28:24] the cakes and nourish your soul
[28:27] but there's two extremes and we have
[28:29] that in our lives the mount carmels and
[28:33] the juniper trees it's two extremes and
[28:35] I'm preaching stability to you we will
[28:37] need something more stable than the two
[28:40] extremes
[28:44] we need to move into a more stability
[28:48] than looking for another Mount Carmel
[28:51] to bail us out
[28:53] you know people get nervous about I
[28:56] believe this and people aren't believing
[28:57] me so I need Vindication Lord I need
[28:59] Vindication we gotta we've got to work
[29:01] something out I just I need the whole
[29:02] world to see I need all my office to see
[29:04] and everybody to see everything come and
[29:06] vindicate yourself and and even though
[29:08] this message has been thoroughly
[29:10] completely Vindicated you couldn't
[29:12] vindicate it anymore but listen I always
[29:14] say this the final Vindication is coming
[29:16] someday
[29:18] you're gonna see you're gonna play
[29:20] around with it it doesn't mean anything
[29:21] it's just this prophet's another Pebble
[29:24] on the beach you go right ahead but
[29:26] there's a final Vindication to what this
[29:28] message is and it's coming someday
[29:30] but I'll tell you I don't need that to
[29:33] keep me in
[29:34] because I met the god of Elijah in the
[29:37] juniper trees I met the God on Mount
[29:39] Carmel I've met the God I know he's real
[29:42] can you say Amen my God is Not William
[29:44] Branham my God is not a prophet my God
[29:46] is the Lord Jesus Christ that worked
[29:49] through that prophet
[29:50] foreign
[29:54] praise the Lord I'm getting my second
[29:57] wind here today after that wedding I'm
[29:59] ready to run after the devil this
[30:00] morning if you run after him with me
[30:03] Hallelujah
[30:06] so God is God is bringing his Prophet
[30:09] through this Prophet process but he
[30:12] needs to show his show him the final
[30:14] mystery it's the third one that he must
[30:17] come to and the bride must come to as
[30:20] well he says stand out in front of the
[30:21] cave come out of that cave and stand up
[30:23] on the mount I want to show you
[30:24] something so God calls him to the cave
[30:26] and shows him something he has a secret
[30:28] that he has to pass to Elijah
[30:32] to stabilize things
[30:34] you know one of the things he said when
[30:36] I'm alone loneliness and feeling alone
[30:40] is
[30:41] so prevalent today
[30:44] especially in our teenagers
[30:47] can I say something about it it's not in
[30:49] my notes but can I say the devil taking
[30:52] our teenagers in their loneliness
[30:55] and telling them lies in their minds you
[30:58] don't have a friend in the world you're
[31:01] a part of something that's cause cause
[31:02] you to not have any more friends you're
[31:04] gonna you're different all these other
[31:06] lives of the enemy and he he abuses the
[31:10] loneliness until they turn to other
[31:12] things young person listen to me if you
[31:14] trust me as God's servant God has never
[31:16] left you he'll never leave you and he
[31:19] will provide you the right friends you
[31:22] wait on the Lord he'll provide you the
[31:24] right husband he'll provide you the
[31:26] right wife you wait until you get the
[31:28] right one
[31:31] and don't let Satan take your emotional
[31:33] craving for friendship and provide you
[31:35] with the wrong types of friends wait on
[31:38] the Lord and he'll renew your strength
[31:40] because he loves you that much
[31:43] [Applause]
[31:44] don't draw your identity off a pin
[31:46] Pinterest or some other stupid thing on
[31:49] the internet get into this Bible get
[31:52] into this message and say God show me
[31:54] who I am as a daughter of God
[31:58] Hallelujah
[32:00] and so now this third mystery it's
[32:04] destabilized and to show him because if
[32:07] get this now it's and this is what it is
[32:09] today knowing he's going to show Elijah
[32:12] where I God's saying I'm going to show
[32:13] you where I will be knowing where God is
[32:16] where to find him and Friends listen
[32:19] that's my message this morning showing
[32:21] us where he is and where to find him is
[32:24] everything
[32:28] it's everything
[32:29] why are you saying that why find him at
[32:32] church not always
[32:35] we don't have church every night
[32:38] so what are you going to do Monday
[32:39] through the rest of the week
[32:42] I'd like to have church every night
[32:46] but I might be here by myself I don't
[32:48] know I
[32:50] but you're not in church so so it's not
[32:52] just in church
[32:56] but we're we we have to look at this and
[32:59] we have to see it's essential that we
[33:01] know where God is and where to find him
[33:04] to get a hold of him today
[33:06] this may be so just dirt simple this
[33:10] morning but listen I'm telling you this
[33:11] because we have an enemy that I'm facing
[33:13] even this morning in this service that
[33:16] is distracting the young people and
[33:18] distracting even bride members to cause
[33:21] us to lose value of where God is in the
[33:23] still Small Voice to cause us to fill
[33:25] our lives and make it busy till we don't
[33:28] have time we don't sit still
[33:31] and shut out all the noise
[33:34] so we can hear this still small voice
[33:40] he's saying that it's everything in
[33:42] there and Satan's saying he's doing
[33:44] everything to keep us from it
[33:47] everything to keep us from it
[33:50] I'm looking for answers I'm looking for
[33:51] answers you better know where God is and
[33:53] where to find him
[33:54] he's going to say to Elijah some
[33:56] interesting things here and I don't know
[33:57] how I have time for all these quotes I
[33:59] won't be lengthy today but he's going to
[34:01] say he's going to bring an earthquake
[34:03] and shake up and he's going to bring a
[34:05] win and shake the Rocks off the mountain
[34:06] while he's standing there in the cave
[34:08] he's going to do this he's going to do
[34:09] that and he's going to do all these
[34:11] things and he's going to show him
[34:14] clearly where God is and that's
[34:16] important for you to know every young
[34:18] person every person here every person
[34:19] under the sound of our voice there's a
[34:21] lot of people there's a lot of voices
[34:23] there's a lot of churches there's a lot
[34:25] of things there's a lot of things on
[34:27] social media a lot of presentations of
[34:29] God but listen there's only one voice of
[34:31] Jesus Christ
[34:33] and and you have to say Lord let me find
[34:36] where that voice is let me stay close to
[34:39] it let me shut out the other voices
[34:43] we must know where God is where to find
[34:47] him
[34:48] and what God is in he said see
[34:52] people can say God's in this and God's
[34:54] in that and he's saying Elijah I'm not
[34:57] in the earthquake
[35:01] look at that wind comes
[35:03] all right God's in there God's saying no
[35:06] I'm not I'm not going to be in that
[35:13] I read some quotes out of what hairstyle
[35:15] Elijah last Sunday I'm going to read
[35:16] them three some more now from there and
[35:19] I just would advise you to listen to
[35:21] listen to that message from
[35:22] Jeffersonville
[35:24] what hears thou Elijah because he says
[35:27] things about the the fire and all these
[35:30] things he says things a lot more uh
[35:33] plainer
[35:35] um that I have the time to give this
[35:37] morning but he says if you guys will
[35:38] bring that up I'm catching it in the
[35:40] middle of the sermon when he when it's
[35:42] now it's presented this fire comes
[35:43] before Elijah this earthquake this wind
[35:45] all the great fuss and America is guilty
[35:47] of listening to those noises oh we love
[35:49] me noise but God is not in the noise
[35:52] although as honorable and things as are
[35:54] yet God isn't in noise if that would
[35:56] have been so when the Africans beat the
[35:58] tomtoms you never heard such a noise in
[36:00] Rhythm God wasn't in it and we have
[36:02] rushing Mighty winds we've had all kinds
[36:04] of fires and earthquakes and shakings
[36:05] and great revivals and things like that
[36:07] God wasn't in it if it had been it would
[36:10] have showed itself up but after that see
[36:12] what brother Brown does that that God
[36:14] may have moved in a service but what
[36:16] happens after that what's the results
[36:18] after that and he says for a lot of
[36:21] those revivals in Pentecost he said but
[36:24] after that it says but let me pick it up
[36:27] here if it hadn't it but after that come
[36:29] a still small voice but then God was in
[36:32] the voice that's what I'm thinking today
[36:33] friends we people are so carried away
[36:35] with all the noise so America loves
[36:37] noise look at what we're doing uh they
[36:39] turn off the old radios just as hard as
[36:41] they can with rock and roll and Boogie
[36:43] wigging all this kind of stuff they got
[36:44] to have it so loud it'll Blast Your
[36:46] eardrums out nearly all the noise all
[36:48] the time of the day and in the church we
[36:49] beat the tambourines we run up and down
[36:51] and screamed and hollered and whooped
[36:53] and had a great time like that nothing
[36:55] against it not a thing against it you're
[36:57] not going to scare me if you do that
[36:58] this morning rejoice in the Lord
[37:01] but the promising but where was God in
[37:03] it what did it do broke us up into
[37:05] little pieces called the Assemblies of
[37:07] God the Church of God the Pentecostal
[37:09] United Oneness all these other different
[37:11] little denominations God wasn't in it of
[37:13] all the shouting we've had enough blasts
[37:15] and noise to convert the whole world
[37:16] we've had enough hurray and hollering
[37:18] and carrying on to what it's what's it
[37:20] done it y'all don't get offended at me
[37:22] reading this you can get offended at the
[37:24] word
[37:26] but you shouldn't get offended at the
[37:27] word
[37:28] he's speaking straight to us that we
[37:31] must make sure that God is in something
[37:33] and we must make sure that other things
[37:36] don't replace the still small voice
[37:41] he's pointing to that in the third
[37:43] mystery in Elijah
[37:45] where to find God
[37:49] praise the Lord
[37:52] praise the Lord he's pointing it in the
[37:54] third part of the mystery
[37:58] and so let me finish these
[38:04] hollering carrying on to what it's done
[38:06] it hasn't built the church it's built
[38:07] denominations it's made men go out with
[38:09] puffed up ideas and stuffed shirts I
[38:11] don't like that stuff walk out on the
[38:13] platform and say oh look at him he's a
[38:14] prince look how he's dressed just
[38:16] polished and everything he knows how to
[38:18] make his vows and so forth that ain't
[38:19] what God chooses later on the quote he
[38:21] says what we need tonight is a deep rich
[38:24] experience that something down in US it
[38:27] don't have to shout yet it might shout
[38:29] but we put all the emphasis on shouting
[38:32] it might never speak with tongues yet it
[38:34] might but we put all the emphasis on
[38:36] that it might not it might not attended
[38:39] Billy Graham's meetings or Roberts
[38:40] meetings or my meeting you don't have to
[38:43] what
[38:46] you don't have to
[38:49] if you go and you hear this still Small
[38:51] Voice which which you will in some of
[38:53] those meetings praise the Lord that's
[38:55] what you're going for what is God
[38:57] speaking in that syllable Small Voice to
[38:59] me
[39:01] but you don't have to go
[39:03] he said uh what is it says it might not
[39:07] attended Billy grams you don't have to
[39:09] what it has to have is that depths of
[39:11] God's eternal love that Spirit on the
[39:12] inside and that makes you what you are
[39:14] that's what I was speaking about this
[39:16] morning that's what I was pulling the
[39:18] church across Calvary back and forth
[39:19] don't you think because you spoke with
[39:21] tongues or that you know so much about
[39:23] the scriptures or you read somebody's
[39:25] books or you know so much about the
[39:27] message I'll put that in and you know
[39:28] more than the other fella you see pride
[39:30] comes up you see when we're living just
[39:33] on an emotion then denomination divide
[39:36] comes up all this comes out of it
[39:39] come on friends that's what he's saying
[39:41] I'm about this preacher I'm about that
[39:43] preacher and and and we get shallow of
[39:45] the bubble dances in our experience and
[39:47] we're about this and we're about this
[39:48] other fellow and and and you know uh you
[39:52] know if you if I want to know somebody
[39:55] else's books or I want to read these
[39:57] books and and the the problem is is that
[39:59] now you got a pride that you know more
[40:01] than the other fella
[40:08] you want to be led by the spirit of God
[40:13] be gentle
[40:15] and don't know a whole lot
[40:18] it's a direct quote from the prophet
[40:22] be gentle and not whole know a whole lot
[40:26] and we're we're going to be filled with
[40:28] the intellect and knowledge of God
[40:29] filled with all these things that just
[40:31] don't let it turn into Pride
[40:34] that I know more than the next fella
[40:38] he said put a mark on those who sigh and
[40:40] cry for the Abominations that did in the
[40:42] city who would he Mark in our cities
[40:43] tonight it's the depths of the spirit
[40:46] not the shallowness and I wanted that
[40:49] lay add this into in this part of the
[40:51] quote later on the message he just says
[40:53] and when Elijah heard that still Small
[40:57] Voice nothing bothered him
[41:02] oh
[41:07] wow
[41:09] we only need that sentence to live on
[41:11] can you say man
[41:13] once he comes into God being in the
[41:15] still Small Voice something calmed his
[41:18] nurse something called his mental state
[41:22] nothing bothered him he stabilized
[41:26] by the still small voice
[41:28] once you hear it can you say Amen you
[41:31] see young people you got to quit I can
[41:33] tell when you're listening to country
[41:34] music and rock and roll music and pop
[41:36] music and that's on your phone all the
[41:38] time you're not listening to the still
[41:39] Small Voice because you'll never get
[41:41] that result
[41:43] if you're listening to his voice and
[41:45] really getting it you'll never turn to
[41:47] those things
[41:49] oh okay I'll be like brother Diggs and
[41:52] I'll start sniffing out some more devils
[41:57] you can never defy that country music
[42:00] it's just as perverted as all the rest
[42:03] you're bringing your soul and your
[42:05] spirit through that thinking that's
[42:06] gonna refresh and calm your nerves no
[42:09] it's leading you down a path you don't
[42:11] want to go but if you'll just come and
[42:13] be filled with the spirit of God and
[42:15] start listening to that still Small
[42:17] Voice those voices Fade Out this is
[42:20] greater can you say May
[42:22] I don't need no country artist to go on
[42:25] my nerves I need the Mutombo family to
[42:27] come I need to watch videos of the
[42:29] matambos the lafontaines
[42:32] I need Holy Ghost filled music to calm
[42:35] my nerves
[42:38] amen
[42:40] I need the fight for Ministry because
[42:42] the true faithful Ministry it's not what
[42:44] you see up here it's that still Small
[42:46] Voice that's speaking to you
[42:48] yes it is yes it is
[42:51] this still small voice
[42:53] turn into other things
[42:55] shows you're not listening to still
[42:57] small voice
[42:59] it never leads you in that direction
[43:02] amen can you say Amen
[43:04] and you say ouch then if you can't say
[43:06] Amen
[43:12] uh I'm not taking my coat off because
[43:14] I'm going to preach another hour
[43:19] I'm taking it off because I'm hot
[43:22] that's just it it's just that simple
[43:25] like the ministry takes his watch off
[43:28] and puts it on there and the little kid
[43:29] says why does the minister put the watch
[43:31] up there what purpose in that and the
[43:34] mom said it means nothing absolutely
[43:36] nothing at all
[43:37] doesn't mean anything
[43:45] moving to the mystery of our hour
[43:47] can you can I have 10 more minutes here
[43:49] now
[43:51] the breach the breach is how he named it
[43:54] the breach
[43:55] between the church ages and the seals
[43:59] okay this is what he preached before the
[44:01] seals the breach what's that breach mean
[44:03] a breach means a a gap or a break in a
[44:08] wall
[44:09] in a barrier
[44:11] so if we're applying this now when we
[44:13] come to the end time there was there was
[44:16] a wall there was a barrier between the
[44:18] church ages and the seals but we had to
[44:21] get to the seals because there was
[44:22] something further in there that we
[44:24] needed
[44:26] even though we were Christians even
[44:28] though Calvary washed away our sins even
[44:31] though that when he spoke it is finished
[44:32] on the cross it was finished but yet we
[44:35] when we're born and received the Holy
[44:37] Ghost there's something there's a
[44:38] barrier yet there's a there's something
[44:40] we still need to get to in the end time
[44:43] amen so our lamb our lamb Jesus Christ
[44:46] went 2 000 years ago and he paid the
[44:48] price of redemption he finishes paying
[44:51] the price how many believe that this
[44:52] morning our land I call it my lamb my
[44:55] lamb I'm nothing without my lamb and he
[44:58] went two thousand years ago and he paid
[45:01] the price he he saved us but even with
[45:04] that there's still a barrier there's
[45:06] still a barrier at the end time what is
[45:08] it what is the barrier what's going to
[45:11] pop up now well in Revelations 5 our
[45:14] lamb is going to come again we know
[45:15] there was one walking in the midst of
[45:17] the seven golden candlesticks we know
[45:18] there was seven Messengers and Angels
[45:20] through the church ages those Messengers
[45:22] were used of God for each days to bring
[45:24] the word for the age but our there was
[45:26] one like the son of man walking in the
[45:27] midst of the candlesticks so he was
[45:29] there as Son of God throughout the
[45:31] church ages he was there anointing these
[45:33] men
[45:34] but at the end our lamb shows up again
[45:37] in Revelations 5 in a symbol
[45:40] of what he's got to do now so our land
[45:42] we ought to be happy just with that is
[45:44] that our land went to Calvary but
[45:46] there's still a barrier for something
[45:48] for us and so who has to show up to
[45:50] break make a breach
[45:52] a breach in the barrier
[45:55] who shows up nobody else could show up
[45:57] but the lamb
[46:00] your lamb shows up at the end time
[46:04] because he's gonna take this barrier and
[46:07] he's got to break through and the the
[46:09] way that he so so now what is it will
[46:12] you just bear with me now the book what
[46:15] is it it's the book of redemption
[46:18] it's the book of redemption
[46:20] it's the title deed
[46:22] it's the book
[46:24] that went back in the hands of the
[46:26] original owner it's the inheritance it's
[46:28] it's the book that has our name on it
[46:31] it's you know what the book is it's all
[46:33] about you
[46:34] the book is Christ and you are the words
[46:37] in the book
[46:40] so the barrier is is that the original
[46:43] owner has the book but the book has not
[46:45] been handed back to the people it's
[46:47] owned by
[46:50] the barrier is is we may have been saved
[46:53] and filled with the Holy Spirit through
[46:55] the church ages but there's still a
[46:57] barrier because this book is everything
[47:00] because it's it's all about you and who
[47:03] you are not your first birth
[47:07] but your second birth and your real
[47:10] identity can you say Amen before you sin
[47:13] before sin came in the picture before
[47:15] anything listen I'll just go ahead and
[47:16] tell you you tell me if you could look
[47:19] at this book
[47:20] and he could reveal to this to you the
[47:22] secret that's in this book of your name
[47:25] I ask you wouldn't that be the most
[47:27] stabilizing thing that you would ever
[47:29] have in your life
[47:31] this book
[47:33] would be the most stabilizing thing in
[47:35] your life this book would stabilize
[47:37] everything
[47:39] this book is bigger it's greater knowing
[47:42] what's in that book is greater than your
[47:44] trouble than your trauma than your
[47:46] family dysfunction than your past
[47:48] hallelujah it's greater than all of that
[47:51] that's why he had to get this book
[47:54] to people again
[47:59] see why are you preaching this way
[48:01] because I'm preaching on the still small
[48:03] voice
[48:06] and I'm preaching on where to find he's
[48:08] what he's what is he going to be
[48:10] speaking through because I got to find
[48:11] where he's at and what he's speaking
[48:13] through and what he's using
[48:14] in order to hear what he's going to
[48:17] speak out of that book
[48:19] oh glory be to God
[48:24] if he could start speaking in that still
[48:25] Small Voice what's in that book wouldn't
[48:27] it fill every need of your life
[48:30] how powerful is it I can't describe how
[48:32] powerful it is I know the prophet said
[48:34] when the lamb took the book it was the
[48:35] most Sublime things in this it was the
[48:38] most Sublime thing in the scripture
[48:41] Revelations 5 you have it in your Bible
[48:43] the most Sublime act in the scripture is
[48:47] when that book was in the hands of the
[48:48] original owner and in the symbol and in
[48:51] the
[48:51] in the vision
[48:54] it's not in the hands of the original it
[48:56] comes into the hand of our lamb and it's
[48:59] got it and it's and so then it's sealed
[49:02] up nobody could unseal it nobody's
[49:04] worthy and so he takes it the most
[49:07] Sublime thing in the scripture for your
[49:09] life
[49:11] what am I doing this morning I'm calming
[49:13] your nerves
[49:16] I've got the ultimate cure here this
[49:18] morning
[49:20] I'm I'm carrying your problems
[49:23] because in that book there are no
[49:25] problems
[49:27] in your identity can you say Amen
[49:30] there is nothing lacking in that
[49:33] every emotional need you have every
[49:35] Deliverance you need everything is when
[49:38] you start hearing what's in that book
[49:44] what was the breach
[49:46] what was the break in the barrier what
[49:48] broke it what was the blast that broke
[49:51] the hole in the barrier as Revelations
[49:53] find our lamb two thousand years 2000
[49:55] years later he takes this book
[49:58] and just the fact he took it should make
[50:00] us happy
[50:01] that this this book of redemption
[50:06] he said why are you preaching this
[50:08] because
[50:12] Satan
[50:14] has misinterpreted
[50:17] what this message is
[50:22] to where people lose the value of it
[50:26] or they say that's just the man with the
[50:28] seventh grade education he's another
[50:30] Pebble in the breach I'm not preaching
[50:32] the man William ran him to you
[50:35] I'm preaching what he directed what God
[50:38] directed us to like Elijah where will I
[50:41] find that still small voice
[50:46] where will I find the source
[50:52] he's he's caused people to
[50:55] um
[50:58] he's caused people to say it's out of
[51:00] date
[51:02] it's old
[51:04] it's it's not significant to the needs
[51:06] that are now
[51:11] some of the vision dates were wrong
[51:14] come on
[51:16] preacher
[51:17] and there's some mistakes
[51:20] yeah there were there were
[51:24] no I've never not admitted and that's I
[51:26] come across those things okay that date
[51:28] doesn't match this date or whatever you
[51:30] know
[51:31] and then I went to my Bible and I
[51:33] studied all the prophets of the Bible
[51:34] and I seen their mistakes
[51:38] so now there's there's no end to this
[51:39] because there's no end of this because
[51:42] now you start if you're looking with
[51:43] this carnal mind with the reasoning is a
[51:46] powerful Realm
[51:47] and you start looking at through that
[51:49] channel now you take your Bible and
[51:51] you'll talk yourself out of every
[51:53] prophet of the Bible
[51:55] and you'll talk yourself out of Jesus
[51:57] Christ being the Lamb of God
[52:00] because God never said this so you can
[52:02] figure it all out up here
[52:12] this is Vision quoted over and over
[52:15] again you know that spoke something to
[52:19] I said this a few months ago I said a
[52:22] couple years ago too in some of these
[52:24] attacks came I didn't expect to say this
[52:26] this morning but when these attacks came
[52:28] it's like what's the devil doing here
[52:30] I'm always thinking you know and you
[52:32] know why I I'm here you know why I have
[52:35] the value in it because
[52:37] I've connected with the still small
[52:39] voice of Jesus Christ
[52:42] I would never leave that
[52:45] in that message it was not a man to me
[52:48] it wasn't the seventh angel to me there
[52:51] was a voice within the voice
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:57] and that's not William Branham that's my
[53:00] lamb that's Jesus Christ I found him
[53:04] [Applause]
[53:07] and brother Ram talks about that you
[53:09] know you look at those pictures you
[53:10] can't make out what's in there you know
[53:12] it's all a mess and then he says then
[53:14] it's put together but if you keep
[53:15] looking at it he says once you see
[53:17] what's in the image of the picture I
[53:19] think brother rap did one a few months
[53:21] ago and so once you see it then you
[53:22] can't see nothing else and then he calls
[53:24] he says once you see Christ the message
[53:27] all the rest of it just Fades out
[53:30] I don't have to have every date perfect
[53:32] because he said Elijah Elijah said
[53:36] directed me to the lamb
[53:39] I'm living on the still small voice and
[53:42] it doesn't need to be any more
[53:43] complicated than that
[53:49] but because he says
[53:52] and I was going to finish the story
[53:54] about there was someone said this Billy
[53:56] Paul's standing there at the May Company
[53:58] in California he said Billy Paul before
[54:00] you're an old man there'll be sharks
[54:02] swimming here around this may company
[54:04] so now I'm just making a point here now
[54:06] for all of us is that God doesn't leave
[54:09] it up to us to interpret his visions
[54:12] he interprets them by bringing in the
[54:14] past
[54:15] who puts himself in a position to start
[54:17] interpreting these things when it's
[54:19] happened to it you know I don't know I'm
[54:22] not a prophet but there was a comment
[54:24] made by a minister that since he said
[54:26] that to Billy Paul there's been several
[54:29] times that they had a flood near that
[54:32] may company and they have pictures in
[54:34] the news
[54:36] of sharks swimming through that May
[54:38] Company already
[54:41] so once again I'm not interpreting but
[54:44] if we just say that's still coming it's
[54:46] still coming Billy Paul before your name
[54:48] before you're an old man you're you can
[54:51] interpret that
[54:52] it may have already taken place
[54:58] oh boy I should have stayed up there and
[55:01] it should have stuck with my notes I was
[55:03] doing better
[55:04] get back up here JP
[55:07] stand right here and stick with your
[55:09] notes
[55:13] come on now
[55:16] I thought this was a note that my tie
[55:18] was cricket
[55:23] thank you Brandon
[55:28] I I just said that to say listen listen
[55:31] this is not to be figured out up here
[55:33] and it's not to be devalued by the enemy
[55:35] for him to cause you to not listen to
[55:38] and not feed on
[55:41] shouldn't be feeding on all this other
[55:43] stuff you feed on the thing that has the
[55:45] still Small Voice in it
[55:47] we're in the last days we're about to
[55:49] ready to get out of here
[55:50] is this important this is the most
[55:52] important thing in life that I am
[55:53] connected with this no Small Voice every
[55:55] teenager in this room to say there's
[55:57] nothing more important a husband wife
[55:59] nothing is more important than me
[56:01] connecting with his voice for my life
[56:03] and obeying it and listening to it
[56:06] but Satan destroys the value of where
[56:09] the sources of if I'm preaching the
[56:11] message that came through that seventh
[56:12] angel then he could have his still small
[56:14] voice speaking through my voice this
[56:16] morning to you are you listening are you
[56:18] catching it what's he saying to you that
[56:21] will be your stability in this hour
[56:25] it'll tell you how to live it'll direct
[56:28] you every day it'll tell you what career
[56:29] to have
[56:31] it'll tell you principles of Life
[56:32] sisters that'll tell you how to dress
[56:34] like a Godly woman
[56:36] you won't get that voice in any other
[56:37] thing even the denominations you won't
[56:39] get it but in the word and it's still
[56:41] Small Voice he's so loving to you he'll
[56:43] tell you what to wear Brothers he'll
[56:44] tell you what to wear and that does not
[56:46] include long hair Brothers
[56:50] praise the Lord boy I just get myself in
[56:52] all kinds of trouble here
[56:57] breach
[56:58] was the blast that broke the hole in the
[57:01] barrier and that was our lamb came now
[57:03] and our the book the book the book
[57:06] is in the hands and then he strips off
[57:08] he he he he he's holding the book and he
[57:12] begins to peel off
[57:14] he he takes the book we all should
[57:17] already be shouting that the book is
[57:19] back in the hands of our lamb
[57:22] this is this book is everything
[57:24] it's who you are it's everything
[57:26] you say what are you talking about I'm
[57:27] talking about events that's already
[57:28] taking place in our generation
[57:31] but I'm bringing it to our lamb had our
[57:33] Christ had it and he peels off Seven
[57:36] Seals seven Mysteries that held the
[57:38] contents in the book he stands there and
[57:40] he peels them off and he breaks them
[57:43] guess what that's what it says in
[57:44] Revelation said now what happens when he
[57:46] comes to do it he comes down to
[57:48] Revelation 10 now he's peeled he's got
[57:50] the seals off and so he's going to come
[57:52] down and descend Christ our covenant
[57:55] angel
[57:56] and the Bible says he comes down with
[57:58] the book open
[58:02] because in Revelations 5 is it sealed he
[58:04] tears the seal off now he comes down now
[58:06] what does he do next
[58:07] he cries out
[58:10] seven Thunders come
[58:12] and then it says the seven Thunders
[58:14] uttered their
[58:16] voice
[58:18] so don't complicate it what's going to
[58:20] happen he's going to speak something
[58:24] oh thank the Lord
[58:26] thank the lord it's not going to be some
[58:28] hidden thing in a cloud somewhere
[58:30] it's going to speak
[58:34] and then he asks well is our Lord going
[58:36] to speak it how is he going to speak it
[58:38] in our own language and bring it how
[58:39] it's going to start blasting those
[58:41] things for us to us and and how's he
[58:44] going to do it well the answer is in the
[58:46] Bible over in Revelations 10 Revelations
[58:49] 10 7 now this Angel comes he's black
[58:53] he's speaking something he's bursting
[58:55] forth with the contents of this book
[58:58] and
[58:59] win win win who win Revelations 10 7. in
[59:04] the days of the voice of the
[59:07] Sabbath is completion one of those Angel
[59:09] Messengers what are those Stars
[59:12] see brother Paul I already know these
[59:14] things well listen to it again say Amen
[59:15] again
[59:16] I'm saying because our young people
[59:18] don't know that this message and what
[59:21] God did in this duration what he's doing
[59:22] now is right in this Bible
[59:25] you don't have to file a denominational
[59:27] Creed or someone's interpretation it's
[59:29] happening right now when he says the
[59:31] seventh angel he had seven Messengers
[59:33] seven angels in the right hand Paul
[59:35] arenius brother raps going through it on
[59:37] Wednesday nights Paul renius gets the
[59:39] final seventh Angels who's the seven
[59:40] well that's everything who's the seventh
[59:42] one I believe I know who he is
[59:44] I believe I know who Malachi 45 is
[59:47] there's no doubt in my mind I know
[59:48] that's already settled but what's the
[59:51] important thing not so much that that
[59:52] it's him but it's what is he going to
[59:54] speak and he says how am I going to
[59:56] blast forth all this I'm going to use
[59:58] the seventh angel because he's on Earth
[1:00:00] right now and I'm going to blast those
[1:00:02] things through his voice
[1:00:05] and once it bursts forth
[1:00:07] it's just going to keep
[1:00:09] speaking and speaking and speaking and
[1:00:12] there will be a little bride that said
[1:00:17] I hear a voice
[1:00:23] I'm learning God isn't always in the
[1:00:26] earthquake in the Wind
[1:00:30] I'm learning and stabilizing in a
[1:00:31] Christian that I might shout my shoes
[1:00:33] off
[1:00:35] but if I didn't have the still Small
[1:00:36] Voice to speak to me
[1:00:38] I stay shallow
[1:00:44] I'm going to bring it in that seventh
[1:00:45] angel but guess what
[1:00:48] there's no there's not just seven verses
[1:00:51] to Revelations ten there's four more
[1:00:54] did you know that
[1:00:56] because if there's only seven verses
[1:00:57] then we all capitalize around the
[1:00:59] seventh angel
[1:01:00] and that's the emphasis
[1:01:03] talk about the Seven Nation talk about
[1:01:05] his stories talk about what God did
[1:01:07] through him bring him back just play him
[1:01:09] all due respect
[1:01:12] there's not just seven verses in
[1:01:14] Revelations 10. there's four more verses
[1:01:17] and when the seventh angel is done and
[1:01:19] he speaks the mystery of God should be
[1:01:21] finished the secret the secret will be
[1:01:24] finished
[1:01:26] speak it and in that
[1:01:28] you find this still Small Voice what did
[1:01:30] he say in the last four verses well
[1:01:32] another voice spoke again to John who's
[1:01:36] a type of the Bride when the seventh
[1:01:38] angel was done
[1:01:41] what did he say to do
[1:01:44] anybody know
[1:01:46] you should know what those verses say
[1:01:47] we're living in them right now
[1:01:49] what did he say to do
[1:01:51] now that this voice speaking this
[1:01:54] mystery to you
[1:01:56] take this book
[1:01:59] take this book
[1:02:02] and feed on it
[1:02:07] feed on it
[1:02:09] eat it
[1:02:12] spiritually eat
[1:02:15] and when you get to 2023 and you're
[1:02:17] feeding on all kinds of other things
[1:02:20] the voice of the Lord says stop feeding
[1:02:23] on everything else
[1:02:25] get a hold of this book marriages
[1:02:27] families singles
[1:02:31] wives husbands
[1:02:33] get a hold of this
[1:02:35] and eat it
[1:02:38] and let him speak to you
[1:02:43] bring that last quote up so when he
[1:02:46] comes to Christ the mystery
[1:02:48] he says this at the end of it Christ The
[1:02:50] Mystery of God revealed
[1:02:53] the next one
[1:02:57] next quote is there any more
[1:03:02] okay I'll go up here and read it was
[1:03:04] there another quote
[1:03:06] okay
[1:03:07] it says at the end
[1:03:10] all this mystery
[1:03:13] is revealed everybody still like me
[1:03:16] if you disagree fine just still like me
[1:03:18] please
[1:03:22] it doesn't end with seven verses it ends
[1:03:24] with 11 verses
[1:03:26] doesn't end with the seven angel
[1:03:31] it's the bride
[1:03:33] feeding on the right thing
[1:03:36] how are we going to get out of here
[1:03:37] we're going to eat our way out
[1:03:41] we're going to eat our way out
[1:03:44] and I like that idea
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:50] praise the Lord God is good I'm pointing
[1:03:54] you to the source can you say Amen don't
[1:03:56] let the devil devalue the source for
[1:03:59] your life even for stability mental
[1:04:02] emotional spiritual can you say about
[1:04:05] that's why I read that to you last
[1:04:07] Sunday in in Luke 21 he says there will
[1:04:09] be distress of Nations there'll be men's
[1:04:11] Hearts failing for fear there'll be wars
[1:04:14] and rumors of wars there'll be all this
[1:04:16] distress all this pressure come on you
[1:04:18] and Jesus describes our age perfectly
[1:04:21] and then he says Heaven and Earth will
[1:04:23] pass away he says you'll watch
[1:04:26] everything pass away you'll watch
[1:04:28] everything crumble corruption sets up in
[1:04:30] all things
[1:04:31] no identity left
[1:04:34] knocking at our door trying to get us to
[1:04:36] accept a trans
[1:04:37] it's crazy it's Insanity can you say
[1:04:40] amen I have an article that he pegs it
[1:04:42] one of the presidential presidential
[1:04:44] candidates Vic is his name I think he
[1:04:47] pegs and he's not afraid to do it they
[1:04:48] have signs to show this is a this is a
[1:04:51] problem with the mind of how someone's
[1:04:52] thinking it's insanity and my Prophet
[1:04:54] said it'll be completely totally insane
[1:04:57] people won't think with a sound mind
[1:04:59] anymore
[1:05:00] and we have to deal with it I'm I'm
[1:05:02] going in Home Depot I go back to get
[1:05:04] some stuff and this person comes up like
[1:05:06] this and and the way she talks I said
[1:05:08] she said can I help you and I said yes
[1:05:11] ma'am and I said ma'am to her and she
[1:05:13] gets offended
[1:05:16] because I really couldn't figure out
[1:05:18] what it was
[1:05:21] and in the same store 10 minutes later I
[1:05:23] go up front and I'm having a person help
[1:05:25] my wife and he's a he's a nice
[1:05:28] ah
[1:05:30] he's a nice guy and he's helping us and
[1:05:32] he's polite and all that and he's
[1:05:34] helping and I said to my wife said this
[1:05:37] man's going to help us and he starts
[1:05:38] helping he says and by the way I'm a
[1:05:39] girl
[1:05:41] I felt I'm sorry I didn't realize
[1:05:45] can't tell
[1:05:46] and if you could tell then they get mad
[1:05:48] at you because no I'm not that anymore
[1:05:50] I'm something else now
[1:05:55] brothers and sisters listen well young
[1:05:58] people listen to me trust me as your
[1:06:00] servant this is not going to get any
[1:06:01] better these are spirits these aren't
[1:06:04] just people it's not that person
[1:06:06] they'd open their heart a little bit I'd
[1:06:08] Point them to the source of Deliverance
[1:06:11] we should love them can you say Amen
[1:06:13] this is the world we live in we're not
[1:06:15] going to get around it and it brings
[1:06:17] pressure it brings instability our
[1:06:19] spirit is troubled but thank God he says
[1:06:22] you'll want the same generation to watch
[1:06:24] Heaven and Earth pass away
[1:06:27] it'll pass away in front of your eyes
[1:06:29] but the word
[1:06:30] will stand forever he pointed us to the
[1:06:34] thing in the midst of that distrust he
[1:06:36] says you'll watch something that will
[1:06:37] never corrupt can you say Amen it'll
[1:06:40] never pass away it's Eternal it's stable
[1:06:42] it stays the same if that's true that's
[1:06:45] our source let's stay in it let's feed
[1:06:47] on it
[1:06:49] let's pull away from other voices I'm if

[1:09:55] of praise for the voice of God he said
[1:09:58] to us
[1:10:04] it's the father why do you hunger why do
[1:10:06] you thirst and then you take a thirst
[1:10:08] and you try to fill it with other things
[1:10:10] and all the while he's trying to bring
[1:10:13] you the thing that you need and he says
[1:10:15] he's trying to get this hidden secret to
[1:10:18] you Elijah
[1:10:20] I want to show you
[1:10:22] he's not I'm not in the earthquake I'm
[1:10:25] not in the Wind
[1:10:27] all those things are fine I'm not in the
[1:10:29] fire but you'll find me you'll find me
[1:10:32] isn't it important we find where he's at
[1:10:34] boy we better find where he's at for our
[1:10:36] lives you'll find me in that still small
[1:10:39] voice of the word
[1:10:40] it's it's in
[1:10:43] it's in there oh I love the Lord so much
[1:10:46] I love him so much
[1:10:48] the mystery the whole thing and it's not
[1:10:51] complicated just trying to get it to you
[1:10:53] to to to bring us a Rapture but to bring
[1:10:56] a stability in our times we live in
[1:10:58] mental emotional stability spiritual
[1:11:01] stability we won't make it without it we
[1:11:04] can't go through the trauma and family
[1:11:05] dysfunction and all these things going
[1:11:07] on we won't make it through this without
[1:11:09] the stability of the word in our lives
[1:11:11] it's the word that he's put in place for
[1:11:14] us and if we get to the moment I notice
[1:11:17] that as a Christian I just get just a
[1:11:19] few days away from it filling with other
[1:11:21] things too much away from it and I can
[1:11:23] feel my spirit getting shaky
[1:11:25] can anybody else raise your hand I don't
[1:11:28] know what you're feeling if you don't
[1:11:29] feel that but if you get away from that
[1:11:31] Source far enough you should start
[1:11:33] feeling I'm feeling shaky I'm feeling
[1:11:35] nervous I'm feeling but then I come back
[1:11:38] I've been doing it for whatever I've
[1:11:40] been serving the lord I come back to
[1:11:42] that and it just meditations the Lord
[1:11:44] speak to me something and then that
[1:11:46] voice of comfort
[1:11:48] that voice of stability
[1:11:50] a voice of answers this is what you
[1:11:53] should do
[1:11:55] it's noisy around our world it's noisy
[1:11:57] Our Lives full of noise so if he called
[1:12:00] this the still Small Voice we're going
[1:12:01] to have to really settle down
[1:12:04] and shut everything else out
[1:12:06] so I could say what is he trying to tell
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:09] what is he trying to tell me when he
[1:12:11] says your wife can get in the way or
[1:12:12] your children then brother
[1:12:15] you may have to do this and you won't
[1:12:17] have your wife on board for a while
[1:12:20] hopefully you're in a marriage where the
[1:12:22] wife is on board said I need to do that
[1:12:23] this is an individual thing
[1:12:26] this is not an emotional dependency on
[1:12:28] somebody else
[1:12:30] if they'll do it first
[1:12:33] well if I see a Revival break out in the
[1:12:35] church then I'll do it brother Ram says
[1:12:36] don't wait for the church to have
[1:12:38] Revival have it within yourself and
[1:12:40] it'll break out other places
[1:12:42] you don't wait you don't wait until
[1:12:44] something happens to somebody else you
[1:12:46] don't wait for the next big convention
[1:12:47] the next big camp meeting young people
