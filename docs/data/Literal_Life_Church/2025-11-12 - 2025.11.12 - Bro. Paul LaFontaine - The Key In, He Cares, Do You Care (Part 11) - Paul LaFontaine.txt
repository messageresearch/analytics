[singing] We [music] say amen. Amen and amen and amen. Praise be to God. God bless you tonight. If you get your Bibles, we're going to turn in our lesson and word tonight in 1 John chapter 1. God richly bless you all. We appreciate you lifting us up in prayers. We uh had a a wonderful time once again. Another youth camp with about 60 70 young people that were kind of new to me and from different places around the world, Pennsylvania there. And u the Lord really moved in a a really nice way with each of them and I appreciated their confession and their response back and reflections to the word. Um I always enjoy it's um it's really something just between us tonight and the whole world on the internet. But anyway, uh it's really funny. Funny, I just told my wife, I said, "It's funny. I've been getting invited to some of these youth camps again. I thought my days were over with that, but I said, "Maybe God still has something for me to say to the young people other places." And so, we've done two and we have another one in January in Costa Rica, another youth camp. And but I walked in my uh into my bedroom bringing my luggage in Monday, and I appreciate your prayers. I I was surprised I got home with all the delays, but I got right through both flights. So, um, walked in and this pastor from Maitius called me and said, "Uh, we we would like you to come to a youth camp here." And I didn't know where Maitius was. You're all laughing because you knew where it is. I don't know where it's at, but it's a little place the size of New Jersey, an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. My first response, "Oh, no. I ain't going there. No way. That ain't going to happen." Uh, but I just I thank the Lord. I don't know if I can do the big trips like that anymore, but I have to mind the Lord, you know, whatever he wants. But I just appreciate that we able to say something and encourage our young people here and young people around the world. There was so many um just responsive and we're glad. Then I got to preach in the Bronx on Sunday night at brother Ivon Kerion's house. That was his h um the house of God there in in uh inner uh Bronx. And so that was a very interesting time and we we had a lovely congregation. There's about 150 there just uh getting right behind the word of God. So, we appreciate that that God's got little lighouses everywhere. I'm just glad brother Ivonne is there and I'm here today in Petersburg. Uh God's a special calling on that man. That's for sure. Praise the Lord. First John chapter 1, God bless y'all. I want to continue to remember brother Doug come through this uh procedure and we I'm sure he's listening tonight. God bless you, brother Doug. We're lifting you up in our prayers. And those other ones that are sick tonight that were mentioned, we want to remember them on our hearts as well. First John chapter 1 and verse 5, continuing [clears throat] on with our uh study and he cares. Do you care? If you have a chance to uh listen to that, uh we ask you to do it and that way you could be coming along with us where we're at and we'll move along in the message. It should be this this Wednesday and maybe next Wednesday we'd be able to finish up. 1 John chapter 1 and verse 5. This then is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. Now, can you imagine somebody? Now, this is somebody that's kind of living in between because they're saying they're in fellowship with him, but they're living or walking in darkness. That doesn't go together. Um John is saying that doesn't work right. You can't live in a state of darkness or live uh outside of the light in your life and your walk with God and then be confessing or saying that you're in fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; If we walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanseth us from all sin. the power and the results of the blood of Jesus Christ come in effect into our life by walking in the light. Can you say amen? If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. So um that's uh the only way that the bride can say she's sinless is because through the blood of Jesus Christ. That's the only way he sees us. But on our level, we're are we should never be saying that we don't have any sin in the sense of in these bodies or we are deceiving ourselves. Amen. So the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, no notice the power of confession. Now he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; But it doesn't stop there. If we conf look at the power of confession now, if we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all righteous unrighteousness. So everybody say all. &gt;&gt; All. &gt;&gt; How powerful is this? &gt;&gt; How powerful is this? Doesn't just stop at forgiving your sins, but it's able to provide the flow of the washing from the Lord. the washing &gt;&gt; that would cleanse us from all unrighteousness and all pretty much covers everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't have specific things. It's just the big stuff. It's the little stuff. It's the big stuff. All unrighteousness, that's the power of the blood in our lives. And how does it work? By our confession. &gt;&gt; If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. Praise the Lord. God, may you bless the reading of your word tonight. And God bless you all as you take your seats. Last time we uh were talking about this a couple Wednesdays ago in studying the next section of He Cares, Do You Care? Uh we seen that the prophet was drawing a real contrast between science and education and the things of the world and the world and he was drawing a contrast between science, education, the world and the provided way for the people of God in order to get help. So he's drawing that distinction really far. And the thing about education that we learn in science and these uh feeding off the tree of knowledge of good and evil and feeding on the things of the world, we realize that some of the things of education may sound good initially. It it may seem like it's going to help and and and let me say this, some things do help. The problem with following that path is that it ignores God. It ignores the provided way God's provided. And if we ignore that, then we find that education will lead us down a road in science that will make us want to deny God and say, "Hey, I really didn't need God to be I don't need his provider way. I don't need his blood. I don't need his healing." And that's the problem with following that tree and following that thing. But brother Brandham draws a big distinction in the two because he says God has a provided way for his people to get their help. He's a very present help in the time of trouble. He is able to meet needs that we wouldn't even think that he's able to meet. God is able to answer in every situation and help in time of need. Whatever it may be, never underestimate what God can help in and what God wants to care in and what he wants to do. Whether it's your financial situation or emotional, whatever it is, never put God out of it and say, "This isn't in his category. I'm going to have to go see somebody about this." Let's bring God in first. And let's never uh limit God to him being able. He just said in the scripture that he's able to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So that's pretty far powerful. So education and science and all these things these elements are are forces in the world. Now then they've weaved their way into Christianity. So it's not just the world now that those and brother Brand brings this out. You'll see it in the message. Now they've kind of weaved their way into Christianity to once again try to replace the real Holy Ghost connection with God. So even the church world buys into education and buys into too much of this stuff until they don't catch it. But the intent is Satan getting into Christianity to try to replace a real salvation, a real true Holy Ghost experience that God can really bring satis satisfaction to that individual. And he refers to an intellectual conception of the word. It will never be enough an intellectual conception of the word. Whether it's today in the message or 20 years ago or 100 years ago, we don't want to follow the path of just having an intellectual conception of the word because it'll never be enough to bring total deliverance. &gt;&gt; And he's drawing that distinction. Uh growing up around the message is good. Growing up in a Christian home is good, but it's not going to be enough in the day we live in. It's not going to be enough. Can you say amen? Education won't be enough. Education in the word won't be enough. It's wonderful. We train here. We train the children. We should do that. But at the end of the day, all of that's good and God can use it, but it's not going to be enough to fight the demons that we have today. It's going to take the God's provided way that every person has to come. Amen. So now they the world will present that they have the answer. And so if you've got a problem, they have the answer. They have a path to go down. They have a way that's we read the scripture a couple weeks ago. There's a way that seemth right unto a man, but the end thereof is destruction. So they always have an answer. They always have a way. But many times it's without God in it. Uh it won't allow God in it. And most of the time it will draw us away from more and more further away than from God's true answer uh away from the way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll draw us away from the way, the one and only way, the provided way. And brother Brandham says it. He says, God has a provided way for everything. And God has a provided way in every generation for the people to come to. &gt;&gt; You just got to find that way. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then science and education, they'll try to replace the way for that hour. But there's a path in Noah's day. There was a way. He provided a prophet. And then in under destructions, which I want to get into this next Wednesday night because he gets into it at the end of the sermon, is that that's the beautiful thing about God caring is that even people under judgments of God, how many knows I've been preaching about Josiah and Josiah rose in a revival, a personal revival. Even though the the prophet has said, "If I I'm still going to judge God's people, but because of your repentance and your tears and your brokenness, I'm going to give a revival during your time." So, the power of the power of repentance and the power of coming God's way is in Noah's day. He said Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. And the people who listened to him, they didn't come under the judgments. They were able to come into the ark because the ark was what God provided in that day. And in every generation, God has a provided way to come. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm glad he provided a way in this hour. &gt;&gt; This is when we really needed it. &gt;&gt; This is when we needed a God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; When it gets AS BAD AS THIS, I'M SO GLAD HE provided a way for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, uh, we have to realize we have to come, we the world takes us away from his way. But if we come God's way for any question or any need, we begin to open the window of him responding and stepping in with his power, with his grace, and God being stirred up, as it were. God being uh uh God being uh pleased, whatever what word you want to use, there's a certain way that we come to God that it pleases God. And when God is pleased, I keep referring back to the temple when Solomon and them build it and everything was in shape and everything was in order and the musicians everything in place and there was no idolatry around. It was a perfect situation and God just breathed it in. was so God was so pleased with the temple and the order and everything in place that just something spilled out of his whole being and he poured his glory into that temple that the place was just saturated with the glory of God until the minister couldn't preach. &gt;&gt; Now you apply that to your temple and say could God fill me with that much of his glory. &gt;&gt; But it's when the temple's in the right condition and we'll speak on that more this Sunday. we'll get into a little bit deeper. So now um God can as you uh come his way, it opens up a window of him to respond and step in and show that he cares in every situation. So now you might say, "Well, prayer is the answer." And when you don't have anything else to do, we pray. So prayer is the answer. And I agree with that. But I just wanted to put just just a little color around that is that we can't just say prayer is the answer. A lot of people pray, but it's not just that you pray. It's what you're saying in your prayer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's the it's the faith behind your prayer. There's a lot of people that pray to God. &gt;&gt; And a lot of them in emergency situations. &gt;&gt; So, I'm beginning to see that it's it's it's not just that we pray. It's what you're saying in your prayer. It's what you're confessing in your prayer. It's what's behind your prayer. Is real faith behind your prayer? Is it a prayer? Because we can quickly just say, "Well, just pray what we need to pray. Let's just pray." And so, it just becomes words. But prayer is enhanced. There's a substance to our prayer. Number one, it's faith. &gt;&gt; And when you pray with your lips AND YOU HAVE NO FAITH, GOD KNOWS IT. &gt;&gt; God works OFF OF YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; GOD WORKS FROM WHERE YOUR HEART IS AND IN YOUR PRAYER. So he knows words that you're just mincing words and you're trying to impress God or whatever is with your prayer. That's not what the kind of prayer we bring. It's from the SUBSTANCE OF WHAT'S INSIDE OF US. Then we speak it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so our prayer is has to have faith behind it. It is a prayer uh it is a prayer that is wonderful. But if you had a beautiful prayer and you were holding hold on now hold on to your seat belts. We don't have any seat belts here but hold on to them. If it it could be a wonderful prayer, but holding a grudge against someone else, there's a problem with that prayer. And Jesus taught us that. &gt;&gt; So, it can be the most beautiful prayer to impress everybody, even if it's in front of everybody. And Jesus said, "But if you have ought against someone, if there's a grudge in your heart, Jesus spoke of that." He said, "Go make it to your brother right first." &gt;&gt; Why is he saying that? Because it's not just that you pray. There's a substance behind it. And when the substance is there, then you pray, then you confess. Now you're going to get results. &gt;&gt; Is it a prayer that's lacking forgiveness? Jesus also spoke of that in the most popular chapter when talks about faith. If you have faith, you you have you'll be able to move mountains. And right in the same scriptures, he's we believe for those things and and that's something we believe with all of our heart. But then he says when you stand praying, forgive. Right? &gt;&gt; So you cannot faith cannot be without forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So what why am I saying those? Because prayer is the answer. But what's the substance of your prayer? &gt;&gt; You see everybody's offering up prayers. And matter of fact, there's if you don't know how to pray, they'll give you books to you learn how to pray in. You can repeat prayers. I never did care for that too much of just repeating prayers. But if you have to do that, but you see now that can get uh vain repetition that can get repetitive. &gt;&gt; And so God's interested in the substance that's going on behind the prayer. And and so now forgiveness is one thing. If it is uh it's asking for if you're asking for forgiveness in your prayer and not forgiving someone else, uh that's a prayer that's that's not going to it's not going to have power behind it. Is it a prayer with pride like the Pharisees who came? Can you imagine this? Come into the temple and there's a sinner there crying and praying just and he's, you know, he's looking at him like he's low life down there. And his prayers, I thank thee, oh my father. &gt;&gt; I thank THEE, OH LORD. I THANK THEE that I'm not like that. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; What kind of prayer is that? AND IT SOUNDED GOOD AND IT, you know, probably had an Italian accent. I don't know. IT WAS JUST SO WONDERFUL. I THANK THEE LORD that I am not like this sinner down here. And anytime we have that kind of thing behind a pride behind us, I don't care how much in years we've been in the message. If we have that kind of I I just I don't think God is impressed &gt;&gt; with how great that prayer is when we put a person in a category that we're better than them. And Jesus said he was sitting there. He was unworthy to even get up and hold up his head. I'm a sinner. I need your grace. And God was impressed with that prayer because it didn't have pride in it. &gt;&gt; You see? So why are you saying this, brother of all? Because we say we need to pray. We need to pray. But you see, there has to be a substance behind our prayer. &gt;&gt; There has to be certain elements to our prayer. &gt;&gt; And we want to pray deep within our hearts that we're the right vessel and things are right that there be substance. to do. We don't want a pious prayer to say I'm good and I thank you that I'm not at least you know we do levels at least at least I'm not as bad as that person &gt;&gt; you know and we give our our resume with our prayer &gt;&gt; you know Lord you know come on now give me some credit at least I'm not like that &gt;&gt; but in reality you are like that &gt;&gt; can I get an amen &gt;&gt; and that's THE GRACE OF GOD YOU ARE LIKE THAT WE'RE ALL LIKE THAT WE'RE ALL SINNERS SAVED BY GRACE WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF SIN in our lives so whatever We reach the place that we're elect and they're not and all these other things that we come to even in the message. We are certainly off track and you cannot pray the prayer of faith the way God wants to be impressed by it when you have pride behind your prayer. &gt;&gt; Repeating prayers may not be enough. The Catholics beat on that all the time and and they people Catholics beat themselves up and how many Hail Marys they can say I've been in some some of their services like at a wedding and say you know here hail Mary love of go hail Mary mother of god you and whatever it is and they and they so many prayers that they repeat is more credit I guess I don't know how that works I should have looked it up but you know and I I'm not blasting the people of Catholic but I'm just saying that someone has deceived us into thinking that by more repetitive prayers and the Hail Marys that we get credits for that or we do penance for that and we can pay back for our sins. That's a lie. &gt;&gt; That's a deception. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I'm saying this about prayer because substance has to be behind our prayer and it's got to be behind our worship. So, now what substance are we talking about? The substance isn't it's not that we're perfect. Uh it's actually it's another way is is that in our prayers we're admitting that we're not perfect &gt;&gt; that we're not strong. &gt;&gt; I think God is more impressed with somebody who's admitting that they're not strong but he's strong. &gt;&gt; I think God likes the confession that we are weak and he is strong. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. So, you know, I'm a brother pastor sent me a book called A Praying Life and I'm just halfway through it, but I'm really enjoying it. And one of I was going to bring it tonight and read from and I I left it at the house. But it speaks that it speaks about prayer. It says a lot of Christians don't know how to pray because they got this big thing in their mind and we hesitate to pray. Number one, we don't feel worthy to pray. But when we go to pray, we feel like we have to be perfect. We have to present oursel perfect and we have to say the perfect words and we have to make sure that God on the level he's on. God's at a different level. So we've GOT TO SOMEHOW SAY IT RIGHT TO IMPRESS him because he's on a different level than us. Well, he is on a different level than us. But he likes his children to actually to speak like children &gt;&gt; because didn't Jesus say bring up the little child as they were fighting over who the greatest was. You know who's who's being the children here? Who's being childish? The disciples were. &gt;&gt; We talked to our mom and we was having a conversation the other day and we were wondering who's who takes over after you're gone and who's going to be at your right hand and who's going to be at your left and and you know, he just brings up a child and says, you know, this is the greatest in the kingdom of God. If you'll receive the kingdom like this child and he's he's taking a real stab at their pride right there, &gt;&gt; if you'll receive it. So, it's receiving it. And this book is really neat because it shows a little bit how children are when they're real young especially and they start to talk. You never know WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THEIR MOUTH next &gt;&gt; and it's actually embarrassing and you know it's it's but the thing is is that you know we don't condemn them if you know some children they they learn to walk later than other ones. you know, uh, Indie was right away. You know, I think she just come out of my mom's belly and started walking, it seemed like, and she's going at it now. Titus is just catching it. You know, it's just he's one now. He's just now catching it. And but he's catching it good. The last few days he's going, you know, before last week, Titus was walking like a mummy across the floor like this, you know, and but this week he straightened it out and he's looking a little bit more normal. It takes a while. But you know, if you you wouldn't take a child that's late in learning how to walk and condemn them. Say, "That's really good, bud. You know, you're you're two you're three years old. That's really good, but you should have been doing that back when you were one." &gt;&gt; We don't say that to children. &gt;&gt; If a kid waits till he's two or three years old, we leave that out. We're happy they're walking. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be that way with other people? &gt;&gt; Isn't God that way with us? You can't run until you learn how to walk. And God doesn't condemn you if you don't know how to walk early like the rest of the people. BUT WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO WALK, THERE'S A CELEBRATION. &gt;&gt; TITUS, WE CLAP FOR HIM CONSTANTLY. WHEN THEY LEARN TO WALK, NO MATTER WHAT AGE, I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T WALK TILL you're 10 years old, we're going to celebrate you. &gt;&gt; We're still GOING TO SAY, "OH, YOU [screaming] GOT IT. PRAISE THE LORD." ALL RIGHT. GOOD KID. You know, you hold that in your heart and say, "I don't know what took him till 10 YEARS OLD." BUT ANYWAY, WE'RE HAPPY [laughter] THAT YOU'RE WALKING. GOD, &gt;&gt; these kids say something and blurt it out. No matter how honest it is, no matter sometimes how wrong it is, if they're crying, whatever it is, they whatever is here, they it just express it. They just blurt it out. &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be parents that just we have to correct the wrong things, I'm sure. But you think we the thing is we're careful about that because that childlike they don't know any better yet. But God God is saying, Christ was saying, "I actually God actually likes you to come like that &gt;&gt; and be honest and just say what you're feeling." &gt;&gt; Don't try to impress God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're children. &gt;&gt; So, he wants YOU TO JUST START UNLOADING ON HIM AND START SAYING, "GOD, and then when you get to a positive co, I believe you can do it. I believe you're able." And all this, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TRY TO IMPRESS GOD WITH OUR WORDS. WE WANT TO BE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN. AND WHATEVER IT IS, LET IT OUT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come as a child. In other words, be real. &gt;&gt; Blurt it out. Be humble that you don't know everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a child. Sometimes they do act like they know everything, but we know that they don't. Sometimes the that that not knowing everything blurts out. It's because of their age. God wants us to be. Not that we know everything that we humble ourselves in our prayer and our confession. So I'm going to ask again, it's not just prayer. It's the substance behind our prayer. So what is the substance? What's the what's the major substance we're learning from he cares? Do you care? What is the provided way that opens more faith and triggers the heart of God to step in in a supernatural way? That's what this that's what this study is all about. &gt;&gt; What is what is it that we have on our lips and that we confess and that we pray that triggers what's the provided way to come that triggers the hearts of God heart of God. So we come to the the uh a bit of the sum of the services now and he cares do you care? We're coming to the end. He cares do you care? So what is the simple provided way of God? And in this quote, we read it a couple weeks ago, but this is to me, this is the summon the of the entire sermon. This is the provided way. And when we come God's provided way, then we open the door for God to show that he cares. &gt;&gt; Because when we come God's provided way, we show we care. &gt;&gt; That's right. When we come God's provided way, no matter how humbling, no matter how embarrassing, no matter how what it is, when we come his provided way, when we show we care by that, then he shows he cares. &gt;&gt; And he says it four or five times. He says, "When we show we care, then God shows that he cares. &gt;&gt; We have to show we care first." You see, so that quote, if you guys got it, um God's provided way is repentance, confession, and showing a results bringing forth fruit, meat for repentance, showing sincerity. That that sentence probably describes the whole he cares, do you care principle that I've been presenting? How do we show we care? What's the provided way? It is. And this is I I don't know if you were expecting something else, something super duper super spiritual, but it's right back to the things of repentance, confession, and showing results. So repentance, confession, results, bringing forth fruit for repentance. There's about three things there. Showing sincerity because in all in repentance and confession and showing results, it you have to have sincerity running through all of that. the depth of sincerity. Remember in the message he talks about, you know, he being insincere with his wife and repenting to her. You know, this woman when I was overseas talked to me and so, you know, you understand, oh, gal, you know, and he's just kind of insincere in his repentance. He's not sincere about it. So, he brings that out. So, sincerity is the thread that runs through the repentance, the confession, because we want real repentance. We want real confession. We want real results. Somebody wants real results. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know, like he said a few weeks ago about the medicine, if you said you took the medicine, you said you repented, then you're going to see the results of the medicine. &gt;&gt; And if you don't see the results of the medicine, you didn't take the medicine even though you said you took it. &gt;&gt; So now, when we take this medicine and we took it the right way, it's going to get results. It's going to show fruits because it's God's medicine. But we when we come a sincere way of repentance and confession, it's going to show results. It's going to show fruit to it. And if it's not, then something's lacking in our sincerity. We're looking for God to come in. If you people will just do that this morning, that's going to be prayed for. And you people that hear this tape all over the world and after this tape is played and the minister or the person that's playing it in a congregation groups out in the jungles or wherever you are that's playing it will first make your confession clear and then come with nothing in your heart at all but faith. You know this is cleaning of the heart out just cleaning out. You know you can't have things hanging on you. &gt;&gt; You take care of that first. &gt;&gt; Cleanse it. That's what I said about Josiah. He didn't get all inspired and say, "Oh, God, send your glory down to the temple right now." He knew you couldn't ask for God's glory when the temple was in such a state. &gt;&gt; Temple had to be clean first. &gt;&gt; The spirit, your your temple, your spirit, your mind, you can't come. That's why there's a little bit of a hint when we come to church that we don't just it's not when the saints come dragging in. You know, you prepare yourself. Pray a little bit Saturday night or, you know, before you come in the afternoon. I know it's hard. you're busy and you're tired on Wednesday nights, but just go into your heart. Say, "Lord, prepare my heart. Forgive me of my sins, Lord. &gt;&gt; Prepare my heart for the service tonight. Don't just come cold turkey." &gt;&gt; You don't do that at Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Don't just come cold turkey, but prepare your the way our temple is that we clean our temple out. Clean our minds out. Settle our minds. God, forgive me what I said. And I've had to ask forgiveness this morning. I had a a little interaction there with one of my kids. I had to make it right. You can't come up here and preach unless you make things right. But it's hard when you have those incidents take place. &gt;&gt; It it it hinders your spirit &gt;&gt; tonight. You know, that still hinders me a little bit. Uh but I I want to I want to be faithful to my call of duty. But I want to be honest with you, too. Those little things that happen or big things, they they they wound our spirit. &gt;&gt; And we quickly got to deal with it and say, "God, heal my spirit of that and forgive me for saying that. Forgive me for yelling. Forgive me for doing that. I I shouldn't have done that. You can't let those things hang on you for days. We want to clear them out because then we if you're nothing in your heart but faith and be prayed for. Listen to this now. If if you confess and you your confession's clear, you come with nothing in your heart all but faith and be prayed for. There is the medicine will take place. &gt;&gt; That sounds like a guarantee. &gt;&gt; If you come the right provided way, &gt;&gt; the medicine will take effect &gt;&gt; because it's not your medicine. is God's medicine. &gt;&gt; And this medicine, what I called it a few weeks ago, the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is the gospel. This is the good news. &gt;&gt; This is God's medicine. This is in the doctors, is God's medicine. And he says it's a guaranteed cure for anything that's wrong. Can you say amen? AND YOU SET YOURSELF WHEN YOU COME, GOD'S provided way of repentance, full confession, full God, I and help me Lord never to do it again. You offer UP THAT HEART. YOU DON'T BRING THE power of God. He comes himself and the medicine takes effect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the medicine can't take effect until you come God's provided way. And the provided way is saying is real repentance, real confession, and real fruits of repentance and confession. Three things. Real repentance, real confession, and real fruits of repentance and confession. &gt;&gt; Real repentance, real confession, and real results. How many want that? &gt;&gt; Real repentance. Real confession. I'm not talking about put on or phony. &gt;&gt; Real repentance. &gt;&gt; Real confession. &gt;&gt; Real results. &gt;&gt; You know, God is a resultsoriented God. &gt;&gt; I like faith preachers uh that are they're real resultsoriented preachers. They want to see the results of this. Where is the Lord God of Elijah? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We had Elijah in this day, but where's the Lord God of Elijah? &gt;&gt; And they don't want to come to church. They want to see results. They want to see this supernatural God in action. They want to see a revival, a personal revival in their heart. They want to see some results. It's not just that we pray and we come to church and fill the duty. No, we're we should be a resultsoriented people. WE SHOULD HEAR TESTIMONIES of what God has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's working among us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; One of the assistant pastors for brother Yvonne was telling me the other night and he's just sharing his heart with me and he said I felt a little call to the ministry but he said I ran away from it and his wife had her was going to have her first baby and come to full term and then she had trouble at the end. that baby was she's laying in the hospital and that baby had died and uh in in the mom's womb and you know he went to repenting before God and sorry God I ran from your calling and you know just kind of just confessing and the child was already gone and so something rose in his heart. He went to his wife. They prayed the prayer of faith and you know that baby come back to life and that baby's still living today. &gt;&gt; Baby was dead. You talk about astounding the doctors. Amen. &gt;&gt; That baby come back to life. And a lot of times God wants to see our reaction, &gt;&gt; our confession. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Where do we say? So it has to be real and it has to show results to see the b power of God take over the fruits of God come from it. We want to see fruits. We want to be a resultoriented people. Can you say amen? And we're not say, "Well, God, you better do it today or I'm not going to believe." Whenever God wants to do it, but we're still under expectation. We're resultsoriented. &gt;&gt; You say, "I want God to restore my family." Well, you hold that faith. If you have to hold it for five years, you hold that faith there. I'm looking for God to restore my marriage and family &gt;&gt; because why? We're resultsoriented. I'm going to confess. I'm going to do everything I can, but I'm not going to give up because I'm not just a a repenting kind of Christian. I'm not just confessing. I'm a resultsoriented Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for God to bring the results. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's it's sincerity is the thread that runs through these things. It's deeper than the surface of but it's when it's deeper and sincerity is in these things. It will produce the fruit. So it's three things and I thought I'd break them down tonight. It won't be very long. still catching up from the trip myself, but I thought I would break these down a little bit just in case we don't understand what real repentance is, what real confession is. Uh the best place to read is what we in He Cares You Care when he really elaborates on confession. Really important subject because he elaborated on it quite a bit. remember he talked about this the meeting in New York and there wasn't wasn't too many results and God woke them up in the in the motel and said you go down there and call a confession and a repentance in those people because there was a lack of confession. There's a lot of stuff hanging in their lives and that's why God couldn't do more miracles. &gt;&gt; So he went down that night didn't have I don't think he had a prayer line. He says we're going to call for a repentance. They repented and then the whole meeting turned around because confession getting things out &gt;&gt; being transparent to the Lord, &gt;&gt; devils start to run. &gt;&gt; Devils start to run. &gt;&gt; So just in case in and the third thing of real results. Uh let's talk about this a little bit tonight. Um real repentance, biblical repentance means a fundamental change of mind and heart. In the Greek, it's metanonia. That involves recognizing sin as offensive to God. So, we know sin is offensive to God. But repentance is a is a recognition or a a change of mind. Brother Bram said that repentance isn't just saying sorry. It's a change. &gt;&gt; So, the first thing that changes is a change of mind. Your life may not be changed quite yet. that comes more as the confessing and devils run and things but the it's initial it's almost mechanical a little bit although we know it's God that leads you to repentance and if he leads you to repent you better repent you should repent but you see now repentance is a change of mind and what are you changing that you change your mind that sin is offensive to God and if my sin is offensive to God then I'm repenting because it's offensive to me if whatever is offensive to God is offensive to me That's rep. That's when somebody's really repenting. They've come to a change of mind that I see the damage my sin has done. I see it's been offensive to God. Remember when Joseph and Pontifer's wife putting pressure on him to have relations and stuff? And you remember what he said? How can I do this sin before my God? &gt;&gt; It wasn't just your husband will catch us. We'll be caught. It was first, his first fear was a fear of God. How could I do this and ruin MY RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD? &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE A SOBERNESS. If it's your wife or your husband, you should have a soberness of that. How could you hurt your husband or wife like that? &gt;&gt; How could you play around like that? But but it's not good enough just to have that fear for your wife or husband. You got to have it for God first. He said, "How can I do this sin against my God?" And that's when somebody, you know, Joseph didn't know do anything wrong with the type of Christ. But you see now when someone makes a mistake, when someone falls, then the first step is real repentance. It's not just saying I'm sorry. It's not just saying I'm sorry because you got caught. &gt;&gt; Our kids do that, don't they? It's not just saying sorry because you got caught. But there's a soberness to it that this is a serious thing that I have done. And &gt;&gt; that's why I'm making it right because it's been it involves recognizing sin as an offense to God. Josiah rent his clothes and cried. It's it's recognizing sin as an offense to God. Turning away from sinful behavior. That's repentance. And turning towards God. Here's repentance now. It's recognizing your sin as an offense to God. It's turning away from the sinful behavior. That's repentance. It's like somebody says sorry, they go back to the same thing the next day. something's wrong with your repentance. I'M TELLING IT LIKE IT is tonight. We want deeper repentance and that is not just saying I'm sorry, but we see some fruits from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the second part even of repentance is not just we are moved that the the sin is offensive to God, but we turn away from the sinful behavior. And you know what we turn to? We turn towards God. &gt;&gt; It's God- centered now. &gt;&gt; That's repentance. Now I'm going to have a Christc centered life. I'm going have a God- centered life because what got me into trouble is I wasn't centered on Christ enough. &gt;&gt; So in my repentance now I'm I'm uh the sin is offensive to God. I'm turning away from the sinful behavior. I'm getting away from the things that's causing this. I'm distancing myself big time. I'll talk about that on Sunday a little bit as well. But and I'm turning towards God. It is a two-part process of sorrow for sin and commitment to live a new life that honors God. This involves more than just feeling remorse. It is a transforming act of forsaking wrongdoing and returning to a relationship with God. That's repentance. &gt;&gt; Can I say it is a transforming act of forsaking wrongdoing. There's change. Brother says repentance is not just it's change. Something's changing. And you see those fruits are changed. So in the biblical repentance, it's a change of mind. The Greek word for repentance is to change one's mind a new way. Turning from sin and turning to God. A comprehensive change that is a deep and transforming change that affects one's entire way. Listen now. It's a change that affects one's entire way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. &gt;&gt; That's when God's dealing with somebody in repentance. It's affecting their whole being. &gt;&gt; It's affecting their behavior. I may not have the strength yet to get this right, but I'm focused on God changed my behavior. &gt;&gt; David said and and and every time I look up who had the greatest confession and and and fruits, I looked it up today. Who had the best the greatest fruits from their confession of their sin? And everybody points to David. Thorough repentance. Forgive me. Purge me with hissup. Psalms 51, build the walls of Jerusalem so I'll never do this again. That's a repentance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Recognizing the offense of sin. It involves acknowledging the sin is not only wrong, but it also off it's offensive to God and an act of will. Repentance as a choice to forget forsake one's old ways and commit to a new path of correction and truth. So I agree with a lot of that uh from the writers because this is what it is. This is what brother Brandham said. It was what the scripture says it is. It's not. It's something deeper and more below the surface than just merely saying I'm sorry. Now, let's move to the next one. Real confession. We got still have some time here. Real confessions. We have real repentance. And now we have real confession. And confession goes much deeper than repentance. It really shows repentance is real. When you have a confession of truth, a confession of truth, if re if the repentance is just feeling bad for what you did or feeling bad that you got caught, um, and you never acknowledge it verbally or clarify what you did, you're you don't want to do that. You don't want to acknowledge what you did wrong. You don't want to confess what you did wrong. you don't want to clarify what you did and pinpoint exactly what you did wrong and who I hurt. If if if a person's not coming out with that and saying it, then they they probably stopped at the at the surface level of just repenting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So when verbally things are coming out that begins to identify who I hurt, what I did wrong, how I sometimes it's how I got there. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes a while for a person to say, "How did I get here? How in the world did I do that?" But you should go to prayer and say, "God, reveal to me because in my confession, somebody asked for my testimony. I want to be a blessing to someone else to share, hey, this is how I got here." And every time you do that, you expose the de the devil's tricks. &gt;&gt; That's the thing about confession IS IT EXPOSES THE DEVIL. THERE'S A FREEDOM WITH IT. THE DEVIL'S RUN. They can't stand confession. &gt;&gt; This is how I got into this trouble. This is what I did. I'm owning up to it. And it's just these things come out of the mouth. That is something that's acknowledging acknowledging what took place. You will never acknowledge it verbally and clarify what you did if there's not true repentance there. Confession is verbally aligning itself with what the real truth is. You align your confession with truth. Now, sometimes that truth is the bad stuff first, but you got to own up to it. &gt;&gt; You got to confess it &gt;&gt; and then we'll get to the end of this where he's the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; We begin to confess what God has done for us &gt;&gt; and God also acts on that confession. &gt;&gt; So, it's not all negative. It's confessing the truth. I did this. I failed here. I'm sorry. I I God, please change me. Help me never to do that again. And it's talking. And sometimes you you don't have to share it with the whole world, but if you but you share your testimony. In other words, you're not trying to hide anything. You're not trying to be super spiritual to everybody. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, some people have been so honest with me. I'll tell you, it's But I always honor it as tough as and embarrassing as it is. There's a sister over there, a young sister. She started to share her testimony. She was asking me a question how to deal with certain things. And I'll tell you, my heart went out to her this things that happen sometimes around our ranks. It just broke my heart. And for her to be that honest and to trust me with that, to take it before the Lord and I'm going to be praying for her. &gt;&gt; But you're going to be a lot further along if you're confessing it. &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my life. It's not a good one, but I'm putting it before the Lord. I'm want I want the devil to not use this in my life. &gt;&gt; Confession is a beautiful thing. So, confession is verbally aligning yourself with what's the real truth. What really happened? Not a packaged version of what happened. &gt;&gt; Not a repackaged presentation of what happened. What really happened? not watered down to protect yourself. &gt;&gt; Someone who is good at talking can become very professional at talking their way out of things &gt;&gt; because they're just good at it. Talking their way out of anything or hiding. And someone can do that if they're more quiet. You know, it's just they either hide it or they're professional at talking their way out of it. All of us can lean that direction because we want to put our best foot foot forward. put forward. We want to put our best foot forward to everybody. We don't want to be embarrassed in front of anybody. &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to say go embarrass yourself to the world. I'm saying true an confession is lining yourself with the truth. &gt;&gt; Even if it hurts for a while. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Got to do it. Got to do it. &gt;&gt; You can't This is God's provided way. And you can't wiggle out any other way. You can't climb up. Didn't Jesus talk about those climbing up some other way. You can't climb up another way into the kingdom. You got to come his provided way. &gt;&gt; And aligning yourself with truth, not a package version. And someone who's so now in the Bible now, confession from the writers, the Greek word for that is homo uh homogo, which means to say the same thing. Confession means to say the same thing, to agree. And that what why what are you saying the same thing as as truth? You're agreeing with truth. And you're not only agreeing with what the truth is, you're confessing it. &gt;&gt; Confessing is saying the same thing primarily. It has two key meanings. Acknowledging one's sins to God and publicly professing faith in Christ. So this goes deeper than just repenting to God. This is a a verbal public profession like when you come to the Lord uh if if there's a scripture that says how can they believe except there be a preacher and how and it goes through the steps and it says how can they unless they confess Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; openly. I'm not ashamed of him. I'm confessing Jesus Christ. He's my Lord. I'll I'm repentant in his name. I I'll be baptized in front of anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I become a candidate to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. So, confessions of sins, this form involves a genuine admission of personal wrongdoing, agreeing with God's assessment of the sin. It is necessary. It is a necessary condition to receiving forgiveness and cleansing. So, there's acknowledgement, recognizing and naming specific sins, thoughts, words, actions. Confession is number one recognizing and naming specific sins, thoughts, words, and actions without trying to justify or to excuse them. Another part of confession is linked to repentance. Confession is closely linked with repentance, which involves a sincere sorrow for sin, that it offends God and a commitment to turn away from that sin and realign one's life with God's will. Confession involves humility. It arises from a humble heart and a recognition of one's need for God's mercy and grace rather than as a way to earn forgiveness. I want you to catch that now. It does not confess because it's trying to earn forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Do we want forgiveness? Yes. But the motive the motive has to be deeper than just I'm confessing because I want forgiveness from this person or I want forgiveness. The motive has to be a deeper recognizing your need for God's mercy and grace rather than a way to earn forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not putting a quick band-aid on your problem. &gt;&gt; It's not, okay, just let's just get this forgiveness done and get it over and and move on with life. I just want this all to go away. &gt;&gt; If you hear somebody say that, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Let God make it go away. Let God wash it away. But if you're quickly trying to get it to get a a forgiveness from somebody till they say they I forgive you. Okay, that's done. That's over. You shouldn't do it for that motive. So, it's part of forgiveness. But then the last thing, oh yeah, forgiveness is a part of confession. Scripture promises that when believers confess their sins, God is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. That's our text. To whom? It raises the question, who do we confess to? Number one, to the Lord. Yet in the scripture, you this is a pastor who reads this every now and then. While your confession is made primarily to God, the Bible also speaks of confessing sins to one another, your faults one to another. James 5:16, especially if the sin has harmed another person, &gt;&gt; for the sake of reconciliation and mutual healing. I never understand people that go years and years and years and they don't think they have to talk about or reconcile what's been said, what's been done, the damage that's been done. We should be reaching out for reconciliation. And not a lot of times reconciliation is you're you're saying something to talk about it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To make your part right, see if they'll say anything back. So, it's it's there is a place for confessing our faults to one another, especially if it has harmed another person. And as I've preached, it kind of opens up this spirit and atmosphere of freedom when we are willing to be open and as I said a few Sundays ago, broken with one another. I said in communion, God wants us to stay a broken people. Some people Jesus said Jesus said he that is whole needeth not a physician. &gt;&gt; They don't. They're okay. They're already together. &gt;&gt; But I'm not together. &gt;&gt; I'm broken. &gt;&gt; And I bring my brokenness to God. And I think the rest of us should be broken with one another. The Catholics have confessional booths and they, you know, I don't know where this come from, so I had to look it up, but it's the screen that they have in the two little rooms. The priest is in one room and they're in another. It allows the penet to confess her sins without being seen by the priest, which helps to ease embarrassment or shame and encourages a full and honest confession. So, the intent was to ease the pain of embarrassment or shame. I'm just a little leerary of presenting something that would ease the pain of our sin. God wants us to to to feel a bit of that. &gt;&gt; To bring us to a true repentance. &gt;&gt; Uh the confession booster of privacy and confidentiality. The enclosed space ensures privacy and reinforces the strict seal of confession. It's a focus on God. It's a prevention of impropriy. The booths were created for a prevention of impropriy. Historically, the physical separation was introduced in the 16th century by Cardinal Charles Bome to prevent any potential for physical contact or inappropriate advances between the priest and the penitant. &gt;&gt; Wow. Ah, that's the whole thing of that is wrong. That's not encouraging true repentance at all &gt;&gt; or true confession. They may confess in there, but there's not much results in their life. &gt;&gt; Because it's formed to take out the conviction, take out the embarrassment, take out and cause a person to hide. There's no washing. It's just a confession without the sincerity and without there's no washing with God. If if we confess, God wants to wash us. &gt;&gt; If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and and to cleanse us, wash us from all the unrighteousness, the power of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The third thing was real results. The third part of God's provided way is a heart that says, "God, I'm repenting. I'm confessing. And I'm calling a God to come on the scene and change me that I would never do this again." &gt;&gt; God changed me so that everyone can see the evidence of change. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My family, my wife, my husband, let it not be just repentance and confession. That's only part of it. But Lord, come and show. Let me show the results. &gt;&gt; Consistency that something has changed. &gt;&gt; Didn't John the Baptist say it to the Pharisees? Because they just wanted to be baptized [snorts] so they go tell they got baptized by the prophet. It was nothing more than that. They wanted to be popular. I can go say John the Baptist, the baptizer, baptized me. And they would have went down a dry sinner and come up a wet one. &gt;&gt; And and John the Baptist said, "Why? Go back and bring forth fruits of repentance. &gt;&gt; Let me see your real heart in this word &gt;&gt; to follow me as God's prophet." &gt;&gt; So I want everyone to see the evidence of change. It's like it's like saying these signs shall follow them that believe. Every Christian believes that scripture. Can you say amen? It's not just a God of yesterday, but it's a God of today. And those that believe these signs shall follow them that believe. That's a results &gt;&gt; God. Can you say amen? We don't make up the signs, but we believe. These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; And what that's saying, there's this is a result God. In other words, if there's true repentance, if there's a true spirit, a true atmosphere and and the true preaching of the word, these signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the medicine takes effect and everybody can see the medicine. Everybody can see the the change. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And it's a it's it's if this is God's provided way that the medicine of the power of the blood takes effect. The blood has power in it for all problems. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; God proves it that the blood has power in it for all problems. And when we kick, when we have this sincere confession, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us. When we walk in the light as he's in the light and we're not living in darkness hiding things. &gt;&gt; Our text said that if you say you walk in the light or you're walking with him and you live in darkness, you walk in darkness. That's true. &gt;&gt; You lie and do not the truth. &gt;&gt; You see, so we're not called to live in darkness privately and say that we're children of light. &gt;&gt; We live all the time in the light. &gt;&gt; We live as an open book. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if if the word comes and just exposes something and and how many's been Christians a while still God will take the spotlight of his word and just come and hone in and and just you know you can you raise your hand and all of a sudden it it puts light on something you go oh that's ugly. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that was still there. &gt;&gt; And it's the greatest thing that can happen to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. You stay around this word long enough. The Holy Spirit's here. He never lets us by with things. He loves us enough to come and tell us where we're wrong. He shines light on that area. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people have run from it. Some people have stayed around, but then they run because the word is too exposing sometimes and they don't see it as the love of God. &gt;&gt; But when he puts that spotlight on us, then it's important that God puts it there and you confess it and you bring it out because we can grow in the Lord and the blood of Jesus Christ comes in that light and cleanses us from all sin. I'm closing with that wonderful place in Hebrews where it refers to Christ as our high priest. Kenny, you can come and we're going to sing. The blood will never lose its power. &gt;&gt; You listening still? &gt;&gt; He said so many places, he's the high priest of our profession. &gt;&gt; And he says that means he's the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; And so he said he can't act as our high priest. We have the blood, but we have a high priest to go to that can that can sympath can have sympathy with us because he's been he's been um tested in all manners. Our high priest, Christ. Aren't you glad tonight you have somebody higher than you to go to? &gt;&gt; To confess to, &gt;&gt; aren't you glad you have somebody higher than you? &gt;&gt; We have a higher power to go to. &gt;&gt; And so if we and we have access to the blood through our high priest. And so, how do we get there? Confession. He's the high priest of our confession. And brother Brandham says he can't do nothing until that confession. When we begin to confess what he's done for us, that it's done. That's in a finished work at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Our high priest begins to step into that confession. Can you imagine our high priest? I don't want to say up here because he's near us, but he's higher than us. And so, he is our high priest and he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. He wants to hear what you're feeling. He wants to hear what you're going through. He wants to hear your confession. Even if it's bad, our high priest is listening in to your confession. And the heart behind your confession is that he's impressed when there's a true confession. &gt;&gt; He can tell WHEN THERE'S A COVER UP. &gt;&gt; But our high priest, he's not there saying, "Oh, he's not judging us." No, he's there as a as a representative for us &gt;&gt; to get to the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what's he listening for to act? What's he listening for? Our confession. &gt;&gt; What are they saying? Are they hiding sin? &gt;&gt; Our priest says, "Ah, &gt;&gt; there he did it. There she did it. She's completely He's completely opened up his whole life. He's confessed it. &gt;&gt; The high priest can act on that." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then they move along. They start pre professing and saying, "You know what? I don't know how I'm going to get out of this, but God's going to get me out of it. &gt;&gt; God's going to get me out. &gt;&gt; The blood's going to get me out. &gt;&gt; High priest going, "Oh, I can act on that." That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a confession I want to hear. It's kind of like when the when uh uh uh Joshua and Caleb come back and said, "We're more than able to take the land." While the other guys are saying, "There's giants and we can't do it and God's failed us." Everything else, they're saying we're well able to take the land. And our high priest, he's saying, "That's the confession I want to hear &gt;&gt; because don't worry about the demons. Don't worry about the the high cities. Don't worry about the giants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't see yourself as a grasshopper. &gt;&gt; They seen themselves as grasshoppers. &gt;&gt; We're grasshoppers in their sight and we're grasshoppers in our own sight. Well, that's a problem. &gt;&gt; But Joshua and Caleb said, "No, no, no. We ain't we ain't grasshoppers." &gt;&gt; There's more with us than with them. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; And they started say, remember they said they still the audience &gt;&gt; because they're all complaining, we can't do it. We're going to go back to Egypt. were finished and they said they still and I just don't think they just said guys can I say something I think they said shut up I don't want to hear this anymore &gt;&gt; sorry for saying shut up parents BE QUIET LET ME SAY SOMETHING I'VE BEEN OVER THERE I'VE GOT THE FRUIT WE ARE WELL ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND GOD'S GIVEN IT TO US LET'S GO do it &gt;&gt; and God just saying that's what I need to hear right &gt;&gt; that's the confession I can do something with &gt;&gt; you can go on Monday morning and you're having a dull drum of a day and you don't know how it's going to go and maybe something went wrong in the morning kind of like mine day today. But when you can keep the confession, God's going [music] to work this out. &gt;&gt; God's going to help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our profession and he acts. He steps in as a caring [music] God. steps in and the blood of Jesus Christ comes and [music] washes everything away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood. Let's stand.
