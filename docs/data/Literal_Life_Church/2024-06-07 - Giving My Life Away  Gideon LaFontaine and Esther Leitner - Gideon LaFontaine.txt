Giving My Life Away

Lyrics:
I've seen a vision harsh and sweet 
One who gave all He had for me 
I've seen the passion of his death 
And the forgiveness in His final breath 
Now I can never be the same 
My heart has been forever changed 
I've got to live and love and give because He gave 

Now I'm giving my life away 
Laying it down on the altar 
Now I'm giving my life away
The very least I can offer is my all 
So here I stand today 
Giving my life away 

No earthly price could be too great 
No sacrifice too much to make 
No way of measuring the cost 
Next to the blood of cal - v'ry's cross 
So if I live, I live for Him 
Or if I die, I count it gain 
My life is not my own, but His from this day on  


Written by Damaris Carbaugh
