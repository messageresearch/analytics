[0:00] It's good to be with you. Amen. Let's
[0:02] open our Bibles if we
[0:03] could. Wanted to say that brother Ed
[0:08] told us uh on Sunday that his son to
[0:11] give the testimony his son is off the
[0:13] dialysis and his kidneys are
[0:15] functioning. Right, brother Ed?
[0:18] And
[0:21] [Applause]
[0:25] so we still not out of the woods.
[0:27] There's some other things that we can
[0:29] keep praying forward. Go ahead, brother
[0:31] Ed.
[0:37] Okay.
[0:48] Let's pray that he receives Christ.
[0:49] That'll help with that
[0:51] depression. That's the big one for sure.
[0:54] But if you brought him through all this,
[0:55] he'd bring him there, too. So, Let's
[0:57] just be praying for his soul if you'd
[0:59] just bring his name. Is it Chad? Brett.
[1:01] Brett. Brett. Sorry about this. Bring
[1:03] his name before the Lord. And I believe
[1:05] that uh God is able. Amen. Such a good
[1:08] testimony to hear that. It's just a
[1:10] miracle. But we want the real miracle to
[1:12] take place. And that's his heart is
[1:13] softened to receive the Lord. And uh you
[1:16] keep holding on, brother Ed like Wright,
[1:19] believe for your children. And you keep
[1:21] holding that before the Lord. I want to
[1:23] read in Romans 4 tonight in the blessed
[1:26] word of God. And uh we're going to
[1:28] continue in a series on the blessed
[1:30] families. Uh in Genesis we read where
[1:33] Abraham as he received God and stepped
[1:36] out by faith with the word of God, he
[1:40] promised him to be blessed himself and
[1:42] also that he'd be a father of many
[1:44] nations. But one of the blessings that
[1:46] came from Abraham's obedience was that
[1:49] the the families of the earth would be
[1:51] blessed. And uh we want to speak a
[1:54] little bit about that again tonight. And
[1:56] because I know that the strength of a
[1:58] church is the strength of the families
[2:01] and the strength of the marriages and
[2:04] that includes my own marriage and my own
[2:05] family. And it's a bit of a challenge
[2:08] today to be able to raise a family in
[2:11] the environment that we're in. But
[2:14] without the Holy Ghost, we'd be lost,
[2:15] wouldn't we? Without the word of God
[2:17] that expresses uh what we need in this
[2:20] hour and also just the Holy Ghost to
[2:22] make it alive. I'll tell you, we would
[2:23] be without the token, we wouldn't have
[2:25] anything. And I just uh I'm glad to be
[2:27] able to preach that to you tonight. But
[2:29] the family is important thing. I want to
[2:31] read this section of scriptures and get
[2:33] to the faith of Abraham a little bit
[2:35] tonight. We talked about oneness and I
[2:37] want to speak a little bit more about
[2:38] oneness. Uh the oneness of the family
[2:41] and our oneness with God. And I thought
[2:43] that was a good place to start when we
[2:45] talk about families because you can have
[2:47] everything right. And if you don't have
[2:49] oneness with God and oneness with one
[2:51] another, then that's not really a strong
[2:53] family yet. That's the that's a real
[2:54] family is that they have oneness with
[2:56] God and oneness with one another.
[2:58] Harmony with God and harmony with one
[3:00] another. How do we get to that type of
[3:03] harmony? Um, so in Abraham's testimony
[3:06] here, you've read this many times
[3:07] before, but I want you to notice uh his
[3:10] life again in verse 17 of chapter 4, as
[3:14] it is written, I have made thee a father
[3:16] of many nations before him whom he
[3:19] believed, even God, who quickenth the
[3:21] dead, and calleth those things which are
[3:24] be not as though they were, who against
[3:27] hope believed in hope, that he might
[3:29] become the father of many nations,
[3:31] according to that which was spoken,
[3:34] So shall thy seed be. And being not weak
[3:37] in faith, he considered not his own body
[3:40] now dead when he was about a hundred
[3:42] years old, neither yet the deadness of
[3:44] Sarah's womb. And there's a scripture
[3:46] here that I want to get to. He staggered
[3:48] not at the promise of God through
[3:51] unbelief. So that tells us that he had
[3:54] the promise of God. He had the word from
[3:56] God, but it wasn't easy because he had
[3:58] to go through what? He had to go through
[4:00] unbelief. He had to fight through
[4:02] unbelief the whole way. Every year,
[4:05] every day that he believed God's
[4:07] promise, it wasn't easy. He had to cut
[4:09] through something. And what he had to
[4:11] cut through was all the unbelief. But he
[4:14] staggered not at the promise of God
[4:16] through unbelief, but was strong in
[4:19] what? Was strong in faith. So Abraham
[4:22] not only had the word from directly from
[4:24] God. Uh he not only had a promise from
[4:27] God but all of that would not count
[4:30] unless Abraham himself had not had
[4:32] strong faith to go with the word because
[4:35] and that's what I want to talk about
[4:36] tonight. We have the word, we have his
[4:38] spirit, we have uh all these things but
[4:40] we need to be strong in faith with the
[4:42] word. Uh he said, "But was strong in
[4:44] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[4:46] fully persuaded that what he had
[4:49] promised, he was able also to perform,
[4:52] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[4:55] righteousness." Amen. Let's all pray
[4:56] together. Heavenly Father, your goodness
[4:58] to us, Lord, is just so wonderful. We
[5:01] appreciate this testimony tonight. We
[5:03] appreciate you answering these prayers,
[5:05] Lord. And we want to stop and say thank
[5:07] you for it, Lord. So many things in the
[5:09] last few weeks has happened so positive
[5:12] that we we we want to just glorify your
[5:15] name. As the Bible says here about
[5:17] Abraham, he staggered not and he
[5:20] continued to glorify God through his
[5:22] testimony. And we want you to be
[5:23] glorified, Lord. You're a mighty God.
[5:25] You you do these works and even the
[5:27] little things you do, we don't want to
[5:29] forget, but we want to glorify you
[5:30] through those things and let the world
[5:33] know that you're still alive and your
[5:34] people. Father, we just pray you'll
[5:36] bless this study and strengthen the
[5:38] families. Strengthen each one, Lord, in
[5:40] their personal uh contact and connection
[5:43] with you, Lord, and their fellowship
[5:44] with you. Strengthen that fellowship,
[5:46] Lord, because we're going to need it
[5:48] more and more as the days go on. We need
[5:50] to just stay just as close to you as we
[5:52] can stay. And Lord, if anyone's distant
[5:55] from you tonight, may the the gentleness
[5:57] of the Holy Spirit woo them to a closer
[6:00] walk with you. We just commit this
[6:02] service to you in the name of Jesus
[6:04] Christ. Amen. Amen. Shake somebody's
[6:06] hand before you sit down. And God bless
[6:08] you each
[6:16] one. Just before we get to the quotes in
[6:19] the scriptures, I was little section
[6:21] here in uh Larry Christensen's Christian
[6:24] Family. The he says here says quite a
[6:27] few good things and related to the
[6:29] scriptures that are related to the
[6:30] family. But he was talking a little bit
[6:33] about how in history
[6:35] um marriage and the family uh was quite
[6:37] different when we come to Christianity
[6:39] in the New Testament uh the level of it
[6:41] be to change and God wanted to really ex
[6:44] uh show himself in his glory through the
[6:47] family unit and so it wasn't it was a
[6:50] side thing that a lot of times books
[6:52] when they're teaching on families to
[6:54] help you be a better family even
[6:56] sometimes Christian books they their
[6:58] focus is to do all the mechanics and we
[7:00] can do everything right and then bring
[7:02] religion in too because that'll be a
[7:03] good factor to bring in to help your
[7:05] family. A lot of the books are that way.
[7:07] But that's not how God intended the
[7:09] Christian family to be set up and the
[7:11] whole family unit as we've been
[7:12] preaching on this that the whole family
[7:14] unit in the marriage is God's image from
[7:16] the very beginning. It was the ultimate
[7:18] climax of what God was trying to say
[7:20] because God wanted a family and uh and
[7:23] so he wanted to display that on earth.
[7:25] So it's not a side thing that we need to
[7:27] bring religion in with all the other
[7:28] facets of our family. Um Christ should
[7:32] become the center of the entire family.
[7:34] Christ should be the focus and all your
[7:36] life is ordered and arranged around
[7:39] Christ and his word. And uh and when we
[7:42] have a family like that, I think that's
[7:43] what God intended for it to be. He's
[7:46] saying here in Christianity, marriage
[7:47] achieves a sanctity and significance
[7:50] which was not known in ancient times.
[7:52] The forgotten dignity of woman was
[7:53] brought to light and its value
[7:55] acknowledged. Neither the Roman nor even
[7:57] the Mosaic law accorded the wife rights
[8:00] which were equally great and sacred with
[8:02] those of a man. In Christianity, the
[8:05] wife as well as the husband has claimed
[8:07] to be the perfect fidelity of the mate.
[8:09] The wife cease to ceases to be just
[8:12] merely a helper of her husband in this
[8:14] present life but is a fellow heir with
[8:16] him of eternal life. And that's
[8:18] according to first Peter 3:7 that the
[8:21] wife honor her as the weaker vessel, but
[8:24] consider her as a co-air with you in the
[8:26] things of God. We never heard any any of
[8:29] that too much in the Old Testament and
[8:31] we know that she is a helpmate to him.
[8:32] That's her place. But yet when we move
[8:34] after Calvary and God's elevating
[8:36] elevating everything in the restoration
[8:38] back of what was fallen in the garden,
[8:41] we realize that that woman comes right
[8:42] into inheritance with her husband and is
[8:44] an heir of God together with him of the
[8:47] promises of God. And yet more than all
[8:50] of this, the highest love of God to man
[8:52] was shown in the sacrifice of Christ.
[8:54] Through that sacrifice, the church came
[8:56] into existence. Between the church and
[8:58] Christ there exists a bond of love more
[8:59] holy, tender, and firm than any which
[9:01] ever existed between God and man. In
[9:04] Christianity, there is set before man
[9:05] and wife the task of representing upon
[9:08] the earth the image of this union
[9:10] between Christ and his church. An image
[9:12] of self-sacrifice, of devotion, of
[9:14] fidelity. In ancient times, marriage at
[9:17] its best had been a moral relationship.
[9:19] In Christian marriage, we see something
[9:21] higher still a mystery as it's called in
[9:24] Ephesians 5:32.
[9:27] The uh the neoplatonic philosophers
[9:30] looked on marriage with gloomy severity.
[9:33] It was a contradiction to the spiritual
[9:35] nature of man. The most rigid sect of
[9:38] Jesus day was called the Essenes. And
[9:42] they saw marriage as a hindrance to
[9:44] preparation for the kingdom of heaven.
[9:46] That's how they viewed marriage. It was
[9:47] a hindrance to and that was a sect in
[9:50] Jesus' time. Marriage was a hindrance to
[9:52] getting closer to God and embracing the
[9:54] kingdom of heaven.
[9:56] But the Christian family is formed to be
[9:59] the very image of the future kingdom of
[10:02] God
[10:03] in which the will of the Lord shall be
[10:05] done on earth as it is done in heaven.
[10:08] It is not only a school for heaven. It
[10:10] is a certain in in a certain sense it is
[10:12] the anticipated kingdom of God itself.
[10:16] In the Christian family on a small scale
[10:18] should be seen the wisdom and gentleness
[10:21] of command, the willingness of
[10:23] obedience, the unity and firmness of
[10:26] mutual confidence which will
[10:28] characterize the perfected kingdom of
[10:30] God. In an exact sense this can be said
[10:33] uh of the this is what said about the
[10:35] Christian family. So, I thought that was
[10:37] good if we've raised and elevated uh to
[10:40] a place through Calvary that God's in a
[10:42] restoration back to what was at the
[10:44] beginning, bringing us back into that
[10:46] position again. And God is having
[10:47] families that they were intended to be.
[10:50] and women in their uh in their place not
[10:54] certainly as a doormat but in her place
[10:56] as a daughter of God and men in their
[11:00] place as God intended the glory of God
[11:02] to be on that man and to express true
[11:04] leadership and children under subjection
[11:07] to their parents. God's bringing us all
[11:09] back in the restoration of our souls
[11:11] with the restoration of our soul is the
[11:13] restoration of the family unit and
[11:15] marriage. How many believe that tonight?
[11:18] So we want to talk a little bit about uh
[11:22] faith in light of this series in this
[11:24] section of scripture here. This life of
[11:26] faith that Abraham lived is actually the
[11:29] thing that produced the blessing that
[11:30] come to families. It was a life of faith
[11:33] and Abraham being our example with a
[11:36] promise of God with the word of God for
[11:37] the hour sent to him. He took to that
[11:40] and whatever it said he obeyed it. He
[11:42] followed it even so much he had to leave
[11:43] all of his family and go into a country
[11:45] he didn't know where he was going. But
[11:47] he had to obey God. He had to obey what
[11:48] the word said. He didn't even see all of
[11:51] the promise yet and didn't understand
[11:52] all the promise, but he obeyed. And he
[11:56] had he not only obeyed what God said to
[11:58] do, not understanding it all yet, but he
[12:00] obeyed and begin to have actions to his
[12:03] faith. And then he developed a strong
[12:06] life that's expressed here in Romans
[12:08] that he he would be willing to cut
[12:11] through anything that was in his way to
[12:14] get to the promise. And what the main
[12:16] thing he had to cut through was
[12:17] unbelief. Unbelief was everywhere. Uh
[12:20] the mocking of it was everywhere. The
[12:22] laughing of a man hundred years old that
[12:24] could have a baby probably was
[12:25] everywhere. Nobody understood that.
[12:27] Nobody could see that. But but Abraham
[12:29] could see it by the eyes of faith. The
[12:31] sixth sense is above your five senses.
[12:34] It's better than your five senses. And
[12:36] what these senses won't declare, the
[12:38] sixth sense of faith will declare that
[12:41] it's it's done and it's there. And it
[12:43] caused Abraham to live a life of faith.
[12:46] And so the faith, it was this kind of
[12:48] faith in a man that built him into the
[12:52] right family, but also God could so
[12:54] bless that it's going to bless all the
[12:56] families in the earth that follow this
[12:58] this father of faith. this kind of
[13:00] lifestyle, this kind of everyday faith,
[13:03] this type of uh uh stronghanded faith
[13:06] where you stagger not at the promise of
[13:09] God. A lot of people are staggering
[13:10] today. That's not talking about
[13:12] staggering physically. It's staggering
[13:14] spiritually. And and what do they
[13:15] stagger at? They're staggering at the
[13:17] promise of God because they're having to
[13:19] go through so much unbelief. But here we
[13:21] have an example of a man who didn't
[13:23] stagger through it, but he he cut his
[13:25] way through it and he stood up with
[13:27] faith and kept believing, calling those
[13:28] things that were not as those they were.
[13:31] Didn't even consider the deadness of
[13:33] Sarah's womb. Didn't even consider his
[13:36] age. He put it out of his mind. When
[13:38] they tried to put it in his mind, he put
[13:40] it out of his mind. I'm not even going
[13:42] to think about how how old I am. And the
[13:45] older I get, the more of a miracle it'll
[13:47] be. That's the way he felt about it. The
[13:48] older Sarah gets, the prettier she
[13:50] becomes. Woo, that's pretty good, isn't
[13:52] it?
[13:53] You stagger not and being fully
[13:55] persuaded. That's the life that we need
[13:57] of faith. We're fully persuaded. Satan
[14:01] can't poke no holes in our belief. Can
[14:03] you say amen? Amen. He staggered not at
[14:05] the promise and he was fully persuaded
[14:07] that what God had promised, he was able
[14:10] to perform. Today, we believe in a
[14:12] rapture. Can you say amen? And we need
[14:15] to be fully persuaded that God is able
[14:17] to perform that. We don't need to
[14:19] stagger at that promise for sure. And we
[14:21] don't need to stagger at any promise of
[14:22] God. We we need to be strong in the
[14:24] faith. And that's the lifestyle that he
[14:26] lived that actually trickled down a
[14:28] blessing to the families in all the
[14:31] earth. That kind of faith, that kind of
[14:33] lifestyle. Abraham had actions with his
[14:36] with his belief that brought results to
[14:39] his belief. He had he had action on his
[14:42] faith. He didn't just say, "I have
[14:43] faith." His his actions proved his
[14:46] words, his lifestyle. Can you say amen?
[14:49] It proved that he had faith that God
[14:52] spoke the promise. It dropped in his
[14:53] heart. He acted on the promise and he
[14:55] positioned himself which by in this way
[14:58] positioned himself. He had to get out of
[14:59] the land. God said, "Get thee out of the
[15:02] land and thy kindred and thy people."
[15:04] And so a separation had to take place in
[15:07] order for him to get the promise. And
[15:08] that's what happens in our life. And we
[15:10] have to obey the separations that God is
[15:13] asking us to make. Amen. We have to just
[15:15] obey him. And that's Abraham's example.
[15:17] He obeyed and got out, not knowing
[15:19] whether he went, not woring where he was
[15:20] going. And you all know that his
[15:22] experience coming out of the world.
[15:24] Maybe you didn't have a a Christian
[15:25] family to grow up in or message family.
[15:28] You've experienced the the separation
[15:30] that had to take place. Oh, you may get
[15:32] around them at uh family reunions and
[15:35] all this and do your best to try to make
[15:36] a connection there, but I'll tell you,
[15:38] it's difficult after you come to Christ
[15:40] because there has to be a healthy
[15:41] separation there. God's called you to
[15:44] another land, another kindred and other
[15:45] people. And uh that that is a a
[15:48] blessing. Be a witness to him. Be a
[15:50] testimony. There's a brother one time
[15:51] says, "Uh, well, I don't want to go over
[15:53] there to to my mother. She doesn't
[15:54] believe like I do, and they got all
[15:56] kinds of this and that and the other." I
[15:57] said, "You need if they ask you to go to
[15:59] a family event, you need to go. As long
[16:01] as not interrupting something you're
[16:02] doing for the Lord, you need to go cuz
[16:04] that can be a witness to them. You know,
[16:06] don't cram it down the throat. But you
[16:07] being there living in front of them,
[16:08] that's your opportunity."
[16:10] But yet yet in as a spiritual part of
[16:12] it, there has to be separations with
[16:15] Abraham as a physical separation. But
[16:18] us, it's more of a spiritual separation
[16:20] that I can't participate in what I
[16:22] participated in before with them. Amen.
[16:24] Because you want to be a witness. And so
[16:26] uh uh he was elected, he was called and
[16:29] then he obeyed. All these
[16:30] characteristics is our father Abraham
[16:32] because there were specific things that
[16:34] came with the promise he had to do and
[16:36] his actions acted in obedience and
[16:38] that's the kind of man of faith that
[16:40] will bless a family. Can I say that
[16:42] again? That is the kind of man of faith
[16:45] that'll trickle down a blessing to have
[16:46] a blessed family. I want to start here.
[16:50] That's actually the thing that brought
[16:51] oneness. Can you say amen? We need
[16:53] oneness in our family. But it was it was
[16:54] Abraham's obedience, Abraham's acting on
[16:57] faith, cutting through the unbelief.
[16:59] That's the kind of men we need because
[17:02] that'll trickle down to bless the
[17:03] families. It doesn't mean you have to be
[17:05] a a great uh
[17:07] um orator of the word before your family
[17:10] or you have to say everything just right
[17:12] or you have to be this big preacher to
[17:15] your family. You just need to be a man
[17:17] of faith that's willing to stand there
[17:19] and cut through things that are trying
[17:21] to to interrupt the oneness of your
[17:23] family. Amen. So what a great example.
[17:26] And brother Abraham says it this way.
[17:27] Then when he he was promised a son,
[17:29] Abraham, he was promised a son and he
[17:31] waited 25 years to receive that son,
[17:34] calling anything contrary to it as as
[17:36] though it wasn't so. So that's that's
[17:38] the way he had to be. If something came
[17:40] up that was contrary to the promise, he
[17:42] had to stand there and say, "Wait a
[17:44] minute, that's contrary to the promise."
[17:47] Somebody's got to stand up and say,
[17:49] "Anything that comes in that's
[17:50] contrary." He he he he he
[17:53] uh maybe word it the way he said it was
[17:55] as though it wasn't. So that's the way
[17:57] he considered it. That's the way he
[17:59] looked at it. So the man of God has to
[18:01] stand and be ready that if something
[18:04] comes up contrary, which it will, from
[18:07] every different uh shotgun that it can
[18:10] come from, from every different avenue,
[18:11] every different media venue, be ready
[18:14] cuz something contrary is trying to come
[18:17] in contrary to what you believe. And if
[18:21] nobody else stands up to it, the man of
[18:23] God has got to stand up and call
[18:24] anything contrary as though it wasn't so
[18:27] and cut through that. And he said, "And
[18:29] then and in this son all the families of
[18:32] the earth was to be blessed." Brother
[18:34] Ram says, "In his son, all the families
[18:36] of the earth." Listen, I'm going to
[18:38] raise my hands. I want to be one of
[18:39] those families tonight. We're in 2014.
[18:42] How many of you men of God, women of
[18:43] God, you young men that don't have your
[18:45] families yet? How many want to say, I
[18:47] want to come into the trickling of that
[18:48] blessing?
[18:50] I want my family to be happy. I want my
[18:53] family to be blessed. I want to serve
[18:55] the Lord the way he has instructed us in
[18:58] this hour. And I want to stand with
[19:00] faith. Can you say amen? And I want to
[19:03] be as my father Abraham in the in the
[19:05] approach to the word of God. I don't
[19:07] want to just be a believer, but I want
[19:09] to act on my faith of the word of God.
[19:11] And then he says, "And the patriarch was
[19:14] faithful to his call and faithful to the
[19:18] promised word." Both of those things. So
[19:20] I thought that was a wonderful thing.
[19:21] Now, we had ended a few weeks ago in
[19:24] talking about oneness out of the message
[19:25] oneness. And I would pick that up again
[19:27] uh in case somebody missed it or I
[19:30] thought I think it's good enough to
[19:32] repeat, but we were reading in the uh
[19:34] oneness message where oneness means he
[19:36] said to be one with united and this is
[19:39] quite a
[19:40] subject deserves a lot more tense than
[19:42] I'm able to give it. I'll skip through
[19:44] that. And then he says, "Now the first
[19:46] man and the first woman in the Garden of
[19:47] Eden was in perfect harmony with God so
[19:50] much that God could come down at any
[19:52] time he desired and talk lipto ear with
[19:54] Adam and Eve." Now, that is perfect
[19:56] oneness. God and his creation. I'm just
[19:59] going to skip back to the oneness part
[20:01] and then we'll get back to the faith
[20:03] part in a few minutes. Notice this
[20:05] perfect oneness. God and his creation.
[20:08] God speaking lipto ear with Adam and
[20:10] Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony
[20:13] with God till they were one with God.
[20:16] God and his family was one. So he just
[20:19] described oneness to us, oneness with
[20:21] God and in harmony with one another as
[20:24] well. And it it came because they were
[20:27] in harmony with God. And I described to
[20:30] you what harmony is. A lot of musical
[20:32] people know what harmony is. Most people
[20:34] do. If you're not a musical person, uh
[20:36] you can be in the uh kingdom of God,
[20:39] too.
[20:40] You can come to literal life as well.
[20:42] You don't have to have a gift of music
[20:44] at all because you have other gifts, you
[20:46] know. Uh but harmony is something that a
[20:50] a pleasing I read the things I gave you.
[20:52] A pleasing arrangement or combination of
[20:55] things or it's notes and music and and
[20:58] so when something harmony works with the
[21:01] melody, the melody is kind of the
[21:02] absolute and the harmony just enhances
[21:05] the melody and comes alongside and works
[21:07] with it. And I told you, even sometimes
[21:09] even non-m musical people, if I were to
[21:11] play the piano and get off on the
[21:13] harmony, the melody's going, but the
[21:14] harmony's off, you'd be able to tell it
[21:16] because it's going to clash. It's going
[21:17] to sound bad. Uh it's it's not in
[21:19] harmony. It's not It doesn't feel right.
[21:22] Musical people sometimes will cringe.
[21:24] You'll see them and they'll get uh goose
[21:27] pimples or something, you know? They'll
[21:28] they'll just all oh, that's not on. You
[21:32] can't stand it when the notes aren't
[21:33] right. And be and that's because is that
[21:36] it's not real harmony if it's not
[21:38] working in coordination with that melody
[21:41] line going along, right? And uh that's
[21:43] what harmony is. And so there's the
[21:46] melody and then the harmony flows with
[21:47] the melody. And so there has to be an
[21:50] absolute and the melody is the absolute
[21:53] and and we work in harmony with that
[21:56] melody. And when he uses the word
[21:58] harmony, that's what it means. with a
[22:00] family. First of all, they were in
[22:02] harmony with God's melody.
[22:05] They were in harmony with God's word.
[22:07] And that brought this oneness, them
[22:09] being that way, that that's so close
[22:11] that God could speak lip to ear with
[22:13] them. We're being restored back to that
[22:15] type of relationship with God.
[22:18] And so harmony flows. And so there's an
[22:20] absolute harmony. Harmony is in in
[22:22] agreement with the melody. It comp
[22:24] complements it. It doesn't clash with
[22:26] it. An orderly or a pleasing combination
[22:29] of elements and a whole is what harmony
[22:31] is. An orderly or pleasing combination
[22:33] of elements and a whole. Uh color
[22:35] harmony, the order and the harmony of
[22:37] the universe. Uh it's also a
[22:39] relationship in which various components
[22:42] exist together without destroying one
[22:44] another. So that's living in harmony.
[22:46] Different kinds of uh fish living in
[22:48] harmony or people living in harmony.
[22:50] It's various components exist together
[22:52] without destroying one another.
[22:55] uh a relationship characterized by a
[22:58] lack of conflict or by agreement as a of
[23:02] opinion or interest. And that's what we
[23:04] call the what they called family
[23:06] harmony. Let me read that again. A
[23:08] relationship characterized by a lack of
[23:10] conflict or by agreement as of opinion
[23:13] or interest. That's called family
[23:15] harmony. So you got musical harmony. You
[23:18] got the the harmony of components
[23:21] existing together, not destroying one
[23:23] another. I was just thinking of putting,
[23:25] you know, 10 kids in a in a daycare room
[23:27] without anybody there watching them.
[23:29] They're two years old,
[23:31] two-year-olds. You know, there would
[23:32] have to be some leader to help keep the
[23:35] harmony or they'll destroy one another
[23:38] eventually. So, it takes, and you know,
[23:41] that could be an example. It takes
[23:43] something higher than us
[23:47] to keep the harmony.
[23:49] If we're left alone to ourselves, we'd
[23:51] probably destroy one another.
[23:53] carnal flesh will destroy one another,
[23:55] become critical of one another. Just
[23:58] just start to just be vicious with one
[24:00] another. Like a brother told me the
[24:02] other day, he said, "You know what? I
[24:03] just want to quit fighting. I just want
[24:04] to enjoy life. I've fought all my life
[24:06] and I just want to be nice to everybody
[24:08] and quit fighting." None of us really,
[24:10] when it's over with, like to fight. It's
[24:12] the demons that get within us or the bad
[24:14] attitude that gets within us that likes
[24:16] to fight. That's right. Likes to draw
[24:17] somebody in the ring with you. Wow.
[24:20] There's people that are that way. They
[24:21] love to just have a good scrap with
[24:23] somebody. They don't feel like they've
[24:25] fulfilled the week yet unless they've
[24:27] had a really good scrap with somebody.
[24:29] And and that's carnal. That's carnal.
[24:32] Harmony is a totally different thing.
[24:33] And we It's a relationship characterized
[24:36] by the lack of
[24:37] conflict. So here they are the cool of
[24:39] the day. There's fellowship with with
[24:42] God. There's no walls. God felt
[24:44] comfortable with them. They felt
[24:47] comfortable with God. There there were
[24:49] no walls up. harmony with God. Harmony
[24:52] of God brought that oneness. Isn't that
[24:55] wonderful? And uh I just want to read
[24:58] this to you in oneness.eness. I didn't
[24:59] put it in my iPad here, but this is an
[25:01] amazing quote. You probably read it
[25:03] before, but what a union this was. He
[25:06] said, a oneness that would be to see God
[25:08] and his
[25:10] church a oneness. You talk about Jesus
[25:13] praying in the 17th chapter of John that
[25:16] they would be one as as we are one.
[25:19] Jesus praying that they would be one as
[25:20] we are one. So oneness with God and a
[25:23] oneness with one another, the father and
[25:25] him and he and us. What a union, a
[25:27] oneness that would be to see God in his
[25:30] church. Listen now till every member is
[25:33] just perfectly in harmony with each
[25:35] other and
[25:38] God. That's a goal that I'm looking
[25:41] for. If he said that that was Jesus
[25:44] prayer, then that's a goal we need to be
[25:46] praying and submitting oursel to. Paul
[25:48] and Paul says there in first Corinthians
[25:51] that we all speak the same thing. That's
[25:53] a goal that we ought to say. I pray the
[25:55] Holy Ghost would work in us whatever is
[25:57] needed for this goal that you get to the
[26:00] place in his church. We're talking about
[26:02] not just this church but the church
[26:03] worldwide till every member is perfectly
[26:06] in harmony with each other and God.
[26:09] Amen. And let's not shake our hands our
[26:12] heads and our heart and say not
[26:15] possible. If the word said it, it's
[26:18] possible.
[26:20] Perfectly in harmony with each other and
[26:21] God. That's the church that Jesus is
[26:24] coming for. Amen. Not a divided church.
[26:27] That's the church Jesus is coming for.
[26:29] That's when his prayer will be answered
[26:32] that we will be one. Amen. Powerful. So
[26:37] now then he goes on in one that's in the
[26:39] section I'm in here. Any man in his
[26:41] family, a correct, good, noble, obedient
[26:44] family is one with one another. Any
[26:46] family, a lot of words there, a family
[26:49] that's correct, that's good, that's
[26:51] noble, an obedient family is one with
[26:54] one another. Any family. And if there's
[26:56] something in the family that moves them
[26:59] apart, then it's not right. The family's
[27:01] broken somewhere. That's right. They
[27:04] should all be one. Father with mother,
[27:06] mother with father, children with
[27:08] parent, parent with children, all in
[27:11] agreement. And when you see that, you'll
[27:13] see one lovely picture. That's God's
[27:17] purpose, right? That's why I wanted to
[27:19] start with oneness because if you're
[27:21] going to build a family, that's where it
[27:23] starts, right? Amen. It doesn't start by
[27:26] doing all the other stuff and, you know,
[27:27] buying the vacation home so we can have
[27:29] vacations and all the there's a lot that
[27:31] goes with the family. is trying to make
[27:33] a, you know, trying to make a family and
[27:35] enjoyable vacations and trying to do
[27:37] this and get the things they need for
[27:38] school and h okay, if I talk about more,
[27:41] I'll get tired talking about it. But if
[27:43] you're going to build a family, you
[27:44] start with what does God say about
[27:47] oneness? Because that's what brings a
[27:48] real family, right? How do we get to
[27:50] that oneness? So, that's why I wanted to
[27:52] break this down. That's why I wanted to
[27:53] say it again tonight on another
[27:55] Wednesday night. Uh because it's been a
[27:57] few weeks since we've been on this
[27:59] subject. And if you're like me, you
[28:00] forget a lot. So that's why I'm bringing
[28:02] it back up again. Notice he said first
[28:04] of all an obedient family. An obedient
[28:07] family. Obedience has to be a part of
[28:09] it. That's right. You can't have oneness
[28:12] if you don't have an obedient family.
[28:15] You can't eliminate that word from it.
[28:18] Obedient to what though? Obedient to
[28:20] what? What are they obedient to? We know
[28:22] all know that children should be
[28:23] obedient to their parents. But he said
[28:25] an obedient family. And that means
[28:26] everybody's obedient. Everybody's
[28:29] obedient to something.
[28:31] All have to be obedient to something for
[28:33] this to work. None can be without dis
[28:35] without obedience. Disobedience from
[28:38] daddy down will break the oneness. There
[28:41] has to be a submissiveness in the spirit
[28:43] of each person. There has to be a
[28:45] willingness. Even even when uh those
[28:48] children don't have the Holy Ghost yet,
[28:51] they if they're if they're taught the
[28:53] blessing and taught the the taught the
[28:55] right kind of obedience and that they
[28:57] should be obedient, there's a blessing
[28:58] that goes with that oneness. they'll
[29:00] have more of a one fam oneness in their
[29:02] family if they'll learn to be obedient
[29:04] to to their parents and obedient to God
[29:06] ultimately. So if the family is but if
[29:09] the family is taught to um uh question
[29:13] authority all the time or or buck the
[29:16] system if they're taught that by their
[29:18] parents or they're taught that by
[29:20] someone else that that that whole
[29:22] scenario will eventually break up the
[29:24] family. There has to be an obedient
[29:26] family. Daddy has to be obedient to the
[29:28] word. Daddy has to obed be obedient to
[29:31] his to his boss. Yes. How does how do
[29:34] you expect obedience to work if the if
[29:36] the dad's not obedient to his boss,
[29:38] right? He won't obey his boss. First of
[29:40] all, he won't have his job for very
[29:41] long, right? But if he doesn't know
[29:44] obedience and the importance of it as a
[29:46] son of God, if he's not obedient to his
[29:48] boss, things will eventually hap happen
[29:50] and that will trickle down as well. He
[29:52] has he has to be obedient to God. He has
[29:54] to bring himself uh uh under the
[29:57] headship of God and God's delegated
[30:01] authority. Yeah. Two places, two or
[30:04] three places Paul talks about being
[30:07] servants being under their masters which
[30:09] in this day would be employers under
[30:11] their employees under their employer and
[30:14] he really emphasizes be obedient to
[30:16] them. Serve them and do it as under the
[30:18] Lord and do it for the ones that he said
[30:21] I'm paraphrasing and you know the
[30:22] scripture I'm talking about. Do it for
[30:23] the ones that are nice to you, but do it
[30:25] to the harsh ones as well. That's right.
[30:27] That's right. You glorify God through
[30:28] that. You're expressing that obedience
[30:30] is more important than sacrifice.
[30:32] Obedience is an important thing to you.
[30:34] And that boss made it. You see, when God
[30:36] has a delegated authority, you don't
[30:38] know who he's going to delegate his
[30:39] authority to. And he's going to mold
[30:41] your life by delegated authority. And a
[30:44] worldly boss, God can use That's right.
[30:46] to teach you things. I speak from
[30:48] experience, my friend.
[30:51] A worldly boss that doesn't care about
[30:53] God at all can be God's delegated
[30:55] authority. That's right. So, a man has
[30:59] to learn that he has to be obedient to
[31:02] God's delegated authority. And it
[31:04] trickles down all the way from the
[31:05] beginning with with God and Lucifer. And
[31:08] it comes all through the Bible, comes
[31:09] all the way up to the end. And obedience
[31:11] is such an important thing that men are
[31:14] obedient to God's delegated authority
[31:17] for the age, for the time. And when you
[31:19] have that working in a man, when you
[31:21] have that working in a man, then you got
[31:23] something really going there to see the
[31:26] nature of it, the nature of it begin to
[31:28] work in his children.
[31:31] Amen. And in his wife as well.
[31:37] So I don't know how how I got off on
[31:39] that, but let's get back here to uh so
[31:42] now if if if the family is taught to
[31:45] question and buck the system, oneness
[31:47] will break. So we still ask what is it
[31:50] it what is is it they are first obedient
[31:53] to what are they obedient to not just to
[31:56] one another but there has to be
[31:58] obedience to a spirit there has to be a
[32:01] reverence for something uh around them
[32:03] something other than themselves that
[32:05] they are all accountable to Christ and
[32:08] the word uh and the Bible says Ephesians
[32:11] submit yourselves one to another because
[32:14] there's no oneness without a submissive
[32:16] spirit there can be no Oneness without
[32:18] submission. That's right. I didn't get
[32:20] all the amens on that. That's all right.
[32:21] But study the Bible. You'll find it out.
[32:23] There can't be a oneness unless unless
[32:25] there's a spirit of submission there. A
[32:27] true spirit of submission. That's right.
[32:28] Offered up. You can't do it without it.
[32:30] It doesn't work.
[32:31] And and and so now uh if we if we see
[32:35] this reverence for one another and I I
[32:37] like what uh Larry Christensen also said
[32:39] that there's two main things uh to the
[32:42] family and he was talking about what
[32:44] what is needed and he says there's an or
[32:46] first of all there's an order for a man
[32:48] there's a scriptural order for a woman
[32:50] there's a scripture order for uh
[32:52] children and there's a scriptural order
[32:53] for the family based on the scripture
[32:56] and they all have to be willing to
[32:57] follow the order of God and agree to
[32:59] follow the order that God has set for
[33:01] the family. That's the first thing. Can
[33:03] you say amen? They they they have to be
[33:05] willing to uh uh reverence the word of
[33:08] God and follow the word of God. That's
[33:10] the first thing because there's an order
[33:12] set by the word and there's an order set
[33:14] for men, for women, for uh for their
[33:17] place, for the children. And whatever
[33:19] that order is, they have to be willing
[33:21] to say that that man is of the home is
[33:23] saying, "Now, here's the order. Here's
[33:25] God's order." And that family has to be
[33:27] in agreement with that order. Can you
[33:29] say amen? Amen. So that's the first
[33:32] thing that that he talked about and then
[33:34] you have to submit yourself one to
[33:35] another and and as I said there's no w
[33:38] oneness that comes without
[33:40] it. So there has to be reverence for one
[33:45] another being around there has to be an
[33:48] accountability
[33:49] uh to Christ and to the word for the
[33:52] oneness to be able to work. So now then
[33:55] he says if something comes up that's
[33:58] contrary then it breaks the oneness of
[34:00] the family. So that whole thing
[34:02] something comes up and it it means that
[34:04] something comes in that's foreign to
[34:08] what the standard is and what
[34:10] everybody's agreed on. They sat down and
[34:13] say this is this is what we agree on.
[34:15] This is our this is our absolute. There
[34:17] has to be something bigger than even
[34:19] dad. That's the absolute.
[34:22] Right. Amen. There's a lot of families
[34:25] that dad is the absolute. They're
[34:26] without God and so they don't make the
[34:28] word the absolute. But but you're you're
[34:30] you're dumping out the whole creator of
[34:32] the family. You can't do that. So dad
[34:34] isn't the absolute. He's the absolute
[34:37] under the absolute.
[34:39] Okay. He's the he is in his home the
[34:41] final word. And when there's a tie in
[34:44] the
[34:45] vote. Okay. When there's a tie in the
[34:48] vote, then then somebody's got to make a
[34:50] management decision. And so somebody has
[34:52] to have the final word. just the way
[34:53] we're going to do it as a family. And
[34:54] everybody comes under obedience to that,
[34:56] right?
[34:58] But but he's under a higher absolute and
[35:01] that whole family knows about that
[35:03] absolute and he's submissive to that
[35:05] absolute. This is the way we do it. I
[35:07] shared some of those things with the
[35:08] brothers on Sunday. The way I've
[35:09] approached the message and the way way
[35:11] I've approached the word is is that that
[35:15] confidence and trust even in some of the
[35:16] hints that are said in the word of God
[35:18] and the message, there's that trust
[35:20] there. And so I bring my life obedient
[35:21] to it. there has to be a something
[35:23] higher than you that you agree upon and
[35:25] you come together in that lovely that
[35:27] lovely picture that he's looking for. So
[35:29] now uh if something comes in that's
[35:31] foreign to the standard, that's the
[35:34] thing that begins to slowly move them
[35:35] apart. And that's how we we know
[35:37] something is wrong in the family. Uh
[35:41] when someone has acted out of place or
[35:43] someone has done something that is not
[35:46] in
[35:47] harmony with the melody of God's word.
[35:51] Amen.
[35:54] Uh and it's just so many things I you
[35:56] know you can act out of place and the
[35:59] only way to repair that is to ask
[36:00] forgiveness. I just tell you tonight
[36:03] that uh at supper tonight I acted out of
[36:06] place. Isn't that
[36:08] something? I did. And I had to apologize
[36:11] to the family because you usually when
[36:14] I'm getting ready to preach, it's a good
[36:15] time not to be around everybody else
[36:17] because I'm thinking about the word and
[36:19] if anything else comes in here that I
[36:21] can't handle, that's when I become real
[36:23] tense. So, I haven't learned yet. Um,
[36:25] they usually stay away from me anyway
[36:27] during that time. But if I get around
[36:30] them, it gets tense. And so, I acted out
[36:32] of place. I got a little tough. I raised
[36:34] my voice too much at the supper table.
[36:35] had to apologize to the fa whole family.
[36:37] And you know what? Um I do believe you
[36:40] could raise your hand and say that
[36:41] happens in your home as well, right? Uh
[36:45] if it's not, let me know what you're
[36:46] doing there. But but you know what? You
[36:49] know what is the you you cut that thing
[36:52] away. You ask there's no no else no
[36:55] other way you can repair it is just
[36:56] quickly make that thing right sincerely.
[36:58] Amen. Make that thing right before the
[37:01] family sincerely and get that because
[37:03] that has damaging effects to the spirits
[37:06] of your children. Long-term effects.
[37:09] Raising your voice has long-term
[37:10] effects.
[37:12] And you have to repair that and heal
[37:14] that very quickly or it'll it'll get out
[37:16] of the way. So that's under the category
[37:18] if something comes in. Brother Bram says
[37:20] if something comes in, I can just speak
[37:22] another hour on what comes in as a
[37:25] challenge to the family that's trying to
[37:27] break up the oneness.
[37:29] Wow. And we have to be willing to
[37:32] quickly stand up against that. And it's
[37:35] lovely when everybody stands up against
[37:37] it together. Sometimes we'll have family
[37:39] meetings when things has just got out of
[37:40] control and we don't know what's going
[37:42] on here. A spirit's taken over. We'll
[37:44] sit down, everybody settle down. We we
[37:46] all know that something's wrong and we
[37:49] get out of that mode of blaming each
[37:51] other and we start blaming the devil.
[37:53] That always feels good to do that. We
[37:55] realize we're all acting different than
[37:57] we normally should act here. And so the
[37:59] devil's got in. It's time to have
[38:01] prayer. We ask forgiveness for one
[38:03] another, of course, and own up to if
[38:04] we've done something wrong. But that's
[38:05] you bring the family together. And if
[38:07] you do that, that's how a family work.
[38:08] I'm not preaching about a perfect family
[38:10] tonight. I'm preaching about a family
[38:12] that applies God's word to situations.
[38:14] They have an absolute higher than even
[38:16] daddy and they all agree with that
[38:18] absolute. This is what we do in this
[38:19] situation and we're going to do it now.
[38:21] That's what brings oneness to the
[38:23] family.
[38:25] So then he goes on to say God's purpose
[38:27] for the family. The goal he said now
[38:30] here's another thing he said to be in
[38:32] agreement. That's the key to be in
[38:33] agreement. Wow. All in agreement with
[38:35] what? With the word of God. Minds don't
[38:38] agree on everything that that in that
[38:41] way. Minds cannot agree in that that
[38:45] kind of way to bring that oneness unless
[38:47] there's a spirit and a word that they
[38:48] all agree with something greater than
[38:50] themselves. And daddy sets up the home
[38:52] that way of what the absolute is being
[38:54] God's word. And his purpose as father
[38:57] supreme was to be one with his family,
[38:59] his earthly family. And that means they
[39:01] were in agreement with one another. In
[39:03] agreement with God, in harmony with God
[39:05] in what he said and thus in harmony with
[39:08] one another. Adam and
[39:10] Eve. And here he says this. And the only
[39:12] way that they could be one with the
[39:14] family or with God was because God's
[39:18] nature was in them. So that made them
[39:21] with God's nature in them. Then with
[39:23] each other and God, they become one.
[39:25] Isn't that a beautiful picture? God and
[39:26] his family, father overall, supreme. No
[39:29] death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no
[39:30] nothing, just joy unspeakable. Never be
[39:32] sick, never have a heartache, just one
[39:34] with God. What a picture. Because the
[39:36] very nature of God was in these people.
[39:38] And therefore what they did, they
[39:40] followed just in line with God and God
[39:42] with them made them one. So I'm going to
[39:44] go back to the first sentence. The only
[39:46] way that they could be one with the
[39:48] family and with God was because God's
[39:51] nature was in them. The only way that
[39:54] this works right is if God's own nature.
[39:58] And I like that because if I preach it
[40:00] just get in line with the word, get in
[40:02] line with the word. Line yourself up
[40:03] with the word. It's not just the word,
[40:05] but the nature of the word comes and is
[40:08] living in you. Because do we obey this?
[40:11] Yes, we must. We obey we we bring our
[40:13] lives under subjection that the things
[40:15] that said in the word. But I can't truly
[40:17] do that unless the same Holy Ghost in me
[40:20] is the same Holy Ghost that wrote the
[40:22] word. So I have the same nature that
[40:24] wrote the word, the same Holy Ghost that
[40:26] sent a prophet in this hour. And the
[40:28] same Holy Ghost that told him to say
[40:29] that is the same Holy Ghost that's
[40:30] registering. And that's how I could
[40:32] easily come in under subjection to it.
[40:34] Amen. You see, so these things are by
[40:37] nature. Now, what do you do if the
[40:39] children don't have the Holy Ghost yet?
[40:41] Well, you are somewhat of a Holy Ghost
[40:44] for them in leadership until they
[40:46] receive the Holy Ghost. But we still
[40:48] teach obedience. We still teach the
[40:50] blessing of obedience and say you you've
[40:52] got to be under you're you're under my
[40:54] home. I'm following Christ. And so
[40:55] you've got to follow the precepts of
[40:57] this home. And so you you've got to do
[40:59] that. That's that's just how as for me
[41:01] in my house, we serve the Lord. God's
[41:03] blessed you to be in my home and this is
[41:05] the home. This is what we that's how we
[41:06] go about it. And so you teach that to
[41:08] them until they come into that nature,
[41:11] the nature of the word. Then it won't be
[41:13] any bucking up against it. That's true.
[41:17] Somebody who's bucking up against the
[41:19] word may be missing the
[41:23] nature of the one who wrote the word.
[41:27] And it's a miserable life to live the
[41:29] word without getting the nature of it.
[41:33] There'll never be true oneness.
[41:36] They had to have the very nature itself
[41:38] living in them in order to have true
[41:41] oneness. That's why I have too many
[41:43] people through the years, even in the
[41:45] message, that have not preached that
[41:47] enough and not preach the Holy Ghost.
[41:49] That the young people need to get the
[41:51] Holy Ghost in their life and seek the
[41:52] Holy Ghost and pray till you get it. Can
[41:54] you say amen? Because they, you know,
[41:56] we've heard these little statements, you
[41:57] know, you just believe this and you're
[41:59] fine. You just believe not enough
[42:00] preaching on the Holy Ghost. There's the
[42:01] Holy Ghost is the nature of the the one
[42:03] who wrote the Bible. It's Listen, let me
[42:06] say it this way. There's only one person
[42:07] that can live this word. Amen. And it's
[42:09] not you and it's not me. Amen. It's
[42:12] Christ.
[42:14] He comes in you and he lives this word.
[42:17] It's by nature. And if we get the same
[42:19] nature as the word, we won't have a
[42:20] problem with the word. That's right.
[42:23] Because if something registers that the
[42:25] same one that wrote it is saying it,
[42:27] same one that bring it through the
[42:28] prophet. And the prophet I mean this
[42:30] whole Bible is all the prophet speaking.
[42:33] First five books of the Old Testament is
[42:35] a prophet. That's right. Moses wrote
[42:36] them. Amen. The last half of the Old
[42:38] Testament is all the prophets. Amen.
[42:40] Then we have the ultimate prophet Jesus
[42:42] Christ, the God prophet for four
[42:45] chapters. Can you say amen? Then the
[42:46] early church starts again under a
[42:49] prophet 14 books of the New Testament.
[42:51] It's all for the mystery spoken through
[42:53] a prophet. It's all that. And so if that
[42:56] Holy Ghost God who in sunundred times
[42:59] and in diverse matters spoke to the
[43:02] fathers by the prophets and in these
[43:05] last days has spoken unto us by his son
[43:07] Jesus Christ.
[43:09] It's the Holy Ghost that was moved on
[43:11] men of God to inspire them. And so if
[43:13] that's true, the same Holy Ghost will
[43:16] register. That's the truth. I can easily
[43:18] bring my life under obedience tonight.
[43:20] Hallelujah. Now, why can't I get an amen
[43:23] some of you people?
[43:25] Was that not scripture and the truth?
[43:27] Why can't I get an amen out of you?
[43:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[43:35] So, I love that. I love that. The
[43:38] nature, the
[43:40] nature, they were one because they had
[43:43] the same nature within them.
[43:49] Pray for the Holy Ghost in your life
[43:50] above any prayer that you ever make.
[43:53] Amen. And if you already know that you
[43:55] got it, pray for more of it. You're
[43:57] going to need it in the days to come.
[44:00] And tonight, I'm saying pray for it
[44:02] because there's no true oneness without
[44:04] it. That's right. Isn't the mechanics
[44:06] that break make oneness that only lasts
[44:08] so long. It isn't order that makes
[44:10] oneness that only lasts so long. But
[44:13] it's the order and all the mechanics
[44:14] with the dynamics of the Holy Ghost.
[44:17] The nature of the word to live the word.
[44:21] Praise God. I just think that's good.
[44:22] And that's how the oneness comes. All
[44:24] have the same nature in a family. One
[44:26] spirit leads at home and it's the Holy
[44:28] Spirit. All have it or if they don't all
[44:31] have it. They agree. That's what leads
[44:33] us is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Daddy's
[44:36] under the Daddy said testified he's got
[44:38] the Holy Ghost. Dad gave his testimony
[44:40] to me. I've heard what God did in his
[44:42] life. Dad was 16 years old and he was at
[44:45] BYC and God come down and changed his
[44:48] life and he got the Holy Ghost. And
[44:50] since that time, he can testify that the
[44:52] Holy Ghost is what leads his life
[44:53] through the word of God. And so that
[44:56] kid, even if they don't have it, they
[44:57] develop confidence that this home is led
[45:00] by the Holy Ghost through daddy. Amen.
[45:02] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? This whole
[45:04] This home isn't led by daddy's own
[45:06] carnal way. This home is led because
[45:08] he's got the Holy Ghost. And that ought
[45:10] to make him say, "I want the Holy Ghost,
[45:11] too."
[45:13] Because we have to have the nature to
[45:14] have oneness. We have to be of the same
[45:16] nature of the word. Amen. To be able to
[45:18] really embrace the word like we should.
[45:22] All have to have it. All one spirit
[45:24] leads the home. They all have it. Or if
[45:25] they don't, they know what leads. This
[45:27] isn't some mechanical thing forcing
[45:29] people to agree. That's cultish. Would
[45:32] you agree? Amen. Y cults are formed and
[45:36] have great order and have a lot of great
[45:39] things that go with it, but they're for
[45:41] they're they're formed by forcing the
[45:44] people into a certain
[45:47] thing that's cultish certain without the
[45:50] nature of Christ.
[45:53] Amen. So then as we read on, his nature
[45:56] is tied to the word. His nature is tied
[45:59] to the word. My words, Jesus said, "My
[46:02] words I speak unto you. They are spirit
[46:05] and they are life." That's right.
[46:08] The nature of God is that's why we have
[46:10] to stay in the word. We have to keep
[46:11] reading the word. We have to keep
[46:12] praying with the word because there's a
[46:14] spirit in there and you want that spirit
[46:16] to come off those pages into you. I
[46:18] shouldn't say come off the pages, but
[46:19] you want God to inspire it to you
[46:21] through the Holy Ghost. You want the
[46:22] nature of the word and and so we find
[46:26] that we have to abide in his word and
[46:29] that's what brings his nature according
[46:30] to John 15. If you abide in
[46:33] me and my words abide in you shall ask
[46:37] what you will. How do we abide in
[46:40] Christ? By abiding in his word. Yes. Is
[46:44] that simple
[46:45] enough? Jesus said abide in me and I
[46:48] abide in you. Abide in his word. So his
[46:50] word is tied together with him, his
[46:51] nature. And if we abide in his word,
[46:54] then we're abiding in his nature. Then
[46:56] we ask what we will, then we can go
[46:57] forward. Then we can overcome. So when
[46:59] they left the word in the
[47:01] beginning, they left the nature of God
[47:04] too. And they could no longer have
[47:06] oneness with God or oneness with one
[47:09] another. In a moment's time, Adam is
[47:11] becoming selfish. And instead of
[47:13] standing to his wife, he's pointing and
[47:16] blaming his wife.
[47:18] What changed? The nature of the word
[47:21] left. They she broke the word Eve. And
[47:24] so now the whole picture's changed. They
[47:25] got shame and guilt on them. And God
[47:28] comes down and says, "What what's going
[47:29] on here?" I said, "The woman, it it was
[47:32] it was the chick that got us in all this
[47:34] trouble. It was her. She did it. Now
[47:37] he's supposed to be standing with her,
[47:39] right? He's supposed to be He's supposed
[47:42] to be uh, you know, one with her, but
[47:44] the oneness has been broke. And when
[47:46] oneness is broke, you'll act like Adam.
[47:49] You'll start blaming everybody else.
[47:51] That's right. You'll never own up to
[47:53] what to what you're doing. You
[47:56] something's happened. And when your
[47:57] oneness is broke, you're going to dish
[47:59] it off on your wife. You're going to
[48:00] dish it off everybody else. You're going
[48:02] to shift the blame on all the people
[48:04] that you've hurt you in life. People are
[48:06] professionals of shifting the blame.
[48:08] Okay? That's when oneness is broke. If
[48:11] they had oneness, he'd have stepped out
[48:12] with her and and said, "We did this
[48:14] together." together. But his first
[48:15] response was not we, you know, I I come
[48:17] out with her. We know later that he
[48:19] stepped out with her. But his first
[48:20] response was a carnos response without
[48:23] the nature of God. Now everything's been
[48:24] broke. And he
[48:26] says, "She did it." So then he comes and
[48:29] says the woman and she points to the
[48:32] serpent said, "He did it." They're like
[48:34] little kids being
[48:38] exposed with the cookie in their mouth
[48:42] and crumbs.
[48:43] Did you take that? No, I didn't do it.
[48:46] He did
[48:47] it. She did
[48:49] it. So when oneness is broke, that's the
[48:53] way the behavior. That's the way we
[48:55] begin to act in every home. That's
[48:57] right. You become selfish when you start
[49:01] acting outside of the oneness God has
[49:03] for you. You become selfish, right?
[49:07] You're not a team anymore. You're not
[49:09] there's no oneness anymore. So when they
[49:11] broke that, everything was good until
[49:13] something foreign comes in and it takes
[49:15] it out and foreign even foreign
[49:17] thoughts. We'll get to some more of that
[49:18] in just a minute. But the word points us
[49:21] to true oneness and brings us to the
[49:22] nature of oneness. When we're in
[49:24] agreement with something, families will
[49:26] go good for a while sometimes that have
[49:28] a goal of building an empire, but the
[49:30] goal is not the oneness of the word and
[49:32] the word of God and the spirit of God.
[49:34] And so they'll they'll they'll have a
[49:35] great business and they'll all be in
[49:37] agreement. And you'll see that like the
[49:39] tower of babel in a carnal way people
[49:41] can come into agreement right for the
[49:44] wrong purpose right for the wrong thing
[49:47] and it can create such unity like the
[49:49] world council of churches and the whole
[49:51] image under the beast is growing and
[49:53] coming to that and people are going to
[49:54] join with it denominations but
[49:56] individuals will join with it and it's
[49:57] all an anti-spirit to come against the
[49:59] word of god the true word of god but
[50:01] they'll they'll they'll gather into that
[50:03] in a false unity so you can get that but
[50:05] look at a family who builds it upon the
[50:07] sinking sands of a career or a business.
[50:11] God never intended intended the
[50:13] agreement of a family to be agreeable
[50:15] and one upon some business. They have to
[50:18] come in nature with the word of God.
[50:20] That's right. For them to be blessed
[50:22] families. This one oneness comes when
[50:25] the foundation of the family is the word
[50:27] and the nature of God living in them.
[50:29] It's the dominant thing. There's no way
[50:30] that oneness comes from different
[50:32] natures dominating. But our carnal
[50:34] nature can never match God or ever
[50:37] agrees with God's nature. It'll never
[50:39] agree with it that way. That's why you
[50:41] need the nature of God. He says you and
[50:43] your carnal nature, brother Brown says,
[50:44] he says, you'll never even agree with
[50:46] the word. You can't even get an
[50:47] agreeable spirit with the word the way
[50:49] that you are. That's why you need his
[50:51] nature to live. Can you say amen?
[50:54] Praise the Lord. So now as we continue
[50:57] on just a little bit, couple more
[50:58] minutes. I was just going to switch over
[51:01] here and speak a little bit more.
[51:04] Now he says further down into the
[51:07] message, ye in me and I in you, that
[51:08] they may be one, Father, even as you and
[51:10] I are
[51:12] one. Christ in the church, just as we
[51:15] are one, so there will be one. My words
[51:17] in you, then ask what you will, for it
[51:19] isn't you no more. It's the word that's
[51:21] in you, and the word is God. So it's
[51:23] coming in union with the word. It's
[51:25] coming in oneness with the
[51:29] word. The word was tied to the nature of
[51:34] God. So when Eve lost the word and fell
[51:38] from the word, they lost the nature. And
[51:41] when they lost the nature, they lost
[51:44] oneness. Okay, that's what happens play
[51:46] that plays out in a lot of families.
[51:49] Sometimes they fell from the word first.
[51:53] Then they fall from the spirit of Christ
[51:56] and then they lose their oneness, even
[51:58] in a marriage with one
[52:01] another. Everything is good until
[52:03] something comes up that drives them
[52:05] apart. Something foreign. And I want to
[52:07] talk a little bit more about
[52:11] that. Excuse
[52:14] me. So here's the subject he changes to
[52:17] in the oneness just for just for a few
[52:19] paragraphs. But he's talking about
[52:21] oneness one. And he says, "Now the word
[52:22] of God is a sword." Hebrews 4, the
[52:24] fourth chapter says, "So it is a sword.
[52:27] The word of God is a sword. And a sword
[52:29] is a is perfect dormant if it isn't
[52:32] yielded by a hand or a power. But it
[52:35] takes a hand to hold the sword. And the
[52:37] hand that holds his sword is the hand of
[52:40] faith." So when I preach to you that the
[52:42] family needs the word, we need to stay
[52:44] in the word. That needs to be the order
[52:45] for the home and the nature of the word.
[52:47] There's an extra step that I believe
[52:49] Brother Bram was talking about in
[52:50] oneness is that you can have a sword
[52:52] laying there all day, but it takes a
[52:54] hand of faith to pick it up. And what
[52:55] are you going to do with a sword? You're
[52:56] going to cut through some things.
[52:59] So obviously when you have the word and
[53:02] when you have when you have the sword,
[53:04] obviously there's going to be things
[53:06] that come contrary to the word you
[53:09] believe. And that's why he brought the
[53:11] symbolism that the sword is symbolized
[53:13] by the sword. The sword is the symbol he
[53:16] uses for the word of God. He could have
[53:18] used any symbol, but he used a sword.
[53:20] Why? Because you're going to have to
[53:22] fight through enemies. You're going to
[53:23] have to fight through things contrary.
[53:24] You're have to cut your way through
[53:26] unbelief like Abraham did in order for
[53:28] you to have that oneness that you want
[53:30] to have. The hand of faith, he says,
[53:33] this hand of faith,
[53:35] uh, it depends on how strong your hand
[53:36] is. Now, the hand of faith might just be
[53:39] strong enough to cut a little hole
[53:41] through the darkness and say, "By faith,
[53:43] I'm saved. Anybody who does that had to
[53:46] take a little bit of faith, a little bit
[53:47] of the sword, and they had to cut
[53:49] through those all those feelings in
[53:50] their life. Oh, stay away from that God
[53:52] stuff. Stay away from that religion
[53:54] stuff. You don't need it. You're a good
[53:55] person. And yet their heart is crying
[53:57] for God. So all those little thoughts
[53:59] they've had all their life keeping them
[54:00] from giving their heart to the Lord.
[54:02] They've got to take a little bit of
[54:03] faith with the sword and they've got to
[54:05] cut through those thoughts in order for
[54:07] them to be saved.
[54:09] He said, "You might have just a little
[54:10] faith uh just to believe and say, "By
[54:13] faith, I'm saved." That's a great cut,
[54:15] but then if that's all, the stronger the
[54:17] hand is to yield the sword, that's all
[54:18] it can cut. But if it's a strong hand,
[54:21] it'll cut plum through everything the
[54:23] devil can put out there and make every
[54:25] promise of God shine forth in the power
[54:27] of his resurrection. If it's a strong
[54:30] hand of faith, the days of miracles, the
[54:33] days of miracles, Jesus Christ, the when
[54:35] somebody says the days of miracles have
[54:36] passed, that strong hand of faith cuts
[54:39] through that thought and says it's Jesus
[54:41] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[54:42] forever.
[54:44] It cuts its way through. It depends on
[54:46] the power of the hand behind the sword.
[54:49] Now, this is important for the families
[54:52] because in their agreement and that
[54:54] being, okay, we're going to follow the
[54:56] word. We're going to be we're going to
[54:58] follow what he says. We want to pray
[54:59] that that we we have his nature in our
[55:02] lives and we want to do all this. But
[55:04] you cannot let that sword just sit there
[55:06] and say, "I believe it." There's going
[55:08] to be incidences almost every day where
[55:10] you got to have faith in that sword to
[55:13] cut through the things that are coming
[55:14] against it. A strong family has to all
[55:18] be in agreement that this is a sword of
[55:20] fa. This is a sword of the word, but it
[55:21] takes a hand of faith. So everybody in
[55:24] the family's got to be willing to bring
[55:26] up and talk about and bring the word up
[55:29] when something contrary is breaking the
[55:31] oneness of that family. Right? And I've
[55:34] had kids do it to their parents. I've
[55:35] had my kids do it to me. They get
[55:38] inspired of God. They remember what the
[55:40] word says on something and they're
[55:42] reminding daddy of what the word said.
[55:43] Amen.
[55:45] Should be most of the time the daddy's
[55:46] saying it because if nobody else says
[55:48] it, the daddy's got to say it.
[55:51] He's going to take that strong hand and
[55:53] say something's coming in here and we
[55:55] need to cut through this. That's right.
[55:57] Get back to our oneness. Can you say
[55:58] amen?
[56:00] But everybody in the family should be in
[56:02] agreement to stand up to say now we know
[56:05] something's coming contrary to what we
[56:07] stand for. That's right. There's some
[56:08] new ideas trying to float in here. and
[56:12] uh maybe even one family member has
[56:14] already embraced those ideas. That
[56:16] becomes a difficult thing, becomes
[56:19] harder. But somebody's got to stand with
[56:21] the word and be able to cut through to
[56:22] the promise of God. This is what strong
[56:24] families become is that when they not
[56:27] only have the word, but they have faith
[56:28] with the word, they got to have somebody
[56:31] that raises up and saying, "Now, what do
[56:32] we do when somebody's sick?"
[56:38] "What do we do when somebody gets a
[56:40] fever?" Right
[56:42] now, we know we have medicines. I go to
[56:45] the doctor. I was just at a specialist
[56:46] on Monday. We know we use those things.
[56:48] Brother Brandham used those things. It's
[56:49] not a sin to go to doctor. I thank God
[56:51] for them, right? But if that's what
[56:53] you're hinging everything on, you're not
[56:55] taking a strong hand of faith with the
[56:57] word because you got some promises
[56:59] laying in here
[57:01] for your healing. So, we can go get such
[57:04] in a comfort zone that that takes care
[57:06] of us that we forget faith. We forget
[57:08] his promise. And so sometimes somebody
[57:12] has to remind us in the family to say,
[57:13] "Wait a minute. We're a believing
[57:15] family. Why don't we gather together and
[57:17] lay hands on them?"
[57:20] There's a lot of families doing that
[57:22] less and less and less. And I think we
[57:23] should be doing it more and more and
[57:24] more. It would save us some money on
[57:27] medical bills.
[57:30] Not against medicine, you
[57:32] understand? But we need more faith.
[57:37] And if someone has given a word to
[57:38] somebody for their healing and they're
[57:40] still on their medicine, a lot of
[57:41] preachers have put that down. I don't
[57:43] put that down because God could heal
[57:44] them through a miracle. God could heal
[57:46] them through God, Brother Ram says, God
[57:47] can use medicine. God can have the
[57:49] healing over time. But all of that
[57:52] functions, you should never lose your
[57:54] faith in a God that is able to do it and
[57:57] give glory to God. Right? If you're
[57:59] dependent on that doctor, you're going
[58:00] to be very disappointed in life because
[58:02] they all say different things many
[58:03] times, don't they? Can you say amen?
[58:06] It's amazing how different their advice
[58:08] can be and how different their medicines
[58:10] can be and different their diagnosis can
[58:12] be. And so, listen, there's somebody in
[58:13] that family needs to have faith, if not
[58:15] all of them, to say, "This is how we
[58:17] deal with this, and we're going to cut
[58:18] through the unbelief, and we're going to
[58:20] take it before God." Just heard a
[58:21] testimony this week of God's healing.
[58:23] Somebody's been praying for my back
[58:24] because I'm feeling a lot better than I
[58:26] was last weekend. And they want me to go
[58:28] get an M MRI and all these other things
[58:30] and I may do it, but I have felt so good
[58:32] the last few days. And people texting me
[58:34] saying, "We're praying for you." I'm
[58:35] telling you, the prayers are working.
[58:37] The prayers are working. And I want the
[58:39] body of Christ as my first doctor.
[58:44] Can you say amen? I want a people of
[58:46] faith to bombard heaven for me. That's
[58:48] what I want. That's what you should
[58:49] want. That's normal in the kingdom of
[58:52] God. But oh, how Satan tries to bring in
[58:54] all the other ideas as as a as something
[58:57] that's other. If I got to move along
[58:58] here, I know I'm I got just about five
[59:00] minutes. The sword is plenty sharp. It's
[59:04] sharper than a two-edged sword that cuts
[59:05] both coming and going. And it goes to
[59:07] the marl of the bone and the joints and
[59:09] the discerner of the thoughts of the
[59:10] heart. Goes beyond the physical. It goes
[59:12] into the spiritual realm and picks up
[59:14] the thoughts of the heart and reveals
[59:15] them. The spirit of God, the word of
[59:16] God. Now, that word will cut in there if
[59:19] there's enough arm behind it to push it
[59:21] in. It's find its place and cut every
[59:23] promise out and give it to you. If you
[59:25] just got the strong enough arm behind
[59:27] it, the sword, pick it up, an arm of
[59:30] faith, grip it tight, hold on to it, and
[59:32] walk into the face of the enemy, how can
[59:34] that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in
[59:36] the presence of the eternal God? So, you
[59:38] take the sword of the word and every
[59:40] promise belongs to you, pick it up in a
[59:42] strong hand of faith, walk forward with
[59:45] it. That's why Someone needs to confess
[59:47] the positive sometimes when everybody's
[59:49] talking negative.
[59:51] You got a family and they're all in
[59:53] agreement to be
[59:56] depressed. We're agreeing we're all down
[59:58] and we're all in the
[1:00:01] mubs and for my home. Thank the Lord.
[1:00:04] There's always somebody that says, "Why
[1:00:06] is everybody so negative around here?"
[1:00:08] And they start quoting scripture and
[1:00:10] starts quoting preachers that they've
[1:00:11] heard for years.
[1:00:13] Praise God that somebody grabs the hand
[1:00:16] the sword with a hand of faith. Somebody
[1:00:19] because I tell you a lot of the faith it
[1:00:21] has to do with confession
[1:00:23] and speaking things that everybody's
[1:00:25] going they don't want to hear
[1:00:27] it but speaking things contrary to
[1:00:30] what's come in that's contrary.
[1:00:33] Amen. He's speaking God's language. You
[1:00:34] start to confess and say God's word can
[1:00:36] heal. God's word is God's promise. And
[1:00:38] that's what we do. And so pick it up.
[1:00:40] Have a strong hand of faith. If you need
[1:00:42] healing, cut it out with the word Jesus
[1:00:43] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:00:45] forever. If you need salvation, every
[1:00:47] promise in the Bible is yours. It's
[1:00:49] laying there and there, and Satan's
[1:00:50] trying to hide it from you. Satan hides
[1:00:52] his promises from you. His all the
[1:00:55] promises. Can you say, "Amen. I've got a
[1:00:57] promise I'm preaching to you to have a
[1:00:59] blessed family." Amen.
[1:01:01] I'm trying to preach out because I want
[1:01:03] your family to be happy and blessed. But
[1:01:05] you have to go home and cut through some
[1:01:06] things sometimes, right? To get to the
[1:01:08] promise that we're preaching to you.
[1:01:10] It's laying back there and Satan's
[1:01:11] trying to hide it. But take the sword
[1:01:13] and push through the darkness until the
[1:01:15] light of God shines it upon your soul
[1:01:18] and you have the promise. He will do it.
[1:01:21] And that's why it says Abraham strong
[1:01:23] was strong in faith. Abraham was strong
[1:01:27] in faith. He cut through the unbelief.
[1:01:30] that family when they see something move
[1:01:32] in that is breaking the oneness with God
[1:01:35] or each other rises up in agreement to
[1:01:38] have faith to drive it out. May God
[1:01:41] bless us with families that are growing
[1:01:43] in the strength that when something
[1:01:45] moves in foreign to what the harmony is
[1:01:49] with the melody that the family members
[1:01:51] will rise up together and say, "Let's
[1:01:53] stand against this thing."
[1:01:57] May God do it.
[1:02:00] What kind of things move in that are
[1:02:04] contrary? I'm
[1:02:10] closing. What's contrary that breaks
[1:02:13] oneness?
[1:02:17] Bitterness.
[1:02:20] Bitterness. Out of control
[1:02:23] anger is contrary to oneness.
[1:02:31] pride, putting each other down
[1:02:33] disrespectfully,
[1:02:37] building up walls to each
[1:02:39] other that you don't even want to talk
[1:02:42] to each other
[1:02:43] again. That means something has come in
[1:02:46] that's contrary to the oneness.
[1:02:48] You got to take the hand of faith with
[1:02:50] the word and cut through that.
[1:02:54] And if you don't, Satan will just keep
[1:02:57] going.
[1:02:58] He's not going to stop. If disrespect
[1:03:02] starts and it's not dealt with, it's
[1:03:05] going to keep getting more
[1:03:06] disrespectful until you have fights.
[1:03:09] You'll have physical fights. That's why
[1:03:12] you see families with abuse because
[1:03:15] there's no absolute there and no spirit
[1:03:18] of God to kill that demon of disrespect.
[1:03:24] You see he there's no limit to he just
[1:03:26] keeps going more
[1:03:28] disrespectful more more and more because
[1:03:31] his agenda friends bitterness and out of
[1:03:33] control anger I can tell you Satan's
[1:03:35] agenda isn't all this stuff or worldly
[1:03:37] things coming in the home his agenda is
[1:03:40] to break oneness his agenda is to divide
[1:03:43] the flock
[1:03:44] right
[1:03:47] it's not the issues a lot of times it's
[1:03:49] the agenda to divide I get an amen Amen.
[1:03:53] Don't forget that's his agenda. He's
[1:03:55] going to break that marriage up. He's
[1:03:56] going to break that family up. He wants
[1:03:59] to break that church up.
[1:04:02] That's what he wants to
[1:04:03] accomplish. But we're not ignorant of
[1:04:05] his devices. We've watched him all
[1:04:07] through history. We know our enemy.
[1:04:10] Amen. And when the discernment of the
[1:04:11] saints pick up on something that's we've
[1:04:14] seen this before, we know where it's
[1:04:16] going. They ought to rise up in faith
[1:04:18] and prayer and say, "We're not going
[1:04:20] there with you." Amen.
[1:04:22] There's so many things that can break
[1:04:24] the oneness. Family has to be willing to
[1:04:26] cut through by faith whatever keeps them
[1:04:29] from oneness with God or one another.
[1:04:31] They got to be willing to cut through
[1:04:32] that and come back together. Many things
[1:04:35] getting around the wrong people can
[1:04:36] break oneness in the family. Other
[1:04:38] people can draw a family member away
[1:04:40] from the rest of the family and break
[1:04:42] the oneness in the family. Can I get an
[1:04:43] amen? Yeah. The associates, the
[1:04:46] associates that that children hang
[1:04:48] around and teenagers hang around or that
[1:04:50] the parents hang around who you get
[1:04:52] with, be careful. Sometimes someone's
[1:04:54] trying to get to break up that family.
[1:04:56] Get between the marriage, get between
[1:04:58] the kids. Sometimes influencing the kids
[1:05:00] a certain way, against their parents.
[1:05:01] That's pitiful. Amen. And you have to
[1:05:03] recognize it. Sometimes influences can
[1:05:06] take them against the family or against
[1:05:09] the standards of that family. Yeah.
[1:05:11] That's what the devil is. He wants to
[1:05:13] stand against the standards that that
[1:05:15] family is setting. His ultimate desire
[1:05:18] is to divide the family. But he starts
[1:05:20] attacking the standards to a young
[1:05:22] teenager and shows them all these
[1:05:23] things. See, they don't have to do that
[1:05:25] and they're Christians and look what
[1:05:26] they're doing. And a teenager sometimes
[1:05:28] they're young. You say, "Yeah, that's
[1:05:29] right. Yeah, that's true. That's why is
[1:05:31] my family so weird and why is all this?"
[1:05:33] And so you got all that going and now
[1:05:35] all of a sudden you come back into the
[1:05:36] home. Something has come in to break the
[1:05:39] oneness. Right. True.
[1:05:43] Wrong teaching can break the oneness of
[1:05:46] a family. False doctrine can break the
[1:05:49] oneness of a family. Something said
[1:05:51] that's contrary to the word of God for
[1:05:54] this hour can break the oneness in a
[1:05:56] church and a
[1:05:57] family. Wrong teaching can be found
[1:06:00] mostly today on the internet.
[1:06:06] Remember, the Bible shows us that
[1:06:08] thoughts and words are
[1:06:11] seeds. I'm closing. I
[1:06:14] know. We got to get a clock back there
[1:06:20] someday. Seeds in the Bible represent
[1:06:23] thoughts or words.
[1:06:26] And because of
[1:06:28] that, it's not till later that we see
[1:06:33] what a seed
[1:06:35] produces. So you may not see a breakness
[1:06:37] and oneness
[1:06:39] initially, whether it be a marriage or
[1:06:41] church or family or whatever it is. You
[1:06:44] may not see it right away, but if the
[1:06:46] seeds have been planted, that's the
[1:06:49] direction it's headed.
[1:06:51] Because thoughts and words can plant the
[1:06:56] seeds of unbelief, plant the seeds of
[1:06:59] disrespect, plant the seeds of
[1:07:03] disunityity. It's not till later we see
[1:07:06] the fruit. And you must look and say, if
[1:07:09] it pulls you from Christ or the word or
[1:07:11] one another, you got to look at the
[1:07:14] fruit that the seed bears. And sometimes
[1:07:16] you don't see it till
[1:07:18] later because seeds will produce
[1:07:20] something. Jesus taught the seed
[1:07:22] doctrine in Matthew and Mark and Luke.
[1:07:26] He laid it in. Prophet laid it in
[1:07:28] towards the end of his ministry starting
[1:07:30] with spoken word. The original seed seed
[1:07:32] is not heir with a shock. Seed seed seed
[1:07:35] there. Especially towards the end of his
[1:07:36] ministry. Jesus towards the end of the
[1:07:37] ministry is laying in the seed doctrine.
[1:07:39] That's a lot of times what what
[1:07:40] religious people don't like because that
[1:07:42] when Jesus is teaching on the different
[1:07:44] seed there's a seed of one of those
[1:07:46] parables he said the seed the good seed
[1:07:48] is the children of God and the tears is
[1:07:51] what Satan swed he goes into all those
[1:07:53] parables a lot of times they don't like
[1:07:54] the seed doctrine because it it
[1:07:56] separates people into categories
[1:07:58] sometimes that's why they don't like it
[1:08:00] nevertheless he laid it in but the thing
[1:08:02] with the seed like even uh in Cain and
[1:08:05] Abel you didn't see what was in them
[1:08:07] until they grew up That's right. Right.
[1:08:09] That's why Jesus said, "Let them grow
[1:08:10] together and we'll we'll deal with it at
[1:08:12] the end." He didn't see what seed
[1:08:14] thereof until they grew up. They didn't
[1:08:16] Cain didn't kill Abel when he was a kid.
[1:08:19] But when they grew up, Cain manifested
[1:08:22] who his father was. Yes.
[1:08:25] Sometimes it's later on in the
[1:08:27] manifesting of what really is in a
[1:08:29] person will come out. Can you say amen?
[1:08:32] And so why am I saying that? Because
[1:08:34] remember, seeds can come in, but watch
[1:08:36] sometimes where it's going in the family
[1:08:38] because it's it can turn into other
[1:08:40] things. Worldly movies can break the
[1:08:43] oneness of a family. They can bring a
[1:08:45] wrong spirit in, a lustful spirit, a
[1:08:47] disrespectful spirit. Um, I've watched
[1:08:50] children if they watch too many of these
[1:08:52] uh Disney things. Uh, then all of a
[1:08:55] sudden they start disres disrespecting
[1:08:57] their parents because of how that kid is
[1:08:59] acting towards their parents in that
[1:09:01] Disney movie.
[1:09:02] And you don't think they're going to
[1:09:03] pick up it? Well, my kids are message
[1:09:05] kids. They'll never they'll never No,
[1:09:06] no. Image is more powerful than
[1:09:08] anything. And so now they start sassing
[1:09:10] you like uh Hannah Montana sassed her
[1:09:14] parents. So they can bring wrong
[1:09:16] spirits, lustful spirits. That's all to
[1:09:18] break the family. But the real agenda is
[1:09:20] to divide and break the oneness of a
[1:09:22] family. Worldly movies, music can do it
[1:09:25] as well. If you know the power of music
[1:09:27] and see the power of music can bring
[1:09:29] spirits of rebellion, spirits of
[1:09:32] disrespect. Many kinds of music can do
[1:09:35] that. Look at the agenda to try to break
[1:09:38] up your family and break your children's
[1:09:40] relationship with you. Break your wife's
[1:09:42] relationship with you to break it break
[1:09:44] up the oneness. This ought to make you
[1:09:47] just take everything to prayer as a
[1:09:50] family and take everything together and
[1:09:53] believe together. When these things
[1:09:55] begin to come in, and they will almost
[1:09:57] on a daily basis, there's some effort
[1:09:59] that the Satan has, stand together as a
[1:10:02] family and recognize it's not you so
[1:10:05] much, but it's the enemy trying to break
[1:10:07] how happy and how one your family can be
[1:10:10] in this hour. At the end of marriage and
[1:10:12] divorce, Brother Bram says, "Lord, make
[1:10:15] these families happy.
[1:10:18] Make these families whole. Make these
[1:10:20] families blessed." We have some
[1:10:21] families, they don't have daddies. They
[1:10:23] don't have moms. They they have
[1:10:24] situations where the parents aren't
[1:10:26] serving the Lord. We try to encourage
[1:10:27] them. All you saints should be
[1:10:28] encouraged them because they got a
[1:10:29] little bit of a broken up family, but
[1:10:31] God can provide. Fathers and mothers and
[1:10:33] all they need in the body of Christ. Can
[1:10:36] you say amen? We support them. Can you
[1:10:38] say amen? The sisters without husbands,
[1:10:40] we support them and the Holy Spirit will
[1:10:42] provide what's needed for them. So don't
[1:10:44] think that you're a family that can't
[1:10:46] enjoy all the promises and blessings of
[1:10:48] God. Amen. You may not have a daddy
[1:10:51] that's a godly daddy, but I'll tell you
[1:10:52] one thing, there's a greater godly daddy
[1:10:55] that'll lead your life if you'll just
[1:10:56] submit to him. There's some images in
[1:10:58] the church of father figures. There's
[1:10:59] you're going to see the images and image
[1:11:01] is everything. We're going to continue
[1:11:03] to pray that God will restore families
[1:11:05] and bring daddy's back or whatever
[1:11:07] happens. We should never forget that
[1:11:09] prayer, but don't think that you're kind
[1:11:10] of half half something until that time.
[1:11:12] You can go on with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:14] serving the Lord and God can bless your
[1:11:17] family as well. Even you single guys,
[1:11:19] you older bachelors, you're a family and
[1:11:22] God can bless your family.
[1:11:24] Praise God. Trying to include everybody
[1:11:26] here tonight.
[1:11:28] You're in the family of God. You can't
[1:11:30] get in a better family than that, my
[1:11:31] brother. Brother Tom, you don't think
[1:11:33] you have children. You don't have You
[1:11:34] got tons of children.
[1:11:37] We're all your kids, Brother Tom. We all
[1:11:40] been taught by you.
[1:11:42] Praise the Lord. You love him tonight.
[1:11:43] Let's stand together then. God bless
[1:11:45] you. Appreciate you listening. So then
[1:11:47] the family recognizes something that's
[1:11:49] going to break the oneness
[1:11:52] quickly. Get the hand of faith there and
[1:11:54] the sword of God and cut through that.
[1:11:56] Sit down together, pray together, have
[1:11:59] family altar together. We don't do it
[1:12:01] every night, but we try to once to
[1:12:04] twice, mostly about two times or three
[1:12:06] times a week, we try to get gather
[1:12:08] everybody together and all their busy
[1:12:10] schedule and school and homework and
[1:12:11] everything. Make it a priority to spend
[1:12:13] some time reading the word and just
[1:12:15] praying together. Sometimes that's all
[1:12:16] we have time for. Sometimes we get into
[1:12:18] big discussions and it goes on and on
[1:12:20] and on. And I enjoy those times. But
[1:12:22] these days you don't have a lot of time
[1:12:23] for that. But there has to be times when
[1:12:25] we come together and remember the
[1:12:27] absolute that we're holding together.
[1:12:29] And that's the thing that brings us into
[1:12:31] oneness. Amen. Father, we thank you
[1:12:33] tonight. We pray that the words that
[1:12:36] were spoken their feeble way. Uh I'm not
[1:12:39] an ortor, Lord. I I stumble and I say
[1:12:42] wrong words
[1:12:43] sometimes, but I pray that you'll put
[1:12:45] them together in the spirit of what
[1:12:47] we've brought here tonight. And I pray
[1:12:50] like brother Brandon prayed, make these
[1:12:51] families
[1:12:53] happy. Make
[1:12:55] these sons of God and daughters of God.
[1:12:58] Mold them into the image that you want
[1:13:01] to see in the last days. We're not in
[1:13:03] Luther's day and Wesley's day or
[1:13:05] Pentecost. You didn't call us to those
[1:13:08] ages, but you called us to even
[1:13:10] something higher in the last days, Lord.
[1:13:12] That the expression of families and
[1:13:14] marriages could grow to a place of being
[1:13:16] so restored that there's the glory of
[1:13:18] God is displayed in those things. Not
[1:13:22] the world not blending in, not trying to
[1:13:26] walk on the fence, be on the fence, but
[1:13:29] a clear distinction to the rest of the
[1:13:31] world. This truly is the manifestation
[1:13:35] of what Christianity was supposed to be.
[1:13:38] That's my desire for my family. Lord, I
[1:13:41] I just pray that it would be so. Lord,
[1:13:44] I'm not the best father that I've wanted
[1:13:47] to
[1:13:48] be, but I can learn more from you
[1:13:51] because you're the ultimate heavenly
[1:13:53] father. You're the perfect father.
[1:13:57] I wonder if the families could just get
[1:13:59] together and just lay your hands on one
[1:14:00] another before I continue to pray.
[1:14:02] Husbands and wives
[1:14:05] and got some friend there. Just lay your
[1:14:07] hands on one another as we continue this
[1:14:09] prayer. And I want us in this series to
[1:14:11] not only hear things of the word, but
[1:14:13] pray that God would strengthen the
[1:14:17] fellowship and
[1:14:19] the the families in this church. The
[1:14:22] strength of the church will be the
[1:14:24] strength of the families and
[1:14:26] marriages. So, will you pray with me
[1:14:28] that God whatever Satan's got in and
[1:14:30] tried to destroy, that he would restore
[1:14:32] and make it what it was meant to be.
[1:14:35] Would you pray with me? Lord, just
[1:14:38] thought that we'd gathered together and
[1:14:39] lay hands on one
[1:14:40] another. Many families here, Lord, and
[1:14:44] there's some family members that's went
[1:14:46] astray. There's some, Lord, that are
[1:14:49] struggling, Lord, just trying to find
[1:14:51] themselves. There's some that's walked
[1:14:53] away completely. But Lord, we pray for
[1:14:55] them tonight. The families that have
[1:14:57] been broken up. I pray that you will
[1:14:59] bless them. Lord, I pray that you, if it
[1:15:02] be in your will, to restore those back
[1:15:04] to the faith again. Lord, you're you're
[1:15:07] a miracle working God. You're able to do
[1:15:09] that. When a child cries for their daddy
[1:15:12] and mommy to be saved and to be in the
[1:15:15] faith again, Lord, you can hear that
[1:15:17] cry. Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll do
[1:15:20] it. And all of these families
[1:15:22] represented in our church. Some not able
[1:15:23] to be here tonight, but strengthen them.
[1:15:26] Lord, there's been some families go
[1:15:27] through through some great turmoil,
[1:15:29] great turbulence this year, just hard
[1:15:31] times. And Lord, we're we're on the
[1:15:33] phone with them and we're we're burdened
[1:15:35] with them, Lord. And we don't want to
[1:15:37] see things go the way they go sometimes.
[1:15:39] So we just pray to you, Lord, our
[1:15:42] heavenly father, that you would step in
[1:15:45] and to to to do a miracle for these
[1:15:48] families, Lord. Some are coming out of
[1:15:50] the woods and coming out of things that
[1:15:51] they've been through for years. I
[1:15:53] rejoice in that, Lord. I'm thankful,
[1:15:55] Lord, that over time, you bring them
[1:15:58] back to that that that true spirit of
[1:16:02] God that they really had confidence in
[1:16:04] to start with. Thank you, Lord, that
[1:16:06] you're the God of restoration. Bless
[1:16:08] these families, Beth, their children.
[1:16:10] Fill these children with the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:12] Fill these lives with your Holy Spirit.
[1:16:14] I pray, Lord, my children, Lord, fill
[1:16:16] them with the Holy Ghost, the true
[1:16:19] genuine spirit of God that can say amen
[1:16:22] to the word of God and live the word of
[1:16:24] God. Lord, give your inheritance. You
[1:16:27] You're trying to hand it to us, Lord.
[1:16:28] But may we cut through all the barriers
[1:16:31] that's keeping us from our inheritance.
[1:16:33] And one of those things is to have a
[1:16:35] blessed family. We hold on to that
[1:16:37] promise, Lord. The promise of Abraham
[1:16:40] that you gave him that all the families
[1:16:42] of the earth will be blessed. May we
[1:16:45] have the faith and life of Abraham to be
[1:16:47] strong, to not stagger at the promises
[1:16:50] of God and to go through, cut through
[1:16:52] the unbelief that we feel around us, so
[1:16:55] many influences and doubts and unbelief.
[1:16:58] May we cut through it, Lord, and stand
[1:17:00] upon your word. Thank you for this
[1:17:02] precious time. And I pray that you put
[1:17:04] these seeds in their hearts, Lord, and
[1:17:06] it'll bring a fruit of strong, healthy
[1:17:10] families. We believe that it will in
[1:17:14] Jesus precious name. Amen. Everybody
[1:17:17] said,
[1:17:18] "Amen." Believing together in one mind,
[1:17:21] and one accord, hopefully you can say
[1:17:24] that, "Brother Paul, what you preach
[1:17:26] tonight is from the Bible. It's the
[1:17:29] absolute of the word. It's not me. But
[1:17:31] pointing to that, we can all be in
[1:17:33] agreement together in one mind, one
[1:17:34] accord. That's the goal that we're
[1:17:36] shooting for. Got a song, Raj? Ro, you
[1:17:39] don't have one? I don't have one either.
[1:17:41] Praise the Lord. Well, we
[1:17:45] can the body of Christ
[1:17:47] again. Couple verses of that body of
[1:17:50] Christ. Uh, Brother
[1:17:52] John.
[1:17:56] Amen. Oh, the beautiful
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:07] mighty rising from
[1:18:10] death into life.
[1:18:14] The glory of
[1:18:17] God most
[1:18:21] high in
[1:18:24] fullness in the
[1:18:28] beautiful body of Christ. Sing it one
[1:18:32] more
[1:18:33] time. Oh, the beautiful.
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:41] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:18:43] humble our hearts, Lord, before you for
[1:18:47] this image that we're looking at,
[1:18:48] Father.
[1:18:50] We're not what we should be, but thank
[1:18:51] God we're not what we used to
[1:18:54] be. Father, we
[1:18:58] transfor you and your change
[1:19:02] us. Hopefully, Lord, I place that in
[1:19:04] this before the people tonight and they
[1:19:07] can see it. You change them. Change
[1:19:10] them.
[1:19:12] Oh, the
[1:19:15] beautiful body of
[1:19:21] Christ rising from death into
[1:19:28] life. Glory of God.
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] most
[1:19:34] high is for the spirit is I in the
[1:19:42] beautiful body of
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:48] Christ. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:19:50] clap of praise. Thank you for what he's
[1:19:52] done, what he's promised us in his
[1:19:56] word. These are your promises, too.
[1:19:58] These are all your promises, too. Not
[1:20:00] just brother Paul's. You have to cut
[1:20:02] through the enemy and get to your
[1:20:03] promises. You want a better family? Cut
[1:20:05] through the enemy's unbelief and come to
[1:20:07] that. I believe it. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:08] Look at that. Quarter to nine. I'm
[1:20:10] getting you out on a Wednesday night.
[1:20:12] Get in the car. Get through this cold.
[1:20:14] Get home. You see, it's just not that
[1:20:16] bad. I'm I'm respectful to the time
[1:20:18] unless the Lord comes and takes me
[1:20:19] further on and on. I'm trying to be
[1:20:22] respectful of kids that got home work
[1:20:23] and the next day and how tired we get.
[1:20:26] And it's always so refreshing to spend
[1:20:29] this time on Wednesday night at midweek
[1:20:30] and just come and take what what have we
[1:20:32] been just less than two hours. But look
[1:20:35] at the value. Look how special it's
[1:20:38] been. Just to feel refreshed. I don't
[1:20:40] know about you, but I need to be
[1:20:41] refreshed.
[1:20:43] Amen. So, make it a priority to come and
[1:20:46] fellowship with us on Wednesday nights.
[1:20:47] And I'll make a well, I won't make a
[1:20:49] promise, but I'll do my best to get you
[1:20:51] out in a decent time. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:53] Shake one other's hand. God bless you.
[1:20:55] Got a song now. Raj. All right.
[1:20:58] I'm so
[1:20:59] glad I'm a
[1:21:02] part of this family.
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:21] Jous as we
