[0:24] and one of the pharisees
[0:28] desired him that would eat with him
[0:33] and he went into the pharisees house
[0:37] and sat down to meet and behold a woman
[0:41] in this city which was a sinner

[1:19] with
[1:19] the hairs of her head and kissed his
[1:22] feet and anointed them
[1:24] with the ointment
[1:27] now when the pharisees which had bitten
[1:30] him
[1:30] saw it he spake within himself saying
[1:33] this man

[7:59] in that crocodile-infested water
[8:02] he called for gabriel to stand on that
[8:04] little basket
[8:06] and said when that crocodile sticks up
[8:08] his nose you just take your foot and
[8:10] push him right back down
[8:12] and when it gets into the whirlpools of
[8:14] life
[8:15] lo you help him through that now dear

[8:46] i love you god bless you
[8:50] you're the one who did all the work
[9:00] hallelujah
[9:06] we were in north carolina i hope i've
[9:09] got a few minutes
[9:11] we were in north carolina at brother joe
[9:13] green's camp meeting
[9:14] your father preached there many times
[9:18] and and i had spoke that evening
[9:22] and and uh
[9:25] as i had preached you know and i i felt
[9:28] a resistant spirit
[9:30] in the building and i actually asked
[9:32] them to stop resisting
[9:34] it was two preachers and i actually
[9:37] asked them to stop resisting that
[9:39] you know because one person can hinder a
[9:41] service
[9:43] and after a bit i just told them i said
[9:44] i'm gonna call your name if you don't
[9:46] quit resisting
[9:50] so it eased up and i was able to preach
[9:53] and i said you know if god can't operate
[9:55] out here
[9:56] he'll operate behind the curtain
[9:59] i didn't know what i was saying but as i
[10:02] finished up that evening
[10:04] and a couple of people came for prayer
[10:05] sister charnock
[10:07] from south africa came and she's gone to
[10:10] be with the lord now because of an
[10:12] accident but
[10:14] she had sugar diabetes and diabetic
[10:17] and god healed her there then we just
[10:20] stepped behind the curtain as i was
[10:22] standing behind the curtain there and
[10:24] walking to
[10:25] the guys that were going to take care of
[10:27] me and
[10:28] and as i was walking there something
[10:31] turned me in
[10:32] you know that something's the lord and
[10:34] there's a young lady named caitlyn said
[10:36] in there
[10:38] and she was desiring a child
[10:41] and the lord just told her a little
[10:43] something very secretive in her life and
[10:46] then her husband nathaniel greene and
[10:49] they
[10:49] stood together and i said god will give
[10:51] you a child
[10:53] do you know it was exactly one year to
[10:55] the day
[10:56] that god gave them that child
[11:00] his name is charlie
[11:03] [Applause]
[11:10] there was a sequence of events that took
[11:12] place and
[11:14] and uh another one was prayed for and
[11:17] another young man had fought the
[11:19] call of the lord for 17 years and from
[11:22] that point he's
[11:23] he has preached several sermons and
[11:25] doing extremely well
[11:27] his wife his home has just completely
[11:30] changed
[11:31] brother guido von de brunt you know
[11:33] brother quito brother guido was from
[11:35] belgium an
[11:36] incredible friend of mine and he was in
[11:38] his 60s
[11:40] and he had come to that meeting
[11:43] and and he had came down he was standing
[11:45] in the back he wanted to shake my hand
[11:47] and so
[11:48] uh i just i just i just turned to guido
[11:51] and told him that
[11:53] something that was going on in his life
[11:55] and
[11:56] and it was a lie and i told him that now
[11:58] that's a lie that
[12:00] they've told on you guido and then in a
[12:02] moment i just said ditto there's a train
[12:05] coming for you
[12:06] don't you be afraid to get on that train
[12:09] and the lord took him home in just a
[12:11] couple of months and
[12:13] just in a very peaceful way and there
[12:16] was a friend of mine that was standing
[12:18] there brother joe green's brother-in-law
[12:21] he's he was a he was a wonderful man he
[12:24] was one of the good old boy club
[12:26] he'd sat in church for decades married
[12:28] to brother joe's sister
[12:31] grew up he had been up under brother
[12:33] henry green
[12:34] you know to come to church is one thing
[12:36] but to really know god
[12:38] is another and he had said in a pew for
[12:41] decades and and
[12:45] he was standing there and he was this
[12:46] kind of friend to me i
[12:49] one time i was there and i was speaking
[12:51] immediate and it was hunting season he
[12:53] said
[12:53] i've never let nobody hunt in my stand
[12:57] not even my own voice but i would like
[13:00] for you to go sit in my stand
[13:02] for a couple of hours well i found that
[13:05] very special
[13:06] and so i i was able to do that
[13:11] but that day as he saw all of those
[13:13] events take place
[13:18] he made this statement i can serve a god
[13:22] like that when he had seen god in action
[13:26] he said
[13:27] i can serve a god like that i
[13:30] wrap terry up in my arms and i begin to
[13:32] pray
[13:34] it don't take a year to change a man's
[13:38] life but i began to pray and
[13:41] terry became a real christian
[13:44] sister betty would say this said i
[13:47] walked
[13:48] into the building with one terry
[13:51] and i walked out of the building with
[13:54] another terry
[14:04] terry didn't know that he was had cancer
[14:07] in his body
[14:08] in a month he would find out that he had
[14:10] cancer
[14:11] and it was eating he was eating through
[14:13] his chest wall and
[14:15] terry i would stand and preach his
[14:17] funeral
[14:18] in just a few months you see god was in
[14:22] preparation
[14:24] like this building
[14:27] terry was to set at the table but he
[14:30] needed to meet god
[14:33] and before he would even know that he
[14:35] had cancer
[14:36] he would meet the lord jesus that could
[14:38] give him a new body
[14:42] you see that was a tremendous healing
[14:44] that took place
[14:46] that he could go to meet the lord and
[14:49] know that everything was all right amen
[14:52] god bless you i hope you didn't mind me
[14:54] sharing a couple of those things with
[14:56] you
[14:56] this morning
[15:06] brother branham would tell us in many
[15:08] sermons
[15:09] take us to this story
[15:13] so i would like for you not to finish
[15:14] before i do i won't be long but
[15:18] brother i'm had such a way to be able to
[15:20] watch god operate in a vision
[15:24] you see he can look back into the garden
[15:25] of eden and see what took place
[15:29] the reason the prophet could stand there
[15:31] and do those things
[15:32] is because he was seeing god in action
[15:37] polaroid or rca or any of those
[15:41] movie producers were not the first
[15:45] videographers of the world
[15:48] god's been taking videos since the
[15:50] beginning
[15:52] and just like with moses moses was able
[15:55] to look back in the garden of eden and
[15:58] and watch even watch even abraham and
[16:01] watch
[16:01] noah and listen once you've seen
[16:04] something
[16:05] you become a witness of it so
[16:08] brother branham is allowed to not just
[16:10] read scripture
[16:11] but he's allowed to look into it
[16:15] now he could look backwards and see them
[16:19] but he could look forwards and see you
[16:24] did you catch that it's incredible to be
[16:28] in the
[16:28] in the book he could look backwards and
[16:32] see abraham
[16:33] sitting at a tent and sarah was in the
[16:36] house but he could look forward
[16:38] and see you
[16:44] brother brandon said the pharisee
[16:48] he would have been one of the richest
[16:49] ones
[16:52] and he desired
[16:55] god can even use a pharisee
[16:59] he desired that he would have jesus to
[17:02] come to his house
[17:06] he desired that he would bring him there
[17:09] now his desire
[17:11] and his thought process was that he
[17:14] would bring him there
[17:15] to make fun of him but he didn't realize
[17:19] god had a plan and god would even take
[17:24] his
[17:24] plan and even a wrong desire
[17:28] because god had a seed
[17:33] and god is really interested in the seed
[17:38] that seed is eternal
[17:41] so he would send a courier a man to go
[17:45] find
[17:45] jesus brother branham said that he
[17:48] looked all day and he went up in the
[17:49] hills and the valleys and he went all
[17:51] over the place
[17:53] and he finally found jesus and he was on
[17:56] the top of a hill
[17:57] and he had been speaking for quite a
[17:59] while
[18:01] and he was just speaking to the people
[18:03] and
[18:04] maybe some miracles were taking place
[18:06] and he was speaking to the children
[18:09] no doubt god had such a way an
[18:12] atmosphere to people just enjoyed
[18:15] sitting
[18:16] all day just listening to his voice
[18:19] there was something about his voice that
[18:22] they were drawn to
[18:24] there was something about his atmosphere
[18:27] whenever
[18:28] jesus is there everything seems right
[18:33] it just seems right when jesus is there
[18:37] no matter if you're a christian or
[18:38] you're a sinner the atmosphere of jesus
[18:42] changes the atmosphere to where that
[18:45] god knows how to take care of our lives
[18:50] jesus was just conducting business on
[18:53] the hill
[18:55] this man no doubt comes and brother adam
[18:57] so eloquently puts it that
[19:00] he begin to tell the disciples that
[19:03] i i got to get to jesus to because i
[19:06] have an invitation for him to come
[19:10] and those disciples see the meeting
[19:12] that's going on and
[19:14] what all is happening here no doubt
[19:17] thousands of people are gathered because
[19:20] and there's healings taking place
[19:22] homes being changed lives being
[19:25] touched the eloquent words that are
[19:28] coming forward
[19:30] and your master a pharisee that
[19:34] that jesus hates
[19:38] is inviting him for supper
[19:44] well he won't come he won't come no
[19:47] he won't be even found in that house
[19:52] no doubt peter told him said go away
[19:55] go away just go away but i've i've got a
[19:58] job to do i got to get to him
[20:02] this man is so enamored about his master
[20:06] being such a great man and wealthy man
[20:09] and
[20:10] having such a great house and going to
[20:12] have the
[20:13] dignitaries of the all the city there
[20:18] when he gets in the presence of jesus
[20:21] doesn't take advantage
[20:25] because no doubt he is now has an
[20:28] opportunity
[20:30] that thousands of those people would
[20:32] love to have
[20:33] to stand right in front of jesus and
[20:35] have a moment
[20:38] how many people have come and had a
[20:41] moment with jesus
[20:45] how many people are setting pews like
[20:47] you're sitting in today
[20:49] and had an opportunity with a moment
[20:52] and missed their opportunity
[20:57] because they had an agenda maybe they
[21:00] came to criticize maybe they came to
[21:03] to make fun maybe they come to to do
[21:06] different things
[21:10] and they're right in front of emmanuel
[21:16] and have a moment
[21:20] to where he turns his attention to them
[21:25] and they're more enthused
[21:28] with their job
[21:39] let me just say the biggest house in
[21:41] this world
[21:42] is not worth missing god
[21:47] the best job in this city
[21:51] is not worth missing god
[21:56] relationships with uh the most beautiful
[21:58] woman or the most
[21:59] beautiful man or handsome man or the
[22:03] wealthiest man or prestigious man
[22:06] is not worth missing god for
[22:11] don't squander the opportunity
[22:20] and he tells him of his master he tells
[22:23] him that he would like to have you to
[22:24] come and eat
[22:26] with him and he would like to entertain
[22:28] you
[22:29] would you come
[22:33] much to the disagreement of his
[22:38] disciples
[22:40] i'd love to come
[22:44] i'd love to come to your house brother
[22:47] baby said
[22:48] he always comes where he's invited
[22:52] the invitation is very important the
[22:55] reason a lot of people don't get
[22:56] much out of church is because they
[22:59] personally
[23:00] haven't invited him
[23:05] are you with me are you with me now you
[23:08] must invite him because he'll come
[23:11] it's just like your home he wants to be
[23:14] the king of your home
[23:16] he'll take care of your finances
[23:19] he'll take care of your relationships
[23:21] he'll take care of your children
[23:24] he'll take care of the behind the scenes
[23:26] stuff but you got to make him first
[23:29] place in your life
[23:33] and listen he's not god he's not your
[23:36] lord unless you make him your lord
[23:39] it takes total surrender to god
[23:43] surrender of ambition surrender of will
[23:45] surrender of choices
[23:47] surrender of attitude it takes
[23:49] everything to surrender to god
[23:57] i'd love to come tell him i'll be there
[24:02] can you imagine the chatter of disciples
[24:08] because they can't see past what they
[24:11] see
[24:13] they can't think past what they think
[24:19] one morning i woke up and i felt that
[24:22] special presence in the room
[24:26] and i was being told many different
[24:27] things by doctors
[24:30] so i just stood up in the in my bedroom
[24:34] and i stood there
[24:36] and i just i just worshiped in the
[24:39] presence of the lord
[24:41] and these words came to me look
[24:46] past what you see
[24:51] think past what you think
[24:56] and the next morning i immediately went
[24:58] to looking at the unseen
[25:01] hallelujah god was reminding me look
[25:04] past your health issues look past what's
[25:08] being said to you
[25:10] think past what you're being the
[25:11] thoughts that are coming let me just
[25:13] remind
[25:14] you today sometimes you've got to look
[25:16] past the difficulties of life
[25:21] you've got to think past the thoughts
[25:23] that satan drops in your
[25:25] mind the negative thoughts the unbelief
[25:29] that comes
[25:30] get past those barriers
[25:37] jesus makes his way that way
[25:40] you know this story very well he makes
[25:42] his way in that direction
[25:46] the pharisee would have named simon
[25:50] would have the best of the best
[25:54] he's going to have the dignitary of the
[25:56] dignitaries there
[25:58] he's going to have the uppity ups
[26:03] of the community there brother branham
[26:06] said that the poor people couldn't get
[26:08] in
[26:09] but they would stand and look to see who
[26:11] was there
[26:14] and they would smell the aroma of the
[26:16] food
[26:19] that was there to be served and there
[26:21] may be some nuggets that they could get
[26:23] a little bit later on
[26:25] but they were there to see what they
[26:27] could see and
[26:29] and smell that aroma
[26:32] now they would love to be in but they
[26:34] wasn't invited
[26:37] the disciples wasn't invited but
[26:40] jesus was invited
[26:43] like brother branham said if i'd have
[26:45] been a foot worse flunky i'd have been
[26:47] watching for jesus to come
[26:50] it was the lowest position in the city
[26:53] but to be able to wash his feet
[26:56] to make him welcome at the house if i'd
[26:59] have been able to be there
[27:01] he said i'd have been looking over the
[27:02] shoulders of people watching for jesus
[27:05] to come over the hill
[27:06] i'd have been watching for him to come
[27:08] i'd have been in great expectation
[27:10] knowing that jesus had been invited
[27:13] no doubt he had to wash the mayor's feet
[27:16] or no doubt he had to wash the
[27:17] dignitary's feet
[27:18] but i don't wanted to wash jesus's feet
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:23] but because of the influence and
[27:25] instruction
[27:26] they had been told
[27:30] don't welcome him don't welcome him
[27:33] don't wash
[27:34] him don't don't don't anoint him with
[27:36] any perfume
[27:38] don't welcome him as a matter of fact
[27:41] turn your back when he comes in
[27:46] now let me just ask you you've been at
[27:48] places like that
[27:51] and you've felt rejected before
[27:55] you know when people are
[28:02] but for you and i this is not our world
[28:08] this is not where i'm a citizen of i
[28:11] love america just like
[28:12] just like our prophet loved america but
[28:15] she's rotten
[28:18] you know i'm identified with her glory
[28:20] i'm identified with her shame
[28:22] but she's rotten i've been asked over
[28:26] the last few months to be a
[28:28] actually got a letter while i was here
[28:30] they want me to be an advisor to a
[28:32] senator
[28:33] uh in his close circle i'm not
[28:36] interested in the job
[28:39] i feel honored to be asked that but i'm
[28:41] not interested in the job
[28:43] i want no part of that i want no part of
[28:45] that world
[28:48] are you with me it's just because
[28:50] somebody there's a man we know him well
[28:52] there's a man that has a thirst for
[28:54] reality
[28:56] are you with me thank god there's still
[28:58] some people that
[28:59] that want reality
[29:05] i think sometimes people are walking to
[29:08] a room
[29:12] like different around dignitaries or
[29:14] special people
[29:16] they put on a little deal they're not
[29:19] themselves they
[29:20] kind of put on a little deal they're you
[29:23] know they act different
[29:25] because so and so is in the room
[29:28] jesus is really not interested in
[29:30] so-and-so
[29:34] you know sometimes we think attorneys
[29:36] are so great doctors are so great
[29:41] it's just a job it's just a profession
[29:47] it's just what it is if i got an
[29:50] attorney here this morning
[29:52] i'm sorry jesus had a disdain for them
[29:56] to be honest with you
[29:59] so don't get mad at me i've got lawyers
[30:01] in my church too
[30:03] but you know you're not impressed with
[30:05] that
[30:07] i think sometimes we become impressed
[30:10] with the wrong thing
[30:17] i was flying into nashville one time and
[30:19] there was a
[30:20] girl that had set beside me on the on
[30:22] the airplane
[30:23] she was balled up in a knot and went to
[30:25] sleep
[30:27] and we flew to nashville it was evening
[30:31] flight and i flew into nashville and
[30:33] there was roses on two different ways
[30:36] and a red carpet rolled out for her
[30:42] i walked down the same red carpet like i
[30:46] [Applause]
[30:48] just
[30:52] and she was winning the emmys or
[30:54] whatever it was that
[30:55] in country music she was winning all the
[30:57] grammys
[30:58] that particular night and one won seven
[31:01] different awards that night connie
[31:04] helped me with the name
[31:06] i don't know anyway don't matter
[31:13] the local pastor picked me up and he
[31:14] said i that was really for you
[31:19] [Applause]
[31:33] jesus walks in
[31:40] he kind of surveys the room
[31:48] he walks in
[31:51] his feet still stink
[31:56] his robe has not changed
[32:01] he walks in and he he knows i got to be
[32:04] here
[32:06] this ain't a place where i'm welcome but
[32:08] i got to be here
[32:11] and he walks over and takes the place
[32:13] and he sets down
[32:16] now i want to just i want to remind you
[32:18] now
[32:20] he is the most important person in the
[32:23] room
[32:26] and i want to say this to you today he's
[32:29] the most important person
[32:31] in this room
[32:39] now they were all about their deals
[32:41] their businesses their
[32:43] their talking their doctrines
[32:46] and he was sitting there
[32:50] just watching he was not
[32:54] waiting for one of them
[32:58] you see in just a few feet away
[33:01] there was a girl that had a
[33:04] very trapped chained
[33:08] lifestyle
[33:11] and he was the door
[33:15] he was her way out
[33:18] and something moved on the inside of her
[33:22] if they won't make him welcome i will
[33:27] if they won't make him welcome i will
[33:31] and she runs home brother branham said
[33:34] and she goes up in her closet
[33:36] and she gets her little sock out and
[33:38] it's everything that she
[33:40] owns god don't want to hack
[33:44] he wants it all
[33:47] are you with me now he wants all of our
[33:50] lives
[33:51] and so she goes and gets it and she goes
[33:54] to the local store
[33:55] and she goes and says i must have an
[33:58] alabaster box
[34:00] incredible meanings of that alabaster
[34:02] box
[34:04] and this man that's behind the counter
[34:06] brother brandon brings it out
[34:08] so you don't have to buy the best
[34:12] remember how he talks to her when
[34:13] brother brown talks he says
[34:16] he says you don't have to spend that
[34:18] much money
[34:20] but i want the best i want the best
[34:26] you see she wasn't going to squander her
[34:28] opportunity
[34:30] with him
[34:36] she takes that box
[34:39] now i want to just say this to you as
[34:41] she carries that box
[34:45] in all of her sin stains
[34:52] she carries that box
[34:58] like it's the greatest thing that's ever
[35:02] been held in her possession
[35:05] because it was
[35:08] and she carries this box and she begins
[35:11] to make her way
[35:14] and she finds herself at his feet
[35:22] now let me just say no doubt
[35:26] that that she thought in the back of her
[35:28] mind
[35:29] what if he don't accept me
[35:34] what if he turns me away
[35:39] but she falls at his feet
[35:43] and let me just say this to you so many
[35:45] people don't want emotion
[35:46] in this day they've not met jesus
[35:52] so many people want to make this message
[35:55] something that it's
[35:56] not this will never fit the world's
[35:59] standards
[36:01] we'll never become a bunch of dignified
[36:04] who's who we're the pride of jesus
[36:10] christ
[36:12] so take your starchy shirt and burn it
[36:16] take your self-real gospel and throw it
[36:19] away
[36:21] let yourself be so broken that you can
[36:24] find yourself at his feet
[36:30] come on church humble yourself because
[36:34] let me just say this to you without god
[36:37] you're just
[36:38] dust
[36:42] without god you're forgotten
[36:46] i want to remind you maybe this is going
[36:48] out into the airways and this don't
[36:49] pertain to anybody
[36:51] you say well i can do this without god
[36:53] let me just say the next generation is
[36:55] the only one that holds your memory
[36:59] and after another generation you're just
[37:02] forgotten in the dust
[37:04] and your body goes back to the dust
[37:07] you'll be
[37:08] judged in that body and i don't care if
[37:11] you own the whole
[37:12] city let me just say this to you without
[37:14] jesus in your life
[37:16] you're lost and you're on your way to
[37:19] hell
[37:20] but it don't have to be that way it
[37:24] don't have to be that way
[37:39] this woman had a lot of scars
[37:42] this woman had a lot of complexes
[37:47] but she was willing to overlook herself
[37:49] for long enough
[37:51] to get into the presence of jesus christ
[37:55] and this man had an atmosphere that was
[37:57] so powerful
[37:58] to it broke her into tears so much so
[38:02] that she could wash
[38:03] his feet
[38:08] feet that had manual feet that had dust
[38:22] that was god speaking to you to sing
[38:24] that song today
[38:41] those men those men said
[38:46] if he knew who she was
[38:51] no doubt simon said to that his neighbor
[38:53] that was standing beside
[38:55] him they call him a prophet outside
[38:58] maybe even the messiah
[39:00] but if he knew who she was
[39:04] if he knew who she was let me just say
[39:08] he did know who she was
[39:12] he did know who she was and she was the
[39:16] reason he accepted the invitation
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:21] are you with me now take this in
[39:25] this is more than 2 000 years ago that's
[39:28] why this invitation was accepted
[39:35] that's why this room he chose to come
[39:38] and dwell in this room
[39:40] the city around you may not accept him
[39:44] and may make a lot of fun of what's
[39:46] going on here
[39:47] but jesus come to this room
[39:50] because he knew you were coming
[39:57] glory
[40:00] hallelujah
[40:05] she began to worship him she ignored
[40:08] everything that they were saying
[40:11] she began to worship him he was
[40:14] accepting her worship
[40:17] hallelujah oh sin stains was being
[40:22] washed all of her life
[40:25] her past she would never
[40:28] be the same ever again in her life
[40:34] or if you can have one of those services
[40:36] in your life
[40:37] i'm not talking about 10 years ago 20
[40:39] years ago 30 years ago
[40:41] god wants more he wants more of your
[40:43] worship
[40:46] oh it's just for the kids now he's still
[40:48] looking for gray-headed people
[40:53] [Applause]
[41:05] simon
[41:09] i have somewhat to say to you
[41:13] now it's him and jesus
[41:19] now for the great king of the house
[41:25] simon's now in a spot he's invited jesus
[41:29] to embarrass him
[41:31] and now he's about to be embarrassed
[41:38] and he begins to tell him almost a
[41:40] riddle
[41:43] who would be the most thankful
[41:46] a man that was forgiven little or one
[41:50] that was forgiven much
[41:52] and jesus asked it to him in a way that
[41:56] demanded an answer
[41:59] you see your life will demand an answer
[42:04] when god comes you're there you're
[42:06] either going to go one way or the other
[42:08] way
[42:10] are you with me now you remember the
[42:13] days of noah there was people that
[42:15] gathered on the outside of the ark
[42:18] and no doubt they believed for a while
[42:20] or associated for a while
[42:22] but then they began to make fun and
[42:24] ridicule but they didn't move off
[42:26] just in case
[42:30] but they didn't realize it wasn't noah's
[42:33] message it was god's message
[42:36] i want you to understand this isn't
[42:37] brother paul's message
[42:39] even brother branham's message this is
[42:42] god's
[42:43] message it's the message of the lamb
[42:48] he's going to have a bride he's here
[42:50] with purpose
[42:52] and this dedication is with purpose
[42:56] and this woman comes into the room to
[42:58] dedicate her
[42:59] life to god and bring her best
[43:03] offering that she could give to him
[43:06] she had no more that she could give and
[43:09] she gives herself to him
[43:15] jesus does something that that pharisee
[43:18] doesn't believe in
[43:20] that pharisee requires a literal lamb
[43:24] he requires a literal turtle dove he
[43:27] requires
[43:28] the the becoming under the laws of that
[43:30] pharisee system
[43:32] but jesus forgives her
[43:37] and remember forgiveness is
[43:38] justification
[43:40] it's as though you never did it in the
[43:42] first place
[43:44] others may look at her as steal as a
[43:46] harlot
[43:47] but when god looks at her it's like
[43:50] she's a virgin
[43:52] and her life will never be the same
[43:57] are you with me get past yourself
[44:02] i don't care what you've done in your
[44:04] life
[44:05] the lord jesus the blood of jesus christ
[44:09] can wash away the most horrible
[44:13] degradated sin that there is and you can
[44:16] rise not to continue to walk that way
[44:19] but you can walk in a newness of life
[44:22] and then there's no
[44:23] there for no condemnation
[44:29] hallelujah you don't have to beat
[44:31] yourself over the back and
[44:33] pull up those dry bones let me just tell
[44:35] you
[44:36] just tell the devil they're forgiven
[44:40] they're in the sea of forgetfulness and
[44:44] god that's rich in mercy god himself
[44:47] can't find those sins no
[44:49] more
[44:49] [Applause]
[44:53] from rahab to tamar all the way through
[44:56] the scriptures
[44:58] even to this woman at his feet
[45:03] he can look past all
[45:06] of her sins
[45:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[45:22] who was the most important in the room
[45:32] a prophet would bring it so eloquently
[45:34] that through the ages
[45:36] jesus went to the churches and they put
[45:39] him out
[45:42] i'm coming to an end now
[45:47] he goes because they invite him
[45:51] then they won't keep his word so he has
[45:54] to leave
[45:59] i'm going to go maybe above my own
[46:01] authority now but
[46:03] if this is okay
[46:07] but this pulpit and these pews
[46:14] we want him to come
[46:18] we won't put him out
[46:21] we won't put him out we'll do our best
[46:25] to make him comfortable
[46:27] whatever he wants we'll do our very best
[46:32] to give him everything that we've got
[46:36] to give him herself and what greater
[46:40] to do than give
[46:44] oh brother ron but those lafontaines are
[46:47] just a bunch of singers
[46:51] and all they want to do is sing
[46:57] well wonder who made them that way
[47:05] i told you it's going above my authority
[47:07] right there
[47:11] wonder who put that in there
[47:21] i wonder why he built them that way
[47:24] because he wanted it that way
[47:30] i've said this about brother paul if i
[47:32] could sing like him
[47:33] i wouldn't preach
[47:38] he asked me this morning is that a
[47:39] compliment or not a compliment
[47:45] but if you heard me sing you would know
[47:47] why
[47:48] that i say that the way that i say that
[47:53] i don't think it's fair that god gave
[47:55] him
[47:56] all of that
[48:00] i get a thought i get an inspiration
[48:04] lord
[48:05] i don't know where g is
[48:08] or a but god places
[48:12] in the body that which he needs
[48:18] now maybe you can't sing but you can
[48:20] worship in a different way
[48:23] and maybe it's just lifting your hands
[48:25] or clapping your hands or
[48:27] or raising them before god and your
[48:30] voice if they built a bird
[48:36] to be able to sing before god
[48:43] we had a bear come to my house this
[48:45] morning according to my video
[48:47] at home all my cameras around my house
[48:50] we had about a 400 pound bear visit my
[48:52] house i did not invite him
[48:56] he ate my cat food this morning
[48:59] i didn't invite him but he's going to go
[49:03] and somewhere and wallow and
[49:06] worship the lord in a certain way
[49:09] and if god could build the animals to
[49:12] worship the lord
[49:13] and the trees and all the pauline that's
[49:15] out there to worship the lord
[49:17] he built you as a special instrument
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:25] what does psalms say everything that
[49:27] hacked breath
[49:31] you have an excuse not to worship
[49:34] god if you're dead
[49:38] but the that's the only excuse
[49:41] so when you come before him it's our
[49:44] opportunity and responsibility
[49:48] [Applause]
[49:54] people don't understand even an amen is
[49:56] important
[50:00] even an amen is important because the
[50:03] amen is
[50:04] it brings it on the other man said if i
[50:06] i had a dog
[50:07] and he said i if i was hunting and there
[50:10] was an old skunk
[50:12] said he hated skunks and he would go
[50:14] into a thicket i'd just
[50:15] rub him and i'd tell him
[50:21] and he said that's kind of way it is
[50:22] with preaching
[50:25] and you're sitting there and the worst
[50:27] devil i know stinker i know is the
[50:29] the devil himself and when you say amen
[50:44] you see we're not washing his feet
[50:48] literally but we've come and worshiped
[50:51] him
[50:53] never find ourself coming to his room
[50:58] and not making him welcome i don't care
[51:01] what our circumstances is and i
[51:03] understand sickness i understand turmoil
[51:05] and a family
[51:06] i understand all of that but when we
[51:08] come to his house
[51:11] that ought to be in our house as well
[51:13] there ought to be a lot of time in your
[51:15] life
[51:16] to where you stop and you make him
[51:18] welcome
[51:19] because church starts at home and then
[51:22] he comes here
[51:39] i was sitting one day with a man
[51:44] in a group of people
[51:48] and i just looked over at him and
[51:51] i didn't know him very well i just knew
[51:54] who he was
[51:55] the brother too i
[51:58] didn't hardly know his name
[52:01] god just dropped something in my heart
[52:05] while we were all just kind of talking
[52:08] i just spoke to him put my hand on his
[52:10] knee and i said
[52:13] why don't you just let that little habit
[52:14] in your life go
[52:19] and he said this was his response
[52:22] it's not bothering anybody
[52:27] it's not hurting anyone
[52:33] i'm still with the dedication thought
[52:35] now
[52:38] and i looked at him and i said sure
[52:41] about that
[52:43] i said when you when your children grow
[52:45] up when they watch you with that little
[52:47] habit in your life
[52:49] whenever you try to instruct them
[52:51] they're going to say
[52:52] daddy
[52:58] and when they get old enough you'll not
[53:00] be able to do anything with them
[53:04] and they'll leave and go every which
[53:05] away
[53:09] i sat there a moment
[53:13] and i said after your children are gone
[53:17] your wife is going to look at you and
[53:18] say you never was an overcomer
[53:21] sat in church all these years and and
[53:23] i'm talking about decades
[53:31] and your wife's gonna look at you and go
[53:33] you couldn't overcome
[53:35] and she's gonna leave with another man
[53:38] that'll never happen brother ron
[53:41] i've got the luxury of about 25 years
[53:43] later
[53:44] children's gone
[53:49] wife is gone
[53:53] but you know what what's the constant
[53:54] through it all that little habit
[54:01] you say well that'll not hurt anybody
[54:03] that'll not hurt nobody
[54:05] you see god stopped me and made me tell
[54:07] this story because you're sitting here
[54:09] this morning
[54:12] let me just say that little habit will
[54:14] get between you and god
[54:18] listen and you can put the name on it
[54:20] because you don't need your name called
[54:21] out it's already been called out
[54:24] jesus is looking at his feet and saying
[54:26] let that little habit go in your life
[54:29] let it go give me all your life just let
[54:33] it go
[54:35] just let it go listen let this moment
[54:39] you don't need a prayer line let this
[54:42] moment
[54:44] this moment i'm talking about right now
[54:46] say lord i i'll give that to you and
[54:49] i'll not do that no more
[54:55] you see the jesus that's in the room
[54:58] just looked up at simon
[55:06] and this is your opportunity to let it
[55:08] go
[55:12] because this is more than a service this
[55:15] is a dedication of a temple
[55:20] this is the dedication of your temple
[55:25] i don't know how it is at your house but
[55:27] when we're going to have company over
[55:30] that house gets a scrubbing
[55:35] my wife points out things that i haven't
[55:38] seen
[55:42] there's weeds going down the driveway
[55:44] that i drive past
[55:46] i don't drive past nothing no more but
[55:50] they won't let me drive that's probably
[55:53] a good thing
[55:55] i don't i don't see those weeds they
[55:58] need to be cut before company comes
[56:03] things need to be placed and clean
[56:05] before company comes
[56:07] before jesus comes
[56:14] he's allowing you time to get it
[56:16] cleansed
[56:18] he's allowing you time to get it washed
[56:21] he's allowing your time to get your mind
[56:24] right
[56:25] your spirit right your attitude right
[56:28] are you with me now
[56:31] he's allowing you time to get it right
[56:37] because he's a discerner of the thoughts
[56:38] and the intents of the heart
[56:42] and he knows everything already about
[56:44] you
[56:45] but he's pulling his spirit to you to
[56:47] worry that you've got a moment
[56:54] aren't you glad that god gives you a
[56:56] moment
[57:00] a special moment
[57:05] i'm going to finish now if he was in
[57:08] brother branham's meetings
[57:11] and you were sitting in the hundreds and
[57:12] hundreds of people
[57:15] and all of a sudden he called your name
[57:22] that would be better than having the
[57:24] president of the united states
[57:27] to want to have you to come to the oval
[57:29] office
[57:30] i've stood in the oval office it's a
[57:32] small room
[57:35] a lot of illusion but it's a small room
[57:38] but i'd much rather be where jesus is at
[57:48] and he begins to just take a moment with
[57:50] you and
[57:52] he just begins to spend a few seconds
[57:56] now you'll spend the rest of your life
[57:59] thinking about this moment i've made eye
[58:03] contact with this entire audience
[58:05] but now it's with you
[58:10] sometimes jesus just so cares about our
[58:13] life
[58:14] until he wants a moment with you
[58:17] billions of people on the earth
[58:21] and he wants a moment with you
[58:24] it's pretty incredible isn't it
[58:28] what's your name joe
[58:32] god thought so much before the
[58:33] foundation the world he would invite you
[58:36] to this room
[58:45] dignitaries all over this city
[58:48] but he would invite you to this room
[58:51] because he wanted to have fellowship
[58:53] with you
[58:55] it's pretty incredible in it incredible
[58:59] the god that said let there be
[59:05] and he he watches over the entire
[59:08] entire universes they say there's 70
[59:11] universes
[59:12] and he watches over all of that and he's
[59:15] so special
[59:17] he wants to be with joe today
[59:26] it's pretty phenomenal
[59:30] and a lot of people would like to be joe
[59:34] yeah because jesus cares
[59:38] about every situation in your life
[59:41] you see i don't know you but jesus sure
[59:44] does
[1:00:02] i'm glad he took time to come to my
[1:00:04] house
[1:00:10] i realize this isn't a shouting sermon
[1:00:15] and it may have not been eloquently put
[1:00:20] but jesus walked into this house this
[1:00:22] morning
[1:00:25] and he orchestrated the whole events
[1:00:30] and joe didn't know that his name was
[1:00:32] going to be called
[1:00:34] in the service but you see
[1:00:38] god watches over joe like he did that
[1:00:42] baby before it was ever born
[1:00:48] are you with me are you with me
[1:00:53] can i just share one more thing with you
[1:00:56] i feel like i'm taking too much time and
[1:00:58] maybe i am
[1:01:01] i was in louisiana
[1:01:05] and i had preached a meeting
[1:01:08] you know i'm the only one to tell my
[1:01:10] story so is it okay if i tell my story
[1:01:16] and so was in the meeting
[1:01:20] and in the prayer line i i just kept
[1:01:22] hearing this voice
[1:01:24] wait for jessica wait for jessica
[1:01:29] and so i waited i i prayed and we prayed
[1:01:32] for
[1:01:32] hundreds of people and then sister
[1:01:35] jessica
[1:01:36] walks up jessica martin
[1:01:39] she walks up and the lord spoke to her
[1:01:44] i see your son and you're here for your
[1:01:48] son
[1:01:49] and her son was away from god and i'm
[1:01:51] telling this for a reason
[1:01:53] and your son's away from god
[1:01:57] god's going to bring him home
[1:02:01] that boy was way out in the world but
[1:02:04] god who's rich in mercy watched over
[1:02:06] that evening
[1:02:08] and that boy is now a real christian
[1:02:10] dedicated for
[1:02:11] god married what about your loved ones
[1:02:17] what about your loved ones once won't
[1:02:19] you claim them to sit on that pew right
[1:02:21] there
[1:02:30] they take me back to the room brother
[1:02:32] aaron oglesby takes me to the room
[1:02:36] aaron's about a six foot five boy many
[1:02:38] of you probably know him
[1:02:40] and i just turned to him and i said
[1:02:41] aaron you'll never be the same
[1:02:44] kind of like gideon last night you'll
[1:02:46] never be the same
[1:02:48] god's called you to preach the gospel of
[1:02:50] jesus christ
[1:02:52] and aaron just throws his arms back and
[1:02:55] back against the wall and just collapses
[1:02:57] against the wall i sat down on the bed
[1:02:59] and i said i see a baby i see a little
[1:03:02] boy
[1:03:03] andrew was attending to me and he said
[1:03:04] not me daddy not me
[1:03:10] my daughter couldn't have a child
[1:03:14] then doctors had told her since she was
[1:03:16] a teenage girl she'd never have a child
[1:03:18] because she was born with a deficiency
[1:03:20] and her and it was a certain way that
[1:03:22] her womb was ma and she could never
[1:03:23] carry a child
[1:03:25] but god looks past the impossibilities
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:34] hallelujah i saw the vision of that
[1:03:37] little boy
[1:03:38] and in that vision god gave me his name
[1:03:41] and i held that very close to my heart
[1:03:46] her husband had a wreck and it crushed
[1:03:48] his pelvis
[1:03:49] to which that i was there when the
[1:03:51] doctors told him said
[1:03:53] i if you was probably ever wanting a
[1:03:55] child you'll probably never have a child
[1:03:57] now
[1:03:57] it's totally impossible because all of
[1:03:59] that's been crushed
[1:04:00] i still held on to the vision
[1:04:04] there's my daughter it was impossible
[1:04:06] for her to have a child
[1:04:07] my son-in-law it's impossible for him to
[1:04:09] have a child
[1:04:10] but god had already showed me the vision
[1:04:12] he was going to they were going to have
[1:04:14] that child
[1:04:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:20] god rich in mercy i
[1:04:23] i talked to that little baby this
[1:04:25] morning
[1:04:28] hallelujah
[1:04:29] [Applause]
