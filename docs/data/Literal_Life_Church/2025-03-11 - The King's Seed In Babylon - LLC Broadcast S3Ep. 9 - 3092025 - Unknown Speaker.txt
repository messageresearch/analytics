I want more I want more I want [Music] more I want more Jes Jesus I want [Music] more I want [Music] more I want [Music] more I want more Jesus let's just read this and see if we can learn something from it here this morning Daniel chapter 1 verse one in the third year of the reign of jerim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jerim king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shar to the house of his God and he brought the vess into the Treasure House of his God and the King spake unto aspenes the master of his unic that he should bring certain of the children of Israel now there are many that went in this Exile from Jerusalem because they rebelled against God there was about three stages stages of it and uh there was many thousands that were taken out of Jerusalem taken captive for 70 years taken right to Babylon but in this he asked for certain ones and he said bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed everybody say King Seed King seed so Nebuchadnezzar's choosing the king's seed the royalty out of all of them and of the princes children so now he's picked the children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans which is the language of Babylon I'm going to take these young people that have grown up in this home that believed in Jehovah and I'm going to indoctrinate them change their language change everything in fact verse 5 says the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were the children of Judah Daniel hananiah Michel and Azariah unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Bel chazar hananiah Shadrach uh Misha of meach and Azariah AB Indo which were all Babylonian names I want you to notice here the enemy we think when he would go to Babylon that he's trying to actually make them uh at the start worldly but no the the deeper agenda was to change their diet change their language and change change their names which means to change their identity right that's a pretty subtle subtle enemy amen okay so it's not come on we're having fun over here in Babylon that's party no this was a different type of subtle Act of the enemy for our children but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself God brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix and the prince of the Unix said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which is of your short of your sort then shall he make me in danger my head to the king then said Daniel to Meltzer and I'm just going to skip ahead cuz I think you should know the story from Sunday school and on that Daniel challenged him saying you feed them the king's meat you feed us pulp and just just eat we won't eat the king's meat test us for 10 days verse 14 so he consented to them in this matter and proved them 10 days and at the end of the 10 days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter In the Flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat thus Meltzer took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams So Daniel was a prophet so you can expect that but for all of them what did God give them discernment understanding Revelation and you know what you need to live in Babylon more than anything Revelation understanding wisdom to know white and right and wrong and he anointed them with that kind of anointing so they could live in this subtle uh perversion now at the end of the days that the king said he should bring them in that the prince of the Unix brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like Daniel hananiah Michel and Azariah therefore stood they before the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them these four 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm Daniel contining even un the first year of King Cyrus I want to speak this morning on the king's seed in babyon if you don't mind this morning I I really uh feel led to give Satan a real heavy punch this morning because how many knows that Satan is real how many knows he's here in the service this morning yeah he's he's very faithful to come to church more faithful than some of you he's always here uh but then you know there Comes A Time sometimes when you get a bit irritated at the enemy and I might say this that sometimes he's not reminded uh of the things that have happened for 6,000 years of history of God's people and Satan uh allowing these things to happen of trials and tribulations and all kinds of Temptations and sometimes they even fall by it Israel's in Babylon because she rebelled against God and so they were in captivity 7 years so they have their mistakes they have all these things but but I just want to give the enemy a punch this morning and really uh speak to him because you know uh we realize that Satan I guess I was thinking of it this morning I was asking my son-in-law the differences between Alzheimer's and and uh dementia and uh because I I find that Satan is probably has the worst case of dementia and Alzheimer's as anybody because you look in the Bible and you see every time he has tried to bring God's people into situations that I'll get them they're finished it's over it's done and every time in history God has stood by his people every time I want to remind the enemy of that as you know I've been breaking down this series of the time of trouble and I've spoken so many details by the help of the Lord of how hard it is right now now this is a season we live in that's very different than even a 100 years ago even 50 years ago and so with the discernment of the word and my studies we can really tell things like they are we can really say how bad it really is I can go all the into the perversion of Hollywood I can go into the perversion and and the the corruption in politics I can expose the demon power that's behind Hollywood and politics and everything else and I can give the reason why there is unprecedented uh TR with mental illness and depression in this hour it's not like it was a 100 years ago but it's very different now I can go into the darkness and Isaiah said Gross Darkness will be upon the people here we are in 2025 and here you are living in that type of gross Darkness with all this mental illness and all this extreme of what Satan brings and yet you have to ask the question why did God put us here why did he allow me and I can just say God knew of this darkness and he has you here for a [Applause] reason he has you here in this age in this time and it's not to be somebody who just survives there's going to be some Overcomers can can I get a hand this morning there's going to be some Overcomers I got young people in this assembly they're say I don't want to be a statistic I don't want to be like the rest of the millions of young people who fall and give their lives to lasciviousness and all kinds of lust I want to stand for God for Holiness in this hour and Satan I want to remind you we have some young people that are like these men that are standing up in the midst of Babylon I could have them stand up today they're standing for Holiness they're standing for the word of God they believe this message with all their heart some of them are 1314 which is what Daniel's friends they're about history shows are about 14 years old when they had to leave their families leave their comforter of their homes be taken captive and put into this situation some of our groups uh this morning are that age I love seeing these young men down here that are Amen in me these young men this is like this is wonderful to have young men they don't need to be here this world would like them the last place this world and Satan would like to have them is in this church listening to this preacher and listening to God but guess what there's some men on the front row sitting here this morning so excuse me but I'm going to put some of this in Satan's face this morning sometimes you got to you can't let Satan's howling and his intimidation sometimes you take something that God has done and you put it right in Satan's face and sometimes we can talk so much about the conditions that we live in that it can become overwhelming just talking about it and we can can get a bit too negative and actually we might even gloat a little bit that we know so much about the hour we're living in message Believers we understand it we know it we can glow a little bit we understand all that's going on and all those bad people out there and we don't have perfect people here and you're a human being so you're susceptible to Temptation without the holy ghost in your life you'll fall just like them you make mistakes like them and so uh because of that negative and how it becomes kind of depressing to talk I want to uh I want to take some things this morning that would encourage us and also as I said I want to put some things in the face of the devil and Ry I'd like to remind everyone this morning that God has a purpose for putting us under these conditions God has something that he's doing that's a whole lot bigger than the conditions the demon Spirits the demon power your mind that gets overloaded none of this would be happening unless God allowed it to get this bad it would not happen unless God allowed it what happened in your life this past year it wouldn't happen unless God allowed it so it's time that we grow up and look at things through God's eyes and say my God knew everything that would happen my God allowed it for a purpose I don't want to say he created it but he allowed it because God has an agenda for your life he has an achievement he has something that he needs to get out of your life he has to crush the rose he has to crush because you can't get to what's inside of you until you're crushed a little bit and the sweet smell of God starts to come from your life I want whatever is in me of Christ I want it to be squeezed squeezed so it comes forth and he can God can breathe it in there that's what I want from his life not bitterness not hatred not I'm a victim but that surrender that sacrificial life that God just breathes in and say look at what I've allowed my children to go through and what I'm getting back as a sweet smelling Savor to God they're back in church again lifting their hands and saying God I have nothing left to do but to worship to dance to praise Hallelujah so this morning you can lift your hand you can worship you can dance if you want to and I guarantee you the devil don't like that when you're dancing and shouting and saying God is good to me he's been so good to me Satan I'm not just a survivor of leoda I'm an overcomer and I will overcome these [Music] [Applause] things I want to remind you that the troubles come because God allowed it second Corinthians and it's and his seed his seed will always Triumph 2 Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the Savor of his knowledge Revelation making manifest the Savor of his Revelation by us in every place we serve a God that will always cause his seed to Triumph are you listening this morning I don't care what you've been through I don't care what you're going through now we serve a God that will cause his people his seed to Triumph in everything and this last part he said to make manifest what's he's manifesting something the Savor of his knowledge of his Revelation and Satan's going how did they do that I did everything to them how did they come in that they're still shouting they're still praising God Satan he's befuddled I don't understand these people I've been dealing with them for 6,000 years and every time they come out of it it's because Revelation and knowledge the Savor of his Revelation is bigger than the trial it's bigger than Satan's Temptation because he said Revelation he said when you have it the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it somebody shout hallelujah he's messing with something that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it they never will Satan are you listening you don't get the final [Applause] say if it's if it's the Royal seed if it's the king seed but I believe I'm preaching to the king seed this morning if it's the king seed Satan I want to let you know you never you never get the final say you never get the final word you have never got it and you won't get it with this bride as well you'll never have the final say you'll never get the final [Applause] word you know what the final say final words is when people are bickering and they keep going they keep going till somebody wants the final say the final word husband and wife sometimes going back and forth cuz they're fighting I want the final word the final word and Satan has done that throughout history and he does in our lives but he needs to know he the the devil's dimentia right the devil's Alzheimer's I don't have Alzheimer's I have halfers I remember half of stuff and other stuff I remember but Satan's really bad because he's not looking Satan you're not looking at the whole history here and the Bible proves over and over again every time you messed with God's seed Satan every time you do it I'm probably going to get attacked this week by the enemy cuz I know he don't like this but I'm going to tell him what the truth is whether he listens anyway every time you mess with God's seed God got the final say let's go back to the beginning he never got the final say with Eve he thought man I have done the worst damage to the human beings this is going to this is going to be Perpetual sin I've got Eve to fall from the word of God and now something has happened to to turn all this around Satan's gloating a little bit God comes out and says I'll curse you to the ground and he says your seed he said your seed will bruise his heel prophesy and even right there it prophesize but her seed Jesus Christ will bruise your head you know what he's saying you're gloating right now over sin that came in the garden but he said I want to tell you my seed will get the final say Amen it's what he's saying that's what he's saying he's letting them know early early on job with job Satan didn't get the final say Hallelujah with Abraham Satan didn't get the final say with Joseph Satan didn't get the final say Joseph put in prison Joseph looks like everything was all the dreams everything that's spoken over his life was going to finish he's put in prison but then he's brought out then he's accused then all this stuff happened that he never even did he was innocent the seed of God is innocent through the blood of Jesus Christ Satan comes and makes him do something and accuses him and all of a sudden now the it looks like the Innocence is gone but God stood for Joseph and raised him to the right hand of pharaoh and listen now you can't mess with God's seed it's throughout history Satan you can't mess with God's seed and come out with the final say with David's life God had the final say with the disciples God had the final say with the church that had raised up at Pentecost then that seed went in the ground and went into churchianity and denominationalism for many many years but listen listen it didn't end up the Dark Ages God had the final say he said it shall be light about the evening time Isaiah prophesied he said it's going to go in the ground the church is going to become so churchianity and so lost it seemed like and yet and yet yet he says it shall be light in the evening time you know what he's saying Satan you won't have the final say over my church there'll be a Revival at the end there'll be a restoration back to the original Pentecost there be the power of God come back in the people again God has always had the final say he was kicked out of the garden he was kicked out with ishmail he was kicked out all the way through twins of every Revival the enemy was kicked out he was kicked out after the resurrection he was kicked out of the early church he was got this history of being kicked out everywhere and Revelation says one day he said the accuser of our Brethren will be cast out of those other dimensions and you'll never hear that accusing voice ever again you know the Satan when Satan reminds you of your past you remind him of his future say let's have a little bible study I've had a little one this morning with them want to remind you here's you remind me of my past but here's your future that you will be cast out you've been cast out of the garden cast out at the end kicked out his history is being kicked out of things why can't you give him the boot more on Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesday why can't you give him the boot kick him out he's used to it for watching our service today if you
