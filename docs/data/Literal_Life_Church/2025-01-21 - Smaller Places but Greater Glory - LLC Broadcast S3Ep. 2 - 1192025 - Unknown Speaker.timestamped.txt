[4:04] away I'm laying it down on the
[4:10] alar now I'm giving my life
[4:19] for the very least I can
[4:25] offer is my
[4:33] so here I S
[4:36] [Music]
[4:37] today giving my
[4:41] [Music]
[4:43] life hey guy chapter 2 and verse three
[4:45] says who who is left among you that saw
[4:48] this house in her first glory and then
[4:50] we'll skip to verse n as he prophesies
[4:53] about this Temple the glory of this
[4:56] latter house shall be greater than of
[4:58] the former saith the Lord of hosts and
[5:00] in this place will I give peace sayith
[5:03] the Lord of hosts and then over here in
[5:05] Zechariah 4 is also a prophecy
[5:09] concerning the same thing and this is
[5:11] when they were building rebuilding the
[5:13] foundation it is also a prophecy um
[5:16] verse six we'll start then he answered
[5:18] and spake unto me saying this is the
[5:19] word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying
[5:22] not by might not nor by power but by my
[5:26] spirit sayith the Lord of hosts so you
[5:28] can you can just imagine imagine now
[5:30] that uh this is a bit of training or a
[5:33] bit of teaching the people of God to not
[5:36] just expect certain things and expect
[5:39] the power of God and him to work a
[5:41] certain way because God can do something
[5:43] in the simple things and uh it's not by
[5:46] power it's not by might so if him he
[5:49] says that we can kind of get in the mode
[5:51] that God only does something through
[5:53] might or by power but he he he he has
[5:57] different ways that he works sometimes
[5:59] in it's every bit as powerful when you
[6:01] speak of the power of the world then God
[6:03] doesn't use that when you speak of the
[6:05] power of the might God doesn't that but
[6:07] by his Spirit he can do anything amen
[6:09] can you say Amen who art thou oh great
[6:12] Mountain before Zer rubbable Thou shalt
[6:14] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[6:16] The Headstone thereof with shoutings
[6:18] crying Grace Grace unto it it's prophecy
[6:21] for our day moreover the word of the
[6:23] Lord came to me saying the hands of
[6:24] zerbo had laid the foundation of this
[6:27] house his hand shall also finish it and
[6:30] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[6:32] has sent me unto you for who hath
[6:35] despised the day of small things all of
[6:38] this prophecy talking about the
[6:40] rebuilding of the temple the foundation
[6:42] he's teaching it's not by power it's not
[6:45] by might it's by my
[6:47] spirit and don't you dare despise the
[6:51] day of small things because in this hour
[6:55] God can be every bit as powerful in
[6:58] small things we we'll miss it if we're
[7:01] looking just for big things the reality
[7:03] is is there that when he said uh in the
[7:06] scripture here look and compare when he
[7:09] said look at those of you who are with
[7:11] the first temple Solomon's Temple and
[7:13] there wasn't too many of them left but
[7:15] he said those of you who were there when
[7:18] the first temple was built and what
[7:20] happened and the glory of the Lord
[7:22] coming down and just not just that but
[7:24] the magnitude of it and the beauty of it
[7:27] and he's having them look and compare
[7:29] what you see with this first house and
[7:31] compare it with this second house this
[7:34] Temple that they begin to build uh the
[7:37] second one was not as big it was a
[7:40] smaller Temple and it it certainly did
[7:43] not have the Splendor of Solomon's first
[7:45] temple now Herod later on took the
[7:47] second temple he enhanced it he enlarged
[7:50] it he and he he did many things to it to
[7:53] make it bigger but when these brothers
[7:55] and sisters first seen it the second one
[7:58] being built the foundation and being
[7:59] built they actually were uh were going
[8:02] wow this this has nothing to compare
[8:05] with the first Temple and so I want you
[8:07] to just notice now uh if we look at
[8:10] things from the we can learn a lesson in
[8:12] this if we're looking at the glory of
[8:14] the past and what God has done in the
[8:17] past we could miss that God could do
[8:20] something greater in the future and so
[8:21] he's teaching them that look at this and
[8:23] compared with the glory of the first
[8:25] temple and then he ends it with a
[8:27] prophecy saying I can tell you and it's
[8:29] not just a prophecy about the final
[8:31] Temple for the Jews it's actually a
[8:33] prophecy for the bride because it's the
[8:35] the the latter Glory will be even
[8:38] greater than what you've seen in
[8:40] Solomon's Temple so the prophecy for the
[8:43] future Glory would be greater and
[8:45] imagine those people said wow what a
[8:47] prophecy is that because we were there
[8:48] at the beginning you couldn't get much
[8:50] greater glory than what we felt that day
[8:52] it was so powerful the preacher couldn't
[8:54] even preach the Holy Spirit came down in
[8:57] that place so they're looking and
[8:58] comparing it but then they're looking at
[9:00] the second building and saying that that
[9:02] does not have the Splendor it's not as
[9:05] big it's it doesn't have the uh uh the
[9:09] the the the way or the manner the beauty
[9:11] that was before and if you would have
[9:13] judged it by the second temple you would
[9:16] have thought there's no way that God
[9:18] could put more glory in this than the
[9:21] first one but that's judging
[9:24] carnally that's looking at the outside
[9:26] remember brother Bram says the beauty of
[9:28] the church is not the building it's the
[9:30] character of the people God looks at
[9:33] things different than what we do and God
[9:36] as we've been preaching can bring his
[9:38] glory in situations and so we're if
[9:41] we're mindful to be obedient to the Lord
[9:43] and walking in step with him we're
[9:45] available any time for God to do
[9:47] something in us and it doesn't have to
[9:50] you don't we don't have to blow our horn
[9:51] about it God just gets the glory can you
[9:53] say Amen so Herod expanded it he
[9:55] enhanced it later but the ones who
[9:57] looked at the at the first time they're
[9:59] say wow this is not as big and so it's a
[10:02] kind of a lesson tonight on human nature
[10:06] especially among Christians and I'll
[10:08] just say that it it's it's human nature
[10:11] to live in the glory of the
[10:14] past and belittle what we have now oh
[10:19] there's nothing can compare to all that
[10:22] God has done in my life before there's
[10:25] nothing compared to that that camp
[10:27] meeting that we had here that that year
[10:30] boy was that a year I don't mind
[10:31] testifying of it but sometimes we're
[10:34] looking back and thinking God can't do
[10:36] it again or God can't do more and you
[10:38] you don't realize you can belittle God
[10:40] you can put God in a box you can
[10:44] underestimate what God can do we've got
[10:46] to look forward and in this prophecy he
[10:49] said the glory in this Temple at the end
[10:51] at the latter will be a greater glory
[10:53] I'll tell you I don't want what I want
[10:55] had back then I want more than what I
[10:57] had back then I want to be close closer
[10:59] to the Lord now I want more of his glory
[11:01] to be how many would raise your hand
[11:03] tonight in agreement I don't want to
[11:05] reach back to that that was glorious but
[11:07] I want something more they garnish the
[11:09] tunes and oh wow the prophet Isaiah the
[11:12] prophet Moses he brought us the law and
[11:15] they're just going oh well this is great
[11:17] and they live in the past they live in
[11:19] the rivie mirr and they say nothing is
[11:21] ever as great as it is as it was back
[11:25] then Jesus said you garnish the tombs of
[11:27] the prophet and rejected what he was
[11:29] doing when he was around when Christ the
[11:31] word was around in in in the middle of
[11:34] them and God was in his fullness
[11:36] standing right and you can't get much
[11:38] greater glory than God put in all of
[11:42] himself catch it now God poured
[11:46] everything that he was into that one
[11:48] vessel not a temple not a building God
[11:52] took all of himself and put it in one
[11:56] individual all of the glory of God why I
[12:00] I'll take some of it I know it comes by
[12:03] measure but I'll take all the measure I
[12:04] get but that was powerful that he
[12:07] actually put it not in a building but he
[12:09] put it in one individual and he's
[12:10] standing there and he's telling them you
[12:12] garnish the tubes of the prophets and
[12:14] you can't even recognize the glory of
[12:16] God in his Temple right
[12:17] now because why human nature is to lift
[12:20] up he made strong statements like a
[12:23] greater than Solomon is here now so
[12:26] something greater was there in Jesus day
[12:30] then Solomon because they're going wow
[12:33] Moses David Solomon that's our guys
[12:36] that's the Glory Days there was it was a
[12:38] millennium when Solomon had the kingdom
[12:41] there wasn't no Rome around or anything
[12:42] he was he was a superpower all the
[12:44] nations feared him they looked back to
[12:47] the glory and what happened in that
[12:48] Temple they were they were gazing upon
[12:51] it and always looking back at it and yet
[12:53] Jesus is saying a greater than Solomon
[12:56] is here right now if we would have a
[12:58] reverence for that then we wouldn't be
[13:00] looking back and saying oh I wish I
[13:02] could work up that feeling I had at Camp
[13:04] 20 years ago no you'd be saying a
[13:06] greater than Solomon is here now he's
[13:08] greater tonight than he's ever been can
[13:10] you say amen and he's able to do above
[13:12] and beyond what we ask or think for our
[13:15] lives Hallelujah so some strong
[13:18] statements are greater than Solomon why
[13:20] the level of Glory became greater than a
[13:22] man with the spirit the level of Glory
[13:25] became greater than just a man with a
[13:28] spirit of Al elah and that's a great
[13:30] thing that God sends a man and puts the
[13:32] spirit of Elijah on him in fact he said
[13:34] Jesus said when he was talking about
[13:36] John the Baptist there's not a man
[13:38] that's risen greater than him as far as
[13:40] his office of a prophet he said and why
[13:43] did he say that because he introduced
[13:44] the first coming of Christ he's
[13:46] introducing the Messiah the Forerunner
[13:49] he says not there not a man among this
[13:51] born and woman but then he says he
[13:53] that's least in the
[13:56] kingdom is greater than John the bapti
[13:59] Baptist
[14:00] amen we don't read the rest of the
[14:04] scripture what's he saying in that when
[14:06] he makes that strong saying you know
[14:07] what he's saying he's saying sometimes
[14:10] in the smaller
[14:12] places it'll be a greater glory praise
[14:15] the Lord so he that's least in the
[14:17] Kingdom you might feel pretty low
[14:19] tonight but Jesus said he that's least
[14:21] in the kingdom of God uh is is is
[14:24] greater than him greater than this
[14:26] Prophet even so we serve God we serve a
[14:30] God that says the future is a greater
[14:32] glory than the past I'm going to say it
[14:34] again we must always serve a God and we
[14:37] do serve a god that is always that says
[14:40] the future has greater glory in it than
[14:43] even the
[14:45] past even than the days of a prophet
[14:48] Revelations 10 did not end at
[14:50] Revelations
[14:52] 10:7 it doesn't end with seven verses it
[14:55] ends with 11 verses it didn't end with
[14:58] the seven Angel the mystery did not end
[15:01] it does say the mystery of God should be
[15:03] finished but what is that what's the
[15:04] mystery of God Christ in you the hope of
[15:06] glory when you have Mysteries plural
[15:09] then we realize the seventh angel was
[15:10] used in this hour to finish the
[15:14] mysteries of God to finish the Loose
[15:16] Ends he was used for that and then
[15:18] because that vessel was there God uses
[15:21] the same vessel now God uses the same
[15:23] vessel to launch something something
[15:25] else and that's the bride coming into
[15:28] her position it's not just the Mysteries
[15:30] plural revealed but the mystery itself
[15:34] that Paul preached now will be restored
[15:37] and there'll be a bride on the face of
[15:38] the Earth that has the very mystery of
[15:41] God living in her Christ in you the hope
[15:43] of glory that's a greater glory Christ
[15:45] in you the hope of glory what's the
[15:48] whole hope of glory Christ being in you
[15:51] not Christ being in the prophet Christ
[15:53] in you young teenage boy Christ in you
[15:56] young teenage girl Christ in you old
[15:59] people like me Christ in us the hope of
[16:02] glory it didn't end on Revelations 10:7
[16:05] but there's 11 verses and it's about a
[16:07] book and it's about John eating the book
[16:10] it's about ingesting and taking what God
[16:13] has brought from the other dimension to
[16:15] us it's ingesting it spiritually so we
[16:19] become the mystery of God revealed Paul
[16:21] said you're saying I'm of sephus I'm of
[16:24] Paul and everybody's splitting up into
[16:26] different favorite preachers he said no
[16:28] he said you know we we don't lift oursel
[16:30] up as ministers one plants one Waters
[16:35] God gives the
[16:36] increase and when we start getting into
[16:38] that mode where we lift up buildings and
[16:41] make the beauty out of there's one
[16:43] preacher higher than another we're in
[16:45] the same mode that human beings have all
[16:47] done always done and lifting lifting up
[16:50] the past and judging things by the size
[16:52] or the Splendor or the outward beauty of
[16:56] it it's that's not what God wants us to
[16:58] to look for it's the smaller things he
[17:01] can work through can you say Amen it's
[17:04] it's not the size of the dog in the
[17:06] fight it's the size of the fight in the
[17:08] dog can you say Amen it's how much fight
[17:11] the dog has inside of him so they're
[17:14] looking at this and then God prophesies
[17:17] that the end will be a greater glory but
[17:19] in a smaller place it doesn't look like
[17:21] it's anything and just to example this
[17:23] now go with me in your Bibles back to
[17:25] Ezra 3:12 and because this is actually
[17:28] WI it happened where zerubabel went back
[17:31] he's sent back by the uh by the Persian
[17:33] kings there he's given money he's given
[17:36] everything and uh God just moved apart
[17:39] upon these uh these Kings Hearts because
[17:43] it was time for restoration and so these
[17:44] Kings actually sent zerubabel and sent
[17:47] them with the money to begin the
[17:48] restoration of the temple it was really
[17:50] a work of God but in Ezra look what's
[17:52] happens here when they finally finish
[17:54] just the foundation of this new place
[17:56] not the not the temple yet verse 9 then
[17:59] stood jeshua with his sons and his
[18:01] Brethren camel and his sons and the sons
[18:02] of Judah together to set forward the
[18:04] workmen in the house of God the sons of
[18:07] hodad with their sons and their brother
[18:09] and the Levites and when the builders
[18:11] laid the foundation it's just the
[18:13] foundation when they laid the foundation
[18:15] of the Temple of the Lord they set the
[18:16] priests in their pray with trumpets and
[18:18] the Levites the sons of ASF with symbols
[18:21] to praise the Lord after ordinance of
[18:23] after the ordinance of David the king
[18:25] king of Israel and they sang together by
[18:27] chorus and praising and giving thanks
[18:29] unto the Lord because he is good for his
[18:32] mercy endureth forever toward Israel
[18:34] same song they were singing with all the
[18:36] children and the wives they didn't use
[18:38] the soldiers they actually sent them out
[18:40] with the weapon of
[18:43] worship how many enjoyed that God said
[18:46] I'm going to do it a different way I'm
[18:47] not going to use the soldiers but I'm
[18:49] going to go to battle and the enemy was
[18:51] already destroyed by the Praises of the
[18:54] people there's a weapon in worship can
[18:57] you say amen and so they did the same
[18:59] thing here it's the same words I wish
[19:01] somebody would write a song on this that
[19:03] because he is good for his mercy
[19:05] endureth forever this is what they sang
[19:07] all the time he is good for his mercy
[19:08] endureth forever some songwriter ought
[19:11] to write a song like that I
[19:13] feel there's plenty of them around here
[19:16] and all the people shouted with a great
[19:18] shout when they praised the Lord because
[19:20] the foundation of the house of the Lord
[19:23] was laid but many of the priests and
[19:26] Levites and Chiefs of the fathers who
[19:28] were ancient men that had seen the first
[19:31] house when the foundation of this house
[19:34] was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a
[19:36] loud voice and many shouted aloud for
[19:40] Joy amen so there's a little distinction
[19:44] made here that the ones that were in the
[19:47] original Temple had a little trouble
[19:50] because they were maybe looking at it
[19:52] and they were crying because it wasn't
[19:54] quite up to par with what the first
[19:57] temple was
[19:59] so you got a mixture of things going on
[20:02] you you got people that are Weeping
[20:04] maybe because they're thinking of oh
[20:06] this is nice but oh was it so nice back
[20:09] there and this just isn't as good and
[20:12] you got people weeping but then you got
[20:14] people shouting for Joy because hey the
[20:17] foundation's being laid again we should
[20:20] be worshiping we should be glad we
[20:22] shouldn't be looking in the past can I
[20:24] get an amen tonight we shouldn't be
[20:26] weeping and looking back and saying oh
[20:28] but we missed the first one we should be
[20:30] saying God's Building the foundation
[20:32] again God's building a house again and
[20:35] I'll tell you I'll bring it up today
[20:37] God's Building a bride again God's laid
[20:40] the foundations with all the restor
[20:42] restoration of the word all the word has
[20:44] been
[20:45] restored I believe that but what did he
[20:47] do it for he's bringing back a bride
[20:49] full of the glory of God and we should
[20:52] be this is a different worship we should
[20:54] be shouting and rejoicing they were just
[20:57] looking at the foundation these people
[20:58] people were coming unglued shouting and
[21:00] dancing and they hadn't even seen the
[21:01] temple built yet just the foundation if
[21:04] you're building a new house that
[21:05] probably is the way it is just the
[21:07] foundation you start to say because the
[21:09] potential it's
[21:11] coming when you say God lay the
[21:14] foundation in people's lives you should
[21:17] rejoice in it well they don't have the
[21:19] Holy Ghost yet they haven't been filled
[21:21] with the glory you should Rejoice of
[21:23] whatever God does for them that young
[21:25] person gives their heart to the Lord you
[21:26] ought to be shouting rejoicing because
[21:28] heaven is can I get an amen tonight the
[21:32] only way thing that we have if they
[21:35] Rejoice on the other side is when a
[21:36] sinner comes to repentance and all of
[21:38] Heaven rejoices why can't we do that we
[21:41] should celebrate every move that a young
[21:43] person makes we should celebrate Every
[21:45] Soul that comes to the Lord and if it's
[21:47] just a foundation we still should SE
[21:51] celebrate amen praise the Lord but they
[21:54] wept aloud and then many shouted so that
[21:57] the people could not discern the noise
[21:59] of the shout of Joy from the noise of
[22:01] weeping of the people for the people
[22:03] shouted with a loud shout and the noise
[22:05] was heard a far off so then we go back
[22:08] into uh Zachariah and then Zechariah 4
[22:12] in the text we read do don't despise the
[22:16] day of small small things why is he
[22:18] saying that don't maybe it was these
[22:20] people that were weeping and now they're
[22:22] saying this this is not going to be as
[22:24] good this isn't going to be as big you
[22:27] guys should have seen the success of the
[22:28] first one and man you know sometimes we
[22:31] get that way where we look back at
[22:33] services in the past and I and and and
[22:36] so then we come to church kind of not
[22:40] under
[22:41] expectation like we should and praying
[22:45] that God could do something greater we
[22:47] cannot get in that mode of looking back
[22:48] we can't say oh the glory of that
[22:50] because I got to be looking what does
[22:52] God want to do today not just in church
[22:55] you got to get up Monday morning and say
[22:57] Lord I'm Available to you and we we feel
[23:00] insufficient sometimes but some of the
[23:02] simplest things that have been given to
[23:05] us through the word to teach our
[23:06] children if we're just putting them
[23:07] before our kids that's a blessing in
[23:09] itself they they should feel privileged
[23:12] and we should be privileged that we have
[23:14] a word to give them we have a token to
[23:16] apply to our homes can you say Amen
[23:19] praise the Lord so we should be
[23:22] available but but he he's
[23:24] saying uh don't despise the day of small
[23:29] things what's he saying don't
[23:30] underestimate you're looking at this
[23:32] Temple saying that's not like it was at
[23:35] the beginning and this it's so much
[23:37] smaller in
[23:39] size but don't underestimate what God
[23:42] can do with simple
[23:44] faith and smaller
[23:48] buildings don't apply his greatness to
[23:51] big things to Big preachers to Big camps
[23:55] to big numbers in this final work of the
[23:57] Lord and I'd like you to listen listen
[23:58] just now in this final work of the Lord
[24:00] that he's doing he is downsizing the
[24:03] place downsizing the numbers but
[24:07] increasing the power uh Charles Spurgeon
[24:09] the prince of preachers made some
[24:11] comments about this particular scripture
[24:13] in hegi and that it holds a mystery of
[24:16] why God did not allow that second temple
[24:19] to be greater in splendor because what
[24:22] what the distinction in Hagi is in the
[24:24] prophecy is that the building won't be
[24:27] any won't be greater in splendor but the
[24:30] glory will be
[24:31] greater it's God teaching them something
[24:34] and God actually Spurgeon is bringing it
[24:37] and I do believe it is that God actually
[24:39] is teaching because he's he's making
[24:41] that second temple less impressive to
[24:44] them because he wants to teach them
[24:47] you're coming into another dimension
[24:49] that it won't even be a physical temple
[24:53] they're going to come into the dimension
[24:55] that the temples will be that will be
[24:57] bodies can you say Amen will be human
[24:59] beings and so he's getting him ready for
[25:01] that so so uh why wasn't the second
[25:03] temple more magnificent was there an
[25:06] economic downturns supply chain issues
[25:09] is that why it wasn't as nice the issue
[25:12] wasn't a lack of funding to make that
[25:14] thing because even the money given by
[25:15] the family heads had had had not been
[25:18] enough and the degree came from Darius
[25:21] in Ezra 6 uh and it meant that they
[25:24] would have all the financial resources
[25:26] needed to restore the temple to its for
[25:28] for of Glory just a little history now
[25:30] they had all the finances to restore it
[25:32] to its original Splendor that
[25:35] Temple the issue wasn't a lack of
[25:37] political sport uh support Cyrus
[25:40] actually approved plans for the second
[25:42] temple to be bigger Cyrus actually
[25:44] approved plans for the second temple to
[25:46] be bigger than the first one so somebody
[25:49] God is behind this and it's not going to
[25:51] be bigger until Herod made it Herod made
[25:53] it bigger later but it wasn't be there
[25:55] they approved plans for the second
[25:57] temple to be bigger than the first one
[25:59] twice as high three times as wide but
[26:02] then they would have looked at it and
[26:03] said oh man this is going to be greater
[26:07] based upon the
[26:10] building and not looking for the glory
[26:12] of
[26:15] God so if money was no object and there
[26:18] was no bureaucratic red tape and they
[26:20] had all the permits they needed to build
[26:22] a huge magnificent Temple why didn't
[26:24] they and Spurgeon comments he says
[26:26] Charles Spurgeon had it been God
[26:28] Providence that a temple equally
[26:30] magnificent as the first should be built
[26:33] it might have been easily accomplished
[26:36] but God and God in his Providence is not
[26:40] arranged that it should be so and that
[26:43] though Herod lavished a good deal of
[26:45] treasure on the second temple for the
[26:46] pleasure of the nation he ruled and and
[26:49] to gain some favor from them he profaned
[26:51] the temple more than he had adorned it
[26:54] and actually became Pro profaned by the
[26:56] Jews themselves as Jesus begin to whip
[26:59] the money changers out and he said
[27:00] you've taken my temple and made it a den
[27:04] of Thieves and this is has a purpose to
[27:06] be a House of Prayer I got a little
[27:09] sermon I preach temples that lose their
[27:12] purpose and it ain't talking about
[27:14] buildings it's talking about individuals
[27:17] that lose the whole idea that you're the
[27:20] Temple of the Living God and it became
[27:23] about the money changers and sometimes
[27:25] in people's lives they start out good
[27:27] with the Lord then it becomes about
[27:28] money then it becomes about running
[27:30] after success then it becomes about the
[27:32] Mighty Dollar then it becomes this that
[27:34] and family and all the other things and
[27:36] their house their house their Spirit
[27:38] gets full of the things of the world and
[27:41] the values of the world and I wonder
[27:43] Jesus has to come sometimes and whip all
[27:46] those money changers out of your temple
[27:47] and say this is not what you were built
[27:49] for this is not what God's purpose is
[27:51] for your life can I get an amen tonight
[27:54] sometimes the word rebukes us cuz we get
[27:56] carnally and worldly minded
[27:59] and he takes his whip out and he whips
[28:01] the money changers out and say you
[28:03] forgot you're actually supposed to be a
[28:05] temple of glory and a temple of prayer
