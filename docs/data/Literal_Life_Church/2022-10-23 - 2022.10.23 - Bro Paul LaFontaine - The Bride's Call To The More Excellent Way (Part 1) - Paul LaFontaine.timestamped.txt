[0:00] through six or seven Bibles and this
[0:01] one's in the place Pages start to come
[0:03] out and I'm going to talk about Divine
[0:06] love today
[0:07] and it's First Corinthians 13 12 and 13
[0:10] what I want to read from and that's the
[0:12] one page of my Bible That's fallen out
[0:14] and I said in that just like the devil
[0:16] that's the one chapter he does so he
[0:18] wants to tear out of the Bible for sure
[0:19] but I'm putting it back in and we're
[0:21] going to read from It Anyway even if the
[0:23] devil don't like it so I want to read
[0:24] from First Corinthians 12 I'll just read
[0:26] one scripture now and then we'll pick up
[0:27] 13 afterwards
[0:30] First Corinthians 12
[0:32] and one verse and if you know your Bible
[0:34] you'll know that it uh it's speaking of
[0:37] correcting the gifts it's talking about
[0:39] the gifts in the Corinthian Church Gifts
[0:41] of Prophecy all the gifts there's so
[0:42] many that Paul mentions uh the nine
[0:45] spiritual gifts and all the other helps
[0:46] and all these other things matter of
[0:48] fact we could just read all the things
[0:50] he mentions here verse 28 he says God
[0:52] has set some in the church first
[0:54] apostles secondary prophets thirdly
[0:56] teachers after that Miracles then Gifts
[1:00] of healings helps governments
[1:02] diversities of tongues are all Apostles
[1:05] no are all prophets no are all teachers
[1:08] no are all workers of Miracles no have
[1:11] all the gifts of healing no do all speak
[1:13] with tongues no do all interpret no but
[1:16] this is scripture that I want to use
[1:17] this morning but Paul says covet
[1:19] earnestly the best gifts and yet and yet
[1:24] of all the gifts yet I show unto you a
[1:29] more excellent way
[1:32] yet I show unto you a more excellent way
[1:35] and I'd like to speak on the bride's
[1:37] call to the more excellent way
[1:40] father we pray you'll bless your word
[1:42] today
[1:43] thank you for our children Lord I pray
[1:44] that you'll instill the gospel and the
[1:47] truths of the Gospel in their hearts and
[1:49] their minds I pray that you'll protect
[1:51] them be with him
[1:52] so burdened early this morning of the
[1:55] Brokenness in this world and the
[1:56] Brokenness of families Lord it almost
[1:58] makes us a bit fearful to raise our
[2:00] children in such a place it's becoming
[2:03] Lord darker and darker every moment but
[2:06] Lord we have a token we have a hope we
[2:08] have a strength in the word Lord we have
[2:10] your presence that we can call upon in
[2:12] our homes and our families and our
[2:14] churches and Lord we're so grateful for
[2:16] that and I pray that your great
[2:18] protection will be over their minds over
[2:21] their hearts Lord and for the
[2:23] congregation as a whole I pray father
[2:24] that you'll bless each one and Lord lift
[2:27] them up and strengthen them today by the
[2:29] word of God whoever may be listening we
[2:31] place them Lord completely in your hands
[2:34] each of the souls that's in our care we
[2:37] place them in your hands we pray you'll
[2:38] bless the word today and Lord we've many
[2:41] have traveled a long ways we've come
[2:42] Lord to sit here and to learn from you
[2:45] today and so Lord I know that you'll
[2:47] never disappoint a heart that's making
[2:49] this sacrifice to come and to sit and
[2:51] hear your word you you never disappoint
[2:54] us Lord and I pray that you'll help us
[2:56] to learn your word and may your
[2:58] anointing come that our ears can receive
[3:00] it right in Jesus name amen amen Shake
[3:03] somebody's hand again before you sit
[3:05] down God bless you each one
[3:06] In The Name Of The Lord
[3:08] amen
[3:11] I want to continue speaking a little bit
[3:13] about Divine love and we know that we're
[3:17] in a series here in the relationships
[3:18] after Redemption and so at the last
[3:22] message that we preached on that a few
[3:23] weeks ago we
[3:25] talked about relationship staff
[3:27] Redemption it ended up in Romans talking
[3:30] about love and the particular scripture
[3:32] that said oh no man anything but yet it
[3:35] says we should owe them love we're in a
[3:38] debt to everybody with the love of God
[3:39] so I was very moved by that and never
[3:42] quite seen it that way that we should
[3:44] not be in debt of course we shouldn't
[3:46] owe anybody anything but we owe
[3:48] everybody we owe everybody the love of
[3:51] God that we have on our heart and we're
[3:53] not really allowed to withhold that from
[3:55] some people and give it to others we owe
[3:58] the love of God to everyone that we meet
[4:00] it's a pretty powerful scripture we have
[4:03] an obligation I don't like calling an
[4:05] obligation because God's love is never
[4:07] comes out as an obligation but he he
[4:09] Paul brings it like a debt we have have
[4:11] a debt to everybody and we can't
[4:13] withhold that when we owe that we owe
[4:15] the love of God he gave it to us and so
[4:17] we owe that to everyone else so we ended
[4:19] on the subject of love
[4:21] and so I want to go and just elaborate
[4:24] on then speaking about the bride's call
[4:26] to the more excellent way and I'm sure
[4:29] you've heard some sermons and different
[4:30] things on Divine love and and it's good
[4:33] to talk about and but we want to make
[4:35] sure that we understand what Paul was
[4:37] saying here in the more excellent way
[4:38] that he's talking about because because
[4:40] often in our generation love has been
[4:44] watered down there's different meanings
[4:46] to love it has been perverted by the
[4:49] enemy and so because of that our
[4:51] perception of love can come down to just
[4:54] giving just a charitable giving or some
[4:57] type of Act of sacrifice but if you read
[5:00] in First Corinthians 13 closely you
[5:02] realize Paul takes acts of sacrifice he
[5:05] takes tongues he takes intellect and
[5:08] being knowing all the Mysteries he takes
[5:10] all these things and he says it's all
[5:12] fine it's part of the Kingdom but
[5:14] without love so an act of charitable
[5:17] giving to give all that your goods to
[5:19] feed the poor we look at that as love
[5:22] but the love that Paul's talking about
[5:24] is not that it's actually something
[5:26] deeper than that so because we live in a
[5:28] generation that love is misinterpreted
[5:30] love is dirtied it would just would you
[5:33] say that I mean when you have two
[5:35] homosexuals saying they love one another
[5:36] then we know that Satan has perverted a
[5:39] genuine love for a man and a woman even
[5:41] and so we have different perceptions by
[5:44] what with the television that we've seen
[5:45] we've grown up on the Perceptions in
[5:48] this world that we live in and all of
[5:50] you are aware of that every day but we
[5:52] must understand we shouldn't attach
[5:53] God's love to something that we hear in
[5:56] the world or see in the world Paul's
[5:59] speaking about a way in a a and divine
[6:02] love here that's quite different and
[6:04] quite deeper and that's why as
[6:06] Christians we want to look at it he says
[6:08] I want to show you after speaking of the
[6:11] gifts in the church tongues and
[6:14] interpretation and not only speaking of
[6:15] the gifts but correcting them
[6:17] Corinthians is the book of Corrections
[6:19] and the in the Corinthian Church which
[6:22] was the great spiritual church and they
[6:23] had the gifts working and they had
[6:25] prophecies working and they had all
[6:28] those things functioning and yet with
[6:29] all of it some of them got out of order
[6:31] and Paul had to correct them and say do
[6:33] things this way do things that way so
[6:35] Corinthians is the book of Correction on
[6:37] many levels but especially the gifts and
[6:40] so then right in the middle of
[6:41] correcting the gifts right in the middle
[6:43] of showing and he says here covet
[6:46] earnestly seek after the best gifts so
[6:48] that shows us that there are gifts that
[6:50] are that that we can have but then
[6:52] there's the the better gifts if you want
[6:55] to know an example of that chapter 14
[6:58] and verse 1 uh speaks of uh Desiring
[7:03] spiritual gifts and he says and but
[7:05] rather that ye may prophesy so he takes
[7:07] tongues and interpretation and he
[7:10] actually says it's better if someone
[7:13] speaks an unknown tongue it's better
[7:15] that they prophesy that's better so it's
[7:17] not that it's better in the sense that
[7:19] God has different but there are better
[7:21] gifts that we should cover he says if
[7:22] somebody speaks a tongue in a public
[7:24] setting they shouldn't speak that unless
[7:26] there's a prophecy because the
[7:27] unbeliever won't understand what's being
[7:29] said and they say you're crazy you see
[7:31] so there's a fine-tuning there's a
[7:33] correction there's a way God there's an
[7:35] order God handles those gifts and every
[7:37] taking the gifts away but then Paul says
[7:40] covet the best gifts and I think we
[7:42] should do that but in saying covet
[7:44] earnestly the best gifts then he says
[7:46] this he introduces and he says but
[7:48] Corinthians I'm going to show you a more
[7:52] excellent way
[7:55] and to these childish immature
[7:58] Corinthians I don't know if their ears
[8:00] were too open because they were enjoying
[8:02] so much the gifts of the Spirit working
[8:04] in the church and when he says but I'm
[8:06] going to show you a more excellent way
[8:08] I'm going to show you something that's a
[8:10] deeper level I'm going to show you
[8:11] something that actually trumps all of
[8:13] that
[8:14] and I don't know I don't know I I don't
[8:16] know how open they were to listening to
[8:18] it but I do know this more excellent way
[8:21] is the culmination and the calling of
[8:25] the Bride for the last days and whether
[8:27] all the Corinthians came into all of it
[8:29] or not we as the Bride of the last days
[8:32] are to come into this way that Paul was
[8:35] preaching about as a matter of fact I
[8:37] believe it's the final culmination of
[8:39] the bride and what she comes to she will
[8:42] come into a victory of divine love how
[8:44] many believe that together
[8:47] so so now he introduced it he says I
[8:49] want to show you a more excellent way it
[8:51] is only chapter 13 that he introduces
[8:54] this in such a a big Way chapter 13. so
[8:57] let's read it real quickly because uh if
[8:59] you don't know it then I want to be
[9:00] referring to this he says I want to show
[9:03] you a more excellent Way chapter 13.
[9:05] it's Unique to itself though I speak
[9:08] with tongues of men and of angels and
[9:11] have not charity I am become as a
[9:13] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and
[9:16] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[9:18] understand all Mysteries and all
[9:21] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[9:24] that I could remove mountains and have
[9:27] not charity I am nothing
[9:29] this is quite a rebuke to the
[9:31] Corinthians because there are people of
[9:33] faith there are people of the tongue's
[9:35] interpretation there are people of the
[9:37] gifts working their faith would rise
[9:39] because Jesus said you could remove
[9:41] mountains with faith and their faith
[9:43] could rise to do that and Paul's
[9:44] actually saying now just be careful
[9:46] because you can have all Faith to remove
[9:49] a mountain just like Jesus said and
[9:51] still be missing the substance of what
[9:53] you need
[9:55] and though I bestow all of my goods you
[9:58] sell everything you have to feed the
[10:01] poor and though I give my body to be
[10:03] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[10:06] me nothing you can imagine what the
[10:08] Corinthians are beginning to feel here
[10:09] because Paul's taking all the things
[10:11] that they lift up and emphasize and he's
[10:14] saying it's all of God it's all
[10:16] wonderful but you could be missing the
[10:18] substance of divine love
[10:21] charity and so that's the first three
[10:23] verses and then he goes into explaining
[10:25] it charity suffereth long charity is
[10:30] kind charity envieth not charity
[10:33] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[10:36] Charity does not have pride in it it
[10:39] does not behave itself unseemly it's
[10:40] seeketh not our own there's no
[10:42] selfishness in Divine love
[10:45] it is not easily provoked thinking no
[10:48] evil Rejoice is not iniquity but
[10:50] rejoiceth in the truth beareth all
[10:52] things believeth all things hope with
[10:54] all things endureth all things
[10:57] charity never faileth but whether there
[10:59] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[11:02] they be tongues they shall cease whether
[11:04] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[11:06] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[11:08] part but when that which is perfect has
[11:11] come then that which is in part shall be
[11:13] done away he not only is preaching about
[11:16] this entrance of divine love and this
[11:19] this realm that we're to come into this
[11:21] excellent way how many want to come into
[11:23] that excellent way
[11:24] not only is he preaching it but he now
[11:27] he prophesies there's a prophecy in it
[11:29] saying that then when that which is
[11:32] perfect is come then that which is in
[11:35] part shall be done away when I was a
[11:37] child I spake as a child I understood as
[11:39] a child I thought as the child but when
[11:42] I became a man I put away childish
[11:44] things he's actually attacking childhood
[11:46] to staying just in the Realms of the
[11:49] gifts and giving at the level I've given
[11:51] my body to be burned he said we can't
[11:53] stay at that level or we stay childish
[11:55] in our Christian walk but this more
[11:57] excellent way is maturity is adoption is
[12:01] mature love is a victory in Divine love
[12:03] it's higher it's better can you say Amen
[12:06] it's a more excellent way than just
[12:08] being in the Realms of the gifts
[12:11] when I was a child but when I became a
[12:13] man I put away childish things for now
[12:14] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[12:17] face to face now I know in part but then
[12:20] shall I know even as also I am known and
[12:23] now by the faith hope and notice he says
[12:25] he abides we never get rid of faith we
[12:27] got to have faith to live by we we never
[12:30] get rid of Hope how many needs hope to
[12:31] live by now abideth all those things
[12:33] he's not getting rid of any of it now by
[12:36] the faith not writing by this hope but
[12:38] the greatest the greatest of all these
[12:41] three is love
[12:44] and don't forget that
[12:46] the greatest of these is love all the
[12:49] substances are there all the things from
[12:51] Christ are there but the greatest of
[12:53] these is love so now when he refers to
[12:56] it as Charity in our minds charity is
[12:58] giving to the poor and charity is
[13:00] because we have a different meaning
[13:01] today but in the Greek it's agape and
[13:04] Agape means it is the highest form of
[13:08] love and when you have the highest form
[13:10] of love it it is not man's love it's not
[13:16] originating at all in man or our minds
[13:19] or our hearts the highest form of love
[13:22] does not originate with us it only
[13:24] originates in God
[13:27] so the charity and love he's talked
[13:29] about does not it cannot and will never
[13:32] originate in man at all it doesn't
[13:35] originate in you it originates in God
[13:38] thus if you have God within you that's
[13:40] when you tap into this more excellent
[13:42] Way It Is God it's not originated in us
[13:45] trying to be better trying to be nice it
[13:47] doesn't origin anything in mind I need
[13:49] to be nicer to people it's not that it's
[13:51] not human at all can you say Amen this
[13:53] resonates in God himself and when he
[13:55] puts that into an individual they have a
[13:58] potential to come into a more excellent
[14:00] way that they function every day by
[14:03] Divine love
[14:05] that the gifts function with the motive
[14:07] of divine love that everything we do is
[14:10] being motivated by this Divine love the
[14:14] highest form of love I don't want any I
[14:17] you know we have filio love we have
[14:19] Agape that we have filial love and then
[14:21] as brother Brahm says it keeps getting
[14:22] down as Satan perverts loves I I have a
[14:25] filial love brother Bob says you have
[14:27] affiliate love for your wife a man could
[14:29] have affiliate love without God a
[14:30] failure love for his wife there's
[14:32] somebody uh somebody insulted your wife
[14:35] that man would want to kill him and
[14:36] that's what philia love would do but
[14:39] God's love brother Ram says would pray
[14:41] for the man's soul
[14:43] so it's a higher level you see so we
[14:46] can't stay oh Lord help me to say this
[14:48] there's no way Believers can stay
[14:52] in Realms of love that are just more
[14:55] human
[14:57] we're not called to just give filio love
[15:01] there's an affectionate love how many
[15:03] believe we have to have it in our
[15:04] families you have to have it for your
[15:06] children husbands have to have it for
[15:07] wives wives have to have it for the
[15:09] husband it's just not not Agape you need
[15:11] but if you don't have filial love or
[15:14] affectionate love in your marriage good
[15:15] luck with that
[15:19] and so we have other levels of love
[15:21] there's there's sexual love as well
[15:23] which God gave a place in marriage we
[15:25] have those things but you see now we're
[15:27] not called just to human loves or
[15:30] emotional loves we are called to a more
[15:33] excellent way and that does not
[15:34] originate with us it originates in a
[15:38] victory in Divine love for the bride can
[15:40] you say Amen we are the ones called to
[15:42] come come into that love and it is a
[15:45] better way so now it doesn't originate
[15:47] in man it's it's only possible to enter
[15:51] into this excellent Way by those who
[15:54] have him by the Holy Ghost in their soul
[15:57] there's no other way to tap into it this
[16:00] excellent way except by the Holy Ghost
[16:01] because it is him he is the Holy Ghost
[16:04] he is the originator of love he is the
[16:06] the Supreme form of love can you say
[16:09] Amen so you couldn't have this you
[16:10] couldn't access it without the Holy
[16:12] Ghost it's not possible to be genuinely
[16:15] expressed with Divine love to genuinely
[16:18] express it except he is living on the
[16:22] inside
[16:23] outward Acts outward acts of
[16:26] demonstrations may try to duplicate
[16:29] Divine love
[16:31] even without the Holy Ghost people try
[16:33] to duplicate it
[16:35] try to duplicate this love but it'll
[16:37] never be really real until you have him
[16:42] living on the inside
[16:46] I'm just separating that now that's why
[16:49] someone's got to say Lord if I don't
[16:50] have the Holy Ghost please fill me with
[16:52] your Holy Spirit
[16:53] God it's too late to be messing around
[16:55] God let me have the real thing but when
[16:57] you have the real thing you have
[16:58] potential for adoption and you have
[17:00] potential for mature love and you have
[17:02] potential for the more excellent way
[17:03] that Paul's preaching to the Corinthians
[17:05] say Lord I want to I want to move every
[17:07] day into this more excellent way I don't
[17:10] want to live in the other realm with the
[17:11] rest of the church world and the rest of
[17:13] the message so to speak that stays in
[17:15] this realm of just prophecies and giving
[17:18] and all these other things but there's a
[17:20] more excellent way than all of that and
[17:22] I as individual this is to me the
[17:24] bride's Revival this is we have faith to
[17:27] move mountains we've had Miracles you
[17:29] know I just want to say that somebody
[17:30] keeps saying that we're looking for this
[17:32] and we're looking for that I'm always
[17:33] under expectation whatever God will do
[17:35] but I just want to say people preach
[17:37] things sometimes as if we're still as if
[17:40] we haven't had any miracles for years
[17:42] since I was a boy I've watched the
[17:45] original faith of Pentecost manifested
[17:47] around me we're not waiting for that
[17:49] that's been Among Us I've seen the dead
[17:51] race I've seen the blind eyes open I've
[17:54] seen cancer healed and I still want to
[17:56] see it but it's not like we're waiting
[17:57] for that to come that faith has already
[17:59] been here
[18:01] how many would agree with me
[18:02] it's good to know it's like people
[18:04] preach it as if this is coming this is
[18:06] coming but see now since the prophet
[18:08] brought us back to the original faith of
[18:10] Pentecost and we catch that by faith
[18:12] you're you're seeing you've seen it even
[18:15] some of you that maybe have become
[18:16] bitter towards the message or whatever
[18:18] you have to admit that your whole life
[18:21] you have seen the power of God you've
[18:23] seen people healed and when God chooses
[18:25] to take somebody you continue on
[18:27] believing because you've seen enough
[18:28] evidence God can do it
[18:34] praise the Lord
[18:36] so now
[18:37] Paul
[18:39] himself draws a distinction in
[18:42] demonstrations
[18:44] like selling everything you have and
[18:46] giving to the poor or sacrifice and
[18:48] giving your body to be burned Paul draws
[18:51] a distinction in sacrifice
[18:54] and if this is hard because love is
[18:57] sacrificial
[18:59] even Christ's love is sacrificial but
[19:02] you see demonstrations of a sacrifice if
[19:05] somebody wakes me up at three in the
[19:07] morning says my my tire's flat you know
[19:10] I I do one of two things I get up and go
[19:12] help them with it or I'll call Ryan or
[19:15] somebody to go do it I don't know but
[19:16] you know it's it's it's acts of
[19:19] sacrifice and all that's great and it's
[19:21] and it's fine but Paul is the one who
[19:23] makes a distinction giving your body to
[19:25] be burned and and also selling all that
[19:28] you have been giving it to support these
[19:30] are demonstrations can you say man and
[19:33] and and and things that we do but he
[19:35] draws a distinction in that that you
[19:37] could give those things and still not
[19:38] have Divine love
[19:40] he's the one who does it right into the
[19:42] Corinthians and so we have to make that
[19:45] distinction
[19:46] especially when we're justifying
[19:48] ourselves and we feel guilty often when
[19:51] people feel guilty they'll do
[19:53] demonstrations of Acts to relieve their
[19:57] guilt
[19:58] oh boy come on now don't let me lose the
[20:00] amens
[20:03] hello we do it in human nature the
[20:05] Catholic does Burns a candle to do it
[20:08] to relieve the guilt because there's no
[20:10] blood there to relieve their sin and
[20:12] their guilt of sin if they preach the
[20:13] blood of Jesus Christ that'll completely
[20:15] relieve you of your sin but instead burn
[20:17] a candle do this do something nice do do
[20:19] something and say all this we got to be
[20:21] careful we should continue to do those
[20:23] things we should continue to do them
[20:24] more if we can but let's never fall to
[20:27] the deception that we can do all of it
[20:28] and sometimes do it out of guilt
[20:31] sometimes speak in tongues to appear
[20:34] more spiritual to people sometimes the
[20:36] gift of God working through us I'm up
[20:38] here and this gift is working through me
[20:40] as a pastor to teach to you but the the
[20:42] gift that's working to feed you today I
[20:44] still got to serve the Lord I still have
[20:46] trouble sometimes at home I still have
[20:48] to stay close to God myself the gift is
[20:50] not the idea to full identity of who I
[20:53] am can you say amen and I can live on my
[20:55] gift and say I'm okay because my gift
[20:57] went well today or I I got a lot of
[21:00] praise and compliments and so I'm I must
[21:02] be a good Christian because I got a lot
[21:03] of accomplished no that's the gift
[21:05] working I can't buy into that deception
[21:07] of the Praises of people when I step out
[21:09] of this Pulpit I have life to deal with
[21:12] and I got to deal with it as an
[21:13] overcomer in Jesus Christ just like you
[21:15] do
[21:17] and the church World lifts up gifts of
[21:19] singing and Gifts of preachers and all
[21:22] these other things and they left the
[21:23] gifts and then all of a sudden you see
[21:24] something somebody fail behind the
[21:26] scenes and they're not living the life
[21:27] because why everybody interpreted their
[21:30] Christianity by their gift
[21:33] that's not mature love that's not the
[21:35] way that more excellent way
[21:37] and all those gifts working even
[21:39] denominations and even sometimes in the
[21:41] message all of it looks wow this is God
[21:44] and it is God
[21:45] because they can anoint
[21:47] he could anoint someone with a gift
[21:50] he can use somebody
[21:55] speaking from my heart today
[21:59] so Paul draws the distinction in these
[22:01] things so chapter 13
[22:03] listen now is a special window into this
[22:07] more excellent way for the bride it's a
[22:09] view into Believers coming into the
[22:12] highest form of love itself
[22:14] it is the place of Revelation that the
[22:17] I'm giving it some different
[22:20] um perspectives so that you'll catch it
[22:22] first Corinthians 13 is a place of
[22:25] Revelation that the bride will come into
[22:27] it's a prophecy it points to our day
[22:30] actually as the full fulfillment because
[22:33] he says that when there will become a
[22:35] day
[22:36] when we see face to face now often we
[22:40] think of making it to the other side and
[22:41] seeing Jesus of Nazareth his face I
[22:44] longed to see him that way but the face
[22:46] and the scripture says countenance of
[22:48] his Radiance of his glory
[22:50] and we can see that now as we look into
[22:53] his word we catch the very face and
[22:56] Radiance of Christ and the Bible says
[22:58] we're changed in the same Glory by
[23:00] looking in his face
[23:01] so a face-to-face relationship with
[23:03] Christ you're going to be changed from
[23:06] glory to glory how many believe that we
[23:08] can see Christ face to face through the
[23:10] word of God today we can see him face to
[23:12] face not his physical characteristics
[23:15] but we can see who he is and he
[23:18] prophesies and said we see through a
[23:20] glass Darkly Corinthians but then face
[23:23] to face and when we have this
[23:25] face-to-face relationship not Facebook
[23:30] not two-faced book
[23:33] not texting
[23:37] but a face to face
[23:39] with Christ
[23:41] and when we have that
[23:44] that's when we can come into in the end
[23:46] time to this more excellent way
[23:49] it is prophecy when we come into that we
[23:52] will come into an excellent way above
[23:53] anything that the church has ever seen
[23:56] before and that's why I say the bride's
[23:58] call is to come on into this more
[23:59] excellent way I'll read some more quotes
[24:01] and things to you later to show you this
[24:02] is the hour we're in this is the
[24:04] ultimate this is where we're moving into
[24:06] and I pray all the time as a minister I
[24:09] pray all the time that somehow we can be
[24:12] a minister to be led to set the people
[24:14] under the right expectations of what
[24:16] we're looking at here before the Rapture
[24:18] what what are we coming into and I can
[24:20] preach anything I can I can preach that
[24:22] we're coming into more tongues and
[24:24] interpretation and if I preach that for
[24:26] six months we would see more of that
[24:28] manifested and there's not a thing wrong
[24:30] with it except I'm uh trying to be
[24:33] submissive to Lord what is your
[24:35] achievement what is your final
[24:37] achievement for the Bride of Jesus
[24:38] Christ what does it say that we'll end
[24:41] this with and and and there's enough
[24:43] quotes enough scripture to show and this
[24:46] is one of them then we shall see
[24:50] face to face
[24:53] and we we won't know in part but that
[24:55] which is perfect will come and when that
[24:58] which is perfect has come then there'll
[25:00] be a tremendous entrance of the Bride
[25:03] into
[25:06] perfect love let me just stop and say
[25:08] this
[25:09] there's a hunger in me
[25:12] to come into a deeper place
[25:15] I've been praying about it for years
[25:18] I've had this hunger for years and the
[25:20] thing about the hungering for more of
[25:22] God it's amazing that the bride hungers
[25:25] for more of God how many of this morning
[25:26] you say I Hunger for More Of God
[25:28] it's amazing we Hunger for More because
[25:30] we're the people at the end time that's
[25:33] been blessed with the restoration of the
[25:35] word the seven sealed book of being open
[25:37] Elijah sent back to us all the Mysteries
[25:40] revealed
[25:42] we're sitting here with the full I told
[25:44] the ministers in the office this morning
[25:46] I said there's so much Revelation coming
[25:48] across the pulpit every service that
[25:50] we're so blessed sometimes we take it
[25:52] for granted of what's being said we are
[25:54] so blessed to hear even uh five minutes
[25:56] of what ministers are saying last Sunday
[25:58] with brother Diggs it's a wealth of
[26:00] Revelation it's a wealth of the love of
[26:02] God being poured out upon us but we have
[26:05] all of these things I have enjoyed this
[26:07] word The Fellowship of the word miracle
[26:10] signs and wonders all these things for
[26:11] some uh some uh 40-something years
[26:14] serving the lord I've enjoyed it all and
[26:17] yet today 2022 whatever date it is today
[26:21] I am hungry for more I'm hungering for
[26:24] something
[26:26] and you know brother Madam taught us if
[26:28] there's a deep calling there's a there's
[26:30] a deep to respond he says if you're
[26:33] hungry for more of God that shows there
[26:35] is more of God that we're not done we're
[26:38] not finished can you say Amen we're not
[26:41] in a Rapture yet but there must be more
[26:43] of God and more for us to come into
[26:44] maybe it's this more excellent way that
[26:47] Paul is preaching that we've come into a
[26:49] deeper life with him in Divine love
[26:51] because see I can preach I can preach
[26:53] whatever expectations and I can hunger
[26:55] we're hungering after this we're
[26:56] hungering after that well I'm hungry I'm
[26:58] Minister said it a few weeks ago we're
[27:00] hungry and I like how he said it for a
[27:02] supernatural God hummus hungry for a
[27:03] supernatural God not just the acts or
[27:06] demonstrations of a supernatural God but
[27:08] I'm hungry for a supernatural God and if
[27:10] he does that through healing is sick or
[27:12] if he does it through something
[27:13] internally overcoming in me that nobody
[27:16] sees and nobody testifies about it's
[27:19] still the supernatural God and I'm
[27:21] hungry for that
[27:23] but there is a hunger in me for this
[27:26] life
[27:27] to be
[27:29] manifested more in me
[27:31] of this excellent way
[27:34] of divine love I don't know if it's for
[27:37] you but I'm of all of the Hunger of all
[27:40] the expectations I have of God I am
[27:43] hungry
[27:44] and I'm one side of him is frustrated
[27:47] that I'm not there yet
[27:50] I say Lord after all this after all
[27:52] you've showed me after all that you have
[27:55] done in my life I'm frustrated that I'm
[27:58] still not every day walking or I want to
[28:01] walk functioning
[28:03] by Divine love
[28:06] won't be being transparent this week was
[28:08] a a great one of those great
[28:11] report cards on where I'm at
[28:15] you know you get report cards sometimes
[28:17] from your children
[28:18] and you don't realize it
[28:21] and from
[28:23] maybe a spouse or something like that
[28:25] and you fail and you and you act in a
[28:28] way and you know as a Christian you just
[28:30] you walk away from it and if you're a
[28:33] Christian within seconds you know that
[28:36] you've acted out of place
[28:38] you know that's not
[28:41] the more excellent way that Paul's
[28:43] talking about
[28:45] in fact it wasn't even excellent it
[28:47] wasn't even good it was just way down
[28:49] here somewhere I said Lord what am I
[28:51] doing
[28:52] I'm praying for this this is my
[28:54] inheritance this is what I want to move
[28:56] into and it's in situations that come
[28:58] that are precious situations that's when
[29:00] I want to manifest it and I fail
[29:04] and then you get a report card because
[29:05] whether you want to admit it or not
[29:07] you'll get report cards from you you
[29:09] like a report card how your boss thinks
[29:12] you're doing
[29:13] everybody's still listening to has
[29:15] anybody shut me off
[29:17] don't hang up you know I've got if you
[29:19] hang up I got your number I'm going to
[29:21] dial you back up
[29:24] listen and it's the family we don't want
[29:28] to listen to because the family can be
[29:29] most critical sometimes and you think
[29:32] it's critical but if you look at it
[29:34] right it's your report card
[29:37] say Lord
[29:38] if I get their report card all the time
[29:40] I'll never amount to anything it feels
[29:43] like that sometimes
[29:44] but is it a true report card and if is
[29:48] there truth to it
[29:49] you know and this week I've got you know
[29:53] bees and C's and then I got an F
[29:57] then I got another ref
[30:00] it wasn't out living in sin and all that
[30:01] I'm talking about Behavior
[30:04] come on people
[30:07] wasn't in a bar somewhere
[30:15] b c f f maybe another C and you get a
[30:20] report card and you can run from it all
[30:22] you want to but if that's sometimes your
[30:24] family and they love you enough to tell
[30:26] you
[30:27] yeah
[30:28] then if you're mature you say okay I'm
[30:30] going to take what they said here I'm
[30:32] going to go pray about it because and
[30:33] then you realize
[30:34] they're speaking the truth on some
[30:36] things
[30:37] there's no sense in hiding from let's
[30:38] just running from it and then that
[30:40] prayer and that urge comes up in me Lord
[30:42] why
[30:44] you've given me the inheritance of
[30:46] functioning intense situations and
[30:49] manifesting your Prophet preach when
[30:51] when Divine love projects
[30:54] and there's a reason to use the word
[30:56] projects because it's not just having it
[30:58] it's projecting it
[31:01] you see it's not just having well I got
[31:03] the love of God and I love people well
[31:05] way too something comes up a tense
[31:08] situation a disagreement
[31:11] intense moments of Fellowship I call it
[31:15] and wait how much of that Divine love
[31:17] you say have is projected in that
[31:20] situation
[31:21] and he says when Divine love projects IT
[31:24] projects it's like a projector the old
[31:26] slide projector we're projecting things
[31:28] up here they've got that in the computer
[31:30] and it's hidden but now they project it
[31:32] out to you those songs out to you when
[31:35] Divine love projects where everybody can
[31:37] see it he says when you do that
[31:39] Sovereign Grace
[31:41] kicks in
[31:43] yeah and that's what I want
[31:45] that's I don't know if anybody else
[31:47] wants it but I'm standing here saying
[31:49] Lord and I have nothing to hide I want
[31:52] it and I'm hungering it for it so bad
[31:54] and I'm not gonna give up until I have
[31:57] all of it manifested
[31:59] I'm here for the duration
[32:02] because this is the victory for the
[32:04] bride this is the calling of the Bride
[32:06] this excellent way the Corinthians heard
[32:09] it but we're not just supposed to hear
[32:11] it even in this sermon this morning
[32:12] we're supposed to take a hold of it
[32:15] and see it in our lives can you say amen
[32:17] I hunger for it and it's amazing that we
[32:20] still have a hunger for God with all
[32:21] that we have it's amazing we've seen all
[32:24] these things that I mentioned to you but
[32:25] you see and we see the loose ends tied
[32:28] together we see it we have the faith the
[32:30] Pentecost restored to us can you say
[32:32] Amen we see years of the repeat of the
[32:34] original church Faith Among Us you say
[32:37] well we're supposed to be restored to
[32:39] the original faith and I know some
[32:40] ministers were going to be restored
[32:42] we're going to be restored to the
[32:43] original faith of Pentecost I don't
[32:45] understand that because we've seen the
[32:46] characteristics ever since I was a child
[32:49] I've seen the original characteristics
[32:51] because Elijah came and his ministry was
[32:54] to take us back to the original word and
[32:57] not just the result to restore us back
[32:58] to the original faith and Pentecost and
[33:01] when we've seen the The Works of God
[33:03] through him we've seen the Son of God
[33:05] exercise the faith to do what Jesus did
[33:08] again we're not waiting for that to
[33:10] happen it's been happening we're under
[33:13] the original Faith Can you say Amen
[33:15] we're already there
[33:17] now if you individually don't see it in
[33:19] your life then you'd say Lord give me
[33:21] more of a hunger for it let me see it in
[33:23] my life but I guarantee you if you cry
[33:25] out for this Divine love to be
[33:27] manifested in that realm of divine love
[33:29] he'll do miracles in your life he'll do
[33:32] different signs in your life but we're
[33:33] not seeking the signs first we're
[33:36] seeking a place in Christ first that
[33:38] we're one with him and when we're one
[33:40] with him you don't have to worry about
[33:42] the Miracles you don't have to work them
[33:44] up and have a pep rally if the people
[33:46] individually get in touch with God and
[33:49] Oneness with God you won't have a
[33:51] problem seeing the supernatural God am I
[33:53] okay this morning
[33:55] that's the approach that's the approach
[33:58] we're waiting for the original Faith No
[34:01] it's still coming what the Dynamics it
[34:04] depends on what your interpreting is the
[34:06] Dynamics because you know I was telling
[34:08] the brothers this morning is that I
[34:10] remember as a kid and I'm being very
[34:11] honest with you I don't know if I'll let
[34:13] this out on public but
[34:15] I remember as a kid
[34:18] being in conventions and camp meetings
[34:20] and the word being so glorious
[34:22] especially when I received the Holy
[34:23] Ghost at 16 the word just exploded to me
[34:26] and now I have the amen are on the
[34:28] inside and it's 16. I'd hear sermons by
[34:32] brother bisco sister Nicole's pastor and
[34:35] brother Harold Hildebrandt and all these
[34:38] brothers at conventions in 16 I was
[34:39] exploding I was saying wow this is
[34:42] amazing I feel so close to God and then
[34:45] we get to some services at the end and
[34:47] someone would give a tongue and an
[34:48] interpretation I thought I just watched
[34:50] this a young boy and I just thought and
[34:53] we'd all become reverent but I watched
[34:55] the change in the people when someone
[34:57] gave a ton of interpretation just a
[35:00] solemnness and just this whole relevance
[35:02] and
[35:03] receptiveness arose in the congregation
[35:06] now God is speaking
[35:09] and I've never said this publicly before
[35:11] but I thought in my heart as a boy I
[35:14] thought but wasn't God speaking in the
[35:16] Pulpit just now and why wasn't the same
[35:18] sobereness and reverence there as when
[35:21] the tongue was coming forth I reverence
[35:22] the tongue and many times it was of God
[35:25] it was God speaking but the Reverend
[35:28] said now and it's just the old
[35:29] Pentecostal Traditions that he hasn't
[35:31] spoken really until we have a tongue of
[35:33] interpretation that's a Pentecostal
[35:34] tradition the highest level that God can
[35:37] speak to us is through the foolishness
[35:39] of preaching God himself can be
[35:41] depositing Revelation through the
[35:43] preaching of the word faith through the
[35:45] preaching of the word
[35:48] so please don't think I'm disrespecting
[35:50] I'm just saying that's what I observed
[35:51] why is it that is it that way why do we
[35:54] live certain things and and then even in
[35:57] our lives when this happened we got
[35:58] certain events that we know God dealt
[36:00] with us and we're living off those
[36:02] things but then we're disappointed when
[36:04] it doesn't happen that way listen God
[36:06] can be speaking through the smallest
[36:08] things and you don't realize it
[36:12] God can be expressing his Supernatural
[36:16] but if we're looking for big things
[36:17] we'll miss it
[36:22] and he brought forth The Headstone the
[36:25] Capstone with crime crimes Grace Grace
[36:28] unto it the Capstone The Headstone comes
[36:32] at the end time which is Capstone Divine
[36:35] love that's the Capstone and he brought
[36:37] forth The Headstone with crimes Grace
[36:40] Grace unto it and the next scripture
[36:42] says who hath despise the day of small
[36:46] things
[36:49] the headstones come in the capsules are
[36:51] what a great move of God praise be to
[36:54] God and then he says but don't belittle
[36:56] the day of small things because it the
[37:00] third poem won't be a public show it's
[37:02] not going to be a national Revival it's
[37:04] not going to be a Revival movement in
[37:05] the message everybody's got to become a
[37:07] part of no it's going to be an
[37:08] individual Revival and God will Express
[37:11] himself in the third bowl without a
[37:13] public show sometimes a supernatural God
[37:15] in your everyday life
[37:19] Indian that's what I'm hungry for can
[37:21] you say Amen
[37:23] so
[37:25] it is this excellent way it is this
[37:28] excellent way that we're hungry for
[37:32] and
[37:33] if you know the message you see that the
[37:36] prophet even all the way up to 65 he was
[37:39] still hungering for something himself
[37:40] and a lot of it was wasn't a national
[37:42] Revival he would say things like we've
[37:45] had healing campaigns and we've had
[37:48] proactive meetings and we have these
[37:51] things and he says where has it gotten
[37:52] to us there was a certain disappointment
[37:54] with all the exuberant meetings that
[37:56] were happening there was a certain
[37:58] disappointment and and yet where where
[38:00] does it come to what's the end result of
[38:02] it
[38:03] if it's a new birth whether we thank God
[38:05] but if it's just just simply emotional
[38:08] thing he was saying that where are we
[38:10] going I think brother Brennan was hungry
[38:12] for adoption he was hungry for mature
[38:14] love he was hungry what is it that I'm
[38:16] hungry for there's something more and
[38:18] even him with all that he had seen in
[38:20] all the meetings even up till 65 he's
[38:23] still hungering for something I love
[38:25] this quote here in humble myself in 1963
[38:27] just after the seals he said it's my
[38:30] time for consecration to God if you guys
[38:33] have that quote it's my time for
[38:35] consecration to God God's time to speak
[38:38] to me I must just have a little change
[38:40] in my own life I preached a little
[38:42] sermon called the little change and we
[38:44] hear so many sermons on the big change
[38:46] which is the rapture the big change of
[38:47] our bodies but Brothers in 1963 I must
[38:50] have a little change in my own life now
[38:53] this is after the seals this is after
[38:56] all the healing campaigns for about 30
[38:57] years this is the dead race this is
[39:00] blind eyes this is all kinds of healing
[39:03] campaigns and still the prophet is
[39:05] saying saying I must see a little change
[39:08] in my own life he's not preaching about
[39:10] the big change of rapture he's preaching
[39:12] about a little change in his own life
[39:16] you better stay amen and get excited I
[39:18] preach this little change thing to ten
[39:20] thousand Africans and they come unglued
[39:24] to see that we're just not looking for
[39:26] the big change I mean he's looking for
[39:28] the big change but I'm preaching about a
[39:30] little change in our own lives
[39:32] it's just a little change but it's it's
[39:34] important
[39:35] and if brother Branham is saying that
[39:37] after all of the seals and all the
[39:39] meetings he made he's saying I'm feel I
[39:42] it's a time for consecration to God
[39:44] God's time to speak to me I must have a
[39:46] little change in my life not not as I
[39:48] think that I'm wicked but I want to feel
[39:50] this is the change I want to feel a
[39:53] little more closer to people see the
[39:55] people that I've tried to tell the
[39:56] gospel truth to and they turn their back
[39:58] on it and walk away and laugh at it now
[40:01] to me that seems like an insult to me I
[40:04] don't care to me but but to the things
[40:06] that I've been saying it's the truth
[40:07] trying to help them like shoving out a
[40:09] boat and say here here it is cross over
[40:11] here get out of that swollen stream
[40:12] you're going to die you're going to
[40:14] Paris there and they just laugh at you
[40:16] and walk away well to me it feels like
[40:17] if they walk away there's nothing more I
[40:19] can do about it see that
[40:23] is that convicting to us that's the
[40:25] level of Love he's at and he's hungry
[40:28] for more because really we're just like
[40:30] anybody else if we say well if they
[40:33] rejected it
[40:34] that's all I'm going to help them
[40:37] said I need a little change in my life
[40:40] we're not called to act like the
[40:42] millions of Christians around this world
[40:44] nominal Christians we're not called to
[40:47] be just a standard message believer
[40:49] we're called to a more excellent way
[40:54] and he says I walk away and nothing more
[40:56] to do about see that I can that I can do
[40:59] but I want to run down to the bank now
[41:01] and persuade them come on back
[41:03] see I've got to have that feeling see
[41:05] because I know there's somebody out
[41:08] there that hasn't come in yet and I'm
[41:10] going to fish he said until the last
[41:12] fish is caught I want to do that now and
[41:15] now in order to do this I'm expecting
[41:17] something to happen just stay right
[41:19] there I'm expecting someone to catch
[41:20] this thing when he says to on the bank
[41:22] come on back last Sunday when I preached
[41:25] the spirit and the bride say come is
[41:28] your life saying come the spirit and the
[41:30] bride is saying come
[41:33] because we have a fountain open in the
[41:35] House of David
[41:37] I'm expecting something to happen in a
[41:39] prayer meeting
[41:40] something and many of you remember the
[41:41] vision of the last poll that third poll
[41:43] rather you remember there was something
[41:44] happened just before that I seen that
[41:46] light come and go into that place and
[41:47] said I'll meet you in there and I'm
[41:49] looking for something to happen so he's
[41:51] still looking for something to happen in
[41:52] other words the prophet didn't he wasn't
[41:54] shown all how all this is going to
[41:56] interpret and play out
[41:59] but he's hungry
[42:01] he's tying this little room the tent
[42:03] vision and the third pole
[42:05] to Something in him that I need a little
[42:08] change in my own life
[42:11] don't underestimate the big things that
[42:14] God still needs to do in the bride to
[42:17] the little
[42:18] tying it to the little changes that's
[42:20] needed in your life
[42:22] can you say Amen you're still not
[42:24] shouting like those Africans ten
[42:26] thousand of them but they got excited
[42:27] about that they said brother Paul really
[42:30] go the ministers there's about 400
[42:31] minutes they said You Preach like an
[42:34] African
[42:35] I said well that's a compliment
[42:39] I know you're getting it this morning
[42:42] don't be praying all the time for the
[42:43] big change and trust me I'm praying for
[42:45] the Rapture all the time I want to get
[42:46] out of here how many just me and sister
[42:49] Carrie how many want to get out of here
[42:51] I want to get out of here I'm tired of
[42:53] this world but we're still here for a
[42:55] reason can you say amen and before that
[42:58] big change comes Lord if there's a
[43:00] little change that's needed in Me God
[43:02] help me
[43:03] I'm hungering for it I want it can you
[43:06] say Amen
[43:08] blessed be the name of the Lord it just
[43:10] shows he was hungry or something he goes
[43:11] on another quote he said this is this
[43:13] one's way back now this is in 1959 he
[43:15] said well then brother bear I'd like to
[43:16] ask you a question all the people that's
[43:18] claim to have the Holy Spirit and so
[43:19] forth won't they come in the
[43:20] resurrection I said if they have the
[43:22] Holy Spirit but when we be but what
[43:25] we've been putting too much emphasis on
[43:26] is the other thing instead of the real
[43:28] thing the love of God Paul said all
[43:30] these things could happen I could have
[43:32] all wisdom all knowledge and have yet
[43:34] not have love it profited me nothing I
[43:36] could speak with tongues like men and
[43:37] angels and still not have it and we put
[43:39] so much emphasis on these things upon
[43:42] great healing revivals and miracles
[43:44] being worked did not Jesus say many will
[43:46] come to me in that day and say Lord Lord
[43:47] have we not cast out devils in your name
[43:49] in your name haven't we done many many
[43:51] mighty works I will say unto them depart
[43:53] from me you workers of iniquity I did
[43:56] not even know you what a disappointment
[43:57] that will be but look what a surprise
[44:00] it'll be when he said those that didn't
[44:02] even think they deserve to be there when
[44:04] they were hungry and we fed you when
[44:06] were you naked and we gave you those we
[44:09] didn't know when you did this he said
[44:10] instantly see that third pole see that
[44:12] no public show they didn't know they
[44:14] were doing it when did we feed you Lord
[44:16] when were you hungry when would we
[44:18] clothe you they didn't even know they
[44:19] did it
[44:24] and so much you've done in the least of
[44:25] these you've done it unto me and how the
[44:27] world needs something today we let other
[44:29] things come and take the place of a real
[44:31] thing love we're leaving out living he
[44:33] loved me he died for me it was a sinner
[44:35] when I was unlovable he loved me anyhow
[44:38] my prayers for the church that we can
[44:40] have such love till we'll love people
[44:43] whether they love us
[44:45] not
[44:47] that's what the church needs today is to
[44:49] express a love even to a man that could
[44:52] spit in your face and you could still
[44:54] with not with a hypocritical standpoint
[44:56] but from your heart pray for that man's
[44:58] Soul that's the kind of Revival
[45:02] we need here in Los Angeles with the
[45:05] kind that kind of love manifested
[45:09] he calls that
[45:11] a Revival
[45:16] boy we have different interpretations of
[45:18] Revival but brother REM called that a
[45:20] Revival for Los Angeles and it's
[45:23] probably never going to happen to Los
[45:24] Angeles but Lord let it happen in me let
[45:27] it happen in this Los Angeles because
[45:29] sometimes I feel like a Los Angeles let
[45:32] that Revival the bride's Revival the
[45:34] catch the love the excellent way can you
[45:36] say Amen Let It Be In Me can you say
[45:39] Amen
[45:40] let revive Ascender Revival and start
[45:43] the work in me
[45:45] praise the Lord so Paul preaches this
[45:48] more excellent way to the Corinthians
[45:51] and when he preaches it then I can see
[45:53] what I'm hungry for it's this way that
[45:55] he spoke it's this more excellent way
[45:57] this more excellent way that he's
[45:59] preaching back then 2000 years ago I've
[46:02] seen what God can do and I will never
[46:04] stop believing for the supernatural God
[46:06] whatever Paul was pointing to which I
[46:08] don't know how many Corinthians came
[46:10] into it or stayed immature with their
[46:12] gifts I don't know that but whatever
[46:15] Paul was preaching I know the more
[46:17] excellent way that he prophesied is to
[46:20] the bride is to come more and more into
[46:22] it can you say amen and so now we
[46:24] started to hear the prophet refer to the
[46:26] word Capstone I want to get to this he
[46:29] started to refer to the word Capstone
[46:30] and he began to describe for the
[46:32] children so they understand a pyramid if
[46:34] you ever seen I wish I had a picture of
[46:36] one but a pyramid the the Egyptian
[46:38] pyramids were built
[46:40] and they started with a real big
[46:41] foundation to them and then as the
[46:43] pyramid was built up then it hones in
[46:45] and it gets closer and closes but all
[46:47] those stones had to perfectly fit with
[46:49] one another and go up interestingly
[46:51] enough the Egyptian pyramids never ever
[46:53] had a cat put on them uh I don't know if
[46:56] they made them and didn't put them on
[46:57] but there was some Revelation there that
[47:00] there wasn't put on because it wasn't
[47:01] till the end time spiritually that a
[47:03] Capstone was to be put on the church and
[47:05] then brother Brown says he was the
[47:07] Cornerstone and they rejected the
[47:09] Cornerstone so Christ the Cornerstone
[47:11] was rejected by the Jews so now you have
[47:13] that happening too that they didn't put
[47:16] a Capstone on those pyramids but you see
[47:18] that we find that that spiritually
[47:22] speaks of what the bride is calling is
[47:25] what the bride will move into uh it's a
[47:29] Capstone love and then he taught us the
[47:31] Seven Virtues of each age Faith virtue
[47:35] and he brought it in the pyramid Faith
[47:37] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[47:40] brotherly kindness and each age have
[47:43] those things growing into the final age
[47:46] 2000 years of virtuals being virtues
[47:48] being birthed into each age and at the
[47:51] end of the age it's just the time that
[47:52] we live in God caps it off with a Divine
[47:56] love the Capstone is love not faith not
[48:00] just Faith because that was the
[48:02] foundation not just Faith but perfect
[48:05] love and he brother I'm preached the
[48:07] message perfect faith
[48:09] perfect Faith where we're supposed to
[48:10] commit yeah we come into a perfect Faith
[48:12] but did you know the scripture says
[48:13] faith which worketh
[48:15] by love
[48:18] he quoted that scripture Faith which
[48:21] worketh by love
[48:23] so the kind of faith that we come into
[48:25] is not just a faith to remove mountains
[48:27] not just the faith for miracles but of
[48:30] Faith that's motivated by Divine love a
[48:34] perfect faith how many wants it this
[48:36] morning
[48:38] Faith to remove mountains not just that
[48:40] but Faith which works by love a Capstone
[48:42] caps the pyramid It's the final move of
[48:45] the Bride she is she is becoming one
[48:48] with him he caps us and takes us to a
[48:51] Rapture I want you to notice it's a
[48:53] simple illustration but as it keeps
[48:55] getting closer and the prophet refers to
[48:57] this that it's less and less
[49:00] there's only elect few as it gets
[49:03] smaller and smaller numbers as we move
[49:05] up the pyramid it's smaller and smaller
[49:08] and smaller numbers that are catching
[49:11] the Revival for their age
[49:13] it's less people catching it because the
[49:15] beginning ages you know 3 000 Souls were
[49:18] added to the church the first day
[49:20] many numbers but not at the end time
[49:24] you say well there's a lot of Christians
[49:25] on the other I'm not de-christianizing
[49:27] anybody I'm saying and they've got all
[49:29] the signs Miracles and wonders I'm
[49:31] saying who's coming into this more Alexa
[49:33] excellent way and who is this Capstone
[49:36] coming down on
[49:39] an elected few
[49:42] just an elected few and brother Brown
[49:45] says it's the the stones fit so sharply
[49:47] perfectly together everything's got to
[49:50] be right I'll read it everything's got
[49:52] to be fit just right and you're not
[49:54] going to fit unless you allow the Lord
[49:55] fit you
[49:59] right are you willing to say Lord
[50:01] fit me perfectly for the Capstone to
[50:04] settle on my life
[50:06] get out of my life what I don't need
[50:09] there so the Capstone can perfectly fit
[50:11] on me
[50:12] amen
[50:14] whatever it is fit me it's kind of like
[50:17] uh we don't
[50:20] you know cut the word
[50:22] to fit us
[50:24] we get caught
[50:27] to fit the word
[50:29] can you say Amen
[50:31] we don't cut up the word just like my
[50:34] first Corinthians
[50:36] falling out
[50:38] Satan would love would have loved for me
[50:40] to lose this last night and I don't have
[50:42] my text to read but I found it I put it
[50:45] back in
[50:46] Satan I'm putting back First Corinthians
[50:48] 13 the excellent way I'm putting it back
[50:50] and preaching it to the bride
[50:52] he hates that scripture in fact I'm just
[50:55] going to tell you there are more
[50:57] messages that are preached even on our
[50:59] ranks on the first three verses of First
[51:02] Corinthians 13.
[51:03] then there is the rest of the verses
[51:09] if it's the more excellent way
[51:11] the Paul is preaching
[51:13] why is that there should be more sermons
[51:16] on the first three verses of exercising
[51:19] Faith to remove mountains listen friends
[51:22] I want to hear it all I need it all
[51:25] I need my faith built up
[51:28] I I I need all those things
[51:32] but we hear so little of that matter of
[51:34] fact if I were to break down and take a
[51:35] few Wednesday nights and just break down
[51:37] every one of those characteristics and
[51:39] tell you what it really means that true
[51:42] love doesn't Envy
[51:44] It's Kind it's uh
[51:47] it doesn't seek its own it's not easily
[51:49] provoked irritated
[51:52] if I were to break it down
[51:55] like Paul's bringing this excellent way
[51:58] I don't know if some people would even
[51:59] regard it as a sermon
[52:02] and yet it's the more excellent way
[52:08] if you can't say Amen or agree just say
[52:11] I'll think about it brother Paul
[52:14] I'll take that this morning
[52:15] I'll think about what you're saying I
[52:18] want to be preaching and living I want
[52:20] all of it but I don't want to overlook
[52:23] and be emphasizing something too much
[52:26] that I shouldn't
[52:29] so God's Building a pyramid
[52:31] how many wants to be a part of that
[52:33] he says notice in the Lutheran age what
[52:36] did we live justification way down here
[52:38] at the bottom planting the foundation
[52:40] Stones Luther West that we believed in
[52:42] sanctification to come to the minority
[52:44] Pentecost still the baptism the Holy
[52:45] Ghost up in the minority but watch the
[52:48] church that goes right out to the end of
[52:49] it right out to the end of that that
[52:51] church is going to have to be so
[52:53] perfectly like the ministry of Jesus
[52:55] Christ to when the Stone comes it sets
[52:58] right smack in the groove oh hallelujah
[53:00] oh if you can catch it and know what I'm
[53:02] talking about the very Ministry that
[53:04] Jesus Christ was doing here on Earth
[53:06] when it comes back the very same
[53:08] Ministry he had Pentecost will not will
[53:11] not have to widen itself out into an
[53:13] organization but shape itself up in
[53:16] Christ until the headstone and the
[53:18] church will fit one to the other and
[53:21] them so submitted to you can't even take
[53:23] a razor blade and go around and find the
[53:26] crack where they were put together and
[53:27] that's how the church has got to come so
[53:29] much like Christ and look what we got to
[53:31] do then cut away and circumcise eyes and
[53:34] chop off and form and mold it into the
[53:37] image of Jesus Christ until that church
[53:39] and the cap comes right smacked together
[53:41] look at the church today and it's
[53:43] conditioned later on in the quote he
[53:44] says look at the church today it's
[53:45] condition weak backslitting gone back to
[53:48] the world that speaks of Christ exactly
[53:50] what he said I stand at the door knock
[53:52] and the later see an age he put out he
[53:54] put them outside they organized him out
[53:56] and and no they put him outside
[53:58] organized him out and set him outside
[54:00] our Creeds and so forth took him out but
[54:02] he still stood at the door and knocking
[54:04] and said everyone that I love I chasten
[54:06] and rebuke that's right trying to cut
[54:09] them down and bring them to a spot to
[54:12] where the great Capstone comes the
[54:15] ministry that's in the church
[54:17] and the Capstone will just come right
[54:19] straight together like a magnet they
[54:22] will just seal right together oh God
[54:24] help us to have I I'll be it'll be there
[54:28] don't worry that's what I like about
[54:29] this God's word said it's going to
[54:31] happen it'll be there that Capstone can
[54:33] you say man is coming down it'll be
[54:35] there don't worry it'll be there he said
[54:37] it would be there so let us fit
[54:39] ourselves to meet that Cornerstone it
[54:43] probably means headstone there or
[54:44] Capstone let us fit ourselves to meet
[54:46] the Cornerstone let us love and project
[54:49] our lives in Christ and be sincere and
[54:54] stay with the word until when he comes
[54:56] we just fit right in like the glove over
[55:01] the hand like that with him oh that's
[55:06] the church that God
[55:08] is waiting for
[55:13] praise the Lord
[55:16] I've been thinking how Paul basically
[55:17] took emotions and knowledge and faith
[55:19] and sacrifice and said it means nothing
[55:22] without the Holy Ghost love he's talking
[55:24] to babies in Christ Corinthians immature
[55:28] he's probably choking the babies with
[55:30] what he said then he describes what
[55:32] divine love should look like in US
[55:34] probably blew their mind talking about
[55:36] that if you look close he basically
[55:37] covered almost every aspect of men in
[55:41] the church not the world men and what
[55:43] was going on in the church that lean on
[55:45] these demonstrations too much and ignore
[55:47] growing into the actions and character
[55:49] of divine love tongues the Corinthian
[55:52] Church was leaning too much on the
[55:53] demonstrations
[55:55] right
[55:57] and not growing into the actions and
[55:59] character of divine love tongues
[56:01] prophecy understanding Mysteries great
[56:04] surges of Faith to remount room
[56:06] mountains I just want to make a comment
[56:07] is that
[56:09] sometimes the church
[56:11] the churches will swing this way for a
[56:13] few years then God will bring him back
[56:15] they'll swing this way churches will
[56:18] swing sometimes a certain way
[56:20] but the Holy Spirit just brings them
[56:22] back into balance let me believe that if
[56:24] they're of the Holy Ghost they're going
[56:25] to bring back a balance but notice how
[56:28] it swings it swings into the two places
[56:30] that Paul's preaching in the first three
[56:32] verses of First Corinthians 13. it will
[56:34] swing sometimes to emotionalism it'll
[56:37] swing sometimes to emphasizing certain
[56:38] things but then it'll swing to though I
[56:41] understand all Mysteries
[56:44] and have all knowledge churches will
[56:46] swing towards intellectualism as long as
[56:48] you understand the Seven Seals you're
[56:50] going to make it
[56:52] as long as you hear our teacher from our
[56:54] church you'll make it in a rapture
[56:56] you're just swinging that way and for
[56:57] the first three verses covers all of it
[57:00] can you say Amen
[57:03] by saying no don't swing that way don't
[57:05] lean on those things don't emphasize
[57:07] just those things
[57:10] don't versize just the faith to remove
[57:12] mountains don't emphasize just that
[57:15] great surges of Faith to remove
[57:16] mountains giving to the poor even
[57:18] sacrificing your body to be burned wow
[57:21] just think about in our minds that is
[57:23] the demonstrations of love of God but
[57:25] you remember brother Brown said I didn't
[57:26] bring the quote with me but you remember
[57:27] he says now what is the evidence he said
[57:29] I didn't get to talk about the evidence
[57:31] of the Holy Ghost he says watch the Holy
[57:33] Ghost not so much in demonstration but
[57:36] watch it in action what it does
[57:38] according to the word and when he says
[57:40] that we can lead towards demonstrations
[57:42] and want to see the demonstrations
[57:44] instead of looking at the actions what
[57:46] it does according to the word the
[57:48] actions of the character of Christ and
[57:50] the demonstrations oh we just want the
[57:51] demonstrations we want all of it
[57:54] but we don't want to leave out the
[57:57] actions and that's the evidence of the
[57:58] Holy Ghost don't watch it not so much in
[58:00] demonstration
[58:02] but watch it in the action of the word
[58:05] Paul doesn't remodel a room of all of
[58:07] this and say we're not going to do all
[58:09] this he just says that it's no guarantee
[58:11] that Divine love is there because we are
[58:13] doing this you can have all this and be
[58:15] missing the core of him real love divine
[58:16] love I think it's high time that we were
[58:19] walking in these last days and not
[58:21] leaning on past partial demonstrations
[58:23] that were okay that were good
[58:26] it's amazing that the things Paul says
[58:28] is really all of the extremes of the
[58:29] entire church World each of them will
[58:31] lean this way emphasize certain things
[58:33] when they have moved to when they've
[58:36] moved away from Holy Ghost character and
[58:38] divine love then they swing certain ways
[58:40] emphasis on tongues and prophecies
[58:42] emphasis on the Mysteries real
[58:44] intellectual atmosphere emphasis on
[58:46] demonstrations of Faith emphasis on
[58:49] charitable giving Outreach what's our
[58:51] church doing to spread the gospel
[58:53] emphasis on sacrifices dying out from
[58:57] the monks in the Catholic church to some
[59:00] of even our Church's teaching that we
[59:02] are slave and believe it or not this has
[59:04] gone around we're teaching that we're
[59:06] becoming slaves bearing the load of this
[59:09] dress code
[59:12] so one woman said to me when I did this
[59:14] I've been taught this hair is my
[59:16] heaviness that I wear for the Lord
[59:20] it's a load on me
[59:26] we're going to call 30 day fast to kill
[59:28] ourselves for the Lord
[59:30] legalistic leaning towards legalistic we
[59:33] have emphasized clothing more than the
[59:35] real thing
[59:40] and Paul's saying
[59:42] all that is in the word but I'm showing
[59:46] you a more excellent way
[59:52] it's funny how these things still get
[59:53] emphasized
[59:58] the calling for the bride is for this
[1:00:00] true Capstone Ministry of divine love
[1:00:01] can you say Amen
[1:00:04] true Ministry
[1:00:07] I just want to throw this out to you
[1:00:09] since you're still sitting here
[1:00:14] I wonder if many Christians hide behind
[1:00:17] some of these manifestations of the
[1:00:19] first three verses of First Corinthians
[1:00:24] because they don't want to seek Paul's
[1:00:26] more excellent way
[1:00:28] and they don't want to admit
[1:00:31] that they're lacking
[1:00:33] forgiveness for someone
[1:00:38] they know that they're lacking love the
[1:00:40] way Paul is describing it here for some
[1:00:43] people
[1:00:44] and
[1:00:45] they know that they are still
[1:00:49] should I go back and just read them
[1:00:52] seeking their own they're still easily
[1:00:55] provoked
[1:00:57] They Don't Really Bear all things they
[1:00:59] don't endure all things
[1:01:03] they become proud
[1:01:05] and so they hide behind the first three
[1:01:08] verses I just wonder if they hide
[1:01:11] because they don't want to see Paul's
[1:01:12] more excellent way they don't want to
[1:01:14] admit they're lacking in forgiveness and
[1:01:16] the love the way he's calling for it in
[1:01:18] our lives
[1:01:19] it's kind of like having a beautiful
[1:01:21] house
[1:01:22] and it's cleaned up and as far as
[1:01:25] visibly to visitors
[1:01:31] The Maids come in and cleaned up all the
[1:01:33] outside stuff but there's a lot of
[1:01:36] clutter that you're ignoring behind the
[1:01:39] scenes
[1:01:44] and you're feeling the you know it's
[1:01:46] kind of like my my barn I might as well
[1:01:48] bring that up
[1:01:51] John you're here this boy John's a
[1:01:53] worker with me the kid's been listening
[1:01:55] to me all summer
[1:01:57] in my truck
[1:01:58] I've got to deal with that Barn
[1:02:01] I've got to declutter that burn he's a
[1:02:03] witness right I got to get to that Barn
[1:02:06] and you're ignoring it you feel the call
[1:02:08] but you're ignoring it and you feel like
[1:02:11] that as long as the maid and everybody
[1:02:13] keeps the visible part white you can
[1:02:15] always have somebody over if that part's
[1:02:17] taken care of
[1:02:20] right
[1:02:22] yeah it looks beautiful it's it's it's
[1:02:23] it's it's workable for somebody to step
[1:02:26] in the front door but I'm not taking
[1:02:28] them to the barn
[1:02:33] not going to the barn and you feel this
[1:02:35] calling and guess what you all be proud
[1:02:37] of me I was so proud of myself
[1:02:40] because finally this week finally I
[1:02:44] tackled the barn
[1:02:45] and all the stuff in it that didn't
[1:02:47] belong
[1:02:48] it's been going all summer
[1:02:52] we hide behind things that make us look
[1:02:54] very spiritual to others
[1:02:59] but in the barn
[1:03:01] there's things that are easily provoked
[1:03:03] there's no forgiveness for someone no
[1:03:05] forgiveness for a mate
[1:03:07] but you're doing okay because you're
[1:03:08] hiding behind something spiritual that
[1:03:10] took place to you
[1:03:13] you're hiding behind an exuberant thing
[1:03:15] that happened and you're testifying and
[1:03:17] you're talking about that and talking
[1:03:18] about it but you see now don't hide
[1:03:20] behind those things when God is trying
[1:03:23] to show you a more excellent way
[1:03:25] is that okay this morning
[1:03:28] just thought I'd drop that in we hide
[1:03:30] behind things that make us look so
[1:03:31] spiritual to everyone else but in the
[1:03:34] barn is a different story and there's no
[1:03:36] forgiveness for some people there's a
[1:03:39] limit to everything listen
[1:03:41] we have to be careful of that now just
[1:03:43] if you give me a few more minutes I know
[1:03:45] it's five to one and I should have told
[1:03:47] you that so you do you wouldn't even
[1:03:49] know but
[1:03:52] just my last thrust here before vacation
[1:03:55] the mountains are calling and I must go
[1:03:59] brother Brandon begins referring 11
[1:04:02] times he refers to from 1961 a prophecy
[1:04:05] that went forth I believe was in Phoenix
[1:04:07] about his ministry and this was the
[1:04:10] prophecy he reads at 11 times all the
[1:04:11] way up to 65 he says because prophecy
[1:04:14] said about about brother Brown's
[1:04:15] Ministry because thou has chosen the
[1:04:17] Narrow Path this is in the quote the
[1:04:20] harder way the house walked in your own
[1:04:22] choosing now I can see that
[1:04:24] Moses had to make his choice to see thou
[1:04:27] has picked the precise and correct way
[1:04:30] correct decision and God says it is my
[1:04:33] way
[1:04:34] he said he underlined my way God's
[1:04:37] saying you've chosen my way the holy
[1:04:39] spirit's speaking back because of this
[1:04:40] and then he says because of this
[1:04:41] momentous decision a huge portion of
[1:04:44] Heaven awaits you awaits thee what a
[1:04:47] glorious decision this is God saying
[1:04:49] this to him you've made sacrifices
[1:04:50] you've chosen way but you haven't chosen
[1:04:53] your way you have chosen my way
[1:04:55] there is a more excellent way can you
[1:04:57] say amen and I believe he chose God's
[1:05:00] way what a glorious decision that was
[1:05:03] made this in itself is that which will
[1:05:06] make and come to pass the tremendous
[1:05:08] victory
[1:05:10] in Divine love
[1:05:12] it's a prophecy
[1:05:14] was the rest of it true
[1:05:16] then the end of it is true
[1:05:19] the decisions have already been made
[1:05:21] even by God's Prophet that will bring
[1:05:23] his bride into a victory in Divine love
[1:05:27] because remember character is not a gift
[1:05:29] character is a victory
[1:05:31] but we will come to this victory
[1:05:34] so then he comments after perhaps this
[1:05:36] is the great time coming that we should
[1:05:37] be looking for and surely this is itself
[1:05:39] a tremendous thing that will bring to
[1:05:41] pass and come to pass the tremendous
[1:05:42] victory in Divine love love divine and
[1:05:45] that's the verb before the adverb then
[1:05:46] it's divine love which is God you see
[1:05:48] and then it takes the love of God to
[1:05:51] dash out there on the front line and
[1:05:54] stand in the gap for the people and
[1:05:56] these rickies and briquettas that have
[1:05:58] so sassed the words and I've called them
[1:06:00] Ricky and raquetta God give me to
[1:06:03] understand I shouldn't do that because
[1:06:05] there's many of them that are still his
[1:06:08] children
[1:06:09] can I get an amen this morning see they
[1:06:12] can't help because they act so much
[1:06:14] different some of these old cold formal
[1:06:16] churches has got them that Spirit upon
[1:06:18] them and they're in the in a prison as
[1:06:20] Israel was in prison just as much as
[1:06:22] Moses went down to deliver them from
[1:06:24] slavery human beings that loved Jesus
[1:06:27] Christ would serve him if they only knew
[1:06:29] what to serve him by and they're in
[1:06:31] bondage under denominationalism that
[1:06:33] tells them don't do this and don't do
[1:06:35] that but the call of God must come
[1:06:38] whoever wants to come March towards the
[1:06:40] promised land let him March the spirit
[1:06:43] and the bride are the only ones that are
[1:06:46] saying come
[1:06:48] come and March with the word come if
[1:06:50] you're hungry I shouldn't call them
[1:06:52] rickies or ricketta because some of that
[1:06:54] is God's children can I get an amen this
[1:06:57] morning how do we know who's God's
[1:06:59] children not God's children I noticed
[1:07:01] some people listening and and uh you
[1:07:03] know inviting people to church please
[1:07:05] continue to do that some people have
[1:07:07] advised keep you say well it's a half
[1:07:09] hour it's an hour away just invite him
[1:07:11] invite them let your spirit of your
[1:07:13] heart say come he that's thirsty come
[1:07:15] can you say Amen
[1:07:17] let the love of God manifest I have one
[1:07:19] more quote and I'm closing this morning
[1:07:21] I used to think Divine love I used to
[1:07:24] think of that and this love began to
[1:07:26] pour out an extra we got love but we
[1:07:28] need the abundance of love the
[1:07:29] overflowing love you say oh I love
[1:07:31] Sinners but oh brother sister do you
[1:07:33] love them well enough to go out and talk
[1:07:36] to them and woo them to Christ
[1:07:39] hmm
[1:07:42] all of us message
[1:07:45] sometimes I call us message brats
[1:07:49] spoiled
[1:07:52] I just say it to me we get so secluded
[1:07:56] and we got what we got and we know
[1:07:57] everything
[1:08:01] you say I love Sinners yes I love
[1:08:02] Sinners I love them I love them right
[1:08:05] from here
[1:08:12] it used to be I shouldn't tell this I
[1:08:15] won't tell the person's name but you
[1:08:16] used to be this sister in a church and
[1:08:18] she's rather big and
[1:08:20] she was always coming up and giving a
[1:08:22] big bear hug to all the young guys the
[1:08:26] teenage guys this probably should have
[1:08:27] been doing it but she'd come up just
[1:08:29] give them
[1:08:30] a big hug and one of my friends said to
[1:08:33] her one time she was headed towards him
[1:08:35] you know
[1:08:36] brother so and so let me just give you a
[1:08:38] big cup he said can we can can I just
[1:08:41] love you from over here
[1:08:43] I love that
[1:08:46] I love you sister but I just love your
[1:08:48] from a distance oh I love Sinners but oh
[1:08:52] brother sister do you love them well
[1:08:54] enough to go out and talk to them and
[1:08:57] move them to Christ you see what I mean
[1:08:59] you say I love the Lord but can you
[1:09:01] trust him when the doctor shakes his
[1:09:03] head can you trust him when everything
[1:09:04] else is gone you need an overflowing
[1:09:07] baptism of divine love how many of this
[1:09:09] morning say Lord I'm I'm getting coming
[1:09:12] to the close of the service but I don't
[1:09:13] want to miss telling you give me a
[1:09:15] baptism of divine love this morning give
[1:09:18] me a re-baptism of it
[1:09:20] Lord please give it to me I know it's
[1:09:22] for me it's my inheritance we need an
[1:09:24] overflowing baptism of divine love when
[1:09:27] it seems like when you pray and your
[1:09:29] prayer is not answered do you still love
[1:09:31] him is there something that keeps
[1:09:33] purging you on that's God's Sovereign
[1:09:36] Grace has to take over it's got to and
[1:09:39] he's in the sermon he's in the sermon
[1:09:41] when Divine love projects then Grace
[1:09:45] Sovereign Grace will kick in and take
[1:09:48] over
[1:09:50] amen God bless you this morning
[1:09:52] I have something to read to you
[1:09:58] that expresses my heart
[1:10:01] um
[1:10:03] this is a letter from I won't mention
[1:10:05] his name
[1:10:06] it's from the Adrian Correctional
[1:10:08] Facility
[1:10:10] just a few days ago I'm going to share
[1:10:11] this to congregation
[1:10:16] it's got this on 1016. God bless hello
[1:10:20] Pastor Fontaine
[1:10:22] you do not know me at least not in the
[1:10:25] conventional sense nor do I know you
[1:10:27] however
[1:10:29] I feel God spoke to me through you
[1:10:32] I've only seen your commercial on
[1:10:35] television
[1:10:36] and within that short segment 30-second
[1:10:38] commercial
[1:10:40] I I got a sense of your pure heart and
[1:10:44] genuine spirit and that resonated with
[1:10:48] me strongly
[1:10:50] praise be to God
[1:10:53] but see we don't talk to people
[1:10:55] sometimes we don't say things but we
[1:10:58] have to realize friends no matter what
[1:11:00] you feel about yourself God's deposited
[1:11:02] something within us
[1:11:05] and the smallest little words we're
[1:11:07] talking a 30-second commercial with just
[1:11:09] lines of what I preached but there was
[1:11:11] something in the lines and this is what
[1:11:13] I've been praying for that God has
[1:11:15] attention
[1:11:16] your resonated it connected with them
[1:11:19] could this be a seed of God
[1:11:21] we haven't even got to the broadcast yet
[1:11:23] just the commercial
[1:11:26] God
[1:11:27] can be so powerful he can reach out to
[1:11:30] get his seed
[1:11:32] we should never estimate my mom wrote a
[1:11:34] song years ago it's wonderful song
[1:11:36] it's called unspoken words
[1:11:38] unspoken words how my life is so filled
[1:11:41] with them
[1:11:42] unspoken words how I wish I would have
[1:11:45] said them
[1:11:46] oh dear Jesus help me throw aside my
[1:11:51] pride
[1:11:53] and help those around me Lord for them
[1:11:58] you died
[1:12:00] unspoken words my life so filled with
[1:12:03] regrets I didn't say something
[1:12:06] but there's power in the words of the
[1:12:08] bride with what he's deposited within us
[1:12:12] you know some of the depression instead
[1:12:15] of the family issues and the squabbles
[1:12:18] and the selfishness probably would be
[1:12:21] washed away
[1:12:23] everybody listen
[1:12:25] nobody's excluded in this
[1:12:28] some of your hardships and trials and
[1:12:30] focus on all these other things would be
[1:12:33] washed away if you would focus on those
[1:12:35] around that you need to speak an
[1:12:37] encouragement to and tell about what
[1:12:39] God's done for your life in Christ
[1:12:44] foreign
[1:12:48] a religious person Pastor Fontaine but
[1:12:52] I'm definitely spiritual you may
[1:12:53] question
[1:12:54] as to my reasons for writing you and the
[1:12:57] truth of the matter is I don't know
[1:12:58] particularly I just feel moved in my
[1:13:00] spirit
[1:13:01] after some recent tragic events unfold
[1:13:03] my life in the lives of my loved ones I
[1:13:06] ask God to please help me change my life
[1:13:08] I've used drugs I've sold drugs I've
[1:13:10] robbed stole and hurt people
[1:13:13] I've made a lot of decision done things
[1:13:15] that I'm not proud of I don't and will
[1:13:18] not live that way anymore two years ago
[1:13:20] I got down on my knees and prayed I
[1:13:22] didn't know what to pray for or how
[1:13:24] what I did know was that that I didn't
[1:13:27] want to continue living the way that I
[1:13:29] had been so I asked God God if you're
[1:13:31] real please help me and I ask Jesus to
[1:13:33] come into my heart I live a life
[1:13:35] differently today I take responsibly for
[1:13:37] my deeds and behavior I don't use drugs
[1:13:39] God hiss things God has transformed my
[1:13:43] mind I've been in prison now for 18
