[4:36] [Music]
[4:39] song for worship is more than a
[4:46] [Music]
[4:49] [Applause]
[4:53] song Clear the Stage and set the sound
[4:56] in lights a blaze if that's the measure
[4:59] you must take to crush the
[5:06] idol we're going to read from Luke 21
[5:09] which is the some of the prophecy that
[5:12] Jesus gave himself for the last days
[5:15] this is uh scripture that no doubt
[5:17] you've read read many times and
[5:19] preachers and Minister many times
[5:20] because when Jesus is speaking about the
[5:23] last days and all the all the things
[5:25] that go with it you're familiar with
[5:27] that not only by what Jesus said but
[5:30] also watching it take place and
[5:32] throughout these last few scriptures of
[5:34] Luke you'll find uh things talking about
[5:37] the the uh um the the Vengeance and the
[5:42] the different uh things that are taking
[5:43] place of wars and rumors of wars uh uh
[5:46] the pressure that comes out earthquakes
[5:48] and diverse places these are terms from
[5:50] the end time these things increase and
[5:52] Jesus said these will be signs that
[5:54] you're getting close to the end when
[5:56] these things increase earthquakes and
[5:59] divers places and all the other things
[6:01] that he mentioned when he gets towards
[6:03] the end of Luke 21 um he goes into
[6:06] something I think we should give
[6:08] attention to and uh it really starts
[6:11] here in verse
[6:13] 26 when he says uh we just read 25 and
[6:16] there shall be signs of the Sun and the
[6:17] Moon in the stars and upon the Earth
[6:20] distress of nations with perplexity the
[6:22] Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts
[6:25] failing them for fear and looking after
[6:28] those things which are coming on the
[6:29] Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[6:31] shaken so there is a fear and men's
[6:34] Hearts failing for fear just by them
[6:37] watching what's coming and sensing
[6:39] what's coming and seeing the
[6:41] accumulation and the increase of things
[6:43] going on in the news and and the
[6:46] violence and the things increasing that
[6:48] it is this will uh create a fear uh in
[6:51] men's hearts and I'm just going to skip
[6:54] now all the way down to verse 34 and
[6:57] this is how he ends this prophecy which
[6:59] I think is significant he points his
[7:02] attention towards our hearts Jesus
[7:06] points his attention to our hearts of
[7:10] all the signs of all the things that's
[7:12] going on now he says in verse
[7:15] 34 take heed to yourself lest at any
[7:19] time your hearts be overcharged with
[7:22] surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of
[7:25] Life worries of life and so that day
[7:28] come upon you unawares for as a snare
[7:31] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[7:34] the face of the whole earth watch ye
[7:36] therefore and pray always how many want
[7:39] to uh pray
[7:41] always that ye may be accounted worthy
[7:43] to escape all of these things that shall
[7:47] come to pass and to stand before the son
[7:50] of man I want to point it out again that
[7:53] his emphasis after all of the signs of
[7:55] the end time turns to our hearts being
[7:59] over burdened and over
[8:01] pressured by the worries of life and the
[8:04] scares of life he directs his attention
[8:07] towards our hearts we've also been uh
[8:11] referring to I want to refer back to
[8:13] psalms 27 and not the whole chapter as
[8:16] we read a few weeks ago we've been
[8:17] talking about the time of trouble and
[8:19] that term comes from psalms 27 which is
[8:22] a a a a scripture that is uh related to
[8:27] the end time and the rapture
[8:30] and I'll just pull out one little couple
[8:32] verses from there again as we read it a
[8:34] couple weeks ago right there here at
[8:37] verse verse five for in the time of
[8:41] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[8:46] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[8:49] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock I
[8:54] want to point out again in Luke 21 that
[8:56] in the Prophecies of the end time all of
[8:58] the prophet phes at the end of the
[9:01] prophecy for Jesus he turns the
[9:03] attention towards our hearts and uh in
[9:07] Psalms 27 he says he will hide Us in
[9:10] other words in that particular time of
[9:13] trouble at the end time his answer will
[9:16] be not necessarily that we go out and we
[9:19] fight against it or we try to change it
[9:22] if there's any emphasis I'd like to make
[9:24] this morning for your lives is that
[9:25] we're in a position in this world in the
[9:28] last second of time that we cannot
[9:31] change the atmospheres of the world we
[9:34] cannot change the evil that's happening
[9:36] we cannot change the violence that's
[9:39] Rising as a matter of fact you can't
[9:41] change other people like you'd like to
[9:44] change them how many would raise hand
[9:46] and say if I could just change some
[9:47] other people in my life life would be
[9:49] better we have no guarantee we can't
[9:51] change our boss we can't change the
[9:54] atmospheres that are around us we can't
[9:56] change that Satan is trying through
[9:59] Sodom and gorah to knock on the doors of
[10:01] our homes and bring that Sodom Spirit
[10:03] into our home we can't change that
[10:06] knocking at our door but what we look at
[10:08] in this hour is the things that God can
[10:10] change what we look at in the things
[10:13] that we can have control over because
[10:16] there's a lot of things that we don't
[10:18] have control over and in the time of
[10:20] trouble he didn't say I'm going to have
[10:22] you go out and fight against these
[10:24] things and raise up a a a a a government
[10:27] that would fight against the problems he
[10:29] said in that hour in the time of trouble
[10:32] I'll provide a place for you and I'll
[10:34] hide
[10:36] you and when he mentions Pavilion and
[10:39] the secret of his Tabernacle it's a
[10:42] spiritual connotation to a place that
[10:45] means
[10:48] protection because we'll need to be
[10:52] protected our children will need to be
[10:55] protected and now I want to go specific
[10:58] to what I'm going to speak about this
[11:00] morning for a short time is that there's
[11:03] a couple things that we can control and
[11:05] that we could can put guards in place
[11:08] and they're very important places and I
[11:10] talked to the young people about it this
[11:12] week there's there's a there's a crucial
[11:15] thing that we need to look towards and
[11:17] that's the protection and the the place
[11:20] God provided to protect our minds and
[11:24] our hearts yes there might not be a lot
[11:28] of things that we can control
[11:29] and protect but God gives us promises in
[11:32] the word that he will put protections
[11:35] for our minds and our hearts which means
[11:38] our
[11:40] thoughts and our
[11:43] emotions they have to be guarded yes in
[11:49] this hour yes they have to be protected
[11:52] can you say Amen the the battlefield is
[11:55] the Mind Satan Wars against your soul
[11:59] but but the battlefield is the mind and
[12:02] the spirit that's right and if he can
[12:05] live there and get in there and dominate
[12:08] that he he can dominate your life so the
[12:11] Bible refers to it as couple places but
[12:14] the corrupting of the minds Paul said I
[12:16] fear lest by any means as the serpent
[12:18] beguiled Eve that you should be
[12:20] corrupted in your minds and your
[12:22] thoughts from the Simplicity of Christ
[12:25] right so it's a Corruption of the mind
[12:29] and then all of the scriptures that
[12:31] speak of the heart the Bible speaks of a
[12:33] a broken heart the Bible speaks of a
[12:36] hardened heart the Bible speaks of an
[12:38] evil heart the Bible speaks of a proud
[12:41] heart a fearful heart a hurting heart
[12:44] that's been hurt a damaged heart a
[12:47] fainting heart and a lustful heart and
[12:50] there's many many more talking about the
[12:52] conditions of a heart which by the way
[12:54] only the Lord can
[12:56] heal only the Lord because he says I
[12:59] came to heal the
[13:02] brokenhearted I sent my word to heal not
[13:05] only your bodies can you say Amen not
[13:07] only your soul but to heal the
[13:10] brokenhearted to deliver a lustful heart
[13:12] can you say Amen to Humble a proud heart
[13:16] to soften a hardened
[13:19] heart he sent all this in order for us
[13:22] to be healed so I I I I had just been
[13:26] saying in in my thoughts that if God
[13:30] cared so much to talk in scripture and
[13:32] the message about not only our souls but
[13:36] where our heart is and where our mind is
[13:39] and where our thoughts is then if we're
[13:41] not giving it as much
[13:44] attention that's a
[13:46] problem if we're going to be immature
[13:48] and say I'm coming to church so my soul
[13:51] can be fed and that's what's fed and
[13:53] that's the key area because God can work
[13:54] out of that but if we're ignoring what's
[13:57] going in our minds
[14:00] if we're ignoring what we're feeding on
[14:02] every day if we're ignoring feeding on
[14:05] too much of social media and feeding on
[14:09] too much of
[14:10] negative what you're letting in your
[14:13] thoughts and letting in your emotions is
[14:15] very important to God and if it's
[14:19] important to God it should be important
[14:21] to us so I'm saying that a Believer can
[14:24] come to a message church and hear the
[14:26] all the good soul food that you can hear
[14:29] the very best with the light of the
[14:31] message but if you go home ignoring your
[14:34] heart and your thoughts you're going to
[14:35] be defeated that's right Satan's going
[14:38] to have the victory in your life that's
[14:41] right and so I'm I'm I'm going to speak
[14:43] to you real clearly about it because if
[14:45] it's important to God it should be
[14:47] important to us especially this coming
[14:51] year in the same message though is God
[14:54] in our message God as Satan is being
[14:57] very intentional
[15:00] to uh to go for the minds and the battle
[15:05] of the Mind the battle of the heart the
[15:07] message is God being very intentional to
[15:11] speak things that care for our souls
[15:13] care for our hearts and our minds and to
[15:16] put a protection in place for the last
[15:18] days the message is very intentional by
[15:22] God to our hearts and if we're feeding
[15:25] on it you'll find it very intentional
[15:28] amen that's right
[15:30] to put in place protections he will hide
[15:34] me he will he will have a place of
[15:37] protection a guard and a shield of our
[15:39] hearts and Minds if we will hide in that
[15:42] word and believe that word it will guard
[15:45] and protect us during this time it'll
[15:48] hide us from what the damage and the
[15:51] abuse he will be doing to hearts and
[15:54] Minds in this time of
[15:56] trouble it will be this age and its
[15:59] damage of the hearts that God will
[16:02] respond to to provide a place for his
[16:06] people he will need to provide a place
[16:09] of healing and deliverance can you say
[16:11] Amen but also he will put in that word
[16:14] some safeguards that will protect these
[16:16] special areas of your mind and your
[16:18] heart if we don't value those areas of
[16:21] our Temple that we can have control over
[16:25] then no matter how many protections God
[16:27] puts in place
[16:30] if you don't value it because you see
[16:32] what you don't value you don't take care
[16:36] of if you don't see the high value of
[16:39] your mind and your thoughts every day
[16:42] and your emotions to put guards and
[16:45] boundaries up to say Satan you're only
[16:47] going to go so far that's not going to
[16:49] get in if you don't do it God can have
[16:52] all the scriptures he wants to help you
[16:54] but you have to see the value of your
[16:57] temple
[16:59] young person you have to see the your
[17:01] parents can teach you but you go off
[17:03] with your phone and if you don't see the
[17:06] value of what goes in your mind then
[17:09] you'll never put up guards to say no I
[17:11] sto right there my mind is not a garbage
[17:15] can Hallelujah it belongs to the Lord my
[17:19] emotions are not just up and down to
[17:22] take any guy or girl anybody who says a
[17:24] hurtful comment and then I'm hurt by it
[17:26] no I put a guard up to those things
[17:28] because my temple Belongs to the Lord
[17:31] but often God values these things we
[17:33] should often we throw we we're throwing
[17:35] our thoughts and our Spirits out there
[17:38] so vulnerable to all kinds of negative
[17:41] maybe
[17:42] filth maybe fears unfounded fears and we
[17:47] do it to ourselves because maybe we have
[17:49] not learned how precious these areas are
[17:52] and how they need to be hidden in his
[17:55] protection to get them listen now to get
[17:58] those places so hidden in Christ that
[18:03] it's very hard for the devil to get to
[18:07] those areas look at this that you had
[18:10] actually so put protection place to your
[18:13] mind and
[18:15] spirit that the devil's having a real
[18:18] hard time getting to those
[18:21] areas it's just difficult man can live
[18:25] so close to God and become so hidden in
[18:27] Christ that the devil doesn't know where
[18:30] to find
[18:32] him
[18:35] hallu if you were looking for some
[18:39] highly doctrinal
[18:42] explosive Pizzaz this morning Revelation
[18:45] in the word maybe come back another
[18:47] Sunday because this isn't
[18:49] it I'm talking about your heart and your
[18:52] mind your emotions and what gets in and
[18:56] what doesn't belong there
[18:59] putting a value on it we will protect
[19:02] something better when we see the value
[19:03] of it when we lose the value of it it's
[19:05] not as important to protect and guard
[19:07] over so when it comes to our hearts and
[19:09] Minds this is what one writer said about
[19:12] it guarded hearts and Minds means to
[19:15] actively protect one's emotions and
[19:18] thoughts from harmful
[19:21] influences guarded hearts and Minds
[19:24] means to actively protect one's emotions
[19:27] and thoughts from harmful influences
[19:29] essentially being mindful of what enters
[19:31] your heart and mind often with the idea
[19:34] of maintaining a positive and Healthy
[19:37] Outlook by filtering out
[19:42] negativity or harmful
[19:46] stimuli filtering that out this phrase
[19:49] is frequently used in a spiritual
[19:51] context drawing from the Bible verse in
[19:54] Proverbs 4:23 which says above all else
[19:57] guard your heart for everything you do
[20:00] flows from your
[20:02] heart guard your heart Above All Else
[20:04] guard your heart for the issues of life
[20:07] come from your heart so it says to guard
[20:09] your heart Deuteronomy 6:7 says you
[20:12] teach them diligently to your children
[20:14] the word of God impressing God's
[20:16] precepts on their minds and penetrating
[20:20] their hearts with his truths this is a
[20:22] mandate for parents if you got children
[20:25] it's you teach this word to them and
[20:27] it's not just for their souls to get a
[20:29] hold of someday but you're impressing
[20:31] God's precept on their minds and
[20:34] penetrating their hearts with his truths
[20:38] and shall speak of them when you sit in
[20:39] your house and when you walk on the road
[20:42] and when you lie down and when you get
[20:45] up this is what you're saturated with
[20:49] and don't make it a don't make it a
[20:51] drudgery if they sense in you that this
[20:54] is a drudgery to you this word they're
[20:56] going to pick up on that that's right
[20:58] but but it's life to you it's a passion
[21:00] to you it's what you talk
[21:02] about because it means it's more than
[21:05] just words to you it's the person of
[21:07] Christ to you being welcome his presence
[21:10] being welcome in your home send that
[21:12] message to your kids praise the Lord and
[21:16] when when David is talking to about the
[21:18] people dedicating the temple vers 1st
[21:21] Chronicles
[21:22] 2917 1st Chronicles 29:7 I know also my
[21:25] God that you test the heart and Delight
[21:28] in the uprightness and integrity in the
[21:30] uprightness of my heart I have willingly
[21:32] offered all these things so now with joy
[21:34] I have seen your people who are present
[21:36] here make their offerings willingly and
[21:38] freely to you oh Lord God of Abraham
[21:41] Isaac and Israel our fathers keep
[21:44] forever such purposes and thoughts in
[21:48] the minds of the people and direct their
[21:51] hearts towards you it's all through the
[21:54] Bible your hearts and your minds are
[21:58] important to God 1 John 5:21 says little
[22:02] children Believers dear ones guard
[22:05] yourselves from Idols from false
[22:08] teachings moral compro compromises and
[22:11] anything that would take the
[22:13] place take God's place in your heart and
[22:17] he says guard yourself from Idols of the
[22:19] Heart Guard yourself when with inletting
[22:22] something that takes over more
[22:24] importance than worshiping God it's all
[22:27] through the Bible and the one I like to
[22:29] bring is 2 Corinthians 10:3 for though
[22:32] we walk in the flesh we do not war after
[22:36] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[22:38] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[22:43] the pulling down of
[22:45] strongholds casting down
[22:48] imaginations and every High thing that
[22:52] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[22:54] God and bringing into captivity every
[22:58] thought to The Obedience of
[23:02] Christ how many of you do that how many
[23:04] of us do that every thought has to be
[23:08] checked that's right
[23:11] amen I Illustrated this a few months ago
[23:14] might have been in last year even that
[23:16] when we hit 911 it was a shock to the
[23:19] nation that an enemy could actually get
[23:21] so sneak so much into our system became
[23:25] pilots and an enemy could drive three
[23:27] planes and kill a bunch of people it was
[23:30] a shock we couldn't believe the enemy
[23:32] where did he get in at well he got
[23:33] trained to to run the
[23:36] airplanes for months maybe years nobody
[23:39] picked up on them it's a reflection
[23:41] friends that the enemy can get in places
[23:43] where you don't
[23:45] expect so after 911 our whole security
[23:49] system went Skyhigh can you say Amen our
[23:52] airports changed scanners were put in
[23:55] it's it's a it's a complicated thing to
[23:57] go through airports isn't it brother
[23:58] Tony but all of us do it we tolerate it
[24:01] we do it because why protections had to
[24:04] be put in place Hallelujah that the
[24:08] enemy can't get in that's sometimes it
[24:10] takes a 911 in your life to jolt you
[24:14] that's TR that you start putting some
[24:16] Protections in place with your phone and
[24:19] your computer and the books you read and
[24:22] the music you listen to and I'm not
[24:24] talking to young people this morning
[24:25] only I'm talking about every adult
[24:28] that's here every person every believer
[24:31] don't let a 911 happen in your life to
[24:35] joou listen to the preacher now you need
[24:37] a scanner on your
[24:39] thoughts you need a scanner on your
[24:42] heart you need a filter of the word of
[24:45] God to check every thought before it
[24:48] comes in
[24:49] [Applause]
[24:52] Hallelujah it says to take captivity
[24:55] every thought see that's the thing with
[24:57] imaginations that's right
[24:59] it's a realm that nobody
[25:01] sees you may never go to a movie
[25:04] theater but you can create your own
[25:06] movies in your
[25:08] imagination sexual
[25:10] lustful Vengeance on
[25:13] somebody and you enjoy it because you're
[25:15] not really doing it you're just
[25:17] imagining doing it your imagination has
[25:20] the power to do that but it doesn't make
[25:23] it right you haven't turned your
[25:25] imagination over to God that he could
[25:28] use your
[25:29] imagination and so now take into
[25:31] captivity every thought and there has to
[25:34] be a scanner on your thought life and on
[25:36] your heart and your emotions that you
[25:39] test every thought that's trying to come
[25:41] in everything that you're reading
[25:43] everything that you're listening to test
[25:45] the music by the spirit of
[25:48] God and
[25:52] uh if something's getting in that's not
[25:55] right you take into captivity that's
[25:58] right
[26:00] amen if if something's coming in through
[26:03] somebody don't mean to belittle him he's
[26:07] a nice guy but if he's carrying the
[26:10] wrong thing on him then a a wrong
[26:14] thought uh a lustful thought a hurtful
[26:17] comment somebody made this is all things
[26:19] that try to get into our system fear
[26:22] condemnation from the devil I I'm only
[26:25] mentioning a few of thousands of things
[26:28] that try to get into our spirit try to
[26:29] get into our heart they shouldn't be
[26:31] allowed in
[26:32] that's and the Bible says is that you
[26:35] stop it at the scanner no you're I'm not
[26:37] letting that in my thought life I'm not
