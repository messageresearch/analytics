========================================

appreciate that just one scripture this morning colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 and he is the head of the body christ is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we have the head which is christ christ is the word and the end goal of all time of god's achievement god's goal god's desire the end goal is that that he might the head he might have preeminence in all things and that can mean all of us all nations tongues people all that are in christ we're already in christ in his mind before the foundation of the world but see when we come to earth and we come in these bodies and his achievement is to bring all things under his preeminence but also we can apply this personally which is what i'll do this morning and given a little bit of my testimony and that is that when he brings this word and when he brings his headship to us the way that he has in the last days then he brings details of what we need to bring our lives underneath and that's time for us to fulfill the scripture in our personal lives that he the head would have preeminence in all things in our lives that's the goal and that's my desire this morning that's why i come to church i want to hear where i'm lacking i want to hear where i'm missing can you say man i want to hear those places that i don't have under his headship i wanted him to be lord not just savior but lord of every area of my life there's no closets there's no kingdoms in this heart that is not under his rulership i want him to have preeminence and and have his domain in each of my parts of my heart father we pray that you will bless these special people that have gathered this morning every one of them has a soul whether they be a visitor maybe they've never been here before but we all have one thing in common we have a soul and lord you know you have taught us from your word that that soul may reach out for other things of the world that would try to satisfy but we know that soul was created and made for god to dwell in and we have that in common this morning so it doesn't matter what stage anybody's at we have a soul all of us so we pray that that person who doesn't know you very well we pray that they would get to know you much better today maybe someone's been serving the lord for 30 years but yet lord that soul is still an important thing to give up to you this morning and to say father where can i yield myself more to you where can i surrender more to you we pray that you will anoint and bless and strengthen the body of christ that's here and around the world in jesus name amen god bless you why don't you shake your hands with somebody say god has given us the victory this morning god has given us the victory amen good to see the bachmann's in this morning as well from south carolina god bless you brother your wife amen you know from the beginning of time saints of god we realized that the the goal and the desire was that god established his kingdom on this earth we've been preaching a little bit about what this earth was even created for and he created it for his son and his daughter to rule and reign in and that his kingdom and god's kingdom is not just a physical place but it's actually kingdom principles it's his presence it's where it's a place where he's king and his subjects are subject to him and his principles and his commandments and his his his ways of life all those things are prevalent in his kingdom so god has sought to establish his kingdom in this earth from the very beginning that he would would hold a place of authority and headship in that kingdom and in that earth and that he would occupy the place as king for six thousand years he has not occupied the place on this earth as king there's been other men to rule there's been other influences that have ruled this earth but the the long-term goal the achievement of god is that finally that his kingdom would be established not in heaven but here on earth and uh that where he is occupied as king and by that that his word might have preeminence that his word as the king might have preeminence in that kingdom and on earth and then by that everything is running in that kingdom everything is running and functioning by kingdom principles and since the beginning he's been trying to establish his kingdom this way and he's been and he actually has used men to do it he put his son and daughter on earth and he was going to have them ruling on earth but it wasn't to rule in their own way it wasn't to rule for their own agenda it was established his kingdom on earth and he was going to use adam and eve to do that it was going to put his kingdom principles on this earth this earth was created for adam and eve and sons and daughters to rule and reign over it wasn't created for russia or for china or for the united states to rule and reign it was given to sons and daughters of god initially but the purpose was that his kingdom should rule and reign on earth that his ways his word and everything would be running by his kingdom principles so we know when he tried man then man men fell and actually throughout history we see god kept putting his trust in man he kept putting his he kept wanting to give his kingdom to men and they could never fully establish his kingdom on earth the way that he wanted it it always was interrupted he sent his word and then the people would receive it for a time and then they would go off into idolatry he sent his word through the prophets and he was in the reason he was saying is to bring his kingdom to the earth and man messed it up can you say amen from the fall in the garden all the way through but it's it's all been god trying to send his kingdom through the word of his prophet and for man to take it and establish it on the earth can you say amen to bring it into their lives to bring it into their families to bring it into them and just see this functioning on his his kingdom and to establish it the key is that we see the key and that was when he couldn't get men to establish it correctly then god came down himself god said i will go and become man like them and i will descend and i will come as a man like they are and i will show them how to establish the kingdom on earth because we know god in heaven but nobody could ever see yet nobody could ever catch what it was to bring his kingdom to earth and see it established in the earth so god says i'll go down aren't you glad he came down for you god says they can't get it right so i'm going to go down and i'm going to display to them i'm going to show them what it looks like [Music] i'm going to give them an example can you say man and i'm not just going to give them an example but i'm actually going to go to calvary i'm going to pay for every one of their sins i'm going to wash them by my blood so that they can come back into the place what they lost in the garden and fill them with the holy ghost so they actually have the kingdom of god within them because you can't establish this kingdom unless you have it in your heart first god said i'll i'll take care of that i'll do that because i know now he he knew all along but i know i need to come down and change the soul and change the nature of man and change everything about him and his desires so that he has within him the kingdom of god by the holy spirit and when he begins to yield to that finally there will be a people that establish his kingdom on earth not in heaven but in earth so he came to be like us our king came to us our king descended and came to us the king as all the many stories you've heard goes when the king wanted to come down and and mingle with his subjects and to find out how they lived and say find out how their hearts were and what he could do to help them their stories of kings coming and going incognito or going uh dressing in a a servant's clothing and just being among them and nobody knew it was the king and he come down and he he dressed like them he acted like them nobody knew it was the king of kings but he came down and mingled so that he could understand so that he can know to be tempted at every point so he could just know what it's like when you go to prayer and say god do you understand i'm going through this i'm being tempted by this and when you go to pray it's not a god that's saying i don't understand a thing that boy is saying but listen you've got a christ this morning that when you go with any knee he can say i understand i came as a king and i lived there on earth and i was tempted in all points like you are i'll tell you i can serve a king like that and so he came and there's one thing that i want to just lay as a foundation this morning like i said i want to get to my testimony it might be more my testimony this morning but he came and what was the key that helped what was the key that established the kingdom what was what was happening with this son christ that was establishing the kingdom and we learned from the bible what it was the bible says that jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered so that's such a powerful statement to let us know that this son came and he went through a process of learning obedience so that's a key word is that if we want to see his kingdom established then it won't come without obedience on our part it won't come without repentance on our part it won't come without a heart that says i want to be obedient to the principles of god and this is what we found in jesus christ he came and he says i do nothing except my father shows me and he was trying to influence by different influences do things this way but he was committed to do things and live a life in front of us that was only what the father had given only by the word of god every day he walked in the vision of the word of god every day for three and a half years of ministry he walked according to what the father had put in the word what the prophets had said in the word he lived by the first time he came to be baptized by john john goes why do you you're the lamb of god why do you need to be baptized and jesus said thus it becometh us to fulfill the word of god to fulfill all righteousness so even the son is completely this sin this this skinless son of god is completely obedient this is the way the word says to come i must be baptized people say i don't need that i don't know no if you come to god his pathway you have to repent you have to say i want to be baptized and i'll just stop and say this we've got some new ones if god's leading you to take that step you can't be baptized in titles you have to be baptized in his name you have to fully repent to come into this you can't come into a church and just start raising your hand and say i'm a part of it because i'm here you have to repent of your sins you have to be baptized and if you're baptized in titles you want to be re-baptized into his name and we'll be glad to do that no matter who's being led that way i'd be glad to baptize you today if it took today next sunday whatever it is but you need to take that step if jesus took that step you should take that step set yourself as a candidate for the holy ghost peter said repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so you can't bypass repentance you can't bypass baptism you've got to say lord i'm willing to take the steps jesus said jesus walked jesus did not function outside of what the word said thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness so whatever god our king sent as a commandment i'm living by that and not by what the pharisees say not by what the denominations are saying not by what other influencers says saying i'm going to do it by the word of god can i get a greater amen this morning i'm going to do it by the word of god so we see this example and then so skip ahead to the end he walked every day only by what the word said he never got outside of that word and at the end he even walks on the via dolorosa the way of suffering then he walks up to calvary he has nails put in his hands his nails put in his feet he's pierced in his side he goes there why because the word said he would and as a man he had a choice to say i'll do everything else but i'm not doing that that sounds very familiar oh i could preach now where you start to pick and choose what parts of the word you're going to follow in your example jesus christ didn't do that all the way to the end when when he said the prophecies the prophecies said he'll suffer the prophecy said he was led as a lamb to the slaughter he's going to be obedient and he's going to walk right into that word meaning his own death but then there's prophecies of a resurrection so how did jesus establish the kingdom how was the establishment came i hope you're learning something if you're interested in establishing his kingdom not your own not your bosses not bidens not trumps [Applause] it's not about their kingdom can you say man yeah you know how crazy every day in the news they're gonna fix racism all the football players have end racism on the back of their helmets can you imagine how haughty it is and how bold it is to say we're going to get the answer someday to end racism without the blood of jesus christ on the heart you will never ever in racism and i don't believe is this it's just bad in this country is what what it used to be but nevertheless that's not the argument the army is you'll never purge it completely because you haven't purged the heart yet you'll never end racism can you say man how can man how can presidents how people say that our democratic or republican agenda is going to solve the problem it's going to solve the global warming it's going to stop and that's what they're saying now the democrats are saying the biggest problem on earth the biggest issue we have is global warming and i'm i'm saying lord what kind of president do we have open up his eyes the biggest problem we have is global warming look around [Applause] no that's not the biggest problem the biggest problem is our lives are without the holy ghost in their lives that's the biggest problem but when you talk about his kingdom that's the things you start talking about and that's why when the holy ghost comes that's what ends racism that's what ends prejudiced that's when a brother embraces brother and there is no distinction in their race we're all from the same race and there is no distinctions on what you wear whether you got fancy clothes on today or whether you got overalls on you got the same outfit you've been wearing for four sundays it doesn't matter you can come here and worship the god and anytime we start to get a click in here that it's about what we wear or about how much money we have or how fancy our trucks are may god help us to hit and alter repentance because the holy ghost never emphasizes those things the holy ghost makes us brothers together [Applause] the key was obedience through the things he suffered when all kingdom principles are tested and he is tempted by satan to do things another way which how may know the lord was tempted by satan do it this way he's even using the word do it this way fall down on my feet command these stones to be made to bread and he would not budge i will not do things your interpretation of the word satan i will do it according to the king's commandment the word will always have first place and so now then even though the church got the spirit in the book of acts of his kingdom in their hearts many got away from that and still could not fully establish his kingdom on earth and so we have 2 000 years of church history where denominations came in where men's ideas came in people started to not preach about the holy ghost anymore but he said as long as you have a knowledge of the bible it's enough they begin to build schools they begin to build seminars they begin the unit of the dark ages where the church itself became the salvation for people instead of the blood of jesus christ so i'm summarizing 2 000 years of history for you you should say thank you to me i'm summarizing that men the the purpose god had for filling the holy ghost to establish his kingdom on earth they got away from it again so jumping ahead it's in this end time that god says i'll send my word again and it's prophesied this time this time there's gonna be a people that give him full preeminence i'm gonna hand over to the people and when i hand my word to the people in the end time through my prophet the king will be handed back the full preeminence the complete preeminence in all things the people will respond and say he's here he sent it again but this time did he ever send a mighty word that there be no questions about what the king feels about things i'm going to read some quotes to you today that detail the detail of how specific god would breathe on his people for the end time and to give us what we need to be able to live and establish his kingdom in our marriages in our homes in our churches and get us ready to break into a millennium where it will be all about his kingdom on this earth i don't know about you but i want to be a part of that millennium i want to be a part of that i don't know about you but i want to be a part of a people and a part of a church and a part of god's move in the last days to finally see his kingdom established notice how it happens again even in our own ranks that we have the precious word from the king and we have ministers to take the same word and establish their own kingdom their own church doing it again and god says no you're using it for the wrong reasons i have tried for 6 000 years and i'm going to send my word but somebody at the end time is going to get a hold of this word and somebody is going to give him the word preeminence in everything in their lives somebody's going to do it is it you this morning somebody's going to do it because he wouldn't send it unless there was somebody to receive it you can go with your own agenda you can leave here this morning with your own goals and ambitions and achievements that's that's wonderful but if you ever consider what god's achievement is for this hour have you ever considered what god's achievement is for your life have you ever prayed and said not my will but thine be done in the end time the king will bring his word and the king will be handed over the complete preeminence in all things because it will be in this hour god gave his word in our time that is more deep detailed than ever before if he has to become the head of all things then he will speak his word in specifics of all things never before have we received a word that has opened our precious bibles to us so much that a christian would know how to live and how to yield to god and what do i do about this and what i do about that and that's my testimony this morning when god filled me with the holy ghost at 16 years old i developed an incredible hunger for the word of god i devoured my bible i want to know what the king said about stuff i want to know about every subject that he addressed and incidentally my testimony is is god is more specific than what we ever realize about stuff in your life he created you he created this whole thing so he wouldn't give us a world to live in without his commandment and his kingship and his word and principle this is how you this is how christians do it this is how believers do it you've heard your whole life how the world does it you've listened to the hollywood stars how they live their lifestyles but when you become interested in the king's commandment then you say lord i'm shutting all of that out a young girl 15 years old and say lord i'm something has happened to me and i'm shutting out all the voices of immodesty and i'm going to look to what the king said that a girl should wear praise the lord so there's an interesting scripture here in ecclesiastes 8 if you guys could bring that up ecclesiastes 8 i don't know what verse it is um might be verse one i don't know who is as the wise man who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed who is as the wise man baptist men who is it and who knoweth the interpretation really in our own our wisest men of the earth don't know it all saying the question who who really knows who has the final word on things who has enough wisdom to figure it all out go to the wisest man on earth and that's still going to be limited and that's why we seek the wisdom of god because he is unlimited he has all knowledge he knows all things so that's why we see god who is a wise man who knows the interpretation of thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine and boldness of his face shall be changed that's what the wisdom of god does to you i counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that regard of the oath of god hold right there i counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that in regard of the oath of god in other words if you make an oath to the king then the next step is to keep the king's commandment because the king is not just the king and you have a ceremony and they do this to come into our country to become a citizen they have to come in and they have to you know learn certain things of our our uh constitution all these things and they have to know certain things and they go through a test and then they have to go have a ceremony and take an oath to become a citizen i don't know why any of the rest of the americans that sometimes we need other americans to take that as well you know we get it by birth we get our citizenship but there's a lot of americans don't follow the principles of our country but you see now when you take an oath to the king i swear my allegiance to the king i come down to the altar and i give i'm giving my heart to the lord that's only the first step this king is not just wanting you to have a ceremony or a service where you say i pledge my oath to the king but he says i counsel them to keep the king's commandment he's going to give you principles to live by he's going to establish his kingdom in your life and when you give your heart to the lord you say then now what is the king's commandments what is the king's wishes how does the king want me to live is anybody hearing me here this morning it goes on to say in verse 3 be not hasty to go out of his sight his presence don't ever be hasty to go out of the king's presence if you swore north to him you better stay in his presence you better camp yourself close to his throne can i get an amen be not hasty to go out why is he saying that why is he saying that because we in our flesh will be hasty to get outside of his domain to work outside of his dominion to work outside of his presence don't be hasty to do that you work within his presence you stay within earshot of his throne because he's going to issue guidance for you you s park yourself build your house build your life within close close proximity to the king stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever please of him the next scripture says where the word of a king is there's power and who may say unto him what doest thou like paul said about the pot the pottery saying to the potter why have you made me this you can imagine a piece of pottery looking up and saying why are you bolding me this way what are you doing pottery can't say that that's where we become pliable in the hands of god you don't ask god how he's going to make you just let him mold you i don't know if i want to be that way well you haven't got all of the rebellion out of you yet but when you come to the potter's house you say i'm jumping up on the potter's wheel and i'm letting the potter mold me the way he wants and who can say to the potter why have you made me this and who says to the king what doest thou no because he has all wisdom he we don't question that can you say amen where the word of the king is i love that there's power there's authority who may say unto him what what doest thou in the next scripture whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment i want to read verse 5 again in the amplified and then i'll get on to my testimony amplified version verse 5 whosoever whoever keeps and observes a royal command will experience neither trouble nor misery really there's power in the commandment of the king that under that authority you'll be protected whoever observes a royal i love that a wrong this isn't just a commandment that's why the problem with people it's his commandments it's this do's and don'ts it's just and god needs to change your heart because think about it if you look at it like a royal commandment that your king has issued something very personal to you very specific and if you look at it oh man i've had teenagers say every time i turn around here it's just another rule anybody ever had teenagers tell you every time i can't get out i can't wait someday wednesday and i just walk about 18 years old somehow they say 18 you're out from underneath the headship of your parents when i get 18 i'm getting out of all this i'm getting away from all this and then there's parents saying yeah that's right you have to do what i say until you're 18. and then you'll do what you want what hello you're setting yourself up for a disaster both the child and you if authority is in our lives it's always in our lives because of protection and his love and his royal commandment if we look at it that way that it's the it's the king's royal if you looked at the message that way which by grace of god i look at it that way i don't see just a man okay i'm not deifying anybody the prophet of this hour and any prophet was a human being and they're not deity including our profit of this hour they're not deity you'll find pockets within our our belief group that believe that i don't believe it this church doesn't believe it it's idolatry it's heresy i don't believe that but i do believe in god's prophets and i do believe they can be god to the people in this sense they're bringing the king's commandment through their lips so it's not about the man it's about the authority in a man and if god puts his authority in that man to speak the word then you better not look at it as the man you better be saying i'm hearing the king's commandment i'm hearing a royal command come from my king and i swore my oath to him at the altar one day and now i'm waiting to hear what comes next from the royal commandments of my king praise the lord i'm having a good time with this whosoever keeping the command shall feel no evil thing and a wise man and i love how the amplified says it he shall this is incredible promise for you to latch onto this morning whosoever keepeth keeps and observe a royal command will experience neither trouble nor misery now i know some of us has experienced some trouble and misery but what kind of trouble and misery are we talking about you might go through trouble in misery but if you're under the king's command there's a certain protection over your life that satan can only go so far he's not going to take you all the way satan can't take you all the way you're going to you're not going to go off the deep end if you're in the word and under the king's command you'll never go too far you'll never blaspheme the holy ghost if you have the holy ghost you'll never blaspheme the holy ghost if you are under his protection in his word your mind might be falling apart sometime but satan can never fully have you so don't ever think that satan's got me he's taken me i'm finished i got a promise here that says if you're living under a royal commandment of the king your king's going to watch over you [Applause] so now preeminence is a superior is superiority in rank it's precedence it's before it's above and that's what i'm speaking on this morning if you have my subject preeminence in all things preeminence and all things to understand preeminence that scripture and that word priority of place he has the first place the king's commandment has first place superiority of power or influence and that's where i'd like to begin a little bit of my testimony the superiority of power influence something happened in my life when i received his spirit and when you bring up things like the superiority of power and influence who has the greatest influence in your life it brings other questions who has the final say of things in your life your wife your husband oh that's a sticky one you know there's a certain the headship trickles down there and we understand that but who has who has the final say of everything in your life why do you have to say that brother paul i'm at church let me get off of my back i'm here because it's not about being its church it's that who has who has the final say with everything in your life is it what you heard on the internet is it your upbringing that wasn't fully balanced is it a preacher you were under that wasn't fully balanced is it denominational ideas somebody influences your life some people have baggage from their past terrible terrible baggage and guess what that baggage is an everyday influence on their everyday decisions they're making decisions based upon a filter and that filter is their past and this happened to me way back here so i will never do this this way again because of this hurt or this what happened back here so uh and this your decisions on a daily daily basis are imbalanced because they're not influenced by the word they're influenced by your past we're a creature that can be influenced by so many things make decisions in life because they've fed on disney movies their whole life and those decisions are influenced by their disney influence you you go ahead and chuckle in your heart and say that can't be true listen i've seen it firsthand i've seen it firsthand what influences in your life who has the final say now who decides things what influence will be given to those decisions for all the things in your life this is the hour we're in this is the word the hour in this is the work of the lord going on now it's not that we know that jesus was god we know that or that he paid for our redemption we know that or that god sent a prophet we know that it's the power of redemption working in our lives how many want the power of redemption work in our life we know christ is the redeemer we know he went to calvary we already know that we know god sends prophets we understand that but what we're really considering is that is the power of redemption working in our lives our obedience to the word makes the authority of god begin to flow through our body and the bride is the one that gives the king finally and hands over this is what i would talk about this morning something when i was young made me hand over the the influence of my decision making process i handed it over most of it but over time i handed over all of it he must have the pre-intimate preeminence so by the holy ghost at 16 years old i made a decision i said lord and this is 16 years old now so you got this is a pretty young man and so i still have you know immaturities to work through but something happened to me and one night while the word was being preached i didn't go to the altar till the end but i knew something changed in me while the word was being preached i didn't speak in tongues which some churches would say well you didn't get it then i'm telling you in the book of acts church when they come out of the upper room it wasn't unknown tongues it says other tongues and everybody heard them in their own language so it was not unknown tongues and that is not the evidence of the holy ghost it's one of the gifts in the church one of the nine spiritual gifts pentecost took it and made it the initial evidence of the holy ghost but that is not the evidence of the holy ghost if that's true i don't have the holy ghost but i know i have the holy ghost today but i know it by the identification of what happened to me in the fruits that followed the biggest evidence i could see is something was changed in me and i no longer had a desire in nature for the things of the world but i had this craving and hunger for the word of god and when the word of god was preached in here in here there was no more resistance matter of fact when it was the true word something down here said amen every time amen because the holy ghost agrees with every word of god that's the evidence you have it it agrees and it receives every word of god especially for this age that's the evidence forget about all the other evidences you've been taught it's always linked with the word and if you say the holy ghost you have the holy ghost and you reject any part of the word something's wrong with your experience you've got a rebellion says i ain't doing that you've got a problem in your experience because the holy ghost always says amen now i will admit to you when i was sitting in services sometimes my mind was resisting my flesh was resisting that's a real hard experience to be in because my flesh didn't want to hear preaching that was hard sometimes because i wanted to do my first one to do what it wanted to do so when i got preached on when i got all 10 toes stepped on god took the height off of me sometimes what was funny happening is my trust was going i wanted to get up and walk out just sneak out i wanted to go my mind was struggling but down here there wasn't anything struggling every time it issued a real strong amen can't stand that guy that's telling me right now i'm mad at him but my soul's saying buddy you know he's telling you the truth how many raise your hand you experienced that before because because you're because your body and your mind and your spirit is not born again only your soul this is our journey this is our struggle bring in the body and the mind under subjection to what the amenner says this is the this is preeminence that this body and all things and all decisions is come under the headship of the king and whatever issues from this throne because he's not somewhere up on the throne there now now he's he set up his his throne right here whatever is preached and utters from here that flesh just picks up and says you're going like the times that you're sitting at home and it's an hour before church and you've been running yourself ragged and you've been going going going you've been to walmart you've been to meyers you've been on the the school the homeschool uh field trip and you have worked in the yard to get the billions of leaves away and you have got the law and you put the whole and you you're sitting there on wednesday night or sunday and you're completely just completely bushed and you know you've been everywhere you've done everything and your wife says you better get ready it's time to go to church and right there's a battle jaden did you know that right there's a battle that goes on you know you know the story about the wife that kept telling her husband to get out of bed and go to church and he kept resisting he says i don't want to go he said i'll give you two reasons i don't feel like it and those people don't like me there and she said well i'll give you two reasons to go she said it will do you good and you're the pastor so then the battle just oh my goodness wow yeah and i've had this happen so much in my life where my mind is going through how tired i am and then something resonates something begins to churn the churn in the soul something begins to rise up and something begins at night wait a minute i know how much i love the word i know how much i know it's love his presence so there's a battle but eventually that soul if i yield to it it wins the battle wins the battle and it overcomes all tiredness because if i can go to walmart and i got the energy to go to walmart and i can go on the field trip and i can run all over the place how did i lose all the energy to go hear the word of god don't forget today this is my testimony i'm preaching on myself okay not you guys something rises up and though the body is saying i think i'll stay right here something grabs me pulls me up and says you're going to church amen so the soul is it's a battle and so the holy ghost i got into the word like never before and then i said if god was gracious enough and you visitors have patience with me today if you don't understand the scriptures i'll be glad to take the time after the service or any time with you god has sent us a real restorative ministry he's the man has passed and gone on but in malachi 4 and luke 17 30 in about probably eight to ten key scriptures even jesus talks of one he said elias will come and restore all things it speaks of a one-man ministry with the spirit of elijah to bring us back to the word okay so let me share with you if you want to i'll be glad you i'll be quoting from him a little bit today i'll be quoting from the scripture but it's because this became such an influence on my life when i knew this was the authority of god the man's gone the man's out of the picture but the word that he was bringing was bringing me back to this bible i devoured this and i devoured the message of the last days i wanted to know if god this is what i said if god was gracious enough to send a prophet to my generation in my own language then i ought to be humble enough to take the time to hear what he said i'm telling you that's exactly what i thought that's exactly what i said if i'm 16 years old i've got some time here i'm not married i don't have 50 kids yet i don't have bills myself i'm going to take the time and listen and find out what he said i'm going to take my bible and as brother branham himself said don't just take my word for it he said check it out with the word because it has to ring true with this bible brother branham says this is our absolute this is our absolute not the word of a man but where the prophets will bring us back to our absolute and so that's what i did but i devoured that message and what i found was is that i couldn't believe how detailed it was for my generation about certain things and how to live i developed this hunger for the word of god the the evidence of the holy ghost was in me i was receiving the word for my day and i wanted to have more of it i'm so glad that god got a hold of me early in life i'm so happy for that god touched my life young people don't wait till someday and say i'll go to the lord when i get married i'll go to the lord when i do this that and the other don't wait this morning turn your life over to jesus christ right now i'm so glad god got me before i fed on a lot of trash i played some video games you know and uh i dabbled in some of that you know they were mild like the four i really liked the four-wheeler uh video games the atv that was a lot of fun i actually was winning on some of those pac-man uh and you know people are laughing because there's only certain generation knows what i'm talking about but i'll mention the other ones here in a minute but but you know i i did this and i did the young people participating this so i didn't but i found i quickly lost interest i didn't become obsessed with it if i if i played it it's fine to play the four wheel game man i might still get on with somebody and play it it's not a crime to do that but my interest had changed and i didn't i wasn't feeding on that stuff like like it was an obsession because something had set up kingship in my life remember now preeminence is the security of superiority of the influence in your life and i come under such a strong influence feeding on the message alone myself it placed most of my deciding of right and wrong was handed over to what i read in my bible and in the message there was a i and i just yielded i don't it's just the holy ghost i yield most of my decisions about right and wrong were yielded and handed over to what i'd find in the bible or the message and i let that decide for me is that okay with everybody and it wasn't long before the things i read affected me it influenced me the games the movies the music all came under the headship of jesus christ the word everything was filtered everything became censored the filter of the word of god is what i brought all those things through and if it didn't come through that filter well i'd never even touched it again i don't even want to go there something happened to me that i allowed this to become such a strong filter that i would not allow myself to dabble in something unless i'd taken it through the filter of the word i noticed how that prepared to me to be a father it prepared me for so many things these quotes and it was pretty slim pickings when you go to chart start to choose movies today which there are some decent movies to watch our family watches some of them every now and then i don't have any time to hardly do that now but uh i can tell you even when i was 16 years old it was very slim pickings what movies i could watch because why the filter of the holy ghost you need that in your life it couldn't make it through the filter and so when that test came it's like nat can't do that not doing that not do that then every once in a while slim pickings you find something well isn't isn't that nice no cussing no swearing no sexual individuals and no women dressed wrong i had a pretty strong filter from the word of god get to see a movie it's got some wholesomeness to it that's what we let our children watch my children grew up on little house on the prairie basically that's it right guys that's it little house in the prairie veggie tales very very slim slim pickings of what we allowed the kids and so why did i raise my family that way because i had already been through a process that somehow i turned over all these decisions to the word to the message and if i got a hint from the king through that word it was enough for me now if you go away here thinking thinking that i've been perfect since then i never made a mistake that's not true that i've never looked at something wrong that's not true we're human beings we make mistakes we get carnal we get fleshly what i find about a holy ghost christian is that he could hardly get through something that's cussing or bad or worldly or something on the inside registers and he can't hardly get through it without feeling a whole lot of conviction god please forgive me i have just offended your spirit help me lord to stop doing that there's some preachers to tell you when you've got the holy ghost at the altar you'll never do something like that i don't agree with that that's that's a sinless perfection in the flesh but there is a power of the holy ghost that's not watered down and if you'll yield to it it'll give you the filter to overcome the things of the world and your satisfaction will be in the holy ghost and in his word and fellowship with the saints and joy that makes you want to dance like i felt this morning when the choir was singing that's the joy that you want [Applause] my satisfaction doesn't come from some drink in some bar or some movie or something in the world i have found what really gets me going some of you need that this morning and it's not just some theological thing all you've got to do is say i'm ready lord to surrender everything to you this morning i just the last few months i've been pondering these things so much while i'm talking about authority but then i looked at my own life i said lord what is it what was it that gave that message so much authority in my life for decision making what in the world i've been pondering that that a young man would would hand over my cues and what i would do on a daily basis i was looking for something in that word something where he pointed to the bible something that he went through personally himself and he learned and i'm just on to i said that that applies and i'd hand over the decision and that that would make the decision for me what kind of authority how did i what did i do such strong influence the priority of the greatest influence in my life became that i'm asking why did i do that and the devil always has this explanation to me in my ear well you know you were raised in this and then next he says you know you're probably too scared to do anything else but this so i'm working through all this with the devil's voice and if you have the thai post of the holy ghost you have to say no no no no no i'm glad i was raised in this but something happened to me at 16 years old and now that i'm older i don't have to follow this at all that's what i said wednesday night it's true i can do whatever i want this morning if i wanted to leave this church and go to sidelines bar and sit at the bar and have a drink after church i am afr i can go do that but guess what i don't want to and if you have something in there yeah i can't wait to finish preaching so i can go get a drink you need the holy ghost you need the holy ghost because if you have the holy ghost you're not worried about running off to anywhere else you're actually not looking at the clock i hope this preacher preaches another hour i don't have anywhere else to go right now that's kind of thoughts of the holy ghost is that i hope he keeps preaching i'm loving this i'm enjoying this or something saying amen down on the inside [Applause] and sherry has a song it's true i can do whatever i want but my wants been rearranged is that how it goes it's true i can do you see people think that's oh no you can't no you can't you're a christian you can't do what you want yes i can this morning i can do whatever i want but my wants have been changed that's it my wants have been changed amen so the devil says you're too scared to do it you grew up in this no no devil no something's changed and i know i'm doing it now because i don't have to do this i don't have to do any of this but i'm still doing it and doing it because i heard the king's royal commandments come to me and i come under his authority when the devil says you're doing this because you grew up in it or you're too scared to do anything else and work outside i better do it or mom and dad's going to be looking at me when satan says that it sounds reasonable and you may be conforming there's a lot of message kids that grew up in a message pew that don't have the holy ghost yet they know things are right but you don't have the power to live it yet because you're making your own decisions and you're not searching that message to order your life i love you i'm going to tell you the truth it sounds reasonable that it's satan says it's you were raised in it does tell you ones that are in that condition to conform to something instead of be transformed it only lasts so long if you're just still conforming to it because you're scared afraid i'm scared afraid it doesn't last very long and you become miserable so miserable kind of like a marriage staying together just because the message and the word says stay together how miserable is that i have to stay together with her because the word says to do it and i would be embarrassed if somebody seen that we were separated and then god has this holy spirit that comes in your life and you really fall in love according to god's divine love with one another and you don't want out anymore you actually look at that person in their soul and you love them and they love you because of their soul first and you fall deeper in love you don't mind me saying something brother this couple right here something happened a few weeks ago in the service i won't give the details to embarrass him but he doesn't mind me testifying god supernaturally brought this marriage back together and they are deeper in love today than they've ever been before after 17 years see you see this is not this is not just sermons friends this is not just do's and don'ts there's a power with the word of a king 17 years these guys been together and almost almost ended and god had a minister here and spoke just the right thing bang bang bang and they're more in love than they'd ever been i thank god for that follow god's counsel follow god's word you'll never be disappointed something deeper must happen in my life to hand over the authority of my life to what the prophet said to trust it to give the final say of what i would do or what i don't don't do in the word of god i'm not talking about your testimony today i'm just sharing my testing this is what happened to me i'm not going to hide the fact that at 16 years old there was such a a release of the authority of my life given to that word that i was looking for the littlest little hints from it and trusted it i'm going with it amen and i found god has a true answer to everything in my life there's a lot of other influences out there but he has a word for everything in my life in this generation god has a word i believe for everything in our lives but sometimes it takes a while to dig for it people don't want to dig you got to dig when you start a building you start with one shovel and you gotta start digging you gotta start you dig for things you gotta start researching the word and finding out what did god say about this it was amazing to me i'd find things that i wouldn't normally find everywhere i wouldn't normally think that it was in the word of god and i'd say i'm right i'm all over it i didn't know that he said that you know i was in the uh i was in the health food store the other day with mom and she had to get some stuff and uh so i was in the health food store she got out one of the um i don't know you know the person to give her advice you know some of the things that she was feeling going through she was going to get some herbs for it whatever what uh the homopathetic or doctor homeopathic homopathy okay just a tad of sarcasm that lady started to talk to her and so she addressed some things and i said some things and and what i was amazed to find is that in this store packed full of stuff there was like an herb or something that you could take for just about every that would affect every area of your body and it wasn't a synthetic the the medicines which you know they're very critical of and i thank god for all things he gives us but these things are better for you than taking the medicines and so sometimes we have to take the medicines and that's fine but but you know she was so she was calling this homopathic doctor was calling that stuff poison i mean this is where she is when you're going to stop taking that poison for your blood pressure and start taking something natural because god through the earth has created things and it's amazing to be everybody well i'm having trouble with my knees and she walks over there and she's she's going to a certain section for your knees and then mom and you know she's had a little trouble with her liver so she yes right over here and i'm going i'm sitting there thinking do they have a pill for every part of your body and then i'm thinking i i didn't ask her i was gonna think how first i was gonna ask her how many pills are you taking every morning i didn't ask but i thought how many pills can you take every day because i mean i want it all i mean i want every part of my body every part to be affected i want it to be healthy you know i'm already taking you know 10 of them every morning how am i going to get all this in but anyway i'm being sarcastic but here's what it is if the natural traits are spiritual all you healthy people don't think i'm preaching against that this morning i'm for it because what i learned is that if they've got something that's not poison and not that and that can affect that that helps somebody which mom's already being helped by what she's taken praise the lord but but see this is a type because the world has hits what it provides for you entertainment so whatever else sports you can't replace sports for your craving for god don't do it don't teach your children to do it no that there's only one thing that meets that craving but if they have something like that then that told me i was saying i'm getting ready to preach this series and i said that's it i said then god has to have everything in his word every question that i have everything that i go through every little detail of life my finances and everything he's got to have something there that will give me direction and before all the financial advisors come up with stuff before all the worldly wisdom was out there god was before the wisdom of this world boy i better move on here now my goodness can you pull up that first quote so here's here's some examples okay it's gonna get real ah sticky here real what should i call it i've got a real rubber meets the road that's the type of preacher i am so everybody put your seat belts on all right so when i started to feed on the word now i could read you a million of these quotes but that's the stuff i'd find you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take that television out are you ready to take that deck of cards off the table them comic books that your children's reading preparing their little minds for a blast that the devil's going to give them are you ready to establish the old family altar again or do you just want to continue on the way that you are it's just a paragraph it's saying a lot like i told you i got direction in this first of all i was 16 years old i got direction how to be a father how to lead a home you got to read those children the word of god you got to establish the old family altar in the home again and if i'm going to be a father mother are you ready to establish that altar in your house you can't just have an alternate church you've got to have an altar in your house you've got to prayer with your family and your marriage if you don't have any kids you and your marriage your wife your family so this is teaching me it's given me the king's cues for how to live and establish his kingdom in my home take that television out and a lot of the reason that he is speaking these things because was initially when television came out there was no filter on it there was nothing on there that was good it couldn't be used for something good there's one comedy he made he said if the god would have got a hold of it it would have been the greatest instrument for the gospel the television so now it becomes about what's on it not so much the instrument of it but when he speaks of it it looks like he's talking about the instrument but if if that were true it was the instrument uh and the actual screen then none of you should be watching these quotes on these big tvs right here this morning right but it's not about the instrument it's about what you put on it we talked about getting it out you better get out of your home the wrong things that are on things like that is that okay with everybody are you ready to take the deck of cards off the table wow them comic books that your children are ringing now comic books and i went back and looked at this is 1963 and i said comic books how bad were they in 1963 and i went back and you know it was amazing to find the comic books that brother branham is saying you let your children feed on those comic books in 1963 it's preparing their little minds for a blast the devil's going to get them most time i read that to people you might even be laughing yourself if you're hearing on the internet or whatever you might be laughing at this comment from this prophet in 1963 from brother branham you might laugh at this comment but sometimes it takes time to see the effects to see that's exactly the truth and you're a parent to watch over the minds of your children and he's hitting at these comic books that was amazing to me in 1963 it's spider-man it's incredible hulk it's the marvel avengers in comic form and does anybody know that now they've taken those heroes and making movies out of them now i don't know i haven't seen one of them but all these names i see pop up the avengers and marvel series and the the new one and the girls were telling me yesterday that the new one is specific about seven days before a tribulation sets in so now all these things preparing their minds preparing their minds for what for tribulation i'm prepared for it to get quiet this morning because i know that nobody's talking about these things not hardly any preachers are talking about them but i'm telling you all i needed was a prophet and a man of god who lived a holy life to say to me and it's not about the man i feel like he's given me something to establish the kingdom of god in my home if i'm going to keep the avengers and let my kids minds fill up with that then i'm jeopardizing the kingdom being in my home and it'll be a kingdom of the avengers it'll be the heroes of the incredible hawk instead of the heroes of the bible so i at 16 17 years old i'm saying lord thank you when i have children i'm going to watch over those things it's not going to be any comic book or any cards or any kind of thing played or anything god help me because i am not interested in preparing their little minds for what the devil's going to give them i don't need to hassle with that i don't need to argue with that i don't need to laugh at that i don't need to have i need i don't need to go research it any further i don't need to verify it there's a man of god saying it and then when you're growing the lord you go back and find scriptures set no evil thing before you avoid the very appearance of evil and you think those scriptures don't apply to all these comic books and things of the world yes they do but a prophet is saying it in our own language so we understand how to establish the kingdom and the only way to establish the kingdom is for us to be obedient to the word of god it doesn't come on brother paul that doesn't have effect on the mind those comic books from knight c can have an effect the devil can use that but i'm sure he couldn't use the video games that are out today i believe that you should stay away from those comic books but the stuff that i'm feeding on it doesn't affect me the comics of 1963 can have an effect on the mind but not assassin's creed not the legend of zelda not the curse of the dead gods not grand theft auto not world of demons i'm fine i'm neutral with it it's fun you're fun with the world of demons it's called the world of demons it blatantly tells you what world you're in and you're fine with it you may need the holy ghost 63 comics are bad but there's nothing wrong with a video game called stronghold warlords one called no more heroes what a lie good that doesn't affect the mind at all i'm sure it doesn't even though all of science now is speaking that it does affect the mind it caused suicide it's caused breakup from marriage had one in my own family not here but another family member just about destroyed the marriage of him sitting and feeding on his video games didn't want to go to work didn't want to eat didn't want to give relation to his wife didn't want to do anything but play the video game that's called an addiction and i've got a blood of jesus christ that can deliver you from all addictions i'm here to tell you it does affect your mind it does affect your spirit [Applause] and the reason you keep dabbling in it is because you don't have something to turn over the authority in your life to the king jesus and when you do things are going to get a lot better can you say amen i was a young pastor and i was asked if it's okay i'm going to ask you this special congregation today would somebody please give me about 20 more minutes if you have to go you got something going or whatever just you you're dismissed you can go um but i'm asking for that because i've preached this series for three sundays trying to get to this and i'm staying here until i get it done that's terrible isn't it you ever heard a minister say that i'll tell you it's terrible man this keem this oil keeps falling off my pulpit when i hit it real hard so now i was asked if it was okay young pastor been pastoring 30 plenty years i think and i was asked if it was okay for a man and woman to drink a little drink together a little alcohol together with one another maybe a little social drink and as a young pastor i was asked a lot of other things too and guess what i didn't have a clue what to tell them when i first started passing i wasn't married so i got to ask a lot of questions that i had to defer to someone else i got to ask a lot of things some things i was very surprised some things i said i'm going to leave that alone but i was asked that question is it right for christian to just you know not to be out here in the bars and all that but just you know for a man and woman to take a little drink together and i never thought of that before i'd never thought of god got me early so i didn't get involved in drinking and all these other things i never thought of a social drink where it's more social and i just thought we all knew as christians that that is when you do that it's actually bearing the image of the world that's what they do so i just common sense says whatever they do we probably want to do the opposite they have a little social drink with their wife but i said i figured what we do is different because we're christians and we're different and that was the simple thing but sometimes that's not a good enough answer you know but that's the way i thought about and you know the thing is is that set aside the alcohol it's the image of what the world does set aside the alcohol in it it's not really about the alcohol because some of you have more alcohol in your nyquil so it can't be about just the alcohol because you could order a non-alcoholic you could do but you see now it's not about that just like it's not about the tv technically it's about the image of the world and we christians don't want to bear the image of the world it's just that it's just that we're we're we're through with saying god i'm from your kingdom now and a lot of things you find in the message is about that people struggle with it why did brother ram say that right this that and the other but you see now it's about it's i'm going to show you a quote in a minute it's not about god god's prophet calling you something you think he called me this because i'm doing this it's not that it's what it can lead to it's the image of it it's the testimony i teach our young people you got a good testimony now hold on to your testimony as a christian your testimony is everything it's not about how much money you make what do you want to be known for in this world what do you want your testimony to be and for me as a young man i want to give the best representation of what a christian looks like as i can and that would not be with a martini in my hand socially this is the quote amongst many of them and that private life oh that's a great thing now you know we want our own private life if we want a social drink with a neighbor that's our business if we want if we women want to cut our hair that's what that's our own american privilege if we want to wear shorts and all that's true that is your american privilege i'm not talking about your american privilege i'm talking about a kingdom where a people is coming under the preeminence of what the king says i'm talking about daughters of god and say i have the right to cut my hair but what's the king say what's the word say go ahead and do it if you feel there was a girl i tell you tell her about sometimes so the girl young girl on our church said i just can't stand i want to go i don't i want to feel what it's like to go get a bikini on and go to the beach i want to do it i just and my wife just said well go do it go get a bikini and get on the beach what terrible advice but you wanted it so bad well go do it you can do what you want and she went and did it come back a few months later that's not what i want that was terrible please forgive me god forgive me see if you've got something else resonating on the inside you try to be like the world and their image and you come to the conclusion i wasn't called to that i was called to this kingdom some of you need to decide that [Applause] it's my american privilege to do that am i american i'm not my private life listen but out of it you're probably saying to that to me some of you this morning said you know what i'm ready to get up and get out of here this guy's probing into my private life here i'm sorry to do that but god will do it even more than i will because if you come in his kingdom your private light is not yours anymore i'm not talking about your american privilege i'm talking about a people who releases and hands over the authority of right and wrong to the word of god case closed that's it he has the final say of what i do and i went to that couple and i read them several of these quotes and i said probably from the word of god he discourages a social drink you do what you want but if you're coming under god's word this is my answer for you later on praise the lord you still with me later on in the church god sent a family to us a dad and mom were broken up about ready to lose their marriage they were on the verge of divorce this happened many years ago and the man gave his heart back to god fully gave his heart back to god and in his giving his heart back to god because his problem was alcohol he said to god lord if you'll restore my marriage i'll never put another drop to my lips ever again and he made that commitment and god did it in his life god gave him his marriage back together god gave him his family and he's our sunday school superintendent him and his wife are sitting in the back brother mike and sister dawn right there that wasn't about just salvation that was about a man saying what's the king say and i'm making a commitment to what the word says got his family back because there's power in the word of the king [Applause] i think we ought to decide on some of this stuff who we are as christians and quit looking for loopholes all the time why do we keep looking for loopholes or what to wear and what to dress right someone that's looking for the loopholes and what's this under and can i wear this and i you know can i bring it up a little bit and i mean i i i'd like to take a service on modesty from a different perspective maybe from the word of god from a different perspective because i just asked a question why are we as christians always looking for loopholes all the time hashtag borderline believers [Laughter] i was asked a few years ago to do a wedding and they wanted to have dancing at the reception i said i said what it's difficult for me to understand after being under the influence of this word that's all my life today friends it's my testimony it's your testimony may be different i can show you in the bible where someone rebelled most of their life and many against the true word of god but guess what finally god got a hold of him and they came back under his headship so your testimony may be different you may be coming back even this morning to the lord and i thank god for that that you give me this time hour and a half to listen to me thank you so much god bless you for it i'm just asking to go home and ponder these things but i i was asked years ago will you do this and we're going to have we're dancing at the the daughter wants to dance with the dad i said you know it's just difficult and i thought i've been feeding on the message here now about for 10 years and the word of god and i just it was hard to bring that past the filter you know i didn't have dancing at my wedding it was out of the question it's another one of those things it's just the image of the world i want to do it the girl probably seen it on pinterest and no that's that's the gospel now it's pinterest it's the way to do it that's the way to decorate your home dance with dad and i wasn't against that part of it i think that was an affectionate thing but i had to stick with the word so here's the quote that i found that's what too many so christians do so-called christians do sharing your love with the world playing dancing gambling staying home from prayer meetings to watch television all kinds of worldly things that took the place of the love of god in the church's heart she's gone on a tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out there after other men she is sharing her love i got my answers and whether the person chooses or not i have a responsibility to share the word of god i went to some scriptures i went to the message they were coming to my church okay i said we we stand for the message of the last days here we believe what god has brought don't follow a man but we follow a word that brings us back to the original word don't let that lie coming we don't follow a man here only man we follow is the lord jesus christ the word the king what about shorts on men what about shorts on men thank you she was saying till we meet and just close the service now keep going might as well finish it out now all right josh [Music] so i read those things and so i made a decision i said okay you know i got some things he said here and he refers to sissies so i said you know what i don't think he's calling me a but i i'm not going to wear shorts in public and i'm not even we're going to wear very much in private in my home galley venting around i'm just going to stick close to that now this isn't just a heaven or hell issue i mean this isn't a thing to get into a big argument of the technical stuff and you find me a black and white scripture about that or you find i i don't want to get into all that it's just i i got the cue from the king and so you know i can make a choice i can make my own choice yeah you have an american right to make your own choice so when i when i go swimming somewhere and there's a swimming hole yeah i'm going to put on a pair of shorts i'm going to go swimming i don't want to wear my jeans you can do that if you want but i don't like to wear and my jeans get all heavy and stuff and so i might put on a pair of shorts to go swimming in a swimming hole somewhere or whatever but i don't make it a practice of just gallivanting around and i'll tell you why i have a right to do it um but i'm gonna read you what the prophet said about it next quote why is it that we make this is uh probably a woman asking this question brother branham why is it that we make so much of a big issue of women's dress and cutting of hair and nothing said about the hair of a man or the way he dresses it's a good question isn't it good question because he says a lot about things and he explains a little bit why there's more about the women than the men there's more in the bible about the woman's position the women's dress than there is for men well sister i'm going to agree with you one thing first place the bible said that a man should not have long hair and if he had long hair i'll tell him just the same as i tell you he's wrong but most men a lot of them like me don't have any at all but most men cut their hair look like men and now if they didn't do it they'd be told not to do so to leave their hair grow out like a woman's hair you'll get all of this in the marriage and divorce files and things that we preach on it now a man the first place a man's body is not a temptation like a woman so he's explaining why there's not as much in there for the man's dress as the woman's dress and salman and i were having a good conversation about today how that whole culture has changed today and there's a huge emphasis on how grooming the man and you know just doing going and spending 70 80 dollars and he's doing all this manicure and all this and i'm going there's something fishy going on there but culture has changed it now the man is emphasizing his body and his haircut what the way he's doing it and the tight pants and you know to the women now it increases sexual lust where you wouldn't normally lust after a man but now lust is lost and so now the man becomes a way that the woman actually lust after him culture's changed but you see now uh he says the first place a man's body is not a temptation like a woman now he's big old hairy legs knock kneed pot tummied he's a horrible looking mess and there's nothing about him for temptation guys just keep it that way okay prophet said that's what we look like and and i i'm described there perfectly with including the pot tummy and a lot of you are too so don't try to improve on what the prophet said you look like just leave it alone be rough be a man try to use some deodorant sometimes try to get your beard cleaned you know try to groom yourself a little bit and smell nice but don't be going like this world and dress yourself up like some woman and all that just be what the prophet said you are the horriblest looking mess he's ever seen i think he looks the gamiest looking sight for these see these men come down the road young and old with a pair of these bikinis on over what it was talking about short shorts and you know walking down the road i think that's the dirtiest looking sight i ever looked at now when you're reading this and there's a lot of quotes like this when you're reading this it's like if you look at it cardinal you're going to start applying that he just look what he just told me about me in my shorts i'm the dirtiest looking you're going to take it personal but listen i'm going to keep reading i think that's the dirtiest looking side ever say that's right i think he don't know what side of the race he belongs to that's right a man that do a thing like that and you know what i just heard a few months ago the american army is going to dress that way yep the army's gum coming out next year and next year after all in shorts how big of a bunch of see how big a bunch of sissies can we get in the 1960s they integrated shorts in the military short shorts in the military and or longer shorts or short shorts and they integrate it because uh england had already had them many years since 1910 1920. they already had it so they took that cue we're going to put that on our men and you know i don't know maybe it's easier to work in i don't know what reasons they did but all i'm interested is in the the the the view of a prophet he's looking at that and i want to say to you probably not a lot of those men he's seen in the pictures are sissies yet but it's not about what they are it's about what direction we're heading i said this a couple weeks ago and somebody reminded me and and i think it's something to look at when we look at the message it's not when he slams and hits something so hard you're gonna why is he hitting that so hard it's not that you already have the spirit but if you continue in certain things you'll take a spirit from that you continue to feed on certain television shows you'll take a spirit from that show she said he called me a i didn't read that and him and call me a i didn't i didn't read that and take that from it but i certainly could take that the king was speaking that the lord was giving me cues here from his commandment is that i don't really want to go there so i have no problem come under the headship of the word of god and so now uh let's just make a point here let me just finish this uh our army's coming out with it next year how big how big a bunch of sissies can we get god made a man to look like a man and act like a man and dress like a man he made a woman to do the same to dress like a woman act like a woman and be like a woman that's the way the king made it can you say a man and he is driving he says now we got the men wearing her underneath clothes which is his shorts and she's wearing his britches that's the world we live in it's mixing it up and god says a man ought to dress like a man and a woman ought to dress like a woman there ought to be a distinction and that does not include britches on a woman bridges are for the man and underneath garments like shorts are for the woman i wonder if brother brown was catching something that was coming maybe it wasn't sissy's back then but look today now just 20 years ago when they had to deal with the homosexual issue in the military and they said we'll make a rule don't ask don't tell you can be that but just keep it to yourself under obama we got rid of that so that they could come out i wonder if the prophet in calling it sissies maybe had a little vision now our military becomes full of them just 50 years later interesting maybe none of those men were sissies but now we have sissies in the military and whether they wear the shorts or not they've taken a homosexual feminine spirit and we got guys like that fighting in our army god have mercy we don't have real men like we should have real men fighting in our military i wonder if we've seen further he's warning us don't go there pull that picture up anybody know who this is this is two weeks ago i have to get up here to see your name i wonder if the prophet could see where things were going rachel levine the nation's most senior transgender official made history again tuesday by becoming the first openly transgender four star officer across any of the country's eight informed services levine the assistant secretary of health was sworn in tuesday this is two weeks ago as an admirable the highest ranking official of the u.s military public health service commission corps she's sworn in tuesday and i'm not going to even read what she said there you guys can take that picture down i'm not glorifying the world i'm trying to show you could it be that god sent a word from the king through the prophet this is where that's going and now you in 2021 can see it's not just homosexuals and sissies it's somebody who don't even know which one they are so they'll be both a commander elected the highest rank not just an not just one who joins military sergeant high commander i think that this something to consider i think it's a way to look at the message the right way and the word the right way about pornography i'll do one more and then we'll close i'm going to take a service someday when the lord gives me the green light i'm going to take a whole service on pornography and the reason it is the devil has so many people bound right and i'm not going to let it go it's out to destroy families lives men's minds young girls young guys seven eight nine years old are you reading the curriculums that's already being taught in the public schools does anybody know that the battle is increased now with all of a sudden parents during cohort looking at what they're teaching their kids and fighting against it and saying what is going on what are you teaching my kids thank god somebody looked at it you read some of the stuff that's already in there that some of the questions and perverted questions they're asking five-year-old kids i'll tell you friends what satan's eating we live in what a perversion to raise our children in but i want to talk about it but i would just say i had questions come up we had things come up this is a relevant issue so oh this is a quote that i found years ago and the word pornography is not mentioned in the message but maybe it was maybe it was mentioned in the message maybe just the term pornography isn't in it but maybe we have another word for it and brother branham has asked a question in this quote but if they marry let them marry for it's better to marry than to burn do you guys have that one it's better to marry than to burn so that's a scripture paul's talking about first corinthians 7 fornication we talked about that friday night in the youth meeting this week had a great conversation with the youth about it open conversation but paul says if they cannot contain let them go ahead and get married for it's better than to just burn in their lust for one another that's right just for just dirty living instead of a man or a boy or girl something or another when they're going together and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married i think you'd understand what i mean don't you know what he's talking about he's saying that they're going to go on and play around with each other and live dirty with one other before they're married they need to go ahead and get married the best case scenario is they both get filled with the holy spirit of god they get some convictions about them and they wait to do anything until their wedding day i'm here to tell you if you will honor god young people god will honor you and your marriage if you've made mistakes come to the blood of jesus come to the altar today and say god forgive me for what i've done and god will turn things around but listen i have the opportunity to speak to you young people this is what this word says it says for even uh instructional ministers say if you're gonna keep doing these things and keep burning in just a lust lust is not a good foundation for your marriage but if you're going to keep doing it you better go ahead and get married because it's better for you to be married than you just just to be living a dirty life you should just legally get married and that that's the basis of your marriage is sex go right ahead and see how that goes and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married i think you'd understand what i mean next one don't just live a dirty little life because it's not right you see that's your sister in one sense if you're a christian now it's if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that will be the mother of your children that will come don't live a dirty little life around her show you that show her that you're a real christian gentleman live like a christian gentleman all to see and treat her like your sister and when you get married still treat her that way can i hear an amen from the brothers and sisters that are married when you get married you don't want to be an absalom that just takes the girl hows her and the next day he hates her and runs away from her sometimes brothers do that when they get married they got her they he got the prize he fought for the prize and then he's not she's not her sweetheart anymore you don't have a marriage there can you say man you don't have something solid to build on after you're married treat her that way still like a sister in christ first i might answer this right now i don't believe oh could we talk about pornography here i don't believe in filthy living among pentecostal people holiness people brother brown preached amongst all the pentecostals watch what happens even if they're married i don't believe in that now sir some of this little dirty stuff that's so horrible i get in here sometimes in this not this morning now no i ain't saying it but i mean on these times i'm out here in california and different places like that i meet ministers out there where in the discernment on the discernment on the discernment i feel like i could turn them over my knee and give a little gospel protoplasmic stimulation stop right there there's a prophet he sees things by vision gets amongst the pentecostal ministers and sometimes god shows him the dirty things that are going on behind the scenes and what they're making their wives do nobody else would see it you're not going to see it in church when they're shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues but the prophetic eye sees what's going on at home and he's he's not going to call names here but he said i'd like to just bend you over and give you just a good spiritual spanking you shouldn't be doing that that's terrible you're living a hypocritical life brother if you're on pornography this morning you're living a hypocritical life if you're tapping on that on your computer on your phone i'm encouraging you as a minister to get a hold of the horns of the altar because that's gonna that thing will destroy as the bible says who can touch fire and not get burnt you're playing with fire and the thing about a fire is the fire when it's controlled is a wonderful thing we can have a bonfire we can have the fireplace in our home but an uncontrolled fire will destroy your entire house sex is like a fire can you say amen if it's controlled and put in marriage in the right thing and pure praise the lord for it god endorses it once it comes outside of that it becomes a fire that'll destroy your marriage destroy your life listen to me as a minister come to the horns of the altar and say god sanctify me from this pornography i'd like to turn them over and give a gospel protoplasm stimulation yes my to see a man that would try to take his little wife and dirty and filthy that's you understand what i mean i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself as a man of god you just be a husband you be a sweetheart respect her like you always respect her don't pay any attention to these some of these sexy books or these nonsense in these sexy books and things that you read about did the prophet talk about pornography yes and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind the bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you when you profess holiness it goes on to say treat that little lady like she's a little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you'd be just the same you'd be that gallant boyfriend remember you are you don't try none of these new things did anybody hear what he said i was a young man and i'm seeing these things i'm saying don't try some of these new things you don't need any more than just that sentence if you knew that was coming from the king that's the king's royal commandment don't even try some of these new things that's 1963 what about today don't try none of these new things and i know what i'm talking you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine christian i know that sounds but see you're my kids i got a right to say what i want to you to you you see you're my kids you live right and the women live right the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to your wives anybody who's struggling in their marriage today i would go before the lord together and before the lord alone but together as well and i would you have a real honest conversation and i would lay it all on the table this morning because if you keep it hidden the devil's going to destroy your marriage if not this morning sometimes it's it's going to break you up some it might be on the radio breaking up but i'd have a real i'd come to the altar and ask for prayer and say god deal with this thing now so you can restore my marriage restore my family i'm serious this is serious you don't know who's it's the enemy it's not your wife it's not your husband it's the enemy trying to destroy it be real about it be grown up about it say god deal with this thing be real nice and respect one another and your family relations with she's talking sex there your family relations and so forth like that let it just be as reverently and godly and agreed with among you and everything i'm a young man and i'm saying boy that's specific that's a specific word about this stuff don't ever push and shove and be dirty and vulgar understand talk to your wife if nature is to you and another nature to her which is the case most of the time in a man and a woman and two different personalities she has a different nature than you brother hello wake up and smell the coffee [Music] she has a different nature than you god's made her different than you and she has a different personality to you talk to her understand one another try to do the same thing to him sister the way same way understand one another be real christian gentlemen real
