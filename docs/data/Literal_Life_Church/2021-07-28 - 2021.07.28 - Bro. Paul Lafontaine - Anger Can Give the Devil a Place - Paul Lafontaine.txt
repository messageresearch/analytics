========================================

god bless you folks being with us tonight good thing you come to fill some seats because we have so many going in look at this good to have you praise the lord amen it only takes two or three that's what i hear from the word only takes two or three so we got enough that the lord can show up we got the right numbers amen praise the lord good to have you all tonight praise the lord we're in a good place in the right place at the right time i believe that amen i wanted to talk a little bit tonight about anger and also just the victory that goes for the christian and we were on that a little bit on sunday and talk about jonah and we appreciate some of the response that we get back and uh looking at the life of jonah but tonight i just wanted to just take take anger in the book of ephesians and also just a few things about it that can teach us and some other some of this is revisiting um a few foundational things that we spoke here before we'll just spring off of that i think it was four or five years ago i dealt with the subject at length and uh so i just wanted to get back into it a little bit tonight and then we'll have just a few other things examples in the scriptures i believe that will be a blessing to us and helpful with us and understanding these things and if you're not struggling in this area uh that you've got maybe years ago you've got your anger resolved and under control and the holy spirit's guiding you in such a powerful way i say praise the lord because that's the goal for all of us is to bring our this emotion that's so much a part of us under the lord's control and under his his holy spirit guidance and leadership and how many knows a lot of things in life to make us angry i mean there's many people that can make us angry amen even our own children sometimes can make us angry and there's a lot of potential for anger in this in the world we live in uh you can if you if you stay on the news about 15 minutes it has the potential to make you pretty angry if you have any discernment at all about the word of god and the kingdom of god and you see where we're going almost on a daily basis my personal choices and my personal rights are being taken away from me on a daily basis uh it's happening on a daily basis and we'll no longer have it's interesting about some parties in politics that have pushed to us the woman's choice for years the woman's choice and her right to her own body and then turn around and and i don't have a right or a choice of a thing in my own body what to do what to not to do so that's kind of like a contradiction but that's the world we live in and if you look at the news very long you're going to be upset but i got something for you to look at tonight the word of god i believe that can help us and to just live in a different way uh as we look at the scripture here just in some teaching we see that paul deals with the subject of anger in our inheritance chapter of ephesians and he says to be a be ye angry and sin not let not the sun don't go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so i'm going to isolate the two scriptures just a little bit and look at that as though there's two two real dangers that we watch for of where our anger can take us or our anger can go the wrong way and anger can take us to wrong places the release of anger in the wrong way can make things very unchrist-like can grieve the spirit can grieve other people can grieve our spirit and actually can be the dismantling of families and churches and everything it's kind of like a fire it just kind of begins to burn up everything uncontrolled anger unresolved anger can begin to destroy good things that you have so we have to look at and realize there's a couple dangers here because anger has a great danger matter of fact anger is one letter short of the word danger so you always have the potential anger has the potential to do a couple damaging things to to believers if they're not careful and because of that we must face it and we must expose it and we must bring it to the lord and we must resolve it and we must bring it to his throne and say lord whatever it is that has begun to eat at me or make me upset in my emotions i want to deal with that and i think that we should resolve it as quickly as we can and what i want to present to you tonight in a teaching is that the reason that we want to resolve it as quickly as we can because anger is the type of thing that has a potential that grows it will grow inside of you it will grow like a cancer grows inside of you anger can grow like a cancer anger can grow in your spirit and take over your spirit sometimes affect you physically and so it's not the type of thing just to leave unresolved it's the type of thing to bring to the cross and say lord help me to release this help me as i as we sang the song tonight to leave it there help me to release it and leave it there because if i hold on to it it has the potential to grow in me like a cancer and when it begins to grow as a cancer then it has a lot of other things that go to it and there's a couple things that he says here he says some instruction don't let another day uh go on to carry on with it in other words before the sun goes down in other words to resolve it don't let the sun go down upon your wrath and upon your anger so that's one thing is that there's a as a danger that we let it go on to another day don't let it go on to another day bring it to the lord do everything you can to just release things even at the end of the day sometimes we don't do that but the bible is instructing us is that this is something that has to be resolved and brought to the lord and if you can do it before the sun goes down the better so that's number one don't let another day carry on with it and the second thing don't give the devil an open place to work and that's what i want to title this tonight anger can give the devil a place and that's why it's so dangerous to us spiritually because anger has the potential to give satan ground to give satan a place to give him somewhere that he can begin to work and as christians in our inheritance we're not up to giving the devil any of our ground this is an inheritance can you say man this is ours our souls belong to him our spirit belongs to him and the possession of inco that we have in jesus christ it belongs to us it doesn't belong to the devil and so when the devil comes and squats on something and jumps in and takes a place in our land then we quickly rise up and say no that's not your land that's my land amen and so what a powerful statement don't give a place to the devil why would he say that in the book of ephesians because the book of ephesians is our inheritance chapter it's our joshua chapter the book of ephesians is our inheritance as a christian and so our inheritance belongs to us neither give place to the devil no don't give them any room at all don't give them any place at all there's not one corner of our land that we're going to give up to the enemy it doesn't belong to him it belongs to us it's interesting that he brings our land in not giving a place of our land to the devil in the subject of anger see i always love to look at that because in the message many times we get really highfalutin and it's the it's all the mysteries and everything and then paul here's talking about your anger and he says you better resolve your anger and the next scripture he says don't give a place to the devil it's related to our inheritance because every day the enemy challenges us with becoming angry and not resolving our anger and i'm telling you if you don't bring it to the lord and relieve it the devil has a place to get in the devil is out to take some of your property the devil's out to take some of your land that belongs to you can you say amen and so now we we get we look at a victory in this for a believer these are two great victories for a believer i believe is to resolve it before the day is over and that also that nothing bad should be allowed to continue very long in our spirit and i'll just go quickly through this because i've taught on these things before i'm just picking it up again it bears repeating especially after uh quite a few years so these are just repeating some things but nothing should get in our let me just say it this way nothing should be allowed to get lodged in your spirit or your motion so deeply nothing should be allowed to get lodged there very deeply for too long nothing of the enemy nothing that bothers you nothing that makes you angry should be allowed to get too lodged in your spirit now the reality of it is you're going to get angry it's an emotion the reality of is there's going to be things that make you angry the reality is is that you're not a sinner because you get angry that would be denying you as a human being he's not talking about uh not having any anger and if you have anger you're not a christian you don't have the holy ghost he said be angry but sin not amen right it's like when you talk about money it's not money that's wrong it's the love of money you see so you have to balance those things but anger it's a it's it's a part of our emotions sometimes matter of fact you can be angry at the at the right things you can have the anger of god towards the wrong things and keep the devil at bay because you get angry at sin you get angry at things in your life that you want to see out uh you you got to keep if you want something done you have to keep hating it you have to keep hating something and wanting deliverance over it can you say amen uh i've mentioned before some of the people that go through uh financial counseling and want to dig out of their hole the counselor has asked the questions over and over and every session how mad are you at this debt how upset are you how mad are you because if you don't say stay mad at it you won't resolve it you'll loosen up about it so there's certain things to remain mad at to get out of your life that's wrong so anger is a part of us but when it gets lodged in our spirit it can't do that because anger must be short-lived and we can't continue to think about things that make us angry we can't continue to dwell on things that make us angry god help us to listen tonight we can't continue to uh dwell on things that make us angry we our anger must be very short-lived let not the sun go down on it we must move on we must release it we must quickly through prayer and forgiveness say this is over it's done i want to leave this alone i want to leave it at the cross because if something is lodged in our spirit we it may be there for too long we want it to be finished we want it to be healed we want it to be over with and then go to the next day and say lord what is it today that i need to overcome but we don't want an accumulation of all kinds of things building up in cancer to make us angry and resentful we want to see it resolve through healing because the next day sufficient unto today is the evil thereof jesus said sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof in other words every day we're going to go through things that would make us angry we don't need an accumulation of years of anger built up we need to say god forgive me and god help me to forgive others let me leave that at the cross blessed be his name that's what the scripture is encouraging us to do and thankfully we can do it through the blood of jesus christ and through his grace so we must make take more time and make sure things are cleaned out and and and cleansed out don't let anything that's wrong stay in your spirit too long get back up quickly and and every day consider a new day with the lord his mercies are new every morning and every day is a new day with my lord when he says don't let the sun go down upon your wrath and start every he's saying every day should be a new day with my lord could it be possible that the lord allows us through his blood and through the cross to end every day and take all the victories and all the battles and take all the things and mistakes that we've done wrong and take all the things that made us angry and at the end of the day to say lord i give it all to you i turn it over to you it's in the past it's done forgive me for what i've done wrong and lord let me forgive those who've done me wrong and lo could it be that the lord lets us get a fresh start every morning could it be that what david said his mercies are new every morning could it be that he gives us permission to forget those things which are behind and press toward the mark of the high calling in christ could it be the lord allows us you bring it up and you remember it and the devil brings it up but could it be he says you don't have to bring it up if it's underneath the blood yesterday was yesterday today is today and you got a fresh start with the lord hallelujah i tell your friends i'm going to preach tonight whether you say amen or not the lord's mercies are new every morning and we have the opportunity to get a fresh start but but that person's never made things right the situation hasn't changed yet but you you can say lord i have a fresh morning with you i have a fresh start with you today what i've done is under the blood forgive me lord let me never do it again what they do is between them and god but i want to go on with you i want to serve you with all of my heart today oh what a god we serve friends what a mighty god we serve so the reason that we do it and resolve it is because anger can grow like a cancer inside of us the bible speaks of bitterness the same way did you know the bitterness is the same way bitterness and anger are of course similar in hebrews 12 it says follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord follow peace with all men another place in the bible says follow peace with all men as much as possible because sometimes it's not possible but as much as possible live peaceable with all men and verse 15 says looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and therefore many others be defiled so the same way anger can grow resentment can grow and he calls it something can start up if you fail of the grace of god and you're not living by his grace and you're not having grace for others hint if you're not having grace and living in the grace of god guess what can happen a root of bitterness now that's an interesting way he words it but we're talking about a plant we're talking about something that grows inside of you weeds weeds i hate weeds it's the middle of summer every day we're pulling weeds they come i don't know where they come from and they thrive in this heat my plants don't thrive in this heat i have to water them but when i water them i water the weeds and then they thrive in the heat and they're there and i'm pulling them constantly if i want a healthy yard if i want a healthy flower garden i'm always pulling the roots and you got to get it by the roots is anybody relating tonight a little bit got some weeds yeah you can't just grab the time i'm trying to train one of my neighbor boys to take care of my yard my rental property and i keep training them you know hopefully he's not listening tonight but bless his heart you know you can't grab the top of that weed and clip the top of it off it's gonna be there next week and grow taller i try to teach you get down there and get your fingers down in the dirt and you grab that thing and you pull it up by the roots the bible's speaking here of bitterness and anger a root of bitterness springing up because we don't live by the grace of god we must live by his grace we must have grace for others we must live in his grace we must accept god's forgiveness we must live if we make a mistake bring it under his blood we must live in the grace of god we don't live by works we don't live being critical all the time of other people we that's not living in the grace of god has anybody ever heard preaching like this before living in the grace of god is living in the grace of god and that means we live in god's grace because we can do no other and we have grace for others god let me forgive that person that's living in his grace god don't let me hold a grudge against a person that's living in his grace if you don't do that a root of bitterness springs up and roots become plants weeds plants become big things they grow and grow and grow the bible is talking about bitterness and being a root of bitterness springing up and notice what it does it troubles you and and makes others defiled that's hebrews 12 14 and 15 you want to read it it's powerful it troubles you thereby springing up trouble you and thereby many others be defiled so why do we need to resolve anger and bitterness why do we need to quickly get it resolved because it'll start affecting your spirit and it'll start affecting other people so christians just can't let it go on we can't let it keep growing we can't let a 20 year old grudge keep eating at us brother jason we can't we can't let these things go on and on for years we've got to say lord take these things i release these things i'm finished with these things i want to live in the victory as a christian and so i think that's uh proof enough to show us that it can trouble us it's a root it's something that grows anger frustration irritation is a part of our flesh and part of our life experience even as a christian we're never going to get to the place we're not around something that would make us angry around situations that make us angry but when it comes there it's not that you sin because it come that it comes you haven't sinned because you're frustrated you haven't sinned because you become irritated at something is anybody glad to hear that tonight amen i'm glad because i get irritated at stuff you haven't sinned because you become irritated you're a human being you have human emotions but right at that point the christian says now wait a minute give no place to the devil this is not going to be allowed to go any further and a lot of times when it goes further it it jumps in our mind we're frustrated but then then we just start bringing the whole scenario into the production room of our imagination i always say the imagination realm is like the the movie production room you know a lot of christians don't go to movies but they have tons of movies in their head all the time they direct it they produce it and they sit in their theater and they watch it all day never go to a movie in a message church at all the conventions but if your imagination is not under control the holy spirit you could be looking at stuff that's just as bad in the movie theater oh i'm not going to get too many amens on that but i'm preaching the truth anyhow your imagination is a powerful station to be able to produce all kinds of bad movies in your head you sit there in the movie theater of your imagination and you sit there some of you young people some of you people in the privacy of your own you think your privacy and you think nobody knows what you're thinking and you go through all these scenarios whether lustful or whatever it is i'm telling you that's when a christian needs to bring his imagination his conscience its affection and reasonings under the lord and say no i'm not allowed to do that this body belongs to god amen amen amen amen so now uh we might get irritated but we haven't sinned because we've done that the sin is when it stays inside and is allowed to take root and is allowed to grow and when it does then the devil takes your land he squats on some land he takes a place he takes a corner it might be more than a quarter you give up land when you let anger fester you give up land when you let anger fester and but when you don't and when you turn to the lord and when you say lord i want to release this to you cast my cares on you maybe you remind the lord of his promise and he says cast all your cares upon me you know what cares are worries you think the why did the lord say that he he gave us a place to cast our worries on him oh i don't want to bother the lord with all my words kind of like people with a pastor sometimes he's too busy i don't want to bother him but listen that's what i'm here for is to pray with you about your about your you want to get victory in your life that's what i'm here for but we do that with the lord oh he's he's to all my worries he's too busy for and yet he said cast all your cares upon me for i care for you become a place in prayer take your burdens to the lord and not only says pray leave them there lord i'm going to leave this with you i don't know how to resolve this so i'm going to leave it with you and let me know what you want me to do man that's like the ultimate uh psychologist you know no psychologist says you know what i'll take care of all this you leave it all here and i'll deal with it nobody says that and the lord says cast it on me leave it there for i care for you let me handle it let me take care of it ain't no lawyer that says that no psychologists doctors no they give you medicine deal with it with the medicine but our lord says why don't you just leave that here but you come to the altar i want you to leave that here and i'll get back with you i'll take care of it amen [Applause] amen praise the lord can i get an amen amen praise the lord my little granddaughter was here i'd if i'm hurting for amends i know she'd give me one right now amen she'd say little eleanor but you know what you knew why we say it because victory comes in our lives believers are about victory can you say amen and we have victory when the devil has no place to get in give no place to the devil living that way is the believer's victory now hold open your bibles and i'm going to read the same scriptures through ephesians 4. starting at verse 26 i'm going to read it in the amplified version and you listen how he words it i'm going to read all the way through to the 32nd verse because i think it's all tied together it says be angry yet do not sin verse 26 do not let your anger cause you shame nor allow it to last don't let your anger last until the sun goes down and do not give the devil an opportunity to lead you into sin by holding a grudge by nurturing anger or how by harboring resentment or by cultivating bitterness there's about four sermons right there don't give the devil an opportunity to lead you into sin by number one holding a grudge that's when the devil gets ground nurturing anger harboring resentment or cultivating bitterness that is where the devil takes his ground your anger is one thing but now the devil has a place to work when it becomes resentment when it becomes this and so then he goes on to say in verse 29 do not let unwholesome foul profane worthless vulgar words ever come out of your mouth which it's interesting sometimes that happens when we become angry it's what comes out of our mouth sometimes that hurts other people offends the holy spirit amen see you thought you were coming to get a nice flowery sermon tonight on wednesday night and i'm i'm right down where we all are where the rubber meets the road if he's if he's saying don't let unwholesome words come out of your mouth and he's tying it to anger that means our anger can let some pretty unwholesome words come out of our mouth words come out and they spill out don't let that happen but only such speech as is good for building up others according to the need and the occasion so that it will be a blessing to those who hear you speak and do not grieve the holy spirit of god interesting that he's put in this scripture about grieving his spirit whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption in the subject of anger in the subject of what we say the potential is there to grieve his spirit that's right with our anger and uncontrolled anger and our unresolved anger the potential is theirs do not potential is there is the grievous spirit so he says uh do not grieve the holy spirit by whom you were sealed and marked for the day of redemption the final deliverance from our consequences of sin verse 31 so then let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and that means perpetual resentment strife fault-finding let and slander let all of that be put away from you god help me as a christian god help us as christians let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and strife and fault-finding and slander let it just be put away from us along with every kind of malice and verbal abuse and male violence and spitefulness verse 32 be kind and helpful to one another be tenderhearted compassionate understanding forgiving one another why does he bring them the word forgiveness because that's the key to resolving anger he has to mention forgiveness because and i'm not talking about mechanical i'm sorry like we get from our kids sometimes i'm talking about the forgiveness that flows from calvary and flows into your heart and flows out and genuine i forgive you he was at calvary when he said those words forgive them father for they know not what they do so true forgiveness flows from calvary to our souls and that's when we can say i forgive that person the understanding forgiving one another readily and freely doing it just as god in christ also forgave you forgiveness and prayer is the antidote for anger when you stand praying jesus said forgive if you have faith you could have faith to remove mountains and then the next scripture he says when you stand praying forgive brother braham says faith is based on forgiveness based on what jesus said faith is based on forgiveness you can never take forgiveness away from releasing more of your faith how many want more faith tonight you can never have an unforgiving spirit and have more faith you can't do it you will not proceed into greater revelations and faith if you have an unforgiving spirit it's impossible the one word he says when he says if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea a couple scriptures later and when you stand praying forgive faith is based upon forgiveness forgiveness is the release of your spirit of everything in the way of faith forgiveness is the release of your spirit of everything that's in the way of faith don't talk about faith with unresolved anger in your heart don't tell me all your great revelations of the message if you have no forgiveness don't talk to me about all your revelations of the message and all your faith in for healing or anything else if you have an unresolved anger in your heart jesus said it doesn't work that way don't tell me all your great relations revelation if you don't have forgiveness and you're holding long grudges for many many years your faith is hindered hindered and you can't grow in faith with an unforgiving spirit now let me just change this up and and start wrapping things up a little bit a few uh you know i don't want to be too long tonight but are you learning something have we learned something and there's a bible study here this wednesday night i feel like really preaching though i'm really enjoying this subject but um i want to wrap it up because i know i don't want to be too long on this wednesday night and plus i forgot to bring my water and so i'll start getting thirsty pretty soon i think i left it in the office there's a few men in the bible of course there's quite a few men that come into some anger i'm only going to talk about three of them tonight and then sunday we'll continue with jonah but there's a few of them in the bible and i want you to see what it was that triggered their anger and then i want you to see what they did with it and the results that come from it their anger and how the enemy got in because that's what i'm speaking about tonight is that give no place to the devil anger can give a place to the devil and so uh here we have men in the bible men that we have respect for men of god and here their anger was triggered by something i want you to see what it was triggered by because it can happen with us as well sometimes and then what they did in their anger what was the results of their in other words what did they do when it was triggered what was their response and how did they how did they you know act with their anger and then how the enemy got into that of course and caused something that wasn't right uzziah is an example of someone who got angry and it wasn't at first isaiah watched his eyes life he was a godly king he wasn't a priest he wasn't a prophet isaiah was a prophet uzziah was a god a godly man he served the lord faithfully and god blessed his kingdom uzziah's kingdom was blessed because he was a good man and isaiah watched him since a boy that he was agreeing you could find this in the message of brother branham if you want to listen to it in the message called influence i believe that he preached that sermon more than any other sermon the message of influence and he read about uzziah and isaiah and uzziah in in second chronicles 26 thank you very much you want me to preach longer henry uzziah in second chronicles 26 if you want to write down where it's at in your bible scene study it later it's in second chronicles 26 after a while he got lifted up in pride and thought he was real some real somebody and isaiah also watched this and he got so lifted up in pride that he he stepped out of his place he walked into the temple he walked straight through the priests he walked straight through everyone and he was going to go back and begin to do the service of a priest i'll go get my answer myself and all this was violating all the rules because only the priests were supposed to serve in the temple and do these things the urim of thumb the the coal fire all these other things that they did in there was not didn't belong to a king to handle that god set the priest to do it so in his pride he says he stepped out of order he stepped out of his position and uh many there's a bunch of the priests that tried to stop him from doing it because they knew the order and uh they respected the king but he was getting out of out of his place so as he walked in and began to head towards doing that he was warned they ran after him don't do this this is for the priest to do god said that and so they they tried to correct the king and this is where his anger rose up is that when he got corrected by the priest this is when his anger was triggered and his pride said i don't need to be corrected especially by these priests because his pride had told him over time i can do anything i want i can do ever whatever i want to i'm the king and his pride had grown so much that he was instantly angry at anyone who corrected him now pride can grow as well in a person's life and i find pride is associated and can be linked with anger anger can be building up inside somebody because they build up their pride and so they get themselves on edge that they're carrying their feelings on their shoulders but their pride says i can do whatever i want nobody tells me what to do nobody corrects me at times we find young people become this way and it's just their pride nobody's going to tell me what to do not my parents not anybody not any preacher pride does that and they beca they lose their humility and so now at all of this that was inside of yazay that had been growing it wasn't just pride but his anger was growing at a moment he got into a quick rage at someone who disagreed with him or didn't want didn't let him do what he wanted to do and i personally believe that yazai's anger was already festering inside of his pride it just was triggered by a priest trying to correct him you need to ask yourself the question tonight how do i respond to correction brother michael taught a little couple services on it that was excellent how do we respond and taking correction especially from the holy spirit from the word from his vessels we we need to brother branham commented on this and he says we need to know that we're able to take correction we need to be able to take correction isaiah couldn't take correction and he got anger his angry anger was triggered because he got mad because he couldn't take correction from the priest examine your life and see if this is the source of your anger and source that makes you angry is when the word corrects because i'll tell you the word always corrects the air in our lives the holy spirit has a nature to him it's a gentle nature it's not belligerent it's not a bully but don't ever forget the holy spirit when he's around if there's something to correct he wants to correct it we'll let it go we'll leave it alone a lot of churches will leave it alone but when the holy spirit is present he will be looking for the air in our lives when everybody else is patting us on the back the holy spirit was saying but i can't leave that alone i'm going to be a gentleman and correct what's wrong the word always corrects the air so uzziah got angry because the word was correcting him the priest was correcting him so then the results was he was instantly struck with leprosy how many know what leprosy is leprosy represents sin so his pride made him angry at correction in his anger brought leprosy and when leprosy came the devil took over and took his place in his life he lost everything he lost the kingdom and he died of leprosy and had to go to a leper colony why it all started with pride and anger unresolved anger and it brought leprosy in his life elijah is another man that i'll quickly go to what triggered anger one day with elisha what triggered anger with elijah elisha and i'm speaking about the incident where he turns to some kids and he curses them and the she-bear comes out and kills them brother brahm said that wasn't right he shouldn't have done that and he did it in his anger and but what triggered it is interesting because they were making fun of him because of his bald head right it's true he got angry because kids were making fun of his bald head and calling him baldy they would probably wrote a song about it and they were probably singing it baldy oh baldy elisha and brother brown referred to his parents their parents talking around the kitchen table their disrespect to the prophet and it passed down to the kids and so when they got from he hadn't they had no respect for the prophet of god so the parents were responsible too he said that the shebears killed those children and really the responsibility went back to the parents and their disrespect for the prophet of god talking about things they shouldn't have in front of the children but it was to elijah now why would he get so angry well probably the disrespect but it might have been linked to a complex about him be involved so my lesson to you is that sometimes our anger is triggered by somebody who takes in a personal attack to us a personal attack to our character a personal attack and we really don't like it when they've falsely accused us how many can get angry when somebody falsely accuses you yes something personal is something personal somebody does something to our children that's personal and it can trigger anger within us we're going to defend our kids because we quickly act upon something because it's a personal thing and so i'm not saying that's not real and don't happen but i say that elisha was wrong to respond in anger the way that he did because it was a personal attack at him so i'm asking the question is there sometimes that our anger gets uncontrolled and gets out of hand and the devil gets a place with our anger because somebody has attacked us personally it's a personal attack and where do we need to be growing to say lord um well first of all lord you were personally attacked you were persecuted you were slain you were made fun of you were mocked so how am i going to get through this with christ without getting some mocking going on um so uh is our anger triggered by something personal someone teasing us or something like that we may feel it but what do we do with it we may feel the anger coming up but what we what do we do with it and to act as he did and i i think in in anger in growing in him the kids that day mess with a very sensitive area which kids are well at doing and he cursed them and he called she bear out to kill them let me just end this and say ministers and all saints of god we must constantly bring our personal complexes to the lord and die to them if we can because personal complexes and when somebody gets them can trigger anger in our lives and we start defending ourselves and responding and we need to bring our complexes i tell ministers this you can preach and get behind the pulpit but i like to see a life growing in the word not just what he can preach over the pulpit but he's dying to his complexes he's bringing him to the throne he's got his family in order and he's striving to get closer to the lord it's not just what you preach here are you dying to your complexes and the reason i say that to ministers because i've watched older ministers and if they can minister 30 40 50 years have a great following if they don't die to their complexes early on in their ministry it'll spill over in their ministry eventually and affect the sheep i know that's being honest but i've watched it so much i'm always saying to the lord help me to die to my complexes help me not to make that prevalent thing because it can be an attack to us if we don't die to those things and all of a sudden we start attacking people back across the pulpit and that's not going to help the sheep at all right so uh a minister if he goes many many years he'll start abusing his authority and all it is behind the scenes is he's got huge complexes that he'd never died to and now he's defending himself and using the authority of the word to do it ministers but all people that are people of god should bring your complexes to the lord and say lord help me to die to those things or at least help me to bring them under the control of the holy spirit the last one i want to talk about tonight is moses i'd like you to turn the book of numbers and we'll read this one before we go this evening can you can you give me one more character moses a prophet of god and this is an interesting section of scripture that really became really real to me today as we looked at it again numbers chapter 20 and we'll start here at verse 2. and there numbers 20 and verse 2 and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we in our cattle should die there and where you know it's interesting the children of israel when they were in egypt they were crying to god to deliver them and god did deliver them and they have so forgot that they're actually blaming the prophet for bringing them out of egypt and they're the ones that cried to god to come out of it but immaturity and wherefore have you made us to come up out of egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place of a seed or figs or vines or pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them and the lord spake unto moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak he unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beast drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beast also anybody notice what went wrong he disobeyed god he said to speak to the rock not to smite the rock so now you've got to look at moses and say what is it that's festering in him to make him smite the rock twice instead of obey god and speak to the rock it was anger and it was anger that had festered for quite a while towards god's people and finished the story real quickly and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because she believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i've given them pretty serious they're not going to get to go into the land this is the water of maraba because the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them so let me make a few points before we close tonight can you give me 10 more minutes so this is an amazing scripture it reveals so much i can preach another sermon just on this it's amazing scripture because it shows us a man a prophet of god getting to the place to step out of his place because of one thing and that's because his anger that had grown over time against god's own people and their ways and their complaining and their immaturities a man of god a prophet gets frustrated and eventually anger and that he didn't resolve the anger it was growing inside of him and his anger was towards god's people and their ways and their complaining and their immaturities it got to them it started to really eat at him and those who are bible studiers know that back in exodus when they were coming across the land they ran out of water they needed water to live by and god instructs moses to strike the rock right so the first time they needed water he instructs moses to strike the rock he struck the rock one time struck at one time how many know that the rock is a type of christ how many know the waters of life come out of christ how many know that he was smitten one time at calvary how many know when he was spitting at calvary the water of life flowed to your life but he was only to be smitten one time he doesn't have to go to calvary again you don't have to go to calvary again it doesn't need to be smitten again he was spitting one time and that provided the water of life for the people of god so moses in doing that brother braham says is breaking every type of the bible he's breaking all these types and shadows he goes into the very permissive will of god by doing this because the shadow and the type is you don't have to smite that rock twice the next time you just speak to the rock and the water will come hallelujah oh i can preach another sermon tonight he doesn't have to go to calvary again we don't have to smite anything again we just speak the word can you say amen and the waters flow freely tonight right to our lives hallelujah his waters are still flowing from calvary tonight for your need if you're thirsty and hungry for god the waters are still flowing tonight blessed be his name so so what happened in exodus was it was a need of the people all right they got thirsty it was the need of the people people will always have needs you're going to have family members that always have needs you have needs family members pulling on you that have needs okay but pastoring a congregation until we get out of here people are always going to be needy and have needs and often the needs bring symptoms of complaining and immaturities this is the children of israel but it's us too it's congregations today so you have a need i'm craving i'm missing something in my life i'm missing and a lot of times when people are missing and craving something a lot of times they need the word of god they need refreshing of the holy spirit they need and so but they don't know what they need and so they're just complaining and they're acting immature and they're gossiping and they're backbiting and they're all the symptoms come out and guess what you can get mad at the symptoms but the symptoms come from a need how many has ever been in a conversation because i have i don't know if you have but you're you know you say something i can't believe that person's doing that i can't believe they did that to me they did that other person and so you're going on and on and then somebody says this statement you're going to say i can't believe they'd even do that and somebody says but isn't that a cry for help and you go shut up i wasn't thinking about that but they speak truth all these symptoms of people acting crazy and immature and doing all these stupid things isn't that a cry for help in a lot of cases it is so now we will judge people and we will speak and we will get angry and frustrated as moses did with the people of god i shouldn't be walking around tonight because we have very limited video people to follow me around here i get used to it we tend to judge people by the symptoms and the complaining and the immaturities and fail to get to the need god always wants to know what they need is matter of fact the song says he looked beyond my faults and saw my need praise the lord brothers and sisters shouldn't we be that way how about we look beyond people's faults like god does to us and see their cry for help and see their need the symptoms of something no matter how bad a person gets it started with some need that was being unmet by christ or by some other means but mostly it's because they needed the lord they needed calvary so now all this ugliness comes out in a person and it's a cry for help we focus on the way they're acting we become angry with the way they're acting yet god looks beyond our faults and sees our need moses over time he grew angry and so him smiting the rock twice came from some growing cancer of anger inside of his spirit he got tired of the complaining of the people and the the immaturities of the people moses was told this time to speak and not strike why christ did not need to be smote again only speak it out but his anger made him smite it twice and he broke all the types of christ putting him in the permissive will of god your anger will have you even use the word on your family when our anger you holding tight here a minute are you listening your anger will sometimes even have you using the word on your family and even to a church a pastor to a church and put you right in the permissive will of god because the word is right but your anger is wrong moses was right to go to the rock but his motive for going to the rock and smiting it twice his motive was wrong preachers can preach the complete truth of this message out of anger and it's not blessed preachers can preach but preach with the wrong motive let's not preach just the preachers tonight let's talk about all of us right and a church will be come into the person miss the will of god because the pastor is using the word but his anger has grown so much and he's frustrated with the frustrate for with the immaturity of the people and he's just he's going to strike it he's going to strike it he's going to strike out and he strikes out in his anger and you know what happens the water comes out anyway because god will not deny his people if somebody has a need the water comes out the water came out of the rock for israel anyway but like brother brahm says the water's flowing out the children israel rejoicing and they're over there oh we got water praise the lord god provided the need and then he says moses aaron come over here a minute not in front of everybody he brought tomorrow says moses and aaron right there you glorified yourself and not me so you see the promised land over there you don't get to go wow now interestingly enough i'm closing i know 10 minutes i know i got it i got the clock up there two chapters before that you read your bible tonight god calls the children of israel rebels so moses in his anger he said well god called them rebels so now i'm going to call them rebels and so he was so burnt up at these people complaining he had dealt with it for years and even sometimes when god would get angry see god's anger is different than our anger he has anger and god wouldn't get angry and he says i'm trying to swipe the whole thing off they're all finished and moses steps in like christ said lord don't do that this is your people that was christ and moses but god's two chapters are there calls them rebels this is how you deal with the rebels and moses just thought you know what i am so sick of these people okay lord you told me to go speak to the rock he takes that thing over and strikes that rock ye rebels you always need stuff didn't come out sick of all you people and the water comes out but god says come over here you just glorified yourself that's what men will do if they don't resolve their anger and preach their anger they eventually glorify themselves and god will not share his glory with anybody no preacher no popular preacher nobody not even you he's not going to share it with anybody we're in the service of the lord to obey what he said to do and to do it the way that he said to do it and i wish i had five more minutes but let me just say this striking out with the word to deal with rebellion instead of letting the water flow from the word to meet the needs i think we could we should speak the word today we don't have to strike anything my question to you is are you smiting or are you speaking are you smiting or are you speaking or you are your words your words are smiting but they're not really speaking anything they're smiting words important i got a last note here that says this word and to get the results of it only needs to be spoken like moses was told speak to the rod it's already been smitten just speak to the rock it only needs to be spoken to to meet the needs of the people but it needs to be spoken with the holy ghost and love behind it not anger when anger is behind it it might be the very word and it might break the water to the people but it's not the right motive that we should speak the word but when his word is spoken with the holy ghost behind it and with love behind it that's when we're getting somewhere in maturity and our anger is is put is washed away our anger is brought to the cross on a daily basis and when it's brought to the cross on a daily basis then it gives no place to the devil to get in speak to the rock moses i've already smitten it it's already there calvary's already provided just speak the word in love speak the word with the right attitude and that's the way i want to see it presented we never accomplish anything for his kingdom when we have unresolved anger in our hearts but when our spirit is free and we're motivated by love god can really further his kingdom in a mighty way everybody say amen praise the lord leave it there you got to leave it there let's stand together take your burdens to the lord oh and leave it there if you trust and never doubt he will surely bring you out take your burden to the lord leave it there [Music] leave it there maybe tonight you got to leave it there leave it there release it let it go take your burden to the lord leave it there if you trust and never doubt he will surely bring you [Music] take your burden to [Music] if your body suffers pain and your health you can't regain and your soul is almost seeking in despair oh jesus knows the pain you feel take your burdens to the lord and leave it there oh leave it there [Music] leave it there oh yes take your bird into the lord and leave it there if you trust and never die he will surely bring you [Music] leave it there there's a third verse there it says when you're in enemies are said and your heart begins to fail don't forget that god in heaven answers praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] he will lead you safely why don't you leave
