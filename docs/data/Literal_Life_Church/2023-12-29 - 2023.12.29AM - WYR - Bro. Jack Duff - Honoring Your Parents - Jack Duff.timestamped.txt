[0:01] Something in My Heart Like a stream
[0:04] running down makes me feel so happy
[0:09] happy as can be when I think of Jesus

[0:18] more than jeel in my soul yes there's
[0:22] something more than
[0:25] gold oh

[0:52] gold we are honored to have brother Jack
[0:54] Duff with us this morning he's going to
[0:56] be taken this morning and tonight's
[0:57] service brother Jack come on and we
[1:00] appreciate him taking the time to be

[1:07] richly amen
[1:13] turn tting testing praise the Lord God
[1:18] bless you all this morning certainly
[1:21] good to be here um at winter youth
[1:24] retreat I've uh been coming for the past
[1:27] couple years and I've always enjoyed uh
[1:30] my time here and I don't know um brother
[1:33] Barry and brother Paul can certainly
[1:35] take the show on the road uh they do a
[1:37] really good job uh just bouncing off of
[1:40] each other but we we certainly thank the
[1:42] Lord uh for them I'm
[1:45] um going to just open in a word of
[1:48] prayer and we'll get started in our
[1:51] teaching on
[1:52] today just bow your heads with
[1:55] me Father we
[1:57] are grateful for for this privilege and
[2:01] this opportunity we have to
[2:03] come speak to um these young people we
[2:08] trust Lord that the things have already
[2:10] been said have been
[2:13] transformational God that you continue
[2:15] to speak Lord into uh their hearts and
[2:18] continue to change us from glory to
[2:20] glory take control over this little
[2:23] thought that will be presented and trust
[2:25] God that it'll be helpful to every heart
[2:28] and every ear that he years it's in
[2:31] Jesus name we pray amen amen um I'm
[2:36] going to read a
[2:38] scripture and you all can just read with
[2:41] me very very familiar scripture one of
[2:44] the things that I I really really
[2:46] appreciate about this winter youth
[2:48] retreat is that we can get into
[2:50] practical
[2:52] teaching and uh I think that is so
[2:55] necessary for not only for the young
[2:58] people but for for everybody and um a
[3:01] lot of times we go to church and we get
[3:03] a lot of the deep things and uh we
[3:05] Rejoice over that but sometimes we need
[3:08] to get things just right where we're
[3:10] living right and deal with those areas I
[3:13] I love uh what brother rap did on
[3:15] yesterday with the budget um I think
[3:17] some people got a wakeup call and and as
[3:21] as you know you you were you were
[3:22] putting numbers in some of those things
[3:24] are only representing you as an
[3:26] individual it did not represent you and
[3:29] a SP house right one car pavement was
[3:32] 430 but two car Pavements is
[3:35] 860 right so you know you start looking
[3:37] at things like that and you see just
[3:39] what the reality is and how we have to
[3:41] set certain goals in order to be able to
[3:43] just live in this world that we
[3:45] currently live in so I was very very
[3:47] appreciative of that and I'm happy that
[3:48] we get a chance to talk about uh some of
[3:50] these practical things so quickly turn
[3:53] to Ephesians 6 with me uh very familiar
[3:56] passage of scripture and we'll read just
[3:58] a few verses
[4:02] forward and backwards by that oh okay
[4:04] thank you all right if you can okay
[4:08] perfect yes all right uh Ephesians
[4:12] 6 and uh it
[4:15] is verse uh 1 through3 just says this
[4:19] children obey your parents in the Lord
[4:22] for this is right honor thy father and
[4:27] mother which is the first commandment
[4:28] with promise
[4:30] that it may be well with thee and thou
[4:33] mayest live long on the earth God bless
[4:36] you you can be seated we um simply want
[4:40] to talk on the subject today of honoring
[4:44] your parents and um we have some
[4:48] commandment here in scripture uh that
[4:50] that we see and uh we just want to kind
[4:53] of talk about practical ways that you
[4:55] can do this I mean what does this really
[4:57] look like from a practical perspective
[4:59] honoring your parents and um just this
[5:04] um just want to just kind of show this
[5:06] little diagram here and in in a family
[5:10] structure the head of the family is
[5:13] Christ and after that comes the husband
[5:16] or the father and then after that comes
[5:18] the wife or the mother and then
[5:21] underneath that umbrella are the
[5:23] children the problem that we have in
[5:26] today's world is that we have children
[5:29] trying to raise above their parents but
[5:33] that is not the order that God has
[5:36] placed Us in and we want to make sure
[5:38] that we are following uh what God's
[5:40] structure is Christ first husband or
[5:43] father next then the wife and then the
[5:46] children now um the other thing I want
[5:49] to point out here is the scripture says
[5:52] there children obey your parents in the
[5:57] Lord that's an underline that we need to
[6:00] make in our Bibles in the Lord I I want
[6:03] to uh just say that if you have a parent
[6:06] that is putting pressure on you to do
[6:07] something outside of what the word of
[6:09] God tells you what to do then that's
[6:11] something that you always honor God
[6:15] first amen you always honor God first uh
[6:19] however also in Colossians 3:20 it tells
[6:21] us children obey your parents in all
[6:23] things for this is well pleasing unto
[6:26] the Lord all right um as we go through
[6:30] this I'm going to bring in a a a number
[6:32] of scriptures I'm also going to bring in
[6:34] some uh quotes and then I'm going to
[6:36] bring in some material from you know
[6:39] other sources so just just want you to
[6:41] be aware of that some of the challenges
[6:43] that we have here it says in second
[6:45] Timothy 3:
[6:47] 1-4 this know also that in the last days
[6:50] perilous times shall come dangerous
[6:53] times for men shall be lovers of their
[6:55] own selves and I think many of us have
[6:57] already heard this they can never be uh
[7:01] stated enough but in this day a new word
[7:05] was developed that was never in the
[7:08] dictionary before but it came out in
[7:10] this day and that new word was called
[7:14] Selfie men shall be lovers of themselves
[7:19] that's why they take
[7:21] selfies okay uh Covetous
[7:25] boasters proud blasphemers and look at
[7:30] this one why does Paul put this one here
[7:32] disobedient to
[7:34] parents
[7:36] unthankful
[7:38] Unholy without natural affection truth
[7:42] Breakers false accusers
[7:46] incontinent
[7:47] incontinent uh Fierce
[7:50] despiser despisers of those that are
[7:52] good Traders hey high-m minded lovers of
[7:55] Pleasures more than lovers of God these
[7:57] are the spirits that we would find that
[7:59] we'll be fighting against in this evil
[8:02] day all right and I and I and I did a um
[8:06] uh I just underline that word
[8:08] incontinent there because what that
[8:10] means is uh it's no
[8:14] self-control so when it says that people
[8:16] are incontinent they have no
[8:18] self-control at all and this truly is a
[8:21] problem in our society right no
[8:24] self-control uh disobedient and and and
[8:27] one of the uh definitions that I got
[8:28] here out of the Greek Lexicon for uh
[8:31] disobedient is
[8:33] contumacious and what that means is
[8:35] stubbornly or willfully disobedient to
[8:40] Authority stubbornly or willfully
[8:43] disobedient to Authority this is what
[8:46] was promised for this day we're living
[8:48] in this time and and as young people uh
[8:51] you actually have to fight the negative
[8:54] advice of people in the world in order
[8:57] to honor the word of God you have to
[8:59] fight the negative advice of people in
[9:01] the
[9:02] world there are spirits out here that
[9:04] we're fighting against the Bible tells
[9:06] us plainly um disobedient to parents
[9:10] inconsonant Fierce despises those things
[9:13] that are good uh we got this we see the
[9:15] Spirit uh in in full operation here a
[9:18] statement is made by brother brandom it
[9:22] says um the teenage kids took over the
[9:26] world now you know that the Bible
[9:28] predicts that unth thankful Unholy
[9:30] without natural affections truth
[9:31] Breakers false accusers disobedient to
[9:34] parents uh Teenage taking over the world
[9:37] and it's done it it says I went into a
[9:40] place the other day that they was
[9:43] playing this one of these old dirty Juke
[9:45] boxes all that stuff I didn't even want
[9:49] to take my family I said that I said to
[9:52] that lady how much does them records
[9:54] cost 10 cents a piece how many will it
[9:57] play in an hour she told me I said said
[9:59] here's the money unplug it brother
[10:01] brandom didn't want to listen to the
[10:03] music didn't want his family listening
[10:04] to that music says well she said I
[10:06] couldn't do that them
[10:08] kids the
[10:10] kids come in here to play that he says
[10:14] the teenagers are taking over the world
[10:16] right the kids the kids come in here to
[10:19] play that then I couldn't spend no money
[10:23] there I went somewhere else see well
[10:26] that stuff would make you nervous is
[10:29] that a look at look at look at that
[10:31] statement the music that people listen
[10:34] to makes them
[10:39] nervous if we're if we're fighting a
[10:41] nervous condition or something like that
[10:43] something along those lines check the
[10:45] music that we're listening to and I'm
[10:47] going to be honest with you not all
[10:49] Christian music is good music to listen
[10:53] to amen amen he says I couldn't spend no
[10:57] money there I went somewhere else see
[10:59] well that stuff would make you nervous
[11:01] you'd have a have to go down and get a
[11:03] bunch of tranquilizers to take after
[11:06] hearing that crazy
[11:09] stuff that just IRS a Christian if you
[11:13] like that kind of stuff you know what's
[11:15] wrong with you you
[11:18] need to get
[11:21] saved cuz what's in you is feeding on
[11:24] something besides the word so brother
[11:26] brandom gives us very very clear
[11:29] um instruction here you know music
[11:31] something that that the devil can use
[11:33] against you be be aware of that the
[11:35] other thing here he says you know when
[11:37] when he told the lady just unplug the
[11:38] Jukebox I'll I'll I'll pay an hour worth
[11:41] of
[11:42] unplug and I and I just I I I like the
[11:46] way he uses the word unplugg the Jukebox
[11:48] because there are some things in our
[11:50] lives that we need to unplug
[11:54] from there's things in our lives if we
[11:57] want to draw closer to God we need to
[11:59] unplug unplug uh here you know the the
[12:03] prophet you know uh just just giving us
[12:05] the these things even in the music if we
[12:07] can see the spirits that's behind the
[12:08] music then we can see what might be
[12:10] hindering our walk with the Lord
[12:13] sometimes we might might need to unplug
[12:15] even from some of the music I want to go
[12:18] to a little uh thing that I found here
[12:21] on the
[12:22] internet and um we we know about uh uh
[12:28] children that's been abused by parents
[12:29] and certainly uh if anyone's gone
[12:32] through anything like that
[12:34] um uh I all I can say is that certainly
[12:38] we start to hear that you would go
[12:39] through something of that nature and uh
[12:42] we pray that God would bring the healing
[12:43] to your heart um because I know when you
[12:46] go through something like that it's very
[12:47] hard for you to honor your parents very
[12:50] hard for you to do that but we pray that
[12:51] God will bring you to Healing to your
[12:53] heart when you're honoring your parents
[12:54] what you're doing is honoring the word
[12:55] of God God gave you certain instructions
[12:58] and what you choose to do is I'm going
[12:59] to honor the word of God however we are
[13:02] living in a day where children that have
[13:04] gone through abusive situations in their
[13:07] home eventually they they grow up and
[13:09] they become abusive
[13:11] themselves and these children now turn
[13:14] their abuse back over to the parents we
[13:17] have we have stories in the news all the
[13:19] time where some some young man has rose
[13:21] up against his father and and he's
[13:23] abusing the father now you hear it all
[13:25] the time now I want to remind you of a
[13:28] couple scriptures Exodus 21:15 And1 17
[13:31] it says this and he that smiteth his
[13:34] father or his mother shall be surely put
[13:38] to death now this is God's law from the
[13:41] Old Testament we realize we cannot
[13:43] execute things like that in the society
[13:45] in which we live today however it's good
[13:47] for us to understand the thoughts of God
[13:50] when we do things like this we have to
[13:52] fight these spirits that are coming into
[13:54] the land he that smiteth his father or
[13:56] his mother shall be surely put to death
[13:57] verse 17 says and he that
[14:00] curseth his father or his mother shall
[14:03] surely be put to death you could
[14:05] couldn't even speak ill of your parents
[14:08] in the Old
[14:09] Testament you couldn't even speak ill
[14:11] now we just released so much information
[14:14] over social media when we we have a
[14:16] disagreement we release all this
[14:17] information you were not supposed to do
[14:19] that in the Old Testament that was
[14:20] actually a death
[14:22] sentence think about it how God wants us
[14:26] to
[14:27] honor our parents
[14:29] some of the ways that children abuse
[14:31] their
[14:34] parents first is sometimes a child
[14:37] hitting is physical a child hitting or
[14:39] throwing things at a parent damaging
[14:41] property or harming family pets this is
[14:45] a way that children abuse their parents
[14:47] it's physical another one
[14:50] is verbal
[14:52] abuse taunting
[14:55] or calling their parents names
[14:59] this is a way that children abuse their
[15:03] parents another
[15:05] is emotional abuse which is threatening
[15:08] with harm to the parent or harm to
[15:13] themselves if you don't do what the
[15:16] child wants you to do also it's it's um
[15:21] intimidating the parent by following
[15:22] them around and
[15:24] relentlessly texting them this is
[15:27] considered emotional abuse
[15:30] relentlessly
[15:34] texting a fourth
[15:36] one is financial
[15:41] abuse stealing money from the
[15:44] parents or and we uh heard about this
[15:48] yesterday racking up credit card
[15:51] debt on your parents' accounts and
[15:54] children may demand at sometimes large
[15:56] sums of money if you don't do something
[15:58] something that they want this is how
[16:01] kids are abusing their parents they're
[16:03] holding parents hostage never God's
[16:07] intention for that to happen in a
[16:10] family
[16:16] amen here statement in the message
[16:19] leadership brother brandom says you know
[16:21] Jesus loves Little
[16:23] Children You know he does and there was
[16:26] a little boy one time named Moses we're
[16:29] going to talk about him just in a little
[16:31] bit and he was a very fine you know what
[16:33] made him help make him a fine boy he had
[16:34] a good mother to raise him that's see
[16:37] that's what she taught him about the
[16:39] Lord and you little boys and girls has
[16:41] got the same kind of mothers to raise
[16:42] you teach you about the Lord just mind
[16:45] them so important that we we get this
[16:48] just mind them you know what the first
[16:50] commandment is in the Bible the first
[16:52] commandment with promise with a promise
[16:55] says maybe a little hard for you to
[16:57] understand these Commandments the first
[16:58] commandment is is not to have any other
[16:59] God uh uh but him but the great
[17:02] commandment and the first commandment
[17:04] that has a promise to it see is to the
[17:05] children did you know he said children
[17:08] obey your parents which may lengthen the
[17:10] days upon the Earth that the Lord thy
[17:12] God has given thee to mind your parents
[17:15] do what you're doing it may give it may
[17:18] give you longer life upon the Earth that
[17:20] the Lord has given you more time to
[17:23] serve him I hope today that I'm looking
[17:26] at a bunch of preachers and singers and
[17:28] evangelist of the day that is to come if
[17:30] there is a day after ours now brother
[17:33] brand speaking this way back in 1965 and
[17:36] certainly there is a there has been a
[17:38] day after his there has been a day but
[17:40] we have to go back to the basics and
[17:42] remind us what God expects of us and
[17:45] like I said I know there's some really
[17:47] hard and tough situations you might say
[17:49] brother Jack you just don't know what
[17:50] I'm going through I I I don't know but I
[17:53] do know what the word of God says and
[17:56] and and what you want to do is just
[17:57] humble yourself to what the word of God
[17:59] says and honor the word of God as you
[18:01] honor the word of God I am I am I'm
[18:04] assuring you God will honor you God will
[18:07] honor you I I wanted to just go back
[18:10] into just a very basic Sunday School uh
[18:14] slide he talked about the Ten
[18:16] Commandments let's just go back and
[18:18] briefly look at
[18:20] those we we we hear but sometimes we
[18:23] might forget what they say the first one
[18:26] is thou shall not have no other gods
[18:31] before
[18:32] me thou shall not make unto
[18:36] thee any Graven
[18:40] image or any likeness of anything that
[18:43] is in heaven above or that is in the
[18:45] earth beneath or that is in the water
[18:48] under the
[18:49] Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
[18:54] them nor serve them for I the Lord thy
[18:57] God am a a jealous God visiting the
[19:00] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[19:01] children unto the third and fourth
[19:03] generation of them that hate me and
[19:06] showing Mercy unto thousands of them
[19:08] that love me and keep my Commandments
[19:11] amen we want God's mercy in order to get
[19:14] his Mercy we have to love him and keep
[19:17] his Commandments a lot of people say I
[19:19] love God but if you can't keep his word
[19:21] something's wrong
[19:23] somewhere let's go on Thou shalt not
[19:25] take the name of the Lord thy God in
[19:27] vain for the Lord Lord will not hold him
[19:30] Guiltless that taketh his name in
[19:32] vain uh verse 8
[19:35] remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy
[19:39] Verse 9 six days shalt thou labor and do
[19:42] all thy Work the next slide uh it says
[19:45] but but the seventh
[19:47] day make sure I get
[19:49] that all right the seventh day is the
[19:52] Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou
[19:54] shalt not do any work thou nor thy son
[19:57] nor thy daughter order thy man's servant
[20:00] nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor
[20:02] thy stranger that is within thy gates
[20:05] for in six days the Lord made Heaven and
[20:07] Earth the sea and all that in them is
[20:09] and rested the seventh day wherefore the
[20:11] Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallow
[20:13] hallowed it look at this verse 12 honor
[20:16] thy father and thy mother that thy days
[20:19] may be long upon the Earth upon the land
[20:21] which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[20:24] another Thou shalt not kill verse 14
[20:26] Thou shalt not commit adulter
[20:29] Thou shalt not steal we just talked
[20:32] about stealing from your parents Thou
[20:34] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[20:37] false witness against thy
[20:40] neighbor basic principles for living the
[20:45] life that we live on this Earth and
[20:47] sometimes for us all we need to do is go
[20:49] back to the basics if we want to see
[20:51] God's blessings upon our
[20:54] life let's go
[20:57] forward
[21:01] okay I put this quote
[21:04] here because um you as as you me as we
[21:08] saw yesterday brother uh brother brother
[21:10] rap used a a lot of lot of lot of
[21:13] content and I was just so blessed by it
[21:16] often times what I find especially
[21:18] amongst message
[21:20] churches um they are very very against
[21:25] people using things outside of the
[21:27] message
[21:28] I know y'all not going to say Amen but
[21:30] it's the truth anyway but I wanted to
[21:32] bring just a quote from brother brandom
[21:35] to help us when we when we look at
[21:37] practical things you know because in the
[21:39] message I'll be honest brother Brandon
[21:41] doesn't just go into a lot of details uh
[21:44] if if talking about you know children
[21:45] obey your parents it give you the basic
[21:47] scripture but then sometimes the
[21:49] ministry will come and just kind of take
[21:50] that a little deeper and give you some
[21:51] practical things that you can you can do
[21:54] now I want you to understand something
[21:55] that brother brandom said in the message
[21:57] why
[21:58] says you believe in taking medicine says
[22:01] I believe in anything that helps the
[22:05] human race is
[22:10] Godly you have some people that they
[22:12] refuse to take Med medicine just I
[22:14] believe God's going to heal me and I'm
[22:15] not knocking your faith I I have nothing
[22:18] against your nothing that's where your
[22:20] faith is praise God for that but if
[22:22] there's a brother or sister you next to
[22:23] you that wants to take some medicine for
[22:25] what they're what they're going through
[22:26] I I bless them for that
[22:28] to and what brother brandom tells us do
[22:32] anything that helps the human race
[22:35] anything that helps if this lesson today
[22:38] can help you then the lesson is
[22:43] Godly if if if if if you come here this
[22:45] weekend to The Retreat and somebody said
[22:48] something to you that can help you a
[22:50] budget brother Brandon probably never
[22:52] talked about budget I don't know if
[22:54] there's a quote that I could find on
[22:55] budget and and and put this money side
[22:58] and do I mean he talks about finances
[22:59] but budget might not be there but if if
[23:02] a budget can help you it is
[23:08] Godly I believe anything that helps the
[23:11] human race is Godly certainly it is
[23:15] exactly it is tell me what would we do
[23:17] today without these clinics and
[23:19] hospitals and so forth certainly I know
[23:21] there's some shut behind the door when I
[23:23] first started off but but where where
[23:26] did it all go see you've got to look at
[23:29] anything I just love the way the prophet
[23:32] puts that you have to look at
[23:35] anything
[23:37] sensible anything if medicine hospitals
[23:42] are not of God they're Antichrist burn
[23:45] them down get them out of the country
[23:46] sure but it's something to help you so
[23:50] since it's something to help you it's of
[23:53] God look at it sensible and see what you
[23:56] can GA gather from to help you in your
[23:59] daily
[24:01] walk
[24:03] here
[24:06] um the other thing I'll just mention
[24:08] here brother random taught us that when
[24:10] we're eating chicken if we run into a
[24:15] bone just put it to the side but look at
[24:18] it sensible don't don't don't don't
[24:21] don't get rid of the whole chicken just
[24:22] because there's a bone in the chicken no
[24:24] eat the chicken put the bone to the side
[24:28] but make sure it's a
[24:30] bone all right let's go
[24:32] forward I had
[24:34] to preface that that's my disclaimer as
[24:37] we go
[24:39] forward because there's six ways to
[24:42] honor your parents and we want to talk
[24:43] about that these six practical ways of
[24:46] honoring your parents and I and I found
[24:48] this you know this gentleman I have to
[24:49] give him credit his name is Tim Keller
[24:52] uh he wrote a a beautiful article on
[24:54] this and uh and I wanted to just uh just
[24:57] bringing he he made this statement it
[24:59] says it's respect for
[25:01] parents that is the basis for every
[25:05] other kind of respect and every other
[25:08] kind of authority let me just break that
[25:11] down if you cannot respect your parents
[25:15] it may be hard for you to respect your
[25:19] pastor if it's hard for you to respect
[25:21] your parents it may be hard for you to
[25:22] respect the
[25:24] police oh my it may be hard for you to
[25:27] respect your
[25:30] teachers the breakdown happens in the
[25:33] home and then it just oozes its we out
[25:35] into the rest of
[25:37] society amen so this respect and
[25:39] honoring parents is is something that
[25:41] kind of helps guide us in our life it
[25:45] says it's respect for parents that is
[25:47] the basis for every other kind of
[25:49] respect and every other kind of
[25:51] authority another statement that he
[25:52] makes here uh is we are to honor parents
[25:58] in
[25:59] childhood and
[26:01] adulthood for for we owe them a debt of
[26:04] Honor that never
[26:08] ends now one other things that you
[26:10] probably didn't uh know that would made
[26:13] at some point in time get into your
[26:14] budget is actually being able to take
[26:16] care of your parents when they're
[26:18] older paying for some of their
[26:21] care
[26:24] M I'm going to we're going to we're
[26:26] going to talk about some things I got
[26:27] some scriptures to show I think is going
[26:29] to be very helpful another statement
[26:31] that he makes here I understand that in
[26:34] some cases showing honor may be
[26:37] difficult but very nearly impossible we
[26:40] realize that that may happen
[26:43] however there are ways that we can honor
[26:46] one is speak well of
[26:48] them two is seek their
[26:52] wisdom three is esteem them publicly and
[26:56] privately
[26:59] four is support
[27:01] them
[27:05] five forgive
[27:09] them
[27:11] six provide for them we want to take
[27:16] these six and break them down just a
[27:17] little bit more now I said that we
[27:21] sometimes might use material from other
[27:24] people however I want to add one other
[27:25] thing to that when I see something that
[27:28] I might read online I always filter what
[27:30] I read through the message of the hour I
[27:35] always filter what I read so if you ever
[27:37] go out and you read something you you
[27:39] read a little article always filter what
[27:41] you read through what the prophet has
[27:43] already said when you filter it that way
[27:45] then you know you got something safe
[27:47] praise the Lord all right let's look at
[27:49] this let's go a little deeper speak well
[27:52] of them what is what is this uh we
[27:55] mentioned this earlier uh he that
[27:57] curseth his father or his mother shall
[27:59] surely be put to death you don't want to
[28:00] speak evil of your parents they they
[28:02] couldn't do that in the Old Testament
[28:04] and and I believe God wants us to honor
[28:07] this principle even when we're talking
[28:09] about our parents sometimes you have to
[28:10] speak truth brother brandom had to speak
[28:12] truth about his dad his dad was a drunk
[28:15] his dad was uh was a rough man his dad
[28:19] killed somebody he had to speak truth
[28:21] about him but he still spoke how he
[28:23] loved his father oh my my my my my M
[28:28] some might say my dad's a dead beat my
[28:30] dad is this he's never been there for me
[28:32] my dad this but you know what if your
[28:34] dad wasn't here you wouldn't be here so
[28:37] you have to find something positive that
[28:38] you can say about your
[28:41] parent speak well of
[28:44] them look at this Proverbs 311 says
[28:47] there is a generation that curseth their
[28:50] father and do not bless their mother you
[28:54] don't want to be a part of that
[28:55] generation uh here in Leviticus it says
[28:58] for everyone that Leviticus 29 for
[29:01] everyone that curseth his father or his
[29:03] mother shall be surely put to death he
[29:05] that cursed his father's mother his
[29:07] blood shall be upon Him brother Brandon
[29:10] makes this statement in this sermon the
[29:13] resurrection and guess where he preaches
[29:15] it in the same city in which I live West
[29:18] Palm Beach Florida he says when I was
[29:21] just a little
[29:22] lad he met my mother my mother is from
[29:25] Paris Texas my father was from entucky
[29:27] and so my dad was there breaking horses
[29:30] when he and a rodeo when he met mother
[29:33] and so they were married and mama was
[29:36] only 15 years old when I was born so
[29:38] that she was just a kid and pop was 18
[29:41] but I used to want to be like my daddy
[29:45] it says I just loved my daddy
[29:49] amen uh wasn't a Christian until a
[29:52] little bit before he died now can you
[29:54] imagine that let's let's let's think
[29:56] about that let's think about that it
[29:58] says his his dad was not a Christian
[30:00] till a little little bit before he died
[30:02] this means brother brandham lived not
[30:05] only in a household but in a family
[30:07] where the parent was not a Christian we
[30:11] got many young people that are in
[30:13] situations like that you live in a home
[30:15] where either the father's not a
[30:16] Christian or the mother's not a
[30:18] Christian or if you're not in the home
[30:21] you have to go to family gatherings and
[30:22] you're going around family that are not
[30:24] Christians how should we conduct
[30:26] ourselves
[30:28] well I can tell you one thing speak well
[30:30] of them when you're in their presence
[30:33] speak well of them right and look
[30:35] brother brandham you know he tells us
[30:36] this he says uh I just loved my daddy he
[30:39] he wasn't a Christian until a little bit
[30:41] before he died I led him to Christ but
[30:43] he was Irish through and through and a
[30:45] real Drinker see the truth coming out my
[30:48] dad's a real Drinker and no matter what
[30:53] he
[30:56] did I don't care what he
[31:01] did he's my
[31:04] daddy
[31:07] anyhow in public when he's talking about
[31:10] his dad he's telling the truth about him
[31:12] my dad this my that that but the my
[31:14] final statement that I want the public
[31:16] to hear no matter what my daddy
[31:19] did he still my
[31:23] daddy only God can give you this type of
[31:26] feeling for a
[31:28] parent only God can do that and and let
[31:31] me tell you something if God could do it
[31:32] for brother brandom he could do it for
[31:43] you this next one said seek their
[31:47] wisdom and you know I was just kind of
[31:49] looking at this in the Book of Proverbs
[31:51] because that's a that's a book that we
[31:52] go to to get wisdom um and what I found
[31:55] in the Book of Proverbs 24 times in the
[31:58] Book of Proverbs Solomon all uses the
[32:00] phrase my son my son my son my son my
[32:04] son 24 times but also in the Book of
[32:07] Proverbs he references daughters two
[32:10] times but 24 times my son my son here in
[32:13] Proverbs 18 says my son hear the
[32:18] instruction of thy father says seek
[32:21] their wisdom so hear the instruction of
[32:24] thy father and forsake not the law of
[32:28] thy mother another one here in Proverbs
[32:30] 3 vers uh 1 and 2 my
[32:33] son it says uh forget not my law but
[32:37] thine heart keep my uh but let thine
[32:40] heart keep my Commandments for length of
[32:42] days and long life and peace shall they
[32:44] add to thee another one here in in
[32:48] Proverbs chapter
[32:50] 31 The Virtuous Woman verse 29 and 30
[32:53] many daughters have done
[32:56] virtuously but thou excellest them all
[32:59] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[33:01] but a woman that fearth the Lord shall
[33:02] be praised and and I like I like I
[33:04] wanted to introduce this because in
[33:06] order for this young lady in the Book of
[33:08] Proverbs to be considered a virtuous
[33:10] woman it said many daughters have done
[33:12] virtuously many daughters she had to be
[33:14] somebody's child in order to be amen
[33:17] considered virtuous she learned
[33:19] something at home that she could take
[33:21] forward into her relationship her
[33:23] marriage she learned something at
[33:25] home many daughters have done virtu
[33:31] virtuously here brother Brandon makes a
[33:35] statement in
[33:38] leadership when we're talking about
[33:40] seeking your parents' wisdom there are
[33:42] things that your parents have gone
[33:43] through and and I just find it amazing
[33:45] we live in a day where the kids just
[33:47] because they read something on the
[33:49] Internet feel like they know more than
[33:52] their
[33:53] parents life's experiences give you a
[33:56] lot more more knowledge than what you
[33:58] learned on the internet and let me also
[34:00] just mention something to you about the
[34:01] internet I think brother brother rap
[34:02] said said this yesterday one of the one
[34:04] of the most dangerous two words the D
[34:07] the most dangerous two
[34:09] words in in our in our land today is
[34:13] studies
[34:15] show youve read something on the
[34:17] Internet now you are an expert because
[34:20] studies
[34:22] show I encourage you sit and talk things
[34:25] over with your parents before you just
[34:26] make a rash decision sit and talk things
[34:29] over with your pastor before you just
[34:31] make a rash
[34:33] decision you know I I I'll be the first
[34:36] to admit when I was a young man uh I
[34:38] almost made a very rash decision I was
[34:40] doing it simply out of uh anger and
[34:45] probably just to have my own way and one
[34:46] of those things that I wanted to do uh I
[34:48] was going to register for the Air
[34:51] Force and I told my mom that I'm going
[34:54] to register the Air Force and pretty in
[34:55] the way I was saying it I was like I'm
[34:57] going to register for the Air Force and
[34:59] I'm out of here this is my attitude I'm
[35:02] out of here I'm leaving here right and
[35:04] uh my mom was very very concerned about
[35:07] me going to register for the Air Force
[35:09] and um she she she she would come to me
[35:12] she's like please don't don't don't
[35:14] don't do it my mom is a former um marine
[35:18] and and and and and she knew how things
[35:21] went in the military she knew how bad it
[35:23] was for her and just like she's looking
[35:25] at you you're a young Christian this is
[35:27] not a good decision for you to go to the
[35:28] military it's not a good decision that
[35:30] was for me now somebody else it might be
[35:32] a different story but for me she says no
[35:33] what what God wants to do in your life
[35:35] and I wasn't a minister at that point in
[35:37] time she said but what God wants to do
[35:38] in your life I don't think this is the
[35:39] right decision well because mom was
[35:42] saying it I didn't want to listen I
[35:44] didn't want to listen so she set me up
[35:49] and one day I went to church and I knew
[35:51] I hadn't done anything wrong but the
[35:52] Pastor said uh says uh brother Jack I'd
[35:55] like to see you after service um you
[35:57] want to see me I mean I didn't do
[35:59] anything wrong what what do you want to
[36:00] need need to see me for I said okay I
[36:02] went into the office and he says I heard
[36:05] you want to go to the military oh yeah
[36:06] yeah yeah I'm going I'm I'm going to the
[36:08] Air Force and I'll be leaving uh I'm
[36:10] going to register as soon as I can and
[36:12] I'm getting out of here and uh he's like
[36:14] brother please just think about this
[36:15] think about this I said what I mean it's
[36:17] you know my I had family that served
[36:19] that everybody did this and everybody
[36:20] did that I want to go and he asked me
[36:23] one question that changed my mind about
[36:24] going to the military my pastor asked
[36:26] one
[36:27] question and the question
[36:30] was have you prayed about
[36:38] this and when he said
[36:41] that
[36:42] honestly I'd have to
[36:45] say no I didn't pray about it it's just
[36:48] something that I wanted to
[36:50] do and see sometimes it's not about what
[36:53] you want to do with your life it's about
[36:56] what God wants to do with your life he's
[36:59] the one that gave you life so you have
[37:01] to allow him to do what he wants to do
[37:03] with the life that he gave
[37:09] you even though I didn't join the Air
[37:12] Force I did get involved in another
[37:16] Army and I'm glad to be a soldier in the
[37:20] army of the Lord Brother Randon makes
[37:22] this statement he says the first is the
[37:24] mother's kindness then the father's word
[37:29] after the mother gives you your first
[37:31] step then you look to your daddy all of
[37:33] us for
[37:35] wisdom because he's the head of the
[37:37] house now you know we might have some
[37:38] here that dad's not in the house
[37:41] anything could have happened where Dad's
[37:42] not in the
[37:43] house God's given you a pastor as well
[37:45] that you can go to and get advice from
[37:47] before you make rational decisions go
[37:51] and get advice amen it says because he's
[37:55] the head of the house he's just just
[37:56] made a leader of his family so we follow
[37:58] what our daddy says do when he says now
[38:01] son I would like for you to do a certain
[38:03] thing a certain certain thing then we
[38:04] listen to him because it's wisdom that
[38:07] we listen see he's learned a whole lot
[38:09] and we've got to ask him to see what he
[38:10] learned and then we can profit by what
[38:12] he's learned he tells us now don't go
[38:15] and do this because I did that my father
[38:17] told me not to do it but I did it and it
[38:19] caused this to happened to me something
[38:21] bad so we are well it says daddy tells
[38:24] us how to do and what to do right seek
[38:28] their
[38:31] wisdom seek their wisdom sometimes you
[38:34] know my daughter she would come and talk
[38:35] to me about job situation and maybe
[38:37] wanting to leave the job and go
[38:39] somewhere else and and one of the things
[38:40] I'm I'm constantly telling I find this a
[38:42] lot in a lot of the young people
[38:43] nowadays in my day we would go to a job
[38:46] and try to stay 25 years 30 years we
[38:49] want to retire from that job and get a
[38:51] pension uh but things start shifting now
[38:54] people go to a job if they don't have
[38:55] the right VI
[38:59] VI forget about pension forget about you
[39:03] know Insurance like like that in in the
[39:06] budget they they had um they had the
[39:08] insurance there that you have to pay and
[39:10] and sometime the health insurance some
[39:12] jobs that you get will actually pay for
[39:15] your health insurance and that comes off
[39:18] your
[39:18] budget but we make decisions based on
[39:21] the vibe not the
[39:24] insurance sometimes you have to learn to
[39:26] just bear and what I've told my daughter
[39:28] I said you know what I'm going to be
[39:29] honest with you if you leave this job
[39:32] cuz all this is is a trial what you're
[39:34] going through is what we call a trial
[39:36] and no matter where you go you're going
[39:38] to have trials so when you leave this
[39:40] job and you go to the next job I can
[39:42] almost assure you Maybe not immediately
[39:46] maybe a year two years down the road you
[39:48] will find the exact same situation same
[39:51] scenario on that job because you didn't
[39:54] overcome the trial on the job
[39:58] before moving jobs does not eliminate
[40:02] the
[40:06] trial amen we have to learn to just
[40:09] absorb these things it's it's all part
[40:12] of life sometimes you're going through
[40:14] things so God can humble you amen God
[40:18] wants to teach you a lesson in the midst
[40:19] of that and you can't run from those
[40:21] lessons they will follow you seek their
[40:26] wisdom
[40:27] another statement here they told us in
[40:30] way ways that we can
[40:32] esteem uh we can honor our parents has
[40:34] esteem them publicly and and privately
[40:37] this man Tim Keller made this statement
[40:39] he says parents long to see how they
[40:42] have impacted their
[40:44] children how their children are a
[40:47] reflection of their
[40:49] strengths their
[40:51] values you don't realize how important
[40:53] it is to give them credit where you you
[40:56] can how important it is to give your
[40:59] parents credit where you can one of the
[41:03] simple things that I do and I've done it
[41:05] in in the past now I don't know if young
[41:07] men still do this I hope they
[41:10] do but if a young lady is approaching a
[41:24] door if a young lady is approaching the
[41:27] door it's it's being a
[41:30] gentleman by actually opening the door
[41:34] for the young lady not you see her
[41:38] coming you you you actually look back
[41:42] you saw she was only few steps behind
[41:45] you you walk out and you actually only
[41:46] open the door slightly so you can
[41:48] squeeze out and it closes right after
[41:51] you
[41:53] leave but no a gentleman would actually
[41:57] stopping I saw you coming no long no
[41:59] matter how long you had to hold that
[42:02] door open the other night that I got
[42:04] caught that
[42:05] way it was it was a string of people
[42:08] coming but what what what encouraged me
[42:10] there was another brother I can't I
[42:11] don't know I don't know if it was him
[42:13] but there was another brother that
[42:14] opened the door and I he had the first
[42:17] door I said oh I see you open I got to
[42:18] open the second one so I opened the
[42:19] second one and we just let a string of
[42:22] people come through and that and now
[42:24] this is for brothers and sisters is that
[42:26] we had the door
[42:28] open
[42:30] amen and at the end he says hey you've
[42:33] been holding it long enough go ahead you
[42:34] go on through and and I'll go behind you
[42:36] and I I appreciate that but we need
[42:38] gentlemen like that and anytime I would
[42:40] happen to me and somebody say you know
[42:42] what thank you for being a gentleman I
[42:43] said you know my parents taught me this
[42:47] they taught me to respect women they
[42:48] taught me to do this they taught me to
[42:49] do that so I just it's I'm just I'm a
[42:52] reflection of what my parents taught me
[42:55] when I say yes ma'am or yes
[43:01] sir we don't use those words anymore yes
[43:05] ma'am and yes sir we always respected
[43:08] our
[43:09] elders amen we always respected our
[43:12] elders we we we we we we we we we
[43:14] admired them so we spoke differently to
[43:16] them in my day we didn't call our elders
[43:19] by first
[43:21] name Mr
[43:23] M brother sister
[43:27] we use we use terms like that it was
[43:30] honor and respect for those that are a
[43:32] little older than us amen but anytime I
[43:36] would do that and someone would
[43:37] compliment me I say my parents are the
[43:38] ones that instill these things in me and
[43:41] um and and I know that uh because of the
[43:44] way they instilled this in me this is
[43:45] just who I am in the public you we we we
[43:49] esteem our parents
[43:52] publicly and privately there was um
[43:59] an
[44:02] opportunity
[44:04] that me and my brothers and sisters
[44:08] had when um my father was passing away
[44:14] um I I I I was raised in what we call a
[44:17] Brady Bunch family and some of y'all
[44:19] that might not you don't know what that
[44:21] is but there used to be a show years ago
[44:23] on television called The Brady Bunch and
[44:25] what it was it was one man that had
[44:26] three sons married a lady that had three
[44:29] daughters and they became a family well
[44:32] that's what happened in my family my my
[44:34] my dad had two kids my stepdad had two
[44:36] kids my mom had two kids and married
[44:39] made a family
[44:42] so I've only known my stepdad as Dad for
[44:45] all of my life and and I like to I like
[44:48] to say this I like to say this because I
[44:50] know that I'm living or I'm speaking to
[44:52] young people that could be in a
[44:54] situation where you are in a step parent
[44:57] home sometimes the relationships are a
[44:59] little
[45:01] challenged sometimes things that happen
[45:02] in homes like that it's a little
[45:04] challenging but I I I stand as a
[45:06] testimony that you can make it through a
[45:08] home like
[45:09] that you can make it through a home like
[45:12] that it's not hopeless because you're in
[45:13] that situation sometimes God has
[45:16] orchestrated for you to be in that
[45:17] situation in order to provide blessings
[45:19] to you later on that you have no idea
[45:21] coming your
[45:23] way we all gathered around my
[45:26] my dad's bad bed he was sick and we knew
[45:30] that he wouldn't be with us
[45:32] long and I told my brothers and sisters
[45:34] I said you know what while he can still
[45:37] see us while he can still hear us we're
[45:41] going to all Speak Life over him we're
[45:44] going to tell him how much we appreciate
[45:46] him for what he did for us as
[45:48] individuals each one take your turn take
[45:51] your time and take your turn to say
[45:52] something positive to dad before he
[45:54] leaves us and we went from the oldest to
[45:57] the youngest five of us and we gathered
[46:00] around his sick bed and we all begin to
[46:02] speak dad you did this and we just
[46:04] appreciate you you did that you
[46:06] instilled this and you instilled that
[46:08] Dad that's why we love you so
[46:10] much and when my dad left here he could
[46:13] leave with a smile on his face that his
[46:15] children blessed him esteem them
[46:22] publicly and
[46:24] privately
[46:26] I want to esteem my mom in front of you
[46:28] today if I can my mom I remember one
[46:31] time when when she first came to the
[46:33] Lord and we didn't understand about
[46:35] being saved we didn't we grew up in
[46:37] church but we didn't understand
[46:38] salvation but when my mom given her
[46:40] heart to the Lord I remember there was a
[46:42] time that uh we were we were in the
[46:44] house and and um man we were hungry we
[46:48] were hungry and and that that stage in
[46:50] life we didn't realize uh that maybe we
[46:52] should be the ones going in the kitchen
[46:54] and get something to eat for ourselves
[46:55] if we're
[46:59] hungry what we did was we relied solely
[47:03] on Mom Mom's here we know Mom just
[47:06] finished working but Mom's here she'll
[47:08] prepare a special meal for us and we'll
[47:10] eat tonight well this night we could not
[47:12] find
[47:13] mom like her car is here but where's Mom
[47:19] Mom I'm hungry and we went to Dad Dad
[47:22] where's Mom we're hungry oh she'll be
[47:24] back she'll be back I'm like well what
[47:25] where is she he never told us where she
[47:27] was we finally
[47:30] stumbled and found where Mom was she was
[47:34] in we had a a conversion van at the time
[47:37] and mom was locked inside the conversion
[47:40] van
[47:41] praying for her
[47:49] family I appreciate my mom stealing away
[47:52] and praying like that even though I was
[47:54] hungry but I appreciate her stealing
[47:56] away and praying for me who knows where
[47:58] I would be
[47:59] today if I didn't have a mom that was
[48:03] willing to
[48:09] pray brother Brandon makes this
[48:13] statement in the message Mother's Day
[48:15] says but I might pass this on to the
[48:17] young people do you know Abraham Lincoln
[48:19] never owned the book in his
[48:22] life until he was after 21 years old but
[48:25] the Bibles and the fox book of Martyrs
[48:29] see what you read molds the character
[48:33] that you
[48:36] are no
[48:37] wonder we got a bunch of neurotics
[48:41] today neurotics
[48:43] today that would be related to mental
[48:47] health and brother brandom just told us
[48:49] a secret what we
[48:51] read affects our Mental Health
[49:00] what you read molds the character that
[49:02] you are no wonder we got a bunch of
[49:04] neurotics today little old fiction
[49:07] magazines and vulgar and nonsense is
[49:09] placed upon our news stance he own the
[49:12] Bible and the fox book of Martyrs look
[49:14] what it made him but in the face of all
[49:16] that one day he made a statement like
[49:18] this he said if there could be any good
[49:21] thing found in
[49:24] me it's
[49:26] because of a Godly
[49:29] mother that reared him to serve the Lord
[49:32] he esteemed his
[49:34] mother
[49:38] publicly we want to encourage you esteem
[49:40] your parents publicly and
[49:44] privately let's go
[49:46] forward here it
[49:48] says another way that you could honor
[49:51] them is to support them support them now
[49:57] I want to just uh uh mention
[50:01] this this support is not necessarily
[50:04] financial support we'll talk about that
[50:05] a little bit later but when we're talk
[50:07] about support in this area is it's it's
[50:09] assuring your
[50:11] mom assuring your dad that even when you
[50:15] get
[50:15] older I'm not going to forsake
[50:24] you my
[50:26] my primary job as pastor but on the side
[50:29] I run a little
[50:31] business and I have an opportunity to go
[50:33] into many homes it's a home health
[50:34] business and I have a opportunity to go
[50:36] into many homes and I watch many
[50:40] families that when the parents get ill
[50:43] can't take care of themselves there are
[50:45] many families that leave their parents
[50:47] to fend for
[50:50] themselves but then I see other families
[50:52] where the children are all actively
[50:53] involved in making sure that they have
[50:55] the care and everything like that and
[50:56] anytime I find a family where all the
[50:58] kids are actively involved I always make
[51:01] it my business to say I appreciate what
[51:03] you're doing for your mom and for your
[51:05] dad when when when when they get in
[51:08] their old age we have a
[51:11] responsibility support
[51:13] them support them promise them I'm not
[51:17] going to leave you I'm not going to
[51:18] forsake you I'm going to be right there
[51:20] for you you were there for me now it's
[51:23] my turn to be there for
[51:27] you here the scripture says in John 21:1
[51:30] 17-18 says he saith unto him the third
[51:34] time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me
[51:37] Peter was grieved because he said unto
[51:39] him the third time lovest thou me and he
[51:41] said unto him Lord thou knowest all
[51:43] things thou knowest that I love thee
[51:45] Jesus said un him feed my
[51:47] sheep verily verily I said unto thee
[51:49] when thou was young thou Gest thyself
[51:53] and walst with thou wouldest but when
[51:55] thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch
[51:57] forth thine hand and another shall GTH
[52:00] thee and carry thee whether thou
[52:02] wouldest not Peter is being warned
[52:05] you're going to get old and you're going
[52:06] to need help and let me tell you
[52:08] something young people you might be
[52:09] young today but every day you wake up
[52:12] and see the
[52:14] sun you're moving in a different
[52:17] direction you're going to get older and
[52:20] older and older the seeds that you sow
[52:23] now are the ones that will come up amen
[52:27] when you get that
[52:29] age
[52:31] here uh another little uh scripture here
[52:34] Isaiah 6:46 and4 and this is for the
[52:37] parents I I I I just leave this one here
[52:39] because sometimes we have kids that no
[52:40] matter what you say they're going to do
[52:41] it their way however I like this promise
[52:45] even to your old age to the parents I am
[52:49] he and even to uh uh wh hairs will carry
[52:53] uh and and I am he and and and even to
[52:56] wh hairs will I carry you I have made
[53:00] you and I will bear even I will carry
[53:04] and will deliver you if the children
[53:06] fail God has made a promise that he's
[53:09] going to carry so somehow some way it's
[53:11] going to work out but as children I want
[53:13] you to step into your role in honoring
[53:17] your
[53:18] parents as young
[53:21] people as mature adult people right as
[53:25] old people middle-aged people honor your
[53:31] parents brother brandom makes this
[53:35] statement in the message
[53:37] indictment and I tell you some night not
[53:40] all of you together just but just a
[53:42] little trip down they set up with her
[53:45] day and night and a little little trip
[53:47] down there from this Tabernacle in the
[53:48] different Tabernacles the sister
[53:50] Tabernacles here some of you people go
[53:53] down and see the right family I'm sure
[53:55] they would appreciate it now I want you
[53:57] to catch what the prophet is telling us
[53:59] here not just supporting our our loved
[54:02] ones but what about some of the other
[54:04] older Saints in the
[54:08] church what about the brother that can't
[54:11] cut his grass
[54:12] anymore what about the sister that can't
[54:15] clean the house anymore and maybe one of
[54:17] the young sisters can go down there and
[54:18] support her or a group of young sisters
[54:21] can go and support her a group of young
[54:23] Brothers can go down and support and not
[54:25] just leave it up to the pastor to go do
[54:29] it you want the pastor to preach bring
[54:32] Heaven
[54:33] down but you also want to do all the
[54:35] work why not get involved in things like
[54:38] this that's right I told you practical
[54:44] teaching brother random and and and
[54:46] notice notice what he says
[54:48] here it this wasn't even just for his
[54:51] Tabernacle the people in his church if
[54:53] it was a surrounding Church church and
[54:56] you know that brother sister's down you
[54:58] can go help oh my we have often many
[55:02] times where maybe a person might live in
[55:04] one city but they go to a church in
[55:05] another city but there are saints that
[55:08] go to another church in that city which
[55:09] they live rather than say well hey if
[55:11] you were part of our church then we'd be
[55:12] there supporting you no brother brandom
[55:14] didn't say
[55:15] that it's a sister
[55:18] Tabernacle you see they need
[55:20] help as a
[55:24] Christian
[55:25] just jump in and
[55:27] help look at what he says he says this
[55:31] is support right he says this some
[55:34] people go down and see the right family
[55:36] I'm sure they would appreciate it just
[55:38] go down sit with them a little while and
[55:40] talk to them shake their hand and if no
[55:43] more than a little friendly
[55:47] visit we forget that so easy you know
[55:50] and when it comes to our own home then
[55:52] we appreciate it and we must remember
[55:55] others appreciate it too and the right
[55:57] family I'm sure would appreciate that
[55:59] and supporting the right family is not
[56:01] just brother brandom going down and
[56:02] paying a visit but the Saints Gathering
[56:05] and going to pay a visit you don't have
[56:08] to cook tonight sister I'll bring a meal
[56:11] brother you don't have to worry about
[56:12] this I'll be there to cut the
[56:14] grass we're going to take care of
[56:19] that support
[56:23] them
[56:30] another way to honor your parents and I
[56:32] know we have some situations here that
[56:34] might probably blow my mind if I heard
[56:37] them but I tell you the word of God is
[56:39] still true no matter what situation you
[56:41] find yourself in and one of the things
[56:43] that I want to encourage you is if you
[56:44] have a broken relationship and maybe
[56:47] your parents have done something against
[56:49] you um you still have to come to a spot
[56:51] where you can
[56:53] forgive that parent maybe they didn't
[56:55] show you love the way that you wanted to
[56:57] be loved right and and I believe um
[57:00] brother brother rat was talking about
[57:02] that how we have the the A and C and and
[57:04] then the B you know it's the belief
[57:06] system there's a consequence and you
[57:08] know there's belief system that kind of
[57:09] drives that consequence right but he was
[57:11] saying he was saying um you know there
[57:13] are things that happen that produ these
[57:16] con consequences there are things that
[57:17] happen but it's what we believe about it
[57:20] it's what we believe about it you know
[57:22] um I've talked to people in the past
[57:23] like you know my mom never never hugged
[57:25] me so it's hard for me to hug other
[57:27] people my my dad never did this so it's
[57:29] hard for me to do that you can't blame
[57:31] it all on on everybody else you can't do
[57:33] that that's your belief system you can't
[57:35] do that God gives you something
[57:36] different where you can go beyond where
[57:38] Mom and Dad went you sometimes the
[57:40] environment that your parents were
[57:42] raised in created their
[57:45] personality but the environment that
[57:46] you're raised in creates a different
[57:49] personality and the other thing that
[57:50] creates a different personality is the
[57:52] holy spirit
[57:53] itself
[57:57] forgive them here the scripture tells us
[58:00] in Mark 11:25 and 26 when you stand
[58:04] praying
[58:06] forgive if you have ought against any
[58:09] that your father also which is in heaven
[58:10] May forgive you your your trespasses but
[58:13] if you do not forgive neither will your
[58:14] father which is in heaven forgive your
[58:23] trespasses
[58:27] there's a story that brother brandom
[58:31] told
[58:33] about the Harlot Rahab in
[58:37] scripture and um thank God for a prophet
[58:40] being able to kind of go into the depths
[58:42] of this how how did rehab become a
[58:46] harlot he tells us the answer how did
[58:49] she become a harlot did did she just
[58:51] make this decision one day
[58:53] that I'm going to be a
[58:57] harlot that's not what happened to Rahab
[59:00] what happened to Rahab is that her
[59:02] father and her mother because of her
[59:05] beauty began to sell her on the
[59:09] streets I thought about
[59:11] this Rahab in this condition as a harlot
[59:15] was the one that received the two spies
[59:17] into her home when she got the spies in
[59:20] her home uh she told them said we know
[59:24] that they're going to come and destroy
[59:25] the city they're going to take it down
[59:26] the people in this city already talking
[59:28] about it we know what's getting ready to
[59:29] happen we know but she said you know
[59:31] what because of this favor of me hiding
[59:33] you all I need a favor from
[59:36] you promise me that you won't destroy me
[59:39] when I come when you guys come when you
[59:42] come don't don't do that you want to he
[59:44] says okay this Scarlet thread that you
[59:46] let out let us down out of your window
[59:49] everyone that you can get into the house
[59:51] will be spared and and and the beauty
[59:54] beautiful part of this is that rahab's
[59:56] house was on the wall and when the walls
[59:58] of Jericho came down there was only one
[1:00:00] place on the wall that didn't come down
[1:00:02] and that's where rahab's house was but
[1:00:04] Rahab says I want not just you to spare
[1:00:06] me but spare my father my
[1:00:11] mother all of my family I want you to
[1:00:14] spare them now now now here's the thing
[1:00:16] I want to say if anyone had a Justified
[1:00:23] reason
[1:00:25] to not love their
[1:00:27] parents Rahab had that
[1:00:29] reason Rahab forfeited
[1:00:35] that Rahab forfeited that feeling Rahab
[1:00:39] forfeited that emotion rehab for
[1:00:42] forfeited all of that I want my my
[1:00:45] family to be
[1:00:49] saved she told him a story she got them
[1:00:51] in the house they were spared if there
[1:00:54] was anyone that was justified and not
[1:00:56] honoring their
[1:00:57] parents Rahab would have been that
[1:01:01] one and I hope that no no one here is in
[1:01:04] this in a bad situation as Rahab was but
[1:01:06] if you were you have an example in
[1:01:09] scripture as to how she conducted
[1:01:11] herself and I want to I want to let you
[1:01:13] know something Rahab did that
[1:01:16] without the Holy
[1:01:23] Ghost
[1:01:25] this little statement here we're coming
[1:01:27] to a close here in a second I got one
[1:01:29] more slide that I want to bring to you
[1:01:31] uh brother brandom no actually this
[1:01:34] gentleman uh uh Mr kellerer says perhaps
[1:01:38] the most important way we can honor our
[1:01:40] parents is to forgive them the fact is
[1:01:43] there is no perfect
[1:01:47] parents all parents have fallen far
[1:01:49] short of their children's
[1:01:51] expectations and in all likelihood even
[1:01:54] their their own
[1:01:56] expectations our parents have sinned
[1:01:58] against us they have made unwise
[1:02:01] decisions they have made unrealistic
[1:02:04] expectations they have said and done
[1:02:06] things that have left us deeply
[1:02:09] wounded for that reason many children
[1:02:11] enter adulthood controlled by anger and
[1:02:16] bitterness they find themselves unable
[1:02:19] to move past their parents' mistakes or
[1:02:21] their parents sin don't allow some
[1:02:24] mistake I mean brother brother brother
[1:02:26] rap was my just uh so transparent with
[1:02:30] us when he said he just went running
[1:02:32] into the house and saw his daughter
[1:02:33] sitting on the ground and just didn't
[1:02:34] even ask questions just
[1:02:37] swack now he apologized for that but she
[1:02:40] if she wanted to she could take that and
[1:02:42] hold of my dad did this and you know
[1:02:43] what the devil will do the devil only
[1:02:45] show what Dad did but it won't show her
[1:02:47] that dad also washed dishes with you dad
[1:02:50] also apologized to you Dad also did all
[1:02:53] these other things in order to try to
[1:02:55] make that right but if if she wanted to
[1:02:57] she could hold on to the negative part
[1:02:58] of what Dad did and not the positive I
[1:03:01] want to encourage you find something
[1:03:02] positive find something positive that
[1:03:04] you can hold on that your parents
[1:03:06] did
[1:03:09] forgive
[1:03:14] them this last
[1:03:17] one we talked about six
[1:03:20] ways that you can honor your parents
[1:03:25] this one says provide for
[1:03:28] them and
[1:03:31] um I want you to notice the scripture
[1:03:34] especially you
[1:03:39] Brothers honor
[1:03:41] widows that are widows indeed maybe a
[1:03:45] family goes through the loss of a father
[1:03:46] and and and and here the the the the the
[1:03:49] the scripture is telling us honor widows
[1:03:52] that are widows indeed look at the next
[1:03:55] verse but if any
[1:03:58] widow have children let's stop there
[1:04:02] first they have children then it's the
[1:04:04] children's responsibility to help
[1:04:07] support the
[1:04:10] family the children's responsibility
[1:04:12] it's not the church's responsibility it
[1:04:15] becomes the children's responsibility if
[1:04:17] these children are working
[1:04:19] children see this goes this just blows
[1:04:21] your budget right out of the water there
[1:04:22] are other things that can come and out
[1:04:24] your life that you have to find a way to
[1:04:26] make it
[1:04:27] work I want to tell you another thing
[1:04:29] that the scripture says there I want you
[1:04:30] to see the other thing
[1:04:32] if the W if any widow have children
[1:04:38] or
[1:04:40] nephews it didn't say
[1:04:44] nieces Brothers what a responsibility
[1:04:47] lies on our
[1:04:49] shoulders what a responsibility and we
[1:04:51] have to we this is what the scripture
[1:04:53] calls us
[1:04:55] too if if if if there's a if it's a
[1:04:57] widowed situation and you know your
[1:04:59] uncle just passed and oh you know I got
[1:05:01] to step
[1:05:04] up but you ought to feel the weight of
[1:05:06] responsibility I got to step up this is
[1:05:09] certainly a house that I need to be at
[1:05:11] cutting the grass this is certainly a
[1:05:13] house where I need to be at doing some
[1:05:14] of the the the odds and ends around this
[1:05:17] I I need to step
[1:05:19] up and you're not doing it just because
[1:05:21] you're being nice you're doing it
[1:05:22] because of scripture
[1:05:25] right if any widow have children or
[1:05:33] nephews let them first show piety at
[1:05:36] home and to requite their parents for
[1:05:39] that is good and
[1:05:43] acceptable before
[1:05:47] God verse seven and 8 in the same
[1:05:53] chapter
[1:05:55] and these things give in charge that
[1:05:58] they may be
[1:05:59] blameless but if any provide not for his
[1:06:02] own spe and especially for those of his
[1:06:06] own house he have denied the
[1:06:11] faith and it's
[1:06:14] worse than an
[1:06:16] Infidel you're worse than an
[1:06:19] unbeliever when you don't just do these
[1:06:21] basic
[1:06:23] things
[1:06:24] see I say you know sometimes it's good
[1:06:26] for us just to kind of go back to the
[1:06:27] basics see what the scriptures actually
[1:06:30] calling for us and and and and for the
[1:06:32] young lady that might be thinking about
[1:06:34] getting married to that young man you
[1:06:35] heard this scripture you know what and
[1:06:37] uh something happens in the house you're
[1:06:38] married into that family you can't now
[1:06:41] get jealous but why are you spending so
[1:06:42] much time at your auntie house because
[1:06:45] the scripture told me to do
[1:06:47] it you ought to jump in there too and
[1:06:49] try to help out because he has a
[1:06:50] responsibility he has if she if if she
[1:06:52] doesn't have children he has a be there
[1:06:54] to help out the scripture tells him to
[1:06:57] do
[1:07:02] it this is what honor looks
[1:07:04] like this this is this is you know when
[1:07:07] you just um uh impr providing for them
[1:07:10] we also realize financially this this is
[1:07:12] this is this is big we have to be there
[1:07:14] to help out now you know I know that
[1:07:16] there's sometimes there's some
[1:07:17] situations that come up you might not be
[1:07:18] able to do it all but do what you can I
[1:07:21] want to encourage you here brother
[1:07:24] Brandon makes a statement here for a
[1:07:28] young man had a
[1:07:30] question about his dad says what can I
[1:07:34] do for him should I

[1:11:55] in relation to your parents you're all

[1:12:12] need to say because you just been
[1:12:15] pastored you just had a pastor talk to
[1:12:17] you today and that is good Sound Advice
[1:12:21] you say it doesn't matter hey
[1:12:24] I'm 55 years old and holding my
[1:12:28] father-in-law just blew out 97 candles
[1:12:31] on his
[1:12:32] birthday
[1:12:35] 97 and we still care for him
[1:12:39] 247 my wife and I part of the reason my
[1:12:42] wife is not here is because of her
[1:12:45] father and my my my parents and her mom
[1:12:49] have passed away but we care for her
[1:12:51] father uh d day and night and have
[1:12:54] caregivers that help us to do that and
[1:12:57] uh we we have to monitor everything from
[1:13:00] his medicines to what he eats and how
[1:13:02] much salt he gets and it's a constant
[1:13:05] thing my wife asked me one day she said
[1:13:07] what would happen if I died how would
[1:13:09] you treat my father she asked me that
[1:13:13] and I said there's two things I want to
[1:13:14] tell you number one I love you and
[1:13:16] because of you I would honor him and
[1:13:18] number two the Bible says to honor your
[1:13:21] father and your mother and he is a part
[1:13:23] of me through the Covenant of marriage
[1:13:25] and I said so that's my obligation she
[1:13:27] said I feel better about them but I said
[1:13:30] don't
[1:13:33] die at least not until we save more
[1:13:35] money you
[1:13:37] know so uh let me tell you it it is a
[1:13:41] powerful thing and you may not think it
[1:13:42] is but when you think about you know
[1:13:45] getting married and uh looking at a uh
[1:13:48] you know a girl or a guy you need to you
[1:13:50] need to think about this because you're
[1:13:52] not just marrying that girl and take
[1:13:55] extracting her into your little uh into
[1:13:57] your fairy tale world you are be going
[1:14:00] to become a part of that family and
[1:14:02] you're going to be affected by that
[1:14:04] family you're going to be affected by
[1:14:05] their
[1:14:06] upbringing and there's a lot of things
[1:14:08] that lap over when it comes to this
[1:14:10] issue brother Jack I think he could do a
[1:14:13] series on that but I'll tell you what
[1:14:15] now I feel like I wish I was here with
[1:14:16] brother R preach cuz uh man sounds like
[1:14:20] that would have put us all in the
[1:14:21] Rapture if I had been here
[1:14:23] with rap can you preach it again this
[1:14:27] afternoon hey I there's a lot of sound
[1:14:30] wisdom that that we've heard and and uh
[1:14:33] don't just take that lightly uh because
[1:14:35] you just been you just heard from your
[1:14:37] pastor this week and there's some really
[1:14:40] good sound advice that's there I took
[1:14:42] down lots of notes on that brother Jack
[1:14:45] and I appreciate uh appreciate that very
[1:14:47] much and uh God God sees how you act
[1:14:51] toward your appearance and I know that
[1:14:53] like brother Jack said I know that there
[1:14:55] are lots of different situations here
[1:14:57] and there's lots of different troubling
[1:15:00] situations where there's been abuse and
[1:15:01] terrible things that have happened here
[1:15:03] but you know what that doesn't change
[1:15:05] the word of God and I know that that's
[1:15:07] not easy and some of you uh you know may
[1:15:10] may need a little personal help
[1:15:11] one-onone with your pastor or something
[1:15:13] else but let me just share this with you
[1:15:16] when I grew up and when I grew up we
[1:15:18] came in the message uh my dad was an
[1:15:21] alcoholic and uh I remember when Mom
[1:15:24] came in the message at 55 years old and
[1:15:27] Dad uh was still an alcoholic still a
[1:15:29] Catholic uh I remember going into the
[1:15:32] dining room and watching them and Mom
[1:15:34] would be at one end of the table for
[1:15:36] having dinner and dad would be on the
[1:15:38] other end of the table and the dad would
[1:15:40] put a TV in the middle of the table so
[1:15:43] he could watch TV uh while he was eating
[1:15:46] his dinner and in every way our house
[1:15:48] was affected by uh the fact that he was
[1:15:52] not a Believer how how they paid tithes
[1:15:54] where they spent their free time
[1:15:56] vacations everything was affected by the
[1:15:58] fact that they were two different
[1:16:00] beliefs and I developed an attitude I
[1:16:03] developed a real attitude about my
[1:16:05] father because I didn't think he was
[1:16:06] being fair to my mother I didn't I
[1:16:08] thought it was bordered on abuse he
[1:16:10] never physically abused her but uh you
[1:16:12] know I didn't think it was fair at all
[1:16:15] and I I'll tell you what when I was
[1:16:17] married dad was gone and I was married
[1:16:19] and raising my boys I had to get down on
[1:16:22] my knees one day and asked God to
[1:16:24] deliver me from the habits that I had
[1:16:27] inherited from my father that I knew I
[1:16:29] was going to pass on to my
[1:16:31] boys because I'm an acoa an adult child
[1:16:34] of an alcoholic so was brother brandham
[1:16:37] brother brandham said he was an ACA an
[1:16:39] ad old child of an alcoholic and I knew
[1:16:41] that if I didn't correct this I would
[1:16:44] pass those habits on to my boys and they
[1:16:47] would be the adult grandchildren of an
[1:16:49] alcoholic that's a real thing that's a
[1:16:52] real thing
[1:16:53] and brother brandham was that and he
[1:16:55] told Billy Paul the same thing there's a
[1:16:57] quote where brother Bram was walking
[1:16:59] through the bowy in Chicago the ghetto
[1:17:01] and he saw these drunks laying on the
[1:17:03] side of the street remember that and he
[1:17:05] said to Billy Paul he said Billy take a
[1:17:07] look he said but for the grace of God
[1:17:09] this is where I would be and then he
[1:17:11] turned to him and he said and but for
[1:17:14] the grace of God here's where you'd
[1:17:15] eventually
[1:17:17] be what what happened God
[1:17:20] intervened right so it's just a Grace of
[1:17:23] godone so uh let me we all have a story
[1:17:26] we all have a past and it's a it's a
[1:17:28] real thing brother Jack thank you for uh
[1:17:30] ministering that that sensitive subject
[1:17:33] and a lot of really good stuff there so
[1:17:35] we appreciate that very
[1:17:37] much
