Atmosphere

When you’re not feeling your best
And your body’s needing rest
He can wipe away your tears—you can change the atmosphere.
When your heart is overwhelmed
And you can’t seem to calm yourself
If you can just get your mind clear—you can change the atmosphere. 
If you’re tired of struggling, and you need a song to sing,
Turn your sadness into cheer—you can change the atmosphere.
We are more than conquerors—Jesus told us in His Word,
That we can push away all fears—and we can change the atmosphere.
Through Christ we have authority 
Our praises make the darkness flee and He promised to be near,
So let’s change the atmosphere.
