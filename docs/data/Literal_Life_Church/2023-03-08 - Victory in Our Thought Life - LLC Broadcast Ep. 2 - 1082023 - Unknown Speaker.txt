ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I say Amen to that second Corinthians chapter 10 will be a verse related to the subject this morning second Corinthians chapter 10 and we'll just add this in to bring us into the channel of the thought second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5. casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought every thought what a Christian Life bringing into captivity every thought how many have has a lot of thoughts come to you how many no some of them aren't of God bringing in the Captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ I can't do that for you I don't even think the Lord does that for you you in submission you do this you bring into captivity every thought so there might be a lot of things we don't have control over in this world but I believe a Christian has control over his thoughts to direct His Thoughts by the Holy Ghost within him now Psalms chapter 1 is turned into a bit of a series here and I didn't expect that but it did and it's about where the believer positions himself it's really about that in three verses it really speaks of where a Believer possesses himself himself so that he can have perfect faith and that he can live a prosperous life spiritually he can live a life that's um before God and we found on Wednesday night that the first thing that he does is he he positions himself away from the influences of ungodly counsel away from the influence of the way of Sinners and away from sitting in the seat of the scornful so it's specific things that we talked about Wednesday night if you want to hear it I'm sure that they have it there where it's specific so that that's the first thing as a Believer has to position himself away from certain influences if he doesn't he can't live in Victory if she doesn't she can't live in Victory if you're not willing to separate yourself from wrong things and the seed of the scornful and all these things we mentioned that you're then you're really not willing to live in full victory so now when we separate ourselves that's the only the first step but that's not all we find more here that if you sanctify and separate yourself it's it's there's something about it that when you separate and sanctify yourself for the Lord you have to fill your life with something else I mean he knows the scripture Jesus said uh uh the spirits in a man and in a vessel and a house and then they're cleaned out and if that man doesn't get filled then seven other demons come and fill him because there's another process there's another step to be filled with the Holy Ghost can you say Amen you may sanctify your life and separate this but if you don't replace it with something else then you're going to be weak again and Jesus even says other demons will come back so we learned that's something that's throughout the Bible that a Believer can't just separate himself from things of the world but he has to be filling himself with the right things be filled that's why you have terms in the Bible like be filled with the spirit walk in the spirit receive ye the Holy Ghost he gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey him that's the truth brothers and sisters and anybody is under those rules any of human beings are under those rules you can sanctify your life to the max but unless you're exposing yourself to the word of God and feeding on the word of God and saying Lord fill me with your spirit and keep me filled with your spirit so this man in Psalms 1 if we look at it he's a blessed man of God blessed is the man he's blessed and it says first of all that his Delight is in the law of the Lord so we find something that that this is a passion this is something that he gives his life to his passion and his Delight is in the word he's not only separated himself from other influences but his passion his thrust his attention his desire is to be filled with the word and to stay in the word can you say Amen and so above anything else the word is his passion it's his Delight I'm going to linger on this a bit because we know we have sometimes where people it's it's a duty but it's not a delight in this man it's not a duty to be in the word it's his Delight and if it's not that to you to you all you have to say is the Lord deal with my heart because I want it to be a delight I want it to be a passion and to this fella here he's blessed because his passion and Delight is in the word it's above anything else the word is exciting to him is the word exciting to you it's exciting to him he can't wait to hear the word he can't wait to get to church David was this kind of person about the word because he said I was glad when they came and told me let's go to the house of the Lord the The Chariot is outside waiting it's time to go to church it's the set time at 11 o'clock what 10 30 whatever it is and David said something Rose in me when they came and told me the chariot's ready it's warmed up ready to go and when they said it's time to go something rose up and says I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord it wasn't a duty it was a delight it's exciting to them can't wait to get to church can't wait to open his Bible and read it can't wait to have time to get into his word this and I want you to catch this point because we'll go into this a little bit more this is at a desire level on the inside of this man and it's a desire level is at the soul level and Paul says the Commandments of God are not Grievous to us this is not Grievous this is enjoyable this is not I have to this is I get to come on now say Amen this is not I have to do this this is I get to do this big difference can you say Amen this is not a pressure this is a passion this is not a drudgery this is a desire this is not someone telling you to do it or you need it this is your soul telling you that you want it it's at a desire level it's at a soul level but you see now it's not just reading it it's not just his passion is for it but as he takes it to the next thing he says his Delight is in the law of the Lord but he so loves it that in this law in the word he does meditate day and night so it's not just that he has the desire it's not just he has a passion for the word of God it's not just that it's this this Uh something's consuming him on the inside but he takes it further because he he takes this word and he lets it be lodged in his mind and in his thoughts if somebody says I'm meditating on this day and night as much as I can I'm going to meditate on his word that's somebody that's saying I want his word to not just invade my soul but I want his word to invade my thought life and I want to tell you that's deeper than just a desire in the soul that's why I titled this this morning victory in our thought life how many want a victory in your thought life that's this that's the secret place you can put on a lot of things at church but nobody knows what your thought life is only you and God and the devil can plant thoughts there he doesn't know the secrets of the thought secrets of her God does so it's you and God so so I can preach about this today but I don't know what your thought life is now I can watch your life and there's enough evidence to show what you think about most is going to come out it's gonna you know it's like it's here and and then it comes and it spills out of your mouth eventually so you can tell what people are thinking because the Bible says whatsoever a man thinketh in his heart so is he and so you'll see eventually but really nobody knows what you're thinking even right now maybe you're thinking of lunch already but I want to tell you put that out of your mind because this is your true lunch first this has to be your lunch I mean he's glad to be at lunch today amen we're glad you made the trip but we got to get into it a little bit we say Lord feed me feed me feed me feed me in my soul so now this fella he's he's getting it lodged in his mind he he lives a life that he has to switch out his thoughts always back to the word he meditates day and night so he he if he's a human being he has other thoughts he has wrong thoughts he has a lot of things hitting him but he has learned that he must meditate in the word because he has to live a life of switching out wrong thoughts and replacing it with the word and that's why I read to you bringing every thought captive into captivity bring every thought into captivity every thought not just letting other ones go through can you say Amen not just letting all the other things just and some of them just slept through because they're not going to be scanned you know let me just say this um so the children maybe will understand all of us understand better after 9-1-1 our country changed and all the rules changed it changed everything can you say man and to elaborate on it it's because that all of a sudden now we thought we were safe and we thought we were okay but an enemy snuck in without us knowing it through our borders and we didn't know that it snuck in it snuck in with guns and actually stayed here for many years within the state Among Us and getting trained in in a in Pilot School without our own country all this happened and we did not know that it slipped in with a plan to not just be in our country there's a plan to do what it planned to do and all you know what it is if your children don't know they come they train to be pilots and then on 9-1-1 they they took over the pilot in three airplanes and one of them was the plan was and listen friends Satan has a plan Satan has a plan when he gives you the wrong thoughts it's not just the thought he has a plan he's a planner can you say mine that's why you have to be a planner so when these things come and he slips in they had a plan and that was to learn to be a pilot so they would take over the plane and redirect one plane into the Twin Towers in New York redirect another plane into the Pentagon and then plans to redirect the third plane they think into the White House and destroy the White House that one didn't make it but look at the enemy's plan and look why it happened and after that day with however many people that died the country was torn apart how did this ending begin in but after that point everything had to change and our security level had to go up and in our airports and everywhere had to have scanners to scan everybody including me including you good people bad people has never done anything hard anything wrong their whole life every Everything has to be scanned we didn't have that before I could just walk into the airport and go to my plane not anymore now I got to take my belt off and my shoes off and I gotta lay everything up there take everything out of my pockets all this and every person has to do it can you say man why why did it happen because something slipped in I'm going to tell you about your Christian Life okay let me talk about your life okay I believe that every Christian every Christian will no doubt have a 911 that happens in their life you might have more than one if you don't learn your lesson in fact just so that our teenagers and our children can know how many would older ones that's been serving the lord how many has learned you've had a 911 in your life and what I mean by that is that the devil slipped in and gotcha and brought destruction because he slipped into something you wouldn't normally think he would have slipped in and how many raise your hands say it started in the thought life come on raise your hand appreciate you being honest so everybody's here has had a 911 and what it do it jolts you even as a Christian at Joe should say wait a minute I've got to put a higher Security in place okay so we go through these airports and we have uh things that we have to do and we have to run uh people everybody no matter how good looking they are no matter how nice a suit they have on no matter how great a song leader he is how many thinks he's a good song leader [Applause] no matter how good-looking he is taken from his dad trying to put a good word for you bud no matter the high standard that he lives in the Christian Life he lives no matter what when he comes to that airport he gets scanned like everybody else you understand and so now so Gideon let's let's pretend now that this is from here you're gonna walk up here and you're going to walk through a scanner we're going to check you out and I want everybody to associate this stuff if there's something notice now we don't know what he has on him so we have even though he says he's a good guy we have to check and see if he has anything on him because usually the devil's hiding something to slip through the security everybody listen typing what what I'm saying here this morning so now we need a security guard Solomon you come and I want you to help me scan this fellow because he's trying to come in he looks like a good guy and everything has to go out okay take your phone okay so everything looks good take your jacket off all right everything is confiscated so now as you walk up here okay A lot of times what happens as you walk up here you come through this scanner and it could be beep beep beep beep beep beep would you step back down there please all right check them out because there's something wrong there's something he's trying to get through quote something what do you have anything in your pocket yeah that's what it is issues all right keys what's that let me see that okay and if we're talking about a thought sneaking through I'm going to call this the devil says the days of Miracles are past that thought doesn't come from God what are you doing with this and what are you trying to get over that thought doesn't belong in God and so we'll confiscate that and I can't believe you're trying to get through the kingdom of God with that thought in your mind come and try it again what is it what is it now check it now what is that what does he have anything else there what what is this mechanism this is a thought that says you're Unworthy of the kingdom of God you've done things to feel unworthy that's a thought that didn't come from God and it can't make it through this scanner one more time one more time okay beep beep what's this thought here huh you have anything else in here pockets never mind don't do that what's this thought here this thought is bad movies don't affect me as a Christian it only affects other people I can watch this I can listen to it and it doesn't affect me now Solomon and Gideon and I could go on with this all day long but I want an illustration to show you the Bible says bringing every thought into captivity you have to have a scanner on your thought life if it's not of God it stops right there and it gets dumped out so now this brother his thinking is directed his thought life is checked it's it's and then the Bible says he has to meditate it on it on the word day and night so not only does he kick out wrong thought thoughts but he replaces them with the thoughts of God are you doing that day and night I want to put something in my mind I want to be filling my mind this is how you work as a human being this is how God created you can you say amen and the devil's more aware of how your thought life influences you he's more aware than human beings we got millions if not billions of human beings on the face of the Earth that feed on things and they don't realize the power of the mind and the power of their thought life we have murderers in in jail can you say amen and it's because they didn't understand the principle of the power of a thought life and where it started is in the thought life nothing got checked can you say amen and so he focuses his mind on the word of God or on positive things and he dumps out and he scans the wrong thoughts that come through there are many things that this man may not be able to control in life things that happen to him things that other people did but he has control of what he thinks about and meditates on can you say amen and there can be a good fruit that comes from someone who replaces their thoughts with the word of God and with positive things this is significant in your life you have to know that your thought life every day is your domain to take under the control of the Holy Spirit and Satan does never ever belong there at all if you give him that territory he will take it but he needs to be scanned and checked at security every thought needs to be checked and I'm not talking about the person next to you I'm talking about you some of you are defeated in your life because you haven't learned the one principle that what you think about every day is really going to influence who you are and your actions and that can be worldly thoughts that can be dirty thoughts or that can be depressing thoughts or that can be lies of the enemy or that can be things that are contrary to the word of God it can be anything but if it's not of God then we don't have to think about it let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus Paul said forgetting those things which are behind it's not any more complicated than that the word gives you permission to forget those things are behind if it's under the blood which I believe with Believers it's under the blood I have confessed it it's done and Paul says forget all of it behind I give you permission a Believer can forget because God's forgiven and for God he can't remember it no more so you don't have to remember God has a sea of forgiveness you should have a sea of forgetfulness that you don't have to revisit a thought that's underneath the blood of Jesus Christ because we're not called to defeat my brother and sister we are not called to live in everyday life from defeat we are called to live in Victory [Applause] every one of you are called to live in victory over the enemy every day we may not do it every day but it's not because of God but we're called to live in Victory every day you're called to live in Victory every day especially over your thought life thank you for watching
