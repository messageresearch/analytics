the scripture together again appreciate all the musicians tonight and song leader leading us Welly you guys I was listening back in the office and you guys are going to sing us right into a Rapture tonight the way it's going on praise the Lord we'll revisit that song again at the end of the service probably and sing it a little bit but when when you've got everything before the Lord and all your hearts are clear it's freedom to worship there are no restrictions can you say Amen so that's the way we can live and uh I wanted to say a couple announcements before we uh get into the word tonight um the concert will be this Friday uh Joseph habedank and uh he's a wonderful singer also has a wonderful testimony about his the addiction that he had and come through it the Lord really helped him out of it uh I know you enjoy some of his songs and Sherry sponsoring that in the youth Hall in the back Sherry leontine sponsoring that concert and so you're welcome to partake that 7 o'clock on Friday night um we'll have him here and they take a free will offering for him so we appreciate him coming in and I think the songs will be a blessing to you I think even the young people would enjoy that however you want to do but we to announce it and the other thing I just want to say is marvelous is the works of the Lord don't ever think that God is not moving he is moving in Mighty ways and the devil would like us to think that he's not doing anything but there's I've had I've had so much response this week not about me but what the Lord is doing and he's doing Mighty things and we should just have a testimony service tonight God's moving in impossible situations God's moving in things uh there's been PE visitors that's been here too in the last couple Services theyve called and said we haven't felt the presence of the Lord like that in so many years and they just said God is present among you whatever you're doing keep doing what you're doing well I'm not doing anything I'm just letting him do what he needs to do but listen God is working and it's like the song says step into the water while the spirit's moving Step In The Water you don't want to miss out on what the Lord's doing and praying to him speaking to him and saying Lord let me be a part of the bride's Revival individually my myself let me be a part of it praise the Lord Genesis 15 uh if you allow me to continue on from Sunday a little bit we'll pick up Genesis 15 and the only scripture I'll read as we I read the whole the whole first part of the chapter uh but we just need to read this tonight and when the after Abraham uh got the sacrifice ready I tell you what let's just read 7 through 11 let's do that make sure we have it in our minds and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought the out of er of the chaes to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and young pigeon and he took unto them all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the sacrifice or the carcasses Abram drove them away amen father I just pray you'll bless your word tonight as we study your word train us teach us Lord fill us give us what we need for the journey we pray in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated God bless you tonight we'll be ministering this Sunday at brother Barry coffees brother Brandon will be speaking here at home so I know there sever a few on vacation and such but we'll have a service here and and I know the Lord will be speaking uh around the world to his people he's always faith faithful to his people so just pray for us while we're away just on Sunday there and preaching a couple services for brother Barry coffee in Hickory North Carolina I am so happy the Lord led me into this scripture Genesis 15 just a few months ago and then uh really is becoming more and more real to me um it's just a special thing that's just seems to be exploding for me as I studied again today and yesterday and just want to go into it just a little bit more while we have you here tonight and those that are listening online and uh we want to just go back into it and speak a little bit about this tonight this keeping the fowls away from our worship and our title this keeping the fouls off of our worship is what I'd like to title it and uh that's what we have to do and so it's God God is course coming to Abraham in this incident in Genesis 15 to reconfirm his promise that he gave him he's coming to confirm to him the the Covenant that he gave him the promise he gave him so it's reconfirming or confirming the Covenant that he has with Abraham and as you study it you realize this is not a covenant that is making a deal with Abraham that Abraham if you'll do this I'll do this this is an unconditional Covenant and you see God taking care of and doing it all and it's an unconditional it does it's not based upon the actions or performance of Abraham it's a different Covenant at the beginning God made a the adamic Covenant was he said you do this and and and this and this and so then man failed in that and we always fail when we're making deals with God man is always the one that fails you don't want to make a deal you don't want to want to be careful of promises that you make can you say amen I think promises are good but we want to make sure with God that in our human weakness sometimes we make a promise but the thing is I'm glad to be under an unconditional Covenant tonight with my God a covenant that says I have done it I have paved the way I have made the way for you and if you'll yield yourself to me I i' I've got this journey from your beginning all the way till the end I will finish it for you and so God is coming to Abraham to confirm this Covenant but he does it in a very strange way uh but as he does it it reveals so much about where we are at in the people of God right now because we're at the very end of the royal Seed of Abraham finishing up this journey Abraham began the journey and his Royal seed will finish the journey and if we're not the at the end I'm just crazy I don't understand we are at the end we are at the final generation uh and the final expression of the royal Seed of Abraham and I believe I'm preaching to some of those here tonight that's a pretty important time to be in and so when we go into the idea of Abram uh shwing these fowls away on Sunday we just begin to break into this idea of the sacrifice being there and Abram chewing off the fowls and keeping the foul birds away from the sacrifice God laid out a perfect sacrifice before him and uh and and he gave Abraham the specifics of a a perfect sacrifice that God would accept and and to and to lay Abraham to lay his life in worship before that it was a perfect sacrifice and it's in the end time that God actually reconfirms his promise to his elect again it's at the end time when God sends a prophet and he's reconfirming to his elect what he gave Abra abam at the beginning he's reconfirming it and speaking it again to the people and he's not only speaking it but he's showing himself present by signs and wonders and the sign of the son of man and the son of man manifested again by the discernment of Hearts he did it all to show the sons of Abraham I'm reconfirming that what I said to Abraham is now coming to pass God always does that with us God always doesn't leave us hanging every once in a while he visits in a special way to let you know I still love you my Covenant is still still there it's still hanging over your life I'm still going to fulfill it can you sayen you may not hear that every day if you stay in the word you'll hear it every day but you may not hear it every day but every once in a while aren't you glad could you raise your hand and every once in a while no matter how low you can feel and how how much the devil's beating you up God in his loving hand comes and reconfirms his love for you his Covenant for you I'm right I know where you're at right now I know what's going on and I'm going to finish my working you and that's what he did in the the last as a matter of fact uh Abraham got a visitation from MDC and uh then we find that was Jesus Christ being manifested there couldn't have been anybody else but Jesus Christ no beginning of days no ending of life he comes again several thousand years later in Jesus Christ in the flesh of Jesus but God gave us another visitation of MDC in the end time because it's the final stage of the royal Seed of Abraham and he got to visit with MDC and we get to visit him too you say well where is he at well open your ears he's been speaking to us amen yes sir amen he came and manifested in flesh he's still manifesting in the flesh of the Bride but it's a very unique thing I got a a new song on my uh project uh coming up coming out this Friday the brothers have been so good at getting it done for me and I got 12 songs there and one of them is here I am plugging my project on Wednesday night before every just no shame whatsoever but they're going to release uh 12 new songs here this Friday and uh one of them is who is this mzc because that mystery is so real to the bride that you realize who is this that's sitting Among Us who's speaking to us it's not just a man it's he himself and when you realize that and that's why when Abraham when he realized who he was sitting in front front of this mzc the king of Salem King theophany brother bradam when he realized that he praised and he worshiped God and he gave a tenth of all you didn't have to beg him for his tithes when he realized it was Christ there when it was he realized it was God sitting in front of him eating with him you didn't have to beg for his tithe or giving it just said I want to give because it's not a man I'm giv to it's Christ it's his kingdom and so these uh visitations and these covenants and these reconfirming covenants happened to AB Abraham and they happened to the Seed of Abraham at the end and one of the things that He blesses us with is a revelation of our perfect sacrifice and the atonement that he's given us um Abraham in his reconfirmation here God has him lay out these three animals and these the turtle dove and the pigeon and it all represents Christ it all represents something and I'm going to read it to you in a minute what it means it all means Christ but he lays out the perfect sacrifice he splits the three animals and he lays them a certain way and Abraham is standing in front of a perfect sacrifice now it's not a perfect atonement for his sins but before Calvary came it's the sacrifice that's God's going to accept now if you mess with that sacrifice you're tampering with God's perfect atonement and sacrifice but if you leave it alone that is going to be your answer you worship under that blood can you say amen and if you'll stay there and worship under that blood God's going to finish the the promise and so so we today we had a perfect sacrifice at Calvary but God comes and by Revelation shows us and reconfirms to us through the prophetic Ministry at the end what kind of perfect sacrifice we have we sang about it in the uh uh communion again and we we we Fellowship together Sunday night it was such a a special time together of testimonies and such a a a vulnerable the testimonies were just moved me to to hear people so honest and open and broken about where God had brought them from and what they were and what they are and it was just such a special time and we see then that as people of God come to the real uh reality of what the atonement has done for us and how perfect our sacrifice and how the the the worshipper doesn't have to be perfect but the sacrifice has to be perfect when we start learning that then we realize we release ourself in a rest and a worship to God like we've never had before and because because the atonement and sacrifice was messed up for 2,000 years by men's interpretations of Creeds and dogmas God had to come in the end time and speak through a prophet to reconfirm and tell us just how perfect our atonement really is that we can celebrate and worship under this atonement this perfect sacrifices sacrifice matter of fact uh one of the reasons the foolish virgin will have to go through tribulation is because she rejects the atonement in its fullness that's a heavy one of the reasons the foolish virgin will miss the Rapture and go through tribulation is because and I'm quoting from Brother random we they reject the atonement they don't reject Christ going to Calvary but they reject the atonement in its fullness that's right so the atonement has to mean something more than us just intellectually saying I believe Christ died for me at Calvary we have to tap in into the power of the atonement the Christ of the atonement what it did for us can you say amen and a lot of that was lost well how was it lost how was it lost by men teaching Creeds from the from the Catholic Church all the way through churches teaching Works instead of Grace messing with our atonement fouls coming down on a perfect sacrifice at Calvary and now you burn a candle now you confess to the the priest and from that all the way through to Pentecost until you have the last age true age true Pentecostal move but then Pentecostal Traditions turned it into Catholic says I'll go burn a candle I'll feel good about myself I burn a candle I feel righteous Pentecostal say if I just go down there and shout and dance a little bit with no life shout and dance they'll feel good about themselves it's the same works and I say that respectfully because I believe in those things as blessings of God I believe with all my heart people think I don't I believe in it because I do it myself but when you start putting that with your rest and peace that somehow you're accepted in the Beloved and you're accepted by God now you're talking works just like the Catholic church I spoke in tongues tonight so I must be righteous before God that doesn't mean you're righteous before God so all the way through the church has messed with the pure atonement the pure perfect sacrifice but but God speaks it purely again through his Prophet so that we can come to the right kind of worship the right kind of Freedom can you say Amen the right kind of Life In Christ that is dependent not on our works but upon the power of the atonement that's been what he's done for us at Calvary amen so a revelation of the perfect sacrifice and atonement has come back to us and they reject the atonement in its fullness so that means that means that I believe if they're rejecting something and that's how they missed the Rapture they believe there was an atonement but they reject the atonement in its fullness if you reject the Holy Ghost the true Holy Ghost you're rejecting the power of Calvary and the atonement in your life how many can say Amen you can't say well I believe Christ died for my sins and that's it and not take his Spirit into your life no that's the power that's the power of the atonement something poured out of Calvary his Spirit he took his body up up to heaven heaven but he he poured his Spirit out upon the people so there's a power in the atonement and the people of God come back to it in the end time and uh we see that to me it means that the atonement has been expressed to us in its fullness and has been been revealed to us and has been laid out to us as it was Abraham but all the fowls of Satan are still trying to confuse taint devour right during our time Satan's fowls are trying to mess with our atonement and when he does it contain our worship that our worship is not pure because he's tainted our sacrifice he's added to it he's taken away from it and that's a pretty uh when we add to something or we take away let's just talk about our sacrifice let's talk about what God did for us when we add to it or we take away from it that's a serious thing it's perfect when in itself is it not it's perfect when in itself and so the last scripture in the Bible says whoever takes one word of this out or adds one to that's the last warning you know what he's saying the last warning the last warning of the Bible must be pretty serious whoever takes out of this or puts in will have his name taken off the book of life that's pretty serious in other words he's saying don't touch this for 2,000 years denominations says has added to and taken away and he's saying to the bride don't touch it leave it alone believe it but don't touch it don't add to it don't add your Works to it don't take away from it don't loosen it up don't loosen up the gospel don't add to the gospel leave it alone and let it do its powerful work in your life keep it simple keep it uncomplicated oh how we need to hear that maybe even in our message ranks can you say Amen 2,000 years of church history that has messed with this and taken away from this Bible added to from this Bible and he's Sayang at the last few scriptures even all of us that are in the end time message leave it alone can I get an amen tonight leave it alone let God take it and put it in our lives the way he wants to don't try to interpret anything and I'm quoting there he says at the end of The Seven Seals he says now this is this is God's done something here but don't try to put any interpretation to what he's done just go and live a good Christian Life at the end of The Seven Seals did you know he said that same thing one of my daughters was saying last Saturday he said just take your Bible go go to church live a good solid Christian Life stay in the spirit of God and if God wants you to know anything he'll bring it to you and don't try to interpret what's taking place I wish a lot more preachers I'll go ahead and preach about preachers instead of you that's strange isn't it I wish a lot more preachers would have listen and would still listen to what he said pray preach the message don't add to it don't take away don't add to this Bible don't take away from it preach it in the power of the resurrection and let it do what it's going to do the third pole the seven seal all the let God interpret these things by bringing them to pass and I guarantee you he's doing it uh you better have your eyes open because he's doing he might do it under our noses right can you say Amen so leave leave it leave it alone so I understand so look at this that I'm so dis excited to discover this quote uh if you guys have it back there this quote came up uh today and and uh I didn't in all my studies last week I didn't know how he connected this uh Genesis 15 but we'll let the prophet connect it here and then we're going to get to some practical stuff at the end here do you have any quotes did anybody send you anything okay perfect and Abraham went and got the animals and he cut them in half and laid them so we're in 1962 here I believe it is 62 yes 1962 and uh Abraham went and got the animals and he cut them in half and laid them piece to piece but the turtle dove and and Dove did not separate the TR do and pigeon throtle Dove and pigeon is the same family so that represented Divine Healing which in both covenants is by faith you see that they're healed just one to the other other one if the old Covenant had Divine Healing in it how much more has the is this one got so he's saying the three animals that were used had to be cut because we realize that even at Calvary Christ was divided God took his body but he left his Spirit on the people so that when he brings it back together together it'll be one we'll be one with him so just like these three animals of the uh of the first three animals were divided and placed again beside one another on this sacrifice it all typed Christ all TY but he didn't divide the turtle doen pigeon because that's not something with the Old Testament the Old Testament was law but under grace he Calvary it's going to be a new covenant with the people so now turtle dove and pigeon is the same family so that represents Divine Healing which in both covenants is by faith see that they were healed how many knows that people were healed in the Old Testament so that that wasn't divided that same faith that would cause somebody to be healed by God in the Old Testament is in the New Testament as well God never got rid of that but but I like brother bram's point if the old Covenant had Divine Healing in it how much more has this Covenant got Divine Healing if God could heal non of his leprosy if God could heal in the Old Testament with a covenant that wasn't even a Calvary Covenant yet if God could heal diseases back then then he can heal diseases now how much more under this Covenant can God heal our bodies if he did that in the Old Testament the pigeon and the turtle do represent that praise the Lord I thought that was wonderful see if the old sacrifice had healing what about this one which is much better now but notice what he done here he took these three animals cut them apart laid them piece by piece and they did Abraham got back now that was the sacrifice and he watched until the sun was going down and fouls came down out of the air on Abraham's sacrifice vultures and Abraham cast them out shed them away what's this a type of Abraham's seed in the last day casting out Devils from the sacrifice now friends I didn't know that he had said that till today and that's what I preach Sunday it's a good confirmation I'm in the channel of the holy spirit cuz God led me and I felt I was on track but to hear it say just exactly how was brought out on Sunday that it's it's the it's the seed the Royal seed of the last casting out Devils from the sacrifice casting away from the sacrifice now think about that fouls trying to come on our perfect sacrifice and tainted that's right Demons of Doubt Demons of fear Demons of worldliness Demons of religion Demons of legalism legalistic all of it tries to come on and Tain this sacrifice but we have to stand and be sure of where we stand to sh the fouls off of this and say no no devil I don't want no unbelieving devil to come around I don't want any doubt in my mind my calling is to worship this perfect sacrifice and I'm going to Worship the Lord and what he did for me at Calvary is powerful enough to take me to the end it's powerful enough to heal my cancer it's powerful enough to give me the Holy Ghost it's powerful enough to send a Revival in my heart it's powerful enough and I don't want the devil to mess with it or give me doubts I'm just simply uncomplicated I'm believing it with all my heart somebody say Glory GL praise the Lord so now casting away from the sacrifice God promised it to sacrifice Christ the same yesterday today forever and all them unbelieving Spirits trying to devour it the man of God the Abraham seed stands there casting out the Devils away from it confirming the Covenant now the confirmation showing that Abraham's seed in I mean the loyal the Royal seed remember the natural seed failed because it accepted law instead of the word of Grace talking about the Jews they rejected Christ as a whole and they took their law instead so what did they do in that the natural Seed of Abraham failed and then he said so now so it is a roundabout in the Gentiles in the last day but there is a seed because you realize there's a church not the true church but a false church that once again turned down and failed and took Works instead of Grace 2,000 years of church history from the mother Church all the way through teaching the people and getting them to accept oh they accept Christ but they have a bunch of Works attached to it in order for you to gain entrance into heaven so the the the spiritual Seed of Abraham also had a failure in the sense they took law instead of Grace they took Church Creed instead of Grace instead of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and so then we find then he says but there's a seed a royal seed with the word stands true casting out Devils doing great signs and wonders getting all the unbelief away from the word this is powerful friends I'm one of them these signs shall follow them that believe casting out devils and by the way casting out Devils isn't always just in a service it's not always that and it's not just Devils of uh insane or Devils of nicotine or Devils sometimes it's Devils of gossip and sometimes it's Devils of sometimes bitterness and sometimes it's Devils of other things that we wouldn't think but whatever the fouls are coming around we're to cast them out Hallelujah signs and wonders getting all the unbelief away from the word can you imagine it's look at that getting all the unbelief that's our duty as Believers get the unbelief away from this word right I keep doing that because that's my visual I don't have any better visual tonight brother Stephen it's like just get the fowls get the unbelieving things away from this word leave this word alone I love the core of this message message in this word bringing us back to Bible faith I love it I love the word you say brother Paul how do you know you have the Holy Ghost what's the evidence the best evidence I know is I love the word and particularly the word for this age I have no resistance in my soul to not one word of this age and that's the greatest evidence I love it I that the amener says Amen to it I can't deny that sometimes my mind or my flesh resist yeah that's right I hear something he says something your flesh uh and that's because my flesh isn't born again right but it's coming under subjection but when I got the Holy Spirit 16 years old the amen is down here and I love this word I I literally love the word the present truth that he sent there is no resistance deep down inside there's nothing it's and I don't say that to boast I'm just I believe that's the evidence that you have something receiving the word of God for your a AG is the evidence of the Holy Ghost so keeping Theo he said keeping the uh doing keeping the unbelief away from the word keeping the sacrifice clean keeping the word holy keep it reverenced not put anything with it add anything to it just keeping it away standing on guard letting nothing touch it that is the Royal Seed of Abraham how going to raise your hand and say that's where I stand and that's what I'm having to do almost on a daily basis I might hear a lot on the internet I might have a lot of different ideas but God help me to be that Royal seed that's brushing those fowls away and keeping the word clean can you say Amen keeping it reverenced keeping our respect towards one another reverent keeping the love in the congregation the true love can you say amen and those demons come around and divide us and make us no no no let's let's say no let's not go that direction let's keep this thing holy let's keep it right can you say Amen let's keep this message pure and anything not putting anything with it adding anything to it it's just keeping it away standing on guard letting nothing touch it I can't say it any better than that right there it's powerful friends and he said that's the Royal Seed of Abraham do what she's doing at the end time blessed be the name of the Lord that is the Royal Seed of Abraham no wonder this Genesis 15 means so much to us as we see Abraham's actions of keeping the fowls off of the perfect sacrifice you know it's when we have the right thing before us and worshiping under the right thing is when we have the greatest forces trying to mix it trying to taint it trying to distract us away from it let me say it again it's when you have the right thing the right sacrifice the right word is when the devil's trying to fight so hard against it okay he's trying to taint it he when we have the right worship with the right sacrifice and it's and it's the the the sacrifice and the power of it the word is changing us and when it changes us then we get stimulation a revelation and we raise our hands in worship and we we're in freedom of worship I'm worshiping under the right thing the blood of Jesus Christ purely not anything added to it or taken it away no wonder Satan hates that and tries to taint worship and taint the sacrifice to mix it to taint it to take pieces of the word and splice it together or not read the rest of it or not get a balance of it or only use the parts that maybe endorse our background I say that respectfully but sometimes we only read the quotes that endorse our background whatever religion we come from whatever denomination we tend to lean towards those particular quotes and leave the other ones out I don't think we should do that I think we should take all of the word of God and not just use parts to endorse what we come from in our background that's a serious thing places the pro places the prophet says things we can take to two extremes and that is either formalism or fanaticism I'm only saying this because the prophet said it himself he said you can take it to two extremes he said you can take it to formalism and and intellectualism or the other extreme is fanaticism we can sway swing way too to intellectual or way to the emotional side but we want to be in the middle of the road we don't want to taint it we don't want to add anything from the past to it can you say Amen we should pray and keep it balanced and Cast Away influences to bind up our worship and to scare us and to pervert a pure atonement that he gave us to worship under that's right praise the Lord I like when people worship free and I don't mean that they can just be free as far as physically worshiping they're free down here they're free in their Spirit they're emotions have been delivered from the bondage of Satan that's why they can shout they can cry they can raise their hand there's nothing binding them because everything's Unbound in here can somebody give me an amen tonight it's not just you physically do it but something has set you free in your spirit something has set you free in your soul I know what a soul freedom feels like I'm not bound by religion I'm not bound by dos and don'ts but there's a rest there's a Sabbath in my soul I know where I stand with God and when I come before him if I have a mistake I bring it quickly under the the blood of Jesus Christ and go right back to raising my hands and worshiping God hallelujah blessed be his name now I I want to switch this around a little bit tonight there's so much more you could go into and just from that quote there's so much you can go into but I'm switch this to a little bit practical side because it's a Wednesday night and we're just going to switch this a little bit same subject but I came across a sermon by Spurgeon and I referred to it uh Spurgeon the Charles Spurgeon the prince of preachers and he he uh he takes this scripture Genesis 15 and verse 11 and he takes it uh uh quite uh in a more practical way and I just can't get by without bringing out some of his points from it to help us a little bit and the way he takes it is that he looks at the interruptions from our thought life that interrupt our worship how many knows that can take place it's kind of a good place to start let's start with our thoughts the part that nobody can see the part that you can hide from everybody you may have traveled tonight and taken several trips in the last 30 minutes while I've been preaching your mind could have exited here and went to many other things even while you're physically sitting in front of me saying amen every now and then because that's the power of your thoughts and I think it's important maybe to talk about this first because you can talk about all the other worship and all the other things but he says when we come to worship and he's particularly going to hone in on Sundays because 150 years ago that was the thing that's what you did on Sunday should come to worship so he really goes into the distractions in our mind to the fouls that come around to interrupt our worship even when we come in church and come to service he he really elaborates on the fouls that come in our minds and the thoughts and uh I'll tell you sometimes I hear Spurgeon say things 150 years ago and I'm saying wow the devil's still the same today we're still fighting the same devil he was dead on on some things and he's a real Pastor you can tell he's a real Pastor too cuz he's seen so much The Human Side of the people and yet pointing them to Christ all the time and and so now he takes interruptions in our thoughts into our worship especially when we're sitting in church and also not giving one day a week Sunday to undistracted worship that was a big deal it's a big deal to me today it's been a big deal for my wife and I in our home to it's our my Sabbath is not Sunday but there's something about setting aside the first day of week for worship exclusively for fellow ship exclusively and not business or not something else all right so he speaking on not giving one day a week Sunday uh giving it un giving it to undistracted worship and so I want to touch on what he says Spurgeon says and I just I'm going to bring out a few points of what he said about the different thoughts we can have and then we'll bring it to a close tonight we might use this text he said uh Genesis 15:11 everybody still with me he said we might use this text if we chose as a picture of the ease which with faith repels all attacks that are made upon Christ the fouls brushing them away from the sacrifice the great sacrifice of the New Covenant answorth tells us that the original word which we translate drove he drove them away has in it the force of puffed them away as if a a very puff of breath these Kites and vultures and Eagles were he uses Eagles were at Once Driven away from the bodies of the victims Faith knows how when skeptical kites when Blasphemous vultures when speculative speculative birds come down to attack the sacrifice of Christ knows how to chase them away but with a puff of her breath we know whom we have believed the Bible says let the Earth let the Earth shake our confidence in him cannot move he is to us as real as a person as always nay we might doubt our own existence but Jesus his power his love his Precious Blood his prevalent atonement we dare not doubt that one puff of the breath of prayer and questions and cavals are gone one puff of the breath of Holy Faith In Praise And every skeptical attack is scattered to the winds as far as we are concerned when these fouls come down upon the body of Christ like Abram by faith we puffed them away he drove them away but I do not intend to use this text with such an object this morning this one of his morning sermons 150 years ago I do not intend to use this text with such an object this morning though one might legitimately do so it seems to me to represent to us our duty when distracting thoughts invade the sanctity of our holy worship here's Abraham he has killed the victims according to the divine order he has laid them in their places according to the heavenly rule he is waiting until God shall over these victims make and ratify the Covenant but meanwhile the buzzards the kites the vultures sent the B sense the body from afar and hastened to Devour the Flesh of the bolock and the ram Abram chases them away that is so his sacrifice may not be spoiled and he may have real fellowship with God brothers and sisters we never attempt to worship god without finding some difficulties in the way now you some of you have been serving the lord many years how many you raise your hand I can agree with Charles Spurgeon tonight we never attempt to worship God remember worship is not just a church lifting our hands worship is our life towards him every day and so so now we never attempt to worship god without finding some difficulties in the way and he quotes a poem that says what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat now you can be coming to any other thing but when you begin to come to the real mercy seat with the power of atonement coming back on your life hindrances get in the way thoughts get in the way Satan gets in the way seen young people just so close to coming to a Brokenness to to cross the sound Berry and come into Christ and they get bombarded with all kinds of things yeah some boy or girl comes along or some thing of the world that they're feeding on comes along some new thing and they were just on the verge of crossing the sound barrier and Satan interrupts at all of it because why they were setting their eyes and their heart towards The Mercy Seat what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat we and our assemblies are like angels in theirs when the sons of God came together Satan came also with with them how many knows that in the days of job when the sons of God presented themselves Satan was there too so sons of God when they come to present themselves Before the Throne of God Satan comes that's a scriptural uh scriptural truth we find that where what wherever we may be and in whatever frame of heart and with whatever earnestness we may attempt to worship God there is a servant with us who must be told to stop at the foot of the mountain while we go and worship God Yonder on the Mountaintop or else our offerings will not be profitable to ourselves nor acceptable to God now how important is our worship before the Lord and how important is our sacrifice that he's revealed to us in this hour how important are those two things it's everything our worship is our life before this sacrifice God gave us and this word that power that comes from the word the two most important things in your life young person parents the most important things you set before your children is what Christ has done for us can you say amen and our lives are a worship unto him because of it our lives are a worship the priority it's above any other thing but you're going to have a battle because you start to set your heart towards the mercy seat and your children's Hearts you're going to have the devil will bringing some fowls that you have to sh away but Spurgeon says it's our thoughts Spurgeon says if you guys pull up that and here's the thing he getes from Charles Spurgeon I'm going to read some of what he said and I'm going to encourage you to go read it because I can't read all the paragraphs under it it's a full sermon it's tremendous stuff but here's what he says the types of thoughts that invade our worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts anxious thoughts annoying thoughts ecclesiastical thoughts I don't know uh you can't sit here and say oh he's from 150 years ago how many can raise your hand and say yeah he's got some truth here to what he's saying of what interrupts our worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts anxious thoughts annoying thoughts ecclesiastical thoughts and so the first are wicked thoughts the Sons of Satan the wicked thoughts are the Sons of Satan these respect no sacred places the sanctity of our closet has been violated with thoughts of lust the Dignity of The Mercy Seat has n sufficed to rep repress the vile insinuations of blasphemy wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart of the believer yet seeketh to find a lodging there did you notice how sound that Doctrine is wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart that's what I just preached you the desire for sin is burned out by the power of Calvary and the Holy Ghost so there's no more desire for sin on the sole level wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart of the believer yet seeketh to find lodging there and well do it affect its purpose at times for it terth like a wafering man for a night lingering there sufficiently long to Mar our devotion and to prevent our having joy in fellowship with God Wicked lustful thoughts today someone saidh in the world was did you have to meet with the men and just talk about the word on sexual temptation is there something wrong in the church you have to do that and I just kind of chuckled I said yeah my church is the only church that has issues with that in the entire message yeah right it's so funny sometimes no I'm on a I'm on a campaign with the word of God a Counterattack with the Holy Ghost to help our men become men and overcome The Temptations of this age and that's just simply it but Wicked thoughts can invade us the most vile thoughts can invade a Godly Man especially when he's trying to worship he's trying to do something right he's trying to get into the word of God and wicked lustful demonic thoughts even to a woman can come to her and it's like how can they have the ocity to invade sets a sacred places I'm trying to come into they don't care they're going to invade it Charles Spurgeon is dead on Wicked lustful thoughts can invade your mind to stop your stop your pure Worship in the Lord can can you say Amen then he says worldly thoughts in company with these foul vultures these things called worldly thoughts which spring from the force of habit the wheels have been running the last six days in this direction and history gets into the seventh day the first day excuse me the last six days the wheels have been running the last six days in this direction it is not quite so easy to reverse the action and to make them go the other way we have been sinking sinking sinking in the myy clay of Daily Business it is not very easy for the soul that lies cleaving to the dust to rise at once towards heaven on Sunday it is no wonder when you have so many things to think of in this age of competition 150 years ago the age of competition it is no wonder when you have so many things to think of in this age of competition that The Ledger should lie there in front of the Pew instead of the Bible and that at times the daybook should come in when your hand holds the himym book or that you should be thinking of a bad debt or of a long account which is rather precarious instead of meditating upon the faithfulness of God of the pardons bought with the blood of Jesus Christ you're thinking about business life you're letting those thoughts invade the worship that is around the greatest thing in the world and that's the atonement for your life you gave yourself permission to by be diverted by what he calls worldly thoughts and I agree with them business thoughts life thoughts the cares praise the Lord these tra tra tra these traffickers molest the very Temple and we have not always the scorge of small cords to drive them out or the commanding presence of the Savior to say take these things hence it is written my house shall be called a House of Prayer but ye have made it a den of Thieves oh that we would be that way like Jesus putting those cords together and driving the money changers out of the temp temple and saying wait a minute get out of here this is a house of prayer this isn't a house of business praise the Lord oh it's convicting to me for sure and it's not just for Sundays we can't let business dominate our minds and thoughts all the time true but especially Sundays and how many other how many a mother comes here here with all her tribe of children on her shoulders it's 150 years ago how many a father comes here with thoughts of where he shall Apprentice his eldest son 150 years ago how many fathers come into the assembly into church 150 years ago and their thoughts are turned towards how I'm going to mentor and how I'm going to take this appren and make his life better or what shall become of his younger daughter I've had those thoughts that's all while you're in church yeah Eternal things temporal things and if you were listening to the word he might give you some answers how to Mentor that son he might give you some Word answers but when you're dominated to figure it all out in your mind yourself you're being distractor from worship besides Wicked and worldly thoughts and I'm I'm encouraging you I'm not hiding this go read the whole sermon because he's not done there he brings it out and I'm going wow this is amazing for him to say it this direct it's so true about us letting our thoughts life invade our worship not only at church but other times but he's talking about at church besides Wicked and morly thoughts another set of ravens would be croaking over us I mean anxious thoughts which are the fruits of our unbelief oh saith One how can I help it how can I help it how can I help these anxious worrisome thoughts if you knew my condition in business you would not Marvel that I that care or worry would come in today loss after loss continually going backward though with energy and perseverance I seek to make progress you don't know how I feel I've got justification for these worrisome thoughts if you knew the condition of my business right now everybody don't forget that this isn't Paul Le fonting saying this this is CH spur if you knew the condition in my business you would not Marvel that worry would come in a today loss after loss continually going backward though with energy and perseverance I'm doing my best I seek to make progress a large family a once extensive connection the constant fear of ruin the constant fear of Ruin it's all going to fall apart how can I hope to chase away anxious thoughts and carking cares of the day of rest how can I hope to do that how can I chase him away my brother I make many excuses for you but while I make all excuses let me remind you that it is written casting all your cares upon Him that means worries for he carth for you at least today there is no need that you should carry that burden he's talking about Sunday can there be one day a week at least that you you don't carry that burden can there be one day out of seven way out of balance if we can't get at least one day to it sometimes in our prayers and in our Sabbath worship we shall be disturbed by those carryon crows called annoying thoughts The Offspring of our vanity I will just mention some of them that you will that you will think perhaps rather odd but I have no doubt you know them we have known sometimes a sister come to worship and she notices why is Mrs so and so is why Mrs Sono is dressed differently from what she was in last Sunday and she had a new Bonnet the Sunday before Oh silly soul to be allured like a butterfly with colors and flowers you think I'm a hard preacher then look at Yonder at the brother and you're looking over at a brother saying there is so and so sitting in the opposite gallery that he did not want to see today at any rate for he does not like that man and he feels that his very presence is a detriment and a drawback to the Poss possibility of devotion so he sits on the other side or perhaps my brethren as you came in there was some little mistake at the door or when our friend got to the Pew he found it occupied by somebody else that's my seat or he is not occupying just the door seat where he likes to sit or perhaps he's standing in An Inconvenient place I wish they would be quiet so I could listen I wish they would settle down sit down so I could see the preacher well maybe you need to stand up and see the preacher you know we're chuckling at this stuff and it's 150 years ago but I'm saying he's dead on because our thoughts can invade our freedom of worship sometimes I say I wish on one Sunday God could gather all the thoughts that all of you thought and me too and the next Sunday that would be the sermon we get them all thrown up on the screen wow what a revealing time and I'm sure we're all self rightous saying I can't believe he was thinking that in here she didn't like my dress well I'll tell you I'm right in style I set the patterns in this church oh boy what if we had all of them up and we took our little vacations and our little visits outside of service I think he has a valid point here tonight I'm going to get ready to close but I didn't want to pass this practical advice to us okay apply what Abraham did to the sacrifice and apply it to your thoughts nothing should be able to invade our freedom of worshiping God especially when we come here I do my part to keep this place Sanctified this building set aside no other events going on in here keep it quiet you can come here anytime and pray throughout the day we if the door is not open we'll get it open for you this is a place set aside for him if we do that then when you come how about a prar a preparation in your heart to say I'm going to give my full mind and attention to what God's going to do in this place let me finish this he says he says uh I will mention the brood of fowls which will haunt Mount Zion I mean in the last one is ecclesiastical thoughts so what do I mean by these why that sometimes when our minds should be perfectly free from work for worshiping God Church business perhaps Church differences thrust them themselves upon us the Deacon thinks he may worry himself a little about something that has occurred with the poor the Elder thinks it would be a justifiable to be thinking over the case of such and such uh a refractory individual who case has troubled him the member thinks he may be fretting about the dullness of the ministry the minister thinks he may be groaning because some in the galleries have not joined the church and and and mark all these are good things in their places but they have no business at all with us when we come to God's house to worship him then these birds even though they they uh then these birds even though they like The Sparrows that build under the ease of the altar must be driven away for until we can get rid of all we shall not find the day of rest such as it should be nor will our worship be acceptable Before the Throne of God nor our own Souls derive The Joy they ought to have from the service and the presence of the Lord this may be simple tonight Charles spurgeon's points may be simp simple and practical but they are right how about we start with our own thoughts when we talk about brushing away the fouls off the sacrifice how about we start with our own thoughts getting in the way of our worship in the way of our Sundays in the way of our victory in the way of our freedom to worship I'll close on this scripture casting down imagination that's right come brother Kenny we're going to sing freedom and worship cast ing down imagination in every High thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of God where's that at brother Paul want don't you to go find it tonight it's your homework amen casting down imagination and every High thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of God bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ hey we're called to cast out Devils we got to keep the table clean we got to leave the atonement alone can you say Amen we got to leave the message alone don't add to it don't take away from it because the message and the atonement the power of what God done is what frees us up can you say amen and so we have to cast out thoughts how many believe you got to cast out thoughts of the past that's one of the files that come on this sacrifice to remind you what You' done but we got to cast that away and say Lord I've been forgiven that you've forgiven me so when his thoughts come back around Satan's defeat it say no no no no I'm going to worship God freely he has Set Me Free freedom to worship freedom to praise when we've Cast Away these thoughts that are not of him amen can we stand and pray before we sing this precious Lord we are spoken to tonight by the word by your prophet of our age by a great minister of God Charles Spurgeon and Lord if he was able to express it that way way back then we know today that Satan fights our thoughts and fights our worship to taint our worship today more than ever we who are privileged to have the revelation of the atonement restored back to us like never before for we are a privileged to enjoy the word of God as we do to enjoy Lord the coming through the the mouthpiece that you have set for this generation and be able to look our at our Bibles and Bible faith without any veils on it without any tainted this on it without having to bring it through the filter of a denominational Creed we who hold the precious word of God and the pure atonement sacrifice of Christ help us Lord not to see it tainted or divided or Lord to be messed up or confused or complicated help me as a minister Lord to preach such a powerful word that the people would be able to worship freely under the true opes of the word of God that's my desire Lord and I pray you'll Grant it in these Hearts if there's thoughts that invade them if there's thoughts of business thoughts of worldliness lustful thoughts if there's thoughts of the past oh God may they raise their hands tonight say I have been set free of all of my past and I forget those things which are behind me and I press toward the mark of the high
