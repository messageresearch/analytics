Brother Look Up

Lyrics:
We’re living in the last days
Jesus said what would be
Signs above, distress and perplexity
And hearts failing for fear
Seeing what’s coming down
That’s when we set our eyes on Him
And stop looking around

Brother Look up, lift up your head
Your redemption is just ahead
Get ready for that grand reunion 
Like He said
Sister look up, lift up your head
Don't be looking at the fear and dread
When it’s all coming down
Brother look up and lift up your head

The days are numbered for sure
To a world full of sin
But for the sons and daughters of God
This is not the end
It’s not a time to despair, it’s not a time to weep
It’s time to set our eagle wings
For the final sweep

Brother Look Up, Brother Look Up
Sister Look Up, Sister Look Up
Look Up 4x
