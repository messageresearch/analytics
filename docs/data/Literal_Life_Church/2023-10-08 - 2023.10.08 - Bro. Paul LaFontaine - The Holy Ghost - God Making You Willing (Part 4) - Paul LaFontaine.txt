can testify now how about you ah Lord bless you there's certainly a spirit of Liberty today I can feel I enjoy the specials theyve they were wonderful listen we have uh a couple of really neat testimonies today this is from the Ben White family we're overwhelmed by the doctor's report that we got this week of two ters one is down 90% in size and down almost 80% in activity and the other showed no activity and was significantly smaller in size amen yes [Music] Lord and they say we are watching a miracle take place and I'm sure there are other needs and we're watching Miracles take place there too somebody wrote in and said uh Rejoice with Elizabeth Murphy she received good reports this week [Applause] amen [Applause] and please this is from rap uh please pray for Sophie at home sick today I think Lenny is uh got a cold and also for Elizabeth who fell on her tailbone last week and it's quite painful uh please remember Eden cornette home with pink eye this morning and a with Ashley and Ashley who's had very little sleep so we've all been there who has an unspoken request and who has a a future testimony amen I do too let's pray as I lose my voice Lord we do thank you so much for your blessings and these testimonies it's so encouraging and we claim these testimonies for each of these requests in the name of Jesus we claim these testimonies for each of these hands seen today and each of the needs noted with the streaming audience we thank you in the name of Jesus for answering in Jesus name so we'll do the offering now and uh then you can be seated but uh we've got a missions report also which will bring up and this from LA and it was by way of uh you know brother John went there brother Paul went there several weeks ago and the Brethren are just so on fire and so he sent just photos and so we won't I don't know a lot of explanation of the photos but you'll see a couple of uh of videos at the end and uh you can see how bad the roads I'm not sure if that video got included but they're so bad that you can't even get the motorcycles uphill go ahead and I guess I have it here actually we'll see so this is uh buun and a couple of the other brothers that are ministering you can see they're they're hiking out to areas to to minister there you go and this is in somebody's house where they're witnessing uh you can see there that you dirt floors and poverty compared to us y'all can y'all can be seated there again we have so much to be thankful for and the Brethren have uh 25 or 30 books I suppose so they're Distributing those we have Bibles and that's a the need I expect it to be growing since we have more evangelists out there's one of the brothers witnessing to another another person in their home uh a small Church there that you has got Plank Floors same there you can see it's all very casual everybody's poor there's a sister there who I don't we didn't get the baptism photo but she's going to be baptized there's brother bojun on the left and we'll see another baptism photo that is a flowing river and the guy on the right is actually kind of a uh he's going to catch the person just in case there they are witnessing I think the only light was The Flash and brother Zing xong asked for a a color printer so he could print his covers in color to make the books much nicer so that's his color printer along with the ink and uh and the extra papers we got them and there's the brethren at their monthly meeting they do this every month and you've seen the the motorcyclist we send Three Brothers $50 a month and that pays for their gasoline expenses and we said brother chuku it's hard for me to remember the names and they have monthly meetings we send him $100 and that pays for really he helps with the gasoline expenses for the Brethren that come and they have teaching every month on the on the message as well as you know the restored word there they are at the same meetings baptism there you go same thing and this is we'll go to Malawi here we built four put four rofs on four churches in the past quarter and brother Alfred was pointing out that this church wasn't tall enough so he had him put another three rows on top so the roof is higher so the heat can escape better so there's malali Church your missions dollars at work and most of these churches in Malawi they're no longer allowing the churches to meet in schools and so this is forcing them out and they build the walls and this is kakomi church malap Pella church and block 11 Church number four so uh they are very very grateful because if they're not don't can't do in the school rooms they you know they they have their own church building so thank you very [Music] much is this the video okay so we're going to play this video here volume [Music] [Applause] [Music] up there you go they're young so they they're having fun too I guess you see the jungles in each side I mean it's very poor roads next video okay play this [Music] one so you know he's spotting for her just in case I think that might be it amen that's it it amen okay that's fine and uh missionary update a couple of weeks ago and I didn't bring the didn't put it up on the PowerPoint but his church is growing and he's had a immigrants in the church who are working part-time in Israel sing money back and he's been teaching on the family how it's necessary for the fathers to be home with the family so he's had the immigrants leave and go back to be with their families which is a good thing which sounds counterproductive for them but for the church but for now it's almost all Israelis at his church and uh you he's he's been there six years and now he's ministering in Hebrew about 50% of the time uh two Services a week they've moved recently couple several months ago and their church is too small already so they need a bigger facility so these were just needs of brother Colin uh Hebrew trans translator to translate the books into Hebrew and he's been ministering two to three services a week for six years and he has three children under four and uh he could use some help so uh and he's right he has been teaching English which has worked out well but he'd like more flexibility so he can make his own schedule and Minister more and he's starting a new business uh I think it's real estate so just pray that the business will be successful the goal is to give him more freedom in his uh in his ministry so thank you so much for your prayers and each each of these videos and uh brother Colin is a result of your faithful giving and prayers God bless [Applause] you are we G support2 2200 a month okay so I'm going to piggyback off of brother Jim speaking about brother Colin because we've been keeping track of uh last night late and also this morning the conditions and Israel that changed in 24 the last 24 hours and so we're we're actually how many's glad that brother Jim gives us a window into what we're doing here and I would just ask you you know so I don't forget to say it be mindful and prayerful of what we're doing as a church and be a part of it whether it's 20 bucks a month or you know 20,000 a month whatever but let's let's try to be prayerful what we can give to because God is blessing uh what we're doing and we like to look at what God is blessing so the few countries we're trying to support brother Jim is working and God has prospered at and You' like to stick with what God I excuse me for bringing my phone into the church we we're not supposed to do that but I just wanted to read right from his uh WhatsApp from last night in this morning so you have an idea he lives a little bit north of Tel Aviv and of course the the war has started now um they've declared war Israel has declared war officially the defense minister since the terrorist attacks uh yesterday yesterday morning and so the whole country now is in a bit of a lockdown and they're encouraging families I I have one text here that he they're having them stay in their homes to be safe with their children all over the country of Israel so everything's changed uh since this and this war will no out last a long time and so those who are spiritual and know the scripture we know that these things are to mount up uh Trump said yesterday not to quote Donald Trump but uh he said you know this is this is inevitable and he says it's just puts us one step closer to World War I well he's he's right because we know we're headed in that direction our Prophet said that he says the world cannot stand another birth pain before she gives birth to another another world and so but this is where it's mounting up to with with this war especially when you have the potential of what could happen in this particular area and we know scripturally that all that surround Israel will come against Israel and they're not just for they try to make peace and they say they make peace but their laws and their beliefs say the annihilation of Israel annihilation of Israel and I just want to say that I was burdened last night till late in contact with brother Colin and praying how many believes that we need to pray for Israel the nation of Israel we need to pray for the police the the Peace of Jerusalem because why does it always say to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem because there there's never been real peace in Jerusalem and there won't be until God comes and sets it up himself but until that time they're going to have a lot of turmoil and more increased all the time but when I think of the annihilation of the devil trying to annihilate uh God's people the Jews the the same devil this is what also I was burden for last night and I'm already preaching here but the same devil attacks the Believers of the the word every day and he's not just to make peace with you and just to get you to to loosen up a littleit he's out for your Annihilation spiritually that's his agenda for your life so be aware that whatever Israel is fighting now in the natural you're fighting it every day in your mind and the devil Don't Play With the Devil don't mess with him because he's out for your annihilation and uh I feel it's funny how you stay in prayer for the attacks against yourself and the attacks against your ministry when you stand for this message you're going to be attacked and it's interesting to be burdened about that even attacked internally from the enemy um it's interesting to see what happens with Israel now but he said uh when I asked him last night at the moment we are home quietly and so far safe it is very tense right now in the country a lot of fear and unknown the whole nation is in shock and aware that we are entering in an extended conflict I live near the air base and the planes are non-stop tanks lining Road six on the way to Gaza there are over 50 Israelis well that's changed now because it's about 600 murdered now 600 Israelis murdered and a 100 that's taken hostage lots of women and children and elderly people never have we seen something like this the infiltrators are spreading through the country we met on Zoom yesterday that's how they had service appreciate all the prayer only the Lord Jesus can protect and stop it from progressing at the moment all the Believers are okay thanks so much for checking on us and he sent me a couple of videos this morning he said thank you so much the reality on the ground is much worse than the news showing so we appreciate the prayer if I have any updates I will send them to you and so I think we need to be in special prayer for brother Colin his family his church that gathers uh some Filipinos some Russians and also many Israelis now trying to gather this will probably stop their gathering together I don't know but let's pray be in support of them not only financially but also let's be in support of them in our prayers how many will commit to that and we'll just go to prayer in a minute with for that in in in that need amen so be mindful of the our missions that we're dedicated to here at the church in your giving and I want to say also we have needs here at the church that we presented to you I want to say thank you those who are continually given to the HVAC project um and so you have given as of the 1 of October 27,1 127 so uh that makes us only 23,000 away from finishing all the updates with the HVAC so thank you for giving whether it's big or little it doesn't matter it's still uh putting chunks on that and so we've raised 27,000 we need another 23,000 so God be with you in your giving with that as well as as well as the missions praise the Lord wanted to say happy birthday to my daughter-in-law Lily who's a very special daughter-in-law I appreciate her she's a sweet girl loves the Lord God bless you Happy Birthday amen do you love the Lord today the little business coming from Brother Tom the sports director parents and young people please note that the youth Hall which is the back hall is not a gym no ball games of any kind are to be played in that room as of today we' removed the balls from the back room one of the main reasons I told him yesterday is there's a fireplace that's going in there and you can see it going up brother Henry's helping has put that in we would like to make that an area for Fellowship around that for youth meetings and also if the adults want to Fellowship back there eventually we'll have that done and we don't want any balls in that room being played anymore so we're changing that today you can go outside or outside or the fellowship hall uh when it is available those other two places are are to be used for activities or you can go outside as the weather permits so if you would do that we're going to make that change now that we don't want any balls in there we have equipment and the fireplace and different things and we like to like to shift it to an area where we have fellowship and then the children can play other places also having a little issue with uh people leaving food at the end of the day so we'd appreciate it if you take all your food with you and all your pots and pans and especially the tables when you leave a table we want you to stay in Fellowship but even if you leave and go for food and come back or something or come back in the evening make sure you clean your table and get something to wash it off uh clean it off we'd certainly appreciate that and pick up after yourself most people are doing it some are leaving things and so we just want to remind you to stay up with that as well we'd certainly appreciate it amen so you know I don't want to wear my voice out for just the announcements I appreciate your prayers and today's service will go as long as my voice will go but he has healed me and restored it and I'm on the men and I just felt so burdened to preach this morning we'll try to get it out and uh but then we can always have Wednesday to finish it up praise the Lord God is good amen God is good all the time we appreciate him just want to make sure that I had all of these uh announcements uh made if you wouldn't mind standing again and we'll just pray for Israel and also brother Colin fiser and that God will richly protect them and bless them in this time amen let's just go to prayer together Heavenly Father Lord we're grateful still today to live in a safe country we feel it's still very safe compared to other places and Lord first we want to pray for your People Israel in their Nation Lord and surrounded and we know the scripture proclaims that they will be continually surrounded lord and there will be a change in the prophetic things that you've said and Lord things will shift from the bride that you've been been molding and she'll be raptured and then the the emphasis will shift to your people to bring them a Revival Lord and and and maybe we're a part of a little bit a little bit of that starting Lord with supporting our brother preaching the message and preaching the gospel to the Jews there we don't know all that you're doing but we want to be a part of it Lord and we ask you just to be with brother Colin and his wife and children and all of the Believers Lord the Filipino Believers there the Russian Believers and the and the and the Israel people coming in and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ even some young people that are Jews coming to the Lord and receiving Christ oh God we just rejoice in this father we're thankful for what you're doing and Lord you one day you turned from the Jews and turned to us the Gentiles and you shifted Lord that dispensation and we're thankful you did we're thankful that we're we had a chance to be saved this morning God now you'll shift Lord from the Gentiles to the Jews and Lord I just pray you'll bless them and there might be a lot of hardships and deaths coming father a lot of Bloodshed but Lord we pray that you'll protect your people and you you will be the defense Lord when the defense ministers and armies Lord can't do it we know you'll stand behind them Lord because they are your people Lord feeling burdened till late last night to realize that the same enemy that wants to see their Annihilation Lord our brothers and sisters the Jews Lord also wants to see the annihilation spiritually of every believer who stands for this word to come against the prophet of God to come against the message to come against the the reality of Christ and the Holy Ghost oh God give us stamina and strength today in your word I pray and I pray you'll send the Holy Spirit through this building this morning and anyone that's not baptized with the Holy Ghost I pray father you'll move their heart father for this the last seconds of time May everyone receive you Lord and not delay another day that they could receive Christ in their heart and be filled with the spirit my God we need your strength in this hour and Lord I pray that you give us a voice to speak your precious word today and bless and feed the sheep feed the people we pray as we commit this service holy to you in Jesus name amen praise the Lord exod excuse me Ezekiel chapter 336 if you go there with me today and we want to pick up the word of God here from last Sunday Ezekiel chapter 33 we welcome all of our visitors today who's come and in our congregation we welcome you and just pray the Lord will bless you for visiting God be with you each one and uh we know that there's a reality of the Lord in our midst and if you haven't felt his presence yet I believe everyone would feel the presence of the Lord and know that he's near and that's something Beyond man that's him showing up and he's able to do all things even the impossible things praise the Lord Ezekiel 36 and starting at verse 24 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all of your filthiness and from all of your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do them ye shall dwell in the land that I gave your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I will also save you from all your uncleanness and I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and I will multiply the fruit of the tree I don't know if any of you are sitting there saying this is for me this morning but you ought to take this promise for you individually and say whatever he said he's going to do and I receive it I will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loath yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities for you and for your Abominations not for your sakes do I this sayith the Lord God be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways oh House of Israel thus sayth the Lord God in the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the Wast shall be builded and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight uh of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the Garden of Eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced are inhabited did anybody catch after he does all of this to Israel then it doesn't stop he said I'll restore you back back to what it was at Eden again I'll restore it completely back to Eden again I tell you you're under a restoration that doesn't go halfway this is significant today because it doesn't look like Israel is heading in a good place there physically but this is God's promise right here and someday the desolate place place will come back like a Garden of Eden again for God's people apply this to yourself and we say thank God that you're doing this work in my life amen may God ask the blessings to his word God bless you this morning now last Sunday uh or the last service that we were speaking we left off with the first reference to the holy ghost in the Old Testament the first main reference and that was in Isaiah 28 where it says for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there's no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall you make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips in another tongue will I speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon pre Reep line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken so the text says when this Holy Ghost comes there'll be many resist it and resist the Holy Ghost but thank God there will be some to receive it so the conclusion of Isaiah 28 just to summarize is that in these scriptures we find that what is tied to the Holy Ghost is it is the fresh food coming it's not it's a fresh word of the hour that he sends the Holy Ghost to make real and so if it's old food vomit he says your tables are full of vomit that's all regurgitated food so when God sends the Holy Ghost it's to identify himself with the word for that hour and it is a fresh word that comes it is the word for the hour so when we're looking at the evidences of the Holy Ghost and wanting to know what it is it's tied to the word of God its evidence is tied to the word because it keeps saying line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little it's tied to the word being line upon line not outside of the not the outside manifestation of stammering lips that will be the outside manifestation but the inside is its tied to the word the people will come for the word of that day the Holy Ghost will fill them to make that word live that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and then it says it's the rest how many believe the Holy Ghost is a rest it's the refreshing can you say Amen if it's a rest then it's it's not something that's complicated if it's a rest he don't send the Holy Ghost to make your life more confused Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I'll give you rest he's talking about the Holy Ghost so when he comes he doesn't make a struggle over works and I got to gain my entrance into heaven no the Holy Ghost when it comes into your life is to bring rest it is the refreshing it is the rest that comes to your life and the biggest rest is in your soul that I don't have to work my way into heaven that he comes changes your nature can you say amen and I'm at peace with God going in a Rapture that's a rest Jesus God when he when he spoke from the beginning he had to rest in his own word after six days of creating then he went into a Sabbath and you know what he was resting on the word that he already spoke right God has already spoke his word and the Holy Ghost say you enter into rest that he's already spoken it'll be done that's what the scripture is saying and then the last thing some would reject the line upon line for word for their day and this fits with step's rebuke just before he was stoned by the Jews he looks up and he says these words which is pretty Stern and we might get get back into this in a subject of the Holy Ghost ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did he's speaking to religious leaders you're resisting the word for your hour you're resisting the Holy Ghost as your fathers did and the the opposite then of resisting is what the opposite of resisting the Holy Ghost is believing it's just that simple God needs a believing heart God needs you to believe God needs you to trust all the stuff that he wants to do to you here in Ezekiel and change your life it it comes by this person that begins to believe not up here but really believe it I believe it and you start saying Lord I believe this I don't see it yet in my life but I believe it resisting it is a different story but when you begin to believe isn't amazing the entire message theme song was just two words and the angel liked that song and though they sang it at every healing line and every service just about the theme of the entire message was not Doctrine the theme song for the entire message was not heavy revies heavy Revelation the theme of the entire message was only believe all things are possible when you get to believe he said if you get the people believe nothing will stand in your way not even cancer if you could do what get a dress code get them lined up on the outside no get them to believe this is God only believe this morning only believe step out come to the altar in your heart begin to believe what God can do for you and that's the opposite of resisting it blocking it and so there was those that resisted it even Steven spoke of but when we begin to believe then we come into God starting a work in us and filling us blessed be the name of the Lord Now we move to the next place in the Old Testament that emphasizes the Holy Ghost and that's in Ezekiel 36 the scriptures that I read to you and of course the scriptures is Naturally Speaking of Israel's restoration as a nation what he will do in the last days for his people what he does to Israel as a nation he does to you as an individual he worked as an individual to the Gentiles and he works as a nation to Israel so whatever he does in Prophecy to Israel as a nation he's doing to you as an individual that's right always forget that always we always forget the fact that we that we are somehow uh looking at this like a group effort I'm in the message I I go to the message meetings I'm this that and the other but we should never look at this I want to see more Unity at the message churches I want to see more unity in the bride and when I think of the Bride I don't just think of certain churches under a certain label that's not how he deals with the Gentiles oh if they could all just come I'm not so sure every technical church is going to come in Oneness and unity but the bride will individuals will I don't even know if everyone in our own assembly I'd like everybody to but would come into the Oneness like Pentecost again I don't know if you will because this is not a church effort this is an individual effort and he will have a bride from every nation from all the churches can you say amen I don't know who his bride is but she will come into unity and she will be in a Rapture so be careful that you own always you're just looking for everybody and all the preachers to agree and all this I think that's not what God looks at it he deals with Israel as a nation he deals with you as an individual that's why he could say if you want your church to have a Revival don't wait around for everybody else let the Revival start in you and it'll break out other places oh we're having a Revival we're having a meeting we're having a camp meeting we're doing a tent meeting we're doing this I got to get to that that's great if you're hearing the word of God but don't don't put yourself as I'm a part of something right and so I'm okay because I'm a part of a certain group the message the message to me is not the churches the message is what God sent in the last days to get us back to Bible Faith that's what the message is lot of things that's been done under the name of the message I don't talk about him a lot because I'm ashamed that would happen under brother Brandon if he was here he'd be ashamed every great minister of God if God uses them greatly Luther Wesley have fanaticism that follow them that's the devil's work we have a reporter that's contacted the church and asked us and I'm getting some advice from our Communications rep there brother Jared he deals with these things she's heard a lot of bad things and the stuff she listed we're not guilty of any of it but she said I want to come I'd like to be a part of service and I want to inter and I want to talk to you to see if I can get a positive side to what takes place and and what it is that you believe and so I've been very prayerful about that because you never know but I believe God will lead us and give us wisdom and we'll be we'll be sharing more with you about that it's bound to happen when you're out there on the internet and things people want to know what you believe but I just sent back a little simple thing and I said listen you are welcome to come and and you know view what we're doing but let me say this everything you've listed here that you have heard we're not guilty or responsible or don't believe any of that that you've heard that's went on we believe in Jesus Christ that he sent a man of God and I believe that if we're prayerful as a church we can send a positive message about this message that's would be my desire because you don't hear a lot of positive praise the Lord so what God does to Israel as a nation he does to the individual and the end result to Ezekiel 36 is that I the end result is in verse uh it would be 27 I will put my spirit within you that's what he wants to do now don't let that become common to you please that is that is a huge thing that God in our s sin in our Humanity in our Brokenness in our flub UPS if in in our nature that we're born with because everybody knows from what I've been preaching you were born with the wrong nature in you but with all of our baggage with everything that we got God said I'm going to take that all that baggage I'm going to take you on and I'm going to cleanse you I'm going to take you from the Heathen I'm going to I'm going to cleanse you with sprinkle you with water and then I've got to change your Stony heart and then I've got to do this is what I want to talk about today and all of it there's you have nothing to do with it I'm taking you on as my masterpiece and my end result is to prepare a place a tabernacle In Your Vessel that I would actually put my spirit within you this is the Holy Ghost hallu I say praise the lord lord so we've already learned in this that we are his workmanship so we see here how he leads and does the work from the beginning he does it all I mentioned nine times in these verses he mentions the word I I will bring you from the other countries I will give you a new spirit I will change your Stony heart I will change your spirit I is mentioned nine times and you're not in there except what God's doing to you you didn't go to any seminars to make yourself better you didn't put any Band-Aids on it you don't own there some Theologian God said I'm I'm it's a personal pronoun I love you so much I'll take you as you are but I won't leave you as you are and God can take the worst sinner the worst homosexual lesbian a filthy adulterer prostitute give me your worst cases God says I will take you on and I will love you out of your mess and then when I'm done I will actually put my spirit within you somebody ought to sh shout and say praise the Lord you better not take that for granted that you're just a church member because I preach to some church members I preach to the body of Christ I preach to church members but God wants to make you more than a church member more than ones that just comes and raises your hand God says I want to put my spirit within [Applause] you we are his workmanship so he says I'll do it it's not your works from start to finish it's him if you will believe and receive put yourself for your in other words the only thing that you can do is put yourself in an obedience to him say Okay Lord I'm going to climb up on the potter's wheel CU you're the Potter it's quiet here but I want to ask every person in this room I don't care if you're a visitor or you've been with me 35 years how willing are you to bring yourself and put yourself up on the Potter's will and don't leave you stay there for the rest of your life how many would trust God and say I'm ready to put myself on The Potter's will you mold me you cuz when when that Potter he's got all that stuff and you see that big lump of clay there and he just starts to work his hands on your life and get off all CU he sees the image of what you'll be you don't but he sees it and he just keeps working and keeps working and tearing things off your life tan that smoking drinking and gambling and gaming bad gaming and and and pornography and all that and you just you just you just all you did was get up on the Potter's well I'm not perfect today except for the blood of Jesus Christ but I've kept my life on the Potter's will and it's day by day sometimes every service he's still correcting me just just rubbing that off rubbing that off too only Perfect by his blood can you say Amen so we see then that the result and the goal is him living in you that's the mystery of Christ is to put his spirit in you that's the Holy Ghost his spirit and and and and I don't know who would not want this I don't know who what person would not want for God to come in their lives and put his Spirit within you now we we hash over the details we complicate it sometimes ministers will get up and give their testimony and they think everybody's testimony is going to be the same as theirs it's the same Holy Ghost but you'll have your own testimony because if he's going to go the Heathen and find you first he has to go find you and you're dwelling amongst the Heathen a bunch of smokers and Drinkers and gambl and grew up in a home there's alcoholics and you come everybody comes from different countries but you were with the heathen and let me say if you weren't with the Heathen you got a heathen heart if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're you're on the internet with the Heathen every day right praise the Lord I'm getting my voice back I'm getting ready to preach now well I didn't come from the denomination I didn't come from the world I grew up in this message but you're still a heathen in your heart and you're still without the Holy Ghost hanging around the Heathen on the internet with pornography and social media media you're you're looking to the Heathen how does she dress how does she act I want to be like the Heathen and God says you know what I got to get you away from the Heathen first so I'll take you from among the Heathen and I'll get you here up on the potter's wheel and I'll begin to work at your life so his result is to put his Spirit who wouldn't want this who would not be willing to want this wonderful thing of his spirit being in us a promise to put his Spirit within you that you live out this work of the Lord you live out his word not by rules not by a law but you live out the word by him living in you because for 2,000 years Satan's always trying to take it back to a law back to dos and don'ts you do this you don't do this you do that you don't do this and so you got people living it to try to please God and live this word how can anybody live this word with a serpent nature you talk about a miserable life but when he says I don't want you to live it with a serpent nature I don't want you to try to do it yourself I need you to believe me and put yourself on the potter's wheel and I'll burn all that stuff out of you I'll sprinkle you with clear water then then I'll fill you with my spirit and when I do you'll walk in my statues you'll walk in my word hallelujah so it's to restore the human being back to Eden again as it said because of the Fall look all that God has to do to get you in a place to receive his Spirit he has to take you from the Heathen gather you out of all the countries sprinkle with you with clean water cleanse you from your filthiness cleanse you from your Idols wash you from your Idols because you live a life of Idols you got Idols you got images that you you bow to I don't bow to nothing in your heart you bow to images you bow to sports stars you bow to musical stars to to Divas you bow to intellectuals if you're more intellectually SL you bow to the scientists and you bow to science and there's the world is full of idols and television helps to bring those images in front of us all the time so we can bow more that's true and then he said I got to give you a new heart I got to give you a new spirit and God says I'm I'm I'm taking away your Stony heart and then when then I give you a new spirit because you see you don't have a willing Spirit you you have a before you even get the Holy Ghost and his Spirit within you you have a spirit that's unwilling to come everybody wants to say I know God and I i' like to worship God but to come his way every Spirit seems to be unwilling you don't have a willing spirit so this is the way it's been said God will never make you go against your will but he certainly can make you willing to go there's an old song I thought of that somebody's saying Sharon uh Ike you'll remember this and I'm going to go back on my notes because oh do you guys have that did you find it sister jeie well this is just a little break at this old song that is uh called um what's it called sister jeie The Hornet song Sharon you remember this the old Hornet song that basically end saying God doesn't make us go against our will but he certainly can make us willing to go God can create situation when the Canaanites Harden their hearts against God and grieved him because of their sin God sent along Hornets to bring terms and to help his own people people to win now the Hornets persuaded them that it was best to go quickly and not to go slow they didn't compel them to go against their will but they just made them willing to go go ahead let's they liked it so we'll do it God doesn't compel us to go oh no he never compels us to go God does not compel us to go against our will but he just makes us willing to go give me another verse there if a nest of live Hornets were brought to this room and the creatures allowed to go free free you would not need urging to make yourself scarce you'd want to get out don't you see they would not lay hold and by force of their strength throw you out of the W out of the window oh no they would not compel you to go against your will they would just make you willing to go is there another one yeah next one when Jonah was sent to the work of the Lord the Outlook was very not very bright why he never had done such a hard thing before so he backed out and ran off from the flight but God sent a big F to swallow him up the story I'm sure you all know God didn't compel him to go against his will but he just made him willing to go Ezekiel 36 to me says this because you have a spirit that's unwilling you were born with it you were born with a nature that actually is in an enemy against God you didn't learn that you're just automatically an an enemy against God by what you feel feel rock and roll the spirit of rock and roll will catch a young heart Prophet says I wish I could take my children up to the mountain and get them away from all this but he says what's in them is going to come out anyway oh I wish I could take my children up to a mountain no phones no internet no access to nothing protect my kids completely from it and I think we should there's a certain protection homes under the token give their kids but he said if I would to do that and get them away from all these bad influen he said what's in them is going to come out and he said rock and roll will catch that heart just as quick as anything because what's in them rock and roll Spirit was created to make that nature happy I love it I love the country music I love the music of the world they grab it's all been developed by Satan to match a serpent nature but I want to tell you there's songs and there's the word and there's things God's created to match the nature of somebody with the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost only feeds on one thing and that's the word of God not entertainment not Fellowship but when you get it the main thing that you'll want is to hear the word of God I want it and I I'm I was here Wednesday night and I heard it but I'm here again every day I want to because there's a craving one of the evidences I seen in my life is I got a craving for the word of God like I never had before Something's Happened if you're craving that more than all the other things you enjoyed before all of that's become less that's a sideshow I don't even want some of it anymore I don't want that but I really love to hear the next step in the word I really love to be in the word of God Amen I think a lot of you can say that's happened in my life so God comes and does the work he doesn't make us go against their will but he makes us willing to go that's what I see here in Ezekiel 36 and don't put yourself in your own time frames of when God's going to do this that's where we get in trouble I I do see a process here of God working on us to get us ready to receive his spirit I believe it's a growth I believe it's a process but nobody knows the time FR frames and the process for you and the process for me and if you put your own time frames on it say okay I need to reach this I've had Minister say okay I have how can I come up to the pyramid okay so I've got faith I need virtue now I need knowledge Temperance patience I got this and and so they're trying to work it all out and brother B says God births everything every one of those things he birth into you so he's still doing it so I could okay got virtue now on to the next one Lord we don't know what he's doing we just submit ourselves we know when we got more patience you like wow something's happened to me cuz I would have bit that guy's head off before Something's Happened to Me the love of God is taken over so we don't put time frames because it I just say in his it's in his time in his season we just submit ourselves to God can you say amen and I do believe we offer a desperation to God that was the message after the token the Holy Ghost is desperation because God likes to see a desperation God let me just say it this way to be simple this morning how can you receive his Spirit the the holy ghost in your life if you haven't even asked for it he likes to hear you ask he likes to really want it oh Lord he just give it to me whenever he feels I'm not preaching that this morning I'm looking for a desperation to say God I'm asking for this thing of your spirit I need it now more than ever the time is short and I'm not doing it just to to evade hell I'm doing because I need this in my life there's too many demon powers trying to lead me into pornography and into the things of the world and lust and all these other things I need your spirit living in me ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open to you he likes us to be desperate in the asking but we don't do the work and let me say something about your time frames okay that you put on God and try to diagnose where you're at and diagnose where the rest of the people are we're so good at diagnosing where people are in their Christian walk can I get an amen we're professionals we're we're Fruit inspectors we're going to examine the fruit in everybody else but they're not too good at it as far as ourselves but we do it in everybody else and then we think no we know where we're at and you know one fell sometime in the office says we're in a really good place right now we yeah we're we're in a good place we're in a good place and and I'm seeing otherwise I'm trying to share with them as a pastor now there's something you know there's some things you need to take to the Cross I'm encouraging you as's a pastor some things you you you need to talk about with your family and such but to him hey everything was everything's hunky dory but you see now oh you can only pray because it's in God's timing God would Open the Eyes of every one of us to see where we're at but God has his own timing and let me say this God can do more in one moment that's right you see all this process he can do it he can do it just like that right we know that that new birth just like sin happened in a moment and we all of sons after the first Adam we were born in sin by a Moment of going against the word of God now all was had in a moment all of humanity fell under Adam and Eve we didn't even do that we inherited it in a moment that happened well if it can happen in sin in a moment in a moment God can change a life when you open your heart a moment he can do a lot of things because he's doing it so in a moment he could do more than you could ever do polishing yourself up for years don't put time frames of God just say my life is in his hands if you don't put it in his hands you can slow up God's work how many knows if you don't put your life in God's hand you'll slow up his work in ezel Ezekiel 36 I think you could slow down this process God wants to do it but if you don't put your life completely in his hands you slow up the process but I remind you of a promise all the father have given me will come that's what I preached the first time in the in the uh series on the Holy Ghost all the father given and I always say this those who been me with with me for years if you're a son or daughter of God you're either going to come hard or you're going to come easy but God's God's not going to let you go God's not going to let you go it's in his time frames but you'll never go too far as a son and daughter of God that's why we can't be critical as somebody who's gone way out and say they went out from us because they weren't of us and all these scriptures that we're quoting serpent seed and all and none of us have a right to label anyway I've I watched a message Minister leave this message 20 years ago and just here two or three years ago he went out he became a theologian he is from Sister miam's area there in Quebec he went out he become a theologian he studied he studied all the religions he studied all he' become a great thing and when he' been out there for 20 years he come back and testified over the pulpit at brother Chad's church I haven't found the revealed truth like this anywhere he he came back Hallelujah came back god wow so praise the Lord those of you who made him serpent seed you need to repent right you need to repent true God has his time for your life Hallelujah God has his timing you see I you know young person say I'm gonna put this off I'm gonna put this no it's not your time it's God's time he's got your number okay so he says here in the inner veil about this thing about putting a new spirit within you I didn't want to pass this up because this is real good he says in the interval in the first quote there notice you put a new spirit God puts a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with God you can't get along with yourself that Old Devil spirit that you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them I will put and I will put my spirit in them he said after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's spirit sometimes somebody just gets a new spirit and okay I've got the Holy Ghost now not always not always because he has to give you and so they feel fresh they feel good they feel the maybe feel the power of God everything's okay don't say everything's okay you are work in progress stay at The Potter's will say Lord I Thank you for changing me in this area but I want the full thing I want the full inheritance I got it tonight in the alter that's it it's over I'm done and no no no you're never done no no you're not done till God says you're done yeah can you say Amen you're not finished till God says you're finished Hallelujah goes on to say it's he said don't get it confused with God's spirit it's not it's your new spirit you can get a you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you amen cuz you're in a condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how you ever going to get along with God oh my that's so honest how you ever GNA you can't even get along with your wife you can't get along with your neighbor how you ever go you don't have a lot of getalong ability you're not born with it you got your friends and your little click or whatever but most people I don't need everybody else hello that's pride and I don't understand that's a church member because they I'll I'll pick who I like to be around and it'll be the cool people and I don't want to even be around the where's that come in I thought we were brothers in Christ yeah I just say to you this isn't the cool church and that's why some people that just they may not hang around because it's just we're not the cool Church the pastor's not cool and after a few years they realize he's just not cool I mean I try to dress nice but I'm still not cool my kids will tell you Dad is not cool but we're not the cool church we have some that's come from very rough situations and and we have quirky people here and we have we have all kinds here and most of us we're just not cool we're not the cool church if you want the cool church this isn't it where's all that come in with Brothers and Sisters in Christ we're not the cool Church we're here to try to find God and serve the Lord and humble ourselves to be broken together how many raise your hand say I'm broken I I need the Lord I'm broken why don't you come and be broken with us why don't you come and be one of us instead of think you're better than the rest of us amen so he goes on to say you can't even get along with him you don't have any get along ability when you're you're born with it so how are you going to get along with the word of God and the spirit of God not until God gives you a new spirit so you can start saying I believe him and then when he puts his Spirit that's the amen or to his word you love his word more than anything else there's only one true spirit that can live this word and it's the author himself of the book it's his Spirit you cannot do this on your own when I put my spirit in you it'll cause you to walk in my statues you'll walk in the ways of the word it'll happen you said well I struggle with dress and I just struggle with that you keep submitting yourself to God you'll get to the place you'll never struggle with that again it'll be over it might take you 10 years I hope it doesn't but you say someone struggling with that if you're a child of God one day that'll be over it'll be settled thank God we have some sisters in here that had images that was settled years ago they're not walking out with an UNM modest garment or a tight skirt or something like that it was settled years ago I'm not fighting this anymore this is the way God told us how to dress all the struggles are gone and you love it you you love it you love it and so I conclude after this quote he says you can't get along with husband how are you going to get along with he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him can you say amen he has to is there more to that so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his Spirit In You gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new Faith then he puts his holy spirit in you you know what I conclude out all this you're a lot of work when I read Ezekiel 36 again last night I thought Lord I'll just say it to you guys you're a piece of work now I look that up and that can have an A positive connotation but today it has a negative because when somebody's mad he say you're a real piece of work and Ezekiel 36 36 must say to us all of us he's got to pull you from the me he's got to give you you got a Stony heart you got a spirit that won't get along with anybody or God you got a A will that says I'm going to do my own will and not God's you got all of that you are a piece of work yeah and then God says but I'm taking this piece of work am and I'm going to do something with it that's right you're a lot of work but when he moves into your life he can take the worst cases blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Ray he can take the worst cases bring me your worst caseall see well I'm not a worst case but I'm here to tell you you're still a piece of work you got things friends I could take the next hour start with myself and start to go through when you come you come with a mind that's been against God you come with a bitterness you come with people hurting you you've got baggage Galore right true you come with a lack of trust you come I minister to people the Holy Spirit ministers through me to a lot of people that come from hurtful situations hallu and I hear their past erupt when they get angry about something or when I would preach or when something would happen similar to their past this volcano erupts and they spill out this thing and they're they're not healed from it yet right I'm glad God's put me in this place to minister praise the Lord to people who need healing by the Holy Ghost cuz you're all a piece of work right and I am too yes that's the TR but God says I'll take the worst cases whatever you have that's what he did in the healing lines bring me the worst case yeah they put it in the papers bring your worst case bring somebody that doctors is labeled they're almost gone they're dying bring your if God was saying that through the prophet of this hour and he could say it in a healing line bring the worst cancer cases bring the bring bring the people that are blind I've seen the blind eyes open I've seen the dead raised I can testify of it take your worst case and God says I rose with healing in my wings bring your worst cases because it wasn't brother brandom it was God saying I am God I'll take the worst case so if he takes the worst case physically then he takes the worst case for The Souls of men problem is was people don't think that they're a piece of work come on pretty good oh the media team was putting out that little clip of me saying and it's went a lot of places me saying I'm a good old brother Paul I'm a pretty good boy and all this stuff you need a new birth yeah good old boys never make it to Heaven it's the Holy Ghost filled boys and young men and young women that are going to be in a Rapture yes but I'm good I was good to my parents and I'm taking care of I'm doing and you got your whole list of stuff that build up say you get to the Pearly Gates and you say man here's my list I'm ready to go but did did you accept simply the blood of Jesus Christ for your sin did you receive my spirit that was poured out from Calvary I didn't think I needed that because I've been a decent person you need the new birth you need to be born again so God is determined to take the worst cases God's determined to live in you you it's not a problem for God you see you're not determined when you come in he's determined thankfully somebody's determined here because when you first come to him you're not that determined you're not determined to receive a spirit you're not determined to change but God was determined for your life you went way out somewhere you went you said I'm leaving this thing I'm leaving this truth but guess what and when you weren't determined when you weren't determined even to come back God was determined for you God had a determination for your life hallelujah hallelujah and so we see then you see it's what we can it's not what we can do but it's what we believe when we submit to him to let him have his way to get desperate for ourselves to get desperate for God I want this Holy Ghost living in me say it to him this morning I want this Holy Ghost living in me I want to be filled with this Holy Ghost do you see do you know this work is a sec this work of the Holy Spirit moving into our lives CU I want to talk about when the holy spirit moves into your life just like he moves to bring a message he moved in the days of Christ for his birth and he begin to move he gave Joseph A Dream the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was doing a lot of things but it was the Holy Ghost moving because he's getting ready to bring the Messiah and do something great so the when the Holy Ghost begins to move into your life eventually eventually great things begin to happen but when he begins to move it's so similar do you know that when the Holy Ghost moves in your life we find it in the second verse of your Bible what I'm preaching and teaching on a series on the Holy Ghost is in the second verse of your Bible that says you should know it because you learned it in Sunday School in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void empty and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of those Waters Glory he already did it for this Earth that's the condition it was in that's the condition you were in but I was raised in the message Darkness was upon the face of your deep Darkness was on the face of your deep your soul Darkness covers it Lord yeah and you you you would have stayed that way but guess what happened the Holy Ghost moved in might have happened 10 years ago might be happening this morning but when he begins to move upon the face of the waters what be to happen he took chaos are you listening he took darkness when he moved on it he took chaos and he made it an Eden so if he did that to the Earth why would he just do it to the Earth you're his people so if he moved upon the face of the water and he began to do something for for the earth to make an Eden to take a chaos to take a piece of work like you and turn it into an Eden a fruitful place where God can speak through you and God can use you and you can be cleansed and and all these other things if God did that to the Earth then he can make an Eden in your life as well by what the holy ghost moving upon your life some of you can raise your hand and say I I felt his touch that he was near me even when I was a child oh yeah oh yeah I almost died in this certain incident but I knew God stepped in and preserved my life and that's why I think we should never we should be careful to say God's not working in my life in this current trial because it don't take very long for you to look back in your life and say God in your life God was here God was there God had a purpose here God God moveed and then he begins to really move into your life and when he really begins to move and start to take the rough edges off a little bit you squirm a little bit in church and for some reason you sat on the front row you probably shouldn't have because it's if you're under conviction it's worse up here you start to squirm in your seat and you're not squirming because you're sitting by Hannah you're squirming because the conviction of the Holy Spirit and and and people they run from that they scare from it some of you grw up in the message call it condemnation I'm feeling condemned so I'm getting out of here could it be conviction could it be that the Holy Spirit was trying to draw You by a correction call for something and you may scorm there's no problem problem with squirming but just realize what's going on it might be the Holy Ghost moved upon the face of the waters the Holy Ghost moved upon you people attacking to say oh he's preaching at my kids or he's preaching at me I say be careful right that it isn't the biblical way of how God draws a heart so all of you have felt that little squirming haven't you oh yeah when God first to deal with you because everything he's going to bring you is contrary to your whole Spirit right you see but but you say I'm GNA go with this because he's starting to work on my heart then he breaks the heart and you you begin you were going to run out the door never come back again but you begin to cry I'm sorry sister annna was beside me not Hannah Hallelujah instead of running away something happens and you just start to recognize man if I leave this place then my life stays the same but something's happened to me and I'm weeping and I'm crying I'm feeling bad for what I've done that's not a bad thing it's good it's not bad it's good that's right it's good like Ellie says it's not bad it's good don't underestimate what the Lord is doing to move upon your life don't run from it embrace it because Millions won't feel that but you're feeling it you're feeling God's doing something in meise Lord Brother Paul you don't know what I've been through and I respond to you and say you don't know my God hallelujah hallu this this mystery of him coming in you and coming in a piece of work and beginning and and then wanting to live in a piece of work uh Wednesday night we heard it by our brother the Tabernacle the Throne of God type of Jesus being the Tabernacle we also a tabernacle had three parts to it like we have three parts if you've studied the Old Testament Tabernacle it types the New Testament Tabernacle he comes in human beings and His glory comes down in the holy of holies comes down in your soul that's the Holy Ghost but brother landland brought out that it's interesting that this whole Tabernacle that was overlaid with gold on the inside which means deity but then did you see how God put covered it all up with Badger skins Badger skins and if we look at it this mystery of him coming in you is all through the Bible even back to that Tabernacle to Badger skins covering this deity that God would say in his mystery that I will come and live in people that were Badgers before all right they're not Badgers anymore but I'm going to leave the skin to show that my glory can live in Badger skins cuz until we get a new body we're still in these Badger skins that's good did you know that a badger why did God choose Badger skins I found out last night that Badgers we know in the world is the one of of the most meanest animals I mean when I read about them I never want to meet one they are they're they're the meanest animal they're made the most Fearless animal animal and sometimes they can actually uh scare away a lion which is amazing because lion he's the king of the jungle you know he can do this but in some instances they can do the right thing because they are the meanest their meanness alone would scare even a lion and he will he he will and here's a picture okay you don't want to meet up with one of these fellas this is what he this is what God Said to put around the deity of the Tabernacle to show what you were get back stay away from me come on you don't mess and they say they have different different Badgers they have honey badgers I don't know why they call them honey badgers there's no honey about them maybe they can be sweet for a minute and then they turn on you I know people can do that oh they can loving you speak shake your hand and all that but then they can turn on you oh yeah oh my I love you brother Paul I love you oh we we support you and all these but but but oh my goodness they're sweet only a name but but this animal would tear you to pieces he would tear you up American Badgers are some of the worst and they're they say they're bad-tempered and they're grumpy they don't retreat from any fight they will not Retreat it doesn't matter if it's the worst snake hey snakes they have no fear of they're going to they're going to and here's that here's what they say about them these guys they're going to not Retreat from a fight because they haven't they're going to they're going to fight and they're going to win the fight and most of them they do no matter what animal it is they win I've seen videos of them I mean I really researched this for y'all I don't want to come up to one of these things but I'm wondering if I come up to them sometimes and I know this is what we were they're the meanest animal because without God guess what the prophet said without god without the holy ghost man can be become like a beast and rape a woman true so it's the meanest animal it's what God Said in here it's grumpy it's bad-tempered and they don't retreat from a fight they like to fight they like to kill in the fight they they like to win they don't they must not feel the pain I I've seen videos of them getting bit by a snake but they have this immune system built up to the poison even and they're going to keep because the fight is more important than the bite that they just receive from a snake I watch snake bite them in the face and they keep fighting until they put those those teeth in that snake and take them for dinner and they've been even poisoned already winning is important to them oh who wasn't Moody he said when are we going to stop in the ministry in the church stop trying to win arguments and start winning Souls can I get an amen when in the message are we going to quit trying to win arguments and quit having quote battles and try to win some souls for the Lord more important to kill prey than to be hurt they don't care about being hurt they're going to stay in the fight even the biggest snake can bite them it don't affect them they never leave a fight that they have started they can chase the Lions away sometimes God takes the meanest animal and puts that in the mystery I'm going to put my I'm going to change your spirit I'm going to I'm going to put my Spirit within this the the the ark was covered around with Badger skin notice the only thing left now listen the only thing left with this was the Skins the badger had to be killed your old Nature has to be killed your Badger ways has to be killed the only thing left was the skins for God to say I'm putting my deity in Badger skins this is to remind us how mean we really are against God and God's grace says but I wanted to say I can put my deity in Badger skins that's a miracle that's a mystery that's the mystery of God Christ in you huj the hope of Glory Hallelujah can I get an amen this morning Hallelujah I preach as long as I got a voice and it's starting to go but I just want to finish this God has to do a lot to us you got a Stony heart you got a spirit that rebells else you resist you you got a mind dirty minds we come with a lot of things and a heart filled with other things and after we read all this the conclusion is you're a real piece of work you really are a lot of baggage a lot of stuff anybody ever read this scripture in Psalms 39:5 it says behold thou Hast made my days as a hand breath and my age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is allog together vanity wow I think we should say Amen to that one too it's in the Bible take him at his very best state and his emptiness without God I've been successful brother Paul I'm doing I'm doing a good job I do praise the Lord but you say now without God it doesn't mean anything man at his best state it's still vanity there's still nothing to it so we can't properly fix ourselves the sin natur inside before we did anything wrong you could put kids in the best environment and still there's no change on the inside you are a real piece of work but I know a spirit that can move on your life and he can turn chaos into Eden if you will let him he will do that with you how many believe it piece of work piece of work Masterpiece and the prophet goes down that line he actually called that message his Masterpiece sermon the Masterpiece cuz he took it took it from Adam and Adam and Eve was his Masterpiece family son and daughter of God without sin standing there as controllers of the earth then sin came in marred the Masterpiece then he took 2,000 years to build his Masterpiece back again and Christ was the second Adam then he births the church which was a piece of the master right when he pierced that sear put that pierced him with in the side with a sword with a spear that blood came out he took the spirit in that brought it back on 120 Believers you were a piece of the master then they begin at Pentecost and for 2,000 years Satan gets in the church and now becomes marred becomes Church systems all these other things but God says I will restore and says I will take that people and I will build my masterpiece off of the piece of the Masterpiece you are a piece of work but God takes the piece of work it says I'll make a masterpiece out of the piece of work yeah so you start out he says that Masterpiece that Masterpiece he wants to build it's a process but he's going to have a masterpiece how many still with me bring that picture up this is how it starts here when you're talking about a statue then this is where it starts a big chunk of marble out of the Quarry just grabs a big chunk cuts the big chunk this is what you look like you don't look like a masterpiece yet that's right you're Rough Around the Edges you're all dirty Ezekiel says I got to put sprinkle clean water on you yeah God sends the tractors out pulls you out he says I'll take you from all the nations take you from all the countries out cut you out of that look at all the other Stone back there but he predestination he cut you you out of there with the tractor and brings you away from all the rest of the stone so he can begin to mold your life thank you Jesus then he cuts you down to the next one and makes a smaller Stone and he begins to work in your life chipping with the special tools and begins to work something's in there as he said about Michelangelo doing Moses he said he's seen a vision of what Moses he's seen the vision of Moses in the stone right he's seen something in the stone that you couldn't see only the only the uh only Michelangelo could see it and because he had the vision of it he's the only one qualified to stand there and chisel and away at your life God's the only one qualified to Chisel away at your life and to deal with you man should not deal with souls and Men God should deal with you he knows how to deal with you he loves you in the right way and you need to go to the next when you start to see something forming after a while something begins to form in your life because you're under the hand of the Potter you're under the hand of that great architect that great one that sculptor that seeing the vision there can you say praise the Lord hallelujah make sure you listen to that message the Masterpiece and then finally takes out of that and brings a bride in the last days a bride Perfect Bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish can you say Amen before you were a piece of work now you're really truly a piece of work but you're a piece of his work reason I chose this one is not and not Michelangelo's Moses is because this is what he's molding right now it's a bride a piece of the master can you say Amen you're a piece of work but now you're a piece of his work but a work of a divine sculpture Jesus Christ and we see in the last days it's the build a bride if he built the first Adam then he can rebuild the rebuild the bring the first Adam the second Adam then he can rebuild the first Eve and bring her back again and the way brother said is if it was Adam and Eve together that made the first Masterpiece family when Michelangelo was moved by by what he created that the vision was so perfect after he had finished it how many knows what he did to the Statue it was so real to the image in his mind that he struck it and he said speak praise the Lord final voice to the final age is the Bride of Jesus Christ and he's molding your life so that you come so much to the image of Jesus Christ thank you God says where am I going to speak now I'm going to speak through this [Music] bride I'm going to use this bride I'm going to speak through this bride and now for 2,000 years brother Bram says nearly 2,000 years God has been making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam a piece off of him a part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him for it's it's this new testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled as it is taken him for 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece in so doing he does it by his never changing method the same way he did he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he is he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word started in the first church what was it the seed what was he starting it by the Holy Ghost the seed the word the words the word manifested the promise that been given Joel said it shall come to pass in the last days say a God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions how many see in that scripture how many see that it's the young people too what we he would do in the last days as the Masterpiece fell there is a masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell at Pentecost at niia Rome at Nia after niia Rome she's come through a process but she is coming right back again to that Masterpiece perfected cuz she's a part of that word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spot or without wrinkle thank Hallelujah Glory he took a piece of himself at Calvary it took a piece to make make another Masterpiece if that is the final goal of God if you're a part of that then won't he be molding your life by the Holy Ghost and filling you with the Holy Ghost he will mold you and fill you by his spirit and he's determined to have this masterpiece his Masterpiece God will make you willing you are a piece of work by his grace a bride by Grace not by works I will remind you of one quote that was quoted to us last Sunday by Brother Craig five is the number of Grace j s u s g r a c f AI t h so forth the number of Grace the last quote God ever sends if God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of the people did anybody catch that it's a pretty powerful quote so whose hand are we under the hand of Grace if he changes you gives you a new spirit it's the Lord that does it and then he fills you with the spirit it's the hand of Grace on your life it's the hand of Grace he says if God sends his power to the church how many want that it'll be his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of the people and Isaiah said the 40th chapter cried to jerus Jerusalem that her Warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was God's grace that was sending it God sends anything to us it'll be by his grace and not our own merits now I think we should be obedient yes but at the end of the day it's you surrendering your lives at the end of the day it's his handiwork we are his workmanship it's his grace and as we keep surrendering to that as we keep y yielding to that he'll provide all that's needed for the rest of the journey before I close I want to say again this is an individual work in your life you and God am it's you and God and when you meet him someday it'll be you and God you're not going to come in with the literal life and we all come in as a church you know you just you tag along my coattails I knew brother Paul so we all just stand before God no no no no no it' Be You prise Lord it' be you and the question is did you love me enough because he loved you you knew that did you love me enough to respond back and let his work come in your life his grace it's an individual it's not doing the big things I'm going to share this quick testimony before I close and I've I've taken your time this morning morning I appreciate you being so attentive especially to somebody who has a scratchy voice I don't like to hear somebody like it I gets irritating couple weeks ago I found out that there was this real godly woman named AA um Ogden AA Ogden AA douly Ogden her ma maiden name was douly and she very gifted woman come to find out she wrote about 3,000 poems and hymns and in the 1900s and she 1800 late in 1800s 1900s and she she wanted to go on a revi her and her husband wanted to go with a tour which was a Revival and be in Revival meetings and tent meetings whatever they were doing it's a special revival going around the country she had gifts to do it she had gifts to use and contribute to the Revival to do something big like that was their desire and come to find out she was a school teacher her and her husband a Sunday school teacher in Toledo for I think 20 or 30 years and then as they were making plans to go do that they were going to go do that then all of a sudden her dad got a stroke and so I think she had to bring him from Iowa and she began to have to take care of them they had a they had a summer home and they had a little cabin beside the home it was attached to the house and so she brought her dad there and she began to realize that her life would change and she would not get to go and do something that big she would not get to go that Ministry with her husband that she really wanted to do so AA was caught there taking 247 taking care of her father and what I didn't know is that that home I just seen it a few days ago is only three miles from this church on Summerfield Road the summer home just outside Toledo she was right here and so in that time as when she wrote a song most of you young people are not going to go know but some of you older ones know she wrote in 1912 in that cabin with her dad taking care of them she wrote the song brighten the corner where you are amen can you pull the words to that up right in the corner where you are you have that and this is what the lyrics says I'm only reading it because most of you don't know it do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do do not wait to shed your light afar to the many duties ever near near you now to be true brighten the corner where you are powerful some powerful words and she was living it out and sometimes when we get to think it as of doing big things and doing this and do that we need to think where does God want to use use me filled with his Spirit at my corner at my place because God can get even more Glory sometimes out of a simple work he she just has the on the course she says if you guys bright in the corner where you are bright in the corner someone far from Harbor you may guide across the bar brighten the corner where you are she has some other verses to it there but I thought isn't that amazing right here in our own area which we have quite a few songwriters in this church as well must be part of this road or something God draws them here a lot of music a lot of things but it is an amazing 1912 God moves her heart but we learn a lesson from her life that the Holy Spirit In Our Lives don't look for big things don't look to be seen don't look to show off just be humble and simple and say God what do you do want to do when you put this Spirit within my my life I worship you I'll serve you I'll stay on the Potter's will till you mow me into what I should be over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness he Fashions the clay a vessel of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away over and over over and over he molds me this is what he does in our lives his Li he fashion the clay of the soul of H I am today and it's all because Jesus didn't throw [Music] clay if you're not in a real hurry to go I just ask you to Bow your heads hopefully you're not in a hurry Jesus knows you this [Music] morning and if you feel that the Lord said something to you this morning that you know he does know you you he does know your life that you can begin to believe that you're one of the ones that could receive this Holy Spirit in your life could receive his work and begin to work your life I believe I'm one of the candidates I believe he's calling me brother Paul I want you to stand and just lift your hand and say I'm ready to receive this Christ into my life God bless you God bless you you see the holy spirit's moving just now he's been here in the service and we're praying for you you pray for us give him time to work in your life you have troubles you think you have things you don't understand whether you came from the world or you grew up in the message you have things you still don't understand you have sin in your life that you don't know why you did it I wish I hadn't done it and you have no place to bring that you've just become I don't know where I can bring that so I'm just I'm numb to it I I don't know what to do with it I'm asking you to see this place that of Calvary that Jesus says you can bring it to this morning whatever it is you can bring it to him and I'm asking you to lift your hands and surrender to the Lord I am ready I'm ready to receive him I'm ready to receive him and the work that he does will be in his hands and not in my hands I yield myself to him just before we pray together you think about these words the first verse to this song and she'd put it up we'll sing this I want you to take your time and consider this that The Potter Knows you he loves you are you willing to surrender to the Potter's will and his precious hand empty and broken think about about it I came back everybody everybody come back to him Vel unworthy so scarred if you're scarred by sin come to him this morning but he did not despair he started over again and and I bless the day he didn't throw what a power what a PO friends what a power he has in our lives oh over and over oh he molds me and makes [Music] me his light oh he passions the clay oh a [Music] vessel of all oh highest today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away you just bow your heads and speak to the Lord I don't know or normally do this but before we sing this second verse those who have stood would you just speak these words to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord [Music] Jesus I'm I'm giving myself today up to the Potter's will I Trust You Lord and there's a lot not a lot of people that I trust but I trust you I want to take a step to today toward you that I trust you that you can take my life I can't trust my life in anybody's hands and I can't trust them in my own hands I've already seen the fruit of that but today I want to trust my life into your hands father I give myself to [Music] you I yield myself to you [Music] would you come and sprinkle your clean water on me Lord would you sprinkle clean water on my mind and my heart it's like the Bible said would you come and take my Stony heart that's unwilling would you come and change it to a heart of Flesh would
