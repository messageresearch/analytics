[0:00] chapter five
[0:03] and i realize it's a quarter to twelve
[0:05] we had some extra
[0:07] singing but i don't mind them singing
[0:08] extra because it's a blessing to us
[0:12] so we'll be mindful of the time here
[0:14] today
[0:15] i received some text back after i
[0:17] preached last sunday much longer than i
[0:19] normally do
[0:21] and i received some support
[0:23] for that
[0:24] especially when you have people some
[0:25] people driving for two and three hours
[0:27] away
[0:28] um they kind of want their money's worth
[0:31] you know when they
[0:33] hate to say it that way but they don't
[0:35] have anywhere else to go in town so when
[0:36] they come they're ready to stay so
[0:39] but we got a lot of support for that but
[0:41] we'll be mindful of that if the lord
[0:43] comes in a certain way we want to be
[0:45] obedient to him
[0:46] but we are mindful of the time as well
[0:48] we want to leave enough time to for
[0:50] those who want to get down to lima today
[0:52] for the wedding um reception
[0:55] amen esther chapter 5
[0:58] and i hope i didn't forget any
[0:59] announcements there's quite a few today
[1:00] but
[1:02] my my dad's birthday is today so we give
[1:04] our prayers to my mom and i know she's
[1:06] had a rough few days missing him
[1:09] and so maybe at the end of the service
[1:11] mom you can come up and sing with me and
[1:12] we'll
[1:13] sing a little song there and of
[1:15] thanksgiving to the lord we appreciate
[1:17] his life
[1:18] what it represented to us we miss him
[1:21] dearly
[1:22] and but we we look forward to the
[1:24] reunion
[1:25] someday praise the lord
[1:28] esther did i say ezra did i say esther
[1:30] ezra
[1:32] i said esther so i'm in ezra and you're
[1:34] an esther
[1:36] so
[1:37] i have to get in it would help if the
[1:39] pastor got in the right book of the
[1:41] bible
[1:42] if he's going to preach
[1:44] amen
[1:47] esther chapter 5 and verse 1.
[1:51] now it came to pass on the third day
[1:54] that esther put on her royal
[1:57] apparel
[2:03] what we wear
[2:05] is important to the king
[2:10] came to pass on the third day that
[2:12] esther put on her royal apparel and
[2:14] stood
[2:15] in the inner court of the king's house
[2:17] so she's positioned herself
[2:19] in the inner court
[2:21] for the bride that's a good place to
[2:22] position yourself in the inner court
[2:26] she stood in the inner court of the
[2:27] king's house over against the king's
[2:29] house and this king
[2:31] sat upon his royal throne in the royal
[2:33] house over against the gate of the house
[2:35] and it was so when the king saw esther
[2:37] the queen standing in the court that she
[2:40] obtained favor in his sight how many
[2:42] this morning want to obtain favor in the
[2:45] eyes of the king
[2:47] she obtained favor because she was in
[2:49] the right place she was in the inner
[2:51] court she she was wearing the right
[2:53] apparel she had the heart that was right
[2:55] and she obtained favor in his sight and
[2:57] the king held out to esther the golden
[3:00] scepter that was in his hand and when a
[3:02] king back then would hold out the
[3:04] scepters one thing it represented all of
[3:06] his power all of his authority and when
[3:08] he held it out to somebody that was
[3:10] quite a significant event so he holds it
[3:12] out to his queen queen and uh
[3:16] the golden scepter that was in his hand
[3:17] so esther drew near and touched the top
[3:20] of the scepter that was a great act for
[3:23] her to touch and that means she shared
[3:26] the authority with this king she touched
[3:28] the symbol of his authority so it wasn't
[3:31] just his authority she had the same
[3:33] authority now
[3:34] then said the king unto her will thou
[3:37] queen what what wealth thou queen esther
[3:39] and what is thy request it shall be even
[3:44] given thee to the half
[3:46] of the kingdom if you wouldn't mind
[3:49] going forward to daniel chapter 7
[3:54] and we'll read these and get them out of
[3:56] the way and then we'll refer back to
[3:57] them through the sermon daniel chapter 7
[4:00] and verse 21 and 22 i beheld in the same
[4:04] horn
[4:05] made war with the saints and prevailed
[4:08] against them this is the antichrist
[4:09] spirit and the antichrist actually
[4:11] becoming incarnate beheld in the same
[4:14] horn made war with the saints and
[4:16] prevailed against them
[4:17] until the ancient of days came
[4:20] and judgment was given to the saints of
[4:23] the most high
[4:25] and the time came
[4:26] that the saints
[4:28] possessed the kingdom
[4:31] i love that scripture
[4:34] she hadn't the bride had an enemy can
[4:36] you say amen
[4:38] that the bride had an enemy that made
[4:39] war with the saints
[4:41] but the ancient of days came
[4:44] he gave the people susman he gave them
[4:46] judgment
[4:47] but it wasn't just they were given
[4:49] something the time came then for them to
[4:52] possess the kingdom that they were being
[4:54] given amen i believe it's time for that
[4:58] praise the lord i want to speak on the
[5:00] confession that releases more potentials
[5:03] the confession that releases more
[5:06] potentials
[5:07] father we pray you'll bless your word
[5:09] anoint us
[5:10] strengthen us for the
[5:12] many needs that are here today and
[5:14] listening online
[5:15] we pray that you give us the right words
[5:18] to encourage to strengthen to admonish
[5:21] that we leave here different people than
[5:24] when we came in we commit that to you in
[5:27] jesus name amen once you shake
[5:29] somebody's hand before you're seated and
[5:31] say god bless you
[5:40] personal victories i want to remind
[5:42] everybody that
[5:43] the goal of my preaching
[5:45] the gospel is for personal victories to
[5:48] take place
[5:50] so you should be praying with me that
[5:52] you have personal victories public
[5:54] victories are nice and they get a lot
[5:55] more praise and a lot more attention
[5:58] but personal victories are greater
[6:00] because god gets the glory can you say
[6:02] amen and that's why we preached
[6:05] and
[6:06] i've often said that my ministry is also
[6:10] to
[6:10] comfort the afflicted
[6:12] and afflict the comfortable
[6:16] amen
[6:17] so i've been thinking about
[6:19] since last sunday and then brother
[6:20] marcus preaching on esther wednesday
[6:22] night but i've been thinking a lot about
[6:25] how close that people can come
[6:29] to
[6:30] really receiving something from god
[6:33] and sometimes how that is held back
[6:37] uh sometimes that there's just something
[6:39] there that holds them back just from
[6:41] that step
[6:42] and i've been thinking about how close
[6:44] people can come and i i was thinking
[6:46] also sometimes it's it's just one small
[6:50] little thing
[6:51] that would actually take someone over
[6:53] the top and give them a breakthrough in
[6:56] a certain area
[6:57] and many times that person doesn't
[7:00] realize how uh small a lot of times we
[7:03] think of we're we we're so far from god
[7:06] and we're so far away and we're so and
[7:09] but sometimes and that may be true
[7:11] but remember god is always trying to
[7:13] bring united to him god is never pushing
[7:16] you off
[7:17] god is always orchestrating things in
[7:19] your life that you draw nigh to him but
[7:21] you have to act too and so the bible
[7:23] says draw nigh to him and he'll draw an
[7:26] eye to you so it's not just that he
[7:28] cares but do you care there's two parts
[7:31] to this he cares there's no question
[7:33] about that but does do you care do you
[7:36] care enough to come his direction do you
[7:38] care enough to get to say lord am i
[7:40] willing to give this up am i willing to
[7:43] to see this and many times friends i
[7:45] think it's a very it can be a very small
[7:47] thing that would just give a person a
[7:49] breakthrough in their lives and yet they
[7:52] hold back at that one little spot uh and
[7:55] and i find people
[7:57] that can stop short of their full
[8:00] potential they stop short or their full
[8:02] potential
[8:03] i think the holy spirit knows
[8:06] where he can take his people
[8:08] i think the holy spirit knows your life
[8:10] what's the amazing thing is that he's
[8:12] god he knows all things he knows your
[8:15] life he knows your background he knows
[8:17] your past he knows all things you don't
[8:19] know all things the person sitting next
[8:22] to you doesn't know your life they don't
[8:23] know all things but aren't you thankful
[8:25] this morning there's a person of christ
[8:27] that knows all things about your life it
[8:30] knows your victories it knows your
[8:31] failures it knows what happened with
[8:33] your parents it knows what happened in
[8:35] your past church life he knows all
[8:37] things about your life and incidentally
[8:40] because he knows all that he provides a
[8:42] way to escape all the harm and things
[8:45] that's come to your life including the
[8:47] sin in your life he's provided a way for
[8:50] all of that
[8:51] god knows your life god knows your
[8:55] biography god knows every part of it can
[8:58] you say amen and and he also knows your
[9:01] potential as a predestinated son and
[9:03] daughter of god he knows your potential
[9:06] he knows where the word he said he knows
[9:08] where it can take you sometimes he gives
[9:11] the pastor a little bit of a vision of
[9:13] where he goes because the pastor and the
[9:15] ministers were engrossed in this word
[9:17] and i'm not saying that you're not but
[9:19] we stay in the word all the time praying
[9:20] god help us to get a word of the lord
[9:23] for the people's lives but when we look
[9:25] at the word and sometimes when we look
[9:26] at people's lives and we look at you
[9:28] individually and i may not know your
[9:30] whole life but only what you share with
[9:31] me but i can tell you a pastor even can
[9:34] get a vision of where your life could be
[9:36] and sometimes it's a little discouraging
[9:38] because sometimes it's just a little
[9:40] thing that people went go go get over
[9:42] but if they'd get over that if they'd
[9:44] overcome that they wouldn't realize all
[9:46] the potential they have
[9:51] but god
[9:52] knows all of your potential
[9:55] god knows where this word can take you
[10:01] but people stop short of their full
[10:03] potential
[10:04] and if some knew how close they were
[10:06] maybe
[10:07] from getting the holy ghost
[10:11] they might fight harder
[10:14] if you knew how close you were you might
[10:16] fight harder and press in just a little
[10:19] more can you say amen and press through
[10:21] to get it am i that close let me press
[10:24] through to get it
[10:25] or if you have the holy ghost to press
[10:27] through for greater personal victory to
[10:30] press through to the next level to press
[10:32] through to the next victory can you say
[10:33] amen if you only knew you're not that
[10:36] far away but sometimes it's like
[10:38] breaking the sound barrier and i've
[10:40] talked about it before just before the
[10:42] sound barriers broke in a plane which i
[10:44] don't know how many miles an hour it is
[10:45] but once it breaks that but just before
[10:47] it that plane can shake a little bit
[10:49] it's a struggle and it's getting close
[10:51] to that and it's a real struggle just
[10:53] before it breaks the sound bearer and
[10:56] shoots out that's our lives and someone
[10:58] is shaky someone even in a service gets
[11:00] a little convicted of something but what
[11:02] you don't realize it's not condemnation
[11:05] it may be conviction the lord's saying
[11:07] if you'll just give this up if you'll
[11:09] just lay this down if you'll just
[11:11] surrender your life a little further
[11:13] you're going to break the sound barrier
[11:19] and then you look back after you're
[11:20] going
[11:24] your life is going
[11:26] and you look back and say wow i didn't
[11:28] know i was that close
[11:31] i didn't know what little things
[11:33] the devil
[11:35] was holding in my mind because remember
[11:37] the bible says he's the one who has
[11:39] strongholds in our lives
[11:41] strongholds holding you back
[11:45] and i didn't realize how much the devil
[11:48] was just holding that thing that small
[11:50] thing until i'd break the sound barrier
[11:53] and break through but we want to break
[11:54] through
[11:57] god has many breakthroughs
[12:00] for our lives
[12:01] you may be closer than you think the
[12:03] thing about a seed
[12:05] is that remember
[12:07] how many knows
[12:08] that in a little seed
[12:11] in that seed
[12:12] is all the potential
[12:14] of what that seed will be
[12:17] it's all laying there in potential form
[12:21] and uh it's such a small thing
[12:24] every apple
[12:26] uh
[12:28] every apple that a tree will ever
[12:30] produce
[12:32] every apple that a tree will ever
[12:34] produce
[12:35] is in that seed
[12:39] and that speaks of god's potentials it
[12:41] speaks of what sons and daughters can be
[12:45] it speaks of the enormous potentials
[12:48] that you can't even see in your life and
[12:50] where god wants to take your life as a
[12:52] son and daughter of god and the
[12:54] victories that you can find and and
[12:56] stamping and living a life with the
[12:59] devil under your feet
[13:01] how many would like to live a life with
[13:03] the devil under your feet
[13:07] but you see now the devil holds us back
[13:09] so every every apple a tree will ever
[13:12] bring is in the seed already it's this
[13:14] very small seed and he asked the
[13:16] question and i asked it yesterday i did
[13:18] some research a little research
[13:20] how many apples can that little seed
[13:22] produce in the lifetime of that tree
[13:25] and the average tree
[13:27] i have a picture of the seeds in an
[13:29] apple you don't need a picture you know
[13:30] what they look like
[13:32] but in a lifetime the average apple tree
[13:37] will produce 7 500 to 12 000 apples in
[13:41] its lifetime that's what we find in an
[13:43] apple
[13:44] and
[13:45] so
[13:47] something like this has the potential
[13:50] to produce in its lifetime
[13:52] up to 12 000 apples
[13:57] that's when you eat an apple you're
[13:58] looking at
[13:59] it speaks of god's potentials
[14:02] speaks of what the message can where the
[14:04] message can take you
[14:06] people are so limited in their knowledge
[14:08] it seems like of what we have in our
[14:10] hands with this message it's taken sons
[14:12] of god to their full potential it's
[14:14] taken sons of god to adoption we are in
[14:17] an adoption age an adoption of the
[14:20] church is not the birth of the church
[14:22] it's the maturity of the church it's
[14:24] coming to full maturity the sons of god
[14:26] are being restored back to adam and eve
[14:27] again with full power and authority
[14:31] am i in the congregation that believes
[14:33] these things this morning
[14:34] this small seed can produce up to 7 500
[14:38] to 12 000 apples in its entire lifetime
[14:41] this little seed so of course everybody
[14:43] has the question can you take just one
[14:45] of the seeds one of the seeds and and
[14:49] and plant one of them and would that
[14:51] grow into it and so they answer the
[14:53] question by saying there's possibilities
[14:55] that even one of the seeds in an apple
[14:58] if it's planted in the right place and
[15:00] if it's germatized correctly
[15:03] one of those seeds can produce up to
[15:06] thousands of apples
[15:10] that's the kingdom of god
[15:12] i don't know if you knew that you
[15:13] probably knew it because i'm still
[15:15] learning things you know you know
[15:16] everything but um i don't know if you
[15:18] knew that that's powerful
[15:21] that's powerful
[15:22] so
[15:23] they if you took that and it was
[15:25] dramatized right and remember you got to
[15:28] have moisture in the ground you got to
[15:30] have rain
[15:31] you've got to have the right kind of
[15:33] light
[15:34] it's got to be the right atmosphere
[15:36] if you think you're a son of god and not
[15:38] and be in the wrong atmospheres all the
[15:39] time you're not going to grow
[15:43] there are atmospheres that the sons of
[15:45] god live in in the word in the right
[15:47] congregation around the right people
[15:49] around the atmosphere of the holy ghost
[15:52] listening to the right music reading the
[15:54] right books can you say man reading the
[15:56] word of god reading the message of the
[15:58] hour and if you don't get in that
[15:59] atmosphere you're not going to grow that
[16:01] seed has to be germatized by the holy
[16:03] spirit
[16:04] if you're a seed of god
[16:06] and so that we know that if they plant
[16:09] that and it makes the right atmosphere
[16:12] to germatize then it comes up through
[16:13] the ground and it's called a seedling so
[16:16] it goes from a seed to a singling it's a
[16:18] little little uh plant that comes up to
[16:20] the ground that's how it starts so you
[16:22] go from the stage to a seed
[16:24] to a seedling
[16:26] and then it grows into a tree we're not
[16:28] we've got no apples yet
[16:30] we've got no apples yet
[16:32] but all the potential for possibly 12
[16:35] 000 apples is in this process
[16:39] that's why i don't believe that a person
[16:41] who receives the holy ghost at the altar
[16:43] one night
[16:45] has overcome everything yet
[16:49] but they certainly have the power to
[16:50] overcome everything
[16:53] when they get up from the altar
[16:54] pentecost taught us that everything's
[16:56] done now hey you spoke in tongues you
[16:58] got the holy ghost you're done you're a
[17:00] fully you're you're you're a finished
[17:01] product only you're only finished the
[17:03] product by the holy ghost sealing the
[17:05] devil out of your soul and sealing god
[17:08] in but you live in the flesh and you've
[17:10] got to grow to adoption and now you have
[17:12] the power to do it and it'll all depend
[17:14] on whether you yield to what's inside of
[17:15] you or
[17:16] not but all the potential of everything
[17:20] you'll ever be is in the spirit of
[17:22] adoption
[17:23] to be adopted you'd have to have the
[17:25] spirit of adoption i'm speaking out of
[17:27] romans right out of your bible we
[17:29] receive abba father we receive the
[17:31] spirit
[17:32] of adoption
[17:34] so that we can be adopted
[17:37] amen
[17:38] oh what happened to my seeds
[17:40] so it goes from the seed i should have
[17:42] got the other stages for you in pictures
[17:44] i didn't have time so you got the seeds
[17:46] you got the seed go to seedling it grows
[17:49] up to be a tree next stage is to grow
[17:51] into
[17:52] branches off the tree no apples yet
[17:55] branches off the tree but all the
[17:57] potential is still there for apples
[18:00] okay
[18:01] then it grows from
[18:03] the seedling to the branch branches come
[18:05] out of the tree and all of a sudden
[18:07] sudden something a little plant starts
[18:10] to butt off of the branch how many
[18:12] remember said jesus said i am the vine
[18:14] ye are the branches
[18:16] it's the bride that bears the fruit
[18:18] it's christ in the people that bears the
[18:20] fruit
[18:22] and then these these apples come out and
[18:23] they grow
[18:25] it's the
[18:26] process finally see some apples and that
[18:28] tree if it's been german charged right
[18:30] taking care of that tree is full of
[18:32] apples but guess what
[18:34] there's still potential for more apples
[18:39] so then the
[18:40] then the next stage is
[18:42] uh
[18:46] bennett's takes it and
[18:48] makes it into apple cider
[18:52] and apple donuts
[18:54] and apple cookies
[18:57] i just thought i'd mention it because
[18:59] god probably didn't endorse those stages
[19:03] but i like it anyway
[19:06] but look at all the benefit that comes
[19:07] from the
[19:08] apples it's like keeps going it goes
[19:11] into those you know it goes into that
[19:12] cider and all of us are over there i've
[19:14] been at barbecue or bitted
[19:16] cider orchard and we're getting that
[19:18] cider
[19:19] brother diggs comes to preach here just
[19:21] for that cider did you know that
[19:23] and the cookies and
[19:26] man
[19:27] but i don't know if god intended for
[19:29] that but i know he intended for it to
[19:31] produce apples
[19:34] and then then when it produces some
[19:36] apples
[19:38] then it dies in the winter time that
[19:40] tree dies and the sap goes down in it
[19:42] and so now it looks like there's the
[19:43] death and it's over it only produced
[19:45] about you know 200 apples it looks like
[19:47] it's over but it's not over the
[19:48] potential is not over
[19:51] and i'm here to tell you as a as a
[19:53] servant of god
[19:55] your potential is not over
[19:58] you have more potentials in you amen
[20:02] and no matter what you've been through
[20:03] and if you go through a death if you go
[20:05] through a dark time in your family if
[20:07] you go through a dark time in your
[20:08] spiritual walk if you're a seed of god
[20:11] you still have some potential in you can
[20:13] you say man that you can grow and
[20:15] produce so much more in christ than you
[20:18] ever dream can you say man
[20:21] to go on and produce possibly 12 000
[20:25] apples
[20:26] out of this one seed
[20:30] how about them apples
[20:36] there's a quote here look at this
[20:38] few things the prophet said what lays in
[20:40] the bride and then from a little group
[20:42] qualification for our visitors this
[20:44] morning i'll have a couple quotes here
[20:46] from different men one of them will be
[20:48] brother william branham you may not be
[20:50] familiar with that name but we quote
[20:52] from him a little bit because there are
[20:54] some scriptures that were fulfilled for
[20:56] the last days to restore us back to the
[20:57] word and so god spoke of jesus spoke of
[21:00] an elijah to restore all things we
[21:03] personally believe that god fulfilled
[21:04] that through his life but it's not about
[21:06] the man it's about what he restored us
[21:08] back to the word of god if you have more
[21:10] questions about that i am totally
[21:12] available to answer and show you those
[21:13] scriptures today but just so you know
[21:15] that's why we'll quote a little bit from
[21:17] him as well then from a little group of
[21:19] the true seed of the word god will
[21:21] present christ a beloved bride a virgin
[21:24] a virgin of his word and through them
[21:26] and by them the bride the bride now
[21:29] through them and by them it will be
[21:30] fulfilled all that was promised for his
[21:33] word in the virgin who knows no man-made
[21:36] creeds or dogmas they will love him love
[21:40] his uh they probably said love is the
[21:42] word there they will love and love his
[21:43] word and will have
[21:45] his potentials for he is their head and
[21:49] they are his subjects subject to his
[21:51] head remember the scripture i read last
[21:53] time he is the head but he is longing to
[21:55] get full preeminence in the body
[21:58] the head christ comes to us the word of
[22:00] god but now we come under the subjection
[22:03] of the full word of god and what's going
[22:05] to happen she has his potential
[22:10] not your potentials his potentials are
[22:13] in you can somebody say amen they will
[22:16] love him and will have his potentials
[22:20] how about them apples
[22:25] next quote says why this church
[22:28] ought to be a million miles up the road
[22:31] listen in 1963 the church ought to be
[22:34] millions of miles up the road to where
[22:37] it is now jesus is waiting on his church
[22:39] to get ready his bride has made herself
[22:42] ready how many knows the bible says that
[22:44] his bride has made himself ready we got
[22:46] the potentials the holy spirit is here
[22:49] god is here the power to heal the sick
[22:52] the power to do all things that christ
[22:55] did i've seen it demonstrated myself by
[22:57] the holy spirit so the potentials are
[23:00] here
[23:05] how about them apples
[23:07] can you say man
[23:09] he said all the potentials
[23:11] are already here
[23:13] i longed to see a church
[23:15] not bound by creeds and dogmas
[23:18] free in the holy ghost how many raised
[23:20] yet how long to see a church rise free
[23:22] of the holy ghost free in the holy ghost
[23:24] and manifest all of christ in this age
[23:28] from the healings from the supernatural
[23:30] to the adopted life of a mature
[23:32] lifestyle in the lord i long to see all
[23:35] of it
[23:38] how about another one want another one
[23:41] the next one let me say that again when
[23:43] this holy spirit has found you
[23:45] the individual and has come upon you
[23:48] it is the potential of your internal
[23:50] inheritance that god thought of you and
[23:53] made for you before the foundation of
[23:56] the world that is your potential how
[23:59] about them apples
[24:02] how about one more quote the power
[24:04] that's in you will make you could speak
[24:07] a world into existence and go live on it
[24:11] now how in the world
[24:13] can somebody say that
[24:15] only because of a revelation of that
[24:18] someone receives the holy ghost they're
[24:20] not receiving some third person of the
[24:22] trinity they're not receiving some other
[24:25] spirit than the original spirit of god
[24:26] than the real thing they're receiving
[24:28] god
[24:30] and uh if you take a spoonful out of the
[24:33] ocean of water every bit of the
[24:35] chemicals every bit of the things that's
[24:37] in the whole ocean is in that spoonful
[24:40] so if you have a spoonful of the power
[24:42] of the holy ghost then you have all the
[24:45] potential within that small spoonful
[24:51] the power that's in you you could speak
[24:54] a world into existence and go live in it
[24:57] hallelujah there you are how about them
[25:00] apples
[25:03] that's what power is in the church now
[25:06] but it is controlled by a law how many
[25:08] knows that we have laws to things
[25:10] the law of gravitation you can't get
[25:12] around it we're all here so we would
[25:14] have you see and we have the law of but
[25:16] he says now
[25:18] it's the law the law is not keeping a
[25:20] bunch of commandments
[25:22] it's the law of faith jesus said all
[25:24] things are possible to them that believe
[25:28] so our power that's within us is only
[25:30] limited by how much faith we have
[25:37] i said our power within us is only
[25:39] limited
[25:40] does anybody see here this morning that
[25:42] when he sends the holy spirit to your
[25:44] life
[25:45] it's not just to be a a benchwarmer at a
[25:48] church somewhere
[25:49] it's not to come a hearing sermon that
[25:51] stimulates your intellect
[25:55] god will use you being filled with the
[25:58] holy ghost to continue his kingdom
[26:03] being established in the earth
[26:06] not just a bench warmer in this case a
[26:08] cushion warmer
[26:11] god's called you for a reason
[26:14] god's not called you to be like the
[26:16] world
[26:18] he's called you to be different
[26:21] not to make yourself different you have
[26:23] the holy spirit it's to be different you
[26:24] have a different calling
[26:26] praise the lord
[26:28] should i go forward
[26:30] i wonder who would be behind
[26:34] holding back somebody's potential then
[26:36] who would be behind holding back
[26:39] somebody's full potential well it would
[26:41] if he says it's faith that it's the law
[26:43] of faith that restrains us and our faith
[26:45] is limited so if our faith grows then we
[26:48] grow into the full potentials more and
[26:50] more so who is it that stands in the way
[26:52] who is it it's our enemy it's the devil
[26:55] who is it that's behind the work of
[26:57] holding someone back from their full
[26:59] potential i look at husbands sometimes
[27:01] and i see they're they're they're
[27:03] blocked they're held they're coming to
[27:06] church they're raising their hands
[27:07] they're but they're they're they're
[27:09] stuck in a rut they're stuck there for
[27:11] years
[27:12] and even a desire to get out
[27:16] but your desire you have to put feet on
[27:18] your desire you have to put faith on
[27:20] your desire you have to do something
[27:22] about it
[27:25] because
[27:26] and say well who holds back from your
[27:28] full potential part of it is you
[27:31] people are afraid
[27:34] people don't have enough faith to step
[27:36] out
[27:39] people somebody's put in their minds
[27:40] that i don't want to become a religious
[27:42] fanatic in this message so i they hold
[27:45] back because they're afraid i don't want
[27:46] to be a religious and i want to be
[27:47] embarrassed and i don't want to act a
[27:49] certain way and i don't think that you
[27:50] should put those limitations on god
[27:54] but sometimes it's you because you're
[27:55] afraid you have a lack of faith to step
[27:57] out you won't get to your full
[27:59] potentials because
[28:01] you're not ready to be all into this
[28:03] thing but the enemy uh
[28:06] the enemy is the problem too because he
[28:08] does not want you to go to the next
[28:10] level he does not want you to feed on
[28:13] the word and become all that god's
[28:14] called you to be if
[28:16] and satan knows if faith ignites
[28:20] if faith ignites more faith ignites then
[28:23] it's going to unlock further potentials
[28:25] in you
[28:27] and somehow satan knows how that works
[28:30] after 6 000 years satan knows when
[28:33] people get faith in their position and
[28:35] they get faith in who they are in the
[28:37] word and they begin making decisions to
[28:39] confess and step forward satan knows
[28:42] that every time more potentials and more
[28:46] god comes out of their life and so
[28:47] that's why satan becomes the faith
[28:50] killer
[28:53] satan in your life is your faith killer
[28:56] he's not trying to get you to go out and
[28:58] smoke cigarettes and go out the no no
[29:00] he's trying to kill whatever faith you
[29:02] got and or limit
[29:04] keep you where you're at
[29:07] that's your enemy
[29:09] you're many of you you're at where
[29:11] you're at and uh and i was telling a
[29:14] brother yesterday i hate it when people
[29:16] cap out they've they've leveled out
[29:19] and yet they don't have to level out
[29:22] they've reached a certain level they're
[29:24] in a comfortable spot don't forget i'm
[29:26] the ones to to comfort the afflicted and
[29:28] afflict the comfortable i'm your i'm
[29:31] your friend today
[29:32] you may leave here and not think i'm
[29:33] your friend but i'm not here to just pat
[29:36] you on the shoulder and give you a nice
[29:37] little flowery sermon i'm here to
[29:39] challenge you this morning
[29:41] that you have more potentials
[29:44] and sometimes it's the enemy just
[29:46] holding you right there in your mind i
[29:48] wonder if i can trust wonder if i can
[29:50] hit i know i might have to give this up
[29:55] and you're like sometimes the rich young
[29:57] ruler when he weighed jesus said give up
[30:00] this
[30:01] and you have eternal life and he waited
[30:03] out
[30:04] and his riches
[30:06] was more important than eternal life
[30:08] in other words the rich young ruler
[30:11] thought more about what he would lose
[30:13] than what he would gain
[30:19] and he made a decision because he was
[30:21] thinking about his losses
[30:24] he thought it through
[30:26] i don't know how many minutes he stood
[30:27] there when jesus said that
[30:30] he won't ask for
[30:31] all of us
[30:32] to be different things sometimes he asks
[30:34] us to to get our goat a little bit and
[30:37] challenge us god doesn't do it to be
[30:39] mean
[30:40] but he does it to test you
[30:44] can i have an amen
[30:46] god doesn't put his finger on something
[30:48] in your life say that's that's not right
[30:50] he doesn't do it to be mean he does it
[30:52] to test you you're asking for more of
[30:54] god well how willing are you to get it
[30:57] so for the rich young ruler he may not
[30:59] ask us he asked him to give up all
[31:01] because he knew that's the thing he was
[31:03] tied to big time in his heart
[31:07] and he may not ask us to give up all of
[31:09] our riches of course
[31:11] none of us really have any
[31:13] so he's probably not going to ask us to
[31:14] give it up because most of us don't have
[31:16] it
[31:19] it was a joke
[31:23] how many minutes did he stand there and
[31:24] he's
[31:26] he's struggling it's just i've asked
[31:28] this i came and asked him for eternal
[31:30] life i came
[31:32] i'm the one desiring
[31:34] eternal life
[31:36] and jesus said okay you ask
[31:38] then he goes through the commandments
[31:40] you do this do that just do all the
[31:42] commandments and that was just the first
[31:43] test
[31:44] and he said man i've been doing that
[31:46] since i was a little boy
[31:47] i've been sticking with it man i've been
[31:49] doing these things
[31:52] and so he kept probing
[31:54] i've been doing all these laws since my
[31:57] youth and i still don't have eternal
[31:59] life
[32:00] interesting
[32:02] i've did all the right things for mommy
[32:04] and daddy
[32:05] but i do still don't have the holy ghost
[32:09] so because he kept standing there jesus
[32:11] said all right next step
[32:13] kind of like in prayer lines when you're
[32:14] praying for somebody and brother bryan
[32:15] was praying for people
[32:17] you get them up front
[32:18] and he say do you believe
[32:20] god
[32:22] do you many times he could tell they're
[32:23] a christian do you believe in god you
[32:24] and he took him through do you believe
[32:26] me to be god's servant and he would just
[32:28] take him because based on how the levels
[32:31] of their believing just like the choir
[32:32] saying believe for it
[32:35] based on the levels of their believing
[32:36] brother tony is based upon how much god
[32:38] was going to jump in and heal that
[32:40] person of cancer
[32:42] it's all by believing
[32:44] what's your level of believing this
[32:45] morning what's your level of surrender
[32:49] stood there a few minutes
[32:52] pondered i don't know how long but he
[32:54] weighed
[32:55] giving up this and and he weighed
[32:58] and he he was more interested in his
[33:01] losses and what he'd have to give up
[33:03] than what he would gain
[33:05] i wish she wouldn't do that this morning
[33:09] i wish you'd have a trust in the lord
[33:11] that if he asked you to give up
[33:12] something
[33:13] that you'd have a trust that what he's
[33:15] going to give you
[33:17] blows away
[33:18] what you gave up
[33:35] so if this is true that we're fighting
[33:37] against an enemy
[33:39] then we need to be
[33:41] more aggressive with the enemy
[33:45] we need to be sincere to put our finger
[33:47] on what satan's using to hold us back
[33:50] we need to know there's more of the
[33:52] kingdom there's more potentials there's
[33:54] more in me
[33:55] that satan is holding back
[33:57] and i read esther and i read daniel
[34:00] because both of those texts speak of
[34:02] esther coming to a change in a time
[34:05] where she would have to speak up
[34:07] and then daniel in prophecy the people
[34:10] would come to a time when the antichrist
[34:12] spirit come to a climax
[34:14] and i know that that scripture that i
[34:16] read in daniel is prophecy for after
[34:19] tribulation i understand that but
[34:20] because it says the ancient of days came
[34:23] and because we have a symbolism of the
[34:26] judge coming and looking down and he's
[34:28] got hair like wool like the old judges
[34:30] in england can you say man
[34:32] in other words he comes with supreme
[34:34] authority with the word of god in the
[34:35] last days and when he sends that
[34:37] authority and gives his authority to the
[34:39] church the next stage is it became time
[34:43] for the saints to possess the kingdom
[34:46] not just know about the kingdom not just
[34:49] know that he's given you something but
[34:51] you have to get aggressive to possess it
[34:53] to possess something means you take
[34:55] ownership to possess it means you take
[34:57] it for yourself your dad may get it your
[35:00] mom may not get it your your other
[35:02] friends may not get it but you have to
[35:04] say i'm taking a hold of this thing and
[35:06] i'm possessing this for myself in other
[35:08] words what god has given me it's my own
[35:10] it's mine i possess it i take it satan
[35:14] is robbing me from it and i will not let
[35:16] satan rob me from every blessing and
[35:19] every promise he's got i will not let
[35:22] satan do it any longer i'm stepping up
[35:24] to the plate and i'm taking hold of the
[35:26] full possession of god
[35:29] i'm willing in my heart to possess
[35:33] the gates of the enemy i'm willing to
[35:35] possess the inheritance i'm willing to
[35:36] take it and so we find daniel did that
[35:39] and i don't have much time on daniel
[35:40] today but let's go back to esther since
[35:42] brother marcus was on it wednesday night
[35:43] let's go back to her life a little bit
[35:45] and jump in there again and as we see
[35:48] the story of esther uh you know the
[35:50] story i thought it was so great
[35:51] wednesday night when brother mark said
[35:53] he said you know none of the bible
[35:55] commentators none of the other
[35:57] scriptures paul jesus none of them
[36:00] mention esther
[36:02] martin luther wanted to take the book of
[36:04] esther out he didn't see why it needed
[36:05] to be in the bible
[36:09] none of them talked about it and most of
[36:11] the jewish ones and all they want to
[36:12] take it out because it doesn't mention
[36:14] god in it at all it doesn't refer to god
[36:16] there's no god in it elohim's not there
[36:19] we have this book in the bible of all
[36:21] the books that mention god and
[36:22] everything it doesn't mean god it's just
[36:24] a story of a young girl but i can tell
[36:27] you this morning it's not just a story
[36:29] it's the mystery of the bride of jesus
[36:31] christ your life is written in that
[36:34] story
[36:35] your life is written in there
[36:40] because our biography is in this book
[36:45] your biography don't be looking online
[36:48] for your biography
[36:50] and don't take what your parents said
[36:51] about you and don't take your cues from
[36:53] the world and says you're this you need
[36:55] to wear this you need to do this that's
[36:56] not your life your life is hidden in the
[36:59] mystery of this book
[37:00] how many believe that our names are on
[37:02] the book of life before the foundation
[37:03] of the world and as he breaks the
[37:06] mystery of this bible you will see your
[37:08] name in the book that i'm not like the
[37:10] world i'm a son and daughter of god
[37:14] and when he breaks the ministry for your
[37:16] age and your time whatever the prophecy
[37:18] is for your time and you see that and
[37:20] you get into it i agree with it i'm a
[37:23] part of it and the very reason that i
[37:24] see it and want it
[37:26] shows that my name is in the book
[37:30] praise be to god i feel like shouting
[37:33] this morning
[37:34] i feel like running the aisles praise
[37:36] the lord
[37:38] i got my true biography and in the book
[37:40] of esther
[37:43] something happens after she has become
[37:46] the queen now you could tell the whole
[37:47] story if she's an unknown brother marcus
[37:50] was telling she comes up from you know
[37:52] nowhere and all these women are being
[37:54] tested to be the next bride
[37:56] they all get refused
[37:58] well first of all the
[38:00] the the first queen that he had
[38:02] a type of the denominational systems not
[38:04] the people
[38:06] vashtai was a type of denominational
[38:08] systems that turned down the husband
[38:10] christ
[38:12] in his request
[38:15] the king asked for something
[38:18] and the queen says
[38:20] i'm not coming i'm not doing it
[38:22] rebellion in the systems of denomination
[38:26] it's a type it's all type
[38:29] make it simple for the children
[38:32] the king says to the servant
[38:35] tell the tell the
[38:38] queen to make me a sandwich
[38:42] and the servant runs over to vashti says
[38:44] the king said to make you make him a
[38:47] sandwich
[38:48] and the queen says tell the king to make
[38:50] his own sandwich
[38:56] and the servant goes okay
[38:58] but i don't think the king is going to
[39:00] like it
[39:05] and the king didn't like it
[39:08] so on that day the way they had set
[39:10] things up says she's not even honorable
[39:12] as the queen if we let her do this all
[39:14] the women of the land is going to do
[39:15] that to their husbands
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] and
[39:20] now this girl they begin choosing and
[39:22] this hebrew girl comes up she comes to
[39:25] the process
[39:26] and mordecai is wondering what's going
[39:28] on mordecai her cousin's gonna what's
[39:30] going on this is exciting i think
[39:33] and so then she gets chosen he refuses
[39:35] all the other hundreds of women and she
[39:37] chooses this girl and a young
[39:39] jewish
[39:41] girl a nobody
[39:42] rises within just 30 40 60 days probably
[39:45] rises from a nobody to be the queen of
[39:48] the entire kingdom
[39:50] who is that
[39:51] the bride of jesus christ
[39:56] see you don't need to read a bunch of
[39:59] interpretations of the bible you just
[40:01] need to read your bible and ask god to
[40:02] reveal it to you because the greatest
[40:04] mysteries lie right in here and she is
[40:06] the bride right to the place so here she
[40:08] is now sitting in the palace as the
[40:10] bride with the kingdom of god and and
[40:13] exercising the authorities of the queen
[40:14] she's the bride it is not a matter of
[40:16] her coming to the lord
[40:18] it's our type of coming lord it's not
[40:19] she's already the bride she's knows
[40:21] everybody she's been chosen she's been
[40:23] called she's in her position as the
[40:24] bride
[40:26] but notice it's not over
[40:29] she's bright but her potentials are
[40:32] still there
[40:33] there's more potentials for esther
[40:37] oh come on now friends
[40:39] she's already bride and she's shouting
[40:41] she's bride and morgan your bride your
[40:43] bride morgan said can you believe this
[40:45] your bride your bride and the king is
[40:47] saying you're my bride you're my bride
[40:49] and says she responds amen hallelujah
[40:52] i'm the bride i'm the bride
[40:55] i wonder how many conventions that we go
[40:58] to i'm bright i'm bright preach the
[41:00] bride and that's wonderful i'm not
[41:01] knocking them but listen even with her
[41:03] position as a bride she still had an
[41:06] enemy
[41:08] she still had an enemy to overcome
[41:10] there's still potentials for her
[41:12] authority laying in her she's still
[41:14] going to use her authority for a greater
[41:15] way somebody say amen
[41:20] already bright but she's not reached her
[41:23] full potential yet even though she's
[41:25] going to a message church and she's
[41:27] going to
[41:28] she's she's claiming to be bride that's
[41:30] fine and she is
[41:32] but it's not done because you haven't
[41:34] reached your full potential
[41:40] a lot of families sitting around
[41:43] within the presence of god within the
[41:45] atmosphere of god
[41:46] tremendous families holy ghost families
[41:49] but i can tell you
[41:51] there's something holding them back and
[41:53] they haven't reached their full
[41:54] potential
[42:00] and you have to realize esther
[42:02] she said these words because mordecai
[42:04] said wait a minute now wait a minute you
[42:06] know what haman's trying to do you know
[42:08] i know your bride esther
[42:10] but maybe god's put you there
[42:13] for more than just to sit in the palace
[42:17] amen
[42:20] mordecai i wonder for such a time as
[42:22] this
[42:23] i wonder if god's put you here
[42:26] to exercise more authority here
[42:29] i thought you were just this is a great
[42:31] thing
[42:31] i wonder if you're to be more than just
[42:33] attending all the message conventions
[42:35] and hearing your bride i wonder if you
[42:37] have more potentials than that
[42:41] i wonder if it's you know not as
[42:42] important to be accepted and to be
[42:45] acknowledged by everybody on the
[42:46] internet and
[42:48] and and and just everybody knows that
[42:50] you know i go to this church and i do
[42:52] this i wonder if there's something
[42:53] deeper that god wants to do in your life
[42:56] than to worry about what everybody else
[42:57] is thinking and praises from other men
[43:00] and i hope people think i'm this and i
[43:02] hope people think i'm that i wonder if
[43:04] you'd step lay that aside and say god
[43:06] has a purpose for putting me in this
[43:08] position
[43:16] and mordecai says now i'm worried now i
[43:19] need to pray pray i'm going to pray it
[43:21] says the aster sends a message to her
[43:24] suppose god has set you up for some at
[43:26] such a time as this and you know what
[43:27] astrid said she said
[43:30] and no mordechai said to her
[43:33] if you
[43:35] hold your peace
[43:37] at this time
[43:40] it's gonna be bad
[43:42] so that's why i titled this confession
[43:46] to bring us to more potentials because
[43:48] he said
[43:50] if
[43:51] and you're allowed you can hold your
[43:52] peace but if you hold your peace
[43:55] this enemy is not going to be taken care
[43:57] of
[43:59] if you hold back and you just leave
[44:01] things the way they are and you don't
[44:02] act because you're the only one who has
[44:03] the authority to act
[44:06] if you don't act and if you hold your
[44:07] peace and you think keep things covered
[44:09] up in the family and you keep things at
[44:11] bay and you keep it
[44:13] if you keep doing that you're going to
[44:14] be the same way 10 years from now
[44:19] if you hold your tongue esther
[44:23] i don't mean hold the tongue if you hold
[44:24] your peace if you don't say something
[44:28] and this is where i was going to read
[44:29] the book of james where it says james
[44:32] says if any be sick let them call for
[44:34] the elders of the church
[44:37] it goes on a couple verses and he says
[44:39] confess your faults one to another
[44:42] and pray for one another it doesn't say
[44:45] to god it says to one another
[44:50] and pray
[44:51] and the effectual fervent prayer of a
[44:54] righteous man will go a long way
[44:57] availeth much but he's in the process of
[44:59] talking about praying for the sick how
[45:02] many knows that when someone's sick it's
[45:03] a demon
[45:06] the doctor calls it what do you call it
[45:07] but when someone's sick or cancer cancer
[45:09] is a demon
[45:11] kova is a demon
[45:12] don't forget that
[45:14] and we the church are called to pray
[45:16] against demons
[45:17] to cast out demons
[45:19] now do all that you have to do and you
[45:21] know i believe god can heal through
[45:22] medicine i believe that well i'm not
[45:24] condemning anybody today for medicine or
[45:26] anything like that but don't forget
[45:27] don't forget we're not called to just
[45:29] give in to all the science and say i'm
[45:31] going to lean on all the science we're
[45:33] called to deal with demons
[45:36] we're called to pray the prayer of faith
[45:37] over demons so if he says if someone's
[45:39] sick let them call for the elders of the
[45:40] church anointing them with oil and the
[45:42] prayer of faith shall save the sick when
[45:43] you're praying you're actually playing
[45:45] with authority over demons to drive them
[45:47] away
[45:48] so somehow he brings in here our
[45:50] confession it says confess your faults
[45:52] one to another so if he brings that in
[45:55] there's something related to
[45:58] demons and the devil not liking open
[46:02] confession
[46:05] why do we need to do that
[46:08] james i mean i know you're
[46:10] the do it guy and you're the
[46:12] you're from missouri the show me state
[46:14] james is from the show me state he says
[46:17] i know you got christ but let me see it
[46:19] in actions given to your brother he's
[46:20] from the show he said let me see
[46:23] he's the one that said show me your
[46:26] faith by your works let me see something
[46:28] in your life you've got faith let me see
[46:30] the results so he's a results-oriented
[46:32] preacher
[46:34] and he's saying hey listen confess your
[46:37] faults because there's something related
[46:39] to dealing with demons that confessing
[46:42] and being open
[46:44] even to one another
[46:45] tends to expose the enemy
[46:48] and he starts shaking in his boots
[46:53] there's something about repentance
[46:55] true repentance there's something about
[46:56] confession that's related
[46:59] to us breaking down the barriers
[47:02] to get to more potentials
[47:05] so she says she said pray fast she does
[47:08] all the things she she says mordecai set
[47:11] your people to prayer we're going to
[47:12] fast she and this is how you approach
[47:14] when you're really attacking an enemy
[47:16] like haman
[47:17] we're going to do things
[47:19] we're going to
[47:20] she starts the process of dealing with
[47:22] her enemy she starts by prayers by
[47:23] fasting by sincerity i want to see a
[47:26] real change here and i'm going to go see
[47:28] the king i'm going to go see the king
[47:30] she's going to the right place
[47:34] hallelujah
[47:38] she realizes that
[47:42] naaman
[47:44] an enemy
[47:46] has a place
[47:48] in the king's kingdom
[47:50] and he doesn't belong
[47:53] and she goes no wait a minute wait a
[47:54] minute no no
[47:57] haman doesn't have a place in the king's
[47:59] kingdom
[48:00] he has a place in my kingdom
[48:03] because
[48:04] his kingdom
[48:05] is my kingdom
[48:10] it's not lord did you know haman is over
[48:12] there and he's in your kingdom he's
[48:13] going to disrupt things no it's her
[48:16] kingdom too
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:19] his kingdom
[48:20] is my kingdom and guess what i've got an
[48:23] enemy in my kingdom and unless i open my
[48:25] mouth and do something about it to the
[48:27] king he's going to stay right down in
[48:30] that and agitate and torment because
[48:32] remember a demon is a tormentor another
[48:34] name for a demon is tormentor and he's
[48:36] going to torment and he's eventually
[48:38] going to try to destroy my people
[48:40] destroy me when he finds out i'm a jew
[48:42] he's going to be and so listen before
[48:44] this even gets going and in place
[48:46] i have got to step forth in the presence
[48:48] of the king
[48:50] at the risk of being killed herself
[48:51] because it wasn't right for anybody to
[48:53] come before the king
[48:55] but she steps out do you understand
[48:57] people there has to be a stepping out in
[48:59] faith even when you're afraid
[49:03] i don't know what's going to happen beer
[49:04] but i'm i'm so interested in my enemy
[49:07] being destroyed i've got to step out in
[49:10] faith
[49:13] praise the lord
[49:17] i gotta step out and say she just comes
[49:18] in with the right apparel because the
[49:21] king's interested in the right apparel
[49:24] and that one sentence you
[49:26] sisters and brothers should catch a
[49:28] revelation
[49:30] the king is interested in what you wear
[49:38] amen he has a bible for it
[49:41] men are to dress like men
[49:43] women are dressed like women
[49:45] and there's a bible for it
[49:47] men are to be men
[49:49] and women are to be women
[49:51] it's just that simple in the bible
[49:54] so she has the right apparel royal
[49:55] prayer she steps in the inner court
[49:58] the prophet taught us about the don't be
[50:00] in the outer court don't be in the
[50:01] outside don't the outer
[50:03] in the court holy of holies she got in
[50:05] the right court and the king notices her
[50:07] after a while
[50:08] she has favor with the king and this is
[50:11] a process she invites him over she comes
[50:13] over but she's still a bit scared she
[50:15] doesn't tell the king about it she
[50:16] doesn't expose him then but later on she
[50:19] exposes i'm gonna try to finish this up
[50:21] real soon so i still have your attention
[50:25] so so now
[50:27] she is calling her enemy and the king
[50:30] together to expose him to say something
[50:33] and nobody else is going to do this she
[50:35] has to do it right
[50:37] she has the authority to she has the
[50:38] favor of the king to do it
[50:40] she didn't have to do it
[50:43] but she's recognizing more of her
[50:45] potentials
[50:47] she is position yourself
[50:51] and the king holds out all the authority
[50:53] to her
[50:54] thank god that he did
[50:57] and she has the potential to use that
[50:58] authority
[50:59] to destroy this enemy to confess it to
[51:01] say it to not be silent
[51:03] to confess to speak openly
[51:06] is anybody catching something here this
[51:08] morning you can stay bound your whole
[51:10] life by things but i can tell you you
[51:11] get honest before the lord let me give
[51:13] you some homework
[51:15] i want everybody this week to listen to
[51:17] he cares do you care
[51:19] how many would listen to it and i want
[51:22] you to watch in that how
[51:24] the first part of it there's a couple
[51:26] incidences of people who had something
[51:28] happen in their past
[51:30] and they become a craving to a craving
[51:32] to go to god and be delivered because
[51:33] their past is binding them
[51:35] one woman it was something happened he
[51:36] didn't tell what it was and then there
[51:38] was a
[51:39] a young minister who had just started
[51:41] speaking just got married and he was
[51:42] bound by some complex that happened in
[51:44] his past so they said i'm bound i'm
[51:46] nervous about this they come for prayer
[51:49] and they meet with them god shows them
[51:50] clearly what it is they get delivered
[51:53] and the prophet kind of get felt let of
[51:55] god that there's something
[51:57] churning in me about this subject he
[51:59] cared he care god cared for their
[52:01] situation god cared about their past god
[52:03] cared to see them delivered
[52:05] so he goes into this subject the first
[52:07] part of it is how much god cares now
[52:10] that's kind of a no-brainer to us
[52:11] christians if i said does anybody know
[52:13] god cares everybody raise your hand
[52:16] that's a no-brainer because but the
[52:17] title of the message is not that he just
[52:19] he cares
[52:21] he cares
[52:22] but do you care
[52:26] because you got to get those two things
[52:28] together that you're really sincerely
[52:31] wanted to be sincerely want to be
[52:32] delivered and you're sincerely
[52:34] confessing it
[52:36] you got to bring those two things
[52:38] together and then the devil doesn't like
[52:39] it there's going to be deliverance
[52:42] god can show he cares over and over
[52:44] again in these services he can love you
[52:47] he can show he cares he can you can have
[52:49] something hip in your life and you say
[52:50] god really cared for me he watched over
[52:52] me on that that i could have had an
[52:54] accident today and god was watching over
[52:56] he cares he cares and cares but what
[52:58] about what you care about
[53:02] do you care to live this life do you
[53:04] care to overcome things in your life
[53:07] now we're talking some power
[53:10] and so go through it and then he comes
[53:11] to this crossing over to do you care and
[53:14] he goes right into the subject of
[53:16] confession he said one of the great
[53:18] lacks in the church today is a lack of
[53:21] sincere not just confession sincere
[53:24] confession
[53:25] and repentance
[53:28] so i'm saying it's not just that you
[53:30] hear all that you need to be delivered
[53:32] from and all the glorious things and all
[53:34] the voices in the world and you sit in
[53:35] church and you know that's right that's
[53:37] right that's right that's right there
[53:39] has to be another step so the enemy is
[53:42] destroyed in your life
[53:45] so you read that how many will read it
[53:47] and watch how he goes into that how
[53:50] important our confession is
[53:53] to god
[53:54] amen
[53:55] and to one another
[53:57] this is what exposes the enemy the devil
[53:59] don't like it
[54:02] so the king holds out his authority to
[54:04] esther
[54:05] basically he's saying esther
[54:07] what do you need esther
[54:09] the ball's in your court no just kidding
[54:12] esther
[54:14] the next move is yours
[54:17] that's great when the lord says that
[54:22] and in the next few days she stops
[54:24] holding her piece about it
[54:26] she confesses
[54:28] she exposes haman
[54:31] and then at the end of her life she's
[54:33] given more authority and more potentials
[54:36] to do even more for her people as you'll
[54:39] see in your bible at the end she
[54:42] rewrites the law
[54:45] the king does it she bible says she
[54:48] wrote with all authority
[54:51] and she saved all of her people
[54:56] now she couldn't have done that without
[54:58] destroying her enemy first
[55:04] confession friends
[55:06] that's why i said last sunday
[55:08] sometimes a simple little thing
[55:13] of a husband who's got things to confess
[55:17] in his
[55:18] pornography his hidden life is
[55:21] destroying his family it's destroying
[55:22] his wife it's destroying the marriage
[55:25] and he just keeps going and keeps going
[55:26] keeps going
[55:29] and sometimes just
[55:32] a man recognizing god help me
[55:34] you sit down with that wife that you've
[55:37] committed to for life right
[55:40] you're not shifty eyed and bouncing
[55:42] around you sit with her and you look her
[55:43] in the eye
[55:45] say honey
[55:47] i love you
[55:48] but i've done some mistakes
[55:51] i've messed up
[55:53] this is the way the prophet described it
[55:54] he just said if i went and did that
[55:56] overseas i took an overseas mission trip
[55:58] and i was unfaithful
[56:00] he's talking about their confession he
[56:02] said i don't come back and just assume
[56:04] that she's gonna be fine with it oh
[56:07] honey and you know i i kissed another
[56:09] girl and it's and you're flipping about
[56:11] no no no no that doesn't work
[56:13] you come with sincerity you come with
[56:16] brokenness
[56:17] i'm ready to prepare to expose this
[56:19] whole thing in my life and first to my
[56:20] wife because i've damaged her by doing
[56:22] it
[56:23] you look her in the eye
[56:25] and you repent before her
[56:27] you know i don't promote movies a lot
[56:29] there's there's very few movies that a
[56:31] christian can watch
[56:33] but that one fireproof there's one part
[56:36] i love and fireproof talks about
[56:38] here i am promoting a movie so you have
[56:40] to edit that part out i don't know but
[56:42] i like to pronounce something that's
[56:43] good but sometimes in our ranks it's
[56:45] it's not
[56:46] so
[56:49] there's one part i really like because
[56:50] this marriage is about ready to break up
[56:54] and
[56:55] it's a mess you know they're a young
[56:57] couple and they're just fighting
[56:59] and there's things going on behind the
[57:01] scenes and he's doing pornography on the
[57:02] computer and nobody knows what the
[57:04] tension is but it's just and she's
[57:06] getting she's filing the divorce papers
[57:08] and it's just this thing is ending it's
[57:10] over and so through
[57:12] uh
[57:13] i can't remember his father or mother he
[57:15] goes through this process of
[57:18] learning some things himself and how he
[57:19] needs to be delivered and all these
[57:20] other things and so
[57:22] uh
[57:23] but when he comes and repents to her
[57:26] when he comes she gets sick she's in the
[57:28] bed and so he's going to take care of
[57:30] her and she don't she don't buy any of
[57:32] this stuff that he's doing he's bought
[57:33] her flowers 40 days have given her
[57:36] things he's trying to restore and she
[57:38] hasn't bought into any of it i don't
[57:40] know why you're doing this i'm still
[57:41] getting the divorce it's over i don't
[57:43] trust you anymore
[57:45] and all this time he's given gifts but
[57:47] this day she gets sick and he's trying
[57:48] to take her he brings her soup or
[57:49] something
[57:50] in the bed
[57:52] and he gets down on his knees and she
[57:54] starts crying
[57:55] and she says
[57:58] why are you doing all this
[58:00] i don't trust you why are you doing this
[58:04] i just i just
[58:05] i don't know what i'm going to do but i
[58:07] don't trust you and i just she's just
[58:08] way distant and what i like about his
[58:11] repentance the next few minutes and you
[58:13] you watch it or you don't have to watch
[58:15] i'm not promoting something but i'll
[58:17] just tell you
[58:18] this
[58:19] was probably the best act in a movie of
[58:22] someone who's sincerely just weeping
[58:25] sincere
[58:26] i've done this
[58:28] i have hurt you and he just weeps at the
[58:30] foot of her bed just weeping to her
[58:33] and you can tell it's just from the
[58:35] sincerity of his heart but what i like
[58:38] about it is at the end he's saying
[58:40] she said well i just need time i just
[58:42] need time and he says you take all the
[58:45] time that you need
[58:48] amen a person that's repenting
[58:52] is not looking for a quick band-aid
[58:55] and to get back to everything as usual
[58:59] because he's hurt somebody
[59:01] he's hurt his whole his marriage and in
[59:03] a lot of cases they hurt the entire
[59:04] family it's time to bring it to the
[59:06] forefront and expose the enemy
[59:09] this might be uncomfortable so i don't
[59:11] know but i'm just
[59:13] i love you enough to be honest about it
[59:15] you see i really do
[59:16] and he says that to her and and when the
[59:19] prophet describes if he'd come back from
[59:21] overseas oh girl you you know you're my
[59:23] buddy and he's just this flippant
[59:25] repentance she's not going to accept
[59:26] that but when he goes to say no you
[59:28] should i have failed you and he says
[59:30] these words he says you you may not even
[59:32] stay with me over this.
[59:37] so he's given that person the liberties
[59:39] i'm the one that's done the hurt i'm the
[59:41] one that's done the pain and i may lose
[59:43] my entire family over this and my
[59:46] marriage and if that happens so be it
[59:49] because i'm the one that's done wrong
[59:52] is anybody listening to what i say
[59:56] now we're talking some real real deep
[59:58] repentance because it's not repentance
[1:00:00] with something attached to it and if
[1:00:02] you'll do this part we can make this
[1:00:04] work
[1:00:06] no no it just needs to it needs to be
[1:00:08] presented that i have done this
[1:00:11] and i'm fully making it right and i want
[1:00:14] to move forward
[1:00:15] but i'm giving you all the time that you
[1:00:17] need and honey i love you and i have
[1:00:20] obviously i don't love you right because
[1:00:22] i've done these things
[1:00:24] but i want to love you deeper i put it
[1:00:26] in your hands and he describes a sincere
[1:00:30] confession
[1:00:31] that's
[1:00:32] what we need after we hear the word of
[1:00:35] god
[1:00:39] that's when this church will start
[1:00:42] getting
[1:00:43] to its full potential of what a church
[1:00:46] should be
[1:00:49] we're doing great we got loveliest
[1:00:51] people in the world all the new ones the
[1:00:53] ones have been from day one from the
[1:00:56] best people in the world i love you guys
[1:00:58] to death and i'm
[1:00:59] i know i'm going to spend eternity with
[1:01:01] you but i'm going to tell you the truth
[1:01:03] we are not reaching our full potential
[1:01:05] of how a body should function
[1:01:10] some of us because somebody just holds
[1:01:12] back
[1:01:12] but when you start applying what i'm
[1:01:15] preaching i do believe
[1:01:16] there's going to be some things that
[1:01:18] happen just say
[1:01:19] god's really working more and more in
[1:01:21] our
[1:01:22] midst and he does that and he says i'll
[1:01:25] give you the liberty whatever you feel
[1:01:27] to do
[1:01:28] it'll be
[1:01:29] it'll be fine
[1:01:30] i just i just love that
[1:01:33] look her in the eye
[1:01:34] your children
[1:01:36] you sit them down and look them in the
[1:01:37] eye
[1:01:40] somebody in the body of christ that
[1:01:42] you've hold resentment to for years
[1:01:45] how can you let that go on
[1:01:48] how can you distance yourself and label
[1:01:50] that person i don't need to speak that
[1:01:51] person ever again how can you do that
[1:01:55] so what you're saying is that the devil
[1:01:57] between you stays right there and i'm
[1:01:59] comfortable with him there because i'm
[1:02:02] right in there wrong
[1:02:08] when there's a real true repentance
[1:02:10] there's a flow of his holy spirit it
[1:02:11] just washes
[1:02:14] things away
[1:02:17] you have to die to a lot of pride to do
[1:02:20] the things that i'm talking about
[1:02:24] but i don't want to be business as usual
[1:02:28] i don't want it to be church as usual
[1:02:31] because we've got something great that
[1:02:33] god has given us
[1:02:36] the ancient of days has come and given
[1:02:38] us his word
[1:02:40] now it's time
[1:02:42] for the saints
[1:02:44] to possess this kingdom
[1:02:47] you guys got those quotes as we close on
[1:02:49] repentance i think it's some charles
[1:02:51] spurgeon
[1:02:54] charles spurgeon is a
[1:02:56] minister
[1:02:58] you know 100 years ago maybe more
[1:03:00] he's the prince of preachers
[1:03:02] can i have five more minutes
[1:03:05] is that all right with everybody all
[1:03:06] right
[1:03:07] then i'll just read these quotes of
[1:03:09] spurgeon we're closing the prince of
[1:03:10] preachers he was called he did not start
[1:03:12] out that way charles heiden's burden's
[1:03:14] grandfather who preached for more than
[1:03:16] 50 years so charles spurgeon's
[1:03:17] grandfather preached for 50 years his
[1:03:19] dad preached for 16 years and they were
[1:03:21] in this dissenting congregate
[1:03:23] congregationalist church ministers of
[1:03:26] puritan heritage in essex england little
[1:03:28] charles grew up in both mances hearing
[1:03:30] the gospel many times and loving to read
[1:03:32] books a spiritual benefit i just want to
[1:03:33] point out charles spurgeon grew up in a
[1:03:36] christian home that got constantly
[1:03:37] christian teaching all the time he
[1:03:39] easily memorized the catechism and all
[1:03:42] isaac watts hymns his mother taught him
[1:03:44] in the bible and prayed with him for him
[1:03:45] daily although taught by two anglican
[1:03:48] rectors at the age of 14 both of whom
[1:03:50] pressed him with the gospel he still
[1:03:52] denied owning christ as a savior
[1:03:54] spurgeon describes himself as that time
[1:03:56] as a as careless and mischievous but not
[1:03:59] truly born again he said he hoped that
[1:04:01] god so all that background he didn't
[1:04:03] give himself the credit that he was born
[1:04:05] born again yet just because he was
[1:04:06] raised right and he lived a good life
[1:04:09] he said
[1:04:10] i love all this this is great thank you
[1:04:12] but i'm not born again yet
[1:04:14] that's honest
[1:04:19] he said he hoped that god would save him
[1:04:20] someday he knew the gospel well but his
[1:04:22] heart was cold toward the lord he did
[1:04:24] not associate with evil peers or
[1:04:25] participate in wayward activities but
[1:04:27] still would not repent of his sins on
[1:04:29] january 6 1850 young spurgeon was
[1:04:32] supposed to join his father at the
[1:04:34] church on sunday morning nine miles from
[1:04:36] his home he was supposed to be in his
[1:04:38] daddy's church service
[1:04:41] and because of a severe snow storm he
[1:04:44] ducked into a primitive methodist chapel
[1:04:48] in our literary street close to his home
[1:04:51] likely few people in england possessed
[1:04:53] as much knowledge of the scripture heard
[1:04:54] the gospel more times than charles
[1:04:56] spurgeon
[1:04:57] he stated in his autobiography that i
[1:04:59] had heard the plan of salvation by the
[1:05:01] sacrifice of jesus from my youth up but
[1:05:03] i did not know any more about it in my
[1:05:06] innermost soul than if i had been born
[1:05:08] and bred a hot and taught
[1:05:11] he had heard that primitives he had
[1:05:14] heard that primitive sang so loud it
[1:05:16] made your headache
[1:05:19] that might be what you feel about our
[1:05:21] church here
[1:05:23] he had heard these methodists
[1:05:26] saying so loud that it gave him a
[1:05:27] headache but he didn't care he said i
[1:05:29] wanted to know how i might be saved and
[1:05:32] if they could tell me i didn't matter if
[1:05:35] my headache from the music
[1:05:40] he's not even getting saved at his dad's
[1:05:42] church
[1:05:44] no he didn't
[1:05:46] the pastor was a no-show from the big
[1:05:48] snow but a layman got up
[1:05:51] and read look unto me and be saved all
[1:05:54] the ends of the earth for 10 minutes in
[1:05:56] broad essex england the man invited the
[1:05:59] hearers to look to jesus
[1:06:02] and he says i saw at once the way of
[1:06:05] salvation for myself
[1:06:08] and the holy spirit who enabled me to
[1:06:11] believe gave me peace through believing
[1:06:14] following his re-baptism because he was
[1:06:17] re-baptized and joining a church
[1:06:19] spurgeon was then called to preach and
[1:06:22] after that led thousands of souls to the
[1:06:25] lord
[1:06:30] praise
[1:06:30] god he got it for himself
[1:06:35] and it wasn't through his dad's ministry
[1:06:41] went on to be called the prince of
[1:06:42] preachers
[1:06:44] and here's another thing before i read
[1:06:45] what he says about repentance
[1:06:48] i believe this is the one
[1:06:50] that preached repentance so strong
[1:06:53] and said that it's not just you repent
[1:06:55] when you gift your heart to the lord but
[1:06:57] a christian's life
[1:06:58] is full of repentance
[1:07:02] all the time repenting
[1:07:04] that's what people forget
[1:07:06] a real baptist way no offense to the
[1:07:08] baptist but it's just once they do that
[1:07:09] once saved always saved they gave their
[1:07:11] heart to lord that's it it's done no no
[1:07:13] this is a life of repentance this is a
[1:07:15] life of laying down your life
[1:07:18] we've got to get out of those doctrines
[1:07:20] can you say even with the holy ghost
[1:07:21] once i got it that night everything's
[1:07:22] done no no no no you begin a life of
[1:07:25] overcoming
[1:07:27] and they say he preached responses so
[1:07:29] strong in his ministry that he retained
[1:07:31] about 95 of his converts
[1:07:34] because he kept repenting
[1:07:37] repentance preaching it to the people
[1:07:40] that they were a people that knew
[1:07:42] how to sincerely repent
[1:07:45] if you take some of the other ministers
[1:07:46] they didn't
[1:07:47] retain that many converts that they got
[1:07:49] including billy graham because maybe
[1:07:51] back in the 60s there was a comment that
[1:07:53] says he says i go in billy graham said
[1:07:55] this i go into a city and i have 30 000
[1:07:57] people come to the altar i come back in
[1:07:59] a year and i can't find hardly any going
[1:08:02] on with the lord
[1:08:03] he says it's different billy graham says
[1:08:05] it's different than when paul was around
[1:08:07] he'd come out and preach to five people
[1:08:08] and come back and there'd be five
[1:08:10] thousand the next year
[1:08:12] there's something wrong with how we're
[1:08:14] presenting this thing and i think some
[1:08:15] of it is there's not enough genuine
[1:08:18] repentance after the word is preached
[1:08:20] charles spurgeon says repentance grows
[1:08:22] as faith grows do not make any mistake
[1:08:24] about it repentance is not a thing of
[1:08:26] days and weeks a temporary penance to be
[1:08:28] got over as fast as possible
[1:08:31] no it is the grace of a lifetime like
[1:08:34] faith itself god's little children
[1:08:36] repent and stowed to young men and
[1:08:38] fathers repentance is the inseparable
[1:08:40] companion of faith how many want more
[1:08:43] faith this morning
[1:08:45] some of you all right how many want more
[1:08:47] faith this morning
[1:08:49] praise the lord next quote another proof
[1:08:51] of the conquest of a soul for christ
[1:08:53] will be found in a real change of life
[1:08:57] if the man does not live differently
[1:08:59] from what he did before both at home and
[1:09:02] abroad his repentance needs to be
[1:09:05] repented of
[1:09:08] and his conversion is a fiction
[1:09:12] brother brown says false teachers
[1:09:14] produce false births
[1:09:16] people think they had a birth but they
[1:09:17] didn't really get them because you can't
[1:09:19] see it in the lifestyle
[1:09:21] oh boy that's you think i'm a hard
[1:09:23] preacher good grief the prince of
[1:09:25] preachers here's laid it down pretty
[1:09:26] strong
[1:09:28] his repentance needs to be repented of
[1:09:30] you need to repent of that repentance
[1:09:33] sincere repentance is continual
[1:09:35] believers repent until their dying day
[1:09:39] this dropping well is not intermittent
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:44] sincere repentance is continual after
[1:09:48] faith comes repentance or rather
[1:09:49] repentance is faith twin brother and is
[1:09:53] born at the same time
[1:09:55] repentance
[1:09:57] and desires after holiness
[1:10:00] can never be separated
[1:10:04] you have a desire for more of god
[1:10:06] you have a desire for more holiness
[1:10:09] never separate it from repentance
[1:10:13] repentance and faith our faith are
[1:10:15] distasteful to the unregenerate the
[1:10:17] unbeliever they would
[1:10:18] would sooner repeat a thousand formal
[1:10:21] prayers than shed a solitary tear of
[1:10:24] true repentance
[1:10:26] pretty strong i think this is the last
[1:10:28] one take your heart in prayer to him
[1:10:31] who understands it and say lord cleanse
[1:10:33] it lord renew it lord work repentance in
[1:10:37] it
[1:10:38] that's a good prayer
[1:10:40] because it's god that leads a person to
[1:10:42] repentance did you know that you can't
[1:10:44] mechanically just do something in your
[1:10:46] head the bible says god leads you to
[1:10:49] repentance so your prayers say god give
[1:10:51] me a broken heart give me true
[1:10:54] repentance
[1:10:56] the more you try to produce
[1:10:58] emotions penitent emotions in yourself
[1:11:02] the more you will be disappointed
[1:11:04] however if you believingly think of
[1:11:06] jesus dying for you repentance will
[1:11:09] burst forth
[1:11:11] is that the last one
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:15] that's my last one too
[1:11:17] let's stand and pray together
[1:11:28] we're going to pray
[1:11:34] and i believe that
[1:11:36] it's not the position of the body it's
[1:11:38] something my dad said his birthday i'll
[1:11:40] say something my dad said
[1:11:41] it's not the position of the body it's
[1:11:43] the condition of the heart
[1:11:45] so you're welcome to come this morning
[1:11:47] and pray up here but it's all about
[1:11:49] what you speak to him even in your seat
[1:11:52] right there
[1:11:54] i love you all and i'm going to pray
[1:11:55] with you
[1:11:57] but can you remember that
[1:11:59] you have
[1:12:01] more potentials in you of christ
[1:12:05] you have so much more potentials
[1:12:07] if we're good parents we tell our kids
[1:12:09] that
[1:12:10] we tell our children that we know they
[1:12:12] have a lot more potential with them and
[1:12:14] they're acting terrible
[1:12:15] sometimes
[1:12:17] but you know they have more potentials
[1:12:19] because god's made them
[1:12:21] so if that's true of our children we
[1:12:22] tell them i can tell the sons and
[1:12:24] daughters of god you have so much more
[1:12:26] within you
[1:12:27] what
[1:12:28] enemy is holding it back and could it be
[1:12:32] that you come along with you sometimes i
[1:12:34] like people to come up and pray because
[1:12:35] you know what you're challenging the
[1:12:38] devil that's holding you back together
[1:12:40] with me or another ministry you're
[1:12:41] challenging him and saying i mean
[1:12:43] business to run this devil off
[1:12:46] you can do that with your wife at home
[1:12:48] you can do that with your children you
[1:12:49] can say i'm challenging this enemy who's
[1:12:52] hurting our family i'm going to
[1:12:53] challenge them and expose them by
[1:12:55] confession so that the potential my
[1:12:57] family can grow
[1:12:59] so i tell you this is a church that
[1:13:02] there that if you can pray about this
[1:13:05] and say lord bring me a true heart of
[1:13:07] repentance when the word is preached let
[1:13:09] me not just nod in agreement but let me
[1:13:13] truly repent if i have done something
[1:13:16] wrong or if i have a habit in my life
[1:13:18] something's been laying there 20 years
[1:13:20] and i haven't dealt with it god
[1:13:22] don't let me hang on to it
[1:13:25] let me be honest enough to confess that
[1:13:27] more potential can come out i'm going to
[1:13:29] pray for you how many raise your hand
[1:13:30] pray for me brother paul
[1:13:32] can you bow your heads with me
[1:13:36] mom i want you to is my mom here

[1:13:52] life so much even as a christian that i
