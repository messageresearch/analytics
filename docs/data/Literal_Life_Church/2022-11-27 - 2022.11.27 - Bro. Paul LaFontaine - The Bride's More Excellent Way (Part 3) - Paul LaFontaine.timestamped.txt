[0:00] rest in every situation of life that it
[0:03] it that it would be projected and when
[0:05] Divine love is not just in your heart
[0:07] say well I love everybody and I love the
[0:09] Lord but it's when Divine love is
[0:11] projected Sovereign Grace takes over and
[0:14] and I want to be a vessel this is my
[0:16] desire through this I want to be a
[0:18] vessel that eventually the only response
[0:20] that comes out of this vessel my lips my
[0:23] mind everything and my reaction to
[0:25] anybody my only reaction is is saturated
[0:29] with the Lord's Divine love there's no
[0:31] other response that comes out of this
[0:33] vessel that's my desire and so we'll go
[0:36] back into it this morning and we we are
[0:38] looking forward to What the Lord Has for
[0:40] us we're not under expectation for
[0:43] another big healing or national Revival
[0:45] Revival but we do look for a final
[0:49] glorious victory in Divine love can you
[0:51] say amen and this is the more excellent
[0:53] way I'm not going to read the scripture
[0:55] but this series comes from the more
[0:57] excellent way that Paul said as he was
[0:59] talking about the gifts and correcting
[1:01] the gifts and all the wonderful things
[1:03] that's in the church the nine spiritual
[1:05] gifts and in his in the midst of
[1:07] correcting all of it he has First
[1:09] Corinthians 13 was it's a unique chapter
[1:11] in the middle of all the the gifts and
[1:14] things being displayed in the Corinthian
[1:16] Church he said covet the best gifts and
[1:19] you know the scriptures so I'm just
[1:20] quoting it to you covered earnestly the
[1:22] best gifts and yet I show unto you a
[1:25] more excellent way and I believe that
[1:27] excellent way is the bride's Victory I
[1:30] believe we're to come to it Genesis 26
[1:31] and verse 1 and there was a famine in
[1:34] the land beside this the first famine
[1:36] that was in the days of Abraham and
[1:38] Isaac went unto abimelech King of the
[1:41] Philistines into career and the Lord
[1:43] appeared unto him and said go down go
[1:46] not down into Egypt dwell in the land
[1:48] which I shall tell thee of sojourn in
[1:50] this land and I will be with thee and
[1:52] will bless thee For unto thee and unto
[1:55] thy seed I will give all these countries
[1:57] and I will perform the oath which which
[2:00] I swear unto Abraham thy father and I
[2:03] will make thy seed to multiply as the
[2:05] stars of heaven and will give unto thee
[2:07] thy seed all these countries and in thy
[2:10] seeds shall all the nations of the earth
[2:12] be blessed this is the same blessing
[2:14] that came on his father Abraham and now
[2:16] God revisits him because how many know
[2:19] that the blessings of Our Father Abraham
[2:21] falls on all his seed after him are ye
[2:24] Abraham seed this morning so when God
[2:26] visited us through the message of the
[2:28] hour through his Prophet he's
[2:29] reiterating the same thing that he's
[2:31] saying to Isaac the same blessing that
[2:33] come for it Abraham is coming on you and
[2:35] he's echoing it again to him verse 4 or
[2:39] verse 5 because that Abraham obeyed my
[2:41] voice and kept my charge and my
[2:43] Commandments my statues my laws and
[2:45] Isaac dwelt in Greer and the men of the
[2:48] place asked him of his wife and he said
[2:50] she is my sister for he feared to say
[2:52] she is my wife lest said he the men of
[2:55] the place should kill me for Rebecca
[2:57] because she was a she was fair to look
[2:59] upon and came to pass when he had been
[3:01] there a long time that benaught king of
[3:03] Philistines looked out at a window and
[3:05] saw and behold Isaac was sporting with
[3:07] Rebecca his wife and abimelech called
[3:10] Isaac and said behold of a surety she is
[3:13] thy wife and how sayest thou she is my
[3:15] sister and Isaac said in him because I
[3:18] said lest I die for her and abimelech
[3:21] said what is this thou has done unto us
[3:23] one of the people might lightly have
[3:25] lion with thy wife and thou shouldest
[3:27] have brought guilty guilt guiltiness
[3:30] upon us and abimelech charged all his
[3:33] people saying he that toucheth this man
[3:34] or his wife shall surely be put to death
[3:37] then Isaac sowed in that land and
[3:39] received in the same year a hundredfold
[3:41] and the Lord blessed him so I want you
[3:43] to notice now an elected Abraham seed
[3:45] coming but he has to go because of the
[3:48] famine down into Greer and these other
[3:50] places that are that will become
[3:52] difficult places because you're going to
[3:54] run into jealousy and you're going to
[3:56] run into trouble and you're going to run
[3:58] into problems and you're you're going to
[4:00] be run into reactions of people because
[4:02] you're not in your own land you're
[4:04] having to go into places like you have
[4:07] to go into places of life that are not
[4:10] going to be the best response even
[4:12] though you're the Blessed of God
[4:14] so this is a type now in Isaac's life
[4:16] it's a type of the Bride now because we
[4:18] are certainly not in our homeland right
[4:20] now
[4:21] spiritually we are but we're not in our
[4:23] homeland yet so we're living in every
[4:26] day in Satan's Eden we're living in a
[4:28] career we're living in a a place where
[4:30] you're not going to be accepted and
[4:32] there's going to be all kinds of
[4:33] situations happen in your life just
[4:36] simply because you're blessed and you're
[4:38] the promised of God and when you get
[4:40] into those situations you're going to
[4:42] have reactions from people what I want
[4:43] you to notice in this is Isaac's
[4:46] reaction to all of it because we can't
[4:49] change what the world treats us like
[4:52] what our trials treat us like but we can
[4:56] change or God can change how we react to
[4:59] all of it
[5:00] and in type
[5:03] Isaac is the love type of God he's the
[5:05] love and that's why I'm reading him
[5:06] because brother Brown says Abraham was
[5:08] Faith Isaac was love Jacob was Grace and
[5:11] Joseph was Perfection and so now in the
[5:14] love look at his response verse 13 and
[5:16] the man whacks great and went forward
[5:18] and grew until he became very great so
[5:21] Isaac was being blessed in these
[5:22] situations no matter what he was
[5:24] prospering I may believe you can prosper
[5:26] spiritually in any situation
[5:29] for he had possessions of flocks and
[5:31] possession of herds and great storm
[5:32] servants and the Philistines envied him
[5:35] okay there's the jealousy the Envy for
[5:37] all the wells which his father's
[5:39] servants had digged in the days of
[5:40] Abraham his father in the Philistines
[5:41] had stopped them and filled them with
[5:43] her and abimelech said unto Isaac go
[5:45] from us for thou art much mightier than
[5:48] we so he just sends him away sends Isaac
[5:50] away and Isaac notice now no response he
[5:54] said look what I'm doing here I I'm I'm
[5:57] prospering here if they had to pay taxes
[5:59] then it's like you could say sometimes I
[6:01] want to say to townships and different
[6:03] ones you know we pay taxes here and
[6:05] you're making us feel unwelcome and he
[6:07] could have responded but Isaac didn't
[6:08] respond to any of it you know what he
[6:10] just polite he said all right I'll move
[6:11] on to another piece of land here
[6:15] and Isaac departed this and pitched his
[6:17] tint in the valley of Greer and dwelt
[6:18] there and Isaac did begin the wells of
[6:20] water which they had digged in the days
[6:21] of Abraham his father noticed these are
[6:23] his possession that's it's Abraham he
[6:26] dug these well for the Philistines had
[6:28] stopped them after the death of Abraham
[6:29] and he called their names after the
[6:31] names by which his father had called
[6:32] them and Isaac's service digged in the
[6:35] valley and found their well-springing
[6:36] water so now once he starts digging
[6:39] these old Wells out then he starts to
[6:41] find water none of these guys could find
[6:43] that so he's blessed in fine water you
[6:45] can imagine how the jealousy just keeps
[6:47] Rising my goodness look what he's doing
[6:49] they become jealous and envious and
[6:51] start to turn against them even more
[6:53] Isaac's servants digged in the valley
[6:55] and found there as well springing and
[6:57] the Herdman of Greer did strive with
[6:59] Isaac's Herdman saying the water is ours
[7:02] and he called the name of the well esek
[7:04] because they strove with them and that
[7:06] means that they want to defuss they
[7:08] wanted to Stew they wanted to argue they
[7:10] wanted to have Strife they wanted to get
[7:12] mad they they were jealous and they
[7:15] wanted to cause arguments you know
[7:17] Thanksgiving can be a good time but it
[7:19] can be a bad time with family members
[7:21] sometimes when everybody wants to just
[7:23] form arguments
[7:26] there's people that feel like they're
[7:27] called in life to fuss and stew and
[7:31] strive
[7:32] and Uncle so and so is always trying to
[7:35] stir up something
[7:37] can't stop that
[7:39] got to invite Uncle so and so
[7:43] but we can pray and say Lord help our
[7:45] responses
[7:47] and they digged another well and strove
[7:50] for that also and he called the name of
[7:52] it sitna and he removed from thence and
[7:55] digged another well and for that they
[7:57] strove not and he called the name of it
[7:59] rehabath and he said for now the Lord
[8:01] hath made room for us and we shall be
[8:03] fruitful in the land and he went up from
[8:05] thence to Beersheba and the Lord
[8:07] appeared unto him the same night and
[8:08] said is the Lord appearing to him again
[8:10] I am the god of Abraham thy father fear
[8:13] not for I am with thee and will bless
[8:15] thee and multiply thy seed for my
[8:18] servant Abraham's sake I know I'm taking
[8:19] a while here but I'm getting this now
[8:21] I'm preaching on this now so I won't
[8:23] have to come back to it but I want you
[8:25] to notice in the midst of a trial in the
[8:27] midst of people wanting to argue people
[8:29] want to fuss Express every other thing
[8:31] but love Isaac expresses it and right in
[8:34] the middle of that God Appears to him
[8:36] again and encourages them in I'm with
[8:39] you doesn't God do that with you
[8:42] sometimes
[8:43] if we're faithful to say Lord I want to
[8:45] walk with you and and give the right
[8:47] response back to people and give Divine
[8:50] love back to people when they're fussing
[8:52] and acting a certain way and treat them
[8:54] with respect the lord loves that and the
[8:57] Lord comes on the scene to Isaac said
[8:59] Don't Fear I am with thee I Will Bless
[9:01] thee and multiply thy seed for my
[9:03] servant Abraham say and he builded an
[9:05] altar there and called upon the name of
[9:06] the Lord and pitched his tent there and
[9:08] there Isaac service dig the well then
[9:10] abimelech went to him from Greer and has
[9:12] us one of his friends and file and the
[9:15] chief captain of his army and Isaac said
[9:17] unto them wherever Come Ye to me coming
[9:20] back again to fuss with them
[9:22] seeing ye hate me and have sent me away
[9:25] from you you're the one that sent me
[9:28] away you're the one that's expressing
[9:30] hatred here why are you coming out to me
[9:32] again and that's the way spirits will do
[9:35] in your life they're going to keep
[9:37] coming after you you've expressed love
[9:39] they're going to keep coming and keep
[9:41] coming and agitating and wanting to fuss
[9:44] with you can you say Amen Isaac's
[9:47] response was only one response because
[9:49] he expressed the mystery of divine love
[9:51] and that is that no matter what they do
[9:55] I'm going to stay in my calling God's
[9:58] chosen me I if they asked me to move
[10:00] I'll move over here and do my work
[10:01] diligently for the Lord and his promise
[10:04] I'm going to live in his promise and
[10:06] whatever I do I don't want to react and
[10:08] be like them
[10:10] and I'll get in some scriptures today
[10:12] that show us Paul said in the New
[10:14] Testament is that when we as Christians
[10:16] begin to react and act like the world
[10:18] and our responses we're in we're in a
[10:21] bad place
[10:23] because we are not called to react like
[10:25] they react
[10:26] we're not called to blow off in our
[10:28] anger can you say Amen as uh Wesley's
[10:31] song said he takes away if you let him
[10:33] he'll take away all that
[10:36] take away your anger take away your
[10:38] bitterness that's what we want we want
[10:40] God to take it away and our response
[10:42] cannot be like the world our response
[10:45] must be the love of Christ that's within
[10:46] us can you say Amen
[10:48] father bless the word today I pray
[10:50] you'll help us and strengthen us anoint
[10:51] us Lord as we look to it and may every
[10:54] person here listening and streaming in
[10:56] different places Lord even if we don't
[10:58] know them even if they're an unbeliever
[11:00] whoever is listening I'm praying that
[11:03] your anointing would get behind our
[11:05] words today and that you would call that
[11:07] heart closer to you father you have a
[11:10] calling for them you have something for
[11:11] them maybe they just don't know it yet I
[11:14] pray the anointing of God would reach
[11:16] out and get a hold of their hearts we
[11:18] commit the service to you in this day to
[11:20] you in the name of Jesus Christ we ask
[11:22] it amen amen you may be seated
[11:28] I'd like to open this morning with the
[11:30] fact that all of us know that well not
[11:33] everybody might know but most of us
[11:34] Believers here know that God has been
[11:37] building a masterpiece God throughout
[11:40] history of the Old Testament was
[11:42] actually building towards something and
[11:45] when he came to his final Masterpiece
[11:47] it's kind of like a sculptor he takes
[11:49] many many years and a sculptor would
[11:51] take and God was taking through the Old
[11:53] Testament many many years until he got
[11:55] to his final Masterpiece in Jesus Christ
[11:57] I like to say it this way in the Old
[11:59] Testament God was trying to say
[12:01] something unless you have spiritual
[12:03] discernment it's hard to read the Old
[12:04] Testament but when you have Revelation
[12:06] the whole entire book of books of all
[12:09] the Old Testament God is trying to say
[12:11] something and he was trying to say
[12:13] something he's trying to say something
[12:14] in types and shadows and lives but then
[12:17] when Jesus came on the scene Jesus was
[12:19] what God was trying to say
[12:22] Jesus was the Masterpiece that God was
[12:25] building all through the Old Testament
[12:27] can you say amen and he come to his
[12:29] final Masterpiece and this would and
[12:31] think about what he was building a man
[12:33] like us he was virgin board but he was a
[12:36] man like us God came down and became us
[12:37] and God actually put his fullness within
[12:40] that man that God could express himself
[12:42] on Earth and see what God would look
[12:44] like on the face of the Earth that's was
[12:46] God's mystery is they would come down
[12:48] and express himself to man so that was
[12:50] God's Christ was God's Masterpiece all
[12:53] the character of God all the love of God
[12:55] all everything that was God he poured
[12:57] into that physical vessel and it was
[12:59] expressed to the world so everything was
[13:02] a build up in the Old Testament to get
[13:04] to that final Masterpiece but God's work
[13:07] did not stop there just like God did not
[13:10] stop his work in the Garden of Eden when
[13:12] he stopped with Adam he didn't stop with
[13:15] Adam there was another mystery that was
[13:17] there was another Masterpiece to be
[13:19] formed not just Adam how many knows he
[13:22] didn't stop it Adam there was an eve
[13:24] that was to become a masterpiece too and
[13:26] she was part of the whole mystery of God
[13:28] and so just like he did he took Eve out
[13:31] of Adam now when he finishes with Jesus
[13:34] Christ two thousand years ago as his
[13:36] Masterpiece not his final Masterpiece
[13:38] but his Masterpiece now he takes out of
[13:41] the side of Jesus Christ you wonder why
[13:43] the the there's the types and shadows
[13:45] and things that we can look at but he
[13:47] takes that spear that Roman surgery and
[13:49] he puts it up in into Christ into his
[13:52] side and blood and water comes out of
[13:54] Christ and spirit comes out of him and
[13:56] we know he gives up the ghost he raises
[13:58] on the third day but then something
[14:00] happened his Spirit did not just go up
[14:02] into heaven his Spirit came back on a
[14:05] group of people what was God doing God
[14:08] was bringing Eve out of Adam
[14:12] God was beginning to form a woman of
[14:16] many membered bride just like he did
[14:19] taking Eve out of Adam now he was going
[14:21] to form a many member body that would be
[14:24] the next Masterpiece can you say man and
[14:27] these would not be virgin born these
[14:30] would be sin born people that have such
[14:33] a new birth in their life they would be
[14:35] transformed by the power of God and they
[14:38] have the potential now to become Sons
[14:41] and Daughters of God and express the
[14:43] Masterpiece of God to this world oh I
[14:46] just explained to you God's full mystery
[14:48] can you say Amen that God did not stop
[14:51] with Jesus Christ but he wanted to have
[14:53] a bride and now here we are two thousand
[14:56] years after that and I can tell you God
[14:59] is culminating this statue this this
[15:03] image this masterpiece and he's doing it
[15:06] not in a building like this not in
[15:08] fineries of churches but he's doing it
[15:11] in people
[15:14] praise the Lord he's doing it in a
[15:16] people he's going to have a bride
[15:17] Ephesians he'll have a spotless bride
[15:20] without wrinkle without blemish Washed
[15:22] by the Water of his word we're coming to
[15:24] the final climax of a people that are
[15:27] the full expression of the image of God
[15:31] praise the Lord that might not be shout
[15:33] and material this morning but it should
[15:34] be
[15:36] we should say praise the Lord if you've
[15:38] got a heart to listen to the word today
[15:39] you can say I'm a part of that work I'm
[15:42] a part of that forming
[15:43] but you see there's one thing about a
[15:45] sculptor and I didn't have much time to
[15:47] look it up you can look it up you know
[15:48] you can go and find sculptors and how
[15:50] long they take and all their work and I
[15:52] didn't realize till last night there's I
[15:54] didn't didn't bring it with me but
[15:55] there's several stages that a sculptor
[15:58] that's like Michelangelo or someone like
[16:01] that when they're going to do a statue
[16:02] there's several stages that they go
[16:05] through and you can read those stages
[16:06] there's many stages they go through to
[16:09] get to the final product can you say man
[16:11] there's many different facets and phases
[16:14] and things that they do and so you can
[16:16] learn things from that because we
[16:18] realize God is our great Michelangelo
[16:21] God is our great architect God's our
[16:23] great sculptor can you say amen and he
[16:25] over time forms this Great Masterpiece
[16:29] and he does it to his certain way but
[16:31] it's just like a natural sculptor we can
[16:34] learn so much about God in our lives and
[16:37] somebody one of our missers ought to
[16:39] preach a sermon and just take all the
[16:40] stages of a sculptor but we can assume
[16:43] some things about a sculptor that we
[16:46] know if it's a really great statue like
[16:48] Michelangelo did some we know that it
[16:51] takes years to do it it doesn't take a
[16:53] week it doesn't take a month it doesn't
[16:56] take a year I was in the Vatican and
[16:59] scene of my some of Michael I was I was
[17:01] I seen a bunch of stuff that you've done
[17:03] and I guarantee you there are countless
[17:05] years that the sculpture took of working
[17:08] on it and working on it and working on
[17:10] it until he got to something you know
[17:12] what he got to he had a vision already
[17:15] in his mind what that was supposed to
[17:17] look at and and it looked like and he
[17:19] kept working on it and chiseling it and
[17:22] working on it until finally someday the
[17:25] vision that was already in his heart
[17:26] finally one day after years he sees the
[17:29] vision right in front of him in a statue
[17:31] I'm telling your friends the same God is
[17:34] working in our lives can you say amen
[17:36] and it may take years but if you'll
[17:39] submit to him he'll keep chiseling he'll
[17:41] keep working because why our God has a
[17:44] vision in his mind can you say Amen of
[17:47] what we're supposed to come to
[17:50] I just want to tell you this morning if
[17:52] you're listening wherever you're
[17:53] listening why don't you give up and let
[17:55] God work through me as a pastor and
[17:58] these ministers and the five full
[17:59] ministry and the prophet of the hour
[18:01] through the message why don't you quit
[18:03] haven't you had enough years where this
[18:06] world has formed you into dirt trash
[18:11] in jail
[18:13] divorce
[18:16] haven't you had enough of drugs and
[18:18] abuse and torn up families haven't you
[18:22] had enough of this Satan's Eden and
[18:24] Satan forming your life into addictions
[18:27] and depression and all kinds of things
[18:29] and sin and dirtiness and pornography
[18:32] haven't you had enough of Satan forming
[18:35] you why don't you give up and let the
[18:38] Great
[18:39] sculpture take over your life
[18:42] why don't you come to this church and
[18:45] come to another Bible believing church
[18:46] and listen to God and listen to what
[18:48] God's speaking through the ministry let
[18:51] him start reforming your life
[18:55] why don't you just sit still a while
[18:58] become a one service and that's it you
[19:00] know you you really want to go back to
[19:03] what's been forming you in your life
[19:05] why don't you sit still a while
[19:07] and let the Sculptor
[19:10] begin to form your life
[19:12] into something different
[19:15] one of the things the prophet said he
[19:16] said you can't if you can just get the
[19:18] bride to sit still long enough it isn't
[19:20] this super Supernatural thing just to
[19:22] get them to sit still
[19:24] and let God do the work over time can I
[19:28] get any help this morning
[19:31] maybe that's such a supernatural thing
[19:32] is you can't get people to sit still
[19:35] and be consistent with the word of God
[19:37] and let this word do its sculpting work
[19:41] the bride needs to just sit still and
[19:43] let God do the work people can't sit
[19:46] still alone people can't even sit for an
[19:48] hour and listen to the word we have a
[19:50] national problem and it's it's add
[19:56] and we have ADD we have a lot of
[19:58] children add we have medicines for it
[20:00] but we have spiritual add the attention
[20:02] span the attention span for people
[20:05] listening to the word of God is almost
[20:07] nothing
[20:08] but oh you can watch a movie for two
[20:10] hours
[20:12] oh you could be on the internet for
[20:14] three hours and we're like well what
[20:16] happened to the time
[20:17] oh you can go here and you can go there
[20:20] and you can listen to this and you give
[20:22] your full attention to what the
[20:24] Kardashians are doing
[20:27] Keeping Up with the Kardashians and
[20:30] people will not give a half hour to open
[20:32] up their Bible an hour to pray can you
[20:35] say Amen to listen to the word to come
[20:37] be faithful and bring their family to
[20:39] church to sit still
[20:41] you know you expect a two or three or
[20:44] four year old
[20:45] to wiggle in church
[20:47] you know they don't know what's going on
[20:49] all they see is a guy up here yelling at
[20:51] him
[20:52] and you know I try to keep their
[20:54] attention that way but it doesn't work
[20:55] you can understand a three or four year
[20:57] old or sometimes a 10 year old they're
[21:00] wiggling I'm ready to go but it's a
[21:03] problem of this generation they can't
[21:05] sit still
[21:07] and just listen to the word of God and
[21:10] let it see it's not just a sermon I'm
[21:12] preaching the Holy Spirit could get a
[21:14] hold of me and say something that could
[21:17] transform your life
[21:18] and if you're not listening it's sitting
[21:20] still and you can't take out of the week
[21:22] you know it's amazing to me that they
[21:25] people can't take one day Sunday and
[21:27] take off of work and take off everything
[21:29] else and give one's one day undistracted
[21:32] only to the Lord and only to Fellowship
[21:35] I still don't understand that Hobby
[21:37] Lobby can do it
[21:40] and they're blessed Chick-fil-A can do
[21:43] it and they're blessed and I always
[21:45] thought my first thought is I get mad
[21:46] because I head to Chick-fil-A on Sunday
[21:48] and forget they're closed and my first
[21:50] thing is I get upset and then I get
[21:52] happy because I realize somebody's
[21:53] applying a principle of God there needs
[21:56] to be a day that we set aside
[21:59] for just sitting still
[22:01] and resting
[22:03] if your boss tells you you have to you
[22:05] don't have a choice
[22:06] but in most cases we have a choice
[22:09] oh that's another sermon and I better
[22:11] stick with this one here
[22:14] but it's irritating people can't sit
[22:15] still long enough so I got to get move
[22:17] it along here but you see now uh when
[22:19] you have a sculptor number one we can
[22:21] assume it takes years how many would say
[22:23] Amen it takes years it takes many types
[22:26] of tools
[22:28] there's big tools that take big chunks
[22:30] there's little tools fine tools we
[22:33] consume it goes through many stages of
[22:35] cutting chunks are taken off and little
[22:37] carvings and then just little areas
[22:39] which something you feel like who've
[22:40] been in the way of the Lord a little
[22:42] while is what I felt like the last uh
[22:44] two or three weeks here maybe a month
[22:46] God dealing with things in my life very
[22:48] very secret things and he just takes
[22:50] that little chisel and the thing he
[22:52] thought you're pretty good you're doing
[22:53] pretty good in your Christian walking
[22:54] then the Lord just says but but what
[22:56] about this I'm going to just shave that
[22:58] off
[22:59] because oh Lord help me please and I've
[23:03] been down a little bit but at the same
[23:04] time I've learned let God do it let him
[23:07] dig it out
[23:09] let him carve that little thing because
[23:11] if it brings me closer to my goal a
[23:13] Divine love coming from this vessel I'll
[23:15] take the carving
[23:16] just that little
[23:18] it might feel like your pastor's like
[23:19] that I'm just got that little tool I'm
[23:21] just I'm just digging right in that
[23:24] little spot
[23:26] but I love you
[23:28] I really do it's not me it's the Lord
[23:31] that loves you
[23:32] you think I know everything I don't know
[23:34] everything God knows everything though
[23:37] and if people come and counsel stuff
[23:39] that's wonderful but most times if we
[23:42] just pray and let the Lord deal with us
[23:44] he'll speak things across the pulpit
[23:46] you get well that man didn't know about
[23:48] that and he gets right down in those
[23:50] little areas and exposes it say now I
[23:53] got I got to cut that off because it
[23:54] doesn't match the vision of what you're
[23:56] supposed to be God's got a vision of
[23:58] what you're supposed to be
[23:59] and you ain't there yet
[24:01] you think you're there and you're not
[24:03] there yet
[24:05] but we're on our road
[24:08] he's still working on me
[24:10] to make me what I ought to be it took
[24:13] him just a week to make the moon in
[24:15] Stars the Earth and the Sun Jupiter and
[24:17] Mars how loving and patient he must be
[24:21] he's still working on me
[24:25] amen
[24:27] uh there's another thing here that the
[24:30] sculptor does
[24:31] he's got that vision and he'll know when
[24:34] he sees it and he keeps working and
[24:36] shaving off what's needed to get to that
[24:39] Vision that's our life and if we would
[24:42] learn to stand still
[24:44] then God can do his work can you say
[24:48] Amen
[24:49] so when God was doing this
[24:52] he brother Brian says he made a
[24:53] foundation for that Masterpiece and I'm
[24:56] just going to mention this again he
[24:58] formed
[24:59] he formed his people by the word of a
[25:03] prophet I have formed you by the words
[25:05] of a prophet so people get afraid of
[25:08] prophets but you see now God's way of
[25:11] the sculpture forming the people into
[25:13] what they need to be is through the word
[25:15] of a prophet God anoints the man's vocal
[25:18] cords speaks his word and he says I have
[25:21] formed you I have shaped you by the
[25:24] prophets
[25:25] that's God's way that's his tool can you
[25:28] say amen and then he talks about a
[25:30] foundation
[25:31] um in the shadows and types
[25:33] so we can see now that this is not built
[25:36] upon uh getting people better by
[25:39] psychology God doesn't do it by
[25:41] psychology God does it by His prophets
[25:44] the word of His prophets and then he
[25:46] mentions also the the Patriots excuse me
[25:49] the Patriarchs and the apostles
[25:53] um Ephesians 2 19 says therefore we are
[25:56] no longer More Strangers and foreigners
[25:58] but fellow citizens with the Saints and
[26:00] of the household of God and are built
[26:02] upon the foundation of the Apostles and
[26:04] Prophets Jesus Christ himself so if
[26:07] we're if there's a foundation and he's
[26:09] going to build a statue he's going to
[26:10] build your life into the image of God
[26:12] there has to be a foundation and the
[26:14] foundation is the apostles Prophets The
[26:16] Patriarchs Jesus as Christ himself being
[26:19] the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[26:21] building fitly framed together growth
[26:23] into a holy Temple on the Lord in whom
[26:25] ye also are building together for a
[26:27] habitation of God through the spirit
[26:29] Patriarchs prophets and he says Abraham
[26:32] Isaac Jacob and Joseph was the
[26:35] foundation for this masterpiece Abraham
[26:37] was Faith Isaac was love Jacob was faith
[26:41] and Joseph was Perfection we have to
[26:44] have whatever was in those men in their
[26:46] lives being expressed is the mystery of
[26:49] the Masterpiece Foundation He is
[26:51] building in the bride of Christ that's
[26:53] why we need it all all the elements must
[26:55] be there for a complete Foundation it's
[26:58] not just that we preached Faith like
[27:00] Abraham had it's not just that we preach
[27:02] Grace Like Jacob had it's not just that
[27:06] we preach Perfection but we preach love
[27:08] because that's part of the foundation
[27:10] can you say Amen
[27:13] that's why I get specific about the love
[27:15] part because it's part of the foundation
[27:17] he's building you into something and
[27:19] these foundations of faith if we heard
[27:21] Faith all the time then we'd be lacking
[27:23] in other areas there are some ministers
[27:25] we bring through here they are Faith
[27:27] ministers they build Faith they tell
[27:29] testimonies they build our faith that we
[27:31] can reach out as a son of Abraham and
[27:34] believe that all things are possible
[27:36] thank God we have a great ministers
[27:38] doing that we have brothers that preach
[27:39] the grace of God like I've never heard
[27:41] the grace of God we need that can you
[27:44] say Amen then we look at the Perfection
[27:45] Joseph was Perfection Christ and we pray
[27:48] preached that perfect place that the
[27:50] bride would come to through the grace of
[27:52] God but then you see now love is a part
[27:54] of it and in the mystery of Isaac is
[27:57] this mystery of love that's what the
[27:59] prophet said there's a part there I want
[28:01] you to go back and read it when you go
[28:03] home read Isaac's life and I'm I'm
[28:06] summing up right now to get to my
[28:07] teaching but look at Isaac's life as he
[28:10] comes into career and comes into
[28:12] situations that we come into and he
[28:14] comes into reactions from people that is
[28:17] so worldly his response is divine love
[28:20] his response is just not a worldly
[28:23] response not to Divine not to brag but
[28:27] to be patient and just serve the Lord
[28:29] and to stay in tune with his position
[28:31] and to reach out to God and and just to
[28:35] stay there
[28:37] and and and to respond however you're
[28:41] treated I know I'm a son of Abraham I
[28:43] know this land is mine I know these
[28:46] these fountains and these these Wells
[28:48] are mine I know they were my father
[28:50] Abraham's but I'm not going to fight
[28:52] someone else I'm not gonna fuss with
[28:54] somebody else
[28:56] I know my calling I'm going to go on but
[28:59] I'm not going to get into squabbles I'm
[29:02] not going to get in the ring with people
[29:07] even at church
[29:09] people want to draw you in the ring and
[29:11] have a fight and box
[29:13] don't be drawn in the ring with people
[29:15] hey I'm not getting in the ring with you
[29:17] people haven't battled marriages having
[29:19] battles
[29:21] I I'm the guy that's supposed to help
[29:23] you but don't draw me in the battle with
[29:25] you
[29:25] I'm looking for a victory not a battle
[29:29] we battle we fight we fuss we're in
[29:32] intentions but we've got to go beyond
[29:34] that and live beyond that say I'm not
[29:36] getting in the ring with people I'm not
[29:37] going to fuss with people there's a
[29:39] greater power working in my life I'm not
[29:41] better than anybody else but there's
[29:43] something working me deeper and I want
[29:45] that to be my answer I don't have to
[29:47] defend people I don't have to defend
[29:49] myself I don't have to constantly be
[29:51] fussing to try to defend myself let God
[29:53] speak for me
[29:55] is anybody learning something this
[29:57] morning if you're dealing with people
[29:58] you're dealing with family members
[30:00] church members whatever it else you have
[30:02] come through years that people did not
[30:04] act right and you got in the ring with
[30:06] them and you fussed and maybe years of
[30:08] bitterness was between you
[30:10] so we've had that we don't want any more
[30:13] of it in this message let the fussing
[30:16] stop in this message let the favorite
[30:18] preacher stop in this message let Divine
[30:21] love have its victory in our lives
[30:25] let's stop with all who has the biggest
[30:27] church let's stop with who all is the
[30:29] biggest Ministry let's let's stop with
[30:31] this carnality can you say Amen let's
[30:34] let the Victory and divine love take
[30:36] over our lives that God can get the
[30:38] glory in the Final End
[30:42] this will bring their tremendous victory
[30:44] in Divine love so now as we look at
[30:47] these things I want to bring us back
[30:48] into the channel of my PowerPoint here
[30:51] and talking about the different
[30:53] attributes of divine love this made me
[30:55] get very basic like it did a few weeks
[30:56] ago and we were dealing we dealt with
[30:59] out of 15 attributes of divine love in
[31:02] First Corinthians we dealt with the
[31:03] first three attributes of divine love
[31:05] and hopefully
[31:07] you have all three of those down pat so
[31:10] we can move on to the other 12.
[31:13] what are you laughing at
[31:16] because that was enough in itself
[31:19] love is patient
[31:22] Divine love is kind
[31:25] Divine love is not jealous
[31:27] really no there's no jealousy in it
[31:32] so the first three hopefully you got
[31:33] them down pat because we want to move on
[31:34] to a couple more today
[31:36] um it's kind of like the preacher who
[31:38] kept preaching
[31:39] at his church the same exact notes in
[31:42] the same servant
[31:43] for about six weeks and finally the
[31:46] Deacon board got enough courage to come
[31:47] and ask him
[31:49] are you going to move on a little bit
[31:51] you've preached exactly the same sermon
[31:54] the congregation's asking are you going
[31:56] to get a fresh sermon
[31:57] and he said when they start living that
[32:00] then I'll get another sermon
[32:04] trust me I'm preaching to myself on
[32:06] these things and I'm going through a
[32:08] change
[32:11] in my own personal life
[32:13] I thank the Lord for it it's hard but I
[32:16] thank the Lord for it
[32:19] so let's go back um if we can figure all
[32:21] this out let's go back to our uh just
[32:25] quickly go over the first things this is
[32:27] the bride's more excellent way
[32:32] and I'm skipping through so these were
[32:34] the 15 in First Corinthians love is
[32:36] patient love is kind love is not jealous
[32:40] love does not brag or boast love is not
[32:43] proud or arrogant love is not rude love
[32:47] is not self-seeking
[32:50] love is not easily provoked to anger
[32:54] love does not no friends I'm this comes
[32:57] from your Bible
[32:59] this doesn't come from me
[33:01] this is the more excellent way
[33:04] how many want to lay your life for God
[33:06] say I want that more excellent way it's
[33:07] for me amen I mean you know I was
[33:10] thinking about something yesterday I
[33:11] thought brother Brown preached hearing
[33:13] recognizing and acting upon the word of
[33:16] God and that's three stages it's
[33:18] wonderful the way he brings it out
[33:19] because what I find is there's a lot of
[33:21] people that stay at the stage of just
[33:23] hearing his word they come to a message
[33:24] church hearing they'll nod yes hearing
[33:27] hearing hearing but there's another
[33:28] stage and that's recognizing what this
[33:30] is it's a revelation of what this is you
[33:34] can stay your whole years in the message
[33:35] just in the hearing stage but there's
[33:37] other stages it's recognizing what it is
[33:39] recognizing what God wants to do and
[33:41] then there's acting upon it
[33:43] I trust we can move from hearing
[33:46] to recognizing to acting upon the word
[33:48] of God I love to hear a little testimony
[33:50] in my church of somebody Who's acting
[33:52] upon the word of God
[33:55] they're not hearers only but they're
[33:57] doers of the word of God
[33:59] amen all of these are in your Bible it's
[34:02] all in the love chapter it's all Divine
[34:03] love the bride's victory in Divine love
[34:06] this is the more excellent way it's not
[34:08] more a national healing Revival it's not
[34:11] great uh tent revivals can you say man
[34:14] it's not that we have a big explosion of
[34:16] the gifts of the Spirit that's that's
[34:18] not promised Paul said it here in First
[34:20] Corinthians he said when that which is
[34:21] perfect that which is the part is done
[34:23] away it's not what we ever do away with
[34:25] the nine spiritual gifts or all the
[34:27] prophecies in the church we don't do
[34:28] that but you say there's he said there's
[34:30] a more excellent way and if we gravitate
[34:33] around if we really get around just all
[34:35] the gifts and as long as that's
[34:36] happening we're okay and not pursuing
[34:39] and say but Lord I want to grow in the
[34:40] more excellent way we're losing
[34:42] something in our Victory because we can
[34:44] have we can always have all of the the
[34:46] gifts working
[34:49] we can always have healings and miracles
[34:51] we had some this week
[34:52] we'll always have it
[34:54] but if we got all of that
[34:56] and not have this Capstone love we're
[34:59] nothing
[35:01] you and the message that are listening
[35:03] if you've got all that going on in all
[35:05] the conventions and everything taken
[35:07] place praise be to God but all that
[35:10] without the Capstone victory in your
[35:12] life personally it means absolutely
[35:14] nothing
[35:15] that's a bold statement but it does I'm
[35:17] saying what Paul said
[35:20] love does not keep record of others
[35:23] wrongs love does not rejoice with
[35:25] injustices or iniquity love excuse me
[35:28] love rejoices when truth prevails love
[35:30] bears and protects things love believes
[35:33] the best of things first love always has
[35:36] hope for all things love endures and
[35:39] holds up during difficulties praise be
[35:43] to God
[35:44] should we just have an altar call now
[35:46] and just leave it at that
[35:47] I want it don't you
[35:50] it's our Bible this is and I've been
[35:52] I've been diagnosing and just dissecting
[35:55] these things because of this one this is
[35:57] what he said was the more excellent way
[35:59] then I want to know what the thought of
[36:01] God was behind what when Paul said this
[36:04] there's a love of the world that gives
[36:07] and gives to charities
[36:09] but that's not what he's talking about
[36:10] because he said though I give my body to
[36:12] be burned though I give all my goods to
[36:14] feed the poor have not loved so this is
[36:16] a deeper love
[36:18] though I understand all Mysteries all
[36:22] Mysteries and have not this I am nothing
[36:27] that's why you've had ministers in our
[36:29] own ranks that could preach like an
[36:31] angel all the depths of God all the
[36:33] depths go and I love it as a preacher I
[36:35] love to hear the depths of God but we
[36:36] got we got one that could preach so deep
[36:38] everybody had him in oh he was just
[36:40] today he's in Florida wearing his shorts
[36:42] and you know away as far as he can away
[36:45] from this message and he could preach
[36:47] the mysteries of God and just Dazzle you
[36:51] so that's the Paul's saying that's not
[36:53] everything
[36:55] I love the mysteries of God
[36:57] and then he says though I give my body
[36:59] then he says though I have all the gifts
[37:02] and manifest all the gifts and have not
[37:04] love I am nothing
[37:05] so this is what he's pointing us to and
[37:07] this is what I I've been wanting to
[37:09] break down in the next few weeks
[37:11] we went through this when love is
[37:13] patient and we wrote the scriptures down
[37:15] there just moving on and a couple quotes
[37:17] that go with it love is kind this was a
[37:20] wonderful one to study be kind and
[37:22] helpful to one another tenderhearted
[37:24] compassionate understanding
[37:26] and and by the way I'm going to get you
[37:28] all these when I'm finished
[37:29] get you all these quotes there's a lot
[37:31] more quotes that go with each attribute
[37:33] of the Prophet I'm going to get you all
[37:35] those in a printout or digital and
[37:37] you'll be able to study it later on
[37:39] because I can't get to all the quotes in
[37:41] a service like this
[37:45] love is not jealous I just want to go
[37:47] back to this scripture in the Amplified
[37:50] he says in First Corinthians 3 3
[37:53] you you saw in the Corinthians now you
[37:55] are still worldly now he's Christians
[37:58] it's Christians but he said you are
[38:00] still worldly controlled by ordinary
[38:02] impulses the sinful capacity for as long
[38:06] as there's jealousy and strife and
[38:09] Discord among you you are not
[38:12] unspiritual and spiritual and are are
[38:16] you not walk I'm saying that wrong as
[38:19] long as you have jealousy and strife
[38:20] disorderline are you not unspiritual are
[38:23] you not walking like ordinary men
[38:26] unchanged by faith
[38:29] he's saying that
[38:33] to Christians he's saying you're walking
[38:36] carnal you're you're walking like men
[38:39] you're walking like the ordinary men out
[38:42] there now there's your reactions you're
[38:44] Christians and the Corinthians were
[38:46] Christians have the Holy Spirit
[38:49] but Paul's talking but when you act like
[38:52] this you're walking like ordinary men
[38:55] and the church should not be walking
[38:56] like ordinary men
[38:58] there should be a district distinction
[39:00] in what we do how we react can you say
[39:03] amen and when there's Discord among you
[39:05] and and it's jealousy and strife you're
[39:08] walking like ordinary men like the rest
[39:11] God's changing us to something deeper
[39:13] can you say Amen
[39:17] all right so here's the next one
[39:20] love does not brag or boast love does
[39:25] not brag or boast and here's the
[39:27] scripture I gave you Matthew 6 1 says
[39:29] take heed that you do not your alms
[39:31] before men to be seen of them otherwise
[39:33] ye have no reward of your father which
[39:35] is in heaven therefore
[39:37] when thou doest thine alms do not sound
[39:40] a trumpet before thee that's bragging
[39:43] do not sound a trumpet before thee as
[39:46] the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and
[39:48] in the streets that they may have Glory
[39:50] of men the fishing for praise they're
[39:53] wanting to
[39:55] put some put a trumpet out there and
[39:58] blow their own trumpet so that they can
[40:00] get the Praises of men verily I say unto
[40:02] you they have their reward but when thou
[40:04] doest alms let not thy left hand know
[40:07] what thy right is doing
[40:10] so this is the way it was said by one
[40:13] guy
[40:14] oh let's finish the scripture that thine
[40:16] arms may be in secret thy father would
[40:18] seeth and secret himself shall reward me
[40:20] openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt
[40:22] not be as the Hypocrites are for thy
[40:24] love to praise they love to pray
[40:25] standing in the synagogues in the
[40:27] corners of the streets that they may be
[40:29] seen of men verily I saying to you they
[40:31] have their reward
[40:33] but thou will now pray US enter into thy
[40:35] closet and when thou has shut the door
[40:37] pray to thy father which is in secret
[40:39] and thy father which seeth in secret
[40:40] shall reward thee openly
[40:48] he that is tooting his own horn is
[40:52] usually Out Of Tune
[40:56] something wrong
[40:58] it's bragging
[41:00] it's boasting
[41:03] um there's something wrong with somebody
[41:04] who keeps directing the conversation
[41:07] back to their life their story
[41:10] their successes
[41:13] they have to one-up everybody
[41:16] When Love focuses on one another on the
[41:20] other person love focuses on that but
[41:22] this person it's not that we can't give
[41:24] glory to God and brag on him or break or
[41:27] say God did this in my life and there's
[41:31] there's a certain way that you can bring
[41:33] it but this is a constant directing
[41:35] things back to me myself and I and
[41:39] bragging about it love focuses on
[41:41] another not self and there's another
[41:44] thing love focuses on and that's giving
[41:46] glory to God when you're bragging about
[41:48] yourself you're not giving glory to God
[41:51] so we're called in Divine love to to and
[41:54] over and over again the prophet said he
[41:56] said people say you one lady said you
[41:58] brat you talk about Jesus you brag on
[41:59] him all the time he says I'm guilty I'll
[42:01] brag on Jesus Christ my whole life
[42:03] and what he's done in my life but that's
[42:05] giving glory to God and that's not to
[42:07] self not focusing on yourself all the
[42:10] time John McArthur JR says bragging and
[42:13] pride stem from selfishness and they are
[42:16] the flip side of jealousy we've already
[42:18] dealt with jealousy and what that is and
[42:19] that's not in Divine love as well but
[42:22] jealousy this is the flip side of
[42:24] jealousy jealousy is wanting what
[42:26] someone else has bragging is trying to
[42:28] make others jealous of what you have
[42:32] so you're talking about it constantly
[42:34] because you want to get attention you're
[42:35] craving for attention so you're bragging
[42:37] on yourself and your successes and all
[42:39] that you've done Divine love doesn't do
[42:41] this jealousy is wanting what someone
[42:43] else has bragging is trying to make
[42:45] others jealous of what we have jealousy
[42:47] puts others down bragging builds us up
[42:49] bragging is an outward manifestation of
[42:52] Pride we'll get to Pride in a minute but
[42:55] bragging is the outward manifestation of
[42:57] Pride the braggart tries to impress
[42:59] others of his Great accomplishments in
[43:01] order to make himself look good
[43:05] after all I've done for you honey and
[43:08] you treat me this way
[43:14] to your wife after all look at all I've
[43:16] done and you start to listen All and
[43:18] after all have I done I've done for you
[43:20] you treat me this way
[43:23] but love isn't trying to build me up
[43:27] love is trying to build up the other
[43:28] person love is humble The Humble loving
[43:31] person is aware that everything he has
[43:34] everything he has is an undeserved gift
[43:38] from God
[43:42] I've built this business up
[43:45] for years and made it what it be
[43:48] everything you have every gift you have
[43:52] every success you have the glory should
[43:56] go back to God
[44:00] I gave 30 years to that company 40 years
[44:03] to that company blessed God I did this
[44:06] you didn't do nothing for 30 years
[44:09] without the strength in your body from
[44:12] the Lord
[44:13] I won awards I've got this and I was
[44:16] recognized by the big guys in the
[44:19] interest Industries you better give that
[44:21] Glory back to God if you are
[44:23] you better look at Joseph Who Rose to
[44:25] the high ranks you better look at Daniel
[44:26] Who Rose to the high ranks but he gave
[44:28] the glory back to God because he lived
[44:30] the way he lives he lived When Trials
[44:33] came and he was in the midst of lions
[44:34] the Lions wouldn't touch him because of
[44:36] the way he lived he gave the glory to
[44:37] God
[44:38] when they wanted to build even the king
[44:40] wanted to say you're a dreamer you're a
[44:42] prophet we're going to even serve your
[44:44] God because of you you we're going to
[44:46] build an image unto you no no no we're
[44:48] not doing that this is this dreams these
[44:50] dreams that I have these Visions every
[44:53] gift that I have I cannot take one ounce
[44:56] of the glory from it
[44:59] now we're talking about Divine love
[45:06] a humble loving person that records
[45:08] everything he has his undeserved gift
[45:10] from God we'll get to that more in a
[45:11] minute so he doesn't boast but
[45:13] thankfully uses what God has given him
[45:16] to serve others Proverbs 27 2 says let
[45:20] another praise you and not your own
[45:22] mouth
[45:23] let a stranger praise you and not your
[45:27] own lips it's not bragging and building
[45:31] up ourself is not supposed to come from
[45:34] our own mouth
[45:36] our testimony of who we are should stand
[45:39] by itself with other people testifying
[45:42] of it but when we're we feel like we're
[45:44] lacking enough praise we've got to step
[45:46] in and praise and brag on ourselves the
[45:48] Bible says otherwise let another praise
[45:51] you not your own mouth a stranger and
[45:55] not your own lips and James 3 5 7 he
[45:58] even sold the tongue as a very little
[46:00] member and but it boasteth great things
[46:07] praise the Lord
[46:12] just a little tool just
[46:15] just carving very very little
[46:18] that you
[46:20] and it's work he's working on me too
[46:23] because
[46:26] I realized that I talk too much about my
[46:29] things that I have I give glory to God I
[46:32] walked out of the barn today and I said
[46:34] Lord I wept I looked at my house I
[46:36] looked at my barn I never had a barn
[46:39] I mean I never thought I needed a bar
[46:40] and then I got one and I needed
[46:44] beautiful home in seven acres it's just
[46:47] it's just and I just wept and I said
[46:49] Lord I I never would have thought that
[46:51] you would bless me I don't have any of
[46:54] this because any of my efforts and I
[46:55] mean that
[46:56] but every once in a while to spill out
[46:58] and I'll
[47:00] talk about my quarter of a mile driveway
[47:06] I think brother Kenny got me back one
[47:08] time oh the quarter of a mile driveway
[47:10] quarter of a mile drive that's all I
[47:12] hear
[47:14] something like that
[47:16] you better watch your attitude
[47:24] yeah I was bragging about it until I
[47:26] realized I got a snow plow all that snow
[47:28] off of a quarter mile drive I wasn't
[47:29] thinking of that
[47:34] even so the tongue is a little member
[47:36] and boasteth great things it's just a
[47:39] little member of your entire body but oh
[47:41] does it ever can it ever
[47:44] say some big stuff about yourself
[47:47] how great a matter a little fire
[47:50] kindleth
[47:55] brother Brown says a true a true great
[47:58] Revival it don't get headlines and
[48:01] things like that no no there's one thing
[48:02] that Jesus Christ lacked in his life I
[48:04] hate to say that but he did Jesus lacked
[48:06] one thing a modern Showmanship he wasn't
[48:08] a show-off no everybody today has got to
[48:11] have a great big headlines and bragging
[48:14] what they're doing that's a stuffed
[48:16] shirt that's right that's not a servant
[48:19] of God a servant of God will keep humble
[48:21] and keep himself back
[48:25] hey man
[48:27] he's not he wasn't Showmanship he wasn't
[48:30] bragging and and the revivals today if
[48:33] God's doing a personal I personally
[48:35] believe that it's a personal Revival
[48:36] that's happening in you and if you're
[48:38] having a personal Revival in your life
[48:40] maybe the whole church doesn't even
[48:42] isn't gonna gonna hear about it the
[48:44] whole world's not going to hear about it
[48:46] and God doesn't care as long as he gets
[48:48] the glory
[48:49] but we want to recreate these big
[48:51] National revivals in these big and this
[48:52] is a movement going on my my and brag
[48:55] about it and several places I read last
[48:57] night he said and we want to brag of
[49:00] this and we want to brag of that and how
[49:02] big the preacher is brother Bram saying
[49:04] this brag how big our church is God have
[49:06] mercy on us for bragging about that that
[49:09] has zero to do with what God's trying to
[49:11] do
[49:12] numbers mean zero to God
[49:15] it's quality
[49:17] it's five people there filled with the
[49:19] spirit
[49:20] that's all he needs
[49:22] wherever two or three are gathered can
[49:24] you say Amen
[49:25] and so we get into this mode of who has
[49:28] this and the biggest that and and so I I
[49:31] wanted to read this to show Jesus wasn't
[49:32] that way of course we don't want to be
[49:34] bragging about what's going on and all
[49:37] these other things we don't want to do
[49:38] that except we're giving glory to God
[49:41] so that's uh the bragging part but it's
[49:44] interrelated here
[49:46] and remember what brother Bradham said
[49:48] there it's it's it's there's something
[49:51] about Jesus said he's still with me
[49:55] Jesus said my Works testify of me
[49:58] so your life will testify and speak
[50:01] louder than telling people how great
[50:03] your life is today they say it with
[50:05] pictures on the internet what I find
[50:07] about bragging today is people don't
[50:10] necessarily have to say it with their
[50:12] mouth they say it with their Facebook
[50:14] page
[50:17] what an age of bragging about your life
[50:21] on social media what an age of bragging
[50:25] through pictures if most of your
[50:27] pictures are about yourselves there are
[50:29] some Facebooks that the only picture we
[50:31] see is the person who's on the Facebook
[50:34] pictures of themselves constantly
[50:37] different outfits and all these other
[50:38] things if it's mostly of yourself you've
[50:40] got a problem you have a problem to
[50:42] bring to the Lord
[50:43] you're bragging
[50:46] most the pictures of themselves or their
[50:49] life and who they know and who they met
[50:51] and their successes
[50:54] you know it's it's it's nice if they
[50:56] look to others and and praise others and
[50:59] and build up the kingdom of God but they
[51:02] put all the stuff on to impress other
[51:04] people and as I've said it before and
[51:06] I've preached on this enough to the
[51:08] youth and everyone adults is that we
[51:11] have to be careful that we're not
[51:12] feeding a lack that social media can
[51:16] feed a lack within us
[51:18] don't shut me down don't shut me down
[51:21] if it's true to your life go home and
[51:23] take it to the altar we have to be
[51:25] careful we're not using social media to
[51:28] feed a lacking of praise and a lacking
[51:31] of approval
[51:34] that needs to be filled by the Holy
[51:37] Ghost
[51:38] by God
[51:40] Maybe by your husband
[51:43] she shall be praised proverbs 31
[51:46] Brothers
[51:48] she shall be praised maybe your wife is
[51:52] reaching for it somewhere else because
[51:53] you're not ever praising her you're not
[51:55] ever complimenting her can I get an amen
[51:58] from the sisters this morning I'm
[51:59] helping you out here
[52:03] maybe it's the same with the husband
[52:06] he's supposed to get his affirmation
[52:07] from the wife at home and and now he's
[52:09] looking for it for someone else and
[52:11] other people but you see God gives us
[52:13] these these fountains within our own
[52:15] lives and there's something wrong with a
[52:17] person bragging on the internet with its
[52:19] constantly about themselves and their
[52:21] successes just to bring it to about what
[52:23] back to what they've done there's
[52:24] something hungering within them that
[52:26] they will not recognize and they need a
[52:29] deeper walk with God for him to fill and
[52:32] make you satisfied and confident in your
[52:37] walk with the Lord
[52:39] there's some real confident people be on
[52:41] social media it's fine we're not going
[52:42] to get rid of it I'm not preaching
[52:43] against to get rid of it I'm just saying
[52:45] if it's feeding an ego
[52:48] if it's feeding your pride if it's
[52:51] feeding a lack of something spiritual in
[52:53] life you better take a look at that
[52:55] because anything worldly like that
[52:57] anything out there when it's a
[52:59] replacement for getting your confidence
[53:02] in God and with your family and your
[53:04] your
[53:05] your approval
[53:09] from others
[53:10] I saw the scriptures to let him let her
[53:12] let another man praise you well there's
[53:14] a certain part but you don't praise
[53:15] yourself you don't brag yourself I'm not
[53:17] getting enough likes this week
[53:20] so I'm going to throw up my vacation
[53:23] and
[53:24] some people's vacations it's just like
[53:26] the way it's presented none of us will
[53:29] ever have a vacation like that
[53:34] some of the dishes they're making and
[53:36] the pictures of and the presentation I
[53:38] didn't know this week until Thanksgiving
[53:40] was not just the food to eat but my wife
[53:43] said it's the presentation
[53:46] I did not know that till this
[53:48] Thanksgiving I said why is this why
[53:51] can't we just cook the food and eat it
[53:54] and I found out I'm 56 years old it's
[53:57] about the presentation
[54:00] I'm going how long does the presentation
[54:03] take place I'm hungry
[54:09] but the presentation and some of the
[54:13] food is in the presentation on these
[54:15] pictures it's just then you go back to
[54:17] what you got at home and stuff and
[54:19] you're going wow my life is just trash
[54:24] my vacation is just piddly
[54:28] but people can put it out there like
[54:31] my life is superb and yours is trash
[54:35] that's what it says
[54:44] yep all right
[54:47] sometimes people lie they lie to impress
[54:50] others
[54:53] it's all self-focused
[54:55] I'm trying to get us to grow into
[54:57] something deeper congregation
[54:59] not trying to save the world here I'm
[55:00] not going to try to correct all the
[55:01] message problems in one sermon that's
[55:03] I'm not doing that it's on my calling
[55:04] I'm taking it to the souls that God has
[55:06] given me and saying there's a more
[55:08] excellent way to live
[55:09] and God's calling it to us and these are
[55:12] the specifics of it
[55:13] when you do we lay before the altar you
[55:15] say God here it is
[55:18] Lord I'm guilty of these things I'm not
[55:19] strong in this area I know I have the
[55:21] love of God but this must get out in my
[55:24] reactions to life things God take this
[55:27] tongue that's a world of fire take this
[55:29] tongue and may it be replaced no
[55:32] Bragging let it give glory to Jesus
[55:34] Christ
[55:36] so in relation Pride now love is not
[55:39] arrogant or proud and and and
[55:42] um bragging and boasting is interrelated
[55:45] with pride you brag because you are
[55:48] proud
[55:51] so we have to talk about pride and pride
[55:54] could take me several weeks to talk
[55:55] about because pride is something
[55:57] throughout the scripture God hates Pride
[55:59] God hates any kind of pride pride keeps
[56:02] you from growing in the Lord Pride keeps
[56:04] you from going into a closer walk with
[56:06] him
[56:07] religious Pride I'll get to that in a
[56:09] minute but any kind of pride is a downer
[56:11] it keeps you away from being closer to
[56:14] God
[56:15] so uh
[56:17] you haven't pride is an overestimation
[56:19] of yourself an overestimation of your
[56:22] gifts and overestimation of your talents
[56:25] and we're familiar with the regular
[56:27] Pride we're familiar with the pride of
[56:29] life
[56:30] people work to achieve things they work
[56:33] hard to buy things to have things people
[56:35] work hard for a greater education and
[56:38] all that is fine people work hard
[56:40] sometimes to impress other people they
[56:42] spend much of their life trying to
[56:43] compete with someone else and they then
[56:46] but the the Trap is not having things or
[56:49] achieving things I just think when we're
[56:52] achieving and doing this should be to
[56:53] the glory of God but when you come to
[56:55] the end of it and you're so full of
[56:57] yourselves that you're smarter than
[56:59] everybody that you're better than
[57:01] everybody that you're Superior to
[57:03] everybody that you've done more than
[57:05] anybody then we're getting into pride
[57:07] and God hates pride and you'll never
[57:09] find it in the love of God
[57:13] the love of God does not have this
[57:18] when pride comes
[57:20] boiling up with an arrogant attitude of
[57:22] self-importance then come dishonor and
[57:25] shame but with the humble the teachable
[57:27] who have been chiseled ah
[57:31] teachable who have been chiseled by
[57:33] trial and who have learned to walk hunly
[57:35] with God there is wisdom and soundness
[57:38] of mind so that's the fruits of the
[57:40] humble but the fruits of a bowling up
[57:42] with arrogant attitude of
[57:43] self-importance it's all about three
[57:45] people me myself and I everything you'll
[57:48] destroy your marriage if you're all
[57:50] about yourself you destroy your family
[57:52] if you're all about yourself
[57:54] when pride comes
[57:56] arrogant attitude about self-importance
[57:58] then come dishonor and shame that's the
[58:01] fruits from this continued years of
[58:03] self-importance it's all about me all
[58:05] that comes is dishonor and shame in the
[58:07] family dishonor and shame in your life
[58:09] and other people's lives that's the
[58:10] fruit of it
[58:15] Philippians 2 and the appetite said make
[58:17] my joy complete
[58:19] by being of the same mind having the
[58:21] same love towards one another knit
[58:23] together in spirit intent on one
[58:25] person's purpose and living a life that
[58:27] reflects your faith and spreads the
[58:30] gospel the good news regarding salvation
[58:31] through faith in Christ do nothing from
[58:34] selfishness or empty conceit through
[58:36] factional motives
[58:38] or Strife but with an attitude of
[58:41] humility being neither arrogant nor
[58:43] self-righteous regard others as more
[58:46] important than yourself can you say Amen
[58:48] there's a scripture it's just plain as
[58:50] day that's in Philippians 2 in the
[58:52] Amplified
[58:54] amen but let me just begin to wrap this
[58:57] up here in the next 10-15 minutes
[59:00] are you still with me
[59:04] talk a lot about the pride of life and
[59:06] the pride of this world
[59:08] but to Christians I've got to move into
[59:10] an area of religious Pride
[59:13] because religious pride is the worst
[59:16] kind
[59:20] to think that you are more spiritual
[59:22] than anyone else
[59:24] as I read in Matthew 6 the Pharisees
[59:27] they did everything over the top and but
[59:30] they did it for the wrong motive they
[59:31] did everything over the top but it was
[59:33] to appear more holy than the other men
[59:36] I thank God that I'm not like this
[59:38] sinner here
[59:41] everything the Pharisees did was to
[59:43] appear more holy to other men as better
[59:46] than other men a religious spirit thinks
[59:49] it has it all together and looks down on
[59:51] others no one ever measures up to where
[59:54] they are at I hope you're listening to
[59:56] me one and all a religious spirit you
[59:59] don't want a religious spirit you want
[1:00:01] the Holy Spirit
[1:00:03] sometimes they can look like the real
[1:00:05] thing so much but it's not the real
[1:00:07] thing a religious spirit thinks it
[1:00:09] doesn't work for marriages doesn't work
[1:00:11] for churches it always messes things up
[1:00:14] because it thinks it has it all it looks
[1:00:16] down on others who are not Measuring Up
[1:00:18] and actually no one ever measures up to
[1:00:21] where they are
[1:00:22] a husband never measures up the wife
[1:00:25] never measures up to a legalist or to a
[1:00:27] person that's got a religious spirit
[1:00:29] nobody ever measures up nobody lives the
[1:00:31] word tightly and closely enough for them
[1:00:34] and yet I find in people when I look
[1:00:37] deep in them that have a religious
[1:00:39] spirit when I look deeper into their
[1:00:41] eyes and deeper into their life and
[1:00:43] trust me we've seen and looked through
[1:00:45] people for many many years now when I
[1:00:48] look deep into them they are just like
[1:00:51] us
[1:00:53] empty many times
[1:00:55] they're just like us they've made
[1:00:57] mistakes like us
[1:00:59] we don't know about them
[1:01:03] but they've made mistakes like us they
[1:01:06] feel empty sometimes like us and they
[1:01:08] feel embarrassed by their true
[1:01:10] weaknesses but they want never want
[1:01:12] anybody to see them
[1:01:16] so Pride makes them put on a show
[1:01:20] Pride makes them put on a religious show
[1:01:24] not a you have people in the world like
[1:01:26] this but this is a religion so this is a
[1:01:28] message show that if I can appear
[1:01:30] spiritual and that I know more quotes to
[1:01:32] the next person and that I know more
[1:01:34] Mysteries than the next person and that
[1:01:36] I'm dressed and even the prophet
[1:01:37] addresses and is your life worthy I
[1:01:39] believe he said and you've got your long
[1:01:40] hair and your long dress and you've got
[1:01:42] everything just right but you see if a
[1:01:45] brother brother Brian said if a pride
[1:01:47] goes with that that you're more holy
[1:01:48] than someone else you've got the wrong
[1:01:50] motive for wearing your dress
[1:01:53] you've got the wrong motive for having
[1:01:55] your long hair
[1:01:57] because you've got it in a religious
[1:01:58] project said I'm better than anybody you
[1:02:01] are not better because of those things
[1:02:03] in the essential thing of your soul and
[1:02:06] your life without God you are nothing
[1:02:08] and putting on the long hair and dress
[1:02:10] does not make you make it into heaven
[1:02:12] can you say Amen
[1:02:13] it's about what's in that soul and
[1:02:16] without the Holy Ghost you're capable of
[1:02:19] the worst sin without the Holy Ghost
[1:02:21] you're capable you've got long hair but
[1:02:23] you're capable of the worst vile sin
[1:02:26] without the Holy Ghost so why not quit
[1:02:28] boasting of everything go ahead and do
[1:02:30] it follow the word of God God
[1:02:32] appreciates that God will honor it can
[1:02:34] you say Amen
[1:02:35] but don't ever do it to put on a show
[1:02:50] here's some interesting things that the
[1:02:51] prophet said about this back in a
[1:02:53] message called
[1:02:55] Pride
[1:02:57] go back and read this message
[1:03:02] what does the Pharisee word mean in the
[1:03:04] Greek it means an actor someone who acts
[1:03:06] oh I hate that somebody acting trying to
[1:03:08] put on I despise such a thing many times
[1:03:11] people are trying to act like the other
[1:03:12] fella listen you quit trying to act like
[1:03:14] the next fella and just act out your own
[1:03:16] convictions and get get along better be
[1:03:18] yourself and find out that the most of
[1:03:20] the people and I find out the most
[1:03:22] people that's growed on the whole
[1:03:23] environment of the American people to
[1:03:25] act we're great actors Pharisees tell
[1:03:28] you where he where we learn it they
[1:03:30] there there they are we'll see them
[1:03:32] they're better for the screen before
[1:03:34] they're before the screen so much until
[1:03:36] they always acting and I skipped the
[1:03:38] quote there a little bit but he said
[1:03:39] this is a Hollywood we learn it from
[1:03:41] Hollywood we're consumed with Hollywood
[1:03:43] and Hollywood is a world of actors
[1:03:45] they're acting out something because we
[1:03:47] feed on that America feeds on that he
[1:03:50] says then they become actors the
[1:03:52] American people through television and
[1:03:54] through picture shows they have seen so
[1:03:55] much of the put on till they become
[1:03:58] put-ons themselves
[1:04:01] too bad and we get it in the church
[1:04:05] actors hmm
[1:04:08] God don't want them far be it from us to
[1:04:10] be actors be yourself God wants you to
[1:04:13] be that way I despise seeing someone to
[1:04:15] trying to do something that they cannot
[1:04:17] do
[1:04:19] putting on a show it's become actors
[1:04:20] Pharisee putting on something so you can
[1:04:22] appear spiritual to everybody else I've
[1:04:24] noticed it many times in beautiful
[1:04:25] voices that God has given to people a
[1:04:28] talent and then they over train it I
[1:04:30] hate to hear an overtrained voice when
[1:04:31] they stand up to sing and get some kind
[1:04:34] of a note till they hold it so long till
[1:04:37] they get blue in the face just to show
[1:04:40] the congregation how long they can hang
[1:04:42] on for dear life
[1:04:47] I don't believe brother Rams is against
[1:04:49] training I never read that quote that
[1:04:51] way he's not talking about that he's
[1:04:53] talking about somebody's becoming a
[1:04:54] show-off and it's not about the
[1:04:56] anointing it's not about the life it's
[1:04:58] not about the words of the song anymore
[1:04:59] it's how well they sing it
[1:05:05] so just to show the congregation how can
[1:05:07] they can hang out for your life and when
[1:05:09] they come back down then people's not
[1:05:11] praising God their mind is on the Note
[1:05:14] musicians and singers you do a
[1:05:17] disservice to people if the attraction
[1:05:18] is all on you
[1:05:20] supposed to be on the Lord supposed to
[1:05:22] be on the anointing sing your heart out
[1:05:24] sing to your very best that God has
[1:05:27] given you to do but if you have in your
[1:05:28] heart to draw that praise to yourself
[1:05:30] and all of a sudden I've watched
[1:05:31] musicians and I'm not saying that we we
[1:05:33] got good Brothers here and good sisters
[1:05:35] playing and good Hearts I believe it but
[1:05:37] it's always good these type of quotes
[1:05:38] are all good because God's blessed us so
[1:05:39] much with so much musicians in this
[1:05:41] church we thank God for it but I've
[1:05:43] watched sometimes somebody showing off
[1:05:45] on the organ or the piano I'm not saying
[1:05:47] here but years ago somebody's just
[1:05:49] they're playing real loud and they're
[1:05:50] playing above everybody else and they're
[1:05:52] doing all the things and doing all the
[1:05:53] licks and all that and you can't hear
[1:05:55] anybody else and eventually the
[1:05:57] congregation stops worshiping because
[1:05:59] all the attention is on the guide doing
[1:06:01] the solo and nobody's asked him to do a
[1:06:05] solo
[1:06:07] he's doing one anyway
[1:06:14] the worship's gone any musician
[1:06:17] or singer
[1:06:19] who doesn't who distracts the people
[1:06:22] from entering in to worship themselves
[1:06:26] doing a disservice
[1:06:28] we got music directors here brother
[1:06:30] Michael brother Kenny they have this
[1:06:32] heart it's all about worship
[1:06:35] and drawing those people into worship
[1:06:37] sing your best We Believe here playing
[1:06:40] our best playing skillfully continuing
[1:06:42] to grow and learn become better at your
[1:06:44] gift we believe in all that some people
[1:06:46] say why I know two chords and I I played
[1:06:49] 20 years ago in church do you know any
[1:06:52] more chords no just the same two chords
[1:06:54] you can only sing in those two keys how
[1:06:56] ridiculous you're not doing your best
[1:06:57] for the Lord
[1:07:01] we believe in doing playing skillfully
[1:07:03] and doing our best and getting better
[1:07:04] and better at it for the glory of God
[1:07:07] but don't you ever distract
[1:07:09] from the worship to the people's minds
[1:07:12] are not on praising God but on the Note
[1:07:15] I love good old-fashioned Pentecostal
[1:07:17] singing where you raise up your hands
[1:07:19] with tears running down your cheeks
[1:07:20] whether you could sing Do Re Mi Faso
[1:07:23] latido or not and just sing in the
[1:07:25] spirit from the heart you give praise to
[1:07:27] God all out of the program you have to
[1:07:29] get out of man's program to get into
[1:07:31] God's program get out of it oh my
[1:07:33] deliver me from being an actor be what
[1:07:35] you are God will bless you
[1:07:38] but a Pharisee oh I hate that word I'm
[1:07:40] I'm an actor some sisters do the same
[1:07:42] thing got a lot of acting about them oh
[1:07:44] they'll cut their husband's nose off
[1:07:46] John why did you do that that's how they
[1:07:48] acted home John why did you do that I'm
[1:07:50] glad you used John because that's my
[1:07:52] name
[1:07:53] John Paul
[1:07:54] John why do you do that
[1:07:58] my wife didn't say that but
[1:08:02] he's talking about a woman here I don't
[1:08:03] know who she is John why did you do that
[1:08:05] just as Snappy as they can oh my God
[1:08:08] delivered me from ever calling on you if
[1:08:10] that's the kind of spirit you have but
[1:08:12] let someone talk on the phone with him
[1:08:13] someone else who how do you do
[1:08:17] I'm so glad that you called
[1:08:20] John what are you doing hello
[1:08:26] Pharisees actors
[1:08:29] being something different at home
[1:08:34] than you are a church
[1:08:38] I never completely judge you by the way
[1:08:39] you act here everybody acts good here
[1:08:41] who's going to do anything bad here
[1:08:45] Worship the Lord I'm glad you do but my
[1:08:48] question is how do you act at home
[1:08:55] actors shame on you house Angels Road
[1:08:58] devils
[1:09:02] you think I'm a hard preacher
[1:09:06] putting on just be yourself all the time
[1:09:09] that's the best way don't you believe it
[1:09:11] sure you know how to take you then not
[1:09:13] actors not Pharisees go to church on
[1:09:15] Sunday and know how Pious you are and on
[1:09:17] Monday morning nobody could get along
[1:09:20] with you your employers can't get along
[1:09:22] with you
[1:09:23] and the reason they can't get along with
[1:09:25] you you can't even get along with
[1:09:26] yourself
[1:09:32] how Pious you are on Sunday hapaisha and
[1:09:35] on Monday morning nobody can get along
[1:09:36] with you you Pharisee what good does it
[1:09:39] do you to go to church
[1:09:43] foreign
[1:09:46] I want to read a scripture here I know I
[1:09:48] got a couple more minutes
[1:09:50] and I'm going to take this over to
[1:09:51] something Paul said in First Corinthians
[1:09:53] 4 6 I'm going to read it I believe it's
[1:09:56] the Amplified I can't remember just what
[1:09:57] it is here let me see yeah it's
[1:09:59] Amplified this is an interesting
[1:10:00] scripture and it tells me there must
[1:10:02] have been some divisions going on
[1:10:05] he does mention in First Corinthians he
[1:10:07] mentioned some say I am of Paul I am of
[1:10:10] cephas I am of this teacher I'm of that
[1:10:13] so I already had that kind of plain
[1:10:14] favorite preachers going on
[1:10:16] Paul kind of breaks it down here in
[1:10:18] chapter four
[1:10:19] he said now I have applied these things
[1:10:21] that is the Anna
[1:10:24] analogies about factions factions are
[1:10:26] divisions
[1:10:27] to myself and Apollos for your benefit
[1:10:29] Believers so that you may learn
[1:10:32] from us not to go beyond what is written
[1:10:35] in Scripture
[1:10:36] so that none of you will become arrogant
[1:10:39] and boast in favor of one minister or
[1:10:43] teacher
[1:10:45] against the other
[1:10:48] have we done this in our own ranks
[1:10:55] have we done this in our own ranks yes
[1:10:57] we have
[1:10:59] yes we have
[1:11:02] so that none of you will become arrogant
[1:11:04] and boast in your favor of one Minister
[1:11:07] teacher against the other for who
[1:11:10] regards you as Superior or what sets you
[1:11:13] apart as special
[1:11:16] so he's saying you're choosing favorite
[1:11:18] ministers but it's not just that you
[1:11:20] have got a pride about you and you're
[1:11:22] bragging about your teacher and you're
[1:11:24] bragging about your minister and you're
[1:11:26] bragging about your favorite and you're
[1:11:28] bragging bragging about as if you have
[1:11:30] become Superior in what they're bringing
[1:11:33] in your Revelation you're Superior to
[1:11:36] everybody else have we had any of this
[1:11:39] in our own ranks
[1:11:41] well I can't get people to respond I
[1:11:43] been around a little bit but
[1:11:47] see the Bible has the answers it was
[1:11:50] happening back then
[1:11:52] so it's not just the minister he might
[1:11:54] get an arrogant Spirit about himself an
[1:11:57] over exaggeration of himself and that
[1:11:59] he's going to bring new things to the
[1:12:01] bride and he's going to correct all the
[1:12:02] message problems in one sermon and he
[1:12:05] can become like trust me we know some of
[1:12:07] them but
[1:12:08] but it's when the congregation members
[1:12:10] get the superior attitude Superior
[1:12:13] Revelation our church is this we're
[1:12:15] doing this for who regards you as
[1:12:17] Superior what sets you apart is special
[1:12:19] this happens very subtle in movements in
[1:12:21] the message very subtle the superiority
[1:12:24] comes in that we're the place to be
[1:12:26] we're the church you need to be at if
[1:12:28] you're mincing this convention you're
[1:12:30] missing everything
[1:12:35] and say it publicly please let the day
[1:12:38] be over
[1:12:39] of raising up just one teacher that's
[1:12:42] going to take the bride to rapturing
[1:12:44] Faith
[1:12:45] my Bible Bible says a faithful Ministry
[1:12:48] and when you lift up one man too far
[1:12:52] you're going against the scripture can
[1:12:54] you say amen I don't care who they are I
[1:12:56] don't care what Dove has appeared to
[1:12:58] them I don't care what Vision they have
[1:13:00] if there's no scripture for that man
[1:13:02] you're wrong in lifting up that one
[1:13:04] teacher and they're wrong for letting
[1:13:06] you do it
[1:13:11] for who regards you are superior what
[1:13:13] sets you apart special what do you have
[1:13:15] what do you have that you did not
[1:13:17] receive from another and if in fact you
[1:13:20] received it from God or someone else why
[1:13:23] do you boast as if you had not received
[1:13:26] it but had gained it by yourself this is
[1:13:30] the point that I want to end on this
[1:13:31] morning is that everything that we have
[1:13:34] comes from God
[1:13:37] whatever revelation we received we have
[1:13:41] no right to boast of it to brag of it or
[1:13:44] it came through a certain teacher we
[1:13:46] have no right to do that we have
[1:13:48] received nothing of ourselves we have
[1:13:50] not brought it to ourselves so we have
[1:13:52] no Bragging Rights can I get an amen
[1:13:56] we have no personal bragging rights for
[1:13:59] everything that we have within us today
[1:14:03] I hold within me I Not only was crying
[1:14:05] this morning over what God has given me
[1:14:07] but I was crying over something greater
[1:14:09] and that's the Revelation he's deposited
[1:14:11] in my heart I can't get over the riches
[1:14:13] that he's placed within me and guess
[1:14:16] what I didn't learn any of them I didn't
[1:14:18] get any of them myself it's what God
[1:14:20] deposited into this soul
[1:14:23] he did it through the fightful ministry
[1:14:25] I could acknowledge a lot of men that's
[1:14:27] been a blessing to my life but God did
[1:14:29] it through those men
[1:14:32] Paul's saying we don't have any there's
[1:14:33] no bra but Paul's saying is that in my
[1:14:36] Amplified version we have no Bragging
[1:14:38] Rights because we received it from God
[1:14:40] or someone else God through someone else
[1:14:43] why do we boast as if we had not
[1:14:44] received it but had gained it by herself
[1:14:46] we don't have bragging rights because
[1:14:48] this may this bring true humility in our
[1:14:51] lives and love in our life is to really
[1:14:53] know that we can that what we can be
[1:14:56] what is it in our lives
[1:14:59] that we can be proud of in ourselves
[1:15:02] what can we brag of everything that we
[1:15:05] have has come from him
[1:15:09] if you have a revelation
[1:15:11] it came from him
[1:15:14] I wonder if you could get out of that
[1:15:16] um PowerPoint and bring up the scripture
[1:15:19] as I in Deuteronomy 8 17 and 18.
[1:15:22] I didn't have this one in the PowerPoint
[1:15:24] but I'm I'm ending this morning I'm I
[1:15:27] trust it's been a blessing to you I've
[1:15:28] taken a little longer than usual but I
[1:15:31] trust you take it and take it and pray
[1:15:33] with these things hope it's a blessing
[1:15:35] to you hopefully I get an encouragement
[1:15:37] to you
[1:15:39] to lift you take you further we're
[1:15:41] ministering if we can to everybody this
[1:15:44] morning
[1:15:45] we're even given ministering Comfort to
[1:15:47] Ohio State fans this morning
[1:15:52] depression whatever it is we'll pray
[1:15:54] over you
[1:16:00] Deuteronomy 8 17 says and thou say and
[1:16:03] this is a scripture that's saying when
[1:16:04] you get in the promised land and you're
[1:16:05] blessed and your herds are blessed and
[1:16:07] the food and everything probably don't
[1:16:09] forget the Lord and that and that's how
[1:16:11] Thou shalt say in thy heart my power and
[1:16:14] the might of mine hand hath gotten me
[1:16:16] this wealth
[1:16:17] but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God
[1:16:20] for it is he that giveth thee power to
[1:16:23] get wealth
[1:16:25] that he may establish his Covenant which
[1:16:28] he swear unto your fathers as it is this
[1:16:30] day we must never forget and this will
[1:16:32] get rid of bragging this will should get
[1:16:34] rid of pride that whatever we have has
[1:16:37] come from the Lord
[1:16:38] the power to work the power to live the
[1:16:41] power to get wealth can you say amen and
[1:16:43] wealth can mean not just the wealth of
[1:16:45] this world but the wealth of Revelation
[1:16:47] that this bride enjoys
[1:16:49] don't forget you didn't get it for
[1:16:52] yourself you didn't get from some super
[1:16:54] duper teacher it all comes from the Lord
[1:16:58] aren't you grateful this morning
[1:17:00] it should humble us to say Lord let me
[1:17:03] not take any Glory myself but let me say
[1:17:06] if I have a family this morning if I
[1:17:09] have a lovely wife if I have a lovely
[1:17:11] husband you know it all you say well I
[1:17:15] did that I got that no no there's
[1:17:17] something that trumps all of it if I'm
[1:17:19] blessed all every good and perfect gift
[1:17:21] has come from God
[1:17:22] you come through trials and you come out
[1:17:24] of the overcoming and you come out
[1:17:26] better for it and you come out better
[1:17:27] instead of bitter you ought to raise
[1:17:29] your hand and say thank God I'm still
[1:17:31] here
[1:17:32] I'm still here this morning
[1:17:34] brother Ed I'm still here I don't know
[1:17:37] how I'm still here but I'm still here
[1:17:40] by his grace I'm still here and if I
[1:17:43] have anything good if I have anything uh
[1:17:46] that's of of of of of significance in my
[1:17:49] life at all I did not I can't boast of
[1:17:52] it because I didn't get it for myself
[1:17:55] I got it from him
[1:18:00] and when brother Brown went to the
[1:18:02] meeting for the first time to see
[1:18:04] tongue's interpretation in any Indiana
[1:18:06] Fort Wayne I think it was
[1:18:09] wherever that tent meeting was he as a
[1:18:11] Baptist had never seen the gifts of the
[1:18:13] Spirit working he was very impressed he
[1:18:14] said I want to study this he'd be in a
[1:18:16] study realized it was scripture okay
[1:18:19] and I have a quote here when I was just
[1:18:21] going to say it to you before we close
[1:18:22] and he said there were two men that
[1:18:28] both spoken tongues and prophesied in
[1:18:30] the meeting he said so now if I can just
[1:18:32] get to those two men he said the little
[1:18:34] gift within me I want to discern these
[1:18:36] men so he went to the first one he said
[1:18:38] I found him to be a very humble
[1:18:40] Christian he could see his life he was
[1:18:42] humble serving God he had tongues and
[1:18:44] interpretation
[1:18:45] and it was true and everything was great
[1:18:47] he went and found the other guy and he
[1:18:49] says he was arrogant he was proud he was
[1:18:52] bragging
[1:18:54] and yet he was manifesting the same gift
[1:18:56] of the spirit of tongues and
[1:18:57] interpretation
[1:18:58] now we don't dump out the tongues
[1:19:00] because of that but we realize what Paul
[1:19:02] said is right though I speak with
[1:19:04] tongues of men and angels and if you've
[1:19:07] got bragging and arrogance and pride
[1:19:10] with it you're missing something it's
[1:19:13] saying to us you can have all the gifts
[1:19:15] going on in the church but there's a
[1:19:19] more excellent way
[1:19:21] for all of us
[1:19:22] to come to by his grace
[1:19:25] Grace Grace
[1:19:28] God's grace
[1:19:31] Grace that will pardon
[1:19:35] and cleanse Within
[1:19:39] rain
[1:19:44] God's
[1:19:46] Grace
[1:19:49] that is greater
[1:19:53] than all
[1:19:58] go ahead and stand up everybody a couple

[1:20:40] puppet and keep manipulating your life
[1:20:43] why don't you turn your life over to the
[1:20:45] Great
[1:20:46] sculptor Christ mowed you into something
[1:20:49] of a Son of God why don't you let him do
[1:20:53] that this morning Father
[1:20:55] as we look at this image of your
[1:20:58] character
[1:20:59] we can only humbly lay ourselves in our
[1:21:01] hearts before your throne and say the
[1:21:04] Lord let that let the spirit of God mold
[1:21:06] this
[1:21:07] deeper in me
[1:21:09] I'm here to ask forgiveness Lord if I've
[1:21:11] done or said anything opposite of these
[1:21:14] things which I have father I'm asking
[1:21:17] you to mold my life and burn it out of
[1:21:19] me that I would no longer
[1:21:20] jump in the ring with somebody or fuss
[1:21:23] with somebody or defend myself or brag
[1:21:27] Lord forgive me Lord
[1:21:29] forgive me for taking the glory too many
[1:21:31] times when I know it had to be your work

[1:21:48] you showed up and you did something
[1:21:50] through our gift
[1:21:52] and I had to return that glory and give
[1:21:54] it to you Lord
