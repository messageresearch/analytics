That's When

Verse 1:
When we have a work to do
And the task ahead seems bigger than you
That's when He steps in
When you know in your heart that God's command
Takes more than can be done by man
That's when He steps in
He sees you at the point of your need
He sees you at the point of crossing your Red Sea
In the moment you call
When you've given your all
He steps in, He steps in
And He'll say

Chorus:
What's that you have in your hand
I can use it
If you're willing to lose it
Take the little you have and make it grand
I am El-Shaddai
And I'll more than supply your need

Verse 2:
When all you havе is oil in a jar
That's a reflection of wherе you are
That's when He steps in
A little boy's lunch of fish and bread
Is all you have for the need ahead
That's when He steps in
Let Him take it and bless it
And break it and give it
He'll multiply it
In the moment you live it
In the moment you call
When you've given your all
He steps in, He steps in
And He'll say...
