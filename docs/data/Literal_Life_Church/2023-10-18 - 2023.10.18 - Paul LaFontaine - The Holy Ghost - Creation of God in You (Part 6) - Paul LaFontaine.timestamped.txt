[23:38] power
[23:40] wonderwork power in the pre just blood
[23:46] of the
[23:48] Lamb amen amen praise the lord we
[23:51] believe that with all of our heart
[23:52] tonight if you turn with in the Bibles
[23:54] with me to Luke chapter 1 it's certain a
[23:57] joy to be in his house and gather with
[23:59] you all tonight God bless you for coming
[24:01] near and far God bless you each one it's
[24:03] just a privilege to be with you and
[24:04] those that are listening in line online
[24:06] as well God bless you and God give you
[24:09] food tonight for your soul praise the
[24:12] Lord and so we appreciate brother Gideon
[24:14] praying for the Reagan family of course
[24:16] they've been deep in our hearts and sent
[24:18] some encouraging words just to them this
[24:20] morning and uh so it's just sometimes
[24:24] God does things that are different than
[24:26] what we expected and uh it's difficult
[24:29] because to be honest
[24:31] sometimes it was like one of my
[24:33] daughters brought up you know you can't
[24:35] help it doesn't can't help but think of
[24:37] the question why sometimes this happens
[24:40] to people that are so faithful someone
[24:43] like brother Donnie and his daughter and
[24:44] family and her confession was the word
[24:46] of God and healing all the way until the
[24:49] end and he he begs the question why to
[24:52] people like that and it turns this way
[24:54] and then you have other people who have
[24:56] no regard for the word of God God and
[24:58] blatantly against it and accusing and
[25:00] brings accusations and they seem to get
[25:03] by I don't think we'll ever understand
[25:05] those Mysteries because God is God and
[25:09] job if you if you look at job there was
[25:12] no explanation for that because he was
[25:14] doing everything that he needed to do
[25:17] and so we have to put our trust in the
[25:19] Lord but it doesn't make it easy when we
[25:22] have uh brother the Reagan family losing
[25:25] a loved one like this under these
[25:27] circumstance ances so let's pray for
[25:29] them let's lift them up and let's
[25:32] remember them in the coming days and
[25:34] coming months because many times it can
[25:36] be grieving for quite a while even
[25:38] though they know the truth of
[25:40] Resurrection they know the truth of
[25:42] where she is and all these things are
[25:44] things that we hold dear to our hearts
[25:46] but the loss is not ever easy and so my
[25:50] heart goes out to them tonight we're
[25:52] going to read tonight from Luke chapter
[25:55] 1 Eli and Kendall good to have you
[25:57] praise the Lord didn't know you were
[25:59] popping in here on us Luke chap 1 and
[26:02] verse 30 is where we want start start
[26:05] reading and this may look like that I'm
[26:08] preaching a Christmas message tonight
[26:09] because I'm reading about Mary and the
[26:11] angel coming to her but I'm not although
[26:15] they can use this if they want for the
[26:17] Christmas broadcast um and I understand
[26:20] that they're in the studio been working
[26:22] because on the December 10th we'll have
[26:24] a an evening of gospel music and
[26:26] Christmas music here on December 10th
[26:29] and uh thank you appreciate it um so
[26:32] they're in the studio preparing some uh
[26:35] songs for Christmas so uh maybe they'll
[26:38] get some inspiration out of what I
[26:39] preach tonight because we're trying to
[26:41] come up with some original songs I wrote
[26:43] a song here a couple nights here at the
[26:45] piano for them and gave it I'm going to
[26:46] give that to him so but this is uh along
[26:49] our series on the Holy Ghost I'm going
[26:51] to bring in the New Testament now we've
[26:53] taken a lot of the prophecies from the
[26:55] Old Testament for telling the holy ghost
[26:58] coming and what it is and those uh
[27:00] things that we can look at that we can
[27:02] understand what the Holy Ghost is so now
[27:05] we're crossing over into the New
[27:06] Testament and the places that he
[27:08] mentions the Holy Ghost and what it is
[27:10] and it starts right in Matthew and so
[27:12] let's just read here in uh chap in Luke
[27:15] uh in the beginning here and it we'll
[27:17] just pick it up here in verse 30 and the
[27:20] angel said unto Mary fear not Mary for
[27:23] thou Hast found favor with God and
[27:25] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[27:28] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[27:31] name Jesus he shall be great and shall
[27:34] be called the son of the highest and the
[27:36] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[27:38] of his father David and he shall reign
[27:40] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[27:43] his kingdom there will be no end so now
[27:45] we have the first Advent or the first
[27:47] coming of Christ and he's going to be
[27:49] born a baby and we realize that this
[27:53] great event now God is visiting a young
[27:56] girl who he's going to begin this
[27:59] Creation in in a young girl there are
[28:01] churches around there's actually
[28:04] churches around that are singing and
[28:06] proclaiming the coming Messiah there's
[28:09] actually prophecies going on there's
[28:11] actually the reading the Bible of the
[28:13] Bible the Scrolls there's churches
[28:15] around and so everybody believes that
[28:18] this is going to happen no nobody knew
[28:20] it would happen this way but there's
[28:21] churches around and yet when God moves
[28:24] in to bring this to pass he comes to one
[28:27] young girl to bring this new creation
[28:30] that's just a great mystery in God but
[28:33] you ought to raise your hand tonight and
[28:35] say I'm a nobody Mary was a nobody I'm a
[28:37] Nobody But if his kingdom comes to me
[28:40] bypasses a lot of the denominations but
[28:43] comes to me individually to put his
[28:45] Spirit within me you ought to raise your
[28:47] hand and say thanks be to God for his
[28:49] mercy and Grace I was noticing a few
[28:51] verses later where Mary it's called
[28:53] Mary's joyful song and I didn't realize
[28:56] that was in there but she said sings
[28:57] quite a nice song there after she's
[28:59] rejoicing after she meets Elizabeth but
[29:02] here we'll finish up in uh verse uh 33
[29:05] and he shall reign over the house of
[29:06] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[29:08] shall be no end then said Mary unto the
[29:10] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[29:13] not a man and the angel answered and
[29:16] said unto the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[29:19] thee and the power of the highest shall
[29:21] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[29:25] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[29:28] be called The Son of God you can imagine
[29:31] why I'm reading this now it refers to
[29:33] the Holy Ghost we've been preaching on
[29:34] the Holy Ghost and in relation to you
[29:37] receiving the Holy Ghost and so now you
[29:39] can imagine that he says what's going to
[29:41] happen is going to be by the Holy Ghost
[29:43] and guess what he's not bringing it to
[29:45] the churches he's not bringing it to the
[29:47] movement he's bringing it to a young
[29:49] girl and this is going to happen in
[29:51] you talk about having to believe the
[29:54] impossible let's see how she responds
[29:57] and Behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath
[30:00] also conceived a son in her old age and
[30:02] this is the sixth month with her who was
[30:04] called Barron for with God nothing shall
[30:08] be impossible so she was Barren and God
[30:11] said but if I say she's not going to be
[30:13] Barren anymore whatever is impossible
[30:16] God makes it possible how many believes
[30:19] that we got to believe in a God that can
[30:22] do The Impossibles so he's already
[30:24] saying it's already impossible if a
[30:26] woman is and but I take the things that
[30:28] are impossible I can do it now he goes
[30:31] further with Mary who wasn't with a man
[30:33] and he says you're going to conceive now
[30:36] we're talking levels of impossibility
[30:38] that it's hard for the human mind to
[30:40] grasp but the soul can say Amen look at
[30:43] what Mary does for that for With God all
[30:45] nothing shall be impossible and Mary
[30:47] said behold no more questions she just
[30:50] had one question I wasn't with a man
[30:52] how's this going to happen but the
[30:54] questions are gone no more questions she
[30:56] said behold hold the handmade of the
[30:59] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[31:03] and the angel departed from her Heavenly
[31:05] Father Grant Grace To Us Lord for the
[31:08] service tonight and we pray that you'll
[31:10] teach us as we sit at your feet Lord and
[31:12] learn bless brother Donnie sister Carol
[31:16] uh Lord the Parker family all of the
[31:18] families involved bless them and
[31:20] encourage them this evening in the
[31:22] months to come with your grace I pray
[31:24] and your comfort at at this this time be
[31:28] with them we pray in the name of the
[31:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[31:32] amen God bless you may be
[31:37] seated so when we start talking about
[31:40] the New Testament now the scriptures
[31:42] that mention the Holy Ghost uh we want
[31:45] to enter that a little bit tonight and
[31:47] um talk about it and see what we can
[31:50] learn from it how many wants to learn
[31:52] more about it
[31:55] amen so here's some points that I've
[31:58] been laying uh down in uh many parts of
[32:01] this series and the Lord just keeps
[32:03] leading me there and you'll find it
[32:05] tonight as well but it seems like the
[32:07] Lord really wants us to draw a
[32:10] distinction in the atmosphere of the
[32:13] Holy Ghost and the things that he can be
[32:15] doing when he comes down and the
[32:17] difference in that and you going deeper
[32:20] in something in the soul level happening
[32:23] because remember I said last Wednesday
[32:25] night he comes he'll pour out his Spirit
[32:27] upon All Flesh but his intention is not
[32:29] just to put it on your flesh or your
[32:31] spirit cuz how many knows you can
[32:34] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[32:35] your spirit and not your soul so what
[32:39] when he comes and pours out his Spirit
[32:40] he may do many things but his intention
[32:43] is to fill you on your soul level so
[32:45] that your desires change and that you
[32:48] will have that in you that identifies
[32:50] the word for your age and that you can
[32:52] follow it and be obedient to it so in in
[32:55] line with that I just want to bring up
[32:56] some reminder statements and that in the
[32:58] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost people will
[33:02] uh be affected people will get better
[33:05] actually people will actually feel
[33:06] better even though they might not go
[33:09] deeper if you're in the atmosphere in
[33:10] the presence of the Lord and the Holy
[33:12] Ghost is there you you're probably going
[33:14] to feel
[33:15] better you can be affected in many ways
[33:18] when the Holy Ghost is there no doubt
[33:20] all sitting here tonight are under the
[33:23] work of the Holy Ghost in some way in
[33:25] your life you could I won't ask for
[33:27] hands but I could that that everybody
[33:30] sitting here this evening and listening
[33:32] online is somehow under a work of the
[33:35] Holy Ghost and he's been dealing with
[33:36] your life in some way at some level he's
[33:39] dealing with you and so the stage even
[33:42] the stages that we come through in
[33:45] serving the lord all those stages are
[33:48] actually a work of the Holy Ghost when
[33:50] you repent it's because he led you to
[33:53] repent when you were out in the world
[33:55] the Holy Ghost knew where you were
[33:57] matter of fact one place brother BR says
[33:59] he comes and finds you he hunts you out
[34:01] he hunts the elected for that age and
[34:03] finds you in a factory or in a school
[34:05] you're a school teacher you're in a bar
[34:08] whatever it is he knows where you so he
[34:09] hunts you out to come and find you
[34:11] because you're not meant to be in a bar
[34:13] you're meant to be a son and daughter of
[34:14] God so he hunts those that are his and
[34:17] goes and catches them and finds them and
[34:19] brings them to his throne all the stages
[34:22] that God deals with our life is actually
[34:25] by him the Holy Ghost
[34:28] justification a stage of coming in
[34:30] Repentance uh these are all things that
[34:33] he's leading you and then we find
[34:35] there's a time when he comes in you and
[34:38] becomes sealed into you until the day of
[34:41] Redemption how many know that Hebrews
[34:43] says he seals Us by the Holy Ghost not
[34:47] until the next
[34:49] Revival not until the next youth cap but
[34:53] he can so it's so powerful that he can
[34:56] can seal his spirit in you in your soul
[35:00] and seal the devil
[35:02] out in your soul level and you're sealed
[35:05] not until the next service you're sealed
[35:09] until the day of redemption no wonder
[35:12] the devil doesn't like the Holy Ghost
[35:13] because when it hits that he can't get
[35:15] to their soul he can't influence their
[35:18] soul their desire is towards the things
[35:20] of God and they're going to say Amen to
[35:22] the word of God and follow the rest of
[35:24] their lives the rest of their lives
[35:26] they're sealed they may make mistakes
[35:29] they may they may go through hard times
[35:31] they may go through sickness because
[35:33] remember the only thing the devil is
[35:35] left with is your outer two Realms he
[35:37] can't get to your soul it's sealed in so
[35:38] the only thing is left with is your
[35:40] spirit your emotions and your body so
[35:43] guess what until you get your new body
[35:45] you're going to get sick and the devil
[35:47] loves it when you get sick he it's the
[35:50] devil that brings sickness you all know
[35:51] that right yeah it's the devil and we
[35:54] have all the new names for stuff but
[35:56] really it's it's demons trying to hinder
[35:58] your physical body and that's why we
[35:59] pray and rebuke those demons say God
[36:02] make me well by your atonement because
[36:04] it's the devil's trying to make me sick
[36:07] why because he only has your physical
[36:09] body and your emotions sometimes to
[36:11] dabble in and bring you down that's why
[36:14] the Holy Ghost on the inside when it's
[36:16] strong and it it rises above and said no
[36:18] no no you're not even going to control
[36:20] my spirit or my body I'm going to claim
[36:23] the atonement and I'm going to have
[36:25] Victory not only in my whole until the
[36:27] day of R I'm going to have victory in my
[36:29] spirit and I'm going to be healed by the
[36:31] blood of the Lamb that's the way we deal
[36:33] with the devil because a lot of people
[36:35] just beat let the devil beat them up in
[36:37] their thinking beat them up in their
[36:38] emotions beat them up in physical
[36:40] sickness and they become used to that
[36:42] sickness and they complain about it they
[36:44] live with it the rest of their lives and
[36:46] they're they give in in other words they
[36:48] said I guess this is my trial I guess
[36:50] I'll always have this we should never
[36:52] settle for second best when we have an
[36:54] atonement that says you are healed
[36:58] God takes somebody but we never stop
[37:00] believing that God can heal
[37:02] somebody cuz he said it I didn't say it
[37:05] he said it and I'm going to continue to
[37:07] believe it until God says that person's
[37:10] time is finished I'm going to believe it
[37:12] till the next second the last second
[37:14] excuse me praise the Lord so now there's
[37:18] a time when he leads you these are
[37:19] different segments of our life and so
[37:22] but I desire for us to understand
[37:24] further the true meaning of the Holy
[37:26] Ghost
[37:27] being more than just repentance more
[37:30] than Brokenness more than crying these
[37:32] are things that would lead to it more
[37:34] than emotion the Holy Ghost is more than
[37:37] just a rush of enthusiasm I I felt so
[37:41] enthused and I felt oh I such a rush of
[37:44] something but it it has to be deeper
[37:46] than that and we love enthusiasm and and
[37:50] sometimes I'll just say this people can
[37:52] get under the enthusiasm and they think
[37:54] it's the spirit of God and they'll even
[37:56] prophesy I a wrong prophecy a wrong Pro
[37:59] this is a thing that I still to this day
[38:01] it's difficult for me to understand but
[38:03] somebody can be led it's the Holy Spirit
[38:06] but brings something sometimes the Holy
[38:08] Spirit brings something dead on and then
[38:10] some sometimes somebody speaks in their
[38:12] own enthusiasm or their own burden and
[38:14] it's not dead on and it's wrong we're
[38:16] taught in the message that if that
[38:18] happens you got to repent of
[38:21] it you're going to repent of that
[38:23] because it wasn't God that told you to
[38:25] say that if it's not true and it doesn't
[38:28] come to
[38:29] pass it's good Bible teaching right we
[38:31] know these things right we don't dabble
[38:34] in these things and so it's a very
[38:35] serious thing when when that happens but
[38:38] sometimes uh brother BR says that
[38:41] somebody can just be under an enthusiasm
[38:44] speak something thinking it's the word
[38:46] of the Lord and they they uh they go
[38:49] with it and uh we don't want just
[38:51] enthusiasm but we really want to be
[38:53] spirit-led and Spirit-filled even a
[38:56] sanct ified life sometimes can be an
[38:58] Evidence because I'm Sanctified that
[39:01] means I have the Holy Ghost there are
[39:03] many people that sanctify their lives
[39:05] from the world and C cut themselves off
[39:07] from the world and don't dress like the
[39:10] world and don't act like the world there
[39:11] are many groups that do that I think
[39:13] it's a good thing the more sanctified
[39:14] people we can have on this planet Earth
[39:16] praise the Lord for
[39:18] them but that's not the evidence that
[39:21] you have it in your
[39:23] soul that's a work of the Holy Ghost
[39:25] that's a work of him but this got to be
[39:27] and so I've been drawing these
[39:30] distinctions and I do it this is not to
[39:32] take away from anything that the Lord
[39:35] has given you or to discourage you all
[39:37] it's not for that purpose it's to show
[39:39] you that a deeper experience with God a
[39:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[39:44] that will put you in a
[39:46] Rapture the oil in your soul will put
[39:50] you in a
[39:52] Rapture what is the new birth then it is
[39:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:57] personally to you not that you joined a
[39:59] church not that you were around where
[40:01] the Revelation was being preached but it
[40:03] is the new birth is the revelation of
[40:05] Jesus Christ personally to you that's
[40:08] jumping right to exactly what it is
[40:10] that's the evidence and when you have it
[40:13] people ask when you have it when you
[40:14] have the real thing what will you do and
[40:18] I think we'll get into some specifics
[40:20] with that further in the study but
[40:22] tonight let me say What You Won't Do
[40:25] okay if you have the Holy Ghost this is
[40:29] this is what you won't do with it you
[40:31] will never deny or turn down any of the
[40:35] word of
[40:37] God you won't do that it can't do that
[40:42] you'll never deny or turn down any of
[40:45] that's why a prophet would refer to
[40:47] those people sometimes who believe the
[40:49] days of Miracles is passed he said you
[40:52] can't have the Holy Ghost and ever say
[40:54] something like that because the Bible
[40:56] ible says he's the same yesterday today
[40:58] and forever so if he says he's the same
[41:01] and whatever he did 2,000 years ago
[41:02] whatever he did he's able to do it again
[41:06] so the Holy Ghost in you which is the
[41:08] author of the word if it says that it's
[41:10] I don't care how it looks the word will
[41:13] always it'll never deny and start saying
[41:15] you know what I'm starting to believe
[41:16] there is no Miracles today and you can
[41:18] find churches that believe the day days
[41:20] of Miracles are passed they they know he
[41:22] doesn't do Miracles anymore but you'll
[41:24] never have the evidence of the Holy
[41:26] Ghost you'll never have something there
[41:27] when it's denying a part of the word
[41:29] that's so Crystal Clear you you can't
[41:32] that's not what the Holy Ghost does you
[41:33] can never deny or turn down the word of
[41:36] God you can't and also I believe you
[41:38] will never leave Christ and go back to
[41:40] the world and backslide there's got to
[41:43] be something stronger in you with the
[41:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost that would
[41:47] keep you can you say am man from denying
[41:50] Christ and going back into the things of
[41:52] the world say well there's people that
[41:53] do that well they had a lot of of God
[41:56] praise the Lord for what he did but
[41:58] somewhere along the line it wasn't
[42:00] enough to hold
[42:02] them when we sing something keeps
[42:04] holding me it's not you and if it's
[42:07] holding you for heading back full steam
[42:10] to the things of the world you didn't
[42:12] get something deep enough to start out
[42:14] with is that okay with everybody amen
[42:17] that's why we pray for those to come
[42:18] back because they didn't say well look
[42:20] at all these people they leave and all
[42:21] these other things and so you just pray
[42:23] they must not had something real solid
[42:25] enough because you can never deny Christ
[42:28] or deny the word when you have the Holy
[42:30] Ghost in your soul you can't do it
[42:33] that's more than conscience that's more
[42:34] than a message conscience a message
[42:36] conscience will keep you out of trouble
[42:38] pretty good but I'm not preaching a
[42:40] message conscience I'm preaching
[42:41] something that's so deep that you're
[42:43] sealed in and the devil is sealed out
[42:46] and what you desire is the word of God
[42:49] the the Holy Ghost is linked with the
[42:51] fresh word sent to lead you into more
[42:53] truth so so and that that's where it's
[42:56] at it's tied to the word the Holy Ghost
[42:58] is always tied to the word the feelings
[43:00] the blessings the emotions the gifts the
[43:02] enthusiasm the outpouring of the Holy
[43:05] Ghost is not the best thing to say there
[43:07] is the Holy Ghost there is the evidence
[43:10] that's not the best thing even though
[43:11] these are outpourings these are
[43:13] manifestations of his true Holy Spirit
[43:15] many times you see and and we look to
[43:18] that and say well that must be the
[43:19] evidence we can't look to that it's it's
[43:22] it's what the it's what the fresh word
[43:24] that God has given it's what the spirit
[43:27] is saying to the church now and the
[43:29] Bible says he that hath an ear to hear
[43:33] what the spirit is saying to the church
[43:36] now that's the evidence of the Holy
[43:39] Ghost you have an ear to hear it there's
[43:41] something in you that's saying Amen to
[43:43] it you have a reception for it you have
[43:46] a an antenna you're like a
[43:50] TV am I really saying
[43:53] this you're like a TV with an antenna
[43:56] and if you got the Holy Ghost you have
[43:58] only have one channel and the antenna is
[44:01] picking up the true word of God can you
[44:03] say amen and bringing it so it'll be
[44:05] lived out not in a bunch of books and
[44:07] and a Bible but it's to be lived out
[44:09] you're a tel you're you're a television
[44:12] to express God's Vision only one channel
[44:15] and that's the word for this hour to
[44:16] live it out for this hour so if you've
[44:18] got the Holy Ghost you got an antenna
[44:20] and it's only drawn in that station it's
[44:23] only drawn in that thing so that you can
[44:25] manifest that over over that one
[44:27] television station it's very limited and
[44:30] I'm glad it's
[44:31] limited oh praise the Lord science been
[44:35] begin to develop things like television
[44:37] but all of it is a type of where the
[44:40] spiritual man is going the astronauts
[44:42] and all that was a type of where we're
[44:44] going spiritually the horse and buggy
[44:46] the automobile can you say me the
[44:48] airplane the the the spaceship can you
[44:50] say Amen it's all showing where we're
[44:52] going spiritually by the Holy Ghost and
[44:55] so if you come out out with a TV that
[44:57] pulls in a certain Channel and expresses
[45:00] the image of that there's only one image
[45:02] that I want to express in my television
[45:04] and that's the image of Jesus Christ the
[45:07] word for this hour you can live Luther's
[45:09] day or Wesley's day but the message of
[45:12] this hour is to be lived through his
[45:13] bride and you're going to see it in her
[45:15] life you got an antenna for it you you
[45:17] draw that in it draw you draw it in and
[45:20] it displays on your screen first time
[45:23] that you have the Holy Ghost used in the
[45:24] New Testament is concerning the
[45:27] conception of Christ in Mary and uh it's
[45:31] it's the Holy Ghost is used mostly in
[45:33] the Bible around the birth of Christ
[45:37] okay and the other place that's used
[45:40] most often is around the birth of the
[45:43] church so both of them are births this
[45:45] term the Holy Ghost is used mostly
[45:47] around the birth of Christ and then the
[45:50] birth of the church and last Wednesday
[45:52] night we were saying that he came as the
[45:54] Masterpiece at the end of the old Old
[45:56] Testament he had all the prophets and
[45:58] God was trying to say something and get
[45:59] to his final Masterpiece or at least it
[46:01] looked like his final one he comes and
[46:04] Jesus was his Masterpiece of God being
[46:06] in man he finished it out can you say
[46:08] Amen so the birth of Christ that's why
[46:10] it's saying the Holy Ghost because it's
[46:11] bringing that Masterpiece up then at
[46:14] Calvary he took a piece of himself out
[46:16] and now he's going to have a masterpiece
[46:18] bride to restore not only the second
[46:20] Adam but the second Eve after 2,000
[46:23] years he takes a piece of the master and
[46:25] begin to build a masterpiece through her
[46:27] can you say Amen so now you can see why
[46:29] at the birth of Jesus and at the birth
[46:32] of the Church Holy Ghost is
[46:35] mentioned creation of God how many knows
[46:38] the Bible says that Jesus was the
[46:40] beginning of the creation of
[46:43] God so it says Jesus was the beginning
[46:47] if it says he's the beginning that he's
[46:48] going to have more of a creation he's
[46:50] going to have more Sons and Daughters of
[46:52] God and they're not going to be church
[46:55] members that are putting out a religion
[46:58] they're going to be who they are by a
[47:00] creation inside them the god the Creator
[47:04] will come down and create something
[47:07] within them this is this is a whole
[47:09] different level than
[47:12] denominational putting it on or a ritual
[47:15] to live by or a dress code to live by
[47:18] has zero to do with that even though it
[47:20] will live out those things this is not
[47:24] religion this is a creation of God in
[47:28] you glory be to God so we see this Holy
[47:32] Ghost around and now hopefully it's a
[47:34] curiosity for you to read your Bible at
[47:37] this Christmas time coming up you can
[47:39] read your Bible because Holy Ghost Holy
[47:41] Ghost and the Holy Ghost said this to
[47:43] Zacharias and the Holy Ghost filled Anna
[47:46] and the Holy Ghost so now you never hear
[47:48] this term now you start hearing it
[47:50] around the birth of Christ all right so
[47:53] now uh it's around the birth of Christ
[47:57] and it's around the birth of the church
[48:00] in both places it has a similar we have
[48:03] a similar similar thing going on the
[48:05] spirit of God becoming one with Humanity
[48:09] the spirit of God becoming one with
[48:12] Humanity no longer was it just an
[48:14] anointing on a prophet to prophesy no
[48:17] longer was it just in the air around
[48:20] God's people showing himself around
[48:23] showing himself in a pillar of Fire
[48:25] shung himself in a in in in a cloud
[48:28] above the children of Israel no longer
[48:30] was it just that he can still do that
[48:32] and he has done that but this is a this
[48:35] is honing in on a specific creation that
[48:39] will be the creation of God and man now
[48:41] was God a Creator before that he's
[48:43] always been the Creator and he created
[48:45] heavens and earth and he created all
[48:46] these other things he spoke those Stars
[48:48] into existence and told them where to go
[48:50] in their positions and God the great
[48:53] Creator had his first creation but this
[48:55] this would be the beginning of the
[48:57] creation of God it's not that he hasn't
[48:59] created before it's that now this will
[49:02] be let me word it different this will be
[49:04] the beginning of the creation of God in
[49:09] humanity praise the Lord the beginning
[49:12] of the creation of God in humanity now
[49:15] we're talking the holy ghost in the
[49:19] soul and so now we see that no longer
[49:22] will it be anointing on a prophet or a
[49:25] prophet phcy or the air just around
[49:27] God's people and showing the pillar of
[49:29] fire it would not just be around human
[49:31] beings it would Unite with them it
[49:34] started a new creation in Mary a
[49:36] creation of God being in man God
[49:38] becoming flesh so it would no longer be
[49:40] God above us that was the Old Testament
[49:43] it would not just be God With Us that's
[49:46] Jesus Christ but its intention was to be
[49:49] God in us by a new creation Now if
[49:51] you're a Bible reader you will think of
[49:53] the scripture that actually says says
[49:55] those that have come in Christ those
[49:57] that have Christ are a new creation they
[50:00] are a new Creator creature excuse me
[50:03] Creator they are a new creature all
[50:05] things that are past are in the past all
[50:08] things are old All Things become new you
[50:11] are a brand new
[50:14] creation and God created what was inside
[50:17] you that's the Holy Ghost he starts
[50:20] over he starts a new creation in you
[50:24] isn't the grace of God
[50:25] that you can just say Lord thank you you
[50:28] start over and boy did he ever start
[50:31] over with you because you were a piece
[50:34] of
[50:35] work he didn't say let me just take what
[50:38] I got here and work with it he said no
[50:39] it's a brand new creation I'm G to start
[50:41] from the soul and I'm going to create
[50:43] something brand new this will be the new
[50:45] you big time the new you and then it
[50:48] work itself out brother BR says it works
[50:50] itself and it pushes out from the soul
[50:53] and you keep growing in Christ is push
[50:55] pushes up into into your life and takes
[50:58] over your body Christ pushes his way out
[51:01] up into your mouth that you stop cussing
[51:03] and you stop swearing and this mouth is
[51:06] used to give glory to God it doesn't
[51:08] gossip
[51:11] anymore it's not used to bring
[51:13] accusations against Elders anymore he's
[51:16] the Holy Ghost is pushing out into your
[51:18] mouth somebody give me an amen tonight
[51:21] the Holy Ghost pushes out as you grow
[51:23] and then it pushes out into your eyes
[51:25] that you only want to look at the right
[51:27] things then the Holy Ghost he says
[51:29] pushes into your very mind and your
[51:31] thinking that let this mind be in you
[51:34] which was in Christ
[51:36] Jesus and you become you change your
[51:39] thinking let this mind be in you so it
[51:41] it keeps pushing out until you just
[51:43] become a vessel that's filled with the
[51:46] Holy Spirit but it starts with a new
[51:48] creation in here and that's the Holy
[51:50] Ghost so now we see then this was a new
[51:53] creation he started in Mary this was a
[51:55] cre cretion of God being in man this was
[51:58] God becoming flesh really really not
[52:01] just trying to be like God this was God
[52:03] coming in flesh there's a big difference
[52:05] in man trying to be like God and God
[52:08] coming in man and living out in flesh
[52:11] this is his creation God being in flesh
[52:14] and so we are Mary the Holy Ghost was
[52:17] there there present to bring new life to
[52:20] bring something brand new to birth
[52:23] something new and in this case it was C
[52:26] going to cause Mary to conceive by the
[52:30] Holy Ghost to conceive a new life within
[52:32] her now Mary didn't have anything to do
[52:35] with that and that's why Mary didn't get
[52:37] the Holy Ghost there herself personally
[52:40] but she was used as a a as a vessel that
[52:44] God would put that seed in her to bring
[52:46] that new life so I can use her as a type
[52:49] of what happens to us even though Mary
[52:51] had to go to the upper room and she was
[52:53] in the upper room to receive the Holy
[52:54] Ghost for for herself but this was so
[52:57] powerful that God would take a girl and
[52:59] I'm going to begin my creation uh and
[53:02] often when I'm talking about the serpent
[53:04] seed and what happened in the garden my
[53:06] question is always um why did we why did
[53:10] Jesus have to be virgin born and so
[53:14] because he just was that's the answer no
[53:16] no think about it why did Jesus have to
[53:19] become virgin born without sexual
[53:22] relations the normal way everybody's
[53:24] born why did he have to be virgin Bo
[53:26] without the sexual relations and finally
[53:28] they just start
[53:31] because it exposes what happened in the
[53:34] garden we were supposed to come by the
[53:37] creation of God Adam could have created
[53:40] his children but Satan come in and now a
[53:44] secondary way of children being born by
[53:48] seexual
[53:49] relations grace of God steps in says you
[53:52] know what I'll take this Fallen creation
[53:55] what wasn't supposed to happen that way
[53:56] but in my plan I'll be a savior CU I'm
[53:59] in in my heart I can't save somebody for
[54:02] their condition unless they're
[54:04] lost so God says down the road I'll
[54:07] switch this around and I'll take my
[54:09] grace will now take a sborn man or woman
[54:12] and by his grace I'll change their
[54:16] nature I'll create a virginity
[54:20] spiritually speaking amen it's powerful
[54:24] so I asked I said how something happened
[54:27] in the garden then that we don't realize
[54:30] it was more than just eating an apple
[54:32] why did he have to be virgin more
[54:33] because he had to he had to change what
[54:36] took place in the garden to bring us
[54:38] into a fallen condition virgin born knew
[54:41] creation so Mary causing Mary to
[54:44] conceive we are
[54:46] natural Holy Ghost that's spiritual so
[54:49] here the natural connects with the
[54:51] spiritual never before happened quite
[54:53] this way that the natural man man and
[54:55] this is a woman uh Mary natural she was
[54:59] natural there wasn't anything really
[55:01] spiritual about her except for what I'm
[55:04] going to read in a minute something
[55:06] within her begin to Rose and believe the
[55:08] word of God be done to me according to
[55:09] Thy word but she was just a common girl
[55:11] just like the girls here anybody else
[55:13] common girl in the world she loved the
[55:15] Lord but there wasn't anything special
[55:18] about her she was natural she was just a
[55:20] young girl God takes the natural and he
[55:23] takes his spirit and he Blends the two
[55:25] together and that's what we call
[55:29] Supernatural the natural and the
[55:31] spiritual become
[55:34] Supernatural got that
[55:37] everybody that's my visual
[55:40] tonight the natural and the spiritual
[55:43] come connected and become Supernatural
[55:47] your new birth is
[55:49] not being a better boy or
[55:53] girl it is super natural it is a new
[55:57] creation and don't you ever settle for
[56:00] anything less young person don't settle
[56:02] for anything else religion isn't working
[56:04] anymore even in the message religion
[56:07] isn't the smear on the message is not
[56:09] working anymore it won't get you through
[56:10] won't give you a good marriage won't
[56:12] give you a good family you have nothing
[56:14] to build upon only the new creation of
[56:16] God by the Holy Ghost is and that's why
[56:18] you need to ask God for it I need it in
[56:20] my life this is not a religion this is
[56:23] not I'm okay because I'm in the message
[56:25] this is a new creation this is a
[56:27] supernatural thing that will happen in
[56:30] you Hallelujah so now how many know a
[56:33] woman and a man have to be together for
[56:36] New Life to conceive how many of you
[56:38] know how many you know that a man and
[56:40] woman have to be together sexually for
[56:43] something to conceive to bring forth
[56:44] another life it's the same way in the
[56:46] spiritual you have to connect with God
[56:50] spiritually so new life can begin in you
[56:53] you can't say I'm doing my own thing I
[56:55] don't need this I I go to church I'm
[56:57] fine I'm good no no you got to connect
[57:00] with Jesus Christ you have to connect
[57:02] with him there has to be a spiritual
[57:04] Supernatural connection for something
[57:07] other than yourself to conceive within
[57:10] yourself and so now that's what happens
[57:12] naturally that's what happens with god
[57:15] he has children to produce in his mind
[57:17] before the foundation of the world but
[57:19] there has to be a bedding ground there
[57:20] has to be a place for that seed to come
[57:22] in that seed to be triggered and come to
[57:25] life and that's in his predestinated
[57:27] bride that that Holy Ghost will come to
[57:29] it's only meant to go there it's not
[57:30] just to get a give a happy feeling when
[57:32] it comes and he he brings his seed it's
[57:35] to come into His elect and bring forth
[57:37] and conceive a brand new life somebody
[57:40] ought to say
[57:41] Amen this is the purpose of the Holy
[57:44] Ghost that is why he comes with his word
[57:46] to bring Oneness to to to make a
[57:49] connection a spiritual contact notice
[57:52] when that seed was planted in Mary she
[57:55] did not the moment it was planted in her
[57:58] she did not feel one
[58:01] thing there's no record to say that Mary
[58:04] said at that moment I felt different we
[58:07] don't have a record of that she did not
[58:09] say uh say I feel I feel different Bible
[58:13] says the first thing is she had a
[58:16] powerful powerful uh belief in the the
[58:20] god of the impossibilities the god that
[58:22] could do the impossible she Rose to the
[58:24] occasion and she says you got to imagine
[58:27] friends she don't understand any of this
[58:30] this is beyond
[58:32] understanding it reminds me of people
[58:34] that come in sometimes and they
[58:37] sometimes if they haven't been churched
[58:40] sometimes they're better off that not
[58:41] have been churched and grow raised up in
[58:44] the
[58:45] church but it reminds me people come
[58:48] sometimes
[58:49] and if it was about the knowledge of the
[58:52] word and what's being preached even
[58:54] tonight over the Pulpit probably 90% of
[58:57] it they'd say in their minds thinking
[59:00] and trying to I don't have a clue what
[59:03] the man's talking
[59:04] about I do not understand this is way
[59:08] over my head but every once in a while
[59:10] something Supernatural happens to that
[59:13] person something kicks in Beyond
[59:17] this and the smallest little thing gets
[59:21] their attention I need God I need God
[59:25] and I don't understand everything he's
[59:26] saying there I've had people lots of
[59:28] people come and say when I first came
[59:31] now I'm beginning to understand now the
[59:33] words opening to me but when I first
[59:35] came I didn't have a clue what you're
[59:36] talking about but I knew I sense the
[59:38] presence of God something triggered in
[59:40] my heart I knew I've never felt love
[59:42] like this hello I've never felt an
[59:46] atmosphere there I've never they say
[59:48] this about a church it's it's funny how
[59:50] others don't say it but they say I've
[59:52] never felt love like I felt in that
[59:54] congregation being there it's just so
[59:56] these things look at the look at the
[59:58] Holiness look at the pure Spirit look at
[1:00:00] the things that are not seeing every day
[1:00:02] in this world and they come into our
[1:00:04] atmosphere and it's other things that
[1:00:05] draw their Hungry Heart than just the
[1:00:08] technicality of the word matter of fact
[1:00:11] if I'm if I'm uh and I know that seed of
[1:00:14] God it'll respond to the word of God it
[1:00:16] it's not going to resist it but we'll
[1:00:18] see they only come in on a very simple
[1:00:21] natural thing sometimes but they start
[1:00:23] to believe in God begins to do something
[1:00:25] Supernatural in them praise the Lord I
[1:00:28] don't know if she's listening or not I
[1:00:29] don't want to embarrass her but what a
[1:00:30] work that the Lord is doing by this
[1:00:33] sister Holly that's been coming to
[1:00:34] service every Sunday and we were able to
[1:00:37] have supper with her and praise be to
[1:00:39] God and she just listened to the
[1:00:41] broadcast the first of the year and
[1:00:42] started visiting and she's very excited
[1:00:46] very excited about the word of God grew
[1:00:50] up in a Baptist church and I'm sure she
[1:00:52] would share her testimony with you but
[1:00:54] grew up in a Baptist Church and found us
[1:00:57] and just just excited about what the
[1:01:01] Lord is opening up to
[1:01:04] her amen you never know how God's going
[1:01:07] to catch an elected of
[1:01:09] God but a lot of times it's not because
[1:01:12] they had this great understanding of the
[1:01:13] word can you say Amen a lot of times
[1:01:16] it's not that and Mary she didn't feel
[1:01:18] anything at the beginning she didn't uh
[1:01:21] she didn't have that that very moment
[1:01:23] and she did not say I feel different she
[1:01:26] believed what God Said and she could
[1:01:29] have had Rebellion or she could and by
[1:01:31] the way does anybody know that what
[1:01:32] Mary's name means um what does her name
[1:01:36] mean I'm glad you
[1:01:39] ask it means bitterness it means
[1:01:44] Rebellion that's what the nature of the
[1:01:46] name that she was born with and so you
[1:01:49] know your name goes with your nature a
[1:01:50] little bit so God chooses a girl whose
[1:01:53] name has bitterness and Rebellion to it
[1:01:56] that's her nature her normal tendency
[1:01:58] would be look at this all and say no way
[1:02:02] no way Jose that would be the normal
[1:02:05] response for her to be to something that
[1:02:07] the angel first of all Angels meeting
[1:02:09] with her it's like who am I uh cyesis
[1:02:13] the priest have you stopped by the
[1:02:16] temple I mean who am I the Angels
[1:02:18] visiting this young 15-year-old girl
[1:02:21] praise the Lord and here he visits
[1:02:24] already an angel and he says I you're
[1:02:27] highly favored of God you you're special
[1:02:31] God has chosen you for a special thing
[1:02:33] comes into that room tells her that and
[1:02:36] now she's everything in her nature
[1:02:39] everything would resist and say no I I'm
[1:02:43] not doing this and God chose somebody
[1:02:45] like that so that something rises in her
[1:02:48] to override even what she's feeling in
[1:02:51] her nature to say whatever your word
[1:02:54] says says be it unto me according to
[1:02:56] your word
[1:02:59] Lord the word of God and the Holy Ghost
[1:03:02] moving on you is more powerful than your
[1:03:06] resistance if he's going to get you he's
[1:03:08] going to get you and he won't make you
[1:03:10] go against your will but he just makes
[1:03:12] you willing to
[1:03:13] go amen went against her own name to
[1:03:17] receive that she reached out of her
[1:03:19] rebellion and said I believe it I'm
[1:03:21] willing to Bear the approach and I'm
[1:03:23] willing to be laugh at you know it
[1:03:25] doesn't take long to go through your
[1:03:26] mind all that's going to happen now
[1:03:28] she's with Joseph engaged to him they
[1:03:31] haven't been together yet which is the
[1:03:32] way it's supposed to be by the way can I
[1:03:35] get an amen how many still believes the
[1:03:36] word of God they haven't been together
[1:03:38] that's why she could tell an angel an
[1:03:40] angel standing there say how can this be
[1:03:42] see and I haven't had sexual relations
[1:03:44] with Joseph that's the way it's supposed
[1:03:46] to be and so so so now she says that to
[1:03:49] him and she comes and she says be it
[1:03:52] unto me I'm willing to to Bear the
[1:03:54] reproach she's thinking I'll be laughed
[1:03:56] at people will not understand this but
[1:03:59] if God chose me then so be it I receive
[1:04:01] it in Jesus name whatever happens now
[1:04:04] whatever persecution whatever it takes I
[1:04:07] am with God be it unto me let the word
[1:04:10] and let this new life begin in me can
[1:04:13] you say praise the Lord that was a
[1:04:15] response from a girl that was supposed
[1:04:16] to be rebellious God knows how to take
[1:04:18] some of you young people God knows how
[1:04:20] to deal with your Rebellion you should
[1:04:23] you should submit a little early ear
[1:04:24] because you could go through a lot of
[1:04:26] things but he's got your number he's got
[1:04:28] your number and you keep resisting he
[1:04:30] knows how to deal with that when he does
[1:04:32] it just raise your hand and say thank
[1:04:34] you for loving me Lord if he did it to a
[1:04:37] Mary who had the nature of rebellion he
[1:04:39] can come to you something rose up and
[1:04:42] said I don't understand any of this but
[1:04:46] let it happen in
[1:04:50] me I don't have a clue of 90% of what
[1:04:53] Brother Paul's preaching but he's
[1:04:55] preaching the Holy Spirit and let it
[1:04:57] begin in me be it unto me according to
[1:05:01] what he's preaching let it be in my life
[1:05:04] not my parents not the preacher be it
[1:05:08] unto Mary said be that unto
[1:05:11] me personalize it at that moment she
[1:05:14] felt nothing but very soon after she
[1:05:16] felt changes very soon after she felt
[1:05:18] changes it changed her life and now she
[1:05:21] knew what he said was true because she
[1:05:23] was Chang changing heard a testimony a
[1:05:25] couple days ago is that now you start to
[1:05:27] see the results there's a change of
[1:05:29] desires there's a love for the word of
[1:05:31] God there's a incredible hunger for the
[1:05:33] word of God now it wasn't there before
[1:05:35] there's a change of my desires I don't
[1:05:37] desire the things of the world anymore
[1:05:39] but but the devil's still beating me up
[1:05:40] but listen now that's the evidences
[1:05:42] Something's Happened you can't see
[1:05:44] what's happened but you start to see the
[1:05:46] evidence Mary at that moment couldn't
[1:05:48] see what was conceived but it wasn't
[1:05:50] long she began to feel the baby kit she
[1:05:52] began to be it began to be pushed out in
[1:05:55] her life and she could see it's really
[1:05:57] happening it's in
[1:05:59] me
[1:06:01] Hallelujah she wanted to Proclaim it as
[1:06:04] she grew the changes began so great she
[1:06:07] could never ignore those changes now she
[1:06:09] could not hide it she couldn't H hide
[1:06:11] her she couldn't hide her belly
[1:06:15] anymore y'all are quiet tonight she
[1:06:18] couldn't hide her belly anymore and
[1:06:21] something happened to her and she
[1:06:22] couldn't hide anymore and she didn't
[1:06:23] want to hide it anymore she was standing
[1:06:26] on the word of God God had done
[1:06:27] something her and you could see
[1:06:28] something happen now the world's going
[1:06:30] to look and laugh at those changes hello
[1:06:34] the world's going to make fun of those
[1:06:35] changes and laugh at those changes but
[1:06:38] Mary rejoiced in
[1:06:40] it Elizabeth rejoiced in
[1:06:43] it it was so powerful that when Mary
[1:06:46] said hello Elizabeth God bless you a
[1:06:50] baby that was laying dormant in
[1:06:51] Elizabeth jumped up and come alive how
[1:06:55] many know you canect you can affect
[1:06:57] other people your Holy Ghost can trigger
[1:06:59] the holy ghost coming in someone
[1:07:01] else just her
[1:07:04] salutation and Elizabeth was praising
[1:07:06] the Lord with Mary you'll find people I
[1:07:09] was reading what the prophet said today
[1:07:12] he said Mary couldn't hang
[1:07:14] around she couldn't hang around where
[1:07:16] she was at in the town she was in
[1:07:19] because she knew she was going to be
[1:07:21] laughed at her and Joseph engaged she's
[1:07:23] pregnant it it's going to be a mark on
[1:07:25] her life so she needed to be around some
[1:07:28] people that would she could fellowship
[1:07:30] with so she left uh Nazareth and she
[1:07:34] went to see Elizabeth in another city
[1:07:37] for about six months because she needed
[1:07:39] to be around Fellowship that would
[1:07:41] encourage what the Lord was doing in her
[1:07:46] life you just keep hanging around the
[1:07:48] wrong crowd keep getting with the guys
[1:07:50] and the girls and the girls and all you
[1:07:52] keep hanging around the wrong ones
[1:07:53] they're not going to encourage you in
[1:07:55] the lord they're not going to encourage
[1:07:56] you to get the Holy Ghost they might
[1:07:57] even laugh at you if you cry and weep
[1:08:00] and get the Holy Ghost they may laugh at
[1:08:01] you you're so-called friends Mary had to
[1:08:04] get around people that were going to
[1:08:06] encourage
[1:08:07] her and not mock
[1:08:09] her oh boy we could preach more on that
[1:08:11] but listen now we're going to be brief
[1:08:13] tonight and so now we just want to
[1:08:15] finish this Mary she the changes begin
[1:08:18] to happen she could no longer be a
[1:08:20] secret
[1:08:22] Christian she could no longer be a
[1:08:25] secret Christian she did not want to
[1:08:27] hide it and she could not hide it she
[1:08:29] did not manufacture anything it was
[1:08:32] something inside and it begin to show on
[1:08:35] the outside that's the Holy Ghost
[1:08:37] working from the inside out I want you
[1:08:40] to see something now as we just bring
[1:08:43] this down and then we're going to read
[1:08:45] something we'll be finished tonight has
[1:08:46] anybody learned anything amen good so
[1:08:51] there was churches in that day of Mary
[1:08:54] that were meeting and talking about him
[1:08:57] coming there were those who had the Holy
[1:09:02] Ghost come and tell them that he was on
[1:09:05] his way so you you got a big uh
[1:09:09] environment of not only people were
[1:09:11] looking for the first coming and the
[1:09:12] Messiah to come they didn't know how he
[1:09:14] would come but they were still singing
[1:09:16] about it tons of churches waiting for
[1:09:18] the coming of the Lord singing about the
[1:09:20] coming of the Lord reading the the
[1:09:22] prophecies about the coming of the Lord
[1:09:24] we live in a day like that if you're
[1:09:26] listening online if you're listening to
[1:09:28] the broadcast we live in a day that we
[1:09:31] have tons of churches even within
[1:09:33] Christianity that are waiting and
[1:09:36] singing about and preaching about the
[1:09:38] coming of the Lord but I want to just be
[1:09:40] real straight with you when it happened
[1:09:42] in the first Advent when the first
[1:09:44] coming came most of the church World
[1:09:47] missed it because they were looking for
[1:09:49] it to be a certain
[1:09:51] way and God went around all all the
[1:09:54] churches and he was born in a
[1:09:56] manger could it be it would happen again
[1:10:00] could it be that the second coming of
[1:10:02] the Lord would sneak up on us and we
[1:10:04] wouldn't recognize the second coming of
[1:10:07] the Lord and how he's going to do it I
[1:10:10] just leave that question with you I I
[1:10:12] asked you to pray about it and consider
[1:10:14] it because in in Mary's day there was a
[1:10:16] lot of churches that were singing about
[1:10:18] the Messiah coming and when he came they
[1:10:20] didn't necessarily reject the Messiah
[1:10:23] they rejected the way that he
[1:10:25] came can I say that again could it
[1:10:28] happen again they didn't reject the
[1:10:30] Messiah they rejected the way that he
[1:10:33] came and so you got churches singing
[1:10:35] about it and then you have those who are
[1:10:37] being as the Holy Ghost comes down to
[1:10:40] that age and that time and everything
[1:10:43] becomes kind of uh I wouldn't say
[1:10:45] jittery but there's a there's a good
[1:10:47] nervousness in the air because God's
[1:10:49] ready to do something really big so he
[1:10:51] comes down and there were those that
[1:10:53] that God they had the Holy Ghost come to
[1:10:56] them and tell them that that he was
[1:10:59] coming or that he was there the
[1:11:02] Shepherds got a visitation from the
[1:11:04] angel Joseph got a visitation from the
[1:11:08] angel Zacharias got a visitation and
[1:11:11] incidentally from the same angel that
[1:11:13] went to Mary went to
[1:11:15] Zacharias they got visitations because
[1:11:18] the angel of the Lord Gabriel was
[1:11:19] present something was going to happen
[1:11:22] and I'm just bringing this Point again
[1:11:24] that when the Holy Ghost comes down he
[1:11:26] can do a lot of things he can anoint a
[1:11:28] lot of people he can do Mighty things
[1:11:31] but I want to tell you the reason he was
[1:11:33] there is to begin a new creation in a
[1:11:36] young girl and if the Holy Spirit shows
[1:11:39] up it's not just there to show off it's
[1:11:41] to fill you with the Holy Ghost can you
[1:11:44] say Amen if it's that way in the first
[1:11:47] coming where people would get as
[1:11:49] Zacharias has an angel come to him hey
[1:11:51] if we look at an angel of God is an
[1:11:53] angel messenger than we a lot of people
[1:11:55] know the angel messenger a lot of people
[1:11:57] know the prophet of this hour and a lot
[1:11:59] of people are affected by it but I can
[1:12:01] tell you there's only one little bride
[1:12:03] amongst all of this that's receiving the
[1:12:06] genuine word
[1:12:07] birth it's not because you go to all the
[1:12:09] camp meetings that you have the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:12:13] go to someone because you want to go the
[1:12:14] word get the word of God and hear the
[1:12:16] word of God but just because you attend
[1:12:18] doesn't give you the Holy Ghost when God
[1:12:21] comes and begins to move then his
[1:12:23] intention is he he draws aside the angel
[1:12:26] meets with this one Angel and everybody
[1:12:28] knows so many know about the angel the
[1:12:30] messenger for the age I can tell you
[1:12:32] about the messenger for this age but do
[1:12:34] you know I was reading the scripture
[1:12:36] today I might speak on this another in
[1:12:38] another part of this I was reading this
[1:12:40] scripture about John the Baptist and it
[1:12:44] basically says I'm trying to remember
[1:12:46] the exact words now but it says John
[1:12:49] says I'm here to baptize you unto
[1:12:52] repentance
[1:12:54] but he that cometh after
[1:12:57] me praise the
[1:12:59] Lord after the messenger who has the
[1:13:03] spirit of Elijah there's somebody coming
[1:13:06] after
[1:13:08] him he said I'm just here to lead you to
[1:13:11] repentance I'm just here to of a baptism
[1:13:13] repent but when he comes after me he'll
[1:13:16] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:13:20] fire so that tells me that just because
[1:13:23] you're in the message and just because
[1:13:25] you recognize the messenger doesn't mean
[1:13:28] you come to the one who was coming after
[1:13:30] the messenger to baptize you with Holy
[1:13:33] Ghost and
[1:13:35] Fire I'm here to bring repentance Elijah
[1:13:38] was always there to bring repentance
[1:13:40] first time to the children of Israel
[1:13:41] second time to John the Baptist I'm
[1:13:43] baptizing you under repentance can you
[1:13:45] say
[1:13:46] Amen uh uh Elisha excuse me the second
[1:13:49] was Elisha then John the Baptist then he
[1:13:52] uses it in the prophet and the last days
[1:13:53] the spirit of Elijah comes Malachi 45
[1:13:55] and 6 and then he uses it again to the
[1:13:57] Jews but it's always preaching bringing
[1:14:00] the people into a certain way and to a
[1:14:02] certain altar this is the way you come
[1:14:04] and it's it's there's a lot of there's a
[1:14:05] lot of call for repentance there's a lot
[1:14:08] of call for you're living wrong you're
[1:14:10] you're dressing wrong you're not doing
[1:14:11] right here it's a c but the prophet
[1:14:14] doesn't give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:15] believing the prophet isn't necessarily
[1:14:18] guaranteed he said he that comes after
[1:14:20] me will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:23] in fire you got to go deeper can you say
[1:14:26] Amen praise the Lord so uh Mary now I
[1:14:32] was just trying to bring this down there
[1:14:34] was churches there were people receiving
[1:14:36] the Holy Ghost uh if you got your Bible
[1:14:39] open to Luke 1 verse 41 it says and it
[1:14:43] came to pass that when Elizabeth heard
[1:14:45] the salutation of Mary The Babe leaped
[1:14:48] in her womb and Elizabeth was filled
[1:14:51] with the Holy
[1:14:52] Ghost Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost now not on her soul because
[1:14:56] Calvary hadn't come yet but she was
[1:14:59] feeling the effects of the Holy Ghost go
[1:15:02] over to me to verse 67 with me to verse
[1:15:05] 67 and his father Zacharias was filled
[1:15:08] with the Holy Ghost and prophesied
[1:15:10] saying goes into the prophecy of zachar
[1:15:12] he was filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:15] prophesy did he did he have the same
[1:15:18] thing thing happen in him as Mary no but
[1:15:21] the same Holy Ghost was there to do that
[1:15:23] to Mary was the same Holy Ghost who was
[1:15:25] making somebody
[1:15:27] prophesy because why CU he's come down
[1:15:30] for the first coming he's come down this
[1:15:32] new creation he's affecting other
[1:15:35] people they're catching it amen so so uh
[1:15:41] if you would chapter 2 and verse 25 says
[1:15:45] about Simeon I love it and behold there
[1:15:46] was a man in Jerusalem whose name was
[1:15:48] Simeon and the same man was just and
[1:15:50] devout waiting for the consolation of
[1:15:52] Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[1:15:55] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[1:15:57] holy ghost that he should not see death
[1:16:00] before he see the Lord's Christ it's the
[1:16:02] same time as as the Virgin Mary has the
[1:16:05] conception of God in her and here's a a
[1:16:07] Godly Man called Simeon and he gets a
[1:16:10] revelation of the Holy Ghost that he
[1:16:12] wouldn't die until he sees the Lord's
[1:16:16] Christ the Holy Ghost can do other
[1:16:18] things and speak to other people and
[1:16:21] still fulfill his complete purpose
[1:16:24] and he
[1:16:25] came and he came by the spirit into the
[1:16:28] temple and when the parents brought in
[1:16:29] their child Jesus to do for you know the
[1:16:31] story he holds the child and Simon Says
[1:16:34] blessed them verse 34 and said unto
[1:16:37] Mary's mother behold this child is set
[1:16:38] for the fall and Rising again of many in
[1:16:40] Israel and for a sign which shall be
[1:16:42] spoken against y a sword shall pierce
[1:16:44] through thy own soul that the thoughts
[1:16:46] of many hearts may be revealed and then
[1:16:49] the next scriptures is Anna who was also
[1:16:52] got to to see the word in its infancy
[1:16:55] they were they were old uh uh Simeon was
[1:16:58] old so he said Lord I Thank you that
[1:17:01] you've let me see and you fulfilled what
[1:17:03] you said that I can see the Messiah in
[1:17:05] its emphases the word in its infancy we
[1:17:08] have sever brothers and sisters that are
[1:17:11] passing away that helped launch this
[1:17:13] message and take it to the world and
[1:17:15] many are passing away now they seen the
[1:17:18] word in its
[1:17:21] infancy but there's some sitting here
[1:17:23] that's going to see it in its
[1:17:25] completion Holy Ghost is doing all this
[1:17:27] there's other places but I want you to
[1:17:30] see there he is he's working so much so
[1:17:33] that these people were filled the Bible
[1:17:35] said filled with the Holy Ghost notice
[1:17:39] not in their soul but on their Spirit
[1:17:40] the Holy Ghost can give such a strong
[1:17:42] baptism on a person's Spirit they can
[1:17:45] prophesy could not come into the soul
[1:17:47] yet until Jesus took his blood to
[1:17:49] provide for our sins our nature could
[1:17:52] not be changed until cleansing blood
[1:17:53] revers sin and wash that serpent nature
[1:17:56] out we've been preaching on that there's
[1:17:58] no way they had the Holy Ghost like to
[1:18:01] receive in the upper room but the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost was there doing a work nonetheless
[1:18:07] and now Mary has a visitation from the
[1:18:11] angel the same angel that met with the
[1:18:13] other ones but the angel came with Mary
[1:18:16] with a with a a deeper
[1:18:19] word you're not just going to see the
[1:18:22] word as a baby in its infancy you're
[1:18:25] going to become the
[1:18:27] word they felt it it filled them in
[1:18:30] their Spirit but what happened to Mary
[1:18:33] was deeper I'm going to read a quote and
[1:18:35] I'm going to close but I can't help but
[1:18:37] think today my spirit just being a
[1:18:38] little troubled today and I've I've uh
[1:18:41] labored through this tonight because a
[1:18:42] lot of things are on my mind but could
[1:18:44] it be that even in the whole ranks of
[1:18:48] all that goes on in Christendom and even
[1:18:52] sometimes in in our own ranks around the
[1:18:54] world so many things can be done good
[1:18:58] and bad but we want to just look at the
[1:19:00] good done by the Holy Ghost poured out
[1:19:04] upon his
[1:19:05] people but could it be that there'll be
[1:19:08] a small number of Marys that really
[1:19:11] receive the true thing that this
[1:19:13] creation could be born in
[1:19:17] her quote says in Mary's belief he
[1:19:21] preached this three times in his
[1:19:22] wonderful
[1:19:23] message she looked at him the angel and
[1:19:25] he said Hail Mary blessed art thou among
[1:19:29] women thou art highly favored of God for
[1:19:32] God is with thee and he told what was
[1:19:34] going to happen that she was going to
[1:19:36] Bear a child and they should call his
[1:19:37] name Jesus for he shall save his people
[1:19:40] from their sins now she had a right to
[1:19:42] know that that was the kind she had a
[1:19:45] right to know that that was the kind the
[1:19:48] kind of a messenger first thing he was
[1:19:51] an angel standing there the next thing
[1:19:54] he told her who she was Mary she know
[1:19:57] that was a sign of God down through the
[1:19:59] age she looked him him and she said how
[1:20:02] can these things be seeing that I don't
[1:20:04] know a man and he said the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] shall come upon thee before Miracles can
[1:20:10] take place the Holy Ghost has to come
[1:20:12] that's what's the matter with the world
[1:20:14] today they're denying the power of the
[1:20:16] Holy Ghost that's why people can't
[1:20:18] believe in Divine Healing they're
[1:20:19] denying the very holy spirit that brings
[1:20:22] Divine Healing the Holy Ghost shall come
[1:20:24] upon thee and the most high shall
[1:20:26] overshadow thee and that Holy thing
[1:20:28] which will be born of thee shall be
[1:20:30] called The Son of God that's how he's
[1:20:33] coming you don't need to know no man
[1:20:36] God's going to do this and now he's
[1:20:38] referring to the second coming now for
[1:20:40] with God I believe it's for both comings
[1:20:43] he's talking to Mary here and then he
[1:20:44] says for with God nothing is impossible
[1:20:47] oh what that little lady had to believe
[1:20:49] she had to believe something that was
[1:20:51] impossible she had to believe something
[1:20:53] that had never
[1:20:54] happened Hannah when she was told by the
[1:20:57] priest the Lord give thee thy desire why
[1:21:00] she went home in nine months she brought
[1:21:02] the child that was wonderful but see and
[1:21:05] so Elizabeth and he said the cousin
[1:21:07] Elizabeth which was called Baron is
[1:21:09] already six months to be mother and told
[1:21:12] her that with told her that with God
[1:21:14] nothing was impossible and she said
[1:21:15] behold the handmade of the Lord Mary
[1:21:18] said this be it unto me according to Thy
[1:21:21] word what she had to believe something
[1:21:24] had never happened Zacharias the priest
[1:21:27] the husband of her cousin he doubted
[1:21:30] that same
[1:21:32] Angel just stop right there the same
[1:21:36] Angel come and told Zacharias what was
[1:21:38] going to go on with him to have a child
[1:21:40] and he said he doubted
[1:21:44] it blind God blinded his
[1:21:47] eyes this is the same Angel same Angel
[1:21:50] visiting other people but then the the
[1:21:52] angel comes to Mary he got the right
[1:21:55] response be it done if Zacharias would
[1:21:58] have said all right be it unto me
[1:21:59] according to thy but his first response
[1:22:01] wasn't that and so we find that he would
[1:22:03] go home and live with his wife Elizabeth
[1:22:05] and she'd bring a son and he said I'm
[1:22:07] too old it can't be done oh he just
[1:22:09] doubted it and he had Abraham and Sarah
[1:22:11] to look at he had Hannah in the temple
[1:22:13] and Eli her husband to think of but that
[1:22:16] callous priest doubted God's word he's
[1:22:18] referring to Abraham and Sarah go back
[1:22:20] he's referring to Abraham and Sarah he's
[1:22:22] referring to Hannah in the Old Testament
[1:22:24] Zachariah should have known that in the
[1:22:26] Bible people were Barren and God
[1:22:29] supernaturally opened up the
[1:22:32] womb of all people Zacharias the priest
[1:22:35] should have known that but when it come
[1:22:37] to him he doubted it and that was the
[1:22:40] same angel that was meeting with
[1:22:42] Mary so we really learned something
[1:22:44] Zacharias the priest and so the thing of
[1:22:46] but that callous priest doubted God's
[1:22:48] word next one sorry but a brother shiran
[1:22:50] said the other day over in the island
[1:22:51] when I saw my mother-in-law die five
[1:22:54] days before it happened and my
[1:22:55] brother-in-law have a hemorrhage and
[1:22:56] spit blood out of his mouth just spurted
[1:22:58] it from his mouth brother uh sonore said
[1:23:01] let us go in and pray that this won't
[1:23:03] happen and I said I won't do one bit of
[1:23:05] good God has already said it it's got to
[1:23:07] happen God when he says anything it's
[1:23:10] impossible for for it not to happen
[1:23:13] therefore When God says in the book all
[1:23:16] things are possible to them that believe
[1:23:18] it's got to happen no how many believe
[1:23:21] this these things
[1:23:23] don't let your mind fig just he just
[1:23:25] wants us to be like Mary you try to
[1:23:27] figure out why why he's saying all
[1:23:29] things are possible then that believe
[1:23:31] When God says that then we believe it
[1:23:33] that's our job to believe
[1:23:34] it we trying no way to explain it you
[1:23:37] can believe God will perform every
[1:23:39] promise that he made then when she never
[1:23:41] waited little Mary didn't now she had to
[1:23:43] believe something that had never
[1:23:45] happened but look at her little childish
[1:23:47] heart I'm going to think of her just to
[1:23:48] be a young woman maybe about 18 20 years
[1:23:51] old she never taken the second thought
[1:23:53] as soon as she seen and know that was
[1:23:56] the angel of the Lord that know these
[1:23:58] things and told her exactly according to
[1:24:00] the scripture she had been thinking on
[1:24:02] and told her her name and she know that
[1:24:04] messenger come from God the first thing
[1:24:07] Mary recognized this messenger has come
[1:24:10] from
[1:24:11] God pretty
[1:24:13] important the messenger has come from
[1:24:15] God next one and the scripture said that
[1:24:18] she had been thinking on what confirmed
[1:24:20] right there to her Mary the Holy Ghost
[1:24:22] will come upon you and the almighty
[1:24:24] shall overshadow thee and that Holy
[1:24:26] thing that'll be born will not be of man
[1:24:28] but he will be called The Son of God she
[1:24:30] threw her little hands up and the tears
[1:24:33] running down those beautiful eyes see
[1:24:35] she was emotional what happened in the
[1:24:37] inside she couldn't see but she was
[1:24:40] emotional tears running out of those
[1:24:42] beautiful eyes said behold the man
[1:24:43] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[1:24:46] according to Thy
[1:24:49] word she didn't wait till she was
[1:24:52] positive of of this she didn't wait till
[1:24:54] she felt life or some kind of a
[1:24:57] sensation to prove that was she was to
[1:25:00] be a mother I've always loved these
[1:25:02] points I've preached them for years out
[1:25:03] of this message especially to young
[1:25:05] people I have a little message I preach

[1:25:09] why little Bethlehem why was it
[1:25:11] Shepherds and I preached why little Mary
[1:25:14] of all people but I like this quote out
[1:25:17] of it right here she didn't wait till

[1:25:22] until she felt life or some kind of
[1:25:24] sensation to prove that she was to be a
[1:25:26] mother she just took his word and that
[1:25:29] was enough that's what God wants you to
[1:25:32] do tonight not wait till you feel better
[1:25:35] not wait till you can move your hand
[1:25:36] better or walk a good step not wait till

[1:25:42] believe
[1:25:43] it that's the only place way to please
[1:25:46] him take his word that's the way
[1:25:47] Miracles are performed when God is took
[1:25:49] by his word The Impossibles Are Made
[1:25:51] Real when when God has took as at his
[1:25:53] word not questioned just get that out of
[1:25:56] your mind behold the Hing of the Lord

[1:26:19] do necessarily and then that's a
[1:26:21] confirmation somehow that that no no she
