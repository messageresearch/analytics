[0:53] and god said give her whatever she wants
[0:55] right hallelujah
[0:58] so god's going to do his part you just
[0:59] do your part
[1:01] amen romans chapter 10
[1:04] let's start reading it um
[1:05] verse 8
[1:08] the bible says but what saith it the
[1:11] word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and
[1:14] in thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:17] which we preach
[1:18] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:21] mouth the lord jesus and shall believe
[1:25] in thine heart
[1:26] that god hath raised him from the dead
[1:29] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[1:32] man believeth unto righteousness and
[1:35] with the mouth confession
[1:37] is made unto salvation
[1:40] amen let's go to um hebrews chapter four
[1:45] hebrews
[1:46] chapter four
[1:54] hebrews 4 and um let's start at verse
[1:56] 14.
[2:00] hebrews 4 and
[2:02] 14.
[2:04] the bible says seeing then that we have
[2:06] a great high priest that has passed
[2:09] into the heavens jesus the son of god
[2:12] let us hold fast our profession
[2:16] for we have not in high priests which
[2:19] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[2:22] our infirmity but was in all points
[2:25] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[2:30] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[2:32] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[2:36] and find grace to help in the time of
[2:39] need amen the lord and bless me of his
[2:41] word you can have your seats
[2:45] praise god
[2:47] is this my water
[2:48] praise god
[2:51] if it's not i don't believe brother
[2:52] jason will kill me
[2:56] tonight by god's grace i want to use for
[2:59] a subject honest confession
[3:02] honest confession amen
[3:06] you know it's it's too often
[3:08] when we hear about confession
[3:11] the devil
[3:12] he wants us to draw up
[3:14] he wants us to pull back
[3:16] and not confess that in which we have
[3:19] need of
[3:20] but uh i don't necessarily want to
[3:23] talk about
[3:24] confession as a weakness
[3:27] but i want to talk about confession as a
[3:29] power amen
[3:30] confession as a weapon amen you know
[3:33] before i go forward let me read you
[3:34] something the prophet of god said he
[3:37] said only by your confession
[3:39] can you be saved amen
[3:42] so for you to get anything from god you
[3:44] must confess that he is lord
[3:47] if you need healing you must confess him
[3:49] to be a healer if you need deliverance
[3:52] you must confess him as a deliverer if
[3:55] you need joy you have to confess him as
[3:58] a joy-giver amen so your confession is
[4:01] very powerful tonight
[4:03] but let's let's finish he says
[4:05] he says only by your confession can you
[4:08] be saved
[4:09] that's the most powerful weapon that god
[4:12] put in the hand of me
[4:15] hallelujah
[4:17] so i want to tell you young people
[4:18] tonight the most powerful weapon you got
[4:21] one of them tonight is your confession
[4:24] and the scripture says that if you
[4:26] confess the lord jesus christ as your
[4:29] savior you shall be saved
[4:32] hallelujah so our confession brings
[4:35] christ on the scene
[4:37] and you know the prophet god said god
[4:39] can't do nothing for you except first
[4:42] you confess it
[4:44] but let's let's take it a step further
[4:46] hallelujah you know he says
[4:49] it's the powerful weapon that god put in
[4:51] the hand of man
[4:52] is a confession it's a communal and a
[4:56] confession
[4:58] holy communal means to commit it to god
[5:02] and you may say brother jesus i'm
[5:03] struggling with this i'm struggling with
[5:05] that confess it and commit it to god
[5:09] those are the two powerful weapons that
[5:12] god has put in the hands of the belief
[5:14] but your confession must be honest
[5:21] you can't just be going through the
[5:22] motions hallelujah for the church people
[5:26] you can't just be going through the
[5:27] motions to get mom and daddy off your
[5:29] back it has to be something honest
[5:33] you have to sincerely say god i need
[5:35] your help
[5:37] lord i can't do this without you not
[5:39] just saying lord i'm sorry but
[5:41] hallelujah say i'm sorry and change your
[5:44] ways
[5:45] that's what a real confession is
[5:48] confession means hallelujah to say the
[5:50] same thing that god has already said
[5:53] about you
[5:55] so as you confess let's think about what
[5:57] god has already said over you
[6:00] holly he said that you're healed and not
[6:03] sick
[6:04] he's saying you're the head and not the
[6:06] tail
[6:07] well let's let's let me give you another
[6:09] one that god said he said i call the
[6:12] young people because they are strong
[6:19] this is how god thinks about you
[6:21] this is his confession harley
[6:24] but let's read a little bit honey
[6:27] you know the greatest thing with with us
[6:30] and
[6:31] uh us as young people and people in
[6:33] general
[6:35] when we think of confession we think
[6:37] about what we're hiding
[6:39] you know and i can't let nobody know
[6:41] this
[6:42] and the more you think like that
[6:45] the more the enemy will have control
[6:47] over you
[6:49] but a real confession brings god nearer
[6:54] you look in the bible for anyone the
[6:56] bible says that god he he he dwells
[7:00] where there's a broken and contrite
[7:02] spirit
[7:03] hallelujah so god loves to comes around
[7:06] that person who's needy
[7:08] god loves to be in the midst of those
[7:11] people who can say father i need your
[7:14] help
[7:16] i can't do this on my own
[7:18] father i'm so sorry i've been a failure
[7:23] god loves those kind of confessions
[7:25] because they're honest
[7:27] and when they're honest what happens
[7:29] when your confession is honest then
[7:31] mercy comes
[7:33] [Applause]
[7:35] and i know we don't want judgment
[7:37] tonight we want mercy
[7:40] so i'm challenging you not to hold those
[7:42] things down in the depths of the hidden
[7:45] areas but confess them out and let god
[7:47] give you mercy
[7:51] hallelujah
[7:52] we don't want god's judgment
[7:55] hallelujah we want god's mercy
[7:59] so why not confess it and come clean
[8:02] remember hallelujah remember the woman
[8:04] that the prophet of god talked about
[8:07] she committed adultery
[8:09] and her mindset was i'mma take this to
[8:12] my grave
[8:16] and she was doing a pretty good job
[8:19] years and years and years have went by
[8:22] without her confessing it
[8:24] but then
[8:25] it got a span of time in her life when
[8:28] she started getting sick and she
[8:29] couldn't explain why
[8:31] she started getting very ill and very
[8:33] nervous
[8:34] and she didn't know why
[8:36] so there was a prophet on the scene
[8:39] so she said she had to get in his
[8:40] meetings and
[8:42] and see what's happening with her so she
[8:44] went to the province meetings and just
[8:46] to make a long story short when they
[8:49] when she had a interview with the
[8:50] prophet
[8:51] at his house he started seeing a vision
[8:55] of her in a car with a man who wasn't a
[8:57] husband because a man a husband was in
[9:00] the military going overseas
[9:02] he said i see you almost got hit by a
[9:05] car and see you almost got hit by a
[9:07] train and she fell out streaming and
[9:09] hollering
[9:14] and her next words to the prophet was
[9:17] nobody's supposed to know that
[9:21] but i'm telling you tonight whether you
[9:23] confess it or not god already knows
[9:26] [Applause]
[9:27] he's just trying to help you to obtain
[9:30] mercy
[9:31] hallelujah he already knows but if you
[9:34] want to keep that sickness inside of you
[9:36] if you want to keep that pain inside of
[9:38] you god will let you go ahead
[9:40] and this lady was on the brink of
[9:42] killing herself because she had a secret
[9:46] [Music]
[9:50] and this thing started taking over her
[9:51] being
[9:52] she couldn't sleep she couldn't eat
[9:54] she couldn't and this this is this is
[9:57] the crazy part she was a sunday school
[9:59] teacher
[10:01] she tried to bury she tried to bury her
[10:03] confession by doing some good in church
[10:11] you can't hide your realms from god by
[10:14] trying to be somebody in church
[10:17] you can't hide from god by trying to be
[10:20] faithful to service no god don't want
[10:22] your hands he wants your confession
[10:26] god wants your heart
[10:28] god wants your life
[10:34] so you know what
[10:36] she comes to the prophet and she says oh
[10:38] my god nobody's supposed to know that
[10:40] nobody's supposed to sin and she's
[10:42] streaming and hollering and all these
[10:44] things and midi comes in and she starts
[10:46] to tell me please don't let him tell
[10:48] nobody that please
[10:50] and brother branham's next response to
[10:52] her was well sister i can't do anything
[10:55] for you
[10:56] i've already showed you by the grace of
[10:58] god what the problem is now it's up to
[11:00] you to get it right
[11:02] and then she starts to sing but it'll
[11:04] mess up my home
[11:07] and that's what happens we hold things
[11:10] because we're afraid of our losing our
[11:12] social status
[11:15] we're afraid of how our friends gonna
[11:17] look at us if we really tell our friends
[11:19] you know what i really want the holy
[11:21] ghost
[11:23] i know we hanging out i know we doing
[11:26] our thing but this is not my destiny i
[11:28] really want to serve god
[11:30] i really want to be filled with his
[11:31] spirit i really want the anointing and
[11:33] the power of god in my life i don't want
[11:36] to be out there in the world too many of
[11:38] you are afraid of losing your facebook
[11:41] and ig and twitter status
[11:46] you're afraid of being looked at
[11:48] different on snapchat well let me tell
[11:50] you something if the holy ghost is not
[11:52] on you you're already being looked at
[11:54] differently
[11:59] hallelujah
[12:03] and what is it like anyway if god don't
[12:05] like it
[12:09] don't mean nothing
[12:11] he's gonna vanish away anyway
[12:14] so this is what happens church
[12:17] she holds it
[12:18] she's crying and she wants to walk out
[12:22] and god's mercy
[12:24] god's mercy put the prophet into another
[12:26] vision
[12:27] and he says your husband is this tall
[12:29] and this color hair he works for this
[12:31] company well he has the same thing to
[12:33] tell you
[12:36] hallelujah while you're thinking i don't
[12:39] need to let nobody know that i'm coming
[12:41] through this they might have the same
[12:43] problem
[12:44] they might be going through the same
[12:46] issues hallelujah none of us are exempt
[12:49] from trials and tribulation hallelujah i
[12:51] might be standing here preaching tonight
[12:53] but i have to go to god and say lord i
[12:55] need you
[12:57] i have to go to god and say lord i'm not
[13:00] able hallelujah
[13:01] father i don't know what to do i don't
[13:03] know what my next turn is how i don't
[13:05] know if i'm going back on the floor god
[13:07] i need your help
[13:12] hallelujah
[13:13] but what the enemy will do the enemy
[13:15] will say don't you do that you're going
[13:17] to look weak
[13:18] well let me look weak
[13:21] because in my weakness i'm made strong
[13:24] [Applause]
[13:27] hallelujah
[13:29] in church
[13:31] she walks out she leaves and she tries
[13:33] to make all these excuses why she
[13:36] shouldn't confess
[13:38] i'm a sunday school teacher and
[13:41] not first that she defends her husband
[13:43] and she says not my husband
[13:47] he's a deacon
[13:51] and this is the next thing that caught
[13:53] me
[13:54] the prophet of god says
[13:56] because of that sunday schools teacher
[13:58] unconfessed sins
[14:00] and that deacon
[14:01] on confessed sins he says
[14:04] no wonder brother johnson can't have no
[14:06] revival
[14:12] because you got
[14:13] things in the church
[14:15] that's holding back the anointing of god
[14:18] hallelujah
[14:19] you got unconfessed sins hallelujah in
[14:22] people's lives and they come in here and
[14:23] they smile like everything is all right
[14:26] and full of with trouble
[14:30] he says no wonder brother johnson can't
[14:32] have a revival
[14:34] in the in church
[14:36] she goes and she meets
[14:38] he says
[14:39] you could pull oil on her from the top
[14:42] to the bottom of the soles of her feet
[14:44] it won't help
[14:46] until
[14:47] she confesses it
[14:50] but look at how she tries to play a game
[14:52] with the prophet
[14:54] she says i've already confessed that
[14:58] she said i confess that to god
[15:02] and most of us
[15:04] most of us will try to play that same
[15:06] intellectual intellectual game with god
[15:10] she says i've already confessed that to
[15:12] god and the prophet zeroes in on he says
[15:15] you didn't do that to god
[15:18] he said you committed adultery on your
[15:20] husband you have to tell him what you
[15:24] did now that takes a little bit more
[15:27] courage
[15:29] because now she's about to step into
[15:31] something she can't control
[15:33] hallelujah and that's what the prophet
[15:35] was trying to get her with her hands
[15:38] hallelujah meant nothing
[15:41] her confession in her life is going to
[15:43] be have to put in god's hands
[15:45] so she comes and she she finally he says
[15:48] i can't help you i can't do nothing
[15:50] until you make it right
[15:51] and then she goes and she she finds her
[15:53] husband and she starts to tell him
[15:56] everything brother branham told her
[15:58] and then she says he says to her who
[16:00] you've been talking to
[16:05] god knows all about you
[16:10] he knows what make you tick
[16:12] he knows what makes you upset
[16:15] he knows what encourages you
[16:17] so why hold on to things that are no
[16:20] benefit
[16:22] and church from there
[16:24] he says well i'll tell you what honey
[16:27] let's just start fresh
[16:29] if you forgive me
[16:31] and i forgive you
[16:33] let's just go on with god
[16:35] and they repented to one another they
[16:37] confessed to one another then they came
[16:40] back to the prophet husband they
[16:42] listened to the prophet's terminology
[16:43] when they came back
[16:44] he said when they came back it was
[16:47] different
[16:48] he said when she came back in the room
[16:50] it was different hollywood and in
[16:52] another place he said now i can't
[16:55] control that devil
[17:00] whoa
[17:01] he said now i can control the devil why
[17:04] because now the devil has no rights
[17:07] he has no rights because their sins have
[17:09] been confessed
[17:11] and once you confess the devil can't
[17:13] hold you anymore he has no rights
[17:16] he has to be cast out then
[17:21] but as long as you holding on to it
[17:23] hallelujah think about it the oil the
[17:25] prayer and all these things can't budge
[17:28] him
[17:31] but once you confess it and make it
[17:32] right the mercy of god comes in
[17:35] hallelujah it casts that spirit away
[17:43] he says now i can control that devil
[17:45] he prays for
[17:47] she's delivered
[17:48] and then the grace of god
[17:51] they were looking to give up everything
[17:53] and he says no
[17:55] go back to your ministries
[17:59] just continue to serve god
[18:02] and you know what he was saying
[18:04] go and sin no more
[18:13] once you confess it ask god for strength
[18:16] not to do it anymore
[18:19] see that's the power of the blood
[18:23] when jesus came
[18:25] holy the acceptance of the blood of
[18:28] jesus takes the desire of sin away
[18:31] [Applause]
[18:32] that's why we confess jesus christ as
[18:36] our savior
[18:38] because the life the blood the gene and
[18:40] all the things you've been hearing this
[18:42] weekend about christ has the ability to
[18:45] change your desires by faith
[18:48] hallelujah when you accept the lord
[18:49] jesus christ by faith
[18:52] it takes away the old testament covenant
[18:56] and under this covenant hallelujah this
[18:59] life the life of christ it connects with
[19:01] your life and it gives you power over
[19:04] sin
[19:10] well you don't have to keep going back
[19:11] into that thing keep going back into it
[19:13] holly the confession of jesus christ
[19:16] hollywood has the ability to make you
[19:18] whole
[19:20] put romans 10 back up again for me
[19:23] romans 10
[19:24] verse 9.
[19:33] i ain't gonna be too much long y'all
[19:34] know i'm about to close
[19:38] listen
[19:39] and most of you have heard these
[19:41] scriptures before
[19:43] but let's take it to a different place
[19:46] he says
[19:47] that if thou shalt confess
[19:49] with thy mouth the lord jesus holly most
[19:53] of us have fulfilled that part
[19:55] we say i believe in god i believe in
[19:57] jesus can i get amen
[19:59] and if you have it i'm gonna show you
[20:01] tonight why you should
[20:04] hallelujah he says that you shall
[20:06] confess
[20:07] with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall
[20:11] believe in thine heart
[20:16] you see with your confession follow you
[20:19] it goes into two stages
[20:22] it comes out of your mouth
[20:24] but it has to become what you're
[20:26] confessing it has to become a life
[20:31] hallelujah
[20:33] he said and thou shalt believe in thy
[20:34] heart hath raised them from the dead
[20:37] thou shalt be saved
[20:39] so if you confess the lord jesus out of
[20:41] your mouth and you believe it in your
[20:44] heart then the life of christ takes over
[20:46] your being
[20:49] and the reason why we don't see a lot of
[20:51] young people living for god is because
[20:53] they don't believe it in a heart
[20:56] it came out of their mouth but they
[20:58] never stepped into a real surrender
[21:01] [Applause]
[21:03] hollywood a real surrender is when you
[21:06] say god i give you my life
[21:09] that's when you believe it from your
[21:10] heart
[21:11] when two people get married they give up
[21:14] their rights to live for the other
[21:15] person
[21:16] [Applause]
[21:21] jesus
[21:23] if we go back to hebrews 4 it says we
[21:25] have a high priest holy that can be
[21:27] touched by the feeling of our
[21:29] infirmities
[21:30] he knows what you're going through amen
[21:33] but you know we hear so much about other
[21:36] gods and all these other things why
[21:38] jesus
[21:40] why jesus
[21:42] why not lebron
[21:50] why not cardi
[21:52] why not taylor
[21:55] why not kim k
[21:57] you know these are the worldly gods
[22:00] but what makes their gods
[22:01] better than our god
[22:05] you have to be able to answer that
[22:06] question
[22:08] somebody asked my daughter

[23:59] unquenchable

[25:12] you know what that name does breaks
[25:14] every stronghold
[25:17] [Applause]
[25:21] whoa
[25:23] i just want to speak the name of jesus
[25:30] church
[25:31] look
[25:32] but you got to get there
[25:36] you can take it down let me read
[25:37] something to you
[25:40] listen young people i want you to catch
[25:43] this
[25:44] the prophet says
[25:46] this isn't a message come follow me
[25:48] he says you make yourself
[25:51] when you're young
[25:56] you make yourself when you're young
[25:59] got any young people in here
[26:06] he said you set
[26:07] your ambitions to what you want to do
[26:11] and what you're trying
[26:14] to achieve in life
[26:16] you think of it
[26:18] and as you think of course
[26:20] your mind
[26:21] it is presented into your mind by an
[26:25] unknown something
[26:26] that dominates your mind
[26:30] so the things you think on on a regular
[26:32] basis it begins to turn you into your
[26:34] thoughts
[26:36] and that thing begins to dominate your
[26:38] thinking
[26:39] holy and the scripture says as a man
[26:42] thinketh in his heart so is he honey so
[26:45] why not consecrate your mind to the
[26:48] things of god
[26:50] why not consecrate your person to the
[26:53] thing of god
[26:54] because once hallelujah it gets into the
[26:56] womb of your mind it will begin to
[26:59] dominate you
[27:02] so why not let the word of god get in
[27:04] there
[27:05] and the word of god will begin to
[27:07] dominate you and you'll become what the
[27:09] very thing that you're hearing
[27:11] [Applause]
[27:14] you become the very thing you're
[27:16] listening to
[27:17] you make yourself when you are young
[27:24] don't y'all know
[27:27] catholics start at about five years old
[27:31] five to four years old they get them so
[27:32] young and indoctrinate them
[27:35] and it's so hard to get them away from
[27:37] that why because it becomes a part of
[27:40] the thinking
[27:41] hallelujah
[27:43] and once it gets to be a part of that
[27:44] person it's hard to turn them away from
[27:47] me totally
[27:50] let's keep reading
[27:55] hallelujah
[28:01] he says and then
[28:03] when it becomes in your mind
[28:06] then you speak it
[28:08] that you're going to do it
[28:11] and then your ambitions drive you to do
[28:14] it hallelujah
[28:16] whether you believe it or not
[28:18] if you haven't given your life to christ
[28:21] there's something driving you
[28:26] and if you have given your life to
[28:28] christ
[28:28] there's something driving you
[28:32] hallelujah so you can't get away from
[28:34] being driven
[28:36] you're either going to be driven by the
[28:38] spirit of god
[28:39] or the spirit of wrong
[28:41] hallelujah there is no middle ground
[28:45] my brother jason was talking i think he
[28:46] was talking about a peacock and a black
[28:48] white bird you could dress that bird up
[28:50] all you want is still going to be a
[28:52] black bird
[28:53] holly and you can come here and you can
[28:56] sing songs and
[28:58] and build a choir and all these things
[29:00] but if your heart ain't in it you're
[29:02] just entertaining yourself
[29:05] [Music]
[29:10] and i can tell when some of you your
[29:12] hearts ain't in it
[29:14] amen
[29:15] because we're singing songs about the
[29:16] power of god
[29:19] and y'all up here like that
[29:25] and we hear the verse and say your name
[29:27] is power
[29:34] so you don't understand your situation
[29:37] you don't realize hallelujah what it
[29:40] means to be in bondage
[29:43] once you ever get out of bondage
[29:46] hallelujah and you begin to say that his
[29:48] name is power hallelujah
[29:51] you knew that it was something that came
[29:52] in and took over that situation you knew
[29:55] it was something that wow
[29:58] you know it was something greater hungry
[30:00] that came than what you was going
[30:02] through
[30:05] church when you get to that spot young
[30:07] people when you get to that spot
[30:09] when christ begins to make himself known
[30:12] to you
[30:13] honey nobody can take that away from you
[30:22] but let's make it very plain very simple
[30:26] if you're not filled with the holy
[30:27] spirit
[30:29] just ask yourself what
[30:32] why why why why why not we have enough
[30:35] word coming forward
[30:38] we have a true anointing in the church
[30:41] hallelujah we're singing songs of zion
[30:43] amen we're preaching thus say of the
[30:45] lord amen god comes and visits the
[30:48] church and people are healed and we see
[30:51] the dynamics all these things so why
[30:53] don't you feel
[31:00] i'm gonna tell you why
[31:05] the prophet made it very plain very
[31:07] simple
[31:08] he said
[31:11] and the only thing
[31:14] that kept me from being saved when i was
[31:16] 12 years old
[31:20] you mean god can touch you at the age of
[31:22] 12.
[31:25] god can visit you at a young tender age
[31:29] before you become a teenager
[31:31] [Applause]
[31:34] god can get a hold of you and give you a
[31:36] true confession
[31:38] holy a true walk with god he said the
[31:41] only thing that stopped me at the age of
[31:43] 12.
[31:45] about short hands how many of you older
[31:47] than 12.
[31:50] i ain't gonna mess with you don't be
[31:52] afraid
[31:58] and even before 12
[32:01] god can touch you
[32:04] but listen what he says
[32:06] he says the only thing that kept me from
[32:08] being saved when i was 12 years old
[32:12] because a spirit hung over me
[32:18] so if you haven't received christ
[32:20] in the magnitude of changing your life
[32:23] with the expression of the holy ghost
[32:25] it's because there's a spirit hanging
[32:28] over you
[32:31] and i know some of you parents i think
[32:33] little brother that's just too harsh
[32:36] don't be so harsh
[32:40] you keep on babying that spirit and that
[32:42] spirit gonna stand up in your face one
[32:44] day
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:47] that spirit gonna tell you one day i
[32:48] don't want to go to church
[32:52] that spirit go start talking about the
[32:53] pastor and dare you to say anything back
[32:57] that spirit gonna start saying all kind
[32:58] of stuff because you're babying it
[33:01] that's why god told saul saul go down
[33:04] there kill all the amla kites he said
[33:06] kill everything kill mother sucking baby
[33:09] goat dog kill everything she mama daddy
[33:12] kill it all
[33:15] you say brothers that's kind of rough
[33:16] kill a baby kill it
[33:19] kill it in baby stage why because when
[33:21] it grows up it's going to be an
[33:23] amalekite
[33:25] [Applause]
[33:32] and you need the holy ghost
[33:34] you know why because without the holy
[33:36] ghost you got traits of your family tree
[33:39] in you
[33:44] and you become what the generations
[33:46] before you were without the holy ghost
[33:49] but with the holy ghost it by the
[33:51] generations of the third and fourth
[33:53] generation
[33:58] the holy ghost hallelujah stops the
[34:00] spirit of alcoholism from getting on
[34:03] that sun that was on that father
[34:09] hallelujah
[34:10] the holy ghost stops the promiscuous
[34:13] spirit that was on their mother trying
[34:15] to get on that daughter
[34:22] hallelujah
[34:24] because the holy ghost is life
[34:28] he says the only thing that kept me from
[34:29] being saved when i was 12 years old
[34:32] because a spirit hung over me
[34:34] and then he makes a real plane
[34:36] a devil
[34:39] oh you thought we was gonna sugarcoat it
[34:41] tonight
[34:42] no if you ain't got the holy ghost you
[34:44] got a devil
[34:46] [Applause]
[34:53] yeah you don't want to make eye contact
[34:56] that's all right
[35:02] see it's too often
[35:04] we try to pacify things that need to be
[35:07] dealt with
[35:10] let me tell you young people something
[35:12] there's no reason why you shouldn't have
[35:14] a victorious life
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:18] there's no reason
[35:20] hallelujah because god has sent a
[35:22] vindicated word
[35:24] he's given it to vindicated men
[35:26] hallelujah and the expression of god is
[35:29] being preached hallelujah and all you
[35:31] got to do is open your spirit and
[35:32] receive
[35:34] all you got to do is receive holy now i

[36:04] but first things first you must
[36:06] acknowledge him holiday

[36:12] hallelujah
[36:14] he says the devil he said listen what
[36:16] this devil is saying he said the devil
[36:18] saying wait a little while longer
[36:24] and some of you been waiting a long time
[36:27] but let me ask you something in your
[36:28] waiting has life gotten better
[36:34] it hasn't gotten any better so what are
[36:36] you waiting on
[36:39] hallelujah
[36:41] he says it was a devil saying wait a
[36:43] little while longer that spirit hung
[36:45] over him hallelujah and he says that's
[36:47] the reason you wasn't saved when you
[36:50] become the age of accountability he said
[36:53] a spirit you got in the crowd
[36:59] you got in a crowd what kind of crowd a
[37:01] crowd of a bunch of other unsaved people
[37:08] and you know those spirits they call for
[37:10] help hallelujah those spirits will
[37:12] reason those spirits are talking to each
[37:15] other these those spirits are saying but
[37:17] you ain't got to do all that
[37:24] and you young people are fighting things
[37:26] and i'll be honest you young people are
[37:27] fighting things that we didn't have to
[37:29] fight
[37:30] holy
[37:32] but we still got the same god

[37:46] shunned away from it a lot because we
[37:48] couldn't just walk around

[38:02] right nowadays

[38:20] those are evil spirits
[38:22] hallelujah god created adam and eve not

[38:30] but i'll tell you
[38:32] how perverted that spirit is it starts
[38:34] with a confession
[38:37] and now you got these crazy parents who
[38:39] when they have children they'll say well

[39:18] guarantee you
[39:19] if me and victoria stand in the mirror
[39:21] together victoria will say i'm a lady
[39:26] cause i sure don't look like this guy
[39:31] and i guarantee you she has no desire to
[39:34] look like me
[39:37] it's just that simple but if an evil
[39:40] spirit perverse mine what that thing
[39:42] teller well you look better as a man
[39:44] lying devil
[39:45] [Applause]
[39:51] lying devil
[39:52] [Applause]
[39:55] one time i was preaching a young lady
[39:57] came in the prayer line
[39:59] and she said brother dicks
[40:02] the devil is telling me i'm a lesbian
[40:06] and this is how he talks to you and gets
[40:08] in your head
[40:10] he says
[40:11] he says to her that i'm a lesbian i said
[40:12] well why why do you why are you
[40:14] believing that
[40:16] she said because
[40:17] every young man that i wanted to court
[40:20] or marry
[40:22] they ended up
[40:23] getting involved or marrying somebody
[40:25] else
[40:27] and then
[40:28] my girlfriends were always there to
[40:30] comfort me
[40:32] they were always there to hold my hand
[40:34] and
[40:35] lift me up and care for me
[40:39] so i believe i'm a lesbian because my
[40:42] friends are always there to love on me
[40:44] i say no sister
[40:46] satan's lying to you
[40:48] i said that's what good friends are
[40:50] supposed to do
[40:53] good friends are supposed to be there in
[40:55] your time of trouble hallelujah but
[40:58] don't pervert the love
[41:00] hallelujah
[41:02] don't let the devil avert the lord
[41:04] hallelujah
[41:05] is friendship godly friendship is a love
[41:08] of innocence not perversion
[41:12] julia and your girlfriends are there to
[41:15] love on you with an innocent godly love
[41:18] not a perverted sexual love
[41:24] hallelujah
[41:25] and we ended the conversation like this
[41:27] i said well let me ask you a question do
[41:29] you still desire to have a husband she
[41:31] says yes i say any discussion
[41:36] let's say because you still got a desire
[41:38] to be married to a man what satan is
[41:40] doing he's lying to you
[41:43] hallelujah
[41:45] amen because that desire shows what's
[41:48] going on in the inside
[41:50] hallelujah and the prophet of god said
[41:52] hallelujah the deep color to the deep
[41:54] hallelujah so if you're a desire to
[41:57] marry a man there has to be a man out
[41:59] there for you somewhere
[42:05] and you hold on until you meet him and
[42:07] say i do
[42:15] and i think just uh
[42:17] i don't say that
[42:21] the craziest thing is watching two men
[42:23] holding hands walking down to why they
[42:25] love each other
[42:27] what a perversion
[42:30] you know why it's a perversion
[42:32] because those two men could never have a
[42:34] child without a woman
[42:44] you know why we're addressing us
[42:46] because the spirit is in the room
[42:49] and satan's been trying to tell some of
[42:50] you young people sway to the left
[42:53] no
[42:54] stay the course
[42:58] look in that mirror if you see a woman
[43:00] that's what you are
[43:02] look in that mirror you see a man that's
[43:04] what you are holiday and don't believe
[43:06] anything else
[43:09] hallelujah you say all brothers in my
[43:11] heart i think this and the bible says
[43:14] don't touch your heart
[43:16] [Applause]
[43:19] the only time you can trust it is when
[43:21] it's filled with the holy ghost because
[43:23] death is not your heart it's the heart
[43:25] of god
[43:27] and until you're filled with the spirit
[43:29] you cast down vain imagination
[43:31] [Applause]
[43:35] hallelujah
[43:38] look i know a young lady who backslid on
[43:40] the lord when she turned 18 why is 18
[43:43] such a magic age
[43:46] for girls who have been who've been
[43:48] running the course they've been serving
[43:50] god and then when things don't go that
[43:51] way when they turn 18 they get a spirit
[43:54] on them say they feel sexy
[43:56] and i'm feeling i'm gonna leave this
[43:59] church because i'm ready

[46:02] you parents stop pushing these kids to
[46:04] get married and you know they're not
[46:05] ready
[46:08] you know your child not ready
[46:10] you know she won't be a good wife you

[46:15] push him to get married and he mess up
[46:17] somebody's life
[46:25] you want to protect that child just like
[46:28] you want your child protect
[46:30] [Applause]
[46:33] exactly
[46:35] he said there's not a man that's got his
[46:38] right mind
[46:39] but what wants to do right can i get
[46:41] amen
[46:43] and i believe
[46:44] everybody in here wants to do right
[46:47] but because there's a law inside of you
[46:50] when you want to do right you do what
[46:54] that's why we need god
[47:01] don't get nervous i'm coming down
[47:05] he said but there's something
[47:08] he said but there is something won't let
[47:10] you do right
[47:11] is that right he says the congregation
[47:13] says amen he said that's the devil
[47:17] hallelujah christ paid for your healing
[47:20] and your salvation amen
[47:23] so if you ask yourself tonight brother
[47:25] these why i keep going back to this
[47:27] thing it's a spirit
[47:29] and you got to confess that spirit unto
[47:32] god and let god take it away from you
[47:35] amen see once you confess it amen it
[47:38] gives god the power hallelujah to come
[47:41] and take that thing out of your life
[47:43] because you're telling god lord i give
[47:45] this to you
[47:47] and i i tell you right now church
[47:49] hallelujah there's not anything that
[47:51] i've ever given to god that god hasn't
[47:53] taken over
[48:00] but what we do too often we'll ask god
[48:03] about something and we already have our
[48:05] answer like balaam
[48:10] we already know what we want god to say
[48:13] so we're not really asking god we're
[48:16] just going through the motions
[48:18] don't go through the motions tonight
[48:20] tonight is the night for a real
[48:23] deliverance
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:30] church before i close
[48:34] remember
[48:35] i don't think we was talking about this
[48:38] remember when david committed adultery
[48:40] with bathsheba
[48:42] he was wrong as two left shoes
[48:46] but you know what
[48:47] he did that
[48:49] with the heart of god
[48:56] god that didn't change god said david
[48:58] was the man of the god's very own heart
[49:01] but he got caught up with his own human
[49:04] desires
[49:06] hallelujah
[49:07] and him and bathsheba did something they
[49:09] weren't supposed to do and david holy
[49:12] the king david the man after god's own
[49:15] heart hallelujah premeditated murder
[49:18] fornication
[49:20] holy he lied adultery all these things
[49:23] were happening from a man after god's
[49:26] very own heart
[49:30] but god so rich is mercy
[49:36] church there's always a bigger picture
[49:39] church and you look what david did there
[49:42] was no excuses he was supposed to die
[49:46] he meant babysitter was supposed to die
[49:49] but this is what i like about it when
[49:51] nathan the prophet go back and read it
[49:53] secret samuel harley when
[49:56] uh chapter
[49:57] when when samuel when nathan when nathan
[50:00] came to david he began to tell david a a
[50:04] parable
[50:05] and he said david it was a man you know
[50:07] and i'm gonna just hit the high notes
[50:08] there's a one man who had one sheep this
[50:10] other man had so many more he had
[50:12] hundreds of people having the number is
[50:14] he said this man that had one
[50:16] this man that had so many went and
[50:18] tucked a man who had one
[50:22] and david looking at that thing
[50:24] you know how you can see somebody else
[50:26] wrong but you can't see yours
[50:29] you know you young people do you judge
[50:31] each other in the crowd
[50:33] she had boyfriends and she didn't need
[50:35] all this
[50:37] she just nasty
[50:43] and you can quickly judge her for all
[50:45] the mistakes she's made but if you could
[50:47] see her mistakes and you don't want to
[50:49] be like that her life is grace to you
[50:57] you won't look at it like that but
[50:59] because you can see all her faults and
[51:01] not want to fall into the same channel
[51:03] her life becomes the grace of god
[51:09] when we want to step back and condemn
[51:11] that person for everything they're doing
[51:13] and if god allows you to see it and not
[51:16] want to be that that's god's grace
[51:22] in church
[51:24] when you think about
[51:26] what the lord has done and what he's
[51:28] doing and
[51:29] and and and and just the grace of god
[51:32] you you see david all the stuff david
[51:34] did
[51:35] and then
[51:36] god comes
[51:37] through nathan giving everybody all
[51:39] right
[51:40] gives him the parable
[51:42] of the of the two men that have one had
[51:44] much and one had little and by the time
[51:46] he finished telling david about himself
[51:49] david didn't know he was talking about
[51:50] him
[51:51] david was ready to
[51:53] jump all over him
[51:55] because it felt like his sins were
[51:57] exposed
[52:00] and y'all know how we do
[52:02] especially young people you feel like oh
[52:05] we all know what you did
[52:08] you need the holy ghost
[52:12] but your stuff is secret
[52:16] and you need the holy ghost
[52:19] hallelujah
[52:21] in church
[52:22] nathan comes and he says david this man
[52:24] took this other man
[52:26] and david after david heard the whole
[52:28] thing david said where is he i'mma kill
[52:30] him
[52:33] i'ma kill him i'm gonna destroy him
[52:35] and then nathan says david
[52:37] you're that man
[52:40] what does david do
[52:44] he doesn't try to justify his actions
[52:48] he doesn't say well i'm the king i can
[52:50] do whatever i want
[52:52] he doesn't try to say well about sheba
[52:54] she know i come out there every day and
[52:56] she just did that on purpose no
[52:59] david falls on his knees and repents
[53:03] he confesses his wrong david says first
[53:06] thing he says he says lord i have sinned
[53:11] and because he confessed it even though
[53:14] god already knew about it when he
[53:16] confessed it the mercy of god came next
[53:20] holy because he was supposed to die but
[53:23] sheba was supposed to die because there
[53:25] was no excuse for that amen oh yeah but
[53:29] because his confession was made right
[53:32] god gave him mercy
[53:35] and nathan said david thou shall not die
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] why
[53:42] because he made the right confession
[53:48] and young people
[53:52] everything about you is for purpose
[53:56] every mistake every wrong everything is
[53:58] a purpose
[53:59] and you look at what david david placebo
[54:02] we look at and we say man
[54:04] what an awful act
[54:06] god had to let it happen why
[54:08] that was the only way we can get psalms
[54:10] 51
[54:13] creating me a cleaner
[54:17] oh
[54:18] god
[54:20] and renewed my spirit within me
[54:24] [Music]
[54:26] that psalm came from what he did with
[54:28] bless you
[54:30] so god has a plan even when you look
[54:33] like you're messed up
[54:37] he just want you to make it right
[54:38] hallelujah
[54:42] but if we think about god our confession
[54:45] unto him
[54:47] in my closing i want you to see
[54:50] that god will never ask us to do
[54:51] anything that he hasn't already done
[54:56] young people adults saints i want y'all
[54:58] to know
[54:59] there's no other confession greater than
