========================================

virtuous woman her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life it's like a long-term relationship to me it's not an overnight thing but all the days of her life she would do him good sure a different message the world gives us she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship she bringeth her food from afar she rises also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household in a portion to her maidens she considereth the field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hand she planteth a vineyard she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land she maketh find linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant str excuse me strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness so it's not just what this woman does but it's what she is it's what her character is what comes out of her mouth as well her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household i don't know if you noticed it but two or three times her household has mentioned her husband is mentioned i'm going to speak this morning on a woman's place and this scripture is giving the woman's place and if you look at it carnally like the world does it it can be viewed very different by the world but this is expressing something much much greater than the world could ever interpret this is the blessed honored place that god gave a woman and it's related to her household it's related to her household verse 27 she looketh well to the ways of her household and edith not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her maybe i should just take a text on that scripture to the brothers he praiseth her for all these things be next sunday many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates amen what a beautiful i don't think that was just some poem i think i think solomon was under a great inspiration of god to say it just that way now here in uh first peter chapter 3 before your seed in first peter chapter 3. another section of scripture is that i feel like in the old testament expresses the place of a woman of god likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives and conversation there is not her words it's her manner of life now if i read the first line of this verse to worldly people and sometimes people who haven't even found their place if i read that first slide wives be sub in subjection to your own husbands if i stop there you'll never see the picture you'll never see her place if you just read that you say well her place is just under subjection to her husband you didn't finish the verse i want you to notice the power that comes when a woman finds her place they miss the scripture like they miss a lot of scriptures they don't read the rest they don't seek out what god's trying to say you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the manner of life of these wives in their place did anybody consider how much power is behind the woman being in place that even if the word is not there somebody can be one without the word why is that because she is the expression of the word the bride is the expression of the word and people can be one they may not hear it through her lips but her manner of life has the possibility to win someone who doesn't believe i'll tell you friends that's pretty powerful that's a pretty powerful place that goes on to say while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear it's just respect who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating of the hair and of course for a woman's vessel it has to talk a little bit about what she wears because her vessel is different than the man's brother brown says somebody asked him i read it last night i said why are you always talking about the women's dress and never the men's well he said i have to talk about men sometimes when they have long hair or do this but he said most mostly it's because a woman is a different vessel and different body than the man the man naughty knees he's the ugliest thing he said there ain't nothing appealing about him whatsoever smells most the time but a woman's body is different and usually when he talks about the woman there's something in relation to what she wears that's god's heart can you say amen whose adorning let it not be that adorning outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on it of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a make and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price for after this matter in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husband even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement if you're in this manner of life and in this place and you do well with it and you're not afraid with any amazement being caught up with hysterical fears that's what that means not afraid with any amazing being caught up with hysterical fears if you're consistent to stay in this then you're you're acting out the daughters of sarah and the daughters of god can you say amen likewise ye husbands now why would it turn to the husbands because it's not just the wife that should reverence this position the husbands must reverence it too he's got to get his act together and he's got to see this position and place god gave her as well if he don't he's going to have trouble if you know if you see your woman as just another woman this any other woman and if you dabble and look at another woman you'll see your wife you'll disrespect her just like the world does because you're looking at the wrong thing so he addresses the husband you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as under the weaker vessel and as yet being heirs together of the grace of life so yes truly physically she's the weaker vessel but don't forget she's co-heirs with you of grace can you say amen there's a position that she's with you if you're alone that is a different story but the two of you together you're co-heirs together that's quite a good position of the grace of life and then he says if you don't honor this this way buddy your prayers you're in trouble with god you get in trouble with god if you don't see this place of a woman and honor it properly can you say man all right you can sit down i was preaching already i have to stand the whole service you know it's a good time this morning to take a moment and do as the scripture says as they shall be praised it's a good time to take a moment and praise the women who fear the lord the bible said she will be praised she should be praised and her husband should praise her the bible says as well but a husband won't do it unless he really sees and a lot of times this takes place over time some brothers catch it early on but you you learn it over time you begin to see this depth of this position that's when i want to speak on a woman's place and a lot of you know that i could finish that a woman's place is a woman's place is in the and you know those quotes very well a woman's place is in the and i'll read those things to you today but sometimes you make that place just that it's just about just as long as she's there in the kitchen in the home she's in her place this this meaning to a woman's place goes far deeper than her washing dishes in the kitchen hello maybe you don't know yet but i'm going to preach it to you this morning so i just want to say a woman's place i don't want to say a woman's place is here because i want to take it a bit deeper and when the other husband understands that he understands and he will praise her and over time many people learn more and more what this is and they learn to appreciate it more this glorious place and when she is in it the power that goes with it now i just wanted to say a comment about solomon's statement that says her value is far above rubies can you say amen so don't try to measure this woman of god don't try to measure her by any worldly terms or by any treasure this value of a godly woman don't don't don't compare it with any worldly terms or treasure of this godly woman who serve their husbands and serve their household and serve their children with the fear of the lord there is no price that can be put on that it is above rubies that's what the scripture says her value sisters godly sisters whoever you are around the world the bible says your value is above rubies above rubies and she is never to be looked at as just the same as any other woman she is far from any other woman can you say amen if you go to salary.com they've established a a salary for a mom of the stuff that she does in comparison they've been doing this for years and i looked up a recent not a recent one but two years ago they've probably added to it but when they take it the comparables of all that a woman does they come up with about a 95-hour week it's okay sisters it's okay to say amen today he says you're so quiet this is the service you're really saying man maybe go a little nudged to your husband it's okay you have permission but they set a salary based on all the comparables of what she's doing for a 95-hour week and they come up with a salary every year of a hundred and sixty four thousand dollar annual salary for what a mom and a woman does laurie come on now i'm getting some response 160 on salary.com that's what they establish the salary as what you're worth every week sis i can't get some of you to smile at all lighten up a bit 164 brothers i guess your puny little flowers today from kroger don't seem like very much the girls should be making 164 000 a year and i know some of the scissors they're thinking yeah pay up here let's just bring it on give me 80 of it for what she does for how she works for most of the time you don't see it that's done but i want to say sis god sees it and there are rewards beyond imagination for sisters particularly in the last days who find their place and work in that with an attitude of grace and a spirit of rejoicing this is what i do there are rewards on the other side that blow our mind that will blow our minds for the sisters that are sitting here today and around the world in this generation who express the wonderfulness of of a godly woman there's rewards for you sister you may not get the 164 000 here but you're going to get a lot more than that someday praise the lord so you know if we respect you know you brothers and your kroger flowers i'd say if you got her the flowers and got her a nice meal today if there's respect and love and value for you that goes with those flowers then she'd probably enjoy the flowers it's not just about the card or the flowers it's about do you see her place now sisters don't demand that they see your place just let god speak through me and maybe they'll catch it this morning a woman's place some think sometimes a woman places in the kitchen the carnal mind looks at it and says you know even the worst carnal mind you're a cult if you say a woman's place is in the kitchen a woman's place is in the home a woman's place there you're just cult and you're following a cult leader they they take that carnal view of it and you're they say you're putting woman in bondage and the reason is they see it that we have no revelation of the bible or the scriptures they have no revelation of the depth of a woman's place and the power that goes with it no revelation to all that conclusion and sometimes even our own ranks they don't have a revelation of what what a how glo bless a sister told me how you guys don't mind us sister brittany told me the other day and her husband brother joseph coming from van work i hope you guys don't mind me saying that i already said your name so it's too late they made a decision a few weeks ago to bring her home and always used to the two salaries to bring her home to be with the kids when they're little and they're doing extra things to be able to meet up the thing together to sell things to be able to meet that salary together i i'm all over that when somebody says it to praise it must be praised because those are rare decisions today but i said sis and i said to the brothers and says god you will not know till someday the trickle-down effect of that one decision sacrifice financially do everything you can and you do it but he said you may not see the results now but i'm telling you someday you'll see a huge trickle-down effect from that mom being with those kids see you see around here you're going to get all the worldly views of thing and sometimes in the church you get worldly views in the church but this boy this pastor is when he sees it i'm all over it it's going to be praised decisions like that are going to be praised and that's not to be little as i said i'm respectful to every woman that has to work many of them have to do that it's completely fine i just know when someone makes a decision like that i say god bless them for it that's great if they can do it especially for the children's sake can you say amen let me clarify something else i mean i'm feeling pretty good so i must go for i'm already in trouble with some people but listen hey it's not the message of christ that has belittled and disrespected women if women are in the place they're at today it's not because of people that's saying it's the message that puts people women in bondage it's not the message of christ that has done that it's the world that's disrespected women it's the world that's dirtied women it's the world that's got women out of their place can you say amen women are completely lost today and they've lost their place for for many years now in the world they don't know who they are anymore and it's not because of the bible or the message it's because the world has taught them a different thing and got them out of their place i should get greater amens than that because that's exactly the truth women have been brought to the lowest place by the fashions of this world by the movies of this world by the lust of men by the mixed messages of what's pretty women have been deteriorated in their place they don't even know who they are anymore but it's not the message that has brought the women under bondage it's actually the message of christ that's brought us back to that beautiful glorious place of a woman again you dare let the devil or anybody online tell you any different the message of christ has come to restore the dignity of true womanhood even all the talks about in the preaching about dress it's all for a purpose can you say amen women are looked at wrong and they're viewed wrong because the world has dirtied and disrespected women they can't even look at them right anymore and you brothers you you men that look at pornography or you're you're bound by that and you listen you can never look at your wife correctly if you're looking at that stuff and you'll start putting her down i heard that the other day they're putting people down and they laugh at her i've seen that in men they put her down put their wife down laugh at her and the reason you become disrespectful is because you're feeding on what the world feeds on and it and every time that will belittle a godly woman and you'll have a sarcastic view towards a woman's place in the bible it's what it does it's a spirit you never look at your mom right you'll never look at your wife right as long as you dabble in that you need an altar you need to be sanctified and you young girls listen to me you better know that a young man has been completely delivered of that before you entertain marriage with a young man because he will not respect you i don't care how much he would love you now he will not respect you as the woman of god that you want to be and you want to be looked at right it'll never happen if he hasn't overcome that thing in his life it's okay i'm compared with no amens i'm prepared for it i may ask for him but listen you young girls better pray hard can you say man that that man is a sanctified holy ghost-filled man and these things have been resolved in our life because the disrespect and sarcasm and spirit that is that is in his life will be carried into the marriage you want him to be find his place as a godly man as you're trying to find your place as a godly woman and that would be a honorable marriage if both knew that praise the lord brother bryan says it's just a shame that the enemy has taken our american women and stripped them down as a quote the first quote that i have there guys it's just a shame that the enemy has taken our american women stripped them down out here on the streets it's a disgrace no wonder little boys and little girls and things are in such a shape as they are today they're always trying to pattern after some woman out here in hollywood married four or five times and she'll come out with some sort of a nude clothes on and all the little girls in the country will pattern after that what a pity that's too bad yes sir it's too bad and it's got into the church the beautiful virtue that god give a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation how many knows that brother brown says womanhood and motherhood is the backbone of a nation you break motherhood and you've broke the nation right then that's one thing that helps hold it together real genuine parenthood and i was talking to the cab driver coming down he was talking about some delinquent children up there and he said i think it's parents and i said amen fell i don't know who you are but you're on the right road and later on he says long ago too long ago has this long ago too long ago has the beautiful virtue of women and their fine dress has bowed before the shrine of the goddess of hollywood it's the truth it's such a pity that the world has gotten a place like that nation's backbone is broken sex appeal is many times regarded as fashion it's the statement brother brain brandon makes over and over again sex even in the church sex appeal is okay to appeal someone sexually is okay and sex appeal is considered fashion modern people dressing going out on the street you know what the bible says so true womanhood and true motherhood is the backbone of our nation it's the backbone of our church can you say amen and i just say to you a woman's place how powerful is this place when the women find their place the message did not come to put women let me correct this too while i'm on a roll the message did not come to put put women in their place but it came to show them in the bible their true place of value and virtue see you have to correct these things because the devil's lies the message did not come to put the women in place it came to show you your wonderful place marriage and divorce you know after marriage divorce i see he comes through talking about if a woman gets out of order and from the fall from eve all the way through brother bram just elaborates it and just goes on and on and on and he comes to a couple spots in mary's divorce and he says here also later in recognizing your day you know the bible said that those who escape out of this great damnation will be a beautiful branch for before the lord someday i'll get to it the lord willing for for you women let you see what god thinks of a woman that really escapes the damnation of this day he said she would be beautiful i heard a woman the other day laughing a girl a bunch of half-naked females with morals lower than a mother dog laughing at an old woman with a long dress listening here you twist listen here you twist it up female she's got something you know nothing about she's got moral you don't even know what the name is you lost it in the cradle almost you don't even know right from wrong she does she's got something hid in her heart that you don't know nothing about you think i'm a hard preacher you lost it can never find it you don't don't call her old-fashioned and so forth like that she knows something you don't know nothing about she's got hid in her heart the treasure of decency you don't know one word of it and then later on he says i'm talking of the immoral now not you sisters we'll give you your place right here so now in marriage and divorce after he covers the bad woman he keeps dropping as he just said he says someday he said i'd like to take this and teach this because he had to talk so much about the women of the world being out of place he said someday sisters i'd like to take time and show you your place in the scripture and in marriage and divorce he says it twice he says i'm talking now of the immoral now not you sisters we'll give you your place right place in a few minutes in the word of god here later in marriage and divorce he says now can you see why i have said the things that i've done and the things the things that i've done in other words he's saying for years he's what they call harped on the women he said now you see in marriage and divorce you see the things that i've done knowing that this was in my heart brothers and sisters i know sisters you got your place just in a moment and the wonderful character that god can mold in you but i'm just trying to speak on the other side to show what you're actually from in the beginning but he says you have your place i i believe he didn't really have the time after elaborating so much in marriage divorce he didn't have the time in that message to get to the full uh the full thing of it he did in later sermons and he says enough about it and she points us to the place the true place he had to talk a lot about a woman being out of place but he he got to it in several services and what he didn't get to there's enough in there that us ministers can preach it to you in 2021. so it must be deeper than just a quote a woman's places in the kitchen or woman's places in the home and if you're looking at first peter again if you pull that up first peter chapter three again this is a pretty powerful place to be in when she's in that place that her testimony and her manner of life could actually win somebody who's not obeying the word and won't listen to somebody speaking the word there's such a place of power in this that her life may god help me to show you in the next few minutes now what the place of the woman is what the place it's not just that she's in the kitchen and she's at the home there's a reason why it's home centered there's reasons for that but the deeper part of it is that when she is in this place she is expressing something she's expressing something and it's hidden within her the hidden man of the heart and all of these expressions in first peter chapter three she has the hidden men of the heart there's there's a mystery behind her there's something in here the world knows nothing about and when he says the meek and the humble quiet meek is humble and that quiet spirit listen a lot of times that's interpreted wrong too that she never says nothing and her personality is squelched when it says a meek and quiet spirit it says just that it's not so much she's quiet with her words but a meek and quiet spirit it says i i know where i'm going with this don't be nervous if it means just that she shuts up and never says nothing then then sarah doesn't fit in that in the bible can you say it zipporah doesn't fit in that if meek and quiet meant she never said nothing and that's really godly if she's just just completely silent on every she never says nothing she's such a godly woman she never says nothing it's not what it means if that's the case the poor don't fit because moses and all this great ministry forgot to circumcise his own child and so poor had a little temper she said to her husband thou art a bloody husband to me you forgot that all your ministry and going down to pharaoh you forgot to circumcise your own son brother braham said she had a temper and moses had one too and he says it must not have been so pleasant on the backside of the desert when both of their tempers got going at the same time that's his own words but quiet doesn't mean that she was so poor wasn't quiet sarah wasn't quiet sarah got involved with their husband so this meek and quiet and being a daughter of sarah must not mean you're completely silent which many of the messages have interpreted this for years the wrong way i don't mind saying it can you say amen and some of you brothers are not married to quiet wives no i'm not going to ask for a show of hands no better than that you have expressive wives i have one we had a minister in here oh man almost 30 years ago for a dedication of a little building he was from trinidad and the whole weekend he stayed at our house nobody else was around me and my wife and she just talked and talked and talked and my wife loves to talk about the word and his brother was in the word so i'm sitting there on the couch and she's doing most of talking and if you know my wife she always feel bad about it afterwards so she come the last she said i apologize but she i just got excited about the word and i've talked way too much and i probably shouldn't oh he said that's fine sister that's fine that just shows you're free and your husband lets you be free yeah i didn't marry her to change her personality i married her so meek and quiet i believe humility is a part of it i don't think you should be all showy and about yourself humility is a part of it but this quiet thing has to mean something different and i think it's just a secret mystery behind her that is that there's this there's this quietness if i can explain it right is that she of course she doesn't handle the word of god in front of the pulpit she can't do that but that that's part of it but there's this mystery behind her that she's she's hidden behind the mystery of her husband and as it says in the beginning the woman's place is that she shall be a help meet for him so now a woman loses her own not her personality but she loses and becomes lost into the vision and the identity of this man so much she becomes hidden in that so she don't want to speak for the man or speak something outside of that vision in the world of the man so that's where she becomes quiet in the sense that she you see this woman is that she's so much a part of her husband that she don't want to speak something other or or different or belittle him or anything like that it's a different meaning than just being silent does everybody understand so look it up and study it some more because you want to understand it right it's this this meek and quiet spirit and sarah was behind the tent of course and we know she laughed but she was behind there and he tells her to bring the meal out and so we know that happened but there was she the thought is is she is connected with abraham she shall be a help meet for him in other words she's a she's a helper suitable for his vision and if she has a bit of an agenda or an agenda but a vision of her own that will always fit with that man's vision it's not like this i'm going off and i'm doing my own thing and my own career and my own deal and he hasn't signed off on it and it jeopardizes many things she can't do her work it gets a little iffy doing that you understand what i'm saying is that what she does and who she is and all that is within this this world of being a helpmate to him now you can't get around scripture now don't buck up against it the original purpose of eve was that she be a helpmate a help meet which means a helper suitable for him and his vision doesn't mean you don't have a vision doesn't mean you don't have creativity but it's it's god blesses it when it when it's in this vision of this man or their father right till she's married it's like she's not all just doing her but no she's staying within that protection of her father and that counsel of her father and if she don't have a father then she's staying within some council somewhere to get advice to stay within the world of having a good leadership so she's not tempted or false how many knows that after the fall everything changed and they were co-equal before that they're still co-equal and the coirs together and grace is still that way and calvary's restored things but after the fall god put her under the rulership of a husband because of the protection because of her vessel because of the fall then he says i've got to give her a place he didn't have to give her a place but he gave her a place he put her under this protection rulership of the husband for her protection and that's happened since the fall how many understands that so it was a different covenant for the woman after the fall happened but god did it for protection god did it to take this vessel and put a protection around it of her husband's headship so that she wouldn't fall into these traps again anytime a woman starts to live her life without the right type of headship she can get in trouble in a lot of ways anytime a man gets out of the headship of the holy ghost he can get in trouble in a lot of ways we are all called to be under headship the headship of the lord jesus christ and we step out of that we're getting a very dangerous spot i think we get back up here because i i got a lot to finish and my ipad has got six percent left forgot to charge it if you guys one of you guys want to work on getting me plugged in here i i'm sorry for doing that i don't know if somebody has that plug me up is this okay today is it okay with everybody can i leave my church over it so now i've already commented on some of this in first peter so i'm just going to move on the husbands need to see that it's her place in the fear of the lord if you dishonest or dishonor her you get in trouble with god she's coheirs together with you of the grace of life it's all about this place it's focused on the right thing god wants her focused on and when a woman is focused on the right thing in her place focus on the right thing she needs to be focused on when we say a woman's place is in the home it's so much deeper than that and you know i when i think of that i think of my mom that's sitting here today which i'm very grateful to still have her and every day to be able to be with her and talk to her but if we were to say a woman's place is in the home well my mom that doesn't mean just being in your home because my mom for a lot of years didn't have a home and we lived in motels most of my young years so home must be something more in fact two years we didn't even have a home dad put damn dad he put everything in storage wanted to go on the road full-time evangelism and for two or three years we mom didn't even have a home now that's something for a woman right not a lot of you women can do that but my mom was built for it because when god calls a man he calls his wife with him can i get a bigger amen when god calls a man what he calls him to he calls the wife with him to help him in that and so mom you know she's in she's one of the first homeschoolers in this nation or in the world she was the first homeschooler i believe in this entire world she was doing it before any of the schools she homeschooled us in the back of a van in the in the motel room everything is you know everywhere she's somehow you know what i know how to count today and i know a little bit about math and things because she kept it going dad didn't keep it going dad had his calling and stuff but but that's the place you see she gave attention to the children this is important we need to educate them this is important we need to feed them because she fed me too much we need to teach them to sing we need to do this so there's something about that that the dads can't provide she's built special to say okay if this is your calling and mom was right all over it daddy's going to travel the country got invitations everywhere i'm going i go we we may not have a home for a while but i feel called to go and evangelize around this nation that's what i did as a kid but she was called to make that work she could i'm good with it i'm going with it this is your vision i'm making it happen and i'm gonna make it run as smooth as i can i'm gonna cook in motels we had a little cooker there and we didn't have money sometimes needed a restaurant if we did have money it was five dollars at mcdonald's and we could feed the entire family big for five bucks can't do that today but she's cooking a lot of the motels and bringing the pots and pans in and just doing all this stuff when i think mom i love you today i appreciate it but it's not just about having home it's can i say it this way she is home it's not about her places in the home she becomes home she makes it a home that's a woman's place and a lot of situations she makes at home wherever they're at whatever they can do if it's a mansion or if it's a little a two-bit house with nothing there with with an outhouse for a bathroom that wife will say listen i hope things get better someday i hope you get a better job someday but there's something in here that reaches out we're going to make this work no matter what we have to do god bless you women who find that place with your husband yeah just doing it doing whatever i'm going dead whatever and it was here and there and everywhere i think we moved 30 times by the time i was 20 years old 30 times that's why i've been in one place this area for 33 years now because i don't like moving she was called to it you know a woman doesn't do something unless she's called to it and she's in the world of her husband this is it we go with it god bless you mom thank you for your years of labor she's a woman who found her place and did god bless it god blessed it tremendously all of her children serving the lord can you say man some of your children aren't serving the lord but i'm believing with you that they're going to come because if you bore that image in front of them that image in their minds and hearts they may not admit it will be more powerful someday than any damage they've been through or whatever's happened that image lays there you can't get rid of it and has the power to save they better never darken the door of a church or read their bible but that bible says by her manner of life he can be one she can be one without the word how powerful is that i think of my wife i was thinking about this two days ago as the lord just gave me this i didn't know what to preach i thought what's a woman's place what's the woman saying i was thinking my wife you know she made that adjustment i think she was 25 and i was 27 and she had already got a bachelor's degree and it was working at the hospital great job making good money i wasn't here i come along wanting to marry her and i don't know what i made i made almost nothing she so she's she's making this money she can go buy the dresses that she wants she can ride the car she had a red honda prelude sports car cool car that's some of the reason i married her i thought that's a cool car but cool woman here so she's got this car she's got all the money she needs you know i think she made it that time which was a lot 30 000 which is a lot back then she had so you know here she's going to accept me and you know you know the story she's sitting on her front porch looking at the smoky mountains in tennessee and crying saying lord you know i love this man if i'm willing to leave all of this to go to toledo ohio i was thinking about the other day because she called me when we were engaged and she had to switch i made her get okay i'll take the blame for this i made her get rid of the prelude because at that time i had the twisted view that a pastor probably shouldn't be riding around in a prelude i was so dumb james i was so dumb i would love to have that prelude today i would drive it in between all your cars and wouldn't care what you thought at all it's perfectly fine for a pastor to drive a red honda prelude it would have been worth something today and i made her get rid of it i said i don't think a pastor should drive that you should get something more conservative so she goes to the honda dealer she trades that in and she gets this car but she gets this it was a brand new accord four door court and she calls and she's crying she says she said i love this new car except that my prelude did a lot of things i was sitting in the car and the salesman said said she said how do i get the antenna up he says oh you got to go out and pull it up and you got to manually move your seats and you got all this stuff and she called me crying she said i love you but can i just look at something a little different than this and i said yes i understand the pain that you're going through right now we'll spend a little bit more and get it so the antenna can come up and so through the marriage now for 27 years we've been in this mode you know just happy wife happy life you know but you know why a husband can do it i just thought of that that she didn't have to call and necessarily ask but she had made the transition i'm in his world now what i do i'm not my own identity here now i'm i'm in his identity and what decisions i make affects us because we are one that's an engagement and i said just dropped to my heart said lord i'm going to preach on this a little bit because we've got examples hundreds of examples in this congregation of women women that are finding their place to not try to make decisions as just some career woman but in the world that is protected of this hobby so i'm sitting here without a hubby this morning and i'm working hard i got a scripture for you in a little bit just hang on you got time dude i gotta go back up and find out where i'm at petersburg michigan i know i know i'm in pittsburg michigan that's where i'm at right so i thank god for the godly woman i thank god for my wife it's been a wonderful marriage a wonderful year 27 years with her and a lot of it is you find your place in christ the man under the word under the headship and the woman finds her place the world doesn't know anything about this to this am i supposed to serve this person you go do your own dishes you go do you you see it just gets to be this carnal thing that's the place is not necessarily a geographical place but it's a position of power that god said if shall be in that i'll bless their family i bless their lives is this okay with everybody a woman is not the source of life for bearing children she's not the source of that life the man is the source i'm just i was going to do this this sunday again i'm just going to throw it out just send a message somebody get me a hook go ahead you can pick it up that's a visual so the whoever's in charge gets me a hook to put my jacket on we're not sending this video out at all it's on facebook no not this sunday a woman is not the source of life that comes from the man right uh jesus said i am the vine but you are the branches so she bears she bears where the life source comes from she's the expression of it so the woman is not a source of life and jesus made it clear you've got to abide in the vine if you don't abide in the vine you don't you don't have a source of life yourself how many raise your hand as christians you have no source of life yourself without christ you're finished so let's not get an attitude that the lord needs me the lord needs me that's not yet without the source of life you have nothing so it's just like a woman a woman can't have a baby on her own a woman can't have life come into her on her own she can't do that she has to be with a man but we must realize how important a woman's place because there is some elements to it that he may be the source of life but he can't have the baby so she is essential to bring forth what the life is i would never meet my children this morning solomon and getting i'd never be able to know them unless i had my wife they could be in me but i would never have the essential what i need to see that life come to the right betting ground so the woman so now the man's the source of life but the woman is the betting ground for life the woman is the nurturer of life and she has it in her belly she nurtures it the woman is the birther of life can you say amen and then after that the woman is the trainer brother bram says in her earlier she's training that child the woman is the creator of an atmosphere for that life everything that life is really comes to that woman she's she's not the source of life but she's everything about the environment that that life is nurtured in now we can type that with the bride of christ friends because god when god sends his word it's not just to say on books and tapes and computers and phones or in your bible it's to be expressed in the life of the bride and there's only one woman that can do that the bride of jesus christ this message is not books and tapes this message is not about william branham he was the source that life come through he was just the mouthpiece to bring the source of life but the bride the body is the betting ground and we will see the fruit of this message in the people's lives that's the way god set it up that's why she's a part of her husband that's why we're a part of christ there's such an important position when she finds her place because she's the betting ground she's the nurturer she's the atmosphere creator she's the theater of new life she feeds that baby she creates an atmosphere of that baby none of this is man's place it's her place is anybody catching what i'm preaching this morning that's not man's place that's the woman's place all of that it's hers he is the provider she is the producer and they both god says in the mystery they both they go together they must be together so she expresses her place in two ways the way she is with her husband and the way that she is with her children that's what it comes down to the way she is with her husband the way she is with the children sisters don't forget that if you don't know what this revelation is your place what's a woman's place your relation and me behavior and mannerisms in relation to your husband that's why brother brahm says this no one can ever fulfill the place to console a man no one will ever he says the greatest gift god gives man outside of salvation is a godly wife her price is above rubies and he says no one can console that man no one can comfort his heart no one can give him affirmation he can be successful in all of life but if he doesn't have his wife's admiration it really doesn't mean anything to her only she has that certain secret that affects the man sometimes she can affect him badly and he just got to go shh she doesn't find her place he goes [Music] because she's not treating him why she's not and he doesn't have affirmation you don't have the courage to go forward and do what he does the energy behind him my ministry up here the visible ministry in public most of success to it besides the lord is this woman right here because there's been corrections and then things and discussions and things if i'd have headed this certain direction see the thing about sarah is when she suggested abraham go with hagar which i'll talk about in a minute when he suggested she was she was dead wrong right but later on she was used of the lord tell abraham you've got to kick the bomb one and the sun out there's tension in the camp she was used of the lord and he needed to listen to her this is the paradox about women this is the paradox about women sometimes they can be dead on and sometimes through their emotion they're making emotion they can be dead off and when any of you brothers figure out a woman and figure without what i just said you can preach the next marriage retreat because in some ways you're still trying to figure it out but you can't just dump it off you don't have nothing to say god used sarah to speak to abraham god used my wife in many ways god used my mom still uses her and so you're going to but something can be said and it just balances things out can you say amen i know what it is today i have to get back up here and remember thanks for the plug brothers appreciate it i can preach another two hours now no one can produce or affect children or a man like her when she's in her place everybody says no man can console a man like a woman can no one can produce an atmosphere for christ like his bride can she knows the type of atmosphere he comes down in no one can produce the right atmosphere like the bride of christ can you have no life of your own a woman can't conceive a child without him but he can't produce one himself without her so sarah is so in abraham's world she calls him lord she's so and even that i don't believe is mechanical to start preaching a doctrine that all you sisters need to start calling your husband lord you're not going to do it anyway but once again look at the deeper meaning it's not technically about saying yes my lord yes my lord there's been a lot of pockets sometimes even in our own ranks that take the scripture that way and boy they are in order their their women are calling their husband lord yes my lord yes my lord it's deeper than that it's the respect it's the honor it's a reverence that he's he's the king and it's a reverence from him that she's the queen she's not the servant she's the queen it's a royal relationship co-heirs together so sarah is because sarah i'm going to take two women now and i'm going to try to draw this to a close sarah is blessed and protected under a power of god because she's in her place in abraham's world in abraham's vision she's in that place submissive to that place humbly quiet in that place she is in abraham's world and because she's part of abraham brother bram says because she's in his world and stays in that world remember lot's wife would not she wanted to go to sodom and all that she stays right there she could have said well i'm going to go with lot's wife i want to go down in the into no no no she's in abraham's world with the promise this is what god told me to do this is what's going to happen she stayed with it she didn't understand sometimes can you say matt she had uh a difficult time sometimes sarah made terrible mistakes laughing in her heart towards the lord but all let me just say this all of her mistakes and all of her imperfections got overrode because she was in her place can anybody see that all of her mistakes and all the things she said a place even in her heart i talked about two sundays ago she laughed in her heart she had a sarcasm in her heart about the promise but god couldn't kill her god couldn't disown her because she because why she was part of abraham's world and so her mistakes were overrode because she was part of abraham abraham could not produce the promise without her she was not perfect we go right to her poor decision when she suggested hagar but even that terrible look what it produced in ishmael terrible decision when she made her husband go be with hagar to try to produce a son terrible interrupting the promise i can preach a whole sermon on completely producing an ishmael a terrible decision but let me just let's just think about it this way why did she do it she was impatient for what the promise of god so when you when you step back and look at that as bad as a decision as she made it still came from a desire for the promised son you remember brother brahma said god looks at our desires can you say amen and that's why our mistakes we ask forgiveness they're overruled because he's looking at your desire and sarah's desire was so much to have their promises it's not coming abraham it's not coming i suggest you go with hagar maybe god meant it go and she's messing everything up but yet what's it come from a desire for the promise of god and god worked it out later can you say amen god brought the promised son she just couldn't wait so we can be very critical of women but you realize when she's in her place god had to override even that decision can you say gave ishmael a place the decision was wrong but why did he do it she was in her place with abraham and she desired the promise with her husband one more women in first samuel chapter 25 and verse 2. first samuel 25 and verse 2. so this is a woman that makes mistake what if a woman lives with a man who makes a bunch of mistakes what if a woman tell me about a woman who's a god a right woman but her husband is a jerk or a husband is a mess or he's disrespectful first samuel 25 2 what is there so what about a woman that's like that i'm glad you asked because i'm going to read it first samuel chapter 25 and verse 2 and there was a man in mohammed whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep and caramel now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil and he didn't have a chance to look up churlish but he was evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb and david heard now this is a guy within the within the group here of the children of israel david heard in the wilderness that native naval did shear his sheep david sent out ten young men and david sent it to the yemen gets you up so basically to make the long story short you know the story david says i'm gonna go in there and i'm gonna ask for some food for my man and i'm gonna do that when he gets in this nabel he says who is david who is david what is he disrespect for the man that's representing christ and this is the way he was abigail wasn't this way but her husband was so she's living with a man that's embarrassing her all the time i said abigail's living with a man that's embarrassing her all the time what he says he should have said that he should have done that he made that decision to he's he's messed up and she just keeps it quiet she probably covers for him sometimes she's he's always embarrassing her because he's just evil his evil doings constantly he's not a right man and i'm trying to make this story short but he says who is david who is david disrespect well when it got back david says we'll just get the army the other one and go take everything we're just going to go do it you know the story abigail hears they're coming going to destroy anything you know what abergo she's in the world of her husband you read the story i don't have time to read it she comes out representing to try to give get grace from david for her husband she's praying for her husband no doubt she's a godly woman and so here she's she's in the realm she's not saying just let david come serves them right she's with her husband and she's got to go out and deliver him in front of david and god blesses it she appeals to david david said i didn't realize what i was doing david backs off then she goes home she this guy doesn't even realize what i've done for him right now he's probably the same temper he had the same mess he's being complaining doing all this other stuff i've got to live with this man he don't realize i've just done it's like some sisters i've prayed for this man for years he doesn't realize how much i'm standing in the gap that god would change him and some men they still don't get it they don't see it they don't see what they've got as a godly woman and after a while it just it just it just gets to be too much i'm not i don't promote of course divorce it's against the word of god but first corinthians 7 bible says if she depart there are times when she departs if she departs let her not be married again or let her be reconciled if that little state slogan is there i don't believe in a man abusing a wife physically mentally for that many years i don't believe in a man doing that she does not have to stay with that type of thing but look how long abigail stayed look how long after these years of these evil doings and she represents him because she stayed serving her children serving her husband no matter how bad that he was being i'm not putting down any men here today i'm just saying they're sisters in those situations it's not an ideal situation and then you know the end of the story where he comes and she comes home and he i think he drinks all night or whatever you remember the story better than me and ends up i think having a heart attack and he dies so that ends it takes a long time sometimes it ends though finally it ends it ends in a tragic way but i'm looking at abigail saying sarah made her mistakes but abigail was fine her husband made a lot of mistakes but because she was in her place god still blessed her and after he was dead she remarried again guess who she married christ david was the type of christ so sister you might be lonely and you might have all these things that happen in your life but you know what spiritually you can be remarried again to the lord jesus christ he'll be your headship he'll be your guidance because god's blessing you because you did the right thing under the word of god can anybody hear what i'm saying today this place is a powerful place and whatever the situation if you're in your place god will move over time god will bless you for it oh my how long have i been nobody's saying yeah i got a watch right here i got four percent here okay ten to one wow i'm going a long time so exodus chapter one and verse 19 says verse 15. actually you know the story here where this is what brother brahm takes on teaching on moses he takes the story to the children about moses's parents and pharaoh kept putting pressure on the people seven and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and the wax is seating mighty and the land was filled with them and there arose a new king over egypt whose net knew not joseph and he said to the people behold the people the children of those who are more and mightier than we come on let us steal wisely with them lest they multiply and come to pass that when they're falling out many war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over the task masters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities uh pittham and ramses but the more they the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were and were grieved because of the children of israel and the egyptians made the children of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage and mortar and brick and in all manner of service in the field and all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor and the king of egypt spake unto the hebrew midwives of which the name of one was shafa in the name of pura and he said when when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill them but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said to him why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the midwives said this is the scripture i want to get and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women praise the lord that's a whole sermon right there pharaoh buddy you don't know something you are so dumb and he keeps putting pressure on the children of israel so to bring the numbers down and they keep multiplying they keep bringing more more children forth god was blessing them under trials now spiritually speaking we live in this day where egypt even sending women back to work brother brown referred to it in teaching of moses he says he said even pharaoh said we'll just put the women to work and that way they won't be home they can't have all these children and we just put the women to work he says that's what he's done today try to put the women to work it's all pharaoh it's all his pressure any of you sisters feel pressure today any of your brothers feel the pressure of this egypt around that's around us and yet under this because we're called of god like israel we just keep multiplying we keep growing spiritually i i love to see and i'm closing in a minute but i love to see under this age that is the worst age for disrespect to women everywhere we look every sunday i come in here and wednesday and i see you sisters i there's something that drops on my heart this is a miracle this is a this is a a a black eye in the eye of satan every time they walk in here godly dress godly spirit all their different personalities but such a reflection of a contrast of what this world matter of fact the world says you can't produce women like this and i say no no here they are here they are but he says we'll put them to work we'll do all this other stuff and they multiply the midwife says we're not going to do it but when pharaoh come and ask him he says you need to know something buddy you need to know something can i have that scripture again you need to know this principle the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively rigorous in our delivered air the midwives come into them they are so healthy it's naturally speaking they're so rigorous and so healthy they have their baby boys before we can even get to them that's what that scripture means pharaoh you messed with the wrong women you don't know what you're doing you think they're like the egyptian women and i want to say that to the devil you think these women are like other women if you husbands think you think that these women are not like other women these are not the egyptian women this is a different woman sitting here in online wherever you are this is different than the egyptian women and god will multiply you god will bless what you do at home god will give you great blessings in your life god will have a trickle down effect to the decisions you make that are the right decisions when you're in your place it can only be blessing can you say amen no matter what position you're in if you find your place in jesus christ and what god's called you to then you are different than the world and never be measured by the world and your price dear sisters is above rubies here this morning we love you we thank you and we thank god for the message of the hour that brought us back to the word that i can preach a sermon like this and encourage that's why at a wedding when someone stood there and they haven't a man and a girl a man and a a woman has kept themselves pure until that wedding day can you say amen if i know that i say praise the lord and i'm going to say to the whole world in that wedding let it be known with all the perversion and all the things that go on in the world here is a couple that stayed faithful until their wedding day it needs to be praised [Applause] because the world never praises the right thing and the world never praises you women for what you do and who you are but i'm going to let pharaoh know today you messing with the wrong women because this is not like the egyptian women these women are different they're rigorous they're strong and no matter how much pressure you put on them with all the responsibilities they're still going to rise they're still going to grow spiritually they're still going to draw closer to the lord can you say amen hallelujah [Applause] dragon snotty knows johnny and with them dragon susie with different colored socks getting them to church probably miss most the service because they're back in the nursery somewhere but they're there because they love the lord didn't catch drove two hours and didn't it wasn't able to catch hardly even any of it but you were there and god is going to bless you because of your position in your place hallelujah i've had a good time today i know i got it quick let's stand amen god bless you god bless you sisters happy mother's day to you and may the lord bless you richly and let's just sing that song beautiful brand to the lord again and we'll just have a word of prayer and close the service but god is good amen didn't expect this to come out this way today but i believe that i press it will be a blessing to you not only to the dear sisters but also to you men and young young men now you know what kind of girl to look for young guys and girls you know what kind of girl to be and to seek to be in the lord but you husbands taking knowledge of what i've preached to you today because as your revelation grows of her position in place you will honor her more and more and more can you say amen get her something nice today maybe besides those kroger flowers get her think about it a little deeper and get her something a little better than that i know you can't afford rubies but let's you know try to try to think about it just a little bit more than just what i'm going to do today which is sad it's just on the way to the restaurant you stop by kroger because i was so busy studying about women i woke up this morning and all my kids got cards from my wife and i realized i'm studying about women and i didn't even at least i'm honest about it beautiful branch of the lord [Music] women of god who the savior adores wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord [Music] beautiful branch of the lord despite this bride of christ who the savior adores wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful one more time listening oh beautiful branch of the lord this bride of christ this bride of christ who the savior adores the wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord praise the lord amen i want to be just like him in his image and find our place all of us men finding our place in christ finding our calling in life how many you young men raised god help me to see my calling in life how many young young man that's such a struggle to find help me to find my calling find what i'm supposed to do that will help to bring a wife along and help if you know your place and position you settle down in that i trust the lord will give that to you according to the desires of your heart god bless you and we have a gift for the mothers in the fellowship hall make sure you stop in there and pick up your gift they got a nice little gift for you and just the least we can do to show our appreciation today our father we have enjoyed the fellowship lord around your word we have enjoyed being able to take a moment and lord just praise our dear sisters and mothers and wives for what they do and who they are may you bless them abundantly and lord jesus we see in the day and age that we live and how great it is and how rare it is to have something some a woman really get a hold of this truth and find their place it's such a marvelous thing their price is above rubies we thank you for it father and trust today will be a wonderful day and we pray father that as the bride of christ as we call ourselves lord and you have called us we pray would find this spiritual place settled as our brother rap was speaking wednesday night about just a resting place a settled place and when a man creates in his provision creates security and creates what he should create the wife is secure she's settled she's settled with who she is she don't have to find her identity outside of that world of her husband but lord the husband's created such a security for her she's at rest she's at peace lord you created the greatest security for the bride of christ when you went to calvary you sacrificed and paid the price and today we enjoy the rest of the holy ghost the down payment the bride has a security in her heart we don't have to be afraid with any amazement we don't have to have hysterical fears caught up with emotions of of the the trying times and the world falling apart but we can be rested and settled lord in our position underneath the protection and headship and correction of our husband even today lord we
