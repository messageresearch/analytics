[0:00] we don't we don't realize that but God's
[0:03] been so good to us while we're standing
[0:05] perhaps we can just open our Bibles up
[0:07] to the Book of Revelation chapter 2.
[0:11] um by God's grace this evening we're
[0:13] going to continue
[0:15] um through the smyrnian church age and
[0:18] look at the one of the next doctrinal
[0:21] topics brings up and that is
[0:24] um
[0:26] eternal life eternal death and that
[0:28] there's no eternal hell
[0:31] that's the whole thing I try to take a
[0:33] look at this evening
[0:36] eternal life and eternal death but no
[0:39] eternal hell
[0:41] this comes up first in Revelation 2 11
[0:43] even half an ear let him hear what the
[0:45] spirit saith unto the churches
[0:47] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[0:50] the second death and what is the second
[0:53] death we can turn over to Revelation
[0:54] 2014 or just read it on the screen
[0:57] at the anterior death in hell are going
[0:59] to be cast into the Lake of Fire and
[1:01] that is the second death but we're told
[1:04] in Revelation Chapter 2 that he would
[1:06] overcometh will not be heard of the
[1:09] second death we can have the first death
[1:11] can touch our bodies but if you have
[1:13] Christ on the inside you'll not be hurt
[1:15] of the second death so that's your
[1:17] inspiration this evening may the Lord
[1:18] add his Blessing to his word you may be
[1:20] seated
[1:21] just uh I just uh want to express my
[1:26] appreciation brother Anton it's good to
[1:28] see him again haven't we saw each other
[1:30] uh many Summers we spent a lot of time
[1:33] together way back and appreciate the
[1:35] Anton on your work and uh he and his
[1:38] friends in Lithuania were a big
[1:39] inspiration to me when I was 16 17 years
[1:43] old I said man these are young guys like
[1:45] me are completely dedicated all their
[1:47] studies everything they're doing is
[1:48] completely dedicated to serving God
[1:50] translating the message man what can I
[1:52] study so I can be just as dedicated and
[1:54] that was a I really appreciated that
[1:57] dedication
[1:59] one of the things I I've really gained
[2:02] over the last year or two as I've kind
[2:05] of gone over the church age book and I
[2:07] say this
[2:08] um I just I I I trust these servers are
[2:11] being helped to you but what I'm really
[2:14] wanting my my the desire of my heart is
[2:18] that
[2:19] um to miss the church age book it has
[2:21] what economists call her High barriers
[2:23] to entry it can be really intimidating
[2:24] because you think man it can be it can
[2:26] be tough to get into I won't understand
[2:28] anything so we just don't get into it I
[2:30] wonder what I've tried what I'm trying
[2:31] to do is break down little pieces here
[2:33] so after I go through a chapter you can
[2:36] go through a chapter on your own because
[2:38] I want you to my my goal is that we can
[2:41] make it our own that we can get our own
[2:43] book and it becomes and it becomes our
[2:45] own Revelation not something that you
[2:47] hear from Mom or Dad that you hear from
[2:49] me your brother Paul or another Minister
[2:51] but it becomes your own I just pray that
[2:53] will be the case and I know growing up
[2:55] in the message
[2:57] like I I did
[2:59] um especially nowadays in the age of the
[3:01] internet criticisms of of Truth might
[3:04] decide Spurgeon said that uh
[3:07] um in the time that it takes truth to
[3:09] get it to boots on a live around the
[3:11] world in no time
[3:12] and you do it you do searches on the
[3:16] message and this or that and the lies
[3:18] just come up there and you get bombarded
[3:20] and yet what can I even say where can I
[3:22] start and I just love going through
[3:25] um the church age book here because
[3:27] brother Branham lays things out on a
[3:29] very biblical basis and I love taking a
[3:32] truth like we have tonight and we have a
[3:34] very Firm Foundation to stand on they're
[3:36] just like
[3:37] you do a study like this wow thank you
[3:39] Lord this is this is this is truth
[3:41] because you know we have a doctrine that
[3:44] is false in some way
[3:47] it affects excuse our view of God in
[3:50] some way so when we can when we're
[3:53] getting true Doctrine restored that's
[3:56] opening up the potential to have such a
[3:59] greater close relationship with God
[4:01] because you're corresp you're relating
[4:04] to God on the basis of truth and that's
[4:07] that's really powerful
[4:10] this doctrine of uh of eternal hell
[4:14] which most Evangelical churches are
[4:16] going to teach the messages kind of
[4:19] exceptional but it doesn't teach that I
[4:21] can remember I went to a small Baptist
[4:23] Church School
[4:24] and I can remember being a first grader
[4:27] in the chapel service I can remember I
[4:29] was in first grader because I was
[4:30] sitting right on the front second row
[4:33] and they had a an evangelist coming
[4:35] through who is doing some teaching and
[4:37] things and the end of the the end time
[4:40] coming and the Rapture and all these
[4:41] things and for the Friday Chapel he took
[4:44] questions and answers which is a kind of
[4:47] a scary thing to do with a bunch of
[4:48] little kids because they'll ask anything
[4:50] and somehow the question of Hell came up
[4:53] and I can remember as a first grader
[4:55] raising my hand and asking the question
[4:58] how can you be in Hell For Eternity
[5:00] because wouldn't you have to have
[5:02] eternal life then
[5:03] and I just remember the question because
[5:05] there was something inside this that
[5:07] can't be can it
[5:09] and that's right it can't be it's some
[5:12] of those things that a little kid can
[5:14] get that just that reaction I didn't
[5:17] understand all the doctrine but that's
[5:19] just the reaction it says no that
[5:20] doesn't make sense and God puts those
[5:22] things in this so that we can look
[5:23] tonight and see why this
[5:26] might be the case so in the in the first
[5:30] section of the spirit and church age
[5:32] about the promise of the Overcomer
[5:34] um brother Branham says after he quotes
[5:37] these two scriptures he says of course
[5:39] that means that all those who were
[5:41] therein in death and hell they were cast
[5:43] into the Lake of Fire
[5:45] now then I want to bring out something
[5:47] here for you it no doubt will cause
[5:49] people to comment on my strange Doctrine
[5:52] but I stand here on the authority of the
[5:54] word of God and deny that the unbeliever
[5:58] goes to an eternal hell and burns there
[6:01] eternally and this is something that the
[6:04] most most Christian churches are going
[6:07] to affirm and if you don't believe this
[6:09] it's it's it's her it's just as her
[6:12] radical as not believing in the Trinity
[6:13] it's it's amazing the uh the response it
[6:17] gets
[6:18] but um I'm going to talk about this
[6:20] evening take a look at uh II Timothy 1
[6:23] and verse in verse 10 especially how uh
[6:27] now is made manifest by the appearing of
[6:30] Our Savior Jesus Christ what did Christ
[6:31] do he abolished death
[6:34] and he hath brought life and immortality
[6:37] to light through the gospel and that
[6:40] last phrase is important Christ brought
[6:42] life and immortality to light through
[6:45] the gospel because these were very
[6:47] misunderstood by paganism it took the
[6:50] gospel to bring it to light the death
[6:52] and resurrection of Jesus Christ that is
[6:54] the gospel bring life into mortality to
[6:58] light
[6:59] since Jesus rose from the dead he makes
[7:02] eternal life available to us
[7:04] which means if it's available to us by
[7:07] Christ's gift we didn't have it to start
[7:10] with
[7:11] whereas most church today say everybody
[7:14] has eternal life it's just all that
[7:16] Jesus gives us is a happier eternal life
[7:19] but that's not what the Bible says he
[7:21] says he gives us eternal life he gives
[7:23] us immortality because we didn't have
[7:25] that to start with
[7:27] so this evening by God's grace we'll try
[7:29] to do this
[7:30] we'll try to cover the idea that every
[7:33] human possesses immortality that's Pagan
[7:36] it does not have its roots in the Bible
[7:38] only God possesses immortality but
[7:42] Believers can share in it through the
[7:44] death and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[7:46] it is the gift that God gives to
[7:48] Believers however through the church
[7:50] ages Pagan philosophy distorts Church to
[7:54] teaching and as it distorts Church
[7:56] teaching it also distorts people's
[7:58] perceptions of God
[8:01] and that's a big one that's a big one
[8:03] and then lastly God has restored the
[8:06] truth on eternal life and eternal death
[8:08] as opposed to
[8:09] eternal torment through the message of
[8:12] Malachi 4. and we'll see that brother
[8:14] Branham is restoring Biblical teaching
[8:16] but he's also restoring what the church
[8:18] followed what the early church fathers
[8:20] taught that's what the message of
[8:22] Malachi 4 does
[8:24] so starting off the teaching of eternal
[8:26] hell comes from a Greek and Roman
[8:28] mythology
[8:29] not the Bible and there's a story
[8:31] um in the thought in the Greek mythology
[8:33] about a man named titios and he does he
[8:38] somehow offends
[8:40] the goddess later and he the the Greek
[8:45] gods are very good at undertaking the
[8:48] Vengeance they
[8:49] um their vengeance is theirs and they
[8:51] will do it again and again and again so
[8:53] once
[8:54] um teach us dies for his foolishness he
[8:57] is sentenced to this field of punishment
[8:59] and he is chained to the ground nailed
[9:02] to the ground and his punishment was
[9:04] every day two vultures it was swing down
[9:08] and they would pluck out his liver tear
[9:11] it apart all day long tearing it apart
[9:13] and then they would fly away in the
[9:15] evening time and at night his liver
[9:17] would be completely restored so the next
[9:20] day it could happen again
[9:22] that's how it goes on and on and on
[9:24] throughout eternity it's never ever
[9:26] ending it'll be unending torment the
[9:30] same day everything the same if you ever
[9:32] read Dante's Inferno this is uh another
[9:35] perception of Hell in the time of the
[9:37] Catholic Church
[9:39] um this is the there was one man
[9:41] sentenced for a particular crime and he
[9:43] had to roll this big huge Rock up a hill
[9:46] he did it all day long only at the very
[9:47] top it would roll over top of him you
[9:50] have to run back down and repeat the
[9:52] same thing and Dante does a great job
[9:54] trying to make the punishment fit the
[9:56] crime so it'd be appropriate in some way
[9:58] but this is eternal this unending and
[10:03] look at look at the Pagan God Zeus he's
[10:05] the he's the god of the sky god of
[10:07] thunder and what a different pers this
[10:10] is this is the perception that many
[10:12] people have of God
[10:13] a God just waiting to throw a
[10:15] thunderbolt down I gotcha
[10:18] the god of the Bible though doesn't have
[10:20] a thunderbolt in his hand he's got his
[10:22] arms outstretched
[10:24] and when Satan comes in
[10:27] distorts Church teaching on how God's
[10:30] justice has taken part in eternal hell
[10:33] what he does is he takes the god of the
[10:36] cross
[10:37] takes Jesus down and he puts God with a
[10:40] thunderbolt in its place
[10:42] that's why this is important because it
[10:45] completely changes someone's perception
[10:48] of God so we can observe from this myth
[10:50] these pagan gods are vengeful they are
[10:55] easily offended well who created the
[10:58] pagan gods the pagan gods are gods that
[11:01] men made in their own image and in the
[11:04] pagans Gods you see man's worst
[11:06] attributes writ large exaggerated
[11:09] it's easy to make your own God and it'll
[11:11] have your own attributes exaggerated
[11:13] but God does he takes man and transforms
[11:17] man into his own image that's a miracle
[11:21] but the devil tries to get us to do it
[11:23] backwards and gives us it makes us feel
[11:25] like we're on a power trip as we're
[11:27] doing that
[11:28] but the vengeful the pagan gods are
[11:30] eventual they're sadists they Delight in
[11:33] punishment the god of the Bible Delights
[11:37] in Mercy
[11:39] and then so they're very they're also
[11:41] very unjust we don't see the punishment
[11:44] being proportioned to the crime
[11:46] they want this punishment to go on and
[11:48] on and on and on so we know that guy
[11:50] really really suffers and you know what
[11:53] when someone does us wrong
[11:55] that is the tendency that we have
[11:59] they did that strong and says man
[12:00] something bad happens to them yeah see
[12:02] that's their Just Desserts I hope they
[12:03] really feel it that's how we feel
[12:06] but that's not how God is God Delights
[12:09] in Mercy and but he help us do the same
[12:12] so and also the basic assumption behind
[12:15] this myth is that everybody has
[12:17] immortality no matter what and in the in
[12:20] the Greek mythology after the physical
[12:23] body died the person's Spirit went down
[12:27] to the underworld and they would just
[12:29] hang out there they would be in in limbo
[12:33] that comes from Greek mythology they
[12:34] would just be there and if they lived a
[12:36] good life they'd be down to this kind of
[12:38] Happy Hunting Ground if they didn't live
[12:40] such a good life they'd be
[12:43] um like teachers there on the field of
[12:46] punishment
[12:48] one church historian says that this
[12:51] Assumption of universal immortality that
[12:54] every single human is Immortal just it's
[12:56] a default characteristic he says that is
[12:58] one of the clearest areas where Pagan
[13:02] philosophy influences Christian doctrine
[13:05] he says two Christian doctrines are
[13:07] perhaps the most reliable indications of
[13:11] the continuing hold of Greek philosophy
[13:14] on Christian Theology and one of them is
[13:16] the doctrine of the immortality of the
[13:18] soul but the soul is Immortal just
[13:21] because that's the way they're created
[13:22] immortality though according to the
[13:24] Bible is a gift of God
[13:25] but Greek philosophy says everybody has
[13:28] it
[13:29] First Timothy 6 16 says God only has
[13:34] immortality that's pretty clear nobody
[13:36] else has immortality only God for page
[13:40] two if you're following along yet God
[13:42] gives this to his children he wants his
[13:45] children those who come to him and ask
[13:48] him for repentance forgiveness of their
[13:50] sins that is a gift of God the wages
[13:53] of sin is death but the gift of God is
[13:57] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[13:59] Lord whoever believes in him should not
[14:02] perish but have everlasting life this is
[14:06] immortality is a gift of God we're not
[14:09] we're not born with it we don't earn it
[14:12] um it is completely a gift of God
[14:16] and that Paul teaches this yet we also
[14:20] see that the early church fathers taught
[14:23] it here we have a quote from irenius's
[14:25] book we talked about irenius two weeks
[14:27] ago he says the soul participates in
[14:30] life because God Wills the soul to live
[14:33] thus it will not even have such
[14:36] participation in life when God no longer
[14:38] wills it to live so life is given to us
[14:41] oh and we only have life as long as God
[14:43] gives it to us we do not have
[14:45] immortality without God giving it to us
[14:48] another man named Tatian who is a
[14:50] student of Justin Martyr he says in
[14:52] itself the soul is not Immortal but
[14:55] mortal we can only receive immortality
[14:58] if God gives it to us
[15:01] so despite the pretty clear teachings of
[15:05] Paul that life is eternal life is a gift
[15:07] of God if it's a gift we didn't have it
[15:09] otherwise it wouldn't be a gift
[15:11] um
[15:12] early church fathers taught this yet
[15:14] like we said for a long time
[15:17] Evangelical churches have taught that um
[15:20] that um
[15:22] the hell was eternal here's a from the
[15:26] um from one organization I pulled this
[15:27] off their website The Gospel Light
[15:29] Society
[15:30] he says um
[15:32] as awful as death is to us the truth is
[15:34] that those who die are not forever
[15:36] extinguished from existence they simply
[15:38] pass from this life to another realm of
[15:40] Life a place where they still exist and
[15:43] they're just as real but a place for
[15:45] people in this world cannot see them and
[15:47] when we die we pass from the Physical
[15:48] Realm into the spiritual realm we still
[15:51] exist we are no longer tied to the
[15:54] physical world our souls travel to face
[15:56] God where we'll give an account of all
[15:58] that we've done in their physical lives
[16:00] and after you die you will be ushered
[16:02] into one of two places to spend eternity
[16:05] and the title of the article is
[16:08] where everyone will spend uh will live
[16:12] somewhere forever
[16:13] where were you where you choose your
[16:15] destination where are you going to live
[16:16] forever we're all going to live forever
[16:18] somewhere and there's truth in the
[16:20] article yes we're going to appear before
[16:22] God everybody will
[16:24] but the question posed
[16:26] is everyone going to live forever
[16:28] somewhere yes they they say that but the
[16:30] Bible doesn't present us a choice of
[16:32] living somewhere forever the Bible
[16:34] presents a choice of Salvation and
[16:37] perishing between life and death
[16:40] somewhere forever sounds really good
[16:42] but you don't find that Concept in the
[16:45] Bible it's between life and death
[16:46] between salvation and perishing First
[16:48] Corinthians 1 18 the preaching of the
[16:50] Cross is to them that perish foolishness
[16:52] but unto us which are saved it's the
[16:55] power of God
[16:57] um II Thessalonians 2 10 with all
[16:59] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[17:01] them that perish not in them who live
[17:05] in the Underworld forever but in them
[17:06] that perish that and then because
[17:09] they've received not the love of truth
[17:10] that they might be saved John 5 24 talks
[17:14] about them having everlasting life
[17:16] because they've passed from Death unto
[17:19] life so living somewhere forever is not
[17:21] the choice the Bible presents the Bible
[17:23] prays a choice between perishing and
[17:26] salvation that's the that's that's the
[17:28] biblical choice
[17:31] so in in his teaching on on Hell brother
[17:33] Branham is taking something that the
[17:35] Bible teaches
[17:36] that the early church fathers taught yet
[17:39] was gradually lost over the centuries
[17:42] and He restored it and this is something
[17:44] he'll refer to as Loose Ends being tied
[17:49] up and this is one of the Mysteries that
[17:51] the seventh angel
[17:53] um is tying up Revelation 10 7 talked
[17:56] about the mystery of God should be
[17:58] finished he's tying up the various loose
[18:01] ends that were left about history and
[18:04] it's interesting just taking a short
[18:06] little Rabbit Trail here think about
[18:08] what are
[18:09] um Loose Ends
[18:11] um the thing about Loose Ends could be
[18:13] teachings that are out of balance in
[18:16] some way because they're not truly
[18:17] connected to Christ there's definitely
[18:19] truth there but some has gone way
[18:21] overboard and you can't accept the truth
[18:23] the way it's presented here but there's
[18:26] a real kernel that we wish we could get
[18:27] that in the right setting and then that
[18:29] would make a be a beautiful Gem of Truth
[18:33] I mean noticed a wrong Doctrine
[18:36] we'll give a wrong image of the nature
[18:38] of Christ and you can have a lot of
[18:39] people around who will believe
[18:41] a truth that's out of balance and
[18:43] they're going to have a skewed view of
[18:45] God because of it and it's really can be
[18:47] really difficult to talk about that
[18:49] because you'll talk past each other
[18:51] because they're believing a part of
[18:53] Truth and that'll be completely
[18:54] continually repeated but it's a loosen
[18:58] it's not really connected to the nature
[19:00] of Christ as it should be and if you
[19:02] have a lot of loose sins your faith is
[19:05] going to be unstable
[19:08] at the bottom of page two um
[19:13] brother Branham talks about Christianity
[19:15] it has many loose sins well there's just
[19:18] really One Faith and going over on top
[19:21] of Page Three someone says
[19:24] if the methodists don't want us we'll go
[19:26] over to the Baptist the Baptists don't
[19:28] want us to go to the Pentecostal the
[19:29] assemblies don't want us to go to the
[19:30] united we just keep going one after the
[19:33] other and we become then Mission
[19:34] Trotters hardly know what to believe and
[19:37] it says because there's too many Loose
[19:38] Ends it's not being connected to to uh
[19:41] to Christ what the word what the church
[19:43] needs is to get back to the word and
[19:46] back to God and a loose end is someone
[19:49] who hardly knows what to believe and
[19:51] it's not really tied to Christ and the
[19:53] message believed from the heart
[19:56] he says we have accepted the word on the
[19:58] intellectual basis and we've seen so
[20:00] many total failures
[20:02] until it's brought people to a place
[20:04] that they just hardly know what to
[20:06] believe because one person was a great
[20:08] leader another person was a great leader
[20:10] another person was a great leader and
[20:11] become the great manners of the great
[20:12] God then disappointment disappointment
[20:15] disappointment now what do I do
[20:18] and as does and then people look at each
[20:20] other yeah as long as you're sincere
[20:22] that's the main thing as long as you're
[20:24] sincereable that's not what the Bible's
[20:26] talking not what the Bible teaches
[20:28] it just got where you have a lot of
[20:30] loose ends to their religion they run
[20:31] out on limbs this way and that way and
[20:34] they come to an end they got to come
[20:35] crawling back
[20:37] um so if you have a bunch of loose ends
[20:39] you're not really tied to Christ you
[20:43] don't really know what to believe
[20:46] and a loosing could be a truth or a
[20:48] mystery that's not completely revealed
[20:50] explained or taught
[20:52] and I like thinking about ellucian I can
[20:55] also regard our our personal life if
[20:57] something in our life that we're really
[20:58] focusing on isn't tied to Christ
[21:02] it's a loose end
[21:04] um we have to we have to I mean
[21:06] everything we're doing God wants to be
[21:07] the Lord of all of our life not just a
[21:09] part of it we want to have a we want to
[21:11] be all anchored in and tied in with
[21:12] Christ Romans 1 1 says Paul is a servant
[21:15] of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
[21:18] separated unto the gospel of God and the
[21:22] loose end is just separated from
[21:25] but we want to be separated from and
[21:27] also separated unto because if we're
[21:29] only separated from we're in danger of
[21:32] becoming a loose end ourselves expending
[21:34] a lot of energy
[21:35] trying to say good things and do good
[21:37] things but we're expending energy and
[21:40] not really they're not tied in what
[21:42] God's doing and it's all in vain we want
[21:45] to be connected with what we're doing is
[21:47] connected that we're saying Christ's
[21:49] word but also with his nature because if
[21:52] you just say the word without his nature
[21:54] the wrong thing is going to come across
[21:56] you want to have those two together
[21:58] otherwise you're kind of in threat of
[22:00] being a loose end yourself and
[22:03] loose ends you have a lot of unfocused
[22:05] growth in that last uh quote there on
[22:07] page three
[22:08] he says uh if you cut a tree back it'll
[22:11] bear better don't let too many Loose
[22:13] Ends get run out on it that's what's the
[22:16] matter today we have too many Loose Ends
[22:18] running out this way and this way and
[22:20] that away too many societies too many of
[22:23] this and too much of that but let's come
[22:25] back to one thing Calvary where we can
[22:28] sing with our heart
[22:30] well we're all we got the Dutch having
[22:31] the expression will get all noses
[22:33] pointed in the same direction if you've
[22:35] got that then you're tied in with the
[22:37] same vision you're connected to to
[22:39] Christ then you can get a lot done a lot
[22:42] of accomplished otherwise it's just
[22:43] spending energy this way that way that
[22:45] way that way but not focused not
[22:48] together not doing what what God might
[22:51] be calling us do and the way he's called
[22:52] us to do it and this doctrine of
[22:56] no eternal hell this was a loose end it
[22:59] has been out there the disciples taught
[23:03] it Paul taught it the church father
[23:05] taught it but it needed to be tied back
[23:07] in this is the mystery of God could be
[23:10] finished like Revelation 10 7 says
[23:13] so kind of talking about in the
[23:15] afterlife what does brother Graham teach
[23:17] about what does the bible teach about it
[23:19] and he says in the afterlife there's
[23:21] going to be three places and this is
[23:23] questions and answers on um on Hebrews
[23:25] two he says don't never lose them three
[23:28] places now there's the place of the
[23:29] wicked
[23:30] the place of the righteous and Hell
[23:33] itself and other places he talks about
[23:36] these three causes the regions of the
[23:38] Lost
[23:39] the regions of the Blessed and then hell
[23:41] itself is don't lose these three places
[23:44] don't get them blurred
[23:46] I'm talking about the regions of the
[23:47] Lost
[23:48] um and and the Old Testament this I mean
[23:50] let's talk about when the English words
[23:53] are being translated hell that's the
[23:55] Hebrew word sheol and here at Isaiah 14
[23:58] 9 it says hell from beneath is moved for
[24:00] thee to meet the ethi coming it stirs up
[24:04] the dead for thee so that the dead are
[24:07] somewhere after they die their Spirits
[24:09] are somewhere they're they're in the
[24:12] place of of waiting and Hebrews called
[24:14] sheol
[24:16] and this is if if this was a person who
[24:19] wasn't following
[24:20] um God who it wasn't a Christian who
[24:23] hadn't been a believer in Jehovah in the
[24:25] Old Testament that's a region of the
[24:27] lost but they're still there
[24:29] and they're going to be brought up and
[24:31] and come to stand before God
[24:33] so that's uh in the temple from Isaiah
[24:35] and the Greek that's called Hades is the
[24:39] region of the lost and in Revelation 20
[24:41] John writes I saw a great white Throne
[24:44] on him that sat on it from his face the
[24:46] Earth and Heaven fled away and there was
[24:48] found no place for them and I saw the
[24:50] dead small and great come stand before
[24:52] God and the books were opened and
[24:54] another book was opened which is The
[24:56] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[24:58] out of those things were written in the
[25:00] books according to their works so this
[25:03] regions of the lost this this Hades is
[25:05] where the dead are before they come to
[25:08] this day of judgment they're waiting
[25:10] somewhere and then they'll come before
[25:12] God at that white Throne judgment
[25:15] and the Sea gave up the dead which are
[25:16] in it and death and Hell delivered up
[25:19] the dead which were in them this is the
[25:21] place where they go the dead will go
[25:23] they wait and they're waiting to be
[25:26] judged before God
[25:28] but this is a this is a terrible place
[25:31] um because you already know you're lost
[25:35] um just like a little kid at home with
[25:38] Mom all day and he's been mischievous
[25:42] he's been doing all kinds of things he's
[25:43] not supposed to be doing and pushing Mom
[25:45] keep pushing mom and keep pushing on me
[25:48] you know you all know if you push mom
[25:49] far enough
[25:50] there could be fireworks
[25:52] but this time the kid pushes mom so far
[25:55] there aren't fireworks and that's even
[25:58] more dangerous because Mom just says you
[26:00] know what
[26:01] you go to your room when your father
[26:03] gets home he's going to decide what to
[26:05] do for you
[26:08] that kid knows he's not going to the
[26:10] region of the Blessed
[26:13] he's going to his room and that is the
[26:16] region of the lost and he might be there
[26:18] for an hour or two and all kinds of
[26:21] nightmarish thoughts are going through
[26:23] his mind what is my dad going to do to
[26:27] me what is he going to do
[26:28] and he hears a car go down the road
[26:36] they try I mean the comic books have no
[26:38] appeal to him anymore nothing is any
[26:39] appeal to him anymore here's another car
[26:41] go down the road it's the neighborhood
[26:42] and finally dad comes home and his dad
[26:45] please forgive me please but no this is
[26:47] the region of the lost this is Mom has
[26:51] you've pushed mom so far we're going to
[26:53] have punishment here and when dad comes
[26:56] home that's the great white Throne
[26:58] judgment there's not gonna be Mercia
[27:01] there there could be sentences there
[27:03] could be all kinds of things there could
[27:05] there could be lashings you'd be on the
[27:07] rack it could be all kinds of terrible
[27:09] things could happen all that is going on
[27:11] but this is the region of the Lost he
[27:13] hasn't been judged yet he's awaiting the
[27:16] judgment
[27:17] sometimes that's almost worse in the
[27:19] Judgment itself
[27:20] and this is this region of the lost this
[27:22] is what brother Branham sees as a young
[27:25] boy after he's involved this hunting
[27:27] accident and his legs get shot up and
[27:30] he's in he's losing blood and he wakes
[27:33] up as isn't he's in the hospital and he
[27:36] goes into this other realm and he's just
[27:38] descending descending descending into
[27:41] this Blackness and then these these
[27:43] things
[27:45] it just Spooks him out I mean you don't
[27:49] want to listen to that tape kids before
[27:50] you go to bed you don't do that but this
[27:53] is this is the region of the law this is
[27:55] this is this he's saying whatever you do
[27:57] don't go there
[28:00] so the region of the lost it's um
[28:03] it's a prison house it's a jailhouse and
[28:07] the brother Brown is clear and it's
[28:08] distinction the region of the Lost is
[28:11] not the burning fire of hell
[28:14] that's just the prison house that's kind
[28:16] of like if you get caught by the police
[28:18] you get put in jail jail in prison are
[28:21] different you get put in jail
[28:23] when you go before the judge the judge
[28:25] sits you to prison
[28:26] the region of the Lost is jail where
[28:28] you're awaiting sentencing so on the top
[28:31] of page four and the message um
[28:34] Souls that are in prison now brother
[28:36] Branham says Jesus went and preached the
[28:39] souls that were in prison which is Hell
[28:42] locked up until the day of judgment
[28:45] because you see the Judgment isn't now
[28:48] and there is no burning hell now
[28:52] somebody to tell you that the guy is
[28:53] burning in hell now he says no that's
[28:55] wrong see a judge of this Earth is just
[28:57] enough to never condemn a man until he's
[28:59] brought to trial
[29:01] so right now somebody dies and they're
[29:03] in sin they're going to go to the region
[29:05] of the loss that's like my son being
[29:07] sent to his room waiting for Dad to come
[29:09] home he knows he's lost he knows it's
[29:11] without hope he's going to have judgment
[29:13] coming what it's going to be that'll
[29:15] come after his trial
[29:17] because God will never throw a man into
[29:19] the fiery furnace until first he's
[29:21] condemned by God's Own laws he rejected
[29:23] mercy so you see he first has to have a
[29:25] trial and the trials the great white
[29:28] throw in judgment but now he's in a
[29:30] place called a prison house that's just
[29:32] that is the region of the lost and it's
[29:36] a nightmarish place because you know
[29:38] judgment's coming your conscience
[29:40] convinces of you of this but there's
[29:42] absolutely nothing more you can do about
[29:44] it because you're dead
[29:46] you've heard and you'll be thinking all
[29:48] the sermons that you've heard and you'll
[29:50] be thinking I should have done this I
[29:51] should have done it and you'll be going
[29:52] back I could have made this choice I
[29:53] could have made I couldn't I just wish I
[29:55] could I can't I wish I could but I can't
[29:59] that's a terrible terrible thing and
[30:01] what a gift life is what we just say all
[30:05] my life you have been faithful
[30:07] my goodness it is not anything of our
[30:09] own goodness that we made right choices
[30:11] it is the grace of God but he's been so
[30:15] faithful but if you go that far and you
[30:18] find that you're you haven't trusted
[30:19] Christ and then you're in you die and
[30:22] you know the judgment's coming that's in
[30:24] that region of the Lost awaiting the
[30:26] white they're on judgment brother
[30:27] Bradham says in the message remembering
[30:29] the Lord don't wait till some region
[30:32] yondering in the Damned in that
[30:34] Dimension where you cannot go in the
[30:36] presence of God and your time is up on
[30:38] Earth and that nightmare of horror
[30:41] you'll remember you had your opportunity
[30:43] and turned it away what a privilege it
[30:46] is in this life
[30:48] to experience the presence of God
[30:51] I tell I tell my kids at school at in
[30:54] the chapel so many times it is such a
[30:56] gift of God where you can feel him
[30:58] pulling on your heart never take that
[31:01] for granted that is the greatest thing
[31:03] there is in life God pulling on your
[31:06] heart because Genesis says God said
[31:08] before the flood there will come a time
[31:10] where my spirit will no longer strive
[31:12] with man so if God's pulling on your
[31:15] heart that is the best thing that can
[31:17] happen to you jump in go for him because
[31:20] he will meet you there he has promised
[31:23] he would
[31:25] so brother Graham said don't forget
[31:27] those three places the region of the
[31:28] lost and then he's also talks about the
[31:30] region of the bless of the region of the
[31:32] law says where someone who dies who's
[31:34] lost goes to await judgment
[31:36] which is the white Throne judgment the
[31:39] region of the bless is where someone
[31:40] will go after they've passed away who
[31:42] has had faith in God
[31:45] and John 5 24 says verily verily I say
[31:48] unto you he that heareth my word and
[31:50] beliefs on him that sent me has
[31:52] everlasting life and won't come in the
[31:55] condemnation but passed from Death unto
[31:57] life so when you when you're given
[32:00] everlasting life you you're you're
[32:03] you're you're living you pass away and
[32:06] then you jump this whole region of the
[32:08] lost you don't have to enter that
[32:10] Dominion at all you jump over and you're
[32:12] right into the region of the Blessed
[32:14] it's it's so much I mean I get out of
[32:16] jail free card from Monopoly isn't it
[32:18] isn't comparable you jump right over it
[32:20] has no threat on you no claim for you
[32:23] you just come out of it yes I'm done and
[32:25] just fly right over and we and you land
[32:28] there and you're in this region that
[32:29] you've hoped for once you're there I
[32:32] mean just imagine the kid comes home
[32:33] from school he says mom I did such a
[32:35] good job I got a hundred on my test to
[32:37] teach that was fantastic and Mom says oh
[32:39] I'm so happy for you it'll be awesome
[32:41] when Dad gets home and you can tell him
[32:43] and then every time that I can't well
[32:46] the car has been oh it's the mailman but
[32:48] dad's still coming you have this blessed
[32:51] blessed expectation blessed anticipation
[32:53] because the joy that you have and
[32:55] knowing that when dad comes home the
[32:57] reward is going to be even greater I
[32:59] mean just the everything the devil has
[33:01] is such a a knockoff it's a poor
[33:05] imitation that just damns us but God has
[33:09] the pure so if you if you have if you
[33:10] believe you pass right from Death right
[33:14] into life you're right there waiting for
[33:16] it even you're you're close to God and
[33:18] even better is coming I think it's just
[33:20] beautiful
[33:22] Luke 14 14 says
[33:25] you shall be blessed
[33:27] for they cannot recompense the if you if
[33:29] you do something that's good to somebody
[33:31] who can't uh who can't pay you back
[33:33] you'll be blessed because they can't
[33:34] recompense you God's will you will be
[33:37] recompensed at the resurrection
[33:39] of the just this resurrection of the
[33:42] just we can call a couple different
[33:43] things based on different scriptures
[33:46] revelation 20.
[33:48] so keep the resurrection of the just in
[33:50] your mind Revelation 20 let's talk about
[33:53] the a resurrection the first and verse 5
[33:56] what resurrects first is the the sorry
[34:00] let's read dead verse 4. I saw Thrones
[34:02] they sat upon him and judgment was given
[34:05] unto them and I saw the souls of them
[34:07] that were beheaded for the witness of
[34:09] Jesus
[34:10] for the word of God which had not
[34:13] worshiped the Beast neither his image
[34:16] neither had received his Mark upon their
[34:18] foreheads or in their hands and they
[34:19] lived and reigned with Christ for a
[34:21] thousand years
[34:22] but the rest of the Dead lived not again
[34:24] as the thousand years were finished so
[34:26] the rest of the Dead they're going to
[34:28] come up later but this first group of
[34:30] dead people who had been beheaded for
[34:31] the word of God who had given their
[34:33] lives for God they come up first that's
[34:36] the first resurrection and they're going
[34:38] to be coming up into this so they come
[34:41] out of the region of the blast where
[34:44] they're waiting and they come up first
[34:45] to Christ so there's a resurrection of
[34:47] the just and the first resurrection you
[34:49] are the same thing
[34:52] and then you can look at um
[34:55] verse 6 blessed and holy is he the half
[34:58] part in this first resurrection because
[35:00] on such the second death hath no power
[35:03] there's no risk of the person who's who
[35:07] has skipped over the region of the lost
[35:09] and right into the regions of the
[35:11] blessed there's no risk of them ever
[35:12] coming into the Lake of Fire because
[35:15] that that that can't touch them they the
[35:19] second death has absolutely no power
[35:20] over them
[35:22] the devil thinks that he has death has
[35:24] power over us in this life but it
[35:25] doesn't it can't touch us all it does is
[35:28] liberate us and get us into Christ's
[35:30] presence all the faster
[35:33] and uh so this this first resurrection
[35:35] uh the resurrection of the just that's
[35:38] the same thing as what we read in first
[35:39] Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord himself will
[35:42] descend with a shout with the voice of
[35:44] an archangel with the Trump of God and
[35:46] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[35:48] that's this first resurrection the
[35:50] resurrect Resurrection of the just these
[35:53] are all talking about the same event
[35:54] where they're they're dead they're
[35:57] righteous and they're waiting to be
[35:59] called up and they get their reward
[36:01] first
[36:02] we together here
[36:04] I think about Hebrews 11 also think
[36:06] about this last night at the end of
[36:08] Hebrews 11 is the great faith chapter
[36:10] and all these Heroes of the faith are
[36:12] talked about this person who's Samson it
[36:14] was a the Bible talks about Sam's as a
[36:17] hero of the faith it's just wonderful
[36:18] when God looks at us through his
[36:20] blood-stained spectacles wow even
[36:23] Samson's a hero of the faith all the
[36:25] Abrahams Sarah all these different ones
[36:29] and then he says they without us cannot
[36:31] be made perfect they're waiting for us
[36:34] they're they're waiting what are they
[36:36] doing as they're waiting Hebrews chapter
[36:37] 12 says we're running a race and this is
[36:41] this great cloud of witnesses who are
[36:43] there in this region of the Blessed
[36:44] watching us cheering us on because well
[36:47] they want to get in there and get their
[36:49] rewarding the faster we get our reward
[36:51] we'll all be there together they're
[36:52] watching us from that great region
[36:55] so we got the region the Lost region the
[36:57] blessed and then brother Graham talked
[36:59] about this third region is is Hell
[37:02] itself
[37:03] and Matthew 25 26
[37:08] um says that let me see I haven't
[37:10] printed out
[37:13] um some show these Sinners shall go away
[37:16] into Everlasting punishment but the
[37:19] righteous will go into life eternal
[37:22] and this gives some confusion is this
[37:25] Everlasting punishment as
[37:28] Eternal as the life is that the believer
[37:32] is going to enjoy and I want to talk
[37:35] about this what because you interpret
[37:37] scripture with scripture if you look at
[37:39] this one isolated scripture it appears
[37:41] that there is Everlasting torment and
[37:43] everlasting life on the other side but
[37:46] if you interpret scripture with
[37:47] scripture I think we'll see something
[37:48] different
[37:49] first of all hell's purpose is to
[37:54] annihilate a talk the second death is
[37:56] talking about well death what do we know
[37:59] death to be death is the the end of
[38:02] something
[38:03] and um
[38:05] if you look at the first death is death
[38:07] or a physical body the second death is
[38:09] death to the soul when we talk about our
[38:11] physical body dying it's it's gone
[38:14] when the so that's the image God gives
[38:17] us to understand the second death if the
[38:19] first death has our body completely
[38:21] going away the same would happen to our
[38:24] to our soul
[38:27] death is not an eternal process I would
[38:31] say it's better to look at as being an
[38:33] eternal result and let's look at Jude 7
[38:36] here this is also a scripture that's
[38:37] often pointed to us sure look hell is
[38:40] eternal
[38:41] Sodom and Gomorrah the cities around
[38:43] about them and like manner they gave
[38:44] themselves over to fornication going
[38:46] after strange flesh and they're set
[38:48] forth for an example suffering the
[38:50] Vengeance of Eternal fire and people say
[38:52] look the Bible talks about
[38:54] eternal fire
[38:56] eternal torment that's how hell is going
[38:58] to be
[38:59] but
[39:00] I grabbed this this picture yesterday
[39:02] this is the state of California
[39:05] at the picture taken from a satellite of
[39:07] the forest fires that were there
[39:09] now I just want to suggest that if Jude
[39:11] 7 is talking about Saban Gabor having
[39:14] Eternal fire you would be able to take a
[39:16] satellite picture above the Middle East
[39:18] somewhere and you would still see smoke
[39:19] Rising above there because this fire is
[39:22] completely going
[39:24] that's not what you see because this
[39:26] destruction is not an eternal process
[39:28] that goes on and on continuing
[39:30] throughout eternity but it's an eternal
[39:32] result we're destroyed for all eternity
[39:36] no sign of them ever coming back they're
[39:39] gone completely gone NADA and that's
[39:41] what happens when when our body is dead
[39:45] it goes back it completely it's gone
[39:48] when our soul dies after the second
[39:50] death someone's Soul it'll it'll be gone
[39:52] that's the purpose of Hell to annihilate
[39:56] and then we also see multiple scriptures
[39:59] showing there's a there's a great
[40:01] um finality in God's judgment I've got
[40:05] just some of them here
[40:06] Malachi 4 1 says the day comes that will
[40:09] burn them up it'll leave neither root
[40:12] nor Branch nothing's going to be left
[40:15] after this this fire goes through there
[40:17] nothing
[40:18] Matthew 10 28 says to fear Him who's
[40:22] able to destroy both body and soul and
[40:25] Hell destroy is a pretty Final Act
[40:30] um Philippians 3 19 talks about those
[40:32] whose end is destruction
[40:36] Hebrews 2 14 that through Death Christ
[40:38] might destroy him that had the power of
[40:41] death but it's the devil does the devil
[40:43] have any chance of coming back after
[40:45] this no he's destroyed gone just by
[40:49] illustration I can remember I was in the
[40:52] when my wife we bought a house in the
[40:53] Netherlands and we love the backyard
[40:56] here as we had the the house and there
[40:58] was a little canal and between behind
[41:00] the canal was this railroad track but
[41:02] between the River track and the canal it
[41:04] was filled with trees it was
[41:08] we fell in love with it and then right
[41:10] before we go and close on the house we
[41:11] go look at it one more time it's this
[41:13] protocol you go through and look at it
[41:14] and we walked in the house we looked out
[41:15] the window all the trees had been cut
[41:19] down all right
[41:22] because that was the property the
[41:23] railroad and every 20 years they just
[41:25] kind of turn everything back like man
[41:27] this is not what we thought we were
[41:29] buying but we went ahead and got it but
[41:32] you know what
[41:33] they weren't destroyed those trees I
[41:36] remember one of them had been named
[41:38] pretty much is you had you had the stump
[41:41] there was just taken out of the stump
[41:42] well a year or two later I go back out
[41:44] there and what do I see from that stump
[41:46] there are shoots coming forth
[41:49] I thought it was just destroyed but no
[41:52] it wasn't but when God destroys
[41:54] something Malachi 4 it'll leave neither
[41:57] root nor branch
[41:59] because when that when the railroad took
[42:01] off those trees they left potential for
[42:04] things to come back that's not what
[42:06] God's talking about with hell that you
[42:08] can come out of hell and be in bloom
[42:11] again
[42:11] that's not what God the purpose is to
[42:13] annihilate never a chance of coming back
[42:16] again there's a finality in God's
[42:18] judgment if it's not final destroy
[42:21] doesn't mean much
[42:22] doesn't mean anything it's kind of mean
[42:24] Junior High people say I want to destroy
[42:27] you they don't mean that
[42:28] God doesn't joke around with that kind
[42:30] of a word when he says destroy he means
[42:32] destroy
[42:34] let's see here
[42:35] questions and answers brother Bears I
[42:37] don't believe the Bible teaches an
[42:39] eternal burning hell it doesn't
[42:42] because if hell is eternal and people
[42:44] that go there will be punished eternally
[42:46] the only way they could be eternally
[42:48] punished they'd have to have
[42:49] eternal life and there's only one form
[42:52] of eternal life and that's in God see so
[42:55] they have to come to Annihilation that
[42:57] is their physical part becomes
[43:00] annihilated and then their spiritual
[43:03] apart becomes annihilated that's
[43:05] completely consumed there's no more of
[43:08] it neither Rootin or branch of the Bible
[43:10] quote they are completely done away
[43:15] I think that's true
[43:17] and but brother brother Branham talks
[43:19] about
[43:20] eternity there can't be any eternal hell
[43:21] because there's only one form of eternal
[43:23] life and that's from God it's not just
[43:25] an argument from from from logic that
[43:28] Eternal life's only from God you and any
[43:30] other form of it's not that way no
[43:32] brother band's teaching on on the
[43:34] eternal life the Eternal
[43:36] um death without the eternal hell
[43:37] focuses everything on God's life
[43:40] and that's
[43:42] not a loose end that's being completely
[43:44] tied in with who God is and what God is
[43:47] we'll talk more about that here as we uh
[43:49] as we come toward the end
[43:51] brother Randomness I believe in Eternal
[43:54] death
[43:55] yes I believe in that because it is
[43:58] final the process isn't but the result
[44:01] is it's an eternal death same as I
[44:04] believe in Eternal heaven but not in
[44:07] eternal hell there is no such a thing as
[44:10] an eternal hell
[44:11] was created so if it's created it can't
[44:15] be
[44:17] Eternal because something that's created
[44:19] has a beginning that's Eternal doesn't
[44:23] um and again I'm not gonna it sounds
[44:25] like
[44:27] it's a stomach it can sound like brother
[44:28] random says this he's just
[44:30] um parsing words but it's not that way
[44:33] at all he's bringing it right back he's
[44:35] rooting his Doctrine and who God is and
[44:38] that's the best place to root something
[44:41] it was created for the devil and his
[44:43] angels God Jesus did not come to bring
[44:45] death
[44:47] he came to bring life he did not create
[44:50] um hell so I can he can be Zeus up on
[44:53] high look at all those mistakes people
[44:54] made in a week into the righteous get to
[44:57] have a great time in heaven looking over
[44:58] and seeing all those bad people who did
[45:00] them wrong and they will be falling into
[45:02] the flames and that's not the that's not
[45:05] where we're going to get our kicks in
[45:06] heaven not at all
[45:09] um
[45:09] it was created for the devil and his
[45:11] Angel God doesn't send any man to hell
[45:16] in fact it's not necessary that anybody
[45:18] should go there God doesn't send no one
[45:21] to hell you send yourself to Hell God
[45:24] has done everything in the world he can
[45:26] to keep you from going to hell and he
[45:30] lets you determine to go to hell
[45:32] he puts on free moral agencies because
[45:34] we're amazing His Image God is a moral
[45:36] actor he has a choice we're Made In His
[45:38] Image we also have a choice God wants
[45:40] people who love him out of a free will
[45:42] not a robot
[45:46] either he lets you make may make a
[45:49] choice yet you fight over every
[45:51] barricade that God puts in your way and
[45:54] you can look back and see you have to
[45:56] work you have to make a choice here you
[45:57] have to make a choice here and you can
[45:59] remember somebody's told me I shouldn't
[46:00] do this somebody told me I shouldn't do
[46:02] that
[46:02] God's putting barricades there yet you
[46:05] just go right on on over it
[46:07] because if you follow if you choose to
[46:09] follow the devil you will end up or he
[46:12] ends up it's a principle of leadership
[46:17] at the white Throne judgment people will
[46:20] be judged according to their works
[46:23] and according to the light revealed to
[46:25] them so when Dad gets home he's gonna
[46:28] have a conversation with son
[46:29] or daughter as the case may be because
[46:31] daughters are not always Saints either
[46:33] they have this this conversation and did
[46:36] you do this
[46:38] did you do this yes I did be judged Base
[46:41] According to you worked did you know you
[46:42] shouldn't do that yes and sometimes in
[46:45] those conversations something comes up
[46:47] and maybe they didn't know all the way
[46:50] and then that'll be ground for mercy
[46:53] and then it's a really awkward position
[46:55] to be in sometimes you're you're as the
[46:57] as the judge you're all gunned up to
[47:00] be this righteous judgment oh wow there
[47:02] is some cause here to show mercy and
[47:04] then God will do that a righteous judge
[47:06] if if a parent finds out that there is a
[47:09] misunderstanding somewhere or the to the
[47:12] kid's cell phone went off
[47:15] no battery and they didn't get the
[47:17] message and the mom's so mad at that
[47:19] when they get home I'm going to read
[47:20] them the riot act they're going to be
[47:22] grounded for life
[47:24] but then but Mom I didn't get the
[47:26] message and you looked and all of a
[47:28] sudden you can't ground them for life
[47:29] you would be unjust to do that
[47:33] um you might want to show there are such
[47:35] thing as Chargers you can have those
[47:37] kinds of conversations but grounded for
[47:38] life is kind of unjust
[47:41] so Luke 12
[47:43] shows that you'll be judged based
[47:45] according according to your works that
[47:47] servant who knew his Lord's will
[47:50] and prepared not himself neither did
[47:52] according to his will shall be beaten
[47:54] with many stripes he knew better and
[47:57] didn't do it
[47:58] someone who didn't know his Lord's will
[48:01] yet still did commit things worthy of
[48:03] stripes
[48:04] shall be beaten with few stripes
[48:09] there is Judgment according to work it's
[48:12] not everybody getting the same
[48:15] Eternal punishment there'll be judgment
[48:16] according to works for unto whomsoever
[48:18] much is given of him shall be much
[48:21] required
[48:23] and then Matthew 11 21-24 Jesus Christ
[48:26] out woe unto the courage and woe unto
[48:28] thee bethsaida and capernaumi includes
[48:30] in the next verses for if the mighty
[48:32] Works which had been done in you which
[48:33] were done in you had but an entire
[48:35] Insight on they would have repented long
[48:38] ago in sackcloth and Ashes but I say
[48:41] unto you it shall be more tolerable for
[48:42] tire and sidon at the day of judgment
[48:44] than for you
[48:46] God's a just judge he will make a
[48:49] difference in judgment
[48:50] and that can be lost sometimes
[48:53] in this idea of there being an eternal
[48:55] hell because everybody's burning for
[48:57] return you say yeah the Adolf Hitler
[48:59] might be burning a thousand degrees and
[49:01] you'll be burning at 400 degrees but
[49:03] is there really a difference there ever
[49:07] that the Biblical teaching does show
[49:09] that God is a just judge
[49:13] and lastly here a hell of eternal
[49:17] torment
[49:18] or you the this torture this physical
[49:21] sensible torture that you would that you
[49:24] actually sense in the sense that you're
[49:25] feeling it that's inconsistent with
[49:27] God's revelation of his own Justice
[49:31] because how can something
[49:33] being done in 70 years of time
[49:36] how can it be just
[49:38] for crimes could be over 70 years of
[49:40] time be punished for all
[49:43] eternity
[49:44] that just it's like that's Overkill it
[49:47] can't be I can see Zeus doing that he's
[49:51] right I'm going to get I'm going to make
[49:52] you hate life I'm going to make you go
[49:54] over this every day Zeus would do that
[49:56] but not adjust God an exodus
[50:00] if any Mischief follows that you will
[50:04] give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for
[50:07] tooth hand for hand foot for foot
[50:09] burning for burning wound for a wound
[50:12] strike for a stripe this is
[50:14] proportionality
[50:16] punishment fits crime punishment fits
[50:18] crime but you have a terrible life lots
[50:22] of bad things being done in a short
[50:24] amount of time but to say that that all
[50:26] of a sudden is worthy of
[50:28] Eternal punishment I think it kind of
[50:30] flies in the face of what God reveals
[50:32] about himself and what real Justice is
[50:35] here in the book of Exodus
[50:38] so brother brother branham's teaching if
[50:41] we kind of contrast now
[50:43] um at the bottom of page six eternal
[50:45] life versus the idea of
[50:47] eternal hell brother brand name is
[50:49] teaching against eternal hell he's it's
[50:52] all about eternal life he's focusing all
[50:54] of our attention what is eternal life
[50:55] That's the basis of what this is
[50:57] anything that is created had the
[50:59] beginning and by definition it can't be
[51:02] Eternal only that which had no beginning
[51:03] can't have no end but like I said this
[51:07] is more an argument from logic
[51:10] there's just one form of eternal life
[51:13] that's God's life and God's life's
[51:15] indestructible
[51:17] he's the only one who has immortality
[51:19] it's indestructible
[51:21] Hebrews 7 verse 16 uh or um who is
[51:26] Christ is Melchizedek is made not after
[51:29] the law of a carnal commandment after
[51:31] the power of an endless
[51:33] indissoluble indestructible life
[51:37] what do we get when we get Christ's life
[51:39] inside of us
[51:41] or the invincibles who are
[51:43] indestructible Satan can throw whatever
[51:44] he wants to at us but we have the power
[51:47] of an endless life indestructible life
[51:50] inside of us
[51:53] in the what um what blesses me the most
[51:55] is we kind of close here musicians you
[51:58] can kind of kind of commit work work
[52:00] your way up
[52:01] um
[52:05] if we just have the idea if you're going
[52:07] to live somewhere forever
[52:09] if you live a bad life you'll be forever
[52:11] in a bad place if you live a good life
[52:13] will be forever in a good place
[52:15] that makes eternal life
[52:18] all focused about
[52:20] real estate location location location
[52:24] but that's not the focus of the Bible's
[52:26] teaching of eternal life but the Brand's
[52:28] Focus the Bible's focus is not location
[52:31] not our works but the focus is Jesus
[52:35] Christ God's life
[52:37] brother Branham says when he's talking
[52:40] about just at the bond of page seven
[52:42] from this is from the church age book
[52:44] page 146. there might be those who say
[52:47] eternal life signifies the welfare of
[52:50] the children of God it's their welfare
[52:52] and enjoyment that's at stake on the
[52:55] other hand The Sinner goes to his
[52:56] punishment so that we could reduce the
[52:58] second death to a matter of punishment
[53:01] and place eternal life just means Heaven
[53:04] Eternal punishment means Hell location
[53:06] location but you know what that does it
[53:09] makes
[53:11] eternal life a matter of geography
[53:15] instead of a person
[53:17] eternal life is God the Lord Jesus
[53:20] Christ we're not working
[53:21] to do good work so we can have a mansion
[53:25] on the hilltop someday the mansion's not
[53:27] our Focus
[53:28] our focus is Christ in John 17 says
[53:33] this is life eternal
[53:36] that they might Know Thee the only true
[53:39] God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent
[53:42] so I like how we talked about the idea
[53:45] of an eternal defaulty of there being an
[53:47] eternal hell this is a loose end because
[53:49] it's not rooted in Christ it's not
[53:51] directly tied to Christ the brother
[53:53] Branham brings us right back
[53:55] eternal life is not geography it's not
[53:57] about place it's not about the
[53:58] mainstream the hilltop as opposed to a
[54:00] burning fire in hell it's about knowing
[54:03] god knowing Christ that is eternal life
[54:09] eternal life is just knowing and being
[54:12] in Jesus Christ and what they what a
[54:15] wonderful opportunity we have to to have
[54:18] that
[54:19] so I I trust we have a greater value for
[54:22] for God and his word and the truth
[54:25] that's it's what we believe is anchored
[54:27] in the scripture and not just in the
[54:29] scripture it's anchored in the very
[54:30] nature of God hope we can see God's
[54:32] heart that he's not uh not uh this is
[54:36] like this Pagan God Zeus with
[54:37] Thunderbolts waiting to to to the judges
[54:40] and we're all going in heaven going to
[54:42] have look over and have this sadistic
[54:44] Glee and seeing people being being
[54:46] punished no the hell was created for the
[54:48] devil and his angels not for anybody
[54:51] else that's why Jesus came
[54:54] let's pray
[54:58] heavenly father I thank you Lord for the
[55:00] gift that you give us of
[55:03] eternal life Lord and I just want us to
[55:06] take a moment and and be aware of the
[55:10] awesome gift that we have even to be in
[55:12] a church this evening and to experience
[55:15] your presence and I just if someone's
[55:18] here and says no I've I've been perhaps
[55:20] I've been raised in church if maybe I
[55:23] haven't I don't know but I've I've
[55:25] resisted
[55:26] the pull of God in my heart for too long
[55:28] I want to stop doing that because
[55:31] I want to know Jesus Christ
[55:35] that's what Christ came here he did not
[55:37] come to condemn anyone
[55:40] to judgment he came that we might be
[55:42] saved if you wanted to share his nature
[55:44] and his life
[55:47] with us
[55:50] and if the Lord's pulling on your heart
[55:52] I just pray that you'd open it
[55:54] and accept his life inside of you
[55:58] because if you've got that there's no
[56:00] way you'll ever come up short
[56:03] you'll be with him in this life
[56:05] you'll skip over all that region of the
[56:07] Lost you'll go right into his presence
[56:10] if we die before the Rapture and they'll
[56:12] be just waiting they'll be caught up
[56:14] into his presence
[56:16] and Lord I just pray you'd come quick
[56:17] because we can call directly into your
[56:19] presence Lord I pray that you'd be with
[56:20] each one Lord I Thank you for your for
[56:22] your truth
[56:24] for this restoration of this truth o God
[56:26] in Jesus name amen
