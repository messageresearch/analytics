[0:48] but that will just take you so far
[0:51] I want to get as close as as he wants me
[0:54] to get actually
[0:55] because he wants you to walk with him

[1:12] morning amen so let us read from
[1:17] from Brother Bradham shalom 64.

[1:23] I don't know what is okay you got my
[1:26] notes

[1:31] oh wow

[1:38] you the wrong notes
[1:41] maybe that's not the beginning yet
[1:47] okay it's something what's going to go
[1:49] wrong it's going to go wrong don't worry
[1:51] about it we're going to make mistakes
[1:52] we're going to make errors so just
[1:54] apologize that I know I'm going to make
[1:57] mistakes okay beforehand and I
[1:59] apologizing that beforehand okay
[2:02] New Year's New Year
[2:05] what about it bring what new hopes he
[2:08] says we are one year closer
[2:11] we are one day closer than we were
[2:15] yesterday he says we are one hour closer
[2:19] than we were when I started he says 15
[2:23] years ago
[2:24] 15 minutes to 11.
[2:27] it's 15 till 12 now
[2:30] we are one hour closer we don't and we
[2:33] don't look back
[2:35] we look forward see
[2:38] last time I checked uh
[2:41] what would I he said 15 years when I
[2:43] started in the message so when God
[2:45] called me to the message
[2:47] it was uh
[2:49] uh in those days I'm talking about maybe
[2:52] 60 years well this is this has been
[2:54] written about 60 years but brother Brown
[2:56] says 15 minutes when I started in the
[2:59] semester 30 years ago we were three
[3:02] minutes
[3:03] to you know you know the atomic Cloud
[3:05] that they keep track of you know the
[3:07] apocalyptic things we work three minutes
[3:09] to midnight that's what brought about
[3:12] 15.
[3:13] so that was 20 years ago you know where
[3:15] we are today
[3:18] seconds
[3:20] you know they updated the clock
[3:23] to 30 to 90 seconds so I think it is
[3:25] even who knows even less than that how
[3:29] close we are
[3:31] I mean the scientists said that's how
[3:33] close we are and you and me know and I
[3:36] know that that's how close we are
[3:37] because when all these things start
[3:39] happening look up because your
[3:41] Redemption is near
[3:43] amen
[3:45] so
[3:47] let us pray right quick and then we get
[3:49] into our message Father we thank you
[3:51] once again for this opportunity that we
[3:53] have to
[3:54] to father to stand here father I'm here
[3:57] present father to in my postal Duty
[4:01] father we want you to to come father we
[4:05] want to and we love your presence this
[4:07] morning Father that's what we come
[4:09] father we we love to be around you and
[4:12] your presence and your people father and
[4:15] now I ask you father that I will get out
[4:17] of the way father what I want you to
[4:19] come and you take control father and you
[4:22] speak to your children through this
[4:24] verse of Father by we ask you these
[4:26] things and granted father be be with
[4:29] those that are traveling back from the
[4:31] meeting father uh keep and protect and
[4:34] cover them uh that the Angels who will
[4:38] will bring them and remove any obstacle
[4:41] that Satan wants to put in a way foreign
[4:45] father we love you we thank you and we
[4:48] appreciate you for in the name of Jesus
[4:51] Christ we ask you all these things amen
[4:53] and amen
[4:55] so in order to
[4:57] talk about closer you can sit down I'm
[5:00] sorry
[5:01] I already apologize for all my mistakes
[5:05] so I don't have to
[5:07] you know you guys think this is easy I
[5:11] might make it look easy but it's not
[5:12] easy
[5:13] I can never get adjusted you know every
[5:16] time I come to preach I get nervous
[5:18] I'm glad because if I would get adjusted
[5:20] then I get worried
[5:22] if it gets comfortable and normal then
[5:24] you know you'll be habitual you know I
[5:28] could worry about it but I'm glad
[5:30] I get nervous because then I have to
[5:32] depend on the law to give me peace and
[5:35] strength
[5:37] and gave me wisdom to do what I need to
[5:39] do
[5:40] because it's his work anyway so closer
[5:44] closer walk with God
[5:48] closer walk in 2023 is what I want this
[5:51] is the first day and we're starting you
[5:54] know the right way in church
[5:56] bye
[5:58] what what a better way to start a year
[6:01] but in church communion with God giving
[6:04] God the first fruit the first of the
[6:06] year
[6:07] he can have it in fact you know we are
[6:11] close
[6:13] and closer and we are even closer than
[6:16] you think we are to the coming of the
[6:18] Lord actually you know we've seen all
[6:21] the things going in the world you know
[6:22] the chaos and and all these things
[6:25] happening in wars and rumors of war and
[6:29] pestilences I mean I never knew I mean
[6:32] I'm 73 right now and I have gone through
[6:36] some hurricanes in Portugal and I have
[6:37] got some epidemics too you know what's
[6:40] the field that killed people but I never
[6:43] thought that after I grew up when I was
[6:45] 73 I was going to see a pandemic I never
[6:47] seen one not this close but I mean there
[6:50] were some other places that happened in
[6:52] my times
[6:53] but I mean this is close
[6:56] finally I can say that I lived and made
[7:00] it through a pandemic and I thank the
[7:02] Lord because he saw the Lord that keep
[7:05] us he's our healer you know he's the one
[7:07] that lead us on garos in all things
[7:10] but these are getting I mean listen it's
[7:13] not going to get better from here on
[7:16] don't sit there and think you know we
[7:18] are going to go back to normal normal is
[7:20] not longer here any longer
[7:22] what you and I knew with Norma is not
[7:25] here we might get to some normalities
[7:29] but it's not going to be what you and I
[7:30] used to know that's normal
[7:32] so now we don't know what to expect and
[7:35] I know one thing
[7:37] I'm only expecting the coming of the
[7:39] Lord
[7:40] because for now on things are not going
[7:42] any better
[7:44] so we need to prepare ourselves and get
[7:47] closer and move closer closer to him
[7:50] until we can disappear you know like
[7:53] Enoch
[7:54] he had such a close walk that he walked
[7:57] and he walked until what it was not
[8:00] because God took him that's what we need
[8:02] to do Focus ourselves to start walking
[8:04] closer and closer until one of these
[8:07] days he says okay come home
[8:10] that's what I'm looking forward
[8:11] everything else behind those are
[8:14] distractions what is going to happen is
[8:16] going to happen amen
[8:19] so
[8:20] how do we get closer to Jesus
[8:23] so I want to go to the letter of Paul
[8:27] that he wrote to the Philippians in
[8:29] chapter 3 but before we get there
[8:32] what I want you to know that the closer
[8:35] we get to God
[8:38] see through Jesus Christ
[8:41] then we get stronger
[8:44] I mean this might get weak but in my
[8:47] weakness that is where my strength is at
[8:50] because I'm not depending on my flesh
[8:53] see I'm depending on his strength so the
[8:56] joy of the Lord is my strength
[9:00] so The Closer I Get With God through
[9:02] Jesus the stronger the happier
[9:05] we become
[9:07] what we are facing life struggles when
[9:09] we face you know all the old deals that
[9:12] we that we Face we counted all Joy James
[9:15] says see the closer you get to God you
[9:18] know you are contempt like like Paul
[9:21] says it doesn't matter what I find
[9:23] myself raise your poor hungry with a lot
[9:26] or less or or this you know whatever
[9:29] situation he found himself he says I am
[9:31] contempt
[9:37] ugly terrible
[9:39] I am content because I know that
[9:41] wherever Satan throw at me
[9:44] all that evil that he wants to do to us
[9:47] God turned us to good
[9:49] because he said that he says you know
[9:51] all things were for good
[9:54] so let's say that whatever he wants to
[9:56] he cannot create any weapon
[9:59] that can destroy you you know that
[10:01] I don't care if it's cancer I don't care
[10:03] if it's coffee I don't care let it throw
[10:05] you anything in fact this year I thought
[10:07] Satan this morning you know
[10:09] ah I woke up this morning
[10:12] but he's faithful Satan is faithful than
[10:15] me it was all before me
[10:17] you know why he was waiting for me first
[10:19] of the year
[10:21] sometimes I think Satan is more faithful
[10:23] than a lot of Christians you know
[10:25] he was waiting for me already
[10:28] the beginning the first day the first
[10:30] hour of the year I mean this morning I
[10:33] was stressed out opposite stressed out
[10:35] you know
[10:37] because first I have a burden right now
[10:39] that I had to die on love you know
[10:42] plus you know
[10:44] we had the
[10:46] the children's with us you know Tina is
[10:48] and Kenny went to do their team that
[10:51] they need to do I told my wife this
[10:53] morning oh
[10:55] I had a bad memory this morning bad
[10:57] dreams
[10:58] I forgot what it is to take out three
[11:01] children
[11:03] I mean I forgot that I I mean we don't
[11:05] have children no more you know
[11:07] Hallelujah
[11:09] this morning I was stressed and now the
[11:12] kids getting ready they need to eat we
[11:14] need to go
[11:15] oh my goodness throw the trash Christy
[11:17] I'm just basically my wife is trying to
[11:19] cook and do something so we can eat
[11:21] after service oh my
[11:25] God and then I was I mean Satan was
[11:29] really you know trying to you know he
[11:31] don't he don't you know waste any time
[11:34] it's a good enemy
[11:37] you know so he was there so I had to
[11:40] stop
[11:40] oh my God I said you know Satan you know
[11:45] I know you got up early enough you know
[11:47] to wait for me
[11:49] but I'll tell you something you know
[11:51] Satan enough is enough
[11:54] this year you know I am just going to
[11:57] move forward and this year I'm only
[11:59] behind all that mistakes and all the
[12:01] errors that I made last year
[12:03] you know leaving all that behind and
[12:06] let's move forward now yesterday is gone
[12:10] we turn in a new chapter in New Year
[12:13] where the chapter is closed you know
[12:15] come back and read it again do you
[12:17] every time you open your book you don't
[12:19] say well let me go wait a minute I
[12:20] forgot I go back to chapter then you
[12:23] never get to you never get to move
[12:25] forward Because by the time you get to
[12:27] the before it's time to close and you
[12:29] know go
[12:31] so we closed the chapter last year
[12:34] whatever mistake we made wherever errors
[12:37] you committed whatever choices you did
[12:39] bad choices or whatever happened
[12:41] it's bad
[12:43] everybody said move forward
[12:46] because you cannot move forward until
[12:47] you close a chapter you cannot read
[12:50] another chapter until you close that
[12:51] chapter and if we're done with that
[12:53] chapter let's move to 2013 now I mean
[12:56] 23. we are moving forward not backwards
[13:01] you know we don't want to carry any
[13:02] weight
[13:04] it is hard as it is can you imagine
[13:05] carrying last year and then waiting for
[13:07] this year and the idea to come
[13:09] sorry
[13:11] that's gone
[13:12] whatever I did is Forgiven
[13:14] God don't remember
[13:17] and I don't want to remember amen
[13:20] so color all joy sometimes it's like you
[13:23] may you may not have certain you know
[13:27] this thing here we go
[13:30] I'm trying these new things I'm sorry
[13:33] uh certain sometimes sometimes when we
[13:37] are with ourselves at home or maybe we
[13:39] are in the car going somewhere we go
[13:42] camping you know sometimes you don't
[13:45] have uh someone to encourage you when
[13:47] you are down or depressed
[13:49] you know
[13:51] maybe the day girls are not around the
[13:53] pastor is not around you know no one is
[13:56] around to encourage you and help you
[13:58] but you see that is the time that you
[14:00] need to depend in God
[14:02] because God will never leave you God
[14:04] will never forsake you
[14:07] see and that is the time we need to walk
[14:09] closer to God and experience God in such
[14:12] a way that when we need help he's a hub
[14:15] you know in trouble times
[14:19] because sometimes you cannot get hold of
[14:21] your pastor to pray for you sometimes
[14:22] you can get hold to the Deacons
[14:24] you know but that is the time that you
[14:27] know that you know that you know God
[14:29] because you can speak to God
[14:31] you know
[14:33] you can enter in
[14:36] and tell him your troubles
[14:39] he already knows
[14:40] but you need to voice it he wants to
[14:43] hear you telling him
[14:45] he wants to do it but he wants you to
[14:47] talk to him to commune with him to
[14:50] fellowship with him this morning so
[14:53] that's why we need to get closer and
[14:55] closer until we become you know like a
[14:58] husband and a wife there's some intimacy
[15:01] you know that's close we have to get to
[15:04] him you know he wants that God wants
[15:07] your fellowship in fact God desires your
[15:10] fellowship that's why he make you and me
[15:13] from the very beginning he created us so
[15:15] he could have a family and he could have
[15:18] Fellowship God wants to walk with you
[15:21] God was a walk in you this morning
[15:24] because when there's no one else around
[15:28] that's when you know that you know that
[15:30] you know
[15:31] that you know him
[15:33] see that is the time
[15:35] and we had to walk that close and
[15:37] experience him in such a way
[15:40] that when we have a need we know that
[15:43] he's going to provide all our needs amen
[15:47] amen and we trust God
[15:50] that he's going to do that
[15:53] so
[15:55] when we go to through things in life
[15:59] we need to know that we have a good
[16:01] relationship just like a wife and a
[16:03] husband
[16:04] you know
[16:06] he's there to protect her he's there to
[16:08] keep her safe he's there to provide he's
[16:11] here to take care he's there to do that
[16:13] that the Bible said husband what
[16:17] love your wife
[16:20] see ask Christ love who
[16:23] the church
[16:24] that's a true call guys
[16:28] see and the wife said why why
[16:33] to your husband
[16:34] now I'm going to make a statement that
[16:36] might shake you a little bit
[16:38] husband your wife's gonna have to submit
[16:41] to you at all
[16:42] you should have went to
[16:44] you know why
[16:45] because it's not by force
[16:48] you cannot pressure you cannot demand
[16:50] for her because the Bible said uh you
[16:52] know don't
[16:54] the the way this work is
[16:57] you love her into submission
[17:00] like Jesus Christ loved you into
[17:02] submission you need to love your wife
[17:05] and your wife know if you love him you
[17:07] know that way
[17:08] you know I call a couple one day he says
[17:11] you know she says uh
[17:14] I she was kind of having some troubles
[17:17] here and there with the husband to do
[17:18] certain things I said this is easy
[17:20] ask your husband ask him this question
[17:24] do you love me as you love Jesus
[17:27] and sure he's going to say yes okay
[17:30] then can you take care of this for me
[17:34] now he cannot say no because he says I
[17:36] love you Jesus loved you
[17:39] all you have to remind your husband is
[17:42] that Jesus love you and he needs to love
[17:45] you just as Jesus loved the church
[17:47] and they come back off from that
[17:50] so listen we love God love us that way
[17:54] and we should love our wife the way that
[17:57] God Jesus loved the church amen why
[18:00] Sumit you know
[18:03] we love God not because he forced us to
[18:06] love God when did God force you to no he
[18:10] loved me first
[18:12] and that makes me to love him more
[18:15] because see take care of me he do all
[18:18] things for me he protected me he keeps
[18:20] me he coerced me he blessed me he
[18:22] provide for me
[18:24] that's what the husbands do why because
[18:27] he loved me
[18:30] so I in return what you think I want to
[18:32] do
[18:34] I want to love God the same way
[18:37] see not because I have to not because
[18:40] she have to it's because love constrains
[18:44] me
[18:45] to love her and she to submit to me so
[18:48] it's all a love walk okay it's all a
[18:52] love affair okay this walk is all A Love
[18:55] Affair
[18:56] and the closer the closer we get with
[18:58] God we want to enter in that Intimacy in
[19:01] that love affair you know that we want
[19:04] to do all we can because we want we love
[19:07] God
[19:08] this walk is a love affair
[19:13] and sometimes
[19:15] you know we we go through things that we
[19:18] don't understand
[19:19] sometimes we in this Walk of Life in
[19:22] this journey things happen and we don't
[19:24] have a reason why
[19:29] but it doesn't matter
[19:31] because we know that God
[19:35] knows we don't but he knows why he
[19:38] allowed certain things to come to our
[19:40] life he knows what he lets say that
[19:42] those brings certain things to our life
[19:45] so the only thing I know is that God is
[19:49] going
[19:50] to make things well for me in fact you
[19:54] know sometimes
[19:55] uh
[19:57] we see that
[20:00] after we go through any situation
[20:02] circumstances and we trust God to take
[20:05] us through that
[20:07] God sometimes don't tell your children's
[20:08] everything God don't tell the prophets
[20:10] everything sometimes we are wondering
[20:12] why why why
[20:15] but the Lord just says you know move on
[20:19] move on and trust me see this this work
[20:22] is also trust oh
[20:25] by faith walking with him so when we get
[20:28] to those places we trust God in
[20:31] everything that is happening to us
[20:33] even though he wouldn't understand why
[20:35] because God has something better for you
[20:37] at the end of that God is doing this for
[20:39] your own benefit and my benefit
[20:42] actually he's using Satan as a tool to
[20:45] shape you and to form you but we have to
[20:47] go through certain things in this world
[20:50] but after all is said and done you know
[20:53] one of the things I see that everything
[20:55] feeds and fall into place right away
[20:59] see all I had to do just be still away
[21:02] on the Lord
[21:04] let him do the barrel for me
[21:07] you know you don't have to be a stressed
[21:09] when you get through situation you walk
[21:12] in with God you don't stress out he's
[21:13] your husband
[21:15] and you know what happened don't get
[21:16] stressed just tell the devil I am
[21:19] blessed
[21:21] so you tell the devil you know uh
[21:23] I am the challenge you know I am the
[21:26] answer to your challenge when he comes
[21:28] this morning that's what I told him okay
[21:30] come on you know you know let's go
[21:32] because I am the answer to your
[21:34] challenge
[21:35] when he comes like a flood you know God
[21:38] raises a challenge a standard that's you
[21:40] and me
[21:42] so we know all that God is going to make
[21:44] everything good for us at least for our
[21:47] own benefit maybe you will not like what
[21:49] God had to put you through nevertheless
[21:51] he for your own good that God do what
[21:53] you do in this world so Philippians
[21:56] let's get to Philippe and then so how
[21:58] how we are going to get closer to Jesus
[22:00] than this year because that is my
[22:03] desire I want to get closer I want to
[22:06] get out of here I want I want I want to
[22:08] want to walk and walk with God I'm
[22:10] telling why until I'm no more no longer
[22:13] you don't see me anymore
[22:14] you know but if you don't see me you
[22:16] won't you know don't worry because we
[22:19] will see each other someplace else right
[22:20] not here don't get worried if you don't
[22:23] see me no you worry you just you don't
[22:26] see me next year what happened to me
[22:28] like I don't know that brother left nah
[22:30] we all living together
[22:32] okay
[22:33] now bro Paul says but what things were
[22:37] gained that Philippians 3 7
[22:39] what it will gain to me those accounting
[22:43] laws for Christ first thing
[22:46] then we start working process
[22:48] you know
[22:50] whatever he gained
[22:53] his former life you know he's from her
[22:55] life he was he was going to be a rabbi
[22:58] he studied I mean to be a a a teacher
[23:01] that's what a rabbi is I mean he was
[23:04] going to have have phds and ddls but
[23:07] what what happened to all that education
[23:10] what happened to those that
[23:12] intellectualism
[23:13] well one man dies
[23:16] he produces a dead man you don't produce
[23:19] life intellectual education you cannot
[23:22] say God that produce death
[23:24] the only thing that can produce God of
[23:27] life is the word of God and that's it
[23:31] Stephen
[23:32] was
[23:34] you know stoned to death Paul was there
[23:37] he incarcerated the Christians
[23:40] that's all you know intellectually she
[23:43] can produce
[23:44] look at Moses what did he Moses produce
[23:46] with all his intellect and all his
[23:48] intelligence and the second one in
[23:49] command in Egypt
[23:52] from the Pharaoh what he produced one
[23:55] then man
[23:57] see that's the first thing I don't want
[24:00] my thoughts I don't want my ideas in the
[24:03] matter
[24:04] I don't want your thought and I don't
[24:06] want your idea all I want is his thought
[24:08] and his ideas in anything in my life
[24:13] Paul says that is the first thing when
[24:15] you start walking with God you know
[24:17] might as well forget it but you think
[24:20] you know because we don't know he knows
[24:23] all things he knows what's best for me
[24:26] he gave me the holy spirit so he can
[24:29] lead me and guide me not for me to
[24:31] decide what I'm going to do and what I'm
[24:32] going to do I want to be led just like a
[24:35] lamb I want to be guided that's what I
[24:37] my husband do he take me and he lead me
[24:42] he's not going to leave me in trouble
[24:43] you know like he says a blind following
[24:46] a blind
[24:47] and then they both falling in a hole
[24:49] we're not following nothing blindly we
[24:51] know what we follow we know this is the
[24:53] truth we know this is what God intended
[24:56] this is the light of the hour this
[24:58] message
[24:59] I'm not going crazy and if I'm going
[25:01] crazy leave me alone I'm happy
[25:04] you know
[25:05] this walk supposed to be happy work
[25:09] this works supposed to be a walk that
[25:12] that fulfilled
[25:15] unsatisfied you know just like Paul my
[25:18] former life did not satisfy me at all I
[25:20] thought it was temporary
[25:22] you know another one about because I Try
[25:26] by myself didn't work out I made too
[25:29] many mistakes
[25:33] you know I don't want the life
[25:35] we cannot serve Mammon
[25:37] and God we have to choose this year who
[25:41] are we going to move forward with
[25:43] if you find yourself
[25:45] walking and doing things if you find
[25:48] yourself coming to church and you
[25:50] finding yourself coming in Wednesday
[25:52] Sundays you're finding yourself doing
[25:54] the same thing every day in the same way
[25:56] the same
[25:58] uh you know doing it the same way
[26:01] and then nothing is
[26:03] and you're not moving forward
[26:06] then
[26:07] we need a change
[26:09] because when we come to church well we
[26:12] pray when we read the Bible when when we
[26:15] do all these things something has to
[26:17] change
[26:19] because he promised me he said he will
[26:21] be Transform Me and that's what I want I
[26:24] want to change I'm tired of Eli
[26:27] I am really tired of this guy
[26:30] no
[26:32] but he says he promised me that he would
[26:35] change me you know from glory to glory
[26:38] to glory that means that it's not a
[26:40] one-time deal or obviously the Holy
[26:42] Ghost 40 years ago praise the Lord but
[26:44] what is God doing for you today
[26:46] if that's all it is and you're coming to
[26:48] church and that's all you are then you
[26:50] will never move forward from there you
[26:52] know when we come to church and we read
[26:54] about us every day from this first day
[26:57] every day we need to be moving forward
[27:00] and if you find yourself doing the same
[27:02] thing the same way all the time and
[27:04] nothing happening
[27:06] you need a change
[27:09] and God has to answer for that change
[27:13] that's why we come to church
[27:15] so guys can shape us they work on models
[27:18] the word can take away all the things
[27:20] that is not God and it starts showing me
[27:23] what God is
[27:24] you know the world got come forward and
[27:26] you can see a glimpse of God and when
[27:29] you see God you can see yourself in him
[27:31] that's why the whole thing about this
[27:34] war the more you know him the more you
[27:37] know him the more you love him the more
[27:39] you know yourself
[27:41] when I was in the world I didn't know
[27:43] what I was I didn't know who I was
[27:46] but when I came to Jesus finally I know
[27:49] who I am
[27:50] I know what I am and I know where I'm
[27:53] going before I didn't know I was just
[27:55] lost
[27:56] in the world and everything decision I
[27:58] made every choice
[28:01] you know and he had no guarantee
[28:04] some came out good in fact at least one
[28:06] of it came out good
[28:08] I married my wife
[28:12] and I think that God has something to do
[28:14] with that even though I wasn't walking
[28:16] in his will
[28:17] but that's the choice that will that I
[28:21] would like to do again if I had to
[28:23] repeat it I would marry my wife again I
[28:25] got no complaints you know after being
[28:28] 40 some years married 46 whatever we're
[28:30] going to
[28:32] you know and that is the walk with the
[28:33] Lord
[28:34] every day you know we sing that little
[28:36] song you know the love of Jesus you know
[28:40] tomorrow is better than today
[28:43] you know I cannot wait for tomorrow
[28:46] because tomorrow's going to get better
[28:47] sister see that is what we need to look
[28:51] forward
[28:52] you know if we are stressed and
[28:54] depressed let's let's we need a change
[28:56] we need to now look we need to fix our
[29:00] eyes and that goal in Christ Jesus let's
[29:03] move forward this year because I know he
[29:06] wants to bless you
[29:08] but God is waiting for who you know
[29:11] sometimes we think we're waiting for God
[29:13] to see no God is waiting on you and me
[29:16] but if I said the Rapture is overdue
[29:18] because it's waiting for us to get ready
[29:20] I think this is a year that we need to
[29:22] start moving and getting ready for that
[29:25] Rapture you know God has a lot of things
[29:27] for us this year God wants to bless you
[29:30] God wants to bless this church God has
[29:32] things that the eyes and ears are never
[29:35] heard and I can never see not even can
[29:38] you imagine what God has prepared for
[29:40] the children's
[29:43] but you need to go and get it
[29:46] God already gave it to you it's yours
[29:50] you know Joy like Joshua and Caleb
[29:53] let's get it it is our he promised to us
[29:57] it's already yours healing is yours this
[30:01] morning just for the asking and
[30:03] believing whatever you have need this
[30:06] morning you can have if two can agree
[30:09] concerning anything
[30:11] you know and believe you can have it
[30:13] this morning and we don't have more than
[30:15] two people here
[30:17] okay
[30:18] he said that whatever two or three
[30:21] together he will be here his presence is
[30:24] here
[30:26] and I want to get close to that presence
[30:28] I want to get close enough I'm going to
[30:31] be refreshed this morning
[30:33] y'all don't want to come to church to
[30:35] live the same way I came in I want to be
[30:37] refreshed I want to be alive I'm going
[30:40] to be happy you know some people come to
[30:42] church and they think it's boring
[30:45] well you don't know the Jesus that I
[30:48] know
[30:49] that's not a boring moment
[30:51] see I want to come to church and I want
[30:54] to live different
[30:55] every time I come to church every day on
[30:59] this walk this year every time I come I
[31:01] don't want to be the same person that
[31:03] comes into this church
[31:05] maybe you don't notice the CH the change
[31:07] because
[31:08] it's gradually you know Progressive
[31:11] and you see everybody just about every
[31:14] week
[31:15] so you know just like your children when
[31:17] they start growing up you know they come
[31:19] to you man I think I I think I got
[31:21] taller come on then you go to the wall
[31:24] and make a mark next next five minutes I
[31:27] think back to you know why well you can
[31:31] see it because you are there within 24 7
[31:33] and you can see their progress but I see
[31:37] you maybe once a year
[31:39] so I noticed a change but you don't
[31:42] because you see each other just about
[31:44] every week and whatever you're seeing is
[31:46] so gradually that you think nothing is
[31:48] happening but I'm telling you today
[31:49] something is happening in this church in
[31:53] you
[31:53] maybe you cannot perceive it but it's
[31:56] happening
[31:58] it is happening
[31:59] God will bless you
[32:01] just continue
[32:03] so
[32:06] we want to walk closer and we want to
[32:10] walk deeper not just closer deeper we
[32:14] want to get deeper that's what you know
[32:16] did he went all the way in until he was
[32:21] no longer seen one of these days I want
[32:24] to walk So Close That You Don't See Eli
[32:27] any longer I want people to see Christ
[32:29] in me
[32:31] it's what I want to
[32:33] impossible no it's not impossible
[32:36] for God is not that impossible
[32:39] and for you if you can't believe
[32:40] anything nothing is impossible for you
[32:42] neither things are possible you can
[32:44] believe this morning
[32:45] listen my friend
[32:48] they confused brother Branham with
[32:50] Christ yes or no
[32:52] how many people have confused you with
[32:54] Christ
[32:55] but I'll be honest not yet
[32:58] do I want to be there sure
[33:01] I want to have the same work that
[33:03] brother brother had to the point that
[33:05] people confused them with Christ and
[33:07] they started baptizing in his in his
[33:10] name why that's how close he was walking
[33:13] with God that he no longer you cannot
[33:15] even long and see brother Branham but
[33:18] you surprised the manifestation of
[33:20] Christ
[33:21] in him
[33:22] that's how close
[33:24] I want to walk what about you
[33:27] do you want to set it for Less
[33:29] after he has given us just about
[33:31] everything he gave himself he became
[33:34] flesh he died for us what else do you
[33:36] want him to do
[33:38] he gave his life for me I want to give
[33:41] mine for him
[33:43] does that mean I have to die out and let
[33:46] him
[33:46] manifest himself through me
[33:49] you need to give God
[33:51] that Liberty
[33:53] God wants you to give you the freedom to
[33:55] do that God would not impose
[33:58] if you don't want to if God is not going
[34:00] to make you
[34:01] this has to be a free choice
[34:04] you got to make the choice
[34:06] God have your way
[34:09] this year from now on have you're in
[34:12] everything that I do
[34:14] lead me and guide me
[34:16] because I want the word brother Brown
[34:18] said the only place that this world is
[34:21] going to see Jesus is well
[34:23] in between you guys
[34:25] because this is it
[34:28] this is what he is right now in New in
[34:31] you and you in me
[34:33] see his name whatever I put my name what
[34:35] is his name at in you in you in Jesus
[34:38] Christ he knew the Holy Ghost it's not a
[34:41] day any longer
[34:43] and the only place they're going to see
[34:44] it is what he knew when you go to work
[34:46] when you go to school what are they
[34:49] seeing
[34:52] walk
[34:53] closer this year closer until you and
[34:58] him can become
[34:59] one and that's what the Bible says about
[35:03] wife and husbands
[35:05] it's a mystery Paul says they become
[35:07] what
[35:09] I want to become one with him until I
[35:11] can completely disappear in him
[35:15] my wife used to tell me
[35:17] you know when we marry and you know
[35:19] honeymoons and all this stuff
[35:23] die out
[35:25] it might slow down but it hasn't died
[35:27] out
[35:29] I mean you know you get older anyway
[35:32] but the point that I'm making is she
[35:34] used to tell me I like to you know
[35:37] completely just get inside you you know
[35:40] when we used to embrace it
[35:42] um just so you can take me everywhere
[35:44] you go I can be with you all the time I
[35:48] just like to squeeze myself in you
[35:50] and that's how I'm feeling about Christ
[35:53] I want to walk so close that I want to
[35:55] squeeze myself that's what he wants
[35:57] anyways
[35:59] that is what he won but he's waiting on
[36:03] you and me to make a decision to forsake
[36:06] everything like Paul
[36:07] everything
[36:10] so he can have preeminence
[36:12] in our bodies in our minds in our spirit
[36:15] in our life in our families
[36:18] he wants to have first place
[36:21] in everything
[36:22] so then people can see him and no longer
[36:25] you
[36:25] see because you are manifesting that
[36:28] Spirit of Christ amen so intimacy let me
[36:32] let me just
[36:34] can be using this word around intimacy
[36:37] and a simple way that I can explain it
[36:41] in a simple way and it's a simple word
[36:43] anyway
[36:44] closeness
[36:46] see closeness is is intimacy
[36:51] you know it's kinship you know is is
[36:55] when somebody is a relationship that is
[36:58] hard to Heart they call him you know
[37:00] like David this is a good example
[37:04] God testified that was God testimony not
[37:07] man testifier of David and what he says
[37:10] he said man after what my own heart
[37:15] you know I like to have that testimony
[37:16] this morning I like to hear those who
[37:19] are from God Eli he said man after my
[37:22] own heart I mean I'm gonna do all his
[37:24] will and everything that he requires I
[37:27] want to fulfill all his desires
[37:30] because that's what Debbie did that's
[37:31] what he thought of him that this man
[37:34] will do and carry out everything that
[37:36] God will tell you and he did
[37:38] but I want to be that I want I want to
[37:40] hear if I don't hear that I want to hear
[37:41] that day you know it says oh good I'm
[37:44] faithful
[37:45] you know servant come
[37:47] at least those words
[37:49] that I was faithful
[37:51] I was faithful to his word I was
[37:54] faithful in everything that I did
[37:56] I was faithful to church I was faithful
[37:59] to everybody I was faithful to him you
[38:02] know God is faithful
[38:04] God will never fail you whatever he
[38:07] promised he will do it
[38:09] you and I can fall and can fail but he
[38:13] cannot fail
[38:14] and whatever he says he will fulfill in
[38:16] you if you're his children's and he
[38:19] called you and he failed you he started
[38:21] the word and he will finish it he cannot
[38:24] lie to me
[38:25] but I gotta put myself in there and that
[38:28] question
[38:28] you cannot sit down and just wait until
[38:31] one day with a little magic what you
[38:34] done you done
[38:35] that's not how it works it's a
[38:37] progressive walk
[38:39] then you have to make decisions
[38:41] Jesus had to make a decision
[38:44] he had a choice
[38:47] can this call pass that is another way
[38:49] we can you know when I have to go to the
[38:51] cross
[38:52] and what was the answer
[38:55] well the answer must have been no
[38:57] because he says that will be done then
[39:01] and that's what we want sometimes you
[39:02] know you know sometimes we want to make
[39:04] choices before you make any choices even
[39:07] though you wanted to do that you want to
[39:09] do you need that
[39:10] talk to God
[39:12] because he has a perfect
[39:15] I don't my choice I will fail but he has
[39:19] a perfect
[39:21] word he's perfect and he will never fail
[39:24] you so ask him Lord
[39:27] if this is okay or can I do this
[39:31] just like Jesus says can I
[39:33] no this is mine and he chose what
[39:37] to do God's will
[39:39] than doing his will another thing we
[39:42] need to do
[39:43] you know sometimes we want a lot of
[39:45] things we don't need them we want to do
[39:48] a lot of things we don't need them but
[39:49] one thing we can do
[39:51] whatever he bet us to do whatever his
[39:53] will is this year from day one that's
[39:57] what I want to do
[39:58] because that is how you walk closer to
[40:01] him that is how you please God you know
[40:04] that is how God you know uh you get
[40:07] closer to him and you can please him as
[40:10] well and you can do his desire
[40:12] no
[40:16] but we knew that because Jesus had a
[40:18] choice sometimes he didn't have no
[40:21] choice he did have a choice he could
[40:22] marry if he wanted to you know that
[40:23] romance said he couldn't marry her
[40:24] children the family boy he Sanctified
[40:26] himself for what for you and me
[40:31] and you and I we need to do the same
[40:33] thing
[40:34] we need to sacrifice certain things
[40:36] sometimes
[40:37] you know sometimes we make excuses
[40:41] anyway well I don't want to I don't I
[40:43] don't well let me get in the subject
[40:44] anyway I don't want to go to church I'm
[40:46] tired I'm this and that and the devil
[40:49] can come and he can just you know push
[40:51] buttons
[40:53] I know you tired last night we went to
[40:55] sleep late
[40:57] another Asana you know uh we said all
[41:00] kind of commotional fireworks and Banks
[41:02] everywhere and I went to sleep late we
[41:04] all went to sleep late
[41:07] I have excuse I'm gonna stay home
[41:10] but you know I want to be here
[41:13] because that is his will this morning
[41:14] that whatever he had I will be here with
[41:17] him with you guys with the body you know
[41:19] this is a body movement this is not just
[41:22] a one-man show
[41:28] foreign
[41:29] closeness
[41:32] so that is the simple meaning of the
[41:34] word intimacy close
[41:37] Heart to Heart Walk
[41:40] so this morning
[41:42] continue looking at that let's go to the
[41:45] next uh
[41:46] verse a it say you doubles and I count
[41:49] all things by laws for the Excellency
[41:52] see
[41:54] all things are lost

[42:47] people like to be there and they're
[42:48] present look at after this last the
[42:50] queen dying now we have a different I

[42:59] more famous than cry for them
[43:01] you know
[43:02] they hold her like you know like cheese
[43:06] some kind of a goddess let me say it
[43:08] that way
[43:09] you know but Christ
[43:12] for you and me that is what we want to
[43:14] hold Christ in our life the Excellency
[43:18] of Christ the privilege that we have to
[43:21] to to worship him you know that's
[43:23] priceless I don't know why people
[43:26] I want you to understand this I want
[43:28] people to understand those that are
[43:29] listening you know it is it is a
[43:33] privilege to worship God it's a
[43:35] privilege to come to church it's a
[43:37] privilege
[43:39] that we come together as a body you know
[43:42] it's a privilege
[43:44] you see I said I can't all think love
[43:46] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[43:49] Christ Jesus
[43:51] see the more we know him the more you
[43:53] know him the more you love him
[43:56] see that's what the work is all about
[43:58] the more we know him the more you love
[44:01] him
[44:02] see for the knowledge not mental
[44:05] knowledge not education not intellectual
[44:08] the knowledge of who the more you know
[44:10] of him the more you know of you
[44:13] in the beginning what happened to Adam
[44:16] well when when she came out on his side
[44:19] you know Eve
[44:21] you think Eve knew everything
[44:23] she was like a little baby isn't this
[44:26] with nothing the sponge you know the
[44:28] brain was empty
[44:30] who had to explain her who she was
[44:34] who had to explain her while she was
[44:37] doing there
[44:38] who had to explain her
[44:40] what was what God Said
[44:44] the husband
[44:46] she told her who she was now I shall
[44:48] call you what
[44:49] woman
[44:51] but that was him
[44:53] all the animals came he named all the
[44:56] animals he knew because God was in in
[44:59] him he was a son of God
[45:02] she was born out of his side and he has
[45:06] to tell them everything who she was what
[45:09] she was how to do things where we going
[45:12] and what we needed to do
[45:14] Christ did the same thing with for you
[45:16] and me I was lost one time and then I
[45:19] became a baby in Christ I don't even
[45:21] know anything
[45:22] who told me
[45:24] who inspired me
[45:26] who shows me who gave me a revelation of
[45:29] the knowledge who he is because as long
[45:32] as I know who he is I know who I am
[45:33] because I came out of him
[45:36] and that was Adam responsibility and
[45:39] this is your responsibility husband to
[45:41] show your family your wife your children
[45:43] who they are not only by
[45:46] speaking but also by showing
[45:50] see you are God to your family
[45:54] and that's the only God they're going to
[45:56] see your children is you because you're
[45:58] going to tell if God said God said God
[46:00] said and then they keep an eye on you to
[46:02] see what are you going to do so
[46:05] you know you got to leave while you talk
[46:07] you got to walk your talk you've got
[46:09] like you said don't do that God is not
[46:12] interested or that or God will not want
[46:14] you to do that when they're looking at
[46:16] you and you're doing it
[46:19] you are God to your families
[46:23] and your responsibilities to train your
[46:25] kids just like that I'm trained they
[46:28] were in the way they should go
[46:30] amen and the more you love them the more
[46:33] you want to see them going the right way
[46:36] amen
[46:38] and that was Adam at the beginning
[46:41] so Paul said Lord for the Excellency of
[46:45] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord so
[46:49] this this knowledge is it's not a
[46:51] one-time thing this is like I said it's
[46:53] Progressive that's why we come to church
[46:56] so we can learn more more and more see
[46:59] or who God is so you and I can then look
[47:04] at the mirror of the world and see
[47:06] yourself in the in that word I said
[47:08] that's what I am that's who I am the
[47:11] more you know him the more you see of
[47:12] him the more you know who you are that's
[47:15] what happened to Eve
[47:16] see a new husband the more they see
[47:19] Jesus in you the more you love them and
[47:23] the more they want us to meet
[47:26] we don't make him we don't force him we
[47:30] don't press them we love them into it
[47:32] that's what Jesus did to you guys in the
[47:34] beginning
[47:36] so
[47:38] progressively we become more
[47:41] more deeply in love
[47:43] with God not only with God but with his
[47:47] people
[47:48] because you can say I love God God on me
[47:52] are tight like this
[47:54] but he says if you love God and you
[47:56] don't love your brother
[47:58] is what that's a lie
[48:01] because if you love your brother the way
[48:03] God loved you it will be a different
[48:05] story
[48:06] if you forgive all that the way he
[48:08] forgave you that's a different story
[48:11] because now you can now never forgive
[48:14] somebody unless you experience the
[48:15] Forgiveness of God if you have a spirit
[48:17] of forgiveness of God you will know how
[48:20] to forgive somebody because if God
[48:22] forgave you
[48:23] why wouldn't you forget somebody
[48:26] the same thing we love you cannot love
[48:28] someone unless you know what love is I
[48:31] Didn't Know What Love Is and then no at
[48:33] one time until
[48:36] he loved me first
[48:38] see my heart at the beginning Ezekiel
[48:41] says you know when I was out there and
[48:44] he came to me he had to change first
[48:46] what my heart I had a Stony heart
[48:50] you know what Stony heart means is it's
[48:52] a rock nothing was seen and nothing goes
[48:54] out
[48:55] that mean I don't care about you and I
[48:59] don't even care about myself that was
[49:00] one of my problems I was bitter with
[49:02] everybody with myself I didn't care
[49:05] and I don't care what nobody was said
[49:07] that's what I left home because nothing
[49:09] goes in
[49:10] and nothing goes out
[49:12] and I cannot even love myself with that
[49:14] kind of a heart so what is the first
[49:16] thing got to do
[49:18] you have to give you a heart of one of
[49:21] Flesh
[49:22] something that is tender something that
[49:24] he can mow something that you can love
[49:27] him and love yourself
[49:29] that is the first change that had to
[49:31] happen
[49:32] because you cannot love yourself how can
[49:34] you love others
[49:36] but if you said you love God then you
[49:38] gotta you have to love everybody
[49:40] listen to me
[49:42] what good it is for to love those that
[49:44] love you
[49:46] and you don't love the rest of them
[49:48] no I'm not complaining about you guys
[49:51] this is not a judgment you love me and
[49:53] I'm not from this congregation and
[49:55] that's what you had to do because you
[49:58] had to love everybody else like you love
[50:00] each other
[50:01] they say a lot that you have for this
[50:03] and then you have to treat the same
[50:05] person or everybody that come from
[50:06] another church
[50:08] with the same love it's just one oh it
[50:10] cannot change
[50:12] so God already bought you I've gave you
[50:15] a tender heart now he can deal with you
[50:18] you know now you can love yourself and
[50:20] you can love other and then the next
[50:22] thing is what
[50:24] he give you what a spirit a new spirit
[50:27] or he would change your spirit not it's
[50:29] not the Holy Spirit it is the spirit
[50:31] that you have in you because that's who
[50:33] you are
[50:34] in your spirit your mind you know your
[50:37] memory feelings emotion all that is who
[50:41] you are you will shape and more
[50:44] by the world at one time
[50:46] and all that you knew was that
[50:50] but God came to change God had to change
[50:52] your way of thinking
[50:54] God had to change the way you're looking
[50:55] God had to change the way you hear
[50:57] things now you have to go to a complete
[51:00] change
[51:01] because now things are different see
[51:05] now you can hear the word of God you can
[51:08] hear the the voice of God
[51:11] and then you have a different attitude
[51:13] towards his word towards his people
[51:15] towards church all that has to change
[51:18] before I didn't want to go to church I
[51:19] didn't go to church for years
[51:21] I was born in church but then after I
[51:23] was 18 not until about 10 years later
[51:27] but see God take care of that God
[51:29] changed my attitudes towards the church
[51:32] towards the people endorsing that is the
[51:35] second thing you know because I had a
[51:37] lot of thoughts and idea about what I
[51:39] thought it was right God had to change
[51:43] and what is the last thing he do
[51:45] once he gave you a new heart justify you
[51:48] and he sanctify you what is the next
[51:50] thing now he said I will give you new
[51:52] spirit
[51:53] now I will guide you now I will lead you
[51:56] now I will show you all things to come
[51:59] see that's what the Holy Ghost is to
[52:02] Mentor you through this process
[52:04] so we have to have the Holy Ghost if
[52:06] we're not there yet we need it if you
[52:08] want any change in your life you have to
[52:11] have the changer in you
[52:13] the Holy Spirit
[52:15] cannot do it cannot make it out there
[52:17] without him because he's stronger it's
[52:20] greater it's better than Satan that is
[52:23] outside
[52:24] and we have to have him because by
[52:26] myself oh but this message is so
[52:29] difficult it's so hard yes you try to
[52:31] leave it in the flesh it is hard I can
[52:33] agree with you
[52:35] but you better have to get out of the
[52:36] way and let him lead through you this
[52:39] message that's what he had done with me
[52:42] I don't have to try
[52:44] I don't because he says I started the
[52:46] work and I will finish it I'm trusting
[52:48] God that through the Holy Spirit he
[52:50] shaped me he moaned me for glory to
[52:52] glory you know what I need to do
[52:54] surrender
[52:57] surrender to God
[53:00] yield to God my members you know like
[53:03] Romans says
[53:07] we want to be transformed not conformed
[53:09] to the world I already conformed to the
[53:11] world one time to the Fashions of the
[53:13] world that didn't work I wanted to be
[53:15] transformed change by the renewing of
[53:18] what
[53:19] the way you thought the way you saw all
[53:21] that has to change
[53:23] see it becomes the Bible becomes new to
[53:25] you everything becomes new to you
[53:28] see intimacy
[53:30] Acts
[53:33] uh 13 22 I quoted that for you that was
[53:37] uh about David now
[53:39] first John 1 7 says but if we walk in
[53:42] the light
[53:45] we are really living and walking in him
[53:49] as he is in the light we will have one
[53:52] Fellowship
[53:54] through
[53:56] unbroken Fellowship not when we want to
[53:58] when we please or we like to we always
[54:01] have fellowship with one another
[54:04] see and the blood of Jesus Christ his
[54:07] son cleans us from all sins
[54:11] first John 1 20 if a man says I love God
[54:14] and headed his brother
[54:16] you know you say but I don't hate him
[54:18] yeah but you don't like him neither you
[54:20] know what that's called passes hey
[54:25] [Music]
[54:28] that's called passive age
[54:35] in fact anyway if if you want to
[54:38] bottom line you have to love your enemy
[54:42] so you don't have no way out
[54:44] even if that is your enemy it's not your
[54:47] brother you still have to love him
[54:49] the way you love the one next to you
[54:51] no difference
[54:54] because God don't have no respect of
[54:57] person I like you more than a God we all
[55:00] the same in his kingdom we cannot decide
[55:03] how we love you this much and I will
[55:04] love you
[55:06] you want God to do that with you
[55:10] God cannot do it because he cannot love
[55:12] you more and he cannot love you less
[55:15] we can
[55:16] do
[55:19] see we should have a consistent
[55:21] persistent love to everybody
[55:25] you know we should respect everybody
[55:27] even if they're sinners enemies
[55:31] even if they say four things even the
[55:34] Christians should even the judge you
[55:36] even if they say four things
[55:39] you should love them right
[55:41] because that's what God did to you
[55:45] so God is your feet your eyes your mouth
[55:48] your ear so you can go and love someone
[55:51] for him God put someone in my heart so I
[55:54] can love him the son says
[55:56] do you can love it through me
[55:59] that is how the work is going to be done
[56:01] let's quickly I don't even know how much
[56:03] time I got but anyway Philippians 3 9
[56:07] again and be found in him not having my
[56:10] own righteousness he says which is of
[56:13] the law that's what Paul was saying but
[56:15] that wish is through the Faith of Christ
[56:18] the righteousness which is of god by
[56:21] faith
[56:22] he said so the Bible tell us
[56:26] to seek the kingdom of God
[56:30] first right
[56:32] and all the other things sometimes we do
[56:35] it backwards but anyway
[56:37] let's seek God and his kingdom first
[56:41] so if the doors are open of this church
[56:43] what he says see the kingdom of God
[56:46] first
[56:47] I understand people get sick I
[56:49] understand vacation I'm not talking
[56:50] about that but if you hold in town and
[56:52] you're well
[56:54] okay we all get tired
[56:57] but the joy of the Lord is my strength
[56:59] you know I can come to that door
[57:01] depressed I can drag this guy to that
[57:03] door
[57:04] he gave me a hard time this morning but
[57:06] I'm going to drag him to church
[57:08] and I'm gonna tell this fled it is my
[57:10] time now
[57:12] I'm tired of you you made a mess of me
[57:15] the whole Wing you gave me a hard time
[57:16] now it's my time to give you a hard time
[57:18] now you sit down you shut up and wait
[57:21] until I'm done
[57:24] that's what you need to tell the flesh
[57:26] drag it to church I don't care if you
[57:28] don't feel funny you talk listen sit it
[57:31] down and said shut up
[57:34] it's my time
[57:37] right
[57:39] and then you start worshiping the Lord
[57:41] and before you know you forgot about the
[57:43] guy
[57:44] because he went to sleep
[57:47] I mean not you the guy
[57:50] that's Satan yeah Satan shut up
[57:54] you know
[57:55] I had enough for you
[57:57] this is my time to worship god this is
[58:00] my chance to to rise to Heavenly places
[58:03] in Jesus you stay there and don't even
[58:07] move I'm going up
[58:09] in the spirit I'm going to rise up
[58:12] because that is where you come you know
[58:14] that you cannot hear from God you can
[58:16] come to church if I mean in the flesh um
[58:18] We're All In the Flesh I Came In the
[58:20] Flesh
[58:21] don't stay in the flesh
[58:23] your spirit needs to rise up to Heavenly
[58:25] places because that is where he wants to
[58:27] talk to you
[58:29] if you don't rise up to that level
[58:32] you might just read the same way you
[58:34] came in
[58:35] so we need to just come to service you
[58:38] know let's be refreshed and let's just
[58:41] rise up to that level and let God give
[58:44] us peace Comfort whatever we we need
[58:48] Happiness joy all these things we can
[58:51] find in him
[58:52] he says
[58:54] rather he says which is our God faith so
[58:59] Jesus said
[59:00] he said to John the Baptist when he came
[59:03] down to the world he's coming down to
[59:05] the world to be baptized Jesus
[59:07] and then what did John said uh-uh I
[59:12] cannot do this I need to be baptized for
[59:14] you I mean I'm not even worthy to to
[59:17] even unless your your Sonos to take your
[59:20] shoes
[59:21] what did Jesus said
[59:24] it behooves to do what
[59:26] to fulfill everyone
[59:29] righteousness you know what
[59:30] righteousness is
[59:32] do the right things think the right
[59:35] things and do the right things you think
[59:36] Jesus needed to be baptized to receive
[59:38] the Holy Ghost
[59:40] what did he do was not seen in him what
[59:44] did he need to repent from
[59:47] do you think that he was a child needed
[59:50] to be presented to the priest so they
[59:52] they can present them and do whatever
[59:54] they do you know like we present our
[59:56] babies we didn't
[59:59] but he's he did it anyway right
[1:00:02] because he needed he was an example to
[1:00:05] us he was a model so he said let us
[1:00:07] fulfill what
[1:00:09] oh and you know what you want me had to
[1:00:12] do
[1:00:13] see not our righteousness but fulfill
[1:00:17] the word of God in our lives
[1:00:20] whatever he says whatever he said we do
[1:00:23] see we are fulfilling that's why we come
[1:00:25] to church that's why we read our Bible
[1:00:27] that's why we hear the word not so they
[1:00:29] can go from this year to this year not
[1:00:31] this way but that we can fulfill
[1:00:34] all righteousness
[1:00:37] that means you think right
[1:00:40] and the only way to think right is this
[1:00:42] word and to do those things
[1:00:45] that we know our right to do
[1:00:47] that is how we walk
[1:00:49] in righteousness that's how we work in
[1:00:52] Christ that's how we know the knowledge
[1:00:55] you know you cannot do something that
[1:00:57] you don't know what to do I mean
[1:00:59] if you cannot perceive you to be
[1:01:01] something you cannot be that I mean if
[1:01:04] you don't know the question how would
[1:01:05] you know the answer
[1:01:08] but that's when you come to church so
[1:01:11] you can learn of him
[1:01:13] and then you have to go and fulfill that
[1:01:16] this is not just come to hear nice
[1:01:18] sermons and I'm not the one that's going
[1:01:21] to give you a nice time but whoever I
[1:01:23] mean there's a lot of good places I've
[1:01:25] come to this Pulpit I'm not even worthy
[1:01:27] to take casino to fit in their shoes I'm
[1:01:30] not a preacher anyway
[1:01:32] but listen to me I just love God
[1:01:35] and I want to see if I can help you in
[1:01:37] any way I can that's all
[1:01:40] but he's righteousness his word needs to
[1:01:45] be fulfilled who is going to fulfill
[1:01:47] that word
[1:01:48] you and me
[1:01:50] let your will in heaven be done where
[1:01:54] you know who is going to do it
[1:01:57] who is going to fulfill God's
[1:01:59] righteousness
[1:02:01] how people are going to see all that
[1:02:04] what you are here because he wants to
[1:02:06] use you to fulfill his word in you so
[1:02:10] people can see
[1:02:11] on one of these days they're going to
[1:02:14] say
[1:02:15] God is going to play the little bride I
[1:02:17] said this is what I meant
[1:02:19] you know what a what a good wife is

[1:03:10] complete body and if you are part of the
[1:03:13] body the body you need to fulfill your
[1:03:15] part
[1:03:17] I don't care if you just
[1:03:19] come to church just to sit down and clap

[1:03:35] excitement
[1:03:37] and excited that you can excite your
[1:03:40] partner next to you you know how those
[1:03:42] people are that that you kind of down on
[1:03:44] somebody or bubbly and jumping and
[1:03:46] suddenly you start and then they start
[1:03:48] whistling I start singing and you start
[1:03:50] singing
[1:03:51] you know don't tell me you don't do that
[1:03:54] I like Christmas you know just sometimes
[1:03:57] people is nicer in Christmas I don't
[1:03:59] know why but that's the best time of the
[1:04:01] year people I don't know if because they
[1:04:03] get drunk I don't know but
[1:04:06] but people are nicer in Christmas
[1:04:08] that's why people love this season
[1:04:11] they give and they take
[1:04:13] you know I'm sorry or forgive me oh yeah
[1:04:16] go ahead you know everybody's nice but
[1:04:18] after Christmas is gone back to the same
[1:04:21] thing again but anyway you know and
[1:04:24] sometimes you know
[1:04:26] this is the
[1:04:27] for people the best time of the year
[1:04:29] just for that reason
[1:04:31] but I forgot what I was scared I don't
[1:04:33] even know what I was going with this
[1:04:34] thought
[1:04:36] I remember in the middle anyway
[1:04:37] righteousness
[1:04:39] which is of god by faith you know you
[1:04:43] cannot please God without faith
[1:04:46] Eno please God
[1:04:48] Jesus please God
[1:04:50] why
[1:04:51] because they did everything
[1:04:53] that God required
[1:04:55] fulfill all
[1:04:56] the word and that is the only thing that
[1:04:59] please God by faith tomorrow that he
[1:05:02] speak to you and you do that that's
[1:05:04] that's how simple it is God Speak
[1:05:09] I do it and you know I am here to be
[1:05:13] accepted not by you
[1:05:15] but I want to be accepted by him and I'm
[1:05:17] already accepted by him I'm here because
[1:05:20] I want to please him
[1:05:22] because uh doing so I will also please
[1:05:25] you guys in in a sense as a body I do my
[1:05:30] part in the body
[1:05:31] you know that God put me to do
[1:05:33] ministering oh deacons whatever part you
[1:05:36] play a school teacher or whatever part
[1:05:38] you will do it
[1:05:40] because you want to please God whatever
[1:05:42] gift he has given you Philippians 3 10
[1:05:45] says that I may know him
[1:05:48] see that is the only reason
[1:05:51] but I may know him in the power see what
[1:05:54] power in the quickening power in the
[1:05:57] power of his resurrection is what I want
[1:05:59] to Paul said
[1:06:01] he says
[1:06:02] uh and the power of his resurrection and
[1:06:06] the fellowship of his suffering
[1:06:09] so what does this mean if he suffer
[1:06:12] and he learn obedient Christ suffering
[1:06:15] their obedience in the suffering
[1:06:18] what do you think is going to happen to
[1:06:20] you it won't be no less
[1:06:22] to know him in the fellowship of his
[1:06:24] suffering you know sometimes we want to
[1:06:26] have all the good things but we don't
[1:06:28] want the bad ones
[1:06:29] but you know he suffered and he learned
[1:06:32] obedience do you think I needed to learn
[1:06:34] opinions
[1:06:36] he knew everything he did everything
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:40] but
[1:06:42] listen to me children some young people
[1:06:45] you know how to make a mistake to be
[1:06:47] obedient that's what I did I learned by
[1:06:51] my mistakes
[1:06:52] Jesus didn't make any mistakes
[1:06:55] but he needed to learn obedience so this
[1:06:57] is the concept
[1:06:59] God spoke
[1:07:01] and he didn't
[1:07:03] disobedience
[1:07:05] that's it that's how simple it is that's
[1:07:08] count to him for obedience and the way
[1:07:10] that he the things that he went through
[1:07:13] it was obedience
[1:07:15] that means he didn't do what he wanted
[1:07:17] to do
[1:07:18] why do I have to do that you know like
[1:07:20] children why
[1:07:22] well and then can't walk out of excuses
[1:07:25] he didn't have no excuses God spoke
[1:07:29] so when parents children tell you throw
[1:07:32] the garbage the last later or why when
[1:07:35] you know
[1:07:37] when you do it you're being obedience
[1:07:39] and it comes to you as obedience
[1:07:42] it'd be a sacrifice to you to dump the
[1:07:45] garbage
[1:07:46] but it's obedience so you don't have to
[1:07:48] make a mistake you don't have to do what
[1:07:49] I did to learn
[1:07:51] you know to have all these teachable
[1:07:53] moments you don't have to make a mistake
[1:07:55] my father tried to tell me that
[1:07:58] he tried to lean me the right way my mom
[1:08:00] and you know what I told him when I was
[1:08:02] just sitting there I was rebellious you
[1:08:03] know what I said I don't want to leave
[1:08:06] you old-fashioned and I don't want to
[1:08:07] leave your experiences I want to leave
[1:08:09] mine what a mistake when I found out
[1:08:11] that I just went through what they went
[1:08:14] through and they were trying to tell me
[1:08:15] don't do that this is what's going to
[1:08:17] happen all I had to do just be obedient
[1:08:19] and do what they thought and I would be
[1:08:21] all right but no no hard-headed
[1:08:24] yeah I needed to do what I wanted to do
[1:08:27] so I learned you know how to learn young
[1:08:29] people you know how to learn that way
[1:08:31] you can be obedient just by doing by
[1:08:34] your parents tells you to do
[1:08:36] the pastor sometimes gets on you guys I
[1:08:39] know
[1:08:40] I've been here before
[1:08:42] but that is a face responsibility anyway
[1:08:45] as a pastor
[1:08:47] you know he don't hate you he don't want
[1:08:49] to you know
[1:08:51] be mad at you he's just trying to
[1:08:53] help you
[1:08:55] so you can be obedient
[1:08:57] so you don't have to fall in the hole
[1:08:59] then learn oh man actually went that way
[1:09:01] too late you're gone
[1:09:03] see
[1:09:05] you know so the word of God will lead
[1:09:08] you it's a lamb unto your feet I'll
[1:09:11] guide you so you will never get into
[1:09:14] do we have problems we come to you
[1:09:18] I mean
[1:09:20] that came to Jesus Jesus went to what he
[1:09:24] went don't you think you're going to be
[1:09:25] getting less than that you will go
[1:09:27] through that thing too
[1:09:28] and you don't have to wait for trouble
[1:09:31] because trouble will come to you
[1:09:34] but your response is to your troubles to
[1:09:38] everybody to everybody that offends you
[1:09:40] to everybody that said bad things about
[1:09:42] you to to the things that happen in your
[1:09:44] life the only thing you have you have
[1:09:47] your response to those things
[1:09:49] see
[1:09:50] and a response should be Godly you know
[1:09:55] our response to should be the same
[1:09:57] response a Christ response he went on
[1:10:00] suffer all the way unto death and he did
[1:10:03] not want
[1:10:05] open what
[1:10:07] well I opened my mom more than once at
[1:10:10] least but
[1:10:11] he didn't you know why he opened his
[1:10:13] mouth
[1:10:14] because he was fulfilling
[1:10:16] the word of God righteousness so he knew
[1:10:19] already this is me the word said this is
[1:10:22] what I do
[1:10:24] and I do it
[1:10:26] so if somebody comes to you I give you a
[1:10:29] hard time you know Connor oh joy oh yeah
[1:10:32] right praise the Lord
[1:10:35] thank you Lord for this circumstance
[1:10:38] they're going to come you know it's
[1:10:40] nobody have offended you don't worry
[1:10:42] they will offend you somebody will
[1:10:46] but what you're supposed to do
[1:10:49] you're not supposed to retaliate did
[1:10:51] Jesus retaliate it no why because he
[1:10:53] needed to fulfill the word of God and
[1:10:56] you need to fulfill the word of God this
[1:10:58] morning you have a whole year to start
[1:10:59] all over again forget what happened last
[1:11:02] week last year start again and fulfill
[1:11:06] this righteousness
[1:11:09] you have everything you need
[1:11:12] to go from Earth to heaven
[1:11:14] said you got the Holy Ghost you have
[1:11:16] everything you have need the pastor is
[1:11:19] here to guide you and lead you and help
[1:11:21] you you know so you can get there
[1:11:24] so we are without excuse we are not
[1:11:27] ignorant anymore the way we respond
[1:11:30] okay
[1:11:31] if we do it it will do because we want
[1:11:33] to then we learn
[1:11:35] that after we do it we're guilty we feel
[1:11:37] guilty of course we feel guilty you know
[1:11:39] why because the Holy Ghost convicts you
[1:11:43] said you shouldn't answer it that way
[1:11:45] you should have done that
[1:11:47] and then we feel guilty spare yourself
[1:11:50] for the guiltiness and prepare yourself
[1:11:51] all that you know things that you have
[1:11:54] to go through just do what's right and
[1:11:56] you're happy and he's happy
[1:11:58] but when you don't know when I don't do
[1:12:00] what is right what we feel guilty then
[1:12:03] we cry forgive me Lord I didn't want to
[1:12:07] do that that's not my desire now we go
[1:12:09] through all this
[1:12:11] and cry and I'm not good and I'm not
[1:12:14] worthy I don't know how you love you
[1:12:16] know we go through the whole thing
[1:12:18] and then spray yourself all that stuff
[1:12:21] just do what's right
[1:12:23] next time you you in the situation
[1:12:25] remember spare yourself all that
[1:12:27] learning process
[1:12:30] I don't need a learning process you
[1:12:32] already knows what's going to happen and
[1:12:34] how it's going to come out just trust
[1:12:36] God do what's right
[1:12:38] fulfill the word of God in your life
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:43] I know you guys kind of quiet because
[1:12:46] you know like me stay late ate too much
[1:12:50] play too much had too much fun now I'm
[1:12:53] paying for it anyway
[1:12:56] this journey Progressive Journey
[1:13:00] the more we walk the more deeply and
[1:13:02] intimate we get with God that is how
[1:13:05] this walk is this walk it is to get
[1:13:08] to learn to be like him
[1:13:12] see
[1:13:14] to get involved with him to get involved
[1:13:16] with one another to get involved
[1:13:20] see we're in a world that that we start
[1:13:24] understanding who he is and who we are
[1:13:28] and without understanding the more we
[1:13:30] understand his character
[1:13:32] then you start understanding what
[1:13:34] character you should be also because
[1:13:36] without character
[1:13:38] we are not going to make it that is not
[1:13:40] going to unders The World God with our
[1:13:42] character so while we're looking at are
[1:13:44] we walking we see God's character in the
[1:13:46] word and what he and what he will do
[1:13:51] he trains us you know
[1:13:55] sorry it trains us and he he lead us and
[1:13:59] he shape us then as we go we are
[1:14:02] learning how to what to have his own
[1:14:05] character
[1:14:07] because we cannot handle the world with
[1:14:09] our character you know what this robot
[1:14:11] says Matthew 11 28 30 come unto me or
[1:14:15] thee that are labeled
[1:14:17] heavy laden you know overburdened people
[1:14:20] that are overburdened sometimes and I
[1:14:22] will give you what rest
[1:14:25] see I will
[1:14:27] make things easy for you
[1:14:30] see maybe the things are not easy but
[1:14:32] God in the in the middle of chaos God
[1:14:35] can bless you
[1:14:39] look at the the the the three Hebrew
[1:14:41] children
[1:14:43] you know here's the three people and
[1:14:45] they didn't have a brother Paul was
[1:14:47] talking they didn't even have a promise
[1:14:50] but he said
[1:14:52] if he saved us or not we are not bowing
[1:14:55] we going
[1:14:58] promise or no promise
[1:15:00] but we are not going to do that
[1:15:03] and that should be our response just as
[1:15:05] well
[1:15:06] it doesn't matter what happened I'm
[1:15:08] gonna do his will
[1:15:10] I'm gonna like it maybe I had to suffer
[1:15:13] it doesn't matter what but what happened
[1:15:15] the winning
[1:15:17] and a four month shows
[1:15:20] and who was
[1:15:21] you know they're morphing
[1:15:24] Jesus they are funny
[1:15:26] show with them then there was four
[1:15:29] now you think that was great
[1:15:32] let me show you something greater than
[1:15:33] that
[1:15:34] that the poor person is in you in you in
[1:15:38] you in you in you you have a promise
[1:15:42] and you have a holy ghost to help you
[1:15:43] with the promise and those Hebrew
[1:15:45] children they haven't even a promise
[1:15:47] don't even have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:49] you have everything you have need
[1:15:53] to resist the devil
[1:15:56] and do the right things
[1:15:58] see
[1:16:00] doesn't matter what happened take my
[1:16:01] joke uh the 29 up on you and learn on me
[1:16:07] that's what the Holy Ghost is there so
[1:16:09] you can learn on him Christ it is our
[1:16:12] example it is a model it's a little me
[1:16:14] for I am make gentle
[1:16:17] I'm kind and sweet
[1:16:20] so
[1:16:21] you and I to be we should be kind to one
[1:16:24] another we should be sweet
[1:16:27] we should not prefer some other than
[1:16:29] above others we should respect everyone
[1:16:33] we should be kind we should be sweet we
[1:16:35] should be humble
[1:16:36] Paul says and lowly humble remember I
[1:16:40] preached last time I came I preacher
[1:16:41] someone you remember what I was
[1:16:43] tired of humble
[1:16:45] be humble and in heart
[1:16:48] and you shall find rest unto what
[1:16:52] unto your soul that's what a lot of
[1:16:54] people that are going through and fro on
[1:16:57] Restless there's a lot of people that
[1:16:59] cannot have peace in their life they
[1:17:01] don't know if they're going or coming
[1:17:03] what to do what not to do
[1:17:05] you know what they need a change
[1:17:08] because this is not burdensome this is
[1:17:11] not hard this walk is Holy heart if we
[1:17:13] try to do it in ourselves in our might
[1:17:16] in our efforts but this he said take my
[1:17:19] joke it's easy
[1:17:22] see
[1:17:23] because he will guide us and he will
[1:17:25] show you know what a thing is that you
[1:17:27] take two animals and you put a joke on
[1:17:29] them and it's it's like this and those
[1:17:32] two are yeah that's what we do with with
[1:17:34] the ox or something when we want to turn
[1:17:36] the ground
[1:17:38] and you know if this one tries to pull
[1:17:40] that way this other one said ah we're
[1:17:44] going that way but I want to go this way
[1:17:46] no you can go that way so the same thing
[1:17:49] Jesus got you Jesus is your Mentor Jesus
[1:17:51] is your helper and every time you try to
[1:17:53] take a detour what happened the holy
[1:17:56] spirit said no
[1:17:58] and then um but I wanna I'm thirsty nope
[1:18:03] see that is why he's there the Holy
[1:18:07] Ghost is there to guide you and to lead
[1:18:08] you and to keep you straight
[1:18:11] but to have a choice still see God gave
[1:18:14] you a choice so he cannot force you
[1:18:18] but he will give you a talk don't do
[1:18:20] that
[1:18:21] if you have the Holy Ghost you know what
[1:18:22] I'm talking about conviction give you a
[1:18:24] talk don't do it when you feel that talk
[1:18:28] don't do it
[1:18:29] when you doubt remember I said don't do
[1:18:32] it if you're not sure don't do it
[1:18:36] wait upon the Lord in those moments okay
[1:18:38] he will lead you he will guide you he
[1:18:40] will keep you straight towards the mark
[1:18:43] towards the goal that is him he said
[1:18:46] take my joke up on you and learn me and
[1:18:49] it says in 30 says for my yoga CC not
[1:18:53] hard it's not hard
[1:18:55] it says it's not sharp you know
[1:18:58] it's a
[1:18:59] and my burden is light so I prefer to
[1:19:02] take his burden let him take give your
[1:19:05] burdens to him Jesus and take his burden
[1:19:07] that is light
[1:19:10] this year they just put it all in him
[1:19:12] you have a burden you have a concern you
[1:19:15] have something going in your life you
[1:19:17] have a situation just give it he wants
[1:19:20] you to give it to him
[1:19:22] see and he will take care of it
[1:19:25] all we have to do is just surrender and
[1:19:27] say and you know hear Lord
[1:19:30] I have this problem you know just tell
[1:19:33] him like it is he wants to hear your
[1:19:34] voice he wants to hear you you know this
[1:19:38] you have to voice he cannot help you
[1:19:40] until you voice his will and your
[1:19:43] concerns
[1:19:45] that's it the only way the word of God
[1:19:47] is going to take flesh
[1:19:50] gospel you own it a thought then you
[1:19:53] speak and it becomes one
[1:19:56] flesh a word and then if he's manifested
[1:19:59] that's how it works that's what happened
[1:20:01] to Satan as well listen to me resist the
[1:20:04] devil you know why he put a thought in
[1:20:07] your mind
[1:20:09] and you think it's your thought he wants
[1:20:10] you to own it
[1:20:12] you know like they're going to have a
[1:20:14] class with for man's lost him that's a
[1:20:17] problem with men's
[1:20:19] then you driving down the street he
[1:20:21] comes a naked women half naked women
[1:20:22] anyway and then you take a look because
[1:20:25] you need you know you're driving of

[1:20:40] you know free look
[1:20:41] so anyway
[1:20:43] but receives the devil because now that
[1:20:45] that was saying look at how good it
[1:20:46] looks and Babylon you know it's not
[1:20:48] working but that is not your thoughts
[1:20:50] you need to understand man that is that
[1:20:52] you thought uh so I brought the battle
[1:20:54] that's not you
[1:20:56] but he put this thought to see if you're
[1:20:59] going to own them because as soon as you
[1:21:01] think it's you you know what happened
[1:21:03] you own them and then it become what a
[1:21:06] realization in your life you start
[1:21:08] acting up that because you think it's
[1:21:09] you
[1:21:10] there's no sin
[1:21:12] in the temptation
[1:21:14] when when he comes and said to you
[1:21:16] you're not sinning
[1:21:19] is what we
[1:21:21] take it
[1:21:22] and then he produces
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:26] so there's nothing in tempting he can
[1:21:29] tempt you all day long you are not
[1:21:31] sinning all you have to do is receive
[1:21:34] this Satan that's not me that's you
[1:21:38] you know why people feel depressed
[1:21:41] they're not because they are depressed
[1:21:43] you know who is depressed Satan because
[1:21:45] he know he's saying
[1:21:47] and he's depressed and so people have
[1:21:49] been depression in church and at home
[1:21:52] but you know that's Satan you are
[1:21:54] depressed
[1:21:55] life is awful whatever he give you all
[1:21:58] this reason
[1:21:59] and if you own it it is not you
[1:22:02] it is the spirit of depression that he
[1:22:05] puts in you and then you own it and then
[1:22:07] you say I'm so depressed don't wonder I
[1:22:09] understand why you are depressed
[1:22:12] because your own
[1:22:14] that thought all you have to do resist
[1:22:17] the domains
[1:22:19] don't accept the box of rattles don't
[1:22:21] accept the thought realize that that's
[1:22:24] his
[1:22:25] thought
[1:22:27] and just keep moving you don't have to
[1:22:29] think he's going to get you more than
[1:22:31] one so just keep moving
[1:22:33] uh he gave me a lot of thought I walked
[1:22:35] all the line and I thought and okay
[1:22:37] that's your Satan and you're going to
[1:22:39] pay for that you want me to own it so I
[1:22:40] can pay I don't I'm tired of the boohoo
[1:22:42] boo I don't want to be I want to be
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:46] so we walk every day and we are
[1:22:49] bombarded you know oh you know Medias
[1:22:52] and these and
[1:22:54] all right now I remember
[1:22:57] Christmas time you know
[1:23:01] you walk into Walmart and you walk into
[1:23:03] the stores and you hear the music you
[1:23:05] know jingle bell jingle bell you never
[1:23:07] saw Jingle Bell throughout the whole
[1:23:08] year and you don't care about Jingle
[1:23:11] Bells but as soon as the spirit comes
[1:23:13] music carries a spirit
[1:23:16] media everything game they carry spirit
[1:23:20] so then you know working in the store oh
[1:23:24] my goodness I hate that song but I'm
[1:23:26] singing that
[1:23:28] why because I heard it
[1:23:32] you know I own it and I started singing
[1:23:34] it became a reality I don't want to make
[1:23:37] his word a reality I want to make God's
[1:23:40] word a reality
[1:23:42] receive the thought
[1:23:44] you don't have to take them you know how
[1:23:46] to buy you know how to accept them
[1:23:48] realize that is that is his thought and
[1:23:51] not yours
[1:23:55] so if you understand that then
[1:23:58] you can understand more when the thought
[1:24:01] of God's coming to your mind
[1:24:03] right
[1:24:05] I mean you know when I'm mad and when I
[1:24:07] have a spirit of whatever I mean you
[1:24:09] know by sometime I get moody when I
[1:24:11] don't eat
[1:24:12] you know my sugar goes like this and my
[1:24:14] mood goes like this then my wife feeds
[1:24:17] me and then I get happy and I kiss on it
[1:24:18] but see because I don't know food made
[1:24:20] me happy
[1:24:22] I'm not the only one I bet you it will
[1:24:25] make you happy
[1:24:27] and some of us more happy than others
[1:24:30] the way we eat anyway
[1:24:34] no I like I like those places that you
[1:24:36] can make a pig out of yourself
[1:24:39] you know that that
[1:24:40] doesn't that's a scene anyway that's a
[1:24:42] scene to indulge
[1:24:45] what
[1:24:46] let's just bring it right to your living
[1:24:49] room
[1:24:51] over eating this endorsement anyway
[1:24:54] anything in excess
[1:24:56] you know that you can drink enough water
[1:24:58] until you drown yourself
[1:25:00] anything in excess
[1:25:02] it's not good for you okay
[1:25:04] so anyway let's leave that there so
[1:25:06] anyway thoughts you know there's all
[1:25:10] kind of spirits it's all kind of voices
[1:25:12] are there
[1:25:13] and all they wanted to find a place to
[1:25:15] watch
[1:25:16] to make their up you know a boat you
[1:25:20] know that that Jesus talks about that
[1:25:22] person that that uh cleaned his house
[1:25:24] you know his life he he received the
[1:25:26] Lord everything was clean and it stayed
[1:25:29] that way he never was filled with
[1:25:31] nothing
[1:25:31] but if you don't feel it with something
[1:25:33] somebody else will feel it for you
[1:25:37] that's why we had to have been filled
[1:25:39] with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] because if we don't feel it you know and
[1:25:42] you are not a match for Satan
[1:25:46] and then he took seven more and came
[1:25:49] back and the house wow the house is
[1:25:51] clean yeah justify sanctified
[1:25:55] but never feel so what happened the
[1:25:57] second stage was worse than the one
[1:25:59] than the first one you know what she's
[1:26:01] that one
[1:26:03] a religious stage
[1:26:05] he was still a Christian he believed in
[1:26:07] Christ he accepted but he became a Hua
[1:26:10] a religious spirit that is the worst
[1:26:13] spirit I had dealt with
[1:26:16] that is the spirit that killed and put
[1:26:18] Jesus in the cross
[1:26:20] I went to Africa I'd be going around
[1:26:22] many many years and and I go places and
[1:26:25] the worst spirit that I can find is the
[1:26:27] people you know we make a line after we
[1:26:29] pray sure we can pray for the people at
[1:26:31] the end of the meetings
[1:26:32] and I've seen this the first time I saw
[1:26:35] the Spirit they will laugh right in your
[1:26:38] face they will come and they will last
[1:26:40] in your face
[1:26:42] that religious spirit is the hardest one
[1:26:44] to get out
[1:26:45] that's why you get seven see seven is
[1:26:48] what completion
[1:26:50] see that person is completely mad anyway
[1:26:53] it's what it is
[1:26:55] and I don't want to be completely mad I
[1:26:57] want to be completely out of my mind so
[1:26:59] I can have his mind I want to be
[1:27:01] completely empty so he can fill me with
[1:27:04] the Holy Ghost I want to be empty but I
[1:27:08] want to be filled with his spirit
[1:27:11] see
[1:27:13] I want to be
[1:27:15] I want to he's Jesus
[1:27:19] you know joke is comfortable it's
[1:27:21] gracious it's Pleasant
[1:27:24] it's happiness it's peace it's Joy
[1:27:26] everything that you need you find him in
[1:27:28] Christ
[1:27:29] if you allowed you'll find it
[1:27:33] I want to reach you
[1:27:35] uh
[1:27:37] talking about intimacy this is how
[1:27:39] brother Branham puts it because it is a
[1:27:42] big part of walking
[1:27:44] you cannot walk with someone you don't
[1:27:47] agree with that person right that's what
[1:27:48] the Bible says two cannot walk
[1:27:51] you know I've been married 40 some years
[1:27:53] and sometimes I don't agree with
[1:27:55] everything with my wife
[1:27:57] but it has nothing to do with the Bible
[1:27:59] I mean what are we going to eat today
[1:28:00] well I I want Mexican no I'm tired of
[1:28:03] Mexican what do you want Oh I want salad
[1:28:05] I don't want no Saucy but I'm talking
[1:28:07] about those things
[1:28:09] but when we come to the word of God we
[1:28:11] are one in the word of God okay
[1:28:13] we agree but if you cannot agree with
[1:28:16] God you don't agree with your pastor you
[1:28:18] don't agree with your in the world how
[1:28:20] can you walk
[1:28:21] so brother brother is trying to
[1:28:23] put this in profession this is what he
[1:28:25] says God provided with
[1:28:28] I don't even know okay see what that
[1:28:30] means
[1:28:32] okay
[1:28:34] oh my goodness it's already that time
[1:28:36] okay okay here we go
[1:28:38] the next room is the bedroom now brother
[1:28:41] brother was talking that I don't care if
[1:28:43] a house has a hundred rooms
[1:28:45] 50 bathrooms and 10 kitchens it's still
[1:28:49] basically is the kitchen the living room
[1:28:52] and the bedroom
[1:28:54] the next room is the that's the last one
[1:28:56] because in that one is what intimacy
[1:28:59] happens you know what I'm talking about
[1:29:01] you people that are married that's what
[1:29:02] intimacy
[1:29:03] that's where life happens
[1:29:07] you see
[1:29:09] that's where
[1:29:11] you know
[1:29:13] uh they come together as one limit
[1:29:16] advances let's leave it there that's
[1:29:18] what that happens and that's what God
[1:29:20] wants without intimacy we are the bride
[1:29:23] of Christ and he's the bridegroom he
[1:29:24] wants intimacy
[1:29:26] but we got to get into that room now
[1:29:29] what is the first room I'll get to that
[1:29:31] in a minute the first room is the
[1:29:33] kitchen
[1:29:34] you know what is that room Fellowship
[1:29:38] we love Fellowship that's a lot of
[1:29:40] people and I don't know who they are not
[1:29:41] so I don't know who I'm talking about
[1:29:43] but I know it happens they love you
[1:29:45] because the Way You Are
[1:29:48] and they like to come to church because
[1:29:50] they feel good the way you treat them
[1:29:52] and then you have a all good kind of
[1:29:55] music programs a drama program and you
[1:29:57] got all kind of things that you offer
[1:29:59] you know that the Lord is using you
[1:30:01] Outreach programs and people love that
[1:30:05] and they come and then you don't see
[1:30:07] them again for a while until you have
[1:30:08] another something special and they come
[1:30:10] only because they like your fellowship
[1:30:14] see and some of us sometime in this
[1:30:16] message will happen is we can have
[1:30:18] Fellowship in the kitchen around a piece
[1:30:20] of chicken
[1:30:22] you know we got padlocks and we have
[1:30:24] Fellowship around food
[1:30:26] but when you come to the word of God you
[1:30:28] don't see him again
[1:30:30] see those are the people that like to
[1:30:32] come and they love and they like you
[1:30:33] what you got
[1:30:35] and then what the Church offers
[1:30:38] and that's it no commitment
[1:30:41] they don't make any commitment to the
[1:30:42] church to the pastor to you guys I just
[1:30:44] want to enjoy what you have the good
[1:30:46] part that I like but you know this one I
[1:30:48] don't know no commitment that's the
[1:30:50] kitchen the next room is the living room
[1:30:52] now the living room is when you
[1:30:54] communicate see
[1:30:56] that is when you and the little bride
[1:30:58] gets together and sit down after a good
[1:31:00] dinner you know
[1:31:01] okay we saw we worship now we are happy
[1:31:05] now now sit down I'm gonna fit you and
[1:31:09] then after with it we're going to talk
[1:31:11] see so here the word come forward God
[1:31:15] wants to communicate to you
[1:31:17] see
[1:31:18] and that is where you have to
[1:31:21] bring your expectations
[1:31:24] you know what happened to Corpus they
[1:31:26] don't last too long when they get
[1:31:27] married because they never sit down to
[1:31:30] find out who is who and what do I expect
[1:31:32] of you and what you expect of me
[1:31:35] I think couple that they get married and
[1:31:37] they never sit down to talk
[1:31:40] you know they were too happy with the
[1:31:41] with the food but they you know they
[1:31:43] thought that that was the whole team you
[1:31:45] know
[1:31:45] so when they get married she expected
[1:31:48] that he will act
[1:31:51] like the father that he knows that's
[1:31:53] what she knows that was his first love
[1:31:56] that is his father
[1:31:57] so he think he's marrying his father and
[1:32:00] he should act just like that's what she
[1:32:02] had he was looking for a mother
[1:32:05] because that's all he knows that was the
[1:32:08] first wife the first I mean the first
[1:32:09] woman that's the one that took care of
[1:32:11] him I mean
[1:32:13] he's looking for wife
[1:32:15] so what happened again they never sit
[1:32:17] down to talk about expectation so now
[1:32:19] things start working the way it should
[1:32:21] be but I expected you to do this and he
[1:32:24] said but I expected to cook well I never
[1:32:27] cooked my mango but I told you and he so
[1:32:30] then what happened after a while
[1:32:35] they don't even last
[1:32:38] the living room God is going to tell you
[1:32:40] what he expect of you
[1:32:42] see that is when you talk to God said I
[1:32:45] got laid out the rules here it is
[1:32:47] you know this is what I want you to do
[1:32:49] this is the word this is how you should
[1:32:51] walk this is how you should Converse
[1:32:54] this is how you should communicate as my
[1:32:57] wife
[1:32:58] this is what I want you to do
[1:33:01] you know cut your hair
[1:33:03] you wear dresses you know wear pants out
[1:33:05] for the for the ladies meant to cut your
[1:33:07] hair you dress you put pie you take your
[1:33:11] shorts off
[1:33:12] at least in public
[1:33:14] you know Vermont says that put bathing
[1:33:17] suits and short and go in public so
[1:33:22] because sometimes I you know I put my
[1:33:23] pajama shorts at home but I'm going to
[1:33:25] sleep I'm not you know displaying myself
[1:33:27] out there that's what I'm saying
[1:33:28] depending while we're talking sometimes
[1:33:30] we say well my mom said no one not short
[1:33:33] well
[1:33:34] listen to me we're not gonna get there
[1:33:35] that's not the scope of my preaching
[1:33:37] that what I'm saying is expectations
[1:33:40] and the pastor come and you come every
[1:33:42] Sunday that's what people that don't
[1:33:43] make a commitment they don't know what
[1:33:45] God expects of you that's what he come
[1:33:47] this is what God wants this is what you
[1:33:50] need to do this is what I expect of you
[1:33:52] and then you can walk in it because now
[1:33:55] you know what you're supposed to do the
[1:33:56] husband
[1:33:57] Aram
[1:33:59] Jesus tell the little bride this is what
[1:34:03] I'm expecting on you and if you do this
[1:34:05] you know
[1:34:06] I love you no he's not going to love you
[1:34:09] less you don't do it and he's not going
[1:34:11] to love you more and you do it
[1:34:13] because nobody can take you away nobody
[1:34:16] comes from the love of God not even
[1:34:18] Satan
[1:34:20] you know he already love you and you
[1:34:22] cannot do nothing to for him to love you
[1:34:24] more and you can do not unless that he
[1:34:25] love you less neither
[1:34:27] he's love you but like everything else
[1:34:31] when we made mistakes we got to pay you
[1:34:34] know
[1:34:36] for the things that we do
[1:34:38] just like a child you tell them to do
[1:34:40] something and we don't do but they had
[1:34:42] to they had to that's a responsibility
[1:34:44] that he was supposed to do so he's
[1:34:46] accountable for that if not you pay for
[1:34:48] the consequences right
[1:34:51] if you and I don't do what we're
[1:34:52] supposed to do
[1:34:54] God the Bible said that he chastise
[1:34:56] those that we want
[1:34:58] but he lost he lost you but sometimes he
[1:35:01] had to strain you out if we don't
[1:35:02] because he already told you I expect
[1:35:04] from you
[1:35:06] exactly God don't play around exactly
[1:35:09] perfect this is what I want you to be
[1:35:11] this is how my wife to be you know Jesus
[1:35:14] is the Lamb and he's going to marry what
[1:35:17] alone
[1:35:20] he's not going to marry you know like
[1:35:22] Satan he has also a bride it's called
[1:35:25] the
[1:35:27] Jesus is not filthy
[1:35:29] Jesus is clean and Jesus is pure and
[1:35:32] Jesus is Holy who you think is going to
[1:35:34] marry someone that is going to make that
[1:35:36] way
[1:35:37] in in this work and brother bear says
[1:35:40] now then when you got when you get to
[1:35:42] this bedroom
[1:35:43] then see people might get to the kitchen
[1:35:47] the Life Fellowship no commitments they
[1:35:51] might
[1:35:52] another advance to the
[1:35:54] to the living room and they start coming
[1:35:57] and they start hearing what is required
[1:35:59] what God required and sometimes they
[1:36:01] don't want to do that
[1:36:02] uh that's too hard I don't think we need
[1:36:04] to do that well I'm a Christian and and
[1:36:08] I don't think we have to do all that I
[1:36:09] just forgot to to love us what they got
[1:36:12] all kind of excuses okay so you don't
[1:36:15] see them too long after a while they
[1:36:17] come and they disappear
[1:36:20] but that's
[1:36:22] not where I want to go I want to go
[1:36:25] further than I says you come to the
[1:36:27] fellowship and what a relationship now
[1:36:31] your brother brother Paul talks a few
[1:36:34] serious about relationship and about uh
[1:36:37] fellow I know I know that because I
[1:36:39] listen at them but
[1:36:41] fellowship and relationship now
[1:36:43] a simple uh definition or relationship
[1:36:46] is
[1:36:47] a connection
[1:36:49] that's all simple and simple form is a
[1:36:52] connection
[1:36:53] you have to have a connection
[1:36:55] that's why people come and go they don't
[1:36:57] handle they don't connect you know
[1:36:59] sometimes you meet somebody and we ask
[1:37:01] you how it was that did you like them
[1:37:03] did you connect it that's why we said
[1:37:05] yeah I think we we have the same kindred
[1:37:07] spirit we connected there had to be a
[1:37:10] connection
[1:37:11] without a connection there's no nothing
[1:37:14] no no way to continue because there's
[1:37:17] nothing if we don't have the same values
[1:37:19] the same belief the same thing there's
[1:37:22] no way we can there has to be a
[1:37:24] collection and this is our collection
[1:37:26] that we believe the message
[1:37:29] we believe the word of God
[1:37:31] we believe that the world the hour
[1:37:32] that's something that connects us
[1:37:35] a relationship is a collection
[1:37:38] you become into what a relationship from
[1:37:42] fellowship we have to be come to
[1:37:45] collection that's what happened in
[1:37:46] intimacy you husbands and why it's a
[1:37:50] connection
[1:37:51] you know brother Paul talks about when a
[1:37:53] man and a woman come together
[1:37:55] you know sometimes it's all lovey Lobby
[1:37:58] you know
[1:37:59] and it says once they do that that
[1:38:02] connection leaves an imprint
[1:38:05] that's why we don't want to do something
[1:38:07] unless it's got to prove
[1:38:09] anyway I don't that's not my trick you
[1:38:11] know you'll be coming into a relate then
[1:38:14] you have complete one
[1:38:15] I don't just want Fellowship I want
[1:38:18] complete Fellowship complete Fellowship
[1:38:21] is I'm moving from the kitchen to the
[1:38:23] living room to what to have intimacy
[1:38:26] with my bridegroom
[1:38:29] that's what he wants he says he said
[1:38:31] because you cannot have complete
[1:38:33] Fellowship until you become one into a
[1:38:37] relationship you know what today that's
[1:38:39] what the people today the the younger
[1:38:40] people they don't want to have a
[1:38:42] commitment that's why they only want to
[1:38:44] have Fellowship because they don't want
[1:38:46] to compete
[1:38:47] and they live together because he don't
[1:38:49] know if that's going to last or not
[1:38:51] I mean that's kind of a bargain you know
[1:38:56] let me not go there anyway
[1:38:58] you know why why pay for the milk when
[1:39:00] you have a cow
[1:39:02] that's what they said there
[1:39:06] that's not the way to go
[1:39:10] so what happened no commandment because
[1:39:12] well I don't know if this is going to
[1:39:14] last and if it's not going to last since
[1:39:16] we are not married
[1:39:17] we will go our separate way
[1:39:20] no commitment
[1:39:22] see no relationship no connection
[1:39:24] there's nothing to connect them
[1:39:27] anyone knows that and listen so it's
[1:39:29] with the church today now the church
[1:39:31] today we got too many people we got too
[1:39:34] many of them that are ashamed to go into
[1:39:37] a complete now first was complete
[1:39:41] relationship I mean complete Fellowship
[1:39:43] that is complete relationship
[1:39:46] with God
[1:39:48] to the bedroom New Life
[1:39:51] new birth that's what children conceive
[1:39:55] if we if we are the brother of Jesus
[1:39:58] Christ then why can't now we go into a
[1:40:00] relationship
[1:40:02] this year if you are not in that
[1:40:04] relationship and you're finding your
[1:40:06] side not changing and everything is
[1:40:07] going the same way all the time you
[1:40:09] continue doing the same thing
[1:40:11] you might want to find out if you are in
[1:40:15] that relationship with God or not
[1:40:17] complete
[1:40:18] that's when you surrender completely you
[1:40:21] saw to God and you said do unto me
[1:40:23] that's what the marriage happens you
[1:40:27] know
[1:40:28] it says then all the sameness and
[1:40:31] backwardness
[1:40:32] and all gone for us
[1:40:35] because sometimes we don't feel good
[1:40:37] you know that's what pastors and you
[1:40:40] know they don't they don't have one he
[1:40:41] had to do but I think in in Tucson they
[1:40:45] cannot come together to have Fellowship
[1:40:47] around the world because everybody had
[1:40:49] their own you know ideas and revelation
[1:40:53] so what happened is everybody free
[1:40:55] backwards and difficult they come
[1:40:58] together and they feel unease why
[1:41:01] I'm not feeling honest when this church
[1:41:03] do you feel honest on this church
[1:41:06] when I'm around you do you feel kind of
[1:41:07] I don't know about this guy no why
[1:41:11] because we connected
[1:41:13] I am connected to Christ you're
[1:41:15] connected to Christ we have an
[1:41:17] interesting mankind so we don't feel
[1:41:19] shame or we don't feel bad awareness and
[1:41:21] we are okay okay I'm okay let's walk
[1:41:25] together I don't care if I belongs on
[1:41:27] somebody in Texas you know you don't say
[1:41:30] murder
[1:41:31] a church Bride is a body
[1:41:34] so the same body that is here we have a
[1:41:36] portion of my body in Tucson so I should
[1:41:38] feel the same way that I've been in
[1:41:40] Tucson that I feel here with you I
[1:41:42] should feel the same way under this
[1:41:43] pastor that I feel under that Pastor is
[1:41:46] not something is wrong
[1:41:49] I lose a collection because my
[1:41:51] connection is that poor my connection is
[1:41:53] not brother dog my connection is Christ
[1:41:57] it is the spirit of God that I'm looking
[1:42:00] at I'm not looking at man and I'm not
[1:42:02] looking at church what church I'm going
[1:42:04] or you going I'm looking at going with
[1:42:07] Christ
[1:42:09] that's where my sight that's what I'm
[1:42:11] focusing in Christ and if you are in
[1:42:14] Christ and you are in Christ and all
[1:42:15] this is okay then all this is okay
[1:42:18] vertically as well see because we're not
[1:42:21] looking at the church to satisfy me
[1:42:24] see that's what expectation I was
[1:42:26] telling you God

[1:42:31] were all the way around and when that
[1:42:33] expectation Islam made you know what

[1:42:40] you and you and you and the pastor and
[1:42:42] we're not perfect yet not yet
[1:42:45] you know I still made mistakes so what

[1:43:54] well it's one before that
[1:43:57] I don't know who's doing
[1:43:59] okay okay

[1:44:35] if you are wondering you know but I
[1:44:38] better don't try to or Don't Clap too
[1:44:40] loud or don't say too loud because they
[1:44:42] listen
[1:44:43] you call me to have an experience with
[1:44:45] God
[1:44:47] everything else
[1:44:49] you block it out
[1:44:51] you came to worship God
[1:44:53] you not came here to be accepted by the
[1:44:56] people you came to be accepted by him
[1:44:57] your worship is to him he needs to
[1:45:00] accept that worship it is your sacrifice
[1:45:02] to him not to anybody else and he's the
[1:45:06] one needs to be pleased with your
[1:45:07] sacrifice
[1:45:08] yeah I'm not the one that tells you it's
[1:45:10] good borrowing different that's between
[1:45:12] you and who
[1:45:14] and God
[1:45:15] he says she will never come in he says
[1:45:20] okay
[1:45:23] he said you are born again you are a new
[1:45:25] child you are in the Chicago Glory with
[1:45:28] God
[1:45:28] fellowshipping with you here we go again
[1:45:30] brother Brian is trying to bring an
[1:45:32] image an imagery here and the image is
[1:45:35] that the Tabernacle in the desert you
[1:45:38] have the auto Court you got the holy and
[1:45:40] you have the Chicana Glory
[1:45:42] now in in the outer core it rains it was
[1:45:45] nothing it was no no no tetram no no
[1:45:49] roof so what happened is uh if it rains
[1:45:53] you get mad
[1:45:55] and if the sun don't shine you get mad
[1:45:57] and if you get too cold you get mad and
[1:46:00] if you get too hard you get mad see your
[1:46:03] your feelings go up and down if you stay
[1:46:05] in the outer core
[1:46:06] if you come just to Fellowship because
[1:46:08] you like the people and you like what
[1:46:10] they give that's it you know
[1:46:13] one day you come and then you don't
[1:46:15] you're like a JoJo up and down up and
[1:46:17] down up and down
[1:46:19] so what happened is in the outer core
[1:46:21] you know nothing is stable
[1:46:24] one day you got it in a good mood let's
[1:46:27] say you're not in that got a good mood
[1:46:29] so what happened you need to move to the
[1:46:31] second one the second one is what the
[1:46:33] Holier the holy
[1:46:35] and in the Holy One
[1:46:37] is the candles and the the show bread
[1:46:41] right and Jesus is the bread
[1:46:44] it's a better life and he is the light
[1:46:47] and in that one at least you you are
[1:46:50] better than being the other core but
[1:46:52] that's not the end of it because the
[1:46:55] light can go off you know the wind come
[1:46:58] or they pray for God to put the bread
[1:47:01] and now you're hungry
[1:47:02] and there's no light and it's dark now
[1:47:05] I'm scared
[1:47:07] well
[1:47:08] you need to move to them
[1:47:10] other one that is what
[1:47:12] the Shekinah Glory see intimacy that's
[1:47:16] where Fellowship
[1:47:18] you know and then you have here the
[1:47:21] living room
[1:47:23] communication companionship and then you
[1:47:26] fall into the Chicana Glory that is your
[1:47:28] complete intimacy complete Fellowship
[1:47:32] that is where you have in fellowship
[1:47:34] with God
[1:47:35] that is when you when you have a problem
[1:47:37] when you walk this year you start
[1:47:39] walking and you have a problem you get
[1:47:41] in your closet and you close the door
[1:47:43] and you get inside that she kind of
[1:47:45] glory and I tell you and I promise you
[1:47:48] that you will not come out the same way
[1:47:50] you went in
[1:47:54] see because there there is where you
[1:47:57] have a fellowship complete fellowship
[1:47:59] with who
[1:48:00] with God Amen
[1:48:03] he says
[1:48:06] and continue saying he says
[1:48:09] this thing
[1:48:11] it says
[1:48:15] Chicana Glory fellowship with him that's
[1:48:18] what
[1:48:19] the what we need today this is what we
[1:48:23] want this war to be closer to God we got
[1:48:27] to get in the Chicana Glory we need to
[1:48:29] move forward we need to get in in him
[1:48:32] he's in you and you and him he said in
[1:48:35] that day you know that I'm in the Father
[1:48:37] the father in me and I mean what it
[1:48:39] could become a connection it becomes a
[1:48:41] Unity it becomes a completeness
[1:48:44] because three is perfection
[1:48:47] see
[1:48:48] he in me and me and also knew so that's
[1:48:52] all you need enter into that complete
[1:48:56] relationship with God said that's what
[1:48:59] today brother is worship under the blood
[1:49:02] Worship in complete
[1:49:04] relationship intimacy with God
[1:49:08] it says to die out
[1:49:11] that is going to require to die out
[1:49:15] we have come as far as we're going to
[1:49:18] come
[1:49:19] last year yeah we are 2000 to 2023 we
[1:49:24] have come as far as we're going to come
[1:49:26] unless this year we sacrifice more
[1:49:31] we had done a part
[1:49:34] but you're going to require a little bit
[1:49:36] more sacrifice
[1:49:37] and depend on the sacrifice you made
[1:49:39] that's how far you're going to go
[1:49:41] are you willing to sacrifice and allow
[1:49:43] your entire life for him that is what's
[1:49:46] going to require bro everyone says
[1:49:50] so we need to sacrifice more we're
[1:49:52] already going to church twice and now or
[1:49:54] never miss a church it's not about
[1:49:56] missing Church nobody's keeping
[1:49:57] authality to see when you came and who
[1:50:00] came and holding that's not what it's
[1:50:02] about
[1:50:03] it's about
[1:50:04] completely
[1:50:06] dying out and let God live through you
[1:50:09] that's all
[1:50:11] right let's not miss it then over here
[1:50:13] says in Philippians 3 11
[1:50:17] um by any means am I attained unto the
[1:50:20] resurrection of the Dead
[1:50:22] see
[1:50:24] expectation that was his expectation
[1:50:27] when we come to church we have to have
[1:50:29] an expectation as well he says
[1:50:32] Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the
[1:50:36] thought that I think towards you said
[1:50:38] the Lord
[1:50:39] thoughts of Peace not of evil
[1:50:42] to give you one
[1:50:44] you expected in
[1:50:46] what disrespecting and what is your
[1:50:48] expectation whatever your expectation is
[1:50:50] that is your expected in
[1:50:52] what is poor expectation was what the
[1:50:55] Rapture the change of the body
[1:50:58] you know to have that quickened life in
[1:51:00] him like Jesus said that Spirit of Jesus
[1:51:02] raising from the dead and is in you and
[1:51:05] in me Paul says that will what
[1:51:08] raise you up that was his expectation at
[1:51:11] the end is that he promised me
[1:51:14] that he started working will finish it
[1:51:16] he promised me
[1:51:18] see if that is my expectation when I
[1:51:20] come to church he promised me that he
[1:51:22] will satisfy me that he will meet my
[1:51:24] niece that this is my healer he's my
[1:51:27] protector he promised me
[1:51:29] and God cannot lie and Paul said my
[1:51:31] expectation is that when I get to the
[1:51:33] end of the road what
[1:51:35] I will be rise up again
[1:51:39] and every person that had died in the
[1:51:42] past 2000 years even in the Old
[1:51:43] Testament they was looking towards that
[1:51:46] expectation and now we look into that
[1:51:48] sacrifice that he made in the cross for
[1:51:50] you and me
[1:51:52] so
[1:51:54] if we die or we go in the Rapture but if
[1:51:57] we die when we die we go to sleep with
[1:52:00] the same expectation that all those
[1:52:03] Christians has in 2000 years that God
[1:52:06] will raise me
[1:52:08] see so we don't have to be afraid of
[1:52:11] that
[1:52:11] because we cannot die as much as God can
[1:52:14] die and Paul says you know I got a body
[1:52:16] here and I have another prepare so here
[1:52:18] or there he was happy because we are not
[1:52:21] going to see that this had to go in the
[1:52:23] ground but that's condemned already this
[1:52:25] flesh
[1:52:26] it says First Corinthians 1 7 9 so that
[1:52:29] that you come
[1:52:31] it says behind login
[1:52:35] so God has give you everything God has
[1:52:39] gave all the gifts that this church
[1:52:42] needs for what
[1:52:44] he says behind no give waiting for the
[1:52:46] coming of the Lord
[1:52:49] this church God had gift you with what
[1:52:52] you need
[1:52:53] to help each other to grow to develop
[1:52:57] until the what the coming of the Lord
[1:53:00] you had no you are not lacking here you
[1:53:03] are not lacking anything
[1:53:05] in fact you are blessed with what you
[1:53:07] have but all this has a reason to be all
[1:53:10] this come to prepare you
[1:53:16] for the coming of the law it's not an
[1:53:18] entertainment
[1:53:20] it's not entertainment it's to get you
[1:53:23] ready
[1:53:24] you made that connection you get in the
[1:53:27] intimacy with God and you had that
[1:53:29] expectation but when you get there that
[1:53:30] is your expectation that he will rush
[1:53:32] you in that day hey who shall also
[1:53:38] establish you says confirmed or
[1:53:40] established you he's going to bring you
[1:53:43] to a manifestation see or he's waiting
[1:53:46] for you and I to let him have his way
[1:53:49] he wants to be manifested in flesh again
[1:53:51] and he will his word will be manifested
[1:53:54] but he is waiting on you and me
[1:53:57] to give him and surrender and give him
[1:53:59] the Liberty
[1:54:00] to take over
[1:54:02] that's all
[1:54:04] and he wants you to do that and he wants
[1:54:06] me to do that he says
[1:54:08] Until the End see on to the end he will
[1:54:12] finish the work to the end he will
[1:54:13] vindicate this word
[1:54:16] see that you might be blameless
[1:54:19] no shame no gear no sin that is my
[1:54:23] expectation you know he said he will
[1:54:26] have a a bride with our spot with a
[1:54:29] wrinkle no shame no guilt no sin I'm
[1:54:33] free
[1:54:34] and when I die I will die without
[1:54:36] expectation
[1:54:38] see
[1:54:39] that I am a Son of God now nothing now I
[1:54:43] am a Son of God he says that you may be
[1:54:46] blameless
[1:54:48] he said in the day of our Lord Jesus
[1:54:50] Christ
[1:54:51] the day when he comes you kind of stand
[1:54:54] there and you know how to be ashamed
[1:54:57] because you don't but you're supposed to
[1:54:58] do he did what he's supposed to do and
[1:55:01] here we are what he promised he will
[1:55:04] give you that expectation if you believe
[1:55:06] it and that's what you're expecting to
[1:55:08] be in that day in his presence
[1:55:12] you know will not give with nothing
[1:55:15] we're not shame that's what we're going
[1:55:17] to show a virtual holy bride will not
[1:55:20] Sparrow no ring online
[1:55:23] God is faithful
[1:55:25] see that means he's reliable
[1:55:29] see we can depend on God today
[1:55:33] you can maybe not depend on me but you
[1:55:35] can depend on his word what he promised
[1:55:37] he will bring it to pass in your life he
[1:55:39] says
[1:55:41] he's trustworthy by whom you were called
[1:55:43] into what a fellowship
[1:55:47] see in complete Fellowship he called you
[1:55:50] so he can have fellowship with you and
[1:55:53] you with him complete Fellowship he says
[1:55:55] uh of of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord

[1:56:36] Sugar
[1:56:37] we were created God created us for that
[1:56:40] God wanted Fellowship God wanted a
[1:56:43] family this is not your idea
[1:56:46] you know when God saw and I'm almost
[1:56:48] finished hopefully
[1:56:49] when God thought
[1:56:52] when Adam says you know it should not be
[1:56:56] a man to be alone he was alone
[1:56:59] that was an Aram idea because Jesus God
[1:57:03] was alone in the darkness you know
[1:57:05] before the foundation he was alone that
[1:57:09] thought was not Adam thought that was
[1:57:12] God thought
[1:57:13] because God is projecting his thoughts
[1:57:16] so he made him a maid you know
[1:57:20] so God was alone and he also wanted to
[1:57:24] have Fellowship that was his idea that's
[1:57:26] why he created you and me so we can be a
[1:57:28] family and he started creating the bride
[1:57:31] you know from the beginning from from uh
[1:57:33] they opened the course brother said that
[1:57:35] was the birth of the church that's what
[1:57:38] he started bringing her slowly through

[1:57:48] now she can be married because that's
[1:57:51] going to happen right here and then
[1:57:53] we're going to go to the supper
[1:57:55] see here is what the connection is going
[1:57:57] to happen
[1:57:58] the marriage happens here in this side
[1:58:01] of time not over there
[1:58:03] we're going to the wedding supper
[1:58:06] see
[1:58:07] so here is where all that connection is
[1:58:11] happening
[1:58:12] amen so
[1:58:16] let me reach you let me reach you uh
[1:58:20] let's jump to uh
[1:58:25] Shalom again I want to finish this this
[1:58:27] Shalom 140 verse 140. let's jump a
[1:58:31] little more so we can advance quickly oh
[1:58:34] yes sir
[1:58:36] New Year doesn't mean turning a new page
[1:58:39] it says oh no not turn a new page it's
[1:58:43] turning to the Hua to the word
[1:58:47] see that's what the word promised for
[1:58:50] today
[1:58:51] see what the light of the day is
[1:58:54] supposed to be the light of the deities
[1:58:55] the message of the hour and what the
[1:58:58] word promised is that we will have
[1:59:00] fellowship with God complete fellowship
[1:59:02] with God see
[1:59:04] we're going to walk towards that what we
[1:59:07] ought to do this year is not go back to
[1:59:09] crits and things go back to our or to
[1:59:13] our denomination no go back to all the
[1:59:16] nomination but turn to the word see what
[1:59:19] kind of light is supposed to shine what
[1:59:23] kind oh Church
[1:59:25] to the word get back to the word flip
[1:59:29] the right switch quick punching around
[1:59:32] in electric light see artificial
[1:59:34] man-made turn to his word and see the
[1:59:37] promise of the day of today
[1:59:41] and then once we see that promise we
[1:59:43] walk into it
[1:59:45] we need to find out what God requires
[1:59:47] what God expect and let's walk into that
[1:59:50] in this year if you know if God help us
[1:59:54] that's what we want to do we want to
[1:59:56] progress we want to go forward and then
[1:59:58] see what the promise is watch
[2:00:02] foreignification of vindication see when
[2:00:05] it is Vindicated and this message it has
[2:00:08] been over Vindicated
[2:00:15] it's already Vindicated
[2:00:18] see and then see what the promises
[2:00:21] the identification the Vindication then
[2:00:24] you know wherever you are in the light
[2:00:26] or not
[2:00:27] if this world will not produce what God
[2:00:29] said it will produce you in the wrong
[2:00:30] track
[2:00:32] is this word produces love and you're
[2:00:35] not loving one another like you're
[2:00:37] supposed to then something is not right
[2:00:39] in this word Pro promise that you will
[2:00:41] have fellowship with one another not
[2:00:43] only with God but with with each other
[2:00:45] if it's not producing that then
[2:00:47] something is wrong if this word is not
[2:00:50] producing
[2:00:53] the word in you completely God in flesh
[2:00:57] again the manifestation of God again in
[2:01:00] this earth then win the wrong track we
[2:01:03] need a change
[2:01:04] to me I want to see what promised for
[2:01:07] the day I want to know what the light of
[2:01:10] the hour so I can know how to walk you
[2:01:14] cannot walk it you don't know where
[2:01:15] you're going
[2:01:16] you might say I know the message I
[2:01:18] believe brother Brown and I believe the
[2:01:20] Bible yeah I'm standing on the on the
[2:01:23] message here but which way are you going
[2:01:25] you need to know what direction you're
[2:01:27] going
[2:01:28] are we going to towards God are we going
[2:01:30] left or right so brother says unto long
[2:01:33] to walk in it
[2:01:35] sometimes like a child when you have to
[2:01:37] you know help him walk and take the
[2:01:40] first step and that's what
[2:01:42] brother Paul do as a pastor helping you
[2:01:44] to what to walk in the right direction
[2:01:47] as you learn showing you that's the way
[2:01:50] we're going and then he put a vision you
[2:01:53] know in front of you that is the vision
[2:01:55] and that's where we're going see and his
[2:01:58] vision should be the same thing as my
[2:02:01] vision you know how many Holy Ghost do
[2:02:04] we have in this message
[2:02:06] it's just one Holy Ghost
[2:02:08] and in that Holy Ghost is doing that and
[2:02:10] you have to do the same thing in me
[2:02:12] why I don't understand some people are
[2:02:15] doing their own thing and then they said
[2:02:17] I got the Holy Ghost
[2:02:19] or I understand my Holy Ghost don't let
[2:02:21] me do that
[2:02:23] you won't have a different Holy Ghost
[2:02:27] see
[2:02:28] I want to know what the light of the
[2:02:30] hour is
[2:02:32] so I can know how to walk in it I want
[2:02:35] to know where I am living right now
[2:02:38] see my friend uh
[2:02:40] I want to know how far up the road I am
[2:02:45] that's for me is a it's a softbox I like
[2:02:49] to know
[2:02:51] just because when I used to be younger
[2:02:53] and even all that I like to be in
[2:02:55] control no longer in control but I need
[2:02:58] to know where I am where I'm going and
[2:03:00] how to get there well how are you going
[2:03:03] to get can you imagine if I leave Tucson
[2:03:05] and I'm going to Michigan and I throw my
[2:03:07] phone away and no map I'm going to do so
[2:03:10] okay good luck
[2:03:11] you might end up in Mexico I don't know
[2:03:13] someone in Tijuana
[2:03:17] so you need to know
[2:03:18] where you're going
[2:03:20] you need to know where you are and you
[2:03:23] need to know where that is
[2:03:25] and you start walking towards the goal
[2:03:27] towards the mark
[2:03:29] so that's what we're doing here
[2:03:31] that's what your pastor do encourage you
[2:03:34] show you the vision this is the goal
[2:03:36] this is the objectives
[2:03:39] forward March
[2:03:43] and then he looks back where's everybody
[2:03:47] you know stick with your pastor because
[2:03:49] he he is equipped
[2:03:52] responsible to take you all the way
[2:03:54] through
[2:03:56] amen
[2:03:59] but we know who holds the future
[2:04:01] I don't know what the future is none of
[2:04:04] us do but we know who holds the future
[2:04:09] so you don't have to know everything you
[2:04:11] don't know how to understand anything
[2:04:12] but you must believe everything
[2:04:15] in this message on the word of God
[2:04:19] and the one last thing patience
[2:04:22] patience some of us
[2:04:25] guess so some of us gets in social
[2:04:29] behavior
[2:04:30] I think and many a good man has done
[2:04:33] that you get into too much hairy you
[2:04:37] want to see you want to do it yourself
[2:04:40] never put your
[2:04:43] never what is the saying never put your
[2:04:45] your uh in front of the horse
[2:04:49] the car in front of your horse thank you
[2:04:52] okay
[2:04:53] listen
[2:04:54] don't try to be ahead
[2:04:59] always follow the lord stay behind don't
[2:05:02] get any frowned because of his plan
[2:05:04] because you don't know how can you know
[2:05:07] if you don't have nobody leading you see
[2:05:10] brother says you're doing it yourself
[2:05:12] you're trying to lead yourself you try
[2:05:14] to do things on your own and we can
[2:05:17] don't get in a hurry
[2:05:19] be still
[2:05:21] you know let God
[2:05:23] do the the way show you the way
[2:05:26] don't try
[2:05:28] to be ahead of God because we're going
[2:05:31] to fail amen patience let me reach you
[2:05:34] this and I will finish
[2:05:35] Romans 5 1 4 therefore
[2:05:38] by justified by faith we have peace with
[2:05:41] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[2:05:43] whom also we have access to faith into
[2:05:46] his grace where we stand a rejoicing
[2:05:49] hope of glory now are not only so about
[2:05:53] we glory in Tribulation sacrifice we're
[2:05:57] gonna be we're gonna be uh uh be learned
[2:06:00] by by the things we we experience good
[2:06:03] bad and ugly
[2:06:05] listen my friend I don't say mother how
[2:06:07] it happens but we should always move
[2:06:10] forward
[2:06:11] you know when times come bad times good
[2:06:14] times we're gonna serve the Lord see I
[2:06:17] don't care if I have to drag myself to
[2:06:19] the door
[2:06:20] don't let nothing distract you don't let
[2:06:24] nothing pull you away from this world no
[2:06:28] because some people like to serve God
[2:06:31] when everything is going good when
[2:06:33] they're in the mountain
[2:06:34] but when things are going you know the
[2:06:37] wrong way now they don't know if they
[2:06:39] want to serve God God what God is love
[2:06:41] God would not let us do that no see he
[2:06:45] says
[2:06:46] and so but we glory in tribulations
[2:06:49] man what's wrong with this guy Glory how
[2:06:52] many light to glory and pain and
[2:06:54] suffering
[2:06:55] but he did Glory because God is doing
[2:06:58] something God is shaping you he's using
[2:07:00] those things so he can mold you
[2:07:03] those things help you also knowing that
[2:07:06] the tribulation Works what patience you
[2:07:09] know why because you got away on the
[2:07:10] Lord when you're in those situations God
[2:07:13] is trying to teach you something way up
[2:07:14] on me be patient because I'm working I'm
[2:07:17] doing something you don't know you don't
[2:07:19] see it but I'm working
[2:07:21] even if you don't feel it even if you
[2:07:23] don't see it I'm working because God is
[2:07:25] faithful he says and patient experience
[2:07:28] once you go through whatever you go
[2:07:31] through then you have a what experience
[2:07:34] now when you experience God the more you
[2:07:37] experience God the more confidence you
[2:07:39] have on God
[2:07:41] see
[2:07:43] and experience bring what hope
[2:07:48] he says and in your passion you possess
[2:07:52] your what
[2:07:54] your soul
[2:07:59] better things for you this year
[2:08:02] but beloved we are persuaded we are
[2:08:05] convinced better things of you
[2:08:08] better things this year Paul said it
[2:08:11] says and things that accompany things
[2:08:15] that are near coming
[2:08:16] salvation through a company salvation
[2:08:19] through we does speak this is why Paul
[2:08:23] speaking for God it's not alrighteous to
[2:08:26] forget
[2:08:27] or to overlook he said your works and
[2:08:31] labor of love
[2:08:33] which you you have showed towards his
[2:08:37] name
[2:08:38] and in that you have ministered to the
[2:08:40] Saints unto the mystery and we decide
[2:08:44] that every one of you do show the same
[2:08:48] diligence persistent to the full
[2:08:51] Assurance or development
[2:08:54] you know
[2:08:55] go all the way see
[2:08:58] all the way through of Hope on to the
[2:09:01] end all the way he said that ye be not
[2:09:04] what
[2:09:05] slot for
[2:09:08] some people in this message the world
[2:09:11] they they grow kind of the symptoms they
[2:09:14] lose interest they lose interest of
[2:09:16] church the most interesting farming
[2:09:19] Fellowship they don't pray anymore why
[2:09:23] posted
[2:09:25] they be not lost for he said
[2:09:29] but followers
[2:09:31] of them who through faith
[2:09:34] see walking close to God the entire
[2:09:37] personality on God in Christ an absolute
[2:09:41] Trust
[2:09:42] and Power in wisdom in goodness and by
[2:09:46] practicing with passion endurance and
[2:09:50] waiting for the fruit in this season
[2:09:55] patient
[2:09:57] is a virtue it's not something that that
[2:10:00] you can get just like character
[2:10:01] character is not something that I give
[2:10:04] it's something that Embraces something
[2:10:06] that we have to work for not work in the
[2:10:09] center of working but you have to fight
[2:10:11] for character you God is going to bring
[2:10:14] you it's something that that is not
[2:10:17] given to us it is something that we're
[2:10:20] gonna have to
[2:10:21] you know put ourself
[2:10:24] in the bottom and just push all the way
[2:10:27] through and every experience that we go
[2:10:29] through it brings one a little bit more
[2:10:31] character a little Roma character a
[2:10:34] little bit more character
