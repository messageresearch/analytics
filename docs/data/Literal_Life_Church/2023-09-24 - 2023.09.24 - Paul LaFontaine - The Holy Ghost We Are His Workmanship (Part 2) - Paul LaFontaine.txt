streaming we just appreciate you listening God bless you may just God be with you and uh praise the Lord hope you enjoyed the songs hope you enjoyed that song it's just something so extra Godly about four-part Harmony I don't know what it is no offense to the sister singing but man it's just something something so real about it I don't know praise the Lord if you don't mind standing again we're going to go to the scripture this morning and read uh verse in the Ephesians the Epistle of the feasin Ephesians and we're going to go to chapter two Ephesians chapter 2. amen God is good amen God is good God bless you all the visitors are here in different ones we welcome you Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God there is nothing that we contribute when it comes to the gift of Salvation And the gift of the Holy Ghost there's nothing that we contribute it's a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast that's why God has set it up this way because if we had a part in it then we would boast and we would take our part and probably glory in that but it's not of any of our works that we receive any of this from God anything that God does in us whether it's salvation or whether it's whether it's sanctification or whether it's He blesses us in a certain whatever it is the Holy Ghost it all is the gift of God and it's not by our works at all how many know that for we are his workmanship you're not your own workmanship you're not working on yourself when you come into the kingdom of God in his presence you have to know we are completely his workmanship from day one until he finishes the work and how many know the scripture he he who hath begun a good work will he's the one that will finish it so he is he is the one that's that that has all of this we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so this is not just a a Reformation this is not just make god making you better this is a creation we are created in how many know that Jesus is a creator how many know he created the heavens and the Earth the same creator that created the heavens and the Earth is creating something in you you are his new creation so you and the reason I keep emphasizing this before I even preach this morning is that we've got to see that we are his workmanship and we are his creation and what he does is not just a little work it's actually him creating something in you the creator has come into your life and he's creating and anything good that comes out of you that's of God he created it in you looks at it a different way for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them and anybody says there's no truth to predestination it's all through the Bible it's right there that we have been ordained before the foundation of the world that we should walk in the manifestation of Christ on this Earth but it's not because of your works it's not because of you getting better it's not because your own efforts it's because he's creating in you what he's going to do we are his workmanship father bless your word today as we put it in your hands it is your word so we pray that you'll bring fruit from it we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated now the last time we ministered we talked about the Holy Ghost a little bit I'm going to continue that series and uh we laid a foundation in speaking about the Holy Ghost uh called the Simplicity of Christ Paul said I fear that your minds would be corrupted from the Simplicity of Christ and so I laid that Foundation I'll just have a little bit more of that today because that's before we talk about the Holy Ghost what is it how do we know that we have it before we get into those things I I want to I wanted to speak about the Simplicity of Christ because the enemy had takes something so precious as this and he wants to confuse it more than any other doctrinal subject he'd like to confuse this because this is your experience this is this is your walk with God this is where the reason you have a walk with God is because the Holy Ghost comes into your life and so if he can mess that up he wants to do it but I wanted to sympathize so in my series on the Holy Ghost that's my foundation and effort to simplify it so even the youngest child can understand it because the devil has complicated it may God help me to to bring it that this the youngest child could understand it the Simplicity that's in Jesus Christ so it's really this that there is a promise of God I want to simplify it there is a promise of God given for your life to give you his Spirit within you the power of God for this life and to transform transport you into the next life so I want to say it again there's a promise of God given for your life to give you his Spirit within you which is the power of God for this life to live in this life and then to transport you into the next life guess what it's not any more complicated than what I just said should I say it again there's a promise it's your promise it's a promise God has given for your life that he would put his Spirit within you and that will be the power of God for this life and the power to get us in the life to come it's not any more complicated than that can you say Amen so you know when you when you speak about the Holy Ghost then you you realize the world has messed up the term even ghost would be scary because the world has messed it up and we realize that that's not the way we look at when the scripture says the Holy Ghost people uh don't know the real meaning of it the church the churches today and the the new Bibles that are written they tend to lose the Ghost part and they call it the Holy Spirit which is the same thing but they like to lose the Ghost part because that's too scary for kids and that's just it doesn't fit in our culture I like to use the Bible terms it's just if you don't understand it and and so you could say if you were read Webster's Dictionary it says this the ghost is the spirit of a dead man well that's his his thing but you see if you're more specific about the meaning of ghosts it's the spirit of a living person without a flesh body so that's why it's termed the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of a person that's living can you say Amen that is doesn't have a bodily form but is able to come in another bodily form by pouring himself into the people so that's why it's called the Holy Ghost the Holy One of Israel the Holy One of God the the person of Jesus Christ so this Holy Ghost is a person it's it's a living person it's the holy person of Christ the word that came out from God in the beginning and wherever you see God like for example in the Old Testament whenever you see God and he moves on the situation and most of all he moves on prophets to speak the word because the the person of Christ is the word can you say man he came out in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God it was the word the logos that came out of God and then we see them throughout him throughout history in the Old Testament moving upon the prophets there's a scripture that says holy men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost so back there it was the Holy Ghost and it always moved into the prophet for that age to speak the word for the age so remember something about the Holy Ghost it'll never works outside of the word for the age it is sent to make alive the word for the age and to make it live in the people that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for so that's why you see him in the Old Testament with all the prophets and there they are and God moves on them by the Holy Ghost to speak that word for their age this is what the term the holy ghost means whenever you see God in the Old Testament you see that person of Christ working there to bring his word to pass for that age but in the New Testament that person was not just to anoint prophets but to set Abode in the soul of man or of a woman and guess what he did it he fulfilled it the same holy ghost that moved upon prophets in the Old Testament now it moves to the New Covenant it would not be just anointing them to speak the word it would not be just a a a making uh David shout and dance the way he did it wouldn't just be something outward but he would move now into the very Soul the control tower of man that same Holy Ghost would move to a different thing and why could he come into your soul because Calvary had come because if you were born with the nature you were born with the Holy Ghost couldn't sit there it's too holy can you say Amen there was no way that the Holy Ghost could sit at your soul level you were born in sin can you say much you had the the nature of the serpent from the beginning you were born with that but if he could go to Calvary and and do away with sin and a person receives it then you make a place for the spirit of God himself the Holy Ghost to dwell in your life this is what the Holy Ghost is and so now in the New Testament he sets his Abode in the soul of man or woman and he did it and guess what he's still doing it that's why I say this morning to everyone including the young people it's something you should never be afraid of it's the greatest priority in life that you seek and you say God I want this promise for me I see it in my pastor I see it in my parents but I want it for me most important thing in your life more important than jobs and money and career and marrying a wife or husband it's more important than anything that you say Lord This Promise is for me praise the lord it's a promise that he will live in you and when a heart says I see it I'm asking for it I'm seeking it that promise is mine too I see that it's for me and then he gives it you know friends it's not any more complicated than what I just said a heart says I see it I want it it's my promise I'll receive it and he's more willing to give it to you than you're even willing can you say amen and he says I'll come to a heart like that I'll draw a heart like that I'll come to that heart that's open he doesn't want to complicate this experience of the Holy Ghost it's man that's complicated it but we learned that Satan is the author of confusion and especially confusing the Holy Ghost to take the simple things of God and do all that he can to keep people from it so and you got to realize also about Satan that he has a history of when he knows something's coming to try to stop it he steps out in front of it and particularly at times when a birth was coming very important birth Moses birth was very important and so now he moves upon pharaoh to kill all the children you got to look at Satan's nature and that is I'm gonna I want to be there at the point of birth I'd like to stop it I'd like to confuse it I'd like to disrupt it he would love to stop it at the point of birth that I can confuse that person or that I can kill and so at that birth of Moses and the birth of Jesus Christ this is what Satan did at the point of birth at the moment of birth he's trying to stop it [Music] I would say his nature is the same way today and that's why there's a confusion about the experience of the Lord and a true experience of connecting with him that God baptizes you with his spirit and your desires are changed from the things of the world and to the things of God and you love the word the greatest evidence in my life has been I love the word of God I have no resistance in my soul to any of the word of God and I got that because at 16 years old he replaced it with a serpent nature what's the serpent nature it wants to serve the world but it also wants to worship its own way Cain wanted to worship but he wanted to worship God his own way when you're born with that many of you want to worship but you want to do it your own way most of the church world are worshiping God their own way a lot of the music is cane worship it's worshiping the way they want to worship I'm going to sing about the cross but I'm going to live anyway I want to live I'm going to have my tattoos in my earrings I'm going to blast out the rock and roll can you say man because it's Cain worship but God when he brings a new birth old things pass away All Things become new and we're not manifesting the world anymore we're manifesting Christ in our music and everything that we do somebody say praise the Lord so now we're talking about the New Birth because we we see then that he he brings it to a place that he changes that nature on the inside because the nature you're born with is completely contrary to God you people that grew up in the message I hate to say it you're just like one that was born in the world you had the same birth as them the potential for you to sin and to do things wrong and to be in prison for killing somebody you have the potential in your soul that you're born with to do what they did you're no better because you were born in the message you need a new birth like they do I don't know brother Paul I'm a pretty good person I've been a good boy my parents feel pretty good about me you need the new birth Christ in the inside soul level to kill that old nature of the world and kill that serpent nature that wants to worship God its own way it wants to come live like the world do anything live a double life and lift its hand in church you see now something has to change your life my friend because you cannot worship your own way you say Lord take that cane way out of me that I was born give me a newborn experience a new birth experience and now as I said I love the word of God there's no risk resistance Within Me even the parts that I don't understand which is fewer and fewer by the way fewer and fewer parts to understand but there's still things that I don't understand and so but I I there's still not a resistance to it it's just those Lord I don't know I don't know why your Prophet said that I mean he ever has that okay nobody does I guess I don't know why your Prophet said that way but later on he shows me then it arrives wow this is a word Prophet he's bringing us back to the word there's a reason why he said that there's a reason why I told the women to dress that way there's a reason why I told the guys to dress this way there's a reason why he told us to do this and so you can have your flesh resisting but that Soul it's never since 16 years old it's never resisted it's respected it and more and more he confirms that I can say Amen but I can only say Amen from here because he changed me by a new birth and that's the greatest evidence is that you can say Amen to every word of God you can shout You Can Dance you can have all the manifestations you can have the gifts of the Spirit but the greatest evidence is that you are connected inside with the author of the word living in you that you can say Amen to every word of God there's no more cane nature to resist it and say I'm just going to do it my own way all that's burnt out how many could raise your hand and says I know that happened to me in my life praise be to God so Satan is confusing and he tries to stop it at the moment of birth then to try to copy so if he can't stop it at the new birth then he which then you try to uh he tries to copy or imitate the manifestations of the Holy Ghost and tries to copy the gifts he probably tries to point us to a sign or a gift or an emotion as the evidence and to get people to trust in the wrong thing avoiding the real New Birth avoiding uh the the real change people gravitate towards the manifestations of the Holy Ghost rather than the Holy Ghost himself as a person coming into your life that becomes confusion as well and I'm going to read a few quotes that show that how Satan can get amongst the people of God and create confusion in the people just by these things that I'm talking about the confusion that he points the people to depend on a sign or to bend on a gift or depend on an emotion as an evidence that you personally have it all those things are manifestations of the Holy Ghost and we see them but they're not to be used as an evidence that you have it and so this creates confusion I wanted to say that he did that through 200 2 000 years Satan worked to bring the things to two extremes extremes a few weeks ago I mentioned a quote he took water baptism to an extreme he took the Trinity to an extreme and he took predestination to extreme and it took the seventh angel he came and he came and tied the loose ends together and he brought the true teaching on all these Mysteries but but what it was is Satan through 2000 years he was taking it to extremes and when he did that he confused the subject and one of the things I brought up to you is the subject of the Holy Ghost the mystery of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the word living and you manifesting you see the reason he had to settle that mystery is because he was in an environment in Pentecost that had taken that to an extreme so much soul that if you feel this feeling if you speak in tongues that's the evidence that you got it and so when I bring true teaching and someone's been raised in that it brings confusion right it confuses the person and God is not the author of confusion so I just wanted to say though that when the seventh angel came and settled all these things when the seventh angel came and settled these Mysteries don't think for a moment that Satan clocked out it's all been settled now the seventh angel came he settled all the Mysteries even the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't think that Satan said okay I'm finished now no he didn't clock out he actually has worked harder to confuse the people he's actually tried to take this message of restoration and settling the Mysteries and tried his hardest the devil is still the devil and he's worked overtime to confuse the people on all these subjects now it's worse because Satan's using quotes he's not only using the Bible but he's using the quotes like he did with Jesus when he was there in the hour of Temptation he was using the Bible against Jesus he was quoting the Bible from the wrong motive and he was actually quoting scriptures but with the wrong motive to it just like the serpent was to Eve he was quoting God's word but he had the wrong motive and he twisted it just a little bit Jesus was tempted by Satan by his own word I tell you when the Bible and when the quotes are in the hands of the devil we are in trouble it's not meant to be interpreted by the devil and Satan can bring Confusion by the very quotes that we have that's why we say I want the Simplicity of Christ I want God to break it to me by Revelation if I don't understand it I'm going to wait there before the Lord until he brings the true revelation of that truth because I'm not going to let Satan tamper with it and interpret it his own way Satan is still on the job and he since the word has been opened the Seven Seals has been opened he's been working overtime to still confuse he's still the author of confusion to bring doubt to bring fear to corrupt Minds from the Simplicity of God's message I know he's out there I know he's still working you know he's still working it's a time for us to say Lord let me just humbly serve you whatever I need to know I trust you're going to give it to me I'm not going to live all week with a mind that's confused and a heart that's depressed and all messed up and every day questioning my experience as I said to you a couple Sundays ago if God's done something in your life hold that up before the devil and say I know God's moved in my life I may not be what be what I want to be but I ain't what I used to be can you say Amen hold that before the enemy because it's of God then you need to celebrate it and worship it and say God what's next for me because I know you moved in my life here but what's next I hope you're saying what's next because there's a lot to come there's an adoption of your life this Holy Ghost has taken us to adoption this Holy Ghost has taken us to a Rapture the same holy ghost that called you is the one that's going to put you in a rapture Hallelujah so he brings doubts and fears and corrupt minds but here's some quotes that I didn't get to last time and we're just going to finish up with this confusion just to show you that there can be confusion about the Holy Ghost he said that many times that first quote there in fellowship if you guys have it many times we make it so complicated with Creeds and different things to deal with different isms and things that we've made up inside of our fleshy mind now he's saying this all the way back friends in 1956 56 many times we make it so complicated with Creeds and different things to deal with different isms and things that we've made up inside of our fleshly mind and we many times through that drive Sinners far away from God oh my goodness I don't want that happening this church is here for the sinner we create an atmosphere for The Sinner you should invite The Sinner but what a tragedy when he comes and it scares the Sinners away just because we have different Creeds and isms and when they come a message among us we have confusion they don't understand what's going on Paul said even about the gifts when he put them in order he said if you come and do an unknown tongue publicly and it's not interpreted the public and The Sinner will say this is a mad group of people they're strange because he don't understand what's being said Paul put it in order said don't do that if it's just an Untold unknown tongue don't do that in public that's for your private prayer life but if there is a tongue let there be an interpretation come in the in the in the in the language they can understand it because God is a god of understanding not gibberish and unknown and Mysteries and The Sinner goes I don't have a clue what's going on here that's why a lot of times they're drawn by the music or they're drawn by the love of the people which is fine but they got to get anchored to the word of God and how sad to walk in even a message church sometimes and they go away and never come back because it's confusion to them look what brother Brown says he said the Sinners Drive the driver Sinners away from God but just make it simple that little children would understand and then I like this part and then it'll lift up Christ and he said I will draw all men unto me that's actually my subject this morning if we just lift up Christ he'll do the drawing that's his promise keep lifting up Christ keep lifting them up and he says when you do that in front of the people I'll draw them in unto me I'll draw The Sinner I'll draw The Prostitute I'll draw everybody who doesn't have a new birth yet I will draw their hearts myself you don't have to force it you don't have to push it you don't have to manipulate it why do I preach that because a lot of atmospheres it's a manipulation it's a force to get people to the altar and I'm gonna tell you brothers and preachers you don't have to do any of that when you're preaching the word just preach the word God will do the drawing oh I wonder why people aren't coming to the altar I wonder why they'd come and preachers us preacher we get complexes sometimes did I do something wrong did I didn't I was I in your mind because people they're just not responding and stuff we got to be careful about trying to take the next step to manipulate because God does the drawing if there's a heart there that's hungry for God already he created that hunger if we preach the word they latch onto that word you don't have to push people to come to the altar a heart that's broken they're going to walk up on their own you say people don't come because they're fearful and they'll be seen not when they're crying out for God they don't care about the other young people they don't care about who sees them because the only thing that comes their heart I need God right now and you'll find them at the altar because they don't care anymore about life and care about what people think they just need what's being preached when are we going to leave it alone and quit manipulating the drawing God says lift me up and I'll draw them unto me oh I wish I could have some heavier amens this morning listen now we've got to be careful how we manhandle what God's gonna do how we manipulate how we force we must take our hands off of the work of the Holy Spirit brother Daryl Ward told me in the offices we were talking about some of these things he said just a few a month or so ago he preached at his home church or brother Donnie's on a Wednesday night he said I was so defeated after that service he said it was the quietest service there was no shouting or dancing or anything people hardly said amen it was just so he said I've I finished up and I was just so doofy that's the worst sermon I've ever preached in my life and I hope you don't mind me sharing this but anyway he said I felt so defeated he said there was no response it just seemed like everything was intellectual and so you can start feeling intimidated by that but see friends we've got to trust the Lord in what he's doing because a lot of preachers would take the next step okay well I better Force an All-Star I better force them up you leave that alone because what he said was when he finished the service somebody in the back balcony said quick quick come and he called him and brother Donnie they went back there someone had died an older sister in the church had passed on I believe was his sister and she died right there just like the The Man passed away in brother branham's meetings and the people got kind of hysterical and he said settled down went down and prayed for him and he was out there was a nurse there they checked him he was out God brought him back to life same thing happened they went back there prayed for him prayed that prayed for the sister and just within she was out like three or four minutes five minutes I can't remember but anyway she came back to they had a couple nurses there they checked it they checked her later they said she was gone she was gone and God just it wasn't a shouting prayer it wasn't a big thing where it just they laid hands after God just bring her back to life we're in and God brought her back to life and see us preachers want me to be honest with you we think why isn't that happening in my church and Donnie Reagan's that's the complexes we get it is happening here people are being healed here and the same God that raises that there is the same God here this morning but you see we start thinking it has to be in a bunch of this and then sometimes it doesn't have to be in that emotion God is doing something and we need to trust what he's doing we need to trust that what I'm preaching now is getting through to somebody they may be on their Journey they may still be resisting I don't know but the work they're here and the Holy Spirit has led him here let her hear for some reason never underestimate what God is doing in the quiet never underestimate what God can do in your prayer Closet in your quiet time reading the word and his presence just come down and you feel that confirmation never underestimate when a man gets delivered of pornography completely delivered of it and it wasn't in church it wasn't all that nobody gets the testimony nobody sees it this is the day of small things where God gets Glory out of small things and the victories in the third poll will not be spread around the world because the third pool is not a public show they may not hear it around the world but yet yet when you praise God said God delivered me God got the glory praise be to God I think we should preach and make this simple that the little children would understand there's some message churches all the people don't understand never mind the children they leave or say I don't have a clue what he was saying what a shame what a shame that is the little children would understand and they'll lift up Christ and he said when you lift me up I if we would just preach Christ and lift him up before the people he said that's where the drawing begins he will do the drawing if we lift something else up if we're promoting our church or a preacher or a movement or any other thing he can't work in that but if we would just preach Christ in Simplicity He will draw them himself men can turn this into a real nervous work of trying to get the people to do something to force them into a Revival to manipulate to fear to use emotions but we don't have to do any of that we don't have to manufacture anything we need to lift Christ up before the people I'd like to tell every preacher including myself let God clean up our motives for preaching let them clean up our pride our complexes are lifting up our own Ministries and just preach this message pure with no agendas and in that in that God will do the work God will draw the people he will he promised to do it Don't Force expectations of the result don't try to force it because God's in your midst and he said if you lift me up then I'll draw the people unto me there's a poll do you ever think about how interesting it is that when we get to the end time then brother Bram takes Jesus ministry and splits it into the three poles we never heard that before and so each one of them was a Paul in other words they felt drawn to the Miracles so it's God something God uses God draws the people the second pull the discernments of heart second poll it's it's a pull in other words it pulls the people it draws that that that fish in it's the it's the bait it draws them in first and second pull and then the third one is called that it's called a poll I've always said it wasn't called the three pushes I'm glad but it was a draw it was a pull it's something God does to use to draw the people's hearts and you're drawn to that hopefully we're drawn to more than just a miracle more than just the first and second poll we're drawn to something deeper today and that's related to you so if you guys would turn that back on I'm going to get to the next quote but hey how many agree let's just preach Christ let's preach the Simplicity of the message let God do the work don't have to work up a Revival my goodness God God can bring it his own way so now to begin with you will notice that in my meetings brother Brown says when I have finished preaching an Evangelistic service or some teaching message I cast the net and I invite a response from the people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I'm inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again so he's going to clear up a doctrinal thing here in a minute but I'm I'm only reading this quote to to show the confusion in a service where you have people that are not doctrinally correct and so now oh he's inviting people come and so they come to the Altar and receive and they're thinking to receive the baptism of Holy Ghost and so they're going to come up and many times they're going to instruct them how to receive it there I've I've been in Services when I little when I was a little boy where they move your mouth and try to get you to speak in tongues and once you do it a little bit they say you got it so now you talk about high level confusion in a service because they weren't taught right they're leaning that person the wrong way and deceiving them because if they didn't get it and they spoke in tongues they'll be deceived the rest of their lives they thought I spoke in terms they said I got it there's no Deliverance of the desires of their heart they still desire the things of the world so he says my Pentecostal friends in doing this and so then he says so when I invite those who those who are Spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones and he's so he's so respectful these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean this in the services has caused a great deal of confusion now I've talked about the confusion of the world we lived in I've talked about Satan confusing a lot of things but now I'm talking about in a service when people aren't taught right there can be Satan working in confusion I'm just saying what he said this has caused a great deal of confusion I want to tell exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same he's clearing up the doctrine of it they separated us two different things and I understand when a person believes have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe but when he invites them up he don't want to invite him up just because they receive a little intellectual he's inviting them to receive the new birth and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is not a separate thing than the baptism the holy ghost in the soul as we get into the subject deeper later on of course you have to talk about the many times he says that the baptism can be on your spirit the baptism to do all the gifts you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost in your spirit 24 hours a day and still die and go to hell wow it's because when his Spirit comes he can do a lot of things and manifest a lot of ways but his purpose is to change that soul to go deep and change the desires of that soul that's what it's there for everybody understand amen so he cleared that up but he also was addressing the confusion in meetings and then he goes on to say here later in 1965. today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can imprison impersonate any of the gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word notice he's associating the evidence of the Holy Ghost of the word coming word by word by word and you never deny that the holy Eagle so never denied it it'll never resist it it'll never turn it away so it's tied the evidence although he goes Holy Ghost is tied to the word not just your Bible but the word that's been spoken by the mouth of prophets that's where the evidence is and so he may impersonate a gift but he cannot bring that word word by word he might bring a few scriptures and then he stops off and says that's that's not right that's not right the days of Miracles have passed and so this is what the proper brings out they'll go with their Bibles but when it comes to God can do Miracles today they drop off you can't do that the Holy Ghost will say amen and go word by word and as it opens up he'll lead you guide you into all truth and with truth is presented to you if it's truth of the Bible the Holy Ghost will identify and say Amen now we're talking the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's where he says that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on false anointed ones are the anointed ones at the end times what he's referred to which is where he settled it they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout and remember not by just some feeling anointed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit to shout dance speak in tongues preach the gospel do you believe a person can preach with the anointing of the the Holy Ghost and still be a false vessel I have some brothers that could preach even this message incredible gifted get anointed to preach it today they're nowhere to be found serving the world what happened they didn't have it in the soul level but boy could they be Anointed with it in their spirit and their gift it's powerful Paul said I can understand all Mysteries and still not have the real thing false anointed ones be Anointed with the spirit speaking tongues shout preach the gospel and still a devil it's the inside I want you guys to leave this up because this last statement says a lot it's the inside now remember Jesus said all the father hath given me will come to me and then he said no man can come except my father draws him both of those statements are taken out of John chapter 6. he says all those things there and if you know your Bible John chapter 6 is when he he multiplied the fishes and lows it was five thousand they were going to make him a king and then as he sat down with him he began to say things that like I and my father are one I am the bread that's come down from heaven he begins to give more of the word to them about who he was uh his seventy that were with him from the beginning and cast out Devils they said this is a hard saying who can hear it they begin to leave him he's left with 12 at the end of the chapter one's a devil and and we realize these is these are the places where Jesus says these things all the father has given me will come no man can come except my father draws him now I want to hone in on that and I try not to be too long here today I'm going to try my best first thing he says is that today there's such confusion on the evidence of Holy Ghost I believe he was called how many believe that brother Branham in the seventh angel Ministry was called to clear up the confusion and to simplify things and so as he's clearing some of the confusion he gets to this end quote because he begins the quote by saying there's so much confusion today about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and I believe these last three statements have a lot of depth to them because I believe it's part of clearing up the confusion and the first thing that he says it's the inside because he's talking about what the baptism can do on the outside and that it can be imitated some of it's real some of its vessels that aren't right he talks about all the and you listen to anointed words at the end time he breaks that down right from the scripture it's a truth revealed in this last hour that we didn't know quite that way that the rain falls on the justice and the whole congregation can be affected in some way when I go into this series I want to show you when he the Holy Ghost descends upon a generation there's a lot of things that God will do but there's there's few in there that's actually getting what the Holy Ghost was sent for it's on the inside because all that he's referring to and the confusion is people gravitating to what the Holy Ghost is doing on the outside but remember I said a couple Sundays ago I was saying that it's from the inside out God's word God works so the real there's a there's a reference to the Holy Spirit when Jesus said in the last day of the feast I don't have it in front of me but in the last day of the feast he says he said the the spirit will come and he says out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so that that uh word picture is something coming from the inside of you going out and then the next scripture says this is referring to the spirit when it comes so when the spirit comes it's actually going to be a work for I know it says they were in the upper room and they are filled with the Holy Ghost because they emptied out but really what's intended to do is it's going to work from the inside out not the outside in and so that which is down there will like be like a rivers of living water flowing from your in innermost being so now we have a distinction it's on the inside so we have to be grown up we have to be mature in the Lord to realize the evidence of the Holy Ghost really in a person's life is not something they're gravity gravitating or something out the outside but it's something that's coming from the inside out not the outside in and that's why he says it's the inside it's the inside we will go through that at length at another time because when the Holy Ghost begins to move many people in fact I'm going to read to you when we get to it I'm going to read to you the first time the Holy Ghost begins to be mentioned in the Book of Matthew and that's the it's at the conception of Jesus Christ he starts using the term and so Simeon and Hannah and uh Joseph receives a dream and he tells them what's conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so that's the first time we hear the term mentioned and it's around it's around the birth of Christ it says something so it's it's not coming just to anoint a prophet now it's not coming to give a feeling now it's coming specifically to bring that conception to bring forth the word and so now but you'll have people affected people having dreams people being shown by the Holy Ghost it says he will show me the Holy Ghost this is the Messiah the Holy Ghost showed him that so but you see now everybody was receiving some of the benefits of the Holy Ghost coming in that era in that time but only one person is conceding the Holy Ghost inside them so the Holy Ghost can do a lot of effect people can feel better after a service even like this people can feel better just by being in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost people can have dreams people can it can have a lot of things can be done but in that day it was only Mary that had the depth of the Holy Ghost conceiving a new life Christ within her so now we draw a distinction because that's going to come from the inside out that's not going to be she's trying to produce something that's going to be that a life started within her a new life is growing within her everybody's still awake and she couldn't stop it and it was without sensation he wasn't with a man it wasn't carnal it wasn't a sexual experience it was the Holy Ghost without sensation she didn't feel anything she just said Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word bang something she didn't feel any of it but a conception started a new life was in her now after a few months as some of her sisters being pregnant then you start to see wow there's another life growing within her that's why I say about the Holy Ghost sometimes you wait to see the fruit from it you wait to see the life that comes see if the desires are changed because you can tell you couldn't tell anything was changed with with Mary until it started to grow she realized the baby starts kicking all these things begin to happen and you realize there's been a change because there's a new life that's growing inside me praise the Lord now we're talking what the Holy Ghost really wants to do from the inside out a new life Christ being formed in you that's the Holy Ghost Beyond an emotion Beyond enjoying the benefits you can be around a congregation and enjoy the benefits for your children and families just by being around the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but do you have it for yourself is New Life conceived in you and is it growing when you have a new life inside of you how can you tell something's happened with a mom sometimes it's something's different she gets cravings for things and Foods she never had cravings for before you will get a craving for the word of God like never before I never had this before I crave I want to be there at church I want to hear I want to get in my Bible it's an Evidence something says change I want it for myself I want to be fed by this word and the and the Cravings come and you have to go sometimes at three in the morning and get that wife what she needs my fir the first baby with Beck and I was Seafood all the time seafood seafood we don't do that anymore but with that baby she craved Seafood so we were at Red Lobster all the time feel like I should own stock and Red Lobster I should have every baby had a different craving some of them I like some of them I didn't like I think it was it was Solomon or Gideon there and the craving was hot fudge cake at Big Boy I love that one that was awesome even if it was three in the morning it tasted great we went we're going because she couldn't finish all of it so we'll get back to that a little bit on the inside but I want to start wrapping it up just on this point he said all the father have given will come predestination clears confusion of the Holy Ghost it should and that is his sons and daughters will come now see we we have to take a rest in that not a rest that we could become lazy to seek the Holy Ghost but arrest that all the father has already given will come so he's clearing up the confusion of this evidence of the Holy Ghost we've got to Anchor to something and it's right in the scripture hey all the father have given will come don't set time frames on it they will all come because they are his sons and daughters Sons and Daughters of God will come and we rest in that it's not our work it's his work so then he says no man can come except my father draws him first and that says to me that it's all him doing it I I know I want to cover some scriptural instruction on our hearts and and what the Holy Ghost is and what it should be and and we realize that in scripture I will show you places that we offer back to God some instruction of if you're seeking the Lord deeper in your life in the Holy Ghost there's instruction the scripture gives and all these words come from the Bible real conviction uh desperation how many knows desperation is tied uh when he preached the token the Holy Ghost then that night he preached desperation Jacob had to get desperate forth so we know we have these things repentance true repentance uh comes before receiving the Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name obedience they he gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey him persistence and persistent asking seeking knocking Jesus said whoever asked and persist in acting and knocking and and going before the Lord it's all in the Bible there you empty yourself out like they did Pentecost that's all things that we offer to God and we do and and you've got to offer a heart to him and you have to be serious about wanting the Holy Spirit I understand but the first truth that we need to knew no is that he will do the drawing he will do the drawing he will do the calling you can't do that he will lead you into this truth is we would never even seek it unless he was doing the drawing first so we preach seek the Holy Ghost get desperate of God and that's what we should do because it takes desperation but you never desire that in a real way until until he was already drawing you to the Holy Ghost so what I say this is all him all the father have given me will come and and he and we must know the truth that no man comes except my father draws him the way brother Brian says draws him first it starts with God drawing you I love this because this is what our text was and I'll probably try to end I wanted to get to Ezekiel 36 so much but I ain't going to get there today remember the scripture said at the text this morning remember it said it talks about we are his workmanship created in Jesus Christ this is a creation of God this is not some feeling you get to make you a better person this is a creation of the Lord and all the father hath given me will come because he's drawing you before there can be a creation there has to be a Creator to create the creation and if you're thirsting tonight for the healing power of God there's got to be a fountain open somewhere or you'd never thirst for it how many alongs for a deeper walk with God every hand up well there's a deeper walk somewhere and you never thirst for it something has created in you a desire to walk closer to God so he's working even before he creates and puts something within you that's why I want to get to Ezekiel 36 because it's the whole process of him coming I'll draw you out of the land of the Heathen out he says I'll sprinkle with you with clean water he hasn't put his spirit in you out he says I'll change your Stony heart I'll soften your heart because you brother Brown says it this way when you're born you don't have even have a heart to get along with God's word so he gives you a soft heart to start getting along before you even receive a spirit he said you can't even hardly get along with one another because of your heart how are you going to get along with God I'll sprinkle with clear water I'll do this I want to get to that scripture so bad I'll do this it's all before a spirit comes he said I'll put a new spirit within you that's not his holy spirit yet he'll give you a new spirit so it can receive the word he said then I will put my spirit within you God's God 's doing it all I'm gonna get something it's because he was drawing you first and he was creating he's speaking to a sister that's in the back seat there and and coming she didn't have to come to the healing line there was something happening back there and she desired it and he pointed back to her and said sister before you even had a desire for that God created a desire for you to be healed before she received her healing something has to be created in you a desire to walk closer to God this is the creation of God the Holy Ghost the holy ghost in your life what he's going to do in your life look at it as a creation of him he's the one that does the work something has created you a desire to be healed by God well before that could be created in your body in your spirit there has to be a creator of that and that Creator is the holy spirit that's why you're here tonight is because the Holy Spirit has led you some of them not saved yet some of them not healed yet not received their healing yet but he's willing to say the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost you don't have the Holy Ghost in your soul yet tonight at the meeting the Holy Ghost is the one who even LED you here and then he starts to work on you and create create a heart that's ready to receive the Holy Ghost what is he doing he's clearing the confusion of us manhandling this to try to put our own evidence and when this happened and this day this I have dates when I know God dealt with me and I know my life has changed but we must be careful because God is drawing us to all of this God prepares the heart to receive the Holy Ghost this isn't a mechanical thing of our own works but we are his workmanship I'm glad this morning that I'm his workmanship and if I'm under the Potter's hand why are we so worried about what we don't have why are we so afraid of what we're lacking if I'm under his workmanship he will create in me what is needed I'm under the Creator I love that the holy spirit is the one who has led you here next Sunday we'll get into Ezekiel 30 see he does the drawing don't manhandle It Don't Force It preachers don't manhandle don't manipulate don't scare the people into the Holy Ghost just preach and let God do the drawing here's another place sometimes they can get confused so many people lots of time has misconstrued the word and been misunderstood by saying by making articles I said I wasn't much on an ultra call Brother Bram has said that I'm not much on an all car not meaning that you shouldn't make an altar call oh boy whatever I was reading could you please give it back to me back okay thank you oh thank the Lord I have staff to help me I said I'm I'm not meaning that you shouldn't make an altar call but he's going to take a stab at and could critique the wrong kind of altar call somebody get somebody by the arm and say oh brother John you know what me and you has been good neighbors all this time come up here at the altar get down all the father had given me will come and no man can come unless I'm already drawing him you're getting involved there trying to make them come out of emotion he said what's he doing which had a Blackboard here I would show you what he's doing he's trying to work through his soul on affections and so in spirit is interchanged with affection of course so he means the spirit there Soul through infections in in 1962 he refers to the spirit as the soul later on it's the body spirit and soul so the inside of the inside but here it's your affections he's trying to work on his affections that don't work that's not the Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's working in what the memory through the sense of his soul Oh Brother John you had a wonderful mother she died a long time ago a memory see you can't do that it's got to come down the line of free moral agency you yourself let the word of God you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because your daddy died or your mom died you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because God calls you to come you don't have to manipulate that you don't have to make that happen lift up Christ and he said I'll draw all men into me it's in everyone's own time can you say amen and what the worst case is God's Not drawing that person yet the worst case is to force that person to try to mechanically do something we encourage them we tell them what they need in their lives if their life is just full of all kinds of messing around with sin and porn and and you you tell them as a pastor you need something you need the holy ghost in your life but never to force them because if that heart's not drawn by God they're not ready but I do believe if they'll begin to say Lord and ask say Lord I know I need this if they'll begin to say that God's all over it you come because that God calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word is what means everything that word can you stand together this morning thank you for your attention all the father had given me will come this is a work of the inside all the father give me and no man can come unless there's already something a creation of God already working to bring them if we know the Lord is in our lives drawing our hearts if this morning I just want to simplify this and say if you've got a calling if you've got something down there that's still drawing you and saying I need more of God you should raise your hand and say thank God that I have that I never gave that to you you didn't give it to yourself there's a lot of you that's been through things that if you're carnally looking at it hurt by the world hurt by people hurt by message preachers just there's a lot of things you've had that really you shouldn't be here a lot of you you shouldn't be here things have happened here you've half lost loved ones and all that and yet and you've had struggles and you've questioned God and you've questioned why did this happen I I Pastor you I know some of those things and it's sometimes they can be so real the devil can really get you off track is this worth it all these other thoughts come all that but listen let's try to let's try to look at what God is doing in our lives that there's some reason that something deep down is resonating and saying I know that I can't ever leave Christ how many raise your hand say there's something that keeps drawing me I've had mental conditions all these other things but something in me keeps drawing me to him that's not you that's not an effort oh I get it better get my wife straightened out I better come and do something or brother Paul is going to preach on me no it has nothing to do with that he's still drawing you and if he's still drawing you whatever you lack he's going to fill you with he's going to give it to you will I be in a Rapture you keep you keep yielding your life to God under this Holy Spirit yes all that God has given are going to be in the rapture now I'm not trying to put you in myself I don't do that but he knows how to put you in a rapture he knows how to draw your heart whatever stays that you're at if you're an eight-year-old boy or girl if you're a 16 year old guy guy or girl and I appreciate these young men and young women standing up here today on the front row with the risk of me spitting in their face that's Brave Girls that's Brave guys but I looked on the monitor in my office I just text Brother Branham praise be to God for the example and how these girls look and what they're manifesting in this age the women and how they look is a reflection of the church it's a reflection of the character of the church and what we preach here it really is we don't have a lot here but listen it's a small number today and it it it and they have sometimes their struggles and the devil beating them up and trying to get their hold on things and battles that we don't know about sometimes and yet God's creating the Creator is creating something within them and if you're in the hands of the Creator his workmanship I bet none of us in this church this morning could deny and say I I'm not under the hand of God I'm under the word his word I bet everybody could raise your hand and say I believe that I'm under his workmanship and if he's in charge if he's under if he's in charge of mode in your life then everything you lack you just offer a heart before God you just say Lord whatever Brother Paul's preaching I'm the holy ghost or any other subject Lord if I need that God please bring it to me make contact with me you say that prayer to God I believe he's if we draw an idea here he'll draw closer to us that's what the Bible says but we've got to rest we can't make the Holy Ghost something that's to be afraid of we have to rest in the things he said is that all the father given will come and nobody will make that move to come unless they're feeling drawn by me I'll create the drawing I'll create the pole and that they'll they'll keep walking towards me maybe slow I got to thinking yesterday growing up today kids don't grow up kids are people can be 40 50 60 years old there's 50 year old men that sit in in a gamer with their video games some living with their mom and dad I got to thinking about that is that type spiritually that we have we have growth today even the church but it's slow growth and it's because of the atmosphere and the people are that way not growing up you know we don't praise old people anymore and wisdom and and things like we don't do that we're supposed to do that we're supposed to look to counsel from older ones that's been there and done that but the Young Generation everybody wants to stay young everybody's nobody wants to grow up she had you know 35 40 year old women that still want to dress like a teenager act like a teenager so if we have that naturally I wonder if we have a slow growth spiritually because of the atmosphere we live in where someone would come and oh my the atmosphere you know there's there's days and I don't try to I don't try to be like this but there's days like back in uh who's the guy who's in Chicago William Booth or the other fellow Spurgeon Moody I think it was and they they told them to get up and test the Acoustics of the Tabernacle and there's a janitor that's hiding back in a seat up in the balcony and he just gets up and goes red pants that's all he said repent and that guy fell under a conviction come down to the altar when he was testing the Acoustics there was so much power of God in one repent that man gave his heart to the Lord that janitor so praise the Lord yeah but you see now you see today we're under a different atmosphere not that the Holy Ghost isn't the same but listen you have to have a care for what God's doing in a person's life now I'm going to take a section of this study and talk about the scripture that says Stephen just just said you're resisting the Holy Ghost as your fathers did they were resisting that's not a good position to be in but I'm going to say most of you aren't that in position this morning you're not in that position I would I would hope to say so now we have to be careful because it's a slow growth today where people but if they're under the workmanship of God it doesn't matter the time if they're under the workmanship and they're yielding to him God's going to give them everything that they need if they stay in the right atmosphere if they stay in the right Fellowship that they stay in the word of God and God can keep drawing them God's going to give you everything that you need how many believe that this morning want to make this simple because the devil has confused it I want to make it that you hold on to that peace this morning that if there's something's going to happen in me it's kind of like uh when they call Jesus good and he said there's none good but God anything good that's coming out of me he's created it within me any walk with the Lord that I have it's because he's created in me any desire that I have he's created it in me and I'm under the Creator now and I'll be under the Creator tomorrow and whatever he needs to keep creating in me I'm going to let him create anything he wants in me pray Heavenly Father as this song says oh Lord send your power send your spirit Among Us Lord we pray God I pray that if a heart is searching for you or for they've served you for many years I pray Lord that we would just be strengthened today to rest in what your work is doing Lord we're not someone else's workmanship we're not our own workmanship we are your workmanship you're doing this Lord now the father if I ran away today and I got out of your presence and I just went and did my own thing it's difficult for you to deal with me even though Lord if you love me and I'm your child you're going to bring me back it may be hard but you're going to bring me back but Lord I don't feel in my heart to do that this morning I want to stay where the blessings are flowing stay where you can deal with me stay where I can be molded I want to stay in The Potter's House so the Potter can mold me into what I should be so today we're not running from you Lord we're here and we are your workmanship we ask you to continue to give what's needed we sometimes emphasize way too much Lord we think we know what a person needs but Lord only you know what we need in our lives and you'll provide it Lord you've already provided it but Lord you'll draw us and keep drawing us and keep drawing us until Lord we'll see we have a slow growth today it's a it's a it seems like a stunning growth and Lord we have so many influences that are before our eyes our phones are in front of us and our in there's influences all around us Lord so a lot of times the growth is slowed down because somebody is just maybe feeding on too much of the wrong things Lord lead them away from that today may they be put in a place that you can keep drawing them closer and closer to you we yield to you our hearts Lord and we believe that you that began a good work in US will be faithful to complete it We Believe Lord that if everyone would fall beside us and they'd fall away if they're yours they're going to come back but if they fell we're not depending on one another we're going to hold on to you through all things commit these precious lives to you today these young people the
