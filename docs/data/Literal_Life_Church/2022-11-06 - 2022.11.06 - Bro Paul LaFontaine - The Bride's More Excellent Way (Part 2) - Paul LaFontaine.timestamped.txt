[0:00] came by and spoke for us and there's a
[0:02] couple of children's books this one we
[0:03] have in the library this is a new one by
[0:05] a sister in Chicago so those that have
[0:07] young children check those out in the
[0:09] library there this is a coloring book
[0:11] and this is a nice little story she did
[0:13] with illustration if you're looking for
[0:15] materials to read to the kids those are
[0:17] really nice check those out in the
[0:18] library after church today
[0:20] First Corinthians 12 and 31 it's just
[0:23] one scripture and we'll continue talking
[0:25] about the more excellent way the bride's
[0:28] more excellent way and Paul mentions it
[0:30] in the Bible here first Corinthians 12
[0:32] and verse 31 he says but covet earnestly
[0:36] the best gifts and the reason that Paul
[0:38] mentions the gifts of the Spirit is
[0:41] because he's just spent several chapters
[0:44] talking about the gifts and not just
[0:46] talking about gifts that work in the
[0:47] church but he's actually correcting how
[0:50] they were using them and making sure
[0:51] they're in order and making sure it
[0:53] doesn't get off track and there's
[0:55] another reason Paul corrects it is that
[0:57] we tend to when we have the gifts we
[0:59] tend to get just a bit carnal with them
[1:00] in that we lean on something the gifts
[1:03] more than they More Than The Giver of
[1:06] the gifts and that's car that's human
[1:08] tendency is that when you have a gift if
[1:11] you have a big display of Miracles and
[1:13] signs and wonders which Our God can do
[1:15] we've had here in the church cancer
[1:18] healed we've had testimony is around the
[1:21] world of the Dead being raised you say
[1:23] well my I don't ever hear that well it's
[1:25] happening because Jesus Christ is the
[1:26] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:29] able to do everything he's ever done
[1:31] before he's able to do it this morning
[1:33] again so you can imagine now your habit
[1:35] that you have you think you'll never
[1:37] overcome nothing is too hard for the
[1:39] Lord
[1:40] if he can heal the sick he can raise the
[1:42] dead still then God can do anything this
[1:44] morning and so you see then that that
[1:47] Paul is not only talking about coveting
[1:50] the best gifts he's never eliminating
[1:52] the gifts but there's a tendency in
[1:54] human beings to gravitate towards the
[1:56] visible into the manifestations and to
[1:58] the healings and the physical things and
[2:01] we get you know excited rah-rah about it
[2:03] but our tendency is to cling to seeing
[2:07] the gifts and not have a relationship
[2:10] with The Giver
[2:11] and and not have the substance of what
[2:15] the giver wants to bring from our lives
[2:17] and what he wants to bring from our
[2:19] lives is not just Miracles and signs and
[2:22] wonders and signs following life he's
[2:24] wanting to bring Holy Ghost manifested
[2:27] Divine love
[2:30] from our lives and this is what Paul
[2:32] refers to now as he says covet earnestly
[2:35] the best gifts all you Corinthians yet
[2:38] show I unto you a more excellent way
[2:42] and then he takes the next chapter and
[2:44] he begins to explain the more excellent
[2:46] way and that's what we're going to by
[2:48] the grace of God do this morning if you
[2:50] give attention to the Lord I believe it
[2:51] will be a blessing to you thank you
[2:53] Father for to be back with my family
[2:56] again today Lord and we know we've been
[2:58] here Lord in the city but we just when
[3:01] we gather together it's something
[3:03] special in our hearts because we know
[3:04] that we share something Kindred in our
[3:07] Spirits Lord we share you and we share
[3:09] the word we share the message of the
[3:11] last days and Lord we have something in
[3:13] common and we are also sharing the fact
[3:16] Lord that we're thirsty for more of you
[3:18] and Lord I pray you'll bless every soul
[3:20] lord Every Soul here listening whether
[3:22] it be online or here in the building is
[3:24] so important to you and Lord
[3:27] that Soul was so important that you went
[3:30] to Calvary for them you opened up a
[3:32] fountain for them and Lord we're
[3:34] thankful for that we pray that you'll
[3:36] get across your word this morning may
[3:38] The Vessel step out of the way and may
[3:40] you be able to bring us into a deeper
[3:42] mention of yourself and learn of you for
[3:45] you said I am meek and lowly you said
[3:47] learn of me come unto me all that are
[3:50] weary and heavy laden and I will give
[3:52] you rest Lord we just look to you this
[3:55] morning and speak through US Lord we
[3:57] pray speak to every heart no matter what
[4:00] they've come from no matter what what
[4:02] place they've come from today what
[4:04] background meet them today I pray in
[4:07] Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[4:10] seated
[4:12] hmm
[4:16] if they wanted to bring that PowerPoint
[4:18] out which which button do I push here
[4:20] I'm I'm new at all this but
[4:24] the big button and which do I point it
[4:26] to do I point it to brother Bob here or
[4:28] where do I point him
[4:29] up to you Genie
[4:42] this you know this always happens to me
[4:44] not the other preachers it always
[4:46] happens to me because I'm technically
[4:48] challenged so here's I want to begin
[4:50] with something uh that William Branham
[4:53] said the first quote here and and he's
[4:56] referring to this scripture Paul talking
[4:59] up to the Corinthians about the more
[5:00] excellent way and I just the the reason
[5:03] I brought it into a PowerPoint is I
[5:05] wanted to bring some of the quotes in
[5:06] this PowerPoint and also I wanted to
[5:08] bring this in a teaching because today
[5:10] the Lord willing I want to break down
[5:12] the more excellent way I want to break
[5:14] down the attributes of this love and in
[5:17] order to do that I just want to open it
[5:18] with just this quote and William Branham
[5:20] was a had a powerful Ministry in the 50s
[5:23] and 60s and we believe that he fulfilled
[5:25] scripture even to bring us back to Bible
[5:27] faith if you're interested in hearing
[5:29] more of that which certainly would share
[5:30] anyone here would share more of that
[5:32] with you but I'm going to read from what
[5:34] something he said in a sermon and it's
[5:37] just a powerful thing and as he refers
[5:39] to Paul correcting the Corinthians he
[5:41] says listen at that Stern old Apostle
[5:45] drive it into this Sensational church
[5:47] now he told he called the Corinthians a
[5:50] sensational church and that means they
[5:52] were more about sensation than they were
[5:54] substance and he said listen to this old
[5:57] Stern old Apostle drive it into this
[5:59] Sensational Church who is basing their
[6:02] hopes upon sensation now this is Sunday
[6:04] school this is a place of Correction
[6:06] this is a place of teaching and woe unto
[6:09] the man that will stand in the pulpit
[6:11] and mislead I'm going to say I want to
[6:13] repeat that woe unto the man that would
[6:15] stand in the pulpit and mislead the
[6:17] people
[6:18] I think we should teach balanced solid
[6:21] Doctrine and not lean any other way as
[6:23] brother George was saying on Wednesday
[6:25] night we need a balance can you say amen
[6:27] and so on to the man they'll stand the
[6:29] pulpit and mislead brother it's time
[6:30] that we've made Spirit compared with
[6:32] scripture that's right and though I
[6:34] bestow all my goods to feed the poor
[6:36] Paul said though I give my body to be
[6:38] burned and have not charity it
[6:40] prevaileth me nothing see all your good
[6:42] works all your good deeds all the
[6:45] spiritual things you have all the gifts
[6:48] you have all the sensations you have all
[6:50] the joy you have all the peace you have
[6:52] has nothing at all to do with it to
[6:54] begin with think of that just a moment
[6:56] and think of the churches today our
[6:58] great churches Presbyterian methodists
[7:01] Baptists and denominational they think
[7:04] because they say I Believe come in put
[7:07] your name on the book and that settles
[7:09] it that settles it how far they're off
[7:11] and so there is dealing with just coming
[7:13] and putting your name on a book and
[7:15] that's good enough then he goes into the
[7:16] Pentecostals and the next one he says
[7:19] our Pentecostal people think well
[7:21] because they got a little sensation they
[7:23] felt good they spoke with tongues they
[7:25] got a blood in their hand oil in their
[7:27] face or something we got it we got it oh
[7:30] 10 million miles off you get it see how
[7:32] the devil as the God of this world has
[7:34] blinded the eyes of those and they just
[7:37] go right on living like that listen for
[7:39] although I bestow all my goods to feed
[7:42] the poor though I give my body to be
[7:44] burned and have not charity I am nothing
[7:46] look at all those gifts all those good
[7:49] things I feed the poor I got a good
[7:51] heart about me I do this I do that I go
[7:54] to church I speak with tongues I
[7:56] prophecy I prophesy I heal the sick I
[7:59] preach the gospel I do these things Paul
[8:02] said Still Still I am nothing all those
[8:06] things can be carnally impersonated
[8:10] the devil can imitate all of these good
[8:13] works and that's why when you come to
[8:15] the Lord and come to the message of the
[8:17] last days it's not just books and tapes
[8:20] and good works and wearing the right
[8:21] dress and wearing the right clothes can
[8:23] you say man you've got to have the
[8:25] substance of the Holy Ghost living in
[8:27] you
[8:28] or and because why do you have to have
[8:31] Holy Ghost love why do you have to have
[8:33] the substance of the Holy Ghost because
[8:35] true Holy Ghost love cannot be imitated
[8:38] cannot be impersonated but all these
[8:40] gifts they can be impersonated
[8:43] so if you just have the gift Satan can
[8:45] impersonate them now once again Paul's
[8:47] not dumping out the gifts he's not
[8:49] dumping out going to church he's not
[8:51] dumping out the tongues and
[8:52] interpretation he's not saying any of
[8:54] that he's just saying that if you live
[8:56] on that and don't have the substance and
[8:58] have not charity it doesn't mean
[9:00] anything
[9:01] is everybody everybody understand what
[9:03] Paul's saying and so now we have to be
[9:05] careful that our emphasis is on the
[9:08] right thing because we could emphasize
[9:10] the wrong thing and not get to the
[9:12] substance ourselves personally Even in
[9:15] our in our ranks around the message of
[9:16] the last days we can swing and it's
[9:19] interesting the way the prophet brought
[9:20] it there as he swings to the
[9:22] intellectual and he says you could put
[9:24] your name on the church book and say I'm
[9:26] fine that's all I need to do that's the
[9:28] intellectual side as long as I believe
[9:30] all the mysteries of the Bible that's
[9:32] fine all the Mysteries revealed and then
[9:34] he swings in the rest of the quote to
[9:35] the other side and Pentecost will say
[9:37] because I shouted because I smoke in
[9:39] tongues because I had a sensation I'm
[9:41] fine I'm good and Paul all the way back
[9:44] two thousand years ago is saying you can
[9:46] swing either way and not have the right
[9:49] thing
[9:51] how many want the right thing this
[9:52] morning
[9:53] amen so now this more excellent way is
[9:57] for the Bride of Jesus Christ in the
[9:59] last days if all the Corinthians back
[10:01] then didn't catch it this bride is
[10:03] called to Capstone love this bride is
[10:06] called to find this more excellent way
[10:09] my Hunger is that I find this more
[10:11] excellent way
[10:13] more so than a gift more than preaching
[10:15] more than singing more than doing good
[10:17] works I want to find this more excellent
[10:20] way because Paul preached it and I
[10:22] believe at the end time is when this
[10:23] bride comes into that atmosphere to
[10:26] manifest Divine love
[10:29] so we shouldn't leave on just live on
[10:32] just what we do as good works and so now
[10:34] Paul he's going to break things down in
[10:36] the most beautiful words I believe about
[10:38] agape love that's ever been said I
[10:41] believe he's going to be begin to
[10:42] express what is this in First
[10:44] Corinthians 13 and many of you have read
[10:46] it probably everybody's read it and see
[10:49] so what is what this what is Paul's
[10:51] going to bring is the evidence of this
[10:53] mature Capstone love and what it looks
[10:56] like in our everyday life what it looks
[10:59] like in a Christian's life
[11:01] he's going to begin to break down the
[11:04] attributes of this Capstone love and
[11:06] what it looks like in our life and most
[11:09] of it is manifested towards others
[11:13] we know we love God can you say Amen but
[11:17] it's it's it's when we what we're
[11:20] expressing in Christ is not meant just
[11:22] to express to God but it's to be
[11:24] expressed and manifested to everyone
[11:26] else
[11:28] and also it's to be expressed to very
[11:31] difficult situations meeting up with
[11:34] difficult people and a lot of times you
[11:36] think you're thinking of somebody
[11:37] outside the boss or something or the
[11:39] lady who who uh drove by you and got mad
[11:42] at you because you you stayed too long
[11:44] at the red light because you were
[11:46] texting and she comes by and gives you
[11:48] the wrong finger and all that stuff you
[11:51] see but you think it's people like that
[11:53] we need to love that person anyway but
[11:54] the greatest challenge is the people we
[11:56] live with every day
[11:59] because we know them so well and they
[12:01] they know how to get our gizzard they
[12:03] know how to say the right things
[12:07] so this comes down to everyday life and
[12:09] and I've been thinking a lot I think I'm
[12:11] going to preach a sermon about what is
[12:13] the attraction on the mountain as as our
[12:16] Prophet brings that whole uh thing of
[12:19] what was the attraction and he brings it
[12:21] through the Bible and shows that when
[12:23] God did something it was on the mountain
[12:24] Moses brought the word in the mountain
[12:26] and he brings it all through the Bible
[12:28] and Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and
[12:30] Jesus on Mount Calvary it was always on
[12:33] a mount something glorious happening on
[12:35] the mount and what he said what's the
[12:37] attraction on the mountain God's word
[12:38] being fulfilled that's a pretty big
[12:40] attraction and and and we are we get
[12:43] excited about it matter of fact when he
[12:45] come on occult on a little horse there
[12:47] and he come out of the mountain and
[12:49] begin to come out on the mountain olives
[12:51] they were rejoicing it was a rejoicing
[12:53] time they were shouting here he comes
[12:55] and some people were saying who is this
[12:57] they're saying this is the Messiah and
[12:59] here he comes humbly on a coat like
[13:01] Zechariah said he would come he's riding
[13:03] on a coat and they're laying down all
[13:05] the bushes in front of them and they're
[13:06] rejoicing praise be to God he's here so
[13:09] it was a great rejoicing time as he come
[13:11] out of the mount but you see he's coming
[13:12] out of the mount and Jesus knew it's a
[13:15] great rejoicing time you're enjoying me
[13:17] the word being fulfilled but Jesus knew
[13:20] they didn't know but Jesus knew he was
[13:22] headed right down to a great valley and
[13:25] that's to go to Calvary
[13:28] so here's what I've been thinking about
[13:29] and I don't want to say too much because
[13:31] I'll give my sermon away
[13:35] we've been rejoicing for years and the
[13:37] attraction on the mountain because in
[13:38] our day he brought his word in a
[13:40] mountain
[13:42] again
[13:44] and we can rejoice and we can have a
[13:46] great time and we can Rejoice that God's
[13:48] word being fulfilled but when the
[13:49] mountain is over with you've got to come
[13:51] down in the valley when Moses come back
[13:53] out of the glory of God come down the
[13:54] mountain the people were actually
[13:56] rejecting and sinning and all these
[13:58] other things so now the word that was
[14:00] brought had to deal with situations down
[14:02] in the valley you may be able to enjoy
[14:05] the mountain and the glory of God but
[14:07] can you live love in the valley
[14:13] there's the attraction on the mountain
[14:15] but then there's the life in the valley
[14:19] and a lot of people for years in message
[14:21] conventions could shout and glorify God
[14:24] in the revelation of the word being
[14:26] fulfilled but when they come down to
[14:28] into everyday life they didn't have the
[14:30] substance to live everyday life
[14:34] didn't expect too many amens on that one
[14:37] the attraction on the mountain is just
[14:39] that it's an attraction and attraction
[14:41] of God for fulfilling his word is highly
[14:43] attractive and very exciting
[14:47] but the valley is not very exciting
[14:51] the Valley's scary sometimes
[14:53] and the valley has a lot of people that
[14:56] treat us wrong
[14:57] so most of these attributes now are
[14:59] going to be manifesting Christ's Divine
[15:01] Capstone love manifesting it to others
[15:06] mostly to others so we're going to talk
[15:09] about
[15:10] there's 15 characteristics
[15:13] in this love and I don't want you to
[15:16] read them as if this is some type of
[15:18] code to live by or sometimes if I can
[15:20] just do this and get the what would
[15:22] Jesus do bracelet and if I can be more
[15:24] like him and imitate these things don't
[15:27] approach these things this way because
[15:29] Divine love is not something that we put
[15:31] on
[15:32] it only comes by him who is Love by the
[15:35] Holy Ghost but when we have the Holy
[15:38] Ghost if we'll break down our walls and
[15:41] are Prejudiced and all the things and
[15:43] our hurts from the past and be free this
[15:46] is what comes out of Capstone love
[15:52] here it goes
[15:54] and I'm going to break all these down it
[15:55] might take me three or four weeks but
[15:57] I'm going to break them down
[15:58] and you might it might not be a shouting
[16:01] service although it should be
[16:04] why should it be that you would shout
[16:07] what I'm preaching on the moral
[16:08] excellent way because it is the more
[16:10] excellent way
[16:11] I can preach anything today I can preach
[16:13] anything in that Bible these signs shall
[16:15] follow that and then that believe I can
[16:17] preach all of it and because we have a
[16:19] five-fold Ministry we're going to hear
[16:20] all of those things but for this pastor
[16:23] right now I'm going to preach the more
[16:25] excellent way because the bride is
[16:27] supposed to come into a more excellent
[16:28] way can I get an amen and guess what
[16:31] this is the more excellent way it's not
[16:34] that we speak squirrels into existence
[16:36] it's not just that we we have all these
[16:39] other things this is what Paul pointed
[16:41] to as the more excellent way this is the
[16:45] attributes of a Christian who truly has
[16:48] the Holy Ghost
[16:50] everybody's still on board
[16:53] love is patient
[16:56] love divine love is kind
[17:00] love
[17:02] is not jealous
[17:05] love does not brag or boast
[17:09] this Divine capsule love is not proud or
[17:13] arrogant this Divine love is not rude to
[17:17] anybody
[17:20] it's the amens just start falling off
[17:24] falling off it just becomes like
[17:27] complete silence
[17:30] I said love is not rude to somebody else
[17:36] love is not
[17:40] self-seeking
[17:43] I got to go to the next train because
[17:45] next screen because there's more
[17:48] that's only half of them
[17:50] but I feel like I need to hit the altar
[17:52] now
[17:56] love is not easily provoked to anger
[18:02] Divine Capstone love does not keep a
[18:05] record of others wrongs
[18:09] Divine Capstone love does not rejoice
[18:12] with injustices or iniquity
[18:16] it doesn't gloat or get happy over some
[18:19] injustice that's done and they got what
[18:21] come what's coming to them they did that
[18:24] they do not rejoice with injustices or
[18:26] iniquity love rejoices in something it
[18:29] rejoices when truth prevails
[18:32] love bears and protects things that's
[18:36] what Bears all things means it means to
[18:38] protect things love protects things love
[18:40] bears all things we're going to find out
[18:41] the meaning of that it's hard for me not
[18:43] to go into the meanings right now but I
[18:45] just want you to see them all love bears
[18:47] and protects all things and remember now
[18:49] I'm not making this up when Paul said
[18:51] I'm going to show you a more excellent
[18:52] way this is the more excellent way
[18:56] it's not another gift it's not another
[18:58] meeting it's not another rise in a
[19:00] healing campaign this is the more
[19:02] excellent way
[19:04] love bears and protects love love
[19:07] believes the best of things first
[19:11] love always has hope for all things and
[19:15] love endures and holds up during
[19:18] difficulties
[19:21] amen
[19:24] so now we could just close the service
[19:26] right now and have a prayer line
[19:29] but it would be a prayer line
[19:31] to get this
[19:35] because this is a more excellent way
[19:37] no offense now we we have so many needs
[19:41] we we have sickness that's come that's
[19:44] why God gave us an atonement through his
[19:46] atonement he gave us his blood he gave
[19:48] us the stripes upon his back for our
[19:49] healing how many still believe in that
[19:51] I'm dealing with my my wrist this
[19:53] morning is completely gone out I'm in
[19:55] pain right now with it I'm praying for
[19:57] God to heal it while I'm preaching right
[19:58] now this morning I need all the
[20:01] atonement I need physical healing I need
[20:03] emotional healing God's provided for all
[20:05] of it
[20:07] can you say Amen we need healing lines
[20:09] sometimes we need the gifts the gifts
[20:11] are what keep the church clean brother
[20:12] Brown says we need those things but Paul
[20:15] shows a more excellent way we don't want
[20:17] to jump to emphasizing all those things
[20:20] and neglecting the most important part
[20:22] and that's this excellent way this this
[20:24] Dimension that we come into this love
[20:26] that we come into this is him it's not
[20:30] another theory to live by it's not a
[20:32] theory it's this what I read to you is
[20:34] not a code to live by it's not it it's
[20:37] not a code it's Christ in action by
[20:41] Divine Holy Ghost love this is the
[20:44] person of Christ manifested in our lives
[20:47] this part is the is part of the
[20:49] threefold purpose of God which was we
[20:52] know the threefold purpose of God was is
[20:54] to manifest himself to man to come in be
[20:57] man and then for him to get the
[20:59] preeminence in the church how many know
[21:01] that's the third part of the great
[21:03] mystery of God is for him to get the
[21:06] preeminence in the church and I'll tell
[21:08] you when you've come into that Divine
[21:10] love he's going to have the preeminence
[21:12] in your life over all things he's going
[21:14] to conquer all things
[21:16] through love
[21:18] because love is the greatest force in
[21:20] the world holy ghost Capstone love is
[21:23] the greatest there is no demon that's
[21:25] greater than Divine love love cast out
[21:29] all fear love will cast out demons
[21:33] there isn't no problem in your life that
[21:36] the Divine love of God cannot overcome
[21:40] it's greater than a gift well I overcome
[21:43] him with a gift I'll go be prayed for by
[21:45] a minister that's wonderful but this is
[21:47] greater because he can through Divine
[21:49] love he can conquer the worst of your
[21:51] enemies the worst of your troubles
[21:54] there isn't any divorce in this Divine
[21:56] love
[21:58] there isn't splitting up in this Divine
[22:00] love
[22:01] that's carnal that's the world filial
[22:04] love which is another kind of love as we
[22:06] break down from Divine love we break
[22:08] down break down till we have sexual love
[22:10] and then we have perverted love today
[22:12] what Satan calls love and all this
[22:14] perverted love we have in the world but
[22:15] the best of love the best of Love is
[22:17] Capstone love and that's Agape Love Can
[22:20] you say man filial love with a husband
[22:23] and wife have filial love if a man
[22:25] insults his wife he's ready to kill for
[22:27] he's ready he's ready to get put that
[22:30] man and get him in an alley and do
[22:32] something to him you don't insult my
[22:33] life
[22:34] my wife but
[22:37] agape love says
[22:40] don't do that but I'm going to pray for
[22:42] you I want to pray for your lost soul
[22:44] it goes deeper
[22:47] a lot of marriages have filial love but
[22:49] they don't have agape love
[22:52] Amen brother Paul
[22:55] this is when the god Christ has
[22:57] preeminence in the church this is what
[22:59] Paul's laying down even in a prophecy in
[23:02] First Corinthians 13 this is coming
[23:03] there's coming today he will have full
[23:06] preeminence in the church this person of
[23:08] love will be expressed this love will be
[23:10] pre the preeminent thing at the end all
[23:13] the others stuff all the other things
[23:15] will fade with the bride and will no
[23:18] longer be the emphasis and I'm quoting
[23:20] scripture now because he he says in
[23:23] First Corinthians 13. we prophesy in
[23:26] part and we we have these things in part
[23:28] but one day that which is perfect what
[23:31] is come will come and that which is in
[23:33] part will be done away not that it's
[23:35] eliminated but we come to the more
[23:37] excellent way the greatest of these is
[23:40] Charity the greatest of these is divine
[23:43] love
[23:44] all the other stuff will fade with the
[23:46] bride and will no longer be the emphasis
[23:48] I can safely say that I've seen the
[23:51] prophecy of the faith of the original
[23:52] book of Pentecost and the book of Acts
[23:55] restored in my lifetime I've seen it
[23:58] restored to the church with the signs
[24:00] following the Believers I have watched
[24:02] that for years it's not something coming
[24:04] we're living in the original faith of
[24:06] Pentecost we've been restored back to
[24:08] the original faith of Pentecost it has
[24:10] been expressed now for many years but
[24:12] there's one thing that still needs
[24:14] manifested more if you'll agree with me
[24:16] this morning there's one thing that
[24:18] still needs more manifestation and see
[24:21] it come to Perfection and that's Divine
[24:23] love it's token love
[24:26] it's true Holy Ghost love
[24:30] there's one quote and I don't have it up
[24:32] here but it's just very small and he
[24:34] says
[24:35] so did the Pentecostal people but the
[24:38] Pentecostal people as great as they had
[24:39] it they begin to organize in the Oneness
[24:42] and threeness and trinitarians and all
[24:45] kinds of an organization now can you
[24:47] imagine a church in Souza Street on so
[24:50] powerful the restoration of the gifts so
[24:53] many manifestations dead on gifts all
[24:56] over going on and yet he says it ends up
[24:59] in division
[25:02] it ends up in different denominations
[25:05] and then he goes he says it splits into
[25:07] Oneness and threeness and trinitarians
[25:10] we didn't think Pentecost would do that
[25:11] but they did all kinds of organizations
[25:13] and then he says and fussing and pulling
[25:16] at one another and it proved that the
[25:20] token wasn't showing
[25:23] malice Envy strife
[25:27] but that's what it got to
[25:29] now friends I'm going to be very careful
[25:31] what I say but here he's pointing to a
[25:34] group that have all the gifts flowing
[25:36] and manifesting but because they had
[25:38] malice and envy and strife and fussing
[25:41] with one another he said it shows the
[25:43] token the Holy Ghost isn't showing
[25:50] oh my I'm gonna get myself in trouble
[25:54] you can have all that manifesting and
[25:57] still not have the token but I thought
[25:59] the token produced those things it does
[26:00] produce those things but more than
[26:02] anything else it'll produce Divine love
[26:06] for God and for one another and he said
[26:09] if you see fussing and stewing and
[26:11] division going on in the body of Christ
[26:13] and preachers fighting with preachers
[26:15] and fighting back and forth on Doctrine
[26:17] and going back and forth across their
[26:19] Pulpit it shows that something's missing
[26:21] something's not quite there yet
[26:24] we're not there yet we haven't come to a
[26:26] victory in Divine love yet
[26:32] shows the token isn't showing so if you
[26:34] have somebody who's got about 10 years
[26:36] of fussing and stewing and he's
[26:37] preaching this message but he's fussing
[26:39] and stewing with preachers and debating
[26:41] and going on I can say I don't know if
[26:44] the token's showing there yet
[26:47] preaching gifted and preach like an
[26:49] angel
[26:50] but the token's not showing
[26:53] because it's fussing and it's envy and
[26:56] strife and Malice
[26:59] this is God's holy ghost reaction to
[27:02] What life will give you and how people
[27:05] treat you
[27:07] it's God's response to things
[27:10] this is God's
[27:13] Holy Ghost God living a person God's
[27:16] Divine love
[27:18] reaction and response
[27:22] to what life dishes you out
[27:26] it's not how your boss responds it's not
[27:28] how you would respond carnally it's not
[27:30] what the first thought that comes to
[27:33] your mind sometimes and what to do to
[27:34] somebody
[27:35] this is God's reaction
[27:38] this is God's love manifesting
[27:41] so it's God's response to things I'm
[27:43] throwing out some things what this
[27:45] Divine love is and I'll come to this
[27:46] later because I'm going to get back to
[27:48] breaking down some of these attributes
[27:50] it's the reason I keep elaborating is I
[27:53] want you to know don't put this in some
[27:54] psychological uh thing that we do and
[27:57] here's okay those 15 things there'll be
[27:59] people in here that lean towards uh uh
[28:02] more left-brained people that say okay
[28:04] let me write those down and I am going
[28:06] to send this out to you and and print
[28:08] some of these out because I know some
[28:09] people like to have the scriptures and
[28:11] quotes I'm going to do that for you but
[28:12] some people they're bent towards okay 15
[28:14] there's 15 things love does this it does
[28:16] this it does this and does that okay if
[28:19] I can just do that this week I'm going
[28:20] to call this person because I need to do
[28:22] this more to them this is not psychology
[28:25] and I Don't Preach psychology I preach
[28:28] the Holy Ghost but I also believe when
[28:31] you get emptied out and filled in your
[28:34] spirit with the Holy Ghost
[28:35] this is the excellent way that you'll be
[28:37] manifesting by Holy Ghost Capstone love
[28:42] so it's not just oh oh if I could just
[28:44] no no no it's saying Lord I want to know
[28:47] that I have your spirit Within Me and
[28:50] whatever's clouding the way I want to
[28:52] see these I want to see this image
[28:54] manifested more in my life
[28:57] and I lay my life before you remember
[29:00] what the prophet said about idolatry he
[29:02] said in the Old Testament when they had
[29:03] idolatry and still today he said they
[29:06] would bow down before an image there was
[29:09] a a frog or some type of image in a
[29:11] statue and they would get down and they
[29:13] bow before it and they believe that
[29:15] they've worshiped that image that that
[29:17] image that God would come in that image
[29:19] and speak back to them he said in
[29:21] Christianity we're not what we're bowing
[29:24] before is the image of Jesus Christ
[29:27] right and so now we're not looking for
[29:30] something to speak back to us he says we
[29:32] bow before the perfect image of Jesus
[29:33] Christ we yield to it we lay before him
[29:36] this these characteristics say Lord
[29:38] there's your image and as I bow down in
[29:41] my heart before it speak it back through
[29:44] me
[29:46] because I want to be the image I want to
[29:48] be the statue of a perfect man can I get
[29:51] an amen
[29:52] praise the Lord so this is I'm I'm
[29:55] separating this from any kind of uh
[29:58] thing that we just do and put on but no
[30:01] this is and also we want to go into this
[30:03] this is also an atmosphere
[30:06] uh
[30:07] uh I'm gonna throw this out to you that
[30:10] in 1955 and 1956 there were several
[30:14] incidences that the prophet began to
[30:16] share that happened in his life
[30:18] and they were an atmosphere that come
[30:21] over him when he had extreme demons
[30:23] coming after him and also animals that
[30:27] could have destroyed him
[30:29] you know the stories and we'll read them
[30:31] because a lot of our young Generations
[30:32] don't know him but they're not just
[30:34] stories but there are times when he said
[30:37] at that moment when there was a killer
[30:39] Bowl it was a killer Bowl in the field
[30:40] and he was caught in the field and the
[30:42] bull was headed towards him he said
[30:44] something came over him
[30:46] and instead of hating that he said he
[30:48] began to have this overwhelming love
[30:50] back towards it and that love had an
[30:52] atmosphere and by the time that bowl got
[30:55] to him he in boldness said in the name
[30:58] of Jesus Christ Bo I didn't come to
[31:00] bother the area I I love you I'm sorry
[31:02] for coming into your field but in the
[31:04] name of Jesus Christ before you get to
[31:06] me you bow and you lay down in front of
[31:08] me and as soon as it got to him
[31:10] something come over him something come
[31:12] over the bowl and he laid down when he
[31:14] was mowing the grass a big Hornet's
[31:16] bee's nest was stirred up and he says
[31:18] I'm sorry for doing that he said
[31:20] something come over him and instead of
[31:22] getting angry or running or whatever we
[31:24] do he loved it and spoke to the bees
[31:29] and there was more than just words there
[31:30] because something got across to the bees
[31:33] I didn't mean to do that he loved them
[31:35] and they all turned around not one sting
[31:37] turned around and went back in back into
[31:39] the ground
[31:41] he said a maniac went on the platform
[31:43] while he was praying for the sick and he
[31:44] says I'm going to tear you to pieces I'm
[31:46] gonna I'll show you I'll break every
[31:48] bone in your body tonight demon
[31:49] possessed man and he said something come
[31:52] over him in one place he said oh I wish
[31:55] I could have that all the time
[32:00] and when he said that I say he had
[32:02] little temporary places where that love
[32:04] come over him in that real overwhelming
[32:06] way and when it come over he said I wish
[32:08] I had that I'll tell you I'm praying
[32:10] that's what my life I I want to come
[32:13] into that I wish I could have that all
[32:15] the time I believe it's the promise of
[32:17] the Bride not just a psychological
[32:19] exercise but it's the promise that
[32:21] because of this decision you've made
[32:24] this will bring their tremendous victory
[32:27] in Divine love
[32:31] that we can live like that all the time
[32:33] it's an atmosphere and it must have been
[32:37] a power
[32:38] That Conquers demons
[32:42] demons and animals or demons and people
[32:44] and the maniac he runs over to Tara's
[32:47] body tear him up and he says his
[32:50] thoughts turn to thinking within himself
[32:53] he said now that man has a family
[32:55] somewhere
[32:56] he's lacking love in his life
[32:59] instead of looking at a man who's demon
[33:01] possessed ready to tear him to pieces he
[33:03] began to love the man's soul and see why
[33:06] he come from that and sympathy for him
[33:10] when that love came in so overwhelmingly
[33:13] it was more powerful than the demons in
[33:15] that man broke him down that man come up
[33:18] got so close to him he hopped up in his
[33:21] throat and spitting brother Bottom's
[33:22] Faith over the pulpit
[33:24] most of you
[33:26] I don't know how you would react with
[33:28] somebody hawked and spit
[33:30] junk in your face
[33:32] but he's saying the only way is
[33:34] something come over him and overwhelmed
[33:36] him and I love the man
[33:38] he said in the name of Jesus
[33:41] he said I'll you'll he said you'll
[33:44] you'll fall to your feet and bow before
[33:45] me today and that man said I'll show you
[33:48] whose feet is going to bow to and he
[33:50] come after him and something broke him
[33:51] and he did fall right at brother
[33:53] bradham's feet
[33:56] and what did he attribute to
[33:59] love
[34:01] love was more powerful
[34:03] in that case he didn't
[34:05] he didn't necessarily have a healing
[34:07] line
[34:09] it was something else working there
[34:11] can I get an amen this morning
[34:15] so now
[34:16] let's start breaking these down here
[34:19] are you still on board this morning
[34:23] that clock in the back says one o'clock
[34:25] but we gain an hour so we're only at
[34:28] noon
[34:31] I love this time of year I love daylight
[34:34] savings time I love it
[34:40] you say brother Paul you're thinking
[34:42] you've got an extra hour preach because
[34:43] of that yes I do I get an extra hour to
[34:45] preach
[34:46] I'm going to break these things down and
[34:48] I've been breaking them down looking at
[34:51] the Greek words for these words looking
[34:54] the Amplified looking through different
[34:56] things
[34:57] researching it and I don't want just
[35:00] man's opinion but I want to know what
[35:02] these words mean when he says love is
[35:06] patient and that's the first one love
[35:09] is patient
[35:11] scripture says now we exhort your
[35:13] brother and warn them that are unruly
[35:14] Comfort the feeble-minded support the
[35:16] weak
[35:17] be patient toward all men
[35:21] and the Amplified we earnestly urge you
[35:22] Believers admonish those who are out of
[35:24] line the undisciplined the unruly the
[35:27] disorderly admonish those ones give them
[35:29] a slight rebuke because they're out of
[35:31] line they're undisciplined they're
[35:32] unruly give them a slight rebuke
[35:35] do that to those who are unruly
[35:37] encourage the timid those who lack
[35:39] spiritual courage courage encourage the
[35:42] timid help the spiritually weak
[35:46] these are things that we want to do as
[35:47] Christians be patient with everyone
[35:52] always controlling your temper
[35:56] so
[35:57] when we look at this word patient
[36:00] it means that It suffers long it never
[36:03] gives up it is slow to lose its patience
[36:06] it does not demonstrate irritations or
[36:11] reflect anger or have a quick temper I'm
[36:13] going to say that again it does not
[36:15] demonstrate irritations or reflect anger
[36:19] or have a quick temper and as I said
[36:22] these things are really tested in the
[36:24] people we live around every day more
[36:26] than anybody else
[36:28] I I'm some of these attributes I'm
[36:31] taking from a couple Christian writers
[36:33] one of them is Stephen Cole he was a
[36:35] pastor and I'm taking some of those
[36:36] things from him and then uh there was
[36:39] Sam Levinson said you know one thing
[36:41] about love at first sight is easy to
[36:43] understand loving somebody at First
[36:45] Sight it's when two people have been
[36:47] looking at each other for years
[36:49] that love becomes a miracle
[36:57] but it's not really a miracle it's the
[37:00] result of yielding to God repeatedly
[37:02] confronting our selfishness and daily
[37:05] practicing biblical love in our homes
[37:10] the Greek word for patient comes from
[37:12] two words meaning long tempered long
[37:15] tempered that's in the Greek if you're
[37:17] patient you're slow to anger you endure
[37:20] personal wrongs without retaliating
[37:23] if you bear with others imperfections
[37:25] false uh differences you bear with other
[37:28] people's imperfections faults and
[37:29] differences you give them time to change
[37:32] room to make mistakes without coming
[37:34] down hard too quickly on them
[37:37] do you do that men with your wife and
[37:40] children and he's asking some questions
[37:41] as a pastor here do you do that with
[37:43] others do you do that with your wife and
[37:45] children at home you you give them time
[37:47] to change room to make mistakes without
[37:49] coming down hard
[37:52] you bear with other imperfections faults
[37:55] and reminding you of the scripture he
[37:57] said be patient with everyone always
[37:59] always controlling your temper so this
[38:03] patience it goes further just just
[38:05] little human patience it's divine love
[38:08] patience
[38:09] it's his patience expressed and you know
[38:12] the reason you know the best place we
[38:14] can see it God's Divine patience with
[38:17] you
[38:21] all this originates in God can you say
[38:23] Amen how much patience has he had with
[38:26] you how many times should he have lost
[38:28] his temper over you
[38:31] but when this flows from the very throat
[38:33] of God through the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:35] there's a patience that goes beyond just
[38:38] human patience
[38:40] can you say Amen
[38:41] and it goes beyond here's here's an
[38:43] example of it going Beyond in the late
[38:45] 1500s Dr Thomas Cooper edited a
[38:48] dictionary with the addition of 33 000
[38:51] words and many other improvements to the
[38:52] dictionary he had already been
[38:54] collecting materials for eight years
[38:56] eight years he did this when his wife a
[38:59] rather difficult woman went into a study
[39:01] one day while he was gone and burned all
[39:04] of his notes under the pretense of
[39:06] fearing that he would kill himself
[39:08] studying too much
[39:10] she burned everything eight years of
[39:12] work a pile of Ashes Dr Cooper came home
[39:15] saw the destruction asked who had done
[39:18] it his wife told him boldly that she had
[39:20] done it the patient man heaved a deep
[39:22] sigh
[39:26] and said oh Dinah Dinah thou has given a
[39:30] world of trouble
[39:32] thou has given a world of trouble that's
[39:35] the way they said it again back then
[39:36] thou
[39:38] Dinah
[39:40] you have given thou have given a world
[39:42] of trouble
[39:43] that's all he said
[39:45] then he quietly sat down
[39:48] to another eight years
[39:50] of hard labor
[39:52] to replace the notes
[39:54] which she had destroyed
[39:56] that was it
[40:00] next time you think you've arrived at
[40:01] being patient
[40:03] I'll read that story to you again
[40:07] give you something to aim for
[40:15] brother Bram says and we should have
[40:16] patience with one another
[40:19] we get so much impatient with one
[40:21] another like I've tried to get this
[40:22] message over at the Tabernacle his own
[40:24] church I've tried to get the message
[40:26] over the Tabernacle to see that each
[40:28] member of the Tabernacle become this
[40:30] become this what patient with one
[40:33] another
[40:34] are you listening
[40:37] patient with one another I've tried to
[40:39] get the Tabernacle to this to be patient
[40:41] with one another it's hard to do I've
[40:43] tried to have patience this 33 years see
[40:46] have patience women still Bob their hair
[40:49] still just the same but just have
[40:52] patience even one time and that's not
[40:55] the biggest thing you know just the hair
[40:57] in First Corinthians you say where do
[40:58] you get that go to your Bible Paul talks
[41:00] about the difference in a woman's hair
[41:02] in man's hair it's in the Bible it's not
[41:04] anything we teach weird here it's in the
[41:06] bible let me believe that amen so but
[41:09] still still women Bob their hair still
[41:11] just say but just have patience every
[41:13] one time when that Rebellion a bunch of
[41:16] people had such pop
[41:19] impatience they caused Moses to do
[41:22] something was wrong but yet when it come
[41:25] down there was times that Moses lost his
[41:27] patience but then when it come down The
[41:29] Showdown God got sick of their actions
[41:32] the children of Israel he said separate
[41:34] yourself Moses I'll kill the whole bunch
[41:36] of them how many know that Bible says
[41:37] that God says I'll I'll kill the whole
[41:39] bunch of them and start a new start a
[41:41] new group of people
[41:42] Moses throwed himself on the breach and
[41:45] said God don't do it God don't do it
[41:47] what patience with people that was
[41:50] rebelling against him I wonder if we
[41:54] could do that
[41:57] who was it in Moses that stood in
[41:59] between God and the people and said Lord
[42:01] don't destroy him this is your people
[42:04] think of your testimony you raised these
[42:06] people up he's reasoning with God who
[42:09] was it in Moses standing in the gap
[42:11] having patience with God's people's
[42:13] Rebellion
[42:15] Christ
[42:19] was in Moses
[42:22] and when Christ
[42:25] is in US
[42:26] it's christ-like patience can you say
[42:29] Amen
[42:30] and he says church we need to have
[42:33] patience with people
[42:35] they're wearing this they're doing this
[42:37] they're cheating on their taxes they're
[42:40] being sneaky they're gossiping they're
[42:43] oh my and some of it's just they don't
[42:45] know better some of it's just outright
[42:47] Rebellion and he's teaching us
[42:50] there's no other reaction except
[42:53] patience
[42:57] and prayer to say God deal with that
[42:59] Rebellion but as far as me
[43:02] they're only going to get one thing from
[43:04] me the patience of God
[43:07] we're going to keep loving you
[43:09] we're going to keep preaching to you
[43:11] we're going to keep wooing you on to
[43:13] more of Christ
[43:15] I'm not going to look at the outside
[43:17] I'm going to look at what God's doing on
[43:19] the inside
[43:20] how many want the patience of divine
[43:22] Divine love the patience part of it
[43:26] about 10 of us all right
[43:29] I think all of us
[43:31] want more of divine love Capstone
[43:33] patients
[43:35] we need it can you say amen he says
[43:37] there's an old Tabernacle people there
[43:39] for years 33 years past and still
[43:41] rebellious still doing their own thing
[43:42] what's your what's our reaction patience
[43:47] patience there is no other correct
[43:50] reaction
[43:51] than patience
[43:54] amen
[43:57] we all praise the Lord
[43:59] the next one is love is kind
[44:03] love is kind
[44:09] be kind one to another tenderhearted
[44:12] forgiving one another even as God for
[44:16] Christ's sake hath forgiven you
[44:19] in the Amplified it says be kind and
[44:21] helpful to one another tenderhearted
[44:24] compassionate understanding forgiving
[44:27] one another readily and freely just as
[44:30] God in Christ also forgave you so the
[44:33] first thing that we see about the
[44:34] kindness of divine love kindness being
[44:37] expressed to one another it is closely
[44:40] related to forgiveness
[44:43] the word forgiveness is mentioned with
[44:46] kindness because really you can't
[44:48] manifest true kindness towards someone
[44:50] unless you're forgiving to someone
[44:54] it's when we're not kind is that when
[44:56] we're not being forgiving we haven't
[44:58] forgiven them for something we're
[45:00] holding a grudge of something they did
[45:01] to US 10 years ago they're never going
[45:04] to be in in my eyes the same they did
[45:06] this that's it that's an unforgiving
[45:08] Spirit that'll bind you did you realize
[45:10] it's not binding them it's binding you
[45:13] can I say it can I say it
[45:16] forgiveness is not releasing them as
[45:19] much as it is releasing you
[45:21] but they need to come and apologize they
[45:24] need to give me a full explanation of
[45:25] what they did wrong they need to come
[45:28] and give me the all the points and they
[45:30] need to list all the things that they've
[45:32] hurt me by I'm not finding that in the
[45:35] Bible
[45:36] I'm not finding it with the kindness of
[45:39] God
[45:41] their repentance and I believe fruits to
[45:43] repentance I believe that but the
[45:45] repentance of God is Not to Come for
[45:48] countless hours and for you to write
[45:50] down and make a whole list and you know
[45:53] what we did to our kids is that you did
[45:55] that bad so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[45:57] do this you had to write it 50 times I'm
[46:00] not doing it I'm not going to do this
[46:01] I'm not going to say that bad word I'm
[46:03] not going to say that bad I'm not going
[46:04] to say that bad word
[46:06] we do these things with our kids you
[46:07] know but but God doesn't do that
[46:10] all right you did you had a bad thought
[46:13] the other day you need to write it God
[46:16] says write it a million times
[46:18] and when you're done then I'll forgive
[46:19] you can't find it
[46:23] and it's not us I'm going to lose some
[46:26] of you but that's okay it's not us who
[46:29] determine
[46:31] the change of a heart
[46:34] it's not us who gives the rules of how
[46:36] much they have to do
[46:39] before I forgive them
[46:46] I'm not talking about just human
[46:48] kindness here I'm talking about Capstone
[46:50] love the more excellent way
[46:53] and all you need to do to find out what
[46:55] it's like is compare it to God's love to
[46:57] you
[46:58] amen God does not manifest the
[47:00] forgiveness and a kindness to you that
[47:03] is determined on so many things he
[47:06] requires true repentance he wants true
[47:08] repentance but it's by the heart and
[47:10] guess what someone at a moment's time at
[47:14] their heart can be changed in one second
[47:19] and God knows it and when they're
[47:21] sincere as brother Josiah read the
[47:23] scripture Sunday I love that the promise
[47:26] we we come into relationship because of
[47:29] a promise not because we deserve it
[47:31] we're promised to come into relationship
[47:33] wasn't that good
[47:35] but not one time does God make that a
[47:37] requirement all these requirements is at
[47:39] one moment someone's heart can change
[47:41] and God knows that more than anybody and
[47:43] it's changed the heart's changed is it
[47:46] that person may need he needs to go make
[47:48] things right he needs to go apologize he
[47:50] means to do it but in God's eyes he's
[47:52] already forgiven because God's seen the
[47:54] sincerity he really means it when it's
[47:55] hard his heart's been changed
[48:01] praise the Lord the kindness the
[48:03] kindness of God be kind and helpful to
[48:06] one another
[48:07] tenderhearted not hard-hearted
[48:10] tenderness tenderhearted may the Lord
[48:13] Jesus I pray this morning take the
[48:16] harshness out of my heart towards people
[48:19] take the hard bitter years of things and
[48:23] then when somebody does a similar thing
[48:25] to me my heart becomes hard again oh God
[48:27] deliver me from that give me a tender
[48:30] heart towards everybody no matter what
[48:32] they've done past present or future the
[48:36] only thing that's going to come out of
[48:38] this vessel is kindness towards that
[48:40] person
[48:41] God give it to me if nobody in this
[48:44] congregation gets a hold of this I want
[48:46] to get a hold of this excellent way it's
[48:49] my promise can you say Amen brother
[48:51] Josiah this is my promise this glorious
[48:55] victory in Divine love is the bride's
[48:57] promise for this hour and because it is
[49:00] a promise I have inherited all the
[49:02] promises of God
[49:05] be kind to one another
[49:08] tenderhearted to one another
[49:10] compassionate understanding forgiving to
[49:13] one another and it doesn't give a list
[49:15] of certain ones
[49:18] you have a list of certain ones that
[49:20] they get that and the other ones don't
[49:22] get it
[49:24] but he doesn't say but there's other
[49:28] ones you know
[49:30] it's just no way
[49:34] no way Tammy Faye no way
[49:42] it's the kindness tender heart and
[49:44] gentle has ability
[49:45] to soothe hurt feelings
[49:48] to calm and upset person to help quietly
[49:51] in practical ways and the reason to say
[49:53] this is the Greek word comes from a word
[49:55] meaning useful this is the kindness in
[49:58] the Greek word is useful
[50:00] a kind person is disposed to be helpful
[50:04] instead instead of being not helpful if
[50:07] you've got a bad attitude towards them
[50:09] that's not helping the matter
[50:12] if you're gossiping about them it's not
[50:13] helping people
[50:15] but kindness becomes useful how can I
[50:17] become useful to see a result to this
[50:20] a kind person is disposed to be helpful
[50:23] he seeks out needs and looks for
[50:25] opportunities to meet those needs
[50:27] without repayment he is tender and
[50:31] forgiving when he or she is wronged he
[50:35] expresses kindness this kindness
[50:38] responds with kindness to people that
[50:41] are being harsh towards you
[50:43] the Bible says in the Old Testament a
[50:45] soft answer turns away Wrath
[50:50] a soft kind answer turns away Wrath
[50:55] and so be kind to one another tender
[50:57] heart and forgive you it's tied to
[50:59] forgiveness in fact forgiveness is the
[51:01] spirit that would actually make a person
[51:03] be more kind forgiveness there needs to
[51:06] be more talk about forgiveness God's
[51:08] forgiveness God's love of forgiveness
[51:10] it's hard to forgive others when we
[51:13] haven't really realized the complete
[51:14] forgiveness God has given us
[51:17] it starts with us before we can give it
[51:20] out you have to examine yourself
[51:24] how much has God forgiven you
[51:26] and if some of you think well he hasn't
[51:30] had to forgive me for a lot because I
[51:32] haven't really done a lot bad
[51:39] so you're looking at the other person
[51:41] and they're bad that's really bad but
[51:45] your bad isn't that bad
[51:49] because you've been in church and you
[51:50] wore the right dresses and you did the
[51:51] right things and and you know the
[51:53] preachers and my I have some bad but
[51:55] it's not as bad as this who who died and
[51:59] made you boss of bad
[52:05] who put you in charge of terming
[52:08] determining what was bad
[52:09] my Bible says he that's guilty of the
[52:12] lease is guilty of the whole
[52:14] we got levels smoking and drugs and
[52:17] drinking and all this and we got bad
[52:18] that's really bad that's bad but in
[52:20] God's books I can go back there to
[52:21] Psalms or Proverbs somewhere it is he
[52:23] says the seven things that God hates and
[52:25] there wasn't any smoking and drinking in
[52:27] there it was one who sows Discord among
[52:30] the Brethren it was one who has hatred
[52:32] in their heart
[52:34] that's the things God hates
[52:37] so who determines what's bad
[52:40] and if you're saying my bad is not as
[52:43] bad as bad this guy's bad bad's bad's
[52:46] bad
[52:48] you already have something bad you have
[52:50] pride you have a religious spirit
[52:53] you think you're better than everybody
[52:55] you never find the Forgiveness that you
[52:58] need to forgive somebody else unless you
[53:00] look at yourself first
[53:04] because whatever they did
[53:06] you without God are capable of doing the
[53:10] very same thing
[53:12] I didn't expect to say this this morning
[53:14] but I'm saying it you without any of God
[53:16] in your life are capable of doing
[53:18] everything that person that's so bad
[53:20] that you think and you can't forgive
[53:21] you're capable of it
[53:23] you would do it without any restraints
[53:25] you would have done the same thing you
[53:27] would have looked at the same thing you
[53:29] would have committed adultery the same
[53:31] way
[53:34] now we start to come into feeling
[53:36] unworthy before God and then grateful to
[53:40] God that the only way that I'm worthy is
[53:43] because of Calvary because
[53:46] before that person stuck a needle in his
[53:49] arm before that person got addicted to
[53:51] pornography before that person become an
[53:53] alcoholic
[53:54] before they did any of that they were
[53:57] already a sinner
[53:59] unacceptable to God
[54:04] so don't give me these levels of
[54:05] different things
[54:08] that say Lord
[54:10] I realize you've really forgiven me of a
[54:14] lot
[54:19] forgiveness is tied to kindness if you
[54:21] have something in your heart to forgive
[54:23] you're going to be more kind to people
[54:27] Lord I need this
[54:31] I don't know about you this morning but
[54:32] I need this I do not want this to be
[54:34] just a sermon
[54:36] May I'm not putting on a show but I mean
[54:38] this if you weren't in the room any of
[54:40] you today are listening online I could
[54:42] look over these things and come before
[54:43] my God and say God I need this
[54:46] I need this
[54:48] more excellent way
[54:56] brother Bram says about kindness
[54:59] be kind one to another be kind to your
[55:01] enemies love everybody
[55:03] no matter what they done love them
[55:06] anyhow
[55:08] and if you can't do that brother sister
[55:09] if there was a time you need a
[55:12] at the altar it's thin so if you can't
[55:14] do it you need an altar
[55:17] you need an altar of repentance
[55:21] that's the answer it's not saying Lord
[55:23] help me be brother and get in your car
[55:24] and go home it's you need an altar in
[55:27] your heart and an altar here you need an
[55:29] altar
[55:32] if you can't do it brother sister if
[55:33] there was a time you need you need an
[55:35] altar when you come back create when you
[55:38] come back create and I recognize the
[55:40] other day a selfish Spirit coming up in
[55:42] me of saying this man is wrong
[55:45] and I ought to tell him about it that's
[55:47] wrong
[55:48] remember I'm saying that man's wrong and
[55:51] God's saying you're wrong
[55:54] you're wrong in your attitude
[55:57] he's wrong and I'm gonna go say
[55:59] something about it
[56:00] and the whole attitude God says you're
[56:02] wrong God is the one to tell him about
[56:04] it that's not it's none of my business
[56:10] but my business is to preach the gospel
[56:12] and to love everybody
[56:13] and move on and love my enemies
[56:17] as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his
[56:19] enemy
[56:21] you're all enemies of God
[56:24] you're maybe not this morning but before
[56:25] you come to the Lord You're an enemy of
[56:27] God
[56:28] you're one of his enemies oh no I was a
[56:31] good person you were an enemy of God
[56:33] and he loved his enemies
[56:35] he showed kindness to his enemies
[56:38] he loved me that's right when I was
[56:40] unlovely
[56:42] Jesus Christ loved me when I was in his
[56:44] enemy that's right when I was unlovely
[56:46] he loved me to his bosom and anybody
[56:48] that's unlovely let me love them the
[56:51] same let the spirit that was in Christ
[56:54] be in US amen I love him I love him oh
[56:59] my
[57:01] reverence we ought to honor one another
[57:03] respect one another as brother and
[57:05] sister and love one another with undying
[57:07] love you say well I just can't I just
[57:09] can't
[57:11] well just stay here a little longer and
[57:14] then you will like people too
[57:18] you'll love those who doesn't love you
[57:20] that's really a good sign of
[57:22] Christianity when you can from your
[57:24] heart love those who don't love you love
[57:28] the unovable Jesus said if you just do
[57:30] favors for those that do favors you well
[57:33] the publicans do the same that's why I'm
[57:34] saying this love is not something the
[57:36] world could produce
[57:38] if you're only nice to the people and
[57:40] have have so and so over because she's
[57:42] your friend you have them over for steak
[57:44] and then you have somebody else over for
[57:46] hot dogs
[57:50] thank you
[57:52] or you don't even have them over
[57:56] something's wrong you're a little bit
[57:57] you're playing favorites they're
[57:59] respecter of persons
[58:00] and I I was setting myself up there for
[58:03] a invite to a steak dinner right there
[58:09] if you do favors for those who do favors
[58:11] for you well the publicans do the same
[58:12] but you see you must be kind to those
[58:15] who are unkind to you see kindness
[58:18] do good for those who would do even do
[58:20] you always remember keep that before you
[58:22] that God is watching you love divine
[58:26] love is patient love is kind how many
[58:31] understand just a little bit more of
[58:33] what kindness is
[58:37] can we do one more today
[58:40] love
[58:41] is not jealous
[58:44] love is not jealous
[58:46] so before I read the scriptures it says
[58:49] here
[58:50] about jealousy now
[58:53] the word means
[58:55] it leans in the Greek to an eagerly
[58:58] desire it is used both positively and
[59:00] negatively in the Bible jealousy in the
[59:03] negative sense is related to Greed and
[59:04] selfishness the jealous person wants
[59:07] what others have he wants things for
[59:09] himself he is too selfish to applaud
[59:11] others success
[59:13] he has to have all the attention
[59:17] in the family a jealous husband refuses
[59:19] to trust his wife he doesn't want to
[59:22] recognize her abilities and
[59:24] contributions he is jealous of the time
[59:26] she spends sometimes even with the
[59:27] children and with her friends he wants
[59:29] it all for himself
[59:31] whoo wow
[59:34] he's jealous of everyone else even
[59:37] closeness in his life because he wants
[59:38] all that attention to himself
[59:41] jealous of the time she spends with the
[59:43] children or family and friends he wants
[59:45] it all for himself I'm not saying this
[59:46] this Christian writer's saying it just
[59:48] so you don't throw the tomatoes in me
[59:51] James says now we're in the Book of
[59:53] James jealousy is often the source of
[59:56] quarrels and conflicts
[59:58] throw
[1:00:00] s Bob James 4 2 from Once come Wars and
[1:00:02] fightings among you come they not of
[1:00:04] your own lust
[1:00:05] so so
[1:00:07] um jealousy
[1:00:09] most the time is the source of arguments
[1:00:13] and quarrels and fussing
[1:00:19] it's what Satan's beginning to use
[1:00:21] jealousy to cause tensions and fights
[1:00:25] ye lust and have not ye kill and desire
[1:00:28] to have him cannot obtain yet fight you
[1:00:30] fight in war yet you have not because
[1:00:32] you ask not and that's in the Book of
[1:00:33] James so the prophet he said you know
[1:00:36] the prophet said the start of all the
[1:00:38] children Israel going into bondage
[1:00:40] how did they get there was the jealousy
[1:00:42] of his Joseph's brothers
[1:00:45] your brother Brian said the start of the
[1:00:47] murder
[1:00:48] of king of Kane Cain murdering Abel was
[1:00:52] jealousy
[1:00:55] he murdered he murdered him but it was
[1:00:57] the start was a jealousy because Abel
[1:00:59] brought a sacrifice God was pleased with
[1:01:01] it and instead of and this is the way he
[1:01:03] said instead of
[1:01:05] Cain saying Abel my brother praise the
[1:01:09] Lord
[1:01:10] God's endorsed your sacrifice you got a
[1:01:14] real Revelation there brother and I'm
[1:01:16] going to come alongside you I'm going to
[1:01:17] help you with this get this animal up on
[1:01:19] here and I'm going to join with you and
[1:01:22] I'm going to ask God to forgive me and
[1:01:24] ask God to give me the same revelation
[1:01:26] of what sacrifice I can bring that's
[1:01:28] acceptable that's what Cain should have
[1:01:30] said
[1:01:31] and guess what if he would have come the
[1:01:35] Bible says God said I would have
[1:01:37] accepted even Cain
[1:01:40] who was serpent seed
[1:01:44] that's how God's grace can come
[1:01:46] can't limit God's grace if he had come
[1:01:49] and done the same sacrifice God would
[1:01:51] have had to accept that sacrifice
[1:01:55] but he should have said Abel my brother
[1:01:57] I haven't grown as much as you but you
[1:01:59] have excelled you've got signs fall in
[1:02:01] your life you've got things going on
[1:02:03] you've excelled in the excellent love I
[1:02:05] see a Divine love but see instead of
[1:02:08] rejoicing in someone else growing
[1:02:10] further than us and saying praise the
[1:02:12] Lord somebody is get into rapturing
[1:02:15] Faith here
[1:02:17] I wouldn't criticize somebody brother
[1:02:18] Brown says I come into the faith of
[1:02:20] Enoch to be raptured I wouldn't
[1:02:22] criticize that I want to come on to the
[1:02:23] same Faith but instead in our humanness
[1:02:26] instead of looking and said I praise God
[1:02:29] they've been blessed and they've been
[1:02:30] accepted by God you can see Prosperity
[1:02:32] over their whole life
[1:02:34] I want to do what they do I want to find
[1:02:36] what I want to learn from them instead
[1:02:37] it's jealousy
[1:02:41] and jealousy
[1:02:43] brings fusses and stews and
[1:02:46] murder murder can you imagine
[1:02:50] so angry at that person I wanna
[1:02:53] I wouldn't kill him but I'd do something
[1:02:56] real close
[1:03:01] jealousy
[1:03:05] it's the opposite of selfless love it's
[1:03:08] selfish love
[1:03:10] it's got to all be directed back
[1:03:15] to just three people
[1:03:18] Me Myself and I
[1:03:22] it's all they care about just three
[1:03:24] people me myself and I
[1:03:26] jealousy will do this
[1:03:28] the Greed for what others have
[1:03:31] I never had it like them we're not to
[1:03:33] compare ourselves with one another
[1:03:35] so I'm going to start ending now on this
[1:03:36] quote and yeah I'm gonna end on this one
[1:03:38] because we can't go further we got
[1:03:40] several other attributes to go so we'll
[1:03:42] continue on another time
[1:03:45] Third Exodus he says God give us a
[1:03:48] Pentecost he gave us a Pentecost he gave
[1:03:51] us the book of Acts he gave us the Holy
[1:03:53] Spirit to lead us and guide us he gave
[1:03:55] us a land and why are we out of it why
[1:03:58] is the church out of it 1963 why is the
[1:04:01] church Ottawa why isn't the great
[1:04:03] Christian church today living again like
[1:04:06] the book of Acts bringing forth the same
[1:04:09] thing
[1:04:10] it's a good question
[1:04:12] why isn't the book of Acts bringing for
[1:04:14] the same there's some reason for it now
[1:04:16] we all know that we're broke up and
[1:04:19] we're in a terrible condition and the
[1:04:21] most terrible condition that
[1:04:22] Christianity has ever lived in is today
[1:04:24] broke up in different denominations
[1:04:26] Christianity is a mass 33 000 different
[1:04:28] denominations within Christianity all
[1:04:31] these other split UPS all this divide
[1:04:33] it's not the token that's not the Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost that's not what God intended and
[1:04:37] right here in the brim of the brick of
[1:04:38] the great tariff Terrible Terror
[1:04:40] terrific judgment laying for the church
[1:04:41] and before this judgment can happen God
[1:04:44] is calling it Exodus just like he did
[1:04:46] then the Amorite sin was heaped up so
[1:04:48] he's calling a spiritual Exodus they
[1:04:51] went down in Egypt now this is I skipped
[1:04:54] along in the quote and I'm unveiling the
[1:04:57] reason why that that they got out of
[1:04:59] their promise they got out of their land
[1:05:02] how many has ever been in the flow of
[1:05:05] being filled with the spirit and living
[1:05:07] that during the day and you just felt
[1:05:09] God leading you and you felt filled with
[1:05:11] the spirit how many Believers have felt
[1:05:13] that before
[1:05:14] that is your land signs following them
[1:05:17] that believe the Book of Acts Church
[1:05:18] repeated again that's a typical day in
[1:05:21] the life of a son and daughter of God
[1:05:24] should be a typical day
[1:05:26] but how he's ever felt that and then all
[1:05:27] of a sudden something happened
[1:05:29] you don't feel that again
[1:05:33] there's a lot of reasons but sometimes
[1:05:35] it's you got out of your land and when
[1:05:36] you get out of your land
[1:05:38] well here's what I'm getting how do you
[1:05:40] get out of your land here's one of the
[1:05:41] reasons again that's the reason Israel
[1:05:44] was in Egypt at that time out of the
[1:05:47] land remember God's promises was only as
[1:05:51] long as they stayed in the land they
[1:05:54] went down into Egypt
[1:05:56] a couple lines up I missed it all
[1:05:59] because of the jealousy of a brother
[1:06:06] laughs
[1:06:08] God's people
[1:06:10] went into 400 years of bondage
[1:06:14] away from God
[1:06:18] away from their land
[1:06:20] because of one thing
[1:06:23] it started with jealousy
[1:06:27] of a brother
[1:06:29] not a heathen
[1:06:30] their own brother
[1:06:33] now something if jealousy green jealousy
[1:06:37] Wicked jealousy
[1:06:39] one time the prophet said pure jealousy
[1:06:41] and then he corrected himself no no
[1:06:43] there can't be anything like pure
[1:06:44] jealousy
[1:06:46] but if jealousy can be so bad that it
[1:06:50] actually brought a people of God in
[1:06:52] bondage for 400 years
[1:06:57] then I'd say it's something we better
[1:06:58] bring before the Lord
[1:07:01] because it can cause a lot of division
[1:07:04] in the church
[1:07:07] in your marriage
[1:07:09] in your relationships
[1:07:12] with your children
[1:07:15] it can bring
[1:07:17] a lot of things jealousy can bring a lot
[1:07:19] of things as I said quarrels
[1:07:23] arguments
[1:07:24] irritations
[1:07:27] fussing
[1:07:29] how many loves to argue
[1:07:32] only me
[1:07:36] nobody's going to raise their hand
[1:07:39] but nobody answered it
[1:07:41] nobody loves
[1:07:43] because most of the time it doesn't and
[1:07:45] we argue to win we're going to win you
[1:07:47] know
[1:07:48] you argue with a four-year-old and it's
[1:07:51] a battle who's going to win
[1:07:52] and you parents have to win
[1:07:55] but but like when you get in with adults
[1:07:58] and relationships and marriages and
[1:08:00] stuff it's and if it's all about winning
[1:08:01] I'm going to win this that's not the
[1:08:04] approach
[1:08:06] so we argue because we're out to win
[1:08:10] Dwight Moody said I'd rather win souls
[1:08:12] than win arguments
[1:08:17] I'd rather win souls and spend my time
[1:08:19] winning Souls than winning arguments
[1:08:22] it's a good feeling to win an argument
[1:08:24] to argue to get okay and you won at the
[1:08:27] end that's why we do it there's a
[1:08:29] jealousy to to want to win I'm going to
[1:08:31] win I'm going to win what if we were
[1:08:33] just to let that go and release and
[1:08:35] release that jealousy and release all
[1:08:36] that back and there'd be less arguments
[1:08:38] there will be less fusses less fightings
[1:08:41] less Wars
[1:08:44] say Lord kill all the jealousy in me I
[1:08:47] don't want to have any jealousy and if
[1:08:49] we kill the jealousy we kill the
[1:08:51] arguments we kill more of the tension
[1:08:53] what kind of homes would we have if we
[1:08:56] say Lord take the jealousy in my heart
[1:08:59] and Lord Purge it by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:04] what kind of more kind homes patient
[1:09:07] homes loving homes would we have what
[1:09:10] kind of marriages would we have
[1:09:12] if jealousy would not come in
[1:09:15] the picture
[1:09:17] I'm here to end this today to say
[1:09:20] they got out of their land
[1:09:22] starting with jealousy and I'm gonna
[1:09:24] venture to say that a lot of times when
[1:09:27] we step out of our promise and out of
[1:09:29] our land of the Holy Ghost and out of
[1:09:31] our walking in Divine love every day
[1:09:33] it's some type of jealousy that's popped
[1:09:36] up
[1:09:38] and if we can recognize and expose the
[1:09:40] enemies they I know what you're doing I
[1:09:42] know where this is going I know what
[1:09:45] you're trying to do here I know you're
[1:09:46] trying to be all right if we could catch
[1:09:47] it before I say I'm not I don't want to
[1:09:49] go there I don't want to go to that
[1:09:51] argument it's gonna we're gonna say
[1:09:53] things we don't mean we're gonna we're
[1:09:55] we're not gonna speak to one another for
[1:09:56] two days I don't want to I've learned I
[1:09:58] don't want to go there I want to go a
[1:10:00] different way
[1:10:01] so Lord take the jealousy out of my
[1:10:04] heart I don't trying to be someone else
[1:10:06] I'm not trying to be jealous of that
[1:10:08] person I have the blessings you've given
[1:10:10] me bless them Lord and may I respect and
[1:10:13] honor them and not be jealous of their
[1:10:16] gifts and what God's blessed them to do
[1:10:18] and who they are as a person see in a
[1:10:20] marriage you have to respect who they
[1:10:21] are as a person
[1:10:25] you have to respect who they are as a
[1:10:27] person people come along and say Hey you
[1:10:29] know uh the one guy there years ago
[1:10:32] years ago not now so you don't think I'm
[1:10:34] talking about you
[1:10:37] if my wife would just clean her house
[1:10:40] like sister so and so we had a sister
[1:10:42] she kept her house immaculate it was so
[1:10:45] clean
[1:10:46] and it was it was amazing I have to say
[1:10:48] and it was just beautiful
[1:10:51] but he's sitting in the if she if she
[1:10:53] would do this and do this and do this
[1:10:56] and serve do this that then we wouldn't
[1:10:59] have any marriage problems if she would
[1:11:01] just keep the house clean we wouldn't
[1:11:02] have any marriage problems
[1:11:05] boy
[1:11:06] you need to go back to your mama
[1:11:11] tell us you married a four-year-old here
[1:11:15] and a lot of girls do they marry a they
[1:11:17] may report your older 16 year old hasn't
[1:11:19] really left mama
[1:11:21] it's all about himself or she does the
[1:11:23] thing and she's all about herself she's
[1:11:25] coming into marriage it's all about her
[1:11:27] and she moved it no no that's that's not
[1:11:29] love that's not agape love
[1:11:30] it's not about Mom and Dad anymore it's
[1:11:32] about you two growing in Grace and
[1:11:34] knowledge Jesus Christ and respecting
[1:11:35] one another can you say amen and he said
[1:11:38] if she would just keep her house clean
[1:11:39] like sister so and so I won't mention
[1:11:40] her name if she would just do that I
[1:11:42] said no no no and comparing his wife and
[1:11:45] not looking at the gifts that she did
[1:11:47] have and the kind of person she was and
[1:11:50] I said I said you didn't marry sister so
[1:11:53] and so you married this person you took
[1:11:56] a vow and when you took a vow you said
[1:12:00] in sickness and in health I'm the
[1:12:03] preacher I made you repeat it
[1:12:07] I know this stuff
[1:12:11] I got the book I read it and young
[1:12:15] people don't value it when you take that
[1:12:17] you take it before God and before
[1:12:19] Witnesses and it should mean what you
[1:12:22] say
[1:12:23] in sickness and health
[1:12:27] for richer for poor
[1:12:30] fat skinny no it doesn't say that
[1:12:37] till death do us part
[1:12:40] it's a vow it's a commitment it's this I
[1:12:43] didn't marry this and you don't try to
[1:12:45] take somebody help me this morning you
[1:12:48] do not try to take the image of the
[1:12:50] perfect one you think that's a perfect
[1:12:52] this and perfect God and try to fit that
[1:12:55] image into this guy or this girl you're
[1:12:57] marrying that is wrong brother sister
[1:12:59] you took a vow and embraced all of them
[1:13:01] who they are weaknesses everything
[1:13:07] that's what love does
[1:13:09] you know seriously I wish I would have
[1:13:10] that I wish I had this a little bit of
[1:13:12] that and some do it I'm gonna go get a
[1:13:15] new model
[1:13:16] or a model
[1:13:20] this is who God has given you and I'm
[1:13:23] not you know there's I'm not belittling
[1:13:25] anybody here that has a different
[1:13:28] marriage God knows your life and God has
[1:13:30] blessed you that's that's fine but you
[1:13:32] see now when you marry you know now some
[1:13:35] of you that have been divorced and
[1:13:36] remarried you're not you now you know
[1:13:38] some of this
[1:13:39] and you don't compare with other ones I
[1:13:43] embrace and love every part of this
[1:13:45] person
[1:13:47] good or bad
[1:13:51] and we grow together
[1:13:56] I didn't expect to say any of this this
[1:13:58] morning seriously I didn't sit last
[1:14:00] night
[1:14:01] and write this all down specific
[1:14:03] this this part's all free
[1:14:08] you don't
[1:14:10] put that person and you don't put people
[1:14:13] in the church that way you don't say I
[1:14:15] want everybody to act this way and act
[1:14:17] this way towards me it's not going to
[1:14:18] happen
[1:14:19] but I love them for who they are good
[1:14:23] bad ugly whatever it is because I know
[1:14:26] that's the only way to draw them out of
[1:14:29] themselves
[1:14:31] to become not the other guy or Christian
[1:14:34] you're looking at or not to become
[1:14:36] brother Paul and oh don't do that that
[1:14:38] they become the image of Christ because
[1:14:40] that's what you're doing sister or
[1:14:42] brother that's what you're doing is that
[1:14:43] you're saying Lord take my Falls take my
[1:14:46] weaknesses take my mistakes I don't know
[1:14:48] why this happened I don't know why I did
[1:14:49] that but Lord I bring it under your
[1:14:50] blood and God I'm saying now help me not
[1:14:52] to ever do that again and Lord why did I
[1:14:54] do it and they're exploring they're
[1:14:55] going to the heart journey the Heart
[1:14:57] Journey why you do things the inbred
[1:14:59] things in you the heart journey is the
[1:15:01] most dangerous Journey you ever take and
[1:15:02] most people don't take it because it's
[1:15:04] too scary
[1:15:06] but you go the hard journey and say why
[1:15:07] am I this way the devil's got this he's
[1:15:09] attached to himself this God I've come
[1:15:11] to Christ I've come to you to all this
[1:15:14] stuff that I can overcome these things
[1:15:16] that are by past history and I can
[1:15:19] become into the image of Jesus Christ
[1:15:20] but when you come to image of Jesus
[1:15:23] Christ he doesn't get rid of your
[1:15:24] personality
[1:15:27] I want my husband to be a I just don't
[1:15:30] like even I don't like even his
[1:15:32] personality I wish he would be more like
[1:15:35] somebody different than him
[1:15:40] when God changed you he didn't change
[1:15:42] your personality
[1:15:44] he didn't change your gifts
[1:15:46] he made all that that's Gibson callings
[1:15:49] are without repentance he gave you all
[1:15:51] that inbred in you born in you that's
[1:15:53] who I am
[1:15:54] but brother sister don't ever justify
[1:15:57] and say a temper and belittling your
[1:16:00] kids and belittling your wife and
[1:16:02] cussing at your employees don't you ever
[1:16:05] say that's just me that ain't you that's
[1:16:08] the devil on you
[1:16:10] that's it's destroyed your relationship
[1:16:12] with your children it's destroyed
[1:16:15] can you say Amen don't you ever say
[1:16:17] that's just me and Justified that's not
[1:16:19] you that's the devil on you and that's
[1:16:21] the part you got to overcome
[1:16:23] and become into one image not brother
[1:16:25] Paul not brother Bob not there not
[1:16:28] brother Kenny but the image of Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ
[1:16:31] and you be who you are through Christ
[1:16:35] who strengthens you
[1:16:38] and it's in our weakness that he becomes
[1:16:40] strong to acknowledge our weaknesses he
[1:16:43] becomes strong
[1:16:44] because his strength is perfect
[1:16:48] when our strength is gone
[1:16:52] I'm going to sing that now as the
[1:16:53] missions musicians come but listen to me
[1:16:55] is anybody getting anything out of these
[1:16:59] attributes of the excellent way
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:11] this to me is the Revival of the Bride
[1:17:16] this is the Capstone love she comes into
[1:17:20] the whole culmination of the entire
[1:17:21] message that you believe all culminates
[1:17:23] I believe in this Capstone love and
[1:17:25] living it every day by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:29] to everyone
[1:17:30] I want it I want it so bad
[1:17:34] his strength is perfect
[1:17:38] perfect
[1:17:40] when our strength we're going to stand
[1:17:43] and pray together we're going to pray
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:46] he'll carry us
