========================================

let's get our Bibles tonight and turn to Acts chapter 2 if you would amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to be in Fellowship doesn't matter how many numbers are here can you say Amen we can pull on the word of God and enjoy the word of God and join in together with his spirit and we just love you and appreciate you and brother Ken sister Anita enjoyed the fellowship last night within catching up and also just the good history that we have with them and helping us with the church many years ago and to see God's grace in their life we're still here brother Ken we're still here by the gods of grace and the devil don't like it but we're still here we're not going to go away amen praise the Lord still fighting the battle praise the Lord Acts chapter 2 and I'm just going back into a few things out of the scripture from a couple weeks ago but also just picking it up where we left off and so we'll just remind you of these um references or I called them windows of the relationship I'm going to call this tonight relationships after Redemption part two and talk a little bit about it here Acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it says then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need notice the the Holy Ghost working in the church one of the things that brought out is they became very sensitive and aware of another man's needs in other words the selfishness had gone away and they became become aware of the needs within their own body and other needs and begin to do things to try to help in those needs whatever they could and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house because there was no church buildings at that time for the Believers they broke bread from house to house and did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God having favor with all the people in the Lord added to the church daily such it should be saved sounds all positive to me can you say mom and then Acts chapter 4 I think I was reading as well Acts chapter 4 and verse 32 verses 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake with the word the word of God with boldness and The Malt of the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that all the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all can you say men tonight may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we'll just go on tonight a little bit in a study together and ministering and teaching and preaching and whatever the Lord has for us tonight to encourage you in the faith of God and we certainly heard a good message on Sunday about the altar of offenses and the altar of faith and if I have any altar of the fences in my life I don't I want to destroy those altars and I want to have an altar of faith that I worship at before God I really really enjoyed the word Sunday and just that approach to it never quite heard it that way and so we appreciate brother Timothy and his uh just yielding to the Lord that way it was very helpful to me personally and I know it was many to many others and I just encourage the rest of you maybe that didn't respond too much that it's time to gave up those offenses it's time to take that mountain of fences in your life and and destroy that altar it's time to move on with faith praise the Lord so this as we look at these things in the book of Acts we see the first account of uh relationships not not only with God relationship with God and with others and you know from the series that everything that um that was lost in the Garden of Eden now has been restored and man has been restored back that everything he lost besides his new body he's received everything back again and so now we have this Oneness with God now that they hadn't had for all these thousands of years now they've come back into it by the Holy Spirit coming in them they've become one it wasn't a religion it wasn't rules it wasn't a duty it wasn't some new religion that come along it was completely separate than religion it was an internal work of the Holy Spirit coming in the soul the control tower and he himself came in so that by one Spirit they became one with God again so that's totally different than a mental exercise or deny domination or a Duty or a code of ethics to live by it goes beyond any of that and should never be associated with that it's the power of God coming into the vigil and he at that moment comes in Oneness with God and there's no man can take that away and so I want to emphasize tonight relationship over rules relationship over uh religion of course and so they had come after being redeemed into a real relationship with God here that they hadn't experienced since the Garden of Eden quite this way people have been anointed prophets had come the people had been blessed well there's some healed there's many powerful things that took place but they had never had relationship like this with God for thousands of years until this Upper Room when all of a sudden everything that was lost from Adam and Eve come back again that's a pretty powerful thing so in the book of Acts that we read here this kind of the first window that we have of the book of Acts church and what it looked like and I'm emphasizing the relationship part but there are many things that God did in the book of Acts and all of them none of them are to be cast aside we're we're we should have the word working in our lives and the spirit work in our lives that even personally we should be able to write a book of Acts in our lives it may not be as big as this book maybe yours is but nevertheless there should be acts of God in your life that you can write a story at the end of all this and if there was a future if there was a future generation they could read your story and and have a book of Acts from your life praise the Lord so now the we see this power in a redeemed people back to everything Eden lost except for the new body brother Brown says in purpose in life in spirit and envision everything had been restored back from Eden again except a new body they were in every way purpose Vision life and spirit they were every way restored back to the Garden of Eden again in spirit and so it's the same today and we should know then that it did not take very long uh until the Antichrist Spirit began to come into those days of the book of Acts and that shouldn't surprise us because Satan entered the Oneness with Adam and Eve right away and destroyed their Oneness so now when you have the same Oneness it shouldn't be a surprise that Satan comes in in the early church and begins to bring that Antichrist spirit and begins to do and one way we know it's the Antichrist spirit it's just working against what's happening in the church it's doing something opposite can you say Amen it's presenting a different a different way to God than coming through the Holy Ghost and that's how we know that the Antichrist spirit is working is that when you see this love when you see this Fellowship when you see this coronia when you see this this pureness this this guileless atmosphere going on with this this uh speaking in uh tongues that uh they heard him in their own language when you see the spirit making them like drunk men when you see all of this going on then then Satan is coming on the scene because his agenda is to stop this and present another gospel so we know if you have good things going on in church and the spirit is moving and God's doing things and there's Harmony and Oneness and love get ready for the Antichrist spirit amen you're going to fight it can you say Amen you're going to fight this it's going to be a battle I like what brother landline said is that when they come into the promised land that's when their battles began and people say it's not fair it's not fair that all these things are happening to me and all this battle but you what you should say is if you're having all these trials then you're probably possessing some land you're probably gaining ground because as you gain more ground the battle intensifies from your enemy more trials no more pressures because he can't stand Oneness and here in the early church he starts to turn against it and starts to come in an antichrist Spirit we're not going to talk a lot about that but it is relevant to say this that when you see the good things of God coming like they did at the book of Acts get ready for the Antichrist Spirit to come real close and to work against it even in the message even in the message so when it manifests everything contrary to this new relationship the Antichrist spirit will manifest everything contrary to this new relationship they had this new Oneness with God is what was produced in not only Miracles and signs and wonders but it produced the right relationship with God the right relationship with Believers the right relationship with families the relationship with God is what they had first it was a perfect relation Jack relationship back with him again and I want to just say now this relationship in the book of Acts that had had not been there for thousands of years and now they come out of the upper room with this this this my spirit this connection with God that they never had since the book of Eden when this began this relationship was before they had a church to Worship in can I say it relationship is before attending church because these guys didn't have a church to go to you ought to praise the Lord tonight you have a church to go to you ought to go to it can you say mine but you see now this this relationship didn't require to have a church building this relationship in the book of Acts was before Worship in church it was before church order came Paul brought Church order later so they had relationship before they had Church order oh can I get an amen tonight I'm not dumping out Church order I'm glad for it but I'm telling you the book of Acts had relationship before they had Church order before they handed out the Cod books to everybody there was no Cod books it was about relationship and that's it a simple relationship by spirit and Oneness with God before they had the Cod books before church order was handed out can you say Amen before let's say some other things before modesty was taught before modesty was taught or the woman should have uncut hair and the man should cut his hair before any of that was said before any of it they had a relationship before Paul broke into the mystery of Christ in the book of Ephesians before Paul broke down the Old Testament shadows and explored the Christ revealed in the Old Testament before the riches of the Revelation the theophany bodies when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle be destroyed we have one waiting on the other side before all of those Revelations the thing before those Revelations was relationship with God by the Holy Ghost so I tell you today what's more important what's most important all that's important but relationship is more important didn't Paul say though I understand all Mysteries though I understand how to give my body to be burned and I feed the poor and I give and I do all those things and I understand all the Mysteries and yet I can still be locking the main thing somebody say praise the Lord so now before uh before Paul preached all these things before the riches of the Revelation before all this had to be a relationship first by the Holy Ghost and all of that was important but never to be put before relationship in Simplicity before the book of Acts Church could produce anything that they did they each one had to come into relationship by the Oneness of the spirit as a matter of fact you could never produce the book of Acts church and what they manifested without the relationship first now how does Satan duplicate the signs the Wonders the Miracles which he can can you say amen he can work through their things and and and you see then then to me I've always viewed it this way is Satan is watching what's going on because remember this is the first time for thousands of years he's seen this type of uh spirit in the people like this and he's just an observer he's not a Creator and he always tries to duplicate or or or to mess up what God is doing or to try to give an alternate alternative route than the Holy Ghost so he's watching them come out of the room they're acting like drunk men I mean he remembered David and David got happened he danced and before the ark coming in so he knows some happy people that got happy about the Lord but never was it quite like this and then he watched them hearing the other nations hearing them in their own language as they glorified God so Satan every time he observes things and he was there observing it all every time he's there he's always thinking how can I counterfeit this how can I bring uh something that's similar to it that can distract the people from the real thing and that's why you have so many quotes of brother Branham talking about the Pentecostals able to shout dance speak in tongues because we got Satan that can can uh can duplicate and put that all that stuff on and still that person not have the Holy Ghost didn't brother Brown say it and it's only because Satan the deceiver is trying to counterfeit it by something you do on the outside now catch that now that's denominational because when Satan brings something it's to try to get you to do stuff on the outside without relationship Satan does not want you and Oneness with God he doesn't want to he's jealous of your relationship with God and one thing about it if he watched them come down he tried to duplicate he tried to do all these other things throughout the ages and then Azusa Street comes which is a genuine work of God but then you have people going into emphasizing the gifts more and more instead of The Giver so you had a genuine work of Pentecost to restore the joy to the church the happiness of the church the gifts in the church but you have Satan right away counterfeiting it and now you have people able to speak in tongues and actually give a true prophecy under the anointing and they themselves are not many of them in relationship by the Holy Ghost and the soul they got the Holy Ghost on their Spirit they prophesied correctly but they didn't get it in their soul so they had no Oneness with God now I don't think we should just try to understand that because I don't know how I don't know how Satan can do it but we know after this many years 2000 years he's done it what is it all about keeping men and women from the real thing have them dress up right or have them go to church or have them burn a candle all of religious systems Satan has been behind the systems not the people but behind systems to misdirect the people away from one thing the relationship of the Holy Ghost in the upper room get them away from that and we might as well be honest that even our own ranks the emphasis has come on other things instead of somebody getting a true relationship come on now I should get get bigger amens than that we might as well be honest can you say man it happens sometimes even in our own ranks we don't want to do that to the young people we don't want to present a code we don't want to say if you just do this if you just dress this way if you act this way if you just come to church and be here every service then you're okay we don't want to deceive people like that we want the Holy Spirit to come down and he makes a personal connection with them and they turn their lives over and there's a relationship when they walk out the door they may not be dressing all right yet they may understand everything brother Paul preached but they've come into a relationship with God he can talk to them he can they can talk back to him there's a relationship started and that's what we want not just some phony something but a real they've entered into I'm not just talking to God through my parents now or saying prayers when I talk to them I know that I'm in relationship with him by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord that's what we need and and so now this all come by the Holy Ghost and all of that was important but never all those other things are important the church order but never to be put before relationship never to be put before relationship in Simplicity before the book of Acts Church could produce anything that each one had to come into relationship first all other things came out of that all other things in the book of Acts including the Miracles and signs of Wonders should come out of the relationship first a redeemed son and daughter of God amen wake up wake up Girl Say Amen praise the Lord I'm tired too but you know I override it and I'm asking you to do that some of these guys doing exams these kids and young people Solomon has had an exam tonight and just so many things I always feel for him you know they're trying to do this but they're here tonight they're listening online putting God first you know what God bless you God bless you uh you're you're allowed to be a little tired amen but you're here and uh wouldn't mind some louder amens though come on brother can't help me out you're not tired are you so it should be said here now that whenever someone leads somebody to jump past to the other stuff first before relationship and skip the true connection directly with God they mislead that person you know we just had a minister here Sunday who was willing to admit and be honest enough before this congregation and whoever else was listening that he grew up in this message and he grew up in all this and even preached and he said but but I did not have the relationship with Christ that he needed even though he grew up in the message takes a lot for a minister to say that and you know a lot of our message ministers aren't honest enough to say things like that but but Wesley was Wesley said that he preached for I think for quite a few years and knew he didn't have what he needed so he just said I'm going to keep preaching it until I get it that's John Wesley he knew there was a greater work than justification and God led him into sanctification he started to see it in the word but he knew he didn't have that deeper work of the Holy Ghost so he said I kept preaching it and I think he came to the United States he was preaching it over here he was preaching it and something happened he had an experience with God for himself and he was never the same again we had a minister do that this Sunday I praise him for that I think it's a wonderful thing I just heard a another Minister this afternoon uh apologize and recant some of the things he said a couple years ago and he did it publicly and I'll say you know we're getting somewhere when we have that kind of humility in Ministry can you say man we're getting somewhere that's the adoption I'm looking for that's the humility I'm looking for is that we're not perfect in our flesh can you say Amen none of us have a perfect dissecting this word but we're all working together as a body under the Holy Ghost and he's going to bring us to everything that he promised through brother Bradham and through the prophets can you say Amen he's going to bring it to us but let's not get arrogant that we think we know everything let's be willing to make make mistakes and willing to uh to apologize for mistakes now when that happens I know then we're getting somewhere where the spirit of God can really move a genuine move of God I appreciate him doing it so now uh we if we skip over the relationship part looking at the relationship of a simple redeemed people in the book of Acts as I said before church order before all these things and but then we see Paul says later in second Corinthians 11 verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his septility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so now the early church comes out of the upper room we go through the book of Acts and it's early now in the second book of Corinthians that we see Paul sharing his fear and his burden as the Antichrist comes in what would be his work to complicate things to grab a hold of the do's and don'ts and for people to skip the relationship and grab a hold of the do's and don'ts and complicate salvation and complicate the Simplicity of relationship and companies and he said who's who will be doing it the same serpent that talked to Eve would complicate and take them from the Simplicity of this Oneness and this relationship with God men preachers would be used of Satan to complicate the Simplicity in Jesus Christ and did Satan do it yes he did yes he did messing with the people's minds and to me we're we're reading the Simplicity of a relationship with Jesus Christ in the early church it's God in Simplicity it's the Simplicity of Christ and that spoils down to a true Holy Ghost Oneness relationship with God yourself I fear less by any means some some Force begins to take you away from that Simplicity because it all starts with a relationship and it should end with relationship and now we have I heard a wonderful testimony last night we have people that start off maybe some of them don't start in a good way they start off maybe in a good way and then they're distracted by the movement and by things that happen and they get bitter and they can go sometimes 20 30 40 years and they go run away from it all I never want to darken another church door I never want to come around this and then you watch the grace of God just reach out and go get them he's a wonderful testimony I would not certainly wouldn't mention the name but it's it's uh it's someone we knew many years ago and all of a sudden running away from God and away from because what she was run away from was not the God of this message not who brother Branham was as a man as a Christian that's all to me pure but it was all the stuff that was the confusion that went around all the movement of it she ran from that but you can't run from God so some people go through a journey of sometimes even starting in a simple relationship and that's what above we should keep that now let me qualify in case some preachers criticize me on this maybe is that Simplicity in Christ is not dumping out revelation and further Revelation Simplicity of Christ is not stopping to grow to full knowledge of the word of God can you say Amen but it's knowing the one in me and in you that can never change whether I can understand it all or not when I'm into relationship with God and I know that I know that I know that I have it and God doesn't say you're going to lose it if you don't understand everything by next week I'm going to give you a year and if you don't catch all of these Seven Seals you're done in my relationship that's not God at all if you have a Oneness Holy Ghost relationship listen you the devil cannot take that away from you nothing can take that away from you you may sit in services and say I I don't have a clue what that guy is saying and then everyone say you catch that Revelation then it grows then it grows and it is and that's all fine but newer converts sometimes they may not have a clue but there's something deeper working in them and they say I don't know a lot but I know I come into relationship with God I know I got the Holy Spirit I know I got the amenor down the inside and the mind is saying I don't mind this thing I don't understand but the soul is saying Amen to the word of God because you can't be saying amen from the soul unless you got the amenor down there oh isn't it wonderful but God doesn't have all this you know and so but you say now he a Christian with relationship with the true Holy Spirit he he knows that the one living in him said the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth so they're not nervous about how much they know because they know I got the one that knows it all and he's leading me and I'm not going to be missing out on anything I'm going to get everything that I need and that preacher that seems so Way Beyond me or that other brother in the church there Way Beyond me you're not intimidated by it because I've got the same author of what God showed them I've got him living in me and everything I need to know God is not an Indian giver first of all and then God is not specific at who he gives something else and gives another greater Revelation to somebody else he doesn't do that every son and daughter of God has availability to the mystery of Christ but sometimes it takes time before God reveals things to you it's in his time you'll get it all you might not even get it off of your mind we probably won't but you'll get just enough and you'll get so full in your soul that this body can't take the Revelation anymore and you'll get a new body and that's what it's all about anyway he's not going to hand out rewards on the other side with how many message books we read and how much knowledge we had and how we could break down the Seven Seals there'll be no rewards for that it's that we got enough full of Revelation that we got out of here in a body change ah somebody ought to shout Glory Hallelujah tonight amen it's about relationship it's about relation with a relationship and then everything works out of that I remember when I was speaking about the Old Testament God came down and I read you the scriptures I want a kingdom of priest he didn't he didn't want to see him as the children of Israel he wanted to see him grow mature adults and mature priests a people who are close to me and follow me and love me with all their heart soul mind and strength this is the some of the first things God come out of God's mind when he spoke through Moses he said I want a people for my name's sake and I want a people that love me with all their heart soul mind this was before the law this is before the codes this is before the dietary laws this was before what came out of the mountain God was saying his purpose I want to I want to be in relationship with people until somebody says I love you Lord with all of my heart so mind and strength and if you'll keep that then whatever I bring you is the word of God I know you'll do it because you love me I know you do it because you're in relationship with me and I know when you don't understand it you'll come to me and say God I don't understand but I still love you none of this you better show me Lord I'm bailing out that's not relationship learn something about relationship and marriage or anything else it is not a Godly relationship when in every moment you're threatening to bail out he better not offend me or I'll just bail out what kind of marriage would that be watch it Buster you say something to me hubby I'll just bail out that's not relationship relationship in God is eternal love you come back into a cycle you got out of the cycle of love but it's an eternal love it doesn't give up and you jump into that cycle and there's no getting saved every year at Camp there's no backsliding for several years you come into relationship it's an eternal love and you may not understand everything but there's one thing can never Satan can never take away this love and passion that I feel for God it's a relationship with him praise be to God amen you know I can preach that with fire because that's what I came into at 16 years old and I've seen a lot of stuff but when I can go in the morning have my devotions and I still have this love I've got a sponge God show me something in your word I come to you and I talk to him he talks back to me I may not understand a lot of things other ministers do but nobody has been able to take away what happened to me when I was 16 years old I came into relationship with Jesus Christ through this message I met the god of William Branham I met the Christ of William Branham it's not about a man to me it's about Christ I came into relationship and the devil's never been able to brother Ken the devil has never been able to take that relationship away I have failed I have made mistakes I have done done things but he's Satan has never been able to steal that relationship and when you peel back all the laters that's what counts anyway that's what counts right if you can go back in your life if you can't you better seek the Lord say Lord I need a relationship this is a religion to me I'm putting it on but if you get sick go back and say whatever age it was I know that I know God dealt with me and I come into relationship with him you ought to cling to that say if you got off track say I'm clinging that because I know God dealt with me then and I'm going to start working off of there is that okay so God come down and says I want a people that loves me with all their heart soul mind and strength that's what he wanted then he gave the law through the pro through a prophet and then I'm going somewhere with this then here's what brother Bob said they the people chose law over Grace and God never sent the law of Moses through the prophet for them to make it a law and choose okay now we got do's and don'ts we do this we don't do this we do this God never intended to for it to become a law in their lifestyle he intended for them to continue to walk by grace and relationship and to realize everything that he was bringing was to be approached through that relationship that he they loved him with all their heart because you can never say like denominations say the law that's finished we only go with the New Testament that's a lie that's not true what came from Moses was from God God didn't say I'm going to send them a law and they'll be condemned by it well the law does continue but Grace gets set you free can you say Amen but God didn't send those things to be mean to the people he sent them for a reason but he never intended for people to live by law live by that law but to live by his grace and relationship so now brother Bram says it this way one quote I have tonight they were baptized repented and were baptized and come to walk in New in a new life in a new land in a new newest newness of Journey amongst new people and the hand of God was upon them but it finally came to a place this this in this walk that they had that they was not satisfied with their walk of Grace they had to come to something that they could do themselves now that's where people think today of Divine Healing or some other work of grace of God that there's something you have to do you there's nothing that you have to do but believe just believe God and they if they would have continued on the promise wasn't given them under the law the promise was given before the law without any conditions to it I have given you this land go on over into it but before they got to that promise they decided there was something they must do themselves and that we still find that among human beings we're prone to be that way there is something we've got to do that's why people gravitate towards religions that's why people frustrated and reaching out to God I need to better my life I need to do something so they find a religion and that lays it all out you do this you don't do this you do this you dress this way you do this and it lays it all and that's a comfort to them says okay now if this is God that's what he asked me to do and I'm going to feel better if I just do the do's and don'ts it's not a walk of Grace because you're doing it to you're doing it to pay for your sins you're doing it to avoid hell and God's grace says you don't take care of avoiding hell yourself I went to the cross and I took of I took the place so you wouldn't have to go to hell it's either Grace or it's not Grace it's either all Grace can you say Amen or it's not and people jump to these religions let me finish the quote um we're prone to be that way there's something we've got to do we feel that that we've got to have something into it also you do have something into it um you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will your own ideas to the will and idea of almighty God and it's finished that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and God does the rest of it then they wanted a law and God always gives you the desire of your heart he promised to but we find out when they turn one step from the side of what God originally promised then that was The Thorn In the Flesh until the law was taken away until Jesus Christ came as a craft was crucified to take away the law it was a thorn in their flesh and anything that you try to do within yourself it'll always work to your dishonor it'll work to your dis disadvantage just simply believe God and that settles it what God promised I'm the Lord thy God and heals all thy diseases see if there's any sick among you let them call for the elves of the church you see what brother bam says keep it simple don't complicate it don't make it works I got to do this I gotta do this just keep it Grace keep it simple the word says this I believe it I'm going to apply the word let him do the work keep it simple amen uh he says now why do we have to accept organizations before so forth that will right off that write that off the book see it becomes The Thorn In the Flesh and here at the end time we meet the thing again face to face it's up to the Methodist Baptists Presbyterians and what more you see you can't go on you've got to come to the entire Full Gospel it was made for the full Man by a complete God who was made flesh and dwelt among us and we know that those things are true now if we notice in their journey in the wilderness is where they got their greatest mistake that Israel ever made until Calvary was win in Exodus 19. they accepted law instead of Grace they had Grace and they had a prophet they had a sacrificial lamb they had Redemption they had been brought through the Red Sea they have been healed of their diseases they had water from the smitten Rock they had a Manna Out of Heaven everything they had need of had been supplied and still they wanted something else now when I read that I don't say that it was wrong for God to send the law it's that the people chose the law over over a walk of Grace God provided them God provided him a prophet a sacrificial lamb and he gave him a promise and all they need is I believe the promise I'm going to go take it by God's grace I've got a sacrificial lamb to bring for my bring for my sins can you say amen and God sent a prophet and guess what that's all they needed for relationship to go on to become Kings and Priests yeah you understand in the Old Testament we still needed Calvary for the soul but in that they chose law over Grace because we do that because we want to do something give me something to do and we do do things but we don't do it out of Duty it must come forth out of a relationship every day with this living being Christ it is the only way the law was of God but they chose living that instead of the grace relationship the early church now we moved to the early church we read today the early church began to fall to that themselves when they when we do this and we don't do this that's what came out we need to do this we need to not do that and they clung to that instead of relationship and Satan did that work he misdirected them he took things you need to do this you need to do that I'm going to read a scripture in a minute that's quite revealing about that in the early church so now they clung to do's and don'ts instead of the relationship but if you you stay in a close relationship of Grace he will produce the do's and don'ts by grace in you can I say that if you stay in close relationship in a walk of Grace he will produce the do's and don'ts and the signs Miracles and wonders by his grace in you living in the spirit the church world can't seem to get it right some message Pockets don't seem to get it right they dump out the church order you know the church world is dumped out Church order they dumped out modesty they dumped out any further Revelation there's not any further revelation of this Bible it's literally we look at it literally and as we found last Wednesday night with further rap if you look at the Book of Genesis or Revelations literally you're going to get yourself all messed up there's a spiritual symbolism there can you say Amen but the church says no we're not going there that's the revelation God doesn't give a personal revelation to somebody he doesn't he gave one to Peter where do you get that God doesn't bring a personal residence right from God straight to the person you're totally off the word God never gives something new and brings something to a prophet of this age oh yeah he does it's all in the Bible but he brings it back to the church again it's all laying there can you say Amen so the church dumps out Church order that's why they have all these meals and everything in the church and yelling across the church and parties in the church and uh and they dump out modesty that's not important anymore for the revelation we dump out that I just want my simple Jesus but I don't want all the other stuff that's not what we're doing we don't dump it out but we say let the Holy Ghost bring me into all of it if it's the word I want it but I want to do it out of the craving and love for God in my heart what's laying in that message Lord if it's the word I want it but I want to do it out of a craving and love for God's word is this okay with everybody so now you have that happen in the book of Acts I wonder if the same thing happened in the last days yes God brought all the word restored in the last days I was talking to a brother the other day and he's asking you know the whole history of the 60 years of this message since the word came to us restored to us again and you have to say may not be able to put this publicly I don't know but we have to be honest to say I wonder if the same cycle happened is that now we come into a relationship with God the holy spirit is poured out upon us in the last days right we come into relationship but then God brings Church order God brings things that talk about what a man should wear a woman should wear God brings all these other things which is all essential for us for the last days but people do the same thing they choose to jump onto those things and leave relationship in the dust could it be we've done the same thing with the message instead of it being as brother Brown called a message of Grace it becomes a message of disgrace and law and do's and don'ts until people become Bound by their quotes you didn't tell me God ever intended the quotes to bind us you think God does that no man does it preachers bind the people with quotes bind up the sisters with quotes God never intended for those quotes to bind up our sisters we believe the quotes and it's just I love that from the brother Sunday night talking to the young people and saying that Moses my servant is dead and he makes a personal connection with Joshua and says as I was in Moses I will be with you and it's a personal relationship with Joshua it wasn't going to be I'm just going to duplicate what Moses did that wasn't it God said I'll be with you like I was with Moses because God doesn't say I'm going to go through just I'm going to go through Moses still even though he's dead I'm going to keep using him and you're just supposed to no no no no God's about relationship I want a personal relationship with Joshua and those that are going in the Promised Land I want to tell you that every place your foot your foot not Moses foot every foot your foot shall go it'll be possession to you and you'll take the land somebody say praise the Lord amen look at this real quickly I noticed this today act the book of Acts verse 15. it just was just a maybe not even years and look what starts to happen in the book of Acts acts 15 verse 1. so now and I want to talk about the positive relationship in the book of Acts with God and with one another we're going to get to a lot of that but I just want to stop and look at this Antichrist spirit that enters the book of Acts right away through men and it says and certain men everybody remember that now certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now they're coming to new Christians that had come to the message of the hour circumcision had had been lost because God was bringing the true circumcision of the soul of the Holy Ghost they didn't understand that they came from being Pharisees but they believed and came in to the message certain men it didn't come from Satan on a cloud somewhere it was through preachers that actually traveled down to these new converts and said you know what praise the Lord you came to God and you're feeling this uh great Revival and God's changed you but except you be circumcised after the matter of Moses you cannot be saved these are guys that come in to the message of the hour and they're bringing their past up and misleading these new converts when therefore Moses Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension in disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go to Jerusalem under the apostles and Elders about this question and being brought on their way by the church they passed through uh fanis and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received at the church and of the Apostles and Elders all the work Paul and Barnabas did was a great work of the Lord go into the Gentiles and they the church received them the church Elders received them they declared all things that God had done with them but there arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees now I want you to notice this now certain of the sect of Pharisees which believed so already in the church you have those that don't have the Holy Ghost that carried over and it says they believed and that's why just believing from the intellect is not good enough believing from the heart is what you need and so these men come into the church and they were a sect of the Pharisees which was the religion they came from in the past if you come from Baptist you come from methodists you come from Catholic you come from many denominations and the systems of denominations when you come to the Lord you've got to be washed of all those former things can you say amen and say Lord what is your truth what is being what is being held back from me my brother and sister who may be listening here I don't say this to be mean but you better look at your life because those systems can hold you back like these and you hold on to old traditions that have been taught to you by a denomination and it may not be the truth and so these certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed so they were amongst the crowd of the new message Believers saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and Elders came together to consider this matter and when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and Brethren ye know how God that a good while ago God made Choice Among Us that the Gentiles by the mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us Brothers You've got to admit without your help they received the same Holy Ghost the Gentiles did is what we got you know what he's saying that's the end of the story you don't complicate it anymore than that there's no dispute there's no arguing there's no putting circumcision on this because what's the proof they come into relationship without any of you I wonder if that's the way Peter said it that day probably not hey guys it's a settled argument they've got the same thing we've got and you didn't have to they didn't have to be circumcised to get it so what are you trying to teach these new converts and God which knows the hearts better than witness giving the Holy Ghost as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to Bear but we believe that through the grace of the through what through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved come into relationship then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnos and Paul declaring that What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them and after they held their peace James uh answered saying men and brother and hearken unto me and so Peter says it to him it wasn't Paul and bars Peter stood behind him uh uh uh James who's the Elder of the church there in Jerusalem he backed him up and says we are not going to put anything extra on these new converts because here listen if they need to come to anything they got the same holy ghost that we did and the same Holy Ghost will bring us into what we need by grace instead of you taking some old tradition and requirement how many knows that they did it to the Galatians the whole book of Galatians in your Bible is dedicated to men coming in and requiring circumcision of new Gentiles the Galatians they fell for it and Paul wrote in the Galatians says the brothers why are you listening to these men why are you being moved from the Liberty God has brought you into you know what he said who hath Bewitched you you Galatians who did it Pharisees men that came to the message from Pharisees but they didn't get a true birth so they're bringing all their stuff to these new converts and Paul said they've Bewitched you they've cast a spell on you Stand Fast in the Liberty that you once had and through Paul and through Paul's letters and through the word the Galatians finally come out and they probably saying I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about you amen It's All About You Jesus that's probably what they were saying imagine I don't know we're coming back to where we started in the Liberty God gave us and we won't buy Bound by a yoke of bondage from other men that's injecting other things in the quotes I say this to ministers I guess I can say it to you that for so many years we heard several things that the prophet had said in certain quotes and then many of those things and it was preached you better do it you better do it you know don't wear a mustache because anybody who's wearing a mustache is hiding something That was supposed to be a quote and guess what none of us can find it it's not there so not only do we have to deal with preaching to the people the things and giving value of what the prophet said now we got additions and a lot of it came from old Pentecostal Holiness standards you know you have long sleeves and I got them tonight so I'm I'm holy but anyway you have lost these you don't wear a short sleeve shirt you don't wear a wedding ring all these things come from the Holiness that were add-ons I'm not interested in those things I'm interested what the prophet said but you get these quotes as they stick with quotes they'll go well let me look it up and there's probably 10 15 20 things that he didn't say it so now people under bondage for years under under something the prophet didn't even say it's a reality and it's been bringing their old Pharisee system ideas with them into that's why we could have very Baptists atmospheres within our ranks because they don't believe in the moving of the spirit some of them they don't believe in letting the spirit do have its way and then we can have very Pentecostal Slants come in the message as well that go overboard sometimes because they're bringing all of that and listen you don't you don't have to bring any of that in with you let God do it his own way get in the spirit get free in the spirit let the Revelation come stimulation of Revelation you don't have to work it up you don't have to have a pep rally to work the people into motion preach the word preach the Revelation and the stimulation of revelation will make some people cry and weep make some people shout the aisles we actually will shout and scream can you say Amen some of them just sit and and stand in awe but it's the holy spirit let the Holy Spirit do it the way he wants to do it amen praise the Lord I don't know what time it is because the clock's not working back there so I guess I just keep going praise the Lord but that's quite a scripture hold on to that acts 15 and look at that in Acts 15 already in relationship with they'd come to in the upper room in Acts 15 already there's men that's trying to influence to take him from the liberty and the relationship that we're in to add on these things to where a person would say oh I've got to do that so they maybe some of them they go and be circumcised and they realize later you didn't need to go do that the word doesn't say to do that now you've already been circumcised by the Holy Ghost you see be careful we don't put our hands and add to this thing certain men early on they got it wrong the influence the new people the message a certain sect of Pharisees which believed can you say man they believed look at the Simplicity of the early church though and what they were doing and it says they continued steadfast consistent in fellowship and in the apostles doctrines and teachings so now we're just moving into what did this look like you know what they're saying if it says they continued steadfast how many want to be like the book of Acts Church they were in such a relationship that this is one of the first things it mentions that they continued consistent and steadfast all the time staying around the presence of the Lord staying around the fellowship staying around the doctrines of the Apostles basically they were just saying I just want to be Lord I just want to be where you are this is simplicity their relationship was just simple to say I don't know what all I need to do yet but I just want to be where the Lord is I'm in such a relationship with him that if I gather in that house if they invite me over I'm going to go over and I'm going to choose that many times over what else I have to do because I just want to be in this Fellowship I want to be where he is and then without churches I want to be there there was none of this church registration and church you know I'll give you so much if you come 10 times a year what a ridiculous you never have to do that with people that are hungry for God and in relationship with God you never have to force people to come to church it it's it works from a hunger just say well I'm so tired my children don't come to church and some of my families they don't come to church well I as a pastor get weary of that too but you see now you what you need to pray for don't get mad pray for their hunger to increase for God because if their hunger increases you don't have to tell them to come to church you don't have to tell them to listen online I always have to mention that because many of the people can't make it this far for Wednesday night but they're listening in why are they listening in consistently consistently staying close to the apostles doctrine of those why are they doing it consistently because they want to be where he is they want to be where he is Lord I'm in a relationship I want to be where you are and if you don't think we have today the same thing the prophet said that people are staying home now watching I Love Lucy on Wednesday night while prayer meeting is going on if you don't think that's happening now you're crazy it's happening probably even in our own assembly that they're watching other shows and doing other entertainments on Wednesday night where the church is going on it's it's where we live can you say Amen it's it's the culture we live in pray that God increases the hunger listen friends this is a there's a famine in the land you ought to pray say God increase my Hunger to be in relationship with increase my Hunger for More Of You show me I want to be wherever you are Lord I don't want to ever get distance come on wake up friends Putin just this afternoon Putin is making a threat to the United States how many heard it Biden said something to to ruffle him up and he says listen he put a warning out to the United States this is going this direction if you keep saying this you doing this he said this is a warning this is I'm going to open up this nuclear thing you don't think we're headed in that direction read what he said today read what what Putin said today and I just seen it just before church and I say praise the Lord I'm going to go worship God I'm ready to go let the bombs fall let the bombs fall I know that's where it's going and it may be coming sooner than you all think maybe come a lot sooner than you think it's prophesied to come amen it's not going to be held up for that much longer yeah he put out a warning to us this country the West he called it a warning to the West this is the direction is going if things don't change for him because Biden said today he said that he shamelessly has done these things that are off the U.N Council on how you're supposed to do war and he disrebuked him for it and Putin responded with a threat to the West praise the Lord they wanted to be what time is it they wanted to be wherever he was and consistently be there that's the relationship of the New Testament Church that's that's relationship of the redeemed they wanted to be at the Lord's supper and breaking bread together they wanted to be in prayers it says they wanted to be together in Fellowship they wanted to be identified together I want to identify with that people this is what this is relationship is a relationship you don't want to be identified with them no relationship from the Holy Ghost is I want to be identified with him and guess what there was no big eyes or little used or rich people or poor people you didn't base it on that I want to be with them I don't care if they have a million dollars I don't have any dollars if they're Holy Ghost people I want to be around them see what if you don't like their personality it has nothing to do with it [Music] it's hard on some people I think because there's some personalities you just don't like to be around and you might as well just admit I don't won't ask you to raise your hand I'll raise mine but there's some that get at you might even be your mother-in-law or your father-in-law I don't know and praise the Lord so and then together they had all things common they were all common were the same there's no great ones the system of the world of positions great and little and for God to present an agape love coming in the people and that's what they were living out Agape a selfless a Selfless Love was so contrary to the culture in the book of Acts days because the Greek culture was it actually mocked that kind of unselfish love they mocked it and God comes down by the Holy Ghost and brings such an unselfish love you got people selling their goods to meet the needs in the church something happened to him it was completely against culture you don't sell you don't do that who cares you they should make their own living all that's washed away and they cared about someone else can you say Amen they cared about someone else and John McArthur says the greatest virtue of the Christian Life Is Love the use of agape love was rare in Pagan Greek literature doubtless because the concept represented unselfish self-giving willful devotion was so uncommon in that culture it was even ridiculed and despised as a sign of weakness but in the New Testament it is proclaimed as the Supreme virtue The Virtue agape love the Supreme virtue The Virtue under which all others assumed Agape loved Sinners on the needs and the welfare of the one loved and will pay whatever personal price is necessary to meet those needs and Foster the welfare of that other person and it began to work because of relationship with God something began to work something Satan can never have something Satan can never understand Divine Agape Selfless Love for the body of Christ giving up our lives to God completely giving a full surrender in him he never forced me to do it I gave it up I gave everything to him and then a Selfless Love to one another that I'm not going to judge that person based upon what they wear or their degrees or if they treated me bad I will not judge them and hold a grudge because they treated me wrong and spit at me put me down Paul without the Holy Ghost persecuted the true church that's what he did so what is it when persons persecuting those among themselves and putting them down there ain't no Holy Ghost there yet but with the Holy Ghost he became a servant to the body of Christ and express the love of God he didn't he didn't have to go to preach to the generals he had to go to the whole world he didn't travel on those ships and be you know storms and washed ashore and he didn't have to do all that what was it agape love a selfless life if you want a marriage it's a selfless selfless marriage it's not about yourself it's how can I meet the needs of that other person can you say Amen this is about relationship when a couple fall in love and it's genuine love not lust because lust has a thing they want to be together too all the time but they want to be together for the wrong reasons they want to be sneaky and secret and they want to be together but they want to be together for the wrong reasons but genuine pure love for one another wants to be together that person I went through that with my wife I wanted to be with her that's why my phone bill was 900 when I got back home we didn't have cell phones am I that old when I got home from my honeymoon I they were they shut my phone off as 900. because why she lived in Tennessee and I just wanted to talk and be on the phone sometimes we were talking I just heard her breathing I was good enough for me and we have an example in a young love all of you married couples have experienced that young love that you know what it's it's a relationship and the relationships I just want to be around them I'll travel to Tennessee I'll travel to Florida wherever they're at and if you don't have to travel you'll be over their house every night you always want to be with them and if that on that level of marriage and Young Love if that relationship is about I want to be around this person shouldn't that be the core of the Christian walk is I I don't understand all the Mysteries but I I'm in a relationship and I want to stay close to my Lord come on Kenny I want to be close to my Lord I just want to be where you are Lord what a song Come and sing again I just want to be where you are dwelling daily in your presence I don't want to worship from afar draw me near to where you are can you understand friends this message is about relationship so much so that the last paragraph in the church age book brother Branham says not for one moment do I bring a message to start an organization or to start another denomination or build something around me I'm paraphrasing but that's that's just of it he said but I come to accomplish one thing to establish a relationship between the people and Jesus Christ this message are you listening don't ever forget this message come from God and it's to bring us into perfect relationship with him amen let's stand the funeral service will be tomorrow Thursday September 22nd the funeral service will be at
