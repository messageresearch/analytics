[0:00] colonians chapter 2
[0:02] and verse 1 through 17 i know it's
[0:04] lengthy but i want to catch
[0:06] all of this and that way i can refer
[0:07] back to it
[0:09] and how many just really love the lord
[0:11] this morning hungry for his word
[0:13] amen so we have that in common this
[0:15] morning i think we think that we're in
[0:17] the right place at the right time and
[0:19] god knows our hunger
[0:21] and he knows what we need
[0:23] and i pray this will be a blessing to
[0:25] you this morning as we yield to the lord
[0:27] i want to thank the lord for the
[0:28] opportunity to minister to that age
[0:31] group at byc this year it was a great
[0:33] joy
[0:34] the kids took to it very well i was
[0:36] speaking to the 14 to 18 year olds it's
[0:39] about 225 of them there and
[0:41] man they just took to it real well and
[0:43] responded and i went there particularly
[0:45] for them
[0:46] and we had a real nice time of teaching
[0:48] in the lord and they responded very good
[0:50] hearing a lot of good things back not
[0:52] only from them but some of the
[0:54] ministers and pastors who were listening
[0:56] in i didn't know it was live but i guess
[0:58] it was a lot listening in and so we're
[0:59] thankful for the support that we have
[1:02] and that's my little niche there is to
[1:04] speak to young people that age group i
[1:06] really like to grab them and get their
[1:08] attention through the word of god so we
[1:10] had a real good time it was actually fun
[1:13] i enjoyed it having more fun than a
[1:15] human being should be allowed to have
[1:16] and we just had a great great time with
[1:18] them and we appreciate the opportunity
[1:21] to
[1:22] catch these souls
[1:23] and there's great challenges to our
[1:25] young people today
[1:27] the devil's fighting harder and is
[1:29] harder the battle's harder than it's
[1:31] ever been before if you run out of
[1:33] things to pray about you should pray for
[1:35] our young people
[1:36] and the hour that they live in that god
[1:39] will give them a chance and call their
[1:42] hearts and give them the atmosphere that
[1:43] they can receive the lord it's so
[1:46] important today that they go on with the
[1:47] lord because they cannot i don't think
[1:50] they can go against the challenges that
[1:51] we have today without a true birth of
[1:54] the holy ghost
[1:55] and so we pray them through to that and
[1:57] teach them and train them and and create
[2:00] the right atmosphere you can do that
[2:01] this morning in the service can you say
[2:03] man
[2:04] god can do many things if you'll put in
[2:06] and create a right atmosphere make the
[2:07] lord welcome he can do many things while
[2:09] the words being preached second
[2:11] thessalonians chapter 2
[2:13] now we beseech you brethren by the
[2:14] coming of our lord jesus christ
[2:16] and by the gathering together unto him
[2:18] that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be
[2:22] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[2:25] nor by letters as from us as that the
[2:27] day of christ is at hand
[2:29] let no man deceive you by any means for
[2:31] that day shall not come except there
[2:33] come a falling away first and that man
[2:36] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[2:39] so we're talking about the last days
[2:41] here and it is a day of deception and it
[2:44] is a day that many shall fall away so
[2:46] they were they were with the truth but
[2:48] there will be many fall away because
[2:50] it's an hour of deception that's that's
[2:52] prophecy for our time
[2:54] and then he speaks of the son of
[2:56] perdition who opposeth and exalted
[2:58] himself above all that is called god and
[3:00] in his worship so that he as god sitteth
[3:03] in the temple of god showing himself
[3:05] that he is god remember ye not that when
[3:07] i was yet with you i told you these
[3:09] things and now we know what withholdeth
[3:13] that he might be revealed in his time
[3:16] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[3:18] work only he who now letteth will let
[3:20] until he be taken out of the way and
[3:22] that's saying that the spirit of the
[3:24] antichrist was already working in paul's
[3:26] day the mystery of iniquity was already
[3:28] working and although he's talking about
[3:30] the day when the antichrist becomes
[3:32] incarnate and his characteristics there
[3:35] will be a time that the antichrist
[3:37] spirit will be exposed by the message of
[3:39] the hour before it's incarnate in a man
[3:42] we see that the spirit will be exposed
[3:44] and we see the spirit is all the ways
[3:45] back in paul's day as he's writing to
[3:48] the thessalonians it's already beginning
[3:50] to work in the church verse 8 and then
[3:53] shall that wicked be revealed whom the
[3:54] lord shall consume with the spirit of
[3:56] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[3:58] brightness brightness of his coming even
[4:01] him now listen now even him who's coming
[4:03] is after the working of satan with all
[4:05] power and signs and lying wonders lying
[4:10] wonders in other words we live in the
[4:12] age of lies
[4:15] satan is the father of lies
[4:18] so one of the distinction is we live in
[4:20] the age of lies and he'll do lying
[4:23] wonders that's why the deception is
[4:25] there it'll be a lie it won't be the
[4:26] truth but it will be so close in the
[4:28] evening time it'll look like the truth
[4:30] look like the real thing but that's the
[4:32] most deceiving you can get is that it
[4:34] looks like the truth and yet it's a lie
[4:36] and with all deceivableness of
[4:38] unrighteousness in them that perish
[4:40] because
[4:41] they received not the love of the truth
[4:43] that they might be saved so here's the
[4:46] problem is that you cannot go up against
[4:49] this lying age unless you receive
[4:52] something and what you receive is a love
[4:56] for truth
[4:58] how many want that this morning
[5:00] not up here but a love and a desire
[5:03] i'm going to pursue truth i want to know
[5:05] the truth if you don't have that a love
[5:08] for truth then you'll be succumbed by
[5:10] lies
[5:11] but if god puts by the holy ghost within
[5:13] you a love for truth you're always going
[5:15] to be pursuing the truth
[5:18] whether it's in god's word or in
[5:19] relationships what i'm going to talk
[5:21] about this morning in relationships my
[5:23] bottom line is that if you love the
[5:25] truth and you're always pursuing truth
[5:27] even in relationships with one another
[5:29] you're waiting to get to the truth
[5:33] and for this cause god shall send them
[5:35] strong delusion because they won't
[5:37] receive the love of the truth some
[5:39] they'll they'll come under a strong
[5:41] delusion that they should believe a lie
[5:43] so a lot of people will will swallow the
[5:46] lies because they haven't received the
[5:48] love of the truth and because actually
[5:50] god sends a strong delusion over them
[5:53] that they might all be damned who
[5:54] believe not the truth once again they
[5:56] didn't believe the truth but had
[5:58] pleasure and unrighteousness
[6:00] all right so that's that all looks
[6:01] pretty uh pretty dim
[6:03] pretty uh negative it's truthful but
[6:06] it's this is what has is happening
[6:09] but i thank god for the rest of these
[6:10] scriptures because he says verse 13
[6:14] but we are bound to give thanks always
[6:16] to god for you brethren beloved of the
[6:19] lord because god hath from the beginning
[6:23] chosen you to salvation through
[6:25] sanctification of the spirit and what
[6:28] belief of the truth
[6:30] i'm going to say the same thing that
[6:32] paul said here i'm going to say i thank
[6:34] god every day that there's some
[6:36] individuals on the face of the earth
[6:38] that are called from the foundation of
[6:40] the world and they in this age of lies
[6:43] are going to believe the truth
[6:45] i am thankful i want to just thank god
[6:47] thank you lord that you're going to have
[6:49] a bride in the last days
[6:51] thank you i'm thankful i'm thankful for
[6:53] my congregation this morning i'm
[6:55] thankful for your lives i'm thankful
[6:57] you're here i'm thankful for your hunger
[6:59] in this age we live in where there's a
[7:01] famine in the land for the hearing of
[7:02] the word you're here hungry to hear the
[7:05] word of god i'm thankful for you this
[7:07] morning i'm thankful for the bride of
[7:09] jesus christ i'm thankful for people who
[7:12] through that have been chosen from the
[7:14] foundation of the world through and
[7:16] through sanctification of the spirit and
[7:18] belief of the truth whereunto he called
[7:21] you by our gospel to the obtaining of
[7:24] the glory of our lord jesus therefore
[7:26] brethren stand fast and hold the
[7:29] traditions which he have been taught
[7:31] whether by word or by epistle
[7:34] people make traditions a bad word
[7:35] there's some good traditions and that's
[7:37] the word of god and he says in this hour
[7:39] you better hold fast to them
[7:42] don't move the boundary lines don't move
[7:44] uh don't don't try to change standards
[7:47] just leave them the way they are
[7:49] now our lord jesus christ himself and
[7:52] god even our father which hath loved us
[7:54] has given us everlasting consolation and
[7:56] good hope through grace comfort your
[7:58] hearts and establish you in every good
[8:01] work and word heavenly father bless your
[8:04] word as we enter into it we pray that
[8:06] lord you'll send your great holy spirit
[8:09] into our hearts and father may you break
[8:11] the bread of life to us lord give us a
[8:13] good day lord as we partake of your
[8:15] supper tonight together wash one
[8:17] another's feet we pray you'll just bless
[8:18] the whole day bless your word bless our
[8:21] fellowship lord we're looking forward to
[8:23] just spending the entire day in worship
[8:26] to you in testimony to you lord we're
[8:28] just looking forward to it may you bless
[8:30] each one of us our visitors and those
[8:32] that are listening online this morning i
[8:34] pray that you'll anoint the word that
[8:36] someone could be helped in the kingdom
[8:38] of god in jesus name we ask it amen god
[8:41] bless you may be seated
[8:44] now this morning i feel uh that i'm
[8:46] going to try my best to summarize
[8:48] and finish up this little series that
[8:51] we've been on talking about
[8:53] relationships after the fall and the
[8:55] fall i'm referring to in the beginning
[8:57] when we fell
[8:58] and i've been talking a little bit about
[9:00] relationships that took that were
[9:03] different before the fall and everything
[9:05] changed after the fall i'm going to do
[9:06] my best to summarize
[9:08] that this morning and wrap it up because
[9:11] i really believe that a great part of
[9:13] this is coming
[9:14] if the lord will allow us as we begin to
[9:17] talk about relationships after
[9:19] redemption
[9:22] you know it's one thing to talk about
[9:25] all the
[9:26] things that we fell from and how it
[9:28] makes us act and the serpent nature that
[9:30] we were born with
[9:32] and uh to to be real honest with you
[9:34] it's quite a burden on a minister and i
[9:37] lean a certain way i'm different than
[9:38] other ministers every minister is
[9:40] different but it's it's quite a burden
[9:42] when you go through a series that's
[9:43] laboring on things that are really bad
[9:46] things that we do and bad interactions
[9:49] with others and relationship those
[9:51] aren't really shouting services you're
[9:53] not going to have people hanging from
[9:54] the rafters and dancing and shouting and
[9:57] it's quite a burden and quite a labor on
[9:59] me to labor in those things because the
[10:01] response may not be quite as exciting as
[10:05] when you're talking about the joy of the
[10:07] holy spirit
[10:09] i can preach on the joy of the holy
[10:10] spirit and i will again
[10:14] but and but we tend to enjoy things that
[10:17] are that bring the joy of the lord and
[10:19] the joy of the spirit and and
[10:21] and and that's all fine uh but when
[10:23] you're on these things just laboring and
[10:25] plowing with it it's more planting seeds
[10:28] and it's not the greatest shouting
[10:30] services and when we feel the conviction
[10:32] of the holy spirit rather than the joy
[10:35] of the holy spirit it's a bit different
[10:37] the joy is a lot more popular today
[10:40] can you say man the the joy is a lot
[10:43] more popular and i enjoy the joy of the
[10:45] lord but it's good to see sometimes
[10:48] where we're short
[10:50] where our shortcomings are
[10:52] because the devil actually he doesn't
[10:55] like things to be talked about where
[10:56] we're short he doesn't like that because
[10:59] if you get victories in the areas where
[11:01] you're short that's when the devil is
[11:03] really on the run
[11:06] when people will come under conviction
[11:07] and say i've been a christian for years
[11:09] but i'll tell you i'm really learning
[11:10] something from the lord here that i need
[11:12] to i need to give this to the lord i've
[11:14] given all this i've given my my tithes
[11:16] i've given my all these other things but
[11:18] i i realized an area today that i'm
[11:21] doing to my family or my children in my
[11:23] relationships or my relationship to god
[11:25] and i realized i recognize an area where
[11:28] i'm sure and brother branham actually
[11:30] said that he says we don't come to
[11:31] church to get patted on our back or to
[11:33] hear all the good things we actually
[11:34] come to hear our short areas our
[11:37] shortcomings where we can say where we
[11:39] can yield more
[11:41] can i get an amen this morning that's
[11:43] that's really why we come to church and
[11:45] so it's good to see where we're short
[11:47] and not just where we're thriving and
[11:49] that way we can keep growing how many
[11:51] want to keep growing this morning we
[11:53] want to keep growing and a constant
[11:56] atmosphere of energy that says we're
[11:58] right we're right we're right a constant
[12:01] atmosphere all the time of that that
[12:03] we're right may bring pride and that we
[12:06] are
[12:07] the only ones that are right and that we
[12:09] can never be wrong
[12:13] let me say it again if you only have an
[12:15] atmosphere where you're preaching you're
[12:17] right you're right you're good you're
[12:19] good you're the bride you're the bride
[12:21] and never cr never any correction in our
[12:23] lives it can tend to lead to a pride
[12:26] that people start thinking well we must
[12:28] be the only ones that are right and we
[12:30] could never be wrong i'm always right
[12:32] and that is a deception
[12:37] let me say this way so the kids can
[12:38] understand it some medicine that you
[12:40] take doesn't really taste well going
[12:42] down
[12:43] but it's what the doctor ordered and you
[12:44] need it
[12:46] can you say amen
[12:48] so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this down
[12:51] after these weeks and bring it down to a
[12:53] summary and talk about relationships
[12:55] after the fall and summarize so adam and
[12:57] eve and just tell the story just real
[12:59] quickly okay and this all we've been
[13:01] preaching on
[13:02] adam and eve
[13:04] who enjoyed a perfect oneness with god
[13:07] brother brahman says they were in
[13:08] perfect harmony perfect oneness perfect
[13:10] fellowship not only with god but with
[13:12] one another there was no shame there was
[13:14] no guilt it was a perfect oneness with
[13:16] god before the fall they had unhindered
[13:19] fellowship and love with god and love
[13:22] with one another and and it was
[13:25] unhindered there was nothing there was
[13:26] no guilt there was no shame there was
[13:28] nothing there and so they had unhindered
[13:30] fellowship and love with god and love
[13:33] with one another and then we know that
[13:35] something
[13:36] come to break that nothing could break
[13:38] it before that something but something
[13:39] come to break all that up and all of it
[13:42] was lost all of this oneness was lost
[13:45] and broke by one thing and that is a eve
[13:49] listen to a lie
[13:51] eve the how this all started was eve
[13:55] listened to a lie she had the truth she
[13:59] had the word but then in a vulnerable
[14:01] state satan comes and he whispers and
[14:04] says to her a lie
[14:06] or we could call it a false
[14:08] interpretation instead of the truth of
[14:10] god's word it was a false interpretation
[14:13] of what god said and so we we might make
[14:17] the comment that you can't help but say
[14:19] it this morning
[14:20] and add that most of our troubles many
[14:23] times in life begin with
[14:26] misunderstandings with one another
[14:29] misinterpretations of things that get
[14:32] said
[14:33] many times our troubles begin with
[14:34] misunderstandings with one another or a
[14:37] situation being falsely interpreted to
[14:40] us or maybe uh
[14:42] reposted to us or re-said to us if i had
[14:46] this morning i say something to brother
[14:48] zach i'd say something to him or he said
[14:51] something to me to say something to
[14:53] brother ike and so now if i became the
[14:55] messenger of that he would have to trust
[14:57] me to be a messenger because if he told
[14:59] me what to say to brother ike
[15:01] in the process of me walking across the
[15:03] room and talking to him depending on my
[15:05] character that may not be get said
[15:09] exactly as how he meant it to say
[15:12] it's called misunderstanding it's called
[15:14] misinterpretation of what should have
[15:16] been said he's going to speak the truth
[15:18] but the messenger in between it is very
[15:20] important because it might get
[15:22] misinterpreted this happens every day in
[15:24] our life misunderstandings
[15:28] misinterpreted things things that are
[15:30] read wrong between one another can you
[15:33] say amen how many believe that god that
[15:35] people today misunderstand god's word
[15:39] misunderstand what it means brother
[15:41] brandt preach the message god being
[15:43] misunderstood it's a wonderful message
[15:45] god being misunderstood and because
[15:48] people haven't been taught right and the
[15:50] word pure purely presented to them they
[15:52] misunderstand god they misunderstand
[15:54] what god meant in the bible they have a
[15:57] misinterpretation and a lot of that work
[15:59] is has satan's hands on it because he's
[16:02] the misinterpreter of this word he did
[16:04] it in the garden he's still doing it
[16:06] today he's taking the truth of god's
[16:09] word which is pure has power in it will
[16:11] set you free but if it gets into satan's
[16:14] voice and whispers to you it's going to
[16:16] be misinterpreted
[16:19] and so thus we have the beginnings of
[16:21] the fall was a lie that was told to eve
[16:24] can you say amen
[16:26] one one person said it takes two to
[16:28] speak the truth
[16:30] one to speak and another to hear
[16:37] mark twain said
[16:39] get your facts first
[16:42] and then you can distort them as much as
[16:44] you please
[16:47] now
[16:48] mostly in this life people don't do that
[16:50] they don't seek the facts first
[16:53] they go ahead and misinterpret they go
[16:55] ahead and read the story read what they
[16:57] hear right off the bat and it gets
[16:59] misinterpreted and like the old phone
[17:01] thing that we used to play as it goes
[17:03] around the room to everybody you say
[17:05] something and it's so funny and so
[17:07] sometimes embarrassing what it ends up
[17:10] at the end of the of the phone call all
[17:12] of you have done that we we did that as
[17:14] a kid it was very funny and it's amazing
[17:16] you're sitting right in front of one
[17:17] another and whispering things and it's
[17:19] amazing how twisted that story is at the
[17:22] end so most of us we we don't take the
[17:24] truth most of us will take hearsay and
[17:26] then we'll misinterpret it even more
[17:28] mark twain says get your facts first and
[17:30] then you can distort them but but say i
[17:32] would say satan is more like this than
[17:34] anyone and that is that the truth is
[17:37] there the truth has been told the truth
[17:39] is present it's been spoken to his
[17:41] people and that's when satan comes in
[17:43] and starts to misinterpret the word
[17:47] and so um
[17:49] they
[17:50] so i'll read it as brother braham said
[17:52] it here in oneness he says now when adam
[17:54] and eve listened to the lie of the devil
[17:55] the holy image of god left them and
[17:58] their fellowship was broken with god
[18:00] their fellowship i don't know if you
[18:01] guys have that quote their fellowship
[18:03] was broken with god their fellowship of
[18:06] oneness with god was broken the very
[18:08] minute they listened to the lie of the
[18:10] devil that broke their fellowship and
[18:13] the very minute that you listen to the
[18:15] lie of the devil it'll break your
[18:17] fellowship that's the very minute that
[18:19] you go out from the presence of god like
[18:22] she did is when you failed to take god's
[18:25] word just as it is
[18:28] leave it alone just as it is leave it
[18:31] alone just as god said it you may not
[18:33] understand it you may not see it all yet
[18:36] but leave it alone don't ever
[18:37] misinterpret it and don't let satan
[18:39] whisper in your ear and misinterpret the
[18:41] message the word of god leave it the way
[18:43] it is can you say amen this is what he
[18:46] did to eve is what he said it didn't
[18:48] really mean what god said there it meant
[18:50] this and that's where you have your
[18:52] trouble
[18:53] that's when they broke fellowship a lie
[18:56] was told and the holy image of god left
[18:58] them their fellowship was broken in god
[19:00] their fellowship of oneness with god was
[19:02] broken and the very men they listened to
[19:03] the devil of the lie of the devil that
[19:06] broke their fellowship and the very
[19:07] minute you listened to the live the
[19:09] devil it'll break your fellowship so i'm
[19:12] trying to make it simple this morning is
[19:13] that
[19:14] fellowship and oneness with god and one
[19:16] another
[19:17] is broken by real simple things but
[19:20] they're important things and that's when
[19:22] the lies come in and start to
[19:25] unravel the truth that we already have
[19:29] that's when things begin to break up
[19:31] that's when splits happen that's when
[19:34] fellowship is broken
[19:38] and then because everything broke away
[19:42] then we find
[19:44] adam and eve and king
[19:47] right away right away acting different
[19:50] than what they did
[19:52] living under the word and living under
[19:54] truth they started to act different
[19:57] and and when you live in truth
[19:59] and live in the protection of truth
[20:02] there is a protection with it there's a
[20:04] shield against the enemy when you just
[20:07] simply live in truth
[20:11] once you step out of it and listen to
[20:13] other voices interpreted to you you're
[20:15] on dangerous ground
[20:18] but if you live in truth and you trust
[20:20] it even sometimes when you don't fully
[20:22] understand it but they say this is from
[20:23] god this is truth i'm gonna live in
[20:25] truth because truth
[20:27] truth is will always be truth can you
[20:30] say amen
[20:31] as i said last sunday the truth is
[20:33] marching on satan's trying to to take
[20:36] truth away in every generation destroy
[20:37] the value of the promised word of the
[20:39] age in every age he's tried to do it and
[20:42] yet yet satan i'll tell him this morning
[20:44] and yet all of these generations for 6
[20:47] 000 years truth still prevails he was
[20:50] never able to get rid of truth it's
[20:52] still alive today
[20:54] because truth when it is believed it may
[20:56] look like satan is going to trample upon
[20:58] it under his feet but truth will always
[21:00] prevail and truth will always be truth
[21:03] and you're going to be freer and you're
[21:05] going to be have more victories if you
[21:07] live in the truth all the time
[21:09] is that okay with everybody
[21:11] and so there you have a shield you have
[21:13] a protection from the enemy when you
[21:15] just simply
[21:16] say i'm going to live in truth
[21:18] i'm going to pursue the truth
[21:20] i'm going to find the truth i want to
[21:22] live in that protection of it there's a
[21:24] shield
[21:25] and so now when all this happens
[21:28] now another nature is driving them
[21:32] because they listen to a lie we have the
[21:35] fall of man and they listen to a lie
[21:37] about the truth now another nature and
[21:39] characteristics to that nature is
[21:41] driving them and they're acting all
[21:44] out of sort so i'm going to summarize
[21:46] now
[21:47] the first thing they started to do was
[21:49] lie themselves because they're under the
[21:50] spirit of satan which is lying
[21:54] they started to lie
[21:57] they started to blame one another
[21:59] instead of standing for one another
[22:02] i preached on that last sunday the blame
[22:04] game and blaming other people for things
[22:07] so they started lying they started
[22:09] blaming one another instead of standing
[22:10] for one they started hiding their sten
[22:12] instead of bringing it to god
[22:16] i said they started
[22:18] this is characteristics of the fall
[22:21] they started to hide
[22:23] from the presence of the lord instead of
[22:26] run towards the presence of the lord
[22:28] could everybody agree that when they
[22:30] failed the best place that they could be
[22:33] running to is back into the presence of
[22:35] the lord
[22:36] but our nature is to run from it to hide
[22:39] from it some people don't realize that
[22:41] when you're in trouble or you've made
[22:43] mistakes the best place that you can run
[22:45] to is the presence of the lord the best
[22:48] place they can get to is the house of
[22:50] god where the gospel is being preached
[22:51] but you know what most people run from
[22:53] that that's the first thing that they
[22:55] strike off their list i ain't going
[22:56] there and i'm going to go hide somewhere
[22:58] i'm going to go i'm going to take a big
[22:59] vacation that's not the way to deal with
[23:02] your struggle with your relationship
[23:03] with god if they should have been
[23:05] running back to the presence of the lord
[23:07] side god we've made a mistake here god
[23:10] have mercy on me
[23:13] but our nature where's all this nature
[23:15] come from to hide from god it's all from
[23:17] a fallen nature
[23:19] we tend to hide
[23:21] and they started hiding their stint
[23:23] instead of bringing it to god
[23:25] listen to this they took time
[23:28] and sewed fig they didn't just hide in
[23:30] the bushes they took time to sew fig
[23:32] leaves together i love how that's worded
[23:36] they they sewed the bible says they
[23:39] sewed fig leaves and aprons together
[23:42] they did it together now they have no
[23:44] oneness anymore but they somehow found
[23:46] oneness to sew fig leaves together
[23:51] so they got some oneness but it's really
[23:53] strange because they're they're they're
[23:55] saying let's let's do this and and let's
[23:58] and so they're gonna find creative ways
[24:01] to run from god and hide their shame and
[24:03] they're going to do it together in their
[24:05] marriage
[24:07] before
[24:08] they prayed together
[24:10] they fellowship together
[24:12] in purity
[24:13] they were openly in his presence and now
[24:15] they were finding ways to be out of
[24:17] church and hide from his presence
[24:23] don't forget i told you
[24:24] these type of services
[24:26] you're not going to see anybody shouting
[24:28] and running the aisles
[24:32] unless you get a victory this morning
[24:34] and when victory comes
[24:36] you could be running the isles
[24:39] because if the devil is exposed in your
[24:40] life and you respond and say god i want
[24:43] that kind of victory in my life i don't
[24:44] want some old nature guiding me i want
[24:46] the nature of the holy spirit living in
[24:48] me
[24:50] that's a victory can you say man that's
[24:51] when you shout
[24:53] but they're sowing and i can spend a lot
[24:55] of time on that because it come open
[24:56] last night how that a couple together
[24:58] working to hide from god and find
[25:00] creative ways to be away from god and
[25:02] away from
[25:03] there's a lot in there but they found
[25:05] ways together to be out of things and
[25:07] out of the present and so then the re
[25:08] then the rest of the fruit came out
[25:10] later
[25:11] because sometimes things don't manifest
[25:13] until over time and the bible says in
[25:16] the process of time then
[25:18] twins were born to eve then in the
[25:20] process of time it was these twins that
[25:22] grew up and they began to show more
[25:24] fruits from the fall i want to talk
[25:26] about that in the process of time the
[25:29] boys here wanted to worship and one boy
[25:32] brought fruit to worship with and one
[25:34] boy brought blood to worship with and
[25:36] the bible says here's some more
[25:38] characteristics cain was wroth and
[25:41] things extremely angry cain two brothers
[25:44] now twins from the same womb two
[25:46] brothers cain became roth at the worship
[25:49] of abel because god accepted
[25:52] abel's worship and he rejected cain's
[25:55] and cain became wrath he became angry
[25:58] angry anger wroth a a temper where does
[26:02] all that come from
[26:05] i'm going to make it real clear this
[26:07] morning
[26:08] all these characteristics
[26:10] do not originate in god
[26:13] they came from a person and that's satan
[26:19] don't ever justify
[26:22] and say i don't have to repent of these
[26:25] characteristics because they don't come
[26:27] i remember brother branham saying
[26:28] talking about it was either his wife or
[26:31] his daughter or someone you know and
[26:33] they got their temper up they slammed
[26:35] the door and he just makes this little
[26:37] comment he said now that's the devil
[26:40] it's just so crystal clear that's the
[26:42] devil and if you act that way
[26:45] it's the devil
[26:46] but i'm a christian well you got the
[26:48] devil on you
[26:50] okay i'm not trying to de-christianity
[26:52] but don't don't don't make it something
[26:54] well i just made a little mistake he
[26:56] said that's the devil
[26:58] making you act that way it can't come
[27:00] from god it can't come the fruits i
[27:02] don't find temper in the fruits of the
[27:04] holy spirit it's not in galatians
[27:08] i don't feel blowing off and and and
[27:11] writing people often saying all these
[27:12] bad things i don't find that in the
[27:14] fruits of the spirit but i do know the
[27:16] author of that i can go through satan's
[27:19] josiah satan's story satan's history and
[27:22] i can find gossip i can find lies i can
[27:25] find blaming can you say man i can find
[27:28] a murderous spirit all these things that
[27:30] came it came from somebody and it came
[27:32] from a nature and it came from the
[27:33] serpent nature
[27:36] don't ever justify it call it what the
[27:38] prophet said that's the devil and when
[27:40] you go to repent
[27:41] you can say i made a mistake because i
[27:42] yielded to the devil and my temper uh
[27:45] went off
[27:46] and uh i know there's some that say that
[27:49] you know hey
[27:50] uh
[27:52] i i i don't i got the holy ghost i i
[27:54] never get angry
[27:57] well you're already in your glorified
[27:59] body and i'm wondering how you got there
[28:02] before me
[28:05] because my bible says
[28:07] that i have an infirmity of the flesh i
[28:09] live in a flesh man that's not born
[28:11] again
[28:13] okay and i'm not justifying temper i'm
[28:15] not justifying sin but we make mistakes
[28:17] that we have to quickly bring to to
[28:20] repentance to one another and to god and
[28:22] with the repentance if you're really
[28:24] sincere you're saying god whatever it is
[28:26] if this keeps popping up god i want you
[28:28] to deal with it that i won't do that
[28:30] again
[28:33] that i stop doing that because it's
[28:35] destroying relationships in my life
[28:37] where's the source of this anger is
[28:39] anybody asking where's the source of my
[28:41] anger and if you keep peeling back the
[28:42] layers sometimes you can go back years
[28:44] and find there's something eating at you
[28:46] on the inside and you're blowing off at
[28:48] everybody else and you're getting mad at
[28:49] the traffic cop and you're getting mad
[28:51] because somebody pulled in front of you
[28:53] and you're not going to the source you
[28:54] think that's the problem you're blaming
[28:56] that light and you're blaming that
[28:57] person that drove out in front of you
[28:59] for your anger and you're not getting to
[29:00] the source of it when you come in christ
[29:02] you say lord get to the source of why
[29:04] i'm angry and dissolve it why am i
[29:07] bitter where's the root of bitterness
[29:09] god take your holy spirit and burn that
[29:11] bitterness out of me
[29:16] yes yes and so
[29:18] in the process of time case what king
[29:20] was wroth
[29:22] and there this is very
[29:24] not normal
[29:26] that he detested just detested abel for
[29:29] this sacrifice
[29:32] anyone should be happy
[29:34] when someone else is blessed
[29:42] normal
[29:44] people
[29:45] especially that have the holy ghost the
[29:47] normal response is if someone else is
[29:49] blessed and someone else is accepted and
[29:52] someone else prospers prospers under god
[29:55] and someone else is promoted and god
[29:57] accepts their sacrifice normal response
[30:01] should have been
[30:04] praise be to god
[30:06] you found the key
[30:09] praise be to god i rejoice with you abel
[30:12] praise the lord i i'm your brother here
[30:14] and i said it last sunday if god said
[30:16] even said to cain who was a
[30:18] directly from the serpent and we know
[30:20] that he said to him if you'll go and
[30:22] take the way of your brother i'll accept
[30:24] you
[30:27] if you'll bring blood i'll accept that's
[30:29] serpency talk about god's grace talk
[30:32] about god's mercy
[30:34] but he wouldn't do it his anger his raw
[30:36] he was he resentful he couldn't stand
[30:39] that god accepted him that able and
[30:41] didn't accept him
[30:43] you think this happened back in the
[30:44] garden it happens every day in
[30:46] relationships
[30:48] anybody should have been happy when
[30:50] someone's accepted and honored and
[30:51] promoted
[30:52] by god
[30:54] and someone goes a higher level because
[30:56] god blesses their life we should be
[30:58] standing as cheerleaders
[31:01] instead of getting resentful at that
[31:03] person
[31:04] getting mad so young people get mad
[31:06] cause somebody else gets married before
[31:08] you
[31:08] you get resentful
[31:10] towards god
[31:11] where did they get god i've been praying
[31:13] for 30 years
[31:18] i know what it is to be despised and
[31:20] rejected of all men
[31:24] they get more and more bitter and angry
[31:25] at the whole thing because somebody else
[31:27] was blessed and i've been asking god for
[31:29] years for this
[31:31] it's terrible we should be rejoicing
[31:34] when god blesses somebody
[31:36] we should be rejoicing when somebody
[31:38] gets the holy ghost we should be
[31:40] rejoicing when somebody's changed in
[31:42] their life we should be rejoicing some
[31:44] of you got on your schedule you're ready
[31:46] to leave somebody's down here repenting
[31:48] and getting through to god we should be
[31:49] staying and rejoicing with them
[31:51] [Applause]
[31:52] you know what did you live by your
[31:53] schedule but let me tell you the
[31:55] schedule that's most important it's the
[31:57] kingdom of god his clock his timepiece
[32:00] is the most important schedule and you
[32:02] ought to let everything in your life be
[32:05] secondary
[32:06] to god's kingdom
[32:09] we ought to rejoice when someone
[32:11] rejoices paul said it in the body of
[32:13] christ when one suffers we all suffer
[32:15] when one rejoices we all rejoice
[32:18] but no cain he is
[32:20] bitter towards towards abel and
[32:24] and so he's wroth
[32:26] and you know i would say i know we get
[32:27] angry sometimes because anger is a part
[32:29] of our emotions paul taught us that in
[32:31] ephesians who said be angry and sin not
[32:33] you're going to be angry at some things
[32:35] but this was more how do we know it was
[32:37] more this wasn't just anger in cain this
[32:40] was more because it acted out something
[32:42] in its anger
[32:44] and when your anger is ready to act out
[32:46] and get back
[32:48] and kill
[32:50] your anger's out of control
[32:53] and i'll say it i think i said last
[32:55] sunday brother brown makes a comment
[32:57] elect doesn't persecute elect
[33:01] there's something desperately wrong
[33:02] when you're calling yourself elected
[33:04] bride and you're persecuting another
[33:06] elect
[33:07] whether online on your post or whatever
[33:09] it is
[33:11] elect doesn't persecute elect
[33:15] praise the lord everybody still love me
[33:18] i'll finish this up and then i'm gonna i
[33:19] got a positive i got something positive
[33:21] at the end
[33:24] you know the word jealousy is not
[33:26] mentioned here in the bible but brother
[33:28] branham said
[33:29] this is where it started
[33:31] it was jealousy and cain
[33:34] everything begins to break down a lot of
[33:35] times you tie back to jealousy
[33:37] it started and you can't see jealousy it
[33:39] starts in someone's heart they're
[33:40] jealous of somebody else someone else is
[33:42] getting more praise someone else is
[33:44] getting it someone else is being
[33:46] accepted someone else is getting more
[33:47] attention over the pulpit
[33:49] so it's a jealousy that rises up
[33:51] somebody else has this and i don't have
[33:53] it so jealousy is one of the worst
[33:54] things and people become green with
[33:56] jealousy i can safely say that cain had
[33:58] become green with jealousy towards abel
[34:02] jealousy is something that eats at us it
[34:04] eats at us and then it makes us angry at
[34:07] someone and then when we're so angry
[34:09] because of our jealousy we act out
[34:12] something i hate this person now i'm so
[34:15] mad at this person and i'm gonna do
[34:17] something about it
[34:22] what he did about it is that he just
[34:24] basically killed him
[34:28] so it's really easy for us to say amanda
[34:30] where's murder come from don't come from
[34:32] god it comes from satan
[34:35] he murdered
[34:36] his own twin brother there his own he he
[34:39] martyred he killed him his angers got so
[34:41] out of control and his resentment and
[34:43] his jealousy he just murdered him
[34:46] but i got a quote here to bring it up to
[34:48] date a little bit because i know none of
[34:50] you people would murder other people of
[34:52] course not we're too good for that
[34:56] but this second quote says
[34:58] maybe you haven't read it for years
[35:00] maybe you've never read it before
[35:02] brother brown says and you people with
[35:04] these saw blade tempers
[35:07] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[35:09] at somebody
[35:11] can't put up and things like that be
[35:13] careful you're guilty if you speak a
[35:15] word against your brother that's not
[35:17] right
[35:19] not just
[35:21] not just go around and tear it down it
[35:23] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[35:25] man's back
[35:27] to kill him you can break his character
[35:30] and kill him and kill
[35:32] his influence
[35:35] modern-day murder
[35:38] modern day violence modern day murder is
[35:42] that you give yourself permission and
[35:44] you're angry at somebody i know how i'm
[35:46] going to do this i'm going to say some
[35:48] things and i know it's going to kill
[35:50] because i can't stand his influence i
[35:51] can't stand all all that's happened and
[35:54] so i'm just going to say some things
[35:56] here out of my anger and what you don't
[35:58] realize is that your words have power to
[36:00] them and it's going to kill somebody's
[36:02] influence a murderous spirit didn't come
[36:04] from god
[36:06] comes from the serpent
[36:09] shall we finish the rest of the quote
[36:10] speak against your pastor here say
[36:12] something bad about him you just might
[36:14] as well have shot him
[36:18] told something that wasn't right about
[36:19] him well it'll kill his influence with
[36:21] the people and things like that and
[36:23] you're guilty of it that's why i
[36:25] mentioned my dad used to teach and tell
[36:27] people that be careful what you say
[36:29] against the ministers because that
[36:31] minister may be the only one that can
[36:32] help your child someday when you can't
[36:35] help them god may use that minister and
[36:37] you've already destroyed their influence
[36:39] in your child's minds
[36:42] you've talked about things in your home
[36:43] and you put down the ministry and you've
[36:45] said things loosely and all the while
[36:47] little ears are listening where they'll
[36:49] never have confidence in that man even
[36:51] when he's preaching the gospel like this
[36:53] they don't have confidence i say us
[36:55] parents ought to grow up and be careful
[36:57] what we say against other believers in
[37:00] the body of christ can i get an amen i
[37:03] say and i'm preaching to myself we need
[37:05] to be more careful about what we say
[37:08] against other members of the body of
[37:09] christ
[37:11] because you won't go shoot them with a
[37:13] gun but you can kill them with your
[37:16] killing their influence
[37:20] all these attributes came out
[37:23] and guess what all of these
[37:25] attributes were not learned
[37:30] some of these attributes were almost
[37:31] immediate
[37:32] and they didn't adam and eve blaming one
[37:35] another they didn't go to classes
[37:38] before they started to manifest these
[37:40] attributes isn't that amazing i'm going
[37:42] to bring a point here that is this isn't
[37:44] about that where they were taught this
[37:46] is about something got in their nature
[37:49] that was wrong
[37:50] it was deep down in their nature now
[37:53] and so now everything that they started
[37:55] to manifest it wasn't taught they didn't
[37:57] take
[37:58] lessons in it they didn't adam and eve
[37:59] didn't go through a 10-week process to
[38:02] learn how to become fussing and arguing
[38:05] with another and fighting they didn't
[38:07] they didn't they didn't it was all
[38:09] within them to fight for their own way
[38:11] to stand for themselves instead of tell
[38:13] the truth to blame one another to lie to
[38:16] hide from god they weren't taught that
[38:18] it just came with this whole fall in the
[38:20] garden it was inherent in the nature
[38:23] they were lying and they didn't learn
[38:25] how to lie and the best example of that
[38:27] is a little two-year-old that uh when
[38:30] when they when they got a cookie and you
[38:32] know they did but they're you go over to
[38:34] them say did you steal that cookie and
[38:37] they're they're looking there and
[38:38] they're saying no i not me no and they
[38:41] have they have crumbs coming out of
[38:42] their mouths
[38:46] me no
[38:47] johnny did it johnny did it
[38:51] not me
[38:54] that kid did not go especially at two
[38:56] years old to a 10-week seminar and learn
[38:58] how to lie
[39:00] and yet they're such good ones at two
[39:02] years old already they're professional
[39:05] liars
[39:07] they're better than some adults they
[39:08] know how to blame someone else and they
[39:10] know how to do this and deny it deny it
[39:14] there's no evidence of it then just
[39:15] breathe bring it show me i mean i'm
[39:18] telling it's amazing and guess what they
[39:20] didn't learn it it comes in the nature
[39:23] that they're born with it's by nature
[39:27] that these characteristics come
[39:35] so whose nature is it didn't come from
[39:37] god so this means that when they fell
[39:39] from truth and listened to a lie they
[39:41] took on not just did they fall and lose
[39:45] everything they had with god they took
[39:47] on
[39:48] a nature and attributes that can only
[39:51] originate
[39:52] in one and that's satan himself
[39:58] he's the father of lies
[40:01] he's a false interpreter of the word
[40:03] he's the blamer of someone else
[40:06] he's the gossiper
[40:07] he is jealous of uh jealous wasn't
[40:11] wasn't lucifer jealous of the position
[40:14] of god and wanted to be worshiped like
[40:15] god
[40:17] he's the originator of jealousy
[40:19] and he drew a per he had influence on
[40:21] the third part of the stars and so he
[40:24] rose in jealousy to take away the
[40:25] kingdom from god even before we got to
[40:27] earth he
[40:29] is he was he's jealous of god but guess
[40:31] what satan's really jealous of he's a
[40:33] great jealousy over the believer's
[40:35] position in christ he's been always
[40:38] jealous of your creative power because
[40:40] god gave creative power to adam
[40:43] and when god gave that full power on the
[40:45] earth to adam satan was jealous of that
[40:48] creator he's never had creative power
[40:50] can you say about he never will have it
[40:52] he can't create anything he only
[40:55] perverts what god brings out he has
[40:57] always wanted access to that creative
[41:00] power and guess what god gives it to
[41:02] sons and daughters of god he gives
[41:04] creative power to you no wonder he's
[41:07] jealous of you and puts a believer in
[41:09] his position in christ by the holy ghost
[41:11] he stands as a powerhouse against the
[41:13] enemy and satan says i can never have
[41:15] that so the only thing i can do is fight
[41:18] against this believer try to tell them
[41:20] they're not a believer try to
[41:22] belittle them try to put them down try
[41:24] to find their mistakes and capitalize
[41:26] he's trying because he's jealous of your
[41:29] position in jesus christ
[41:32] you have something that he can never
[41:34] have and that's why satan hates you it's
[41:37] not your personality he hates it's not
[41:40] your mannerisms it's not only it's what
[41:42] you have in god inside of you that's
[41:45] what he's jealous of so who's the author
[41:47] of jealousy satan himself
[41:49] he's jealous of other believers and
[41:51] that's why who is it that becomes
[41:53] jealous of other believers in the body
[41:54] of christ who is it it's not you my
[41:56] brother said that's satan anointing you
[41:59] that's satan annoying you whoever it is
[42:01] on the online whatever church it is if
[42:03] there's splits and divides going on and
[42:05] it starts with jealousy and satan
[42:07] working that satan is the author of that
[42:09] that's what's working god's not working
[42:11] among you it's satan trying to divide
[42:14] you
[42:15] because you're jealous of one another's
[42:16] positions
[42:18] i can say a lot of things here i put a
[42:20] brother in place it's amazing the
[42:22] resentment that rises up against that
[42:24] brother
[42:25] i just let of the lord you know we don't
[42:27] have politics around here i just do
[42:28] things as i feel led of god i really do
[42:31] and people make it personal and put this
[42:33] brother and it my assistant
[42:35] takes some heat sometimes and some
[42:37] brothers i put in positions i say why
[42:39] are people saying that against them why
[42:41] are people doing that it's like we're
[42:43] not being led and we want to be led by
[42:44] the holy ghost here
[42:46] but it's amazing the jealousies and the
[42:48] resentment that rises up sometimes
[42:50] i tell you i just want to say a simple
[42:52] church led by the holy ghost you can say
[42:54] anybody can say what they want to say
[42:56] but i'll tell you you know let's just
[42:58] remember
[43:00] that this thing to divide
[43:02] originates in satan
[43:04] i'm not calling you satan but i'm just
[43:06] saying be careful what you're influenced
[43:07] by
[43:10] satan is jealous of believers satan's
[43:12] angry the bible says he's a roaring lion
[43:15] satan's are off with you
[43:17] he's wroth with god he's the one who's
[43:19] out to steal to kill and destroy
[43:22] none of those attributes come from god
[43:24] always remember that but then deeper
[43:27] than that now i'm just taking this on
[43:29] and if if if if this is not taught
[43:33] and this is why it'll get so good when
[43:34] we get to the the characteristics and
[43:37] relationships after redemption because
[43:39] if this all comes by nature and you
[43:41] weren't taught it
[43:43] then we realize what we're going to talk
[43:44] about down the road what comes with the
[43:46] nature of the holy spirit is not you
[43:48] trying to do it
[43:51] but if you got that nature in you then
[43:53] you already have the power to manifest
[43:55] those things in your life
[43:57] by nature not by rules and regulations
[44:00] not by do's and don'ts
[44:03] power
[44:05] because of nature so here
[44:07] then god is
[44:09] providing
[44:11] something
[44:13] let me just say it this way
[44:15] if this is deeper and it's by nature and
[44:17] they weren't taught this then god has to
[44:20] provide something so deep
[44:22] as to go into the very nature of us and
[44:26] change it when you're talking about
[44:27] inheriting something that you didn't
[44:29] even give yourself you were born with it
[44:31] that goes pretty deep
[44:33] what you inherited from your family
[44:35] traits goes so deep
[44:38] some of those things you can't change
[44:41] those inherent things that come from
[44:42] your family members now if they're of
[44:44] the devil that's one thing but some
[44:45] things
[44:46] you're just they're just going to be in
[44:47] you so if the power of of taking
[44:50] something from what we were born with
[44:52] and we have the nature before we even we
[44:55] didn't ex we didn't even accept that it
[44:57] came with the nature of it and if that
[44:59] power is so strong then when god deals
[45:01] with us and he's to deal with these
[45:03] characteristics and he's going to deal
[45:05] with our lives then god would have to
[45:07] provide something so deep as to go into
[45:10] the he can't provide a denomination he
[45:12] can't provide just education he can't
[45:14] provide just psychology because this
[45:16] goes so deep within us it's going to
[45:18] have to go to our very nature
[45:21] can i get an amen this morning
[45:23] god would have to provide something so
[45:26] deep that it goes to the very core of
[45:28] our nature and changes our nature so
[45:30] that other characteristics will come out
[45:33] that's why man in denominations try
[45:35] their best to take the trouble of man
[45:37] his characteristics his jealousy and his
[45:39] murderous all these other things and try
[45:41] to reform him through education try to
[45:44] reform it change his mind mind over
[45:46] matter can you say amen he tries his
[45:48] best to do it but it's god who provides
[45:51] us and god would have to go so deep
[45:53] within us to change our very nature how
[45:56] many would raise your hand this morning
[45:57] and say i know god has done that in my
[45:59] life my desires have been changed
[46:02] praise the lord then god has to provide
[46:05] something and when you're when it's
[46:06] inherited you don't change that by
[46:09] intellect by mind by education
[46:13] so nicodemus comes to jesus by night i
[46:16] don't know why he came by night but he
[46:18] maybe was taking it easy and hiding
[46:21] nicodemus comes to jesus by night a
[46:24] religious leader
[46:26] and he says lord
[46:30] jesus we we've watched your ministry
[46:33] we like your style boy
[46:37] we really believe now you come from god
[46:41] we like your church
[46:43] it's got good music
[46:46] i like the youth group
[46:48] i'm thinking about changing churches
[46:50] just thinking about it
[46:52] your coffee's really good
[46:56] i love your worship
[46:58] i think i want to attend your church
[47:01] i'm thinking about it i'm coming to you
[47:02] by night because i'm still in the
[47:04] process of thinking about it i like your
[47:06] style boy
[47:08] and jesus response was nicodemus
[47:13] you have to be
[47:14] born again
[47:19] wow that's rough i'm not being that
[47:21] rough this morning am i he just told him
[47:23] straight
[47:26] let's not talk about what you think and
[47:28] what your counsel has said and you've
[47:30] concluded that
[47:32] you must be of god and
[47:33] let's talk about you and before you come
[47:36] something has to happen
[47:39] because if god doesn't
[47:40] rebirth you by a new birth and change
[47:43] your nature you could accept this
[47:46] up here
[47:47] and you're going to have still all the
[47:49] characteristics of the serpent nature
[47:51] coming out of your life
[47:52] you're going to eventually deny this
[47:54] word because satan denies the word
[47:55] you're going to eventually get jealous
[47:57] over things because satan gets jealous
[47:59] you're a visit because all those
[48:00] characteristics are all there in your
[48:01] nature and he just answers them by
[48:03] saying you must be born again can you
[48:05] imagine nicodemus and what he says what
[48:07] in the world have you just said and he
[48:08] actually said how can i do that do i
[48:11] jump back inside my mother's womb and
[48:14] then i jump back out again that's what
[48:16] he said he don't have a clue what he's
[48:18] saying but he would know later and the
[48:20] church would know later he's saying the
[48:22] right thing you cannot get this through
[48:24] education you cannot get this through
[48:26] just changing your mind you have to
[48:28] start somewhere god has to go to the
[48:30] core of your nature and change it you
[48:32] have to be born again
[48:34] young people you must be born again
[48:37] it's not just like in the music and
[48:38] liking the youth group you must be born
[48:40] again
[48:41] you say god come and change my nature
[48:44] god give me a conversion deep on the
[48:47] inside
[48:49] why haven't some of you done it yet i
[48:51] don't know all the reasons but i
[48:52] encourage you in the lord don't let the
[48:54] devil whisper in your ear like it did to
[48:56] the prophet he said i would have given
[48:57] my heart to the lord at 12 years old but
[49:00] there was a spirit hung over me that
[49:02] kept saying to me just wait a little
[49:03] longer
[49:04] guess who was whispering to brother
[49:06] branham at 12 years old the same serpent
[49:09] that was whispering in eve's ear
[49:13] young person recognized who's whispering
[49:15] in your keeping you back from a new
[49:16] birth
[49:18] it's the devil lying to you and you
[49:19] rather believe his lies than to say the
[49:22] truth i need god
[49:24] i need a birth
[49:26] i'm going to cry out to the lord
[49:28] not my mom not my dad it's not about
[49:30] anymore i need
[49:31] what god provided through calvary i need
[49:34] a change
[49:35] can i get an amen this one i need to be
[49:37] changed i need god to go very deep as
[49:40] deep as he can go into my life that's
[49:43] the trouble when people struggle with
[49:44] the message all these years they
[49:46] struggle with it they struggle with the
[49:47] dress code and they struggle with this
[49:49] you you need to look at where your
[49:51] nature is because if your nature still
[49:53] desires the things of the lord and
[49:54] you're trying to smear on the message on
[49:56] the outside you're going to be the most
[49:58] miserable person on the face of the
[49:59] earth
[50:00] why not look at your life and say do i
[50:03] have a nature change i'm a good person i
[50:06] give my tithes i do it praise the lord
[50:08] god bless you god will bless you for
[50:10] that but only you can answer the
[50:12] question has my nature been changed
[50:17] has my nature been changed only you can
[50:19] answer that question and only you can
[50:20] call out to god for it
[50:23] how many message people growing up in
[50:24] the message are recognizing many times
[50:27] i've done the right things
[50:29] i've done all that i was supposed to do
[50:31] and i'm starting to see
[50:33] i i don't have
[50:36] the change of desires that god provided
[50:38] at calvary
[50:41] i can preach it up here
[50:43] and you might get mad at me but it's the
[50:45] day when you start to examine your life
[50:48] and if you've got desires you've got
[50:49] that desire to serve the lord
[50:51] same end of the word of god and you love
[50:53] it you love truth you love truth if you
[50:55] can say you love truth
[50:58] from the inside of the inside
[51:00] then let god take over the outside and
[51:02] do what he needs to do
[51:04] but you need to be real honest if you
[51:06] can i'm saying i don't have this by
[51:10] nature within me
[51:13] can you still come to church yes please
[51:15] we love you come to church this is where
[51:17] you need to be
[51:20] until god just begins to work and change
[51:23] and do these things yes
[51:25] we got all kinds here all kinds of
[51:26] different stages of their life
[51:29] i would never isolate and say well it's
[51:31] only people that are filled with the
[51:32] holy ghost can come here
[51:34] that's not a that's not a church
[51:37] can you say man
[51:38] it's only people that come to full
[51:40] adoption that can come to this year no
[51:41] no no we want
[51:43] god to come and meet you where you're at
[51:47] with the holy ghost without the holy
[51:48] ghost without salvation without we want
[51:51] god to be personal to you and find you
[51:54] where you're at and you get a hunger i
[51:56] need more of god
[51:59] how many would agree and say we need an
[52:00] atmosphere here we just went on
[52:02] commercials on the local television they
[52:03] were just on yesterday we're running i'm
[52:05] inviting as much as funds have i had i'm
[52:08] inviting people out to church i'm
[52:10] inviting everyone just to come and be in
[52:12] the presence of the lord they went on a
[52:14] couple days ago and i walked into the
[52:16] bank and said hey hey i've seen you
[52:18] preaching this morning
[52:21] something just i've had a rough week
[52:22] this week but i'll tell you that was a
[52:24] blessing to me praise be to god
[52:28] somebody heard me preaching a few words
[52:30] brother kyle sister laura put it
[52:32] together and i'm preaching he takes out
[52:34] a few lines there some key lines a
[52:35] little bit of singing on there 30 second
[52:37] commercial and i'm praying i prayed this
[52:39] morning let that 30 seconds catch a seat
[52:42] of god put a hunger in their heart to
[52:44] come and visit
[52:47] it's not about us foreign no more here
[52:49] friends and it might make you feel
[52:51] uncomfortable who comes through the
[52:52] doors but i'm praying they'll come in
[52:54] these doors whatever condition they're
[52:56] in you can come in whatever condition
[52:58] you're in god loves you and he wants to
[53:01] take you further in your walk with god
[53:04] and if i have that love which i believe
[53:06] i do i love you the same and i want you
[53:09] to overcome your hurdles i ask people
[53:12] sometimes after years of struggling with
[53:14] this message i said can i help what's
[53:16] your hurdles what is there anything i
[53:18] can help answer because sometimes the
[53:20] devil just has one lie there that's
[53:22] keeping them to stepping onto further
[53:24] victory can i help you in any way to
[53:26] tear down the walls that you trust the
[53:29] lord with your life
[53:32] and you find
[53:34] a further victorious holy ghost filled
[53:37] walk
[53:38] that's what we desire for your life can
[53:41] anybody hear my heart here this morning
[53:43] i know that this is the vision can you
[53:46] say amen and it's not about us for no
[53:48] more it's not about the politics out in
[53:50] the churches i am becoming less and less
[53:53] interested in being involved in any of
[53:55] that i want to focus on the holy spirit
[53:57] and what he wants to speak to us here
[53:59] and i'm crying i'm praying god bring
[54:02] more souls into the kingdom of god bring
[54:04] the hunger bring the last elected seed
[54:06] to us
[54:08] let the music draw their attention that
[54:11] that things will attract and brother rep
[54:12] said healings and and singings are the
[54:15] bait on the hook to draw them in that
[54:17] the music cuts their attention but let
[54:19] them come and then recognize the state
[54:21] that they're in and that calvary the
[54:23] power of calvary
[54:27] is available to them
[54:30] hallelujah let's give the lord a
[54:31] handcuff of grace
[54:33] that's what i desire that's my vision
[54:35] for the lord
[54:37] he gave me that vision
[54:40] i'm not concerned about the politics and
[54:41] everything else that goes on i just i
[54:44] just want to focus on what the kingdom
[54:46] of god and what we should be focused on
[54:50] hallelujah so jesus said you must be
[54:52] born again it has to be deeper
[54:54] has to be deeper what time is it
[54:57] has to be deeper
[54:58] it's the nature
[55:00] it's
[55:02] it's taken you'd have to change the
[55:04] nature
[55:05] of a pig to be a different animal
[55:08] or he's going to be a pig
[55:10] even if you wash him up and put him on
[55:12] the front row and give him a position or
[55:13] make him a deacon or
[55:15] no
[55:16] you must be born again
[55:19] well i got a gift i can sing oh let's
[55:21] put them up there let's do it
[55:22] no no no no
[55:25] are they coming for the word
[55:28] have they been changed by the word
[55:32] well they got a gift the gift is not
[55:33] more important than a new birth
[55:36] the gift is never more i don't care how
[55:38] well they play how good they sing i
[55:40] don't care if they sing in the biggest
[55:42] venues in the world listen have you been
[55:44] born again
[55:47] we don't lift up the gifts even the
[55:48] gifts of preaching we're not lifting up
[55:50] the gifts we're lifting up jesus christ
[55:52] and the changing power transforming
[55:54] power of the holy ghost
[55:56] that's what the nomination has become is
[55:58] it's all the surrounding of a bunch of
[55:59] gifts and who has the best gifts and
[56:01] it's glorifying gifts and a lot of
[56:03] people are not even living the life
[56:04] sometimes even our own ranks the gifts
[56:06] are great but they're not living the
[56:08] life there's no holy ghost there
[56:10] but they they're so interesting if
[56:13] we can just let the gift work and they
[56:14] can sing really good and the anointing
[56:16] can come then we're okay with it i'm not
[56:18] okay with that
[56:20] you must be born again
[56:22] your nature has to be changed
[56:25] because if your gift is taken away from
[56:26] you you're going to continue and go on
[56:28] with god serving him with all your heart
[56:31] what if you lose your voice and you
[56:33] don't have a gift anymore
[56:35] what if something happens to your body
[56:37] you're not able to do your gift out
[56:38] there anymore you're not able to work
[56:39] anymore you do you lose everything in
[56:42] christ no you've got to have a nature
[56:43] chains
[56:46] does anybody listen to me this morning
[56:48] you got to have a change of a nature you
[56:50] must be born again
[56:52] amen
[57:01] if
[57:03] if the
[57:04] fall happened in the garden
[57:07] by believing a lie
[57:11] then it's pretty simple that the way
[57:13] back
[57:15] starts
[57:16] with believing the truth
[57:20] and i don't mean intellectually just
[57:22] saying now i believe this i'm talking
[57:23] about what he said in my text
[57:26] they need to receive the love the nature
[57:29] the love of the truth
[57:31] and because they wouldn't receive the
[57:33] love of the truth by the holy ghost then
[57:35] there come under a delusion to believe
[57:36] any lies
[57:38] but if the way out of eden was believing
[57:40] a lie then the way back starts with
[57:43] believing the truth the truth receiving
[57:46] the truth the love of the truth when we
[57:48] get a true experience of the holy ghost
[57:50] in our soul we have received a love for
[57:52] truth what's the evidence of the holy
[57:54] ghost
[57:56] when we've received the holy ghost
[57:58] we receive a love
[58:01] for truth
[58:04] you love truth
[58:07] and sometimes it doesn't matter the
[58:08] vessel that it comes through
[58:10] that's besides the point
[58:12] it doesn't matter what avenue it doesn't
[58:14] matter if you find that it's truth you
[58:17] love it you say amen to it the evidence
[58:20] of the holy ghost is saying amen to
[58:22] every word of god of this age
[58:24] by nature it just it just it just says
[58:27] amen it may not say it here but it says
[58:29] amen
[58:31] amen
[58:33] evidence of the holy ghost it's not
[58:34] shouting it's not dancing that's the joy
[58:36] of the holy ghost you get stimulation of
[58:38] revelation you're going to shout and
[58:39] dance sometimes or you may just cry not
[58:41] everybody will shout and dance
[58:43] is it okay to say that
[58:45] not everybody may shout and dance but
[58:47] you're going to be there's going to be a
[58:49] reaction emotionally when you're
[58:51] stimulated by the revelation
[58:53] but the evidence of having the holy
[58:56] ghost is not an emotion
[59:00] it is your nature has been changed
[59:03] that you begin to love
[59:05] the truth
[59:06] even in family relationships you'll
[59:09] stand back and say now you've just said
[59:11] something to me
[59:12] against a brother you've just said
[59:14] something to me and we heard something
[59:16] and a believer will stand back because
[59:18] he's a lover of the truth he won't jump
[59:20] right in and say well tell me more
[59:22] i want to hear more
[59:25] i think we should stand back and say i'm
[59:27] going to wait and pray about this and
[59:29] make sure
[59:30] that we have the truth
[59:35] it's a love of truth whether it's
[59:37] doctrinal truth whether it's in the
[59:38] bible whether it is and even if it's the
[59:40] truth about your condition
[59:45] you're hiding something in your life
[59:48] and the truth comes and exposes you if
[59:51] you're hiding it and you're doing it
[59:53] then that's the truth
[59:56] and because you're a lover of truth
[59:58] you'll find an alter and repent god i've
[1:00:00] been exposed
[1:00:02] it's the truth i'm backslidden i'm away
[1:00:05] from you
[1:00:07] you've got to admit it's true to get
[1:00:08] anywhere
[1:00:10] but then you grab on to the other truth
[1:00:12] that says he that re he that asks
[1:00:15] forgiveness god's faithful and just to
[1:00:17] forgive him of his sins then you grab
[1:00:19] ahold of that truth have i repented
[1:00:21] god's forgiven me i'm going to stand and
[1:00:23] go on
[1:00:24] i'm going to go forward that's the truth
[1:00:26] and god says he'll fill me god says
[1:00:28] you'll save me god says to me take me to
[1:00:30] adoption these are promises these are
[1:00:32] truths in god you can now that's a holy
[1:00:34] truth because you're a lover of truth
[1:00:35] now
[1:00:36] someone can tell a lie on you there's a
[1:00:38] power
[1:00:39] i'm good i'm doing good here it's 12 40.
[1:00:41] um i got the time is fine all right
[1:00:47] i'm amazed how quickly i'm moving
[1:00:48] through this
[1:00:51] i know you're not amazed at but i'm
[1:00:52] amazed at it it's incredible
[1:00:56] a lie has power in it
[1:01:00] to bind you
[1:01:01] and put a cloud over you
[1:01:04] and a lying it's not just satan tells
[1:01:07] lies on you but there's a power satan's
[1:01:10] power that goes with a lie that's been
[1:01:12] told on you
[1:01:13] that binds you and sometimes for years
[1:01:16] people are bound i've i've talked to
[1:01:18] sisters and brothers that
[1:01:20] something was said from their daddy or
[1:01:22] their mommy when they were a little kid
[1:01:25] and that thing hangs right with them
[1:01:28] we got some sitting here i would never
[1:01:29] mention their names but they've been
[1:01:31] destroyed
[1:01:32] in their confidence because daddy
[1:01:35] put a cloud over their lives
[1:01:37] so you'll never be anything you're
[1:01:39] you're not nothing you're just this and
[1:01:41] play favorites with the kids and all
[1:01:42] that happens in a lot of families
[1:01:45] it's not just that
[1:01:46] it's lies that satan has told on you
[1:01:49] through someone else but the cloud that
[1:01:51] you live under
[1:01:52] something always starts somewhere
[1:01:55] and you're bound by that now there was a
[1:01:57] woman in the um
[1:01:59] the only film that we have i think of of
[1:02:01] brother branham is the deep call to the
[1:02:02] deep and if you watch it in there
[1:02:05] you'll see a woman coming up all nervous
[1:02:07] and she's got health problems and she's
[1:02:09] she's just shaking a bit i think if i
[1:02:11] remember that it's been a while since
[1:02:12] i've seen it but she comes up and the
[1:02:14] the problem with her after it was
[1:02:16] revealed by the holy spirit was not just
[1:02:17] their physical problems or nervousness
[1:02:19] it came from somewhere and what it came
[1:02:21] from is he says he says i know what it
[1:02:23] was and brother brandon gets stern with
[1:02:24] his i know what's happened god showed me
[1:02:27] somebody's total lie on you sister
[1:02:30] somebody told a lie on you
[1:02:33] so her nervousness her physical
[1:02:35] condition all these things happening to
[1:02:37] her began with the power of a lie that
[1:02:41] she was believing about herself
[1:02:45] and she'd been under it for years and
[1:02:47] now under the presence of god there's a
[1:02:50] victory coming because
[1:02:52] god's going to bring the truth to this
[1:02:54] woman
[1:02:56] and i love it in the film i do remember
[1:02:58] this party it says satan say someone's
[1:03:01] to lie someone said you're a witch and
[1:03:03] she was a woman of god i can't remember
[1:03:04] what she did for the lord but they said
[1:03:06] they've called somebody's called you a
[1:03:08] witch
[1:03:10] isn't that true and she starts to break
[1:03:11] down it's exactly the truth someone
[1:03:13] years ago had called her a witch
[1:03:15] now she comes she's broken down and she
[1:03:17] realizes that that's where this lies
[1:03:19] started that's where i'm bound that's
[1:03:21] why i'm coming down that's why i'm being
[1:03:22] defeated and once she realizes it then
[1:03:24] he looks and he points that finger
[1:03:26] sister you go in grace and believe in
[1:03:29] god you he looks her in the eye you are
[1:03:31] not a witch
[1:03:33] i love that part
[1:03:35] you are not a witch that's a license go
[1:03:38] in victory go serving the lord you are
[1:03:40] not a witch
[1:03:41] she was believing it but it was a lie
[1:03:48] but if lies have power over us
[1:03:52] remember the other sister all nervous
[1:03:54] all these other things and
[1:03:56] trying to get a hold she'd been to other
[1:03:58] preachers and her nervousness said well
[1:04:00] you got doubles you've got 10 doubles
[1:04:02] you got 12 devils i'm going quickly
[1:04:03] through the story and all these
[1:04:04] preachers have said you got different
[1:04:05] devils and she come to blood right and
[1:04:07] says i really don't know how many devils
[1:04:08] i have but i got some devils because
[1:04:10] preachers told me i have devils and
[1:04:12] after he sat in the room with her he
[1:04:13] realized she was going through menopause
[1:04:16] and at the end of it he says
[1:04:18] you don't have any devils at all
[1:04:22] and she said but
[1:04:24] but
[1:04:25] what about the
[1:04:26] the thing
[1:04:28] she's so scared she's calling it the
[1:04:30] thing
[1:04:31] it's like there is no thing
[1:04:34] you're going through a time of life
[1:04:36] which any sisters that go through that
[1:04:38] you can feel pretty upset
[1:04:41] and pretty
[1:04:44] squirrely
[1:04:45] i can't find the right word i'm not
[1:04:47] going to try to say it because i've
[1:04:48] never been through it i only have been
[1:04:50] around
[1:04:51] sisters who have
[1:04:56] and i don't want to laugh at it even
[1:04:58] okay it's not funny it's a real thing
[1:05:01] but you can feel a lot of things you can
[1:05:03] feel defeated christian you can feel
[1:05:05] everybody's against you you can feel
[1:05:06] people are gossiping about you when
[1:05:08] there's nobody gospel you can just have
[1:05:10] a devil's talking to you like crazy and
[1:05:12] and women hit it a lot sooner these days
[1:05:14] brother brown said than you imagine
[1:05:17] yep
[1:05:19] i'd advise you to just settle down you
[1:05:21] saw don't try to do a lot of things
[1:05:23] enjoy your life enjoy your grandkids and
[1:05:25] maybe not say a whole lot
[1:05:29] why am i giving advice for menopause
[1:05:32] why am i doing that
[1:05:35] but if you hit it i mean you better pray
[1:05:38] hopefully you have an understanding
[1:05:39] husband but brother brown was very
[1:05:41] supportive
[1:05:43] of the women who go through it because
[1:05:44] it's real but you know what he told this
[1:05:46] woman he said she said what about the
[1:05:48] the thing he said
[1:05:51] you don't have any devil's sister
[1:05:53] don't you know you're going through the
[1:05:54] time of life
[1:05:58] every woman goes through it
[1:05:59] she said well what do i need to do
[1:06:01] he said go
[1:06:02] home clean your house because he said
[1:06:05] her house he must have seen that in the
[1:06:07] vision or something
[1:06:09] her house was a mess
[1:06:12] go home clean up your house serve your
[1:06:13] husband and make your husband a big
[1:06:15] apple pie
[1:06:17] just
[1:06:18] staggering counsel
[1:06:26] you know she's if she's amongst the
[1:06:27] pentecostals she's looking for you fast
[1:06:30] for three weeks sister you get to that
[1:06:32] tent meeting you get to that camp
[1:06:37] just go home and get back into your life
[1:06:40] get back into the flow of things serve

[1:06:49] sweetie
[1:06:52] i just realized
[1:06:54] that's good counsel
[1:06:58] i like that quote
[1:07:02] see i know my wife what she's thinking
[1:07:04] right now she's saying you don't need
[1:07:06] any apple pie
[1:07:07] that's like the last thing you need
[1:07:09] sweetie
[1:07:11] but i'm holding on to that quote i'm
[1:07:13] going to be quoting that to you this
[1:07:14] week
[1:07:15] pull it up on the phone and text it to
[1:07:16] you
[1:07:20] but that's not the biggest part he said
[1:07:22] that's astounding for him to give that
[1:07:24] advice astounding
[1:07:26] scott in simplicity and you know friends
[1:07:28] let me say something this was churning
[1:07:30] on me this morning i said to my wife and
[1:07:31] last night i said paul said i fear lest
[1:07:34] by any means you would be beguiled like
[1:07:37] eve i've talked about eve this morning
[1:07:39] paul feared that their that their minds
[1:07:42] would be taken from the simplicity in
[1:07:45] jesus christ
[1:07:47] and i feel there's a lot of confusion
[1:07:50] even in our ranks the young people get
[1:07:52] confused i'm saying this i don't even
[1:07:54] know if i'll let this out but i'm saying
[1:07:55] there's a lot of confusing things that
[1:07:57] happen sometimes even in our ranks but
[1:08:00] let's not forget that satan's work to
[1:08:02] make divide to make kids confused to
[1:08:05] make young people confused god is not
[1:08:07] the author of confusion
[1:08:10] and if we can have one resolve amen amen
[1:08:14] if we could have one resolve in our
[1:08:15] heart that we latch a hold of the
[1:08:18] simplicity that is in jesus christ
[1:08:22] you say well the message the message to
[1:08:24] me the message is the simplicity in
[1:08:26] christ
[1:08:27] it's people who have made it complicated
[1:08:30] god sent back his simplicity after 2 000
[1:08:33] years of denominations confusing people
[1:08:35] misdirecting people god sends a message
[1:08:38] to bring back the simplicity of christ
[1:08:40] the simplicity of calvary the power of
[1:08:42] calvary pouring the holy ghost back into
[1:08:44] the church that we just serve god in
[1:08:46] truth every day
[1:08:48] say well what if i'm not doing this
[1:08:50] right what if i'm doing that right stay
[1:08:51] in truth stay following truth and the
[1:08:54] power of god will change your life what
[1:08:56] if i come from his background and i
[1:08:57] don't feel worthy stay in truth he'll
[1:09:00] tell you you're worthy by the cross of
[1:09:01] jesus christ
[1:09:03] i'm only interested in one thing and
[1:09:04] that's what god said about me not what
[1:09:06] the devil said about me not what you say
[1:09:08] about me what did god say about me
[1:09:10] because that's the truth
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:18] i fear that god that satan would pervert
[1:09:22] and subtly change your minds and mess
[1:09:24] with your minds
[1:09:25] and he said i'm the simplicity
[1:09:28] he said that you would be taken from the
[1:09:31] simplicity i'm i'm paraphrasing the
[1:09:33] scripture
[1:09:34] the simplicity in gene how many want the
[1:09:36] simplicity in jesus christ
[1:09:38] such
[1:09:39] confusion sometimes
[1:09:43] but i just want to serve the lord i mean
[1:09:45] i tell you i just
[1:09:46] lately i don't want to be involved in
[1:09:48] all the
[1:09:49] the drama
[1:09:54] i just think satan
[1:09:56] is because he's the you know he's
[1:09:58] probably the
[1:09:59] originator of soap operas
[1:10:04] that didn't come from god
[1:10:07] so if he come up with soap operas the
[1:10:09] days of our lives and
[1:10:11] as the stomach turns or whatever it's
[1:10:13] called
[1:10:19] if satan come up that doesn't come from
[1:10:20] god comes from hollywood which goes back
[1:10:22] to satan soap operas then if he's the
[1:10:25] author of it he tries to bring soap
[1:10:26] operas into church
[1:10:29] drama
[1:10:30] yes
[1:10:32] i am so tired of it
[1:10:35] i just want to serve the lord
[1:10:37] i want to love truth
[1:10:39] and i'll wait till the truth comes out
[1:10:42] because god always bring the truth out
[1:10:46] i dealt with two or three or four
[1:10:48] situations recently
[1:10:50] still dealing with some of them
[1:10:51] very private situations
[1:10:55] and they're so tedious that i just said
[1:10:57] lord i don't really know how to take a
[1:10:59] next step on this
[1:11:01] but these these are lies that has been
[1:11:04] told
[1:11:05] and i could have jumped on it really
[1:11:07] quick but i just said we're going to
[1:11:08] wait
[1:11:09] because of this principle i'm teaching
[1:11:11] you
[1:11:13] truth truth
[1:11:15] will always come out
[1:11:18] and if we jump in and fight
[1:11:20] too quickly
[1:11:22] to defend ourselves or defend anybody
[1:11:24] else we can kind of ruin it because
[1:11:26] you don't need to vindicate yourself
[1:11:30] because truth has a way of vindicating
[1:11:32] itself over time and it comes out
[1:11:35] and i'm so excited because there's one
[1:11:36] situation to me the truth the truth is
[1:11:40] going to be told
[1:11:42] and i'm rejoicing in that
[1:11:46] if you jump onto things too quickly and
[1:11:47] you fight back
[1:11:50] let the lord fight your battles
[1:11:52] let the lord be the defender
[1:11:55] let the lord defend you can you say amen
[1:11:57] vengeance is mine
[1:11:59] saith the lord don't take it into your
[1:12:01] own hands
[1:12:03] but i want us i just want to be a lover
[1:12:05] of truth there's a scripture that i want
[1:12:07] to close on here
[1:12:08] that speaks my heart above all things
[1:12:10] today psalms 119 verse 29
[1:12:13] psalms 119 verse 29
[1:12:16] how many believe we should be lovers of
[1:12:17] truth
[1:12:18] and we should have the patience to
[1:12:19] protrude excuse me patience to pursue
[1:12:22] truth
[1:12:23] in our whole life whatever it is
[1:12:25] pursuing truth in god's word pursuing
[1:12:27] truth with other people
[1:12:29] wait truth is our channel and escape out
[1:12:31] of horrible situations
[1:12:34] we should be lovers of truth but look at
[1:12:35] this scripture psalms 1 19 29 remove
[1:12:39] from me
[1:12:40] remove from me
[1:12:43] the way of lying
[1:12:50] remove from me how many would share my
[1:12:52] desire this morning
[1:12:56] i'm only interested in one thing that's
[1:12:58] the truth remove from me the way of
[1:13:00] lying because we're living in the age of
[1:13:02] lying and grant me by law
[1:13:05] graciously and then the next one says
[1:13:08] next scripture
[1:13:10] i
[1:13:11] have chosen
[1:13:13] the way
[1:13:14] of truth
[1:13:18] judgments
[1:13:19] have i laid before me
[1:13:22] i
[1:13:23] have chosen
[1:13:24] the way
[1:13:26] of truth
[1:13:28] i'm going to hear things
[1:13:30] people will say things
[1:13:33] people will peg things on me
[1:13:35] people will peg things on you people
[1:13:37] will put me in a certain category
[1:13:43] truth will be hard sometimes truth will
[1:13:45] convict sometimes
[1:13:47] truth will embarrass sometimes
[1:13:51] but even if it embarrasses it's always
[1:13:53] the best way
[1:13:55] i didn't finish my story didn't i
[1:13:57] you know what the last powerful thing
[1:13:58] brother brahman said to that woman
[1:14:00] good thing i remembered this
[1:14:03] you know what he said to her go make him
[1:14:06] a pie
[1:14:07] he quotes the scripture that jesus said
[1:14:09] ye shall know the truth
[1:14:12] and the truth will set you free because
[1:14:15] in that brother brahms says when i told
[1:14:17] her the truth
[1:14:18] he said she began to settle down he said
[1:14:20] she hadn't ate in days
[1:14:22] and he said to her she began to settle
[1:14:24] down as soon as he exposed the enemies
[1:14:26] that you don't have demons he said
[1:14:29] i noticed are you a little hungry said
[1:14:31] she said yeah i'm hungry now. and she
[1:14:33] starts to smell the food that his wife
[1:14:35] said we'll go in and have something to
[1:14:36] eat start to settle down on our nerves
[1:14:39] and his last thing you see you shall
[1:14:41] know the truth brothers and sisters you
[1:14:42] shall know the truth and the truth will
[1:14:45] make you free
[1:14:49] i'm wrapping this up by saying
[1:14:50] relationships
[1:14:53] only really work
[1:14:55] when there's a pursuit of truth
[1:14:58] and willingness to be patient for truth
[1:15:00] to come out
[1:15:03] truth will be vindicated every time
[1:15:05] truth will always speak for itself truth
[1:15:08] will always be truth
[1:15:11] it'll never change and it will show
[1:15:14] itself
[1:15:15] as
[1:15:16] truth
[1:15:19] truth is marching on can you say amen
[1:15:22] truth is marching on i told you a few
[1:15:24] months ago i'm going to bring up again
[1:15:26] you can stand with me
[1:15:30] there was somebody in the in the news or
[1:15:32] something i seen on my phone in the news
[1:15:34] and it was this man
[1:15:36] black man
[1:15:38] who
[1:15:40] was
[1:15:42] in prison for
[1:15:44] i it had to be at least 30 years
[1:15:47] and somebody when i told you sorry you
[1:15:49] remember it i think he was some arkansas
[1:15:50] or somewhere there and he was in prison
[1:15:52] for 30 years and all that time he knew
[1:15:55] that he was not guilty of the crime that
[1:15:57] he committed that he they said he
[1:15:59] committed and the court went through and
[1:16:00] he was guilty and all of that see
[1:16:03] sometimes you can have a court
[1:16:06] and the court doesn't come up with the
[1:16:08] right
[1:16:09] resolution
[1:16:12] people can have a court against you
[1:16:15] and sometimes they don't come out with
[1:16:17] the truth
[1:16:19] but god
[1:16:20] god knows the truth
[1:16:23] and it was so neat to watch this guy
[1:16:25] because some lawyer began to look at the
[1:16:28] case after 30 40 years and she looked at
[1:16:31] it she did some research she began to
[1:16:32] uncover some things and found out that
[1:16:35] guy was innocent he never did any of it
[1:16:39] can you imagine living for 30 40 years
[1:16:43] knowing in your heart what the truth was
[1:16:45] and not being able to because you put it
[1:16:47] been put under a lie from somebody that
[1:16:49] long and bound by a lie
[1:16:51] and i just loved watching the video of
[1:16:54] how he was acting when he began to find
[1:16:56] out i'm going i seen the video when he's
[1:16:58] going to the court case and it looked
[1:17:00] pretty good he was going to get he was
[1:17:01] going to get free and sure enough he had
[1:17:03] it and i seen the video coming coming
[1:17:05] out of that
[1:17:06] he
[1:17:07] he i don't know if he's a christian but
[1:17:09] he was rejoicing like a christian
[1:17:12] why because this truth sets free
[1:17:16] what do you want to do he said well i
[1:17:18] want to i've never seen the ocean i want
[1:17:19] to go see the ocean i want to sit by the
[1:17:21] ocean begins to list all the stuff he
[1:17:23] had never done all those years i'll tell
[1:17:25] you when the lord sets you free from
[1:17:26] bondage
[1:17:28] you start to feel like you have a new
[1:17:29] life
[1:17:30] when you get rid of all the lies of the
[1:17:32] enemy and you quit listening to all this
[1:17:34] stuff that the devil's telling you you
[1:17:36] can be a free person in the lord
[1:17:39] jesus sets free can you say amen
[1:17:42] jesus sets free i'm so glad
