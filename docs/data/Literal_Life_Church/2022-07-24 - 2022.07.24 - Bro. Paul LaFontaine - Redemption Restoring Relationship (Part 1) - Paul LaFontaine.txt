========================================

chapter 3 we have read in the series on relationships we've read up into verse 13 when they begin to give their excuses and their different things of what took place in the fall with the serpent now let's pick up the curses here in verse 14. genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel i want to read that part again because it's a very interesting one scripture in between all the curses of god in between the judgment of god because whenever there's sin there has to be judgment so as he's handing out the judgment in the middle of all this is a prophecy of redemption and it says i will put any enmity between the thee and the woman between thy seed and her sin it shall bruise there's a prophecy it shall bruise thy head and speak into the serpent and thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and in thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he said because thou art hearken unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i've commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it and cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return and let's just stop there heavenly father we ask you to bless and anoint your word today it is has a blessing with it even when it's red if we'll receive it lord we sense your awesome presence here with us this morning and lord if you could take up this word that you've already spoken and use this weak vessel of me lord as a channel that you can bring revelation and understanding and encouragement and lord maybe some rebuke i don't know but father if you could bring it through the right channel of divine love then we'll know that you love us lord and that we would receive it in our hearts we pray lord that you will break down every hindrance and hurdle in our lives that keep us back from our full victory for as the song says you have already given us the victory we thank you for that lord and we commit ourselves to you now and all the events coming up and all these things and i just might say to you my father that we don't do this uh commercial and these things for any other reason except for to pray over it and say lord if there be any soul that's hungry for more truth then i pray that you'll grab their attention lord and put them in touch with with one of us or the assembly or someone that would could lead them closer to christ whether they be in church all their life or whether they be in the the worst hellhole of toledo get their attention lord and draw them to yourself i'm calling for more souls to come lord and i pray that you'll grant it in jesus precious name amen god bless you may be seated i know you're in agreement with me on that i'm blessed with such a congregation that is so outraged minded and for most of you it's not about us foreign no more but it's about giving what we have uh he that has a lot is as jesus said there to to whom much is given much is required and how many would raise your hand and says much has been given to you to whom much is given much is required amen god bless you all brother paul it's good to have you back from vacation there and jared and betsy as well it's good to have you mr elisha amen in the last few services we showed the fall in the garden and the oneness that was broke with god and then the oneness that was broke with one another and we know that all the relationships were destroyed from their relationship with god and all the way down to the home and so we have elaborate on that but in this service we want to take a bit of a turn we want to take a transition and we want to move from talking about the the results of the fall and what took place and begin to look at what god would do and how he would do it to reverse all of this to change all of this and to to redeem his sons out of this mess that we uh got ourselves in or adam and eve got us in so how would god reverse it it's very important that we know that it's very important that we know how god's redemption takes place it's important that we know it's the power of it how powerful it is because it had to be pretty powerful to deliver us from the state that we're in but it's very important we know how god chose and the reason is is because man can always come up with ideas to try to redeem himself out of this state that he's in and because of that we want to make crystal clear god's way of redemption god's chosen way of redemption because that's the only way that we can get back to god god's way of redemption is the only way back men can try different ways they can give they can give themselves to public service they can live their whole life in public service but if they have the guilt and of sin on their soul then god has a way to take care of that and release it and forgive them they can't take care of that on their own there are certain problems that we have that we cannot take care of on our own we are helpless and if only god can do it does everybody know that i know that's a simple statement but we have to know that first there are certain problems that we have and one big problem that we have that only god alone could take care of it there is no psychology there is no schooling there is no self-help there's nothing there's one main problem in our life and only god could take care of that problem you are helpless and you're down in the miry clay with that problem and no one can pick you up none of us can pick you up the way only god could grab your hand and get you out of this state that you're in and when the fall took place then god began to begin to lay out his plan of redemption and as you know god allowed in the greater mystery of it all god allowed this to happen god didn't create this but god allowed this fall to take place in order for his bigger plan of redemption to unfold and that his attributes would be displayed because some of god cannot be expressed in perfection when we think of god we think of perfection but some of the attributes of god cannot be expressed and come out unless there's an imperfection unless there's a fall unless there's a mistake unless there's someone who's fallen and can't get up can you say matt there are some attributes of of god and particularly the the entire work of redemption could not be expressed until man had fallen so there's a certain part of this that he allowed to take place so that more of his attributes could be expressed can you say amen so so now some of god could not be expressed so now we see then that man was in a place who uh that he could never pull himself out of he could not help himself it's it's like the song says when nothing else could help love lifted me i love that lyric when nothing else could help you you get in states there's nothing else that can help you except god accept his love and it's very important we know that in this proud generation because we have so many things to fix things we have so many we have access to so much that can fix things and we try to fix everything but we need to be humble and realize there's certain things that you cannot fix there's certain things in life and actually the more things you turn over to god he'll fix it the right way but we have to humbly admit there's certain things i can't do it lord i don't want to offer any help to it i don't want after any assistance i can't do it if it's going to get done i yield to do you because there are certain problems that only god can take care of that's humility can you say amen i was sinking deep in sin so far from the shore all these lyrics i was sinking and it was this this this depth of sin from the garden it was so lodged in the spirit of man in other words this fall was just not a mistake this was not just a mistake this was huge to where this sin lodged in man's spirit can you say man so that he didn't just have problems because we read the problems of relationship that come from the fall he had problems and man had problems ever since the fall there's always been problems he's saying to adam there under adam's curse he'd curse the ground he couldn't curse adam because he was the son of god so he cursed the ground so you're going to work by the sweat of your brow you're you're going to have thorns and thistles grow up in your garden you're going to pull crabgrass hello anybody who is here wednesday night yeah that's under the curse and there it is and we're still dealing with that crab grass we're still dealing with the thorns can you say man so he's dishing out all these things and he's giving it what was adam but so adam had problems because of the fall adam had to work by the sweat of his brow because of the fall we're still dealing with a lot but i want to just say i'm not talking about today so much the problems as i'm talking about the problem singular because there was one problem with adam and everyone after him that was so deep and so ingrained in his nature there wasn't anything that he could do to fix it it was so deep it was so ingrained it went right into his spirit right into his nature and only god and let me say this only god knew the depth of the fall in the garden only god know how knew how deep it was i don't believe adam knew how deep it was i don't believe eve knew cain certainly didn't know and everywhere from there they didn't realize the depth of what took place it wasn't just a mistake that satan himself came and injected himself into the human race lodged his own nature in the spirit and the soul of man that's pretty deep and guess what you can't you can't take care of that you were born with it and here it was so deep that only god knew how deep it was and it wasn't time yet to redeem them so god put things in place himself for the next two thousand three thousand years god put things in place to help man and man man that was grateful for god they were thankful for the blood sacrifice they were thankful for the commandments they were they should have been they were thankful for the all the dietary laws that moses brought all these laws you know what god's doing he's saying i love my people and until i deal with the problem until i deal with the the depth of the problem within man i'm gonna give them some help that they stay on course and if they'll serve me if they'll reach towards me if they'll cry out to me i'll help them a long way because it's not time for me to deal with the problem yet but i'll help them deal with their problems if they'll live by my principles if they'll live by the my commandments thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shalt not steal i'm going to give them things and if they don't live by that it's going to be chaos so i'll give them something and i'll give them a blood sacrifice actually that if they'll come and the priest will come and a lamb is killed in their place i'll accept that for now but there's one problem is that you can't deal with the nature of sin with the spirit of an animal you can't do it with the blood of an animal you can only push off push off the sin you can't deal with the guilt of sin you can't deal with the nature of sin but god said i'll give you a blood sacrifice i'll accept that for now but guess what someday i'm going to deal with the problem my own way i'm fixing to have a good time today only god knew the depth of the fall i don't even think i'm sometimes i wonder when people don't cry out for the holy ghost in their lives and really get a deep experience with god maybe they don't understand how deep the serpent nature is rooted within us because if they really understood you know we're always looking for the good things we do we're always looking to pat ourselves in the back but but man in his nature when he's born there's a problem can you say amen and you can be good and you can give and you can help people and you can be a a a decent person in society and my kids are good people praise the lord i'd rather have good people on the earth than bad people i love that but that doesn't deal with the problem the problem goes deeper in our nature and only god can deal with that problem it goes deep within us and that's why people don't seek the holy ghost because they don't understand how deeply we have something rooted within us how deep it goes in the desire for sin it's in bread in our very nature come on folks say amen so only god could do it so i want to say let me say about problems you can have a lot of problems but you have one big one that yourself yourself you can't do anything about so yeah i know if you ever look at it that way but you have problems how many raise your hands i got problems in life all right about 40 of us what's the rest of you doing i want to know i got problems but your problems are really not as bad as the problem there's nothing worse than the problem but we glorify our problems we glorify our hurts and our pains and our losses and our and getting fired and all that and we got problems problems problems problems but you need to know there's one problem that that trumps all problems and that's the nature that we're born with and if we go our whole lives and deal with our problems even with the lord but ignore the problem then we're missing something what's what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul if we can ignore the one problem so i got i struggle in this and i do this and i i put this on and i wear this on my ears and i do this and i struggle with this and okay okay but you see now see that's all that's all just uh that's symptoms let's not talk about the symptoms i mean i could lay it down the line and show you the the dress code that comes right from the bible for you sisters and brothers sometimes i do it but i could lay it out just as crystal clear some of you still wouldn't follow it but i could lay it out and you could line up with it and i would appreciate that praise the lord but listen that doesn't deal with a deeper problem and i as i read that quote wednesday night and i was talking about crab grass the last quote i don't know if you caught it brother bram said it was he he was in the prayer line and there was this growth on this woman and he prayed for her and he cursed the life of it she went home she got worse because it swelled up he said i don't deal with the growth i deal with the life of the growth and i thought praise be to god that's my lord he doesn't just deal with the symptoms he doesn't just deal with the growth of cancer can you say man he strikes with the power in the name of jesus christ and he strikes that very life when sister kathy laid our head her hands on that child can you say man she was tapping into something than just dealing with the growth or the disease or whatever it is whatever it was she was tapping in the name of jesus christ and in a moment's time she laid hands on that child and it was healed i'm so glad to serve of god that strikes at the life at the root of crabgrass amen so you know uh it's pretty exciting now to read our text because right in the middle of the curses right in the middle of the curses and the judgments being handed out there's a strong bold proclamation from our god of redemption already this is the first little section of scripture that prophesies of redemption and he does it right in the middle of the curses being handed out i love that there's a strong bold statement guess who he's speaking it to he's speaking it to the serpent he's saying something to the serpent i see what you've done i've observed what you've done i know this goes deeper than man can ever help himself and now i have to lay out curses on you on adam and on eve i have to because god's a god of justice there has to be a payment can you say man there has to be something take place to to when we make when even we make a mistake there has if you're in god's world there has to be some type of punishment for there has to be a response about it you don't just get off scot-free when you make a mistake come on people listen these are simple things i'm if you do something sin has to have a response sin has to be taken care of you're going to own up to it you don't get off scot-free if you do something privately with yourself and you think nobody sees you there'll be a there'll be something that'll come as the fruit that comes from that because that's the way life works can you say that's the way god's kingdom work is works as well but in the middle of the curses in the middle of the judgments being handed out there's a strong proclamation from god that goes directly to the serpent in the middle of justice is mercy being predicted in the middle of justice mercy is being prophesied he's speaking to the servant and he's saying to the serpent i see what's taken place i'm paraphrasing now i see what's going on and i'm going to deal with this someday i'm going to deal with it in such a deep way i'm going to save my sons and daughters from this they can't even save themselves can you say amen let me say it this way let me paraphrase this way satan sir the serpent your offstring your offspring and by the way i just want to bring it up to anybody who's listening he said he spoke of the serpent's seed so this the serpent had a seed the serpent had an offspring so something happened and the serpent had an offspring and in the middle he speaks the serpent and simon here he says satan the serpent your offspring and her seed will be at odds for many thousands of years there will be an enmity with one another but one day to the serpent one day you will bruise his heel her seed you'll bruise his heel but i will bruise i will bruise he christ will bruise your head why aren't you why aren't we rejoicing in the middle of the curse in the middle of the judgments of god being handed out god puts in mercy for his sons and daughters it's not all cursed it's not a job and they're going to come underneath it and it's going to happen it's going to happen for thousands of years but god just laced in there puts in there but say serpent satan i say satan because he cursed the serpent to the ground became a snake but he's still speaking to this to satan and he said i want to let you know i see the problem they don't even see it i see the fall i see what's done it goes deep but i want to let you know i'm going to deal with some with it someday and say i'm going to deal with you and i'm going to do it my own way and when i do it it's going to be permanent you're going to have to chance you're going to have a chance to bruise this seed christ because that's the seed of the woman christ you're going to have a chance to to bruise his heel but i'm going to have a chance through christ and he's going to bruise your head now in the amplified it says it says strike the heel and crush the head so you're going to have a chance to strike at this christ at calvary but christ is going to crush your head come on somebody somebody praise the lord this is redemption already speaking under the judgments and he's letting your devil know you're the one who fights you at the very beginning i love my sons and daughters i'm gonna deal with this and when i deal with it i'm gonna crush your head what do you do with a snake if you're talking about a snake what do you do to get rhythm rid of him well if he's still alive he can strike at your heel he can strike at you he can even strike at your heel can you say that but the way to get rid of a snake is put your head on him put your foot on his head and i killed one the other day in our yard and the only way to get rid of him for me because i hate snakes i hate crabgrass and i hate snakes the only way to deal with that snake is to get him by the head and get something i got something and i chopped his head off because then he's finished for good he might wiggle around a little bit but then he he's just finished he's because his head is gone and god says god says you may strike at the heel even of my people you'll strike at the heel of this seat at calvary but i will crush your head through christ is god saying he's going to deal with it yeah he's going to deal with it and by the way we're post calvary now so he's already dealt with it at calvary he's already crushed the head of the serpent all he can do is is bluff with you all he can do is threaten you all he can do is bully you he has no power over what god said that you are he has no power this morning he's a bluff can you say man he he he is a he as my dad used to say he got his teeth taken out of calvary and all he can do is gum you to death your seed is gonna and that was a religious system by the way they're gonna strike at christ at calvary but my seed the woman's seed christ is gonna crush your head i'm gonna deal with this and i'm going to deal with it in a permanent way for my people i want you to notice now when he comes into his power redemption and you're already responding saying my my my my this is powerful this isn't just a band-aid on the problem he's going to deal with the problem of sin and he is going to make it so permanent his sons and daughters look at them they're hiding they're scared they're walking with their tail between the legs adam and eve hiding in the bushes bullied by the enemy speaking in shame speaking in guilt come on read your bible there they are hiding guilt shame and they're scared and they're and they're they're blaming one another and they're trying to dish it off and they're doing they're all out of sorts their minds are just gone here and they're walking with their tail between the legs scared and bullied by the enemy but i want to say that's not with god he's not scared he's not bullied by the enemy can you say man he says i know my son and daughter have failed but i'm making something crystal clear to you serpent i will deal with this and then i will deal with you praise the lord so right there he proclaimed that my people will come to the powerful work of my redemption there's nothing satan can ever do it begins the prophecies of redemption dealing with his people all the way till we come to the the birth of christ and that seed and we'll get to that in just a minute the powerful work of redemption he wasn't just going to put a band-aid on your problem this goes deeper than just putting a band-aid on your serpent nature that you're born with goes deeper than just you know i can fix this i can fix this you ever see it i can fix this leave it alone don't worry about it i can fix this we can fix everything you can't fix that nature that you're born with but god says i'm not only going to fix it i'm going to crush his head i'm going to kill that nature within an individual and last week at the camps we pray that young people get something real out of all that there'll be some that get something real like i got at 16 years old and satan crushed satan crushed the head that was sitting in my control tower at 16 years old he was sitting at the control tower of my desires and i can tell you god come one night and crushed his head he did it at calvary but then he did it for me he crushed his head in my life and i no longer desired from a soul level desired the things of the world i'm finished how can that happen at 16 years old what a miracle at 16 years old that the things of the world has grown strangely dim and i loved god i loved his word i loved his people god now how can i begin to serve you how can i serve his people how can i get closer to you how does that happen at 16 years old i can tell you only by god's uh conversion of the holy spirit going to a deep deep level in my life i didn't realize how deep it was but it was deep my friends it changed me and then i begin the journey of the flesh wanting to still do things and the soul saying nope the desire has been crushed somebody say praise the lord this morning so today i want to get specific about the powerful work of redemption and how deep it goes you know it's often that bible terms get used through the years and they lose their meaning i think redemption has lost its meaning a little bit we have to know how powerful god has provided a way of redemption for you we have to know how powerful it is there's words in the world that get me they lose their meaning with the words in the scripture that lose their meaning how about the word love in the world would you say that's lost this meeting i'd say so perverted homosexuals lesbians i love you i love you i love you and then loosely saying i love you satan has perverted the word love they don't even know what love is anymore uh the the word uh the word modesty the word modesty has has been watered down in its meaning praise the lord why do i have to why do i have to do this i i i asked that question why do people come to my church when i tell them so straight the truth modesty has lost its meaning masculinity it's lost its meaning femininity and i can go on and on but redemption redemption has lost its it's been watered down and somebody now is redeemed because they come and shake the preacher's hand or they come to a church and they enjoy the youth group and now well i've been redeemed no no no no no redemption is a process and redemption god handles it and it's a deep deep work that takes place in you it's it's a long lasting work can you say man and by the way it had a sacrifice with it because you don't have the redemption of this deep problem without a huge sacrifice and guess what you didn't have to make that yourself christ made it for you and so i've been thinking about the the causes of the fall and besides just the normal things that we've been taught in the message we've been taught that eve we know the cause of the fall eve disbelieved the word eve reasoned with the serpent and she left the word she was off on just one percent of it 99 of what was true as one percent lie and she believed the lie part she actually reasoned with the serpent and that's how we know that's how the fall took place when you get away from the word then then it it becomes chaos that's what happened in the garden and then we have all this trouble today even six thousand years later because eve left the word every hospital every prison do you realize it was one word that eve doubted listen to this now it was one word that eve doubted and that caused all the trouble one spoken of word of god eve doubted to be the truth and it caused every sickness every disease every suffering baby every ambulance that you hear every hospital to be built every operation that was ever performed every death that ever died for one person came from one person disbelieving the word of god from cancer to covet from adultery to pornography to homosexuality so many things we have in our broken world but it all came when eve disbelieved the word of god these are all the problems but the greatest thing that i've been thinking about as the greatest problem that came from the paul fall is that every man was born with the nature of sin it's the deepest problem and i've been i was pondering how all that took place and i don't have all the answers yet but i can i can summarize what i've learned so far and that is satan stood back and said how can i inject myself into the human race because you remember he wanted to be worshiped like god this was god's creation adam and then eve this was god's creation so he wanted to be worshiped like god in the beginning as lucifer so his question is how do i inject myself into the human race because that's the only way it's got to be a blending of natures i've got to get me i've got to get my reasoning i've got to get in order to be worshiped i've got to inject myself into the human race so i've been pondering that how how did he do that and he stands back and he says well i've got to inject myself he stood back and said he said i don't want to just get them to sin i don't want to just anoint them to sin in the way of just speaking in their mind saying go do this i actually want to sit on the control tower of their desires i want to be blended in with their nature and you forgive me if i'm not saying this perfectly right this is my crude way of saying it that's the best way i understand it satan could not create only god is a creator satan can only pervert what god has created so he couldn't if he could create then he could just create a seed in in eve of himself right because that's what god did he created his own seed in mary because he was a creator to reverse this thing but satan couldn't do that so he had to inject himself another way into uh humanity and he's he wanted to blend his nature he couldn't create so if he could then he would create a seed like in eve so he took over this beast of the serpent that was in the garden this beast that was very unique this one called the serpent he wasn't a snake then he stood upright he could talk to eve he could reason with eve so he was a different bird a different bird he was a different animal in the garden okay and he was stood upright he could speak and all these other things so he's got a strange thing there in the garden with all the animals he was animal and he didn't have a soul but he had a place for a soul and he was so close uh but but you see now all the animals couldn't reproduce with man all the animals couldn't reduce reproduce with man but this this had a seed that could come and come in and and reproduce itself so this vessel of the serpent is the one satan said i will anoint i will come upon i will use i will speak through him because the beast could mingle with this woman and it would be a beast that would be attractive and attract eve as well now i can go into a lot of details but if you study your bible and study what's happened since the fall you'll find these things to be true if it was a fruit that they ate that made them feel like that they were naked then let's start passing out the fruit because we have a lot of naked people in this world it wasn't a fruit that made them realize they were naked it was sin in the garden so somehow i'm summarizing now you got your seatbelts on somehow adam and eve and the serpent there's this mingling and mixing of the seed through relations and man fell by that and when he did he not only fell but was injected with a nature for sin he may try to deal with his problems he may try to make things better he should do all he can but that problem went so deep he can never change it himself because satan said i've injected myself into through these relations and through this thing through reasoning of the word but also not just reasoning of the word actually the blending and the bringing in of the nature that every man was born in sin shape and iniquity come into the world speaking lies from that point that's a pretty deep problem that you can't even have a baby that's not born in sin we would love to have perfect children and i know some people when they have babies think their children are perfect but none of them are perfect they're flawed and you can have grace for them because you were born flawed you weren't born perfect so can you imagine how deep this problem goes is that um we could safely say that we're a born loser because we you know i'm going to turn this around to positive in a minute and it can't get but positive when you talk about calvary but all of us no matter how rich a family we were born in no matter of message family no matter if our dad was a preacher no matter if our dad was a deacon no matter how good where we're at now all of that we have to admit we're all born with the same nature and god had to deal with it and some may go way into sin and some may do little private sins but guess what we're all guilty we're all born with something we can't help all your best men that you look out in the face of the earth and that's why all the best men all the most perfect people you can think of still we can't help one another out of this pit because we're all born with the same nature they looked in revelations 5 who's worthy to take the book who's worthy to deal with this problem if somebody doesn't take this book of redemption all creation is lost they looked through the whole earth and couldn't find anybody worthy of the best people even even all the good people in the old testament and the patriarchs we look up to none of them was worthy why because they were born just like us somebody that's born like you can't help you we cling to people we cling to family relationship and it's fine we clean and we become co-dependent on other people they can help me they behave and we lean on it too much what we need to do is lean on the lord we stand alone with the lord and say lord you deal with me internally let me not depend on someone else because no one can pull us out of the pit of this myriad clay except the hand of jesus christ grabbing our hand and pulling us out so we'd like to all be born perfect and have our children going perfect but it didn't happen and so from that point on here every man even able even and that's what i've been studying abel abel gets killed by cain seth enos then men begin to call upon the name of the lord said well he began to call upon the name of the lord he's righteous he's good there's a certain righteousness there but i'm going to tell you enos even when he called upon the name of the lord still had the problem the problem wasn't dealt with the problem has to be dealt with so besides man trying to deal with things god gives aids god gives helps god knew he would deal with it in time he had a blood sacrifice he gave commandments he spoke to the prophets to give leadership and then with all the blood sacrifices i'd like you to turn with me they can bring it up on the screen if you have your bible hebrews chapter 10 are you still with me here i appreciate this would be good for all it would be good for the young people the children hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered a year by year continually never make the comers they're unto perfect so you're talking about two to four thousand years of sacrifices by animals that god ordained and god said do this god god but with all of them thousands millions of sacrifices of the lamb that god said to bring with all of them it cannot make the the worshiper perfect it what's that scripture saying it don't deal with the problem if young people want to summarize version you say well i don't understand hebrews and all that i'm summarizing the next few verses and basically god's saying all the things even the sacrifice of the blood of the lamb doesn't deal with the problem for then would they have not have ceased to be offered if it dealt with the problem they would have stopped stopped offering blood sacrifices because that the worshiper once purge should have no more conscience of sin and and and that's desire for sin so if it was really have an effect the believer would have no more desire for sin no more conscious of sin if it was really dealing with the problem the desire for sin would be taken care of and so he goes on to say but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of his sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bows and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou what it's not but a body thou has prepared me in the burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin thou hast had no pleasure wait a minute god you're the one that set up the sacrifices and now you're having no pleasure in them why doesn't god have pleasure full pleasure in blood sacrifices that he set up why is it because it doesn't take care of the problem god said later on i'm gonna take care of that problem but the sacrifices of the blood of lamb and goats doesn't deal with the problem because why it doesn't attack and kill the conscience of sin the guilt of sin so the guy brought his lamb the priest brought it in for him once a year and the worshiper is somewhat satisfied they worship when they hear that goes into the inner veil there i guess we look at this way he goes behind the veil and he brings a sacrifice for the year and he's got little bells on his thing as the way my dad used to describe it according to the scripture is that if god accepted the sacrifice for the year that priest began to move around and dance and worship because god had accepted it for another year put off their sins another year remember to put on didn't do away with them so it doesn't do the guilt the worship is still going to leave with guilt right but he's worshipping and when they hear that priest in there and they hear the bells then the whole congregation begins to worship say praise the lord he's he's he's put away our sins for another year but it wasn't just a few days and the guilt and the desires are all still there what a pity friends to leave church and still have the desire if you want something deeper then find yourself at an altar of prayer find yourself at this altar if you got want god to deal deeper with you don't be afraid of it say lord i want you to change my desires get deep with god because he certainly provided a deep sacrifice for you they shouted they rejoiced but it didn't deal with the problem they put them off the blood of the bulls and goats thousands of them think of all the animals killed think of all the animal rights people would deal with this my goodness be chaos and all of it all the bloodshed all the bloodshed didn't deal with the problem all the sacrifices didn't deal with the problem we might we might relate that to our lives just in a little lesson that if you have the problem all the sacrifices you make for the church for society for charity all that's fine praise the lord that you're a servant's heart to each other but all the sacrifices will never deal with the problem how many vaults of blood was shed through the years and it didn't deal with the problem that's what the scripture is saying let me finish it for those in those sacrifices there's a remembrance again made of a sins every year for it is not possible but the blood of bows and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou shalt prepare me in burnt offerings and sacrifices sin thou hast no pleasure then said i le i come in the valium of the book it is written in me to do thy will o god above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hast thou pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second that second covenant amen so we'll stop there you catch the theme now none of those sacrifices can deal with it god says i'm going to deal with it and men try to relieve themselves they even they try to bring religion and stuff but in an animal spirit here's another problem the enantios an animal spirit from blood could not come back on a man so now we come into what we needed how god is he going to deal with it first god has to it's almost the same thing satan says i've got to inject myself into the human race and it can't come by sexual relation it can't by can't be by man being involved because the man and the serpent has his hands all over this fall when i come to redeem them in order to reverse it properly man and women and the serpent nobody can have anything to do with this i've got to inject myself why does he inject himself into the human race because there has to be an ultimate blood sacrifice and he has to be a kinsman like us god could not in his state as an object of worship he could not redeem us he had to become like us inject himself into humanity be the sacrifice so that if we start to say i'm going to believe the word of god i'm going to believe the word of god i'm going to believe the word of god i'm going to head towards the word of god and then we start saying that and his nature his nature kills the spirit of the serpent and we take on the very nature of god listen now can of a spirit of a man come on another man yes an animal can't but a man can elijah's spirit came four times after he was gone so a spirit of a man can come on a man but i'm saying this spirit of the man christ jesus had to come in man not just in his head not just an influence not just to wear a bracelet that says what would jesus do that's not redemption he's got to get in your very nature is this good bible teaching this morning i like this i like this this might be simple to some some that's already went advanced above all of us but listen we need to know we have the problem and we need to know the glorious work of redemption and how god did it for all of us hallelujah and so now let me just start to wrap things to where i want to go now so the answer was god to get back in flesh he could not do it as god the answer is creating a seed in women which he prophesied to the woman the woman doesn't have a seat of her own she has to be with a man referenced last sunday's message it's all about the mail the woman can't do anything or no she has to receive the seed from the mail can you say amen so that we understand that principle but look at this god said god said it prophesied and said her seed will her seed so he speaks of her seed she doesn't have a seed of her own but he's referencing i will give her a seed i will create a seed in a woman you sisters ought to be shouting because did you ever notice that it was the woman and we hear that all the time it was the woman that we felt by it was eve it was eve it was the chick that got us in all this trouble and we hear it and we hear it and we hear it but i want to just remind the devil and encourage you sisters that when god said in his redemption i'm going to choose another woman he could have chosen either but no no no she's the betting ground for life and so now when i go to redemption i know a woman fall and i put her under a curse to be her husband be a ruler and all that that's exactly right but when i start the process of redemption i'm going to take my own scene and create a seed within her a woman praise the lord well so women have an important position in the kingdom of god praise the lord i ought to hear shouting from the sisters here this morning praise the lord she wasn't his mother jesus said she's not my mother she was an incubator god could have used something else but he wanted to take the very lowest and show what he could do with it so now she's looked down on the lowest especially when she fell in the garden but god says i'm going to take the lowest and i can show what i can do with that to raise it up and make something out of it praise the lord that's god and so to make a way that he could get his spirit back in man now i'm rushing as you can tell that's a powerful work of redemption when he comes and gets his spirit back in man that's not just being a part of a church that's not just being friends with the pastor that's not just having a position in the church no this is god bringing his own spirit in man that goes deep can you say a man that that that that is taking out the crabgrass the root of sin rooting it out can you say amen hallelujah the first part of redemption though the first part of it is paying the price the kinsman redeemer a boaz redemption is all through the book of ruth if you want to read it boaz he had to have three things he had to be able to pay the price to redeem ruth he had to be willing to pay the price can you say amen and he had to be a kinsmen redeemer three things christ became our kinsmen redeemer he became us he had to be willing to pay the price and he said in the garden not my will but thine be done but then he had to be able to bring the right price to redeem you you didn't have it you were in debt anybody ever ever been in a debt you couldn't pay anybody had such a huge debt some of your school loans and all that and you don't know how you'll pay it you're hoping biden will write it off before he gets out of office or kicks the bucket he's you're hoping he'll write it off and how many has ever been no we had when i came into the marriage i had we had debt and uh we shouldn't do that it's a bad thing but it was school debt and uh so we had some debt we had a certain amount and it was overwhelming to come into the to back then you had to make the payments the payments were high and so we had that hanging over us in our as a young couple and so then i won't tell you the whole story but it was a real miraculous thing god healing our daughter and all these other things so we were dealing in the living room with the insurance people and we didn't know anything about this or anything but we had about we had accumulated thirty thousand dollars in debt with the hospital through my daughter being sick and my wife being sick thirty thousand dollars so now you can imagine the school loan you're already in debt now you got a thirty thousand dollar thing you have no insurance you have nothing to pay it so now we're looking at thirty thousand dollars and we're looking at um a certain amount that was our school debt and so the insurance man is in our office and i just i'm jumping to the end here because i've taken i'll pick this up next sunday all right let's can we make a deal here because i have too much hay on my fork i got the lord gave me a lot last night i want to read some quotes because this is pretty exciting now as we cross over in the redemptive work that god's done it's powerful to see what god has done for you and sometimes you don't need to complicate you just say lord i thank you for what you've done for me and i receive it but we had a debt there was no way possible you know when when we were i got married and we were pastoring we had five families in the church something like that so i think about there's about 10 10 to 12 weeks there wasn't any money in the account to take a paycheck i set myself on a paycheck you know every after variant what it was it was too low according to my wife but it was it was what i could take because i always like to live on a salary i don't like to take all the tides i like to live off the salary because all you live off a salary and live on a budget but it was pretty small and her grocery budget was 30 every week yeah then the young people are going wow yeah that's what it was and then there was 10 or 12 checks we couldn't even take a paycheck i'd establish this i want my paycheck there's no money there so that's the state we're in and then all this debt hang on and this accident takes place you have 30 000 hospital debt and you got an amount for the school loans so you know it's overwhelming and we'll never in this state we're in would never pay that i mean we suppose we can take the next 10 years and you can do it but i'll tell you it's uh some things are overwhelming so that insurance guy comes in there and he's talking with us and he says you know he's prepared for us to sue for whatever astronomical amounts and uh it's a good thing i was uh kind of dumb because i probably would have sued him for a million dollars my my wife went through trauma after that a little bit so there was residual things that took place a lot of people would do that but i said we're not we're not here i said we don't have any money for the hospital debt so he said we're taking care of all that bring me the invoices and so then he wrote out a check to all the hospitals for the 30 000. now i'm just saying this can you imagine the feeling how many has ever raised your hand how many's ever been there when something's been some the drop the charges have been dropped or the debt has been forgiven or somebody walked in and i've done this now that i have i'm positioned to give i've walked in and paid a debt for somebody but the feeling of being on the other end of it where you don't know how you're going to do this and then you get an offering for somebody and from somebody how many has experienced the feeling so he's writing those things out he wrote up hated all that and then he starts to talk about well what amount oh you guys i got it like so so he starts to talk about this and we're just kind of we really don't know okay so now this man doesn't know the figure of our school loan that's the rest of the debt left he doesn't know it and he throws out a figure that is almost to the penny of paying off our school loan and and we didn't i don't think we realized at that moment but labor when we checked did we realize it right then okay so we had prayed before i forgot that part and when he said it then wow i'm telling you almost to the penny the thousand i tell you what it was it was 18 000 and almost to the penny not exact on the penny but almost exactly to to the amount the man didn't know that we didn't tell the man that but god knew it but if any of you have ever been in those states when that man walked out of the room the feeling of having your debt paid you didn't have to do anything for it the feeling of having your debt paid overwhelms you and i'm here to tell you this morning there had to be a debt that's the first part of redemption there had to be a sacrifice to meet the debt and he went to calvary nobody knew what he was doing nobody knew he was going to deal with the problem and when jesus come up 12 years old or that he knew his commission and he knew in three and a half years he was headed right for that sacrifice that's why he was there nobody knew that matter of fact his disciples were so dumb to it at the end they're trying to keep it from happening can you imagine he's going to deal with their problem of sin he's they're trying to keep him from going that's how man can't understand when god deals with the problem let him deal with it don't question him doctor said oh no lord don't go from us do you realize peter and you what you're doing he's headed and he's headed right there his commission is i'm going to pay the price this is the moment that i'm gonna he's gonna bruise my heel but i'm gonna crush his head for my people i'm gonna save my sons and daughters i'm gonna release their debt from them you you owed every bit of the sin debt you owed every bit of that you've done you should pay for everything that you've done can i get people to raise your hands this morning it should come back on you but somebody walked the way the via dela rosa called the way of calvary and he kept going and he kept going and he kept going because he knew what he was doing i'm i'm going to take care of the debt i'm going to write the check let's stand together i gotta stop if you guys would jump to just one thing there it's one of the quotes in oneness and it would be 0211. oh no no 62 oh it'd be the third excuse me it'd be the third quote or the fourth quote if they're separated it starts with the debt of sin was paid can you find that one and we'll end on that the debt is saying sin is paid the debt of sin was paid now it would be down where it says the debt of sin is paid i don't have time to read all of them excuse me it starts with the debt of sin was paid can you find that one the debt of sin was paid jesus had to do this to send the holy ghost back upon to unite people again like it was in the garden of eden can you imagine now what this redemption is going to do never before this but now man if he sets his heart towards god and say i god i want you to change my nature he could ask for that all he wanted to before calvary and it wasn't going to happen till the price was paid right the holy ghost back on to unite people again like was there the debt was paid when jesus died that settled it amen brother if i could only get it to soak in see the debt is paid hallelujah to the lamb the debt is paid and every man and woman hearing me this morning or will hear me by the tape your penalty is paid next one don't you disbelieve god's word again come back to the word you couldn't even come back to the word he wouldn't even be saying that unless the debt was paid now we can come back to the word don't believe it he was the word glory i feel like shouting honest i do the penalty is paid it's all over no wonder angels screamed and sang the absence of heaven ring out yes sir the lost sheep was found and i like this part here that says i feel like shouting go back i feel like shouting the penalty's made it's all over i like that i like to say it this way the game's over when he went to calvary you weren't alive yet but we as far as god the game's over as far as the devil the game's over when the penalty was paid the game's over i know you weren't born yet i don't know and then when you come you've got the holy ghost you're growing in the lord with the holy ghost all that's happening now but guess what we it's so powerful redemption is so powerful that we can begin to shout and rejoice when we know the penalty has already been paid because it's game over i don't know what you feel about yourself this morning but you can anchor to this that we can begin to rejoice my debt of sin has already been paid it's already been paid ain't nothing to do what's the next one nothing you can do to add to it and a propitiation was made for him to be restored again the waters of separation god's word that washes him from his iniquity when the word died and by place and was resurrected again and become preeminent in my life in my heart amen the penalty is paid it's over we are redeemed we can say we're already redeemed when the penalty was paid we can start saying i'm redeemed you may not have the holy ghost this lord you may have it you may need to grow in the lord somewhere with the holy ghost but guess one thing you can proclaim this morning i am redeemed because the price has already been paid redemption's power has already come in my life when i accept the pardon that he gave me the price has been paid and that little boy and his dad a little story about making that little that little remote ship and they built it built it beautiful put it out in the lake it was great they had made it such a special thing to him and his dad and then it goes across and gets out and they lose it and they couldn't fight it in the whole lake it was completely gone about six months later the boy's in a in a shop and he sees his boat in the shop and he says that's my boat me and my dad that's special to me that's mine he said no you can't have that it's mine now i found it in the lake and i painted up made it nice and said you can't have it how much you want for i want a thousand bucks for it completely out of it it couldn't do it there's no way to do it until his dad walked in said that's so special that's ours i'll pay the debt i'll pay the thousand bucks he paid your debt to get you out of the pawn shop can you say man i like when gideon sings that song sing it worth it worth it sing that sing it you thought i was worth saving yes yes so you came and changed my life you thought i was worth keeping so you cleaned me up inside you thought i was to

my sin and i'll tell you friends there isn't any sin that's too far out of god's reach that can be washed away from this or there's anything you've done or someone's done to you that it's it's it's not out of reach of the mighty blood of jesus christ did i help this morning did the lord help you to see how powerful this work of redemption goes this isn't shaking the preacher's hand this isn't just a churchianity this is just i'm a part of the youth group this goes so much deeper than that but you got to accept it you got to say lord i need it i need it in my life so i've been in the message 20 30 years listen let's look at the facts here let's look at where we're at with the lord right now whatever god has done his redemption that's the part of this message i want it's actually about redemption when he said i'll open the seven seals off the book of redemption he's finishing work the work of redemption today but i wanted you to know the first step that before you you say well i i need to be way down here i need to be further along in my christian walk i don't feel like i measure up you can today say to the devil my penalty has been paid my penalty satan has been paid and i'm headed in the right direction because he redeemed me by his blood god bless you this also is open god bless you as you're dismissed this morning in the name of the lord if you need prayer or anything don't hurry the holy spirit be soft before him and say lord thank you for the word that you've given me let it not just be a sermon but let it be something deeper than that this morning i pray in jesus name
