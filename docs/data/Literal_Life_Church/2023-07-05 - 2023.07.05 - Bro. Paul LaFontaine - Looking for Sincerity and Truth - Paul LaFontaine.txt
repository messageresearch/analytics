========================================

you're listening online God bless you in your homes and we pray trust tonight will be a evening we can study the word together here in a bit of a study I know a few Wednesday nights I had talked about the feast a little bit and so tonight I'll just take a little another area of that that was inspired we've been praying about it here the last couple days so we'll do that praise the Lord God bless you each one First Corinthians chapter five we'll just study this together and you'll be listening real close it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you so I want you to notice here the rebuke is not only to the ones who are committing fornication but it's also to the church and not dealing with it correctly so the rebuke is for both it says in verse 3 then for I verily as absent in the body but present in the spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus it would certainly take a lot of maturity and prayer to handle a situation this way your glorying is not good now he's speaking to the Corinthian Believers your glorying is not good no know ye not that A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrifice for us so there he refers to Christ fulfilling the Feast of the Passover he is the Passover Lamb and so he refers to that Feast but look what he says here verse 8 therefore let us keep the feast let us keep this Feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen thank you Father for your word tonight thank you for the absolute of your word thank you for good Christian Fellowship around your word Lord there are many social Gatherings that we could be a part of and partake in but Lord there's something special in our hearts when we open break bread together and believe the word together and study the word together as something just special about it to Believers and so Lord we pray tonight as we have worshiped and give our hearts to you that will you will Express Yourself Lord in this teaching and this preaching express yourself back to us and teach us something Lord as we sit and we learn at your feet and Lord we are not afraid we are positive Lord that this word will carry us through to the other side this word has power in it to undo and change situations we can't change this word has power to deliver the worst sinner from the worst condition your spirit and your power is able to do it so that's why we trust in it Lord and we just put this out to you tonight that we love you we thank you for life we thank you for the word we just pray father you'll get in it tonight and anoint us for it to deposit something to the people that they can take home with them tonight and we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said amen praise the Lord God bless you may be seated so in talking about these feasts we find here an example of Paul bringing one of them forward to teach on and that was the Feast of Passover and so he brings it Forward into a situation that we'll talk about in a minute uh that happened within the Corinthian Church there uh message Believers and I always call these local churches in the Bible the Corinthians the Ephesians the Galatians all these were actually local message churches that rose up as a result of the ministry of the son of man and so there were local believers who believed the message of their day but how many know that every church was different and every heard church had different things that the Holy Spirit had to address and the Holy Spirit knew about all those situations and so we know brother Brown referred to the Corinthians being a bit immature they were babies and they needed to grow up in certain things and then we find the Ephesians were grown up and they could be taught some of the deeper things and they grew into their position in place in predestination and all those things and then the Galatians were of course rebuked by being influenced by the legalistic brother from Jerusalem so every church just like the seven Church churches in Asia Minor everyone who had different distinctions and characteristics to them all of them had some weaknesses which by the way the Holy Spirit would not let go when he was speaking he addressed their weaknesses how many is glad tonight the holy spirit's nature is still the same in your life he will allow us to continue in our weaknesses but we'll address them according to the word of God every church is in the Asian Minor had different distinctions that actually became the characteristics of the ages further ages down the road but every that was local churches and Asia Minor Ephesus Smyrna in those different cities those are local message churches that we have in the Book of Revelations they started as just seven local churches in that country that area of Asia Minor there and it was quite something how the Holy Spirit addressed those different things and it became something different brother Jack Duff was had just visited a few of those places and he said he'd like to take some ministers and go there someday and said if I can do it I'm all in because I would love to go back and visit those places amen so now if you have different characteristics then each of each of them is dress addressing different things and so we have here Paul addressing a situation in the Corinthians Church of incest and he calls it fornication but it was actually incest and that's the same thing it's a sexual immoral thing going on amongst the congregation and so he comes and he deals with it in his rebuke to the church he deals with a different way because he brings in this Passover uh Feast that took place and he refers to that and then he says that we should keep this Feast we should keep this Feast so that lets us know what uh what I was trying to bring to you a few weeks ago that the the seven feasts that if he says we should keep this Feast so if we think all of these feasts are dropped off after the Old Testament because they were in the Old Testament then we're missing something because they we don't drop them off but we know that they have a spiritual fulfillment in our our lives and Jesus said it this way I come not to destroy the law but I come to fulfill the law so whatever is out there in the Old Testament we can't as the modern church just dump all that off it has a meaning it has a purpose and it translates into our spiritual walk that we apply these things and the Seven feasts are no exception there's something spiritual that Christ fulfills all those things and he's fulfilling a lot of those things in us so when Paul says we should keep the feast maybe some of the new Christians were saying but I thought we were done with that I thought we moved on past Calvary now we don't celebrate not we don't physically separate celebrate those days but spiritually they're still in place and he says we should keep the Feast of Passover so spiritually something happens to us if you study the Feast of passed over started the night in Goshen where God the death angel was going to come and he said apply the blood to the kill the lamb and dress the lamb and it's a feast of unleavened bread so have have bread but no leaven in it because leaven means sin so they're doing all this stuff in the household and then they apply the blood to the door and the light the death angel passed over their house because they had the blood and they had purged leaven from the bread and done all things all the things they needed to do so when you say keep the feast well that has a meaning for us because we have not only a lamb that has been slain for us we not only have applied the blood to our lives but Paul says a part of this Passover feast is to purge the leaven from the lump and he's actually dealing with an issue that was in the church so he's telling them I'm rebuking you as a church that you cannot A little leaven will leaven the whole up it's going to eventually affect somebody else so grow up and be a mature a mature Church grow up and and try your best to look to the word of God and not ignore what's going on but to address it to look at it because if you don't Purge it how many know the holy spirit is also a purging nature to it it wants to purge something that's not right and so if that continues in our Christian walk then we find under the Passover feast that we believe in our lives this Passover this lamb that we celebrate is one thing the next thing is we realize we must say Lord Purge the leaven out of this bread if I'm to celebrate this I can't just celebrate the sacrificial lamb at Calvary but I've got a purges 11 out of the bread I've got to eat this bread with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that's the that's the two words I want to get to in just a minute but the uh sufficient to say that these feasts Paul's saying let's keep this Feast there's a spiritual keeping of these things it's very interesting to say uh that we're under this Feast of unleavened bread it's interesting that he learns it that's the bread of sincerity and Truth now these two words together sincerity and Truth together are only together in one other place in the Bible and that's the Book of Joshua sincerity and Truth are not mentioned anywhere else except here in Corinthians and back in Joshua and by the way at the end of the Joshua commission at the end of his life it's some of the last things that he says to the children of Israel after all their history coming out of Egypt all the Miracles all the signs all the Wonders and here he they come through all the history of it and then they come into the promised land they're taking their land they're taking the countries they're doing all this after all the history of being in the message and all the things that they've been through let's go to Joshua if you would chapter 24. and let's read it because it's because it's the only other place in the Bible it has to have significance that these two words sincerity and Truth are mentioned together must be pretty important and the time frame must be pretty important as well Joshua chapter 24. if you read the whole chapter 24 you read Joshua telling the people their history God through speaking through Joshua and saying I took you out of Egypt he gives the whole history again pick it up in verse 8 said and I brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelled on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land I destroyed them before you then balak the son of zapor the king of Moab arose in Ward against Israel and sent and called The Prophet Balaam the son of boar to curse you but I would not hearken unto Balaam therefore he blessed you still so I deliver you out of his hand the the history is here is that every incident Balaam uh the false prophet come among among you Nathan and Cora uh the Red Sea everything everything in their history that they came through God said I delivered you out of all those things you're still standing because I was there and delivered you out of all of it and then he says verse and they went and he went over Jordan and came here comes Joshua commission now he went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of Jericho fought against you the amorites the pairs asites the Canaanites the Hittites and the gurga sites and the hivites and the jebusites didn't I pronounce all those real good and I delivered them into your hand and I sent you all know that years ago when I was trying to pronounce all these things in the Bible Sister Margaret sent me a dictionary how to pronounce Bible words that's why I appreciate her so much she knows I need help you try to pronounce some of those things sometimes and I sent the Hornet before you which drave them out before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow and I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and the olive guards which ye planted not do ye eat he's saying I've brought you into your promise you're dwelling in it and we as the bride can say he's brought us into our Promised Land of the Holy Ghost when he stood at the seals he said he said Joshua I've seen you two-thirds of the way to Jordan and when the seals were getting ready to be broke it's bringing the people into their inheritance can you say man the bride can say he has brought me this far and now we're living in these cities and we're living in this word and we're blessed but it seems like every time God blesses the people it always comes with a warning because we can take it for granted we're the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth everybody raise your hand tonight so I'm the most blessed person on the face of the Earth to see what I see prophets and sages have longed to see what you see in this day they would have loved to just have a portion of the Revelation that you understand tonight they would have been transported into this day after the Seven Seals and live in this time of Glory of his word they would have easily done it but God chose you to live here that's why you say you got to say thank God for being there for blessing me this way after all this he says I've done for you the verse 14. now therefore now therefore now what do we do now what's the end of all this we're at the end Joshua's getting ready to go pass away it's the end of the Joshua commission it's the end time after all the history of Israel coming into their land now therefore what fear the lord serve him in sincerity and Truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord that's our instructions now that's what he says yes serve him with all your heart but serve him with sincerity and Truth do you know what that is well the opposite would be insincerity being deceiving being fake being pretend having pretense as I said Sunday your lips honor me but your far your heart is far from me sincerity take the opposite then you'll understand what God's saying and truth instead of living on lies you live every day in the truth you're only interested in one thing that's truth your kids come and tell you something don't just jump on it wait until you find the truth and I'll tell you sometimes it takes years before truth is manifested a person can tell a lie and it sounds exactly right and be careful believing into it because you don't know sometimes it takes a while to manifest but we should be lovers of Truth can you say Amen lovers of Truth lovers of sincerity lovers of being real lovers of being real Christians wanting to dwell amongst people that are being real because the whole world's lying and deceiving and all that that shouldn't be in the church we should serve him in truth and honesty and serve him with a with an uh honesty not a deception not trying to give the people and and and cry crocodile tears that's another meaning for insincerity crying crocodile tears we don't believe them because it's not real we should be the most real people on the face of the Earth and saying Lord let me serve you one way with sincerity and Truth it's the essential elements at the end Joshua says they said what do we do now we've got the land we're rejoicing serving with all your heart with sincerity and Truth he must be saying it for a reason because they'll be challenged to get proud get proud and and lose their sincerity and lose and and then this whole thing of serving other gods so I think it's Joshua reminds them of their whole history and then he says serve him in sincerity and Truth the last thing this is what we need in the last days this is what we need to live this is what we need to display this is what I look for and remember every preacher has the right to preach this entire message and pull out quotes and say what's going to be the end what's going to be the final Revival what what's going to be what's going to be the the manifestation of the third poll there's so many things that we can do friends but this preacher every time I look I see that he's put his word in place we have his word it has power within it but where do we put ourselves to see that more and manifest in our life it's more simple things than what we realize it's not working up an emotion in the people it's not taking us back to Pentecost it's serve him with all our heart with sincerity and truth if we have Lies We Must dispel all the lies if we have insincerity and deception with one another we must Purge that from us and we must be a real people of honesty [Applause] this is what I see is the end God's simplifying this for me because I don't have to impress everybody I don't have to be the biggest preacher in the message and I don't have to dabble in adult games that people play and all kinds of gossips and I can back off and say no wait a minute I can just close in here and just say I just want God's given me something here I just want to serve him in sincerity and truth I don't really care can't really care about all the drama that's going on and all the drama in the message I don't I just want a servant in sincerity and truth I want him to be pleasing with my life I may not please everybody else but I want to be pleasing to him is everybody in agreement tonight he simplifies this thing and I don't have to feel a pressure to put on some emotion if I get emotional and do the victory dance like I did Sonny praise the Lord but tonight if that's not where God's leading then I'm open to What the Lord Has I'm not going to feel pressured that I have to put on something and be insincere I'll be myself I'll be how God's leading me at this moment because that's sincerity doesn't he say if you'll get the people to believe in his commission if you just get the people to believe and be sincere nothing will stand in your way not even cancer come on people if you just get the people who believe and be sincere and then that mamba snake come up onto up him in a in a dream ready to take his life and the angel kept telling you must be more sincere it always amazed me to come against this mob of snake you must be more sincere A man that had lived the life that he lived and the angels saying you should be more sincere and what he's saying is that there cannot be any lies or pretense in your life I am an open book before God and for everybody I speak the truth I live the truth and when I say something whatever it is I mean it from my heart you must be more sincere to come against this snake in this hour to deceiving and so his last words to the people before he died is to serve the Lord with sincerity and Truth I'll tell you friends I want to say to you tonight this is what I'm looking for this is what I title this service tonight this little bible study looking for sincerity and Truth what are you looking for brother Paul what are you looking for what's next I'm looking for sincerity and Truth in the people of God I'm looking for more sincerity and Truth in the people of God this is what I look for in my own life in the bride this is not just a sermon tonight but I'm growing groaning to see this I'm groaning for true and real Christian Fellowship with honesty with sincerity not grown-up games not childish games because there is both there's childish games and then there's new grown-up games that people play and politics and deceiving and saying what you don't mean but I want honesty and sincerity and to be amongst the people of Truth people who tell the truth brothers who call themselves brothers that will act like true Christian Brothers they communicate like brothers not like the world not like the wisdom of the world but they actually communicate in honesty like brothers in Christ that's a real brother when he acts that way not with pretense not hiding not fakeness not lying not lips that speak and support and compliments but their heart is far from it Lord let me be first tonight let me have a fullness of sincerity and truthfulness before your presence It also says to put away the Gods and this is in tune with First Corinthians five that we read when it says Purge out the leaven Joshua says you you must put away other gods what does that say purging Purge your lives if he's saying that I don't know if they still had uh hints towards God's there but we can't serve God any other way but in sincerity in truth and put away the gods which your father served that were on the other side that's what he says it sir there's a purging a lot of times people thinks that stops at the end the purging of Our Lives stops at the end it's actually a part of the end it's a it's a part of our lives at the end it's in this a perverted world there's still a purging that goes on in our lives I I thank God when he purges my life I thank God when he cleanses my life I thank God when he washes me of something that's hidden there in my life I thank God and I don't I don't get offended when he's correcting me can you say Amen when he's trying to purge the church or Purge me of something I don't get offended at that because I want to be washed without any spot or wrinkle can you say Amen Hallelujah and so it's actually part of it as we purge the purging is a part of the work of the Holy Spirit at the end time the challenged then he says to them which I feel like through the ministry is the challenge that's been coming lately choose you this day whom you will serve I'm in verse 15 now if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord can you imagine that if it if it seems evil for you to serve the Lord in your heart if it seems evil to serve the Lord then choose choose don't be in between choose who you want to serve if your mindset is that the message is bondage you need to make a choice Joshua is challenging the people saying if you are sitting around thinking this is evil to do this this is a bondage to do this this is can you imagine saying that if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord then what's wrong you've got to make a choice choose you to stay whom you will serve whether the gods which your father serve that were on the other side of the flood and the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell and I love it how he makes it so clear he said as for me and my house we will serve the Lord Joshua said make your choice but I want you to let you know my choice as for me and my house as for me in this house we're going to serve the Lord and let the devil know we're going to let everybody know this is how we set up this church 35 years ago as for this house we're going to serve the Lord as for this house we're going to preach the message of the last days the message of Christ we're not going to bend on it we're going to keep preaching it every quote from the Seven Seals to high heels we're not going to leave any of it out I have freedom tonight to preach all of it and guess what we need all of it make a choice we made 135 years ago that choice has not changed a lot of influences try to change me try to change the tone of it we're not changing as for me in my house we will serve the Lord fathers need to do that heads of the homes can you say Amen young couples do it right now make a choice this thing isn't an evil thing but if you think it is don't be be the man in the middle he's he's challenging them even if to shake their hand and say hey God bless you whatever Direction that's What Abraham did a lot as his wife looked at the Fashions down in Sodom and they set their tent they didn't go to Sodom right away they pitched their tent towards Sodom and Abraham just said God told me there needs to be a separation you choose a way and I'll choose the other way shook hands with his his nephew God bless you and I'll be praying for you you need to get in a fuss about it you don't need to influence one another choose who you want to serve choose you this day and he said to all of Israel Purge from the leaven Purge the gods right now and but you need to choose you this day who you will serve Hallelujah so Christ the word is our bread of life how many know that Christ the word is our bread of life bread spiritual bread is our spiritual nourishment it's part of our spiritual nourishment that's why the Atkins diet is unscriptural can I get an amen brother Stephen back there but let me qualify that for the guy who's tried every diet it's it's not about dieting as much as it is eating the right Foods all the time every day I just want to remind you though that the scripture is for bread not against it here's what the scripture is for being in good health is scriptural and being in good health spiritually is scriptural and that means we need every nutrient every vitamin every mineral that the god that God has provided for us to be healthy people that's why we have a world that's all these other things and you go one way and go that way and it just makes a mess and a lot of those you end up in a mess anyway and gaining all the weight back been there done that but it's just it's at the end of the day it's that God has provided good natural nutrients for us to eat a balanced diet and that's what he wants us to do spiritually and bread is one of those things the bread so and so when we talk about bread now when they broke bread together and often we talk about this at the Lord's Supper uh the term breaking of red came from it didn't mean that they just got together and they tore the bread and they ate it together it had a much deeper meaning when they broke bread together it meant that they come together to be nourished by the bread of life that he has sent us they're eating the bread of life together they're breaking bread together like we're doing tonight breaking bread together eating together the bread of life and breaking bread also means a love feast it's about the sweet brotherly Fellowship that goes on around eating of Christ the word in this hour and it can't stay sweet fellowship if there's leaven in the lump that's why purging has to go on a continued purging has to go on and so it's a it's the love Feast goes with it sweet Fellowship around eating Christ the word of the hour and our communion when we have it projects that breaking of the bread that it should happen all the time in our life always in remembrance of the Lamb this Passover that's what communion light is about is remembering what our lamb did for us remember that judgment passed over us because of the Lamb so now then in chapter 5 before uh Paul speaks of the Gathering and speaks of the feasts that we're at now as he brings in verse 11. he talks about let us keep this Feast of the Passover let's keep this Feast but it also shows how we eat this bread Christ is the unleavened bread which means there's no world mixed in it with it lemon is the world there's no world mixed in with it it's pure we must keep it that way the elements that are in it must also be in us and those elements he brought out are sincerity and truth it must be kept pure so that you can stay in a state of serving him of sincerity and of Truth whenever lemon comes in the world comes in we tend to lose our sincerity and we tend to buy into lies so to eat right we must keep the leaven out keep the insincerity out the lack of being real the lack of being honest losing depths of the meaning of the word of God we must keep living out truth instead of lies and so this this case what Paul addressed was an incest case going on in the Corinthian Church in other words it was a moral failure but it was deceit it was being sneaky it was going around the Saints and hiding something and because he said at the beginning it is reported commonly among you the word started to get out of this incest going on and they're still coming to church they're still having the Lord's supper and so now but what was the incest it's moral failure but it was dishonesty it was insincerity it was being sneaky we don't know how these people were but if they were coming maybe they were worshiping just like everybody else and going on and Paul had to rebuke the church why are you letting this go on without something being said about it and I know God rebukes and corrects most of the things over the pulpit and not publicly calling names I understand that because God's a gentleman I want to remind everybody though of scripture don't get scared I'm not going to do anything tonight but I want to remind you of a scripture that says those that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear every time I read stuff like that people have forgot it's in there and people get nervous oh which direction is our pastor going what's next I will by the help of the holy spirit always be a gentleman I'm not wanting to embarrass anybody but I'm also not wanting let's to let sin continue in the church that it begins to affect other people those that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear because it has to be a respect for the body of Christ there has to be a respect and he's challenging them grow up and be real mature Believers and deal with this thing don't let them just keep coming and not address it and sit them down and and say you need to repent of this thing so I could quickly mention he says the malice that says we should not have that bread of malice which means naughtiness wickedness on purpose uh a person is not ashamed to break the laws that's what that is and just this uh anger as well as we've been talking about the anger in this generation and also the anger from the enemy but still coming and gathering with the rest to eat he's saying let's let's take care of this I'll speak about a little bit more in a minute because there's got to be reasons which you don't know all the reasons but Paul gives some of them that they're letting this go on and he says you're not mature about this you're letting it go on and it's it's it's beginning to eat away and and you're proud or something's wrong here that you don't want to deal with this going on right among you and now everybody's learning about it reason for that I'm gonna I've been uh enjoying a Charles Spurgeon one of his sermons because when I looked up the the this sincerity and truth and I looked up what he said about it and also I'll read something the the messenger for our age talked about it but we'll talk about Charles Spurgeon the prince of preachers here in the 1800s and I don't have time this is a Sunday morning sermon and it's type it was typed out by somebody it's in a book but I just thought wow he really Nails it here and I'm going to read some of that tonight from Charles Spurgeon he says that uh you guys have that back there ever more in Scripture the doctrines of Grace are married to the precepts of holiness where Faith leads the way the virtues follow in a goodly train the roots of Holiness and happiness are the same and in some respects they are but two words for the same thing now this is really deep because Satan would like to separate Holiness from happiness I I sometimes talk to the young people about this because if you go back even from the very beginning of Temptation uh to Eve is that he always likes to separate the obedience that Adam and Eve are under and take away from that and if you could believe this you could be gods and all these so so this made them happy so in other words right from the beginning he's separating obedience and he's separating Holiness and being separate unto God to his word from happiness you'll be Gods you'll be happier that's what he does to young people if you it is no way that I could ever be happy if I live this holy life before God that's a lie I should get more amens than that that's a lie from the enemy that that I'll never be happy if I live holy in God that's where true happiness is happiness and Holiness are never separated true now not legalism but true Holiness and living a Sanctified life before God there's only true happiness in that and so now he says some good things the roots of Holiness and happiness are the same and in some respects they are but two words for the same thing there have been persons who have thought it impossible that Holiness shouldn't come out of the preaching of salvation by faith if you tell men that there is life in a look at the crucified one will they not conclude that cleanness of life is unnecessary so this is something that I just want to sit on just a minute because I I personally believe he's begging something way back then that would be the language or would be the doctrine of the Antichrist and that is that you begin to look at this salvation by faith that that it's not on works it's not what we do it's not what we wear it's not any of that salvation is on a gift of God alone it's what he did for us at Calvary so with that if you go with that then you would say you'd have to separate two things and say and there's not a life that comes from it but he's saying all the way back here in the 1800s that you can never separate the two and you can't say there's a life as we look at the crucified one will they not conclude that the cleanness of life is unnecessary If You Preach salvation by grace through faith and not at all by The Works of the law will they not draw the inference that they need not to obey Christ but may live as they list so he's begging something that now we're living in the full manifestation of a modern church that completely eliminates holy life and Holiness can you say Amen because he's done it all at Calvary and that's it I don't have to offer anything else and he's pegging it already he's saying but but they can live as they list they can live whatever the way they want to live to this the best answer is found in The Godly honest and sober lives of men who are most zealous for the gospel the grace of God on the other hand there have been others of antinomian spirit who have dared to say that because they are saved and Christ has finished his work for them so that nothing is left undone by way of Merit true therefore henceforth they may act as they please seeing that they are not under the law but under grace does anybody see this as the language of the modern church today we're not of their law we're under grace but you better separate that through the word through a balance can you say Amen because now you wig yourself out of the power of salvation power of a life because if it's true salvation it had power it changes your desires I said it changes your desires on the inside our reply is that the faith which saves is not an unproductive Faith but is always a faith which produces good works and abounds in holiness salvation in sin is not possible it always must be salvation from sin praise be to God for preachers to have the anointing of this word and this he's he's got it for sure I love that salvation in sin is not possible it always must be salvation from sin as well speak of Liberty while yet the irons are upon a man's wrist or boast of healing while the disease waxes worse and worse or glory in Victory when the Army is on the point of surrendering as a to dream of Salvation in Christ while The Sinner continues to fill full swing to his evil passions Grace and Holiness are as Inseparable as light and heat in the sun true faith in Jesus in every case leads to an adherence of abhorrence of every false way and to a perseverance in the path of Holiness even until the end shows you got something real you may make mistakes but your Pursuit is the pursuit of holiness Paul says he says now that he now that we have come he said now cleanse ourselves from all the filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God it's all scriptural the Apostle Paul White was showing the Corinthians how wrong they were to tolerate an insetuous person in their midst compared the spirit of uncleanness to evil leaven so now he goes to the scripture of my text today then the leaven suggested to him the Passover and turning aside for a moment he applied the type of the past uh pastoral Feast so as to make his argument yet more cogent he would urge Purity upon them by every conceivable reason and his Keen Eye saw an argument in the sublibration of the Passover in using this type he furnishes me with another proof of the fact that hard by any Scripture wherein you find the safety of the believer guarantee you are sure to see needful Holiness set side by side with it and I can say Amen to that if you know your Bible as it proclaims the truth of how you're secure in Jesus Christ it always comes around to how we live our life in pleasing to him you can never separate it is right and he he probably knew his Bible better than I did he knows that she'd be hard to find a place of the safety and guarantee of the believer being saved oh and not have scriptures with it talking about Holiness that's side by side here you have the Passover of favored people safe beneath the sprinkled blood safe in that dire hour when the destroying Angel's sword was unsheathed but you find the people busily engaged in purging out the defiling leaven from their houses they were not saved by purging out the leaven but being preserved by the sprinkled blood they were obedient to the Divine precept and diligently put away the corrupt and forbidden thing the purity of the house from the house from leaven went side by side with its safety by the blood praise be to God everything brother Brandon preached about the token can you say Amen to open the Holy Ghost through the blood of Jesus Christ but it must be on display can you say amen and that household must be obedience and he said full obedience to the whole word of God whole word of God entitles you to the token amen we shall this morning so this is a morning sermon by Charles Spurgeon I guarantee you this it's only the start of his sermon it's so good I'd like to preach the rest of it but it's evening here so I can't we shall this morning first consider the happy conditions of the Believers next the holy Duty commended to them running side by side with their privilege and thirdly we shall show how their happiness and Holiness their Holiness and happiness act and react upon each other you want to study it you find it online in spurgeon's sermons and this one I think is called sincerity and Truth the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you can read the rest of things it's powerful and I believe everything he said I believe it with all my heart and that's what I'm saying the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth we're celebrating we celebrate that Passover spiritually but you can't do it by just saying we're all saved and I don't know why the Corinthians here were just being so uh ignoring what Paul is trying to bring out ignoring sin here in the camp and I know we try to be respectful but he's trying to and he uses this we must Purge out the old leaven lest all the rest of the congregation be affected and uh Spurgeon here I'm just going to say something about the Antichrist Spirit Spurgeon here is pegging something perfectly that I will call the doctrine of the modern Church eliminating the holy life from salvation and the Holy Ghost watering down the Holy Ghost and watering Down a true powerful conversion watering it down to making the holy life not necessary the Antichrist spirit I don't I want to study that greater in the future it it is it is something it started the Antichrist Spirit started in the early church what was it it's something that began was let me just call it the Antichrist begin in the early church because Paul said the mystery of iniquity death already work all the way back just a few years after the original Pentecost the spirit of iniquity was already working but I want to describe it this way and you can write this down I want to say the mystery behind church history is Satan's alternative Christianity I just expressed something to do if you're listening online or wherever uh if they put this on the broadcast I want you to think about that don't get mad at me but there's a mystery behind church history there's two vines that come all the way through there and the Mystery of church history the most alarming thing that happens that we cannot believe it and most churches would never believe it is that Satan presents an alternative Christianity than the real power of the Holy Ghost Spurgeon pegged it when he was saying that our messenger uh pegged it dead on and and and and here we are living with it here we are and so you even hear the language of the Antichrist you will hear it in so-called Christians sometimes but you also hear it in movie stars and music stars and icons that we look to you just listen real close to how they describe the grace of God listen real close how they saying how they dissect Christ and the life of Christ and all these other things and you'll hear similar comments even Justin Bieber became a Christian and his wife Hayley Bieber and there isn't anything that I can see there all due respect there isn't anything you can see from their life nudity and immodest stressing and all kinds of spirits and everything that fill their lives and yet they're Christians and they become describers of what real Christianity is tolerance and no condemning anybody and you watch them describe you're in trouble you're in trouble if you're letting people like that describe your Bible foreign because it won't be the language of the Bible of Holiness it'll be the language of the Antichrist it'll be his terms because it's an alternative Christianity friends I'll just say this the world is full of it and it creeps in Among Us so Paul he's the the church World eliminates this purging you know one reason I'm saying it tonight is when mother Brown said when the when the true church gets a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church shall become an invincible Army well I thought it was other things that makes her an invincible Army and all there's a when the church gets the tribulation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church she'll become an invincible Army we still have love we still have courtesy we still have respect we still shake hands and be brothers but be aware the Antichrist Spirit tries to work Among Us and so we have to be watching and when she realizes the two Spirits working we still manifest Divine love but she'll become an invincible Army and so eliminating the purging of the leaven from our life Paul in Corinthians brought this for whatever reason the Corinthians were pretending that this was not happening they were not going to deal with it I don't know why they were too proud uh maybe they were having services that were so great and they didn't want to disrupt the great Services they were having by trying to say there's fornication Among Us there was no preaching about it there was no correction about it but the Corinthians must have spiritually charged services with the gifts of the Spirit working and all these other things maybe it was just going so well outwardly they didn't want to be embarrassed to admit that there's this boy having relations with his stepmom right where they were coming to church and shouting with them and they were too proud to deal with it and we don't want to you know lots of gifts working a lot of things going on but notice the two problems number one was the fornication living a lie while in fellowship with the church a moral failure living a lie while in fellowship with the church but greater than that the church was too afraid to purge and to deal with it they were too soft the rebuke is to the church more than it was this young man from Paul what is the call then from Paul as I bring this down to a close tonight have you enjoyed the study what's the call from Paul in dealing with the insetuous incestuous thing that took place a moral failure amongst the congregation what's the call to the church the call to these immature Corinthian message believers is to begin living lives of sincerity and Truth the call is to partake of this feast of Our Passover Lamb but with a sensitivity to live lives of Truth and sincerity not cover everything up but eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth and you say Amen this is the way brother Branham said it that's the way a real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed is the man who God will not impute sent to it's not on his account it's been swiped off his count by calvary's cross there's no sin on your account no sin imputed when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make believe but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you are under the blood and he doesn't see it there's a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you're washed in the blood of the Lamb therefore there's no Gall in you there's no unclean Habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb has did this and God cannot Impe send to you after you've got a sin offering laying there waiting for you well you say that gives me plenty of room then brother Branham I can do what I want to I always do always but when a man can really see what Jesus done for him and turn around and do something contrary to him it shows he never received Christ amen true salvation true Holy Ghost feeling true conversion with the power of God behind it to begin a life of overcoming habits and sin the desire for sin has been purged now when it tries to come in these bodies there's a holy ghost that said I want to keep Purge in my life can you say Amen well you say that gives me plenty of room there but I can do what I want to I cannot I always do I already read that I got a little wife sitting back there she's 10 years younger than me and as gray as I am the reason is because she stood between me and the outside world if I was going overseas and I'd wouldn't this be some sort of a family live in if I'd gather my family around me and I'd say look here Mrs Branham you want to realize that you're Mrs William Branham thou shall not have any other husbands while I'm gone don't you make eyes at any other man and all these things don't you flirt at all if you do when I come back I'm going to divorce you and she'd turn around and say now my good man I want to tell you something also usually going to get response if you say something like this oh my good man I want to tell you something also Thou shalt not take any other woman while you're gone thou shall not do this and that if you do just consider yourself divorced when you come home and wouldn't that be a loving family you see no if I really love her though I believe if I did make a mistake and slip and do something wrong I believe she'd forgive me for it because she loves me and if she did I believe I'd forgive her for it certainly because I love her but if I love her like that as long as I love her like that she has no worry though she would forgive me I wouldn't hurt her for nothing Lord Jesus may we eat the bread of sincerity and Truth unleavened in our lives I'd feel the guiltiest guy in the world I couldn't wait for the minute I'd tell her about what I'd done because I love her well that's if I love her with filial like that how much greater would my agape love be to Jesus Christ though I might smoke a cigarette I never in my life but though I would I he might forgive me for it I believe he would if I took a drink I never in my life but I believe he'd forgive me for it and I love him too much God held me I don't want to do anything like that see because I love him that stuff is gone from me because when he changed me from a crow to a dove it made a difference my appetite and things left me then sin is not imputed to me because I don't aim to do it it's not in me to do it praise the Lord I think that's wonderful can you say Amen let's Stand Together
