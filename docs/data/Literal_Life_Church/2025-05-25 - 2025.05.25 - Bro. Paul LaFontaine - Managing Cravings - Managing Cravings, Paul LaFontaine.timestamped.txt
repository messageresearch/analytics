[28:04] morning. You may be seated. Welcome to
[28:06] the house of the Lord. Welcome all of
[28:08] our visitors this morning. God bless
[28:10] you. I'm going to have my sister Sherry
[28:12] come. And Sharon, if you'd come and
[28:14] Isaac and uh what happens is is if
[28:17] there's nobody planned a special then we
[28:19] sing. So, we're going to sing something
[28:20] this morning. Praise the Lord. I wanted
[28:23] to say though, um just uh just a couple
[28:26] of things. I know that we have some
[28:29] graduates this year and so I thought
[28:30] we'd honor them. We did Wednesday night
[28:32] for Isabelle, but I think Alyssa,
[28:36] you're gra you're graduating this year,
[28:37] Esther Ball. And if I'm missing anybody
[28:40] and Isabelle, and if there's anybody
[28:42] else graduating from high school or from
[28:44] college or from kindergarten,
[28:50] Anybody that's graduating, stand up.
[28:53] We're going to give you a hand. We
[28:55] congratulate you this morning. Stand up.
[28:57] Listen, she's not here.
[29:00] Oh, okay. Okay.
[29:03] God bless you. Congratulations.
[29:06] Awesome. Thank you so much for your hard
[29:08] work in making it to this stage. Praise
[29:11] the Lord. We just encourage you and we
[29:13] just I think a couple years we forgot
[29:15] there. Just wanted to mention that and
[29:17] we appreciate your accomplishments. May
[29:19] God bless you and make sure you get that
[29:20] across to Alyssa if you would. Praise
[29:23] the Lord. Yeah. I also wanted to say
[29:25] that this is Memorial Day and uh
[29:28] tomorrow and it's to honor those who
[29:31] have given their lives for our country
[29:34] and our freedom. And so if any uh of you
[29:37] have a a loved one that's served in
[29:40] that, we appreciate them. We show our
[29:41] appreciation to them and and we just
[29:44] honor them. But there are also some uh
[29:47] vet not not veterans but those who have
[29:49] given their lives for the cross of Jesus
[29:52] Christ and the message of the last days.
[29:54] And I also like to honor them. My dad
[29:57] was one of them. Brother John Lef
[29:58] Fontaine and he gave his life for this
[30:00] last day's message. He died believing it
[30:03] and uh served the Lord through this
[30:05] message his whole life. The Lord Jesus.
[30:08] Um, I might mention brother uh uh Ron
[30:12] Ball, I believe, is another veteran.
[30:16] Brother Gary Denman. I mentioned some
[30:17] that were in our church. Gary Denman was
[30:20] he wasn't even a minister, but he died
[30:22] believing this message with all of his
[30:24] heart. Wanted to mention Cliff Bird. I
[30:28] believe that he should be appreciated
[30:30] for his life on this earth. Believe in
[30:31] the Lord with all of his heart in this
[30:33] message.
[30:34] um William Chandler was one of the first
[30:36] ones in our church and uh helped me
[30:39] start the church and helped start a
[30:41] building fund. And a lot of the reason
[30:42] we saved up enough money to get into a
[30:44] place like this was years ago when
[30:47] brother Chandler had that. He wasn't a
[30:48] minister either, but he sure believed
[30:50] this message and supported me preaching
[30:52] it. And those early days, a lot of you
[30:54] don't know him, but we've had a lot of
[30:56] uh veterans of the gospel of Christ and
[30:58] the message pass away even within our
[31:00] own assembly. Um,
[31:03] Steve Johnson believed this message with
[31:06] all his heart. He's an assistant
[31:07] minister with me here for many years and
[31:10] we appreciate his life and his legacy
[31:12] that he left. Jim Browning, the Hannah
[31:16] are here today from Brother Sam's church
[31:18] and he was another one as well. Praise
[31:20] the Lord for these men. Praise the Lord
[31:22] for these legacies they've left us and
[31:25] we thank God that they believed it with
[31:27] all their heart. Can you say amen?
[31:29] Praise the Lord. Remember, our special
[31:31] meeting is coming up in June. Now, we're
[31:33] starting to announce them. We have a
[31:34] Saturday night meeting. I think it's
[31:36] June 21st. Somebody have to help me out.
[31:38] June 21st, uh 20th, 21st or is that the
[31:41] 19th? Uh we have somebody checked that
[31:45] date for us. They might have a flyer for
[31:47] it. I'm not sure. Brother, uh Brother
[31:50] Diggs will be with us Saturday night at
[31:52] 6. And then brother Hol Lori, if you
[31:54] haven't heard him, he'll be a blessing.
[31:56] Uh, and then we'll have Sunday night
[31:58] with brother Diggs again on Sunday night
[32:00] for the Tri-State Youth Meeting. Looking
[32:01] forward to our special meetings. What
[32:03] are we going to sing you guys?

[34:10] And I'll admit, there's been a few,
[34:15] but in the midst of trouble, that's when
[34:19] his love holds true. Amen. Yes. And if
[34:23] I'll just keep trusting,
[34:27] I'll see the light of day. Yes.
[34:32] See, it's all part of walking. Yes. This
[34:37] goel way.

[36:33] Everything after a while just seems the
[36:35] same.
[36:38] So it's time to be up and going. I can

[37:06] I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove
[37:08] that I'm ready to move.

[40:59] Hallelujah.
[41:02] Blessed be his name. Looking forward to
[41:04] that soon approaching day. And every day
[41:08] that passes by puts us one day closer to
[41:10] it. Can you say amen? Praise the Lord.
[41:13] If you'd turn with me this morning to
[41:14] Psalms 27, we'll read the scripture
[41:16] together. We appreciate you being in
[41:18] fellowship with us today and we trust
[41:20] that we can be anointed from the throne
[41:23] of God to say something that will
[41:25] encourage you, strengthen you, might
[41:27] even correct you a bit. But whatever he
[41:29] has for us, it'll be for our good. And
[41:32] we pray that the Lord will bless the
[41:33] word this morning and bless the weekend
[41:35] that you have maybe with your family and
[41:37] Memorial Day tomorrow you have off work.
[41:39] And so I trust you're looking forward to
[41:41] the time together. Psalms 27.
[41:44] And this is the chapter we've been
[41:46] reading out of once again. And so Psalms
[41:49] 27 and I just want to emphasize just
[41:52] verse four and verse five this morning.
[41:56] One thing David says, "One thing have I
[41:59] desired of the Lord, and that will I
[42:02] seek after." I want to focus on that
[42:05] that little sentence there, that
[42:06] beginning of the sentence that David
[42:08] said, "One thing have I desired of the
[42:11] Lord." Isn't it amazing that a man of
[42:14] God can come down to one most important
[42:18] one desire? There's only one desire that
[42:21] I have. How many would like to say, I'd
[42:24] like to get my life to that. That really
[42:26] at the end of everything, I really have
[42:28] one desire.
[42:31] Kind of simplifies life, doesn't it? We
[42:34] have a lot of desires. We got a lot of
[42:35] things we want to do, a lot of things we
[42:37] want to accomplish. But this is when a
[42:39] man is growing in the Lord. You know,
[42:41] you know what? He's he's hit this spot
[42:44] where he says, "One thing have I
[42:46] desired. One thing." And there's no
[42:49] Calvary yet.
[42:51] This is before the New Testament. This
[42:53] is the Old. There's no Holy Ghost yet.
[42:55] And yet he says, "I desire this." And
[42:58] this is what he desires. One thing I've
[43:00] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[43:02] after that I may dwell in the house of
[43:05] the Lord all the days of my life to
[43:08] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[43:11] inquire in his temple. That's amazing.
[43:15] Remember David's the one now who always
[43:18] talked about how much he enjoyed coming
[43:20] to the house of the Lord. He said one
[43:23] place, I was glad when they said unto
[43:25] me, let us go to the house of the Lord.
[43:28] And if you're not there, you ought to
[43:30] pray that you get there. Amen. I was
[43:33] glad when they said unto me. He said, a
[43:36] day in thy courts is better than a
[43:38] thousand.
[43:40] There was something about David that he
[43:42] loved to be at the house of God. But I
[43:45] want to say it wasn't because of the
[43:47] building. It wasn't because of the
[43:49] temple. He gives why he wants to be
[43:52] there. He said that I may dwell in the
[43:54] house of the Lord all the days of my
[43:56] life to behold the beauty of the Lord.
[43:58] You know what? It's not about the
[44:00] building. It's about who's there. That's
[44:02] right.
[44:04] And the revelation already before
[44:06] Calvary and and before the Holy Ghost is
[44:08] that when I go, there's a presence
[44:10] there. There's a person there. The
[44:12] message had become a person to David and
[44:15] not a building.
[44:18] Going to church had be become about a
[44:21] person, the Lord. I want to go. One
[44:24] place he says, I'd rather be a
[44:26] doorkeeper in the house of God. And he
[44:29] was a king. He could have come in as a
[44:31] king. He could had a position, but David
[44:33] did not go to the Lord's house to have a
[44:35] position. There's a lot of people
[44:36] they're they're itching. They want a
[44:38] position to, but David said, "If I don't
[44:40] have a position or if I take the lowest
[44:42] position as a doorkeeper in the house of
[44:45] God, I just want to do something so that
[44:48] I can be at his house." Amen. It's not
[44:51] about position. I want to thank my staff
[44:54] and the video and audio and all these
[44:57] guys that help me every
[44:59] service. And you know what I like about
[45:02] them? They don't come to church because
[45:04] they do this position. They come for the
[45:07] word. You know how I know? You look at
[45:10] Steve Laughlin back there with that
[45:12] camera running around. And you look at
[45:14] uh the hullingers up there and you look
[45:15] at audio guys. Every once in a while
[45:17] you'll hear out a big amen from back
[45:20] there or they're up there worshiping and
[45:22] raising their hands, praising the Lord,
[45:24] taking their hands off the camera a
[45:26] little bit. I love that because I know
[45:29] they don't come to church for cameras
[45:32] and audio. We can have church with all
[45:34] without any of that. That's right. But
[45:36] to help other people see it and view it,
[45:38] we appreciate that. But they're not here
[45:40] for a position. Can you say amen?
[45:42] Brother Steve Laughlin, he he uprooted
[45:45] from Tucson and came. He listened to
[45:47] these services a year or maybe a
[45:48] two-year every service. Went back and
[45:50] listened to the past ones. He's not here
[45:52] for any place or position. He came for
[45:54] the word of God. He came for his family
[45:57] for the word and many of them staff and
[45:59] I just I don't thank them enough. Would
[46:01] you thank our staff that helps in the
[46:03] service? Would you thank them this
[46:04] morning? God bless you all.
[46:10] It's a privilege to work with people
[46:12] like this. That's for sure. But David,
[46:15] he didn't come for a position. He loved
[46:17] to be here, but it wasn't because of a
[46:19] church or a building.
[46:21] It wasn't because to see anybody else
[46:23] and what they wore. He he he met the
[46:26] person
[46:28] and where this is how there's one desire
[46:31] I have. Wherever that person of the Lord
[46:33] is, that's where I want to be all the
[46:37] days of my life. He's probably yelling
[46:39] saying, "I wish we had church every
[46:41] day."
[46:44] He wanted to be there and he just not
[46:46] only wanted to be there with him, he
[46:48] wanted to behold his beauty so that it
[46:51] would change him. Can you say amen?
[46:53] Lord, bless your word. Bless these
[46:56] precious lives that have come. Lord, you
[46:58] have a way to find us wherever we're at
[47:01] and lift us. Lord, you have a way of
[47:04] grace, Lord, that even though you would
[47:06] be sometimes corrective, even that is
[47:08] love, Lord, because it's it's reaching
[47:11] where we're at and drawing us h up
[47:13] higher, Lord. And I pray you'll be
[47:15] mindful of that this morning as I have
[47:18] looked to you, Father, for your word,
[47:20] for your people,
[47:22] God. Even u praying in this sanctuary
[47:25] last night, praying for every every pew,
[47:29] every person that would sit here that
[47:31] you would affect them, Lord, with the
[47:34] glory of God. It goes beyond me or the
[47:37] pastor or any church building. it goes
[47:39] when when you're here, Lord, you can do
[47:42] wonderful things and supernatural
[47:44] things. We invite you to do that this
[47:46] morning. We pray that you would swing
[47:49] through this place, Lord, and fill us
[47:51] and feed us and teach us, Lord. God, I
[47:54] pray that you would grab someone if
[47:55] they're in the miry clay, if they're
[47:57] under condemnation, if they're feeling
[47:59] the the the condemnation of sin, I pray
[48:02] you'll draw them out of it, Lord. And
[48:04] may they recognize what your blood has
[48:06] done for them. I pray God may your Holy
[48:08] Ghost have control and we commit each
[48:10] word to you in Jesus name we ask it.
[48:13] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:19] We gave a little Christmas gift to all
[48:21] of you uh as we try to do each Christmas
[48:23] and the gift this past year was a little
[48:26] plaque that had the theme scripture for
[48:28] this year that I wanted to elaborate on.
[48:30] And not every service is related, but
[48:32] most of them are. And that scripture
[48:34] came out of Psalms 27 here. And it was
[48:37] specifically the one that says in verse
[48:39] 5, and uh I appreciate every home I go
[48:42] into, you have it on the wall or you
[48:43] have it there. We have it. For in the
[48:45] time of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[48:48] pavilion. In the secret of his
[48:50] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[48:53] set me up upon the rock. And those that
[48:56] know the message know that this is the
[48:57] text that he read when he was preaching
[48:59] the rapture. So this secret place and
[49:02] this scripture is related to the times
[49:05] we live in. And uh I work I have worked
[49:08] my way through this year in some
[49:10] messages taking the time of trouble
[49:12] because in the first half of the year
[49:15] and we're already through half the year
[49:17] there were many related subjects to talk
[49:20] about the conditions of pre-tribulation
[49:22] and the conditions of pre-rapture and
[49:25] the unique pressures that we're facing
[49:27] every day. And I guarantee you they are
[49:29] unique pressures only to this time and
[49:32] this age. When that Bible says the time
[49:35] of trouble, it's not talking about
[49:36] Luther's day. It's not talking about the
[49:38] early church. It's talking about your
[49:40] time that you live in. It's mentioned in
[49:42] the book of Daniel. It's mentioned in
[49:44] other chapters in the Bible. The time of
[49:46] trouble is a pre-tribulation and then
[49:49] also can enter into tribulation as well.
[49:51] But we elaborated many things on the
[49:53] time of trouble. So that you know that
[49:55] without a doubt, no generation has ever
[49:58] seen these type of pressures. No
[50:01] generation has ever seen the type of
[50:03] trouble that we face every day and the
[50:06] demonic attacks on God's people. There
[50:09] is no age that's ever had it quite like
[50:12] this. And that's why he called it the
[50:14] time of trouble. All generations have
[50:16] had trouble, but there's been no trouble
[50:19] like the trouble that we face every day.
[50:21] Every demon in hell is against a
[50:24] Christian standing for truth.
[50:26] Every devil in hell has its guns pointed
[50:29] at anybody, any young person, anybody
[50:32] who tries to take a stand for the
[50:34] message of Christ for the last days.
[50:36] Every gun is trained on you. Can you say
[50:38] amen? There is demonic forces and mind
[50:41] battles. There is depression. There is
[50:43] uh confusion. There's and we elaborate
[50:45] on these things. The the mind and the
[50:47] spirit being confused and being tossed
[50:50] about. And it's not only unbelievers
[50:52] that face that. It's believers as well.
[50:54] There's great mind battles. There's
[50:56] great pressures that go with this age.
[50:58] And this generation has uh is seeing the
[51:02] type of trouble and demonic force that's
[51:04] never been seen before. And uh to be
[51:06] honest with you, I'm still pulled
[51:08] sometimes uh to continue to preach the
[51:12] subtle traps that are in our day because
[51:14] they're not traps that were in Luther's
[51:16] day or Wesley's day or during the the
[51:19] dark ages. They had different pressures.
[51:21] They had different temptations. uh that
[51:24] if they stood for Christ, they could
[51:25] have their head cut off. Uh it was
[51:27] different a different type of pressure.
[51:29] Today, they won't cut your head off, but
[51:31] Satan would try to confuse your mind.
[51:34] Satan will try to bring doubts in your
[51:35] mind. Satan will make you doubt your
[51:37] salvation, doubt that you have the Holy
[51:39] Ghost. Satan will take a mistake that
[51:42] you've made and even though you brought
[51:44] it under the blood, Satan can still try
[51:46] to use it to keep you defeated. And this
[51:49] is the type of enemy we face. And so I
[51:51] feel pulled to continue to talk about
[51:54] such subtle traps that we have today to
[51:56] hold these last days pressures in front
[51:59] of you and uh and and and and to bear
[52:02] through uh the added pressure that's on
[52:05] a preacher like myself. If I hold these
[52:08] things in front of you, uh quite often I
[52:10] become the bad guy who's exposing things
[52:13] in our lives that the devil's using to
[52:15] defeat us. Quite often I become the bad
[52:17] guy. And I don't like being the bad to
[52:19] be honest with you. I don't like being
[52:20] the bad guy, but somebody has to speak
[52:23] truth. That's right. Somebody has to be
[52:26] willing. Sometimes people look at you as
[52:28] the bad guy, but you see now we have to
[52:30] look at it the right way. But I'm
[52:31] willing to do that. I actually am is am
[52:34] dedicated. I'm called to God not to get
[52:37] up here and tell you what you want to
[52:38] hear, but to proclaim truth, whether it
[52:41] encourages, convicts, whatever it does,
[52:43] I've got to speak it all. I've got to
[52:45] say what God told me to say. And I have
[52:48] a responsibility to do that. But it
[52:49] doesn't make you too uh popular.
[52:52] Sometimes it's not a pleasant position.
[52:54] Uh pray for me. And the reason that I
[52:57] make it is because I have a lot of
[52:59] people praying for me. But it is not a
[53:01] pleasant position to point out all the
[53:04] conditions of evil of this hour and the
[53:07] traps that come to believers lives even.
[53:09] It is not an e easy place. And I find
[53:12] that I'm a bit safer to talk about
[53:14] things like worldly events and world
[53:16] events and political events coming
[53:18] together, prophecy. Uh it's it's a lot
[53:21] more comfortable. I get more response
[53:23] back when I talk about everything going
[53:25] on out there. But when I deal with heart
[53:28] issues in here,
[53:30] I get less response. Isn't that
[53:32] interesting? Less compliments because it
[53:35] gets a little too close to home. But I
[53:38] can talk about the Pope and I can talk
[53:40] about political events and I can talk
[53:42] about Trump and watching all these
[53:44] things come together in the last days,
[53:46] but I find I'm not quite as popular when
[53:49] I talk about hard issues
[53:52] gets quiet like it is right now.
[53:55] But I'm determined to speak what God
[53:58] gives us to help us in this hour. And
[54:00] there are so many things uh that we
[54:03] could speak about. But you see now um as
[54:06] we come to this we we we want to uh move
[54:09] on from those scriptures of the time of
[54:11] trouble and I'm sure more things will
[54:13] come up but I want to move into the
[54:15] scripture into the next spot here and
[54:17] and to be able to speak about this next
[54:19] part uh which speaks about what his
[54:22] answer is to this uh we can have uh you
[54:26] know uh this he speaks of a place you
[54:30] know he actually gives the answer for
[54:32] all of this pressure and last Sunday, I
[54:34] broke down Psalms 27 and talked about
[54:36] all the things similar to this age that
[54:39] we're going through. And I trust that
[54:40] was a blessing to you. But God's answer
[54:43] was not that we fight against all the uh
[54:46] politics or fight against things. God's
[54:49] answer to this age was he said, "I'm
[54:51] going to hide you in my pavilion."
[54:55] We wouldn't think that's an answer, but
[54:57] that's God's answer. Often we try to
[55:00] find our own answers. But God's answer
[55:03] to the pressure, the depression, the
[55:06] mental instability. God's answer is that
[55:09] I have a place for you of rest. I have a
[55:15] pavilion. I have a secret. And the very
[55:18] reason he names it secret is that it's
[55:20] not for everybody, but it's for my
[55:23] people so they can come into a place of
[55:26] rest and peace. kind of like a
[55:27] pre-rapture condition. Can you say amen?
[55:30] I have a place of protection. A pavilion
[55:32] is a place of protection. And as we get
[55:35] along studying that, we'll see a
[55:36] pavilion can also be a royal pavilion.
[55:39] And a royal pavilion is a place where
[55:42] the royal soldiers are given a special
[55:44] place to come back and re refresh
[55:46] themselves from battle and to be able to
[55:49] get in that protective pavilion. I
[55:51] believe God's provided provided not just
[55:53] a pavilion, but a royal pavilion.
[55:56] Praise the Lord. It's a place of
[55:58] protection. It's a place of release and
[56:00] refreshment. It's a place of peace. It's
[56:03] a place of stability. It's a place
[56:05] that's insulated from us crashing like
[56:09] the rest of the world. Can you say amen?
[56:12] It's a temporary holding place above our
[56:15] enemies and above our fears. It's a safe
[56:19] bomb shelter from Satan's bombs and
[56:22] missiles that he shoots at us. Satan can
[56:25] buzz around, but he can't really
[56:27] completely get to you like he couldn't
[56:29] get to Job. He wanted to get him. He
[56:32] said, "You can mess with his entire
[56:33] life, his emotions, everything you want
[56:35] to, but you'll never take his soul. I've
[56:38] got confidence in his soul." Now,
[56:39] friends, if God had confidence in Job to
[56:42] say to Satan, "Go ahead, do what you
[56:44] want to to him." If he had confidence in
[56:47] Job before the Holy Ghost, before
[56:50] Calvary, then I believe he's got
[56:52] confidence in what he's deposited in
[56:54] your life.
[56:56] That it's going to weather the storm.
[56:58] Satan, go ahead. I got my grandson Titus
[57:02] preaching with me this morning.
[57:05] Praise the Lord.
[57:08] God has confidence in what he places
[57:10] within us. God has confidence and Satan
[57:13] can buzz around. But the answer is I'm
[57:16] going to give you a hiding place. I'm
[57:18] going to put you in a place of
[57:19] protection. In the next few weeks, the
[57:21] Lord willing, we'll go into what that
[57:23] means, that hiding place, what it means,
[57:25] all the wonderful things. Been listening
[57:27] to the messages and listen all the
[57:28] things leading up to that. And so, we're
[57:30] we're looking at some wonderful things.
[57:32] Uh it's so wonderful. He says, you know,
[57:35] a man can live so hidden in Christ that
[57:39] the devil doesn't know how to get to
[57:41] him. That's right. That's a pretty
[57:44] powerful place to live. He doesn't know
[57:46] how to affect us as much as he affecting
[57:48] the rest of the world. We're emotional,
[57:50] we're going to be affected by some
[57:51] things, but he's got a place that the
[57:53] devil, he said, he be so hidden and all
[57:56] of his channels cleaned out. There's not
[57:58] a place for the devil could to get in
[58:00] because it's been blown out by the Holy
[58:02] Spirit. and all those channels are
[58:05] cleaned up, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[58:07] Can I get an amen this morning?
[58:11] God has a place that he's provided. But
[58:15] before we go into that in the next few
[58:17] weeks, the Lord willing, I can't skip
[58:20] over verse four and verse five in this
[58:24] rapture chapter. And that's the text we
[58:27] read when David said, "One thing have I
[58:30] desired."
[58:32] and that's to dwell in his house, in his
[58:36] presence every day of my life.
[58:41] And if that's the rapture chapter and
[58:43] that's what David gives is the answer
[58:46] from God, if that's David's desire, it
[58:51] ought to be our one desire.
[58:54] Not just on Sundays, but every day.
[59:00] And I I think it's interesting that God
[59:03] gives this hiding place. Listen now. God
[59:07] gives this place for us.
[59:10] But then David
[59:12] desires it.
[59:14] God gives us one place of protection to
[59:17] be in today. And David has one desire to
[59:20] be in there. I believe that it's not
[59:23] going to work if just God provides what
[59:25] we need in this hour. We have to desire
[59:28] it.
[59:31] God, help us that it' be the same
[59:34] testimony. One thing have I desired
[59:38] above money, above retirement,
[59:41] above that new truck.
[59:43] I'm hitting you, brothers.
[59:47] Above that new house, above all these
[59:49] other things. No, no, no. It all fades
[59:52] away. And you can't even trust family
[59:54] sometimes. Oh, don't put all your eggs
[59:57] in one basket in your family. They'll
[59:58] disappoint you.
[1:00:01] If I can just have my family and you
[1:00:02] hang tightly onto the family, sometimes
[1:00:04] they won't always be there for you. But
[1:00:06] I can tell you a presence that will
[1:00:08] always be there for you.
[1:00:11] You can't hang tightly onto anything in
[1:00:13] this life except what God has provided.
[1:00:16] And so now if God gives you one place
[1:00:18] and one answer and one I I I want to
[1:00:22] call it a spiritual place but I don't
[1:00:24] want to overspiritualize it but he's
[1:00:26] provided this position this place that
[1:00:28] you can come into in Christ and they
[1:00:31] provided that one place. It's the one
[1:00:33] answer for all of the trouble of this
[1:00:35] generation. Then we ought to have one
[1:00:37] desire above all desires and that is I
[1:00:40] want to live in that place.
[1:00:43] One thing have I desired. His desires
[1:00:46] were in line with the place that God
[1:00:49] provided. It would do no good if God
[1:00:52] provided a secret place if we did not
[1:00:55] have passion to be in there. Amen. If we
[1:00:59] didn't want it above everything else.
[1:01:01] Just the simplicity of all this one
[1:01:04] place for us to be.
[1:01:06] I just have been thinking about how in
[1:01:09] Leodysia in our time we live in we have
[1:01:12] so many avenues to run to for answers
[1:01:16] for help and I never mock mock medicine
[1:01:20] because I believe I thank the Lord for
[1:01:22] God providing the medicines we have but
[1:01:25] we have so you do realize we have more
[1:01:27] medicines than ever and more sick people
[1:01:29] than ever so that wasn't totally the
[1:01:32] answer but you see now we have so many
[1:01:36] avenues to run to. We have so many
[1:01:38] places. We have so many things to
[1:01:40] fulfill our desires. And if by the help
[1:01:42] of the Lord, I just want to step back
[1:01:44] and talk about our desires this morning.
[1:01:46] Because it's important that we go to the
[1:01:48] level of our desires than just the
[1:01:51] surface of what our mind wants. What's
[1:01:53] our desires on the inside? Because if
[1:01:55] God gets to the heart of your desires
[1:01:58] and you hone in on this type of
[1:02:00] simplicity to say, "Really, God, I want
[1:02:02] to let you know there's only one desire
[1:02:04] that I have in life, and that's to be
[1:02:06] closer to you and to be where you are."
[1:02:09] It simplifies it.
[1:02:12] Having too many choices like we have in
[1:02:14] Leodysia actually brings confusion.
[1:02:19] That's right.
[1:02:20] This place is mentioned, this phrase is
[1:02:23] mentioned in other places in scripture.
[1:02:25] And uh it's I'll say it first. It was
[1:02:27] mentioned to the rich young ruler when
[1:02:29] he come to him for eternal life. Come to
[1:02:31] Christ. And Jesus said, "You have you
[1:02:33] done the commandments?" He said, "Yes,
[1:02:34] I've done all those things since I was a
[1:02:36] young boy. I've done all that, but I'm
[1:02:37] still I'm still hungering for something.
[1:02:39] I'm still looking for something." He was
[1:02:41] wanting the person of eternal life. And
[1:02:42] he was standing right in front of them
[1:02:44] in front of him. And he says, "Come and
[1:02:46] follow me." And he says, "I want I've
[1:02:48] done all these things right. I've been a
[1:02:49] good boy, but I'm still lacking the the
[1:02:52] the Holy Ghost in my life. That's right.
[1:02:55] You can have everything and still
[1:02:56] there's a hunger for something real in
[1:02:58] God. And you have to want that with a
[1:03:01] great passion. I want it more than any
[1:03:04] other thing in life. And so, uh, he said
[1:03:07] to him though, he said, "One thing," he
[1:03:10] uses the same phrase, "One thing that
[1:03:12] you should do." So, now he simplifies it
[1:03:14] because we're always looking for a list
[1:03:16] of stuff to do. Yeah.
[1:03:19] How do I get from point A from point B?
[1:03:22] Because our bosses will tell us that or
[1:03:24] we're taught in class in order to get to
[1:03:26] this degree. You got this semester, this
[1:03:28] semester. And you know, when I looked at
[1:03:30] that three years that four years that I
[1:03:32] have, it was overwhelming for me. I felt
[1:03:35] like bailing out cuz everything we do,
[1:03:37] we got a list. In order to get to that,
[1:03:39] you got this and this and you got to do
[1:03:41] this. You know what? The way some people
[1:03:43] look at church and look at this message,
[1:03:46] they look at as I got this whole thing
[1:03:48] to go through, including what I wear in
[1:03:51] order to get to Christ. I want to tell
[1:03:53] you that's not true.
[1:03:57] God hasn't provided a list for us. God's
[1:04:01] asked for a surrender. That's it,
[1:04:03] brother. And people don't come and they
[1:04:06] quit coming because they're going
[1:04:07] through their minds and they're
[1:04:08] figuring, I'm going to have to do this.
[1:04:10] I'm going to have to give up this. I'm
[1:04:11] gonna have to give up this and so it's
[1:04:13] just it's too overwhelming. I can't do
[1:04:15] it. I can't do it. And the very fact
[1:04:16] you're saying I can't do it. That's a
[1:04:18] good statement. Can I get an amen?
[1:04:21] That's a good that if you really believe
[1:04:22] that you can't do it. You can't do it by
[1:04:26] yourself. You can't measure up measure
[1:04:28] up. You can never be good enough on the
[1:04:30] outside to make it into the grace of
[1:04:32] God. That's not how he set this up. But
[1:04:35] we have a whole list and I have to give
[1:04:37] this up. And most of the time people are
[1:04:39] looking more to what they have to give
[1:04:41] up than what they get. Can I get an
[1:04:44] amen? Amen. This is overwhelming. I go,
[1:04:48] I can't take this. I'm out of here. This
[1:04:49] is too much. Especially if they grew up
[1:04:51] in the message and they know about the
[1:04:53] truth and they got this whole they've
[1:04:54] made a list. God hasn't made a list, but
[1:04:56] they've made a list, right? And they get
[1:04:59] overwhelmed by it. But you see now when
[1:05:01] he spoke to the rich young ruler, he
[1:05:03] honed in on one thing that would be more
[1:05:06] important than eternal life.
[1:05:08] He asked him, "Did you do the
[1:05:10] commandments?" But that wasn't the real
[1:05:11] big issue he found. And the only reason
[1:05:14] Jesus is saying, "I'm going to put my
[1:05:16] finger on the one place in your life
[1:05:17] that's more important, and that's all
[1:05:18] the riches you have." Because he know in
[1:05:20] his heart that's more important to you
[1:05:22] than eternal life. Even though he's
[1:05:24] saying, "I want eternal life. I want
[1:05:25] eternal life." Okay. one thing you must
[1:05:28] do. Go sell everything that you have and
[1:05:31] give it to the poor.
[1:05:33] I don't know how many minutes or hours
[1:05:35] he stood there and thought that through,
[1:05:38] but he turned it down. Now, a lot of
[1:05:41] people say, "That's mean. That's me.
[1:05:42] That wasn't mean." The rich ruler is the
[1:05:44] one that's asking for eternal life. He's
[1:05:47] the one standing in front and found
[1:05:48] Jesus and asked. He asked. But you see,
[1:05:51] if we're not willing to give up
[1:05:53] sometimes the one thing, then we can't
[1:05:56] come to the simplicity of the one thing
[1:05:58] that God's going to give us. It's not
[1:06:01] complicated.
[1:06:03] It's not a sign. If I could just see a
[1:06:06] sign.
[1:06:08] It's not a sign. It's a surrender.
[1:06:12] Amen. Just Lord, here I am. That's
[1:06:16] right. I don't know how to do all this.
[1:06:18] Amen. But I do know this. I don't want
[1:06:21] the world anymore. I don't want to play
[1:06:23] around anymore. I want you. And if you
[1:06:26] can hone in to my one desire is to be
[1:06:29] where you're at so you can change me.
[1:06:31] That's all God needs.
[1:06:35] Let him change you. Yes. Because there's
[1:06:39] things you can't change
[1:06:41] that only he can change. That's right.
[1:06:44] So, he's going to have to do it.
[1:06:47] Another place he mentions just one thing
[1:06:49] thou needest. One thing, I just love
[1:06:52] these little statements. Just one thing.
[1:06:53] It simplifies it.
[1:06:56] He says to Mary and Martha, Martha's
[1:06:58] running around in her duty busy for the
[1:07:01] master. Mary's Mary's sitting there
[1:07:03] doing nothing. And Martha's criticizing
[1:07:06] her doing it. He said, Martha, you're
[1:07:08] missing it. One thing you thou needest
[1:07:11] and Mary's chosen it just to sit at his
[1:07:15] feet.
[1:07:21] Maybe I just need to get off of my notes
[1:07:24] this morning and talk about how busy we
[1:07:28] are.
[1:07:31] That's right. And we won't take a break
[1:07:33] from it. We're in the rat race. We're
[1:07:35] going. We're going. We're going.
[1:07:38] Then when we relax, we go to something
[1:07:40] and pour our lives into something so it
[1:07:42] can entertain our mind because we're
[1:07:44] scared of just sitting and meditating or
[1:07:46] reading our Bibles or just talking to
[1:07:49] the Lord.
[1:07:51] We are busy. You know about I was
[1:07:54] telling this to Brandon in the office,
[1:07:55] brother Brandon 25 years ago, I wrote a
[1:07:58] song called Lord, you're the center of
[1:08:01] my life. And I begin the verse. The Lord
[1:08:03] gave me the verse and it says first
[1:08:05] line, "It seems I have a million things
[1:08:08] to do." Anybody know that song? It seems
[1:08:12] I have, now this is 25 years ago and I'm
[1:08:14] feeling this, Lord. It seems I have a
[1:08:17] million things to do. Everything gets
[1:08:19] placed in front of you. Amen. But Lord,
[1:08:23] it's not my desire to see it go that
[1:08:25] way. That's right. I just told Brandon,
[1:08:27] I said, now 25 years later, I'm going to
[1:08:30] change the words. It seems I have a
[1:08:32] billion things to do.
[1:08:35] Billion. Billion
[1:08:40] because it was a billion back then. Now
[1:08:42] it seems like it's a billion.
[1:08:45] Seems I have a billion things to do.
[1:08:47] Everything gets placed in front of you.
[1:08:48] This is a prayer to the Lord. But Lord,
[1:08:51] it's not my desire to see it go that
[1:08:53] way.
[1:08:57] And so I'll rearrange priorities
[1:09:00] seeking for your will down on my knees.
[1:09:07] It starts with a desire
[1:09:09] and then a change to say, "Lord, now
[1:09:12] take that desire and may it be willing
[1:09:16] to give up what's in the way of you."
[1:09:19] That's right.
[1:09:21] So I can be in that secret place with
[1:09:23] him more often so I can find the peace
[1:09:27] that the world's trying to provide to
[1:09:29] me. And Jesus did refer to peace I give
[1:09:32] you. He says not as the world gives. And
[1:09:34] that tells us the world offers a peace.
[1:09:37] True. He said, "But I give you peace,
[1:09:39] not like the world offers, but I give
[1:09:40] you peace." And we seek the peace of God
[1:09:43] when we look for this secret place. But
[1:09:45] it's simple. One place for us to be, one
[1:09:47] desire to get there. It's not
[1:09:49] complicated. It is only, it only is
[1:09:52] because we or Satan have filled our
[1:09:54] lives with every other thing that's more
[1:09:57] important. I'm sure all of us could
[1:09:59] agree together today that there's
[1:10:01] something in David that he's saying
[1:10:03] here. One thing have I desired. I I
[1:10:06] would say we all agree that we need this
[1:10:09] desire in our hearts if we have it to
[1:10:12] become the paramount thing in our lives
[1:10:15] to be in that place with him to be where
[1:10:17] he's at.
[1:10:19] So, I'm asking the Lord to help me for a
[1:10:21] few minutes this morning. I won't be
[1:10:22] long. Uh me and the young brother there
[1:10:24] in the bathroom, a young boy. I don't
[1:10:26] remember where he's at. I wouldn't
[1:10:28] embarrass him, but I said, "You want me
[1:10:30] to preach short today." He said
[1:10:33] kind of a scared him a little bit.
[1:10:37] I asked him because when I asked my
[1:10:38] wife, she just laughs. I think I'm going
[1:10:40] to preach short today. And she just kind
[1:10:42] of chuckles.
[1:10:44] I asked him and he said, "Yeah, man. If
[1:10:46] you could keep it down a little bit,
[1:10:49] I've got some I got some things to do."
[1:10:51] I said, "Well, what's more important
[1:10:52] than this?" Oh, he said, "No, this is
[1:10:54] most important. This is more important."
[1:10:56] Hey, at least the boy was honest. He
[1:10:58] told the preacher, "Keep it short.
[1:11:02] I like honesty."
[1:11:05] But I asked the Lord to help me to speak
[1:11:07] about our desires this morning a little
[1:11:09] bit. David says just one thing, and I'm
[1:11:12] just amazed. I'm intrigued, even a bit
[1:11:14] convicted at David saying that. What
[1:11:16] level has David reached that has brought
[1:11:18] him to say, "I really only have one
[1:11:21] desire left." And I imagine maybe I
[1:11:23] didn't check his age here in uh Psalms
[1:11:25] 27, but I I imagine as he's grown older,
[1:11:29] uh he begins to realize that. I know for
[1:11:31] me, you realize what's important in
[1:11:33] life. As you get older, uh when you're
[1:11:35] young, you think you know what's
[1:11:36] important. You put other priorities
[1:11:38] above the Lord and things. I don't think
[1:11:40] young people should should do that. If
[1:11:42] you can catch this revelation young that
[1:11:44] God must be the most important thing in
[1:11:46] your life and the the hunger for the
[1:11:48] Holy Ghost, the filling should be the
[1:11:50] most important thing in your life. Every
[1:11:52] other thing is as we say into the youth
[1:11:54] on Friday night is ice cream on the
[1:11:56] cake. Jesus said, "Seek ye first the
[1:11:57] kingdom of God and all these things will
[1:12:00] be added unto you." You can't imagine
[1:12:02] how God will bless your life with all
[1:12:04] the desires that you have if you put his
[1:12:07] desire first.
[1:12:09] You can't imagine. There's just no way
[1:12:11] to describe it. That's the channel God
[1:12:13] said to come through. So you you you
[1:12:15] just feel David, what level has David
[1:12:17] reached when he maybe he got older, but
[1:12:19] he said, "One thing have I desired and
[1:12:22] one thing am I going to seek after, and
[1:12:25] that's to be in your house every day and
[1:12:27] to behold your beauty. One thing." We
[1:12:30] human beings are built with so many
[1:12:33] desires within us. Some of them are in
[1:12:35] bread. Some of their are things that God
[1:12:38] gave us. We have physical desires. We
[1:12:41] have emotional desires. We have needs.
[1:12:44] We are a needy people. Some of these
[1:12:46] things we develop from the world, but
[1:12:48] some are uh cravings and thirst. Brother
[1:12:51] Brandham called them thirst. Uh we have
[1:12:54] these cravings within us. And they're
[1:12:55] not all spiritual. We have physical
[1:12:58] needs to eat, to sleep. We have then
[1:13:00] emotional needs to have friends. And all
[1:13:03] these things are uh we have a thirst for
[1:13:05] fellowship. And that's a god-given
[1:13:07] thirst. That's not something you got
[1:13:09] from the world. That's pure. A young
[1:13:11] man, young woman has a thirst to to uh
[1:13:14] have marriage and to be in fellowship
[1:13:16] and to have that kind of relationship.
[1:13:18] God put that within you to be with
[1:13:21] someone of the opposite sex and be
[1:13:23] married to them and share your life only
[1:13:25] with them. God put that normal thing in.
[1:13:28] It's Satan who perverts that thirst.
[1:13:31] That's right. Nobody else but Satan. And
[1:13:34] he takes a desire, a pure desire. It's
[1:13:38] not lust to want the other to the
[1:13:41] opposite sex. It's not lust. It's
[1:13:42] something God gave you. But there's a
[1:13:44] way to fulfill it.
[1:13:47] There's a way to fulfill it. And right
[1:13:49] away as young people, Satan jumps in to
[1:13:52] divert that and pervert that and now
[1:13:54] they're with all kinds of partners or
[1:13:56] someone even after they're married. It's
[1:13:57] it's a shame when that happens because
[1:13:59] you're pure. You have it's not lust when
[1:14:02] you desire those things. God gave you
[1:14:04] that, but it becomes lust and it becomes
[1:14:07] perverted because then Satan can bring
[1:14:09] his cloud of condemnation on you.
[1:14:13] You see, so it's not about the desire
[1:14:16] being wrong, it's how you fulfill it.
[1:14:19] Can I talk about desires this morning?
[1:14:21] So you have physical desires, you have
[1:14:23] emotional desires, and then of course
[1:14:25] you have spiritual desires. Every human
[1:14:27] being, I believe, has a soul and has a
[1:14:30] hunger for God, has a hunger to be
[1:14:32] filled by God. But most human beings
[1:14:34] will take even that thirst for God and
[1:14:37] Satan will try to fill that void, that
[1:14:40] vacuum for God with other things.
[1:14:44] And then spiritually, Brother Brham
[1:14:46] called them thirst plural. T H I R S Ts
[1:14:50] plural. It's not just one thirst, it's
[1:14:52] many thirst. On Friday night and talking
[1:14:55] about the young people, talking to the
[1:14:56] young people about the little bit this
[1:14:58] and I was talking to them about managing
[1:15:00] their cravings because they have
[1:15:02] cravings. They have thirst. They have
[1:15:03] needs in their life. And they become
[1:15:05] very prominent when they get uh into
[1:15:08] adolescence and they have these needs.
[1:15:10] They have these feelings and things
[1:15:11] going on and their cravings and their
[1:15:13] god-given cravings. And I I let them
[1:15:15] know my my title tonight is uh managing
[1:15:18] cravings. And I said this is not a
[1:15:20] little devotion on dieting. It's not
[1:15:22] what it is. It's it's more about your
[1:15:25] spiritual and emotional cravings. Uh one
[1:15:28] time we took a few weeks ago managing
[1:15:30] our time because Satan would like to as
[1:15:33] a young person to waste our time. So we
[1:15:35] have to measure our time. We have to
[1:15:37] take a control of our time or Satan will
[1:15:40] fill our time with a bunch of junk. Can
[1:15:42] you say amen? So we need time with the
[1:15:44] Lord. We need to manage our time. Well,
[1:15:46] just like we manage our time, we manage
[1:15:49] our cravings. We must bring our cravings
[1:15:51] and our thirst under control of the Holy
[1:15:53] Ghost. And if we don't manage it, Satan
[1:15:56] will mismanage and Satan will abuse our
[1:16:00] cravings.
[1:16:02] Very true.
[1:16:05] And it and it seems like you see it
[1:16:07] seems like there's a crossover. The
[1:16:10] basic need of course is for food. But
[1:16:13] first of all, people when they need to
[1:16:16] eat then they get hungry enough they'll
[1:16:20] get any kind of food. They'll get in a
[1:16:21] garbage can and get anything. If they
[1:16:23] can't find food, they're going to eat
[1:16:25] out of a garbage can. Well, isn't that
[1:16:27] similar with every thirst that we have?
[1:16:30] If we don't get to the right food, the
[1:16:32] right word for our soul, we'll eat
[1:16:34] anything. We'll get on the internet and
[1:16:36] feed our soul anything. And that's not
[1:16:38] good cuz there's junk food out there.
[1:16:41] Can you say amen? There's junk food out
[1:16:43] there. And so with any need that we have
[1:16:46] when become become so desperate, we'll
[1:16:48] eat out of a garbage can. And then they
[1:16:51] cross over a bit because then you eat
[1:16:53] because uh you it's been proven that you
[1:16:56] you eat a lot or you overeat sometimes
[1:16:59] or you eat the wrong things not because
[1:17:01] you're hungry but because you have
[1:17:03] another emotional need.
[1:17:09] Don't think that I'm going to talk like
[1:17:11] an expert on this. I'm not an expert.
[1:17:13] You wouldn't listen to me anyway. I'm
[1:17:15] not an expert on the dieting thing. But
[1:17:17] I am certainly learning. I told you I'm
[1:17:19] on a journey and I'm learning. And one
[1:17:21] of the things they've said for years and
[1:17:22] we're finally listening is that
[1:17:24] sometimes it's not a food problem. It's
[1:17:27] that it's a it's a crossover. There's
[1:17:28] another emotional need that's not being
[1:17:31] fulfilled and you're trying to fill it
[1:17:34] with food.
[1:17:36] How many's heard that before? You see,
[1:17:38] so if you don't address the emotional
[1:17:40] need, you can be on 50,000 diets. You
[1:17:43] can and and I've been on a lot of them
[1:17:44] myself. You know, the uh I went on a
[1:17:47] 30-day diet one time and I lost a month.
[1:17:53] Trust me, I've seen the diets and I, you
[1:17:56] know, I've been through a lot of them.
[1:17:58] And and you know, I still trying to
[1:18:01] conquer this thing and I will conquer it
[1:18:03] by the grace of God because I told the
[1:18:06] ministers that I have
[1:18:08] donelap disease. My belly dunlapped over
[1:18:11] my belt
[1:18:13] and that's the problem. that's it's a
[1:18:15] disease. But when you start to look at
[1:18:17] this, you see that it can cross over
[1:18:21] into another emotional need. Let me say
[1:18:23] it this way is that when we have
[1:18:26] sometimes problems come in our lives and
[1:18:30] we look at the reason for the problem
[1:18:32] and we look for the answer for the
[1:18:34] problem. But many of the problems boil
[1:18:37] back to some emotional need that's not
[1:18:41] being met or wasn't met early in your
[1:18:43] life.
[1:18:45] And now you still have that need,
[1:18:48] appreciation, significance, a need for
[1:18:51] significance, a desire for significance,
[1:18:53] a desire for approval, a desire for
[1:18:56] praise, a desire for worth. And you have
[1:18:59] that, it wasn't fulfilled. So now you go
[1:19:01] about life trying to fill it other ways
[1:19:03] so you can fill that need. But unless
[1:19:06] you address the need and the real desire
[1:19:08] there, then you see now something else
[1:19:09] can fill its place. So people could eat
[1:19:12] because there's another emotional need.
[1:19:14] And that's true in the spiritual need
[1:19:16] for God. Satan fills other things to
[1:19:18] fill a spir spiritual need and a desire
[1:19:21] and a hunger for God. Can you say amen?
[1:19:25] I'm attracted to Twinkies.
[1:19:28] And one of the I was attracted real
[1:19:30] young to Twinkies because I I was so
[1:19:33] attracted to Twinkies when I was a a
[1:19:35] little boy that it made me steal them.
[1:19:37] It was one of my first sins as me and
[1:19:40] the the neighborhood boys concocted a
[1:19:43] plan as we watched a big uh hostess
[1:19:47] truck come by the back of the shopping
[1:19:50] center in Lima every day. And we begin
[1:19:53] to watch this and we watched it
[1:19:55] together. Every day it comes the same
[1:19:56] time. And and the driver goes inside for
[1:20:00] about a half hour and it was open game.
[1:20:06] Come on people, you should like me. I'm
[1:20:08] confessing one of my first sins to you.
[1:20:12] But I had never went for those Twinkies.
[1:20:13] And we did. And we took a bunch of them.
[1:20:15] And I we went out in the woods and I
[1:20:16] think we ate them all in one shot. Right
[1:20:19] out in the woods. We did it. It's out
[1:20:21] there. I stole Twinkies,
[1:20:24] but that wasn't it so much as as much as
[1:20:26] it I had to have an attraction. I had to
[1:20:30] have something craving that. Right.
[1:20:32] Right. I know that's simple, but I want
[1:20:34] the children to understand is that we
[1:20:36] turn to things sometimes and and we are
[1:20:39] attracted to certain things and we're
[1:20:41] willing in this case to steal steal for
[1:20:44] them and get what we want. And uh so
[1:20:46] today I still look at them and something
[1:20:49] in me says I want something very small
[1:20:52] within I want I want and then I my dear
[1:20:55] precious brother Ryan he's no good for
[1:20:57] me because every few months he brings a
[1:20:59] box of Twinkies in my office cuz he
[1:21:02] knows the Twinkie story. He's not
[1:21:04] helping me at all. I don't eat those. I
[1:21:07] might eat one but I don't eat all of
[1:21:09] them. I hand them out to the other kids.
[1:21:12] If I have a want today, it's a very
[1:21:14] small want. But guess what? It's not a
[1:21:17] want. It's it's not a need. It's a want.
[1:21:21] It's not a need. So now, I know this is
[1:21:24] real simple, but you look at this and
[1:21:25] you say, I'm trying to get you to look
[1:21:27] at the depths of your desires, right?
[1:21:30] That we want something, but what is it
[1:21:33] that we really need? Right?
[1:21:38] How many times do we make choices
[1:21:40] because we we want something but we
[1:21:44] don't really spiritually need it. But
[1:21:47] because we want it, we go get it. Now,
[1:21:50] David come down. There's one thing I
[1:21:52] desire. He honed in as just one thing I
[1:21:54] desire. But David, remember David was a
[1:21:57] man. He had many desires. He he had many
[1:22:00] things to accomplish in his kingdom. And
[1:22:02] yet he could come down to one desire.
[1:22:03] Matter of fact, some of David's desires
[1:22:06] were not that great. He actually made
[1:22:09] mistakes with some of his desires.
[1:22:11] That's right. And you know about his
[1:22:13] mistakes. They're not hidden in the
[1:22:14] Bible. And he went and committed
[1:22:16] adultery with Basheba out of what?
[1:22:19] Starting with a desire, but a desire
[1:22:21] became perverted.
[1:22:22] He wasn't happy with his own situation.
[1:22:25] And so he went to someone else. And so
[1:22:27] now we find David after going through
[1:22:30] all those things, he must have come to a
[1:22:32] place that through all that, God's
[1:22:34] forgiven me. Psalms 51 is where he
[1:22:36] repents. God forgives him. God washes it
[1:22:39] away. But through these mistakes, you
[1:22:41] learn something. And you should learn
[1:22:43] about your desires.
[1:22:46] You should learn that I better bring my
[1:22:48] desires and keep them pure under the
[1:22:51] Holy Ghost because Satan can manipulate
[1:22:55] and abuse pure desires
[1:22:59] and he does it so he can get you to sin
[1:23:01] and keep condemnation on you for the
[1:23:03] rest of your life. He loves to do that
[1:23:04] especially to believers. But you see now
[1:23:06] if we would get the upper edge on the
[1:23:08] enemy and realize listen God has given
[1:23:10] me some desires here. I am not going to
[1:23:12] take them through the channel Satan is
[1:23:14] perverting to take them. These are
[1:23:15] thirst. I'm going to keep them pure
[1:23:18] before God and God will provide uh the
[1:23:22] wholesome things.
[1:23:24] The wholesome needs to be fulfilled. If
[1:23:27] it's a desire for a wife or husband,
[1:23:29] pray he'll give you the right one.
[1:23:32] That's right. And then it'll be blessed.
[1:23:34] Then it'll be pure. But once we step out
[1:23:37] of that, then we realize we've taken
[1:23:40] something that God gave us and Satan,
[1:23:42] we've let him pervert it. Can you say
[1:23:44] amen? Satan, this exploits, you know,
[1:23:48] there's so much more to be said, but
[1:23:49] we're going to try to wrap it up here.
[1:23:51] Leodysa flashes all kinds of new things
[1:23:54] in front of us all the time to where we
[1:23:57] desire even more things. we want more
[1:23:59] things or we think we desire it because
[1:24:01] the commercial said uh that we see on
[1:24:04] TV. The commercial that I see on TV, the
[1:24:08] commercial says, "I need this."
[1:24:12] And then you should want it because you
[1:24:15] need it, right?
[1:24:18] Or we think we desire it because the
[1:24:20] commercial said told us we need it. It
[1:24:23] will answer your problems. It will
[1:24:25] satisfy. It will relieve your pain. And
[1:24:29] this exploits god-given cravings and
[1:24:31] desires within us. It perverts normal
[1:24:33] thirsts. Satan even replaces your thirst
[1:24:36] for God with other things. And at the
[1:24:38] end, it's really the Holy Ghost rest and
[1:24:40] peace that you're longing for. We're
[1:24:42] nervous. We desire real satisfaction. We
[1:24:45] find tons of things to activate. what I
[1:24:48] call in simple terms. I read a a little
[1:24:51] uh uh book that described our brain when
[1:24:53] I was uh uh early in the ministry and
[1:24:55] I've just used this because I can't
[1:24:57] understand the big terms. But we act we
[1:25:00] we fill our lives with tons of things
[1:25:02] that activate our pleasure center in our
[1:25:04] brain and we keep doing it. And when we
[1:25:07] keep activating the the uh we we keep
[1:25:10] bringing the endorphins and it's just a
[1:25:12] rush of endorphins and we get pleasure
[1:25:14] in our pleasure center and we keep doing
[1:25:17] it and when we keep doing it it becomes
[1:25:18] an addiction.
[1:25:21] All starts with the desire but then we
[1:25:23] find that pleasure center. Why does it
[1:25:25] become an addiction? We can't deal with
[1:25:28] life's pressures. We can't deal with the
[1:25:30] condemnation.
[1:25:34] I know there's not a lot of amens right
[1:25:36] about, but you know, I want you to think
[1:25:38] about this more than anything else. We
[1:25:40] got access to so much hundreds of things
[1:25:43] to give us a surge of endorphins. The
[1:25:46] science is any group endorphins is any
[1:25:48] groups of hormones secreted within the
[1:25:51] brain and the nervous system and having
[1:25:52] a number of physiological functions.
[1:25:55] They are peptides which activate the
[1:25:57] body's opiate receptors causing an
[1:26:01] anestic effect. Opiotes tied to the word
[1:26:04] opium and and and anestic I'm probably
[1:26:07] saying that wrong. It's tied to drugs or
[1:26:10] something to relieve the pain. So
[1:26:12] something activates those endorphins. In
[1:26:15] my terms, you find a drug, you find
[1:26:17] something to do that taps into your
[1:26:19] pleasure center over and over again to
[1:26:22] relieve yourself.
[1:26:25] And when you do it over and over again,
[1:26:27] it gets an addiction. But as a bonus,
[1:26:30] you get depression. You get
[1:26:32] disappointed.
[1:26:34] You get disappointment after
[1:26:35] disappointment after disappointment. And
[1:26:38] it becomes a cycle in your life.
[1:26:41] If you think I'm just talking to you,
[1:26:44] that's not true. I'm talking to a lot of
[1:26:47] people,
[1:26:48] including myself. Sometimes when Satan
[1:26:51] wants to make me depressed and point me
[1:26:54] to something else as a temptation to
[1:26:57] relieve and get that peace that I want.
[1:27:01] He's not going to direct us to the word
[1:27:02] of God. He's not going to direct us to
[1:27:04] be in his presence and talk to him. Just
[1:27:06] talk to him. He He's got something else.
[1:27:08] He's got hundreds of things.
[1:27:12] There are normal things that activate
[1:27:14] the pleasure center. Food when you're
[1:27:16] hungry. Sleep when you're tired. That
[1:27:18] activates your pleasure center. but not
[1:27:19] continually. You have food when you're
[1:27:21] hungry, you're satisfied. You have
[1:27:23] sleep, when you're tired, you're
[1:27:24] satisfied. Activate your pleasure
[1:27:25] center. You feel good after you get a
[1:27:27] good night's sleep. An encouraging talk
[1:27:29] with a friend, I believe, can activate
[1:27:31] that. Being in a church service, knowing
[1:27:34] that he's here, can you say, "The Lord
[1:27:36] is here." It I believe that can help
[1:27:38] that. But the other stuff is not not a
[1:27:41] normal way to activate your pleasure
[1:27:43] center. And it's funny, it makes people
[1:27:46] not when they use something else and
[1:27:49] they become addicted, it makes people
[1:27:50] not want to eat regular food even though
[1:27:52] they're hungry. Addictions make people
[1:27:54] they don't want to eat anymore.
[1:27:57] And when they do, it's junk food. It
[1:28:00] makes people not able to sleep. So when
[1:28:03] they turn to something else, now they
[1:28:04] can't get any sleep. So the normal
[1:28:06] things God gave us to fulfill and and
[1:28:09] and release those endorphins, we choose
[1:28:12] something else and it actually takes
[1:28:14] away from the normal things God has
[1:28:15] given. This is true in the spiritual.
[1:28:17] Many people withdraw from people and
[1:28:20] withdraw from wholesome friendships.
[1:28:24] They even say, "I don't want to go to
[1:28:26] church." Why don't you want to go to
[1:28:27] church? Because I don't like people.
[1:28:33] What about the people at Walmart?
[1:28:41] the guy that wouldn't the guy that
[1:28:44] didn't want to go to church. His wife
[1:28:45] couldn't get him to go to church. And
[1:28:47] she said, "You got to go. It would be
[1:28:50] good for you. You need it."
[1:28:53] And she said,
[1:28:55] "Why don't you want to go?" He said,
[1:28:59] "Those people don't like me there. I
[1:29:01] don't want to go."
[1:29:03] He said, "Give me good one good reason
[1:29:05] that I need to go to church." And the
[1:29:06] wife said, "You're the pastor."
[1:29:17] Many of you get emotionally down.
[1:29:21] I'm just going to be honest with you.
[1:29:22] Pastors get emotionally down, too.
[1:29:26] You think I'm inhuman? No. I get
[1:29:28] emotionally down. I get that temptation
[1:29:30] to go in depression. You know, years
[1:29:32] ago, I think I had some of it and didn't
[1:29:33] know I had it until I read some of the,
[1:29:35] "Oh my goodness, years ago, I must have
[1:29:37] had that."
[1:29:39] You think I don't go through those low
[1:29:41] times. You don't. You think and and yet
[1:29:43] and yet something has to rise in you. To
[1:29:46] come and bring the word of God even on a
[1:29:48] Sunday like this. God, help me no matter
[1:29:52] how I'm emotionally feeling.
[1:29:55] God, help me to rise above it because
[1:29:56] your people need to be fed. That's good.
[1:30:00] Maybe you should look at and say, "If I
[1:30:02] have to rise above it, then you ought to
[1:30:04] rise above it." Say, "I'm not going to
[1:30:06] let the devil cheat me out of being in
[1:30:08] the house of God." Can I get an amen?
[1:30:12] That's right. Praise the Lord. The woman
[1:30:15] these days turns to a chick flick or
[1:30:17] turns to a romance novel.
[1:30:20] A man turns to sexual perversion. It
[1:30:22] turns to porn. His thirst to conquer and
[1:30:26] to win as a man is fulfilled in a video
[1:30:30] game.
[1:30:32] God gave him the thirst to be a man, to
[1:30:35] conquer, to take over. That's how a man
[1:30:38] should be. He shouldn't be feminine. He
[1:30:40] shouldn't be uh just weak weak uh with a
[1:30:44] weak backbone. He should be a man. He
[1:30:47] should stand and he should be a godly
[1:30:49] man and lead his home.
[1:30:52] So many men are lost their way. Lost
[1:30:55] that thing and they're fulfilling the
[1:30:57] thing to win in the video game. If I can
[1:30:59] win through so many armies and other
[1:31:00] things. Listen now. I'm talking about
[1:31:02] reality and I'm saying because I love
[1:31:04] you. There's a hundreds of things that
[1:31:06] we turn to when God has provided a place
[1:31:10] for these things
[1:31:14] full of all kinds of desires, all kinds
[1:31:16] of ways. Brother Brandham says here in
[1:31:17] the message, thirst. And I'm moving
[1:31:19] right along now. I'm mindful of the
[1:31:21] time. We're a people full of all kinds
[1:31:23] of desires, all kinds of ways to fill
[1:31:25] desires, but maybe we don't need as many
[1:31:27] things as we thought. Maybe we need to
[1:31:29] narrow it down to one main thing as
[1:31:31] David did. Brother says, "My soul
[1:31:34] thirsts for God, for the living God."
[1:31:36] And he's reading from scripture. David
[1:31:38] said, "My soul thirst for God for the
[1:31:39] living God." Not some historical or
[1:31:41] something that happened some years ago
[1:31:43] or some tale that someone told, but for
[1:31:45] the living God, a God that's ever
[1:31:47] present. and his soul thirsted for that
[1:31:50] God not for some historical something.
[1:31:52] Now we find God gives us the control
[1:31:54] tower to you to give you the things that
[1:31:57] you need. Now the control tower in you
[1:31:59] is what directs you and this thirst runs
[1:32:02] in on this tower control tower and tells
[1:32:05] you what you need of spiritually
[1:32:06] speaking the control tower in the body
[1:32:08] and in the soul also. There's a control
[1:32:10] tower in the body that tells you that
[1:32:12] you need that's needed in your body and
[1:32:14] it's brought to you by a thirst. Also,
[1:32:16] there's a control towel in your soul
[1:32:18] that tells you the spiritual things that
[1:32:20] you have need of something in your
[1:32:22] spirit. And you by this can tell what
[1:32:24] kind of life is controlling you. When
[1:32:27] you can see what your desires are, then
[1:32:30] you can tell what kind of something
[1:32:31] that's in you. What's he teaching us?
[1:32:34] Look at your desires.
[1:32:37] Your desires are revealing. That's
[1:32:39] right. Amen.
[1:32:41] When you can see what your desires are
[1:32:42] and then you can tell what kind of
[1:32:44] something that's in you that's creating
[1:32:47] this desire that you have. You see
[1:32:48] there's a certain thing that you thirst
[1:32:50] for and it can tell you in your soul
[1:32:52] what this desire is by the nature of the
[1:32:54] thirst that you have. I hope that you
[1:32:56] can understand that there's a control
[1:32:58] tower of the soul and one for the body
[1:33:01] and each tower is a warning caller for
[1:33:03] the needs of the other. Each one calls
[1:33:05] to the need for what the caller is
[1:33:07] calling for. It sends out a wave of
[1:33:09] warning. For instance, the flesh thirsts
[1:33:11] to satisfy the desires that's in the
[1:33:13] body and the spirit desires for the
[1:33:15] thing that's in the soul. Desire is
[1:33:18] listen now. And many times these war
[1:33:21] against the other.
[1:33:24] We find there what's a great trouble
[1:33:28] today that too many people, are you
[1:33:31] listening? Try to live in between two
[1:33:35] desires.
[1:33:37] For one of them desires the things of
[1:33:39] the earth and the other desires the
[1:33:42] things of heaven. And he says they live
[1:33:47] in between two desires. My brother, my
[1:33:50] sister, that's a miserable life to live.
[1:33:54] Make a choice where you want to live
[1:33:55] from
[1:33:57] and make David's choice. Listen, I can
[1:34:00] live in heaven now. I can live in
[1:34:01] heavenly places now. Now, don't go so
[1:34:04] heavenly places that you forget to pay
[1:34:05] your bills.
[1:34:07] Too heavenly minded that you're no
[1:34:09] earthly good. I find today we don't have
[1:34:11] people that are so heavenly minded
[1:34:12] they're no earthly good. We hardly have
[1:34:14] any of those. We have people that are
[1:34:16] too earthly minded to be any heavenly
[1:34:18] good.
[1:34:20] That's what I find in our lives is we
[1:34:21] have too much going on. And so now we we
[1:34:24] we look for these things and not to live
[1:34:26] in between two desires. I think that's
[1:34:28] great uh a great thing from the Holy
[1:34:30] Spirit through his prophet telling us in
[1:34:32] this hour people live. Don't live in
[1:34:34] between two desires. It's a miserable
[1:34:37] way to live. It is a miser. One of them
[1:34:39] desires the things of the earth. The
[1:34:41] other desires the things of heaven. And
[1:34:43] this is what David is saying. One thing
[1:34:46] have I desired and that's my that I
[1:34:49] could behold him every day. That I could
[1:34:52] be where he's at every day. Wherever I
[1:34:54] am to live in that dimension that he's
[1:34:58] with me, I'm with him and he controls
[1:35:01] things. Now, I'm going to skip through
[1:35:02] this cuz I I promise to be short today.
[1:35:05] Praise the Lord. We'll pick this up
[1:35:06] again next Sunday.
[1:35:08] Help me get something out of this this
[1:35:10] morning.
[1:35:11] There there's a Lisa Turkst who wrote a
[1:35:14] book called Made to Crave. And of
[1:35:16] course, it's about diet and things, but
[1:35:18] she says something in there. It's not
[1:35:20] the howto that I'm missing. and she's
[1:35:22] talking about food, talking about uh
[1:35:26] dieting. It's not the how-to that I'm
[1:35:28] missing. It's the want to.
[1:35:32] That's a profound statement and that can
[1:35:34] be applied to anything in our lives
[1:35:36] because what I find even in this message
[1:35:38] is that we we know what we need to do.
[1:35:43] Yes,
[1:35:45] the how-tos are there. Not only through
[1:35:48] all the books that we have, but this
[1:35:49] message has revealed the entrance to
[1:35:53] God, the entrance into a secret place.
[1:35:56] It's not a problem with how to. Probably
[1:35:58] every person in here could just spit off
[1:36:00] the answers, what you need to do, what
[1:36:02] the word says you need to do. It's not
[1:36:04] the how to, it's the want to.
[1:36:08] It's at the seat of our desires. It's
[1:36:11] becoming a passion is not only has God
[1:36:13] provided it, but I want it with all my
[1:36:16] heart. I desire it with all my heart.
[1:36:19] Nobody's pushing me to go to church. I
[1:36:21] desire. Somebody said uh something about
[1:36:24] they couldn't get somebody to go to
[1:36:25] church. And I just remind you if God is
[1:36:27] in your heart then you can't wait till
[1:36:29] the doors are open. What is brother
[1:36:31] Brandham speaking when he says that? I'm
[1:36:32] not here to say that to belittle
[1:36:34] somebody. I'm saying this works
[1:36:36] according to desire. I you're not
[1:36:38] getting a special pin today like
[1:36:40] denominations for attendance. I'm not
[1:36:42] giving those out and I don't put
[1:36:44] pressure on people to come because what
[1:36:46] it works from a desire. It works from a
[1:36:50] passion. I'm not going to see brother
[1:36:52] Paul. I'm not going to see the music.
[1:36:54] I'll worship. I'm going because my soul
[1:36:57] is hungry. I've got to be in his
[1:36:59] presence. This doesn't work on an
[1:37:01] attendance schedule. This works on a
[1:37:04] hunger. This works on a passion. He
[1:37:06] said, "If God is in your heart, you
[1:37:08] can't wait till the doors are open. And
[1:37:10] if you don't have that this morning, and
[1:37:12] if I don't have enough, this is the one
[1:37:14] thing that we should be praying. Say,
[1:37:15] God, put such a passion in me that none
[1:37:18] of this is because I have to do it. It's
[1:37:20] because I need to do it.
[1:37:23] I have a desire. God has a place to meet
[1:37:26] that desire and I want to be where he's
[1:37:28] at.
[1:37:30] Blessed be his name. John Wesley said
[1:37:32] something. I'm going to read it about
[1:37:34] the man of God, about the woman of God,
[1:37:36] and I'm going to close on this
[1:37:37] statement. Praise the Lord. And we'll
[1:37:40] get back to this. Martin Luther said, "A
[1:37:42] believer, his heart is ever lifted up to
[1:37:44] God at all times and in all places. In
[1:37:47] this, he is never hindered, much less
[1:37:50] interrupted by any person or thing. In
[1:37:54] retirement or company, in leisure, in
[1:37:58] business or conversation, his heart is
[1:38:01] ever with the Lord."
[1:38:04] Whether he lie down or rise up, God is
[1:38:08] in his thoughts. He walks with God
[1:38:11] continually. Amen. That's my prayer this
[1:38:14] morning. John Wesley said he was
[1:38:17] catching it. David caught it in the Old
[1:38:19] Testament. If all these brothers have
[1:38:21] caught it, may we catch it this morning.
[1:38:24] Now, I could go another half hour and
[1:38:25] you know, I usually do. But you know
[1:38:26] what? I wonder
[1:38:30] even in this age we live in, we get so
[1:38:33] much information, we get overwhelmed.
[1:38:35] It's about the quality
[1:38:38] of what we receive, not the quantity.
[1:38:42] I've got quotes there and scriptures and
[1:38:45] I could go on and it keep echoing the
[1:38:48] same subject and I know you would say,
[1:38:50] "Amen." But I wonder sometimes even in
[1:38:52] our midst, we have so much information
[1:38:55] and so much coming to us that we just
[1:38:58] nod and that we go, "I don't want that,
[1:39:00] friends. I want God to change our
[1:39:02] desires
[1:39:04] and make us close to really wanting what
[1:39:06] David want. Say, God, you've given me so
[1:39:09] much today to take into my heart, but I
[1:39:11] don't want to overwhelm us. I I want it
[1:39:13] to I want us to be overflowing with his
[1:39:15] goodness, but I don't want it to be
[1:39:17] where it's there's no repentance.
[1:39:19] There's no prayer. So, I'm going to
[1:39:22] close this now and have the musicians
[1:39:24] come. But I think I should cut this
[1:39:27] short today for the purpose of what I'm
[1:39:28] preaching on. I think you should talk to
[1:39:32] the Lord.
[1:39:35] I think you should talk to the Lord. I
[1:39:37] think we should stand.
[1:39:42] Don't be diverted by the musicians or
[1:39:44] anything right now. I think we should
[1:39:46] just speak to the Lord because I've
[1:39:49] probably given enough today for us to
[1:39:52] chew on. Enough to reach out and say, "I
[1:39:56] want more of God. I need more of this. I
[1:39:58] need this one desire to be prominent in
[1:40:01] my life. We have so much. There's a
[1:40:04] scripture that says the prophets and
[1:40:05] sages would have longed to see the and
[1:40:07] hear the things that you hear. I think
[1:40:10] of David before Calvary and before the
[1:40:12] Holy Ghost. And one time the word was
[1:40:15] coming back and the ark was coming back
[1:40:16] and he began to dance. He began to get
[1:40:18] happy. His wife criticized him. He's
[1:40:20] acting like a crazy man. And that was
[1:40:22] the ark with the word in it. He had
[1:40:25] nothing compared to what you heard this
[1:40:27] morning. And I'm not saying I'm the
[1:40:28] preacher. I'm just saying we're hearing
[1:40:30] things, friends, and I don't want it to
[1:40:33] be information. I want it to be a
[1:40:35] revelation. I want church to be the
[1:40:38] person of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want
[1:40:40] you to leave saying he was here today.
[1:40:45] He was speaking to my heart. Can you
[1:40:48] imagine how David would act if he was in
[1:40:51] the service this morning? He was a
[1:40:53] shoutter. He was a dancer. And he got
[1:40:55] happy and danced. Even when it was the
[1:40:57] Ten Commandments in an arc, he got happy
[1:41:00] about that. Can you imagine how David
[1:41:03] would act after he heard a service like
[1:41:05] this?
[1:41:07] He just sneaks in. I wouldn't know what
[1:41:09] he looked like, but if I knew it was
[1:41:11] David, I'd let David be the speaker.
[1:41:14] Talk to us a little bit more about this
[1:41:16] one thing I desire. How did you discover
[1:41:18] that? But if he sneaked in, I wouldn't
[1:41:20] know what he looked at. I I think David
[1:41:22] would make his way all the way from the
[1:41:25] back to the front row. I believe he
[1:41:27] would be sitting on the front row. And
[1:41:29] when I would read my scripture, he'd
[1:41:30] probably already be up shouting.
[1:41:34] I remember saying that one thing I
[1:41:36] desired. Hey, he's talking about me. I
[1:41:39] see myself in the word. And then I
[1:41:41] elaborated. I show him the conditions
[1:41:43] we're living in. And he sees all these.
[1:41:45] You people, you live in these
[1:41:47] conditions. Can I testify? Can I say God
[1:41:49] bless you? Keep pressing on, brother and
[1:41:52] sister. I never had to live under those
[1:41:54] kind of pressures. You need to be in the
[1:41:56] presence of God more than anything else.
[1:41:59] David would preach back to us. Can you
[1:42:02] say amen? Amen. It's like Sherry's song
[1:42:05] that when we get to the other side, they
[1:42:07] say, "Are you she the bride of the the
[1:42:09] last days who stood the worst of times?"
[1:42:12] We're looking at people that lost their
[1:42:14] heads and they were their their babies
[1:42:16] were stripped from their tummies and all
[1:42:18] these other things. And we're we're
[1:42:20] looking at them as the heroes, but
[1:42:21] they'll look at the bride of the last
[1:42:23] days under Leodysia and the mental
[1:42:25] pressure and they'll look at you made it
[1:42:27] through Leodysia. You made it. Are you
[1:42:29] the one that made it? And we'll say only
[1:42:31] by the grace of God. Only by the Holy
[1:42:34] Ghost and his grace. We made it. Cuz
[1:42:37] there will be some overcomers to this
[1:42:40] Leodysian age. All the choices, all the
[1:42:43] desires, all the commercials, all the
[1:42:45] different things. And we just said, "But
[1:42:48] you know what? I don't want any of that.
[1:42:50] I just want to be where he's at.
[1:42:54] I get to preaching about Jesus and the
[1:42:56] rich young ruler. And you think David's
[1:42:58] going to sit sit still here? No. I think
[1:43:00] he'd be shouting the aisles.
[1:43:03] Glory be to God. Prophets and sages
[1:43:06] would have liked to heard what you heard
[1:43:08] this morning. Amen.
[1:43:10] If we get too much information, we'll
[1:43:12] take it for granted and we won't let it
[1:43:14] go to our desire. May the Lord help us
[1:43:17] to not take the quantity of things but
[1:43:20] the quality of his Holy Spirit in our
[1:43:23] lives. Can we pray?
[1:43:26] I just want to be where you are. Gideon,
[1:43:28] if you can sing it. Close your eyes. Bow
[1:43:30] your head.
[1:43:33] I just want you to speak to the Lord.
[1:43:39] How long has it been since he's heard
[1:43:41] your voice?
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:46] I just want you to speak to the Lord.
[1:43:49] Maybe you just echo the things that
[1:43:51] you've heard this morning. Whatever it
[1:43:52] is you want to say to him.
[1:43:55] I long to see a a a true confession and
[1:43:58] repentance because I know that's the
[1:44:01] door to get back. That's the door to get
[1:44:02] back into where we should be. Never for
[1:44:06] it to be a pressure,
[1:44:08] but for it to be considered a privilege
[1:44:11] to be given the invitation to repent.
[1:44:15] I trust you'll do it this morning. Would
[1:44:17] you speak to him just now?
[1:44:22] Our dear Lord,
[1:44:26] there's times that we become aware,
[1:44:28] Lord, of your presence.
[1:44:31] We know that you're present among us.
[1:44:34] It makes me sometimes want to just step
[1:44:36] back and not say anything because Lord,
[1:44:38] you can say more by the Holy Spirit
[1:44:41] anointing than any man can ever say.
[1:44:44] Even though you speak through man, you
[1:44:46] can do more. You can say more. You can
[1:44:49] move upon someone right now with the
[1:44:51] spirit of repentance and bring them
[1:44:53] back. Lord, bring them into that place.
[1:44:57] So many of us, Lord, have under mental
[1:44:59] pressure and strains and depression. And
[1:45:02] I pray that person would reach into the
[1:45:05] heavens today.
[1:45:07] Reach their hand up and surrender. Lord,
[1:45:10] I don't know how how you're going to do
[1:45:12] it, but I surrender myself because I
[1:45:15] just want to be affected by where you're
[1:45:17] at and live in your presence. Bless
[1:45:19] these hungry hearts this morning. If
[1:45:22] there's a desire that's come from the
[1:45:24] world, if there's a desire that's not of
[1:45:25] you, I pray you'll take it out of them,
[1:45:27] Lord, and that you'd replace it and put
[1:45:30] within them such a hunger for Almighty
[1:45:33] God. May that hunger grow. May it become
[1:45:36] a passion. May it become a fervor, Lord,
[1:45:39] like it was with David, that he couldn't
[1:45:41] wait to come into his presence. He
[1:45:43] couldn't wait to be there to behold the
[1:45:46] beauty of the Lord. It was a person to
[1:45:48] him. It wasn't a building. It was a
[1:45:50] person. Lord, may every
[1:45:53] child of God here, may you become a
[1:45:56] person to them, real to them, not a
[1:45:58] book, not a tape, not just even a Bible,
[1:46:02] but introduce yourself as the author.
[1:46:04] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:46:08] call for these souls to come closer to
[1:46:11] you through your anointing that's
[1:46:13] moving. Father, we commit it in Jesus'
[1:46:16] name. In Jesus name. We want to be Lord
[1:46:21] where you are. We want to be in your

[1:46:28] we desired.
[1:46:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just lift your
[1:46:33] hands and surrender. I just want to be.

[1:49:56] hunger for the Holy Ghost and for your
[1:49:58] presence and for the reality of God. We
