[0:00] each one who has come and those families
[0:02] who are listening online
[0:04] god bless you god's richest blessings to
[0:06] all of you
[0:07] praise the lord zechariah chapter 4
[0:11] and verse 1 we'll read 1 through 10.
[0:16] and the angel that talked with me came
[0:18] again and waked me
[0:20] as a man that waketh out of his sleep
[0:22] and said unto me what see us thou and i
[0:24] said i have looked and behold a
[0:26] candlestick all of gold
[0:28] and with a bowl upon the top of it and
[0:31] his
[0:32] seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to
[0:34] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[0:37] thereof
[0:38] so in the vision this is the symbolism
[0:41] we know as
[0:43] seven church ages
[0:45] the lamp stand that was also seen in the
[0:48] book of revelations is the vision
[0:50] that the prophets had
[0:52] speaking of the 2000 years of church
[0:54] ages with seven messengers and seven
[0:57] church ages
[0:58] times
[1:00] verse 3 says in two olive trees by it
[1:03] one upon the right side of the bowl and
[1:05] the other upon the left side this is
[1:06] referred to
[1:08] as the old and the new testament but
[1:10] notice there are two olive trees olive
[1:12] trees is where we get the oil oil has to
[1:15] flow through
[1:16] the lamp stand and so it comes from
[1:18] there it comes from a source and so
[1:21] you see the symbolism showing us that
[1:24] the holy spirit is the one throughout
[1:26] the church ages the oil is the thing
[1:29] that was needed and actually only by the
[1:31] spirit has god been able to deal with
[1:33] his people that's how he deals with his
[1:35] people is through the holy spirit
[1:37] so i answered and speak to the angel
[1:39] that talked with me saying what are
[1:40] these my lord
[1:43] then the angel that talked with me
[1:44] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:46] not what these be and i said no my lord
[1:49] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:51] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[1:53] zerubbabel
[1:55] saying
[1:56] not by might nor by power
[1:59] but by my spirit saith the lord of host
[2:03] now we've heard that that scripture many
[2:05] times but i want you to notice now if
[2:07] it's already gave the church ages then
[2:09] now we come to the end of the church
[2:11] ages in time
[2:13] and we come to zerubbabel who rebuilt
[2:15] the temple and we come to this statement
[2:18] not by might nor by power but by my
[2:20] spirit saith the lord and at the end it
[2:22] will be a time
[2:24] that god removes all the other
[2:27] possibilities of things being able to
[2:30] save us things being able to deliver us
[2:34] at the end time which i'll if i god will
[2:36] help me i'll describe
[2:38] what kind of time we're living in it's
[2:40] it's more complex and more trouble than
[2:43] any other people has ever lived in
[2:45] but in that trouble god makes it so that
[2:48] there's nothing by your human efforts
[2:52] there's nothing of your might there's
[2:54] nothing of your power man's power
[2:56] political power he makes it so there is
[2:59] nothing
[3:01] as far as our answer and our escape
[3:03] except for the spirit of god
[3:08] and he makes it us dependent on that
[3:10] which i don't mind being dependent
[3:13] can you say man
[3:15] you won't get out of this by your might
[3:16] by your power by any man's might he's
[3:19] set it up so all those things are
[3:20] dismantled to where we have to depend on
[3:22] his holy spirit
[3:25] who art thou o great mountain
[3:28] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[3:30] plain
[3:31] and he shall build bring forth the
[3:34] headstone
[3:35] whereof with shoutings crying grace
[3:40] grace unto it
[3:42] with shoutings crying grace
[3:45] what is this headstone what is this
[3:47] thing coming what is this stone that
[3:49] actually represents revelation what is
[3:52] this revelation coming to us we can call
[3:54] it a lot of things but when they cried
[3:56] out they cried out this is grace coming
[3:59] to us
[4:00] this is grace coming to us
[4:04] with shoutings crying grace
[4:06] grace unto it moreover the word of the
[4:08] lord came unto me saying the hands of
[4:10] the rubble will have laid the foundation
[4:12] of this house his hands shall also
[4:16] finish it and doesn't that relate to
[4:17] what brother jason and them were
[4:18] preaching and brother diggs as well
[4:22] talking about he who has begun a good
[4:24] work will be faithful to complete it if
[4:26] he began the work then we don't end it
[4:29] with our works if he began you with
[4:31] grace he'll end you with grace if he
[4:33] began the work he'll finish the work
[4:38] the hands of the rubble that had laid
[4:40] the foundation this south his hand shall
[4:42] also finish it and thou shalt know that
[4:44] the lord of hosts has sent me unto you
[4:46] for who hath despised the day of small
[4:49] things
[4:51] who hath despised
[4:53] he must be saying that because people
[4:56] despise small things that god can work
[4:58] through
[4:59] and glorify the big things that god can
[5:02] do
[5:04] but who dares to despise the day when
[5:07] god
[5:07] in his simplicity
[5:09] to can manifest his power to the people
[5:12] and deliver them father bless your word
[5:15] you know what's in my heart i pray you
[5:16] help me to deliver it to the people i
[5:18] really pray that lord and i ask for your
[5:21] help in jesus name amen god bless you
[5:23] may be seated this morning
[5:27] i want you to hold your finger there in
[5:30] zechariah and i'll just grab back in
[5:32] daniel another prophet
[5:34] who
[5:35] had a similar vision if not the same
[5:37] vision
[5:38] and i'll turn you to daniel chapter 2 as
[5:41] the vision speaks of
[5:43] this image that is throughout history of
[5:45] the world empires
[5:47] and the spirits behind those things the
[5:48] great image that daniel said so hold
[5:50] your finger in zechariah we'll go back
[5:51] there but daniel the prophet sees us
[5:55] very similar if not the same vision
[5:58] and it it it works its way through time
[6:00] from the
[6:01] babylonian empire all the way to the
[6:03] roman empire verse 31 of chapter 2 thou
[6:07] king saw us and behold a great image
[6:08] this great image whose brightness was
[6:11] excellent stood before thee
[6:13] and the form thereof was terrible this
[6:15] image's head was of fine gold his breast
[6:18] of his arms of silver his belly his
[6:20] thighs of brass his legs of iron his
[6:22] feet are part of the iron and part of
[6:24] the clay so throughout history now these
[6:26] world empires and these spirits and it's
[6:29] called an image so this is an image of
[6:31] something else this isn't the image of
[6:32] god this is an image of other powers and
[6:35] influences that is in the people's lives
[6:37] throughout history keeps coming down you
[6:40] know god's pyramid works from the bottom
[6:42] up but satan's kingdom is describes it
[6:44] from the top to the feet and so now it
[6:47] works its way it all comes down to the
[6:49] legs which is the the kingdom of rome
[6:52] and then it says look what it says here
[6:55] now similar vision verse 34 thou sawest
[6:59] till that till a stone now in in
[7:01] zachariah there was a headstone there
[7:03] was a stone
[7:05] thou saw us till that stone was cut out
[7:07] without hands which smote the image upon
[7:10] his feet that were of iron and of clay
[7:12] and break them into pieces so now these
[7:15] powerful powerful influences and spirits
[7:18] are overwhelming to the individual
[7:21] overwhelming to the people of god except
[7:23] for one thing that he sends his stone
[7:27] which means
[7:28] revelation so you'd be in trouble with
[7:31] this image except for the stone comes
[7:34] and crushes this image
[7:38] and it's the grace of god that sends the
[7:40] headstone
[7:43] and so there was iron in the clay so
[7:45] this stone broke into pieces verse 35
[7:47] let me finish here then was the iron the
[7:48] clay the brass the silver and the gold
[7:50] broke into pieces together and became
[7:52] like the shaft of the summer of
[7:54] thrusting floors and the wind carried
[7:56] them away that no place was found for
[7:58] them and the stone that smote the image
[8:02] became a great mountain and filled the
[8:05] whole earth that's prophecy speaking and
[8:07] it's taken us right up to the end time
[8:09] the same vision that zechariah sees and
[8:11] that is that this stone and i want to
[8:13] just elaborate on this
[8:15] this image because this is an
[8:17] overwhelming
[8:19] uh spirit and as this image comes down
[8:22] to the end time to the feet of iron and
[8:24] clay as it comes down you have to
[8:26] realize that all the spirits and all the
[8:29] influences and all the cruelty and all
[8:32] the the defiance against the true god
[8:35] everything that's in that all is
[8:37] culminated in the feet in the end time
[8:39] which is when you live you live in the
[8:40] end time so all of this power comes now
[8:43] on the feet and becomes a pressure on
[8:45] the people of god it becomes an image
[8:47] that is is more powerful than them they
[8:50] can't handle it themselves
[8:52] and it all culminates in the end time
[8:55] and comes to the final and if you read
[8:57] the book of daniel you'll see when it
[8:59] comes into the roman empire it switches
[9:02] because it says that part of the beast
[9:05] is a diverse and he switches to a
[9:08] religious front in other words it's all
[9:10] the power of rome the caesars but it
[9:13] switches to a religious satan says i
[9:16] can't get worship this way from the
[9:17] people so i'm going to switch into a
[9:20] form of christianity i'll take the power
[9:23] of the beast can you say man i'll take
[9:25] the power of rome but it's going to be
[9:27] at the front of christianity
[9:30] and it will become more diverse which
[9:32] means when it becomes more diverse it
[9:34] becomes more pressure it becomes more
[9:37] confusing to sincere hearts
[9:40] because because they're going what in
[9:42] the world is this
[9:44] what is this well daniel and the
[9:45] prophets describe what it is
[9:50] and so
[9:51] if you wouldn't mind
[9:53] then
[9:54] and boy you could spend a lot more time
[9:56] on this but if you would in daniel now
[9:59] chapter 12 at the last chapter this is
[10:02] what he sees at the end time
[10:04] daniel chapter 12
[10:08] and at that time shall michael i'm just
[10:10] laying a foundation here i'll preach in
[10:12] a minute
[10:13] and at that time shall michael stand up
[10:15] the great prince which standeth for the
[10:17] people the children of thy people daniel
[10:20] and there shall be a time of trouble
[10:24] such as never was
[10:26] since there was a nation even to the
[10:28] same time
[10:30] and at that time so just stop right
[10:31] there this will be a time of trouble
[10:33] this is the hour that we live in
[10:36] it's the hour that the jews will live in
[10:38] in tribulation it will be a time of
[10:40] trouble such as no man since there never
[10:43] was to any nation at any time before
[10:46] this a time of trouble
[10:48] there should be a time of trouble such
[10:50] as never was since there was a nation
[10:51] even to the same time it's a good thing
[10:54] the scripture don't end there for it
[10:56] says and at that time thy people daniel
[10:59] shall be delivered
[11:04] i'm glad that scripture's there
[11:06] at that time your people will be
[11:09] delivered daniel
[11:10] i know that it's a i know that it's a
[11:13] big mountain i know that it's the time
[11:14] of trouble i know it's overwhelming for
[11:16] you and i know your people will live in
[11:18] a time that's more trouble more
[11:20] confusing more diverse more spirits
[11:23] dealing with it i know they'll live in
[11:24] that but i want to i want to tell you
[11:26] there'll be a word of grace come and
[11:28] your people will be delivered and look
[11:30] how they'll be delivered every one of
[11:32] them those that will be found written in
[11:36] the book and that's what we heard last
[11:38] weekend the gene seed of god can you say
[11:40] man you know why god will deliver his
[11:42] people because he predestinated you to
[11:44] overcome in this age
[11:46] there's something in you that's going to
[11:48] overcome the beast of this age there's
[11:50] something in you that's going to
[11:52] overcome all the spirits of this
[11:54] age
[11:56] why because you have power to do it i
[11:59] guarantee you you don't
[12:02] but if your name is written in the
[12:03] lamb's book of life
[12:06] he's going to pick those names up and
[12:07] say i'm going to deliver my people out
[12:09] of it
[12:10] you ought to be shouting right now you
[12:12] ought to be saying lord i thank you that
[12:14] my eyes have been opened i thank you
[12:16] that i heard preaching last weekend like
[12:18] i heard that this isn't this isn't i
[12:20] it's not me that's predestinated it's
[12:23] the gene seed of god that's
[12:24] predestinated
[12:26] i'm not looking at myself i'm looking at
[12:28] that i'm a son and daughter of god
[12:31] and if i'm written in that book i'm
[12:33] going to overcome this thing
[12:37] so i just wanted you to catch that as a
[12:39] foundation it's in the worst time of
[12:41] trouble that's ever been that they will
[12:44] be delivered because their name is book
[12:46] written in the book already the final
[12:48] overwhelming obstacle of an image
[12:51] or a mountain in zechariah 4 a mountain
[12:54] that is before them who art thou this
[12:56] great mountain and and he said you shall
[12:59] be brought as a plane in other words
[13:02] god's not intimidated
[13:04] by a mountain of people were caught in
[13:06] the valley and they're looking at this
[13:07] huge image they're looking at this huge
[13:09] mountain and there's no way that we can
[13:11] move that there's no way that we can do
[13:13] anything with that
[13:15] it's it's over it's an overwhelming
[13:17] obstacle of an image or a mountain
[13:19] that's unbeatable through the power and
[13:22] might of man or your own power but he
[13:24] says by the spirit he provides a stone a
[13:27] stone is a revelation can you say man
[13:30] it's a headstone and brother brown makes
[13:32] this point in in the in the message
[13:34] message of grace he makes this point he
[13:37] said i want you to notice it's not the
[13:39] cornerstone it's the headstone
[13:43] so most of christianity knows who the
[13:45] cornerstone is it's the revelation of
[13:47] christ but you see it's not just the
[13:49] revelation of christ the cornerstone now
[13:52] it's a revelation coming as him as the
[13:54] headstone
[13:56] we're living in the end time we don't we
[13:58] don't need another revelation of the
[14:01] cornerstone christ and that revelation
[14:03] we need something greater and that's a
[14:05] revelation of the headstone so whatever
[14:07] this revelation when it comes it'll
[14:09] strike that image and it'll help you to
[14:11] overcome
[14:14] amen most of you that are in the word
[14:16] and been in the word for years
[14:17] understand these things but i'm laying a
[14:18] foundation and i'm always sensitive to
[14:20] the fact that our young people and
[14:21] everyone needs to see in the bible see
[14:23] where we're at now and understand these
[14:25] are not just stories or symbolisms by a
[14:28] prophet we're living in these times that
[14:30] the headstone the revelation the the
[14:32] whatever you want to call it but a stone
[14:34] is a revelation how many know stone
[14:36] means a revelation
[14:37] thou art peter and upon this rock i'll
[14:39] build my church it wasn't peter but
[14:41] peter means little stone so stone means
[14:43] revelation upon this rock i'll build my
[14:46] church stone is a revelation and
[14:48] whatever this stone is this stone this
[14:50] revelation at the end time is powerful
[14:52] enough powerful enough to crush that
[14:54] image
[14:58] and deliver the people of god
[15:01] amen
[15:03] so
[15:04] this overwhelming
[15:06] it's not just a a cornerstone revelation
[15:09] but a headstone revelation not just a
[15:11] cornerstone revelation of christ but a
[15:14] headstone revelation to destroy the
[15:16] impossible final mountain that is in
[15:19] front of god's people now when we really
[15:21] see
[15:23] so now i'll get into my message this
[15:25] morning when we really see
[15:27] what it is that god has sent us in the
[15:30] end time
[15:31] we will call it what it is
[15:35] when we see it right
[15:37] we'll call it what it is i want you to
[15:40] notice now
[15:41] the stone comes the headstone comes
[15:45] god has just said in this hour
[15:49] not by might
[15:51] not by power
[15:52] but my my spirit saith the lord
[15:56] when this stone comes
[15:58] it comes
[15:59] to crush to make a plane that mountain
[16:01] to however you want to look at to crush
[16:02] the image but when this stone comes the
[16:05] response back
[16:07] brother braham says from the prince or
[16:09] zerubbabel or the people but the
[16:11] response back from the people is a
[16:13] shouting shouting
[16:16] what is this that's come to us
[16:18] what has come to us at the end time that
[16:20] would be so powerful revelation that it
[16:22] would crush the influence of this image
[16:24] that would crush the the power of it can
[16:26] you say man in my own life it wouldn't
[16:28] have influence in my life but god would
[16:30] influence my life what is coming that is
[16:32] so powerful and we can name it all they
[16:34] want but these people named it one thing
[16:37] with crying shouting god has sent us
[16:40] grace in the end time
[16:42] i'll name it grace can you say amen
[16:45] grace
[16:47] what's come to us grace
[16:50] the favor of god the unmerited favor of
[16:53] god we needed grace when he saved us can
[16:56] you say man when you're saved 20 years
[16:58] ago you were saved it was grace that
[17:00] saved you it wasn't your works it's not
[17:02] you burning a candle it's not speaking
[17:04] in tongues it was grace you had nothing
[17:06] to do with it
[17:08] god doesn't begin his grace at the
[17:10] beginning and at the end time now it's
[17:12] going to be our works it was grace in
[17:14] the beginning and he'll send grace at
[17:16] the end if we make a rapture it'll be
[17:19] because of his grace
[17:23] what is this mouth what is this
[17:25] headstone what is this revelation now i
[17:27] tell you we can call it and for years
[17:30] we've called it so many things it's the
[17:32] message it's the message of william
[17:34] branham it's the message of the last
[17:36] days and all those terms are fine except
[17:39] for the fact sometimes i don't like what
[17:41] satan has put as a bad name on the term
[17:44] the message
[17:45] because people that's supposed to be a
[17:46] pure term the message of the last days
[17:49] but it has a lot of connotations today
[17:52] come on now
[17:54] and it's lost its meaning to a lot of
[17:56] people because they look at the internet
[17:58] too much and they put a cloud over this
[18:01] term the message
[18:03] we use it message churches and the
[18:05] message and the message and this are
[18:07] they in the message out of the other
[18:08] message and so we've earned this term
[18:10] and so we've got all these terms the
[18:12] message of william branham the prophet
[18:14] and we preached that clearly in this
[18:16] church that we that's what we stand for
[18:18] because it's what god sent in the last
[18:19] days but i just wanted to say to you
[18:21] this morning i don't know exactly how to
[18:23] say it i just want to stay we can put
[18:25] whatever term we want to what god has
[18:26] sent in the last days
[18:28] we can allow you see that because we
[18:30] have our terms that we name it but the
[18:32] devil has his terms that he names it now
[18:34] too
[18:36] one of the main ones it's a cult
[18:39] it's full of legalistic people that's a
[18:41] lie of the enemy
[18:42] that's the wrong name to this thing
[18:44] can you imagine taking what god said is
[18:47] profit in the last days can you imagine
[18:50] the audacity for somebody to be online
[18:52] and even hint that this is of man or
[18:55] even hint that this is a cult
[19:00] it's kind of quiet
[19:03] the arrogance of the devil through some
[19:05] of these people to just name it what
[19:07] they want to name it i'll tell you on
[19:08] judgment day they're going to find out a
[19:10] different story
[19:12] and whatever term satan has given this
[19:14] thing and whatever term we give it i'm
[19:16] telling you when they seen it come this
[19:18] headstone they didn't label it the
[19:21] message they didn't label it brother
[19:22] branham's message they didn't refer to a
[19:25] prophet they didn't refer they said
[19:27] what's coming grace
[19:29] grace has come to me
[19:33] it's a message of grace
[19:35] how can we turn it into anything less
[19:38] than what god and say listen without it
[19:40] we're
[19:42] we wouldn't have an escape out of this
[19:43] world
[19:47] you say oh yeah we would i've got my
[19:49] bible you do
[19:51] how well are people doing this with
[19:53] their bibles and i'm not knocking that
[19:55] i'm saying the message came to restore
[19:57] us back and take the veils off the bible
[20:00] and with veils on it by denominational
[20:01] creeds it becomes a net effect to the
[20:04] people your bible is not effective if
[20:06] you've got veils over it
[20:09] so we needed something to come and give
[20:11] us eyesight we needed isab we needed
[20:13] something to come but at the end of the
[20:15] day the conclusion we make and there's
[20:18] arguments and we go back and forth are
[20:19] they in the message are they admitted
[20:21] and i'm just i'm i'm already in trouble
[20:23] so just keep saying it i don't like the
[20:25] term message being placed in such a
[20:27] thing that it's just another movement
[20:30] that's in the earth
[20:32] i don't see it as that oh you've got the
[20:35] seven day adventists and you got them
[20:36] and it's all really the same thing
[20:38] you're just another movement in it i i
[20:40] detest that
[20:43] you cannot there's no comparison with
[20:46] what god has sent to us
[20:49] so i'd like to get back to a biblical
[20:51] term
[20:53] what god sent
[20:55] is grace
[20:58] hallelujah it's grace brother several
[21:01] it's grace let's simplify this thing
[21:04] now there might be people here are
[21:06] listening
[21:07] you're so clouded now you don't see it
[21:09] as god's grace
[21:11] because either you don't know what grace
[21:13] is
[21:14] i mean i could take the simple way that
[21:16] when people are getting ready for
[21:17] judgment in noah's day in sodom and
[21:18] gomorrah's day when they were getting
[21:20] ready for judgment god sent a prophet
[21:25] and the prophet's word
[21:26] was the grace to get out of their
[21:28] judgment
[21:30] but now he's all changed it now no it's
[21:32] all different and that's not different
[21:36] and he gives a bad name of the prophet
[21:37] he gives a man bad name to the message
[21:40] he likes to link everything in what
[21:42] church are a you know well we're we're
[21:44] non-daenam
[21:47] and non-denom
[21:49] yeah but what do you really believe in
[21:50] that so you try to get into it and say
[21:52] but you just you don't want the labels
[21:54] because people categorize you into
[21:56] certain things it makes them feel better
[22:02] and i could say well we're part of the
[22:03] message of the last days and we've got a
[22:05] bunch of churches around the world and i
[22:06] could go into all that and all that's
[22:08] true but i don't like to be
[22:11] put in a category making this
[22:14] just another pebble on the beach
[22:19] is everybody okay with this
[22:22] because i know this isn't another pebble
[22:24] on the beach
[22:25] and people will say that have not got
[22:27] under themselves they're listening to
[22:28] somebody on the internet they're taking
[22:29] somebody else's conclusion if give me
[22:31] six months give me six months and don't
[22:33] feed on that feed on the message itself
[22:35] and if god doesn't open your eyes that
[22:37] this is a completely different thing you
[22:40] haven't even hardly read it yourself
[22:43] and after whatever you know 30 years of
[22:45] reading it myself
[22:46] i was convinced early on by the holy
[22:48] ghost man this is not about william
[22:51] branham this is not about william
[22:53] branham
[22:55] i have the greatest respect for what god
[22:58] used him for to bring this thing but
[22:59] it's not about william branham this is
[23:02] god's grace to the people of the last
[23:04] days
[23:06] this is god's grace
[23:10] [Applause]
[23:12] hallelujah
[23:13] excuse me for getting excited
[23:16] excuse me for getting excited i don't
[23:18] call it what it is satan's called it all
[23:20] kinds of things you're confused
[23:22] sometimes in your mind some people but
[23:23] listen i want to make it crystal clear
[23:27] it's god's grace to his people
[23:32] and you want to live a
[23:34] a double life and you want to be worldly
[23:37] and still be have your foot in the
[23:38] message and you want to get online and
[23:40] you want to describe the grace of god
[23:42] people are judgmental and so they don't
[23:44] know you're not qualified to talk about
[23:47] the grace of god
[23:49] when you're living like the world
[23:52] you're not qualified
[23:54] you don't know what the grace of god is
[23:56] because you can say all the things
[23:57] that's talked about in the message that
[23:59] just was judgmental that's not the grace
[24:01] of god you don't know what grace is
[24:04] we've got some lovely sisters here who
[24:06] feel the same way that i do they only
[24:08] seen it as god's grace
[24:10] you honestly think they would be sitting
[24:12] here wearing what they're wearing
[24:13] following filled with the holy spirit
[24:15] and following this because of me i
[24:18] guarantee you they wouldn't follow it
[24:19] because of me because of some worldly
[24:21] dress code
[24:24] you know what they see it as
[24:26] it's the grace of god
[24:29] i'm thankful for his grace i didn't i'd
[24:32] unmerited favor i didn't the favor of
[24:34] god came and told me how to be a woman
[24:38] not me you girls
[24:43] read in between the lines here
[24:46] so there the grace of god come and told
[24:48] me
[24:49] you sisters it's a revelation
[24:52] how to be a woman and was that needed
[24:54] for god to come and speak what a woman
[24:56] really is i'd say so because we have a
[24:58] supreme court justice candidate that
[25:01] can't answer the question
[25:03] about what a woman is
[25:05] that's right won't answer it can't
[25:08] answer it that's how messed up people's
[25:11] minds are
[25:12] i know she's doing it political because
[25:14] she can't say that but i really believe
[25:16] there's people there's young a
[25:17] generation that can't define i said
[25:19] honey can you imagine
[25:22] can you imagine
[25:24] can't even give the definition of a
[25:26] woman anymore
[25:28] i'd say the grace of god sent us a
[25:30] message to give a clear definition of of
[25:33] the glories of what a woman is and the
[25:35] glories of what a man is to rory restore
[25:38] us back
[25:41] and i got some sisters thanks be to god
[25:43] here sitting and listening it's not
[25:45] legalism it's not a pastor harping on
[25:48] them they said the grace of god has come
[25:50] to us in the last days and i'm totally
[25:52] comfortable with living it
[25:54] somebody say praise the lord
[25:57] [Applause]
[26:00] this isn't legalism this is the grace of
[26:02] god
[26:06] you have to forgive me this morning for
[26:08] taking my time
[26:11] i'm going to let it out praise the lord
[26:13] because i've been laboring and wrestling
[26:15] with the angel since friday night
[26:17] till two in the morning last night all
[26:18] day yesterday
[26:20] just laboring
[26:21] because i just say lord
[26:23] i want to bring this
[26:26] so that people can see it
[26:35] when we really see what god has sent us
[26:37] clearly with eyesight we call it what it
[26:39] is and they're calling it grace grace
[26:42] shoutings of grace they're pretty
[26:43] excited about it
[26:44] now that's a reference back to when they
[26:46] laid the cornerstone for the rebuilding
[26:47] of the temple and the bible says back
[26:48] there in ezra that when they laid that
[26:51] cornerstone there was some shouting and
[26:52] worship going on
[26:54] just when they laid the cornerstone of
[26:55] it they were shouting they just they
[26:57] just took they're just starting they're
[26:59] just starting and they lay that
[27:00] cornerstone in to begin the temple and
[27:02] the place was so loud they couldn't even
[27:04] hear the shouting the worship the
[27:06] glories read your bible
[27:09] there's no temple yet but just the
[27:10] beginning of it we're headed in that
[27:12] direction
[27:15] now we talk about the last days at the
[27:17] headstone when he's restored all of the
[27:19] word of god when he's opened up the
[27:21] seven seals when he's given his word to
[27:23] the people when he comes as a bloody
[27:25] lamb with the book in his hand and says
[27:27] your name is in here read it
[27:32] and there's not going to be worship
[27:34] going on you're going to sit there and
[27:36] go oh isn't that really good and some
[27:38] intellectual stimulation no there was
[27:40] shoutings
[27:41] grace has come to us
[27:43] [Applause]
[27:44] grace has come to us
[27:46] praise the lord
[27:48] somebody say praise the lord
[27:51] so
[27:52] the response from this little group in
[27:54] the last days the worship the shouts
[27:57] what is this it's the grace of the lord
[27:59] that has come now i want to come into
[28:02] uh
[28:04] something brother jason referred to
[28:06] like i told you i got about 100 sermons
[28:08] out of what those guys preached
[28:11] god puts
[28:12] this second eve
[28:14] in the end time
[28:16] and he places her in the most deceptive
[28:18] time
[28:21] and he gives satan full sway and
[28:23] actually allows him
[28:25] prophet said i'm going to give him 6 000
[28:27] years and i'm going to let him bring his
[28:29] own eden on earth
[28:31] satan's eden
[28:33] now he wouldn't be doing this god
[28:34] allowed it
[28:37] god says all right you know i i've
[28:39] already began the process of redemption
[28:41] for my people even after the garden and
[28:44] i'll talk about a little later god's
[28:45] already after their fall and the
[28:46] condition they couldn't get themselves
[28:48] they're hiding in the bushes and right
[28:50] away god's running towards them saying
[28:52] where are you
[28:53] i want fellowship
[28:55] where are you at
[28:56] what is that the grace of god
[28:59] they're hiding and adam and eve probably
[29:00] would have still been hiding in the
[29:01] bushes except god came to them
[29:04] and said where are you come out of those
[29:05] bushes
[29:06] stop hiding in your guilt
[29:09] throw some skins to him says listen i
[29:11] want to find a place i haven't went to
[29:13] calvary yet but i'm going to find a
[29:14] place so we can get back to some
[29:16] fellowship here and it'll be through
[29:17] blood
[29:18] amen
[29:20] so that's what happened at the beginning
[29:21] but then we see
[29:22] we begin to look at the end time and see
[29:24] what's taking place now the process and
[29:26] we see that the second eve was put in
[29:28] the worst listen and oh just feeble
[29:31] words to explain what we're living in
[29:32] but i remember him saying look at
[29:34] brother jason saying listen
[29:37] he called it a double whammy i'm going
[29:39] to call it like a
[29:40] a 20 20 whammy because the conditions
[29:43] that god said i would allow my people to
[29:45] live in
[29:46] is
[29:47] extreme condition i don't even know a
[29:49] word to describe it
[29:51] and he allows
[29:53] satan to bring this eden and he says i'm
[29:56] going to have a people a second eat this
[29:57] is how he words it in satan eden he said
[30:00] he is allowed
[30:01] and he said this age is what it is today
[30:04] to prove to satan
[30:07] that this eve
[30:08] is not like the first eve
[30:10] she's not going to fall
[30:13] but it's not like back then when the
[30:14] whole garden was innocent and there was
[30:16] there was only the serpent there but
[30:17] everything was a need and that's that's
[30:19] not that difficult and she still fell
[30:22] now
[30:23] satan i'm gonna allow you
[30:25] to
[30:28] bring a world
[30:30] i don't like to use the word create
[30:31] because he's just a perverter but have
[30:33] your sway and have your way that by the
[30:36] year 2022
[30:38] it will be so deceptive
[30:41] satan is given full sway
[30:43] the full impact
[30:45] of the culmination of the antichrist
[30:48] spirit will be in this hour
[30:51] christianity will be perverted that
[30:53] people don't even know what true
[30:55] christianity is anymore
[30:57] governments will be controlled by the
[30:58] devil
[31:00] politics will be controlled by the devil
[31:03] artificial intelligence ai will control
[31:06] minds how many know that's going on
[31:09] how many know that when you say
[31:10] something and you get an advertisement
[31:12] on your phone 10 minutes later
[31:16] trying to pick up on what you like
[31:17] trying to pick on so
[31:19] we have no privacy
[31:21] now they're they're going to advertise
[31:23] you
[31:24] see so now this is the invasion of the
[31:27] minds
[31:28] to control the minds and sway them any
[31:30] way they want to sway them
[31:33] you see so you got a.i you got
[31:35] controlling minds and it's actually
[31:37] dictating like men are robots dictating
[31:40] almost every action we take as humans
[31:42] hollywood does that because you had a
[31:44] young girl or a young guy don't know who
[31:46] they are yet they're not going to look
[31:48] to the bible they're not going to look
[31:49] to the holy ghost so they take their
[31:50] cues from hollywood who's going to
[31:52] dictate this is what it means to be a
[31:54] man this is what it means to be a woman
[31:56] this is what it means to be cool this is
[31:58] what you have to wear this tattoo this
[32:01] ear rings it's going to dictate to
[32:03] people
[32:05] it's going to control their minds
[32:09] that's the age we live in
[32:11] christianity perverted they don't even
[32:12] know what christianity is in it
[32:14] dictating almost extra every action
[32:16] hollywood's filth perverting everything
[32:18] that's right and holy i should be
[32:20] getting more amens to this because it's
[32:22] the truth hollywood's filth is is is
[32:25] perverting everything that's right and
[32:27] holy they've been doing it for a hundred
[32:29] years
[32:30] porn
[32:31] porn
[32:32] filling minds of men and women
[32:34] pornography filling minds available at
[32:37] every
[32:38] turn
[32:43] and brother jason said he gives
[32:45] to the double whammy we're living in the
[32:47] days of sodom and gomorrah and the days
[32:50] of noah
[32:52] both at the same time
[32:54] so now you read your bible all the
[32:56] characteristics of the days of noah
[32:57] before destruction and all the
[32:59] characteristic days of sodom and
[33:01] gomorrha gomorrah before destruction
[33:04] all of that will get poured into this
[33:08] age and people still wonder wow i can't
[33:11] believe all this is happening i can't
[33:12] believe this is we have a transgender
[33:14] person that's a top authority in the in
[33:17] the military we got this and we got that
[33:18] mater the woman the woman or man
[33:20] whatever she is of the year
[33:24] i guess they say they got to say man
[33:25] slash woman of the year
[33:31] sodom and gomorrah
[33:34] the days of noah
[33:36] and then i could go on on perverted
[33:38] christianity
[33:39] people don't know what the things 33 000
[33:42] denominations within christianity never
[33:44] mind islam no never mind
[33:46] 33 000 pushing 40 000 excuse me
[33:49] denominations that all say they have the
[33:51] right way within christianity
[33:57] and we talk about all that
[33:59] and the influences of it and then
[34:02] you got the whole thing of
[34:05] hundred thousand thousand
[34:07] devils
[34:08] coming out of the river of euphrates in
[34:10] the book of revelation
[34:12] demons of persecution
[34:15] poured out upon the bride
[34:17] they were poured out upon israel during
[34:20] the nazism
[34:23] naturally turned up pulled out upon the
[34:25] people hitler the cruelty against
[34:28] the people of israel
[34:30] and those same devils in a spiritual
[34:32] realm now coming against the bride
[34:34] persecuting you so you may have somebody
[34:37] face to face that's laughing at you and
[34:39] persecute for what you stand for what
[34:41] you wear whatever you may have that but
[34:43] you don't see the two hundred thousand
[34:45] thousand demons in the other realm
[34:47] that's against you
[34:49] you only see this guy at work who's
[34:52] putting you down and laughing at you
[34:54] because you're reading your bible at
[34:55] lunch
[34:57] but you don't see two hundred thousand
[34:59] thousand religious devils from the demon
[35:02] of euphrates released on the bride in
[35:04] the last days you don't even see that
[35:08] and then
[35:10] depression
[35:13] spirits of depression and spirits of
[35:16] anxiety and spirits of fear
[35:20] i'm not belittling anybody what i'm
[35:22] trying to say today is that some of this
[35:25] the devil's trying to make us feel
[35:26] guilty of
[35:30] some of us the devil's trying to the
[35:32] devil's trying to uh put it on us and we
[35:35] feel guilt and we feel this and and
[35:38] thankfully we have an atonement brother
[35:40] kyle we have he says if you if you make
[35:42] a mistake if you sin go to him and
[35:45] repent he's faithful and just to forgive
[35:47] you that's all we got
[35:49] the grace of god that scripture says if
[35:51] i make a mistake i go to him
[35:53] but i'm not going to carry the guilt of
[35:55] the age that god called me to live in
[35:57] and start putting all this on me and all
[35:59] this stuff that is something that i did
[36:01] that i have to live with the rest of my
[36:02] life we're dealing and battling our
[36:04] young people are dealing with spirits
[36:06] that they never have before
[36:08] families are breaking up not simply
[36:10] because there's not sincere hearts
[36:11] sometimes but sometimes the devil has
[36:14] attacked that family in particular
[36:21] spirits
[36:22] depression
[36:24] anxiety mixed up christianity
[36:28] an image of the beast forming
[36:32] amen what a time
[36:35] government's controlled by the devil
[36:38] the days of sodom and gomorrah
[36:42] most of us parents would probably say if
[36:44] i had my choice i would have rather
[36:46] raised my kid in another time than sodom
[36:48] and gomorrah
[36:50] amen
[36:51] if you're a real parent say lord i wish
[36:53] it but guess what
[36:55] he's given us the token
[36:59] amen you say well i got an unsaved kid
[37:01] right now brother brown says you can
[37:02] pray and apply the token to that kid
[37:05] we got something friends his grace came
[37:07] to us in the last time just before
[37:09] judgment his grace you can call it the
[37:11] message in god but no but it's the holy
[37:13] ghost it's the it's it's the grace of
[37:15] god
[37:16] it said while you're there in satan's
[37:18] eden i will be with you even in you
[37:21] until the end of the age i will not
[37:23] leave thee i will not forsake your
[37:25] family
[37:26] i haven't ever forsaken your family it's
[37:29] just the times you live in but i'm never
[37:31] going to leave you

[39:17] yet god heard his prayer
[39:19] brother jason said jonah was down in
[39:22] that well and he says i'm in hell but

[39:36] children don't be silent and show them
[39:38] the word of god
[39:40] in an hour when they're getting all
[39:41] kinds of voices read the word to them
[39:43] teach them the message of the hour
[39:45] this isn't some man's teaching that
[39:47] you're teaching your kids to make
[39:48] legalists this is the grace of god
[39:50] that's been sent to them read it let it
[39:53] be in your homes
[39:55] god help me this morning
[39:57] the devil has made you call this
[39:59] legalism no it's the greatest thing that
[40:02] god has ever said to us
[40:06] and my dad he said if i found out that
[40:09] it was false at the end i'd still raise
[40:12] my children under this message because
[40:14] it's the best way to live in this world
[40:22] label it whatever you want to label it
[40:25] they called it
[40:27] grace
[40:31] all right let's
[40:32] so
[40:34] when i was having breakfast brother
[40:35] jason i don't want to plagiarize what he
[40:37] told me
[40:38] so i'll give the credit to him
[40:40] i got excited at breakfast on monday
[40:42] because he elaborated on this the whole
[40:44] deal
[40:45] he says in judgment day he's got the
[40:48] bride standing behind him
[40:50] because the bride will stand with him in
[40:52] judgment
[40:52] she's already been judged by the word
[40:54] we're being judged right now if you'll
[40:55] receive it through my preaching you'll
[40:58] take your judgment now
[41:00] you'll pass from death in your life
[41:01] right now or you can go to the judgment
[41:03] day i'd rather be here i'd rather god
[41:05] rebuke me take the height on my back
[41:08] judge my life convict me right now
[41:12] you go ahead and wait till judgment day
[41:13] you tamper and play with it oh this and
[41:15] you got one foot in the message in one
[41:16] fight you go ahead and do that i want to
[41:18] take my judgment right now
[41:20] i believe it right now
[41:22] but the bride will stand with him in
[41:24] judgment she won't be judged she'll
[41:25] stand with him and i wonder he says if
[41:28] god will look look at this little
[41:30] puny creature satan he says buddy
[41:34] i let you
[41:36] do
[41:37] everything
[41:39] i let you
[41:41] bring this world in six thousand years i
[41:43] gave you full sway
[41:45] to make it a satan's eden
[41:47] your playground
[41:49] a sodom and gomorrah
[41:53] a noah's day
[41:56] where the the where
[41:57] if you don't need your bible
[41:59] the sons of god saw the dollars of men
[42:01] that they were beautiful
[42:03] and they fell by the beauty of women
[42:05] and the women were dressing that way so
[42:07] the men fell
[42:10] so on that day first first you know
[42:12] let's just take a look at him for a
[42:14] minute i'm taking my time on this point
[42:18] he's in the judgment day
[42:20] and satan
[42:21] and god
[42:22] says listen i gave you
[42:24] everything
[42:25] and first of all we look at him over in
[42:27] the corner and it's like wow
[42:29] look at this guy
[42:31] isaiah 14
[42:33] it says
[42:35] this is how it's worn in isaiah 14
[42:37] lucifer and after it's all over we start
[42:39] looking
[42:40] and it says
[42:41] is this the man
[42:46] is this the dude
[42:50] that made earth to tremble and shook
[42:52] nations
[42:55] once we get to see this puny little
[42:57] creature
[43:03] the bible says they'll look at him and
[43:05] say
[43:06] is that the guy
[43:08] i fought all those years that's the puny
[43:12] little nothing that was whispering and
[43:14] accusing me all the time
[43:17] that's the guy that has supposed to have
[43:19] all this power and sway over me and
[43:21] tempting me and doing all this stuff and
[43:24] i listen to his voices and i got
[43:26] condemned and and you go on and on this
[43:28] is the dude
[43:30] the beauty little creature this is i
[43:32] that shook the nations and this is him
[43:38] and maybe the bride's looking and saying
[43:41] i gave him way too much time in my life
[43:47] i didn't grab ahold of the word quite
[43:48] enough for this devil
[43:51] because now that i see him
[43:53] i know god is more powerful than him
[43:56] come on can i get an amen
[43:58] now that i see this little squirt
[44:00] sitting in the corner is that the one
[44:02] that caused all my depression is that
[44:04] the one that brought me down is that one
[44:07] that brought condemnation constantly to
[44:09] me because of my mistakes
[44:13] is this the guy
[44:15] after all these i shouldn't have gave
[44:16] him that much time
[44:19] and so god goes on and says i gave you
[44:23] i gave you sodom gore i gave you i let
[44:25] all these things and then i put my last
[44:28] day's bride right in the middle of it
[44:31] and i just want to let you know satan as
[44:34] bad as you can make it she still
[44:36] didn't fall
[44:40] she made mistakes
[44:43] she got depressed she come under
[44:44] depressing spirits she went through
[44:45] things in her life she went through ups
[44:47] and downs she couldn't understand some
[44:49] things in the word it was all that's
[44:51] there might as well be truthful about it
[44:53] but in the end she can't fall because
[44:56] she's in the lamb's book of life
[45:00] what an insult to satan
[45:02] what a slap in the face
[45:09] but i did everything i could i know you
[45:11] did everything you could but she's up
[45:13] here and you're down here and i'm
[45:15] getting ready to cast you out
[45:19] [Applause]
[45:22] i wonder after he tells satan all that i
[45:25] wonder if he looks back at his bride
[45:27] standing with him and looks back to this
[45:30] him says do you realize do you realize
[45:33] what saying you what say you the bride
[45:35] of jesus christ and i wonder if they
[45:38] shout shout not it wasn't me no no they
[45:41] shout they cry
[45:42] grace
[45:46] grace
[45:48] no no no no i didn't do anything lord
[45:51] all the worthiness goes on you
[45:54] grace shoutings of grace grace
[45:58] grace
[46:01] if they're gonna if we're gonna shout
[46:02] that then we might as well shout it now
[46:04] we might as well say this listen this
[46:06] isn't works this isn't what i can do can
[46:08] you say amen if i make it into because
[46:11] he provided a way for you to make it in
[46:14] [Applause]
[46:20] grace
[46:22] grace
[46:25] say
[46:26] jesus says i let you with your own eden
[46:28] i let you go to sodom
[46:30] the climax of it the prophet spoke these
[46:32] words in 1963 we see this age that we're
[46:34] living in it's one of the grandest ages
[46:36] of all ages the laodicean churches is
[46:38] the grandest of all church ages because
[46:41] it's the ending of time and the blending
[46:42] of eternity so now let's notice now he
[46:45] says it's it's the grandest ages to live
[46:47] in did you know that you live in the
[46:48] grandest ages prophets would have loved
[46:50] to live in your age
[46:52] because it's the ending of time in the
[46:54] blending of eternity it's not
[46:55] necessarily a one day event
[46:57] okay now it's over bang no no it's the
[46:59] blending of eternity how is that
[47:00] happening by the preaching you heard
[47:02] last weekend
[47:05] because his people have to get an
[47:07] eternal view
[47:09] so he blends eternity and human souls
[47:12] that are time uh what do they call that
[47:15] a time we're creatures of time
[47:18] some of you have already looked at your
[47:19] watches and your phones and checking out
[47:21] your schedule for the week shame on you
[47:24] shame on you
[47:26] i don't mean to shame you but i say
[47:28] shame on you
[47:30] you got your schedule in mind you get
[47:32] this and you got a certain slot here at
[47:33] church and you know this
[47:35] shame on you what if god wants to stay
[47:37] all evening this evening what if god
[47:39] wants to save your children
[47:42] you're a creature of time
[47:43] and he's trying to preach you that
[47:45] there's something greater than time he
[47:46] interrupts our time
[47:49] eternal eternal
[47:55] i wonder if satan i wonder if god looks
[47:57] and says listen and and here's the
[47:59] grandest of all ages i don't know if you
[48:01] guys have that quote here's the grandest
[48:03] of all church ages because it's the
[48:05] ending of time the blending of eternity
[48:07] and then listen now because they don't
[48:08] have it up you'll listen closer it's the
[48:10] greatest sinful age it's more sin in
[48:12] this age than it's ever been and the
[48:14] powers of satan is many times harder to
[48:17] fight against than it was in any age
[48:21] here back in the early ages a christian
[48:22] could for his profession of being a
[48:24] church or belonging to christ he could
[48:26] be headed for it he could be killed and
[48:28] put out of his misery and go to meet god
[48:31] quickly
[48:35] some of them say well that'd be an
[48:36] easier way to go wouldn't it
[48:38] get it done get it over with
[48:41] but now the enemy has come
[48:44] in the name of the church
[48:46] and it's so deceiving this is the great
[48:48] age of deception when christ said the
[48:50] two spirits would be so close
[48:52] it would be deceived the very left if
[48:54] possible and see remember christ spoke
[48:56] of an elected people for the last day
[48:59] see it would deceive the very elect if
[49:01] it were apostles so close so close to
[49:03] people so live people can live in a holy
[49:06] people can live a clean holy not a
[49:08] sinful
[49:09] and not be sinful adulterers and
[49:10] drinkers and liars and gamblers they can
[49:12] live above all that and still not with
[49:14] still not with it
[49:16] satan i let you have full access and
[49:18] they didn't fall they're standing here
[49:19] with me in judgment redeemed are you she
[49:22] sherry wrote a song are you she
[49:24] are you she

[49:38] here

[49:59] i am now your very own is this the
[50:03] special chosen one we see
[50:07] are

[50:23] hands with these people that you're your
[50:25] brothers and sisters
[50:26] and you're you're amazed at them and
[50:28] they shake their hand with a brother
[50:29] tony what age did you come from sir

[50:50] grace

[50:57] the worst of sodom and gomorrah the
[50:59] worst of pornography
[51:04] grace grace provided away
[51:08] of temptation
[51:13] thank the lord
[51:15] you should be grateful for brandon
[51:22] this becomes a final victory shout of
[51:24] the bride grace shoutings of grace as it
[51:27] causes us to move our final mountain the
[51:30] mountain should become like a plane
[51:31] because of the stone it'll be by his
[51:33] grace we'll take a rapture another thing
[51:35] you know i just want to i won't have
[51:37] much time going this till next sunday
[51:38] but when when you see it as grace grace
[51:42] grace is not just some term
[51:45] but when you see this as grace and it's
[51:48] the grace of an unmerited favor and you
[51:50] have the favor of god and you didn't
[51:52] deserve it
[51:54] you have the favor of god to escape in a
[51:55] rapture and you don't really deserve it
[51:58] but grace is something friends that is
[52:01] that
[52:02] we did nothing for it and so it wasn't
[52:05] by our power or our might and if we
[52:07] really
[52:08] really
[52:09] have a true revelation of
[52:12] this is all his grace
[52:14] then it gives us grace
[52:16] for other people
[52:23] to me it goes together that the humility
[52:25] that says i didn't do nothing to earn
[52:28] this i didn't do nothing to get to this
[52:30] spot where i'm at today i didn't do
[52:32] nothing to make it in a rapture i didn't
[52:33] do nothing to have my name on the book i
[52:35] didn't do anything
[52:37] and when you have that type of humility
[52:39] i'm not boasting of anything except the
[52:41] cross of jesus christ when you have that
[52:44] then another sign that you have it is
[52:46] their grace for others
[52:50] it spills over jesus said even
[52:53] forgiveness he says if you can't forgive
[52:55] someone else then i can't release my
[52:57] forgiveness to you but when forgiveness
[52:59] is released and you really see how much
[53:01] you've been forgiven it's easy to
[53:04] forgive someone else
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] he even goes so much to say neither will
[53:08] i forgive you if you can't forgive
[53:10] somebody else
[53:11] you're tampering with the grace of god
[53:14] with an unforgiving spirit holding
[53:17] something 10 years ago that somebody
[53:18] said to you and somebody said 20 years
[53:21] ago and you're still holding on to what
[53:22] the brother or sister said
[53:25] it's called forgiveness
[53:27] we release it can you say amen
[53:31] i
[53:32] think that we need to go
[53:34] i'll get more into that in a second when
[53:36] we get into sodom
[53:37] oh my we gotta pick it up next sunday
[53:46] okay
[53:49] praise the lord
[53:50] hallelujah let's all stand
[53:54] raise your hands
[53:58] cry grace
[54:04] hallelujah
[54:08] hallelujah feel grateful
[54:11] you may be seated
[54:14] part two
[54:20] bob you didn't drive all that
[54:22] you didn't drive all that far did you
[54:24] just a little sir sermonette
[54:28] i won't be that long but i got i think i
[54:30] got to finish some of this here
[54:33] so i've been thinking a lot about
[54:34] repentance and grace
[54:38] and repentance
[54:40] we won't get into much of it that those
[54:42] go together those elements are there
[54:45] and with all the doctrine and everything
[54:47] god's blessed us with and all the
[54:49] revealing of the word
[54:50] the last
[54:53] even this weekend
[54:55] after all the glorious word then you
[54:57] gotta watch god come down sunday night
[54:59] and call for confession
[55:03] oh but we got all this hi we're just
[55:05] basking in the sun and it was glorious
[55:07] and then i'll tell you if you weren't
[55:09] here the sovereign god just came down
[55:11] and baptized this whole place
[55:15] and it was a call for repentance it was
[55:16] a call for confession
[55:19] why there's no moving of god without
[55:20] confession there's no change by the word
[55:23] without repentance these things are so
[55:25] powerful and listen now the entrance to
[55:28] the church the grace of god brought
[55:31] christ to calvary that was his grace we
[55:33] didn't deserve that so now out of his
[55:35] grace comes this power of the
[55:36] resurrection but still when they were on
[55:38] the upper room and they said peter what
[55:40] we do after they come out there what do
[55:41] we do repent
[55:43] so even with the grace of god of calvary
[55:46] you still couldn't enter in without
[55:48] repentance
[55:49] so he entered the church through the
[55:51] channel of repentance
[55:53] then when we exit in laodicea the last
[55:56] thing he says is be zealous therefore
[55:59] and repent
[56:01] so the entrance into the church with
[56:03] true repentance and our exit out of
[56:05] laodicea is true repentance
[56:10] you say oh but in revelations 4 after
[56:13] the last scene age he calls us up come
[56:16] up hither by a voice and the bride's
[56:17] being called up and i'm not making fun
[56:19] of that that's exactly what happened
[56:20] we're called higher but to higher
[56:23] revelations and higher seeing it higher
[56:25] he called john up higher voice called
[56:26] the bride up higher i agree but not
[56:28] without repentance
[56:30] what brother brahm says here in the
[56:32] later scene age but god is calling for
[56:34] another zeal at the end of leosia it is
[56:37] it's
[56:38] it is the zeal to cry
[56:41] you have that one god is calling for
[56:43] another zeal it is the zeal to cry
[56:45] i am wrong
[56:50] now who's going to say that he is wrong
[56:53] what is that all these denominations are
[56:55] based upon the claim to originality and
[56:57] that of god the claim that they're right
[56:59] now they all cannot be right in fact not
[57:01] one of them is right they are white as
[57:02] sepulchers full of dead men's bone they
[57:04] have no life they have no vindication
[57:07] god has never made himself known in any
[57:09] organization
[57:11] in other words you understand now he's
[57:13] not going to put his endorsement upon a
[57:14] denominational creed
[57:17] god may bless people god may heal people
[57:19] that's a different story it's god
[57:21] endorsing and god dealing through a
[57:23] denomination he's never done it and he
[57:25] never will do it
[57:28] they say they are right because they're
[57:30] the ones that are saying it but saying
[57:31] it does not make it so they need the
[57:32] vindication thus say the lord of god and
[57:34] they don't have it now let me say this
[57:36] here i don't believe that god is calling
[57:38] only the false church to a repentance
[57:40] which they won't repent i don't believe
[57:42] god is calling only the false church to
[57:43] a ribbon it's in this verse he is
[57:45] talking to his elect they have some
[57:48] repenting to do too
[57:52] no i've moved into revelations 4 where a
[57:55] voice says come up here that are unto
[57:57] all these revelations not without
[57:58] repentance you don't
[58:01] you can't come out of laodicea
[58:04] without true repentance
[58:06] what do i repent of people think of
[58:07] repenting all the time is my smoking my
[58:09] drinking my dressing in modestly i'm
[58:12] repenting no no you got to repent of
[58:14] your false doctrine that you believed
[58:15] before
[58:16] your denominational creeds whether it be
[58:18] baptist whether it be if it's a
[58:20] denominational creed not the truth of
[58:21] god's bible but if it's a creed and it's
[58:24] not bible you have to repent of that my
[58:26] your pentecostal background is not meant
[58:28] to come into this message
[58:31] you have to repent of that pentecostal
[58:33] background those pentecostal traditions
[58:35] you when you come to this word you
[58:37] repent of it and say that was wrong he's
[58:39] right i was wrong he's right and i'm
[58:41] going with the word
[58:44] i like what he says there they have some
[58:46] repenting to do too
[58:48] there's a change when there's repentance
[58:50] and gideon brought it up to me that the
[58:52] hebrew word or the greek word to
[58:53] repenting is to return
[58:58] so if you say sorry
[59:00] see i feel in your cheers because i want
[59:02] to get into a little series
[59:04] esau
[59:06] sought the place of repentance and he
[59:08] couldn't find it because god even has to
[59:10] give that to you
[59:13] he sought it with tears so i believe in
[59:16] tears i believe in being broken but
[59:18] because there's big crocodile tears
[59:19] doesn't mean there's repentance going on
[59:22] just because you're saying i'm sorry
[59:23] doesn't mean there's revenants it's
[59:24] deeper than just saying i'm sorry for
[59:26] what i've done
[59:27] it's returning lord return me back to
[59:30] the original take me back lord
[59:34] to what i from what i lost
[59:36] it means to return it means to change
[59:38] your ways that's true repentance so now
[59:40] when we cross over into the grace grace
[59:43] is provided for the entrance and grace
[59:45] is provided for the escape it's called
[59:48] 14 times brother branham calls it
[59:50] rapturing rapturing grace
[59:55] oh hallelujah
[59:57] rapturing what rapturing grace
[1:00:01] it won't be that it's a cold to live by
[1:00:02] and we live by that cold perfectly we
[1:00:04] make a rapture it's rapturing grace
[1:00:08] crying grace in the worst state
[1:00:11] in the worst state you can be in so now
[1:00:13] if you get your bibles you gave me a
[1:00:15] little extra time so if you get your
[1:00:16] bibles here noah chapter six so we've
[1:00:19] got the days of noah we've got the days
[1:00:21] of lot
[1:00:22] all right genesis chapter six the days
[1:00:24] of noah
[1:00:25] genesis 6. that's what we live in
[1:00:28] oh my
[1:00:33] verse six and chapter six and it came to
[1:00:35] pass when men began to multiply in the
[1:00:36] face of the earth and daughters were
[1:00:37] born unto them that the sons of god saw
[1:00:39] the daughters of men that they were fair
[1:00:41] and they took them wives of all they
[1:00:43] chose and the lord said in other words
[1:00:46] they didn't really technically get
[1:00:47] married to him then just took him and
[1:00:48] lived with him as wives
[1:00:51] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[1:00:52] always strive with man for that he is
[1:00:54] also flesh yet his day shall be 120
[1:00:56] years there were giants in the earth in
[1:00:58] those days and also after that when the
[1:01:00] sons of god came in unto the daughters
[1:01:01] of men they bear children to them the
[1:01:03] same became mighty men which were of old
[1:01:05] men of renown so now you have a
[1:01:07] generation coming out of this perversion
[1:01:10] and this marrying wives and sex sexual
[1:01:12] things outside of marriage now you have
[1:01:14] a generation rising up that become
[1:01:16] actually our idols
[1:01:19] our icons
[1:01:24] that the world will look to these are
[1:01:25] the renowned men these are the proper
[1:01:26] the ones
[1:01:27] angelina jolie these are the ones out i
[1:01:29] love what she wears ah and we can we
[1:01:31] gaze after them and that's the
[1:01:33] generation of these people who come from
[1:01:35] perversion before them
[1:01:38] and god saw that the wickedness of men
[1:01:39] was great in the earth and that every
[1:01:41] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:01:43] was only evil continually and it
[1:01:44] repented the lord that he had made man
[1:01:46] on the earth and it grieved you know
[1:01:48] what it's mounting up to here okay
[1:01:51] the judgment of god coming in a flood
[1:01:52] it's mounting up and it repented the
[1:01:54] lord that he and the lord said i will
[1:01:56] destroy man whom i have created from the
[1:01:58] face of the earth both man and beast and
[1:01:59] the creeping thing and the fouls of the
[1:02:01] air for it repented me that i have made
[1:02:03] them it's a good thing it doesn't end
[1:02:05] there the next scripture
[1:02:09] but noah
[1:02:11] found grace
[1:02:18] but noah found grace
[1:02:21] destruction's going to come
[1:02:23] but noah found grace
[1:02:26] he says here's what you need to do this
[1:02:27] is this is it i'm i'm speaking through
[1:02:29] my prophet you and your family will be
[1:02:31] saved he was hoping everybody would get
[1:02:32] saved they didn't repent so he builds
[1:02:34] this ark and does all this thing and
[1:02:36] then he enters in the ark god shuts the
[1:02:37] door and for seven days there was no
[1:02:39] judgment and for seven days nobody could
[1:02:41] get in the door was shut but his family
[1:02:43] was in
[1:02:45] you don't think that's gonna repeat
[1:02:46] again
[1:02:48] you don't think we're close to that
[1:02:50] it's god that shuts the door
[1:02:52] he says the last one that gets saved he
[1:02:54] decides that not you
[1:02:55] but for seven days they're going i
[1:02:57] wonder oh my goodness what's going on
[1:02:59] here i don't know we just obeyed god we
[1:03:01] just have to trust him it's the grace of
[1:03:03] god that told us to do this and we're
[1:03:04] sitting in this ark with all these
[1:03:06] smelly animals
[1:03:08] but we're living in his grace
[1:03:11] his grace and a prophet his grace told
[1:03:13] us what to do and here we are sealed in
[1:03:15] this arc
[1:03:19] and then
[1:03:20] trickle trickle trick
[1:03:25] hears it and it just comes if you ever
[1:03:26] get to go to sights and sounds and watch
[1:03:29] the noah they make it like you're in the
[1:03:31] ark
[1:03:32] you start to hear and then it just pours
[1:03:35] and that feeling that they recreate of
[1:03:37] being inside there when the storms are
[1:03:39] hitting and the floods are rising
[1:03:41] and you're living
[1:03:43] in god's grace
[1:03:45] that what a feeling
[1:03:47] i'm protected my children are protected
[1:03:50] is anybody getting this this morning
[1:03:53] you could have qualms with noah all you
[1:03:55] want you could argue like the scientists
[1:03:57] and say that's not scientifically we've
[1:03:59] never seen riemann before you can do the
[1:04:01] research on google and say noah you are
[1:04:03] a false prophet you're not nothing i
[1:04:05] don't believe you you're just a farmer i
[1:04:07] wouldn't listen to you anyway you can
[1:04:09] mock the messenger oh you want to but
[1:04:12] when destruction was over him and his
[1:04:14] family were the only ones who survived
[1:04:17] the judgment
[1:04:20] and
[1:04:22] there was a guy here years ago and he
[1:04:23] was kept fighting with me about me
[1:04:25] quoting brother branham and pointing and
[1:04:27] why do you have to do that
[1:04:29] so i was just sitting there thinking i
[1:04:31] said this guy every service he's out
[1:04:32] there meeting me and hitting me at me i
[1:04:35] don't even know i came i said to him one
[1:04:36] time i said why don't you start your own
[1:04:38] church he gets all mad
[1:04:40] why are you saying that because i said
[1:04:42] you know everything already
[1:04:44] go start your own you know i'll give you
[1:04:46] some chairs or whatever you need a
[1:04:48] pulpit
[1:04:50] just you know you just if you don't like
[1:04:52] this stop sitting around and being
[1:04:54] miserable
[1:04:55] i really say it to all of you and i
[1:04:56] don't want anybody to go but don't sit
[1:04:58] here and and be in between two worlds
[1:05:01] we know what we believe here we know we
[1:05:03] stand you're gonna be a healthier person
[1:05:04] spiritually if you choose what you
[1:05:07] believe
[1:05:09] and be happy about it
[1:05:13] god help me this morning
[1:05:14] i said to him the other thing i said to
[1:05:16] him i said all right i have one question
[1:05:18] was there any grace outside of noah and
[1:05:20] his message
[1:05:23] and his children are standing around
[1:05:24] he's standing around and daddy couldn't
[1:05:25] answer the question he just he was kind
[1:05:28] of like that
[1:05:31] nomination for a judge supreme court
[1:05:33] when she was asked what the definition
[1:05:35] of a woman is and
[1:05:36] uh
[1:05:38] uh
[1:05:39] and this brother he was just god bless
[1:05:41] him he didn't know how to answer that
[1:05:43] because there's only one answer to that
[1:05:44] was there any grace outside of knowing
[1:05:46] his message
[1:05:48] there's only one answer to that
[1:05:53] so you can have all the qualms with you
[1:05:54] want to
[1:05:55] but history shows itself
[1:05:57] and noah you know what they you know
[1:05:59] what when they finish the 40 days and 40
[1:06:01] nights and god sent a dove in the window
[1:06:05] and they were brought in olive
[1:06:07] and they'd survived the storm
[1:06:10] i just wonder
[1:06:11] if noah
[1:06:12] and his sons and his daughter-in-laws
[1:06:15] were shouting
[1:06:28] crying grace
[1:06:32] with it all you want to but at the end
[1:06:34] of the day
[1:06:35] it was his grace
[1:06:38] we better finish sodom and gomorrah next
[1:06:40] sunday but i'll tell you it's something
[1:06:42] because sodom gomorrah is on our day too
[1:06:44] and abraham
[1:06:46] i'll just mention it to you
[1:06:50] sodom and gomorrah was just before
[1:06:51] judgment i'm going down to destroy and
[1:06:53] god visits abraham and sarah
[1:06:55] and says i'm going to visit you
[1:06:57] according to summerlike time of life i'm
[1:07:00] going to give you a child like i promise
[1:07:01] reaffirms the promise to them
[1:07:03] sarah laughs in the tent behind him
[1:07:05] because she doubts
[1:07:08] and
[1:07:09] he said why did sarah laugh at me just
[1:07:11] now she said i did i didn't laugh i was
[1:07:14] lies to him
[1:07:18] you know this is serious
[1:07:23] but
[1:07:25] it was a different action than what we
[1:07:27] would expect
[1:07:28] it was the grace of god
[1:07:32] abraham i'm getting ready to go down to
[1:07:33] southern gamora i'm going to destroy it
[1:07:36] sarah just laughed at me but you know
[1:07:38] what
[1:07:38] my word is still true you're going to
[1:07:40] have a baby through that woman i'm going
[1:07:42] to visit her
[1:07:47] no sense in you criticizing
[1:07:49] sarah for doubting because every one of
[1:07:51] you have doubted
[1:07:53] every one of you have had mind battles
[1:07:59] but there's something greater
[1:08:01] than your doubts
[1:08:03] there's something greater than your
[1:08:05] mistakes
[1:08:06] there's a covenant there's something
[1:08:08] more powerful than your actions
[1:08:11] sometimes
[1:08:13] and it's the grace of god
[1:08:16] and i wonder after that incident and
[1:08:18] he's headed down there to sodom
[1:08:20] sarah runs out to hear abraham i'm so
[1:08:22] sorry embraces him honey i'm sorry i'm
[1:08:24] so sorry for doing that
[1:08:26] she said what do you think honey
[1:08:28] i just left my hands i wonder if she
[1:08:30] said grace
[1:08:33] grace
[1:08:35] i didn't deserve the favor of the king
[1:08:37] just then i doubted him
[1:08:41] but his grace let me stay in
[1:08:45] now the situation with lot is very
[1:08:48] squirrely
[1:08:49] because
[1:08:51] he wasn't really asking for god's grace
[1:08:53] he was down there as the mayor in sodom
[1:08:55] and gomorrah trying to help the
[1:08:56] homosexuals and trying to help them he
[1:08:58] had left abraham years ago and his wife
[1:09:00] wanted the fashions of
[1:09:03] sodom and gomorrah so she headed in that
[1:09:04] direction she swayed her husband because
[1:09:06] she wanted the fashions and so they're
[1:09:08] down there all these years this is
[1:09:10] abraham's nephew it's a family member
[1:09:11] he's not really he doesn't know
[1:09:13] destruction is coming he's trying to
[1:09:14] save the whole world here he's trying to
[1:09:16] help these
[1:09:17] homosexuals all right and so now he's
[1:09:21] been so integrated into that
[1:09:23] that even when the angels come and knock
[1:09:25] on the door and you know what happens
[1:09:26] they're trying to get to his own these
[1:09:29] two men angels to you know the story and
[1:09:32] and lot is so perverted in his mind now
[1:09:35] i know the bible says
[1:09:36] the sins of sodom vexed his righteous
[1:09:39] soul daily
[1:09:40] but if you read the bible i'll give him
[1:09:43] that but he's a twisted man because he's
[1:09:46] become twisted by sodom
[1:09:49] please don't take these men these are
[1:09:50] these are messengers of god take my
[1:09:53] daughters instead
[1:09:55] that's the results of living in sodom
[1:09:56] and gomorrah
[1:09:59] that even a man who's angry about it in
[1:10:00] his soul he's still messed up in his
[1:10:02] mind
[1:10:06] you read the story i was reading here
[1:10:07] about three months four months ago and
[1:10:09] i'm going
[1:10:11] this man's not asking for grace and is
[1:10:13] he valuing the fact that the only reason
[1:10:15] he got grace is because the grace of god
[1:10:18] that abraham and sarah felt
[1:10:20] spilled over
[1:10:22] and they said when when he knew that he
[1:10:25] was headed down there and abraham
[1:10:26] abraham knew this is what's going to
[1:10:27] happen and you're not going to stop it
[1:10:29] the grace of god spilled over he's
[1:10:32] crying grace but he says my nephew's
[1:10:34] down there and i'm asking you if there's
[1:10:37] any righteous would you spare it
[1:10:40] so notice the grace of god is not for us
[1:10:42] to monopolize and
[1:10:44] give to whoever we want
[1:10:48] lot's only hope was abraham praying for
[1:10:51] the grace of god for him
[1:10:54] so don't stop praying
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:57] so he's he's he's saying lord if there's
[1:10:59] 50 if there's 40 if there's 30 and there
[1:11:02] wasn't even that in sodom and more there
[1:11:03] wasn't any
[1:11:04] except just slot and god spared a lot
[1:11:08] because abraham asked for it
[1:11:11] he extended grace but then you read the
[1:11:12] bible i know i got to finish i know
[1:11:15] you read the bible and it's like
[1:11:17] the bible says
[1:11:20] i pray that we would just look at our
[1:11:22] lives because i certainly don't want to
[1:11:23] be a lot
[1:11:25] i'm called to the mountain with abraham
[1:11:28] i'm abraham's seed
[1:11:30] but this guy he's got angels there and
[1:11:33] he says quick get ready he went and
[1:11:35] talked to his um
[1:11:37] his other family members his
[1:11:38] son-in-law's i think it was
[1:11:40] and he said to them we got to get out we
[1:11:43] got to get out god's going to destroy it
[1:11:44] and they had such disrespect for a lot
[1:11:47] their daddy
[1:11:48] that they just mocked him they said
[1:11:50] you're laughable get out of our home
[1:11:52] so there was no respect to daddy because
[1:11:55] daddy was a compromiser
[1:11:58] daddy never had a stronghold the woman
[1:12:00] ruled that house basically
[1:12:03] they moved to sodom because she wanted
[1:12:04] the fashions
[1:12:06] she was ruling the roost
[1:12:11] so he asked his son and i said let's go
[1:12:14] no no hey listen they mocked it as if it
[1:12:16] was just a joke so he runs back and the
[1:12:18] angels say we got to go now we got to go
[1:12:20] now get your stuff you know what the
[1:12:21] bible says that lot lingered
[1:12:25] i read that i'm going what in the world
[1:12:27] are you doing
[1:12:30] what do you have to tie up before you
[1:12:32] leave here
[1:12:34] what business
[1:12:35] i don't even know what that means that
[1:12:37] he lingered destruction is coming and
[1:12:40] he's lingering what are you doing like
[1:12:42] this is all going to be destroyed what
[1:12:44] you need to be doing now is grabbing
[1:12:45] your daughters and heading out that door
[1:12:49] but he lingered
[1:12:51] so much so the angels because of the
[1:12:53] grace that was ministered by abraham
[1:12:56] they didn't have to do this this guy's
[1:12:57] lingering he's not really interested he
[1:12:59] doesn't see the grace of god at all he's
[1:13:02] lingering they had to grab lot's hand
[1:13:05] they grabbed his hand and his his wife
[1:13:08] and daughters and they had to lead them
[1:13:10] out of the city
[1:13:12] themselves
[1:13:13] because he was so messed up in his mind
[1:13:16] he didn't see and that's why i see a lot
[1:13:18] of people don't see the grace of god
[1:13:20] they don't see it when it hits them it's
[1:13:22] throwing them a lifeline and they don't
[1:13:23] see it
[1:13:25] they're not going to come to the altar
[1:13:26] they're not going to repent because they
[1:13:28] don't see what grace is
[1:13:30] but when it hits you and when you see it
[1:13:32] you better respond
[1:13:34] because not everybody not everybody's
[1:13:36] going to respond not everybody's going
[1:13:37] to get it but lots being offered because
[1:13:39] of it and then i got to finish with this
[1:13:42] if there is such a thing as finishing
[1:13:43] this sermon
[1:13:47] he leads them out and so they're going
[1:13:49] to destroy all the cities
