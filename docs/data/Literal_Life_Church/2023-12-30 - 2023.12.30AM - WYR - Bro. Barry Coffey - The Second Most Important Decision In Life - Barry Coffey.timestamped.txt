[1:52] gather down to your hands in Jesus
[1:54] Christ's
[1:55] name
[1:56] amen let's read from the scripture
[2:00] thanks thanks hey got it buddy yeah okay
[2:03] go did you just go on sit down there get
[2:05] in your
[2:06] wheelchair Proverbs 1822 you're welcome
[2:08] to read it from the board Proverbs
[2:11] 18:22 who so findeth a
[2:15] wife findeth a good thing and
[2:20] a
[2:23] hey who so findeth a wife findeth a good
[2:26] thing and obtaineth the favor of the
[2:29] Lord may God add his Blessing to the
[2:32] reading of his word you may be
[2:38] seated all right I have a
[2:44] timer some of you may know notice I I
[2:48] often carry I'm sure you probably
[2:50] haven't but I carry around this black
[2:52] book because it looks like a Bible and
[2:54] and sometimes it's just easier for me to
[2:56] uh carry that around but en and I have a
[2:58] bunch of questions and these are
[3:00] questions that have have gathered
[3:02] accumulated from youth all over the
[3:04] world places I go and they want to have
[3:06] a youth meeting and so forth and we
[3:07] usually do questions and answers a Q&A H
[3:10] we didn't do one here but we usually do
[3:13] Q&A and I keep these questions because
[3:15] and I don't put names of countries on
[3:17] them or anything else or male or female
[3:19] because what what I've found over the
[3:21] years and Paul and I have talked about
[3:23] this turn me down just a shape will you
[3:24] just a shape um what what we found is
[3:27] that wherever we go and wherever we talk
[3:29] to young people the concerns they have
[3:32] generally uh are are very similar uh to
[3:37] you know regardless of what country
[3:39] they're in and they generally fall into
[3:41] two categories and one of them is about
[3:44] what they should be doing in life
[3:45] finding the will of God you know what
[3:47] should I be working at how do I know
[3:49] that I'm working the right thing and how
[3:50] do I know I'm doing the right thing and
[3:53] uh that's a very common question and
[3:55] that's a normal question because that's
[3:57] that's the point in life you're at okay
[3:59] okay the second question though has to
[4:01] do with relationships and how do I know
[4:03] when I found the right person how do I
[4:05] know when uh you know this is this is
[4:08] the right the right person when I was
[4:10] single I asked my brothers that question
[4:12] which was a foolish thing but I asked
[4:14] him I said how did you know uh that uh
[4:17] you know sister Brenda was the person
[4:20] for you how did you know and my oldest
[4:23] brother being I falsely assume was the
[4:26] wiser he said well I just knew I said '
[4:30] it's not really an
[4:31] answer and so I went to my next oldest
[4:34] brother and falsely assumed that he'd
[4:36] know what he's talking about and I said
[4:38] how did you know that uh sister Moren
[4:40] was the right one for you and he said
[4:42] well I just
[4:44] knew I said you're both
[4:48] losers and uh so I you know I I I
[4:53] thought about that and I thought wow
[4:54] there must be some something a little
[4:57] more than that there's probably
[5:00] something in the Bible about that nobody
[5:02] had ever taught me anything about that
[5:04] and uh so one year after I was married
[5:07] and had kids I was at Louisiana Camp I
[5:08] was speaking there and some uh young
[5:10] girl came up to me and said brother
[5:12] Barry as I was I was doing a a thing on
[5:14] courtship and uh she said brother
[5:17] Barry he said how did you know Sister
[5:19] Becky was the right one I said I just
[5:22] knew it was love at first sight do you
[5:25] believe in love at first
[5:28] sight
[5:32] huh all right brother Braham said when
[5:35] Adam saw Eve it was love at first sight
[5:38] brother bam said when Isaac saw Rebecca
[5:40] what what' you
[5:44] say you're a legalist that's your
[5:49] trouble when when Isaac saw Rebecca
[5:53] brother Bram said it was love at first
[5:54] sight brother Braham said when Jesus
[5:56] sees the bride in person it'll be love
[5:58] at first sight when I saw sister Becky
[6:01] it was love at first sight so it is a
[6:03] certainly a scriptural thing however now
[6:06] uh you're not supposed to propose when
[6:07] you make that first
[6:09] connection I wanted to but uh her father
[6:12] was there
[6:13] so so that is the second question that
[6:16] people ask and and it's a very important
[6:18] question very powerful one and one
[6:20] that's going to affect you for the rest
[6:21] of your life so for a few minutes I want
[6:23] to talk about this second most important
[6:25] decision in your life but first let me
[6:27] preempt that and say what is the most
[6:29] important important decision in your
[6:30] life now either you have to give me a
[6:32] clicker or I got to say
[6:35] next what do you want me to
[6:38] do clicker I like clickers I like
[6:41] clickers a whole lot better so we want
[6:43] to look at uh what is the first most
[6:46] important decision in your life does
[6:47] anybody want to Hazard to guess what the
[6:49] most important decision in your life is
[6:51] yeah red big red stand up big red there
[6:54] you go accept the Lord Jesus yeah
[6:56] wonderful that's
[6:58] right
[7:07] okay okay
[7:11] next I believe that the most important
[7:14] thing in any life is to entertain Jesus
[7:15] Christ properly in the first place in
[7:18] your worship first place in your uh life
[7:22] first place in everything go give that
[7:25] to somebody will
[7:27] you Jesus Christ deserves that place and
[7:30] me I believe with all my heart lots of
[7:32] places and in many different ways
[7:33] brother brandom says that's the most
[7:35] important decision in your life and you
[7:36] got to get that right okay so I call it
[7:39] the vertical you have to get the
[7:41] vertical right first if you don't do
[7:42] anything else right get that right you
[7:45] have to have a relationship with Christ
[7:46] you have to have an encounter with him
[7:48] and it has to turn into a Life coming
[7:51] out of you right which is the Life of
[7:53] Christ it's all about developing
[7:54] character God's always interested in
[7:56] developing character in you because
[7:59] that's the the only thing you're going
[7:59] to take with you and the thing you leave
[8:01] behind is your legacy so when I leave
[8:04] here when I leave here whenever I leave
[8:07] behind a legacy a legacy of uh having
[8:10] the yeah sure it a legacy of doing
[8:14] really uh carnal things with Paul in the
[8:16] usri cheet over all these years uh the
[8:18] video has went viral the snowball fight
[8:20] last night it's gone viral so would you
[8:23] give that to
[8:25] somebody um so uh it is a it is a very
[8:28] important and you have to get this right
[8:30] okay hear me you have to get this right
[8:33] the next thing though is this you have
[8:36] to deal with people who are within the
[8:38] body and people who are without so you
[8:40] got to Be an Effective witness to people
[8:43] outside about what this message really
[8:44] is and as a matter of fact according to
[8:47] the book of Timothy you have to be an
[8:49] example don't talk I'm talking uh you
[8:53] were they were trading notes back there
[8:55] um what what what Timothy says is that
[8:58] we have have to be an
[9:02] example of the Believers in faith Purity
[9:06] conscience and so forth right that's
[9:08] what we have to be we have to be an
[9:10] example of the Believers and we we
[9:14] therefore in in a sense we should be
[9:16] able to point to any one of you and say
[9:19] stand up this is what the message
[9:21] produces that's what we should be able
[9:23] to do unashamedly and say if I'm a
[9:26] Christian I'm a believer I'm identified
[9:28] then we should be able to point you and
[9:29] say here's an example of what God's
[9:31] produced in the last day and this last
[9:32] crop okay and that's what we should be
[9:35] so God's always interested in developing
[9:37] character in you and the Legacy that we
[9:39] leave behind is our testimony and our
[9:43] you know the uh the our exploits and the
[9:45] things we've done and all of that so
[9:47] that's really important for us to think
[9:49] about okay because those are two things
[9:51] you can't take anything else with you so
[9:53] wherever I go in the world and Paul will
[9:54] tell you the same thing these ministers
[9:56] will tell you and young people get
[9:57] together they want to know basically
[9:59] questions surrounding those two things
[10:01] and they're very important in life so if
[10:05] we understand is everybody okay on what
[10:07] the most important thing is in your life
[10:09] that's that's the first most now the
[10:12] second the the the other thing that I
[10:15] next the other thing that I want to just
[10:17] reference here in Proverbs 22 it says
[10:20] remove not the ancient
[10:22] Landmark which thy fathers have set so
[10:25] God's placed his word uh in front of us
[10:29] and we darent not move
[10:32] it you have no right or jurisdiction to
[10:37] take the landmarks that God has
[10:38] established and just move them over here
[10:41] because you know what in that church
[10:44] that's what they do so we're going to do
[10:45] it like that church over there or that's
[10:48] the way I did it when I was uh you know
[10:50] in the world so you know you're going to
[10:53] try to move around landmarks and and
[10:55] that's not possible in God's economy you
[10:59] can't move the landmark so if God
[11:00] established a
[11:02] landmark if God put things in place you
[11:04] got to leave them there and you got to
[11:06] deal with it okay you got to stay within
[11:08] that boundary boundaries are good
[11:10] boundaries protect you and it's really
[11:13] important for you to pay attention to
[11:14] where those boundaries are now the
[11:17] reason this series came up is because
[11:19] next someone asked me about the question
[11:21] of vows vows are real important let me
[11:24] pause a minute on vows because uh in the
[11:28] eyes of God
[11:29] uh there are things said in the
[11:31] beginning of the Bible the middle of the
[11:32] Bible and the end of the Bible about
[11:34] vows when th vows The Vow unto God defer
[11:36] not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in
[11:39] fools pay that which thou Hast owed and
[11:43] it and better is it that thou should not
[11:46] vow then thou should vow and not
[11:50] pay so better off don't even enter into
[11:53] a vow if you're not going to pay
[11:55] it but if you do enter into a vow you
[11:59] got to pay
[12:00] it this is a vow this represents a vow
[12:05] right an engagement ring represents a
[12:09] vow so I'm warning you this morning this
[12:12] is the one thing that you need to hear
[12:14] and hear very clearly don't you enter
[12:16] into agreements or engagements unless
[12:19] you're sure this is the
[12:22] one because you don't want to back out
[12:24] of it when you start to go find
[12:26] scriptures that give you permission to
[12:28] back out of an engage M you're going to
[12:29] be huh you're going to have a tough time
[12:33] and if you want to find quotes where
[12:34] brother Brandon gives you permission to
[12:36] back out of an engagement you're going
[12:37] to have a tougher
[12:39] time because he's very consistent in
[12:42] what he says about breaking an
[12:43] engagement don't say it doesn't happen
[12:45] in our message Community it does and I
[12:48] know situations I know young girls that
[12:50] were left brother brandom had them in
[12:52] his church where a young boy rolled in
[12:55] you know look like a Believer act like a
[12:56] Believer uh sang like a believer smell
[12:59] like a Believer went to all the camps
[13:00] like a Believer got engaged to a certain
[13:02] girl and then figured out he didn't want
[13:04] to be married to that girl and flew the
[13:05] coupe now we got a 20-year-old engaged
[13:08] girl uh who's now not engaged
[13:11] anymore and let me tell you that's what
[13:13] I referred to as a pastor's nightmare
[13:16] it's a difficult thing because naturally
[13:18] that girl is going to want to get
[13:19] married and it is a serious thing and
[13:22] you don't want to get to that place so
[13:24] when you when you decide yeah if this
[13:27] guy asks me then I will
[13:29] uh then you need to be real sure you
[13:32] need to be real confident that this is
[13:34] not just based on feelings it's not just
[13:36] based on looks it's not just based on
[13:38] anything else but you know it's the will
[13:40] of God the problem is when you get into
[13:43] a relationship with somebody and uh you
[13:46] know you're young normal healthy young
[13:48] man and you're sitting next to a young
[13:50] girl uh that's normal healthy there's
[13:52] all kinds of things firing off right
[13:55] there's all kinds of nerve endings all
[13:56] of a sudden you discover you had that
[13:57] you never knew you had
[13:59] and uh it's hard for you to be neutral
[14:02] and brother Ram said when we pray we
[14:03] should pray neutral right so it it's
[14:06] very hard for you to pray neutral in a
[14:08] situation like that because you got all
[14:09] your emotions you know leaning a certain
[14:12] way and uh you know you I know how you
[14:15] pray in that situations I did too you
[14:17] know Lord whatever your will is but I
[14:20] know but I know Lord that your will is
[14:24] that sister Becky be the
[14:26] one and Lord I've claimed her
[14:30] I put the token over
[14:33] her and Lord I want to thank you in
[14:35] advance for what you're going to do for
[14:38] me Lord you've never failed me yet don't
[14:42] this time if you don't mind you know
[14:45] what I'm saying that you you naturally
[14:46] kind of lean that way I did and and
[14:49] that's that's a very normal thing
[14:51] so despite the emotional uh involvement
[14:55] that you have here you got to you got to
[14:57] figure out somehow how to make this
[14:59] right decision despite your emotions now
[15:02] I just kind of gave you the girl or the
[15:04] guy side of things but the girls man
[15:08] they tend to be just a little more
[15:11] emotional about this so they have sheets
[15:14] of paper in their Bible that say Rebecca
[15:18] coffee Rebecca coffee how would I sign
[15:21] my new signature Rebecca
[15:24] coffee Rebecca coffee Becka Becky coffee
[15:27] Becky coffee
[15:29] oh wow that's so
[15:31] nice do you have another sheet of
[15:34] paper and there's you know all of a
[15:37] sudden we're subscribing to bride
[15:38] magazine and wonder what colors we'll
[15:40] have in the wedding and all the rest of
[15:42] it there's a lot of emotion wrapped up
[15:44] in this so you got to get people on your
[15:45] team that are not
[15:46] emotional and have them to be praying
[15:48] with you and for you because you're
[15:51] going to be stupid during that time
[15:54] you're going to make all kinds of stupid
[15:56] statements during that time but I'm
[15:58] warning you you don't want to make this
[16:00] one ill
[16:03] advised because you know what there's no
[16:05] repentance for marriage there's no
[16:08] repentance for
[16:10] vows so you can switch churches and then
[16:13] all of a sudden you realize whoa this
[16:15] was not a good decision I'm going to go
[16:17] back to my former church you can do that
[16:19] and God will not frown upon it you
[16:21] cannot repent of your marriage and
[16:23] believe me I've done a lot of counseling
[16:25] and a lot of talking with couples over
[16:27] the years ministered to lots of marri
[16:28] couples and I've had people tell me I
[16:31] wish we had never done it I've had
[16:34] people say to me and they live in kind
[16:35] of a quiet silent dread every day
[16:39] because they know that this is really
[16:41] probably not the best decision and so uh
[16:44] it it's it's a it's a thing like brother
[16:46] Joe over here he tells me all the time
[16:48] that uh you know when something's a
[16:50] thing it's a thing it's a real thing and
[16:52] so therefore you you want to make sure
[16:55] that you uh that you make the right
[16:57] decision uh during that time
[17:00] next now it's a serious thing when we go
[17:02] to choose a wife for the vows is until
[17:06] death let's say it together until death
[17:09] all right let's do it together until
[17:11] death I'm only saying what he said okay
[17:15] until death uh do we part that's how we
[17:19] should keep it in other words we're not
[17:21] going to move the
[17:22] landmarks you understand what he's doing
[17:24] god Set this in motion hey we're we got
[17:26] no right to move that a man in his right
[17:29] mind how many do we have no I forget it
[17:32] guys planning a future he should choose
[17:34] that wife very careful guys say it with
[17:38] me very
[17:41] careful and a woman accepting the choice
[17:43] of a husband should be real careful guys
[17:47] say it real careful it's the guys that
[17:51] start this off so we got to make sure
[17:52] they get it the girl should be real
[17:55] careful too in what she's doing
[17:57] especially in these days I wonder was he
[17:59] talking about our
[18:01] day so it begs a question
[18:04] next how can you know if you're making
[18:07] the right choice or what can we impart
[18:09] to you today that hopefully will help
[18:11] you make the right choice there are
[18:14] three guiding principles that I want to
[18:15] talk about real quick because I got to
[18:16] go
[18:18] next number One never marry an
[18:22] unbeliever say it with me never marry an
[18:25] unbeliever rule number one clear as a
[18:30] bale it's found in scripture how can two
[18:32] walk uh together L they be agreed and so
[18:34] forth all of those different statements
[18:36] it's really important now if you're not
[18:38] sure
[18:40] next then in ahab's wedding instead of
[18:43] marrying among his own people he went
[18:45] over and married a sinner an idolator a
[18:47] worshiper of I I iol he married Jezebel
[18:52] she was not a Believer and no believer
[18:55] should ever marry an
[18:57] unbeliever
[18:59] under no
[19:00] circumstances say it with me under no
[19:05] circumstances should always marry a
[19:07] Believer oh I think I can get them to
[19:10] the altar I think after we're married
[19:13] I'll just sweep him right into Malachi
[19:18] 4 they're a really good person and I
[19:21] think I think we can I think I can do it
[19:24] good
[19:25] luck don't play the game right I grew up
[19:29] in a home like I told you yesterday I
[19:30] grew up in a home where Mom and Dad were
[19:32] on different planets when it came to
[19:35] spirituality and it affected everything
[19:37] about our household it affected
[19:39] everything about their relationship and
[19:41] uh it's scripturally it's clear it's not
[19:45] right according to brother brandom it's
[19:46] not right so you got to you got to make
[19:49] sure you got to look and you got to be
[19:51] sure that you qualify that you
[19:55] qualify uh this this person person now
[20:00] uh I don't know why this is but go next
[20:02] if you will go
[20:04] next so what we're going to do is we
[20:08] just introduce and and this is a the
[20:11] word courtship here and I can't find
[20:12] another word uh so this is just simply a
[20:16] season when you meet a a guy or girl
[20:19] it's you enter into a season where you
[20:23] have an honest and open exploration of
[20:25] each other's lives you begin to look at
[20:28] that girl as a possibility of a future
[20:30] mate you look at that guy as a possible
[20:32] future mate and you're looking at their
[20:34] lives their beliefs their
[20:38] personalities you're looking
[20:40] at their desires their goals their
[20:45] families and how they live families that
[20:48] build and grow towards engagement and
[20:50] then marriage so you're you're you're
[20:52] not you're not engaged but you're
[20:54] getting serious about looking at that
[20:55] person as a possible candidate until
[20:57] then and it's really good for you to
[20:59] travel in packs like wolves so it's not
[21:02] oneon-one oneon-one oneon-one but you're
[21:04] moving in a pack you're with you know
[21:06] like uh that that table last night was
[21:08] in the dining hall and had nine girls
[21:10] and they invited one boy that's the way
[21:12] to do it that's the way to do it just
[21:15] chew that guy up and spit him out and if
[21:17] he comes back well a possible candidate
[21:23] here but you're looking you're looking
[21:26] at this person to qualify and see
[21:27] whether this guy's got it right you
[21:29] girls you want to look at a guy I'll
[21:31] tell you this and I don't have a lot of
[21:32] time to get into all the examples but
[21:34] I'll tell you this you girls want to
[21:35] find a guy that loves God he's got his
[21:38] own
[21:39] Bible and he doesn't sit in the back and
[21:41] fall asleep and drool but he's got a
[21:43] Bible and he's interested in what's
[21:44] being preached he's into it he's all in
[21:47] you want to find a guy like that because
[21:49] he's going to have to answer for you and
[21:50] he's going to lead you through the most
[21:53] difficult and complex time that men have
[21:54] ever lived on the earth and and you're
[21:56] going to need to put your trust in
[21:58] confidence in that person and uh you
[22:00] need to be looking at that guy and say
[22:02] does he know who brother brandom is is
[22:03] he only here because it's a free lunch
[22:05] after church right you need to you need
[22:08] to look at that guy does he have a love
[22:10] for the Lord does he does he know
[22:11] anything about the Bible uh does he you
[22:13] know is he does he pray is he is he able
[22:16] to pray does he work you want to look at
[22:19] that guy does he work is he does he just
[22:22] play video games does he think that the
[22:24] government's going to supply everything
[22:26] is he just spouting conspiracy theories
[22:28] or does he work I mean that's a good
[22:30] thing you guys like I said the other day
[22:32] in my devotional group stand up here you
[22:35] sometimes as pastors turn this way
[22:38] sometimes as pastors what we need to do
[22:39] is get the young guys take them by the
[22:41] lapels and shake them a lot just shake
[22:44] them a lot and say get your act together
[22:47] get a job save money you good save money
[22:51] because you're going to need it down the
[22:53] road and and you want to you girls you
[22:55] want to look at a guy who's not just you
[22:57] know nicel looking stand no don't don't
[22:59] stand up stand you want to get a guy
[23:01] that's you know he's he's got a mind for
[23:04] God that's what you want to look at and
[23:05] you want to guys you want to look for a
[23:07] girl uh that has more than just a black
[23:09] belt and MasterCard especially her
[23:11] father's MasterCard right you want to
[23:14] look for a girl uh who's not just you
[23:17] know when she's she's just into it for
[23:19] the looks right so she's dressed like
[23:21] this and if you could put words to the
[23:23] way she dresses it's like all right
[23:25] everyone I'm going to the bathroom now
[23:26] in the middle of service
[23:30] [Applause]
[23:34] hi
[23:38] sorry should I not have said
[23:42] that yeah is is she just there to
[23:44] present herself uh you know in a way
[23:46] that gets everybody attention why are
[23:48] you talking about this why is it
[23:49] important because of the value that God
[23:52] places on the promise and the engagement
[23:55] and the vows of marriage so they are
[23:57] important here here all right next so
[24:01] let's talk about some of the steps here
[24:02] to a Godly decision how do we do it or
[24:06] what can I leave you that prevent you
[24:07] from making a stupid decision a bad
[24:09] decision okay and I want to just leave
[24:13] this with you because I I got to go we
[24:16] want to start with a clean slate so what
[24:18] you want to do is uh if you've had ideas
[24:20] about uh you know things that maybe like
[24:24] how they do it in the world because the
[24:26] world is notorious for moving
[24:28] landmarks right when it comes to the
[24:31] word love the world has moved matter of
[24:33] fact the world has basically done away
[24:34] with
[24:35] landmarks right and now it's a
[24:37] free-for-all out
[24:38] there and you've got to make sure that
[24:42] you develop a real definition about what
[24:44] love is and what God meant what God
[24:46] intended there what the Bible declares
[24:48] well you got to get yourself a Bible and
[24:50] you got to let the word reshape your
[24:52] thinking and repent of any mistakes
[24:53] because we all make them and and you
[24:56] need to you need to say Lord Lord hey I
[24:59] I i' I've messed up I've made some
[25:00] mistakes but I I want to get on the
[25:02] right track and so Lord let the word
[25:04] reshape it I'll give you some stuff here
[25:06] and we teach this in our church here and
[25:08] uh it's it's uh it's a good thing for
[25:10] you to tap into some of the principles
[25:13] that are related to this second thing
[25:15] that you want to do is get people on
[25:16] your side so you want to have Pastor
[25:19] pastor's wife uh your parents maybe
[25:21] Elders uh somebody who can you can talk
[25:24] to about this uh important subject next
[25:26] and then thirdly want to establish clear
[25:28] boundaries so you as a young person you
[25:31] want to say uh you know this this is
[25:34] this is what I'm going to do and these
[25:36] are the boundaries that I have and you
[25:38] want to establish those boundaries and
[25:40] know where your weakness and limitations
[25:41] are some of you have weaknesses when it
[25:43] comes to the computer or social media
[25:46] pornography right you got to learn to
[25:48] keep those weaknesses covered Because
[25:50] You're vulnerable in that area and you
[25:51] got to know those uh weaknesses and what
[25:54] constitute a wrong setting and how to
[25:56] find appropriate activity because we're
[25:58] made like a car without brakes
[25:59] physically we're made like a car without
[26:01] brakes you know a car with brakes can
[26:03] stop anywhere but a car without brakes
[26:05] has got to be very careful how far he
[26:07] goes because if you're on the flat no
[26:09] problem but if you're on an incline and
[26:11] you get rolling they no
[26:14] stopping right so a lot of times and and
[26:18] I will tell you this I I was uh doing a
[26:21] a camp one time was all young people
[26:22] just like you and one brother came to me
[26:24] afterwards and he said he said brother
[26:26] Barry I have one problem with what you
[26:28] said today and I said oh and he said
[26:31] yeah you weren't strict enough you
[26:32] weren't strong enough in what you said I
[26:35] said really tell me your story and he
[26:37] said well he said I was the son of a
[26:39] pastor and my wife now was the daughter
[26:43] of a pastor and because we were
[26:45] preachers kids uh we got lots of uh we
[26:48] got lots of uh uh room you know we had
[26:50] lots of free time and we were
[26:52] unchaperoned there was nobody around and
[26:54] we spent lots of time together just her
[26:55] and I and then we got engaged
[26:58] and uh he said it was a long
[27:00] engagement
[27:02] pause I don't like long engagements
[27:05] myself now sometimes they're they're
[27:08] they're necessary but in this case they
[27:11] had a long
[27:12] engagement the feeling Creeps
[27:15] in well we're going to get married
[27:18] anyway so we can take a little liberty
[27:20] here and a little liberty there and he
[27:24] said when my wife got to the altar
[27:27] wearing all white because everybody
[27:30] thought she was a virgin and I lifted
[27:32] the veil off her head and kissed her he
[27:36] said she felt like a horrible hypocrite
[27:40] in front of that congregation because
[27:41] they had slept together because they had
[27:44] lots of Liberty they had lots of free
[27:46] time together and everybody trusted him
[27:48] because they were preachers kids and he
[27:50] said it took my wife 10 years to forgive
[27:55] herself for what happened he said our
[27:58] life was murder our life was terrible
[28:02] for the first 10 years of our marriage
[28:04] because he said she was so racked with
[28:06] guilt and I was too he said you need to
[28:09] tell these young people very strictly
[28:11] that they need to have boundaries
[28:12] because we're made like a car without
[28:14] without brakes and so therefore uh it's
[28:17] really important for you to set
[28:18] boundaries and if some guy you know uh
[28:22] he he wants to uh you know he's at youth
[28:24] retreat and he's you know he sides up
[28:26] and wants to get
[28:27] email address or that's the old days if
[28:30] he wants to get you know a social media
[28:32] thing and then he you know he reaches
[28:35] over and puts his arm around you wants
[28:36] to hold your hand or something you tell
[28:38] him I said to you go take a long walk on
[28:42] a short
[28:45] pier or go play in the traffic okay and
[28:49] if he doesn't if he doesn't you call me
[28:53] I'll tell them you know what's
[28:55] interesting I have had people call me me
[28:58] and I've talked to some of these guys
[29:00] that's the truth seriously uh you know
[29:02] you have a right to refuse and you need
[29:03] to know where all right this guy's
[29:05] crossed a line or this guy's wanting me
[29:07] to cross a line and I'm not going to do
[29:08] it you need to you need to establish
[29:11] those boundaries in your mind and in
[29:13] your heart but remember it's going to be
[29:15] really hard for you to do that when
[29:17] you're in the
[29:18] moment it's going to I tell you it's
[29:21] going to be next it's going to be really
[29:22] hard for you to uh resist and refuse
[29:26] because you're going to
[29:27] uh you're going to feel terrible when
[29:29] that happens I'll tell you you're going
[29:30] to feel terrible when that happens but
[29:32] you need to do that my wife and I you
[29:34] know we had we had boundaries and we we
[29:37] kept those boundaries and I I was really
[29:38] thankful and when I whenever I marry
[29:40] somebody uh I'm already married but when
[29:42] I perform a marriage let's say it that
[29:45] way I always ask the
[29:48] guy and my guys are here from hbt none
[29:51] of them are married I don't
[29:53] think but I always ask the guy before
[29:56] the wedding on the the wedding day when
[29:57] he's standing there looking like a deer
[29:59] between the headlights and he's nervous
[30:00] as anything and he's just dressed in a
[30:01] tuxedo and his future mother-in-law is
[30:03] telling him things and I always tell
[30:05] just shut up and don't say anything just
[30:07] just look pretty for the pictures that's
[30:08] all you need to do today just look good
[30:10] for the pictures but I always ask him in
[30:12] a private moment is this your first kiss
[30:14] at the
[30:15] altar because I believe that's where it
[30:17] should be brother bandam said in the
[30:19] countdown that's where it should be he
[30:21] said the first time you kiss that girl
[30:22] is when you lift the veil at the altar
[30:24] and I remember one time I was uh sitting
[30:26] with my two and my sister before I got
[30:28] married and we were sitting in the in
[30:30] the kitchen and uh she's not a Believer
[30:32] there two of them are believers she's
[30:34] not a Believer and uh so we were sitting
[30:36] there talking about marriage and for
[30:37] some reason or another I said uh to them
[30:40] I said um yeah this will be the first
[30:43] time I ever uh kissed Becky it' be at
[30:45] the wedding and it was in our
[30:48] conversation with my two brothers but my
[30:50] sister rolled in on that conversation a
[30:52] little bit late but she heard me say
[30:54] that's the first time I'll kiss Becky uh
[30:56] when when we're at the altar and she had
[30:58] just taken a mouthful of food and she
[31:00] went just like
[31:02] that and uh she said run that by me
[31:05] again I said well that's the first time
[31:07] I'm going to kiss Becky and uh she said
[31:10] what about if you don't like the way
[31:11] she's
[31:13] kissing that was her
[31:15] question I said what about if you don't
[31:17] like the way she's kissed and you've
[31:18] never kissed her before now you're
[31:21] stuck I said you know what you I said
[31:25] that's what the message teaches
[31:27] and I believe the message and I believe
[31:29] if I honor that God will take care of
[31:31] the rest and he
[31:37] did but hey either we believe it or we
[31:39] don't right and I I I believe I believe
[31:43] that's a landmark personally and I
[31:46] believe we don't have a right to move it
[31:48] no matter how emotional the
[31:51] setting
[31:53] next courtship is about seeking a made
[31:56] for marriage one man man one woman for
[31:57] life that's the idea one man one woman
[31:59] for life and it develops an honorable
[32:01] and respectful treatment of other people
[32:03] in case it doesn't result in marriage
[32:05] because sometimes when you move in a
[32:06] little closer and it doesn't work you
[32:08] know what that's the grace of God in
[32:09] your life because you can back away but
[32:11] you ought to be able to back away clean
[32:13] you ought to be back you ought to be
[32:15] able to back away without apologizing
[32:17] I'm not looking at you guys because I'm
[32:19] looking at you guys
[32:21] but and I I'm not picking on your
[32:23] anything else but I know there's some
[32:25] folks here that are you know looking at
[32:26] one another and and so forth and that's
[32:28] great but I will tell you if it doesn't
[32:30] work you ought to thank God for the
[32:32] consolation that now you know but you
[32:34] should be able to back away and not have
[32:36] to go to them sorry I put my arm around
[32:38] you and sorry I kissed you and sorry you
[32:40] should be able to do that walk away
[32:42] clean so you got to conduct your your
[32:44] your relationship with that girl at all
[32:46] times in a way that you can back out
[32:48] without
[32:50] regret and without having that girl to
[32:52] go tell some future guy yeah he kissed
[32:54] me and he touched me in this way and
[32:56] because a a girl should declare that to
[32:58] her future husband right and so
[33:00] therefore it's really important for us
[33:02] to keep that in mind and you develop
[33:04] that honor it's it's about honor and
[33:06] respect and those things are important
[33:08] here next the
[33:10] goal is to become ready or mature enough
[33:13] to enter into a commitment if it shows
[33:15] to be God's will so this is a time of
[33:17] testing now so I in my Curious way I
[33:20] went to Brother braham's uh daughters
[33:23] and uh I asked them I said what did
[33:26] Brother Bram tell you
[33:27] about you know meeting a guy what did
[33:30] Brother mam say to you and uh the answer
[33:33] I thought was very interesting and
[33:35] brother Bram said if you're going to get
[33:36] involved with a guy he should be a
[33:39] Christian number one and he should
[33:41] maintain a healthy distance at all times
[33:45] and this is what he
[33:47] said a a simple
[33:50] handshake after church maybe that's what
[33:54] he told the girls a simple handshake
[33:56] after church
[33:57] maybe now let me show you how a
[33:59] handshake doesn't go sister God bless
[34:03] you great to have you today at church
[34:06] hey you know what our church wouldn't be
[34:08] the same without you today you look
[34:11] really nice and M fact of all the girls
[34:14] that are here I think You Stand Out
[34:16] Among the
[34:17] girls yeah and you know what uh I'll be
[34:20] here next Sunday so uh you know maybe we
[34:23] could shake hands in the parking lot
[34:25] next Sunday too
[34:27] shaking hands doesn't take a half hour
[34:30] and brother brandom wanted to make sure
[34:31] that nothing got started because you
[34:33] know why we're made like a car without
[34:35] breaks and all of a sudden that girl
[34:37] starts to think things that she
[34:39] shouldn't think and uh you know uh it's
[34:42] just like if a guy rolls up to a girl
[34:43] here at the retreat and says hey you
[34:45] know how are you doing I no you're here
[34:46] at the retreat that's not a
[34:49] proposal and sometimes guys don't do
[34:51] that to girls because you know they're
[34:53] afraid the girl will whoa hello there
[34:57] there hello there yeah where you been
[34:59] all my life
[35:02] whoa praise
[35:08] God in the meantime next in the
[35:12] meantime you want to strengthen the
[35:14] inner
[35:15] man you want to develop your spiritual
[35:17] life with God right you want to you want
[35:20] to have a relationship with God that is
[35:22] real and like Joe says it's a thing it's
[35:26] a real thing and I have a living
[35:28] relationship with God and I want to I
[35:30] want to develop that because that's a
[35:32] season God's given me to do that okay
[35:35] and you want to seek opportunities to
[35:37] serve so I I got my guys uh usually
[35:40] started I had four boys we decide to
[35:41] have boys when we got married and uh I
[35:44] had all of them get tracked and start
[35:47] thinking about their careers and stuff
[35:49] uh when they were 12 13 14 going into
[35:52] high school and they were then I had
[35:54] them seeking God what gifts and talents
[35:56] is God giving in you what has what has
[35:58] God shown you as something that you
[36:00] could develop for the kingdom because
[36:02] whoo because that's going to be
[36:04] important here and you want to lean into
[36:07] that you want to recognize those gifts
[36:09] that God's given you lean into that you
[36:11] want to seek opportunities to serve you
[36:13] want to ask the Holy Spirit to be your
[36:15] elaser and reveal his will in season and
[36:17] don't enter into vows unless you're
[36:19] absolutely certain of the will of
[36:21] God I can't say it enough I can't say it
[36:24] strong enough because when you vow vow
[36:27] and defer not to pay it someone's not
[36:29] happy next and then on the last thing
[36:32] and girls especially you need to guard
[36:34] your heart because out of it are the
[36:35] issues of life and I wish we had more
[36:37] time to deal with this scripture but you
[36:39] have to guard your heart because you
[36:40] know Hallmark teaches us that you know
[36:43] you fall and fall fast fall hard it's
[36:45] got to be over an hour right so that's
[36:49] that's the way we're taught in our
[36:50] society and everything is very fast but
[36:52] in this case you want to do the opposite
[36:54] you want to do it slow and and you want
[36:56] to be real careful you want to next you
[36:59] want to keep the relationships out of
[37:01] the Romantic zone so you want to
[37:03] communicate from the start that this
[37:04] Association is platonic that it is
[37:08] friendship only and you make a friend uh
[37:11] make a friend a friend of the family and
[37:14] you want to avoid spending time alone
[37:15] like I said and then certain topics like
[37:17] longterm plans for our future you want
[37:19] to you want to kind of refrain from
[37:21] discussing dreams how many kids do you
[37:23] ever do you want to
[37:25] have
[37:28] and all these other kinds of things that
[37:30] suggest or lean towards or tend towards
[37:33] intimacy hey let me give you a little
[37:35] rule of thumb you can write this down if
[37:36] you're writing it
[37:37] down girls you can share this one over
[37:41] here in the
[37:44] world the practice is the mindset is
[37:47] intimacy comes before
[37:50] commitment intimacy precedes commitment
[37:54] it is the total opposite with us
[37:57] that commitment precedes
[38:00] intimacy so in the world they'll say
[38:03] well I'll date a girl I'll sleep with a
[38:04] girl I'll live with a girl uh we'll move
[38:06] in together and then if we like it we'll
[38:08] get married and I'll guarantee you when
[38:11] a girl feels like she's being tried out
[38:12] like a used car she's going to feel like
[38:15] that especially when he goes and trades
[38:17] in that model and gets another one it it
[38:20] is a moving of the landmarks and you
[38:22] don't want to do that commitment
[38:25] precedes intimacy we commit first and
[38:29] then all the rest follows okay that's
[38:31] the rule that's how it should be so we
[38:34] avoid certain topics like long-term
[38:36] plans and saving your uh you know your
[38:40] most intimate thoughts until later next
[38:43] we avoid counseling that creates
[38:46] dependency so sometimes a girl says oh
[38:48] he tells me everything he feels really
[38:50] he says he says he feels really
[38:51] comfortable with me and he can tell me
[38:53] everything and so therefore I feel like
[38:55] I'm helping him over this hurdle I'm
[38:58] helping him through this crisis that
[39:00] he's going through and so he needs me he
[39:03] needs me and you can get involved in
[39:06] that too
[39:08] much you know what if he's got a real
[39:10] dilemma if you got and I've seen it I've
[39:12] seen it where people have said that to
[39:13] girls and the girls have said you need
[39:16] to go see my pastor okay see you
[39:19] later because you know what the crisis
[39:22] was not really a crisis after
[39:24] all girls watch the way you dress
[39:27] because it greatly affects the whether
[39:29] guys view you as a friend or an object
[39:32] you had to be modest you had to practice
[39:34] modesty and that's that's just that's
[39:37] just basic stuff but it's really
[39:38] important because guys are affected guys
[39:40] are visual creatures I'm a visual person
[39:42] I'm a visual learner and uh you know if
[39:45] I if I see somebody uh you know build
[39:48] something and I watch them do it I
[39:50] remember one time I went to a a picture
[39:52] framing coming to get a picture frame
[39:53] for a church and they were going to
[39:54] charge like back then 00 something
[39:56] dollars I
[39:57] thought
[39:59] sorry but I thought wow that's crazy and
[40:02] I went and I got bought a book and I
[40:04] looked at how it was done and I did that
[40:06] and then I eventually uh started a
[40:08] framing picture framing company and so
[40:10] forth and you can send me your pictures
[40:11] I'll charge you two or $300 to get
[40:13] them but I'm a visual person and so you
[40:17] need girls you need to understand
[40:19] because you don't see this yourself you
[40:21] are uh you're um a lot of you girls who
[40:25] are right here and naturally beautiful
[40:27] and naturally pretty and so forth and uh
[40:30] you had to be careful how you present
[40:31] yourself uh and I'm not saying that you
[40:34] need to wear flower sacks not at all but
[40:36] you need to be careful about how you
[40:38] present yourself okay and and be modest
[40:41] guys also need to practice modesty as
[40:42] well next if you will so we're going to
[40:44] have I'm sorry we're going to have to
[40:45] wrap it up next oh no yeah things that
[40:50] are clearly not just friendship okay
[40:54] being alone a lot
[40:57] together saying I love you and other
[40:59] intimate comments that should be
[41:01] reserved I think until you're engaged or
[41:04] you're right there at engagement I think
[41:07] so despite all the little buttons you
[41:10] can push on your phone I think it's
[41:11] really good to say I love you to the
[41:13] person that you really
[41:14] love because that's a strong word now
[41:17] it's not in the world right it's not in
[41:19] the world in Hallmark is over an an hour
[41:21] but in but in God's world and you don't
[41:22] have a right to to move the landmarks
[41:24] that's what's really important here and
[41:26] holding hands hugging and kissing and
[41:28] looking with wanting eyes at each other
[41:29] and maybe even drooling I I got that
[41:32] from Paul okay
[41:39] next finding a wife means finding a good
[41:42] thing and the main thing your
[41:43] relationship with God has to come first
[41:45] if it doesn't then it's not all if it
[41:47] does not then it seems like all dos and
[41:49] don'ts it seems like rules okay but my
[41:53] relationship with him is not merely one
[41:54] of my relationship it it is the
[41:56] relationship by which I understand every
[41:59] other relationship does that make sense
[42:01] it regulates all others and if this one
[42:03] is correct and healthy it enables me to
[42:05] right be the right kind of a brother
[42:07] father husband and
[42:09] friend next brother bramman talking
[42:12] about Rebecca he said she was a virgin
[42:14] the beautiful Rebecca that married the
[42:15] righteous seed of God's promise Isaac
[42:18] that they were two listen two
[42:21] consecrated Spirit-filled Believers on
[42:23] God foreordained to the very marriage
[42:27] that they United together by and God
[42:30] forew it and if God forew it for them
[42:34] could you believe that God has
[42:35] foreordained somebody for
[42:37] you it's just
[42:40] possible
[42:42] next brother mam says a man nowadays
[42:44] getting married you young fellas you
[42:46] better pray a long time guys say it with
[42:48] me a long time say it again a long time
[42:52] you better pray and ask God to give you
[42:54] a companion you young women the same way
[42:56] say girls say it with me same way same
[42:59] way good because it's so uncertain and a
[43:03] man when he chooses a life companion he
[43:05] usually inquires of her life what family
[43:08] she's out of and her background we have
[43:10] to have a basis let's say that you're
[43:13] interested in a girl and her family
[43:14] doesn't go to church they're Believers
[43:16] in the message they're at the youth camp
[43:18] but they don't believe in going to
[43:19] church they believe it's okay to stay
[43:20] home and listen to tapes or it's okay to
[43:22] stream but now you're a person who was
[43:24] raised and going to church that's your
[43:26] normal she's got a normal that normal is
[43:28] different than your normal you know what
[43:30] we got to have a
[43:32] conversation and we got to have a
[43:33] conversation before we do
[43:37] this right CU you know what that might
[43:41] be a problem going forward and so we got
[43:44] to talk about that stuff and let me tell
[43:47] you it happens next and last brother
[43:51] Braham said now the king of Israel was
[43:52] ahab's son who had succeeded his father
[43:55] who had married out of the the Jewish
[43:57] people just like
[43:59] today when a Christian boy marries a
[44:01] sinner girl or a sinner girl a Christian
[44:05] boy don't you get
[44:08] married unless you're equally yed
[44:10] together with
[44:12] Believers to keep trouble
[44:14] down and when God made men and women in
[44:17] the beginning he made their Spirits
[44:21] then there's someone for
[44:24] you just wait
[44:27] say this with me I'll wait I'll wait
[44:32] because I'd rather be in the will of God
[44:35] than not be in the will of
[44:36] God Heavenly Father we thank you for
[44:39] your word thank you for the standards we
[44:41] thank you Lord for the boundaries that
[44:44] you have put in place may we always be
[44:46] the kind of people that respect the
[44:48] landmarks Lord in all of our decisions
[44:51] and choices we want to be found in the
[44:53] center of your will and we want to be
[44:55] doing EX exactly what you would have us
[44:56] to
[44:57] do but Lord in this area especially we
[45:01] want to be mindful and thoughtful of
[45:03] your will help us Lord in this important
[45:06] area I commit the young people now into
[45:08] your hands pray to Lord that they would
[45:10] go away maybe with some new insight into
[45:14] how important a decision this really is
[45:17] it is truly the second most important
[45:19] decision in their lives I thank you Lord
[45:22] for my wife I thank you Lord for our
[45:24] years together and our family and
[45:26] grandchildren Lord I Thank you for all
[45:28] the blessings that making the right
[45:30] choice brings and Lord I can truly say
[45:33] that when I found a wife I found a good
[45:35] thing and I'm thankful have your way
[45:38] Lord among this group of young people we
[45:40] pray we thank you for them for all
[45:42] that's happened here at the camp in the
[45:45] name of Jesus Christ we
[45:47] pray amen all right now everybody hold
[45:50] it I hav got time Adam where's Adam
[45:55] stand up
[45:57] all right everybody say goodbye to Adam
[45:59] say bye Adam he's going with me to the
[46:02] airport see you later God bless
[46:08] you yeah all
[46:24] yours
[46:27] thank you again brother Barry we
[46:28] appreciate it let's give him another
[46:29] hand we appreciate him give him good
[46:32] talk to us this
[46:37] morning I think she ESS essential things
[46:41] for life and um a lot of years you know
[46:44] teaching these things and the benefit of
[46:46] having many years of the retreat and uh
[46:49] having many generation couple
[46:50] Generations come through now is that you
[46:52] get to hear back the ones who kind of
[46:54] took these things serious and just said
[46:56] hey you know I'm going to apply these
[46:58] things and then they get 10 years into
[47:00] the marriage or even further and you get
[47:02] to hear testimonies back is that some of
[47:04] those essential things that we learned
[47:05] at Retreat and through our pastor as
[47:08] well um some of those things that are
[47:11] that we applied they're still enjoying
[47:13] the benefits of it uh many many years
[47:15] later the other bad side of it is that
[47:18] somebody comes back in a situation that
[47:20] they ignored these things and thought
[47:22] they weren't important love you buddy
[47:23] see you later love
[47:26] see you next year okay um so you get to
[47:30] see sometimes the negative side somebody
[47:32] said these aren't important they don't
[47:33] apply to me uh they move the boundaries
[47:36] or they just said uh you know they don't
[47:38] apply to me because I'm I'm all right
[47:40] I'll handle this on my own and when we
[47:42] start going down those Paths of thinking
[47:44] they're not important and essential to
[47:46] apply things like this then then you get
[47:48] to eat the fruit of uh things sometimes
[47:51] and it doesn't turn out good there are
[47:53] stories that are not good that come from
[47:54] ones who have been and and brother Barry
[47:57] kind of and AR kind of tease each other
[47:59] sometimes on the phone cuz we'll see on
[48:01] social media we'll see things happen and
[48:03] people you know uh you know kissing
[48:05] before marriage and doing and moving the
[48:07] boundaries and changing things even
[48:08] within the message and we kind of teas
[48:10] to say we ought to get together sometime
[48:12] maybe between Christmas and New Year we
[48:14] ought to have a meeting where we get the
[48:16] youth together and just talk about
[48:17] scriptural principles and and we we
[48:20] ought to have something maybe called the
[48:21] winter youth retreat we're being
[48:23] sarcastic because we've been doing this
[48:24] a long time but some people people
[48:25] who've been here don't think they're
[48:27] important they start think they're under
[48:29] different rules and then they be begin
[48:32] to eat the fruit of that and that's the
[48:34] negative side but there is a positive
[48:36] side there's a lot of healthy marriages
[48:38] and testimonies that come from good
[48:40] things it may be now in your life when
[48:42] God brings somebody it might be five
[48:43] years from now doesn't really matter if
[48:46] you're satisfied and that's the that's
[48:48] the thing in the first most important
[48:50] decision you must be satisfied and
[48:52] content with your walk with the Lord
[48:54] first because what happens if you're not
[48:57] satisfied with your relationship with
[48:59] the Lord and you're content with that
[49:01] then then you're going to replace a
[49:04] relationship with a guy or girl with
[49:05] what you should be getting from the Lord
[49:08] you see that's how we work as a human
[49:09] being we're craving something we're
[49:11] craving companionship and beyond beyond
[49:14] the sexual thing and passions where
[49:15] Barry talked about that's a part of our
[49:18] human being who we are but We crave
[49:20] something deeper than just uh being with
[49:22] somebody uh sexually in marriage or
[49:24] something We crave C intimacy We crave
[49:26] Oneness We crave relationship God made
[49:29] us a relational be being his first words
[49:32] was when he created ad it is not good
[49:35] for man to be alone and so he made us a
[49:38] relational being so he put a craving
[49:40] within us Adam was feeling lonely God
[49:42] put that in him for for for Eve for a
[49:45] companion for somebody close to him and
[49:47] so we all have that within us the
[49:49] problem is is that when we try to
[49:51] replace that craving for God with a guy
[49:54] or a girl and we shouldn't have that
[49:55] first that's why the second most
[49:57] important decision is who we would marry
[49:59] in life but the first one has to be
[50:01] filled you should be content you should
[50:02] be happy going along and when you're
[50:05] that way you're not making foolish
[50:07] decisions to jump too quickly into a
[50:09] relationship to make something happen
[50:11] with somebody you know we're we're
[50:13] pretty strict here as far as the
[50:14] boundaries and we bring the strict
[50:15] boundaries of the scriptures and
[50:16] guidelines we honor them when we teach
[50:19] them uh if you honor God's things uh
[50:21] even when the flesh don't want it when
[50:23] you honor it God's going to honor you
[50:25] God's going to honor your future
[50:26] marriage God's going to honor your life
[50:27] so we're pretty sick but I want to let
[50:29] everybody know brother Barry and I we're
[50:31] we're not against romance we're not
[50:33] against falling in love we're not
[50:34] against these things cuz you know if you
[50:36] meet somebody and you start to really
[50:38] become attracted to them that's a part
[50:40] of us too so we're not against that but
[50:42] when that is more important when that's
[50:45] more important than the essential solid
[50:47] things to make a decision for marriage
[50:49] uh commitment getting to know one
[50:51] another and and a lot of times when you
[50:53] enter into a physical thing to early you
[50:56] connect physically first when you're not
[50:57] supposed to connect physically first
[50:59] that's left for marriage so you you
[51:01] unite in Soul first do you believe the
[51:04] same do you believe the same message do
[51:06] you can you Fellowship around the word
[51:08] of God can you openly say what God's
[51:10] doing in your life you're with a guy and
[51:12] he never talks about that he never says
[51:14] anything about God he never says
[51:15] anything about the services he never see
[51:17] says anything about God correcting him
[51:19] never even brings it up uh you better
[51:21] girl you better back away from that
[51:24] because he should be able to talk about
[51:25] that freely it's not like he has to be a
[51:28] preacher and talk about it all the time
[51:29] but there's going to be if God is in his
[51:31] life God's going to pop up in his
[51:32] conversation and if it's not then you
[51:35] can't even connect with him in a soul
[51:37] level and that's where you got to
[51:38] connect first and example my wife and I
[51:41] is that we were already established in
[51:43] the word of God the new birth everything
[51:45] and so we quickly connected on talking
[51:48] about what was being preached talking
[51:50] about what the Lord was showing us it
[51:51] was easy to come into a union that way
[51:54] in conversation that was first and then
[51:56] you kind of connect the second way
[51:58] emotionally as you get closer you
[52:00] connect in emotional intim intimacy
[52:02] where you get to know one another you
[52:03] get to know one another's personalities
[52:05] and you start to connect emotionally if
[52:08] you jump the first two steps and in and
[52:12] introduce physical then you basically I
[52:15] shouldn't say abort but you you you do
[52:17] away with the first two steps and you do
[52:20] like the world they jump they jump the
[52:22] first night in bed they jump the first
[52:24] night to physical
[52:25] um and then everything else is
[52:27] eliminated that supposed to come first
[52:29] and that's so what we we teach that but
[52:33] that being said again we're not against
[52:35] um the part that is a part of our human
[52:38] being is that you know you don't want to
[52:39] just be married to somebody just because
[52:42] they have message books and okay this is
[52:44] the one for me there is an attraction
[52:46] you do fall in love but don't put those
[52:49] things first and brother brandom taught
[52:51] the same thing in choosing of a bride
[52:53] you choose based upon who they are
[52:54] character and their characters who they
[52:56] are how they tick how they live and so
[52:58] I'll go back to that point again that
[53:00] you should be content and satisfied with
[53:03] your walk with the Lord and if you can't
[53:05] say that here you you you can say I
[53:08] don't have the Holy Ghost yet and I love
[53:09] people to be honest that way I don't
[53:11] have that real experience with God or I
[53:13] do but I don't feel stable and solid yet
[53:16] I want to see that grow praise God God
[53:18] bless you for that type of statement
[53:21] that's an honest statement and it would
[53:23] be really bad to bring someone else into
[53:25] your life cuz the way God made us is
[53:27] we're going to jump to all of our
[53:30] affections and Cravings being fulfilled
[53:32] in that person rather than the Lord
[53:35] first so in whatever state you are in
[53:38] your singlehood now which is your state
[53:40] be content be content with your walk
[53:42] with the Lord and you know for me my
[53:46] sister got married before I was she my
[53:48] she got married at I think 19 and I got
[53:51] a testimony about my sister here in a
[53:52] little bit I'm going to share with you
[53:54] uh as we begin in some testimonies um
[53:57] but she got married and so I was at the
[53:58] ripe young AG I didn't get married till
[54:00] 27 so she she's second I'm firstborn she
[54:02] got married before me and I I got a
[54:04] little resentful cuz I thought you know
[54:06] hey wait a minute I'm the oldest one
[54:07] here I should have got married first I
[54:09] mean it's it's isn't there some type of
[54:11] scriptural rule that the firstborn gets
[54:13] married I was looking for it you know
[54:15] and I actually got resentful and then I
[54:16] got a little angry at God because you
[54:18] know the the girl wasn't coming along
[54:20] and I talked to a few sisters and
[54:22] different things and just didn't come
[54:23] out right and and uh so boy you know so
[54:27] I had a couple years there that actually
[54:29] in being older I become a resentful
[54:31] towards God I be become uh you know this
[54:34] is not happening for me I'm trying to
[54:36] live a good Christian Life here and and
[54:38] uh so I but if you get resentful and you
[54:41] get angry like that it's almost like God
[54:45] can distance himself even further
[54:47] because God wants you to be content and
[54:50] satisfied with his will and where you're
[54:53] at right now he doesn't want you living
[54:55] in the future that life doesn't begin
[54:57] till I get married that's a lie life
[55:00] begins now with the Lord and you have a
[55:03] completely contented life with the Lord
[55:05] very happy serving the lord coming to
[55:07] church uh that needs to be first and so
[55:10] then but I when I realized I was
[55:12] resentful then I started to ask God to
[55:15] forgive me and ask God to take that away
[55:18] from me and when I come to the place
[55:20] then and I was about 26 then when I come
[55:24] to the place that I said Lord and I was
[55:25] willing to say Lord I am content with
[55:27] what you've given me in my life right
[55:29] now I was doing things to serve the Lord
[55:31] I'd already been ministering going to
[55:32] different things doing things for the
[55:34] Lord God I'm I'm content doing this and
[55:36] I said Lord I'd be willing like Paul in
[55:38] the Bible and I I had to mean this from
[55:41] my I'd be willing to go this journey as
[55:43] a single person serving you I I I'd be
[55:45] willing to do it if that's what your
[55:47] will is and you know when I said that
[55:49] minute from the heart it wasn't just a
[55:51] few months later God brings sister
[55:53] Rebecca into my life Bang Bang bang bang
[55:55] bang bang
[55:56] done they happen very quickly and so we
[56:01] got to work some of these things out
[56:03] with the Lord you see and he knows us
[56:05] and he there might be some things that
[56:07] we need to work through with the Lord um
[56:10] and only God knows those things you know
[56:12] only God knows when completely we're
[56:14] ready uh and so but we want to make sure
[56:16] that the Lord knows that we're ready
[56:18] he's prepared us and you've given him
[56:20] time for you to grow in many things uh
[56:22] but you know at the same time
[56:25] God know God has his will for your life
[56:27] and God will show you I guess you know
[56:30] if you got a specific question sometimes
[56:32] about but really you know how do you
[56:34] find that will of God it's kind of like
[56:37] following him content and patient and
[56:39] you look for green lights from the Lord
[56:43] or you look for red lights because
[56:44] there's a couple relationships I had
[56:46] with girls that um I thought okay this
[56:49] is I think this is it I think this is it
[56:51] and then as time went on I started to
[56:52] feel some checks in my heart and and I
[56:55] wasn't being honest about it I was just
[56:56] feeling my heart you got to be honest
[56:58] about those little checks that you feel
[57:00] they were red lights and it was cuz
[57:03] because if you're praying neutral I like
[57:04] what brother Barry said about you know
[57:06] really truly praying neutral not saying
[57:08] Lord you know uh make me happy um if
[57:11] you're really praying new say God I
[57:13] really do want your will then you're
[57:16] willing to wait you're willing to say
[57:17] Lord I I want your will God will honor
[57:20] that prayer if you're really truly
[57:22] neutral God will honor it and he'll give
[57:24] you red lights little signs along the
[57:27] way this isn't right or he'll keep
[57:29] giving you green lights green lights
[57:32] okay and more and more it gets confirmed
[57:34] in your heart okay this is I believe
[57:36] this is the one and and then then that
[57:38] Revelation drops this is the one for me
[57:41] now uh anyway you know what for Mar I we
[57:45] can talk about courtship and marriage
[57:47] all day long so I got to cut it off here
[57:49] pretty soon um but I hope these things
[57:51] are a blessing to you we get a little
[57:53] criticism uh and I don't want to talk
[57:55] about Chris but we get some for talking
[57:57] about these things openly to the young
[57:59] people and talking about them practical
[58:02] a little bit of humor in there but um
[58:05] I'm not afraid of the criticism because
[58:07] I've seen the fruit in young people that
[58:08] will apply these things I see their
[58:10] marriages now I see their children I see
[58:12] their home life and you you're going to
[58:15] be blessed if you honor God's simple
[58:17] principles you're going to be blessed by
[58:19] it amen don't avoid them don't think
[58:21] you're under different rules than what's
[58:23] being taught here they're for every body
[58:25] God knows human beings and he knew what
[58:27] to put in place as boundaries for us to
[58:29] be able to have Abundant Life can you
[58:32] say amen I think someone read the
[58:34] scripture last night uh uh I think it
[58:36] was that you know he he come to give us
[58:38] life and life more abundant that's our
[58:40] Lord praise the Lord so I was going to
[58:42] ask for before we go uh some testimonies
[58:44] we got a little bit of time here and I'd
[58:46] like to hear back some Reflections
[58:48] sometimes I ask you to write a little
[58:49] note of uh something the Lord did for
[58:52] you or something that you liked about
[58:53] retreat or even CR uh constructive
[58:56] criticism something you you think we

[1:01:43] while you're coming just line up here if
[1:01:44] you want to just say something quickly
[1:01:46] as a testimony of this Retreat or
[1:01:48] something the Lord's done in your life
[1:01:50] my sister uh early on in this year
[1:01:52] learned that she had um she she's
[1:01:55] surprised she is stage four cancer and
[1:01:57] she had a couple tumors in her body
[1:01:58] already growing and um so of course we
[1:02:02] get begin to pray and begin to put
[1:02:05] things before the Lord and she she did
[1:02:07] do some chemo this was kind of new to
[1:02:09] our family had hadn't had a lot of
[1:02:11] cancer and so to have a stage four and
[1:02:13] not much hope you know of Sur of
[1:02:15] survival with it it was quite a a shock
[1:02:18] to wasn't Ike for our family because
[1:02:19] we've never had that too much and so
[1:02:22] this is my sister Sharon and so we just
[1:02:25] want to give glory to God I just want to
[1:02:26] give glory to God give the devil a black
[1:02:28] eye because something that looked very
[1:02:30] hopeless God has completely restored and
[1:02:33] it was it was three weeks ago I guess
[1:02:35] something like that and she came back
[1:02:37] with a completely cancer-free report
[1:02:39] from the doctor there's no cancer none
[1:02:42] left in her
[1:02:43] body none
[1:02:45] left
[1:02:49] amen there's no trace of the tumors so
[1:02:52] uh God is good God is mighty and God is
[1:02:54] still still able to do the impossible we
[1:02:57] thank God for God's spirit in our life
[1:02:59] come
[1:03:00] on and these are short so
[1:03:04] um keep it
[1:03:07] short well I just wanted to testify um
[1:03:10] the other when I came here I was just
[1:03:12] battling a lot of guilt and just feeling
[1:03:14] worthless and just had a lot of failures
[1:03:16] and everything till it was just a huge
[1:03:19] burden on my heart and just I wasn't
[1:03:22] myself and then the other night I came
[1:03:24] to The Altar and I was just praying just
[1:03:26] talking to the Lord and then just from
[1:03:28] my heart I just started confessing I'm
[1:03:30] not a failure I'm not a failure and I
[1:03:34] just watched that thing completely roll
[1:03:35] out of my life and I just felt such a
[1:03:37] freedom and I just wanted to testify
[1:03:39] about
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:49] that so on the note of Sharon actually I
[1:03:52] think the first time I've ever felt
[1:03:53] God's faith like God's faith that she
[1:03:56] that anyone was going to be healed was
[1:03:57] for sister Sharon because like as soon
[1:03:59] as I think the first time I went to pray
[1:04:00] for her it just dropped in my heart
[1:04:01] she's going to be fine so but on the uh
[1:04:05] note of something for me um I similar I
[1:04:10] came in this meeting kind of feeling
[1:04:11] like a failure as a Christian and the
[1:04:14] first the first night you know that went
[1:04:17] away and the second night like just felt
[1:04:20] so much more settled in my identity in
[1:04:22] the Lord and I just feel ready to go
[1:04:24] back and just really be me so I'm going
[1:04:27] to be a lot more annoying
[1:04:29] now thank you for letting us know ahead
[1:04:32] of
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:39] time I'm so nervous right now are you
[1:04:42] nervous a little bit oh we'll get
[1:04:44] through
[1:04:45] this all right so there's something
[1:04:48] there's something that I've been
[1:04:49] struggling with uh for years and I go to
[1:04:52] I go to different camps and I just stand
[1:04:55] there and uh I'd sing and I'd see a lot
[1:04:57] of people going up to the altar um and I
[1:05:00] really felt like uh I was like building
[1:05:04] up a a Heart of Stone really but uh I
[1:05:07] got to the point where just last night
[1:05:10] something something just broke inside me
[1:05:13] and I just I broke down I started crying
[1:05:16] and um I went up to the Altar and I I
[1:05:20] kept asking Lord please forgive me
[1:05:22] please forgive me and then eventually
[1:05:23] started turning to thank you and thank
[1:05:26] you Lord so yeah this my first time here
[1:05:29] and I'm definitely going to be coming
[1:05:31] back again it's been
[1:05:39] wonderful yeah I want to thank the Lord
[1:05:41] for this the wonderful things that he
[1:05:44] he's he's given to us this this Camp the
[1:05:47] thing that brother Jack had last night
[1:05:50] really spoke to my heart I was able to
[1:05:51] just kind of get on a personal level
[1:05:53] with God and even after the the service
[1:05:57] last night we were in our our dorm room
[1:05:59] last night just us five guys and we
[1:06:01] really had a a long heart-to-heart
[1:06:04] conversation about God and I I've never
[1:06:06] felt it that deep before and I was just
[1:06:09] on such a spiritual high and I'm I'm
[1:06:11] still there and I I don't want to just
[1:06:13] stay on the spiritual high but I want to
[1:06:14] like feed my experience so I just want
[1:06:17] to thank him for that that confidence
[1:06:18] and to not only get closer with God but
[1:06:21] to get closer with with my brothers and
[1:06:22] it's it's very really important that you
[1:06:25] stay close with your brothers and so I I
[1:06:28] I thank the Lord for that experience and
[1:06:30] there's nothing like it so Praise His
[1:06:31] Name the Lord
[1:06:38] amen you want to put that other QR code
[1:06:41] up too besides that one just in case
[1:06:42] somebody didn't get the other teaching
[1:06:44] materials and
[1:06:47] such so this past year I had been really
[1:06:52] struggling with my faith and and had had
[1:06:54] gotone to the point where I was really
[1:06:56] struggling on whether or not I had
[1:06:59] salvation whether or not I had receive
[1:07:02] Jesus in the first place and so Thursday
[1:07:06] night I felt such a pool to go to the
[1:07:09] Altar and I was just crying my heart out
[1:07:12] to God and I just kept saying over and
[1:07:14] over again in my mind like I've been so
[1:07:16] foolish like how could you still love me
[1:07:18] even after all the mistakes I made this
[1:07:21] year cuz I felt like such a failure of a
[1:07:25] Christian and I just kept saying that
[1:07:27] over and over again and then just
[1:07:30] something real still and small just
[1:07:33] spoke in my heart that was like I never
[1:07:34] stop loving
[1:07:37] you
[1:07:39] and it it was just honestly a
[1:07:42] confirmation I guess that even though I
[1:07:46] still make
[1:07:49] mistakes you know Jesus has always been
[1:07:52] there in my life and I've I've never
[1:07:54] been so sure of my salvation until then
[1:08:00] so hallelujah thank
[1:08:05] you he never stops loving us it's
[1:08:08] unconditional love come on brother
[1:08:11] anybody else who wants to say something
[1:08:12] come come on up front here so you're
[1:08:13] already ready
[1:08:19] available well this is my second year
[1:08:21] here at the retreat and I'm always glad
[1:08:24] to come here and uh I was end of this
[1:08:27] year of this last year I was playing a
[1:08:29] lot of loneliness and um not a lot of
[1:08:31] social happening end of my end of the
[1:08:34] year and all that and I came here I
[1:08:37] really want to see more friends and
[1:08:38] people I wanted to you know be more of a
[1:08:42] group of Youth people and all that and
[1:08:45] um I started talking to people people
[1:08:47] friends me and new people and I found
[1:08:49] out that brother Barry's church is 10
[1:08:52] minutes from my house and I never knew
[1:08:53] that that and I feel like that was I
[1:08:56] think I was answer my prayer having
[1:08:58] social and getting to me more friends
[1:09:00] with people but and um I also want to
[1:09:04] say I up to get prayed on Thursday night
[1:09:07] and there's something like has been
[1:09:09] bothering my life for many years and I
[1:09:11] going to profess it I'm going to say it
[1:09:14] and I got prayed for and I'm going to
[1:09:15] say I'm going to leave it here I'm going
[1:09:17] to go home a new person amen Bud it here
[1:09:21] God bless
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:29] um so like the Friday night service was
[1:09:31] totally for me not Friday night um sorry
[1:09:33] what day is it Saturday today Saturday
[1:09:36] today's Saturday so it would have been
[1:09:38] we started Thursday when yes so Thursday
[1:09:41] night the first pre uh sermon Brother
[1:09:44] Sam preached um because he was kept
[1:09:46] talking about like this quiet sister
[1:09:48] that's
[1:09:50] me um and I guess I've been dealing with
[1:09:52] guilt cuz like I'm so quiet in like in
[1:09:55] church usually I'm a very quiet person
[1:09:57] and it was just like your life can be
[1:10:00] the noise like that's the big thing so
[1:10:02] that was just like the most wonderful
[1:10:05] thing that it's okay God made me this
[1:10:08] way so yeah tremendous thanks appreciate
[1:10:15] it there was some there were some other
[1:10:18] people ministered to that way you know
[1:10:20] um and I just would say this we all each
[1:10:23] have our own way that God deals with us
[1:10:26] and our our personalities and different
[1:10:27] things and we should never be put in a
[1:10:30] box under certain meetings that someone
[1:10:32] can testify say this is what happened to
[1:10:34] me when I received the Holy Ghost and so
[1:10:36] they you compare yourself so that H has
[1:10:39] to happen with me what you need to do is
[1:10:40] just yield your life and bring true
[1:10:42] repentance to God and what emotion comes
[1:10:45] from that that's that's between you and
[1:10:47] God and I don't think it's right to to
[1:10:49] force a certain thing that has to happen
[1:10:51] and so I've heard that a lot from the
[1:10:52] young people just let God do do the work
[1:10:55] and if there's an altar call let him
[1:10:57] bring you to the Altar and let the let
[1:10:59] the work be done by the Lord
[1:11:02] so I just want to testify of some
[1:11:06] physical healing uh of just a spoonful
[1:11:09] of the Mountain Moving I several years
[1:11:12] ago I played soccer and I had a head
[1:11:14] injury and from that then afterwards my
[1:11:17] jaw just clicks really loudly it's not a
[1:11:19] huge deal like you know but it's
[1:11:21] something that I don't have to live with
[1:11:24] you know and the devil might try to come
[1:11:25] to me and say like well it's not a huge
[1:11:27] deal don't worry about it you can live
[1:11:29] with it you know but I don't have to
[1:11:30] live with it you know and so when when
[1:11:32] brother Samuel or no brother Jack I
[1:11:34] think was talking about you know get rid
[1:11:36] of the baby Philistines too and I'm like
[1:11:37] I'm not leaving this baby Philistine
[1:11:39] here so I just want to testify that it's
[1:11:43] going to be gone even if it's not gone
[1:11:46] now A Spoonful move the other night is
[1:11:48] it visible not really does it matter no
[1:11:51] it's going to be gone one day I like the
[1:11:52] confession buddy I like
[1:11:54] it I like
[1:12:03] it just going to piggyback off of uh
[1:12:05] what Zion was talking about uh over the
[1:12:08] past few years I've uh had a couple back
[1:12:10] injuries and it's just been a real real
[1:12:12] struggle back pain is not not fun
[1:12:14] especially when you're only 21 so but uh
[1:12:18] got God prayed for the other night and I
[1:12:20] am feeling the best I felt in 2 years
[1:12:23] and it has been absolutely amazing and I
[1:12:25] just can't thank the Lord enough healing
[1:12:28] to
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:40] Rebecca okay so I really felt like last
[1:12:44] night's service was really for me and I
[1:12:46] really really needed it cuz during the
[1:12:48] song service I was like okay God I need
[1:12:51] I need a service about victory over like
[1:12:54] your old self I need encouragement to
[1:12:56] know that like I am not my old me and my
[1:12:59] mistakes and failures before Christ are
[1:13:02] not who I am anymore and I was like I I
[1:13:07] just really really need some
[1:13:08] encouragement and
[1:13:10] then I had that service I was like I I
[1:13:13] am so thankful I needed that cuz I was
[1:13:18] born to destroy the old me who I was
[1:13:21] before I got Christ and I'm just really
[1:13:24] really grateful cuz I really really
[1:13:26] needed the
[1:13:36] encouragement these are all so
[1:13:38] encouraging we appreciate it someone
[1:13:39] else so encouraging anybody
[1:13:44] else how about one of the guys there
[1:13:46] from South Africa all the way from South
[1:13:48] Africa the
[1:13:50] furthest must have been a long walk
[1:13:57] they've been through a little something
[1:13:58] there was your grandfather was the
[1:13:59] pastor there passed away instantly and
[1:14:02] so it's been a rough road through the
[1:14:04] church there and such you know but I
[1:14:06] didn't mean to call you on the spot but
[1:14:07] just wanted to hear from
[1:14:09] you so first here I just want to say God
[1:14:11] bless everyone here um God bless from
[1:14:13] South Africa um it's always such a
[1:14:16] blessing to come to a completely
[1:14:19] different country on the opposite end of
[1:14:21] the world and that Spirit just moves
[1:14:24] through the people and it was just such
[1:14:27] a wonderful experience for me to know
[1:14:29] that while we are bound by by place and
[1:14:35] time and we can only be in one place at
[1:14:37] once but that same spirit that raised
[1:14:40] Jesus from the dead is still moving
[1:14:43] everywhere across this Earth for God's
[1:14:46] people and it's such a blessing the
[1:14:48] unity that I feel here man it feels like
[1:14:51] I'm home like the The Same Spirit
[1:14:54] between the youth between the the
[1:14:56] facilitators it's just that peace of God

[1:16:01] really grateful to be here and to have
[1:16:04] the opportunity of um fellowshipping
[1:16:06] with you all um I was told about these
[1:16:09] meetings and um um apart from many years
[1:16:14] ago when I went to a different Camp it's
[1:16:17] so nice to see so many young people who
[1:16:21] really love the Lord and not ashamed to
[1:16:24] actually seek for you know seek prayer
[1:16:27] seek God go to the altar um and you know
[1:16:31] I I just hope that you know people back
[1:16:33] in in in England and in different places
[1:16:36] in Europe it would be so nice for them
[1:16:38] to see that the same way they are you
[1:16:42] know we're all seeking God and wanting a
[1:16:44] closer uh relationship with God that's
[1:16:47] the same thing that's happening across
[1:16:49] you know the US Canada and um I um yeah
[1:16:54] I I just thank God for just being able
[1:16:56] to to come here and uh yeah fellowship
[1:16:59] with you all yeah thanks for
[1:17:09] coming um yeah I guess a small testimony
[1:17:13] is um I think I was battling with a lot
[1:17:16] of a lot of things um before I kind of
[1:17:20] decided to sing um something
[1:17:23] um I think for me it was like will I be
[1:17:25] accepted for who I am um how I move how
[1:17:29] I sing how I act um I think there's a
[1:17:32] lot of fear actually um around that and
[1:17:36] I think I spoke to a few of the girls I
[1:17:38] was like I don't know if I should sing
[1:17:39] or or not um something in me kept on
[1:17:41] saying just just do it I know it's the
[1:17:43] Holy Spirit but um I said to Gideon I
[1:17:45] was like I have a song and this is at
[1:17:47] 5:00 p.m. before the service um
[1:17:50] yesterday and then he was like yeah yeah
[1:17:52] okay okay maybe he might sing he might
[1:17:53] not sing and I was like oh okay um so I
[1:17:56] practiced the song um and you know just
[1:17:59] singing and and actually you know
[1:18:01] brother Paul you turning and saying when
[1:18:03] you said that like sing again I think to
[1:18:06] me that was like actually people accept
[1:18:09] me for who I am like that's okay it's
[1:18:11] okay to be who you are um and I think in
[1:18:14] a lot of conversations with the young
[1:18:16] people here today um I think a lot of us
[1:18:18] are struggling with like like the
[1:18:21] somebody else was saying like it's okay
[1:18:23] to be you you don't have to be somebody
[1:18:26] else and God has made you unique and
[1:18:31] just be who you are because at the end
[1:18:33] of the day if people can't accept you
[1:18:34] for you then maybe they're not yeah
[1:18:38] maybe that's their problem maybe they're
[1:18:40] not worth being with anyways um so yeah
[1:18:43] um thank you for accepting me for me I
[1:18:51] guess
[1:18:57] [Applause]

[1:22:41] to everyone to kind of just praise the
[1:22:43] Lord anyhow um
[1:22:46] so the other night it was last night I
[1:22:49] was praying to God um just about some
[1:22:51] life choices and just the direction I I
[1:22:54] didn't know where I wanted to go I just
[1:22:56] had a few choices I need to make I'm
[1:22:58] just praying to God for an answer of
[1:23:02] where I should go cuz I wanted his will
[1:23:04] I just wanted to completely surrender to
[1:23:06] him and um as I was praying it just it
[1:23:10] felt like so quiet that God like just
[1:23:12] wasn't answering like I kept praying I
[1:23:15] kept emptying myself I kept surrendering
[1:23:17] and I'm like God please just speak to me
[1:23:19] like I've heard you speak to me before
[1:23:21] and just and on it went on people were
[1:23:24] singing rejoicing and I just kept like
[1:23:26] grabbing at what felt like it wasn't
[1:23:29] there and but I knew I knew God could
[1:23:32] answer so I just I just kept going I
[1:23:34] said God I'm not leaving until I get an
[1:23:36] answer and people were rejoicing around
[1:23:38] me it was getting towards the end nobody
[1:23:40] was left at the altar and I was still
[1:23:42] praying in my seat and finally when I
[1:23:45] was spent on tears and just completely
[1:23:49] like emotionally like gone like I was in
[1:23:52] my my seat and just there was no more
[1:23:54] praying it was just lay there and then
[1:23:57] finally like during the prayer I had
[1:24:00] asked God just one word just anything
[1:24:02] I'm willing for anything and finally
[1:24:05] towards the end of it I got just
[1:24:07] wait and it may not be the answer I
[1:24:11] wanted or was praying for but I'm going
[1:24:14] to praise God anyway that he gave me an
[1:24:16] answer and I'm just going to hold on to
[1:24:18] that just wait believing that he knows
[1:24:21] what's best for me and he's got it just
[1:24:25] wait praise the Lord
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:35] awesome you you had to endure Berry
[1:24:37] coffee there that was great it was great
[1:24:41] I'm sitting there and Devil's fighting

[1:24:45] racing now right now I'm I'm getting
[1:24:48] dizzy right now seriously cuz Satan's
[1:24:51] fighting me that sister that just sung
[1:24:53] she spoke directly to me because I was
[1:24:57] sitting there everybody's testimony is
[1:24:59] better than me I'm sitting there last
[1:25:01] night um I came to this Camp as I'm
[1:25:05] always guilty I don't feel like
[1:25:08] forgiveness is accepted I know it is but
[1:25:11] I'm sitting there I'm like God please
[1:25:13] forgive me I've done all these things
[1:25:16] immediately when I said God forgive me
[1:25:18] the song came on there's forgiveness at
[1:25:21] the cross
[1:25:23] or the song that we sung last night
[1:25:25] immediately within a second of me saying
[1:25:28] please forgive me and I was like that
[1:25:31] was it yes but that it's
[1:25:35] amazing and now Satan's fighting me
[1:25:37] right now because I can't remember what
[1:25:38] else I was going to
[1:25:40] say you're giv a black eye you got up
[1:25:42] here you're talking about I know there's
[1:25:44] probably more people here that's like
[1:25:46] his testimony or her testimony so much
[1:25:48] better than mine I can't amount to that
[1:25:52] and like she said it's important to be
[1:25:55] yourself and Satan was telling me you're
[1:25:57] not you're so little your God's
[1:26:01] forgiveness it's nothing compared to
[1:26:03] other people but I was like fight it
[1:26:07] fight it boo devil do
[1:26:11] devil all

[1:26:40] to sing like this sister as far as but
[1:26:43] we need to be
[1:26:44] ourselves you're quiet you had a lot of
[1:26:46] people get up with testimony their choir
[1:26:48] they' probably never even got up in
[1:26:49] front of people like this but they
[1:26:50] overcome it you got got to be yourself
[1:26:52] and give a testimony to the Lord you're
[1:26:55] already way ahead cuz you're a redhead
[1:26:56] you realize that right I had red hair
[1:26:59] just like you it's special red hair and
[1:27:02] freckles is special above anybody else
[1:27:05] so that itself should encourage you plus
[1:27:07] you're a Son of God yep and then I I
[1:27:10] married a wife who likes
[1:27:13] freckles cuz of when we started to get
[1:27:16] know one another I had to know a couple
[1:27:17] things I said first do you have the Holy
[1:27:19] Ghost and then my second question to my
[1:27:21] wife is what do you think about
[1:27:23] freckles I did didn't I and she goes in
[1:27:26] her Southern Tennessee accent I love
[1:27:30] freckles praise the Lord let's get Let's
[1:27:33] Get Married let's do this thing it's a
[1:27:36] real confirmation for me God made us the
[1:27:38] way that we are and God gave me all I
[1:27:42] mean when I was uh 14 I begged my dad
[1:27:44] for some cream to get rid of my freckles
[1:27:46] I hated them and he bought this
[1:27:48] expensive cream I talked him into it and
[1:27:50] I put it on and over night I woke up the
[1:27:52] next morning this going to be yet I woke
[1:27:54] up the next morning I had more freckles
[1:27:55] than what I had the night before so I
[1:27:58] didn't know the purpose in my freckles
[1:28:00] but then I married a wife who likes
[1:28:02] freckles that's why I have them I'm
[1:28:09] beautiful fearfully and wonderfully
[1:28:16] made how do you follow
[1:28:19] that I don't feel like I would follow
[1:28:21] much I just want to say um I appreciate
[1:28:23] each and every one of your testimonies
[1:28:24] and I appreciate everything that all of
[1:28:26] youall do um I just want to thank the
[1:28:30] Lord uh for answering my prayer um I've
[1:28:32] always been a very fearful uh neurotic
[1:28:35] person um it's just part of my nature
[1:28:38] but
[1:28:39] um uh what what I've been looking for
[1:28:41] from this uh not just in this camp but
[1:28:43] over the past few months is confidence
[1:28:45] I'm at a point in my life where I'm
[1:28:46] making some pretty big decisions with
[1:28:48] career-wise and where I'm going to live
[1:28:50] and other things and um I've been
[1:28:52] praying for confidence but uh the the
[1:28:54] last sermon of brother Samuel and then
[1:28:57] brother Jack kind of Hit the the nail in
[1:29:00] confidence is great but I believe
[1:29:01] courage is more important and by God's
[1:29:04] grace um I think he's given me courage
[1:29:06] to push forward even when I'm not
[1:29:07] confident in what I'm doing and um I'm
[1:29:10] just very grateful and I I hope he'll
[1:29:12] fill each and every one of you with
[1:29:13] courage as well amen yeah Lord bless you
