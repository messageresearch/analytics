[4:12] myself cannot live the way I
[4:17] live or be the way I
[4:22] was every day a gift to me
[4:28] because
[4:30] somebody died for
[4:34] [Music]
[4:41] me 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 1 moreover
[4:46] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[4:48] which I preached unto you which also ye
[4:50] have received and wherein ye stand by
[4:53] which also ye are saved so the gospel
[4:56] that he preached brings salvation that's
[4:58] how they were saved at the gospel is not
[5:00] preached people can't be saved but when
[5:02] the gospel is preached the good news
[5:04] then people are saved by which also you
[5:07] are saved if you keep in memory what I
[5:10] preached unto you unless you have
[5:13] believed in vain and what that means is
[5:15] that if you really believed it not
[5:17] superficially not just in your head but
[5:20] from your heart if you really believe
[5:22] this then you are saved and also you are
[5:25] uh you you should keep it in your memory
[5:27] the things that I've preached to you how
[5:29] many know it's important to keep the
[5:30] word of God in your memory and keep
[5:32] that's why we come to church to bring
[5:35] things into
[5:36] remembrance uh tomorrow is Memorial Day
[5:39] and there's a certain time we give to
[5:40] remember what's been done I want to talk
[5:43] a little bit about that this morning
[5:44] what Memorial Day means not just for
[5:46] this country but also for Christians God
[5:49] has memorials for us and God wants us to
[5:51] remember what he's done for us amen and
[5:55] keep the word of God in our memory keep
[5:57] reminding us of the word of God but
[5:59] verse three says for I delivered for I
[6:01] delivered unto you the first first of
[6:03] all that which I also received and what
[6:06] he means there is that this is the most
[6:09] important thing this is top priority I
[6:12] for I delivered unto you first of all
[6:14] before anything before anything I
[6:16] preached first of all that which also I
[6:18] receive in other words what God gave me
[6:21] I gave you how that Christ died for our
[6:25] sins according to the scriptures the
[6:28] first thing that Paul said I brought to
[6:31] you and the most important thing is
[6:34] somebody died for you right and if we
[6:38] skip to the other parts and miss this
[6:41] part we're missing something essential
[6:44] to the Christian walk can you say Amen
[6:46] my title this morning is somebody died
[6:48] for you somebody died for you I'm going
[6:50] to read that verse again I delivered
[6:52] unto you the priority first of all
[6:54] before all things that which I received
[6:56] how that Christ died for our sins
[7:00] according to the scriptures as as I just
[7:03] like to speak a little bit this morning
[7:04] on someone died for me and I want to we
[7:07] realized that tomorrow is a holiday uh
[7:10] Memorial Day and that was set up since
[7:13] 1971 our country set it up as a national
[7:16] holiday and I would say that I guess
[7:18] like with most holidays uh over time the
[7:22] new generation especially begins to lose
[7:25] the purpose and the meaning of the
[7:26] holidays it happens almost with every
[7:29] good holiday holiday that we're really
[7:30] not celebrating the TR thing of what it
[7:33] meant years ago uh the new generation
[7:35] tends to lose the uh being connected
[7:38] with the meaning of it so some of my
[7:40] sermon this morning will be just letting
[7:43] uh everyone know what Memorial Day means
[7:46] and what it uh what it what it was
[7:49] started for and there was another
[7:51] holiday that went on from uh years
[7:53] before that but then they changed it and
[7:55] so since
[7:56] 1971 uh there's a there's a meaning
[7:59] behind this holiday tomorrow and quite
[8:01] often we get together for our hot dogs
[8:02] and hamburgers and if that's happening
[8:05] of course I'm there I'm not going to
[8:06] miss it but through all of our you know
[8:09] any holiday can lose its purpose
[8:11] Christmas has certainly lost its purpose
[8:13] and its meaning can you say Amen July
[8:16] 4th and and you could just say all of
[8:18] the all most of the holidays and and I I
[8:20] hate that Thanksgiving kind of gets lost
[8:23] in the shuffle of turkey and different
[8:25] things because we missed the meaning of
[8:27] it and what its purpose was and why it
[8:29] was set for a memorial can you say Amen
[8:33] we we we tend to We tend to uh lose the
[8:36] meaning of something and and there's
[8:39] when we take something and turn it into
[8:42] something else it loses its mean meaning
[8:44] and it loses loses a feeling to it uh uh
[8:48] there's a natural disconnect in the new
[8:50] generation from the meaning and even the
[8:53] power of something because sometimes
[8:56] something can have a meaning to it and
[8:59] an origin to it but sometimes when we
[9:02] are connected to the meaning of it it
[9:04] has a power with it to affect our lives
[9:07] today when we're connected with
[9:10] something the way it started especially
[9:12] God's word and when he did something in
[9:14] the past when we connect let me just
[9:16] bring this when you connect with the
[9:18] Lord Jesus Christ and his word truly
[9:20] connect in your heart and with what he
[9:23] did at Calvary when you connect with
[9:25] that it has an effect on your life today
[9:28] it has a power power that goes with
[9:31] it and so uh we we tend to become
[9:34] disconnected and there's a saying that I
[9:36] use that comes from Rush limbal he
[9:38] applied it to the the Democrats but I
[9:41] will not do that this morning because I
[9:43] think it's a great statement he attached
[9:45] to the de Democrats but I attach it to
[9:47] Christianity Today and to many other
[9:49] things he said that becomes symbolism
[9:51] over substance and he was saying that
[9:54] some people it becomes something becomes
[9:56] a symbol something in history just
[9:58] becomes a symbol and we celebrate the
[10:00] symbol and we celebrate some distant
[10:02] thing that took place but we miss the
[10:05] substance of what It produced we miss
[10:08] the substance of what it really means to
[10:10] us how many can safely say in
[10:12] Christianity that the that the church as
[10:14] a whole loses the power of the Cross can
[10:18] you say Amen but they're celebrating the
[10:20] cross they're singing about the cross
[10:21] but you can lose the power of the Cross
[10:24] and what it does in our lives people
[10:27] talk about Jesus Christ at Christmas
[10:29] they talk about his birth oh yes he was
[10:31] born God came came to Earth but there
[10:33] ought to be a revelation behind that
[10:35] affects our lives that today I'm living
[10:38] because of what happened in the past I'm
[10:40] living in the power of what took place
[10:42] in the past I'm living in the meaning of
[10:44] it can you say it means something to me
[10:46] because he's done something through the
[10:48] work of the Cross 2,000 years ago I'm
[10:51] feeling the effects of that can you say
[10:54] amen and if that doesn't happen then we
[10:57] become symbolism over substance we don't
[10:59] have the substance of what it means we
[11:01] don't have the reality of the Holy Ghost
[11:04] and what this Bible is to produce as the
[11:06] Holy Ghost and that's a tragedy because
[11:09] then it becomes religion and religion
[11:12] isn't working anymore it has to be a
[11:15] personal relationship symbolism over
[11:17] substance some things have a a powerful
[11:19] impression and affect our lives and when
[11:22] we really understand the meaning of it
[11:25] we become connected with the results of
[11:27] it and it's like Christ dying to take
[11:30] our sin away that statement as is read
[11:33] in the scripture he said how that Christ
[11:35] died for our sins according to the
[11:38] scriptures there was an effect Christ
[11:41] died for us somebody died for us but
[11:44] what's the effect to take our
[11:47] sin to take our sin if we lose the
[11:51] meaning of that then we're caught with
[11:52] our sin and the soul that sinth it shall
[11:56] die that's right that's what the Bible
[11:58] says yeah if you're not delivered from
[12:01] your sin the soul that sinneth it will
[12:04] die there's no future to that it ends
[12:07] someday but the effect of Christ someone
[12:10] dying for us has a a residual effect
[12:14] we're still seeing the effects of the
[12:16] blood of Jesus Christ somebody died for
[12:19] us but what good is it to talk about it
[12:21] if we don't have our sins released from
[12:23] [Music]
[12:24] [Applause]
[12:25] us what good is the message of the hour
[12:28] unless we see the powerful effect of
[12:30] Jesus Christ coming from the message of
[12:32] the
[12:33] hour and that's not just a feeling
[12:36] that's not just an emotion that's not
[12:37] just dancing in the spirit it's the
[12:39] power to live a life it's the power to
[12:42] overcome demons it's the power to
[12:44] overcome habits it's the power to
[12:46] overcome pornography it's the power I'm
[12:49] talking about Calvary somebody died for
[12:51] us and in that is the power to overcome
[12:55] can you say Amen the power to overcome
[12:57] fornication the power to overcome
[12:59] adultery the power to overcome any demon
[13:02] Spirit Satan bring the best of your
[13:05] spirits to us and the power of Calvary
[13:07] can deliver that person from it Memorial
[13:10] Day is a day I didn't know if you the
[13:12] young people knew it they probably do
[13:13] but I'm reminding us of that day
[13:15] Memorial Day is is to remember ones who
[13:18] have died in military service throughout
[13:22] history and they died for a reason thank
[13:25] God they died for a reason and that is
[13:27] they died to preserve our Liber Liberty
[13:30] they died to preserve our unity in our
[13:32] country to preserve the Liberties that
[13:34] we enjoy you see the new generations we
[13:37] tend to let our liberties become common
[13:40] someone will get 16 17 years old and
[13:42] they'll be given a a car and and they
[13:44] can go and come drive places and so but
[13:47] see there are some countries or some
[13:49] places we can come to church today still
[13:51] in Liberty I don't know how much longer
[13:53] those Liberties will be left but I can
[13:55] tell you as long as I've got it before
[13:56] they shut these doors I want to be here
[13:58] every time time the doors are open
[14:00] because that's a liberty that I'm
[14:01] enjoying and there's many countries that
[14:03] don't have that Liberty they can't
[14:05] worship the way they want to worship but
[14:07] in our country there's been millions of
[14:09] lives that have been given somebody died
[14:12] that you could come in your car this
[14:14] morning and nobody told you what to do
[14:16] nobody told you to come to church or not
[14:18] go to church nobody dictated you pretty
[14:20] much live in those Liberties I can go to
[14:22] the store I can go here I can go do what
[14:25] what I'll say something about Co though
[14:27] I I will say something was a the the
[14:30] first step towards moving towards a
[14:33] communistic control that comes over our
[14:36] lives that you're going to do this
[14:37] you're not going to do that and all in
[14:39] the name of Co for the safety of all
[14:41] mankind you better have the discernment
[14:43] to know where that was going that's
[14:45] right because it was the first set to me
[14:48] to engage in in the minds of the people
[14:51] that for the safety of all we all need
[14:53] to join in with this and you need to do
[14:55] this matter of fact you have to do this
[14:57] on it oh well that's not popular there's
[15:00] not many amens to that and I can't even
[15:02] hear them on the streaming I can't even
[15:04] hear the amens that's not very popular
[15:06] but I'm going to tell you something
[15:08] there is scripture that shows that
[15:10] there's a
[15:11] control that you can't buy or
[15:14] sell unless you brought into that image
[15:17] into the beast that's coming and it's
[15:19] closer than you think but the people's
[15:21] minds have to be prepared for it so
[15:24] controlling but listen today you didn't
[15:26] have anybody tell you not to come to
[15:27] church young people people you didn't
[15:29] have tell about you couldn't drive your
[15:30] car to church you have Liberties here
[15:32] and I want to tell you you have them
[15:34] because there's been hundreds of
[15:36] thousands of lives that have died so you
[15:38] could have Liberty this
[15:41] morning and that's what Memorial Day is
[15:43] about
[15:44] tomorrow it's the memorial not of ones
[15:48] uh not of ones that have served in the
[15:50] military that's Veterans Day but this is
[15:52] one who have
[15:55] died to preserve our Liberty to keep us
[15:57] safe from tyrants
[15:59] to keep us safe from terrorists so we
[16:02] can live in a free country people have
[16:03] died for that and when they many of them
[16:06] signed up for it signed up for the
[16:08] military service to go fighting Wars and
[16:10] they signed up knowing that they may die
[16:12] for it that's bravery to sign up to
[16:14] realize I could lose my life over this
[16:17] but if they did it for the right
[16:18] intentions not to just become some
[16:20] He-Man but they did it for the right
[16:22] intentions they did it because I'm
[16:23] willing when I sign off on this I'm
[16:25] willing to give my life I may not come
[16:27] back home but I'm doing doing it for my
[16:29] country and I'm doing it for the future
[16:32] preservation of Liberty and so that
[16:34] other ones could live I'll die so they
[16:36] can live who's that sound like to you
[16:40] our Lord and savior I'll go to this
[16:42] cross so they can live in Victory I'll
[16:45] go and take this death so that they can
[16:47] live every day in the power God doesn't
[16:49] want us to die for him he wants us to
[16:51] live for him in the power of the Holy
[16:55] Ghost is that okay with everybody
[16:58] so I want us to think about this a
[17:00] minute and how special that is how
[17:03] special it is when because we lose the
[17:06] feeling of this I want you to and this
[17:07] might be very basic to somebody maybe
[17:10] you were looking for something deeper
[17:11] this morning but I want you to think
[17:13] about how special it is when someone
[17:16] dies so that you can enjoy something in
[17:19] the future right good that we are living
[17:22] in certain Liberties still today
[17:24] different than other countries lives
[17:27] were taken lives were uh blood was shed
[17:31] can you say amen and people gave their
[17:33] lives so that you can enjoy your day of
[17:37] hot dogs and hamburgers and volleyball
[17:39] that's right amen with nobody stepping
[17:42] in and taking say you can't do this
[17:45] people gave their lives for that they
[17:47] shed blood for that their lives were
[17:49] ended lives that could have come home
[17:51] and enjoyed their freedoms but they
[17:53] didn't come home they died and you still
[17:56] have your life there's something about
[17:58] that that it should never become common
[18:01] to us amen I said it should never become
[18:06] common to us that somebody died so I
[18:10] could
[18:11] live that part should never become
[18:14] common to us I thought this is an
[18:16] amazing Story related to our subject
[18:18] today years ago a young mother was
[18:20] making her way across the Hills of South
[18:22] Wales carrying her tiny baby in her arms
[18:25] when she was overtaken by a blizzard a
[18:27] blinding blizzard she never reached her
[18:29] destination when the blizzard had
[18:31] subsided her body was found by Searchers
[18:33] beneath a mound of snow but they
[18:36] discovered that before her death she had
[18:38] taken off all of her outer clothing and
[18:41] wrapped it around her baby when they
[18:43] unwrapped the child to their great
[18:45] surprise and joy they found he was alive
[18:47] and well she had mounded her body over
[18:50] his and given her life for her child
[18:54] proving the depths of her mother love
[18:56] years later that child David Lloyd
[19:00] George grown to manhood became Prime
[19:03] Minister of Great Britain and without a
[19:05] doubt one of England's greatest
[19:09] Statesmen the power of the future On A
[19:12] Life That's laid down for someone else
[19:15] that was a case of a mother but then
[19:17] there's hundreds of lives can you say am
[19:19] man that were willing to say I know I'm
[19:21] going to die over this I there's another
[19:23] story that I like I've told it here
[19:24] before I this story always moves me to
[19:27] tears it's it's amazing aming there was
[19:29] a little boy and he was brought into the
[19:31] doctor's office and said his older
[19:32] sister he's only about 7 years old his
[19:34] older sister had a rare blood disease
[19:37] and she's about 11 or 12 something like
[19:39] that and so they they realize if they
[19:42] took some of the boys blood then it and
[19:44] had a transfusion it would help her and
[19:46] so they brought him in the office and
[19:48] they explained to this young boy that he
[19:50] was that and asked him would you they
[19:53] explained his sister's situation and he
[19:55] was already crying a little bit you know
[19:56] he didn't want to lose his sister and so
[19:59] they said but we can do something here
[20:01] if you give your blood for your sister
[20:03] she can live and so he just stopped and
[20:06] he thought and then his eyes swelled up
[20:07] again with tears and he thought about it
[20:10] just about 30 seconds and he was just
[20:12] crying and he says I'll do it I'll do it
[20:15] and so when they got them on the the two
[20:18] uh beds next to each other and they
[20:20] begin this blood transfusion they begin
[20:22] to do it and you you could actually see
[20:24] it and this just restore the life of
[20:26] this girl after a few minutes the little
[20:28] boy said to the doctors and to his
[20:30] parents he said and he said and when do
[20:32] I
[20:34] die because he had understood it to be
[20:38] that for her to live he would have to
[20:40] give his blood and at that moment in the
[20:42] office he thought about it he said I'd
[20:44] rather have my sister live I'd rather
[20:47] give my life as a seven-year-old boy so
[20:49] she can go on being happy so she can go
[20:51] on and live she doesn't have to die but
[20:54] I will he made that decision right and
[20:57] he said when do I die die said said
[20:59] honey no we didn't mean for you to die
[21:01] you're you're helping her with your
[21:02] blood but see my I moved in my heart
[21:05] because a young boy was willing to do
[21:07] that for his
[21:08] sister there's something about that in
[21:10] the love of God and Beyond a little boy
[21:14] the love of God is here this morning can
[21:15] you say Amen there's nobody could go to
[21:18] a cross like that unless he had you in
[21:20] mind that you could live in Victory that
[21:23] you can live over habits could you live
[21:26] in the Holy Ghost yes you can can you
[21:28] say Amen there isn't anything that you
[21:31] can't overcome I was looking at last
[21:33] night how many lives total were lost
[21:35] just for our country so that can
[21:37] preserve our freedoms and I have a
[21:39] little visual of it we know that the
[21:41] Civil War was the most lives lost but
[21:44] they counted up and this one lady in
[21:45] this article just this weekend put this
[21:48] together and she was pulling up the
[21:50] lives of over the years of all the wars
[21:52] that our country has fought it's amazing
[21:54] how many lives it looks like close to a
[21:56] million the different Wars of revolution
[21:58] War 4400 War of 1812 Indian Wars mexic
[22:03] now friends let's not lose the feeling
[22:05] listen this is almost a Million Lives
[22:08] that have been lost over history to
[22:10] preserve the unity and to preserve our
[22:12] country so that you can live all these
[22:14] years in Liberty let's not lose the
[22:16] feeling of it I thank God for these
[22:18] Million Lives real interesting thing
[22:20] that the she the lady Megan crigger said
[22:22] in this article talking about the the
[22:24] lives that were lost she said not long
[22:26] ago most Americans were likely to know
[22:28] an active military service men service
[22:31] member many of our young people many
[22:34] Americans knew somebody but today
[22:35] because of the factors like political
[22:37] cost of launching a military draft and
[22:39] the increasing Automation and
[22:40] Outsourcing of military related task
[22:42] fewer Americans have a personal
[22:45] connection to someone in the armed
[22:47] forces that's right during World War II
[22:51] about 12% of the total US population
[22:53] were part of the Armed Forces according
[22:55] to the S Census Bureau and Department of
[22:58] Defense and while fewer service
[23:00] ministers uh while fewer service members
[23:03] enlisted during the Vietnam era the
[23:05] conflict's draft cut across American
[23:08] society explains Gala true a medical uh
[23:11] a medical person uh over the uh
[23:14] Department of Veterans Affairs uh she
[23:16] talk she talks with veterans primarily
[23:19] those who fought most recently in
[23:21] Afghanistan and Iraq and explores ways
[23:23] to use narrative as a tool for mental
[23:26] health care even though there's so much
[23:28] talk about the opposition and difficult
[23:31] experiences that Vietnam veterans had
[23:33] come coming home with protest there was
[23:36] still a sense that people were very
[23:38] close to someone who had served or knew
[23:42] somebody who had served she said today
[23:45] out of a nation of nearly 329 million
[23:49] people 1.3 million Americans are in
[23:52] active duty military and another 800,000
[23:55] serve in the reserves according to the
[23:56] Department of Defense that that small
[23:59] figure influences the way the general
[24:01] public thinks about the cost of the
[24:05] conflict see disconnected from the
[24:08] cost disconnected that somebody gave
[24:11] their life for
[24:12] me more and more the new generation when
[24:15] they become disconnected from that they
[24:17] don't have an appreciation and a
[24:19] gratefulness for the Liberties they have
[24:22] they're disconnected that small figure
[24:23] influences the way the general public
[24:25] thinks about the cost of the conflict in
[24:27] our society we seen the real shift she
[24:29] said now now less than 1% of our
[24:33] population has
[24:34] served the experience of going to war
[24:37] and coming home we don't have we don't
[24:40] have as much awareness of it we have a
[24:43] disconnect in our society about what's
[24:46] going on who has served and what they
[24:51] experienced I thought that was very
[24:53] interesting to show the lack of connect
[24:57] to some somebody died for me so that I
[25:01] can enjoy this there's a
[25:04] Detachment there was a there's many moms
[25:07] who had their kid go away to war and
[25:10] never come back home their their their
[25:12] son dies their son never come home and
[25:15] she's that mom being related to that son
[25:20] that's her son and he never came back
[25:22] home from war she's going to feel
[25:25] that she's going to feel that personally
[25:28] she's going to do a lot of crying she's
[25:30] going to do a lot of weeping if she's
[25:31] like most of them they are proud of
[25:33] their country and they're proud that
[25:35] their son has served but you don't get
[25:37] around the fact of the feeling of being
[25:39] hurt being completely oh my son is gone
[25:43] my son gave his life and you don't think
[25:45] they think sometimes all these boys and
[25:47] young men walking around enjoying their
[25:49] cars and enjoying their Liberties and
[25:51] her son died so they could enjoy them
[25:55] she feels it can you say Amen
[25:58] and and so but they're saying in this
[26:00] start that they people feel it less and
[26:02] less because they don't have a family
[26:04] member who went and didn't come back and
[26:06] they don't have a they don't know
[26:07] anybody a very small person knows
[26:09] somebody that served and died when they
[26:12] know somebody it's kind of like well my
[26:14] friend he he died over
[26:19] there they forget somebody died for them
[26:22] they don't know someone who died for
[26:24] them if you have someone step in front
[26:26] of you and take a bullet and what if you
[26:28] were standing there somebody steps out
[26:31] with a gun and they point it right at
[26:33] you and your your buddy that's sitting
[26:36] next to you today your buddy seen what
[26:38] was going to happen and jumped out and
[26:40] took the bullet for you and
[26:44] died and you had to go to the funeral of
[26:47] that friend I would say that you were
[26:50] feeling what your friend did for
[26:53] you and I would say that it would affect
[26:56] you so much emotionally
[26:58] you would cry even as a man you would
[27:00] cry and realize my buddy took the bullet
[27:03] for me and now I'm going to live my life
[27:05] in appreciation I'd say at that funeral
[27:08] you're going to be telling the
[27:10] story of your friend and you're going to
[27:13] be living your life in honor in honor
[27:16] and appreciation for what he did for you
[27:18] because you wouldn't be breathing unless
[27:20] he took that bullet for you I want to
[27:22] tell you young people this morning and
[27:24] every person under the sound of my voice
[27:26] there's a man Jesus Christ who took the
[27:28] bullet for you 2,000 years ago he took
[27:31] the bullet for you you deserve to die in
[27:33] your sin you deserve to pay for your
[27:35] sins those little sins or big sins that
[27:38] you do that should come on you and you
[27:39] should die for that but I'm here to tell
[27:42] you somebody took the bullet for
[27:46] you and the very least that you could do
