still their hearts are full of Hope yes they refuse to lose faith seriously it is as if there is an angel speaking to their souls in a still a small voice what is it that their great King has left them that makes them so unwavering from their Devotion to him why after all these years is the promise the promise of his returning enough to hold their faithfulness I just I don't understand it but never mind that it doesn't matter soon I will be the king and hope or no hope they will have nothing to say on the matter wait there's more isn't there I demand to know what it is well my Lord there's a rumor we heard the townspeople talking about it yes what of this rumor well the word is that the king is indeed alive and furthermore he's coming back to sit on that throne [Laughter] oh that's we've been hearing that for years it means nothing it's just a peasants fairy tale that they wish would come true just forget about it yes my Lord but this is different this word came by one the people call eaglehood he is their messenger of Hope the message he brings they are never false good heavens he is coming what am I to do we have we have to think of something you think help me think

an idea how much this cost my my Lord my Lord I have an idea you you have an idea yes my Lord all right well let's hear it this time well even if the old one does return [Laughter] that is my father most ridiculous idea I have ever heard in my life get back to just don't stand in the corner and leave the thinking to those who are used to it wait a minute turn around don't look at me no no in the corner don't even look at me I've got it I can make them love me I could win their hearts and their devotions even before their King returns that is it I didn't tell you to turn around actually you can turn around now that's it that's a good one but how will you make them love you my Lord oh I don't know how you're supposed to be thinking help me think think my Lord this isn't working people get up watch I should think that if you were to offer the people something they've never had before something flashy and high-tech like that new Gadget that da Vinci had that might make him love you flashy and high-tech huh it's not a bad idea but that would cost me a fortune you fool who do you think I am sir Gates now how many think of ideas that are more feasible hey hey Hey listen hey I got an idea I got an idea spit it out we could we could write up a decree that says that the people like you the best I am the best you are and we have them sign their name on it yes and if they don't sign it then we pound them yeah I like them I do enjoy a good pounding hmm foreign that might just work we make them think they're getting a choice but all the while we will lure them in with the feast and honor of the loyal people of Kingstown and while at the feast I will then ma the good reputation of The King and I will win their devotions with food in attainment and pleasures beyond their wildest dreams and while no longer in their right Minds we shall have them vote for who they want to be the next king and they will undoubtedly choose me [Laughter] I'm good yes no I am the best [Laughter] my Lord what what if they don't vote for you what if they don't vote for me come here we'll think of something a gentleman foreign yes I do like holding a sword feels good put that away
