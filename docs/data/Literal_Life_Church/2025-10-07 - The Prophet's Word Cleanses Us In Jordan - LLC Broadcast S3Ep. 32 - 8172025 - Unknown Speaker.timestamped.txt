[7:08] Oh, I calling you
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[7:14] Jesus.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Been there every time.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[7:20] &gt;&gt; here are every
[7:23] calling you.
[7:26] [Music]
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 5 and verse 9. We
[7:32] can read together. So non came with his
[7:35] horses and with his chariot and stood at
[7:37] the door of the house of Elijah Elisha.
[7:40] And Elisha sent a messenger unto him,
[7:42] saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven
[7:45] times, and thy flesh shall come again to
[7:47] thee, and thou shalt be clean." But non
[7:50] was wroth, and went away, and said,
[7:52] "Behold, I thought,"
[7:54] &gt;&gt; you know, my dad used to say, "That's
[7:56] where we get in trouble.
[7:58] Behold, I thought he would surely come
[8:01] out to me and stand and call on the name
[8:03] of the Lord his God and strike his hand
[8:06] over the place and recover the leper.
[8:09] Are not Abna and far uh Farpa uh rivers
[8:13] of Damascus better than all the waters
[8:15] of Israel. May I may I uh not wash in
[8:18] them and be clean? So he turned and went
[8:21] away in a rage. and his servants came
[8:24] near and spake unto him and said, "My
[8:26] father, if the prophet had bid thee to
[8:28] do some great thing, wouldest thou not
[8:31] have done it? How much rather than when
[8:33] he saith, wash and be clean?"
[8:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, remember the scripture in
[8:38] Isaiah, I think it is, he says, "Don't
[8:41] despise the day of small things."
[8:44] We're living in that day where God can
[8:47] get glory and bring deliverance through
[8:49] small things and small obedience to the
[8:52] Lord. Then went he down and dipped
[8:54] himself seven times in Jordan according
[8:57] to the saying of the man of God. And his
[8:59] flesh came again like unto the flesh of
[9:02] a little child and he was clean. May the
[9:06] Lord add his blessings to the word this
[9:08] morning. Once God sends
[9:12] a prophet
[9:14] and the prophet speaks that word,
[9:18] after that prophet is even gone, the
[9:21] word remains.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; And I would say it this way that once he
[9:26] speaks it to his prophet and his prophet
[9:28] goes on, it is out of the picture. What
[9:31] he said remains and it's there. If I can
[9:33] say it this way, it's in the land. God
[9:36] spoke spoke it and all of the purpose
[9:39] God gave with that word it holds its
[9:42] purpose still it holds purpose behind
[9:45] it. It holds power behind it. It will
[9:49] never return void to God. That's what
[9:51] the Bible says. God says my word will
[9:54] never return void. And we know he uses
[9:56] prophets to bring his word. But when he
[9:58] brings it and even after the prophet's
[10:01] gone, if that word has been spoken and
[10:04] it's in the land, it has the purpose in
[10:06] it. It has power in it, it'll go forth
[10:09] and reach into the whole earth. Can you
[10:11] say amen? And it will accomplish what
[10:13] God sends for it to do. There's nothing,
[10:16] and I say this, there's nothing Satan
[10:18] can do to stop that word
[10:20] &gt;&gt; once it's in motion. And when I say in
[10:23] motion, once it's been spoken and it's
[10:25] in the land and it goes out, there's
[10:27] nothing Satan can do to stop it, it's
[10:30] going to accomplish what God sent it to
[10:31] do. And so that should give us a great
[10:34] strength this morning. There's nothing
[10:35] Satan can ever do to stop it from
[10:38] reaching every seed and challenging the
[10:41] very worst of sin and habits in the
[10:44] people. Once that word has been spoken,
[10:47] it's going to go forth into every parts
[10:49] of the land. And it's going to reach his
[10:51] elected seed. It's going to call them.
[10:53] And then when that elected seed is bound
[10:56] by habits and sin and fear and whatever
[10:59] it is, that word is going to call the
[11:02] seed and it's going to deliver them from
[11:04] any habits of this age. Any leprosy, any
[11:08] sin, that word, the prophet doesn't have
[11:10] to be here, but the word is in the land.
[11:13] And the word will not return void. The
[11:16] word will still have the power in it.
[11:18] The word will still have a purpose in
[11:20] it. I'll tell you, you're not under a
[11:22] denominational word. You're living by a
[11:25] word that has power and has purpose in
[11:27] it. And it will accomplish in your life.
[11:30] Everything that you're missing, this
[11:31] word is going to provide.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're not depending on Paula
[11:36] Fontaine. Can you say amen? And you're
[11:38] glad. You should be glad of that, too.
[11:40] Or any preacher for that matter. It's
[11:42] the word that the preacher preaches. Can
[11:44] you say amen?
[11:46] &gt;&gt; When I walk out every Sunday morning and
[11:49] walk into this, I say, "Well, thank God
[11:50] there's people here today."
[11:52] &gt;&gt; It's It's a, you know, it's nice because
[11:55] you see people hungry for the word of
[11:57] God. Can you say amen? It would be bad
[11:59] if I walked out and nobody was here.
[12:01] It's hard to preach when nobody's there,
[12:03] but when people are there, then they
[12:05] know there's got to be something in this
[12:07] word for me. Can you say amen? And it's
[12:10] because when it's spoken by a prophet,
[12:12] it has the power within it to go forth
[12:14] and accomplish and in this case take us
[12:17] into a rapture. How many want to go in a
[12:19] rapture? This is a rapturing faith word
[12:21] that we're under.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; You'll never stop it. And when anybody
[12:26] who aligns themsself against a prophet's
[12:29] word,
[12:31] when anybody aligns himself against
[12:33] this, you're not aligning yourself
[12:35] against a prophet or the people who
[12:38] follow it. When you align yourself
[12:40] against the word of a prophet, that
[12:42] means trouble for you.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Great trouble in your life. You've
[12:47] aligned yourself against the wrong
[12:48] thing. You can align yourself against
[12:50] the president, against country, against
[12:52] politics, your local government, but let
[12:54] me tell you something. When you align
[12:55] yourself against not a prophet, but
[12:57] against the prophet's word that's in the
[12:59] land, you've aligned yourself against
[13:00] the wrong thing. Elisha was only
[13:03] actually carrying on the ministry of
[13:05] Elijah. That's interesting to us because
[13:07] we've had that spirit of Elijah return
[13:09] to this land according to scripture. If
[13:12] you're listening in, uh you'll be able
[13:14] to know from scripture that Elijah is
[13:16] used five times in the Bible. God so
[13:19] trusted that spirit to send that to
[13:21] speak to his people. And we're in the I
[13:23] believe the fourth time that God used it
[13:25] in our generation. He said, "I'll I'll
[13:26] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[13:28] great and dreadful day of the Lord." And
[13:30] he'll send that. It's God sending his
[13:32] servant. And then uh then he said John
[13:34] the Baptist had the spirit of Elias El
[13:36] Elias on him Elijah. And so that he
[13:38] sends it again. He's going to send it
[13:40] one more time to the Jews according to
[13:42] the book of revelations. But you see now
[13:44] in this incident when the first time
[13:46] Elijah come we realize that Elijah was
[13:49] uh was gone already and Elisha was there
[13:52] now and he had only received he received
[13:54] a double portion of Elijah's spirit. So
[13:58] we realize Elijah is not even there. But
[14:00] the word of Elijah is still carrying on.
[14:02] The word of Elijah is still in the land.
[14:05] It was years later that he pronounced
[14:07] judgment over Jezebel. But it was after
[14:09] Elijah was gone that that judgment came
[14:11] to pass.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Because everything that he said if it
[14:15] come from God, it's going to come to
[14:17] pass even when Elijah's gone.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me this morning?
[14:22] &gt;&gt; So Elisha has a double portion of this.
[14:25] And Elisha is a type of the bride. He's
[14:28] not he's he's carrying on what Elijah
[14:30] had. And and Elisha, and you even have
[14:33] that sh in there, that she, it's the
[14:35] feminine part. He's the type of the
[14:37] bride. I love to read Elisha because
[14:39] that's the days we live in. And and and
[14:41] the incident with non is something that
[14:43] happened. That's a type of our our time.
[14:46] So the bride is a prophetic people just
[14:49] like Elisha was carrying on the prophecy
[14:52] of Elijah.
[14:53] The bride, listen now, is a prophetic
[14:56] people because she is speaking and
[14:59] holding to the same word under Elijah.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; We're not just Christians, but we're a
[15:06] people. We're a prophetic people.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; We're under a prophecy. Can you say
[15:11] amen? We're under a word that's God has
[15:14] put in the land. And not just in the
[15:15] land, then he puts it in our hearts.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; This is not just church. This is not
[15:22] just another gathering of Christians.
[15:24] No, we are a prophetic people carrying
[15:27] out God's word for this age.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; And uh it it it's an amazing word. It's
[15:31] a powerful word. And it's nothing in
[15:34] herself, but she she is a prophetic
[15:36] people because she's speaking and
[15:37] holding the same word of Elijah.
[15:39] Elijah's word is in the land. It's in
[15:41] his people. His servants are carriers of
[15:44] that word. They don't have the power,
[15:46] but they have the authority with that
[15:49] word to use the power of God like a
[15:52] policeman. He doesn't have any power
[15:54] within himself, but he has authority and
[15:56] he has all the city backing him up.
[15:58] Every believer here this morning has all
[16:01] of heaven backing you up.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; You don't have a power, but you have
[16:05] authority to use the power of God. You
[16:08] don't want a power within yourself. You
[16:10] can do nothing but you have access to
[16:12] the power of God which is in the word of
[16:15] God.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then the the that word
[16:21] reaches all the way. Now now just catch
[16:24] this that word reaches all the way out
[16:27] to the even to the headquarters of the
[16:30] Syrian army to a man named Non who was a
[16:33] captain in the Syrian army. So watch how
[16:35] far that word goes. Now it reaches all
[16:38] the way to the headquarters of the enemy
[16:40] army, Syrian army, uh the ones that
[16:43] fighting against Israel.
[16:45] The word reaches in there by a little
[16:48] maid girl that's she's away. She's in
[16:51] captivity, but the word of the prophet
[16:54] reaches through a little maid girl and
[16:57] she sees an incident and there's no cure
[17:00] for it. There's no cure for leprosy, but
[17:02] she knows there's a prophetic word.
[17:05] There's a prophet. There is a source
[17:08] that's in the land for deliverance for
[17:11] something that's completely incurable.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; How many know how many incurable
[17:18] diseases we got today and we're trying
[17:20] to get sights. We're trying to tackle
[17:22] all of them. But listen now, when
[17:23] there's no cure for a habit or a sin or
[17:27] a demon, there is a cure within the
[17:29] land. And we are witnesses to that.
[17:33] We are carriers of that word.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; This little girl, she starts to hear
[17:39] this. And I'm getting ahead of myself,
[17:41] but she just says, "Listen, there's a
[17:43] word in the land."
[17:45] &gt;&gt; If you can get to that word, leprosy,
[17:47] not leprosy is not a problem.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I feel like shouting
[17:52] this morning.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; You know that beyond what you think of
[17:55] yourself, the word that he's put in this
[17:57] land and put in your heart is more
[17:59] powerful than any demon that can come
[18:01] against your life. It's more powerful
[18:03] than any anxiety. It's more powerful
[18:05] than any trial in your life. It's not
[18:08] you. It's the word he's placed within
[18:10] you.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word reached all the
[18:14] way to the headquarters of a army that
[18:16] was fighting against Israel. And the
[18:18] little maid girl working in non's home
[18:20] in captivity, away from all the comfort
[18:23] of her own people and her own church,
[18:26] away from all the comforts. We got it
[18:28] pretty nice today. We got believers that
[18:30] we can fellowship with. We got to come.
[18:32] Our children have a pretty safe place to
[18:34] be. But this girl was taken away from
[18:36] her parents, away from her church just
[18:38] like Daniel was and his friends
[18:39] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. They
[18:41] were taken into Babylon, away from
[18:43] Jerusalem, away from the comfort of
[18:45] being able to go to church every week.
[18:47] And we don't know how much pressures
[18:49] we'll come against. But when that word,
[18:51] when you're carrying that word, you can
[18:53] be in the worst of Babylon. You can be
[18:55] of the worst of atmospheres. Can I get
[18:57] an amen this one? You can be in in your
[19:00] employment or your school in the worst
[19:02] of atmospheres and you're carrying
[19:05] something within you. That's the word of
[19:07] the Lord.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't ever
[19:14] underestimate that word and where it
[19:17] will reach and the witness of it. That's
[19:19] right.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the last days message of
[19:23] Christ that we preach is man-made, it
[19:26] should have never reached as far as it
[19:29] has today.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; I preach the message of Christ for the
[19:35] last days, and if it was man-made, it
[19:37] would have never reached as far as it's
[19:40] reached.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; True. because it's God's word
[19:44] &gt;&gt; where it's it's going gone into country
[19:46] countries that to me and I could
[19:48] elaborate on this but to me I it it went
[19:52] against all communism in countries. It's
[19:55] getting into places that it's never
[19:57] going to get in there. It's never going
[19:59] to be accepted there. But somehow it's
[20:01] getting in cuz God's looking for his
[20:02] elected seed.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Don't ever estimate where the word will
[20:07] reach and the witness of it. If this
[20:09] last days message of Christ is man-made,
[20:11] it would have never reached as far as
[20:12] this. God had a little cleaning girl way
[20:16] away from her people. But she got a
[20:18] source that she can tell pe people
[20:20] about. And as she heard conversations in
[20:22] the home like, and I'm just elaborating,
[20:25] how in the world did our great captain
[20:27] non get leprosy? Our master, he's
[20:31] honorable. He's mighty. He's a mighty
[20:34] warrior. How in the world did he get lep
[20:37] leprosy? It's not fair. We learned
[20:39] something this morning. We learned that
[20:41] leprosy, which is a type of sin, can
[20:43] affect anyone.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; It's a captain in the Syrian army. And
[20:50] the Bible says in chapter 5 and verse
[20:51] one, a man with his master in honorable
[20:54] because by him the Lord had given
[20:55] deliverance into Syria. He was also a
[20:57] mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.
[20:59] And so this teaches us something. Sin,
[21:02] leprosy, can get to anybody. I don't
[21:05] care how much money you have. Can I get
[21:07] an amen?
[21:09] &gt;&gt; He He was It can Your position in the
[21:12] world doesn't matter. Your money doesn't
[21:14] matter. Your status does not make you I
[21:16] hope you're listening online this
[21:17] morning as well and all the broadcasts.
[21:20] Sin can reach if you've got all the
[21:22] money in the world. If you got all the
[21:24] position in the world, if you're the
[21:26] president, whatever position, your
[21:28] status does not make you immune from the
[21:31] disease of sin.
[21:35] And let me just say this,
[21:37] &gt;&gt; the disease of sin, except by the blood
[21:40] and the token, we're not immune from it
[21:43] either.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm in the message. I've been in
[21:46] the message for 40 years. Those things
[21:48] don't bother me. You live in the flesh,
[21:50] my brother. Twothirds of you is not born
[21:52] again.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; And if you give yourself to the wrong
[21:55] thing, you'll take on the disease of
[21:57] sin. It may not get to your soul, but
[21:59] it'll start to work in your life. You
[22:01] feed on the wrong things and you're
[22:03] going to start taking the disease of sin
[22:05] in your life. You're gonna It doesn't
[22:07] matter because sin will go to any it'll
[22:09] take you further than you want to go. It
[22:11] touched a a mighty warrior here that
[22:14] would have never expected. And that's
[22:15] why we need to realize we start saying,
[22:17] "Well, this is unfair. That person lives
[22:19] such a good life. Why were they struck
[22:21] with this disease?"
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever said that?
[22:25] It just seems so unfair that they would
[22:28] get this particular let somebody else
[22:30] get it. That's a bad person.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; No, Satan don't work that way.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't work that way. He goes for
[22:40] the juggler. He goes for anybody and
[22:43] especially believers.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; If he would want to strike somebody with
[22:48] cancer, he's going to strike a believer.
[22:51] But he doesn't know when he strikes a
[22:53] believer, he's in big trouble.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; When he strikes a believer, he's dealing
[23:00] with something different because he he
[23:03] didn't he's not going to know what hit
[23:04] him. Can you say amen? He's not going to
[23:07] know what hit him because he struck the
[23:09] wrong thing,
[23:11] &gt;&gt; the wrong person. Because if they're
[23:13] carrying that word, if God decides to
[23:15] take them, that's still up to God.
[23:17] That's still a victory in God. But
[23:18] listen now, he tries to get this to
[23:21] believers and all these diseases,
[23:23] especially the disease s, you know, the
[23:25] disease of sin is worse than cancer.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; And and we get nervous about that and
[23:30] and and and sometimes we're human, we do
[23:32] that. But let me tell you what you feed
[23:34] on in worldly things. And the disease
[23:36] you can get from that is worse than the
[23:38] disease of cancer. Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; The disease of the mind and the disease
[23:43] of uh things that come to your spirit,
[23:45] emotions and mind, it's worse.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; So,
[23:55] we learn that leprosy, sin can affect
[23:57] anyone. Your position in the world, all
[23:58] these other things doesn't matter. But
[24:00] also, we learn that this word will reach
[24:03] anyone. So, the the the disease of sin,
[24:05] leprosy struck somebody that we wouldn't
[24:07] expect. But you see now we also the
[24:10] positive thing is the word that will
[24:12] deliver them will reach anyone as well.
[24:14] This little young person must have had
[24:16] the belief that the healing is in the
[24:18] word and it was for everyone. Otherwise,
[24:20] she wouldn't have been testifying in the
[24:22] house. She believed it was for everyone.
[24:25] She believed this word. If they'll
[24:26] respond to it and go to it, it's for
[24:28] everyone. Listen, we don't have a right
[24:31] to be exclusive with this message. Can
[24:33] you sign a man?
[24:34] &gt;&gt; It's for everyone who will believe. I
[24:37] know there's predestinated seed. I know
[24:40] there's categories, but we don't worry
[24:41] about this category. That little girl
[24:44] said she if she would have been
[24:45] selective, if she would have been said,
[24:47] "Well, these guys aren't even believers
[24:49] and they're the enemy." If she'd have
[24:51] had that attitude, he wouldn't have got
[24:53] his deliverance before she even said
[24:55] something. She had to have the attitude,
[24:58] "This word is for everybody." Yes.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; She'd have looked at that man and said,
[25:06] "This is a cusser. He's cussing all the
[25:08] time around. I can't even stand the
[25:10] atmosphere. He's drinking. He's got all
[25:12] kinds of this stuff around his body.
[25:14] He's, you know, if we judge people by
[25:16] how they look on the outside, they will
[25:18] start thinking, "This word must have
[25:20] been for me
[25:22] &gt;&gt; and not them."
[25:26] &gt;&gt; She didn't do that. She didn't have that
[25:28] attitude. Anybody listening this
[25:30] morning? I'm trying to correct a lot of
[25:32] message pride that says we're better
[25:34] than everybody else and we got an
[25:36] exclusion on this word. It's ours and
[25:38] we're going into rapture and the rest of
[25:40] us cannon fodder. That's that's terms
[25:43] that a prophet can use. But you be
[25:44] careful how you use those because you
[25:46] might rule somebody out.
[25:51] [Applause]
[25:53] &gt;&gt; She's here. She's hearing them talk and
[25:55] say, "Why does this have to come to him
[25:57] for days? This is not fair. He's got
[26:00] this leprosy all over his skin. He could
[26:03] die of it." And even though there was no
[26:06] cure,
[26:09] the word of a prophet, she she pipes up
[26:11] and says, "I know a man. If you can get
[26:14] to him, if you can get there, you can be
[26:16] delivered of this leprosy."
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Leprosy is an infectious disease. How
[26:21] many knew that leprosy is an infectious
[26:23] disease and it's on the skin by the way
[26:25] which we might point out that leprosy is
[26:27] a type of sin. Brother Bram says there
[26:29] are some diseases so subtle and creep in
[26:32] so slow that it takes a a specialist not
[26:34] just a regular doctor. The way sin
[26:36] creeps in our life today it takes the
[26:38] word a word that's got a word that's got
[26:40] the devil's number and knows what he's
[26:42] talking about. Just as God makes a way
[26:44] of escape from temptation. How many
[26:46] believe God will make a way of escape
[26:48] from temptation? Yes. The Bible says
[26:51] that. But you see now, he also makes a
[26:54] way and a remedy for every part of sin.
[26:56] The nature of sin and the influence of
[26:59] sin. It's not just having the nature of
[27:01] sin that you're born with. Calvary, the
[27:03] blood takes care of the very nature of
[27:05] sin. That's why you need a new birth
[27:08] because you were born with the nature of
[27:10] sin. That's why you like to sin. That's
[27:12] why you like to you're attracted to
[27:14] things in the world. That's the nature
[27:15] of sin. Calvary kills the nature and
[27:18] desire of sin. But also there's an
[27:21] influence of sin.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; And the blood also has power. The word
[27:27] has power against the influence
[27:30] &gt;&gt; of sin. Whatever it is this morning, the
[27:33] atonement says if you'll repent and
[27:35] mourn and say, "God, I bring my life
[27:37] under this feast of atonement." He says
[27:40] he'll answer back, "Forgive you
[27:42] completely."
[27:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. You no longer had to sit
[27:48] there this morning thinking, "This is
[27:49] for everybody else, but I'll never get
[27:51] in." That's a lie of the devil. This
[27:53] blood is for your mistakes. This blood
[27:56] is for your sin. Every one of you have a
[27:58] story, and none of you wanted the story
[28:00] that you got.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; But you have a story, and the story
[28:04] doesn't end with just your problems. The
[28:07] story ends in redemption. for watching
