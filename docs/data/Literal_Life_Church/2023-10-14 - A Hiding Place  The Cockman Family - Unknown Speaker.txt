[Music] in the distance I can see the storm clouds coming my way and I need to find a shelter before it starts to rain so I turn and run to you Lord You're the only place to go Your unfailing Love surrounds me when I need it more you're my Hiding Place safe in your Embrace I'm protect from the storm that rages and when the wers rise and I run to hide Lord in you I find my Hiding Place I'm not asking you to take away my troubles Lord cuz it's through the stormy weather I've learned to trust you more and so I thank you for your promise that I have come to know your unfailing love surrounds me when when I need it most you're my Hiding Place safe in your Embrace I'm protect from the storm that rages and when the waterers rise and I run to to hide Lord in you I find my Hiding Place oh let your people seek you while you may be found cuz you're only Refuge when the rain comes pouring down you're my Hiding Place safe in your Embrace I'm protected from the storm that raes and when the waters rise and I run too high Lord in you I find my highing place you're my heart Hiding Place safe in your Embrace I'm protected from the storm that [Music] rages and when the waterers rise and I run too hard Lord in you I find my Hiding Place Lord in you I find my Hiding Place [Music]
