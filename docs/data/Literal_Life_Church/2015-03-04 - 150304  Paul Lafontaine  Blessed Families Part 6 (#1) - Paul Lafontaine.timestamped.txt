[0:50] all who's come to the house of the Lord
[0:52] tonight on this Wednesday night and
[0:54] we're looking forward to Spring aren't
[0:55] we looking forward to Spring just around
[0:57] the corner it's getting close now amen
[1:00] well I want to speak on blessed F
[1:02] families again tonight this will be part
[1:04] six and we want to take the next place
[1:06] in the scripture that speaks of families
[1:08] in Joshua chapter 7 here and we're
[1:10] taking this really slow each place that
[1:12] it mentions this word families or I
[1:15] shouldn't say every place but uh each
[1:17] place that I feel led to just slow down
[1:20] and and comment on and and preach on
[1:22] that's what we're trying to do and we've
[1:24] garnered I believe some good things from
[1:26] it so Joshua chapter
[1:28] 7 and as we we read we'll just read one
[1:30] scripture and then we can comment on the
[1:33] the text uh and this is chapter 7 of
[1:36] course is when Joshua had discovered
[1:38] Joshua becomes very concerned because
[1:40] the 36 men had died in a battle and uh
[1:44] so his first question is what's wrong
[1:46] what's taking place be and the reason
[1:48] why he's asking that is that's not
[1:49] supposed to take place uh a Christian a
[1:52] believer in battle is supposed to be in
[1:54] Victory his battles are supposed all
[1:57] their battles are supposed to come to
[1:58] victories and uh we should be concerned
[2:00] when we don't have a VI victory that
[2:02] something's wrong and try to figure out
[2:04] what's wrong and that's what happened
[2:06] here after the it's the Second Battle
[2:08] within their promised land when they
[2:09] were going against AI 36 men died and so
[2:12] Joshua was going before the Lord and so
[2:14] then in in chapter 7 verse 14 we'll just
[2:16] read as they were trying to uh give give
[2:19] the instructions of how to trace this
[2:21] down in the morning therefore ye shall
[2:23] be brought according to your tribes and
[2:26] it shall be that the tribe which the
[2:27] lord taketh shall come according to the
[2:29] their families thereof and the family
[2:32] which the Lord uh shall take shall come
[2:36] by households and the household which
[2:38] the Lord shall take shall come Man by
[2:41] man as God just narrows it down there
[2:43] and brings it down to the families and
[2:46] we discovered that it was a family then
[2:48] one family in
[2:50] particular uh achen and his family that
[2:53] had taken a a Babylonian garment and a
[2:56] gold wedge uh some silver from uh uh the
[3:01] uh B last battle and when they did that
[3:03] of course that was the thing that
[3:04] brought this curse upon Israel where
[3:06] they couldn't come to this Victory let's
[3:09] have a word of prayer heavenly father
[3:10] it's good to be here tonight Lord and to
[3:12] lift our voices and hearts to you we
[3:15] pray father that as we just settle down
[3:18] now Lord in your presence we're thankful
[3:20] that we have this type of place to come
[3:22] to that we can be refreshed Lord there's
[3:25] not many places in this world we have
[3:27] this anymore but we're so thankful that
[3:29] we can come and I look forward to
[3:31] gathering with the Saints and opening
[3:33] the scriptures breaking bread together I
[3:35] look forward to this time to just just
[3:37] get a clean slate just just get
[3:39] refreshed Lord from all the pressures
[3:41] that we feel and we pray that you will
[3:43] do that Lord may this be a a refreshing
[3:46] drink of water lord for the Saints
[3:47] tonight those who are listening on the
[3:49] internet may it just be a time that we
[3:51] can leave here saying it's been good to
[3:53] be in the house of the Lord bless our
[3:55] families bless the series on the family
[3:57] Lord each family in the church just be
[4:00] blessed by it and learn of it the heads
[4:01] of the homes may we learn from the
[4:03] scriptures Lord what it means to be a
[4:05] blessed family we commit this service to
[4:07] you now and and all that will be said in
[4:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask
[4:11] it amen amen you may be seated tonight
[4:14] God bless
[4:15] you we sit had an encouraging thought I
[4:18] think last Wednesday night and look at
[4:20] these things looking at these things and
[4:22] seeing uh back when we were speaking of
[4:25] them coming into the promised land and
[4:27] I'm just going back just a little bit to
[4:29] because we we know in uh chapter we were
[4:32] going back into Moses bringing the laws
[4:35] and such and then in Deuteronomy when he
[4:37] speaks in chapter six of teaching him to
[4:39] his children we learned last Wednesday
[4:41] that there were three things there was
[4:43] Commandments there was statutes and
[4:45] there was judgments and all those mean
[4:47] different things but Moses message and
[4:50] Moses law that came from God had all of
[4:53] those elements within it Commandments
[4:56] and statues which were boundaries limits
[4:58] and boundaries and then judgments which
[5:00] was uh making judgment calls on
[5:03] something like in a court case and all
[5:05] of those things were part of Moses
[5:07] message and Deuteronomy 6 uh brought it
[5:11] as a mandate for parents that I want you
[5:13] to teach these things to your children
[5:15] um all of them Commandments the statutes
[5:17] the judgments I want you to continually
[5:19] teach these things that may they may
[5:21] know the in other words he wanted them
[5:22] to teach them talk about them when they
[5:25] got up talk about them when they went to
[5:26] bed have them upon the the post and
[5:28] everywhere around your house and keep
[5:30] the word in front of them because we
[5:32] have a tendency to forget don't we and
[5:34] so God wants us to keep the word before
[5:37] him because we tend to idolatry we tend
[5:39] to being attracted to fleshly things and
[5:41] the only way to combat that is to keep
[5:44] the word ever ever before us and he
[5:46] wanted them to keep the word before
[5:48] their children keep the statues keep the
[5:50] boundaries so they could re be reminded
[5:52] this is how we live as Believers this is
[5:54] what we do that's what they do but this
[5:56] is what we do and so I thought it was a
[5:57] wonderful thing to see that but it was
[5:59] more more wonderful to see that as they
[6:01] went into the promised land and Moses
[6:03] died the prophet died then Joshua was
[6:06] commissioned to take them into their
[6:07] inheritance and in the first few verses
[6:10] we find that he still wanted them to
[6:12] teach them to their children and he
[6:14] didn't want this law to depart from
[6:16] their hearts and their minds and so
[6:19] there would even though that the
[6:20] emphasis came unto the inheritance of
[6:22] the children of Israel that's why he
[6:23] took them out of Egypt he had a land for
[6:25] them the emphasis was the land the
[6:27] emphasis was their inheritance the
[6:29] emphasis is to go and take that it
[6:31] wasn't the law and yet they had there
[6:33] was some part the the law was so
[6:35] important that they couldn't go into the
[6:37] promised land and overcome without it
[6:39] because he says don't let this depart
[6:41] what Moses said keep it with you teach
[6:43] it to your children don't let it depart
[6:45] out of your mouth keep these principles
[6:47] intact because you're going to need them
[6:49] in the promised land you're going to
[6:51] need them as you come in your ha you're
[6:52] going to need them to overcome so as we
[6:54] follow it through if he gave that to
[6:56] families and heads of the homes to keep
[6:59] that uh word always before their
[7:02] children and to each generation then he
[7:04] kept it and continued it on scripture
[7:06] when they come into their Promised Land
[7:07] we would think that they maybe wouldn't
[7:09] need that anymore or not need it as much
[7:11] but he was uh so clear to say hey you
[7:15] don't let those things though continue
[7:17] to teach those to your children to your
[7:19] wives to your families because they are
[7:21] important now when we come to this story
[7:23] here of aen it mentions them breaking
[7:25] down to the tribes and the families to
[7:26] find out who had done this and who uh
[7:29] had uh disobeyed god um then we want to
[7:33] look at the some of the reason CU we
[7:35] realize that uh they took something that
[7:37] was cursed and they hid it in their tent
[7:39] they felt like a I don't know what achen
[7:41] was thinking as uh as a man uh the
[7:44] prophet mentions a couple places that he
[7:47] figured that they could use this garment
[7:48] and it would be something nice for them
[7:50] to wear and they could certainly use the
[7:52] money uh they figured maybe down the
[7:54] road he was thinking ahead so he was
[7:55] thinking probably very common sense and
[7:57] saying it won't be a big problem to take
[8:00] this and the the problem was not was not
[8:02] with the silver itself or the actual
[8:04] garment itself the problem is God had
[8:07] said this city uh Jericho has a curse on
[8:11] it and he said everything in it has a
[8:13] curse with it and so because God had
[8:16] already said that it wasn't necessarily
[8:18] the Garment as much as it what was the
[8:21] trouble that came with taking it or the
[8:23] curse that came with it and so we learn
[8:26] a very simple lesson that sometimes
[8:28] something can be innocent of itself but
[8:30] whatever it's attached to can carry a
[8:32] curse with it we have to be mature and
[8:34] learn that can you say Amen we have to
[8:36] we have to make choices as Christians
[8:38] sometimes not based upon the Flesh of
[8:40] course and not based upon big arguments
[8:43] uh and get into arguments whether it's
[8:45] right or it's wrong but uh we look at
[8:47] the long-term results and we look at
[8:49] something whether it has whether it
[8:51] brings trouble with it I've I we have
[8:53] done certain things and uh uh you I
[8:55] don't know an example right now but I
[8:57] can think of just my family and the and
[8:59] uh in just trying to raise a family um
[9:01] you try something and and and uh you
[9:04] realize after there's trouble that comes
[9:06] from it uh there's there's H problems
[9:09] that come with it and uh and and not not
[9:12] little trouble but it starts to be big
[9:13] trouble uh and and so you realize that
[9:17] sometimes in a lot of things you don't
[9:19] discover it till afterwards that there's
[9:21] trouble that comes with something
[9:22] there's there's there's a curse that
[9:24] comes with something so then you got to
[9:25] make a mature uh uh decision as a
[9:28] Christian now uh that that we we have to
[9:32] uh Purge things from our lives that are
[9:35] causing trouble that are uh thwarting
[9:38] the blessing from our lives Something's
[9:40] Happened something's changed something
[9:42] it's just it's just saying the same
[9:43] thing that Joshua said something's wrong
[9:47] and I don't know what it is but
[9:48] something's not right something's not
[9:50] like it was and I'm not in in in living
[9:53] in Victory like I was I'm not overcoming
[9:55] like I was listen we are here on this
[9:58] Earth to be
[10:00] Overcomers we are here to live
[10:02] Spirit-filled lives as Christians and so
[10:05] now anything that interrupts that
[10:08] progress is your enemy that's right amen
[10:11] that's right that's what we're here for
[10:12] we're not here to make money we're not
[10:13] here to uh serve the community if you do
[10:16] that I I do that you should do that it's
[10:18] fine but that's not our main purpose of
[10:20] being here we are to become
[10:22] Spirit-filled Christians full of the
[10:24] Holy Ghost growing to the image of Jesus
[10:26] Christ and going to a Rapture coming
[10:28] into adoption mature Christians that's
[10:30] what we're here for to live overcoming
[10:33] lives to be one of those in leoda that's
[10:35] called an
[10:37] overcomer and so anything that
[10:39] interrupts that process is our enemy yes
[10:42] amen and needs to be Lay Laid aside
[10:45] especially when it has something that
[10:46] brings trouble to having Victorious
[10:48] battles so there was something they took
[10:50] that had a curse with it and they took
[10:52] it and they hid it and there was trouble
[10:54] that came with it and they were affected
[10:56] in the victory in the next battle and uh
[10:59] and so I guess the question is does this
[11:01] apply today does this apply today does
[11:04] this principle of them doing taking
[11:07] something that's cursed bringing it into
[11:09] their home and put and hiding it and not
[11:11] telling anybody about it and all of a
[11:13] sudden now it affects the rest of the
[11:15] body it affects the Army it affects
[11:18] other believers it affects their own
[11:20] home it starts to affect things I am I'm
[11:23] asking you does that principle still
[11:25] apply today well I know it applies
[11:27] because I've lived it out
[11:30] I mean I can show you scriptures where
[11:31] it still applies today in the New
[11:32] Testament but but you see now I know it
[11:35] because I have lived out and how many
[11:37] can say I have you have lived it out as
[11:39] well just three or four of us all right
[11:42] well uh we appreciate the honesty in
[11:45] some hey I've been there done that every
[11:48] Christian should should have lived
[11:49] through that process of realizing you
[11:52] Incorporated something in your life and
[11:54] you had nothing but trouble with it and
[11:56] it didn't lead you closer to the Lord
[11:59] and you become more fleshly with it and
[12:02] so it might even be innocent but you
[12:04] became more fleshly and your priorities
[12:05] changed and you weren't into the word as
[12:07] much so let's not have a 10-day argument
[12:11] as far whether it's technically right
[12:12] and get me a quote for it and everything
[12:13] else is it hindering your Christian walk
[12:17] is it making you fleshly in carnal
[12:20] instead of Spirit-filled and that's your
[12:22] that's your decision that's where it's
[12:25] at the pastor doesn't come have to come
[12:26] and tell you that the Holy Ghost tells
[12:28] you that amen but I need a quote I got
[12:30] to see a quote well I'll try to find it
[12:32] for you but you need to be led by the
[12:34] holy spirit that whatever is
[12:36] interrupting your spirit filled life is
[12:38] your
[12:39] enemy that's your battle my friend
[12:42] praise the Lord so we have to look at
[12:45] life as a Christian this way we we we
[12:47] can't be childish and say I don't want
[12:49] that taken away from me and I I've
[12:51] always wanted to keep that and I'm
[12:52] keeping it no matter what anybody says
[12:54] we can't be babies that way we're not
[12:57] supposed to be babies we're supposed to
[12:58] be mature Sons and Daughters of God
[13:01] growing by Grace into a Spirit-filled
[13:04] life knowing what it means to be uh
[13:07] walking in the spirit knowing what it
[13:09] means to hear his voice and follow his
[13:11] voice every day for him to be leading
[13:13] our hearts can you say Amen instead
[13:16] quite often we're led by all kinds of
[13:17] other voices and we don't we we got to
[13:20] get where we're listening to that still
[13:21] Small Voice praise the Lord and so now
[13:24] uh we know that this from experience and
[13:26] we've seen these things and we know this
[13:28] principle does apply Li still today uh
[13:30] in 20 some years of pastoring we've seen
[13:32] it in the church as someone makes a
[13:34] choice to do something Church the holy
[13:36] spirit leaving the the congregation in a
[13:37] certain direction and somebody chooses
[13:39] no they're going to do something
[13:40] completely opposite of that you may not
[13:42] see the effects right away but I've
[13:44] watched it you start to see the effects
[13:46] you start to see the influence to the
[13:48] other young people or the other people
[13:50] in the church and you start to see they
[13:51] deteriorating spiritually and so I I
[13:54] this principle applies that if you take
[13:57] something and even hide it if it's not
[13:59] the right thing it will show up
[14:02] someday no doubt about it we're still
[14:04] human beings God still works the same
[14:05] way and this principle still works the
[14:07] same way as far as a body we are a body
[14:09] so what we do affects one another praise
[14:12] the Lord so we're going to have losses
[14:13] when we do that in the Old Testament
[14:15] it's it's real it's physical losses it's
[14:17] like people die in battle right but we
[14:20] know that as a whole thing is a type of
[14:22] a spiritual death that can take place
[14:25] within the
[14:26] church spiritual death will take place
[14:29] in families there's families that have
[14:31] spiritually died spiritually died
[14:34] they're not going on with Christ today
[14:36] because the message became a religion to
[14:38] them true right they Incorporated
[14:41] something that wasn't the core of what
[14:43] it really is and so they bring that in
[14:45] even a religious idea and add it to it
[14:47] and form something out of it and all of
[14:49] a sudden now you've got a babylonius
[14:50] garment there you've got reasoning there
[14:52] you got something added to it and
[14:54] eventually it brings death it brings
[14:56] death to somebody there's losses
[14:58] somewhere yes a lot of times in the
[15:00] children so now let's let's step back
[15:02] here and talk a little bit about curses
[15:04] and blessings because that's such a a
[15:06] subject that's uh in the Bible so much
[15:10] and so I wanted to talk a little bit
[15:11] about blessings and CH because we're
[15:13] preaching on blessed families right we
[15:15] want to be a blessed family and to be
[15:18] blessed of course is to to have Divine
[15:21] approval to have the favor of God we've
[15:24] talked about it being happy families
[15:26] blessed families to be blessed to be
[15:28] happy to be fortunate to be prosperous
[15:31] first of all spiritually and then even
[15:34] in other ways to be prosperous that's a
[15:36] blessed family of God and and to let me
[15:38] just say it this way if we're blessed in
[15:40] in other ways and natural things of Life
[15:42] The Blessing really is that we're
[15:44] content with what God gives us and we're
[15:46] pleased with what God gives us because
[15:48] you're not really blessed if you're
[15:49] discontent all the time with how much
[15:51] money you got so the blessing is that
[15:53] you live with contentment with what you
[15:55] have so that's a blessed family and and
[15:57] and that God has pleased with you and
[15:59] you're walking with the word doesn't
[16:01] mean you're perfect but you're walking
[16:02] with the word and you're you're that's
[16:04] what being under the blessings of God
[16:06] means and being blessed and we and God
[16:08] has certainly blessed us uh so much in
[16:11] the last days as a people now C the
[16:14] curse having a curse on our lives is the
[16:17] course the opposite of that it's the
[16:19] opposite of happy uh having the uh some
[16:21] cloud or curse come in your life uh
[16:23] doesn't bring happiness and it means the
[16:26] invoking of an evil or the invoking of
[16:28] trust trouble coming in your life and
[16:31] maybe the windows of Heaven were opened
[16:32] but now the windows of Heaven are closed
[16:34] it means to be afflicted by something it
[16:37] does not it does not mean that every
[16:38] time Trouble Comes it's a curse and I
[16:41] really have to clarify this because
[16:42] often we think a bit mature in this way
[16:44] is that if any trouble comes in our life
[16:47] we're under a curse there's a spell
[16:49] somebody cast on us right we can't say
[16:52] that because troubles are used to cause
[16:55] us to grow in the Lord God allows
[16:58] certain troubles to come to our lives so
[17:00] we can't technically say that every time
[17:02] we get in trouble we're under a curse
[17:04] but we can say sometimes we can bring
[17:06] God's displeasing in our lives and we
[17:08] can come underneath a cloud for a
[17:10] certain time and things aren't happy
[17:12] think things aren't peachy the family's
[17:14] not happy uh and things aren't the way
[17:16] they were you're just not blessed and
[17:19] and we must be careful not to attach God
[17:22] cursing us when troubles come but this
[17:25] this curse is an evil Affliction that
[17:27] takes over often
[17:29] often not from God but takes over by our
[17:33] own Disobedience or someone else's
[17:36] influence a curse can come on your life
[17:40] by your Disobedience or by somebody
[17:42] else's words or
[17:45] influence they can cast a spell on you a
[17:48] lot of times people they get depressed
[17:50] because somebody had said something
[17:51] about them maybe even years ago and
[17:53] they're living under the curse of what
[17:55] that person says they're living under
[17:57] that that what was said it might have
[17:58] been a parent years ago something was
[18:00] said and so that power of what they said
[18:02] is still hanging over that person and so
[18:05] it kind of puts a curse that puts this
[18:07] uh Affliction upon somebody and they
[18:10] live with that they live under that that
[18:12] cloud all the time so but we must
[18:14] remember it's not uh it's not God
[18:17] necessarily inflicting that as we might
[18:20] think I'll read this to you that the
[18:21] prophet said the cloudy skies and the
[18:24] storms of life are no signs of God's
[18:27] disapproval Nei neither are bright skies
[18:30] and Still Waters signs of his love and
[18:32] approval his approval of any of us is
[18:35] only in the Beloved his love is elective
[18:38] which he had for us before the
[18:39] foundation of the world see his love
[18:41] goes deeper than just if it's a sunshiny
[18:44] day oh God must really love us more
[18:46] today exactly right that's pretty
[18:48] immature or if it's or if it's like it's
[18:51] been a lot of the winter with a lot of
[18:53] snow and a lot of cold and some days are
[18:56] so dreary well God must not love us as
[18:59] much
[19:00] today that's very immature isn't it and
[19:03] so his love
