[6:54] you
[6:56] Jesus done it before
[7:00] here we are
[7:03] Lord I'm calling
[7:05] you
[7:10] need said in Luke 21 verse
[7:15] 34 take heed to
[7:18] yourselves as he's mentioned the
[7:20] earthquakes and and diverse places and
[7:23] all the signs of the end time now he
[7:24] says to give attention to yourselves
[7:27] lest at any time your heart be
[7:29] overcharged with surfing and drunkenness
[7:33] and cares of this life so that that day
[7:35] come upon you unawares for as a snare
[7:38] shall it come upon all them that dwell
[7:40] in the face of the whole earth watch ye
[7:42] therefore and pray always watch ye
[7:46] therefore and pray always so this is
[7:48] this is an attention given to your heart
[7:51] that it does not become overwhelmed and
[7:54] overburdened overcharged in these times
[7:57] if he told us in these times to give a
[7:59] attention to your heart that it don't
[8:01] become overloaded I think we should take
[8:03] the Lord's word and I think we should
[8:05] pray always and I I think we should
[8:07] watch always what are we watching over
[8:10] our hearts and our
[8:12] minds he said to do that and and that we
[8:15] may be accounted worthy to escape all
[8:17] these things that that shall come to
[8:19] pass and to stand before the son of man
[8:23] so don't let your heart and mind become
[8:26] overloaded overcharged with surfeiting
[8:29] and surfing means to desire no more of
[8:33] something as a result of consumed it or
[8:35] having it in excess in other words when
[8:38] we have things in excess then our hearts
[8:41] become overwhelmed that we don't even
[8:44] desire that thing much anymore we're on
[8:46] to the next thing because we've become
[8:48] overburdened and over we've had things
[8:50] in excess us Americans we have things in
[8:54] excess our minds are overwhelmed with
[8:57] the excess of everything that's right so
[9:00] Jesus God knew what age we live in he
[9:04] said that's what's going to happen in
[9:05] this time so he said to desire no more
[9:08] of something as a result of having
[9:09] consumed it or done it to an excess then
[9:11] he mentions drunkenness with its
[9:13] excessive consumption of something
[9:15] that's not just alcohol that's being
[9:18] excessive in the consumption of
[9:20] something until you become in a drunken
[9:22] condition and a numb condition and then
[9:25] he says which is a little bit more
[9:27] explainable the worries the anx xiety of
[9:30] Life becoming overwhelmed by the worries
[9:33] and cares and anxi anxiety of life I'd
[9:36] like to add something to this this
[9:38] morning in 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath
[9:43] not given us the spirit of
[9:47] fear we know that if that's hitting our
[9:50] minds and hitting our hearts and
[9:52] challenging us we know it didn't come
[9:55] from God
[9:57] right he has not given us the spirit of
[10:00] fear but what kind of spirit has he
[10:02] given us one of power and of
[10:06] love and of a sound
[10:10] mind that's his promise so in this time
[10:14] of trouble in this age he said my spirit
[10:18] will provide Power love and a sound mind
[10:22] he says there in 2 Timothy 1:7 if you
[10:25] want to put it up again in the King
[10:26] James in the Amplified that God God says
[10:30] it here and the Amplified this is just
[10:33] amplifies it a little bit for God did
[10:35] not give us a spirit of timid or kis or
[10:39] fear kise or fear he's not given us a
[10:42] spirit of fear he has given us a spirit
[10:44] of power and of love and of sound
[10:47] judgment and personal discipline
[10:50] abilities that result in a calm well
[10:54] balanced mind and self-control now that
[10:57] might be seem like it's adding to it but
[10:59] I like to be able to read that to show
[11:01] when he says he's given us the spirit of
[11:04] power love and a sound mind then it
[11:06] explains a little better that he
[11:08] provides sound judgment why does he have
[11:10] to provide that because in this age we
[11:12] don't have sound judgment and personal
[11:14] disciplin and then and the abilities
[11:17] that result in a calm in a peace well
[11:20] balanced mind and self-control these are
[11:23] going to become things that we need more
[11:25] and more A sound mind and a clear
[11:27] thinking mind and a mind that can make
[11:30] decisions based upon the word of God is
[11:32] going to become more and more important
[11:34] to us as the days roll on your mind
[11:37] needs to be protected from outside
[11:39] influences your heart and emotions and
[11:42] mind you need to have a guard over them
[11:44] as we said last Sunday and it's it's you
[11:47] might have seen okay this is important
[11:49] but this is really important that we
[11:51] have a sound sober thinking mind in this
[11:54] hour that we have this Spirit of love
[11:56] that we have this Spirit of power
[11:58] because we will be become weakened by
[12:00] the AIDS that we live in so in just
[12:02] reminding us some things he said last
[12:04] Sunday the human mind has become
[12:06] overloaded today by the things that
[12:08] Jesus said and he talks about
[12:10] overcharged with surfeiting with things
[12:13] that are uh uh given to us in this age
[12:16] to make us overburdened overloaded in
[12:19] our minds and if if you believe his
[12:22] prophecy about earthquakes Jesus spoke
[12:24] in Luke 21 in Matthew he gave prophecies
[12:28] earthquakes and diverse places all these
[12:30] fires taking place as we mentioned all
[12:32] of these we've been studying this and
[12:34] look at it for years every Christian
[12:35] knows that Jesus prophesied of
[12:38] everything that's happening right now
[12:40] but I wanted to say if you believe what
[12:42] Jesus said about earthquakes and famine
[12:45] and pestilences then we have to believe
[12:48] what he said about this time of trouble
[12:50] of worsening the effect on our hearts
[12:52] and Minds being manipulated and
[12:56] depressed and overwhelmed if you're
[12:58] going to say oh believe Jesus said
[13:00] earthquakes will come but you better
[13:01] believe even more so the the the
[13:04] challenge and the attack on our
[13:07] minds because it's just as much a part
[13:09] of the prophecy that's right the attack
[13:12] on Believers minds and Minds being
[13:14] manipulated I want to use that word
[13:16] because we're in the day of many things
[13:19] that it's not just influences you got
[13:21] around the wrong influence and it made
[13:23] you think that it impressed your mind
[13:25] today it's an intentional manipulation
[13:28] of the Mind especially children and
[13:30] young people and you have to stand
[13:32] flat-footed and know that as a believer
[13:34] that there's an agenda there's an effort
[13:36] of Satan to manipulate how I think to
[13:40] manipulate and try to kill my faith when
[13:42] I have faith in God he wants to kill
[13:44] that he wants to make us doubt that and
[13:47] so our minds we must stand and say I
[13:49] will not let my mind be manipulated I
[13:52] will not let my thinking be formed by
[13:55] the wisdom of this world that's how Str
[13:57] that's how bold we got to be about it I
[13:59] will not let my mind become depressed I
[14:02] will not let Satan depress my spirit and
[14:05] my emotions over something that's
[14:09] stupid can you say amen I will guard
[14:12] over it I will not allow my mind to be
[14:14] overwhelmed and uh we're not really
[14:16] meant to handle our minds the way God
[14:19] built them is not really meant to handle
[14:22] this time without God and without his
[14:25] power these Minds were not created to
[14:28] handle the type to age that we're in
[14:30] that's true and that's why he said I
[14:33] will send my spirit and provide for you
[14:36] power that you don't
[14:39] have that's right maybe in a simpler era
[14:43] we could have handled it better but your
[14:45] minds cannot handle it on its own in
[14:48] this era and God said I need to provide
[14:50] you with
[14:51] something he said if we make our request
[14:54] known to him he said the peace of God
[14:57] will flow to us and protect our hearts
[15:00] and Minds so we're not even meant to
[15:01] handle this time Satan knows that and he
[15:04] knows that the times and the and the
[15:06] overburden of our minds and hearts will
[15:08] make us edgy will make us angry will
[15:11] make us
[15:12] fearful we make us feel empty even the
[15:16] entertainments of this world will make
[15:17] us leaving leaving us feeling empty he
[15:20] knows it makes you seek Satan knows that
[15:24] it'll make you seek in these times of
[15:26] pressure a pacifier like a baby does a
[15:29] pacifier or a relief into some
[15:36] entertainment into some
[15:39] Escape other things that we need to do
[15:41] to
[15:42] relax and uh we must be careful of these
[15:45] things in the times we live in because
[15:48] they have a way of not just we think
[15:50] it's relaxing our mind but some things
[15:52] are not relaxing they're manipulating
[15:55] and they're controlling and it doesn't
[15:57] really relax us it makes us feel empty
[15:59] at the end that's right see yeah he
[16:01] knows all this and so we we we cry for
[16:05] Simplicity and peace in our minds and in
[16:07] our spirits and all he does is try to
[16:10] make life more complicated he puts
[16:13] things in our mind that are complicated
[16:15] that are filthy things lustful things
[16:18] and for us to feed on that and and I
[16:20] want to bring answers to it I don't want
[16:21] to just preach the diagnose the problems
[16:24] of this age I want to bring answers that
[16:26] it's not just talking about the problem
[16:28] that we have when I preach it most of
[16:30] you can nod and sayen yeah we definitely
[16:32] live during these times I think I'm all
[16:34] about answers too what answers does God
[16:37] give us to counter and overcome this
[16:40] Spirit of this
[16:41] age I want to bring answers not just the
[16:44] problem but you must not see this as a
[16:47] little problem you must see it as your
[16:49] mind and you must not think that your
[16:52] mind is exempt from being affected by
[16:55] these things right unless you protect it
[16:59] well I'm a Believer so I'm exempt from
[17:00] it only if you trust in the Holy
[17:03] Ghost you're your mind by itself is not
[17:06] exempt from the manipulation of the age
[17:09] and God wants to give answers to protect
[17:11] it to invite his peace that's what he
[17:13] wants so one thing I missed last Sunday
[17:16] is to talk uh specifically about a
[17:18] little bit of the science and we'll get
[17:20] that out of the way first because it can
[17:22] tend to get boring but it's not boring
[17:24] in the sense if you're looking at it
[17:26] what the world's saying now so I'm
[17:27] bringing it right up to last year the
[17:29] end of the year Oxford University press
[17:32] has chosen brain rot brain rot as its
[17:36] word of the Year
[17:39] 2024 a new word and it's the word of the
[17:41] year can you imagine this now we think
[17:44] we've Advanced we think that we've
[17:46] really went a long ways we think we're
[17:48] getting better and better and these guys
[17:51] at the University look it all over and
[17:53] they say we got a new word and it's the
[17:55] word of
[17:56] 2024 brain rot
[18:00] boy we've really ADV Advanced if our
[18:02] brains are
[18:05] rotting I got a word for the devil for
[18:08] last
[18:09] year brain renewal amen hallelujah can
[18:14] you say amen for the bride it's time for
[18:16] a brain renewal it's time to be renewed
[18:20] by the spirit in our minds by the power
[18:23] of
[18:25] transformation oh I wish I could tell
[18:27] some of it at at the Oxford University
[18:29] there's a power in the word there's a
[18:31] power that God's provided I'd like them
[18:33] to read in the scripture to say that you
[18:35] can don't have to be conformed to this
[18:38] world and let your brain rot that you
[18:40] can be transformed by the renewing of
[18:43] your mind by the word of God and by the
[18:45] power of God so if it wasn't last year
[18:49] I'm making it this year our word for the
[18:51] year for this church is not brain rot
[18:53] but brain and thinking Renewal by the
[18:56] word of God hallelujah
[19:00] amen but they say that the year word is
[19:03] brain rot the word is defined as a
[19:05] supposed deterioration of a person's
[19:08] mental or intellectual State especially
[19:10] viewed as a result of overc consumption
[19:14] of material now that's just what Jesus
[19:17] said an overc consumption don't be
[19:21] overcharged by the over consumption the
[19:23] OV excess that it overl the worries of
[19:26] Life override and so there's saying
[19:29] we'll come up with brain rot because the
[19:31] the slow deterioration of the brain and
[19:33] the thinking of a person's mental or
[19:36] intellectual State especially viewed as
[19:38] a result of the overc consumption of
[19:40] material now particularly online content
[19:43] so there's all different materials we've
[19:45] had for the last 60 70 80 years that
[19:48] have been Satan's agenda to get the
[19:50] wrong things in our mind but the online
[19:53] changed
[19:54] everything now it took it it Advanced it
[19:57] so particularly on online they say
[19:59] considered online content considered to
[20:01] be uh trivial and unchallenging also
[20:05] something characterized as likely to
[20:07] lead to such deterioration some experts
[20:10] believe that constant endless scrolling
[20:13] of social media boy I'm going to make
[20:16] some enemies now some experts believe
[20:18] that constant endless scrolling of
[20:19] social media and other online content is
[20:22] doing exactly that rotting our brains
[20:26] Behavior change expert Dr Kyra bobinet
[20:29] author of Unstoppable brain told Fox
[20:31] News digital that there's a growing
[20:33] awareness of brain rot and its
[20:35] consequences it's in the uh the the zeit
[20:38] kites that people have difficulty with
[20:41] their attention span zeit kites is this
[20:43] era this uh this time span what era
[20:46] we're in right now and that era of time
[20:48] means it's difficult with people to keep
[20:51] their attention span that's why I got to
[20:53] keep my sermon to about an hour today
[20:55] they feel brain so it's difficulty with
[20:58] the the attention span they feel brain
[21:00] foggy they have less concentration they
[21:03] can't do deep
[21:05] work said California based bobinet and
[21:08] there then there's also this epidemic of
[21:10] loneliness that has been kind of a
[21:12] sitting on the heels of all this because
[21:15] we can't really focus on anything
[21:17] including relationship building a
[21:20] certain part of the brain called the uh
[21:23] Hab
[21:25] habenula everybody knows how to say that
[21:27] but me Haba is a part of the brain is
[21:31] responsible for getting stuck in Endless
[21:34] scrolling according to bobinette the
[21:37] habula is a central part of the brain
[21:39] that's involved in various important
[21:42] functions including motivation and
[21:44] decisionmaking but when activated this
[21:46] area can also kill our motivation to try
[21:50] she noted it's the heart of when you
[21:51] know you should be doing something and
[21:53] you do this other thing instead like
[21:56] Doom scrolling I didn't know the word
[21:58] Zoom scrolling it means too much time
[22:01] reading negative news or social media
[22:04] content but somehow it dismantles this
[22:08] part and actually puts up a guard to you
[22:11] thinking and wanting to do other things
[22:13] you're supposed to be doing and shuts it
[22:16] down until you he she said scrolling on
[22:20] social media is also a way to
[22:21] disassociate and give the brain a rest
[22:24] after a long day bobinette said this is
[22:26] an avoidance behavior which the have bua
[22:30] controls this is part the part that can
[22:32] make decision this is the part of your
[22:34] brain that can make a decision to say no
[22:36] but it gets numbed so in other words the
[22:38] thing that's coming in that you're
[22:40] supposed to say no
[22:42] to it dismantles that dismantles the
[22:47] clear thinking that you should have
[22:50] that's bad because a lot of stuff can
[22:52] get in that you're numb to that
[22:54] shouldn't be getting in and I'm going to
[22:56] talk about some of those things today
[22:58] amen
[22:59] this is the part that can make the
[23:01] decision say no but it gets numbed it
[23:03] gets drunk so to speak not a clear
[23:05] thinking to make a clear decision just
[23:07] I'm almost done with this excessive
[23:09] social media use may have the same
[23:11] effects as the same effects as substance
[23:14] abuse say experts anytime you're
[23:16] avoiding something you know this is the
[23:17] area of the brain is on this area of the
[23:19] brain is on she said this is how social
[23:22] media addictions can form bobinet warned
[23:24] as this part of the brain can make it
[23:26] very painful to stop scrolling
[23:29] this can result in a dangerous loss of
[23:31] motivation and that they have warned the
[23:34] scientists have warned we all need
[23:36] motivation to live our lives and to feel
[23:38] proud of ourselves and to feel confident
[23:41] and to get what we want we need that and
[23:44] she told she told Fox News but then
[23:46] later she says as an answer and I'm
[23:49] always critical of all their answers
[23:52] they can diagnose the case but I got a
[23:54] better source to go for answers for this
[23:57] can you say amen amen
[23:59] but she says has a little bit of truth
[24:01] to it she says humans are very resilient
[24:04] she added once we know the truth about
[24:07] our bodies then we can do something
[24:09] about it
[24:11] Satan has studied the human
[24:14] being and their brain and how they think
[24:18] and what they do and why and be Satan
[24:21] the great
[24:22] psychologists has studied human beings
[24:25] they know how they tick
[24:28] 6,000 years is a long career right
[24:33] that's right come on now 6,000 years is
[24:37] a pretty long career to figure out how
[24:40] to tempt human beings and how to destroy
[24:43] them and how to bring brain rot and how
[24:46] to do it all he's got a pretty good
[24:49] track record and so now he's worked at
[24:51] this and then let me say this more
[24:54] personal to you he has studied you since
[24:57] you've been born
[25:00] I said to the young people the other
[25:01] night is that a boxer watches videos a
[25:04] football team watches videos of the
[25:05] opponent they're watching how they Works
[25:07] work watching their plays okay and so
[25:10] Satan studies you C you're War because
[25:12] not only that you have human being uh uh
[25:15] uh similarities but you yourself have
[25:18] certain BS and certain weaknesses and
[25:20] certain ways about you that is only
[25:23] about
[25:24] you and I only want to say if Satan
[25:27] studies that how to get you and how to
[25:29] tempt you from the day you were born
[25:32] then why can't you do a little bit more
[25:35] study on
[25:37] [Applause]
[25:39] yourself it's not good if Satan knows
[25:41] you better than you know
[25:44] yourself it's not good if Satan knows
[25:47] how the mind works better than us human
[25:49] beings oh I don't need to study that I
[25:52] got the Holy Ghost and that's all I need
[25:54] no no I think there's scriptures in the
[25:56] Bible that talked about guarding our
[25:58] heart guarding our mind putting things
[26:01] that are right in our
[26:03] minds I don't think it's just about
[26:05] getting the power of the Holy Ghost I
[26:07] think it's we grow in grace of God to
[26:09] learn who we are to learn who our enemy
[26:12] is how he gets in and stand and put a
[26:15] stop we ought to know how to possess our
[26:19] own vessel in sanctification and
[26:23] Truth Paul said that 2,000 years ago so
[26:26] well I'm a Believer I believe this
[26:27] message with all my heart but you ought
[26:29] to know how to possess your own vessel
[26:31] that's right in sanctification and in
[26:34] truth and if you're not going to learn
[26:36] that then the devil's going to be
[26:38] knocking you down all the time oh yeah
[26:41] right thank you that every one of you
[26:43] should know how to possess his vessel in
[26:46] sanctification and honor can you say
[26:48] amen amen and and then Paul uh said in
[26:52] another place that we are not ignorant
[26:55] of Satan's devices that's right so
[26:57] what's he saying saying there is that we
[26:59] study our enemy and we study ourselves
[27:02] how he gets in that we grow and mature
[27:04] in being a Powerhouse for the Lord
[27:06] saying he can't get in very easy because
[27:09] I studied how he gets in and I've
[27:12] studied myself I know how the brain
[27:14] works I know how my heart works I know
[27:17] what I can handle and what I can't
[27:19] handle and I know that better than my
[27:22] enemy I also know how to deal with the
[27:25] Enemy through the power of the name of
[27:27] Jes Jesus Christ I've got a power over
[27:30] the enemy that I can kick Devils out
[27:33] said come and hide with me and tell the
[27:35] devil you can have a lot of things but
[27:37] you can't have my mind you can't have my
[27:40] spirit my mind is not a garbage can and
[27:43] you I can't change the world I can't
[27:45] change what they put on my phone I can't
[27:47] change Hollywood I can't change what
[27:49] they're producing and I can't change the
[27:52] spirit that's in this world I can't
[27:53] change that if I could I would but there
[27:57] are things devil that I do have a
[27:58] control over and I can allow my mind to
[28:01] be changed and renewed by the word of
[28:04] God my mind my heart my soul can be
