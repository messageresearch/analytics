their hearts we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated tonight and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so praise the Lord God wants to bless families um I'm already thinking of the end of uh the sermon marriage and divorce where brother brandom which is by the way is more than a sermon it's a revelation uh as he brought the revelation of marriage and divorce and brought those things and he gets to the end and of course the lord gave the word to a prophet the same as God gave Moses a writing of divorcement for their day to deal with the problems that they had and then brother bradam was given a word for this age that they should go and not do it again but to not to try to bring families uh marriages and go back to their original marriages but to stay as you are but to never do it again and he's in that announcement from God that they just go and sin no more and uh be forgiven of what they've done I really believe it was a pronouncement through the prophet from God for the age and for the time and then as brother Brown prays at the end I've mentioned it to you before one of his statements he makes in the prayer is that and God make these families happy make these families blessed that's CU because that's the end result of God if he brings his word and brings his principle he's wanting to bless us and he's wanting to bless as the scripture say says here God wants to bless families and so right at the very beginning of the true Faith seed in Abraham God mentions a blessing to the families right away and this may turn out to be a little serious in the family it's been a long time since we talked about it and uh it's I think it's been quite a few years so this may turn into a series but I was wondering what makes a family blessed what makes a family blessed and we might as well take the other side what makes a family uh come under a curse because many families come under a curse and so this is not what God's talking about here he's talking about the families of the Earth being blessed but if you have families that are blessed then you certainly have families that come under a curse of some kind and it might behoove us to research the scripture and to look and pray and to say what is the difference in being a family that's blessed and a family that's cursed what's the characteristics of a family that is truly blessed and we've often said to you it's not just a family that would have uh we thinking blessing a few months ago we were talking about prosperity and in the world we live in we often when we hear the word blessing we often think of uh monetary Prosperity or money and we have plenty of funds but we can't use that as a criteria of being blessed only that because there's a lot of families with uh lots more money than what we have I guarantee you and uh they're not blessed of God they're actually a curse on that F but they have plenty of money so we can't make that our goal is that that's the definition of being blessed can you say amen that's that's not necessarily it so what is God's definition of blessing and whatever God's saying here as far as families being blessed we certainly want to have that and be underneath that and then maybe look at what brings families under curses sometimes and I don't know how much this will open up but we definitely see a time that we live in where Satan is uh attacking every component of a normal family um and and if we look at that we have to see what curses and blessings are the scripture speaks quite a bit about curses and blessings the scripture speaks about being under a curse and being under the blessing and also that God can actually lift a curse take someone that's under a curse their entire lives even and God can bless them and lift that curse from their life and they're not under that curse I guess the greatest example is that we're all born under a curse of a serpent nature and through the blood of Jesus Christ the power of God strikes that soul and we're lifted from the curse of the serpent nature and become blessed of God so blessing and cursing is in the scripture and the curse of course there's a lot of meanings to that someone could uh swear at you and curse at you but uh curse means could mean also a magical thing that's placed over somebody like some type of pronouncement as somebody places a curse on somebody's life but really the meaning deeper than that is that when you have a curse it's a cause of trouble or bad luck in other words Trouble Comes there's trouble that comes on someone that's cursed or some family that's cursed and so we realize that Satan God wants wants to bless families but Satan wants to destroy families and Satan loves to bring people under curses Satan loves to bring even Christians under a curse sometimes where they're hit just hitting trouble all the time and I don't mean I don't mean just normal troubles we're going to have troubles in this life I'm talking about being under a curse of something that you can't lift it it's actually a a demonic thing that hold you down and Satan has certainly brought curses on the family and he's attacked every component of a normal family in this hour through Hollywood and through his different means and through the early years he begin to dismantle things and he doesn't start at just the marriage he starts at the single people before they're married that's how he destroys the family is he wants to start with the young people so now we have a youth-driven generation that Satan influences and uh upon them to put images in their mind and cause single people to be destroyed in their minds and destroyed in their bodies even before they get to a wedding day and and that's Satan's work to bring a curse on the family right he can curse a family 10 years from now that not even married or have children yet by working through that single single young person and and plaguing their minds and getting their minds on all kinds of trash of the world filling with all kinds of images and ideas and all these other things and by that he's destroying a huge component oent of the family he's bringing a curse on the future family by doing that cuz that's what he wants to do so he he he takes it from the angle of the single people and and uh trying to get our guys and our girls influenced in so many ways and trying to get them to lose their virginity whether emotionally or physically before marriage TR and if he doesn't do that to mess with their minds and so that they're not they don't look at things normally they don't look at uh relationship normally they don't look at sexual experience normally it's all twisted it's all become worldly that's how Satan destroys the normal family that's how he brings a curse on then he works on marriages then he attacks marriages and whatever is normal he brings abnormal then he attacks the children by attacking the children he destroys the component of the family can you say am man he's destroying the family by working on the children then he destroys the image of what a woman is right and by that in turn destroys the family yeah then he destroys the image of what a real man is which I really believe that's a place he really starts too because when the men are destroyed in their image of what normal is it has a trickle down effect that's why we have Abraham here who becomes such a powerful force to all the families in the earth one man with the faith he had can have the influence of all the families in the earth that's a pretty strong influence amen one man in his position position right with faith acting upon God can influence entire families and thus influence entire chur entire churches because if you influence the family you influence the church right so uh we're going to get into that because that's a powerful powerful force but when he when he destroys normality in men and what a normal man is when he destroys what a normal woman is he's destroying the family that's what he's trying to destroy but when he destroys the marriages and tries to attack the marriages he's destroying the family God's structure God's hope and God's uh goal to have a blessed blessed families it says it right here that all the families the effect of the faith of Abraham God says not that your business would be blessed not not that your money would be blessed money's not mentioned there business isn't mentioned there and we spoke on it before I believe God wants to bless those things too but money in business is not me there the trickle down effect of a man of faith is to bless families to bless families not your business but bless your family and that's that's what God considers we're going to get into a minute God just loves it God loves to bless families and see healthy normal Spirit-filled families that are functioning in Union and Oneness together he loves it he loves for his body his people in his church to function in unity and thus he that that's the family of God and thus the families that are going home and living with one another every day he loves for them to be in unity Satan's work is to try to break that up and to divide amen so now he destroys all the normal components and he changes all the normal things mostly through Hollywood he changes the normal components of a family and he dismantles the normal family and Satan's final display I I believe in his world is uh is is flaunted to this world in a new show called Modern Family that ex that's out there today that shows the most Twisted full of full of homosexuality full of sexual perversion full of disobedient children full of constant disrespect between the husband and wife between the children and parents and a homosexual couple and all this all these three different families in a TV show called Modern Family that's Satan's final uh Capstone as it was in this age to express this is what Norm normal is and it's he's flaunting himself at destroying the normal family he's flaunting it yeah because none of that is anywhere near what a normal family should be it's a completely perverted view of it can you say Amen exactly right but here we have if as we look at this there is a source even in Genesis 12 that if it were here that families could become blessed we could say so much more about the curse on families and maybe we'll get to that more in another service but uh be it known be it known that we're in an hour where at every moment Satan is trying to attack your family and God is wanting to bless your family God is wanting to bless your marriage God is wanting to bless your family God is wanting to bless your relationships because it's all about relationship yeah with God it's all about relationship amen so now we see in Genesis 12 then that here what Abraham has done what God did in Abraham has a trickle down effect on the family and it's so powerful that it can affect all the families in the earth in other words if they were to come into this faith that Abraham had it becomes the source that all the families on the earth can be blessed this faith Abraham and I want to just say it's not just his faith but his it's his action to his faith it's his life with his faith it's it's h as we were mentioning on Sunday it's not just what we live well I'll just live it in front of them that speaks worlds that's a great thing but sometimes it's our actions also it's it's our words as well can you say amen and and and with Abraham it's his actions it's it's not we know that he had Faith but how do we know it James says we know he had Faith by his works by his actions that's the only way we knew he had faith and so if you go into Abraham's life he's not a perfect man by any means but nevertheless there's enough actions of Faith there that Express such an example to the rest of the Believers throughout the ages and not only is it an example but the power of it can trickle down and affect families to be blessed praise the Lord so God wanted to bless this blessing to pass on to the families doesn't mention your job doesn't mention the business why why is it that way because really in the mystery of God friends this is what God was trying to do if we go back to the beginning God himself would fulfill his loneliness by creating a family of his own the whole principle of the mystery of God is based upon God feeling lonely and God creating a family for himself God the lonely God wanted a family Angels weren't close to him Angels worshiped him that wasn't family that wasn't kin to him can you say am man that was something that worshiping that's a different type of relationship he wanted a family he wanted a bond he was lonely and wanted something of his own kind that's why in Genesis 1:2 you hear that of Their Own Kind let them produce of their own kind as God's saying that about all the fishes of the sea and all the foul of the air he's bringing out a revelation that I I I want I want something in my own kind I'm lonely here I want a fellowship God wanted a family it's in the mystery of God and he would fill his loneliness with a family that was God's answer to his loneliness now if you're lonely we live in an age that there's a lot of different things to fulfill your loneliness but is anybody interested here tonight in going the way God filled his loneliness God fulfilled his loneliness with his family that he created he didn't run to something else God's not running over the corner playing video games God's not running here and just and and and neglecting everything else and God's not getting fulfillment out in the the trees that he created he saw that that was good but as he kept coming along every day in creation it's good it's good it's good but all through those five days he is still lonely right and on the sixth day when he created this masterpiece this man he said this is good this was actually real good to God because now he's seen the potential of male and female being there the potential to bring a family that he could fellowship with that's why he got so excited about it that's why he come to his his uh uh climax his great achievement through creating man because that's the thing that would bring forth this Fellowship can you say Amen the same and just make a note of that the same loneliness in God is the sometimes the same loneliness in man and Fallen man will reach for something else to be fulfilled or to be at peace and that's often the breakup of a family sure first of all man doesn't turn to God for his Fellowship right man does not let God answer his loneliness might I just stay on that just a minute every human being experiences that and even Believers experience it and you have to learn that we have to reach out and run to our god in our loneliness God wants to fellowship with us God is often saying my child I want to fellowship with you I want to talk with you and how often we turn to other things to fill that void of loneliness so you're going to see the trickle down breakup effect of a family if you have a man who in his loneliness begins to turn to other things other than God and other than his family because God turned to his family God's answer to his loneliness was his family yes can somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord and if that's what's God an is that if that how that's how God answered his cry in his heart then that should be our cry as well praise the Lord and so now we see then that uh in the mystery of God he would fulfill that even a man when he's fallen he will reach for something to fulfill at peace but it'll reach to something else even to the place sometimes a man will will walk away from his family and neglect his family he's a lonely man but he'll walk away from his family and neglect his family because he's so bent on thinking that his loneliness will be fulfilled through something else uh so many examples not here but out that we're my wife and I are praying about in certain marriages and different things that's taking place and I'll tell you uh it's when a man steps out of his position and his place and begins to walk into Worlds by self he begins to neglect his family he begins to walk away from his family the very thing God gave him is fountains to drink from to fill his loneliness and the Very God that is meant to fill that loneliness he starts to walk away from it he starts to fill it through something else and then is the breakup of the family then you have people still living together but there's no Oneness because the heart has turned to something else other than his wife for his loneliness yeah he's turned to pornography or he's turned to something of the world and men can do it but women can do it too and we have so many different attractions in this day friends we have so many choices laid out before the for before us in our loneliness it's like we got a book here and we've got this here and we got so many attractions here and I'm not even saying all of them are sinful things I'm just saying we have to be really careful what we fill our loneliness with when God is craving to talk to us sometimes we'll go for weeks and not fellowship with him and God is saying I want to talk with you I want to fellowship with you that's what I created you for yes but we're we're taught in this generation to use all of our different sources to make us feel peaceful let me let me just show take it a step further read back in Genesis 1 here Genesis 2 so he created on the Sixth Day verse 26 chapter 1 verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them H here it is be fruitful and multiply God setting up the whole thing so it's a creation of a family he's got the potential laying there of a family that's why he's so excited about this be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea the foul of the air over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in which the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me and to every beast and then verse 31 he says and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good there there is a very good and behold it was not just good it was very good praise God because he wasn't got any fellowship with a tree right there was no fellowship with a foul of the air can you say am man his loneliness could not be fulfilled through some foul of the air right this this is Val good this is very good because this has the potential to create more family to fellowship with that's what God gave joy in God's heart praise the Lord and so now then he creates the things but in man it was his crowning achievement to make male there was a man and male and female was in that man both male and female was in that man how many know that and not only was that marriage that male and female there and that because the male and female part was there then he could say multiply and replenish and so potential there laid there for a family because of this Grand achievement I I remember a brother used to call it his crowning achievement was man with male and female in him that was God's Masterpiece God's crowning achievement was here he is a man and he is supposed to have dominion over the he's a minor God on the earth he will do all these things but what was the main purpose of it to fulfill God's loneliness I have a counterpart all the other uh animals had a counterpart but but uh God didn't have a counterpart now he did and when he created Adam he really didn't have a counterpart and that's why when he created man after the end of it he created it and then when he when he formed man in Genesis 2 from the dust of the Earth can you say am man then he says these words and I want you to read it because maybe it's it's been a while maybe you haven't read it before uh let's just pick it up here verse 7 chapter two and the Lord formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed life into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord planted a garden Eastern and Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and um Verse 18 and the Lord said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him he's addressing the loneliness again so every other thing in the Kingdom had a counterpart but Adam didn't and God said that wasn't good cuz God could relate to him not having a counterpart to fellowship with so uh and out of the ground he formed every beast of the field out of the foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and so it goes on and on but I want you to notice something here now here he put the he he put the seed in everything to reproduce he put the seed to reproduce and now I have the potential now with male and female to reproduce and bring a family and you know that's what God hates about a hybrid seed how many know what a hybrid seed is they they mechanically inject something in it to make the fruit of it come a lot more um abundant sometimes that's what science does they hybrid the seed so you might have more of a crop you might have it bigger more beautiful but there's one problem with the hybrid SE it can't reproduce itself that's why God hates a hybrid seed because his purpose was to reproduce his purpose was that was bring it would bring forth more of his family Sons and Daughters of God so he could fellowship with them and so a seed that's hybd won't produce it reproduce itself that's why we should begin to pray and be concerned because a church that can't reproduce it self with baptisms and souls coming to the Lord is becoming dead that is a great concern to a Believer because a hybrid seed can't reproduce itself but when there's a true pure seed there it will reproduce and bring forth more not many numbers but it will bring forth more and more and more and so God hates a hybrid seed and it because it can't re reproduce itself and when God then when God labored did you notice now down chapter 2 it says thus the chapter 2 verse one thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it so God came into his rest after when he had labored for all those days then he rested after the potential for a family was there that's when God rested because why he knew that's where his Fellowship would come from he could enter into a Sabbath now he could enter into a rest now because he didn't need to create anymore he come to his final achievement he come to his final thing I did all that leading up to Bringing so I could have my family so I can fellowship and once God has a blessed family on Earth that he can fellowship with he's reached his Sabbath he's reached his rest he's reached his peace there isn't anything further that I need to create and if we could learn that that God came to his real peace and rest after he had Union and fellowship with his son and daughter there was no more why are we itching for more maybe there's something more that's why a man walks out and walks away from family and walks away from the devil's got him itching for more looking for more a Wonder lust right maybe there's a new model maybe I should get another wife maybe I should do this and he's come under the influence of the power of Satan when he does that not under the power of God because under the power of God a man enters into his rest with his family God did that God came to a Sabbath praise God I'm in fellowship with my family and when a man is restless and walks away from that he's under the power of Satan right not God yes so so he enters into this rest he did not enter into the Sabbath until the fellowship of his own kind came in Hebrew says there's a rest for the people of God did you know that Hebrews the book of Hebrews says there remaineth a rest we have a Sabbath as well that Sabbath is the Holy Ghost and you know what that means that means many times Christians labor for years and their labor trying to do Works trying to work it up trying to please God trying to do all this trying to do it for it and then but that's not the Holy Ghost when you really bring that final entrance into the Holy Ghost it is your Sabbath because you realize this isn't about works this is about fellowship with my father this is a family my father has come into relationship with me I've come into Union through the Holy Ghost and so I don't need to labor to try to do something for God or gain my salvation it's a peace it's a Sabbath yay there remaineth a rest for the people of God he said enter into your rest enter into your fellowship realize that your walk with the Lord just talked to someone here last Sunday afternoon after church and and just just being taught in wrong types of churches being taught hanging over hell that if I do this little thing am I going to go to hell am I going to go to hell a complete false concept of God can you say Amen but oh when you begin to learn what God's kingdom really is then you enter into AR rest that this isn't a labor to try to somehow work out your work your salvation through and become gain your way through merits or bonus points into heaven can you say Amen you enter a rest in the Holy Ghost that what is this Christian Life all about it's about fellowship with the father and it's about fellowship with the other Sons and Daughters of God because you're my did you notice all these names and titles it's not president and all these other things it's brothers sisters father son that's the terms in the Bible why because it's a family father son Brothers sisters family family not Bishops and presidents and positions and trustees and deacons that's all you know we got to do that for the books but what this really is is a family amen can you say amen and so just like you long to fellowship with the father you long to Fellowship in worship with the brothers and sisters it's a natural thing for a Believer to want to be in Fellowship ship with his brothers and sisters if they don't desire that anymore and they can't come to church to do that something is wrong in their relationship Case Closed something is desperately wrong because the normal natural thing that's why brother Bram says a Believer can't wait to get to the house of God when the doors are open he has to get there what's that come from some Duty or something absolutely not it's from this craving to be Associated and to be in communion and fellowship with the family of God and my father that doesn't mean you can't fellowship with the father outside of the church but being in the house of God where the word is being preached I think it's a very important thing to be there not because of Duty but and and Duty would be fine but it has to be something deeper it comes natural people want to be in fellowship with one another and with their father in this way can you say Amen praise the Lord so he entered into a Sabbath we enter into a Sabbath with fellowship with the father and his sons and that's why it's normal to want to worship and be with the body of Christ if you don't desire that anymore something's happening in your life something's gripped you that's not normal right some some other things gripped you and that's not to condemn anybody here or anybody who's not here at church tonight if you're listening on the uh uh streaming I'm not here to condemn anybody I'm just saying you have to go to prayer and say if you've lost that natural thirst to say I want to be there where the word Springs being preached I want to be in Fellowship I want to worship with the Saints I want to partake of the Lord's supper with the Saints I want to do it because they are my family if you've lost that you've lost the normality of what a family of God is and something else has gripped you something else has gripped you because that's what's normal so now he God wanted to bless his family in God's heart that is everything Faith will do many things now let's get to Abraham now I never knew this was going to take so long I was going to be short tonight when I get on something that I really like it's just hard to get off of it so now God wanted to bless his family in God's heart uh it was everything to him to fellowship with his family now faith will do many things faith can do many things but look at this scripture is that the faith of Abraham brought back in Genesis 12 the faith of Abra Abraham shall have a trickle down effect and cause the families of the earth to be blessed now Faith can do many things faith will do many things but when it blesses the family I believe it reaches its crowning achievement that's where it shows up the best is when it blesses the Family Faith can do a lot of things faith can raise the Dead faith can open up blinded eyes I've seen it happen I've seen a blind man I was seven eight years old I've seen a blind man he was prayed for in Lima there and his eyes were open and he shouted around the church for the next two hours on his own ran around the church so I knew he was completely blind his eyes were open that was a good thing for me to see because I could you could you could say what the what he did in the Bible he does today he's still real faith can do many things Faith nothing is impossible with faith can you say Amen but you see now when Faith blesses a family in true blessing I believe it's reached its crowning achievement to see Christ expressed through that family in because how is it expressed it's expressed in Oneness they come into Oneness with one another any normal family the husband is one with the wife the children are one with the parents they come into Oneness what is that Oneness a reflection of the Oneness between God's people and God that's the expression of the mystery of God that Christ could have preeminence in a people when that's expressed every day in coming across in the in the in the richness of a family or the blessing of the family it's re faith has reached his crowning achievement in creation it's this image of male and female that had the potential for a family being in Oneness that's what that's what God was God's crowning achievement was it it moved the heart of God this is very good he said when all creation has a counterpart but Adam God said it's not good uh uh notice now he says Adam's alone it's not good Adam is there he ha he can create worlds if he wants to he names the animals he can move mountains if he wants to notice that and God still says it's not good come on now are you catching what I'm saying because of his loneliness God is there with his son and he's named the animals and he can move mountains and he has all power and all Faith as a son of God to do all things and God says it's still not good because he's lonely because he don't have his counterpart it's amazing isn't it God's lifting up that importance of fellowship and Oneness more important than Faith to move mountains my think about it think about it it's amazing he could do anything but it still was not good so let's talk about the faith of Abraham before we bring it to a close here tonight this kind of faith in a man just a simple common man but God gives this man a promise he believes that promise God gives him a revelation of that promise and then the actions he took with that Faith begin to bring the results he had an action with his faith and God spoke the promise it dropped an Abraham's heart he acted on the promise he positioned himself toward words the promise and by the way he acted and by the way he positioned himself and the faith that he had this kind of Faith would look at it make thee a great nation bless thee I'll bless them that bless the and curse them that curse of thee and it'll it'll affect all the families of the earth to be blessed amazing this kind of Faith this kind of man with this kind of Faith this kind of action to his faith never seen this before never seen it quite this way before this kind of Faith with this kind of action where he didn't even know where he was going he just begin to act in obedience to God God gave him a promise God spoke get thee out he began to move on that promise can you say amen and when he begin to move on that then this is the thing that brought such a powerful effect upon the Earth he was elected he was called then he obeyed because there was certainly specific things that came with the promise here he receives a a word of the Lord to go out he's going to be become I'll make you a great nation I Will Bless thee later on he articulates more what God is going to give him uh as a child make him a father many nations but he has given a promise but I want to say something to you there were specific things that went with the promise specific things Abraham had to do that went with the promise now you can stand there all day long and say I believe the promise I believe the promise God said it I believe it I believe the promise but the difference in Abraham is he had actions in obedience that went with the promise right amen and the very first one was is in verse one when God said get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House well it seems kind of strange because we're talking about families here tonight and God says but that family you're going to have to get the out and really what God is saying is that you can't stay there around that atmosphere and become what I want you to become you're going to have to pull away from that there is a separation always in God from the world from Associates of the world from influences of the world and from influences of unbelief Abraham you can't stay there and Abraham quickly acted upon that all right we're get we're getting up we're going huh get your stuff together we're we're packing up we're getting out of here where you going I don't really know but I have a promise of God God said this is the first thing he said to do I've got to separate my myself look at The Obedience I'll do it I don't have all the details I don't understand it all but something's dropped in my heart I've heard from God yes I'm going to act upon this in obedience I'm going out now friends we need more men of obedience to act upon the promise good we need more men like that we need more faithful men like that Abraham was not a perfect man and we'll find that right even in the next chapter remember all of his mistakes were completely blatantly all there in the Old Testament but they weren't in the new God washed them away in the New Testament and I've thought I've often said why why did that happen why does God take all of those mistakes that were there and now they're washed away in the New Testament because that's how God's covenant works when he has a covenant with the people of God and the Covenant is stronger than your mistakes can you say amen God's covenant with you is stronger than your mistakes God's covenant with Abraham his promise with Abraham was stronger than any of his mistakes and so even though he was an a perfect man and that's not what we're trying to present tonight is that if you're a perfect man you're going to have a bless family no if you're a man of faith that acts upon the promise can you say amen that's when families will be blessed not that you're a perfect man but you're a man of faith in the promise of the hour and you act upon on that promise of the hour that's what blesses family that's the kind of men we need we need more men like that I could preach on women all day long there's a lot to say about women I could preach on the children I could preach but you know what we need more than anything else more men of faith that believe the promise of the hour and their families know what they believe they know where they stand and they act upon what that promise says to do we need more men like thatall and we're seeing more destruction of fam sometimes because we don't have that pivotal that that strong point look at the power here Abraham himself when he's positioned right in his place can affect all the families of the earth so brother you a husband and father of your family you have a powerful effect upon your family how you position yourself in your response to the word and the promise of this day and what God says to do and your obedience to it has a huge trickle down effect to your kids no matter how young they are to your wife thank you praise the Lord so the life the actions the obedience to God in Abraham's life he never wavered on anything the Bible says in the New Testament he staggered not at the promise of God it was the promise of the hour he believed he set the example for all the ages he set the example when we have men of Faith like that we will have more blessed families brother Bram said and when he was a promised son and when he was promised a son and he waited uh 25 years to receive that son calling anything contrary to it as though it wasn't so and then in this sun all the families of the Earth was to be blessed and the patriarch was faithful to his call and the promised word that's what he was faithful to he was an example to what we should be now we being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed so notice that word example he was an example Abraham was an example to his family Abraham was example to Generations to come of a man that staggered not at what at did he make mistakes yes but he staggered not at the promise of God he wasn't in one day and out the other day he wasn't believing it one day and not believing the next day he was consistent in before the world can you say amen for 25 years if you ask the same question you're going to get the same answer from Abraham amen this consistency had an effect can you say Amen this faithfulness this example we need daddies and fathers to be better examples and realize that your actions and what you do and your consistency in being in the house of God your consistency in sharing the word with your children your consistency in overcoming your temper whatever it is your family needs to see that type of example in your life because if you give the wrong example you may not see the results now but you're going to see them five years later right I'm going to go ahead and say it if you look 5 10 years down the road and wonder why your children are in church it's maybe because you weren't very faithful in church if you weren't there Wednesday night then you'll say I wish my kids were here tonight that was the example that you set that it wasn't a priority to be there on Wednesday night and it's going to trickle down effect to your children now you won't see them in church cuz Daddy didn't make it a priority so they're not going to make it a priority I said it I said it but we do things sometimes because it's right can you say Amen but we also do it because of the the Eternal examples the the long trickling fact examples of images it sets in our children's Minds good that's the kind of man I'm talking about here can you say amen he believed the promise of the hour but his actions expressed his belief his obedience expressed his belief praise the Lord everybody still love me praise God Amen it's the truth where the you want to say ouch or whatever it is it's the truth nonetheless this thing this isn't something that's brand new to this generation this is from Generation all the way back to the very beginning is that even even he said in the Leviticus he says the the sins of one generation will pass down to the third and fourth generation brother Brandon brought that up says there's something about that that shows us that there's a long-term effect of what we do now I tell single young people that what you're doing now could even affect your children someday our decisions right now can affect our grandchildren you see so we have to have a long range vision of this when we want to be a father of Faith Can you say Amen it's not just saying I believe the promise of the hour you we stand on the promise of the hour but our actions every day reflect our belief because we're are examples amen say Amen if you can do it praise the Lord and so then this last quote he says Abraham coming from Babylon with his father down into shinar the valley of shinar where the souls of many journeyed after destroying of Babylon or the confusion taking place Abraham's father parent brought Abraham and his loved ones down to shinar and all that land among all those people F God found favor with one one man found favor with God rather and I want you to notice that is the beginning of Christianity of the church and I want you to notice it wasn't listen now it wasn't because Abraham was a good man it was because God elected and chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham can you see it and now watch now as it was then so it is today it isn't you choosing God it's God choosing you now this may be very strong and I want you to notice immediately after Choice immediately after God's election God chose Abraham I'm choosing him this is the one I choose it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham after that election right after that it's separation from everything else as soon as he calls it's the first thing that happens separation he elects calls and then when he calls he separates you from everything that hangs on to you and that proves that it isn't a denomination it's two it isn't two or three people together he expects every individual it's an individual affair with every person it isn't because my mother there is saved that I get saved no no see there now you're talking grandchildren now you're talking you know you're you're you're making it mechanical there in the sense it's it's you doing something it's not because your mother's saved that I'll be saved it's because God chose me in Christ and I want to see it now you're choosing yourself not your choice how much you prayed it's not how much you prayed you turned a new page you had nothing to do with it oh my when you get to see that that that's what the truth is you say you mean that I didn't turn to the Lord no sir you had no way at all of turning to the Lord your whole nature your whole makeup was against God or if we could come to this friends then we come into a real piece that you it wasn't you searching for God it was God searching for you God then we get a revelation of his love yes then we start to respond in faith I can love a god back like that I didn't have anything my whole makeup was against God our whole nature was against God called you it's always been that way in the garden of even when man sin look at the nature of the sinner hiding but it should have been Adam calling God but it was Adam hiding and God calling Adam you see that's the nature of a sinner hide run away get behind something but God's calling God's Amazing Grace God was calling and now notice you say oh that was Adam and Eve it's always Through the Bible the same way Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him is that right and that's the word and that's the way we want it the word when you know where you're standing how many are Christians tonight know that you're Christians there's something in you that says you're a Christian all right you see why you should be let me end on this this is a good one end on because this is what I began with he said if you're a CH how many are Christians tonight raise your hand there's something in you that says you're a Christian all right you should be the happiest people in the world isn't that amazing I started on that tonight and this is where I'm ending you should be the happiest people in the world you should just believe that my that's easy just take God's word for it God's word you didn't choose yourself God chose you like God elected and chose Abraham and now because he realized he didn't do anything to Merit this or it was just out of the clear blue God called him and so now he could begin to respond in faith and in action of his faith I believe the promise of the hour it's dropped in my heart and now all the details that go with it Abraham was obedient to those details because it's just not the promise what's the promise of this hour what's the promise of this hour what's the many promise there's many promises but a a bride in Ephesians he says I'll wash you by the water of the word and I of a spotless bride that's a promise of this hour the Rapture is a promise of this hour but it's not just the promise of the Rapture there's specifics in this age under the prophet that he said that test our obedience you believe the promise oh I believe the promise of the Rapture I believe the promise well where's your actions that go with the promise where's your life that comes o under obedience to him we want to offer that kind of Faith to him that our faith has Works to it and actions to it and then to conclude friends that's the kind of man that's the kind of Faith that's the kind of actions to Faith that had such a powerful effect and now all of a sudden he says the families will be blessed by a man like that have to to just bring the family through all kinds of teaching get the man straightened out amen get the man real strong faith and over time that family will be blessed that family will be blessed told my kids the other night I said to them listen and they know their daddy's not perfect I said hopefully guys I can show you that I I believe the promise of this hour and that you are under a blessing even when you obey that even when you don't understand it even if I express something say this is what the word says this is what the prophet says as for me and my house will serve the Lord this is what we're going to do in our home good and if you come under that obedience until you even don't understand it there's a blessing that comes to Children how many knows are blessing Obedience of children true y it's a commandment with promise right do you even get to live longer Gideon remember that promise right be around a lot longer if you B Daddy it's a blessing it's a commandment with a promise and so it has a trickle down effect to the children that even in them believing and obeying it because they have enough reverence for Daddy's fear of the Lord God daddy's not a perfect man but he's got the fear of the Lord and he reverences when he does something wrong he he apologizes for it but he's stable in this fact he believes the promise of the hour and he's trying to bring his life into obedience to the specifics of that promise that's right when kids will obey that come underneath it there's a blessing even that goes with that even when they don't understand it true because if we present it too much to our kids that you can do whatever you want to until you have a revelation of it I know you're only five years old but you can do whatever you want you're 18 years old now you're out on your own whatever you want to decide to do will be fine no living in my household we've already decided what we're going to do and that's serve the Lord so I don't decide and they don't decide whatever they want to do we're under the headship of God Amen this isn't this isn't Daddy's opinions we're aligned under the headship of a prophet of the hour that's back to the Bible can you say am man and that's how the order of the home is set up these aren't my opinion so we bring oursel underneath that if there's a question that raises we don't know what it is we don't know where it's at in the word well we study it and pray about it and and look to all the things that we can look at and then we make a we make a judgment call this is what we're going to do we have to do that but there's a there's a blessing friends I'm hoping you're catching this tonight God wants to bless the families and I say on the earth we live in today that a lot of the families are come under the curse but still with this Faith there will be some families on this Earth that are blessed let me qualify some things here tonight by saying to you if you have a broken home if you come from a broken home don't feel left out of this message here tonight if you're a bachelor not married don't feel left out of this message tonight so we have some of those because you know what you're loneliness you're you could you're clinging to family don't cling to that uh uh nice new car you'll never get full thrill out of that you cling to your family cling to God can you say Amen so you're right in with all the rest of us you're not detached from us if God chooses that you shouldn't get married in this life that's fine you're part of us I've often said to brother Tom not to embarrass you brother Tom he never had any physical children but he has hundreds hundreds of children that he is mentored and that he's fathered and that he's blessed and that he's influenced can you say Amen so don't try to figure out all the how this happens God has his plan and I just want to present it to you tonight that's what God's all about is relationship family can you say amen that's what God's achievement is is when that is blessed then God comes into his Sabbath that's what I want to see it starts with the right kind of Faith let's stand together and Worship the Lord God bless you let's just pray first and they can know play a little bit and we'll just pray before they before we s a song together well this has been good tonight to think that God thinks that much about families he really does there's such a strain in this day to pull families apart and many come from broken homes and many homes experience troubles and struggles and I don't want you to feel left out tonight if you went through that as a child or whatever uh sometimes trials are allowed in our lives to teach us things but all you need to do is hold on to the promise of God and God can bless what you've laid before him God can bless that the promise still holds true can you say Amen praise the Lord let's pray would you just pray with me if someone want you to just speak to the Lord on these things Heavenly Father how great this has been tonight Lord to realize your heart and to realize how important it is Lord that you're in fellowship with your children Lord this is your great mystery being expressed in this day and when families come into into their blessed place it's just such an expression of what you've done in the family of God lord may we come closer to you through what you've expressed here tonight and we just pray that you'll bless the families of the Assembly of literal life Satan on the Rampage just even trying so hard to knock down the door as in the days of Sodom when they were just knocking at the door pressing at the door trying to get in spirits of Sodom and Lord all the time feeling pressure on my family and different influences that try to get in and also tensions getting between us and we try to work them out and pray and reconcile but Lord then the next day or the next few days then the Satan tries to come in again it's a constant battle to stay in unity together Lord I've tried as a family to keep working at it and just keep praying and keep saying we're we're going to stand as a family Lord it'll be by your grace that we make it through but bless the families here in the church Lord
