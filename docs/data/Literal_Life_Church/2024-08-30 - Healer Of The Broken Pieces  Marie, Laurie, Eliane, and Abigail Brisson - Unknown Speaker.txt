Healer Of The Broken Pieces

Verse 1:
You are the Healer
Healer of my heart
The Maker and the God of all we are
I was the broken vessel in Your hand
But You looked beyond the hurt
And made me whole again

Chorus:
Healer of the broken pieces
You touched my heart and made it new
Now my whole life I surrender
Lay it down before the Mender
Lord I give my heart to You

Verse 2:
Love that sought before I knew You
(You faithfully sought me)
As brought me near to where You are
Now I live to praise You
Ever may I praise You
The Healer of my heart

Verse 3:
Oh and nothing compares, Lord
To knowing You
Oh and seeing
what the grace of God can do
You faithfully sought me
And called me Your own
Then made the way
to bring my wandering heart back home
You are my Healer

Verse 4:
And now my heart is Yours forever
I mean all of who You are
And now I live to praise You
Ever may I praise You
The Healer of my heart
