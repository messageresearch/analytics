========================================

that we ended come off of them from Sunday and just break it down a little bit tonight in this Wednesday service we welcome all of you it's good to be in his house and we appreciate the the spirit of entering into worship and inviting our Lord to come and do what he feels and is wants to do tonight in this service God bless you well the devil's on the run I'll tell you after Sunday the devil's on the run and I think with the service and also sister amariah's testimony online and her song I'm telling you it dealt a deadly blow to the enemy I'm telling you it dealt a deadly blow we're hearing testimonies from a lot of places we don't give glory to man or to sister and Mariah but I'll tell you when someone Rises to the occasion and says I'm going to give the devil a black eye I'm going to speak about what God's done we're getting a lot of response and I think the devil's angry that's her job right can he say man to defeat him and make him angry praise be to God good to be with you tonight second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and that's a reference to something in war where you have strongholds we have walls in the Old Testament different things that are are blocking us and so we have a power within the word and within the spirit of God that will pull down strongholds and we're thankful for that but remember we don't walk in the flesh we are we are fleshly we are human we make mistakes can you say Amen so but though he said we walk in the flesh verse three we do not war after the flesh so we cannot fight demons with fleshly power we can't respond to demonic forces and what Satan brings us with just an intellect or something human it has to be something more powerful so even though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having an a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled that's quite a statement in itself that having a Readiness we're prepared to Revenge all uh all Disobedience so no that now that's you know we talk about revenge we're not supposed to take revenge on our own hands towards someone else but any Disobedience that's in our life Disobedience and our thoughts that's something we can take revenge John and come against so the whole thought here is as Paul's thought to be able to bring these thoughts captive to him to be ready to Revenge all Disobedience and that our obedience was fulfilled I personally believe this scripture speaks of a final Victory also uh in when he says when your obedience is fulfilled someday your complete obedience will be fulfilled can you say man the bride is going to fulfill a complete obedience and I believe she's going to recognize her position and when she fully does she'll take a Rapture Lord bless your word tonight anoint it be with us in this teaching and we pray you'll bless those that are here that have come and those that are listening we pray that you'll use us Lord and may we receive your unction your ministering Spirit from your throne to speak through us tonight we humbly submit to it in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated I just trust that all this from last Sunday and speaking about these things would be more than a lesson to us and more than just a teaching but I trust that we can take the things home and apply them everything that we speak we want to be able to apply it we want to be able to use it against the enemy and so I trust that you would take these these Sundays and these Wednesday nights and these lessons as more than a lesson and more than a teaching but it's it's to be applied and to Echo what I said Sunday when the love of God moves us then we need to go without and we need to watch what it does can you say Amen when the love of God moves you you need to go with that and go because we need to trust that and then watch what the love of God can do supernaturally and don't let your thinking talk you out of it do you know that your thinking can talk you out of good things that's supposed to come your way your fears can influence your thinking and talk you out of something really good that's supposed to happen to you God's sending something your way and you can talk yourself out of it amen so think about how powerful that is that's what what will speak of but we don't want to let our thinking interrupt and we want to apply in every situation during during the day uh what we're what we're we're learning can you say Amen that love is flowing through us it should flow out of us and that we need to apply it to every situation my problem I don't know if it's your problem but there's certain situations come up I'll Resort back to I'll figure this one out myself but but we're supposed to say Lord but now here's another situation I'm speaking to my child I'm speaking to this one or that one or speaking to someone else and every situation we just lay back say now what would the love of God want to say here I was going through the Valvoline Instant Oil last night and doing getting my oil changed and my mom's van there and so I won't be long on this but I was just sitting there and when I told him it was a church related vehicle this young man this young man just began to really talk to me and I told him as a church but the talk was very bitter uh he let me know clearly he was an atheist he let me know he grew up in a Conservative Christian Home In Georgia and said well you don't have an accent anymore and he'd only been here just a few years I said usually my wife she still has her accent you know and he said he don't have that well that just opened up and then he talked about his the legalism of his childhood and his parents and just he went on and on and on and on and luckily he had other guys working on my car to get the job done but he just talked and so then you know this is how I thought and just being honest with you not my first thought was that that's a ton of scriptures came to me that I could address this I could correct this I could respond quickly because you know I've fed on the word since I was 16 years old and that was the first but I just sat back and said no wait a minute this is an opportunity to say what what's God want to do here instead of just giving a bunch of scriptures and he might associate we me with his family and his childhood and I said Lord what are you doing here because this man's really opening up to me and I don't know him from from anybody and he just really is letting me have it he didn't know as a pastor but you know I was a church related and he just kept getting going and I said I said well isn't it interesting I said I thought the Lord led me to say this isn't it interesting that God you're an atheist Now isn't it bad that somehow in this world God has to be tainted by some bad things that the church does it's too bad that God got tainted for you because to me God should be separate than that he's pure he doesn't have anything to hurt you but yet you associate it with that you know I just said that's too bad and then he went on and on he did all the talking and uh kept going and I said what what was it what was the re what's the real deal he's showing me a tattoo of joining Satan's church and all of it's in retaliation let my parents know I mean it this this guy was he was a friendly guy but man was he ever bitter and I just said nor let my love reach out to this young man what do you want to say to him and I just begin to feel I'm going to just to say a few things I told him I appreciate you sharing your heart I knew I'd be through there again I said I'll see you next time and just plant the sea a few seeds there that's what I felt to do but I said what was it what's really what what happened he said I'll tell you he said he said the church was trying to be put on such a such a front to everybody and make me put it on he said when I was molested sexually by my uh by uncles or whoever it was as a little boy the church covered that up they wouldn't talk about it they wouldn't deal with it they wouldn't preach against it and he says that's what I said I and you know what fella I understand how you feel because I said that should never happen and so he still was very cold and everything but you know what I got a chance to say a few things and I'm trying to look past as the prophet of God was led to do just to look past all the front of all the bitterness and look past and the way he was talking to me it's almost like he felt like that he was reaching out for something and unsettled and that's what I said and so I I'm going to say I'm going to leave and leave him with some good words and I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for him I'm going to prayer for and I don't know his name I wouldn't say it here tonight but I'm going to pray for him so every everything nothing should be left out of in our lives of something we come up against of praying saying now Lord how do you want your what that which is within me to come out in this situation it might be your husband in an argument with your husband may not be the guy at Valvoline it might be your husband or wife so we need to think about that can you say man now if we look at our text tonight in second Corinthians 10 the subject that Paul brings out here is actually first related to Paul being misread by uh a few Believers and so This Is How They misread him back in the first scriptures if you want to break it down in second Corinthians chapter 10 he said I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who Am presence and base among you but being absent and bold towards you I'm going to pick it up in the Amplified and read it so I want you to catch why Paul's writing this chapter and the theme behind it it's it's some Believers that were Mis uh misunderstanding Paul and this is how they must understood him uh now I Paul urge you to buy the gentleness and graciousnesses of Christ I who am meek he said now I who am meek so they say when I'm with you face to face but bold outspoken and fearless towards you when I'm absent so it's not he said that they're actually criticizing some Believers and saying Paul he's so different when he's in the Pulpit he's so different when he's face to face and he's so he's so humble and he's just so gentle about things but the letters we're getting from him my goodness he's raking us over the goals and they were they were clearly misunderstanding his love and misunderstanding him and these were Believers that were doing that and he goes on to say then he says they say when you when you're face to face you're humble and meek but bold when you're out smoking a Fearless when you write us your letters I ask that when I do come I will not be driven to the boldness that I intend to show towards those those few who regard us as if we walked to the flesh like men without the spirit so he discerned that these guys were being these brothers were being carnal about how they were viewing Paul and he said when I come I'm praying that I won't be driven to be bold towards those men and also the the how they've misread me for though then he goes into for though we walk in the flesh as mortal men we are human we are mortal men we are we are we have mortal weakness can you say Amen we are not but we are not carrying on our spiritual warfare according to the Flesh and using the weapons of man so they were misreading Paul in what he was saying that somehow it was some carnal agenda that he what he was saying uh in his letters to them and uh I I just could just tell you I have been there and done that and I feel that feeling sometimes people misread your motives and misread the things that you're saying and sometimes would even take it personal and I never intend to want to do that if I do it I apologize for it but I not never want to intend to do that but you know I've met ministers and you can sit across the table from them and you you can't hardly get a word out on they're just so quiet uh and they're just they don't hardly say nothing you can't hardly fuss with because they're just so humble and so quiet we see humble is quiet that's what we associate it with and and but then you see them in the Pulpit just as bold and you know just say it like it is you know and so sometimes the anointing will bring a minister to do that and he's saying things that might appear carnally to you that might hurtful but you don't want to take it as hurtful you want to say this may be the Lord speaking to me but you know he goes on to say here for though we walk in the flesh we are not carrying our Warfare according to the Flesh and using the weapons of man the weapons of our Warfare are not physical weapons of Flesh and Blood our weapons are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses we are destroying listen to this we are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God we are warring against sophisticated arguments on the internet today that's what we're warning at but we're not warring against it with reasoning or or the spirit of argument can you say man we're coming at it with the love of God and the weapons of our Warfare are our spiritual not carnal you can't fight anger with anger you can't fight carnality with carnality you can't fight an evil spirit with another evil spirit you can't do that it has to be something greater than that evil spirit and so I loved how he this is worded in the Amplified we're destroying the sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself against the knowledge of God and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to The Obedience of Christ being ready to punish Every Act of Disobedience when your own obedience as a church is complete so now what we pull out of this section of scripture is something beyond what Paul was saying that these men are judging me carnal he we get the lesson that our the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're spiritual and we don't fight back with something carnal Paul's saying I'm a human being being but I can't fight back with something human it has to be something greater than that it has to be the love of God it has to be the the knowledge of God and so now but we take a lesson out of this and what's the lesson we learn Paul is giving the power the the huge power of our own imagination and that's what I want to elaborate on tonight but the the power of our imagination I want to title this if I can the casting down stinking thinking as I mentioned that to you Sunday casting down he said casting down imagination we're casting down stinking thinking because it's stinking thinking that gets in the way of God it's stinking thinking that gets in the way of the love of God and so he's he's catching it down so we want to go a little bit into the power of our imagination and the thoughts that are inside our spirit realm they're not in our soul the mind of Christ is in the soul but but in our spirit realm is memory imagination conscience effects or reasoning and and these things that in our spirit realm if they're not under the control of God they become very powerful to sway a human being even Christians can be swayed by their emotions by their feelings by their imaginations by their own thoughts in their Spirit if they let that rule and Reign it can quench the spirit of God working in your life this is this is our walk with the Lord now it's actually what I believe is being spoken to the bride right now you hear other ministers speaking about it that our power comes when we bring this body under subjection to him that that uh that every channel is cleaned out and ready for service for the Lord that the devil doesn't know what channel to get into that's the victory for the bride then let God do what he wants to do through that but our vessel's got to be submitted to him we can't have a Victorious Life over to the devil if our imaginations are going wild we can't have a Victorious life if we're reasoning with the word all the time we have to bring those things in our spirit under his leadership so the power of our own imagination in our spirit realm and the worst thing about this realm of imagination is when it will exalt itself above the knowledge of God can you imagine the arrogance Lucifer did it at the beginning he got thoughts he was the right-hand angel of God and he got started to have thoughts and those thoughts got him into the different thoughts of lifting himself I will be above the most high can you imagine the arrogance and so his thoughts became so powerful that he actually began to a a connive a plan to somehow bring in and lift himself above the knowledge of God and set himself above God and so now we shouldn't always we know the devil did that but it shows the power of a human mind that can be in us even let me just say it this way if the Lucifer did that at the beginning his own thoughts eventually got so arrogant that I will lift myself above though I would sit as him and be worshiped of God if if if your thoughts exalt itself above the word of God who are you being inspired by who are you being inspired by if the your thoughts can be lifted above the knowledge of God you know who you're inspired by you're already off track so this is you know the worst thing about it is it lifts itself above the knowledge of God that's a serious thing that's a tragic thing when it's happened it's actually to me the worst thing that a Christian can let happen is to let our own thinking or Satan's things thinking lift itself above the knowledge of God what does it do it quenches the spirit of God from moving in you it quenches the spirit of God from moving in the church it stunts your growth it keeps marriages and families from finding that key to get out of the rut that they're in to get out of the spirit that's with them for years it's stunts and it keeps a marriage and family from the key because sometimes there's just a key of faith that unlocks and all of a sudden in a moment's time forgiveness comes in and things are changed and Everything's changed can you say Amen but if our minds interrupt that it quenches that from happening you see and people can live in a miserable marriage for years sometimes even living together living separate but it's because there's something holding them from getting that key that unlocks Faith to change the situation and so when our thoughts lift themselves above the knowledge of God it quenches the love of God it quenches the spirit of God it stunts our growth it it hinders families it brings bondage to marriages and families what what is it your own thinking has the power to do that your own thoughts the power of our own imagination realm I'm going to borrow something a quote that was quoted by brother Donnie last Sunday and I just say this I don't get much time to listen to some of the other brothers I I don't have the time they probably don't have the time but when someone recommends something usually I'll go and listen to it someone recommended the last two Sundays by the Donnie especially last Sunday so we took the time my wife and I to listen to some of it and I'll tell you he brought a quote I'd never knew brother Bram said I'm going to read it to you tonight I don't have it on the board so just listen he says back in 1954 he about imagination I want you to notice the power and the an example of what your imagination can do you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine that they do and you just keep thinking that they don't like me they don't like me they hate me and the first thing you know you'll be shunning that person now it's not reality you don't know if it's truth and brother might say it's not truth they don't hate you but your imagination has made it true and now you're acting upon your imagination that says something true and you're shunning them and they're probably wondering why you're shutting them what's the deal what happened how come they're shutting me well something's happening in your mind in your imagination it's just creating something that's untrue you better all be listening and online you better all be listening preachers deacons everybody ought to be listening because your mind and your imagination has the power to do little things like this and you could go for weeks for months and even years with the wrong Concept in your imagination living it out as if it was true we're not called to do that he said they don't mean first thing you do you'll be shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you and after a while notice how Brother Martin gives the process here after a while it becomes so a reality to you to you actually believe that that person doesn't like you and you might ball them out or say something to you so now you got one thing that shuns them now you're going to ball them out all these actions now you're going to ball them out so one thing that makes you shun people then you're going to ball them out and so now uh he says here you might ball them out or say something for instance your wife your husband to your neighbor or something like that when the person the person is absolutely innocent of any ill thing it's because that you just imagine it so till it become a reality to you how powerful is your imagination it can take you so well I'm a Christian that doesn't happen to me really you're a Christian you got the holy ghost in your soul but the rest of you is not born again your imagination is not born again your reasoning is not born again your memory is not born again your soul is born again but the rest of you two-thirds of you is still unconverted and will be till we hit a rapture so the overcoming power of a Believer is to take that power and that which is in the soul that has the power of God to live an overcoming life let it flow out and take over the mind and the spirit and say no you're not allowed to think that way imagination you're not allowed to imagine anything that's not true and I'm going to use it for the sake of the Lord and you know people do that they use their imagination inspiration and things for the kingdom of God and God gets glory for it but when it's under the anointing of Satan even as a Christian it becomes damaging to the body of Christ and damaging to your life it has such power to it and don't you put this off to your grandmother or grandfather every one of you had the realm of imagination here tonight and are capable and you probably have done the very thing that he's talking about tonight that you have imagined something that hates you and they must hate me and the next week they do hate me and you either shun them or you ball them out and everybody's wondering who has the problem here and the problem is your imagination nobody likes me nobody everybody hates me nobody will talk to me when are you going to quit listening to your own thoughts and start believing the truth I thought that was so powerful and there's an example after example I hadn't seen that one but man it's so true that they somebody hates me they don't hate you okay now there's people who do hate you there is people who do hate you but guess what the love of God is the answer for both so there's no sense in getting nervous when somebody does hate you and you know it the way they're acting they're slapping you in the face and they're there's demons coming out of them and they're vicious with you okay this person hates me what's the answer the love of God it's still a love of God we still got to overcome it we still got to respond right so but this is so powerful that the other end of it is that and I've often said people live in such fear of what's going to happen tomorrow that uh it hasn't even happened yet and they're living as if it's already happened we'll get into that a little bit more tonight so this is how powerful it is it becomes so real and you call it truth and you conclude then when you conclude in your mind that it's true then you go to some extremes then it becomes it can become so concrete and I don't have the word for this I'm just using concrete some of your thoughts can become so poured with concrete that they are there for life and there's nothing that will change that thought you are determined I will always think that may about that person I will always and it becomes concrete nothing can move it even the spirit of God himself is quenched and has a hard time changing that concrete thought it becomes so embedded in your thinking and it's so true and it's so concrete that you're and people say I will never I will never be careful of those words I will never respond to that person again I will never do that again we've got a case here with a mom and a sister in this church that testified brought her mom a few weeks ago and that's where she coming after her early years with her mom what she did to her and listen friends the love of God through this series and through the holy spirit said you can't do that letter in a different direction invite her to church and trying to find some grounds to even though she's she maybe don't have the Lord yet to find some grounds to love her I'll tell you that's beyond human can you say man that's when the love of God broke up that concrete thought and say I will never talk to her again I will never do that yet only the love of God breaks the concrete and says oh no you can't be concrete like that crushes our own thoughts it says let me give you another thought there is a power that can change your thinking and break the concrete some people are so concrete and stubborn oh I'm not preaching about any I'm sure I'm preaching about somebody out there online not you people sitting here tonight I'm sure it's for somebody else not you but some people can be so concrete and stuck and stubborn in their thinking I will never and that's how perfect quenches the spirit of God from your life I'll never get up and shout and act like those people act that's fanaticism criticize it can you say I mean you shouldn't do that because if you got free and let the spirit lead you you might do some crazy things too amen that's right because when someone's free brother Brian says if you get enough victory in your life you'll dance I'm just quoting the prophet now you get enough Victory you're going to dance and you criticize other people's deaths it's feeling free it's feeling the stimulation of the Revelation it's feeling I'm being set free here there's something happening in my mind there's something happening to my heart there's a Revival happening in me and the same thing that makes your emotions go crazy at a baseball game now the holy spirit is moving those emotions I don't care what people think anymore I'm going to worship God and it stops quenching the spirit in your life and it starts releasing and being you the real you praise the Lord somebody say praise the Lord our thoughts even the spirit of God is quenched it is not even the some people's concrete thoughts are not given room to be corrected or challenged our thoughts can never be put in such a place that that cannot be corrected there's not one thought of your own that can that that is in a place that wouldn't be under the spotlight of God's word to be corrected all the time there's not one final thought I said it's Sunday there's only one person that's the first thought they had was a perfect thought they never have to go back and rethink it they know how never have to have another meeting about it they don't have to re-examine it examine it can you say man that's why the niacin Council was so perverted God had his thoughts about he was in Christ he was one can you say man God has his talks about and he didn't just think it he lived it out in front of him because God's thoughts became material and he never wanted man you listened in online he never he never organized a group of men to say we need to get together and decide what the godhead is and establish it for the church for the rest of time and split him into three persons God never LED you to do that God never LED you to believe that God had a thought I am one can you say amen and I'm coming in my son I'll still be one when I come in my son glory be to God he had a thought and he manifested and he doesn't need your interpretation to it the first time he thought it it was perfect and men shouldn't get together we need to have a meeting to dissect this godhead you messed it all up you messed it all up oh I say it respectfully but God God never intended that Satan orchestrated things to split God into three persons and make an idolater out of you anything more than one God and more than one person makes an idolatrous worship I got no problem with God being a trinity in three offices I'm one person but I got I've got 50 offices that I fulfill husband father son all these other things but I'm still only one person and God's only one person God's only one person amen the flesh body of Jesus say well that was he had a different Spirit yeah the flesh body had to come as a flesh body and go to Calvary but the Bible says he was the fullness of God and the fullness of God dwelt in him it was all of God in that vessel praise the Lord so now I'm going back to the thought God doesn't need us to correct his uh his thought is perfect the first time but your thoughts have to be corrected some people have such arrogance say I thought this and that's what happened and because I thought it it's conclusion no it ain't our thoughts always have to be corrected our thoughts and conclusions are never to be made permanent or unchanging or will stop growing will stop learning I if I'm 85 years and if I live that long I never want my thoughts to not be corrected by the word of God I appreciate this so much about one of my mentors brother Lonnie Jenkins it was one of my mentors and what I appreciate he was a teacher and teachers kind of they explore and they bring new things sometimes that God's showing them in the word of God but I would hear him say years back he'd preach something and then I'd hear him say at 80 years old I said what do you think about this subject he said well I always thought that way but the other day the Lord corrected me and so I corrected that and started to preach it just a little bit more perfect according to the scripture an 80 year old man how many 80 year olds how many 80 year olds do you see in this world that are concrete they're never going to change their mind about life I don't want to be that way friends I want to say Lord I'm I'm 95 years old I'm here at literal life today I'm not the pastor anymore but I'm here to worship God and Shout Whatever my body will let me do and I'm here to be corrected by the word of God if I'm thinking wrong let the spotlight shine on my thinking and let me change somebody say praise the Lord tonight our thoughts and conclusions are never to be permanent or will stop growing and learning our thoughts are never to be unaccountable for life our thoughts are to be under the spotlight of God's word and his spirit all the time always subject to to uh to being corrected always subject to the scrutiny of the Holy Spirit always because of 9 11 happening in our country we will never ever enter an airport again without walking through the scanner do you realize that we'll never have a day when we won't be walking through something to scan what's on our body after 9 11. because we learned the enemy can get through and so now we have to have scanner you're not an enemy you might not have a gun you're not a terrorist but because everybody's suspect right we all got it for the rest of our lives we're never going to change it we'll never enter an airport again without a scanner and if that's a lesson for us to realize if you have a 911 in your life and you have a jolt in your life of what the enemy did to you to tear up your marriage or tear up your life or make you fall that's a 911 that says from now on every thought is captive to the Lord and every thought is scanned scanned and checked by the Holy Spirit because it was my thought life that got me into all that it was my thoughts in pornography that led me to adultery it started with my thoughts is anybody listening tonight it starts in the thought life nobody goes and sins right away it starts in their thinking it starts and then they things that I want more of that Allah so I'm going to look at pornography I'm going to look at this magazine I'm going to look at this woman I'm going to keep doing but it started in their thoughts they let their thoughts be uncontrolled and unchecked by the Holy Spirit and then it turns into sin and so if you have a 911 you better start saying every thought comes under the Captivity of the Lord there is no thought allowed to think on my own it's scanned by the Holy Spirit and if it's a negative thought it's a thought to put somebody down if it's a thought against me when you've got everything under the blood and Satan's accusing you if it's a thought from Satan you're an unworthy believer you don't deserve to come and worship God you don't deserve to even pray today because of what you've done that's a thought that originates in the pits of hell and you quickly say that's not of God it gets scanned it gets out of here it's Satan trying to be bring a gun through the airport can you say man he's bringing a weapon against you in the airport but it gets scanned and it gets confiscated that thought gets confiscated and will not be allowed to go any further into the airport oh glory be to God praise God let every thought get confiscated that's not of him praise the Lord so now under God's Spotlight this is where we need to and we Christians we we need Christians to say never again will a thought be allowed to Lodge in my mind without being brought through the scanning light of the word of God can you say Amen so this is our text casting down imagination for the weapons of other casting down imaginations and and everything that exalteth itself above against the knowledge of God it's contrary so we cast down that imagination we cast down that stinking thinking we cast down what's lifting itself higher than than the leadership of the Lord then you say Amen you think I'm not talking to you as a teenager tonight or as a young man or as a young woman say well I don't even know about what what you're preaching I you know I can't catch all of it you can catch this say I'm only 12 years old you can catch what I'm saying here because guess what when you leave here and even tonight while I was preaching your thought just wandered off somewhere what am I going to do tomorrow I wonder if my my school is going to be difficult tomorrow you have a mind you have a brain you had thoughts and if you looked at something dirty today then your mind's going back to that and I might go back and look at that when I get home so this message is for you tonight this message is for you teenager and it would be better that you get filled with this Holy Spirit and bring your mind under control when you're 10 12 years old it would be better you listen to this fat preacher now and get you now and you could live a lot more Victorious the rest of your life because when you get to 25 30 years old and you fed on wrong things and your mind is all messed up it's a lot harder for the Lord to get a hold of you becomes concrete you'd be like that guy Valvoline oil Instant Oil Change that is so bitter and atheist I don't even believe in God anymore that's how far mind can go but I'm going to keep loving because there's a there's a force of love of God that can change that doesn't matter how bitter they become that's how your mind can get so concrete though so it gets God I'm amazed I don't even believe in God it's crazy to think that people believe that I don't believe in God they believe isn't a god look around you you know how can you believe there's not a god but in their own thoughts it it grows and grows and grows against exalts itself against the knowledge of God my what a what a heart that was just reaching out what I my my my feelings went out for the young man and I knew he loved his mom and dad but such hatred towards him and his upbringing and the legalism and just all the phoniness and I just my heart just was crying for him oh God save this young boy so casting and down imagination and every thought we should do it because we don't want to be in the inspiration of Satan can you say Amen and when your thoughts are led to the exalt itself above the word of God then what inspiration are you under that's under the same one as Lucifer from the beginning can you say Amen so we have stinking thinking we have we're to cast down any stinking thinking when it has a smell on it we need to admit that it smells you ever had somebody that smells and they don't smell it but everybody else can and so they need a shower or they something you don't need something and and so but it smells and and so we need to have a sensitivity when thoughts are stinking thinking that's a thought that's thinking that smells that doesn't ring with the aroma of God amen we need to admit it when something a thought doesn't smell right and it's pretty bad when we lose our smell for stinking thinking covid messed with a lot of people's smell sense mess with mine I can never I haven't been able to smell the same since I can't smell some things I can't smell some things that are on me so I'm thankful I have a wife to remind me I'm serious what a devil now what a devil what a demon Spirit now I don't know if it's done to you but my smell's never been I don't smell things the same I don't smell food the same and I I can't smell certain things and and so what a devil that's in that disease and it might be a type and a shadow of what the devil's doing to us you know the Bible says whose conscience is seared like an iron the conscious becomes seared they don't have a conscience anymore they can't sense right and wrong anymore they can't sense when they sin anymore because their conscience has been seared with a hot iron and so the now the smell of disease that takes the smell and messes with the smell and they can't pick up on the smell of sin anymore we should be able to see so sensitive we can smell sin when it's coming we can smell a Temptation when it's coming at us and we can smell stink and think in a bad thought that Satan's thought we can smell it when it's coming and get rid of it amen so you know I don't know how how much further to go tonight because I could split this up and get it Sunday what time are we at here 807 all right so you know I didn't realize that when when we talk about this thing we have some um I'll just give it a few more minutes if it's okay with you I could pick this up maybe Sunday but I want I was wanting to go into something else Sunday a little bit and take it further but you know there's a there's an article that says what is thinking thinking and how to manage it and this is what psychology does and I didn't realize they call it stinging thinking but they say human beings the psychological part of human beings it has what they call stinking thinking and they've narrowed it down to 10 main things and they say uh they call it cognitive distortions or stinking thinking cognitive distortions or stinking thinking are negative or irrational thoughts that lack evidence cognitive distortions this is every human being cognitive distortions or stinking thinking are negative or irrational thoughts that lack evidence and influence how you feel or your behavior it's the psychology of it I don't mind reading it because they Peg it right I know that because how I live you know it because how you live this is cognitive distortions and they can become extreme or they can be at a low level but there are distortions they're stink and think they are negative irrational thoughts that we should get rid of because they destroy our lives now tonight I'm going to read a few from that article and of course psychology always you know the title of this article is uh how to manage it they're going to give their reasons to manage it I'm going to skip some of that part you can read it if you want because I I believe the word of God has given us answers to manage it can you say man that's what we respond with when we have a human psychology of what it's doing we've got a holy ghost we got the word we got the Lord that can speak to us and we yield ourselves to it and he'll help us through our thought process does the Bible speak about what we should think about very clearly whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is of good report think on these things it tells us what to direct our minds to think about but the cognitive negative and distortions bring stinking thinking and that's what they call it everyone they say experiences cognitive distortions to some degree there's a natural part there they are a natural part of human of the human being but when they happen too frequently or in more extreme forms they can be harmful and contribute to problems such as anxiety and depression your thoughts go in a certain direction contributes can contribute to anxiety and depression goes back with thought just like I said when somebody ends up in an adultery or sin it started with their thought life it had stages to it so anxiety and depression we don't belittle someone from that but it has to start some way and a lot of times it's Satan attacking your thoughts can you say Amen it starts here what you're thinking about all the time if you don't bring that under control he'll take your way off can you say ma'am so that's what this this stinking thinking or this cognitive distortions in our thought process can bring anxiety and depression there are many ways to manage negative thoughts in the moment and begin to change the pattern of stinking thinking the first step in managing stinking thinking is to understand the different types of cognitive distortions so that you can recognize them when they're happy why don't you disagree with that but they're saying that the first step is managing in managing this stinking thinking is to understand the different types of stinking thinking I'm gonna correct that and say the first step dealing with this is to start yielding to the Holy Spirit letting him expose your wrong thinking praise the Lord and I'm going to give a second step the second step is to be transformed by the word in the renewing of your mind I'm going to give answers from the word of God because God gives answers to the human suffering and The Human Condition and your spirit he understands it he builds you can you say Amen how would God build us with a spirit memory imagination and Consciousness affection and then not give us power or give us answers how to bring it under control God wouldn't do that but he says the glory of God will dwell in man when he brings it under subjection it says the first step is man of managing them is to understand the different types I think I'm going to read the different types that they give tonight but I can tell you the first step is yielding the Holy Spirit and let him expose your wrong thinking you sit in a service where the holy spirit is and he's exposing your wrong thinking about stuff I trust that you're Whispering under your breath oh God I'm getting correction today I shouldn't think like that take that thought out of my mind the first the first uh Distortion how people think is called the All or Nothing thinking all the nothing thing sometimes called black and white thinking is the tendency to think in absolutes I I have to do right or I'm not going to do it at all I have to do it right I have to be perfect or I'm not going to do it at all it's it's thinking in extremes and other things black and white thinking it's only perfect or I'm not going to do it at all and then they give their thing to help um you know the prophet talks about um a boss at a certain Corporation and he interviewed a guy for a job and he had him sign his signature and he brought his own pencil and he says how come your pencil doesn't have an eraser and the guy said because I don't make any mistakes and the boss said I'm not hiring you because usually people who don't make mistakes are they won't do anything on the job and I know that's simple and then the prophet goes on and describes he says if we don't we have to be willing to work for the kingdom of God and step out and do things and be willing to make the mistakes and ask God's forgiveness for those mistakes he says if we approach it I'm not going to do anything because I don't want to make any mistakes then we end up not doing anything and we can learn from our mistakes it's not where you intentionally go make mistakes but if we're human we'll make them can I get an amen okay so we we must not be afraid of making mistakes in our thinking people they won't do anything because they're afraid of making mistakes doing so they won't learn something new they won't do something because their thought process says I'm not going to do it if I can't do it perfectly right then I'm not going to do it at all I'm not going to be perfect in front of everyone this is religion on the outside is that I'm I have to be perfect in front of everybody or I'm not participating Prophet said how can you fail where you're in Jesus Christ we'll make mistakes but when you're in Christ how can you fail you can't fail you've got everlasting life all demons and hell can't shake see I'm answering these things with the word of God tonight can you say amen I can give psychologies answers but I'm answering it with the word of God and the prophet said all demons in hell can't shake you you've got everlasting life Jesus said so so don't be scared of failure don't be afraid of failure you say well I'm afraid that I'll get fanatic I'll be a fanatic I'd rather have a little fanaticism than to sit still and do nothing oh amen we need a balance but he said I prefer a little fanaticism might be corrected then people scent like bumps and log and they're not going to enter in you know why they don't enter in because their minds talk them out of it I'm not going to be a religious zealot and get up there and make a fool of myself and your mind is taking you away from being led by the spirit of God convicted by the spirit worshiping in the spirit can you say Amen freedom of the spirit your mind talked you out of it the second thing you people think about in in an abnormal thought or stinking thinking it's over generalization over generalization is seeing a pattern based upon a single event and being overly broad when drawing conclusions so you've seen one thing and you and you take a single event and you generalize all future events and being overly broad when drawing the conclusions I feel awkward I I felt awkward on my date that I went on I'm always so awkward so it's the generalization of your entire character I felt awkward tonight you know what I'm always awkward I'm always awkward and see this is what they call a stinking thinking because you let your mind take one event one thing that you felt embarrassed and now you start judge your entire character by it and there may not be truth to that I know this might be simple to some and it might be psychology to some it is psychology but it the thing is friends is you and I do this in our thinking sometimes it's an over generalization can you say Amen praise the Lord so or I always do this or I'm always so bad and it may not be true the devil wants little mistakes to Define your whole character and Destiny and identity that's the devil's thoughts he wants one little mistake to Define your entire character your entire Destiny your entire identity but tonight I'm here to tell you he's a liar Satan's a liar we repent we move on and our ultimate identity and destination is In Christ Alone can you say Amen our ultimate identity and destination is not in our own thoughts it's what God Said that we are and God said and so now then the third one I've got to move quick because there's ten and I'd like to get you uh going here tonight a mental filter people think and this is stink and thinking a military filter a mental filter is when you only pay attention to certain types of evidence certain types of evidence or focus on the negative for example you focus on one criticism in an otherwise positive performance reveal at your job so you got everything else positive everything else positive but you have one negative review and you judge your entire character by the negative review that's the way your thought process it's a mental filter to bring it through the negative filter all the time and miss all the positive pastors can notice everybody who's missing from church instead of noticing everybody who's there instead of rejoicing of who was there he's worried about who wasn't there well to me it's their fault they wasn't there it's their fourth they weren't listening online they're cheated out of it I'm doing my job I'm here to raise the the bar and the standard before the people can you say Amen but pastors can get under complexes and they say they spend all week with wonder why so and so wasn't there you know I quit doing that years ago it's not that I don't pray for you but listen I don't worry about it because God was there and there was some hungry people there and that's what happened and that's what took place and that's the positive but you and your thinking can think about the one negative thing that happened in the day and everything else was positive but you're gonna be you know vegan on the couch with two gallons of ice cream whoa that's right because you remember the one negative thing that happened to you somebody made one sentence to you and it's just your spirit is crushed you might have got all kinds of compliments from everybody else and all kinds of encouraging things but you're going to dwell on the one negative that's a mental filter that's stinking thinking praise the Lord your mind chooses the negative of yourself every time but what God says about me is the only real truth can you say Amen I'm giving you the word of God one mistake or one sin is not the final word on my life he gets the final say what they say in that night of worship for Jehovah gets the final say is that what the name of the song was Jehovah Jehovah gets the final say the devil doesn't get the final say I don't get the final say Jehovah Jehovah gets the final say all right get back up here we got seven more to finish the fourth one is thinking thinking is discounting the positive that's similar with the last one you discount the good things that have happened or feel like your accomplishments don't count my answer doesn't count because it was a lucky guess and so now that's the way it's a negative thought process and I think we need to be positive towards the enemy towards people I think we need to remain positive in our minds and our confession God help us to see this tonight help me to be better at this to say I may lose a battle now and then but I've already won the war there used to be a song that said I may lose a battle every now and then but I've already won the war he's made us victorious in Jesus Christ I'm going to think on the good things and not the things that let me down or bring me down number five and stinking thinking is jump into conclusions I know none of you ever jumped to conclusions you just don't do that here you're too holy you're just too holy of people but there's some of us in our stinking thinking that jump to conclusions we do this when we interpret the meaning of a situation with little or no evidence at all it can come in the form of the following mind reading imagining we know what others are thinking or believe people are amazing they're like prophets they can imagine and they know what other people are thinking about them they're not prophets but they think they are because they thought I know they're thinking out about me that's what they're thinking how do you know you're not a mind reader mind reading imagining we know what others are thinking or believing for example you might think the boy canceled our date he must not think I'm attractive you don't know that he might have canceled it because he couldn't make it he wants to reschedule and he does think you're attractive come on all you people I think that's a good example they canceled coming over for dinner because they really didn't like us to start with you mind reader you know what mind reading course did you take how do you know that it's jumping to conclusions and it's stinking thinking people fear things that haven't even happened yet it's enough to overcome what's really happened in our life that's enough to have to overcome things that haven't happened yet most of the testimony people you know what I like about this congregation are most of the people who are testifying of things and they're going to go get a test at the doctor because there's a hint that something might be wrong and Through the Years in this church most of the time sister Inez all of them most the time are confessing and saying I'm believing that there's going to be nothing in that test can you say Amen instead of believing that the worse can you say Amen the doctor is going to tell me today that I have cancer and they say it predicting the future the doctors I know that I know I know I know they're going to tell me that I have cancer and what I've heard is the confession say they're not going to tell me I have cancer and time after time I watched it to be true sometimes there's something there but a lot of times there's nothing there could have been but the confession got honored and the test was clear I got a testimony and sister my did I send this to you from Andrea Andre Grant here she wanted you to have it hello brother Paul this is Andrea Grant from Linden Washington I spoke with you when you were in BC at Living Word past this past Sunday I should have remembered to tell you that sister Rebecca would probably remember the grants the grant girls who used to come to Winter YouTube way back in the day we sure loved going to Winter youth retreat that was such a blessing to us and brought us all closer to the Lord thank you so much for all you did to make that Retreat such an awesome experience for us over the years that we went I also really enjoyed the services you preached and the songs you sang at Living Word Fellowship this past weekend I was so moved by your song wounded that it was so beautiful and such a powerful message it really spoke to me as I'm sure it does to many others as well thank you so much for sharing the word of the of the Lord in your heart with us I wanted to share my testimony of you over my recent miraculous healing from mustastic uh breast cancer of the bone below is a link to a 12-minute video clip of the in testimony and song that I said at a Living Word Fellowship please feel free to download the the video and share this link with everyone that you feel it is uh that will bless the follow-up to the testimony above is that I had an appointment with my doctor after that to discuss the Pet Scan results she said when she read the Pet Scan results she she exclaimed oh thank God I started crying there in the exam room as she said this and I told her how we were thankful for the Lord she said she went through each and every scan herself and told me that I was completely cancer free as I left the exam room we were both laughing and smiling and we and we even exchanged a big hug of Joy this moment so struck me with significance here I was in a Cancer Center full of very sick people and yet I was able to walk out laughing smiling and exchanging hugs of Joy even the nurses and staff in the hallway pause what they were doing to watch this moment I stand completely whole today and testify that only God could do this even the doctor had to declare the work of God Hallelujah this sister's not very old probably in the 30s or 40s I'm not sure but but listen you know look at that breast cancer already Satan trying to do that but but here it's the confession maybe I can send that link and you can watch the whole testimony number six of stinking thinking and I'm closing here hopefully in three or four minutes the magnification or catastrophizing crap you know catastrophe I don't know how to say that word but uh they have a new word called catastrophizing I guess it is here you exaggerate the importance of a problem or assume the worst possible outcome if I fail this test I won't pass the class and I'll flunk out of school so once again it's the negative thinking it's the magnification of something and predicting the future exaggerating thoughts must be corrected exaggerated thoughts must be corrected and brought in Balance can you say Amen imagination can make it real but I say the scripture all things work together for the good that love God and are called according to his prop that's the scripture that you need can you say Amen instead of predicting the future and exaggerating the future say I know whatever happens all things work together for my good number seven of stink and thinking is emotional reasoning and brother Brown taught us the realm of reasoning started in the Garden of Eden this is when negative feelings inform your thoughts without facts to support those thoughts for example you may say I feel like nobody likes me this may be brought on by feelings of loneliness even though you do have friends again you try to examine these things and look at these thoughts as being are they true I feel like nobody likes me do you know brother Branham said that himself he said I get Moody I get in spells and he said the devil tells me I don't have a friend in the world I'm so glad that the prophet was honest about what he felt he admitted his humanness he said I get moody I get spells the devil speaks to me I don't think think of a man now that has all the people he knows in the world and affected in the world and all the ministry people and the devil has this crazy stupid thought you don't have a friend in the world it was a lie but the devil can try to tell us the same thing can you say Amen it's reasoning how you feel does not mean it's the truth feelings cannot be lifted above the word of God emotions a woman gets emotional man gets emotional your emotions can tell you a lot of things but can never be lifted about above the word of God don't let your emotions control you and control your thoughts number eight is should statements think and think and should statements these statements often include words like should must or alt I should always be friendly organized nice Etc should statements can lead to feelings of guilt or like you've already failed at something like brother Henry has a famous statement says I should be an optimist but I doubt if I could be one if only he has that type of humor it's special you know what I should do this I should do that I should do this but it's always the guilt I should have done it this way I should have done it that way you're bringing guilt on yourself it's stinking thinking God doesn't tell you to think like that God loves to see us trying and the word be therefore perfect the father Christ said your father says be therefore perfect means not sinless Perfection but growth to maturity be her perfect I won't do nothing unless I can do it perfect you look I've got I should do it there I should have done it this way you see it's it's being perfect it's growth to maturity growth to production are you trying God loves to see somebody who keeps trying a Son of God falls down but he gets back up one more time then when he falls he said God forgive me I'm going to keep going God wants to look at if you keep trying when you quit trying is when you're in trouble I'm going I'm on my way and to look at that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder number nine is labeling things labeling yourself labeling people uh as the name suggests it assigns labels to ourselves and other people I get so upset with myself when I make a mistake or I feel bad when I let others down and so so you you label let me just say it this way you become a professional at putting people in a certain category and putting you in a certain category I did this so I must be in this category of people it's stinking thinking and I can say this you're more professional at putting other people in categories than you there's pockets in this message that have become professionals at putting people in categories we got all this truth of predestination and whose serpent seed whose predestinated seed and all these other things so we become professionals that we make it a judgment of what category they end we do not know what category they're in the grace of God can save someone who looks like serpency but we in the message become professionals at putting people in a certain category they're an unbeliever they're a make-believer they're this they're a they're a borderline believer and I preach against borderline Believers I preach it up here but I don't have a personal right and you know to put somebody in a category and guess what you don't have a right to put yourself in a certain category the only category I want to put myself into what God said that I am whatever he says I am that's what I am whatever the devil says I am I'm certainly not going to believe that and whatever category God has put me in I'm happy for it and a matter of fact it's like David said those words let my sentence come forth from God it's God that decides who I am on Judgment Day or whatever it is God will decide and I'm happy with whatever God decides to put me in what category in my soul says I'm a predestinated Son of God the word confirms that and vindicates that can you say Amen but listen I'd be happy with whatever if I live my whole life for God and he sent me to hell I'm happy with that I'm happy with that that's what brother Brown said now because listen it's God that chooses the category am I you define Yourself by social media you define Yourself by better looking people than you you know what you're doing you're putting yourself in a certain category they're better looking than me so I am in this category you're defining Yourself by the categories this world splits up Ultra pretty not pretty ugly there's more of them puts you in categories you put yourself in a category but I say to the devil I am fearfully and wonderfully made by a Divine designer this is a scripture several times I brought up with my daughter the last few months and I'm only open about it because she's been open to tell the world to give the devil a black eye but I quoted to Uriah I looked her in the eye you are fearfully and wonderfully made by God that's what the word says you're fearfully and wonderfully made you're made by a Divine designer who made you just the way that you are for a purpose can you say every teenager everyone listen to me you're made the way your ears your nose your mouth you're made the way you are for a purpose I couldn't stand my freckles when I got freckles I had millions of freckles I thought they were the ugliest thing in the face of the earth I had them all over I tried to get my dad to buy me some cream I bought some special expensive cream to get them off and then I put the cream on and slept on it and the next day I had more freckles after the cream I had more of them and when I live in Arizona when I was a kid mom took me dad took me to Arizona in the sun I got more freckles and so when I started to get to know my wife I had two questions do you have the Holy Ghost second question what do you think about freckles I love them that's what she said I love freckles and she was speaking from her heart no you look at all the pictures of some of her boyfriends in school they were redhead and freckles she proved it to me you have the Holy Ghost yes what do you think about freckles I love them I said praise the Lord let's get married it's good enough for me he said God gave me my freckles so my wife could enjoy them and I was so mad at the freckles and God has a purpose even for freckled faced people glory be to God taking too much time tonight number 10 of stinking thinking personalization and blame this is the belief that you're responsible for events outside of your control our team lost because of me it happened because of me events sometimes the force of nature can have something take place and we're going to take the blame for it sometimes God allows something to take place and we're going to take all the blame for it that's stinking thinking if you don't know if you have something you take the blame for but you don't take the blame for for things that you couldn't control can you say Amen take the bling and thinking or or thinking who's to blame trying to find somebody to blame a lot of times people don't blame themselves they blame other people and we're trying to find if something terrible happens who to blame for it I got to find somebody because I feel better about that sometimes there's no answer for it sometimes we won't know who's to blame for it sometimes the force of nature sometimes things happen and it's terrible and we're trying to explain the force of nature but it's the force of Nature and it's stinking thinking though to try to explain it try to take the blame for it and most all of this is just simply negative thought process and guess what friends I'm closing that all of these stinking thinking things all of these thoughts in our cognitive in our mind all of it keeps us defeated all the time but we are not defeated in Jesus Christ we are more than conquerors through Jesus Christ that loved us we are Sons and Daughters of God we are human beings but don't ever let that part dominate your life we are Sons and Daughters of God created in the image of almighty God we're called to defeat the Devil can you say Amen musicians can come can you say man look at this what we're supposed to think about stand together with me if you would Philippians 4 8 and the Amplified finally does the bible tell us what to think about he is invited he he has asked us to invite his thoughts to invade our thoughts every day and to purge our thinking let me say it again I'm going to raise your hand and say I want his thoughts to invade my thoughts and my thoughts to be purged by the word of God every day his thoughts to purge my thoughts for Philippians 4 8 finding Believers whatever is true whatever is Honorable and worthy of respect whatever is right and confirmed by God's word whatever is pure whatever is wholesome whatever's lovely and brings peace whatever is admirable or of good repute if there is any Excellence if there's anything worthy of Praise think continually on these things Center your mind on those things and implant them into your heart not verse 9 the things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things in daily life and The God Who is the source of peace and well-being will be with you I'm going to get all this from God in peace every day by just directing my thoughts think on what's lovely think on what's pure a dirty thought kick it out think on what's pure think on what's wholesome and the God of Peace will fill your hearts daily amen how many has learned through this tonight you got to know who you are oh I know who I am oh oh I know him again oh oh come on let me hear you sing now [Music] oh I know one more time oh [Music] we've been called for to show his excellence all I require for life God has given me and I know who I am for who God says I am what he says I am where he says I'm at
