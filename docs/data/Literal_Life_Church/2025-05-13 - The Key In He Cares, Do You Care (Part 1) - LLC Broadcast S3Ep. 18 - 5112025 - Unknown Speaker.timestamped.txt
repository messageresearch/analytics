[4:56] [Applause]
[4:58] Hallelujah. 1 Peter 5 verse
[5:03] 5-7. And likewise ye younger, submit
[5:07] yourselves unto the elder. Yay, all of
[5:10] you be subject one to another, and be
[5:13] clothed with humility. For God resisteth
[5:17] the proud, and giveth grace to the
[5:20] humble. So, if you're looking for a
[5:23] channel, if you're looking for an inlet,
[5:25] if you're looking for the the basics,
[5:28] the basics of how to move the heart of
[5:30] God and him to move toward you or to
[5:33] move towards your need, it's the first
[5:35] thing they give and that is that he
[5:37] resists the proud. But when there's true
[5:39] humility shown, then you're going in his
[5:42] direction. And when you're going in his
[5:44] direction, he starts coming in your
[5:45] direction. You see how this works then?
[5:47] And there's so that shows us there's
[5:49] certain things, there's certain
[5:51] attitudes, there's certain things that
[5:52] we if we hold on to that, it's it's not
[5:55] going to draw the heart of God. And so
[5:57] we have to be very um mindful of these
[6:00] things. So I love these scriptures
[6:01] because humble yourselves there
[6:03] therefore verse six, humble yourselves
[6:05] therefore under the mighty hand of God.
[6:07] How many believe he's a mighty a mighty
[6:09] God? Yeah. And he's able to step in with
[6:13] his mighty hand. Humble yourselves,
[6:15] therefore, under the mighty hand of God
[6:17] that he may exalt you in due time. All
[6:19] this is about your it's it's about you
[6:22] coming towards him and then him coming
[6:24] toward you. Casting all your care upon
[6:28] him for he carth for you. To be honest
[6:32] with you, as a pastor, I've been on a
[6:34] little bit of a inward journey. It's
[6:36] been an inward journey for me, just me
[6:38] and God. And uh for my own deeper
[6:41] discovery of myself and my life in
[6:44] Christ. Uh and you know, whenever you
[6:46] find more uh of your life in Christ and
[6:50] more of yourself and how the enemy and
[6:52] your weaknesses and study those things,
[6:54] how the enemy uses, whenever you go on
[6:56] that journey, it's real I was in the
[6:58] chiropractor office today and they
[6:59] always do unique things in there and I
[7:02] walk in just to get my back adjusted and
[7:04] the nurse said, "We're we're taking
[7:06] we're saying, "What's the first thought
[7:08] come that come to you this morning?
[7:09] What's a good point to encourage
[7:11] everybody in the office today?" So, what
[7:13] what's your thought today? And we're
[7:14] going to type it in and they'll probably
[7:15] put it on the walls and everything. And
[7:17] so, let me think for a minute. And so I
[7:19] thought I said you I said the journey of
[7:22] the heart is a dangerous one and uh a
[7:25] scary one but it's always worth it.
[7:28] That's what I said
[7:30] and everybody was quiet in the whole
[7:32] office, you know, they're trying to
[7:34] ponder this deep thought from a pastor,
[7:37] you know, but it's the first thing to
[7:38] come to my mind, you know, but I can say
[7:41] personally that I'm I'm kind of on that
[7:43] journey now. And I don't know why we
[7:45] wait so long. Some of us wait too long
[7:46] to do it, but you can be a Christian for
[7:48] years, but you just desire to go deeper.
[7:52] and you just desire that if there's any
[7:54] hindrances and things in my life that
[7:56] I'm holding on to, not talking about sin
[7:58] as such, but things that's in the heart
[8:00] that's unresolved or complexes, whatever
[8:02] they I'm just on a real uh close journey
[8:05] with the Lord with that. And I don't
[8:06] know how long that'll be, but all I know
[8:08] is when we do that, it's more freedom.
[8:11] We can be ourselves more in Christ. And
[8:14] uh and and then I always study these
[8:17] things too so that I can be more
[8:19] equipped as a pastor and a counselor to
[8:22] have more equipped with more discernment
[8:24] to be able to help others because I want
[8:26] to be more effective in helping other
[8:28] people. And so it is it has been and so
[8:31] here's what it was been on my heart and
[8:33] that is this comes from a sermon brother
[8:35] Brand preached. He cares. Do you care?
[8:39] He cares. Do you care? And so, um, I
[8:42] want to just take my time and go slow.
[8:45] That doesn't mean tonight I'll take my
[8:46] time, but I don't know how many more
[8:48] series I'll get into in this, but I just
[8:50] want to just break ground on it tonight
[8:52] a little bit. See, see, maybe if you can
[8:54] join me, and you're welcome, of course,
[8:56] to listen to that sermon and uh, just
[8:59] take it in while we study a little bit.
[9:01] But there's something in here. And when
[9:03] you have a title and a sermon that's
[9:04] called He Cares, Do You Care? I would
[9:07] say that that uh at face value, this
[9:10] seems like a general sermon concerning
[9:12] the heart of God that cares. And it is.
[9:15] And and uh even the title, even the
[9:18] title would draw us all in to maybe want
[9:19] to listen to it or to do that because
[9:22] we're interested in a God who cares. How
[9:24] many is interested in a God who cares?
[9:27] Most of us have been Christians for a
[9:28] long time. So we already basically know
[9:31] that maybe even a surface level, we know
[9:33] God cares. We know there he's a God who
[9:36] cares. But uh and and and that's a
[9:38] wonderful thing. It's and it's it's so
[9:40] you know uh he cares. Do you care? It
[9:43] it's it's something that reminds us that
[9:45] God I like to be reminded that God cares
[9:47] and at a certain level just knowing that
[9:50] he cares can bring comfort to us when we
[9:52] go through a pain and we go through
[9:54] different things in life. Just knowing
[9:56] that he cares. But I just wanted to say
[9:59] tonight, it does not say in this title
[10:00] that just that he cares, but it says he
[10:03] cares. Do you care? That's right. And so
[10:07] there's a little bit more to it than
[10:08] just standing back and saying he cares
[10:11] and I know God cares, but there's
[10:14] another element to it and actually
[10:16] brings us into it. He cares, but do you
[10:19] care? And it I can't help but just think
[10:22] that there's a certain uh uh
[10:24] supernatural thing that begins to work
[10:26] here when you have both sides working.
[10:28] When you have God who cares and is ready
[10:31] and willing to take every situation that
[10:33] he already knows about every pain, every
[10:36] situation, every loss, every sin,
[10:39] everything, every mistake that you made,
[10:41] he's aware of all of it. And he cares
[10:43] for all those things. He cares for for
[10:46] what it is that you're going through
[10:47] tonight. He cares for what you've been
[10:49] through when you were a little child. He
[10:51] has a care. He has an understanding of
[10:53] that. He knows it. And he cares for your
[10:56] heart in that. So there's no question of
[10:58] that. But this title takes it deeper
[11:00] because there's another side to it. He
[11:02] cares. Do you care? It it makes me think
[11:04] that you could have a caring God who
[11:07] cares, but if you have someone who
[11:09] didn't show the fruits that they cared,
[11:12] then it's not going to work.
[11:15] So the complete there's a complete
[11:17] picture and when we say that he just he
[11:20] cares it's not complete without our side
[11:23] being engaged. There's another element
[11:25] to our side that comes in and with our
[11:27] our without our side being engaged then
[11:30] it's not a complete picture. Is I is he
[11:33] still a caring god when men don't care?
[11:36] Is he still a caring god when men don't
[11:39] care? The answer is yes. It doesn't
[11:42] change his caring. He's still a caring
[11:44] God even when men turn their back on
[11:47] him. Even when men backslide, even men
[11:50] win. That didn't take away from the
[11:51] caring God. He's still a caring God.
[11:54] Even when men don't care. Yes. But see,
[11:57] limitations are put on the results when
[12:00] the other side is saying the with words
[12:03] or with actions, I don't care. And I
[12:05] want to emphasize that because people
[12:07] can say with their words that they care
[12:10] about God, about him helping them, but
[12:14] their actions may speak something
[12:16] different.
[12:18] So I want to emphasize that if we're
[12:20] saying with if we're saying with our
[12:22] mouth that we believe God cares and I
[12:24] care that he cares, but we have to show
[12:26] it with our actions. If our actions say
[12:29] I don't care because people can say with
[12:31] their actions, I don't really care. Uh
[12:34] words can say a lot. Uh but Jesus said
[12:37] there are people who honor me with their
[12:40] lips but their heart is far from me.
[12:44] How many remember Jesus saying that? So
[12:46] I don't want to be that way. And there's
[12:49] a quote I want to bring in this series
[12:50] that he said we must get our
[13:00] subconscious is all saying it. But
[13:03] because maybe you're past, there's a
[13:04] bunch of hesitation in your subconscious
[13:07] and it's not really believing. There's a
[13:08] little bit of unbelief. There's lies
[13:10] there. There's scares there. You're
[13:12] afraid to believe because you don't
[13:13] trust completely. So if you've got a
[13:16] subconscious that's not on board, but
[13:18] you got a conscience saying yes, yes,
[13:19] yes. Brother Bram says if we could get
[13:21] believers with their subconscience and
[13:23] conscience lined up with really
[13:26] believing, something's going to happen.
[13:28] And so we have to be a deep people to
[13:30] say Lord if there be any unbelief in me.
[13:32] Wasn't there a man in the Bible says God
[13:34] I believe but help thou my unbelief.
[13:38] You could say well I thought you
[13:40] believed. What about what are you saying
[13:41] about unbelief? He's saying that if
[13:43] there's any unbelief in me Lord help
[13:46] that. Care for that because I can
[13:49] confess what Lord I'm saying. I believe
[13:51] but help my unbelief. Help the areas
[13:54] that are weak. Help anything that the
[13:56] devil is using there to hold me back. My
[13:59] past, my upbringing, my legalistic
[14:02] background, oh God, help me not to let
[14:04] that hold me back from you. The devil
[14:07] can use a lot of stuff to hold people
[14:10] back in their hearts. And yet, they're
[14:12] on board at church. They know this is
[14:13] right. I believe the message. I've been
[14:15] raised this way. But listen, we got to
[14:17] go deeper than that. Amen. So you can
[14:21] never get to the full completion of a
[14:23] God who cares if you got your li as
[14:26] Jesus said your lips honor me your heart
[14:28] is far from me that ain't going to work
[14:30] we want the full completion so there are
[14:32] both sides uh these what happens is both
[14:35] sides are caring for the situation and I
[14:38] say situation there's a need there's a
[14:40] there's a healing that's needed there's
[14:42] a there's something there's a financial
[14:44] need that's needed and so automatically
[14:47] we know God cares right God cares is
[14:49] about to need. But you see now when it
[14:52] works where there's a supernatural
[14:54] connection with both sides caring for
[14:57] the situation. And when that is there,
[14:59] both sides are coming. The potential is
[15:02] there for a supernatural God to step in
[15:05] and not only say that he cares, but
[15:08] actually step into the situation and do
[15:11] something about it. That's what we want
[15:13] to see. That's what we're hungry for.
[15:16] We're hungry for apostolic times to move
[15:18] us again. move among us again. What is
[15:20] that? That's a supernatural God that's
[15:22] actually been released among us. There's
[15:24] nothing holding him up from doing this
[15:26] supernatural work. We need it. Can you
[15:28] say amen? And it's not like I'm going to
[15:30] work it up by the music or work it out
[15:32] by something. No, no, no. We need our
[15:34] faith anchored. We need our hearts
[15:35] anchored. We need to be stable. Can you
[15:37] say amen? In an age of emotional
[15:40] instability, we need to know our place
[15:43] in the word and stand there and say, "I
[15:44] believe this with all my heart. I
[15:46] believe God's going to do this." And so
[15:47] when there's a there's a there's a
[15:49] connection of these two parts that
[15:51] really care, then something supernatural
[15:54] can come in, a point a a meeting point
[15:58] where where a caring God can meet with a
[16:02] heart that cares for help. A heart that
[16:04] that then and when that happens, there's
[16:07] a heart that really cares for help. I'm
[16:09] willing to do what I need to do because
[16:11] I need help. And then you got a caring
[16:13] God when then that meets and we see it
[16:16] all this situation the need is affected
[16:19] by a supernatural God. Some sermons
[16:22] which I believe this he cares do you
[16:25] care is a key and you remember God is
[16:30] wanting to hand the keys of the kingdom
[16:33] to his people
[16:36] because not everybody has the keys. Not
[16:39] everybody has the keys to this church.
[16:40] Not everybody has the keys to my office.
[16:43] Not every, you see, so it's just a
[16:45] select few. And Jesus, you say, well, my
[16:48] goodness, whosoever will will come.
[16:50] Yeah, that's right. He welcomes
[16:51] everyone, but not everybody will receive
[16:54] it. And so he says, it's given unto you
[16:57] to know though the mysteries. Then when
[16:59] he comes to the kingdom covenant, the
[17:01] kingdom comes by the filling of the Holy
[17:02] Ghost. What's the first thing it do? He
[17:04] said, Peter, I've given you the keys to
[17:07] the kingdom. So, it's not just that you
[17:10] have the kingdom in you by the Holy
[17:12] Ghost, but God wants you to give to give
[17:14] you the keys. And when you have the
[17:17] keys, it unlocks
[17:20] more of the kingdom to you.
[17:23] See, you I got a key now. I'll stick it
[17:25] in there. I could have called this the
[17:27] principle. He cares you. I don't want
[17:28] to. The principle is used too much. The
[17:30] principle it's gets too. But when you
[17:32] talk about the key, that's to the
[17:33] children of God. He gives us the keys
[17:36] and you get a little key. It unlock
[17:37] unlocks faith to you. It unlocks more to
[17:39] you, more of where your position is in
[17:42] Christ. And I feel that some sermons are
[17:44] the keys to unlock. And and so this
[17:47] service definitely is because it's the
[17:50] keys to the kingdoms in the hands of the
[17:52] people. This sermon, I believe this
[17:54] service uh of he cares, you hear is not
[17:56] only encouraging, but a key to something
[17:59] for here that we want to look at. He
[18:02] cares. Do you care? So, let's go back to
[18:05] our scriptural base. All right, it's uh
[18:08] I just want to comment on that, not pass
[18:10] it too quickly. 1 Peter chapter 5. As I
[18:13] said, I'm taking this real
[18:15] slow. Chapter
[18:17] 5. 1 Peter chapter 5. And we read verse
[18:21] 5. Likewise, ye younger, submit
[18:24] yourselves unto the elder.
[18:28] All of you be subject one to another and
[18:31] be clothed with humility. This is one of
[18:34] these scriptures here that rarely gets
[18:37] preached on. And I'm going to say too, I
[18:40] don't see a lot of this in the true body
[18:42] of Christ. Still, what don't you see,
[18:46] brother
[18:47] Paul? All of you submit yourself one to
[18:52] another. There's some other scriptures I
[18:55] don't hear preach very much and don't
[18:56] see. Confess your faults one to another
[18:59] in the fear of God. It'll affect your
[19:01] faith when you're praying for the sick.
[19:02] Confess your faults for another to one
[19:04] another. And the effectual fervent
[19:06] prayer of a righteous man availth much.
[19:09] So it's not just your effectual fervent.
[19:10] What makes it more
[19:12] effectual? Confessing our faults. And I
[19:15] rarely see it in the body of Christ. I
[19:18] rarely see that kind of
[19:19] honesty. One brother said there's just
[19:21] not trust. You know, somebody might go
[19:23] tell somebody or whatever. So, so it it
[19:25] it just doesn't happen. There's some
[19:27] other ones. There's some other
[19:28] scriptures that we don't
[19:31] uh you know, see sometimes. Uh I think
[19:34] there's one back there in Peter or John
[19:36] that says, "If there any come among you
[19:39] and bring not this doctrine, receive him
[19:41] not into your house, neither bid him
[19:43] God's speed. For he that bidth him God's
[19:46] speed is a partaker of his evil deeds
[19:48] deeds." just somebody's bringing
[19:49] apostasy that's contrary to what the
[19:52] doctrine that's been brought. Don't even
[19:54] receive them in your home and don't wish
[19:55] them God speed. Don't say God bless you
[19:58] and it's all quiet.
[20:01] These are in your Bible, too.
[20:04] But you don't hear that type of thing
[20:06] preached. And yet, we must be missing a
[20:08] benefit because we need those
[20:10] protections in place. Sometimes there's
[20:12] a s there's one place that says to
[20:14] withdraw yourself from a brother who
[20:16] walks disorderly. goes on to say later,
[20:19] don't treat him like an enemy, but
[20:21] admonish him as a brother. But it
[20:23] actually says to withdraw yourself from
[20:25] a brother who's acting that way for a
[20:26] time. We don't want to hear these
[20:28] things, but you see that they are things
[20:30] that are part of the body of Christ. And
[20:32] this is a scripture I think that we
[20:34] submitting ourselves one to another. I'm
[20:36] going to read it in the amplified verse
[20:37] 5. Likewise, you younger men of lesser
[20:39] rank and experience, be subject to your
[20:41] elders. Seek their counsel. Another
[20:45] thing I don't see very much is the
[20:47] younger seeking the counsel of the
[20:50] elder. But the Bible says to do it. Be
[20:53] subject to your elders. Seek the
[20:54] counsel. And all of you clothe yourself
[20:57] with humility towards one another. Tie
[21:00] on the servants's apron.
[21:06] That's what the Bible says. This is
[21:08] submitting ourselves one to another. It
[21:10] says, "Tie yourself onto your servant's
[21:12] apron." In other words, you find the
[21:14] right thing, you trust, cling on to
[21:15] that. A lot of people in the body of
[21:18] Christ and in this message miss
[21:20] opportunities for the nine spiritual
[21:22] gifts, word of wisdom, these different
[21:24] things. They miss it because they will
[21:26] not uh submit themselves to it, give
[21:30] themselves fellowship to it. So God
[21:32] could speak something through somebody.
[21:35] Oh, I just caught a key there from a
[21:37] member of the body of Christ. I've
[21:38] caught something. They spoke it,
[21:39] brother. You didn't know it, but God
[21:41] spoke through that. Help me cuz I now I
[21:43] know what to go do. We're missing a lot
[21:46] of what God has supplied in the body of
[21:48] Christ because we live too much to an
[21:51] island to ourselves and there's a lot of
[21:54] lack of trust out there and that's why
[21:56] people don't trust anymore. But we
[21:58] cannot start having a lack of trust in
[22:00] what God provides for us.
[22:03] That's Satan's work is to cause us to
[22:05] lack of trust in something that we
[22:07] really need. We can't be an island in
[22:10] the body of Christ. And I'm not forcing
[22:11] you to be friends, but I I'm saying
[22:14] don't miss out on the opportunity of not
[22:16] just the preaching, but what the body
[22:18] provides. Cuz where's Christ today? He's
[22:20] not in the message books. He's not in
[22:22] our Bibles. He's in his people. Christ
[22:25] is in his people. Say, "But they look
[22:28] too flawed and there's too many mistakes
[22:29] and I've got too many mistakes." No, I'm
[22:31] not talking about your mistakes. I'm not
[22:32] talking I'm talking about where Christ
[22:34] is. He's in his people.
[22:37] Don't underestimate when he says,
[22:39] "Submit yourself one to another. Tie
[22:41] onto the servants's apron. For God is
[22:44] opposed to the proud, the disdainful,
[22:46] the presumptuous, and he defeats them,
[22:49] but he gives grace unto the humble." And
[22:51] then the next scripture, he says, verse
[22:52] six, "Humble yourselves therefore under
[22:54] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[22:58] you in due time." So when we realize
[23:01] what the Lord is saying, I want to get
[23:03] back to this. Now, humility will
[23:05] humility will put you forward to God.
[23:08] Pride will put you backwards away from
[23:10] God. Humility says that I really care to
[23:15] get help.
[23:18] Cuz I'm coming broken. I'm coming
[23:20] humbly. Uh even when it comes down to
[23:22] just people admitting that they made
[23:24] mistakes, they can't do it. Can't do it
[23:28] to one another. Sometimes they can't do
[23:29] it to God. I feel so defeated. I can't
[23:31] even go to God with this. But God wants
[23:33] you to come to him. He's welcomed you to
[23:36] come in humility. Well, he don't want to
[23:37] hear what I've got to hear. Listen, he's
[23:39] heard it all. And he actually knows what
[23:41] you did before you even come to him. So,
[23:43] he wants you to humbly come back to him
[23:45] and say, "I need help. I don't want to
[23:47] go to some other source for help. I want
[23:49] to come to you, Lord. I've done this.
[23:50] I've done that." Or maybe it's not
[23:52] something you've done. Maybe I'm in dire
[23:54] need. I'm fighting for my life here and
[23:56] I'm coming humbly before you. I have no
[23:58] other source. But we've got to come
[24:00] humbly. And this is probably a
[24:02] foundational thing is this grace. He
[24:04] says humility will put you forward to
[24:07] God for grace to come to you. All of us
[24:10] want grace to come to us. We want Mr.
[24:12] Grace. We need grace. We need his help.
[24:15] Humble yourselves and that brings you
[24:17] towards him to lift you up. And we say
[24:20] he'll exalt you in due time. Well, it
[24:22] doesn't mean necessarily a position, but
[24:24] he'll lift you up. How many want God to
[24:26] lift you up when you're down in the mud?
[24:29] You want God to lift you up.
[24:31] God, I need help. You know, you you guys
[24:33] all know the the story of the man who
[24:35] was drowning and and he says, "God, help
[24:37] me. God, help me." And this guy comes by
[24:39] with a helicopter and then another guy
[24:41] comes by with a boat and he keeps
[24:43] turning him down cuz he says, "I asked
[24:45] God to help me." And they drown because
[24:47] three times God sends the helicopter,
[24:50] God sends the boat, God sends another
[24:52] person to help him, and he turns I asked
[24:54] God to help me. Listen, humble yourself
[24:56] to the way God is going to help you. Can
[24:58] I get an amen? We don't make an idol out
[25:00] of God and we don't say, "God, I want
[25:02] you to answer and I want you to answer
[25:03] this way." We don't do that. We humbly
[25:06] say, "I need help. However, you can help
[25:08] me, Lord."
[25:10] It's the right entrance. It's the right
[25:11] way to approach God. That's gets rid of
[25:14] pride because pride he won't respond to.
[25:16] But humility puts you in a position
[25:19] he'll lift you up and he'll come towards
[25:21] you. And then at the end of it, he says,
[25:24] and I just want to get that just before
[25:26] we get to the end, may exalt you in due
[25:28] time. There's a process.
[25:32] So now we're coming to to him showing we
[25:36] care, showing, Lord, teach me. Lord,
[25:40] purge me. Lord, I've got a lot of
[25:43] baggage from my past. Lord, I need you
[25:46] to purge me. I need you to clean me. I
[25:48] got I need you to heal me. My heart is
[25:50] so damaged by my past. I need you to
[25:54] heal me. And when you come humbly, he'll
[25:57] do it, but he'll do it in his time. It
[26:01] does not mean that God cares and is
[26:05] caring is endorsing
[26:06] sin. It does not mean that he helps hide
[26:10] things that you're hiding.
[26:13] He doesn't care. Say, "Well, God cares
[26:16] and he helps you hide things that you're
[26:17] hiding."
[26:18] That's not a God who cares. You
[26:21] understand? And so it does not mean that
[26:23] he helps hide things with you. It does
[26:25] not mean that he coddles your feelings
[26:28] or your lack of faith. God cares, but it
[26:32] he doesn't show he cares by just
[26:34] coddling your feelings or coddling your
[26:36] gossip or joining in with your gossip or
[26:39] coddling your lack of faith. He doesn't
[26:41] coddle demon spirits. He doesn't coddle
[26:44] just your feelings because this is the
[26:45] way I'm feeling. It must be the truth.
[26:48] So God, do you care about my feelings?
[26:50] Well, God cares that you have about your
[26:51] feelings, but he doesn't care to coddle
[26:53] your feelings. He will care with
[26:57] understanding, with affection, but he he
[27:01] will care with truth.
[27:05] Always truth. And you should say, "Thank
[27:08] you, Lord, that you'll be truthful."
[27:10] He'll speak the truth in love to you
[27:13] even if it hurts.
[27:15] Because the way he cares, this way we
[27:18] need to care for one another. The way
[27:19] God cares is through affection and
[27:22] understanding and discernment and truth.
[27:26] He will show that he cares not just by
[27:31] standing back and saying the words, "I
[27:34] care for you as a God." God doesn't come
[27:36] all the way back distant from your life
[27:39] and just, you know, fold his arms and
[27:42] say, "I just want to let you all know I
[27:45] care. I really
[27:47] care." That may be how some people do
[27:50] it, but that's not the way God cares.
[27:51] And this is my one of my biggest points
[27:54] tonight. God shows he cares when he
[27:57] steps in and does something about it.
[28:01] He doesn't just say, "I care." but he
[28:04] wants to step into your situation and
[28:06] show his supernatural way to show that
[28:09] he cares for watching our service today.
