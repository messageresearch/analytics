========================================

just take our scriptures tonight to Joshua chapter 1. as we please be on our feet we are reading Joshua chapter one and verse 8 and 9. and then we'll read the first Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16. first let's take Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 and 9. this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate during day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written the ring for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with us forever thou goes now First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16. First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16. for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word amen beloved let's take our seed tonight we are speaking on a topic a short topic of course taking God's way Hallelujah taking God's way the Bible have already made us to understand that there is a way that cement right unto a man but at the end of the that Journey or that way is a way of Destruction Hallelujah so man uses his mind to take away which sometimes is not the will of God one time when Jesus Christ asks the disciples a question and it infiltrated them the Bible said that most of the disciples went back and they didn't work with Christ again that was the time that God was breaking in and you know always the last minute is in which in the third Ministry always separates the believer from the unbeliever it become a junction that the unbeliever don't cross to where the believer is and the believer don't cross also to wear their believer the believer the believer don't cross to the unbeliever and the believer also don't close to the unbeliever because it breaks a barrier a boundary Jesus said where we have reached now in the ministry unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you won't have any life in you some said wow how can we eat your flesh and drink your blood this is the heart saying and return the Bible said that they turn away they did not walk with Christ again and when Jesus try to look around and he saw the twelve that he chose he asked them a question will you also go Hallelujah will you also make your own way will you live my way and create your own Peter look at Jesus it's a master to whom should we go where at all can be better which way should we take you are the only one that have the words of eternal life and Peter stood by saying and he chose God's way oh brother sister you and I agree that we have reached a Time that the spirit that is governing this world now has created so many channels and people many people have found themselves on that way which of course is taking them to destruction Hallelujah loudisha have created a way of indecency La audition of created a way of immorality laodicia have created a way of laziness Hallelujah until until sometimes it want to swallow up some even Christians but brother sister tonight without seriousness I am telling you that the Holy Ghost is not lazy the Holy Ghost cannot be lazy and the Holy Ghost is not lazy therefore if we're Christian and you see Sentiments of laziness in you please check the spirit that is really Hallelujah because we have reached a Time beloved brothers and sisters does something must Shake us something that keep us on the way of God something must bring us back to the channel that God pay for us praise be in the name of our God Hallelujah you take your way by inspiration and by revelation there was one time when Ruth was with Naomi if you remember that story carefully it came to a point now when we realized that he has wasted all his Resources by going to be with them moabites so she need to go back home but then the sons and the husband were all dead this two women decided to go with Naomi now what we said no woman you were my in-laws correct all right I know the way you have loved me I know the way you have cared for me I know the way you have served me but why will you choose to go with me I am old and even if God will be so gracious and giving children again will it be possible for you to wait till they are grown it's impossible so why don't you go back to your people now there were two ways before these two women their way to go back to Moab to worship kamash or the way to go with Naomi to worship the god of the Israelites two weeks Hallelujah which one are you choosing tonight brother Braum said about represented the denomination you know the denomination always behave as if they love Jesus Christ But when reality comes they deny Jesus Christ Hallelujah so when the bible say that oppa reach up to Naomi and he kissed the woman and she went back to worship the idol commercial but look at the woman called Ruth she didn't know Bethlehem she didn't know Israel but by what she had she made a decision to take God's way and she looked at Naomi I said madam and treat me not to return from following thee for where you are going I will go your God will be my God your people shall be my people when you sleep there I will sleep Hallelujah why you die there I will die and where you are buried there I will be buried what kind of inspiration was that what kind of Revelation was that because the woman determined to go God's way she knew that indeed she came up from Ideal Home and now when we have to introduce to her the god of the Israelites which was the only true God so she was determined to go and embrace that God but will she take her own way or she should take God's way that woman took God's way Hallelujah and when they got back to battle him look at what happened they didn't have anything no food to eat no water to drink but God made the way God made the way when they got up in the morning and Naomi told her why don't you go and see if you can get some fields that they are harvesting go and follow the Harvesters the Reapers you get something for us and this woman went on the field beloved if you go God's way God will always guide you God guided Ruth and she found herself on the field of the kinsman redeemer of Naomi unknowingly Hallelujah unknowingly and she started learning from the Harvesters you know she was following them it was not quite long when the man Boaz came and Boaz saw this woman and he asked the workers who is that woman they introduced and we say yeah this is the lady the woman that Naomi brought from MOA say oh is that so is that that woman okay now let me give you instructions concerning her repairs for the sake of that woman whilst you are ripping deliberately leave some of their belly or whatsoever the wheat behind you so that she can get them what was that it was special Grace it was special Grace beloved if you follow God God will always exhibit his grace abundantly on your way and you pick up things you have not even thought of Hallelujah great to put you at the position that you don't have any idea because you have taken God's way amen and amen she went home then the mother said wow why are you so early to come back home he said it was a favor of God another time she went back now bua said woman don't go after the Reapers but come straight to the warehouse [Music] God elevated her amen God promoted her now she was not going to follow their Reapers but she went straight to the warehouse and Boaz measured six measures of belly or wheat and give to this woman oh brother there is a revelation there why sex and not seven Hallelujah we believe that the number six is always the number of man but when you're talking about the number seven is the revelation of God hallelujah God always be in a servant but was became the seventh belly for the roots Hallelujah brother if you take God's way God knows how to deal with you now let's read back Joshua the chapter one amen now listen if God wants you to take his way he prepare himself for you and he makes sure that you go by his weight now that's why he said now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of none Moses Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river who frites all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your Coast that shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and that is where the Blessed Assurance is there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee not forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto these people who shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them verse 7. only be down strong and very courageous that thou Mayors observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee then not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with us over thou goest so it means if you take God's way there's Prosperity ahead of you if you take God's way there's liberty ahead of you if you take God's word there is healing and there's everything that you can think of Hallelujah they're saying detect this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein not some but all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good sources have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with the surviva thou goes Hallelujah without server thou goeth meaning if you take God's way you are not going to go alone if you take God's way there's no danger if you take God's way there's not going to be any hindrance and obstacle on your way if you take God's way everything is going to be well with you praise the name of our God and when root took that we all know what happened to her Hallelujah eventually when Naomi was redeemed Ruth got the opportunity to marry Boaz isn't it wonderful if he chose her own way and go back to the moabites and worship what do you think would have happened to her but because she took us away Hallelujah and we don't just take God's way and think that we can use our own thinking or our own minds to do whatever we want to do no brother no sister the Bible said that we should let the mind of Christ be in US and when we have the mind of Christ within us then we can pay God's way and do according to his word he told Joshua he said meditate upon the word now you when you say you were a message believer that is not enough Hallelujah you cannot just say you are just a message believer and thus ends no what makes you a message believer because you know the message and you feed on the message you abide by the message and you act upon the message what the message say you should do that is what you do he said meditate upon it day and night Hallelujah do we do that oh brother let's equate this scripture with Deuteronomy chapter 11 quickly Deuteronomy chapter 11. Deuteronomy 11 let me tackle from verse 13. oh sorry yeah verse 30 and it shall come to pass if ye shall hear can diligently unto my commandment which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ah that I will give you the reign of your land in his dual season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest Gather in thy con and thy wine and thine oil and I will send grass in the fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceived and yet turned aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lord's Rock be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not a fruit unless he perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord gaveth you therefore shall ye lay up this my words in your hearts and this is why I wanted to take a very big note therefore shall you lay up this my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that there may be as frontless between your eyes verse 19 and here shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou seated in thy house and when thou worketh by the way when thou lies down and when thou Rises up Hallelujah the prophet said that when you read the scriptures when you read the Bible you say wherever you read it put yourself in there so now we don't have Old Testament and we don't have New Testament we have our current Testament Hallelujah every part of the Bible is working in our lives amen we have current Testament there is no expiry date of the word of God he says we should abide by the word and we should teach them our children speaking of them when thou seated in thy house and when thou workers by the way and when thou Liars down and when thou Rises up see ourselves and teach our children Hallelujah we have to teach our children and teach our children thank God that we have the Sunday School in the church and we are doing exactly what the Bible tells us but today what do we see most of the time we don't even have time to take the Bible we don't even have time to take the message books and check certain things and read certain things but rather we take ah what do we call it ah YouTube and we take uh uh Twitter and we take uh Instagram and we take which is the other one you can name them alone that is what we take and rather we waste time so much on it oh yes say brother we do business on yes I know that you do business on it is that all is that all you can do on it there are a lot of things people are doing on the internet Hallelujah but what about the others that waste your time the time of you taking the word of God into your heart the time that you have to tell the word of God and teach somebody you don't have time for that but you have all that time on the media which does not help you in any way that doesn't help you in any way praise be the name of our God my brother my sister the business that we are doing with God is very serious business that nobody should joke with that brother we are living in a very deceptive age that people are thinking that is just a matter of saying oh I am a Christian no there is more to that there is more than that brother sister and the more that you have to do is to make sure that you are in the word of God you are on God's way you are meditating upon the word of God day and night he said when you sit you must talk about it when you sleep you must talk about it when you get up you must talk about it teach your children Hallelujah amen wrote stood as a firm woman she did not care about the condition she did not care about whatever was surrounding her she said no I am taking God's way I am taking God's way and cannot imagine a woman and a a gentle woman talking about where Naomi will die and where she'll be buried do you know why she caught the revelation of the burial of Jesus Christ and the resurrection of Jesus Christ she knew by Revelation that there is going to be Resurrection and we're down from that time she was prophesying about that yes because Abraham bought machipella and buried his wife Sarah he himself was buried there the Patricks were buried there Hallelujah why because they know that there is going to be Resurrection and today our machipella is Jesus Christ but look at that time the distance this woman called the revelation that there will be Resurrection so she was thinking about when a woman is going to be buried she wants to be buried there oh brother sister it was because she took God's way and tonight if you take God's way brother you will never regret if you take God's way you will see the power and the hand of God in your life if you take God's way you see what God has prepared for you you will not take God's way and regret when Joshua took God's way and that then when he was going to fight a malachite remember on his way he met a man standing in the way with their son drawn and God the Bible have already told Joshua God I've already told you to be bold and of good courage he was not scared but Joshua was so bold and he asked the man are you for us or you were against us and the man said I am the captain of the host of Israel then Joshua understood that he has met the angel of the Lord and he bowed down and worshiped my own brother he took God's way and God must be with him as you take God's way God will also be with you amen now listen to what prophet said here he said footsteps is a victory as he told Joshua everywhere the soul of your food will Trot I will give it to you footsteps becomes your Victory brother and sister and I tell you today let us throat on the lungs that God gave to us Divine healing powers of God everything now coming into Christ is like going down into a big arcade down here there are variety stores just think in a variety store the size of this Tabernacle yes sir I look all around there is everything in there the shelves are full of nice pretty things and everything that I like they are all mine oh brother every one of them belongs to me I can go over and take what I want to why because you have taken God's way and every precious thing in Jesus belongs to you that is what the prophet was referring to Hallelujah he said everything belongs to me I can go over and take whatever I want and people did the same thing in the Bible because they believe on the Lord Jesus Christ they were able to go to Jesus and take what belongs to them remember the Centurion when he went to see Jesus he said Master will you come and pray for my servant and when Jesus decided to go he said no master there is not even no need to for you to come under my roof I'm a I'm a man of authority I have servants under me I command them go and they go come and they come so just speak the word Hallelujah Jesus look at the man he said wow what a fake whatever let it be according to what you have said and immediately a servant was healed what about the other woman the woman with the infirmity for 12 years ah they have been told not to go to the crusade of Jesus Christ therefore I see the disease have polluted their minds they have discouraged everyone to go for Jesus but my brother will you go that way will you allow somebody to pollute your mind concerning the word of God the woman said no she got to the Crusade grounds and he said let me take this man and touches him when I touch his hand I am sure I will make whole and can we imagine she took that way and touched him of the Garment of Jesus and for the first time Jesus complained that somebody have touched him he said Peter somebody have touched me Peter said oh Master when we're coming by the way there have been a lot of people that have touched you why do you say this Jesus said well I know Peter a lot of people have touched me but all those touches were touches of ordinary touches but this particular touch is a touch of Revelation it was a touch of Faith because virtue has gone out of me when Jesus Christ was complaining then the woman owner the master is I it's a woman your faith has made you free and today he's the same yesterday today and forever that power has not changed if only we can reach him and touch His Garment everything will be made possible in our lives We Don't Preach Jesus of History we don't pray Jesus our future but we pray Jesus of current Jesus of today is what we are preaching he is the same yesterday today and forever beloved brothers and sisters Hallelujah and Christ is of the right to store but our spirit we are all baptized into one big variety storm amen anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing I will take it if you need joy you must take it if you need Victory you must take it hallelujah it's all hanging around in God's big shop when you go to Walmart right now there are a lot of things is it do you go and take all do you go and buy all you have something that you need and when you go you pick them you pick them you pick them when you are satisfied you go to the cashier and then you go and pay but with this shop we are talking about the shop that is Jesus Christ everything is already paid you only go and take what you want Hallelujah you only play God's play God's way and take what you want oh brother I can't imagine I can't imagine that even an animal a creature like opossum think of itself that she needed healing when it was wounded oh what made that creature to crawl and cross all the highways and lay down at the doorstep of the prophet what made that Hallelujah think about it brother if a creature like the opposal can even do that how much more you and I that Christ have died and shed his blood and washes from our sins and has made the sense of his what can't he do for us the prophet said there are a lot of things in there let's go get what belongs to us let's go and take what belongs to us because if you take God's way brother says that there is no nothing like Danger there's nothing like Danger there's nothing like like disappointment there can never be something like like frustration no because you have taken God's way the prophet look at the creature he did not understand himself and he was even talking to the creature that if you don't live here I will kill you and eat you Hallelujah but then after going back to his room and come back he realized that there's something wrong the spirit of God told him that that creature need your help and when you look around it was full of wounds and he removed his heart and nails and prayed oh Lord if this is the reason why this creature is here do it for it immediately this scripture God is healing and look at the way it even thank God for the healing bowing his head down three times before the prophet and then slip back to the bush it is God that made it possible and if God made it possible for the mama opposom he can make it possible for you also tonight he can make it possible in your life if only you continue to go God's way amen Hallelujah he says and Christ is our Authority store by one Spirit we are all baptized into one big variety so amen anything you have need of you go for it he will supply it Amen brother you talk let take he said we need healing there it is starting there for you just reach over and get it you might you might have to kick over a few things here to get to it push through a few things to get to it but go ahead and take it you are on God's way you might have to get a ladder and reach up for it but God has got a ladder there for you oh I am happy this moment thy Lord have put a ladder in the Lord Jesus Christ for us you see when you go to the shop indeed there are some things that are on the shelves you need to climb something before you grab it when you come to Jesus all those goodies that are on the shelves you need a ladder to climb but thank God the ladder in Jesus is Jesus Christ himself that you have to climb him in his word and reach to whatever your desires are and you can take it for yourself amen and amen oh Hallelujah brother my sister tonight I won't take too much of your time but there is one thing I want you to understand that when you take God's way God's angels guides you when you think God's way I say God's angels guides you God protects you God delivers you from all troubles Hallelujah problems are no longer problems amen like the prophet was saying that when Joseph was told by the angel to take Mary and the child and go back to Egypt on a little donkey he said there were robbers on the way but because God was with them there was no danger Hallelujah and tonight just be reminded I am reminding you that if you take God's way also oh brother sister there is no danger on the way for you amen like David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to like to lie down in Green's Patches he leaded me beside Still Waters God leads me so is God's leadership not mass leadership Hallelujah don't let man create aware channel for you let God create a channel for you and pass it on and you will succeed in all that you do if you go God's way he will never leave you he will be with you he said behold I am with you all day so even the end of time what a Blessed assurance brother and sister it is time for us to assess ourselves are we on God's way are we going according to God's plan or the system have sway us are we living in complacency amen like those virgins they have the man to go and meet the bridegroom but they were living complacency Hallelujah when the blood group the day he signed they all slept but when the time came and they heard the sound the bridegroom is coming the bridegroom is coming those who were not complacency but they were serious about their confession they pick up the alarms they trim it and they moved Hallelujah to meet their bridegroom but those who live with complex they thought that everything was okay oh that is all right I'm a virgin I'm eating the bridegroom they realize that not knowing they didn't even have oil in the alarms they have to go and ask for those who have but I like the answer they give to them he said no my Holy Ghost is for me alone I cannot share my Holy Ghost with you if you want the Holy Ghost go to those who sell and the one that's not the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ it doesn't even sell it to give it free if only you can come who were having the oil in the alarms the bridegroom came and they went with him I don't want you to live in complacency I don't want you to live and think that you are okay no other let's stream our alarms let's trim our arms again let us make sure that our lumps are burning on the way that God has paid for us because beloved this world has nothing to offer the problems are going to be problems and are going to be problems and more are going to come the only thing we need to do is to make sure that we are working on God's way brother let me give you a testimony before perhaps I close this evening to give way for the next program there's a sister in the church uh on the 28th if uh February I was not around I travel for Missions and their sister left home but when she came by the roadside there was one taxi person so he has to stop this car and when she stopped the car there is he she realized that there were three men sitting at the back seat so the front was empty so she sat at the front now the moment she banged the door then one of the men at the back said we've got one meat I don't know which meat she was referring to whether goat or cattle or I don't know but what happened was that the system realized that they were kidnappers that is why that man made that statement we've got one meat so immediately the sister said driver please I'll get down the driver didn't budge and the sister said again brother I want to get that place the driver still drove the car away and she said the touch High and the driver said you just boarded the car why do you want to get down and the sister said no ah I have left something at home I want to go and get it he said no I'm not going to stop so the driver drove the car beloved after a distance they came to meet three men standing by the roadside and one of the men stopped the car and dead at rubber storm then the man asked the driver I have heard the voice of this lady from far that she want to get down why are you not stopping the car so at that time the sister got opportunity to open the door and she got down and she banged the door after banking the door she was telling to say thank you to the man and there was nobody behind her so the sister came and told me he said pastor this what ah I said sister go to the church and go and tell the church what God have done for you Hallelujah and brother this took me straight to the time of Abraham when Abraham was looking for a child and the Lord God came down with two angels Hallelujah remember that they were three but in the tree it was one that spoke and when he spoke he didn't say that we he said I according through the time of life a year by this time I will visit you and your wife Sarah will bring forth I personal pronoun and that is exactly that happened in the life of sister Dorcas these were three men standing but one spoke he said I have heard the voice of this lady from afar she want to get down from your car why are you not stopping brother God is not far from us sister I am assuring you that God is not far from you he is always with us he is closer than we can even think of the only thing we need to do is to make sure that we are always working on God's way he will never leave us if you see things that things are not going the way you think things are not coming the way you expect do not be discouraged I always say that the time that you see that there are problems here and there coming your way that is the time that God is talking about you that is the time that God is thinking about you remember it was the same thing in the life of job job was living a perfect life I mean a holy life a glorious life that was no problem by the time that God spoke about job then something happened but job did not leave his faith job did not denounce God job kept working on God's way so anything that comes your way brother sister remember God is talking about you have you seen my servant Tom have you seen my servant Josiah have you seen my seven Boaz have you seen my my lady Sherry oh have you seen my lady Sharon Hallelujah have you seen myself yes that is the time that perhaps I'm not saying always I said perhaps God have decided to testify about your faith why then will you disgrace God no brother anything that will go through let us stand firm let us stand firm and know that he knows everything about us let us always go God's way God bless all of you I pray that the Lord will shine his glorious message upon you he will lift you up in the faith that that day when all the saints will be changed your body also will be changed as you walk on his way God bless all of us let's bow down our heads oh Lord these few words oh God that you lay upon my heart is what I've shared with your children now you pitch us with your blood before the foundation of the world father you always want that everyone should be careful the way he treats this little ones because their annuals are beholding your face all the time father I pray perhaps I didn't put it the way you wanted me to do but you know to do it best therefore ask your word have comfort let it have way in the life of your people help us oh Lord Jesus to meditate upon it day and night help us to enable us teach our children also as we sleep as we walk wherever we find ourselves we pray that your presence will go with us may we be on your way oh Lord and help us not to miss it we thank you let your blessings be upon your children let your healing be upon your children let your deliverance be upon your children and we are looking unto thee The Altar and finish of our faith for that glorious day thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless all of you
