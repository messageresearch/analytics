[0:00] to read that text again finish a few
[0:02] things from last Sunday I wanted to say
[0:04] that we lost Sister Janice green and she
[0:08] was a the wife brother Perry green and
[0:12] she was just as brother Perry was a
[0:15] mentor to me especil to me in my early
[0:17] years 16 year old boy brother Perry gave
[0:20] me my first car when I was in Tucson and
[0:22] we went to the school there and did
[0:24] different things but she was very
[0:25] special to me as well she was a music
[0:27] lover a wonderful piano player and
[0:29] singer and was a mentor in the music
[0:31] field for me and I appreciate her so
[0:34] much I don't think I'll be able to
[0:36] attend the funeral but hopefully we can
[0:37] watch it online and I just want to say
[0:40] how much I appreciate the people that
[0:42] God's put in my life and Sister Janice
[0:44] was certainly one of them she was a
[0:46] lovely 89 I believe she was and we will
[0:49] miss her as a part of the body of Christ
[0:50] here and her singing her anointed
[0:53] singing she taught us to sing with
[0:54] anointing and sing and pray for the
[0:57] anointing to come when you sing and
[0:59] that's a great I was a great mentor to
[1:01] our family they supported us when we
[1:03] first went out there in Tucson and oh I
[1:05] can't remember what year that was Mom we
[1:07] first sang there at the convention
[1:08] brother Perry asked us to sing and we
[1:10] sang a song Thank you Lord for your
[1:12] blessings on me I think I was I don't
[1:15] know 14 maybe younger I don't know and
[1:18] uh that was before Sherry come along
[1:19] Sherry was born in Tucson actually later
[1:21] on and so there was singing going on
[1:24] before Sherry in the LaFontaine Family I
[1:27] always remind her of that but
[1:29] he asked us to sing in the convention
[1:31] and back then it was cassettes and those
[1:33] cassettes went around the world from
[1:35] that convention and then our invitations
[1:37] began to come in to come and sing and
[1:39] dad to minister and that's what kind of
[1:41] began the music Ministry but also dad's
[1:44] Ministry and we traveled the next I
[1:47] don't know 10 years of my life we
[1:48] traveled but it's because where the
[1:50] period asked us to sing there and really
[1:51] heavily anointed the song and it went
[1:53] out and was a blessing to people so we
[1:56] thank God for that and we appreciate
[1:58] Sister Janice green we pray God will
[2:00] comfort her family today I know most of
[2:02] you didn't know her but we like to honor
[2:04] those who have gone on to their reward
[2:06] and know that we're looking forward to
[2:08] seeing them on the other side amen
[2:10] psalms 27 again and we'll just pick it
[2:14] up here I want to I do want to pick up
[2:16] verse three because I'll be talking
[2:17] about that a little bit though and a
[2:20] host should encamp against me my heart
[2:22] shall not fear the war should rise
[2:25] against me and this will I be confident
[2:27] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[2:29] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[2:32] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[2:34] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:36] and to inquire in his Temple every day
[2:40] he wanted to dwell in the dwelling place
[2:42] of the Lord and that was his one desire
[2:44] above money above riches above business
[2:47] above anything we need one main desire
[2:50] and that's to stay in the presence of
[2:52] the Lord
[2:53] for in the time of trouble now to me
[2:56] this is a prophetic scripture for our
[3:00] time and we know that in the history of
[3:03] Israel God's people Israel the Jews we
[3:06] know they they come to times of extreme
[3:08] trouble time of trouble Daniel speaks of
[3:11] a time of trouble for the children of
[3:12] Israel and uh so we we realize that will
[3:16] begin to climax towards we get to it
[3:20] getting to end time events the trouble
[3:22] will be that the whole world will
[3:24] surround Israel and come against Israel
[3:26] and the whole and armies will surround
[3:28] so now when when David says he's feeling
[3:31] that there's armies encamped about me
[3:34] Israel will go through the same thing in
[3:36] Prophecy that they'll be encamped or the
[3:38] enemy will be encamped around we
[3:40] spiritually go through what Israel will
[3:42] go through literally and so then he says
[3:45] one thing I ever desire the Lord and
[3:46] then he says in the time of trouble
[3:48] verse 5 for in the time of trouble he
[3:51] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[3:53] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[3:55] me he shall set me up upon a rock that's
[3:58] that has a lot of Revelation in it to
[4:01] tell us where this is at number one it's
[4:03] the secret of his Tabernacle it's not
[4:05] out there publicly openly it'll be a
[4:07] secret as to where God's dwelling place
[4:09] is but for the people of God he will
[4:12] show them where he is so that they can
[4:14] live in his presence
[4:16] this last part I want to go he shall set
[4:18] me up upon a rock how many know in the
[4:21] Bible that rock means revelation
[4:24] so what do we what what is our secret
[4:26] place it's really the Revelation that
[4:28] God has given us and you know you can't
[4:30] give yourself a revelation it comes
[4:33] directly he told Peter he says flesh and
[4:35] blood has not revealed this you didn't
[4:37] learn it in seminary my father has given
[4:39] you this Revelation Satan kept getting
[4:42] can't get his grubby mitts on it but
[4:44] when he gives you a revelation it
[4:46] becomes the hiding place and it becomes
[4:49] the stability
[4:50] can you say amen and now shall mine head
[4:54] be lifted up above my enemies around
[4:56] about me therefore will I offer in his
[4:59] Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing
[5:02] you know what a Believer does when he's
[5:04] surrounded by demon power he raises his
[5:08] hands his head's lifted above all of it
[5:10] and he just starts to praise the Lord
[5:13] and then the devil gets more mad
[5:15] can you say man I'm so glad in my trials
[5:18] and troubles I can lift my hands and
[5:20] give a song to the Lord
[5:22] amen praise the Lord I will sing yeah I
[5:25] will sing praises unto the Lord father
[5:27] blessed and anoint and strengthen Us in
[5:29] the word of God today we stand feeble
[5:32] without your help Lord and we stand weak
[5:34] without your strength to live and to
[5:36] preach and to and to minister Lord your
[5:39] love and to be a witness we're we're
[5:41] nothing without you and we thank you for
[5:44] the children who's ministered to the
[5:45] fathers today to give them an
[5:47] encouragement I pray for every father
[5:49] here and every father that's living
[5:50] listening Lord that you will give them
[5:53] an encouragement in their heart they've
[5:55] went through sacrifices Lord for the
[5:57] family and for the sake of the gospel
[6:00] and they they do things many many things
[6:02] every day that the children maybe don't
[6:05] see but today may they feel appreciated
[6:07] and Loud father and as you look down as
[6:10] the heavenly father you look at the
[6:12] fathers here and you can see the quiet
[6:14] sacrifices they're making to support
[6:16] their family to to bring bread on the
[6:19] table to administer correction when it's
[6:22] needed in love to administer
[6:24] encouragement when it's needed and to
[6:26] find those teachable moments that only a
[6:28] father seems like can give and to seize
[6:31] those teachable moments I'm so thankful
[6:33] for that I'm thankful for my Earthly
[6:35] father that I had but I'm also
[6:37] especially thankful for my heavenly
[6:39] father that has taken those teachable
[6:41] moments and taught me everything Lord
[6:44] that I have today we pray you'll Bless
[6:46] the people of God around the world as
[6:48] they gather today and feed on your word
[6:50] may you continue and Advance the Bride
[6:52] of Jesus Christ in the word and in the
[6:55] Revelation and in rapturing faith as we
[6:58] commit this service and this day to you
[7:01] in Jesus name we ask him amen
[7:04] praise the Lord God bless you you may be
[7:06] seated
[7:09] I want to title this today hide me in
[7:11] the safe place of Revelation hide me in
[7:14] the safe place of Revelation
[7:17] while the bride is called into a
[7:20] revelation for the Rapture and that's
[7:22] what we were saying last Sunday that
[7:24] it's actually a revelation of the
[7:26] Rapture is a revelation and this is the
[7:29] scripture that the prophet used to
[7:32] describe the Rapture time and it's a
[7:35] strange text but yet it has the mystery
[7:37] of rapture within there because just
[7:39] before our deliverance just before our
[7:42] ultimate deliverance we realize that the
[7:45] increased pressure the armies gathered
[7:48] around us the pressure will not decrease
[7:50] but it will increase so much so that
[7:53] sometimes mentally we don't know if we
[7:55] can handle it the only cry that we can
[7:58] cry is what David said hide me in your
[8:01] secret place during this time and I
[8:03] believe that's the the place that you're
[8:05] living in that develops this rapturing
[8:08] Faith builds this rapturing Faith but we
[8:10] know there's great pressure on the
[8:11] outside how many can say Amen there's
[8:13] great pressure on the outside the heat
[8:16] has been turned up on the Bride Can you
[8:17] say
[8:20] it's in such an increased State that's
[8:23] hard to Fathom how much more pressure
[8:26] can come and I just wanted to say this
[8:28] that if that pressure is too much for
[8:31] you and you want that pressure off of
[8:33] you then just stop standing up for the
[8:36] right things
[8:39] if you know if you can't handle the
[8:41] pressure of this hour then just stop
[8:43] standing for things because a lot of
[8:45] your pressure is because you're standing
[8:47] up for something you're standing for the
[8:50] message of the hour
[8:51] I'm going to elaborate on that a little
[8:54] bit later but but if you if you don't
[8:56] like the pressure stop him stop living a
[8:58] holy life
[9:01] I want to say that it's the one standing
[9:04] on Revelation that are being surrounded
[9:06] and encamped by demons
[9:10] the ones that are experiencing criticism
[9:12] heavy criticism is probably the ones
[9:15] that are making a stand and if you want
[9:17] an easy life without a lot of demons
[9:19] against you then just be a borderline
[9:21] believer today because there's a lot
[9:23] less pressure on a borderline believer
[9:25] but when a Believer makes a stand for
[9:28] the truth and wants to live in Holiness
[9:30] and live in sanctification instead I
[9:33] believe this message with all my heart
[9:34] get ready for more pressure
[9:37] it's the ones that are making a stand
[9:39] that get more criticism and if you can't
[9:41] take the heat stay out of the kitchen
[9:44] Bridge
[9:46] yeah you can release a lot of pressure
[9:48] can you say man you can get out of a lot
[9:50] of this if you don't make a stand for
[9:51] anything and you can you know you can be
[9:54] out of a lot of it matter of fact you
[9:56] can there's choices you can make to just
[9:58] to release a lot of pressure in your
[10:00] life and just kind of take the normal uh
[10:02] status of this world or maybe a
[10:04] borderline believer it'd be a lot less
[10:06] pressure than this but once you begin to
[10:08] stand once you begin to articulate and
[10:11] speak this message and speak what you
[10:13] believe whatever environment it is if
[10:15] you do that get ready for more pressure
[10:17] and it's not people as much as it is
[10:20] demons don't like somebody to make a
[10:22] stand
[10:24] amen so you know and and you got to take
[10:27] a stand for things you think that the
[10:29] trouble in this world is the economy or
[10:31] you think the trouble is the scare of
[10:33] War uh you think your trouble is you
[10:35] don't have enough money to meet your
[10:36] bills this week you think that's my
[10:38] trouble I don't have enough money that's
[10:40] not really your trouble when the Bible
[10:42] says it's a time of trouble it's not
[10:44] it's not that you can't meet your bills
[10:46] this week it's a much deeper trouble
[10:48] than that
[10:50] and I'm not belittling that trouble in
[10:52] your life we all have trouble but the
[10:54] trouble the Bible speaking of is not
[10:55] just that some friend forsake you or or
[10:57] you don't have enough money or you lost
[11:00] your job your trouble as standing for a
[11:03] Believer your trouble is a lot deeper
[11:05] than that David was talking about a much
[11:07] deeper trouble
[11:08] Army's encamped around him everything
[11:11] against him can you say amen and so the
[11:14] the scare of war and money trouble your
[11:17] trouble is not really that it's much
[11:18] deeper than that and last Sunday we left
[11:21] off with uh the uh the scary experience
[11:24] of a demon-possessed man coming against
[11:26] brother Branham and coming against the
[11:29] man of God and uh so I I don't have time
[11:32] to read all that but I made a point out
[11:34] of that as he came up to the platform
[11:36] broke up the services everybody got
[11:38] afraid preachers were running from the
[11:40] platform this happened back in Portland
[11:41] Oregon uh many many years ago and so he
[11:44] was demon-possessed he was a man that
[11:46] was just uh needed the Lord and so he
[11:49] come against the man of God just broken
[11:51] the jaw of a Preacher a few weeks before
[11:52] had come out of the insane Institution
[11:54] for some reason his direction for his
[11:56] persecution was against preachers
[11:58] probably grew up and some preacher heard
[12:00] him I don't know what happened but his
[12:01] he was zeroing in on preachers and so he
[12:04] broke a preacher's jaw and and was put
[12:07] back in the end then now he gets out
[12:08] again and he's interrupting this whole
[12:10] big meeting with about five or six
[12:12] thousand people there Everybody's scared
[12:14] everything but he's directing he's
[12:16] coming right up to the platform he's
[12:17] threatening and you know the story I'll
[12:19] break every bone in your body and this
[12:21] is a big man brother Brandon was a small
[12:22] man it was a very intense situation and
[12:26] we know the story how how that he stood
[12:28] there and stood firm and he says Divine
[12:30] love came over him and he loved the man
[12:32] he told the security guards not to get
[12:34] him he would he would just deal with it
[12:36] he wasn't afraid he's only probably the
[12:38] only person in the building that wasn't
[12:39] afraid of this demon power because there
[12:42] has to be something greater than us to
[12:44] not be afraid and that's Divine love
[12:47] that's the Holy Ghost Divine love for
[12:50] these situations of demon power it takes
[12:52] more than your strength to handle it it
[12:54] takes the Holy Ghost Divine love to
[12:56] respond can I get an amen this morning
[12:59] and that's what he said something come
[13:01] over him and he says I wish I could have
[13:03] that all the time but he stood
[13:04] flat-footed and that man kept throwing
[13:06] and come up hawked in his throat spit in
[13:08] his face two or three times
[13:11] um
[13:12] and they said later on I I think I
[13:14] missed this last Sunday they said later
[13:15] on after he was prayed for and delivered
[13:18] he says well he is he completely
[13:20] delivered is he healed he said no he'll
[13:22] he'll take that Spirit back again
[13:24] because he worships that spirit
[13:27] so that's a temporary Deliverance in the
[13:30] presence of God which I how much I
[13:32] wonder how much that happens today
[13:34] temporary Deliverance
[13:37] we don't want that we want complete
[13:39] deliverance
[13:41] but one of the points I was making last
[13:44] Sunday is and I'll go back here in my
[13:45] notes and read it just the way he said
[13:47] it he said and he rushed up towards me
[13:49] and he hawked down in his throat and
[13:51] spit right in my face I'll show that
[13:54] you're not a true man of God I'll break
[13:56] every bone in your body and one comment
[13:59] really reminisce it and see the devil
[14:00] was trying to get me to shake away from
[14:04] the atmosphere from that atmosphere that
[14:07] God was getting me in
[14:10] but it didn't bother me
[14:12] so I thought I'd read that again because
[14:14] the point that I was making besides all
[14:16] this demon power all over the building
[14:17] and coming against brother Branham which
[14:19] is what we Face a lot of times besides
[14:22] that it's not just that it would make
[14:24] accusations and and come against the man
[14:27] of God and threaten the man of God it's
[14:28] not just that Spirits sometimes have a
[14:31] desire to pull you down to pull you out
[14:34] of praise and worship to pull you out of
[14:37] where you want to live can you say Amen
[14:39] you're wanting to live in his presence
[14:40] you're wanting to live in his Joy Cal
[14:43] repurchase Joy so you're wanting to take
[14:45] that possession Cal repurchase peace for
[14:47] you and you're wanting to hold on to
[14:49] that peace there'll be efforts to try to
[14:51] pull you out of that atmosphere
[14:53] and as I mentioned the homosexual agenda
[14:55] is not just to go off and live that they
[14:57] wait the way they live they want us to
[14:59] accept them they want your children they
[15:01] want to influence can you say amen
[15:03] that's demon power it's not good enough
[15:05] just to persecute and bring accusations
[15:08] but they want to draw you into their
[15:11] world
[15:14] and incidentally let me mention that the
[15:16] scripture is very strong about an
[15:17] accusation against an elder
[15:20] you can look it up but when we when we
[15:23] have things uh being presented this way
[15:26] then we must realize the scary
[15:28] experience that it's one thing to have
[15:32] armies and capped about you let me just
[15:35] ask how many's felt that before
[15:38] just just in Camp David describes it you
[15:41] know it's it's it's everywhere
[15:43] everywhere I turn it just seems like
[15:44] there's things all the way around you
[15:47] it's one thing to have that pressure but
[15:49] it's another thing when they want to
[15:51] drag you down when they want to pull you
[15:53] in with them they want to draw you into
[15:55] the same fear that they're under they
[15:57] want to draw you into the same scare
[15:59] that they're under the same nervousness
[16:01] they want to draw you into the same
[16:03] gossip that they're partaking of
[16:06] the devil likes company so the devil
[16:09] wants to draw you into the same gossip
[16:11] they feel better if someone else will
[16:13] join in the gossip with them so that
[16:15] it's not good enough to gossip but it's
[16:17] they want to draw you in with the gossip
[16:19] they want to draw you into their opinion
[16:21] because they need allies they want to
[16:23] draw you down to their lies that they're
[16:25] telling they want to draw you to their
[16:27] concrete conclusions that may not be
[16:29] based in truth can I get an amen this
[16:31] morning it's it's it's an effort to
[16:34] bring you down and bring you into their
[16:36] Dimension and their realm and they want
[16:38] a war with you sometimes they want to
[16:40] battle they want to have a good scrap
[16:42] I've said it before there are people in
[16:45] life that they just like a good scrap
[16:47] every day
[16:48] and it doesn't matter who is around I
[16:52] live for a good scrap can you be the
[16:54] person please sister dong to scrap with
[16:57] me just a little bit
[16:59] I know she wouldn't
[17:02] she wouldn't join in with me with that I
[17:05] know her as a Godly woman but the devil
[17:07] wants to draw every day people just like
[17:09] to scrap about something
[17:11] my son so told me something a few weeks
[17:13] ago he said you know I'm learning that
[17:15] there are people that are that drama is
[17:19] so normal in their life they can't live
[17:21] without it
[17:23] I said son that is so true and Lord help
[17:27] me not to be that way drama and
[17:29] something going on in the church and
[17:31] this and that and the other and they
[17:33] they live in a soap opera and how many
[17:36] knows soap operas aren't real
[17:39] soap opera and they present that as real
[17:42] life but it's not really real life it's
[17:43] a soap opera people like soap operas
[17:46] going on the church wonder what the
[17:48] pastors why is he doing that why is he
[17:50] why is she doing that why she do it and
[17:52] so they they live in that because it's
[17:53] so normal to them if they come out of
[17:55] that they wouldn't know how to live
[18:01] yeah
[18:03] they like drama they're like a good
[18:05] scrap they're like a good fight they
[18:07] like competition between families they
[18:09] create it
[18:10] because you are a creator
[18:13] the pressure to choose sides to pull you
[18:17] down
[18:17] but then I go back to that scripture
[18:19] that David said God Is Lifting Me Above
[18:23] All these things
[18:24] can you say amen and I can raise my hand
[18:27] he's going to set me upon the rock of
[18:29] Revelation above mine enemies now when
[18:31] you say above it doesn't mean I'm better
[18:33] than my enemies but I'm above it in
[18:35] other words I can live above it I can
[18:38] live in that secret place I can live
[18:40] upon a rock and I got up on the chair
[18:42] last week I'm living up here and all
[18:44] down here they're saying come on down
[18:46] fight with us come on down into my fear
[18:48] I'm nervous about stuff can you be
[18:50] nervous with me no I'm not I'm just
[18:52] praising the Lord I will pray for you
[18:53] but I'm not coming down to that level
[18:56] you know that's not where I want to live
[19:00] and when God is Raising you to uh to
[19:04] higher levels get ready for more devils
[19:10] that was borrowed from borrowed from TD
[19:12] Jakes
[19:14] when you want to go to the next level
[19:16] get ready for more doubles
[19:20] because you can't go to the next level
[19:21] spiritually unless there's a fight
[19:24] to keep you away
[19:26] just the way it works because you're
[19:28] making a stand you're making a better
[19:30] stand you're making a higher stand and
[19:32] you don't want to be brought down how
[19:34] many would raise their hands say I don't
[19:35] want to be brought down by people living
[19:37] in fear I don't want to be living with a
[19:39] Jonah can you say amen I want to be
[19:41] praised in the Lord all the time no
[19:43] matter what I'm going through can you
[19:44] say Amen you get up here say no I'm not
[19:46] coming down there why don't you come up
[19:48] here with me and praise the Lord a while
[19:49] once you come out of that fear
[19:51] [Applause]
[19:56] so this is what I didn't get to from the
[19:58] quote last Sunday uh I didn't get to any
[20:00] of these so I'm getting it here here
[20:02] people want to fight and this is the way
[20:04] the prophet said this is so good the way
[20:06] he wanted to live he said let my
[20:08] neighbors gossip do you have this quote
[20:09] let my neighbors gossip let this that or
[20:12] the other be gone I go to church for one
[20:15] thing that's to stay in your presence I
[20:17] would love every believer to only come
[20:19] to church for that reason
[20:21] I'm finding Through The Years people are
[20:23] coming for all different agendas all
[20:25] different motives even for a religious
[20:27] Duty I don't think we should come to
[20:29] church for any of that
[20:32] I don't think we should come to church
[20:33] to be seen I don't think that we should
[20:36] come to church just to pay our tithes I
[20:38] don't think it's a religious Duty I
[20:39] don't think we come to church to see one
[20:41] another I don't think we come to church
[20:43] for any other reason to to be in the
[20:46] presence of the Lord no other motive no
[20:49] other agenda can you say man no drama
[20:52] I'm coming to church because I hungry
[20:55] for the word of God that's it
[20:59] I go to church for one thing that's to
[21:01] stay in your presence I am moved in
[21:03] there Lord I never desire to leave again
[21:05] I'll Trust your word what you say
[21:07] there's where I want to be drop the
[21:09] veils around me Lord that I can only see
[21:11] Jesus alone and live and walk and die in
[21:14] him there you are drop the veils all
[21:17] around me you know your Bible well
[21:19] enough to know that they come in that
[21:21] interview only the high priest could do
[21:22] that but after Calvary every believer
[21:25] can come into the presence of the Lord
[21:27] and not only that say drop the veils
[21:30] behind me so I'm not affected by the
[21:32] weather I'm not affected by the gossip
[21:34] I'm not affected by the chatter I'm
[21:37] living in the inner veil with all the
[21:39] veils dropped behind me
[21:42] that's what brother Brown says he wants
[21:43] to live I want to live or walk and die
[21:46] in him can you say Amen on Mount
[21:48] figuration
[21:50] how do I go back
[21:54] uh
[21:55] oh no
[22:01] on Mount Transfiguration you're helping
[22:03] me out up there aren't you
[22:05] technically challenged Pastor up here
[22:08] on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus
[22:10] stood transfigured before the apostles
[22:12] when they looked up they seen just Jesus
[22:15] alone they said they seen Jesus only
[22:17] standing there remember Moses and Elijah
[22:19] were there wow some pretty important men
[22:21] prophets of God but when this is all
[22:24] done it's not about the prophets it's
[22:26] about Jesus only
[22:28] people get hung up on only looking at a
[22:31] prophet the the prophet's influence all
[22:33] that Fades away especially when they go
[22:35] off the scene the word that he brought
[22:36] of Christ but you see John the Baptist
[22:38] come to introduce Jesus and John the
[22:41] Baptist says now that he's here I must
[22:43] decrease he must increase
[22:46] to where the bride is saying when I look
[22:48] at this message when I come to church I
[22:51] only I don't see friends I don't see
[22:52] families I don't see competitions I see
[22:55] Jesus only
[22:59] Hallelujah
[23:01] they said they've seen Jesus only
[23:03] standing there oh God hide me in that
[23:06] place hide me over in that place where
[23:08] all the veils will drop and I'll see
[23:11] nothing but Jesus himself I don't want
[23:13] to hear the Fantastics of the world
[23:16] notice how hidden he starts to talk
[23:18] about now
[23:19] you become so hidden in Christ that you
[23:22] don't care about the latest thing that's
[23:24] going on
[23:25] sisters you don't care about the latest
[23:27] fashions that are going on
[23:29] so hidden in Christ the devil doesn't
[23:31] know where to find you
[23:35] I don't care whether they got atomic
[23:37] bombs whether they got a Jet Plane
[23:38] whether the new whether the new
[23:39] Chevrolets look better than the Buicks
[23:42] now we laugh about this but this is the
[23:45] realm sometimes even Believers can get
[23:48] in
[23:49] say our minds which one's better and
[23:51] when I think about that which I do
[23:54] when I think about that it's not about
[23:56] Chevrolet's or Buicks it's about Fords
[24:02] but I told you I think I told you I told
[24:05] some people I drove around here for two
[24:07] or three years in a Toyota Tundra around
[24:09] Lambertville and I got looked down on
[24:12] because you only dry to drive a Ford
[24:14] F-150 around here
[24:18] then I drove by the toms and I said yeah
[24:20] it drives better so I got a Ford so
[24:22] sometimes your carnal this is the stuff
[24:24] we begin to think about
[24:28] and I don't mean carnal and bad way I'm
[24:29] just saying it takes away from our mind
[24:31] time
[24:33] it's not a sin to think about a Buick or
[24:35] well it might be
[24:44] but you know this is the stuff and
[24:46] that's why brother Brandon mentions it
[24:47] whether this is the mindset whether the
[24:49] new Chevrolets will work look better
[24:51] than the Buicks it doesn't matter the
[24:53] thing of it is I'm walking living with
[24:55] Christ daily and I've died yourself and
[24:57] the veils are dropped around and I am in
[25:00] he and he and me that's the most
[25:02] important thing let the storms rage my
[25:04] anchor holds within the veil can't tell
[25:06] you why we have a lot of storms of the
[25:08] season this day but I'm thankful for an
[25:10] anchor that holds steadfast within the
[25:13] veil when she is rocking and look like
[25:16] every move would send her to the bottom
[25:17] yet my anchor is in the veil I've
[25:20] anchored in the veil I've Anchored In
[25:22] Jesus the storms of life I will Brave
[25:24] I'm Anchored In Jesus I'll fear no wind
[25:27] or wave I'm Anchored In Jesus for he has
[25:30] power to save I've anchored in the Rock
[25:32] of Ages he shall set me up upon a rock
[25:35] of Revelation
[25:38] God help us this morning to enter into
[25:40] that inner life quit staying out here
[25:42] where you're tossed about by every wind
[25:45] of Doctrine every little thing that
[25:47] comes along
[25:48] look at that lesson stop being tossed
[25:52] about by every little thing that comes
[25:56] along
[25:58] it's the little foxes
[26:00] the spoil the vine
[26:02] it's not the big thing sometimes it's
[26:04] getting so obsessed with the little
[26:06] things
[26:08] little stuff is this really important I
[26:11] remember Amanda's dad brother Steve he
[26:13] used to minister here passed away
[26:16] but he used to talk about that little
[26:19] things that he said one time and I
[26:21] remember it he said he said you're
[26:23] squabbling and you're arguing over this
[26:25] it's such a little thing what's that
[26:27] going to mean two years from now
[26:31] what a wisdom it's like you are making
[26:33] this such a big issue and it won't even
[26:35] matter in six months it may not even
[26:38] matter next week and you're going back
[26:40] to why don't we argue over that
[26:43] it's a little thing
[26:45] kept you from your joy kept you from
[26:47] your peace pulled you out of the
[26:49] atmosphere you're supposed to be in
[26:51] let's not let the little things the wind
[26:54] of Doctrine toss us about can you say
[26:57] Amen this morning
[26:59] praise the Lord
[27:01] so the theme of
[27:03] I just want to go into this prophecy of
[27:05] Israel just a little bit the theme of
[27:07] Prophecy for Israel is to in Prophecy to
[27:10] become surrounded by the enemy literally
[27:12] the world against them and many Jews see
[27:16] and believe prophecy of Deliverance
[27:18] they believe it today that their Messiah
[27:20] will deliver them they believe the the
[27:23] Deliverance part but they don't see what
[27:25] comes before their Deliverance
[27:28] they don't understand that and there
[27:30] will be great armies gather around that
[27:33] uh that uh piece of land there and it's
[27:36] not because of the piece of land
[27:37] necessarily but it's who's there and
[27:40] God's people and so
[27:42] we see them that the armies I'm going to
[27:44] skip some of this because some of some
[27:46] of this is revisiting what I've already
[27:48] preached on before but I just wanted to
[27:50] bring in this element of Israel
[27:52] literally now and so if you turn with me
[27:54] to Daniel 12 we'll see something happen
[27:56] here when all the armies gather around
[27:58] just after all the armies
[28:01] uh in Prophecy all surround Israel in
[28:05] Daniel chapter 12
[28:07] . if you turn with me there to verse 1
[28:09] there's a little bit of Prophecy for
[28:11] Israel here I wanted to deal with we see
[28:14] then when it comes to this trouble and
[28:16] it's called This is Israel's time of
[28:19] trouble worse than any trouble they've
[28:20] had a lot of trouble but this is the
[28:22] worst time is when all nations will
[28:24] gather against them
[28:27] and it's it's a time of trouble like
[28:29] never seen before chapter 12 says then
[28:32] and at that time and this is a time
[28:35] where the pressure will come shall
[28:37] Michael stand up the great Prince would
[28:40] standeth for the children of thy people
[28:42] and there shall be a time of trouble
[28:45] such as never was since there was a
[28:48] nation even to that same time now Israel
[28:51] had a lot of trouble through the years
[28:52] that's six thousand years of trouble
[28:54] they had times of trouble they had times
[28:56] when they went in Rebellion against God
[28:57] and they went into Babylon into
[28:59] captivity they had a lot of troubling
[29:01] times but this scripture says at the end
[29:04] they've never had any trouble compared
[29:07] to this trouble and I just look at that
[29:09] spiritually and say that for the bride
[29:12] spiritually there's no trouble like
[29:14] we're having now in the spiritual realm
[29:17] there's no other pressure like we're
[29:19] having now
[29:20] now you say brother Paul I don't know
[29:22] what you're talking about my life is
[29:23] good I'm doing pretty good I got a good
[29:25] salary and everything's pretty
[29:26] comfortable
[29:27] um so I'd only say to that what are you
[29:30] doing right I say that first but then I
[29:32] would say check your life
[29:34] because anybody who's making a stand and
[29:36] that's the elect of God the guns are
[29:38] pointed on you
[29:42] it says says now the the the the
[29:45] and it talks in the Bible here let me
[29:49] just finish this in the time of trouble
[29:50] such as never was since there was a
[29:53] nation even at the same time and at that
[29:55] time thy people shall be delivered every
[29:57] one that shall be found written in the
[29:59] book notice now there's the elect
[30:01] written in the Book of Life
[30:03] so we got several reasons now why the
[30:07] armies are encamped around this
[30:10] particular people
[30:12] they're in the Book of Life
[30:15] I think you remember that when you're
[30:17] being surrounded
[30:18] can't you remember that
[30:21] there's a reason that I'm being fought
[30:23] with demons
[30:27] probably because my name is in the Book
[30:29] of Life
[30:31] and I'm the elected can you say Amen and
[30:34] I'm part of him and so the the Bible
[30:38] speaks of the King of the North he plays
[30:41] a big part which is Russia the King of
[30:44] the South with more than likely that's
[30:46] China we don't know that for for sure
[30:49] but it if it's if it's talking about
[30:51] geographically the King of the North
[30:53] Russia we know who that is King of the
[30:55] South China and if you don't think that
[30:56] China and Russia look what's happening
[30:58] in the news
[31:00] they become prominent dictators now and
[31:03] they're finagling things and there's
[31:05] actually a pressure now I was talking
[31:06] about the Chad about this the other day
[31:08] there's there's a there's an alarming
[31:10] concern coming up for the economy to
[31:13] really crash here coming up and jobs are
[31:15] being lost and different things are
[31:17] happening because they're expecting a
[31:18] recession and a lot of it is attention
[31:20] in the world the the China moving in
[31:23] Russia moving in this war and all this
[31:25] and China joining with them well we got
[31:27] the King of the North and even though we
[31:29] realize that we were directed not
[31:32] not always just watch communism as being
[31:36] the problem but romanism as being the
[31:39] final thing the Antichrist spirit will
[31:41] be more deceiving than Russia so we're
[31:43] watching all of this but he did say
[31:45] watch Russia
[31:47] and now you watch China if that's the
[31:50] King of the North the King of the South
[31:51] all this would be part of end time
[31:53] events to fuel and bring on more and
[31:56] more tensions around the world the King
[31:58] of the North the King of the South and
[32:00] feeling other nations to bring more and
[32:02] more tensions around the world and they
[32:05] are behind much more than what we think
[32:06] these these bigger Nations they stir up
[32:09] they stir up things for no reason other
[32:12] than to turn and remember the right the
[32:14] the the the the communism is just a
[32:16] Godless communistic people they don't
[32:19] regard God there's no regard for the
[32:21] holy part of the war that will happen in
[32:24] Armageddon and happen in the third world
[32:25] war we know that it by Revelation that
[32:29] when they gather around it's more about
[32:31] a holy war than it is than it is a war
[32:34] about Nations struggling at the end of
[32:37] the day it's going to be a holy war well
[32:39] then it's the same with you
[32:41] it's not a carnal thing that people are
[32:43] just against you there's a holy war
[32:45] going on it's about Holiness it's about
[32:48] your stand that you make
[32:51] so the Russians don't care about they
[32:52] don't they're just doing it for power
[32:54] and all these other things there's no
[32:55] regard for the part of the holy war part
[32:57] of it it'll be only one man the
[32:59] Antichrist that will be interested in
[33:01] taking over Israel and being the god of
[33:03] that as well and being over that he's
[33:05] because it's a holy war to him
[33:09] and they have no regard it's it shows
[33:12] they have no regard for God because
[33:13] they're the ones that drop the bomb on
[33:14] the Vatican now for those listening uh
[33:17] listen I'll be glad to sit and have
[33:19] coffee and explain these things but God
[33:21] has opened up a lot of things of
[33:23] Revelation The Book of Revelation has
[33:25] been opened up in the last days and if
[33:27] you're curious and interested in it we
[33:30] can show you some things for me be able
[33:31] to have the authority to say there will
[33:33] be a bomb dropped from Russia the king
[33:35] of the north on the Vatican showing they
[33:37] have no regard for the holy part of it
[33:39] or the the religious War part of it but
[33:43] it will be the final Conquest the final
[33:46] battle will be around a holy war
[33:51] religious
[33:53] the pressure that comes on you and I
[33:55] even as Believers today and comes on the
[33:58] foolish version when she's in
[34:00] Tribulation will be about a pressure
[34:02] from the economical religious system
[34:05] against the true people of God you can't
[34:08] do that anymore you can't meet like that
[34:10] anymore you can't do that you've got to
[34:11] join in with us it's a religious War
[34:15] that's why on a lower level we're
[34:17] persecuted even sometimes in our own
[34:19] ranks by people when we make a stand to
[34:22] get something that's the Antichrist
[34:24] spirit
[34:25] I know it's quiet I'm prepared to preach
[34:27] during these things without any amens
[34:29] but I'm preaching to you the word of God
[34:31] this is reality this is a religious deep
[34:33] religious devils and demons two hundred
[34:36] thousand thousand two million religious
[34:38] Devils were released upon the Jews can
[34:41] you say Amen religious devils
[34:46] so
[34:48] let me just move on here
[34:50] but Russia is not the biggest problem
[34:52] in chapter 11 it goes into the
[34:54] Antichrist if you study the Book of
[34:56] Daniel Daniel he is this deception that
[34:58] the world Falls for so deceiving he
[35:01] makes contact with Israel to make a
[35:03] contract with Israel to try to help her
[35:04] and then backs out at the last minute
[35:06] that's what Daniel says they make a
[35:09] covenant with Israel and thinking it's
[35:11] going to be a religious thing but then
[35:12] he backs out of it he breaks the
[35:14] Covenant so Russia and the Antichrist
[35:16] are key players until Christ comes and
[35:19] steps forth and this is the point that I
[35:22] want to make to you out of chapter 12
[35:25] and verse 1 at that time shall Michael
[35:28] stand up the great Prince which standed
[35:32] for the children of thy people and there
[35:33] should be a time of trouble such as ever
[35:35] since it was a nation even to the same
[35:36] time and at that time thy people shall
[35:40] be delivered
[35:44] Hallelujah
[35:46] so Israel doesn't know that it'll be
[35:48] time of great trouble and pressures in
[35:50] the world surrounding him and they're
[35:51] going to try to get their their military
[35:53] together and try to fight and God will
[35:54] stand behind them but what the greatest
[35:56] thing is Michael Michael Christ
[36:00] is going to step into this thing
[36:03] and the time of trouble at their worst
[36:05] trouble will be the time of their
[36:07] Deliverance if we could only hold on to
[36:10] that today that in this time of trouble
[36:12] we're getting close to our deliverance
[36:17] let it get worse let the pressure bring
[36:20] it on if it's going to bring my
[36:21] Deliverance Bring It On devil if it's
[36:24] going to bring my bring it on if Michael
[36:26] steps into the situation and he will do
[36:29] that someday for the Jews and if he
[36:31] doesn't for the Jews he'll do it today
[36:33] for us he's going to step into our
[36:35] pressure someday while we're living in
[36:37] that hidden place and as I said last
[36:39] Sunday it's like job said hide me in the
[36:42] grave well he had a revelation to say
[36:44] that who wants to be hidden in the grave
[36:45] who wants to die and go I the grave is
[36:48] not a hiding place it is for a Christian
[36:52] job could say hide me in the grave
[36:54] because he knew the Redeemer I know my
[36:58] redeemer lives I know my redeemer lives
[37:01] and at that day he'll stand for me and
[37:04] he'll stand at that grave and say it's
[37:07] time to come out it's time for your
[37:08] deliverance
[37:11] so I can take the trouble Bring It On
[37:14] oh I hope I'm not bringing more things
[37:15] on me but
[37:18] I got to let the devil know
[37:20] that all this works together for my good
[37:23] all the accusations all the criticism
[37:27] it's gonna the devil if he only knew I'm
[37:29] trying to tell him but he's not
[37:31] listening
[37:33] he only knew bring it on because it's
[37:35] bringing my Deliverance
[37:37] it's giving me more Rapture and Faith
[37:40] it's given me more I want to get out of
[37:41] here
[37:43] praise the Lord everybody
[37:45] it's the truth
[37:48] the time of trouble is the time of
[37:50] Deliverance for Israel notice this was
[37:53] revealed under the Sixth Seal
[37:55] Revelations 12 17. I want you to notice
[37:58] this scripture
[38:00] I will go to book the revelations
[38:02] Revelations 12 17. just another small
[38:05] element I want to bring in
[38:07] that you would understand
[38:10] why there's an increased demonic power
[38:14] and Satan Maybe
[38:16] is in the time where he's very nervous
[38:19] and he's you know he doesn't understand
[38:22] the word he doesn't understand
[38:23] revelation
[38:25] and
[38:27] he can't have what the bride has he
[38:30] can't have it this is why he's jealous
[38:33] that's why he fights against it to stop
[38:35] it
[38:36] you know you've always had what the
[38:38] devil wanted
[38:41] with Adam and Eve he had the creative
[38:43] power and it was the ruler of this Earth
[38:45] and that's what devil wanted
[38:46] from so from the very start
[38:49] you the Believers have always possessed
[38:52] by Revelation and had it in them what
[38:54] the devil wanted
[38:55] you wonder why he's against you and he
[38:57] can never have it
[38:59] is everybody awake today
[39:02] just raise your hands and pinch yourself
[39:04] there
[39:07] turn the air on hot real cold something
[39:10] here
[39:12] he can't ever have has never had it and
[39:16] can't ever have what you have
[39:22] that's enough to have a really shouting
[39:24] time on Monday put it on your
[39:26] refrigerator if you have to devil you
[39:28] will never have what I have
[39:34] and and from the beginning I like to
[39:36] point this out it's like
[39:38] he comes on the scene because he's
[39:40] jealous of what Adam and Eve have and
[39:42] eventually he had to be kicked out you
[39:44] know what actually it happened before he
[39:46] was kicked out of heaven
[39:48] he got this stir with all the the
[39:51] brothers the angels and a third part of
[39:53] the angels with influence with them to
[39:55] come against he wanted to raise his
[39:56] kingdom so he was jealous he couldn't
[39:58] have the position he wanted and so now
[40:00] he creates a certain finally there he
[40:03] was kicked out of heaven with his angels
[40:04] He was kicked out on Earth he's kicked
[40:06] out of the garden even the son and
[40:07] daughter were kicked out of the garden
[40:08] because they fell with him
[40:10] who's kicked out then there's tension
[40:13] between uh Isaac and Ishmael there's
[40:16] tension between Cain and Abel and then
[40:19] then that ended and then his tension
[40:20] between Ishmael and Isaac and
[40:24] he had to be kicked out of the camp we
[40:26] got to get rid of cast out the Bond
[40:28] woman and her son
[40:31] and then I could go after scripture
[40:33] where the tension Rises he gets kicked
[40:35] out the tension Rises he gets kicked out
[40:38] why do you let this guy bother you
[40:44] when he's been kicked out of every
[40:46] believer's situation from the beginning
[40:50] if he's been kicked out all the way
[40:53] through then why don't you give him the
[40:55] boot every now and then
[40:59] he's used to it he's used to being
[41:01] kicked out
[41:03] all the way to the end when we get the
[41:05] Book of Revelation and Satan and his
[41:07] angels will be cast out the accuser of
[41:10] who the accuser of the Brethren stood
[41:13] there with tension with accusations
[41:15] keeping things tense all the time
[41:17] accusing accusing in your ear every
[41:19] neighbor of the Joe in your ear every
[41:21] day brother Bob and but but one day one
[41:24] day it's the same history he's going to
[41:26] be kicked out and you'll never hear that
[41:27] voice again
[41:31] this is history I don't know how he
[41:33] can't look in the Book of Revelations
[41:34] and see his answers he's going to be
[41:36] kicked out at the very end of it kick
[41:38] out of the atmospheres kicked out of
[41:40] heaven
[41:41] kicked off the Earth so the bride can
[41:43] come back and enjoy this without the
[41:45] devil here
[41:47] praise God hallelujah
[41:51] give him the boot every day because he's
[41:53] used to it
[41:57] when he's trying to come in and make you
[41:59] a gossip or give him the boot and stop
[42:01] your family and say we don't do that
[42:04] because that's the realm the devil Works
[42:06] in
[42:08] give him a boot
[42:10] that's not you you're teaching your
[42:12] children to be gossipers
[42:13] teaching your children to be accusers of
[42:15] the brethren
[42:16] to be accusations against Elders that's
[42:19] a serious thing I know that's not the
[42:21] kingdom of God that's Satan's kingdom
[42:24] I was going to read something to you
[42:26] this morning and I didn't expect to say
[42:27] this
[42:29] we're always sensitive to the God
[42:31] speaking not only through me over the
[42:33] pulpit through different believers
[42:34] quite a few months ago there was a
[42:36] sister that had a dream
[42:38] several things in the dream have come to
[42:39] the Past
[42:40] she hasn't told me the specifics of the
[42:42] last one she doesn't want to do that but
[42:44] it was this and then a sister
[42:47] sent me a voicemail the other day and
[42:49] she just said this is what my heart is
[42:51] feeling and I just feel brother Paul
[42:53] pray about this because there's there's
[42:55] more pressure coming
[42:57] to tell the people to button up to lock
[43:00] all the doors she says it's like a it's
[43:02] like a tornado getting ready to hit the
[43:04] church
[43:04] or one happy family
[43:06] the devil's not going to leave it that
[43:08] way
[43:09] so I always take these little things as
[43:11] I'm not the only one that can speak her
[43:12] God can speak through his body through
[43:14] dreams and things and there was just a
[43:16] sensitivity that something's coming here
[43:18] soon and we need to buckle up our armor
[43:23] because the armor is the for the fiery
[43:25] darts
[43:27] buckle up close the doors
[43:30] get in that safe place
[43:32] get ready and I don't know the details
[43:33] of it but I just say I take any warning
[43:36] if it's from the Lord I take it serious
[43:40] we're not in a picnic here what I'm
[43:43] preaching here and what you're trying to
[43:45] live is not a picnic it's what the devil
[43:48] hates he hates Revelation he hates
[43:51] people growing in the Lord he hates
[43:54] Unity amongst the people of God he hates
[43:58] it
[44:00] so I think it's a little bit of warning
[44:01] I didn't want to say it but I guess I'm
[44:03] willing to be sensitive say Lord let me
[44:07] be prepared in my heart
[44:09] that I can keep the right spirit
[44:12] one of the parts of the dream is the
[44:13] family betraying me
[44:15] so I just say Lord let me respond with
[44:19] Divine love if that happens
[44:27] is that okay with everybody
[44:30] in the time of trouble the time of
[44:32] trouble is our the time of Deliverance
[44:33] and this is what
[44:35] he says in Psalms 27 it in the time of
[44:39] trouble he will hide me but it's the
[44:41] time of Deliverance because the prophet
[44:43] Rapture so in this time of trouble is
[44:46] the time for our deliverance and a
[44:47] Rapture if we're surrounded by the enemy
[44:50] ganged up on by the enemy guess what and
[44:54] it's if it's showing no relief it it
[44:56] shows nothing in the prophecy for it to
[44:59] stop uh you know and the thing is is
[45:01] that until God steps in he lets the
[45:04] pressure continue he lets the pressure
[45:06] go the only hope we have is a hiding
[45:08] place until he delivers us in a rapture
[45:11] but we have that hiding place the only
[45:13] thing it's doing is setting us up for
[45:15] the total deliverance and that's our
[45:17] Rapture my friends if you hear the
[45:19] Simplicity of what I'm expressing for my
[45:21] spiritual life and your spiritual life
[45:22] the only place we need the one desire we
[45:26] need to be in every day is to live in
[45:28] that secure safe place in the word
[45:32] I'm going to be direct right now you you
[45:34] young couples are you listening to the
[45:36] this prophet
[45:39] you got young children are you listening
[45:40] to this word are you in this Bible
[45:43] how much of the day is spent on social
[45:46] media or on movies
[45:49] how much of your entertaining time is
[45:51] consumed and I ask you how much are you
[45:53] in the prophet that God sent us
[45:55] listening to that voice it's not about
[45:56] the man it's about what he said
[45:59] I love every line of this message
[46:03] when I when I listen to it I don't see
[46:06] the man I see there's there can be a
[46:09] sentence that God breathed to this
[46:12] generation because if you don't
[46:13] understand a prophet then you see you're
[46:16] not going to have a value for it
[46:18] it's like why do we quote this all the
[46:19] time
[46:20] because
[46:22] if it is true that God sent Elijah
[46:25] through a man
[46:27] if you got that Revelation this is the
[46:29] Elijah of this day to introduce the
[46:31] second coming Christ then if you know
[46:33] that then it's like when I was 16 years
[46:35] old I said it this way if God sent an
[46:40] Elijah man with the spirit Elijah to my
[46:42] generation
[46:44] if that has happened which he showed me
[46:46] it is it was prophesying it happened
[46:49] then I'm hanging on every word
[46:52] I know the humanness part of it and
[46:54] there's not he said himself that some of
[46:56] this is just human some of it's the some
[46:58] of it's not safe I understand all that
[47:00] but I I value every word there's a
[47:02] reason why he says things
[47:04] I'm hanging on it
[47:06] every sentence and one sentence can be
[47:09] such a such a damage to the enemy
[47:14] so I asked you how much are you
[47:16] listening
[47:17] you young couples young married you
[47:19] don't have a core to your marriage
[47:20] unless you find and dwell in that word
[47:23] for this generation get your Bible you
[47:26] have anything to hold your marriage
[47:28] together except Christ
[47:30] and the word and being in the word
[47:32] this isn't a guilt trip this is say just
[47:35] get into the word because you're going
[47:36] to need it if what if what somebody's
[47:38] word of the Lords is saying and the
[47:40] pressure it's not going to be one happy
[47:42] family people turn against one another
[47:43] you're gonna need to be in a a hiding
[47:46] place you're going to need to be in the
[47:48] word you're going to need
[47:49] stand
[47:56] praise the Lord
[47:59] now
[48:04] so it's a different type of trouble that
[48:06] we're under today
[48:07] I don't think for the bride it's going
[48:08] to be about Rockets or bombs hitting
[48:11] close to your house at night
[48:13] even though when I hear something I go
[48:15] what's going on
[48:18] because it could happen at any time
[48:20] with the war going they could drop a
[48:22] bomb you know they could drop a little
[48:23] bomb not the big one we'll be out of
[48:25] here before the big one comes the bride
[48:27] will be
[48:28] but I hear those I don't know I'm
[48:29] sleeping
[48:30] when the word was that I'm too scared to
[48:33] go outside and see what it is
[48:37] what's starting to get on the news
[48:39] what's going on here
[48:40] but I don't think our trouble is to be
[48:43] worried about bombs coming close to our
[48:45] house
[48:46] I think it's demonic
[48:48] homosexual lesbian entertainment of the
[48:52] world
[48:53] that's the bombs being dropped close to
[48:55] your house
[48:57] that's the trouble that causes families
[49:00] our trouble is Detention of the
[49:02] Antichrist Spirit working Among Us
[49:05] it hurts it's trouble
[49:09] so I want to end this today at a very
[49:13] decent time 12 30
[49:17] by turning to this group Daniel chapter
[49:20] 3.
[49:25] because if you want to talk about
[49:28] uh you know and there's a lot of
[49:30] scriptures that talk about when the
[49:32] people of God were surrounded
[49:34] the enemies surrounding there's a lot of
[49:38] places in the children of Israel when
[49:39] they were warring and fighting they got
[49:41] surrounded by the enemy
[49:43] remember gehaza I remember the prophet
[49:46] saying
[49:47] and he looked out and just like
[49:49] everywhere there's a host of enemy all
[49:51] the way around him
[49:53] remember what the prophet had said to
[49:54] him God opened them open the boy's eyes
[49:59] open his eyes because all he could see
[50:02] is all this real what are we going to do
[50:04] they're surrounding us Lord open the
[50:06] boy's eyes God help the boy
[50:09] God help the boy
[50:11] he opened his eyes I seen a great host
[50:13] around the back of him
[50:19] what did I say Daniel 3.
[50:21] so if you're talking about being
[50:23] surrounded All Through the Bible you
[50:24] have it but here's some guys that
[50:29] Daniel chapter 3 verse 8.
[50:36] or for at that time certain Chaldeans
[50:38] came near and accused the Jews they
[50:40] spake and said that the King
[50:41] Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever
[50:43] forever thou O King has made a degree
[50:45] that every man that shall hear the sound
[50:47] of their Coronet
[50:48] uh flute harp sack butt
[50:52] sultry dulcimer and all kinds of music
[50:54] shall fall down and worship the golden
[50:57] image
[50:59] um I'd like to preach a little sermon in
[51:01] here that did you notice bowing to the
[51:03] image was associated with all kinds of
[51:06] music
[51:08] music was used to open their emotions to
[51:11] bow to the image
[51:13] because music is used to open up your
[51:16] emotions we use it here in the service
[51:18] but what is it opening up your heart to
[51:21] receive
[51:23] right and whoso fall was not down and
[51:26] worshipeth that he should be cast in the
[51:27] midst of the burning fiery furnace there
[51:30] are certain Jews whom the whom thou has
[51:33] set over the Affairs of the province of
[51:34] Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[51:37] these men O King have not regarded thee
[51:39] they serve not thy Gods no worship the
[51:41] golden image which thou has set up then
[51:43] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage
[51:47] point
[51:49] this man was mad but now he's in a rage
[51:52] and what is he in a rage about
[51:56] what has his in his anger increased
[51:59] about
[52:00] believers who made a stand
[52:03] against him
[52:11] that's what it was about
[52:13] his anger increased his rage increased
[52:16] I'm going to do something more now
[52:17] because I'm angry why am I angry because
[52:20] they won't join in with the rest and bow
[52:22] to the same thing
[52:24] they're not going to bow
[52:26] his rage was increased then
[52:29] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[52:31] commanded to bring Shaq can you imagine
[52:33] we get mad at a lot of things but can
[52:35] you imagine what this guy is on rage and
[52:37] fury about he's against three believers
[52:39] who make a stand
[52:43] you make a stand
[52:46] see some of you today I'm I'm
[52:48] encouraging you I pray you feel the pull
[52:50] of the Lord for your family your wife
[52:51] girlfriend whatever it is I pray that
[52:54] you feel the pull through the preaching
[52:55] that Christ is pulling you because you
[52:57] haven't made a stand yet
[53:00] mom you haven't made a real stand
[53:02] but you need to make a stand
[53:07] you're a daddy you need to make a stand
[53:09] for the rest of the family
[53:12] so he's in a rage he's in a fury in
[53:13] verse 14 never connect or spake and said
[53:15] unto them is it true oh Shadrach me
[53:18] shaking do not ye serve my gods nor
[53:21] worship the golden image which I've set
[53:22] up now if you be ready that at what time
[53:25] you hear the sound of the Cornet flute
[53:27] harp sagput sultry dulcimer I don't know
[53:32] why all the names of the instruments are
[53:35] mentioned again
[53:38] and all kinds of music ye shall fall
[53:41] down and worship the image which I have
[53:44] made well but if ye worship not ye shall
[53:47] be cast in the same hour into the midst
[53:49] of the burning fiery furnace and who is
[53:51] that God that shall deliver you out of
[53:54] my hands
[53:57] threats
[54:01] pressure
[54:03] anger coming against you
[54:05] wow
[54:07] so he gave him another chance my dad
[54:08] used to preach this I always loved when
[54:10] he preached Shadrach Meshach in a minute
[54:11] ago because he said I'm gonna give you
[54:13] guys another chance okay we're going to
[54:16] do this privately the whole world
[54:17] doesn't need to see just come over here
[54:19] in a minute and here's the image right
[54:21] here and just while nobody's watching
[54:23] just get down and bow that's all you
[54:25] have to do just do quick little bow
[54:27] privately secretly
[54:31] I'm giving you another chance to bow
[54:39] and
[54:42] here's their answer verse 16.
[54:44] Shadrach Meshach and Mingo answered
[54:46] instead of the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[54:49] are not careful to answer thee in this
[54:51] matter
[54:52] in other words in our language let me
[54:55] make myself perfectly clear
[54:58] perfectly transparent
[55:01] we don't want any question in your mind
[55:04] we're being very careful to answer very
[55:07] direct to you
[55:11] glory be to God take a stand
[55:14] don't be afraid of the enemy
[55:19] have we made ourselves perfectly
[55:21] transparent
[55:24] if it bestow Our God whom we serve as
[55:27] able Deliver Us From The Burning Fire
[55:29] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[55:32] thine handle King so God's able to do it
[55:35] but if not
[55:37] be it known unto thee may we make it
[55:40] Crystal Clear To You O King that we will
[55:43] not serve thy Gods nor worship the
[55:46] golden image which thou has set up
[55:50] you want a little amen
[55:54] there's a Believer to me
[55:57] God is able at this moment to deliver me
[56:00] from whatever it is cancer emotional
[56:03] instability God Can Heal Me God can
[56:06] raise the Dead
[56:08] and I believe it with all my heart I've
[56:10] watched it happen I know it can happen
[56:13] but I want to let the devil know
[56:15] that if something happened God chooses
[56:17] to take somebody in cancer I'm still not
[56:20] bow into the world I'm still not bowing
[56:23] to your image
[56:25] that's the language of a believer
[56:28] and did you know the image was unto the
[56:30] prophet
[56:32] that's the solo added that's another
[56:34] sermon
[56:37] whoo
[56:39] so we're not bound to that either
[56:42] images to William Branham we're not
[56:44] bound to that
[56:45] this church doesn't bow to that we have
[56:47] one in Lord savior here we have one
[56:50] Christ that we serve can you say Amen
[56:55] not bowing God can deliver us
[56:59] but if he doesn't we're not still not
[57:01] bowing then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[57:05] Fury
[57:08] do you guys have to keep doing things
[57:10] that make him even more mad
[57:14] he was already inferior now he's full of
[57:17] Fury friends I'm saying this to let you
[57:20] know this is the same devil who's
[57:22] against the same thing he's against you
[57:26] he's against your family
[57:28] try to live holy try to get your kids in
[57:31] the right atmosphere try to try to have
[57:34] a Godly marriage and fellowship around
[57:36] the world try to do those things and
[57:38] watch the devil fight it with
[57:40] distractions and financial pressures and
[57:43] all this and pressures of businesses
[57:46] trust me I've lived there I know what a
[57:49] pressure of businesses can bring on a
[57:51] marriage on your walk with the Lord and
[57:53] finally you get to the place and wait a
[57:54] minute none of this is worth my
[57:56] fellowship with the Lord said you stop
[57:58] right there there's no money there's no
[58:00] retirement I hope I'm speaking to
[58:02] somebody there is no planning financial
[58:04] planning that's more important than what
[58:07] God's doing in this hour
[58:09] let it all let it be taken from me today
[58:12] my track my money my retirement my 401k
[58:15] and incidentally you may lose it
[58:18] I say let it all go if I have Christ
[58:21] Living in my heart
[58:24] is this the part Satan can't take job
[58:27] job could everything was taken from him
[58:29] his kids his money his buildings
[58:32] everything but guess what Satan couldn't
[58:36] take that part that was in job
[58:39] there's something Satan couldn't take
[58:43] then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fear in
[58:45] the form of his Visage was changed
[58:47] against sadrach Meshach and then he go
[58:48] therefore he spake and commanded that
[58:50] they should heat the furnace one seven
[58:52] times more
[58:54] did I read that right and commanded that
[58:57] they should heat the furnace one seven
[59:00] times more than was want to be heated in
[59:04] other words in my language Satan is
[59:07] turning the heat up on the bride
[59:10] Satan's turning the heat up on your life
[59:13] things to turning the heat up on your
[59:15] family
[59:16] Satan's turning the heat up on
[59:18] Gatherings like this
[59:24] turn the heat up he commanded the most
[59:26] mighty men that there were in his army
[59:28] to bind them
[59:30] I'm picking out the strongest dudes
[59:32] to bind these guys up so they never get
[59:34] out and cast them into the burning fiery
[59:36] furnace then these men were Bound in
[59:38] their coats they're hosen and their hats
[59:40] and their other garments and were cast
[59:42] into the midst of the burning fiery
[59:43] furnace therefore because the king's
[59:45] commandment was urgent and the furnace
[59:47] exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew
[59:50] those men that took up Shadrach Meshach
[59:52] and meningo to the fire furnace they
[59:54] died they got so close to it they died
[59:56] and these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[59:58] minigo fell down Bound in the midst of
[1:00:02] the burning fiery furnace there's nobody
[1:00:04] that's been around surrounded by the
[1:00:07] Flames like these young men were
[1:00:14] I know I'm taking just a tad longer but
[1:00:16] I'll just say this
[1:00:18] how many remember
[1:00:21] the thing that God showed brother
[1:00:24] Branham as he was coming down the
[1:00:26] escalator
[1:00:27] in a mall
[1:00:30] and as a little boy he had a little
[1:00:32] vision or trance he went into of hell
[1:00:36] and he seen miserable people just
[1:00:39] bound people and women with makeup and
[1:00:42] just and this they were kind of panting
[1:00:45] and seeing these ridiculous things and
[1:00:48] just bound
[1:00:49] and he's seen it scared him to death and
[1:00:51] he said God never let me go there he
[1:00:53] went to hell
[1:00:54] he went to the dimensions of Hell
[1:00:57] I was coming down in 1964 65 the
[1:01:00] escalator in a mall can't remember which
[1:01:02] mall it was
[1:01:04] it was in Tucson or Phoenix
[1:01:06] and he says I looked and there was some
[1:01:08] women there in the bottom floor
[1:01:11] he said I look he said they were panting
[1:01:13] they had all the stuff on their face
[1:01:15] everything was saved and he says I
[1:01:18] realized
[1:01:19] I was back in hell again
[1:01:23] a transition had taken place
[1:01:26] he got the scripture and just so we're
[1:01:28] scriptural for everybody it's listening
[1:01:29] scripturally hell has enlarged itself
[1:01:34] hell has surfaced in the end time that
[1:01:39] we look we're going to go we'll go with
[1:01:41] people they're going to go to hell
[1:01:42] someday going to go well someday well I
[1:01:44] want to let you know the the the fourth
[1:01:47] dimension television
[1:01:52] The Fifth Dimension hell where they go
[1:01:55] that are unsaved
[1:01:57] sixth Dimension is where they go when
[1:01:58] you're saved to wait to the final
[1:02:00] Resurrection
[1:02:01] seventh Dimension is where God dwells
[1:02:03] these are all these are all right in
[1:02:05] this room right now way up there right
[1:02:07] here first three is time light and
[1:02:10] matter which is what we live in
[1:02:12] fourth dimension is television
[1:02:15] so the sixth dimension
[1:02:17] through the sixth Dimension hell spills
[1:02:20] into the fourth dimension when
[1:02:22] television was developed
[1:02:25] and then we watch it and the sixth
[1:02:28] Dimension spills into the fourth and the
[1:02:29] fourth spills into our dimension
[1:02:33] he said I was
[1:02:34] scared he didn't say I was scared he
[1:02:36] said I realized I was living in hell
[1:02:38] again
[1:02:41] it's 1965.
[1:02:45] so it's not that we look for those
[1:02:47] Dimensions to go to someday
[1:02:50] but they're already moved up to Earth
[1:02:53] so I can safely say as I close the
[1:02:56] service we are like Shadrach Meshach and
[1:02:59] Abednego we are surrounded by the Flames
[1:03:02] of hell
[1:03:04] now
[1:03:08] because we were always taught in the
[1:03:10] Baptist Church as a it's an eternal
[1:03:11] burning place it's a Eternal burning
[1:03:13] place and you have enough types of
[1:03:14] scriptures so that there is a break but
[1:03:16] there's not Eternal it's not going to
[1:03:17] burn for for all of eternity and hell
[1:03:19] because the only thing Eternal is God it
[1:03:21] was created for Satan and his angels
[1:03:23] it's going to end someday so there is a
[1:03:26] place and remember the man that lifted
[1:03:27] up his eyes in hell and he wanted to
[1:03:29] drink so there's a reality with that but
[1:03:31] hell is so much more than just a
[1:03:33] physical place where you burn that's
[1:03:35] that's not it hell is separation from
[1:03:37] God
[1:03:38] and if you're separate from God this
[1:03:40] morning you're already living in a Hell
[1:03:44] I hate to be so straight with you but
[1:03:45] don't look at hell as I'm going there
[1:03:47] someday don't look at that look at this
[1:03:49] that I'm living it without God I'm
[1:03:51] living in hell now
[1:03:53] I'm surrounded by Flames now and
[1:03:55] Shadrach and mizak were surrounded
[1:03:57] surrounded surrounded by Flames why
[1:04:00] because of the anger increasing in Satan
[1:04:05] in Nebuchadnezzar he increased the heat
[1:04:07] he increased the pressure you got an
[1:04:09] enemy you're increasing the pressure
[1:04:10] every day on your life because of the
[1:04:12] stand you make that's why they're in
[1:04:14] that fire furnace because of the stand
[1:04:16] they make the Revelation that's why I
[1:04:17] titled this hide me hide me Lord give me
[1:04:20] uh put me in the safe place of
[1:04:23] Revelation because that's the only safe
[1:04:24] place to be
[1:04:28] oh let me finish
[1:04:30] the Sunday School Story
[1:04:32] and I hope to the young people and
[1:04:34] children and to the adults this is more
[1:04:37] than just a Sunday school story of
[1:04:39] Shadrach Meshach and a minute ago we're
[1:04:41] living in it right now
[1:04:44] we're surrounded by the Flames of hell
[1:04:46] right now
[1:04:48] because of the stand we make because of
[1:04:50] revelation we hold
[1:04:52] it doesn't devil doesn't hate your
[1:04:54] personality
[1:04:55] that's your uncle
[1:05:01] that's that family member devil doesn't
[1:05:03] hate you because your personality
[1:05:05] or that you know
[1:05:06] he hates the Revelation that you got
[1:05:08] that he doesn't have
[1:05:12] it's a revelation we stand upon
[1:05:17] these three men fell bound into the Mist
[1:05:20] then Nebuchadnezzar the king verse 24
[1:05:21] astonished rose up in haste and spake
[1:05:24] and said unto the counselors did not we
[1:05:26] cast three men bounded in the midst of
[1:05:28] fire they answered and said unto the
[1:05:29] king oh tree true king we only set three
[1:05:32] in there he answers said lo I see four
[1:05:34] men loose walking in the midst of the
[1:05:38] fire
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:47] unharmed by the flames
[1:05:50] surrounded but unharmed how many would
[1:05:53] raise your hand and say that's where I
[1:05:55] want to be living I don't care the
[1:05:56] flavors if I'm surrounded I want to be
[1:05:59] unharmed by the protection of God and
[1:06:01] also another thing I want to see and
[1:06:03] that the devil can look and see walking
[1:06:05] in the midst of the fire can you imagine
[1:06:07] these guys and the King was so angry and
[1:06:10] it didn't make him any more peaceful at
[1:06:12] all it'd probably make him I bound them
[1:06:15] I stuck them in I put everything on them
[1:06:17] and these guys are in there walking
[1:06:19] around in the middle of the flames
[1:06:26] every praise is to our God every word of
[1:06:30] worship never could answer you got some
[1:06:32] music well I got some music right now
[1:06:41] he answered and said lo I see four men
[1:06:43] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[1:06:45] and they have no hurt and the form of
[1:06:48] the fourth is like the son of God
[1:06:55] eyes yeah
[1:06:58] we're in the midst of Hell the Flames of
[1:07:00] hell
[1:07:01] it's not prophesied to get any better
[1:07:02] but if I can be in there with the Lord
[1:07:04] he's walking through the Flames with me
[1:07:07] that's all I need
[1:07:13] I'm done
[1:07:17] you feel courage today
[1:07:19] you feel Faith in your heart today
[1:07:21] you know that what God has deposited
[1:07:23] within you that's the thing the devil

[1:07:32] you stand for this message of the last
[1:07:34] days of Christ I always like to say the
[1:07:37] message of Christ for the last days
[1:07:38] because that's what it is it's not the
[1:07:40] movement it's not the churches that's
[1:07:42] not the message
[1:07:43] when I say I love this message I don't
[1:07:46] mean the churches and the movement I
[1:07:48] mean the core of what God spoke through
[1:07:51] his Prophet I love every bit of it I
[1:07:54] live on it

[1:07:58] me to how to live in this game

[1:15:07] I had fallen on my knees as I faced the
[1:15:10] Raging Seas The Anchor Holds will the
[1:15:13] ship is battered the ship has torn as
[1:15:15] many here this morning and serving the
[1:15:16] lord many years myself included the ship
[1:15:20] is battered the Sails are torn
[1:15:23] it's almost every day of saying Lord
[1:15:25] come quickly Lord Jesus people are tired
[1:15:28] people are weary not so much in our
[1:15:31] souls but in our minds and hearts we're
[1:15:33] weary for the battle the Lord our anchor
[1:15:36] holds and you'll hold us through the
[1:15:37] rest of the storm father I pray for the
[1:15:41] souls this morning that you've placed in
[1:15:43] my care Lord to minister your word
[1:15:47] though Lord Jesus we
[1:15:50] we have many things come our way
[1:15:53] you have taken us through them all and
[1:15:56] you will take us
[1:15:59] through all of the ones that are ahead
[1:16:01] of us Lord
[1:16:02] I wonder if that those two sisters
[1:16:05] feeling a little something Lord coming
[1:16:07] for our church
[1:16:08] I wonder if that be you Lord
[1:16:11] what if there's more challenges coming
[1:16:14] Lord
[1:16:15] if it be so my Lord Jesus prepare us may
[1:16:19] we tighten up our armor
[1:16:21] may we be ready for it Lord by your
[1:16:23] grace
[1:16:25] or may we hold study with the word of
[1:16:27] God an old study with the love of God
[1:16:29] may we stand Lord we're upon the
[1:16:32] flat-footed the strong strength of the
[1:16:34] revelation of God the rock of Revelation
[1:16:37] set me up there Lord let me stand no
[1:16:41] matter what comes our way
[1:16:43] Lord today if there's any heart that's
[1:16:45] listening in from
[1:16:47] the broadcast or someone streaming in
[1:16:50] this building here this morning that has
[1:16:52] not made a stand for you
[1:16:54] they understand it they see it they they
[1:16:57] agree with it Lord but they haven't made
[1:16:59] a stand yet
[1:17:00] oh father I pray they'd find that altar
[1:17:04] today Lord
[1:17:06] give their heart to you holy to you
[1:17:09] make a full Stand For You Lord like
[1:17:11] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:17:13] strong stand that if God is able to
[1:17:16] deliver us but if he doesn't we're not
[1:17:17] we're not going to bow
[1:17:20] no matter how much of the influence of
[1:17:22] the world the music of the world
[1:17:25] the entertainments of the world
[1:17:27] not going to bow to the same image of
[1:17:29] everybody else Lord I imagine the many
[1:17:33] people that day
[1:17:34] were there observing and watching maybe
[1:17:37] hundreds maybe thousands and they'd all
[1:17:39] bowed they all did what the king said to
[1:17:41] do
[1:17:42] but just three people said no it we
[1:17:44] don't agree with that we're not going to
[1:17:46] do it
[1:17:47] they're the ones all the anger was
[1:17:49] turned against
[1:17:51] what I felt that before helped me to
[1:17:53] stand in love Grace
[1:17:56] dignity and courtesy
[1:17:59] respect for people no matter how much
[1:18:02] they lash out let me maintain my
[1:18:05] respective courtesy and pray for that
[1:18:07] soul
[1:18:09] they could find the same Deliverance
[1:18:10] Lord that Shadrach Meshach and Abigail
[1:18:13] found standing on your worm
[1:18:17] Lord you'll take us through every storm
[1:18:19] we'll Brave them Lord
[1:18:21] because our anchor holds within the veil
[1:18:25] you take these Hearts this morning each
[1:18:27] one every one of them including my own
[1:18:29] you lead us as a Shepherd towards the
[1:18:33] strength that we need to face
[1:18:36] the cowards coming ahead
[1:18:38] we ask it Lord in the name of the Lord
[1:18:40] Jesus Christ
