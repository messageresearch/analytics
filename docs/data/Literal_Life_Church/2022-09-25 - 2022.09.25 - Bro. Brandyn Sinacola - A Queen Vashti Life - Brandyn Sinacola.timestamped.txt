[0:00] just a reminder that we have our fall
[0:03] Fellowship October 15th and there's a
[0:06] sign up sheet for the Sisters in the

[1:40] it was just a long drive for us so but I
[1:44] appreciate everyone
[1:45] it was kind of funny getting to the
[1:48] center Cola side I remember a

[1:58] how to play it but a bunch of old guys
[2:00] with uh well I won't tell you everything

[2:40] and I kid you not I I always never in my
[2:43] life that I expect somebody to sound

[2:50] in towards me and I said Dad I think
[2:51] that's cousin Jerry I just remembered
[2:53] him from being little

[4:01] also vashti the queen
[4:04] Made A Feast for the women in the Royal
[4:06] house with which belonged to King
[4:08] ahazarus on the seventh day when the
[4:12] heart of the King was Mary with wine
[4:14] he must have been Italian
[4:17] he commanded and I'm just going to skip
[4:19] the names for your sake
[4:22] the seven chamberlains that served in
[4:24] the presence of ahazarus the king
[4:27] to bring vashti the queen before the
[4:29] king with the Crown Royal to show the
[4:31] people and the princes her beauty for
[4:33] she was fair to look on
[4:35] and the queen vashti refused to come at
[4:37] the king's commandment by his
[4:39] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[4:42] wrath and his anger burned in him
[4:45] then the king said to the wise men which
[4:47] knew the times for so was the king's
[4:49] manner towards all that he that knew the
[4:51] law and judgment
[4:53] and the next unto him was
[4:55] and he lists these seven princes of
[4:58] Persia and Meda
[5:00] which saw the king's face in which sat
[5:03] the first in the Kingdom
[5:05] what shall we do unto the queen vashti
[5:07] according to the law because she hath
[5:09] not performed the Commandment of the
[5:11] king of zarus by the chamberlains
[5:14] and memican answered before the king and
[5:16] the princes
[5:18] vashti the queen hath not done wrong to
[5:21] the king only but also to all the
[5:23] princes and to all the people that are
[5:25] in all the provinces of King ahazarus
[5:28] for this deed of the queen shall come
[5:30] abroad unto all women
[5:32] so that they shall despise their
[5:34] husbands and their eyes when it shall be
[5:37] reported the king arthrus commanded
[5:39] vashti the queen to be brought in before
[5:41] him but she came not likewise shall the
[5:44] ladies of the Persia and Mita say this
[5:46] day unto all the kings princes
[5:49] which have heard of the deed of the
[5:51] queen thus shall there arise too much
[5:54] contempt and Wrath
[5:55] if it pleased the king Let There Go a
[5:58] royal commandment from him and let it be
[6:00] written among the laws of the Persians
[6:02] and the medes that it be not altered
[6:04] that vashti come no more before King
[6:07] ahazarus and let the King give her Royal
[6:09] Estate unto another that is better than
[6:12] sheep
[6:13] and when the Kings decree which he shall
[6:16] make shall be published throughout all
[6:18] his Empire for it is great all the wives
[6:21] shall give to their husbands honor both
[6:23] to Great and Small
[6:24] and the saying please the king and the
[6:26] princes and the King did according to
[6:28] the word of memokin
[6:30] for he sent letters and to all the
[6:32] king's provinces into every Province
[6:34] according to the writing thereof and to
[6:37] every people after their language that
[6:40] every man should bear rule in his own
[6:42] house and that it should be published
[6:45] according to the language of every
[6:46] people
[6:48] let's pray and just as we pray if if you
[6:51] want to be remembered in prayer just
[6:53] lift your hand before the Lord
[6:56] Heavenly Father we come before you

[7:03] Lord I pray God that when we fail you
[7:06] father that you would listen to our
[7:07] hearts and
[7:09] and hear our spirit seeing as the song
[7:12] says father
[7:14] Lord we're just mortal men and women and
[7:18] and we fail much but we love you Lord
[7:20] and we're here to hear from you
[7:23] and so I pray God that you would help me
[7:25] to get out of the way and that
[7:28] and that you would speak to us Lord
[7:31] speak to our hearts receive our worship
[7:34] let us be pleasing in your sight Lord
[7:38] dress us now in your word we pray and
[7:41] bless every need behind every hand I
[7:43] pray as the word Goes Forth
[7:45] that you would answer everyone
[7:48] be with the brothers as they travel home
[7:50] from the men's meeting Lord
[7:52] give them traveling Mercies in Jesus
[7:54] Christ's name
[7:56] amen
[7:57] amen you can be seated
[8:03] I was I was wanting to go uh one One
[8:07] Direction and and I started in that
[8:09] direction but as I
[8:11] as I got to studying last night it just
[8:14] seemed like the Lord took me in this
[8:15] other direction so
[8:17] um I haven't done my notes how I usually
[8:19] do I hate notes anyway
[8:21] so if this just goes kaplop then
[8:24] um I don't know what to say
[8:27] but I've been real inspired
[8:29] um
[8:30] brother Paul got a new sign in his
[8:33] office and and it it's where Mordecai
[8:36] tells Esther for such a time as this and
[8:39] and that was inspiring enough and then
[8:41] and then I heard something in a message
[8:43] and I just want to save that because
[8:46] um it looks like Lord willin we might be
[8:48] speaking
[8:49] um January 1st and now I'll be speaking
[8:51] to an empty congregation because I gave
[8:53] the data just kidding
[8:56] um
[8:56] because I'd be preaching but I just want
[8:59] to hold that because it just felt like a
[9:00] good message for maybe the new year but
[9:03] I've been inspired by it and then just
[9:06] finding something wholesome to watch
[9:08] with with the family and if you've never
[9:11] seen or heard of Sight and Sound it's a
[9:14] it's a great production of of gospel
[9:16] stories and
[9:18] um and they did the Book of Esther and
[9:21] I I I I I pray that I could bring some
[9:24] inspiration like they brought because it
[9:26] was just so good and and watching it and
[9:30] um some of the just some of the songs
[9:31] and the different things and watching
[9:33] this story unfold
[9:35] um you read it you can be inspired but
[9:37] there's also something when you apply a
[9:39] visual to it that just seems to help and
[9:41] so
[9:42] it just it just lit a fire and so I
[9:44] started I started going through it and I
[9:46] was just kind of all over the place
[9:48] yesterday but
[9:51] there's in the message
[9:53] um searching for even the name of Esther
[9:56] I think it only came up 15 times and
[9:59] um one of the times was speaking to a
[10:02] woman in the prayer line and and then
[10:04] the majority of that was actually in one
[10:07] message I believe it was called marriage
[10:08] of the Lamb so I was went and listened
[10:10] to that and as I was listening that's
[10:12] where I got kind of a different
[10:14] direction
[10:15] and I just it it
[10:18] astonished me to see there's actually
[10:21] the way that the the books of the Bible
[10:23] line up Esther would have fallen in
[10:26] between the time of Ezra and Nehemiah
[10:29] she would have been queen during that
[10:31] time one of the things that just
[10:33] thrilled my heart might be an odd thing
[10:36] to throw the Heart by but is in that
[10:38] Sight and Sound they're bringing history
[10:40] at one point and one of the things that
[10:43] was that I would like to get to sometime
[10:45] maybe not today is we all know Esther's
[10:48] uh Nemesis so to speak was Haman and
[10:53] Heyman actually is a descendant from the
[10:56] King that Saul let live
[10:59] the Lord told Saul destroy everything
[11:01] destroy the the men the women the
[11:04] children the cattle destroy it all don't
[11:07] leave anything
[11:08] and and Saul thinking he was doing
[11:11] something great for some reason
[11:12] disobeyed the word of the Lord and he
[11:14] let a king live and the cattle Live Well
[11:17] The Descendant from that King
[11:19] is where Haman came from
[11:22] and so you see you know it's it's just
[11:24] it's astounding to me to see that one
[11:27] Disobedience to the word of God years
[11:30] later generations later had a huge
[11:33] effect that that God's people would
[11:36] almost be completely wiped out because
[11:39] one man's disobedience
[11:41] and we can apply that to our lives and
[11:44] and maybe I want to get into that just a
[11:45] little bit later too but
[11:47] um we'll see as we go here so there's a
[11:49] lot of parallels in the Book of Esther
[11:51] and I just I'm just really enjoying it
[11:53] King of zarus from what I can find in
[11:57] the scripture
[11:58] um in one history it says the word was
[12:01] too big so I had to look it up and it
[12:03] just basically meant he was one of the
[12:05] most notable Kings Persian kings this
[12:08] king ahazarus queen Esther's husband in
[12:11] Daniel 11 2 there's a couple Kings with
[12:14] the same names in in there and from what
[12:16] I can gathered it was this King but he
[12:18] was one of the richest of of the Persian
[12:21] Empire
[12:23] a queen and and uh vashti and the other
[12:27] women in the palace in defiance a queen
[12:30] put away and rejected for her rejection
[12:32] of the king's word a beautiful branch
[12:35] predestinated and elected to be Queen
[12:37] chosen for her character a new Queen
[12:40] granted half the kingdom
[12:42] an accuser trying to destroy God's
[12:45] people and I and I just I just wrote
[12:47] those down this morning because I know
[12:49] that there's more lying in there and and
[12:50] I'm just excited to get into it a bit
[12:52] but what I saw here in in talking about
[12:55] vashti it might seem like this is a
[12:57] harsh scenario the king calls he's he's
[12:59] drunk for one
[13:01] um not saying God's a drunk but
[13:05] typing this king with with God as as you
[13:08] see his Queen Esther is a type of the
[13:10] bride and and you can watch those
[13:12] parallels so to me this King you know
[13:14] the richest and the most notable well
[13:16] there's none bigger than God there's
[13:18] none greater than God there's there's
[13:20] he's the king of kings and Lord of lords
[13:22] so there is none above Jehovah amen
[13:26] and and so you see that to begin with
[13:29] and then it was interesting this morning
[13:31] as I was reading this and it talks about
[13:33] his seven princes well over in
[13:35] Revelations you see that God has seven
[13:38] stars in his hand and and that was his
[13:41] seven Messengers and that's the exact
[13:43] same thing that this king is doing as
[13:45] he's calling on his seven Messengers his
[13:47] seven princes to get to get counsel from
[13:50] them and not not necessarily that God
[13:52] get got counsel from His prophets but he
[13:54] had seven Messengers for seven Church
[13:57] ages and and God was counseling them and
[13:59] they were counseling God's people and
[14:01] then he tells them go tell go tell
[14:04] vashti to come here go go get the queen
[14:06] ready and bring her present her before
[14:08] me and before before my kingdom and and
[14:12] this this queen it sounds harsh she said
[14:14] no and you think well he was he was
[14:16] drunk I wouldn't go either but he
[14:18] disobeyed the word and and the thing
[14:20] about the medes and Persians we've been
[14:22] taught before is that that when there's
[14:24] a law and there's a word that is issued
[14:27] before the king that is that is the word
[14:30] that is that must be obeyed and it
[14:32] cannot be changed and we know that God's
[14:34] word it must be obeyed and it cannot be
[14:37] changed what it said in the Old
[14:39] Testament it says in the New Testament
[14:41] it can run you can run it back and
[14:43] through you can't change it anyone that
[14:45] adds or takes away from it is their name
[14:48] is taken from the book of life
[14:49] regardless of what you feel about the
[14:51] word regardless of what you feel about
[14:53] that portion that God is God has spoken
[14:56] to your life if you disobey it then I
[14:59] just say be careful you you should
[15:01] repent and come back to the word
[15:04] because this this queen vashti she she
[15:06] disobeyed the word of the king she
[15:08] denied the king uh uh her presence she
[15:12] denied him uh entry into her life and
[15:15] and for that she was put away
[15:18] and we know that you can now run this
[15:20] story over into into the Book of
[15:22] Revelations when when he says he calls
[15:26] the church a harlot in in in her
[15:29] daughters and she rejected the word of
[15:31] the Lord she would have been his bride
[15:34] but he had to put her away because she
[15:36] rejected his words she didn't obey she
[15:38] she killed the prophet she disobeyed the
[15:40] law she didn't she tried she's changed
[15:43] the law she's changed the word of God
[15:45] and God says for that I'm putting you
[15:47] away you you're a harlot you're going
[15:49] you're giving yourself to another and I
[15:52] can't have you that way
[15:54] so and and then you see Esther come into
[15:56] the picture and and she's a she's a
[15:58] she's a virgin you're you're dealing
[16:00] with all these these virgins in the
[16:02] story and we know that there's five wise
[16:05] virgins and five full foolish virgins
[16:07] and and and the the five wise have their
[16:10] lamps trimmed and ready to go they're
[16:12] ready to go see the king and and and
[16:14] then there's five foolish that are
[16:16] asleep and and and and they're put away
[16:18] in in other words so
[16:21] what sounds harsh is actually all
[16:23] throughout the word of God because of
[16:25] the reaction to the word and so I just
[16:28] want to look at vashti for a little bit
[16:29] this morning
[16:31] if if the Lord will help us and and like
[16:33] I said I just didn't intend that so it
[16:35] was just it's just different for me but
[16:38] um
[16:39] she had a lack of submission for God's
[16:42] word and and what this shows is she
[16:45] wasn't connected with the King
[16:47] the king made a request for the queen
[16:49] and and any Queen you think about it
[16:52] your king is the richest in all the land
[16:54] he's the most notable and and and he's
[16:57] he's all powerful and and you would
[17:00] think it would be a a privilege to go
[17:02] before the Queen the king but this this
[17:04] queen she wasn't connected she was she
[17:07] was called Queen she was called wife but
[17:09] yet there was no there was no
[17:11] relationship there was no connection
[17:14] and we know that God doesn't want us to
[17:16] just come to church this morning and
[17:18] just sit here and and and not have a
[17:21] connection and a relationship with him
[17:22] we don't we don't and I don't want to be
[17:25] a queen a a bride that that when when
[17:28] the king calls for me that I just say
[17:30] not you know ah you know forget it
[17:34] I don't want to be that kind of bride I
[17:36] want to be a bride that says when when
[17:37] when they look on me they see the
[17:39] Majesty of the king they see the glory
[17:42] of the king
[17:43] [Music]
[17:46] so she wasn't connected she didn't have
[17:48] that
[17:50] that connection with the King that would
[17:52] have drawn her into his presence being
[17:54] summoned and and we know that later on
[17:56] in the story that it was actually she
[17:58] couldn't come before him on her own
[18:00] accord she had to be summoned to become
[18:02] before the king otherwise she was put to
[18:04] death if the king didn't Grant her mercy
[18:07] vashti could put on the crown but the
[18:09] king wanted someone who was connected
[18:11] with him who loved him who reflected who
[18:14] he was in all of his glory who was was
[18:17] uh submissive not because she had to be
[18:20] but because she wanted to be because she
[18:23] loved him
[18:24] she loved him and that was the king's
[18:27] desire and that was that was maybe some
[18:29] of why that they looked at what the what
[18:32] the uh the messenger said and they said
[18:35] you know the saying is good and and
[18:38] let's let's put it in the law let's put
[18:40] it into action because because her heart
[18:42] is far from me I I never had her heart
[18:46] she's just after the the blessing she's
[18:49] after the benefits she's after she's
[18:51] after the Miracles she's after the sign
[18:53] she's after the Wonders but but I'm
[18:56] ahead of myself but but then when we
[18:59] come to God at the there will be those
[19:00] who come to him and said have not I done
[19:02] all these things in your name did I not
[19:04] portray the blessings of of of of of you
[19:08] of your majesty did not I show your
[19:10] glory through that way and he says
[19:11] depart from me you worker of iniquity I
[19:14] never knew you
[19:15] there's no connection there's no there's
[19:18] no are you with me this morning
[19:24] the king he thought maybe that he had
[19:27] her love he thought he had her loyalty
[19:29] he thought he had her submission
[19:32] and yet the King was deceived
[19:35] the queen she just wanted the the the
[19:38] Frills of being Queen she just wanted
[19:40] the title of being Queen
[19:43] but just because you're you're you're in
[19:46] the message just because you sit in a
[19:49] message church you've heard these things
[19:50] before that doesn't make you the queen
[19:53] that doesn't make you that doesn't make
[19:56] you anything but but someone who goes to
[19:59] church
[20:01] it was it was
[20:03] difficult for me because you know you go
[20:05] and you see you see family and and it's
[20:08] a sorrowful time and things and
[20:11] and uh
[20:13] you know you try to encourage them in
[20:15] the Lord and and so they had me they had
[20:17] me talk to him after the showing on um
[20:19] Wednesday
[20:21] and and then the it's Catholic
[20:23] background so the the priest came on
[20:25] Thursday but
[20:28] um you know it was difficult because
[20:29] you're you're you're telling them you
[20:31] know it's it's it was you know it's okay
[20:34] to cry it's okay to that's what we're
[20:36] here for we're here together we're let's
[20:38] you know the love is here it's it's okay
[20:40] it's a grieve and and then the
[20:43] uh priest wasn't there so he didn't hear
[20:45] what I had to say but he contradicted
[20:48] what I said the night before when he got
[20:49] up and spoke so I thought well that
[20:51] don't make me feel too good but
[20:54] and then you know it just the the Just
[20:56] The Way of the world you know so I'm
[20:58] encouraging him and I'm saying you know
[21:00] if grieving as a gospel Minister I said
[21:03] I'm going to encourage you turn to
[21:04] Christ and I read them scripture of
[21:06] Christ is the comforter he wants to
[21:08] comfort them and then we go that night
[21:10] to my aunt's house and they're all you
[21:12] know lighting things up and and drinking
[21:14] things and and I thought well that
[21:17] I must not be much of a minister because
[21:19] that didn't that fell over like a lead
[21:22] balloon but
[21:23] but I did have a thought and brother Dan
[21:25] reminded me this morning one man sows
[21:28] another man waters you know but God
[21:30] gives the increase so I thought well
[21:31] they they heard it
[21:33] they heard it and they looked receptive
[21:35] to it um you know fear not their faces
[21:38] some of them didn't but
[21:39] but they heard it so my prayer is that
[21:42] any time that they go to turn to
[21:43] something else that the words that were
[21:46] spoken would come before their ears and
[21:47] that's my prayer
[21:50] vashti made a vow because when there's
[21:53] when there's a marriage there's there's
[21:55] um I didn't write them down but there's
[21:57] there's a
[22:00] you know there's parts to be leading up
[22:03] to a marriage there's there's a there's
[22:05] a
[22:07] promise or and then there's an
[22:09] engagement and and um I'll have to write
[22:11] this down for next time but
[22:14] but uh you know all these things and
[22:16] when it comes to The Vow the you know
[22:18] you vow your life to each other you vow
[22:21] in sickness and in health until until
[22:23] death do you part and so vashti made a
[22:27] vow but her heart wasn't in it
[22:29] she didn't mean it and you know we we
[22:32] can make vows to the Lord and and
[22:34] oftentimes we do and and I and I thank
[22:36] God for his grace and mercy because
[22:38] oftentimes we can't keep those
[22:40] because we're we're we're fallible human
[22:43] beings and and we might forget that we
[22:46] made the vow we shouldn't but we might
[22:48] forget and and we don't have the
[22:50] capacity or or our heart wasn't where we
[22:52] thought it was yet and so we make these
[22:54] vows and and and and thank God for his
[22:57] grace and mercy but vashti made a vow
[22:59] and her heart wasn't in it
[23:02] Lord I'll serve you all of my days if
[23:05] you'll do this thing I'll serve you all
[23:08] of my days and and then we forget that
[23:10] and then we backslide and then we go and
[23:12] we we entertain things of the world and
[23:14] and and we didn't keep our vow to the
[23:16] Lord and and queen vashti she didn't
[23:18] keep her vow maybe maybe it was to come
[23:21] when the king calls and that was part of
[23:22] her vow and she didn't keep it
[23:25] all these things just showing that that
[23:27] that there's a church if I can say it
[23:30] that way that that their heart's not in
[23:33] it their their heart is actually is
[23:36] drawn to the things of the world and and
[23:38] and our hearts get in those states where
[23:40] we're drawn to the things of the world
[23:41] and we're coming to church and we're
[23:43] worshiping the Lord but when we leave
[23:45] here we we kind of check the time clock
[23:47] and then we go out back to the things
[23:49] that that
[23:50] really we want to do let's just be
[23:53] honest you're drawn away by your own
[23:55] lust amen we all are and it's and it's
[23:57] something that's it's what's in your
[23:58] heart that's coming out and and so it's
[24:02] the same thing that vashti was in so she
[24:05] she she did it for the benefits not the
[24:07] love we said that
[24:09] the king wanted someone who he could who
[24:12] he could be one with
[24:14] he wanted somebody to become part of him
[24:19] he wanted an and vashti by her her
[24:24] expression here by by her actions and
[24:26] her words
[24:28] she actually almost portrays an essence
[24:31] or or a a an air about her that says the
[24:35] king is actually here for me
[24:38] the king wants what what I have and I'm
[24:41] going to withhold that
[24:43] but the scripture tells us in in First
[24:45] Corinthians 11 that man was created uh
[24:48] I'm sorry woman man wasn't created for
[24:51] the woman but woman was created for the
[24:53] man now brother you can take that and
[24:56] you can you can try to treat her like a
[24:58] doormat but you're not catching the
[24:59] image of God there either you're just as
[25:02] wrong as she is by not coming into your
[25:04] world and connecting with you but he
[25:07] wanted a man a man and and just just
[25:10] think of the brothers here and and you
[25:12] know as sisters alike you want to be one
[25:15] with your spouse you want somebody who
[25:17] who your heart is connected with it's
[25:19] not just somebody who uh you know is
[25:22] just a a
[25:24] I don't even know if I had companions
[25:26] the right word but you you know you're
[25:28] not looking for that you're longing for
[25:31] somebody to give your heart to that that
[25:33] will love you and and respect you and
[25:36] honor you and cherish you and be
[25:37] interested in your interest be
[25:39] interested in your heart but hear vashti
[25:42] by her expression she shows she wasn't
[25:44] interested in those things
[25:46] she takes on the air and and
[25:49] I'm not going to say forgive me but
[25:52] sisters we can do that sometimes as we
[25:55] can we can we can express to our
[25:57] husbands that no you were created for me
[26:00] and and that's not scriptural that's not
[26:02] the scripture that's not the way that it
[26:04] is
[26:07] it's quiet that's all right
[26:17] whatever you think about it I would just
[26:19] ask you to to look into your heart and
[26:22] ask
[26:23] if you resist that why do you resist
[26:26] that
[26:27] what what lies let's let's quit playing
[26:30] games
[26:31] let's let's quit being Queen vashti's
[26:35] let's what is in your heart that makes
[26:37] you that puts up a wall against the word
[26:39] of God what's in your heart what is that
[26:42] what is that thing that makes you
[26:43] resistant when you hear the word of God
[26:47] I understand that sometimes it could be
[26:49] the way that maybe maybe a minister said
[26:51] it or maybe maybe it was the way it was
[26:53] presented to you but if you pick up your
[26:56] Bible and you see it in your word then
[26:59] you can't deny it you can try to deny it
[27:02] you can go on denying it but really
[27:04] you're only hurting yourself
[27:06] because the King has spoken and this is
[27:09] the word and it cannot be altered or
[27:11] changed
[27:12] this went into the house of the rules as
[27:15] they call it in the scripture The House
[27:16] of the rules where when they needed when
[27:19] they when the Persian kings wanted to
[27:21] remember something they said go get it
[27:22] go find it in the house of the rules go
[27:25] find the record of it and bring it here
[27:27] I want to make sure that that's what it
[27:29] says and when you do that when you take
[27:31] that regardless of the resistance that
[27:34] you feel in your heart when you take the
[27:35] word of God and you find it in the word
[27:37] then you should ask yourself but Lord be
[27:40] honest there is absolutely nothing was
[27:42] saying wrong with saying Lord I feel a
[27:45] resistance to this and I don't know why
[27:48] or maybe you do know why present it to
[27:51] the Lord talk to the Lord about it
[27:53] listen this is a person of Jesus Christ
[27:56] this isn't some religion this isn't some
[27:58] this isn't something that we come and
[28:00] like I said and and we just come and
[28:02] check in on Sunday so we can be seen or
[28:05] so we can say feel good about ourselves
[28:07] that's I'm I'm tired of that I'm tired
[28:10] of playing church I'm tired of playing
[28:12] games I'm I'm I'm tired of of seeing
[28:16] things of the world creep up in my life
[28:18] I'm tired go that's all right sit on
[28:21] that but I'm telling you the truth
[28:22] because it's in your life too
[28:24] and we should ask ourselves Lord what's
[28:27] the resistance what why do I feel
[28:29] resistant to that what is it that's what
[28:31] you may think I'm crazy you may think I
[28:34] don't care what you think but you should
[28:36] ask yourself what is it that's doing
[28:39] that to me because something's causing
[28:41] you to resist the word of God
[28:43] there's something laying down in there
[28:45] that that you need you who knows the
[28:48] heart and the mind the scripture says
[28:50] nobody knows it save God God tries God
[28:53] knows the heart God tries the Reigns
[28:55] I've been thinking of the scripture the
[28:56] word is quick and powerful and sharper
[28:59] than any two-edged sword and what's it
[29:01] do it pierces down to the dividing of
[29:03] Thunder of Soul and Spirit
[29:06] it goes down into the heart and it and
[29:08] it separates these things for us and
[29:10] it'll tell you it'll pinpoint what's in
[29:13] your life it'll pinpoint that thing that
[29:15] that you're resistant to
[29:28] you now we know that that women has a
[29:30] woman has her apart as well she she's
[29:32] called in Genesis the eve the mother of
[29:35] Life the mother of all living
[29:37] and and it's it's true the the uh
[29:41] I I saw a little smirk on my daughter's
[29:43] face so I that's what made me stop and
[29:45] smile
[29:47] she always says well Dad
[29:49] um
[29:50] you know women can do everything men can
[29:53] do but man can't do everything women can
[29:55] do because man can't have babies and
[29:58] um
[29:58] so we'll save that conversation for
[30:00] another time but
[30:05] but Christ Christ doesn't want you to
[30:08] just come to church
[30:10] Christ doesn't want just a queen that
[30:13] that is is
[30:15] Christ doesn't want a queen that has
[30:17] everything right on the outside but has
[30:19] nothing right on the inside
[30:23] that's not what Christ is after
[30:25] that's that's not why that's not why we
[30:29] get up and we speak about modesty
[30:31] we speak about modesty we speak about
[30:33] these things because because there's
[30:35] something in the heart of God that
[30:38] doesn't he does want you to look right
[30:40] he does want you to dress right men men
[30:42] alike
[30:44] he does want that but but he wants it to
[30:47] go deeper he doesn't want a vashti to
[30:49] just put it on
[30:50] he wants a vashti or a Esther that'll
[30:53] live it out from her heart
[30:57] Christ wants to inject himself into the
[31:00] bride and I'm going to get I'm not going
[31:02] to speak plain I'll be careful here but
[31:04] Christ wants to inject his life into the
[31:07] bride Christ wants his life you can't
[31:09] live this you say but I I've tried
[31:12] brother Brandon and I've tried and I've
[31:13] tried and I've tried
[31:15] and I'm tired I'm tired of trying
[31:19] listen I know that this sounds easier
[31:21] than than what it feels like sometimes
[31:24] but quit trying
[31:27] quit trying let ask God to inject his
[31:31] life into your life so he will live it
[31:33] through you so that there's something on
[31:35] the inside of your heart that that says
[31:38] but but Lord I did that but I really
[31:40] didn't want to do that please forgive me
[31:43] and and and not you know not going out
[31:46] and living a certain way and then coming
[31:48] in and then and then feeling condemned
[31:50] sitting here and and and then getting
[31:53] upset at the preacher because he's
[31:54] preaching that way but listen if we're
[31:56] speaking the law that that God wrote in
[31:59] his Bible then then this is what cannot
[32:02] be altered and it cannot be changed it
[32:05] has to be spoke forth we us as ministers
[32:07] we have to go to the house of the rules
[32:10] we have to find what God is telling us
[32:12] go get that and bring it and read it
[32:15] before the people because they need to
[32:17] hear it
[32:18] Christ wants to inject his life the man
[32:21] and injects his life into the bride not
[32:24] the other way around she takes on his
[32:27] life she takes on his name she takes on
[32:30] his identity
[32:32] the queen here vashti the the this this
[32:35] church
[32:36] that was claiming to be the queen of in
[32:39] claiming Christianity
[32:42] she was she was taking something and she
[32:44] was saying no
[32:46] I am queen vashti I'm the queen
[32:50] he might be the king but I'm the queen
[32:53] my name is vashti not ahu
[32:57] look at it ahazarus
[33:00] it's also called Xerxes it's the same
[33:02] King
[33:05] that's that's that that's not how this
[33:08] works when a woman gets married to a man
[33:11] she she should take the man's name
[33:15] because she she's coming into that man's
[33:17] world she's coming in as as a help meet
[33:21] she's a help meet for him not the other
[33:23] way around
[33:25] now this this Brothers this doesn't mean
[33:27] that's that's not a a green light to
[33:30] treat her any way you want to
[33:32] I'll tell you what you ought to treat
[33:34] her like your queen and then she'll
[33:36] treat you like you're the king
[33:41] just thinking of the scripture Sarah
[33:42] called him Lord
[33:45] but you have to be worthy of that title
[33:47] too
[33:51] the woman takes on the man's name she
[33:53] comes into his world she comes into into
[33:55] his into his life listen
[33:58] when the prophet said that when when a
[34:01] man comes home and he's tired
[34:03] now there should be understanding I'm
[34:05] trying to bring a balance here with
[34:07] these things because you know
[34:09] for so many years it's blessed God you
[34:11] know we're the men
[34:13] well you didn't act like it
[34:16] because the real men wouldn't treat his
[34:18] wife that way
[34:19] but there's nothing like when you come
[34:22] in from work or a hard day there's
[34:24] nothing like
[34:25] you know you you know that that the
[34:29] doctors say I have high blood pressure
[34:30] and
[34:32] this might sound weird but I can have my
[34:34] blood pressure can be up I can feel it's
[34:36] up but my wife can just come over and
[34:38] start touching my shoulders and I can
[34:40] feel my blood pressure start to drop
[34:44] sister that's that's the power that you
[34:46] have
[34:47] that's the attribute that God has given
[34:50] you
[34:51] is to take to take that King
[34:53] who's having who's having a hard day
[34:55] who's who's out fighting battles amongst
[34:58] the world we know you're fighting
[34:59] battles at home too sometimes worse than
[35:02] he has to fight because you're with the
[35:04] children
[35:06] but that's why I say brother you have to
[35:08] have you have to have an understanding
[35:10] for her too but in in and you know I
[35:14] don't I don't
[35:15] I don't believe in the man just coming
[35:17] home sitting down and and then you know
[35:19] he should get up and help a little bit
[35:27] but
[35:30] there were things in Adam
[35:32] that Adam couldn't portray he couldn't
[35:35] he couldn't show
[35:37] without Eve
[35:39] but when God made Eve he didn't make a
[35:42] separate being
[35:43] he took a portion of Adam
[35:46] took her out created Eve and then took
[35:50] another portion of Adam the feminine
[35:51] spirit and put it in her
[35:54] so in every way they were body of my
[35:57] body
[35:58] Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bones
[36:01] Spirit of my spirit
[36:03] Adam was not complete without Eve
[36:06] Christ isn't complete without the bride
[36:13] but she loses herself in him she loses
[36:16] her identity
[36:17] I don't want an identity just as a
[36:20] Christian
[36:21] I want an identity of Jesus Christ
[36:24] I want an identity I want to portray
[36:27] Jesus Christ I want to portray the
[36:30] literal life of Jesus Christ I believe
[36:32] it can be the actual literal life the
[36:36] reality of God in us I believe that we
[36:39] can portray that otherwise what are we
[36:41] doing here
[36:44] Christ poured himself out into the
[36:46] church to be one with her he wants all
[36:49] of her heart he's a jealous God
[36:51] he's he's a jealous King
[36:54] he he won't tolerate you giving your
[36:57] heart just portion of it to him
[37:00] God won't tolerate that he wants all of
[37:02] you he'll take what you give him
[37:04] but he wants all of you I don't want to
[37:07] get down to the end of the road
[37:09] and when I get up to the gates I want to
[37:11] hear well done my good and faithful
[37:13] servant
[37:14] not I don't want to hear
[37:17] well
[37:18] but you didn't give me all your heart
[37:21] where was the other portion of your
[37:23] heart I wanted everything
[37:25] and and you only gave me just a little
[37:27] bit
[37:29] and we can do that to our spouses too
[37:32] where you give just a little bit of your
[37:34] heart you you want to you want it your
[37:37] way
[37:38] not the way that the word says that the
[37:40] relationship should be you want you want
[37:43] you want to receive the benefits but you
[37:45] don't want to give anything in return
[37:50] God gave his life to be reality to us
[37:54] vashti wanted to control and Lead but it
[37:57] showed that something was wrong
[37:59] because control and Lead that's that's
[38:02] the masculine spirit
[38:04] that's the what the man is supposed to
[38:06] do that's what God does in our lives he
[38:09] leads he has control he has supreme
[38:11] authority and we want him to have that
[38:14] but we have to submit to it we have to
[38:17] give that to him
[38:21] God put the put the feminine spirit in
[38:24] the woman Adam and Eve were one in both
[38:26] body and spirit connected physically and
[38:28] emotionally
[38:30] Paul said we we should not withhold our
[38:33] bodies from one another
[38:35] uh
[38:37] and neither neither should we withhold
[38:39] our hearts from one another
[38:42] brother you can't expect her to give her
[38:44] body to you and you not give your heart
[38:46] back to her
[38:48] she wants your heart and and I'll just
[38:51] say this in a in a try to say it without
[38:53] being too plain is the one really
[38:56] doesn't work well without the other
[39:00] the one is really meaningless
[39:04] and and that's and that's one thing when
[39:06] you know just as as my wife and I you
[39:10] know
[39:10] were were getting engaged and and
[39:13] married and going through life and and
[39:16] now you know talking to other couples
[39:19] and things and I I don't I don't even
[39:21] like to say
[39:23] um I don't even like to call it I hope
[39:26] this is okay I don't like to call it sex
[39:28] because that's what the world does
[39:29] that's what anybody does
[39:31] but it's different when there's love
[39:33] there
[39:34] because that's actually an expression of
[39:36] love if it's if it's right
[39:39] and you need that emotion brother you
[39:41] have to you have to show emotion you
[39:43] have to give your heart to your wife
[39:44] your wife wants to see your emotion she
[39:48] wants to see you happy she wants to see
[39:50] you excited to see her she wants your
[39:52] heart and and you should give it to her
[39:56] and if you can't then you need to go
[39:59] back and find out why can't I give my
[40:01] heart to this woman
[40:03] why can't I give my heart to this man
[40:05] what is locking you up inside what's
[40:08] keeping you from experiencing the best
[40:11] relationship that God put here on Earth
[40:13] for you what's keeping you from that ask
[40:16] yourself why am I locked why why can't I
[40:20] why can't I receive what they're trying
[40:21] to give me why can't I show what they
[40:23] want why can't I give them what they
[40:25] desire
[40:28] and those are big questions
[40:31] and who can know the heart but God
[40:36] are you still with me
[40:48] so just as man as much as the man needs
[40:51] a sexual connection the woman needs
[40:53] emotional connection just as much as we
[40:55] want the spiritual blessings Christ
[40:58] wants your heart
[41:00] Christ wants you he he wants to give the
[41:03] blessings to you
[41:04] but he wants your heart
[41:14] just skipping some of this because we've
[41:16] covered it
[41:24] you know we can turn down the Practical
[41:26] things of God's word
[41:29] we want the blessings we want the
[41:31] Miracles we want to we want to see but
[41:33] you know the Lord really really spoke to
[41:36] me and you know you think well maybe
[41:37] maybe if I could just
[41:39] see a demon and cast it out
[41:42] then that would make me feel better
[41:44] about my Christian walk or if I could
[41:46] lay hands on the sick and they recover
[41:48] then then I could believe
[41:50] but in the scripture we find that they
[41:53] said they did that
[41:55] and they weren't found part of him
[41:59] and we also find that they were doing it
[42:01] before the Holy Ghost even came
[42:04] amen
[42:14] so we don't want to accept just parts of
[42:16] God's word and throw out other parts
[42:19] when it gets practical when it's I I I
[42:21] have no
[42:24] don't get me wrong by saying this but I
[42:27] have no need
[42:29] that I know of to live every day
[42:32] knowing the deeper mysteries of God's
[42:35] word
[42:36] it doesn't unless it puts into an action
[42:39] in in a demonstration in your life then
[42:42] it's really meaningless
[42:44] it's it's just it's just knowledge at
[42:47] that point and and I don't want
[42:48] knowledge I'm tired of knowledge I want
[42:51] the reality of Jesus Christ
[42:54] so and we can't turn down the Practical
[42:57] things of a true relationship either
[42:59] you know we can we can say Amen to you
[43:03] know you your your body's not your own
[43:05] and and you know uh defraud not each
[43:08] other and and don't withhold yourself
[43:10] from each other and amen you know we can
[43:13] amen but when it comes to the Practical
[43:15] things of you know when's the last time
[43:17] you told her you loved her
[43:20] when's the last time you brought her a
[43:22] gift
[43:23] when's the last time you took her out on
[43:25] a date
[43:28] when's the last time you came and and
[43:31] you just you just sat before the Lord
[43:34] and you just said Rain On Me Lord
[43:37] when's the last time that you expressed
[43:39] your heart to to God and Father I love
[43:42] you and and I I can't imagine if this is
[43:46] sounds funny but
[43:48] I I was thinking you know through all
[43:51] this I thought man
[43:52] how cool would it have been to be you
[43:54] know full-blooded Italian
[43:58] how neat would that be and then and then
[44:00] you know you
[44:02] great uncle Cosmo and cousin Luciano and
[44:06] and I get Brandon
[44:13] that's
[44:14] but then I got to thinking about it and
[44:16] I thought but what if it didn't go the
[44:19] way that it did
[44:20] I might not be standing here today
[44:24] I may not have come across the path of
[44:27] the message or I may not have come
[44:29] across all of you
[44:32] I might have been holding the bocce ball
[44:34] in the wine and the cigar and and that's
[44:36] just that's not life to me and I'm so
[44:39] thankful that that God and you know and
[44:42] we should express that to God
[44:44] we should we should sit down and and
[44:46] thank you Lord for saving me thank you
[44:49] for the word of God thank you even
[44:51] though sometimes it cuts and it's hard
[44:53] and and and and it hurts and I have a
[44:56] hard time accepting it Lord I may not I
[44:59] may not I may be resisting this right
[45:01] now but but I do I do love your word and
[45:05] I do want it to be me that's my heart's
[45:07] desire you should express that to God
[45:10] you should you should talk to father
[45:11] about those things
[45:13] that's what in in
[45:16] you know you're I'm just trying to
[45:19] parallel for you so we can understand
[45:20] but it's just it's just your wife wants
[45:23] to hear you whisper sweet nothings she
[45:26] wants you to look at her and she wants
[45:28] you to take a walk with her
[45:30] she wants you to hold her hand
[45:32] and not a not a not a hard cold hand
[45:37] neither
[45:40] why don't you give her a little bit of
[45:41] love in your touch
[45:43] amen
[45:47] this is completely different from how I
[45:50] expected it to go
[45:59] an order was given by the king
[46:01] for wives to honor their husbands
[46:06] and that reminded me of Ephesians 5.
[46:09] husbands love your wives
[46:11] respect your husbands
[46:14] Paul getting into the Practical things
[46:16] go read Ephesians 5 sometime and then
[46:19] ask yourself
[46:20] is this just a good writing to me or am
[46:23] I doing this am I living this
[46:26] am I respecting my husband am I loving
[46:29] my wife
[46:31] what's what's your wife's love language
[46:36] what's your husband's love language
[46:41] what's God's love language
[46:44] we expect God you know I'm here I need
[46:47] to receive from you I need to receive
[46:48] from you but then when the when the when
[46:51] the minister you know calls for a
[46:53] response and you just sit there or or
[46:55] the song leader is is you know lift your
[46:59] hands before the Lord and oh but I'm so
[47:02] tired
[47:04] when the king said to come to church and
[47:06] you stay home
[47:10] that's not giving your heart to God
[47:12] that's not speaking his love language
[47:14] that's not worshiping the Lord that's
[47:16] not bringing your look of fire to be
[47:18] encouraged it's oh
[47:22] Eeyore woe is me
[47:25] life is hard
[47:28] nobody at the church likes me anyway
[47:33] have you shown yourself friendly
[47:36] what have you done to express friendship
[47:39] what have you done to go walk up and
[47:41] talk to somebody
[47:46] what have you done to sacrifice bring
[47:48] the sacrifice of praise
[47:51] I just
[47:54] I just want to worship Him
[47:56] but I don't want to just worship Him in
[47:58] song and church
[48:00] I want my life to be a worship to the
[48:02] king
[48:03] I want the king to get Glory I want him
[48:06] to look and say
[48:07] I want to bring a tear to his eye
[48:10] how many times do we cry you know Lord
[48:12] You're So Good
[48:14] father I love you
[48:17] we bring we cry but I want to bring a
[48:19] tear to God's eye
[48:21] I want him to say you know what you were
[48:23] struggling with that thing but you laid
[48:25] it down
[48:27] because you love me because you want to
[48:29] do better you want to do right you want
[48:31] to live right so you laid that thing
[48:33] down
[48:34] you listen to my word when the when the
[48:37] when the Chamberlain read the read from
[48:40] the house of rolls when he read the word
[48:42] the law you something welled up inside
[48:44] like David like like our pastor spoke
[48:47] David I love your law Lord thank you for
[48:50] your law thank you for the boundaries
[48:51] that you put in place to protect me I
[48:54] want to tell you something
[48:56] and then and and I well whatever
[49:01] quit worrying about it
[49:04] when I was
[49:06] met Tiffany
[49:09] um I was dating a girl from school
[49:11] because that's what we did
[49:13] and and I got presented with a with a
[49:16] decision that I had to make
[49:19] and and I met Tiffany and I mean it was
[49:22] you know
[49:23] she was in the Fazoli's how could I not
[49:25] love her
[49:26] so the Italian restaurant but
[49:30] no I saw her and I
[49:33] you know thought I was joking and I
[49:36] jumped up and we had one of those vans
[49:37] that you could stand up in and I jumped
[49:39] up and I looked through the window and I
[49:40] said I'm gonna marry her
[49:43] and I was just all giddy you know
[49:45] and my dad told me I my head was in the
[49:48] clouds and I wasn't worth nothing for a
[49:50] couple years
[49:52] that shouldn't end
[49:55] listen when you go out and you get a
[49:57] getaway
[49:58] I don't know why I'm on marriage so much
[50:00] today but when you go out and you get a
[50:02] getaway that should be your sweetheart
[50:05] there's to me there's there well there
[50:08] was one time when I took her out and we
[50:10] were so tired that we we parked and we
[50:12] slept
[50:16] but most times when we get to get out I
[50:18] mean it's just it's like we're on our
[50:20] honeymoon again we just love being
[50:21] together
[50:23] if you don't have that in your marriage
[50:25] it's not too late
[50:27] it's not too late work on it put a
[50:30] little effort into it
[50:32] what love language what's a love
[50:34] language go find it come ask me I'll
[50:36] give you the book you can find out what
[50:38] yours is and then and then you can drop
[50:41] hints of what yours is but you better
[50:43] find out what hers is too
[50:48] I don't even know what I was talking
[50:49] about now
[50:50] oh the decision
[50:53] and I remember I still remember I have a
[50:56] terrible memory but I remember when the
[50:58] Lord revealed to me my decision
[51:00] and I was sitting on a four-wheeler and
[51:02] I was talking to brother Ken Boos he's
[51:05] come around a little bit and I was
[51:06] talking to Ken boose and it just hit me
[51:08] like a bolt of lightning
[51:11] and and I remember you know
[51:13] like well you know they're
[51:17] I just got to thinking and I thought
[51:18] well
[51:20] the one as mayor where and
[51:22] you know skirts that are real high up
[51:25] and tight fitting and all these things
[51:28] that you know
[51:30] opposite of modesty that we're trying to
[51:32] portray here we're trying to teach here
[51:35] opposite the word of God
[51:37] and there was sister Tiffany and she was
[51:39] portraying modesty she was dressed
[51:41] modestly and this is the thought that
[51:43] struck me that made the difference for
[51:45] me
[51:46] as I thought about the the girl at
[51:48] school and then just hit me and I said
[51:51] but she's not dressing that way for me
[51:54] everybody else is getting to enjoy that
[51:56] too
[51:57] that's not what I want
[52:00] and so I present that to you just to say
[52:03] that if you're struggling with something
[52:05] in the word of God maybe look at it
[52:07] different
[52:08] look at it from that aspect instead you
[52:11] know but Lord I'm dressing for you I'm
[52:14] dressing for the king how what what is
[52:16] God's expression how would that look
[52:18] like in clothing how would that look
[52:20] like in here how would that look like in
[52:22] what I drink how would that look like if
[52:25] I walked out of the pulpit and you know
[52:28] time out I'm gonna go out this door and
[52:30] take a smoke real quick
[52:32] how would that look that wouldn't that
[52:34] doesn't portray Christ
[52:36] that doesn't portray an overcoming life
[52:38] that doesn't portray his glory to me it
[52:41] it just doesn't it's opposite so I don't
[52:44] say those things to make you feel bad
[52:46] but let's just think about it for a
[52:47] minute
[52:52] I don't know how we got on that
[52:58] brother Branham said something that I
[53:00] thought was was real good and I'm almost
[53:02] to my quotes for them in the back
[53:04] this is just paraphrasing now
[53:07] he said when Jesus when when Queen
[53:09] vashti did that and it says in the
[53:12] scripture here
[53:13] it you could see it on his face
[53:16] it made him turn red he blushed he he
[53:18] was he was frustrated he was embarrassed
[53:22] the the king turned red he didn't know
[53:24] what to do he what do I do now she
[53:27] turned me down
[53:28] he was embarrassed
[53:31] how many times do we do things that
[53:33] makes Jesus's face turn red
[53:36] how many times do do we say things do we
[53:39] partake in something that it makes it
[53:41] makes Jesus embarrassed
[53:44] and I can imagine that the devil walks
[53:46] up and says yeah but that's your bride
[53:50] I know I
[53:52] give me a minute
[53:55] let me take that in I'm embarrassed I'm
[53:57] ashamed
[53:59] I want to read to you Daniel's prayer
[54:00] real quick Daniel chapter 9.
[54:05] are you still with me I know I slowed
[54:06] down I'm coming down to a close just
[54:08] bear with me a little bit longer
[54:11] I just thought this was a beautiful
[54:13] prayer Daniel Prayed Daniel 9 verse 3
[54:16] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[54:19] seek by prayer and supplications and
[54:21] with fastings and sackcloth and Ashes
[54:23] and I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[54:25] made my confession and said oh Lord the
[54:27] great and Dreadful God keeping the
[54:29] Covenant and mercy to them that love him
[54:31] and to them that keep his Commandments
[54:34] we have sinned
[54:37] if you don't know how to repent
[54:39] just follow Daniel's lead here
[54:41] we've sinned and we've committed
[54:43] iniquity and we've done wickedly and
[54:45] have rebelled even by departing from thy
[54:48] precepts and from the judgments neither
[54:50] have we hearkened unto thy servants the
[54:52] prophets which spake in the name of our
[54:54] Kings our princes and our fathers and to
[54:57] all the people of the Land O Lord
[54:59] righteousness belongeth unto thee but
[55:01] unto us con uh confusion of faces
[55:05] as at this day to the men of Judah and
[55:08] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto
[55:10] all Israel that are near and that are
[55:12] far off through all the countries wither
[55:14] thou has driven them because of their
[55:16] trespass that they have trespassed
[55:18] against thee O Lord to us belong with
[55:21] confusion of Faith to our Kings to our
[55:24] princes to our fathers because we have
[55:26] sinned against thee
[55:28] he's acknowledging Lord we've we've
[55:30] embarrassed you
[55:31] we have absolutely embarrassed you
[55:35] you you the the even the Heathen
[55:38] expected more out of us and we've
[55:40] completely embarrassed you and he's
[55:42] saying Lord we deserve what you've given
[55:44] us we deserve everything that we're
[55:46] receiving right now we deserve to be
[55:48] scattered we deserve to not have Kings
[55:50] set up we deserve to not have our
[55:52] Jerusalem
[55:54] to the Lord Our God belongs mercies and
[55:57] forgiveness though we have rebelled
[55:59] against him neither have we obeyed the
[56:01] voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[56:03] laws which he set before us by his
[56:07] servants the prophets
[56:09] yea all Israel have transgressed thy law
[56:12] even by departing that they may not obey
[56:15] thy voice therefore the curse is poured
[56:17] out upon us in the oath that is written
[56:19] in the law of Moses the servant of God
[56:21] because we have sinned against him and
[56:23] he hath confirmed his words which he
[56:26] spake again against us and against our
[56:28] judges that judged Us by bringing upon
[56:31] us a great evil for under the whole
[56:33] Heaven hath not been done as have been
[56:36] done upon Jerusalem as it is written in
[56:39] the law of Moses all this evil has come
[56:41] upon us yet made we not our prayer
[56:43] before the Lord Our God that we might
[56:46] turn from our iniquity and understand
[56:48] thy truth
[56:51] let me just skip down here because
[56:55] verse 16.
[56:57] oh Lord according to all thy
[56:59] righteousness I beseech thee let thy
[57:01] anger and thy Fury be turned away from
[57:03] the city Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain
[57:05] because for our sins and for the
[57:07] iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and
[57:09] thy people are become a reproach to all
[57:11] that are about us
[57:13] now therefore o our Lord hear the prayer
[57:16] of thy servant and his supplications and
[57:18] cause thy face to shine upon thy
[57:20] Sanctuary that is desolate for the
[57:22] Lord's Sake O my God incline thine ear
[57:25] and hear upon thine eyes and behold our
[57:27] desolation in the city which is called
[57:29] by thy name for we do not present our
[57:32] supplications before thee for our
[57:33] righteousness but for thy great mercies
[57:36] O Lord hear O Lord forgive O Lord
[57:39] hearken and do defer not for thine own
[57:42] Sake O my God for thy City and thy
[57:46] people are called by thy name
[57:48] Daniel's crying out to the Lord
[57:50] repenting
[57:51] father I'm sorry for the way that I've
[57:54] lived this life I'm sorry for the things
[57:56] I've done and called myself a Christian
[57:58] while doing it
[58:06] if you want to pull up that first quote
[58:07] I'll bring it down to a close here
[58:19] starts with but but now
[58:24] foreign
[58:28] but now what if this woman gets married
[58:30] takes all these vows and everything and
[58:32] she becomes this man's husband
[58:34] and she's heir to all he's got and so
[58:37] forth and then she goes wild she starts
[58:39] off on a tantrum she starts off running
[58:41] after other men
[58:43] not only that but she's sharing her love
[58:45] with others a man with his wife all the
[58:47] promises that they has made and then she
[58:50] goes out and starts sharing her life
[58:51] with others her love and her affection
[58:53] with others
[58:57] foreign
[58:59] that's what too many so-called
[59:01] Christians do sharing your love with the
[59:03] world playing dancing gambling staying
[59:06] home from prayer meetings to watch
[59:07] television all kinds of worldly things
[59:10] that took the place of the love of God
[59:11] and the church's heart she's gone on a
[59:14] tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out
[59:16] after other men she is sharing her love
[59:19] she'll take her tithing that she should
[59:22] give unto the church she'll spend it on
[59:24] other things out there in the world
[59:26] so instead of loving God the way she
[59:28] should do and living for God and loving
[59:30] to come to church you almost have to
[59:32] persuade her to come
[59:34] if you have to be persuaded to come to
[59:36] church there's something wrong
[59:39] there's something wrong there's
[59:41] something wrong in your heart
[59:46] and he told me
[59:49] next quote
[59:50] oh you had it I'm sorry at the bottom
[59:53] and he told me about that signing those
[59:56] pledges a minister had sent out cards to
[59:58] get pledges just trying to get people to
[1:00:00] come to church
[1:00:02] and I said Dr Brown
[1:00:05] do you think that Wildcat player on the
[1:00:08] radio
[1:00:09] some singer or something that was doing
[1:00:11] a concert do you think he'd have to make
[1:00:13] that girl sign a pledge
[1:00:16] that she would be over there that night
[1:00:18] not at all
