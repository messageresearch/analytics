[3:14] head and it's all coming down brother
[3:18] the go and lift up your
[3:22] head lift up
[3:28] your
[3:30] for the children of Israel shall abide
[3:34] many days without a king and without a
[3:38] prince and without a sacrifice and
[3:41] without an image and without an ethod
[3:45] and without a teraphim now I won't have
[3:47] time today to break all those down but
[3:50] just catch the simple theme the children
[3:52] of Israel got so away from God they
[3:55] didn't have a king anymore they didn't
[3:57] have a sacrifice anymore and all many of
[4:00] these things are elements that God gave
[4:04] the people to connect with God Amen
[4:08] these are some of these are essential
[4:10] elements to connect with God and when
[4:13] they rebelled and got away from him it
[4:15] removed all of these connections to God
[4:17] that they were without any of these
[4:19] connections without a king without
[4:22] leadership without a prince without a
[4:24] sacrifice and like it was sung about the
[4:26] blood of Jesus Christ if we remove the
[4:29] True Blood of Jesus Christ we're without
[4:31] that we are in trouble that's right amen
[4:34] their sacrifice was removed their King
[4:36] was removed right but here's
[4:39] Redemption just in two verses we see it
[4:41] verse five afterward shall the children
[4:45] of Israel return and seek the Lord their
[4:49] God and David their King and shall fear
[4:54] the lord and his goodness in the last
[4:58] days but I look at the conditions of
[5:01] some people and what they're going
[5:02] through and but yet I see a desire very
[5:07] common in many people that are coming
[5:10] and staying close to the word no matter
[5:12] what conditions they're in there's a
[5:15] desire common in many and it's it's
[5:17] seeking out this King it's seeking to be
[5:20] in the presence of the king the seeking
[5:23] within God's people you know the within
[5:26] God's people they're seeking the Lord
[5:29] and seeking the king doesn't stop with
[5:31] just
[5:34] salvation we don't stop seeking the Lord
[5:36] After we receive salvation some of you
[5:38] were saved when you were a child maybe
[5:41] or maybe when you're 16 or maybe last
[5:43] year but we don't stop seeking after we
[5:47] get receive
[5:48] salvation seeking the Lord does not stop
[5:51] when we're Sanctified can you say Amen
[5:54] seeking the Lord it does it doesn't end
[5:57] even after years of being in in church I
[6:00] don't think our seeking the Lord should
[6:02] end because we've been in church for
[6:04] years seeking is not
[6:07] over seeking does not is not over
[6:11] because Deliverance is not
[6:15] over correct if we still need
[6:18] Deliverance then we still need to seek
[6:20] God because there more is more of of God
[6:23] can you say amen and when there's more
[6:25] of God when there's a deep calling to
[6:27] the Deep there's a deep to respon on
[6:30] otherwise we probably wouldn't even be
[6:32] here this morning there has to be a
[6:34] seeking I hope you're not here for just
[6:36] a religious duty but I hope there's
[6:38] something in your heart seeking more of
[6:40] the king seeking more of God can you say
[6:43] m because seeking him doesn't end with
[6:45] salvation it doesn't end with
[6:47] sanctification seeking him doesn't even
[6:50] end after you receive the Holy Ghost
[6:52] there's more and when the deep is
[6:54] calling to the deep that shows there's a
[6:56] deep to respond somewhere that's right
[7:00] am and I would say it give us the
[7:02] benefit of the doubt we're here and we
[7:04] wouldn't be here unless we were seeking
[7:06] him
[7:08] more and we're going to keep
[7:11] seeking they talk about these Seeker
[7:13] friendly churches anybody ever heard of
[7:16] that Seeker friendly churches and they
[7:18] adapt everything for the Seeker but it's
[7:20] all what they're seeking if they're
[7:22] seeking more rock and roll then we
[7:24] provide rock and roll for them if
[7:26] they're seeking more of worldly living
[7:28] and still sit in church and so it's a
[7:30] Seeker friendly well we're we're we're
[7:33] the true Seeker Friendly
[7:35] Church and for a soul that's hungry for
[7:38] God we preach the word of God
[7:40] unrestricted can you say amen and if
[7:44] you're seeking for more of God and and
[7:46] less of denomination then you need to
[7:48] come out of that denomination come out
[7:50] of religion can you say amen and find a
[7:53] church that's truly Seeker friendly it
[7:55] can meet the needs in your life Lord
[7:58] that your grow going by seeking does not
[8:00] end because Deliverance is not over yet
[8:03] your deliverance did not end when he
[8:05] delivered you from
[8:07] alcohol your deliverance did not end
[8:10] when he delivered you from cigarettes or
[8:12] adultery your deliverance wasn't over
[8:15] right did you know that your full
[8:18] Deliverance did not end when you
[8:20] received the Holy Ghost there are some
[8:22] preachers that preach us preach it that
[8:24] way that your deliverance was over but
[8:25] I'm here to tell you your deliverance
[8:27] isn't over and so you're seeking of more
[8:29] of him isn't over cuz there's there's
[8:32] still things that don't get talked about
[8:34] a lot and we really need to be delivered
[8:36] from them maybe gossip
[8:39] or maybe possession
[8:42] minded the Love of
[8:44] [Music]
[8:46] Money religion Pride can you say Amen
[8:50] but I'm a Believer I have the Holy Ghost
[8:52] well we still need deliverance from
[8:54] things and if you've got them all
[8:56] covered the very fact you're still in
[8:58] this body shows you need to be delivered
[9:01] from this
[9:02] body so we still need
[9:06] Deliverance son of man Son of God Son of
[9:10] David Prophet priest and King Jesus is
[9:15] all of
[9:16] them Eagle lamb and
[9:22] lion you can say it any way you want to
[9:24] say it here Eagle lamb and lion if I can
[9:26] say it this way just get more specific
[9:30] now number one the washing of the water
[9:33] of the word by a
[9:35] prophet number two the intercessory
[9:38] blood of a lamb by a priest Jesus
[9:42] Christ and number three the character of
[9:45] a king coming
[9:48] forth this is our
[9:51] message and I'll get to it in a minute
[9:53] if I get to it when you look at the
[9:54] nativity scene all over right now after
[9:58] yesterday I'm looking at nativity scenes
[10:00] all together different because I'm
[10:02] looking at a baby which they didn't
[10:05] expect God to
[10:06] send but in that baby was the whole
[10:12] package son of
[10:14] man Son of
[10:16] God Son of David it was all
[10:20] there hallelujah hallelujah and when he
[10:23] sent this word at the last days and
[10:24] repeated son of man again it should
[10:26] alert us to the fact that God when he
[10:29] send something he's not going to just
[10:30] send one thing but resident within that
[10:33] word is Son of Man Son of
[10:37] God and Son of David to get us ready for
[10:40] a millennium it's all Jesus Christ the
[10:43] washing of the water and and and get
[10:45] this now your Old Testament you read
[10:47] your Old Testament oh but I don't
[10:49] understand this here it is you know here
[10:51] he comes as Prophet priest and King and
[10:53] did you know as you read through 1st
[10:55] Samuel 1st Chronicles 2 Chronicles you
[10:57] read through all these you know what the
[10:58] theme is
[11:00] is a
[11:02] lamb priest right prophets
[11:07] right and a
[11:10] king he's speaking something he's saying
[11:13] something the theme is pointing to that
[11:16] baby Jesus Christ I'm going to do
[11:19] something here I always like to say it
[11:21] this way in the Old Testament God was
[11:24] trying to say something but when Jesus
[11:27] came he was what God was trying to say
[11:30] the whole time he was everything God was
[11:32] trying to say this is what God looks
[11:35] like in a human being and if he looks
[11:38] that way and I say Lord bring Jesus in
[11:41] me he's going to look that way in your
[11:43] life the Old Testament it's Prophet
[11:45] there's a lamb that's slain there's a
[11:47] lamb there's a priest bringing the lamb
[11:50] all that's Jesus Christ that's right and
[11:52] then there's a king amen and all of
[11:55] these things were speaking of what the
[11:58] one thing God God would send that we
[12:00] would need and that is the king but when
[12:02] they looked at that baby it was it was
[12:05] not only the king but everything would
[12:07] be in that baby everything would be
[12:09] there so when he sent a prophet and and
[12:12] even when you're
[12:14] entering when you're entering the um the
[12:17] the tent the Tabernacle of God you know
[12:21] they had a place on the outside and so
[12:23] you're approaching to get into the
[12:25] Throne of God to get into his presence
[12:27] so you come first to the the table and
[12:29] you wash there and the sacrifice is
[12:31] washed God sends a prophet for the
[12:33] washing of the Water by the word but
[12:35] you're not done yet that's right then
[12:37] you go into the tent and then you got
[12:39] the different things you go there for
[12:41] for for sanctification the priest is
[12:44] inside that inner part and the priest
[12:46] prepares himself to enter for you that's
[12:49] the Old Testament in the Old Testament
[12:51] the priest enters that throne room for
[12:54] you with the sacrifice after Calvary we
[12:58] have arriv right to enter the throne
[13:00] room ourselves that's why he says in
[13:01] Revelations 3 he says I have overcome
[13:04] you will overcome and to him that
[13:06] overcometh I will grant to sit with me
[13:08] in my Throne as I have overcome and sin
[13:10] so this thing isn't about about Jesus
[13:12] it's all about Jesus but it's about you
[13:14] coming to kingship and priesthood that's
[13:17] right with him that's right you don't
[13:20] it's approach to the Lord approach the
[13:22] Lord you have a priest there you have a
[13:24] lamb there you have a prophet there and
[13:27] then you come into the royal in her veil
[13:30] yeah royalty kingship the throne
[13:34] everything speaks of this baby that was
[13:37] born that was the whole package that had
[13:40] everything within it when you looked at
[13:43] it that's right the washing of the word
[13:45] by a prophet intercession Blood by a
[13:47] lamb and a priest he actually was our
[13:49] lamb the character of King in other
[13:52] words our high priest Jesus Jesus Christ
[13:54] he was not only the high priest but he
[13:56] became the lamb too that's right this is
[13:58] my Christmas service so turn to Matthew
[14:01] Chapter
[14:02] 2 look at these
[14:05] fellas they traveled all the way across
[14:08] the
[14:09] desert Matthew Chapter
[14:11] 2 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[14:14] of Judea in the days of Herod the king
[14:17] behold there came a wise man from the
[14:18] east of Jerusalem saying where is he
[14:22] that's born King of the Jews for we have
[14:23] seen his star in the east and are come
[14:25] to worship him when Herod the king had
[14:27] heard these things he was troubled and
[14:28] all Jerusalem with him and when he had
[14:31] gathered all the chief priests and
[14:33] scribes of the people together he
[14:35] demanded of them where Christ should be
[14:37] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[14:39] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[14:41] prophet and thou Bethlehem and the land
[14:43] of Judah are not the least among the
[14:44] princes of Judah for out of thee shall
[14:46] come the governor Thou shalt rule My
[14:49] People Israel then Herod when he had
[14:51] privately called the wise men inquired
[14:53] of them D diligently what time to start
[14:55] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[14:57] and said go and search diligently for
[14:59] the young child and when he have found
[15:01] him bring me me word again that I may
[15:03] come and worship him also when they had
[15:06] heard the king they departed and lo the
[15:08] star which was saw in the East went
[15:10] before them till it came and stood over
[15:13] where the young child
[15:15] was praise the
[15:19] Lord one of God's Bibles was the heavens
[15:22] they didn't have a Bible like
[15:24] yours but you know they didn't go to the
[15:27] internet to try to find where the King
[15:30] was
[15:31] coming but one thing for sure they were
[15:33] seeking the true king that's right this
[15:37] morning just ask yourself am I seeking
[15:40] the true king and the true leadership in
[15:41] my
[15:43] life and uh there's a there's a
[15:45] statement up there those that got the
[15:48] slides when we go we're when we're
[15:51] seeking where last place you should go
[15:54] is to the
[15:55] internet right and Google it can you say
[15:57] Amen we can't trust anything can you say
[16:01] Amen am
[16:02] amen and even Abraham
[16:05] Lincoln said something about it I found
[16:08] that in Tennessee I thought it'd be
[16:09] pretty cool to incorporate in one of my
[16:12] sermons I have a lot of fun I enjoy
[16:17] life and even though Abraham Lincoln
[16:19] didn't say that when we're seeking God
[16:22] we don't Google
[16:24] it do what I was saying this morning get
[16:27] your Bible that's right get the
[16:30] message that's
[16:34] right these guys didn't Google it these
[16:37] guys didn't they went to the Bible they
[16:39] went to the heavens and it be to show
[16:41] them and the star when they heard verse
[16:44] 9 the king they departed Lo the star
[16:46] which they saw the East went before them
[16:47] till it came and stood over the young
[16:49] child when they saw the star they
[16:51] rejoiced with exceeding great joy why
[16:54] because they were seeking a king they
[16:56] were seeking the king and they were all
[16:58] already rejoicing when they found the
[17:00] star because the right star LED them to
[17:03] the right
[17:04] king that's right this wasn't just
[17:06] another baby this was going to be their
[17:07] King that they were seeking their entire
[17:09] lives maybe you sought him for your
[17:11] whole life but tell you I tell you you
[17:13] ought to Rejoice this morning if you
[17:15] found the right star that's leading you
[17:17] to the
[17:20] king they Rejoice with exceeding great
[17:22] joy and when they were coming to the
[17:24] house they saw the young child with Mary
[17:26] his mother and fell down and worshiped
[17:27] him and when they had opened their
[17:29] Treasures they presented unto him gifts
[17:32] gold frankincense and myrr and being
[17:35] warned of God in a dream that they
[17:36] should not return to Herod they departed
[17:38] into their own country another way
[17:39] whenever we come before the king we want
[17:41] to bring something to him and the gifts
[17:43] that they brought to him reflected what
[17:46] they thought of him they had a
[17:47] revelation of everything that was in
[17:50] this baby or this two-year-old child as
[17:52] should say they had a revelation and
[17:54] their gifts that they brought their life
[17:57] that they brought reflect Ed what they
[17:59] said that he was right truth and he goes
[18:03] back to Prophet priest and King deity is
[18:06] a king gold represents deity
[18:10] frankincense is service the priest
[18:14] that's right myrr is death the lamb
[18:18] would die for us that's right even their
[18:21] gifts reflected who this baby was going
[18:24] to
[18:25] be it's not going to be that we're
[18:27] looking for a politician or we're
[18:29] looking for another type of King like
[18:31] Israel saying we want a king like the
[18:33] world we want leadership like they have
[18:35] all that was finished after we seen what
[18:37] Saul did and all of his me mess up and
[18:40] every even though he was anointed he
[18:42] kept messing up and God says it's time
[18:44] for me to give the true leadership to my
[18:47] people in this message it's time for the
[18:49] true leadership to come and it's not
[18:51] about men it's about the King Jesus
[18:55] Christ it's time for my people to get
[18:58] that
[18:59] and there'll be the son of David in that
[19:02] baby is the son of David in that baby is
[19:04] the son of man in that baby is the whole
[19:07] package the Son of God everything can
[19:10] you imagine if you'd have lived in that
[19:12] day and been there worshiping with the
[19:14] wise men which I believe if you have a
[19:16] revelation you would have been
[19:18] there but can you imagine there they're
[19:20] already rejoicing at the star they're
[19:22] already bowing and worshiping at the
[19:24] little baby that baby hasn't done
[19:26] anything yet right
[19:29] he hasn't done anything yet he hasn't
[19:31] healed anybody
[19:33] yet he hasn't had his ministry yet he
[19:35] hasn't been a prophet to rebuke yet he
[19:37] hasn't rebuked all the denominational
[19:39] systems yet he has not come in the
[19:41] office of Son of God where he fills
[19:42] people with the holy spirit yet he has
[19:44] not come as a king
[19:46] yet none of that's been manifested and
[19:49] yet they could look by Revelation amen
[19:52] and say it's all here CU remember he
[19:56] said they sought David the king in the
[19:58] last days they sought the Lord that's
[20:00] right and there's a baby and every the
[20:02] whole thing is there everything is there
[20:04] that's right you know I preached a few
[20:06] weeks ago on the
[20:08] potentials sometimes God gives you
[20:10] Revelations of the potential that lays
[20:12] with them something hey look at our
[20:14] Bibles here you get into this word you
[20:17] young people and everyone else you start
[20:20] getting into this don't underestimate
[20:22] the potential and the power of living a
[20:25] life in the scriptures that's right amen
[20:29] hallelujah and some of you don't know
[20:31] because you never been there you never
[20:32] experienced it yet we got a few real
[20:34] bible-based people in the church and I
[20:36] like them in the
[20:37] church if you become real bible-based
[20:40] and bathe yourself in this word you
[20:42] don't realize the power that's in that
[20:44] that's right can you say amen and you
[20:47] see things in potential form even if you
[20:49] don't see something that you need to
[20:51] Jesus to manifest in your life yet for
[20:54] deliverance if you're looking at the
[20:56] right thing all the potential is there
[20:59] for all Deliverance if you're looking at
[21:01] the wrong thing you don't have the
[21:02] potential for it but when you're looking
[21:03] at that baby you have the potential of
[21:05] all healing you had the potential of all
[21:07] Redemption you had the potential of the
[21:09] Lamb going to Calvary you had the
[21:10] potential of all your sins being taken
[21:12] away can you say
[21:14] amen and he was going to do all that and
[21:17] he did do all that he endured the cross
[21:20] you know what go Jesus said I would and
[21:22] did that I fulfilled that office of lamb
[21:25] and because because not because you're
[21:29] worthy but
[21:31] because I love you so
[21:34] much I made you worthy that's right amen
[21:38] you were worth it we had our anniversary
[21:42] last week and
[21:43] U we were out of town a couple days
[21:46] and so I wanted to take on Friday I
[21:49] wanted to take my wife to a nice place
[21:52] so we chose this Ruth Chris
[21:56] Steakhouse and uh
[21:59] so I had been a couple times before many
[22:02] years but I didn't realize how much the
[22:03] prices had gone
[22:06] up till we open the
[22:10] menus
[22:13] so so we open it up and we start looking
[22:16] at things
[22:17] and I'm praise the Lord all
[22:21] right so you have to you you start
[22:25] weighing the value of things
[22:28] the value of this
[22:33] woman I
[22:35] know and I'm I just struggled just a
[22:37] little
[22:41] bit and we can joke around about this
[22:44] and I did I I reached over to her and I
[22:46] said really enjoy this because it'll be
[22:49] another 28 years of mar before we come
[22:51] back to this restaurant again I said
[22:54] that to you didn't I so we joke
[22:55] around she was kind of you know
[22:58] surprised at it too you know 60 70 $80
[23:00] just for the steak wow
[23:04] so we we ordered we did and I have to
[23:07] say the value of the food I mean I
[23:09] haven't tasted food like it was
[23:10] tremendous it was worth every dime as
[23:12] far as that goes it was really good and
[23:15] and so then you know crunch time came
[23:18] and we were going to and so the and this
[23:20] place is real I mean we didn't know how
[23:22] which Forks to use anyway we got towards
[23:25] the end and the waiter went in the back
[23:27] room and he was gone for quite a while
[23:29] and I said
[23:30] hun this is our chance to kind of scoot
[23:33] out the door before he comes back with
[23:35] the
[23:36] bill I would not do that all the
[23:39] children listening I would not do that
[23:40] but I can't say that the thought didn't
[23:43] come to
[23:47] me but I'll say
[23:49] publicly and I won't tell you what the
[23:51] bill was but she's worth every
[23:55] dime worth every dime
[24:01] amen mean that with all my heart it's
[24:04] the least I can do for her who she is in
[24:06] character and that's what our hearts is
[24:08] towards the Lord and that's what his
[24:10] heart is towards us I went to Calvary
[24:13] because you were worth it to me
[24:16] hallah I I went as the lamb because you
[24:19] were worth it to me how about Matthew
[24:21] chapter 1 and
[24:23] verse when he speaks to
[24:26] Joseph Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus
[24:28] Christ was on this wise when as his Mary
[24:30] Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[24:32] before they came together she was found
[24:34] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[24:36] her husband being a just man not willing
[24:38] to make her a public example was minded
[24:40] to put her away privately but while he
[24:41] thought on these things behold the angel
[24:44] of the Lord appeared to him in a dream
[24:46] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[24:50] to take unto thee Mary thy wife you see
[24:52] he was dealing with his fear he was
[24:54] dealing with his fear for that which is
[24:56] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[25:00] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[25:03] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[25:08] save his people from their sins that's
[25:12] right I want to simplify all of this
[25:15] that I've said this morning to you when
[25:17] he
[25:18] comes it's for one purpose
[25:21] amen he will save his people from all of
[25:26] their sins

[25:31] package was there when you look at God's
[25:33] word that he sends he will take care of
[25:36] it all you don't have to take some of
[25:37] the message and some of this and some of
[25:39] that it's it's provided in the
[25:42] atonement and he shall save his people
[25:45] from their sins that's my Christ today

[26:39] Revelation yes he's holding that
[26:43] baby and he his tears coming down his
