Because of Jesus, I have been changed. Because of Jesus, I have been [Music] changed because of Jesus. I have been changed. [Music] Luke chapter 18 and verse one. And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow trouble troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming, she weary me." This is a parable of a judge here that this widow kept coming and kept coming and did not give up and kept kept bringing her uh need. And we'll talk about this a little further tonight, but because of her continual coming and finally a judge that actually did not regard man or fear God, it actually worked on him to finally come through and stand for the woman. So he says in verse 5, I emphasize again, because this widow troubleeth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith, and shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? And I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." This is actually goes into a prophecy for the end time, this parable, because he's actually asking when the son of man comes at the coming of the Lord, will he find this kind of faith when he comes? This faith that won't quit. This faith that keeps coming to the judge, this faith that will not be turned down. That's the kind of faith we need towards God. Last couple services we showed that God doesn't care by just saying he cares and putting his hand on your shoulder and say, "I care." God is a supernatural God that wants to care by doing something different to change the situation. I'm just laying that foundation again so you understand why we're on this series and talking about it. God stepping into the situation is how he shows he cares. Changing, creating, uh doing the impossible, doing the supernatural. And then we find there's another side to it. But he he's stepping in to show that he cares. But he does it because the right thing on your side, on the believer's side, the right attitude, the right atmosphere, uh the right openness, the right honesty, the right sincere confession. You'll find all of these things in the message. There are things that we bring as a as an attitude that show we care about a caring God. We care about getting help. We're not running from it, but we're running towards it. And so I just I want to make it clear at the uh at the I'll make these things clear at the middle or towards the end uh that brother Brandham leaves no doubt to this key when he says at the end he said God cares and this is what I've been preaching on. God cares when you care but you have to care first. So, um I know there are no doubt times when we are so away from God and and and God just comes down and grabs us out of the miry clay. I know God can do that. But when we're believers and we're coming to him for a certain need, God is looking for our attitude that's an that's a kind of a relentless uh faith that says, "Listen, I'm not just halfhazardly asking. I'm asking and I'm continually asking and I'm waiting God for God to step in in a supernatural way. Can you say amen? So God cares when you care, but you have to care first. So if this is true, then we should work our way through this message that has been preached to learn the ways that we show we care. I don't want to miss any of the ways. I don't want to have an area in my life that I'm an attitude that I'm presenting to God that makes God hesitate towards me. I don't want anything hindering my faith. I don't want anything in the way. And most believers are very sensitive to this. Uh I've had phone calls this week. Is that is am I doing something wrong? Brother Paul is do I have a lack of faith and say, "Well, I'm I'm not I say I I'm a pro I'm not a prophet. I don't know." But believers have should have a sincerity. They want to examine every part of their life. Is there anything that's blocking this? Is there any sin? Is there something I don't know? And just that attitude itself, I think God appreciates because there are some things that are mysterious. So, we just don't know why they're going on. But our job is to stand there before God and say, "God, if there's a hindrance to my faith, help me. Show me that you remove all hindrances so the flow of faith can flow freely through me and all the hindrances will be removed." Can you say amen? There seems to be with the Lord sometimes that there's something that's real hard that is put out there by the Lord that that makes it a bit of a a challenge for us to break through so that we show that we're serious about it. And he gave the example it seemed like the Lord is g he gives a bit of a test to show if we really mean it and want help. And the great great example we gave gave was this non who was asked to go wash himself seven times in the worst muddy river in the whole region. Can you say amen? So that shows us that his his blessing of his healing of his leprosy was just just waiting right there. But he had to go through some muddy waters and be washed before he come to a supernatural God. And that says something about God's character. And some people are not willing to go through the muddy waters to get to the real deliverance. You know, for non it was a new thing to him. So he reasoned with that. And why can't I go to the the waters that are cleaner and you know, he's a he's a ruler there in Syria. So he's probably not used to ever being in muddy waters like that and thinks it's a dirty thing. So he's reasoning in his mind. He thought it was going to happen a certain way with the prophet and we get in our minds and the one thing we need to learn about God. Don't tell God how he's going to bring the deliverance or the or the healing. Can you say, "Man, don't tell don't have your mind already set in concrete, but say, God, whatever you use to do it, whatever muddy waters I have to go through, I'm willing to do it. And I'm willing to do it not five or six times. I'm willing to wash seven times. Whatever he says to do, that's the obedience that we should offer." But you see, he had to go wash seven times in the worst mighty river. What uh what do we what do you have? Uh sometimes, you know, uh referring to Elisha, he's speaking of there's a there's a real transition from Elijah to Elisha in ministries. Now, that being said, Elisha asked Elijah that a double portion of his spirit would come on him. And there are some miracles and things that he did that Elisha did that are similar. But if you really read your Bible, and I can't read it tonight, but if you read it and you pull out the differences, there's a because brother says you got Elijah and he was bold and he's speaking to Jezebel and he's speaking the whole political system. He's speaking against the king. It's more of a dispensational, more of a a a political rebuke over the whole nation, over the whole thing of Israel. But when it come to Elisha, it was more of a personal ministry to the widow. It was more it wasn't an international thing. It was taking the same double the spirit double portion of it, but it was ministering personally. And I find in the incidences with it is that in Elisha's incidence in dealing with the people, there was something that he asked for from them first where Elijah, he would just he would go do it. He would speak it. He'd say there would be no more rain. But you see now Elisha says in these in the in the muddy radar he said go dip seven times then you'll get your healing. He told the woman uh what do you have in your home? What can you offer me? And she said I got a little cruise of oil. Go get that cruise of oil. Well that's all we got. Well look at now what he's asking for. Take everything you got. Give it to me. I'll take it. And then he's God's testing us. Are you willing to do the hard thing in order to get to your miracle? Amen. And Elisha just dealt a a bit different with the people. He told the rich young ruler, he got him where his where it counts in his uh his billful, his bank account. God always knows where to get us, doesn't he? Most of us, he does he wouldn't test us with our bank accounts because we don't have very much. But with the rich young ruler, it was everything. So it was the rich young ruler kept probing saying, "Uh, I've done all the commandments, but I really want eternal life. I want He's the one that kept asking." So then Jesus said, "All right, go sell everything that you have and give it to the poor." He's feeling the pain of that. And God God got him right where his pain was, right? The hard thing to give up. You don't think some of these things that's in the word about a woman's dress and these different things, you think sometimes it's just all we write it off. But you see, sometimes it can be a test. Are you willing to do the little thing? How important is you to hang on to this thing? I'm going to dress this way. I'm going to hold on to this. And God just test somebody. And he tests every one of us a little different because he knows if we're serious and we care, then he's going to test us if we care. And just some more things about the uh the supernatural here or about uh uh non. Um in the story of non God through the prophet dealt with leprosy different than he had before. People had leprosy and until that point the only answer was for them to just deal with it. Just you's ever heard that just deal with it. You know you got leprosy just deal with it. And to separate you had to go out in a camp. So there wasn't too much that's dealt with. Now in this incident when Elisha type of the bride Elijah's come Elisha Sha is she type of the bride. How is he dealing with leprosy? Well he's dealing with it a different way. He said go he says go dip seven times in Jordan and your leprosy will be healed. We never seen it quite that way. But I want to bring the point. Don't ever question what God is asking you to do because he might ask you to do something that is strange to the mind, but God knows what he's doing. Can I get an amen? Trust God he knows what he's doing. And and so uh it was a crazy thing to do. Non had to uh lay down all of his ideas and all his uh everything and trust what the prophet said to do. Uh and do something. Sometimes he has to do something that we don't agree with or we don't want to do but it got the results. Isn't that the thing that counts? Does it get results? We are result we are are resultoriented people. We want to see a supernatural God. We want to see results in in God's own time. But we're looking for results. The word in that day was dealing and I believe it deals this in this day with modern problems and personal problems. The answers are here and we overlook the answer because the answer is not in the way doesn't come the way we expected sometimes. So under Elisha and Elijah it's a it's a change in the ministry. Same spirit double portion of the spirit but through the bride's ministry now it's more of a personal work. It's not an international work. Even the third pole says it's not a public show. So, it's more of a personal Elijah dealt personally and and so you would need to study that real close in your Bible in First Kings and Second Kings to see those types and shadows there and see the differences between Elijah and Elisha. This is not the days of Elijah anymore in our day, but we're in the days of Elisha. So, those types and shadows should be a blessing to you to see in the word because we're living in that time. Can you say amen? So, when we go to read these two examples of Brother Brand, he cares and you care. Uh uh I want to read those but I want to give this scriptural base first in Luke 18 that we read as a text. I want to lay this and so now the text speaks of a parable of an unjust judge. It what what this does in this parable is basically takes an extreme example of a judge that's very distant, very detached. Uh it says he doesn't he doesn't revere God. He doesn't rever man. He's insensitive. He He's He He doesn't want to have a hands-on with the people's problems at all. And so, the scripture goes to an extreme to show this unjust judge is completely detached to wanting to meet a need of this nobody, this little widow woman. He's completely detached from it. and and uh it it takes it to an extreme of a judge that's very distant, unreachable, and no fear of God and didn't regard man. Of course, that's not our God. Uh he's not that way. He's a just God. How many believe he's a just God? He's a just judge and he is a judge. But we're learning in this series, thank God, he's a God who cares. So, he's a just God, but he's a God who cares. And and so you say, "Well, why does this parable speak of this this woman, a type of the bride, coming to this unjust judge?" Because I believe it's using an extreme of a completely detached uh uh God or judge who doesn't care. And I'm wondering if it's put in the Bible that way because that's the way people will begin to view God. So he goes to this way that's extreme in this parable to say he's unjust. He doesn't fear God. He doesn't care. He's he he doesn't he's not going to listen to anybody who knocks on the door at all. He don't have any time for it. And that's the way people start to feel with God. And so that's why they give up so quickly because they think God can't supernaturally come in or they're unworthy for God to do something or somehow uh he's not going to listen to me or I knocked one time and he didn't respond so I'm giving up. But God does not want you to give up. I said God doesn't want you to give up. And so the people got this the it's the way people look at God today. They feel so far away. They feel so unworthy to get his attention. Now, when you got a widow, you have a widow is someone who doesn't have a husband. She She has no advocate. She has no protector. She has no head. She actually has nothing. She can't help herself. That's a widow in the Bible. She has no she has nothing left. A lot of times, most cases, they're poor because they don't have anybody to support them. So, a widow represents someone who's helpless. In other words, they don't have money. They don't have position. They they've lost uh their position, their identity with their husband because her husband's gone. And so they've lost everything that would be an earthly way for her to have any credibility to come before this judge. She doesn't have anything to get her in the front door. Nothing. And God uses that as a type of the bride in the last days. Let me tell you friends, we're helpless without him. Come on, why don't you agree with me? We're helpless without him. The problems that are facing us today, we're helpless without this great God to come on the scene. That's why we'll learn to be more dependent on him, more dependent on a supernatural God, more dependent on finances. Can you say amen? It's a good thing that we're pressured because we learn how to pray more. We learn how to depend on him more instead of depending on our own plans. He wants us to be dependent on him. So this widow is someone who has no husband, has no advocate, no protector. She has nothing. She can't help herself. She and then she can't stand up to her enemy uh by herself. She has no power against her adversary. She's helpless to this adversary. I don't know who was bothering her and badgering her, probably trying to steal from her, take advantage of her and but she had an adversary and she had she was powerless for somebody to deal with that adversary. And she said, "I'm going to have to try to go to a higher power because I can't deal with my adversary myself." Is anybody listening to me here tonight? You're in a good spot when you're helpless. You're in a good spot when you say, "I'm going to have to go to I can't go to any other place but to God about this." Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." You're in a good when nothing but a miracle will do. My sister Sherry said, "You get in spots when there when nothing but a miracle will do." Hallelujah. So she appeals to the higher court to bring vengeance on her enemy or is called in scripture her adversary. Hey, we have an adversary. That's right. The devil going about seeking whom he may devour. We have the same adversary. Can you say amen? We have This is the bribe. This is the type of the bride. We have an adversary. And many times we're helpless against this adversary. and she appeals to the highest court, this judge. And she didn't know, I don't know how I'm going to to get through to him, but it's the only power that I can go to to deal with this adversary. It's the only one that I can appeal to, but I'm going to go do it. I have no money. I have no prestige. I have no husband. I have no but I'm going to go to him and I'm going to ask anyway. Many times friends were helpless. But she did not come just one time. The parable is something deeper than just her coming one time. She didn't come one time, but she she came over and over and over and over again. She didn't give up. The first few times she came, he didn't even listen. He didn't she he didn't even hear her. He didn't even bring her in. and he didn't let her in, but she kept knocking. She kept presenting her case to the servant, whoever, however she did it. And she kept and she didn't give up. There's a key here that we must see, and I know it might be simple to you tonight, but we need to not just nod and say, "Amen." We need to live this out every day. That she wearied this judge by what? One thing, her continual coming to him. I'm not giving up. I'm not taking no for an answer. Now, I know that God says no sometimes to certain things, we should be happy with, brother, we should happy with his yeses or nos. But when we're talking about deliverance and we know God could do it, our duty is to stand there with all faith and keep saying, "Listen, Lord, I'm going to keep coming to you and believe that you can do this." Hallelujah. So, she came not one time, but she and and just gave up after one time. There's a key must we must see here. If we really want help, we're going to be desperate. We're going to be perseverant. And that's how we show that we really care. We're not to faint. And that's what he says at the beginning of the parable. He says, "Men ought always to pray." In other words, you didn't just pray, "Lord, please help me with this." And you don't visit it again. Men are always to pray. and not faint. What does the word faint mean? I'm glad you asked. Men are to pray always and not faint. It can refer in the physical to physical exhaustion. Physical exhaustion. And we we can't sometimes we don't have a choice in that. We just are physically exhausted. And so that's and then somebody faints. But then in the spiritual it means a spirit that comes into discouragement. It's a discouragement of your spirit to give up. That's fainting. Oh, do we have a lot of that today? Giving up on God, giving up on the message seen too much. Their spirit, it actually happens sometimes internally for months and years before you see an outward expression. I'm through with this. I'm throwing up my hands for years. They give up in their spirit and they're let down. And so they faint in their spirit. Exhaustion. They they fade out. They uh that's why the Bible says, "Be not weary and welloing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not." Uh they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles and they shall not faint. Can you say amen? So there's a strength by this continual coming, this continual laying before God. And so but this discouragement of spirit is what fate means. And uh when people get a discouragement in their spirit, that's the worst thing because they they quickly can quit trying. They quit trying. They quit praying. They quit trying. They they there there's there's they're just I've tried this. And she meant businesses was not going to give up. This widow was not going to give up. She meant business and she showed she cared and she actually wearied the judge by her continual coming. She just kept, you know, she showed up at the court. She showed up at his house. She showed up when he was working out at the gym. She showed up every You know, they say there's a saying in the world says 90% of success is just showing up. And this widow kept showing up. I'm still here. He's going, "Is she Is that the same woman? She's been coming for months now. She's at my door again. I'm She's actually frustrating and she's making the judge weary. She wasn't weary. She's making the judge weary by her continual coming until finally she brings out an unjust judge who doesn't care for man, doesn't fear God, so distant from the from this need. It doesn't matter. She by her faith draws the power of this judge out to the front door says, "Bring her in. I'll talk to her. I'll avenge her enemy." It shows what faith can do. Amen. It shows but faith that is uh rel relentless continue coming bringing it. I'm not going to give up. That's the kind of faith that God wants to see. Can you say amen? Wherever he was, she came after him, showing him and showing up in front of him and saying, "You are my only hope and I mean business. I'm not going away until I get through to see him." And finally, she pulled a distant judge on the scene. She kept showing up until he showed up. Oh, put that on the refrigerator. She kept showing up until he showed up.
