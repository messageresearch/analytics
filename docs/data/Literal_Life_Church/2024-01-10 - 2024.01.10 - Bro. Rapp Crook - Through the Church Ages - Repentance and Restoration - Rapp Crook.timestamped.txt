[21:01] getting better perhaps we can open our
[21:03] Bibles to Revelation chapter
[21:07] three and uh we'll we're going to talk
[21:10] again speak again from Revelation 3 on
[21:13] the uh seventh Church age allowed to say
[21:15] in church age and looking at the themes
[21:18] of repentance and uh and restoration and
[21:22] uh this may very well be the uh the last
[21:24] part in this uh in this series and I
[21:26] thank you all for your uh for your
[21:28] patience the last uh last uh I think
[21:32] year and a half or so it's been a while
[21:34] but it's been a real been a real
[21:35] blessing for for me personally but uh
[21:39] we'll just start here from verse verse
[21:42] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[21:45] the lisans write these things say the
[21:47] amen the faithful and true witness the
[21:51] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[21:54] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[21:56] hot I would you were were cold or hot so
[22:00] then because you are lukewarm and
[22:02] neither cold nor hot I will spew you out
[22:04] of my mouth because you say I'm rich and
[22:07] increased with goods and have need of
[22:09] nothing and know not that you are
[22:11] wretched and miserable and poor and
[22:14] blind and naked and that uh verse 17 is
[22:18] where we're going to kind of focus uh um
[22:21] for the first part this evening Lord
[22:22] willing we'll get through uh the rest of
[22:24] this as well this evening but let's just
[22:26] uh take this to the Lord
[22:28] Heavenly Father we thank you very much
[22:30] for your goodness and your grace father
[22:32] Lord as we read the description of the
[22:36] uh of of the church age in which we've
[22:38] been um grown up and and and born and we
[22:41] can be so thankful Lord that we've heard
[22:42] a call to out to come out of that and
[22:45] come into a personal uh walk with you
[22:48] that's so much richer than an
[22:49] organizational walk Lord we just uh
[22:52] we're very grateful for this message
[22:55] Lord that that you've put something into
[22:56] our hearts to hear so that we can walk
[22:58] personally with you oh God lord I just
[23:01] pray that you would anoint my words this
[23:03] evening in Jesus name amen Lord bless
[23:06] you may be
[23:08] seated so last uh um I think it would
[23:12] been last year in December uh last
[23:15] service we were looking at the loudan
[23:17] church and we noted uh four different
[23:19] ways that was described through the um
[23:22] description as in as we found it in
[23:24] Revelation 3:14 the first thing that God
[23:27] says um he knows them um actually he
[23:30] doesn't say he knows them he knows their
[23:31] Works they're the busy Church they're
[23:34] doing all kinds of things and is is
[23:38] something that is good enough for them
[23:40] and uh God knew their works but he never
[23:43] knew them and that's something we want
[23:45] to be careful that we're not going to
[23:47] get caught up into that we want to make
[23:49] sure that God knows us that we know God
[23:51] and it's not just that we're not just
[23:53] busy doing good things cuz I tell you
[23:55] you can be you can be so busy you can be
[23:57] be preparing sermons you can be
[23:59] preparing Bible lessons and things like
[24:01] that but that's not the same as being
[24:04] quiet for the Lord for yourself and you
[24:07] can be busy doing all these good things
[24:09] on the inside you can feel like you're
[24:12] it there's nothing there there in and
[24:15] then the next thing that we notice about
[24:17] them um the scripture says that they
[24:19] lukewarm church and there wasn't just
[24:21] idea of temperature really spoke to me
[24:24] when I for the last service they wer
[24:28] really interested in living the truth
[24:29] they were just interested in debating
[24:31] the truth and you have to be interested
[24:33] in doing more than talking about it
[24:35] because talking is very very easy um
[24:38] you're committed to something you can be
[24:40] skeptical you can f find fault in things
[24:42] but when you're really living it and
[24:44] determin to live it that is uh that is
[24:47] not lukewarm that is that
[24:49] that's and last the third thing I
[24:51] noticed um it's the talking church it's
[24:54] the only church age whose own words are
[24:56] being recorded and and they're saying
[24:58] God I've done this I've done that I've
[25:00] done all these other things and almost
[25:02] like it's me it's me it's me oh Lord
[25:04] look at all I've done they're not asking
[25:07] God to do anything because they don't
[25:09] feel that they need anything and it's
[25:12] it's the it's the talking church and we
[25:14] want to make sure that we're not just
[25:16] talking to God but we're actually being
[25:19] still and and listening that's right and
[25:23] lastly we saw that they were the
[25:25] desensitized church because we saw that
[25:27] they um they no that's what we'll do our
[25:31] best here they desensitized church
[25:34] because they're wretched miserable poor
[25:37] blind and naked and don't know it and
[25:40] that was just the the the the image of
[25:43] the leper who has this nerve disease and
[25:46] they don't re and what what what what a
[25:48] gift it is to be able to feel and sense
[25:51] pain because pain protects us from what
[25:54] we how we could be hurting ourselves
[25:55] much much more and this desensitized
[25:57] church this this condition gradually
[26:00] built up and they didn't realize how
[26:03] what they were getting into that brought
[26:05] so much pleased to their flesh was
[26:07] actually harming them and uh um you'll
[26:12] see that um brother Gideon was talking
[26:15] about how he was blessed this last night
[26:17] in his night shift with good
[26:19] patience not all patients are good from
[26:22] what I hear from my doctor family and um
[26:25] the lysan church is not really a good
[26:28] patient there uh the doctor comes and
[26:32] they know what they think they need it's
[26:35] kind of like you go to the doctor say
[26:37] doctor these are the medicines I'm will
[26:38] take you tell me what I have that this
[26:40] will work with but when we go to the
[26:42] doctor when we go to God we need to be
[26:44] willing to listen to what God's
[26:46] diagnosis is because here you've got in
[26:48] Revelation
[26:49] 3:17 I'm seeing to Dueling
[26:52] diagnosis I'm busy I'm busy I'm busy um
[26:56] I'm stressed God you give me something
[26:58] like Gideon said can you give me a pill
[26:59] to help me and you don't realize there
[27:02] might be a much deeper issue involved
[27:05] and God's diagnosis isn't just that
[27:06] you're busy God's diagnosis is you're
[27:09] wretched miserable poor blind naked and
[27:13] that's not a message that any of us want
[27:15] to hear much less is allowed to say in
[27:17] church so this evening I want to start
[27:19] on just looking at what God's diagnosis
[27:23] of this church was because like brother
[27:26] brandham says what God saw
[27:28] was entirely different from what they
[27:30] said they saw they see the glittering
[27:33] buildings they see the increasing
[27:35] numbers of everything and they their dat
[27:38] it looks like their church is growing
[27:40] but God doesn't count his church he
[27:43] weighs his church he's looking for
[27:45] quality not
[27:47] quantity they thought they were rich in
[27:49] goods and spiritually healthy that they
[27:51] had arrived that they needed nothing but
[27:55] God saw it otherwise amen I just want to
[27:58] take a few minutes this evening and go
[28:01] over some of these uh really negative
[28:04] adjectives God is not using very um woke
[28:09] language he's using somewhat offensive
[28:11] language he's not making anybody feel
[28:13] good with his diagnosis but a good
[28:16] mechanic a good doctor isn't into making
[28:18] you feel good he's into making you be
[28:21] good he's making he's willing to tell
[28:23] you hey your car is rotten you need some
[28:25] serious work done that's what you want
[28:27] to have told to you if that's what the
[28:30] case is and God's going to tell them
[28:31] some tough things the first thing that
[28:34] God says to him is you you don't realize
[28:36] it but you're in a wretched condition
[28:39] you've been able to cover it up with all
[28:41] kinds of things but you find yourself in
[28:43] a wretched condition and on page 396 of
[28:46] the church age book brother brandom said
[28:48] it's it points to the irony in this age
[28:50] of Plenty and opportunity suddenly we
[28:54] find mental illness taking such such a
[28:57] toll as to alarm the
[28:59] nation and um some of the things that I
[29:03] mean chickens are gradually coming home
[29:04] to to roost because in the in the 60s
[29:08] and 70s have the sexual Revolution you
[29:11] have feminism you should be able to do
[29:13] live your life however you want to don't
[29:15] get married just just just live your
[29:17] life as you want to and now one of the
[29:19] results of this you have the United
[29:21] Kingdom have the United States they have
[29:23] a a minister for
[29:25] loneliness because people wanted to live
[29:27] their life as they wanted to live in
[29:29] their young years and then you get older
[29:32] and you're you're alone and you got all
[29:34] these all these health problems because
[29:36] of it well it's because you were you you
[29:38] were choosing a selfish way for a really
[29:41] long time it's not easy raising kids and
[29:44] then you did what you wanted to do for
[29:46] many many years and
[29:48] now you're just lonely but uh they've
[29:52] got everybody ought here here in the
[29:53] world today everybody ought to be happy
[29:57] the United States we have we're this is
[29:59] we've got a lot of blessing here and I
[30:02] remember going when I was at College I'd
[30:04] go into the uh going to the cafeteria I
[30:07] was thrilled it was already food was
[30:08] made for me it was paid for I just got
[30:10] and people are walking around like
[30:12] there's nothing to eat I'm not going to
[30:14] eat this there's we're we're we're
[30:16] blessed but in this place still millions
[30:19] are taking sedatives at night pet pills
[30:22] in the morning rushing to doctors
[30:24] entering institutions trying to drown
[30:27] out unknown fears by alcohol all these
[30:30] things when we're so
[30:32] blessed yeah we're having but there's
[30:34] something inside there's a voice that
[30:36] you that that cannot be drowned out
[30:39] there's a hunger that cannot be
[30:40] satisfied with any other thing if the
[30:43] devil wants to distract you from that
[30:45] we'll talk more about that late
[30:48] later it's a it's it's it's it's a
[30:50] wretched condition that they find
[30:52] themselves in this age at the bottom of
[30:55] page one they boast themselves of
[30:56] tremend mendous stores of worldly Goods
[30:59] but people are less happy than ever
[31:02] after Christmas everybody's got the
[31:03] things on their Christmas list and my
[31:06] kids are already updating their Amazon
[31:09] list we just got all things that way was
[31:11] on there then you're were already it's
[31:12] like what are Lord help us my goodness
[31:16] um sorry job but uh um bottom of page
[31:20] two without a known reason men's hearts
[31:22] are failing for fear the world is so
[31:24] dark in this age could well be called
[31:26] the age of neurotic
[31:27] that it boasts but it can't back it up
[31:31] and you notice it's you got the you have
[31:34] the you have the bully there in the
[31:36] school he all the boasting when somebody
[31:38] finally calls his boast then he backs
[31:40] down and he realizes he he he doesn't
[31:42] have the goods and that's what you find
[31:44] this age also having we we make all
[31:47] kinds of boasts we think we can live
[31:48] this live that but when if you if you
[31:51] don't have the Lord you really can't do
[31:54] half what you think you can you need
[31:56] that on the inside
[31:58] like the um the Old Testament talks
[32:00] about we have peace peace but there is
[32:01] no peace that's what all the worldly
[32:03] philosophies promise they promise all
[32:06] kinds of wonderful things but there is
[32:08] no peace there in the end and the church
[32:11] is not just wretched they're they're
[32:13] miserable brother bam says that means
[32:16] that they objects to be pitied they're
[32:19] they're full of Pride um they they've
[32:22] built upon quicksand rather than upon
[32:24] the rock of for the revelation of God's
[32:26] word we know soon cometh the earthquake
[32:29] he say pity of the poor people who are
[32:30] in this last day ecumenical move and
[32:34] call it the move of God when it's
[32:36] actually the move of Satan and it's
[32:38] pitiable because they've got their the
[32:41] hopes are so high expectation is so high
[32:46] and then in the
[32:48] end a minister fails or something else
[32:50] fails and there's not the enduring power
[32:53] and the keeping power I was telling
[32:56] brother Paul earlier this this uh week I
[32:58] read in the uh news and the the BBC was
[33:00] been following a particular uh big
[33:02] Healing Ministry in Africa and I can
[33:04] remember when a brother left the message
[33:07] some years ago we were saying yeah
[33:08] you've got brother Brandon has got signs
[33:10] and wonders but there are many better
[33:11] even greater signs and wonders being
[33:13] done by this particular healer in Africa
[33:16] and he he traded the one for the other
[33:19] and the News came out this big healer in
[33:21] Africa he was been committing all kinds
[33:23] of uh um sexual abuse and things like
[33:26] that and I thought man the more that the
[33:29] longer time passes the more
[33:32] extraordinary the prophet actually
[33:34] becomes because he had so many signs and
[33:36] wonders and yet by God's grace he kept
[33:39] his feet on the ground he was humble he
[33:41] lived a clean life that's
[33:44] extraordinary and you can and but you've
[33:47] got this this worldly Church part of The
[33:49] ecumenical move and they they set their
[33:51] heights and all these other things and
[33:53] this is a disappointment when it happens
[33:55] here but it's even greater dis point
[33:57] when you get to the other side and think
[33:59] ah Lord Lord I've all these great things
[34:01] but the Lord says I never knew you and
[34:04] that is a that is a pitiable
[34:06] disappointment and it can be difficult
[34:08] even when when people can come into
[34:12] sometimes would be perfect storms
[34:14] created in in in in our lives where we
[34:16] can have difficult circumstances and
[34:19] then maybe we're dissatisfied with
[34:20] something in the church or something in
[34:22] the message and then because we we just
[34:24] feel like there's really no good place
[34:25] to turn anywhere
[34:27] and that's where we really just have to
[34:28] be watching our our um like a pil
[34:32] watches his dashboard his instrument so
[34:34] you just stay flying straight straight
[34:37] just fly by the instruments because
[34:39] those perfect storms can come up and you
[34:41] can think man these other big churches
[34:43] they've got the great worship team
[34:45] they've got the great charismatic uh
[34:48] gifts being poured out and they've got
[34:50] huge amounts of people coming they they
[34:52] care about the community the community
[34:54] is receiving something from them you can
[34:56] man
[34:57] how does that compare with my church and
[35:00] when you when that perfect storm gifts
[35:01] created man I need I need to try going
[35:03] somewhere else because maybe I didn't
[35:05] have everything I thought I had and I
[35:07] think brother Brandon he makes a point
[35:09] here pity them don't envy them because
[35:13] it can look um Fool's Gold can glitter
[35:17] they can look so wonderful but he calls
[35:19] us back back to the old store buildings
[35:22] back to the dimly lit rooms back to the
[35:24] cellers back to less of the world and
[35:27] more of God and that's what we need we
[35:29] don't want to become so polished that
[35:31] there's no room to just have a have have
[35:34] have a have a have a just a great
[35:36] repentance there at the altar who cares
[35:38] what people think let's just let's just
[35:40] keep it simple have God move because
[35:42] that's what it's about and God's blessed
[35:45] us with with with with a great building
[35:47] but that's not the point we come here
[35:50] just it's wonderful we can host all
[35:52] kinds of things but the point is that
[35:53] God can move in here and he can move in
[35:55] our hearts and that's what what we want
[35:58] cuz if it's if it's all all about the
[36:00] buildings earthquake will destroy the
[36:02] building it'll burn up and there's
[36:04] nothing left over but if it's about the
[36:06] heart that'll abide forever and that's
[36:08] what we're here
[36:14] for
[36:16] poor now of course brother bam says this
[36:19] means spiritually poor because one thing
[36:22] the the worldly church is not is it is
[36:24] not financially poor they've got
[36:27] business managers they've got all kinds
[36:28] of things but he says this is the
[36:30] spiritually poor and I just I I just was
[36:33] really blessed going through these
[36:34] adjectives going through the church age
[36:36] book but there been writs a lot in there
[36:38] I just tried to clip out some highlights
[36:39] but there's more in the notes the sign
[36:41] of this age as it Clos it is bigger and
[36:44] better churches more and more people
[36:47] with more and more manifestation of
[36:49] what's supposed to be demonstration of
[36:51] the Holy
[36:52] Ghost and you can find some huge
[36:55] churches you can find with with lots of
[36:57] people they think man what are we doing
[36:59] wrong we're not doing anything wrong but
[37:02] don't get distracted by what's going on
[37:04] outside he says the filled altars the
[37:06] gifts of the Spirit in operation
[37:08] remarkable attendance is not the answer
[37:10] from
[37:11] God for those who come to the altars
[37:14] very seldom say to go on with God it's
[37:17] changed
[37:18] lives that lasts and it's not just
[37:22] putting your name on a role becoming
[37:23] part of a small group Bible say but
[37:25] you're actually being trans transformed
[37:27] you your family from the inside out and
[37:30] it it's so important uh to catch the
[37:32] vision for the time that we're living in
[37:36] to see that hey the Revival swept the
[37:39] land in
[37:40] 1956 they're in there're in those those
[37:43] revivals back and forth and we still
[37:45] pray that God will continue to move but
[37:47] our expectation isn't for this big work
[37:50] of God so when we see that kind of thing
[37:52] happening we don't think oh yeah that's
[37:54] what I want to be part of we we know we
[37:57] that time has come we pray for them to
[37:58] work in our hearts we pray for them to
[38:00] work locally but we have it helps us to
[38:03] have
[38:04] discernment that's why God gives us the
[38:07] message so that we can we can capitalize
[38:10] on it and we can see what the
[38:12] characteristic of the True Vine are what
[38:13] the characteristics of the false Vine
[38:15] are so that we won't be easily so LED
[38:17] astray and envious why why can't we have
[38:19] a a huge Outreach everybody just pours
[38:23] in um it's easy to have everybody pour
[38:25] in when you say come to the altar just
[38:27] as you are and leave just as you were
[38:29] but when there's change involved that's
[38:32] a much higher
[38:41] expectation so these people continuing
[38:43] on here with that dot dot dot um where
[38:46] all those who came down the aisle they
[38:47] might have heard a man listened to an
[38:49] appeal they came into the net but they
[38:51] were not fish and he says Turtle like
[38:54] they crawled back to their own Waters so
[38:56] yes when you when when when when you
[38:58] throw the gospel net they can get all
[39:01] Jesus tells us in the Matthew 13 The
[39:03] Parables of the Kingdom you can get all
[39:05] kinds of creatures coming in the net and
[39:07] at the end when you get back to shore
[39:09] you you you throw the Turtles out you
[39:11] throw the crawdads out and you keep the
[39:13] fish so it's not just what the heavy net
[39:15] you what's in the
[39:18] net and he also quotes then about um in
[39:23] the last days um many will come to the
[39:26] Lord the Judgment say didn't we do many
[39:28] wonderful works in your name even to the
[39:30] casting out devils and Jesus says um
[39:33] depart from you that work iniquity I
[39:36] never knew you you that work
[39:39] iniquity that's that th those are strong
[39:42] words he called them workers of iniquity
[39:44] yet you can get a man that can come and
[39:46] pray for the sick get oil and blood
[39:48] appearing in the congregation prophecy
[39:51] coming forth in all manner of the
[39:53] Supernatural and people will gather
[39:55] around him and saries of the Lord even
[39:57] though he's actually making a money
[40:00] racket of religion and living in sin and
[40:03] that's what you often see and it's just
[40:06] it's remarkable um in brother Brandon's
[40:09] Ministry you didn't have that because
[40:12] when you have your Ministries being
[40:14] blessed and then people's tendency is
[40:17] going to be to put you on a pedestal
[40:19] that is a that can be a a trap and many
[40:23] fall into that um and that's what we
[40:26] just read in the news about but um the
[40:29] only answer they have is the absolutely
[40:32] unbiblical answer well he gets results
[40:35] so he must be of God that's not it it's
[40:38] not the man you have to take it back to
[40:41] the word this sounds so good oh he gets
[40:44] results look at what's what what what
[40:46] what at what's happening but how
[40:49] actually poor this age is in the spirit
[40:51] of God and the poor poverty-stricken
[40:54] ones don't even know it that's what
[40:58] Revelation 3 says and knoweth it not
[41:00] because you seem it you have all kinds
[41:03] of seeming manifestation seeming results
[41:06] but how much of it well actually the
[41:08] Apostle Paul I think in first 2
[41:09] Corinthians talks about the um the
[41:13] foundation that is solid what you build
[41:15] upon that Foundation wood Hast double
[41:18] that'll be burned up what are you going
[41:19] to build upon the foundation and what we
[41:22] want to be make sure we're building
[41:24] things on our that Foundation of Grace
[41:25] that's going to stand the
[41:28] test then the last characteristic these
[41:31] offensive terms that God uses here to to
[41:34] to wake us up he says you're blind and
[41:37] naked and uh he talks about how these
[41:40] who are are they who have become blind
[41:43] because they've refused the word of God
[41:47] they've stripped themselves naked by
[41:49] leaving God's care and protection they
[41:52] seek to build their own way of Salvation
[41:55] and that is how it's been since the
[41:57] Garden of Eden Adam and Eve when they
[42:00] fell onto sin the first thing they did
[42:02] they realized they were naked and they
[42:04] got fig leaves they thought they were
[42:06] covered but God's message was to them
[42:09] you're still naked they were covered
[42:11] with fig leaves and God said who told
[42:12] you you're naked we're not naked we're
[42:14] covered you're you're not covered if
[42:17] it's your own righteousness that covers
[42:19] you and every single man-made religion
[42:21] is always going to be giving us a
[42:23] covering by our own righteousness and
[42:25] it's always going to be a case of The
[42:27] Emperor's New Clothes we're so impressed
[42:29] with how how how good it looks but it
[42:32] covers
[42:33] nothing and um talking about about
[42:37] nakedness this is the same experience
[42:39] that the children of Israel had there by
[42:41] Mount Si when Moses came off the
[42:45] mountain and the people Aaron had built
[42:47] this golden calf and the people were
[42:49] were partying around the calf and Moses
[42:53] saw the people that they were naked and
[42:54] the Bible says Aaron had made made them
[42:56] naked under their shame among their
[42:58] enemies how did he make them naked he
[43:00] wasn't going out there stripping off
[43:02] their clothes but he removed God's word
[43:05] from them they had the just like the
[43:07] last sentence said they left God's care
[43:10] and protection they're building their
[43:12] own way of Salvation when you leave
[43:15] God's care and protection you're you're
[43:18] you're leaving your garments behind and
[43:20] you are naked and it's not just naked as
[43:23] far as immodest but you're also exposed
[43:25] to the element there's nothing to
[43:27] protect you all of that is there is
[43:29] there
[43:31] included and uh he says oh how lovely
[43:34] and beautiful dressed they can appear in
[43:36] their own eyes as they form their
[43:38] General assemblies their councils Etc
[43:41] but now God is stripping it all away and
[43:44] they're naked he's revealing the
[43:46] nakedness for these organizations have
[43:49] but led them into the camp of antichrist
[43:51] and the field of tears right up to their
[43:54] binding and burning and he repeats again
[43:57] objects of pity indeed they are pity
[44:00] them warn them beseech them and still
[44:03] they can go their way headlong into
[44:07] destruction but um we've got the we've
[44:10] got the diagnosis and it's not a good
[44:12] diagnosis and it's even worse when You'
[44:14] got a patient who's not willing to hear
[44:17] it but the doctor has the responsibility
[44:20] I've got to tell them he tells then the
[44:22] doctor goes on and he gives a um he
[44:25] gives a prescription
[44:26] and we take a few minutes and looking at
[44:28] what God's prescription was in verses 18
[44:32] and
[44:32] 19 we notice he doesn't go and give them
[44:36] a list of things to do he doesn't hand
[44:39] them a book of The Seven Habits of
[44:41] Highly Effective Christians he doesn't
[44:43] do that what he we just read it I
[44:46] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[44:48] the fire that th mayest be
[44:51] rich and I suggest that these are the
[44:54] the the these what what he suggesting
[44:56] that they acquire or buy we look at them
[44:59] as as as symbols because they have
[45:01] enough gold what is the gold that God's
[45:03] talking about here and also buy of me
[45:06] white rment that you may be clothed that
[45:08] the shame of your nakedness not appear
[45:10] and anoint your eyes with iav that you
[45:13] may see as many as I love I rebuke and
[45:16] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[45:19] and I want to look the way I was looking
[45:21] at this last night verses 18 and 19 they
[45:25] work really really really well together
[45:28] Verse 18 is basically a picture or an
[45:31] illustration that's a little more
[45:33] lengthy verse 19 gives it short sweeten
[45:36] to the point you need to repent that's
[45:38] verse 19 Verse 18 shows us what
[45:41] repentance actually looks like what does
[45:44] repentance actually include it breaks it
[45:46] down really really
[45:48] well first off God's prescription he
[45:51] says buy of
[45:53] me for the loudan church if somebody
[45:56] comes to them needing help they will
[45:58] give them sign them up for this program
[46:00] that program give them all kinds of
[46:02] things to do but God tells him come to
[46:07] me by of me he points us to himself and
[46:11] that is that's the most I thought that
[46:13] was really uh really noteworthy brother
[46:16] Brandon pointed that out he directs this
[46:18] last day Church to one hope and that
[46:21] hope is himself he says come to me and
[46:26] by and it's evident he says from this
[46:28] phrase by of me that the laian church is
[46:31] not at all dealing with Jesus for the
[46:34] spiritual products of the kingdom of God
[46:36] their transactions cannot be spiritual
[46:39] they've been doing all these kinds of
[46:40] things but they've been not been dealing
[46:42] with Christ because now he's saying come
[46:44] back to me and buy they've been doing
[46:47] all kinds of things this at the top of
[46:48] page four but if they've been if they've
[46:50] been dealing with Christ we've already
[46:52] gotten this but they're not because this
[46:55] the loudan church isn't Christ's Church
[47:00] anymore all the way back in the paman
[47:02] church this says Satan sits
[47:05] enthroned upon the church and it it's
[47:09] his church and Christ has finally been
[47:11] pushed outside the church so when
[47:15] they're busy and this is the greatest
[47:17] deception it's like Satan has hacked the
[47:18] church he's hacked everything about it
[47:20] they think they're accessing Christ they
[47:23] think they're getting something from
[47:24] Christ but it's the greatest deception
[47:26] because he is outside the church and
[47:29] they're so busy he's turning the music
[47:31] up so I getting doing so many things
[47:33] they can't even hear the knock knock
[47:35] knock and even if they could hear they
[47:37] couldn't hear the voice because Satan
[47:40] doesn't want you to buy of him because
[47:44] really all Christ says come to me my
[47:47] yoke is easy my burden is light and
[47:50] you'll find true rest to your
[47:54] souls there transactions cannot have
[47:57] been spiritual you may think they're
[47:59] spiritual but how can they be the works
[48:01] in their midst are definitely not as
[48:03] Paul would say God in you willing and
[48:05] doing of his good pleasure so what about
[48:08] all these churches schools hospitals
[48:10] missionary Ventures Etc God's not in
[48:12] them as long as they're denominational
[48:14] seed and spirit and not the seed and
[48:17] spirit of God they can be doing all
[48:19] kinds of really good humanitarian things
[48:22] and it's that that those can be great
[48:24] things to do but don't deceive somebody
[48:26] to thinking that they're also getting
[48:28] saved because those are two different
[48:31] things the gold of
[48:34] God brother Bram says the gold of God is
[48:38] Christlike character produced in the
[48:41] furnace of Affliction brother brand says
[48:44] these people had plenty of gold it was
[48:46] the wrong kind it was that gold that
[48:48] bought men's lives and destroy them it
[48:50] was the gold that warped and twisted
[48:52] human character for its love was the
[48:55] root root of all evil the gift of the
[48:57] gold of God is a Christlike character
[48:59] produced in the furnace of
[49:02] Affliction this age is designed to get
[49:06] us to avoid
[49:08] Affliction does not want us to have any
[49:10] kind of Affliction at all this morning
[49:13] in Bible class we're going over Paul's
[49:16] missionary journey uh to
[49:18] Philippi and you know at the beginning
[49:21] of the day Paul might have prayed like
[49:23] many of us will pray in the mornings
[49:24] Lord please bless this stay and help it
[49:26] to be a good day in Jesus name
[49:30] amen that seems like a really good
[49:33] prayer but God's idea of a good day and
[49:36] your idea of a good day could be very
[49:38] very different when we say Lord please
[49:40] help me have a good day we're really
[49:42] probably meaning a painfree day that's
[49:44] what we're asking for that is not
[49:47] necessarily God's will for us because 1
[49:50] Thessalonians 4 says that God's will is
[49:52] our
[49:54] sanctification that's God God's will
[49:56] that's what God probably cares about
[49:58] definitely he cares more about our
[50:00] sanctification than us getting a
[50:02] particular kind of car particular kind
[50:04] of house particular kind of job we pray
[50:06] about those things but we should also be
[50:08] praying about Lord help me to grow in
[50:10] sanctification more in your
[50:12] christlikeness so Paul had been praying
[50:14] for weeks Lord where would you have me
[50:16] to preach where would you have me to go
[50:18] and he tries to go up into Bia and de
[50:20] Asia and missia and everywhere that says
[50:23] the Holy Ghost suffered him not to go
[50:25] there yeah I think man if anybody's
[50:28] being led by the spirit of God it's Paul
[50:31] what does walking in God's will look
[50:33] like and sometimes I showed the kids you
[50:36] guys maybe seen the the famous statue of
[50:38] The Thinker like this right and if Paul
[50:42] had been like The Thinker he wouldn't
[50:44] have gone anywhere until he knew exactly
[50:47] where God wanted him to go and I thought
[50:51] when we're analysis paralysis or
[50:54] sometimes we could say praying for God's
[50:56] will paralysis until I know exactly what
[50:59] God's perfect will is I will go nowhere
[51:01] God if Paul had thought that way he
[51:03] would never have made it out of Antioch
[51:06] because Paul has you brother Stephen you
[51:08] told me a long time ago God can't steer
[51:10] a stationary
[51:11] ship the rudder only works the ship's
[51:14] moving once Paul starts moving God can I
[51:17] had the kid get up and Gideon get up
[51:19] just a minute if you're willing to start
[51:21] taking steps just take some steps it's
[51:23] easy to turn you one way to the other if
[51:25] you're taking steps but if you I'm not
[51:27] going to go anywhere brother rap until I
[51:29] know exactly what God wants me to do and
[51:30] he just stands and I have to really push
[51:33] P until I know ex you don't know where
[51:35] I'm pushing you yet so I'm not going to
[51:37] go anywhere until I know exactly where
[51:38] I'm supposed to go I'm going to push
[51:39] push push I really have to push you to
[51:42] know what God's will is that's we don't
[51:44] want to have that kind of relationship
[51:46] with our with our prayer life thank you
[51:49] but Paul did not have a good day in
[51:54] Philippi yeah yes there was Deliverance
[51:56] from
[51:58] demons but then there was a Deliverance
[52:00] of a Jailer but I thought man I tried to
[52:03] avoid jailers I try to avoid policemen
[52:06] Paul did not have a good experience with
[52:08] the with with the Jailer he got whipped
[52:09] he got beat it was not a painfree
[52:13] day but it was a good day in God's eyes
[52:17] why does God treat this missionary like
[52:19] that God could have done this much more
[52:21] easily because when God gives us a good
[52:24] day it's not a pain for
[52:26] day Lord please bless tomorrow
[52:30] is uh but he doesn't give us a painfree
[52:33] day but he's building something inside
[52:36] of us and the devil wants to do
[52:38] everything he can to alleviate the pain
[52:41] alleviate the Affliction but that is not
[52:44] how God works take a look at First Peter
[52:47] chapter 1 and this is not in the
[52:49] slides 1 Peter chapter 1 want to notice
[52:52] a couple words that go together
[52:56] Hebrews James 1
[52:58] Peter one in verse
[53:01] uh
[53:04] um verse uh verse five we are kept by
[53:08] the power of God through faith unto
[53:10] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[53:11] last time wherein you greatly Rejoice
[53:15] though now for a season if need be
[53:18] you're in heaveness through manifold
[53:20] Temptations if need be so if we're in
[53:22] heaviness through manifold Temptations
[53:24] It's because God determined that there
[53:26] was need God doesn't waste those things
[53:29] that the trial of your faith being much
[53:32] more precious than of gold that perishes
[53:36] though it be tried with fire might be
[53:38] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
[53:42] the appearing of Jesus Christ trial is
[53:46] paired with glory honor and
[53:50] praise verse
[53:52] 11 searching what or what manner of time
[53:55] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[53:57] did signify when it testified before him
[53:59] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[54:03] that should follow sufferings and Glory
[54:07] are inseparably linked Romans
[54:17] 88:18 for I reckon that the sufferings
[54:20] of this present time are not worthy to
[54:23] be compared with the glory
[54:25] which shall be revealed in us and the
[54:27] sufferings is that's one of those words
[54:29] on Satan's TV station that get censored
[54:32] out he's preaching about suffering no we
[54:34] don't we don't hear that because that's
[54:36] what that that is what this that's what
[54:38] this age is wretched because they have
[54:41] everything else to cover up the
[54:43] sufferings to cover up the Affliction so
[54:45] we don't feel it so we feel better about
[54:47] it but inside it's not being dealt with
[54:49] and it's still there which is why they
[54:51] go from one thing to another thing to
[54:53] another thing Hebrews chapter chap
[55:02] 2 and verses 9 and
[55:05] 10 but we see Jesus who is made a little
[55:09] lower than the angels for the suffering
[55:11] of death crowned with Glory and Honor
[55:15] that he by the grace of God should taste
[55:17] death for every man for it became him
[55:20] for for whom are all things and by whom
[55:23] are all things and bring many sons into
[55:26] glory to make the captain of their
[55:27] salvation perfect through
[55:30] sufferings if that was the way our Lord
[55:34] had to
[55:35] walk we can walk that way too and we
[55:38] look at the promise that's given to the
[55:40] bride allow to see and age they will sit
[55:42] with him in that
[55:43] Throne they'll walk a path similar to
[55:46] his path to get there you can't have
[55:48] that Glory without the sufferings that
[55:50] are connected with
[55:52] it so Satan does everything everything
[55:55] he can to keep us from the
[55:57] Affliction and when we're in Affliction
[55:59] he does everything he can to prevent us
[56:00] from understanding and valuing its
[56:02] purpose if we're in a trial we try to
[56:04] get out of that trial as fast as we can
[56:06] but really when we're in a trial we have
[56:08] we need to realize we are in God's
[56:12] hands and we just want to stay there for
[56:14] as long as it takes I remember one time
[56:17] I was thinking in James chapter one
[56:19] talks about let patience have its
[56:21] perfect work that you may be holy and
[56:23] entire wanting nothing nothing I can
[56:26] just remember the image that God gave me
[56:27] was somebody in open heart surgery on
[56:29] the operating table and he's tired of
[56:32] the surgery he wants to jump off before
[56:34] the doctor's done with him that's us
[56:36] we're trying to jump out of our trials
[56:38] before God's done with us we want God to
[56:41] he will complete the surgery he will
[56:42] take care of us take care of us through
[56:44] the trial as we will be accomplished in
[56:46] the trial we will just wait and have
[56:49] that patience on him amen it's not fun
[56:53] but the glory is great it's worth
[56:57] it next part of the prescription is by
[57:01] white rment that we might be
[57:03] clothed and that white rment we'll find
[57:07] that is the
[57:08] righteousness of um the Saints if we
[57:11] look over in Revelation 197 and 8 this
[57:14] is looking forward to the bride of
[57:16] Christ and the marriage of the Lamb
[57:17] verse 8 says and to her was granted that
[57:20] she should be arrayed in fine linen
[57:22] clean and white for the fine linen is
[57:25] the righteousness of the Saints and we
[57:27] don't have our own righteousness
[57:30] Philippians 3:9 says we want to be found
[57:32] in him not having my own righteousness
[57:35] which is of the law but that
[57:37] righteousness which is of the Faith of
[57:40] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[57:42] by faith so here we when we repent we're
[57:47] done with our own works we put all the
[57:51] and the lean church is characterized by
[57:53] their own works I know your Works
[57:56] they're gloring in their own works but a
[57:59] true Christian doesn't glory in our own
[58:01] works we glory in Christ's work and
[58:04] that's one thing this talking Church
[58:06] talks nothing about they're not talking
[58:08] about Christ's work but that is all that
[58:10] we can sing about because we haven't we
[58:12] don't have our own righteousness we
[58:14] don't want our own righteousness our
[58:16] best days our best acts are like trying
[58:19] to clean a dish with a dirty dish rag
[58:23] our our righteousnesses are as filthy
[58:26] rags Romans chapter 4 talking about
[58:29] Abraham to him that worketh is the
[58:31] reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[58:35] the Lan church was working a lot but
[58:38] we've got such a huge we we talked at
[58:40] youth hisory about credit we've got such
[58:42] a huge debt and Satan charges lots of
[58:45] Interest we can work as hard as we can
[58:48] but we will never pay that off the only
[58:52] way to get it paid off is to have faith
[58:54] and and our millionaire God billionaire
[58:56] God who can settle all those accounts
[58:59] one perfectly thank you Lord but to him
[59:01] that worketh not but believeth on him
[59:04] that justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[59:08] counted for
[59:09] righteousness the Lan church was not
[59:11] acknowledged for their faith but for
[59:13] their works and works leads to debt we
[59:15] want to have the Faith of
[59:18] Christ in the in in the church age book
[59:20] brother Brandon says about those those
[59:22] white garments there is a price to to
[59:24] pay for those garments and that is the
[59:27] price of
[59:29] Separation in order to because we have
[59:32] to buy of him where is he he's on the
[59:36] other side of the church door because
[59:37] he's been kicked out so if we have to
[59:40] buy of him we have to be willing to
[59:42] separate from this group that we're with
[59:45] we have to be willing to go to him and
[59:48] put our trust in him and be hey Lord
[59:50] I've done all kinds of things I thought
[59:52] I was doing good but I don't want my
[59:55] I see this is this is terrible these
[59:57] great things I thought were so super
[59:59] it's terrible would you can I trade them
[1:00:01] with you Lord I will give you all of
[1:00:02] mine and you can give me yours that's
[1:00:05] what that's what repentance is
[1:00:11] about and uh uh Paul talks about you
[1:00:14] can't be unequally yolked together with
[1:00:15] unbelievers in 2 Corinthians chapter 6
[1:00:18] what Concord Christ with bile what parth
[1:00:21] the believer with an Infidel and this is
[1:00:23] where he says
[1:00:25] and for 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 17 uh
[1:00:28] verse 16 the top of page five what
[1:00:30] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:00:32] Idols you are the Temple of the Living
[1:00:34] God as God has said I will dwell in them
[1:00:37] and walk in them I will be their God
[1:00:39] they shall be my people wherefore come
[1:00:41] out from among them and be ye separate
[1:00:44] say the Lord and touch not the unclean
[1:00:45] thing and I will receive you there is a
[1:00:48] price for these garment it's the price
[1:00:49] of Separation we have to leave this
[1:00:51] established Lan church and go to where
[1:00:54] Christ is then lastly he says anoint
[1:00:58] your eyes with isav that you may see
[1:01:02] because otherwise you can't see right
[1:01:06] you can think you see but you are not
[1:01:09] seeing what is
[1:01:11] true and brother Brandon points out he
[1:01:13] does not say you have to buy this isaf
[1:01:16] no because there's no price tag on the
[1:01:18] Holy Spirit but without the baptism of
[1:01:21] the Holy Ghost you can never have your
[1:01:23] eyes open opened to a true spiritual
[1:01:26] revelation of the word a man without the
[1:01:28] spirit is blind to God and His truth and
[1:01:31] one comparison I have is H you can try
[1:01:34] to work on the jigsaw puzzle but if you
[1:01:36] don't have the the picture you can try
[1:01:39] as hard as you can to put these pieces
[1:01:41] together and you'll achieve some limited
[1:01:43] success by grouping colors together
[1:01:45] you'll be able to put some just by hard
[1:01:47] study and hard work but when you have
[1:01:50] that picture that Revelation from God
[1:01:53] what it's supposed to be like and then
[1:01:55] then it can come together but without
[1:01:57] that you can be working and working and
[1:01:59] working and you can be really proud of
[1:02:01] the few pieces you've put together when
[1:02:02] you've got the picture wow it's so much
[1:02:08] easier you know there have been brother
[1:02:10] brandom says you know there have been
[1:02:11] some awful cold drafts blowing on the
[1:02:12] church in this generation and I'm afraid
[1:02:15] her eyes have sort of frozen shut and
[1:02:17] she's blind to what God's done for you
[1:02:19] he was talking about how up in the Log
[1:02:21] Cabin his his eyes be matted shut in the
[1:02:23] morning wife mom to get the grease
[1:02:25] to get them out to get to get them open
[1:02:26] back up again and the church needs some
[1:02:29] hot oil of the spirit of God to open her
[1:02:31] eyes unless she receives the spirit of
[1:02:33] God she will go on substituting program
[1:02:36] for power and Creed for word because the
[1:02:38] programs look great the special effects
[1:02:41] look great but that is no substitute for
[1:02:44] the power of God the Creeds can be very
[1:02:46] eloquent can seem to cover every single
[1:02:49] logical position possible but God is
[1:02:52] above all of that and we can't
[1:02:53] substitute Creed for word again God sent
[1:02:56] us he did not send us a theologian he
[1:02:58] didn't send us books with footnotes he
[1:03:00] sent us a prophet and we should be
[1:03:02] really thankful for that again without
[1:03:05] having our eyes Anointed with isav we'll
[1:03:08] count numbers for success rather than
[1:03:11] look for
[1:03:13] fruit all of this looking for true gold
[1:03:17] getting that white reignment anointing
[1:03:20] your eyes with isaf I I love the Sy
[1:03:23] symbolism because it enriches our our
[1:03:25] vision of what repentance is the next
[1:03:28] the next part of it is hey and some be
[1:03:31] zealous therefore and repent that's he's
[1:03:34] getting right down to
[1:03:36] it it's not easy to
[1:03:41] repent it takes some uh it takes the
[1:03:44] Holy Spirit to even help us to see that
[1:03:46] we there's something to be repented from
[1:03:49] because whatever we've grown up
[1:03:52] doing that is for us
[1:03:55] normal and normal is usually connected
[1:03:58] with being good why would I want to do
[1:04:00] something different this is normal but
[1:04:02] then when the gospel comes then oh wow
[1:04:06] this the way I've been seeing things
[1:04:08] isn't as good as I thought it
[1:04:11] was this is how as Sinners we grew up
[1:04:16] looking at the
[1:04:17] world and we think this is normal this
[1:04:20] is the way the world is this is how we
[1:04:22] see it and any attempt to to tell us the
[1:04:26] contrary yeah you've got it turn the
[1:04:28] wrong way you're looking at it the wrong
[1:04:29] way that's that's how we've always seen
[1:04:31] it but repentance has to do with being
[1:04:35] you're going One Direction and then you
[1:04:36] are being turned and going the other
[1:04:38] direction but there's also a lot of
[1:04:40] turning in us we need to be turned
[1:04:43] around and our whole mind gets turned
[1:04:46] around so that we can actually see
[1:04:48] things as they are that's because
[1:04:52] repentance turned to us around but
[1:04:55] there's a gradual turning around of the
[1:04:58] Holy Spirit working with us through the
[1:04:59] process of sanctification there's a
[1:05:01] Metamorphoses of our hearts and our
[1:05:04] minds that's a continuing work of the
[1:05:06] Holy Spirit when uh when Paul was he
[1:05:09] went from Philippi went down to
[1:05:11] thessalonica and he was not greeted with
[1:05:13] open arms after the first couple weeks
[1:05:16] uh one of his the one of the new
[1:05:17] Believers Jason had the magistrates
[1:05:19] pounding on his door because people were
[1:05:20] accusing him these are the people they
[1:05:22] believed that these guys they've turned
[1:05:24] turned our world upside
[1:05:26] down actually the gospel turns your
[1:05:29] world right side up cuz we didn't
[1:05:32] realize how we were looking at things
[1:05:34] everything was upside down the gospel
[1:05:36] comes and turns it right side up there
[1:05:39] we there we have
[1:05:40] that but the
[1:05:42] people battling diagnosis dueling
[1:05:45] diagnosis different vision of the world
[1:05:47] no that's wrong no this is right but
[1:05:50] we've got to be willing to listen and
[1:05:52] take a look at what repentance is
[1:05:54] is God is God is calling for repentance
[1:05:57] he says acts 3:19 reent ye
[1:06:00] therefore be turned
[1:06:03] around and be converted that change
[1:06:07] we're turning directions our our our
[1:06:09] Direction completely changes and we are
[1:06:12] also completely
[1:06:14] changed our sins get blotted out times
[1:06:17] of refreshing will come from the
[1:06:18] presence of the Lord and then um Revel
[1:06:21] sorry Romans chap 12 I besee you
[1:06:24] therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[1:06:26] your mind that you present your bodies a
[1:06:28] Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:06:31] God which is your reasonable service and
[1:06:34] this is something that we can do daily
[1:06:36] but there's also an act of repentance
[1:06:38] here we're presenting we're we're
[1:06:39] surrendering ourselves to God but I love
[1:06:42] verse two be not conformed to this world
[1:06:45] don't let the world push you into its
[1:06:48] mold but be be ye transformed by the
[1:06:52] renewing of your mind
[1:06:54] and this is a a metamorphosis that
[1:06:56] happens it doesn't happen right at the
[1:06:58] altar it starts there but then there's
[1:07:00] this sanctification where God is
[1:07:02] changing US changing us because our
[1:07:06] whole mental World our whole picture of
[1:07:08] the world has been wrong we don't re
[1:07:11] when we repent we don't realize how
[1:07:13] wrong we viewed the world there's so
[1:07:16] many things that we just kind of have
[1:07:18] hanging on because we think is normal
[1:07:20] but we're willing to lay everything down
[1:07:22] and say God tell me how to think tell me
[1:07:26] what it really means to look at the
[1:07:28] world the right side up because we have
[1:07:31] no idea repentance includes all of that
[1:07:33] it's not just the first step is turning
[1:07:36] around changing direction that can
[1:07:38] happen in an altar that can happen in
[1:07:39] your car wherever God's moving you but
[1:07:41] you you turn around change direction and
[1:07:43] you continually walk with him and you're
[1:07:45] being changed into His Image everything
[1:07:48] about your mind your heart your
[1:07:51] affections all these things are being
[1:07:53] gradually changed change it doesn't all
[1:07:54] happen at one moment some things
[1:07:56] remember brother Lonnie telling me it
[1:07:58] can be like this big meat cleaver that
[1:07:59] say one day I was smoking the next day I
[1:08:02] wasn't it was gone but there can be
[1:08:04] other things that hang on for a long
[1:08:06] time we battle battle battle and as we
[1:08:09] keep on renewing our mind with God's
[1:08:12] word those other tastes will gradually
[1:08:15] change and pass
[1:08:18] away
[1:08:20] amen when we look at this loud to say
[1:08:23] and
[1:08:24] age that's having this battle with the
[1:08:27] doctor disagreeing with everything that
[1:08:29] God's saying about them it doesn't look
[1:08:33] very hopeful for them it's a really a
[1:08:35] far cry from the Glorious church that we
[1:08:38] see described in Acts chapter 2
[1:08:40] throughout the Book of Acts much much
[1:08:42] different um and really if you look at
[1:08:45] the Arc of the church ages it seems that
[1:08:48] Satan and the false Vine have really had
[1:08:51] their way it seems like that
[1:08:54] even after the Reformation Sardis and
[1:08:57] the great missionary age in Philadelphia
[1:08:59] like my it has to end like this it looks
[1:09:04] like Satan is able to to keep the upper
[1:09:09] hand up upper hand and squats the
[1:09:11] Revival it seems
[1:09:14] hopeless and here's where we have to
[1:09:16] point ourselves back to the attributes
[1:09:20] that God draws our attention to at the
[1:09:23] very very beginning in Revelation
[1:09:25] chapter 3 because we we've spoken
[1:09:27] throughout how the attributes that God
[1:09:30] emphasizes as he introduces himself that
[1:09:32] has significance for the age so draw
[1:09:35] attention to this kind as we kind of
[1:09:36] wind things down these things Seth the
[1:09:40] amen that's an attribute of God the
[1:09:44] faithful and true witness that's an
[1:09:46] attribute of God the beginning of the
[1:09:48] creation of God God is saying each one
[1:09:51] of these things for a purpose the amen
[1:09:56] God has the last word it looks like and
[1:10:01] this layan message that looks like the
[1:10:04] Satan's ending with the upper hand and
[1:10:06] God's church is just Broken and Spilled
[1:10:09] Out worthless but God has the last
[1:10:14] word he will he will win the argument
[1:10:17] the devil will not the devil won't have
[1:10:19] anything to say when God's done we can
[1:10:21] apply that to the church age with you
[1:10:23] can apply that also to our daily life
[1:10:25] and the trials that we Face we can it
[1:10:27] seems like the trial we're in is endless
[1:10:30] it's never going to get better we can
[1:10:32] get so down and discouraged God has the
[1:10:35] last word Satan never has the last word
[1:10:38] in our trials God is the amen Satan
[1:10:41] might try to inject himself into the
[1:10:43] story but God has the pen to finish the
[1:10:46] story and a lot can happen in one or two
[1:10:48] pages and God makes sure the story of
[1:10:51] your life your children's life that he
[1:10:53] will bring that to the end because God
[1:10:56] does not start something and leave it
[1:10:58] Half
[1:11:01] Baked being confident of this very thing
[1:11:04] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:11:06] will be faithful and will to perform it
[1:11:09] to the day of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ he's also faithful and
[1:11:14] true when Paul writes in Ephesians 5
[1:11:17] about the about the bride of Christ who
[1:11:20] is uh who's without spot has no spot
[1:11:23] wrinkle any such thing Paul is
[1:11:26] describing but he's also speaking
[1:11:28] prophetically he's he's he's writing
[1:11:30] here in the book of in the time of the
[1:11:32] book of Acts to the Ephesian to to the
[1:11:34] Church of Ephesus but these words are
[1:11:36] prophetic over the ages there is going
[1:11:40] to be a bride of Christ she doesn't have
[1:11:42] spot or wrinkle or any such thing it's
[1:11:45] she's going to be there amen and Christ
[1:11:48] is faithful and true I said this I'll be
[1:11:52] faithful to perform it and you can
[1:11:54] connect this attribute of faithful and
[1:11:56] true here in Revelation 3 it comes up
[1:11:58] another time in Revelation chap 19 when
[1:12:01] it says he that is faithful and true is
[1:12:04] on this white horse and he's in
[1:12:06] righteousness he do judge and make war
[1:12:08] and the and the Bride Comes Down out of
[1:12:10] heaven with him and they defeat the
[1:12:13] enemies of Israel and they and they and
[1:12:15] they they come and defeat the Devil at
[1:12:17] the there at the Battle of Gog and Magog
[1:12:20] I I believe but this is that what God
[1:12:23] said it he is faithful and true he will
[1:12:26] perform it that's an attribute of God
[1:12:28] that we can take much much consolation
[1:12:31] from now and he's the beginning of the
[1:12:34] creation of God the beginning is always
[1:12:36] full of promise and again it appears
[1:12:39] Satan has successfully blocked out light
[1:12:41] and smothered Revival but God's word and
[1:12:44] God's nature removed that as a
[1:12:46] possibility he's the beginning of the
[1:12:48] creation of God which means he will not
[1:12:50] be alone there will be other sons and
[1:12:53] daughters of God who will come along
[1:12:55] because he is just the
[1:12:57] beginning a restoration is
[1:13:01] Promised uh let's go back to Revelation
[1:13:04] chapter
[1:13:13] 3 so verse uh 19 as many as I love I
[1:13:16] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[1:13:18] and repent again behold I stand at the
[1:13:21] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[1:13:23] and open the door I will come into him
[1:13:25] and will s with him and he with me to
[1:13:28] him that overcometh that means there's
[1:13:30] going to be an
[1:13:32] overcomer will I grant to sit with me in
[1:13:34] my throne even as I also overcame and am
[1:13:36] sat down with my father in his throne
[1:13:40] when the church ages
[1:13:42] begin it's just like Jesus Christ he
[1:13:44] died on the cross he was resurrected and
[1:13:48] he says except a corn of wheat fall
[1:13:50] under the ground and and die it abides
[1:13:53] alone that's why I have to give my life
[1:13:57] if I don't I I would abide alone and the
[1:13:59] church goes to the same cycle there in
[1:14:02] the church ages that corn of wheat is
[1:14:04] planted in the Ephesian Church age and
[1:14:07] then gradually it dies it seems to die
[1:14:10] throughout the ages and that's the
[1:14:12] miracle of it Satan thinks if I can just
[1:14:15] kill it I'll win no he's actually
[1:14:19] contributing to the seed's
[1:14:21] success so he he tries to kill it the
[1:14:24] seed dies in the ground and then a
[1:14:27] little radical Sprouts forth the first
[1:14:29] little root goes out and
[1:14:33] gradually this is what starts at
[1:14:37] Ephesus and it seems like at the end of
[1:14:39] the church ages you've got something
[1:14:42] like the stump and you can look at it
[1:14:45] man you can ask can this tree live again
[1:14:50] is that even possible and this is what
[1:14:52] the Jew Jews would have thought after
[1:14:55] Malachi there were a few faithful Jews
[1:14:58] there in the days of Zacharias and
[1:15:00] Elizabeth and Mary and Joseph there were
[1:15:03] a few Faith ones who were looking for a
[1:15:06] redeemer and Messiah to come the other
[1:15:08] ones it' been pretty tough what Babylon
[1:15:12] had left Persia had eaten up what Persia
[1:15:14] had left the Greeks had eat up what the
[1:15:16] Greeks left the Romans ate up there
[1:15:18] wasn't much hope for a messiah anymore
[1:15:21] and people would be looking my
[1:15:23] that's the great promise that was left
[1:15:25] can this tree ever live again and what
[1:15:28] Joel spoke applied to them that which
[1:15:32] the palmerworm has left that's the
[1:15:34] Locust eaten with the Locust has left
[1:15:36] the cankerworm is eaten with the canorth
[1:15:38] left the caterpillar is eaten there's
[1:15:39] nothing
[1:15:40] left the forces of antichrist have laid
[1:15:43] my Vine waste barked my fig tree laid it
[1:15:45] clean bear cast it away the branches
[1:15:47] thereof are made white it looks hopeless
[1:15:50] that's how it would have looked and in
[1:15:53] that Century before Christ was born but
[1:15:56] there was a prophecy Isaiah 11 says
[1:15:59] there shall come forth a Shute from the
[1:16:01] stump of Jesse and it looked like a
[1:16:04] hopeless case but a shoot came out of
[1:16:07] that I never knew that could happen
[1:16:10] years back I was trying to clean up my
[1:16:11] backyard in Holland and I borrowed I got
[1:16:14] this chainsaw I I I took some brush out
[1:16:17] took it down to the stump man did good
[1:16:19] work and then spring came and I'm
[1:16:22] getting ready to bike to work I look
[1:16:24] back hold up everything is sprouting
[1:16:27] from these stumps I thought I took care
[1:16:29] of it no you can think it but there's
[1:16:32] still life there and that's when Just
[1:16:34] Awaken me the devil can think he's
[1:16:36] chopped us off there's nothing left but
[1:16:38] as long as there's still connection to
[1:16:40] that seed and to that root there's life
[1:16:42] there and there was a root that a chute
[1:16:45] that came from the stump of Jesse a
[1:16:47] branch from his roots that was Christ
[1:16:49] but the same cycle that happened with
[1:16:51] Christ happened to the the end of the
[1:16:53] church ages also because those
[1:16:55] Prophecies of Joel what the Palmer worth
[1:16:58] left the canker eaten what the canker
[1:17:00] room left at the Locust eeden that's is
[1:17:02] the the spirit of antichrist the horse
[1:17:04] riders going through trying to kill away
[1:17:06] kill away kill away they did that to the
[1:17:08] church Ag and it looked like it was so
[1:17:10] successful but the promise was I will
[1:17:13] restore to you the years that the Locust
[1:17:16] has eaten the canker room with Eden this
[1:17:18] was fulfilled in the days of Jesus in
[1:17:21] the days of Peter it was also fulfilled
[1:17:23] bu at the day of Pentecost in 1906 when
[1:17:25] the Pentecostal blessing came down and
[1:17:28] he's been continuing to restore even the
[1:17:31] word to us because that's what was
[1:17:34] promised Matthew 17:11 says Eli Jesus
[1:17:37] says Elias truly shall first come and
[1:17:40] restore all things and he wasn't
[1:17:41] speaking of John the Baptist because
[1:17:43] John the Baptist was in no wise a
[1:17:45] restorer he was a preparer Jesus is
[1:17:48] speaking about the second fulfillment of
[1:17:50] Malachi 4 where it says I will send you
[1:17:53] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:17:55] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:17:58] he'll turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:18:00] the children that's what John the
[1:18:02] Baptist ministry was doing because the
[1:18:04] children of Israel were coming and were
[1:18:06] believing at Christ's feet and the
[1:18:09] fathers of Israel the Pharisees the
[1:18:11] Sadducees Saul was one of them Saul had
[1:18:14] his heart turned to see what the young
[1:18:17] Church of Church of Israel was was
[1:18:19] believing the Father's Heart was turned
[1:18:21] to the children through John the Baptist
[1:18:23] ministry to the to the disciples
[1:18:25] Ministry but at the end time the heart
[1:18:27] of the children will be turned back to
[1:18:30] the apostolic fathers and that is what
[1:18:32] we had an Elijah the prophet Ministry
[1:18:35] prophesied for in these last days and
[1:18:38] that is what the angel of the Church of
[1:18:41] laa does these and just look at the work
[1:18:45] of restoration that can be done the
[1:18:47] stump looks like a picture of
[1:18:49] hopelessness but there's a lot of Life
[1:18:52] there under that stump
[1:18:57] and this this this ministry of
[1:18:59] repentance first showing us what real
[1:19:02] repentance looks like that's what makes
[1:19:04] restoration possible because if a church
[1:19:07] is unwilling to repent if we as
[1:19:09] individuals are unwilling to repent how
[1:19:11] can we ever sit in Christ's Throne we
[1:19:13] can't we repent we follow the word of
[1:19:16] restoration the only way that we can sit
[1:19:19] in Christ throne with him is in like in
[1:19:21] verse 22 he that hath an ear let him
[1:19:23] hear what the spirit sayth under the
[1:19:25] churches but if like this patient who's
[1:19:28] listening to the doctor with his fingers
[1:19:29] in his
[1:19:30] ears he's not hearing what the doctor is
[1:19:34] saying to him we have to have our ears
[1:19:36] open to what God is speaking to us so
[1:19:38] that we can have a heart to repent a
[1:19:41] heart to change so that our mind can be
[1:19:43] transformed because you know what the
[1:19:45] media today was constantly working to
[1:19:47] turn that map back around and without
[1:19:50] the spirit of God it's going to tend to
[1:19:53] go back back back back back before we
[1:19:55] realize it we'll be raising our hands in
[1:19:57] church on Sundays and thinking like
[1:19:58] heathens throughout the week we let be
[1:20:01] transformed continually by the renewing
[1:20:04] of your mind that is a continual process
[1:20:07] we can never say we've arrived continue
[1:20:10] to transform me amen and we have this
[1:20:14] promise of Overcomer because this is a
[1:20:16] restoration this is Paving the way for
[1:20:19] us to be restored back to the same
[1:20:21] Dominion that Adam and Eve had there in
[1:20:23] the Garden of Eden because we will have
[1:20:24] the same Authority as the as the King of
[1:20:26] Kings has sitting with him there in the
[1:20:30] throne and then I'm going to end with I
[1:20:33] want to read this last paragraph from
[1:20:35] the uh Church age book and then we'll be
[1:20:37] finished for this evening I think this
[1:20:39] is brother Brandon expresses really
[1:20:41] clearly what the purpose of his ministry
[1:20:44] is he says not for one moment do I bring
[1:20:48] a message to the people that they may
[1:20:50] follow me or join my my church or start
[1:20:54] some fellowship an organization I have
[1:20:56] never done that and will not do that now
[1:20:58] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:21:02] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:21:05] and people because if you love God you
[1:21:08] love people
[1:21:09] too and if I can accomplish just one
[1:21:12] thing I will be satisfied what's that
[1:21:15] one thing that one thing is to see
[1:21:19] established a true spiritual
[1:21:22] relationship
[1:21:23] between God and Men wherein men become
[1:21:26] New Creations in Christ filled with his
[1:21:29] spirit and live according to his
[1:21:32] word that's the one thing Lord may we
[1:21:35] have a true relationship a true
[1:21:38] spiritual not the true works
[1:21:40] relationship but a true spiritual
[1:21:42] relationship between with with the Lord
[1:21:43] he says I would invite plead and warn
[1:21:46] all to hear his voice at this time and
[1:21:50] yield your lives completely to him even
[1:21:52] as I trust in my heart that I have given
[1:21:54] my all to him God bless you and may his
[1:21:57] coming Rejoice your heart and it does
[1:22:00] Amen let's
[1:22:02] pray Heavenly Father we thank you very
[1:22:04] much for your goodness and your grace to
[1:22:06] us father and just as we spent last uh
[1:22:10] service and this one looking at the
[1:22:12] conditions of the church age that
[1:22:14] surrounds us father I'm even more
[1:22:17] thankful than ever before that there has
[1:22:18] been a message to call us outen thank
[1:22:22] you Lord for showing us so vividly what
[1:22:24] repentance looks like it can be so easy
[1:22:28] to get our eyes on the wrong things and
[1:22:30] and start valuing the gold that is
[1:22:32] hawked on Amazon the gold that's hawked
[1:22:35] at the stores and we want want those
[1:22:37] kinds of things but Lord I pray that you
[1:22:39] would help us to have that
[1:22:41] value even for the trials that you put
[1:22:44] into us we may have real gold Christlike
[1:22:46] character bought by bought in the
[1:22:48] furnace of Affliction Lord father I pray
[1:22:50] that you would encourage each one Lord I
[1:22:53] pray for those who are still sick at
[1:22:54] home father you would raise them up Lord
[1:22:57] I just pray that you would bless us even
[1:22:59] as these in these end times that can be
[1:23:01] so deceiving Lord I pray that you would
[1:23:02] help us to keep our ears open that we
[1:23:05] may hear what the spirit is continuing
[1:23:07] to say to the churches oh God draw Us
[1:23:09] close to you we pray in Jesus name amen
[1:23:12] God bless you amen thank you brother rap
[1:23:15] appreciate the teaching praise the
[1:23:19] lord well I just say Jesus help us amen
[1:23:23] and he has come and and as much as we
[1:23:25] rejoice in the at the end there the
[1:23:28] promise of restoration in an age so bad
[1:23:31] we rejoice in that because we're part of
[1:23:33] that too by God's grace we still take
[1:23:35] the rebuke you know it's such a strong
[1:23:37] rebuke to think that we're in a time
[1:23:39] that as brother rap said there are the
[1:23:41] last few words that we could be raising
[1:23:43] higher in chch in church on Sunday and
[1:23:45] living like in a heathen the rest of the
[1:23:47] week it's only in this age that Satan
[1:23:50] allows people and leads people to live
[1:23:52] that that way live like a heathen
[1:23:53] through the week and raise your hand
[1:23:54] worship on Sunday we don't want to be
[1:23:56] living that way and so I thought it was
[1:23:58] really neat he said this age is a real
[1:24:00] battle with the doctor it's a battle
[1:24:02] with the doctor because only doct Jesus
[1:24:04] can diagnose us perfectly and um it's I
[1:24:09] was it's kind of funny how people do go
[1:24:11] I was talking to my daughter this week
[1:24:13] about just the lack of trust sometimes
[1:24:15] and you know they call it a practice so
[1:24:17] they're practicing on you and so but
[1:24:19] people argue all times with the with the
[1:24:21] doctor and such but this is Dr Jesus and
[1:24:24] he's the only one qualified to diagnose
[1:24:26] this age and we might as well make it to
[1:24:29] the individual he's the only one
[1:24:31] qualified to diagnose your spiritual
[1:24:33] life you don't diagnose it yourself cuz
[1:24:35] if you do you're going to come out
[1:24:36] smelling like a rose but thank God for a
[1:24:40] doctor like a mechanic or a good
[1:24:42] mechanic or good they're going to tell
[1:24:43] you the truth going to tell you the
[1:24:46] truth I don't like a mechanic that is
[1:24:48] giving me stuff I need to do in my car
[1:24:49] that don't really need to be done but
[1:24:51] then he's hiding and other things as
[1:24:53] well I like to shoot I like them to
[1:24:54] shoot straight I like a doctor to shoot
[1:24:56] straight and Dr Jesus shoot shot
[1:25:00] straight with this leoan age he
[1:25:02] diagnosed it it was rough words it was
[1:25:04] straight words and they didn't want to
[1:25:06] hear it for the most part but I'd rather
[1:25:09] trust Dr Jesus diagnosis than my own or
[1:25:13] a denomination or my families I'd rather
[1:25:17] trust his diagnosis because in the end
[1:25:19] this doctor is going to help us get out
[1:25:22] and and uh so I wanted to say uh tonight
[1:25:25] we come to the end of this series and
[1:25:27] it's been such a joy to enjoy this study
[1:25:30] for the last year and a half I wanted
[1:25:32] brother rap to uh to to bring it out we
[1:25:35] can get some good videos of it because I
[1:25:37] know not only want it for the Believers
[1:25:39] here and whoever else you want to refer
[1:25:41] to it if they want to settle down and
[1:25:44] study you see the thing is is that the
[1:25:46] church ages we're we're at the end we're
[1:25:49] at the very end so now we're looking
[1:25:51] back to 2,000 years since Christianity
[1:25:54] began and you all have learned that
[1:25:57] right after Christianity began the
[1:25:59] Antichrist Spirit come in to to
[1:26:02] duplicate excuse Not Duplicate but to
[1:26:04] try to impersonate so so now at the end
[1:26:08] um those those who lived during those
[1:26:11] ages that were Believers were anointed
[1:26:14] to overcome that age they were given an
[1:26:17] anointing to overcome whatever the
[1:26:18] Antichrist Spirit was doing but they
[1:26:20] didn't know what was going on true you
[1:26:23] see they didn't really know the
[1:26:24] diagnosis they didn't really know they
[1:26:26] just had the anointing to overcome it
[1:26:28] and sometimes we're that way we don't
[1:26:29] really have all the answers but if we're
[1:26:31] the under the anointing we're going to
[1:26:33] overcome but the benefit of the last age
[1:26:36] with the seventh angel he will go back
[1:26:39] now and diagnose not just the seventh
[1:26:43] Church age but he'll look into all that
[1:26:45] say this is what was happening in
[1:26:46] Ephesians this is what was it we're
[1:26:48] really blessed cuz those Saints didn't
[1:26:50] get to see that but now at the end the
[1:26:53] seventh angel takes us through this
[1:26:54] process is this is what was happening
[1:26:56] Ephesus Mna pergamus for 2,000 years
[1:26:59] then he gets to the last one and so
[1:27:01] we're really blessed in this time under
[1:27:04] the seventh angel and under ministers
[1:27:06] and teachers like this to break this
[1:27:08] down but and so if you're interested if
[1:27:11] you're interested I wanted to have it
[1:27:13] you can get a church age book in the
[1:27:15] library I want to make this available
[1:27:18] eventually on YouTube that anybody that
[1:27:20] you witness to that it's a serious Bible
[1:27:24] studier of the last 2,000 years they can
[1:27:27] go to that and they can they can they
[1:27:30] can we can send them a church age book
[1:27:32] you can have one in the library you can
[1:27:34] get a church age book you can sit down
[1:27:36] if it takes you another two years to
[1:27:37] study you can take this PE piece by
[1:27:40] piece if you're a serious Bible studier
[1:27:42] and you can you'll have you'll be able
[1:27:44] to download these notes from Brother rap
[1:27:46] and you'll be able to watch the videos
[1:27:48] and take your time and study it right
[1:27:50] off of YouTube and I wanted that and now
[1:27:52] it's completed tonight and i' say praise
[1:27:54] the Lord we've got something because I
[1:27:56] believe and I'm not to build up I'm not
[1:27:58] building up brother rat but I do really
[1:27:59] appreciate because I think he's really
[1:28:01] broke this down uh very well uh through
[1:28:05] the gift that God has given him and it's
[1:28:07] very easy to understand and very uh much
[1:28:10] in line with what the seventh angel
[1:28:12] brought us and so it's very good and
[1:28:14] it's completed tonight um and so we
[1:28:17] appreciate it and we want to say thank
[1:28:19] you for the labors in the word the last
[1:28:21] year and a half of all the study hours
[1:28:23] that brother rap has gone through to do
[1:28:25] this thank you brother rap amen um he
[1:28:29] mentioned tonight he's been coming here
[1:28:31] seven years now and this church has
[1:28:32] benefited from uh his gift growing in
[1:28:36] this way um do you want to take the
[1:28:38] Seven Seals now and go through
[1:28:40] them we're talking about it um but you
[1:28:44] know uh he's grown so much in his gift
[1:28:46] and we have B the benefit here and also
[1:28:49] other places that's listening in uh and
[1:28:52] his family has grown his his in in the
[1:28:54] Lord and so it's been a good thing for
[1:28:57] us and it's a good thing for them so we
[1:28:59] thank the Lord for what he's done so
[1:29:01] I'll say it again we'll have this now if
[1:29:04] those who are listening in charge of the
[1:29:05] technical stuff let's get all these
[1:29:07] notes on the YouTube so that when you go
[1:29:09] to YouTube you can listen to brother rap
[1:29:11] you can take your church age book you've
[1:29:13] got the notes here that I've enjoyed
[1:29:15] going through each Wednesday that he
[1:29:17] preaches it but these are great notes
[1:29:19] with all the scriptures and uh also you
[1:29:22] have the Powerpoints on there as well so
[1:29:24] let's get that done as well so you got
[1:29:26] about four sources there as you study it
[1:29:28] the Powerpoints he's using and he had a
[1:29:30] lot of really good ones the notes and
[1:29:32] everything you could just really settle
[1:29:34] down and study it and go back over it
[1:29:36] again so I think that's good amen let's
[1:29:38] Stand Together get in to sing a few
[1:29:40] songs and I thank the Lord for his
[1:29:42] healing to the body of Christ there's

[1:30:10] Saturday on the back is a night of
[1:30:12] worship at Brother Sam Browning's church
[1:30:15] I can't remember the time I think it's 4
[1:30:16] or 5:00 and there's a flyer back there
[1:30:19] with the address and so that's a nice
[1:30:21] singing going on if you want to attend
[1:30:23] that and then he has brother Trevor
[1:30:25] enman Sunday morning and then Sunday
[1:30:27] afternoon is youth meeting there we
[1:30:29] encourage our young people if you're not
[1:30:30] doing anything to drive over I've
[1:30:32] hearing good things about Trevor enman
[1:30:33] brother Trevor enman really uh good
[1:30:36] Minister for the Youth so that is Sunday
[1:30:38] night at brother Sam's and then a
[1:30:39] singing Saturday brother Josiah will
[1:30:42] speak this Sunday uh for about the last
[1:30:45] probably 10 years uh precious Pastor up
[1:30:48] here brother John Martin has asked me to
[1:30:50] come a Sunday and to speak speak for
[1:30:52] them and so I think it's been 10 years
[1:30:54] he's asked for a or more than he's asked
[1:30:57] for a Sunday so I feel glad of the Lord
[1:30:59] to go and help that group and just in
[1:31:02] whatever way I can so this uh weekend

[1:31:07] home praise the Lord I think that's all
[1:31:09] the announcements let's continue to pray
[1:31:10] for one another and then Lord willing
[1:31:13] since we finish this series next
[1:31:15] Wednesday night we will be uh back in

[1:31:33] choruses and close the service
[1:31:35] tonight Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:31:39] humbled to hear these things and we are
[1:31:41] blessed to live at the last age because
[1:31:44] now our eyes have been open to look back
[1:31:46] and see all the traps of the enemy all
[1:31:50] the the exposing the two Vines the false
[1:31:53] Church the true church both claiming
[1:31:55] Christ we're just so blessed that our
[1:31:58] eyes see this and Lord the result and
[1:32:00] fruit should be that we not live in this
[1:32:03] age in a lukewarm state that we' live
[1:32:06] through the week as as as a heathen and
[1:32:08] then try to be but we not live that way
[1:32:12] not be lukewarm not cold nor hot but
[1:32:15] Lord that we would ask you to just burn
[1:32:18] those holy fires within us and let us be
[1:32:20] on fire for you let be uh just
[1:32:23] passionate for you when we make a
[1:32:25] mistake that we quickly repent of it
[1:32:27] Lord repentance is the way out of Leo
[1:32:29] deia uh The Cry of the Bride is I'm
[1:32:32] wrong Lord you're right and we're wrong
[1:32:35] we humbly say we're wrong and you're
[1:32:37] right and may we find true repentance
[1:32:41] that's not just an exercise upon our
[1:32:43] lips but may we find it a change in our
[1:32:46] hearts that we this diagnosis we would
[1:32:49] not stay in this state of wretched and
[1:32:52] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:32:55] but we could be redeemed and and Rise
[1:32:58] Above It Lord and be called one of those
[1:33:00] Overcomers to the leoan age and I think
[1:33:04] of the song that Sher wrote my sister
[1:33:05] Sher wrote that when we get on the other
[1:33:08] side someday and others gather around us
[1:33:11] who came from this age and they say are
[1:33:14] you
[1:33:14] she the Bride of the last
[1:33:17] days who stood such Temptation and such
[1:33:21] lukew Warmness and yet there was some
[1:33:23] Overcomers Lord I want to be one of them
[1:33:26] I want to be one of those that escaped
[1:33:28] this age help me give me more of the
[1:33:31] Holy Spirit give me more repentant heart
[1:33:34] give me a humble Heart Lord that I could
[1:33:37] be one of those that would be escaped of
[1:33:41] Israel that beautiful branch in the last
[1:33:44] days mold me into that father whatever
[1:33:47] you have to do mold me into it and
[1:33:49] tonight we learn Lord that our trials
[1:33:51] are the gold that we need to seek after
[1:33:54] not Riches of this life not to be a big
[1:33:57] church not to be a wellknown famous
[1:34:00] church not to seek for
[1:34:03] numbers but Lord the pouring out of your
[1:34:05] Holy Ghost upon the people salvation
