[5:51] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord

[5:57] verse 1 says and the Lord spake unto
[5:59] Moses Moes saying Speak unto the
[6:01] children of Israel and say unto them
[6:03] concerning the Feast of the Lord which
[6:05] ye shall Proclaim to be holy
[6:08] convocations even these are my Feast so
[6:11] they're holy convocations I want you to
[6:13] remember that term God calls these Feast
[6:16] holy convocations even these that are my
[6:19] feasts six days shall work shall work be
[6:22] done but the seventh day is a Sabbath of
[6:25] rest a holy convocation youu you shall
[6:29] do no work therein it is the Sabbath of
[6:32] the Lord in all your dwellings these are
[6:35] the feasts of the Lord even holy
[6:37] convocations which ye shall Proclaim in
[6:41] their season I didn't realize till today
[6:44] that when I speak about the Holy con uh
[6:47] convocations that God has here he called
[6:49] them holy convocations he called these
[6:52] seven feasts that he said that would be
[6:54] three times a year the children of
[6:56] Israel would come and visit Jerusalem
[6:57] three times a year and there would be a
[6:59] celebration there would be a feast and
[7:01] every one of these feasts are different
[7:02] the first three happened together and
[7:04] then just a little while after the
[7:05] fourth one happened and then later in
[7:07] the season in the fall they would come
[7:09] back for the last three but three uh
[7:12] they had to visit Jerusalem and come for
[7:14] these these celebrations and these
[7:16] things that a acknowledged God and what
[7:19] God was doing got what God did and so
[7:21] now I didn't realize uh when it was
[7:23] speaking about convoca convocation I
[7:25] thought it was like our modern day
[7:27] graduation but I realized
[7:29] there's a different difference between a
[7:31] convocation and a graduation and I'm
[7:33] going to get to that in a little bit so
[7:34] we know the difference between a
[7:36] convocation that's the term God is using
[7:38] here and a graduation so it's uh
[7:41] graduations are pretty exciting and
[7:43] those that are graduating it's it's
[7:45] means that you finish something and
[7:47] there's celebrations for that and
[7:48] there's appreciations for it there's an
[7:50] event you attend the event and uh but
[7:53] but the convocation is something much
[7:56] much deeper has a deeper meaning than
[7:58] just the graduation ation and so this
[8:00] will be spilling over tonight a little
[8:02] bit from my theme that I had on Sunday
[8:06] and that is that we must be personally
[8:09] connected to what Calvary did for you
[8:12] every believer every young person every
[8:15] person must have a personal connection
[8:19] with what Calvary means to you and what
[8:21] he did for you at the cross less it
[8:24] becomes a ritual less it becomes a
[8:25] tradition and uh so we don't want that
[8:28] to happen so there must be a personal
[8:30] connection and there must be a feeling
[8:33] of it there must feel that you feel what
[8:35] God has done for you and feel it
[8:37] personally to you and that there's a
[8:38] power that will come in your life
[8:40] because of the sacrifice of Calvary
[8:44] every believer every person needs to
[8:47] have a personal connection with that and
[8:49] so this will spill over into that theme
[8:51] tonight as we talk about those things
[8:53] now I just want to take a moment in
[8:54] couple of these slides and bring back
[8:55] the seven feasts and this will be real
[8:57] basic so everybody even the child can
[8:59] understand it and I want to bring up
[9:01] that first slide and show you and this
[9:02] is I was borrowed this today from
[9:04] somebody because because then I didn't
[9:05] have to do the work of putting them all
[9:07] together and you'll read it in Leviticus
[9:09] 23 um you'll read all these feasts
[9:12] that's where you find it you want to
[9:13] read it on your own and these are the
[9:14] seven feasts that God set up for the
[9:16] children of Israel to come and to uh
[9:19] gather together and to C and every one
[9:22] of these had a meaning to them I think a
[9:24] uh a few of these had the Lamb with it
[9:26] most of these had the lamb where they
[9:27] brought the sacrificial lamb for their
[9:29] sins and the priest would bring it in
[9:31] but these were the biblical he calls
[9:33] them biblical holidays and they have
[9:34] actually become that more and more the
[9:36] Jews still celebrate these things the
[9:38] true Jews and they're holidays they're
[9:39] times set aside just like our American
[9:41] holidays and so there is a meaning
[9:43] behind them and so the first four
[9:45] happened in the spring uh spring days in
[9:48] that season and the first one was the
[9:51] Passover uh and then the second one was
[9:53] the UN Feast of unleavened bread and the
[9:56] third one was the first fruits and then
[9:58] the fourth one was the Feast of
[10:00] Pentecost and every one of these had uh
[10:02] different something similar they did
[10:04] when they come to Jerusalem and then
[10:06] sometimes they had different things they
[10:07] did in each one and if you study them
[10:10] and if you got an open heart every one
[10:11] of them has a meaning every one of them
[10:13] has something significant and every one
[10:15] of them point to Christ and not just
[10:17] Christ it points to Christ in our own
[10:19] lives and so that's the first four and
[10:21] then there's a space of time there that
[10:24] goes to the fall and then the other
[10:26] three are picked up now to me that says
[10:29] to me that you have something happening
[10:31] early on that's a fulfillment and Christ
[10:33] fulfilled them and then you have a space
[10:35] and then at the end time this would be
[10:37] the end time this would be the last days
[10:39] and this fellow said historically these
[10:41] were fulfilled during Jesus first coming
[10:43] he's exactly right these four feasts
[10:46] were had the the spiritual fulfillment
[10:49] of them the Jews did the ritual the Jews
[10:52] did the actual a feast days but there
[10:55] was a fulfillment spiritually that
[10:57] happened in each of these where once the
[11:00] once the spiritual fulfillment was there
[11:02] happening once the true Passover Lamb
[11:04] was there once the true unleavened bread
[11:07] was there once the the resurrection took
[11:10] took place and once there was a
[11:11] Pentecost then you had the spiritual
[11:13] fulfillment you didn't go back and like
[11:15] the Jews are doing today because they
[11:16] don't see the Messiah they're still
[11:17] celebrating the old ritual but once the
[11:20] spiritual thing comes along then you
[11:22] don't go back to the ritual it's kind of
[11:24] like what happens in our lives and that
[11:26] is that once there's a new birth once
[11:28] there's a real New Birth it's not a
[11:30] ritual anymore it's not a duty anymore
[11:33] it's not a dress code anymore can you
[11:35] say Amen something has happened and
[11:38] Christ has become real to you and the
[11:40] message and the word and everything is a
[11:42] manifestation out of you it's not
[11:45] something you're trying to do on the
[11:46] outside I'm supposed to do this these
[11:48] probably people probably thought I got
[11:50] to get to that Jerusalem I'm supposed to
[11:52] do this this is a duty and so they got
[11:53] the family together and got in their
[11:55] minivan three times a year whether they
[11:58] wanted to or not not some years and they
[11:59] did it as a ritual but once the
[12:01] spiritual part took place then it was no
[12:04] longer a ritual it was an
[12:06] experience it was a reality can you say
[12:08] Amen so in the Old Testament they did
[12:11] that but Christ fulfilled all these and
[12:13] then all of a sudden because this speaks
[12:15] of the end time then he says to be
[12:17] fulfilled during the second coming of
[12:18] Christ and he's exactly right because
[12:20] now we go 2,000 years in between this
[12:22] spot this was a year for the Jews so you
[12:25] figure the first three months there and
[12:26] you can look up which months they which
[12:28] dates they uh celebrated and then
[12:31] there's a space of time of about 3
[12:33] months or four months then it picks up
[12:35] the Feast of trumpets Feast the Feast of
[12:37] atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles
[12:39] so it all speaks to these last three
[12:41] happening at the end time our ears
[12:43] should be perked up because we live in
[12:45] the end time we live in the last days
[12:48] and so we see then that these are the
[12:51] ones that become significant to us
[12:54] because these are already fulfilled now
[12:56] we still sing about Christ's death we
[12:59] still celebrate what he did at the cross
[13:01] we still celebrate the resurrection we
[13:04] we we still celebrate that he's the
[13:06] bread the unleavened bread how many know
[13:08] Christ is those things and we C
[13:10] celebrate the original Pentecost but but
[13:12] traditionally we don't want to keep
[13:14] looking back to that we've got to find
[13:16] the season that God is in right now cuz
[13:18] the same God that fulfilled those feasts
[13:20] right now is ready to fulfill these so
[13:24] once again the Bible says Seasons you
[13:27] have to be in the season there's a lot
[13:29] of Christianity that's still celebrating
[13:32] you know uh in in the in what was done
[13:34] 2,000 years ago and they're still
[13:37] celebrating it but they don't realize
[13:38] prophets being is being fulfilled right
[13:40] now and the same God that fulfilled
[13:42] those feasts now is ready to fulfill
[13:45] these and is already spiritually
[13:46] fulfilling them I don't know what else
[13:48] to say except for as far as on this part
[13:51] it's just I wanted a visual for
[13:52] everybody to be able to see this is what
[13:54] they look like and this is the time span
[13:56] between the first four and the last
[13:58] three first three were fulfilled Christ
[14:01] fulfills all seven he's the Fulfillment
[14:04] of all the seven feasts but he fulfills
[14:07] the first three in his in his body in
[14:10] other words Jesus of Nazareth he
[14:12] fulfills the first three but he fulfills
[14:14] the last four actually in the body of
[14:18] Christ his people amen and how do I know
[14:22] that we may still be looking at these
[14:24] here but I know that it was Christ
[14:27] coming on the day of pentec cost and it
[14:29] was him fulfilling the Feast of
[14:31] Pentecost but what body was he using 120
[14:35] in the upper room being filled with the
[14:37] Holy Ghost so that day and incidentally
[14:40] if you read Acts chapter 2 and verse one
[14:42] it says and and when the day of
[14:44] Pentecost was fully come they're
[14:46] actually meeting on the day that the
[14:49] Jews were celebrating Pentecost the very
[14:52] day when the day of Pentecost was fully
[14:54] come they were in an upper room and they
[14:57] were praying in one Accord and God
[15:01] fulfilled the spiritual meaning of
[15:02] Pentecost on the very same day that
[15:05] others were going to the ritual God was
[15:08] fulfilling the Fulfillment he was doing
[15:10] it Christ but where was he doing it
[15:12] filling his people with the Holy Ghost
[15:14] here's another way that we know that is
[15:16] that he fulfilled this in his body
[15:19] because this is unleavened bread and
[15:21] unleavened bread is with 11 is sin so
[15:24] there was no sin in this bread that's
[15:27] right okay that means it had to be that
[15:30] body of Christ cuz he's the only one
[15:32] without sin when we come to the Feast of
[15:36] Pentecost in that feast in the Jews they
[15:38] used leaven bread that means sin was in
[15:42] it that means it wasn't the body of
[15:45] Christ it was our body because he filled
[15:47] 120 believers who were born in sin
[15:50] shaped in iniquity and he still saved
[15:52] them still filled them with the Holy
[15:54] Ghost and gave them the Conquering power
[15:57] over sin in their lives so that was
[15:59] leaven bread that's why I know that
[16:01] couldn't have been the actual Body of
[16:03] Christ it was the people of God
[16:05] fulfilling the day of Pentecost and
[16:08] every one of them back in those four
[16:10] happened on the very day that the ritual
[16:13] and the F the the the old holiday was
[16:16] being celebrated God was filling it
[16:18] fulfilling it on the very day and I
[16:20] don't know if I'll get through this
[16:21] scripture but Jesus attended all these
[16:23] Jesus attended the
[16:25] synagogues Jesus went to church that's
[16:29] right Jesus attended and he's he C catch
[16:32] this now he's attending all of these
[16:34] feasts and he's there he's present and
[16:37] yet while he's walking in the door and
[16:39] walking into the temple and around and
[16:42] while he's doing all that he knows in
[16:44] his heart he's the
[16:47] Fulfillment amen he's the Fulfillment of
[16:50] this Feast praise God Amen how be it
[16:53] tonight if we could catch a revelation
[16:54] that when we're coming to church we're
[16:56] not just coming to church that's right
[16:59] amen we're not here to hear a sermon but
[17:01] I want to be the actual fulfillment of
[17:03] what's being pre preached can you say
[17:05] amen I want to be what's being preached
[17:08] I want to live that out I want to be
[17:10] Christ and whatever Feast he's
[17:11] fulfilling whatever God's doing I want
[17:13] to be the manifestation of what God's
[17:15] doing I don't want Church to become a
[17:16] ritual I'm going to talk about that more
[17:18] here in a little bit so that's it I hope
[17:19] that's a good visual for you that's how
[17:21] you kind of see these broken down so if
[17:23] we go to the next one then I broke these
[17:26] down later to realize that Christ is the
[17:29] Fulfillment here's some scriptures that
[17:31] show that Purge out therefore the old
[17:32] leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye
[17:35] are unleavened for even Christ Our
[17:38] Passover is sacrificed for us that's the
[17:41] scripture identifies he's the
[17:43] Fulfillment of the feast to Passover so
[17:45] the Feast of unleavened bread is that
[17:47] did Christ fulfill that John 6 I am the
[17:49] living bread which came down from heaven
[17:51] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[17:53] live forever and the bread that I will
[17:55] give is my flesh which I will give for
[17:57] the life of the Lord how may raise your
[17:58] hand say he's the Fulfillment of that
[18:01] Feast of unleavened bread amen if you
[18:04] don't if you read the Old Testament
[18:06] don't forget now and don't see Christ
[18:09] it's all Christ being revealed okay it
[18:12] goes from the ritual to the reality 1
[18:14] Corinthians 15:20 but now is Christ
[18:17] risen from the dead Feast of fruits
[18:19] first fruits in the Old Testament means
[18:21] that they had to take whatever crop
[18:24] whatever come out of the ground first
[18:26] whatever was resurrected first they took
[18:28] the first fruits and they gave it as a
[18:29] tithe the first fruit so Christ was the
[18:31] first one that come out of the Grave
[18:33] from the dead that's what it says so
[18:35] he's the Fulfillment of this Feast of
[18:37] first fruits but now has Christ risen
[18:39] from the dead and become the first
[18:40] fruits of them that slept Christ is the
[18:43] Fulfillment of the Feast of first fruits
[18:45] on Resurrection Day He fulfilled that
[18:47] feast and we'll have a part in that when
[18:50] we resurrect
[18:51] someday the Feast of Pentecost acts 2:14
[18:54] says and when the day of Pentecost was
[18:56] fully come they were all in one Accord
[18:58] in one place and suddenly there came a
[19:00] sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty
[19:02] Wind and it filled all the house where
[19:04] they were sitting and they were all
[19:06] filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[19:08] Ghost is Christ it's not the third
[19:10] person of the Trinity it's Christ Christ
[19:13] was fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost
[19:16] where in the people you Lord so the
[19:18] ritual was over with can you say amen
[19:20] and the reality had come to pass and
[19:23] they were there and Christ was
[19:24] fulfilling it through his people Feast
[19:27] of trumpets Matthew 431 and he shall
[19:29] send his angels with a great sound of a
[19:32] trumpet and they shall gather together
[19:34] his elect from the Four Winds from one
[19:37] end of Heaven to the other now this is
[19:39] fulfilled every one of these are
[19:41] fulfilled had a fulfillment for the Jews
[19:44] who are God's people and he then he
[19:46] allowed the Gentiles a bride to come in
[19:49] so we have two sides of it going to be
[19:51] see the spiritual fulfillment and that
[19:53] this Feast of trumpets will gather the
[19:55] people from the four corners of the
[19:57] earth that are his people that have been
[19:59] scattered because remember they were
[20:00] pushed out of Jerusalem their Temple was
[20:02] destroyed so they ended up going over
[20:03] Generations around the world but God
[20:06] says I'll use my trumpets to gather the
[20:09] people back into their Homeland again
[20:11] for the purpose of bringing them to the
[20:14] the six feasts and so the purpose of
[20:17] gathering the people together is to
[20:19] bring them back into the home Homeland
[20:21] so he can reveal himself someday to the
[20:24] Jews and they can realize oh we killed
[20:26] our Messiah oh we didn't know they'll
[20:28] mourn for days and they'll come back to
[20:30] what our atonement is not in the blood
[20:33] of BS and goats but are we killed the
[20:36] atonement he was crucified for us and
[20:38] actually the two prophets that come to
[20:40] Israel will give them the revelation of
[20:42] all seven of these feasts and the elect
[20:45] will catch it and say my I've been
[20:47] worshiping under a ritual all these
[20:49] years I realize Christ is the
[20:51] Fulfillment to all these and they will
[20:53] begin to have a Revival again because
[20:55] they realize Christ is fulfilled
[20:58] thankfully the bride is already
[21:00] recognizing these things I'm preaching
[21:02] it to you tonight but one day the Jews
[21:04] are going to catch the same thing the
[21:05] Feast of atonement he gathers them
[21:07] together to the Feast of atonement and
[21:10] not only so but we also joy in God
[21:12] through Lord Jesus Christ by whom we all
[21:14] now have the atonement there's more to
[21:16] there's more scriptures to the atonement
[21:18] there's more scriptures to what the
[21:20] meaning of the atonement is because it
[21:22] doesn't necessarily mean that uh Christ
[21:24] has to die for our sins again he already
[21:26] did but it's coming to the full
[21:28] revelation of what the atonement is the
[21:31] Jews will come to that but the bride is
[21:33] coming to that now true realization and
[21:36] revelation of what Christ did for me at
[21:39] Calvary and what that means to me in
[21:41] life in power in overcoming complexes
[21:45] and overcoming h family habits inherent
[21:48] habits can you say Amen the power of
[21:51] Calvary will dissolve it all that's
[21:53] right amen that's our atonement and if
[21:55] we're not living in our atonement we'll
[21:57] keep keep keep those habits we'll keep
[21:59] those little those flaws and those
[22:01] things that are there we'll hold on to
[22:02] them but the power of Calvary the
[22:04] atonement you got a revelation of it
[22:06] you're going to be released of all these
[22:07] things that you can't overcome yourself
[22:10] lot more scriptures to that but he is
[22:12] the Fulfillment of the Feast of
[22:13] atonement and that's happening that's
[22:15] you want to know the season for this
[22:17] this is happening right now because
[22:18] we've already been gathered we've
[22:21] already been our Feast of trumpets
[22:22] spiritually but now we're we're
[22:24] celebrating and we're worshiping under
[22:26] this Feast we're we're coming to church
[22:29] and we're in the word every day because
[22:30] Lord show me the power more and more of
[22:33] what you've done for me at Calvary and
[22:36] let me live in it in
[22:38] Victory forget this traditional idea
[22:41] that I'm just thinking about some you
[22:44] know some Christ of history let me live
[22:47] in the power and reality of what the
[22:50] cross has done for me and then the last
[22:52] one is the Feast of Tabernacles which is
[22:53] a great study 2 Corinthians 51:4 we know
[22:57] that if our Earth House of this
[22:58] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[23:01] building of God a house not made with
[23:03] hands Eternal in the heavens so this is
[23:06] the final Revelation that we will dwell
[23:09] if you go in the Book of Revelations God
[23:11] shall Tabernacle himself with his people
[23:14] that's the final Feast of Tabernacles is
[23:16] that he'll put us back in a millennium
[23:18] and God will his Tabernacle is with men
[23:21] and in men can you say Amen but right
[23:24] now we're catching the Revelation and
[23:26] hearing from our theophanies that we
[23:28] have an eternal body just in the next
[23:30] Dimension that we will go to someday
[23:33] it's a tabernacle not made with hands
[23:35] it's a tabernacle it's another body can
[23:37] you say Amen that Christ has given us
[23:40] it's a part of Christ and we will go to
[23:42] that you talk about celebrating the
[23:43] Feast of Tabernacles we're awful close
[23:45] to a Rapture when we go into another
[23:48] body so you can see by this these things
[23:51] that he fulfills them all now when God
[23:53] speaks of a holy convocation it's not
[23:56] church as usual it's a personal
[23:58] connection with you amen that's right
[24:01] that's a holy
[24:02] convocation and uh in other words this
[24:06] convocation was more important than just
[24:08] the general meetings of his people they
[24:10] had more meaning to it a religious
[24:12] character in other words character was
[24:14] involved I would say that this way is
[24:16] that you can come and attend a
[24:18] congregation and be around the social
[24:20] part of it and develop friendships or
[24:22] not develop friendships whatever you
[24:24] want to do you can enjoy the benefits of
[24:26] all that that's wonderful but I can tell
[24:28] you God wants to have a holy convocation
[24:30] with you
[24:32] personally and if that doesn't happen
[24:34] all the congregational Gatherings will
[24:36] do you no good right amen so when he
[24:39] speaks of this it's more important than
[24:41] just a general meeting it's more
[24:42] important that you just make it to all
[24:44] the camps for the summer you should go
[24:46] to camps Jesus attended there's a
[24:48] scripture that says that as his custom
[24:50] one was he went in the synagogue he
[24:53] attended these things but it wasn't just
[24:55] attending a ritual to him it wasn't just
[24:57] a synagogue to him the word was becoming
[25:00] alive he was the word and it was being
[25:02] manifested in his life it doesn't matter
[25:04] that you make it to all the camps this
[25:05] summer if you're going to go go because
[25:08] Jesus went but you ought to be saying
[25:09] Lord let that camp be a holy convocation
[25:12] for my life praise the Lord they had
[25:15] more meaning to them a holy convocation
[25:18] and I want to say there's a regular
[25:19] meeting of people of God that has happen
[25:22] almost every week for centuries do you
[25:23] realize that they met on the first day
[25:25] of week the early Christians met on the
[25:26] first day to cele C Celebration Church
[25:29] on Sundays has been going on for
[25:31] centuries now there's a general meeting
[25:34] of the people of God but then but then
[25:37] there are
[25:38] significant movements or connections God
[25:42] makes with his people that are above the
[25:46] regular and so these were movements or
[25:48] connections God made with his people
[25:50] above the regular they are spoke of in
[25:52] the Bible these holy complications they
[25:54] are crucial that we catch them and
[25:56] gather around these things spirit St you
[25:58] can come to church and read your Bible
[26:00] your whole life and still not be
[26:02] connecting with Christ or what he is
[26:04] doing now so these were so important and
[26:07] they become even more important after
[26:10] Jesus comes because he comes to bring
[26:12] the spiritual fulfillment of every one
[26:14] of these feasts as I said Israel did
[26:16] them as a law and they acted out these
[26:19] gatherings every year even The Seven
[26:21] Feast become a ritual to them but he
[26:24] didn't intend for that to happen he said
[26:26] I want you to be sober about this I want
[26:27] you to come together and when you come
[26:29] three times a year to Jerusalem I want
[26:31] it to be a holy convocation I want you
[26:33] to know the meaning of what you're doing
[26:35] and I want I want to connect with
[26:38] you I don't want it to be church as
[26:40] usual so I'm bringing this back up what
[26:43] is the difference in a a graduation and
[26:45] a convocation then graduation is a term
[26:47] used to acknowledge that you have met
[26:49] your requirements and you have been
[26:51] approved to graduate from the program
[26:55] convocation refers to the ceremony it's
[26:57] a different ceremony refers to the
[27:00] ceremony where your credential will be
[27:05] conferred and confirm means you are
[27:08] granted or you're bestowed a title a
[27:11] degree a benefit or a
[27:15] right now I'm going to
[27:18] preach because you can go to graduations
[27:20] all day long and if you don't have you
[27:23] haven't been conferred the rights of
[27:26] what that degree has given you you ain't
[27:29] got everything yet this holy convocation
[27:32] is something deeper than a graduation
[27:34] it's something deeper than just coming
[27:36] and celebrating can you say Amen but
[27:38] it's something that it says that grants
[27:40] you it's the convocation refers to the
[27:42] ceremony where the credential will be
[27:44] conferred to you the rights everything
[27:46] will come over to you so if you don't
[27:48] realize that the bride is the final
[27:50] voice to the final age and this Christ
[27:53] that you believe is not some form that's
[27:55] up in the air somewhere it's living in
[27:58] his people and if you don't believe
[28:00] that's the final voice of the final age
[28:02] you don't know your Bible amen cuz it's
[28:04] the spirit and the bride at the last
[28:08] that say come thank you for watching our
