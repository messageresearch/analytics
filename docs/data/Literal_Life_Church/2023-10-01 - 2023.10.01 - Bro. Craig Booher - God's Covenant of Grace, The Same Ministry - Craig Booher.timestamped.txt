[20:20] we were able to sing uh the family was
[20:23] able to sing at a Baptist Church in
[20:25] Lorraine and I can just tell you that
[20:27] the the presence of the Lord never
[20:29] before I have I seen when we go to a
[20:32] place like that the presence of the Lord
[20:33] come in and show himself
[20:35] so so real to those people just a small
[20:39] group and there was a few message
[20:41] Believers there but just a small group
[20:43] but I'll tell you the pastor really
[20:45] identified that he hadn't felt that
[20:48] presence that way for many many years so
[20:51] we thank the Lord CU God can bring his
[20:53] anointing through a song Through the
[20:55] word and a song Whatever It Is and uh
[20:58] I was just amazed and and then they just
[21:01] really enjoyed Sharon's testimony as
[21:03] well and uh at the end the pastor asked
[21:06] to pray for her and we all come up and
[21:09] the whole church gathered around her and
[21:11] I thought it was real special and uh
[21:13] that their faith Rose to that place we
[21:15] sang the song Same God he's the same God
[21:17] is living in me I tell you what a what a
[21:20] revelation you know to strike the
[21:22] people's hearts but the first words he
[21:24] said he said I'm going to ask for Sharon
[21:27] I'm going to ask for
[21:28] what God has already done and I thought
[21:30] that was good Revelation I'm going to
[21:33] ask for what God has already done
[21:35] powerful praise the Lord and let's just

[40:15] 15 and I'm going to it's a little
[40:18] lengthy so I just ask for your patience
[40:20] I want to I think I read 18 verses I
[40:23] want to start with verse one and I just
[40:26] didn't feel that it was that I could
[40:28] really cut anything out of it I wanted
[40:30] to just read the whole
[40:32] portion so uh Genesis chapter
[40:35] 15 and we
[40:38] will we will start with verse
[40:41] one everybody
[40:44] there after these things the word of the
[40:48] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[40:51] fear
[40:52] not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[40:56] exceeding great
[40:58] reward and Abram said Lord God what will
[41:02] thou give me saying I go childless and
[41:05] the steward of my house is this elaser
[41:09] of
[41:09] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[41:13] thou Hast given me no seed and lo one
[41:17] born in my house is my Heir and behold
[41:21] the word of the Lord came unto him
[41:23] saying this shall not be thy ear thy air
[41:27] but he that shall come forth out of
[41:30] thine own bows shall be thine air and he
[41:33] brought him forth abroad and said look
[41:35] now towards the heavens and tell the
[41:37] Stars if thou shall be able to number
[41:40] them and he said unto them so shall thy
[41:43] seed be and Abram said behold to me thou
[41:48] I'm sorry I'm sorry verse six sorry and
[41:52] he believed in the
[41:54] Lord and He count honored him for
[41:57] righteousness and he said I am the Lord
[42:00] that brought thee out of her Chi to give
[42:02] thee this land to inherit it and he said
[42:05] Lord God whereby shall I know that I
[42:08] shall inherit it and he said take me a
[42:12] heer of three years old and a she goat
[42:15] of three years old and a ram of three
[42:18] years and a turtle dove and a young
[42:21] pigeon and he took unto him all these
[42:25] and divided them in the midst and laid
[42:28] each piece one against the other but the
[42:32] birds divided he not and when the fowls
[42:36] came down upon the carcasses Abram drove
[42:39] them away and when the sun was going
[42:42] down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo
[42:46] a of great Darkness fell upon him
[42:49] and he said un to Abram knowest of
[42:52] assurity that thy seed shall be a
[42:54] stranger in a a land that is not theirs
[42:57] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[43:00] afflict them 400 years and also that
[43:03] Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[43:06] judge and afterward shall they come out
[43:08] with a great substance and thou shall go
[43:11] to thy fathers in peace and thou shall
[43:14] be buried in a good old age but in the
[43:17] fourth generation they shall come hither
[43:20] again and the iniquity of the amorites
[43:23] is not yet full and it came to pass when
[43:26] the sun went down it was dark and behold
[43:30] a smoking furnace and a burning lamp
[43:33] that passed between those pieces and in
[43:37] the same day the Lord made a covenant
[43:39] with Abram saying unto thy seed have I
[43:44] given thee this land from the river of
[43:46] Egypt unto the river the the river the
[43:50] Great River the river
[43:52] Euphrates we'll stop there and I would
[43:55] like to preach this morning on God's
[43:58] Covenant of Grace and I and I would just
[44:02] like to subtitle it the same
[44:05] Ministry if we could just go to the Lord
[44:08] in prayer together Heavenly
[44:10] Father Lord we thank you for your
[44:12] presence this
[44:14] morning Lord it warms our hearts it
[44:18] brings peace to our
[44:20] hearts in this confusion that we fight
[44:23] Lord we come in to the house of the Lord
[44:25] in our heart Hearts feel at
[44:27] rest Lord I ask dear God that the Holy
[44:30] Spirit Will begin to Quicken our ears to
[44:33] the hearing of Thy word our hearts Lord
[44:37] to the receiving of Thy word and we lord
[44:40] we ask God if anyone has seen this
[44:43] morning that it'll be
[44:45] you and I pray that you'll be glorified
[44:48] in your people for the glory of God we
[44:50] ask it
[44:52] amen you can have your seats thank you
[44:55] so much
[45:00] yes please just a moment just we'll get
[45:03] situated here just a
[45:06] second you can work on it matter of fact
[45:09] let's not do it I'll just just use the
[45:12] monitors praise the
[45:16] Lord Brother Ed bisc used to say
[45:18] there'll be no wires in
[45:22] heaven praise the Lord now I'm feeling
[45:24] comfortable I wonder
[45:26] preach this morning on the grace of God
[45:28] the subject of the grace of God the
[45:32] Bible said by grace are we saved how
[45:35] many believe that by grace are we saved
[45:38] through faith and not of
[45:41] yourselves it is the gift of God and
[45:45] brother Brenham said the subject of
[45:47] Grace it goes back is old as the world
[45:51] he said that that Grace really when it
[45:54] come to God was always the message it
[45:57] has always been God's way brother bam
[46:01] said I can't see nothing else but the
[46:03] grace of God he said that that's my
[46:06] whole makeup he said I always did
[46:08] believe in grace he said even my life
[46:12] when I was a boy I could see nothing but
[46:15] Grace he said now he said they say that
[46:19] you scratch my back and I'll scratch
[46:21] yours he said that is an awful
[46:23] expression he said I don't care whether
[46:26] you scratch mine or not if yours needs
[46:28] scratch and I'll scratch it anyhow he
[46:31] said that's Grace regardless if you
[46:34] never done nothing for me he said he
[46:37] said he said if you need it he said I'll
[46:41] do it he said Grace does it because you
[46:44] need it he said I needed saving and
[46:48] there was nothing that could save me
[46:50] there was nothing that I could do for
[46:53] myself I needed saving and he he said
[46:56] and I believed God how many can say Amen
[47:01] man has always tried to save himself man
[47:04] has always tried to reach for God but
[47:07] the only thing that can save us is the
[47:11] grace of almighty God how many believe
[47:14] that free unmar
[47:18] Grace
[47:19] Hallelujah when Adam and Eve had fallen
[47:22] in the beginning God had put him on a
[47:25] conditional
[47:26] if you eat from the Tree of knowledge uh
[47:29] you you'll die if you eat from the Tree
[47:31] of Life you will live and brother benam
[47:34] said but man will always break his end
[47:37] man cannot keep his
[47:39] end Hallelujah that's why that's why it
[47:43] takes the grace of God but brother bham
[47:45] said as soon as they fa he said they
[47:48] come under the death penalty they begin
[47:50] to move out of the presence of God and
[47:53] the Lord said the seed of the woman will
[47:56] bruise the head of the serpent and when
[47:58] he said it that was
[48:00] unconditional everything that God does
[48:04] will it'll be in the unconditional
[48:06] Covenant Grace will bring us healing
[48:09] Grace will bring us salvation but Grace
[48:12] will make a way when there is no
[48:16] way how many believe that it's Grace
[48:20] that does it for you it's Grace that
[48:22] brings you to
[48:24] God it's God's Grace that you're sitting
[48:26] here this
[48:27] morning it's Grace that'll do the work
[48:30] in your life there's none of us that
[48:33] have ability there's none of us that
[48:34] have be able to find our way out
[48:39] Hallelujah brother brandom said when God
[48:41] began with
[48:42] Abraham he said the first thing that he
[48:45] did was he called Abraham as 75 years
[48:48] old he said it was the grace of God that
[48:50] called him he said he was a root
[48:53] worshipper there was nothing special
[48:55] about Abraham and God just called a
[48:59] normal man like he called you and I just
[49:02] normal run-of-the-mill people and he
[49:04] said the first thing that he done was
[49:07] put him in in an unconditional Covenant
[49:11] he said because every time man touches
[49:14] the condition he fails on his end he
[49:17] said but God was determined to save man
[49:21] and I want to bring it personal God is
[49:23] determined to save us the morning God is
[49:27] determined to save our young people and
[49:30] to heal those that are sick God is
[49:32] determined to send the Holy Ghost
[49:36] Revival it is nothing about us it's all
[49:40] about the grace of
[49:42] God
[49:44] hallelujah and he told him he said I
[49:47] have made you a father of
[49:49] Nations I am making something out of you
[49:53] Abraham out of you will come forth My
[49:56] Chosen Nation
[49:58] Hallelujah he told him he he said look
[50:01] at the stars he said can you number them
[50:04] Abraham said no he said look at the dust
[50:07] can you number he said no he said so
[50:09] will your seed be but he was going to do
[50:12] to the seed what he did to Abraham from
[50:16] the dust I'm going to lift you into the
[50:20] Stars God takes men that are nothing
[50:23] women that are useless and the grace of
[50:26] God visits them turns the course of
[50:29] their life and makes them
[50:33] useful
[50:36] Hallelujah brother brandham said that
[50:39] the unconditional Covenant in Abraham's
[50:41] life was the act of God that's right it
[50:46] was all about God the story the focus is
[50:50] all about God God hallelujah hallelujah
[50:55] amen it's absolute Grace yes you believe
[51:01] that and brother Brom said Abraham had
[51:04] his ups and
[51:06] downs Abraham had his blunders but the
[51:09] grace of God held
[51:11] Abraham and the devil is going to oppose
[51:14] it brother bam said the reason God gives
[51:17] a Grace Covenant is the adversary is too
[51:20] great for
[51:21] us that's what he said but the grace of
[51:24] God is a
[51:26] enough his grace is
[51:29] sufficient how many believe that God is
[51:32] steering the ship God is controlling
[51:35] your trials God is here this morning he
[51:39] knows every life he knows every burden
[51:42] he knows every every prayer
[51:45] request so Abraham backslides blunder
[51:49] and the Bible records it for
[51:52] us just makes a a blunder God don't
[51:55] leave this country Abraham storms right
[51:58] out of the
[51:59] country then uh then the king said look
[52:02] at that woman that is the woman that
[52:05] I've wanted all my life he said is that
[52:08] your wife he said that's my sister he
[52:10] said perfect I'll take
[52:13] her she looks over at Abraham said I am
[52:16] going to kill you I said
[52:20] sh he said you get a RIT boys we'll have
[52:23] a wedding tomorrow and brother Venom
[52:26] said he had his got a shower and got a
[52:28] shower cap on and amick stuck his feet
[52:31] up on the end of the bed wiggling his
[52:32] toes and said think about it the woman
[52:35] of my dreams tomorrow I'm going to have
[52:38] that man's
[52:42] sister God came to him in a
[52:45] dream why didn't God come to Abraham and
[52:49] said you know what you really messed up
[52:53] God
[52:54] didn't God brother bham said that amick
[52:57] was like a Holiness
[52:58] preacher and he said he came to amick
[53:01] and said you're as good as a dead
[53:03] man and he said what did I do he said
[53:06] you got a man's wife he goes he told me
[53:09] it was his sister he goes well it is his
[53:13] wife and that is my
[53:17] Prophet see God in his grace had claimed
[53:20] Abraham as a piece of his property
[53:24] Hallelujah
[53:25] and God has claimed his church as his
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:31] property now he took a fight up with God
[53:35] and God said if you don't turn her loose
[53:39] I'll wipe out your entire
[53:41] nation and furthermore my lion Prophet
[53:45] is going to pray for your sinful
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:49] Soul Brother Bram said Amazing
[53:54] Grace
[53:56] Hallelujah he said why how did God do it
[53:59] he said because she was a part of
[54:02] Abraham and out of her would come the
[54:04] lineage of the Messiah and God was
[54:08] protecting the
[54:10] bloodstream it was the grace of God that
[54:13] did
[54:14] [Applause]
[54:16] it
[54:18] Hallelujah God
[54:22] hallelujah and then it come time to
[54:24] deliver
[54:25] after holding in faith it was time for
[54:28] God to deliver and the angel says Sarah
[54:32] will have a son a year from now and she
[54:36] laughed and brother brandham said that
[54:38] God had a right to strike her
[54:41] dead but he could
[54:45] not because God had bound
[54:49] himself by his own unconditional promise
[54:54] in to Abraham and she was a part of
[54:58] Abraham and he could not slay her
[55:02] because through her would come the
[55:04] promise and brother benam said God would
[55:07] have struck every one of us in this room
[55:10] dead but he
[55:12] cannot because we are a part of
[55:16] him we are a part of his
[55:24] word
[55:25] amen so the grace of God overrode
[55:30] it how many appreciate the
[55:33] Lord Abraham made mistakes Sarah made
[55:37] mistakes you will make mistakes we have
[55:40] all made mistakes but the grace of God
[55:43] will
[55:45] deliver because we're a part of his
[55:48] word
[55:50] hallelujah not because Abraham was good
[55:53] but because God is is
[55:58] good
[56:00] hallelujah look at the book of Exodus we
[56:03] find that the Bible said that the people
[56:06] were groaning under the under the whip
[56:08] of the
[56:09] Taskmaster they were discouraged and the
[56:12] Bible said their ear their their groans
[56:15] came into the ears of God and the Bible
[56:17] said God
[56:20] remembered God remembered his Covenant
[56:24] he remembered the promise that he gave
[56:27] Abraham we just read it in our opening
[56:30] scripture now Moses was born the proper
[56:33] child they knew he was to deliver but he
[56:36] tuck tailed and run brother bham said he
[56:39] found a beautiful Ethiopian girl and he
[56:42] was going to be an heir of a good flock
[56:46] he said he was retired I mean things
[56:48] were going good outside of maybe a a
[56:51] high hot-tempered wife but other than
[56:53] that things were going good
[56:56] good now you would think that God would
[56:59] say you know you you're no good for
[57:01] nothing Moses you failed me you run
[57:04] you're not worthy to do what I want you
[57:06] to do but the Bible said God remembered
[57:09] his
[57:11] promise God remembers his Covenant God
[57:15] remembers his people God remembered
[57:19] Moses so in order to bring forth the
[57:23] Deliverance he first had to fix
[57:27] Moses and his grace brother his grace
[57:32] will do the
[57:33] fixing how many believe that so Moses
[57:37] going down a familiar Trail comes into
[57:39] the presence of the pillar of fire and
[57:42] the Lord said I am the god of Abraham
[57:45] Isaac and Jacob and I remember my
[57:52] promise L amen
[57:55] sometimes you got to remind him yeah how
[57:58] many believe that yes sir God remembers
[58:01] every promise that he has
[58:03] madeen Hallelujah God when he ordains
[58:08] something it must come to pass and God
[58:11] has ordained a church in this day God
[58:15] has ordained a bride in this day God has
[58:19] ordained a body change in this day and
[58:23] that word must come to pass and it will
[58:26] not be any big eyes or little yous it'll
[58:29] be the grace of
[58:31] [Applause]
[58:32] God it is the grace of God that has
[58:35] brought you this
[58:36] far it is the grace of God that has
[58:39] taken you to the Valley of the shadow of
[58:41] death and taken you through your trials
[58:44] and your tribulations and your
[58:46] disappointment when you thought you
[58:48] could not go another day it is the grace
[58:51] of
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:53] God am hallelujah we're standing here
[58:57] not in our own none of us will have
[58:59] bragging rights at that
[59:01] day we'll all throw our crowns and say
[59:04] glory to the Lamb of
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:10] God
[59:12] hallelujah so our opening
[59:15] scripture Abraham now is is asking the
[59:19] Lord you promised me a seed yeah and
[59:22] I've got elizer he's a good boy boy I'll
[59:25] just adopt him and that'll be your
[59:27] promise I help you and the Lord said
[59:30] no this will not be your
[59:33] ear but one that will come out of
[59:37] you will be my air I want to manifest it
[59:42] through you and I don't want
[59:45] substitutes I don't want shortcuts I
[59:48] want to manifest my promise through and
[59:52] in you praise God
[59:57] he said but where is the seed
[1:00:00] Lord the Bible said in chapter 15:8 our
[1:00:04] opening scripture that same
[1:00:09] day yeah pull up if you will Verse
[1:00:14] 18 in that same
[1:00:17] day the Lord made a covenant with
[1:00:21] Abram saying unto thee have I given thee
[1:00:25] this land in the river of Egypt unto the
[1:00:28] Great River the river
[1:00:30] Euphrates brother renom and he speaks
[1:00:33] about it a lot he gives an
[1:00:36] interesting description
[1:00:38] here because now God is making a
[1:00:41] covenant with
[1:00:43] Abraham and brother Benham said back in
[1:00:46] this day and I can I'm not going to take
[1:00:47] the time but I can show you by scripture
[1:00:50] that they that this is true they would
[1:00:52] they would divide a sacri sacrifice in
[1:00:55] half they would take its hide and they
[1:00:57] would write a covenant and then they
[1:00:59] would split it right down the middle and
[1:01:02] and and those two pieces of the contract
[1:01:06] would go to the one and to the other and
[1:01:08] the agreement was made and then they
[1:01:11] would write their Covenant on it now
[1:01:14] brother bham said that they would tear
[1:01:17] the animal or the sacrifice apart
[1:01:21] Hallelujah and brother bam said now this
[1:01:24] this is what God was doing to Abraham he
[1:01:28] said Abraham kills the sacrifices as God
[1:01:32] had told him you know kill the
[1:01:34] sacrifices and the doves split them and
[1:01:36] so forth not the doves but he said split
[1:01:39] them in half representing the old and
[1:01:42] the New Testament and the dove was not
[1:01:44] to be divided and then the agreement was
[1:01:48] under the shed
[1:01:50] blood meaning the Covenant was under the
[1:01:53] death of an innocent sacrificial victim
[1:01:58] and then then the two parties once again
[1:02:00] would keep each part of the hide or the
[1:02:04] leather the Covenant and then in this
[1:02:08] scene the Bible said a deep sleep fell
[1:02:12] upon Abraham he he was keeping all the
[1:02:15] birds in the evening time he was keeping
[1:02:18] the birds off the sacrifices brother ROM
[1:02:21] said that's like Spirits we're casting
[1:02:24] them away from the word of
[1:02:27] God and as the sun was going down a deep
[1:02:31] sleep fell upon Abraham and God this is
[1:02:37] unconditional he is saying Abraham not
[1:02:40] if but I am going to do this for
[1:02:44] you I want you to catch this so God is
[1:02:47] very specific and then the Bible tells
[1:02:51] us as he went to sleep brother Bron said
[1:02:54] what is he showing he's saying brother
[1:02:57] you have nothing to do with this Abraham
[1:03:00] has nothing to do with this we are
[1:03:02] resting on the unconditional
[1:03:07] Covenant and then he said darkness and
[1:03:10] Blackness fell Darkness he said and a
[1:03:14] smoking furnace he said what was that
[1:03:17] the darkness is death that every one of
[1:03:19] us are going to face he said the smoking
[1:03:22] furnace represented hell and then a
[1:03:26] sacred light passed between those two
[1:03:32] sacrifices brother Brenham said the
[1:03:35] light was the pillar of fire the same
[1:03:39] one that let Israel the same one that
[1:03:42] met Paul the same one that is here
[1:03:47] now he said the pillar of fire was
[1:03:50] signing the
[1:03:53] contract
[1:03:57] and this
[1:03:58] covenant could never be
[1:04:02] duplicated the only way we would know
[1:04:05] that it was the true Covenant is both
[1:04:08] pieces have to
[1:04:11] dovetail and come back together
[1:04:14] perfectly again this would be the
[1:04:18] agreement this would be the Covenant
[1:04:21] Hallelujah God is speaking to Abraham
[1:04:25] and his
[1:04:26] seed now a good way to describe it is
[1:04:29] brother Brenham used the the Chinese
[1:04:31] Laundry ticket and he said back then the
[1:04:34] China men they came to the US they might
[1:04:36] have had a language barrier and they
[1:04:38] would have the cards they would write
[1:04:40] something and rip it in a certain way
[1:04:43] and give you the other side now the only
[1:04:46] way you can redeem your dirty clothes
[1:04:50] which are made clean is to come and give
[1:04:53] that that other side of the
[1:04:56] Covenant now the only way you it could
[1:04:59] not be duplicated it was ripped in a
[1:05:01] certain way written in a certain way and
[1:05:04] then when you came back you were sure to
[1:05:07] redeem what was yours
[1:05:11] right all right
[1:05:14] Hallelujah brother Brandon I want you to
[1:05:16] catch this brother Bram said he was
[1:05:18] speaking to Abraham's seed and when
[1:05:22] Jesus came on the seat
[1:05:24] his ministry was the matching
[1:05:29] piece he said every prophecy his life
[1:05:34] dovetailed every Prophet whether it be
[1:05:37] David or Moses or or or All Through the
[1:05:39] Bible his life his ministry it match the
[1:05:47] Bible and brother Brenham said at
[1:05:49] Calvary God was writing the Everlasting
[1:05:52] Covenant we he took Jesus up between
[1:05:55] Heaven and Earth and he ripped him apart
[1:05:59] at Calvary and his body was raised up on
[1:06:02] the right hand of God and God ripped out
[1:06:05] his soul and poured out his Spirit upon
[1:06:09] the
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:12] church and now the church in order to go
[1:06:16] in the resurrection must have the same
[1:06:19] spirit that was in
[1:06:23] Christ the Covenant is the baptism of
[1:06:26] the Holy Ghost your pastor has been
[1:06:28] preaching on it the same life and the
[1:06:31] same power and we are all called by the
[1:06:35] grace of
[1:06:41] godall Hallelujah there can be no
[1:06:43] impersonator of
[1:06:45] it Jesus died in the evening time the
[1:06:49] Covenant was written and the Bible said
[1:06:53] I will write my Covenant upon their
[1:06:56] hearts how many believe
[1:06:59] that and brother random said this he
[1:07:02] said now we are the bride of
[1:07:06] Christ and he said the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:08] will have to have the same
[1:07:11] spirit that the other part of the
[1:07:14] contract had it's got to have the same
[1:07:17] life it's got to have the same works you
[1:07:21] know what that means you must possess
[1:07:25] the other side of the
[1:07:27] contract you must possess it in your
[1:07:32] soul and you say I hold a part of that
[1:07:37] contract how many believe that how many
[1:07:40] are holding that I want to I want to
[1:07:43] just take a side J just a moment in the
[1:07:46] end time
[1:07:47] ministry and I and I'm not calling names
[1:07:50] to be mean I'll just use Billy Graham
[1:07:52] and Billy Graham I have a great respect
[1:07:54] for there was no scandal in his life he
[1:07:56] he lived clean I I respect Billy Graham
[1:08:00] and there's others that have no Scandal
[1:08:02] good men they achieved a lot won many
[1:08:05] souls and done good for the kingdom but
[1:08:08] what modern Ministry can dovea with the
[1:08:12] Bible what modern Ministry have you
[1:08:15] found in this age that could actually
[1:08:19] dovetail with Jesus ministry The Works
[1:08:22] that I do you shall do
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:27] also and I could go through and I don't
[1:08:29] want to call names to be mean and so
[1:08:31] forth but there's 30 there's
[1:08:34] 45,000 denominations I pray tell which
[1:08:38] one shows the other side of the
[1:08:42] Covenant now I want you to take and
[1:08:45] examine brother bram's Ministry his
[1:08:48] healings his miracles his discernment
[1:08:53] his prophecy y his accuracy his power
[1:08:57] his scriptural teachings his character
[1:09:01] the
[1:09:01] supernal the controlling of nature I
[1:09:04] want you to look at it and do you see
[1:09:07] the ministry of Jesus
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:12] Christ what Ministry and history matches
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:18] Bible
[1:09:21] Hallelujah everything the angel told
[1:09:24] Brother Brenham duct tailed perfectly
[1:09:27] with the
[1:09:29] scriptures I want you to think about it
[1:09:32] now brother bandham teaches by
[1:09:35] nature and nature runs fluid with the
[1:09:39] word he teaches it by history he teaches
[1:09:43] it by
[1:09:44] mathematics he teaches it by the
[1:09:47] Zodiac he teaches it in d tales by the
[1:09:50] seals and by the church ages and by the
[1:09:54] Supernatural in every detail it's Dov
[1:09:58] tailing showing God in threes and fives
[1:10:00] and and all of those things I'm trying
[1:10:03] to express that this message has
[1:10:07] matched has matched the Covenant
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:14] Abraham dovetail is a word that is used
[1:10:17] in I don't know if there's any
[1:10:19] Woodworkers or Furniture workers in here
[1:10:21] but they use that term Dov tapil
[1:10:24] and making cabinets and so forth It's a
[1:10:28] joint that holds real strong right and
[1:10:32] it's a Craftsman or a carpenter's term
[1:10:35] Jesus would have used those terms and
[1:10:38] that dovetail means to join together how
[1:10:43] many want to be joined together God is
[1:10:46] looking for a church that it Dove tails
[1:10:49] with him that is joined together with
[1:10:52] him it is the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:10:56] we see God in the zodiac god in history
[1:11:00] God in the Bible we see God in the
[1:11:05] pyramids brother Ram said every one of
[1:11:08] those stones dovetailed so perfectly he
[1:11:12] said that they were earthquake
[1:11:15] proof the pyramid and The Headstone must
[1:11:19] come together and in order for it to
[1:11:21] come together it has to D tail to the
[1:11:24] top so the coming of the Lord has a
[1:11:27] place to
[1:11:29] set
[1:11:31] Hallelujah line upon line right it's
[1:11:35] what the pastor was preaching Wednesday
[1:11:36] line upon line precept upon
[1:11:40] precept amen how many appreciate word
[1:11:44] upon word life upon life Lord let my
[1:11:47] life tie with that
[1:11:52] scripture
[1:11:54] and now a church with only Doctrine and
[1:11:57] no life power and spirit is
[1:12:02] not the other side of the
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:08] contract all scripture sets
[1:12:11] together brother Brandon would take
[1:12:13] every type and Shadow of the Bible and
[1:12:15] weave it with every major Doctrine in
[1:12:18] every
[1:12:19] truth how how is that possible a man
[1:12:21] with a seventh grade education
[1:12:24] and you could tell by his preaching he
[1:12:26] had a seventh grade education and I
[1:12:28] don't mean that negative God is showing
[1:12:30] it's the grace of God that's bringing
[1:12:32] this to
[1:12:34] you it is it is not connected to a man
[1:12:38] though it's manifested in
[1:12:42] man God give us discernment to hear what
[1:12:45] the spirit is
[1:12:47] saying brother bom said the messages of
[1:12:50] those seven angels is Dov tailing with
[1:12:53] the word even the prophecies are duv
[1:12:56] tailing he said the Vision Plus the word
[1:12:59] plus history plus the church ages
[1:13:02] they're all Blended together it's thus
[1:13:05] sayith the
[1:13:09] Lord he said the opening of those seals
[1:13:11] there is no
[1:13:14] contradictions the 70 weeks tied
[1:13:16] perfectly with the ages the church ages
[1:13:19] tied and Blended perfectly with the
[1:13:21] seals marriage and divorce Blended
[1:13:23] perfectly with serpent seed and God is
[1:13:26] revealing
[1:13:28] himself in the
[1:13:30] Bible God is reveal it's God in his word
[1:13:34] God in his Universe God in his son God
[1:13:38] in his
[1:13:40] people
[1:13:42] hallelujah so brother renom said we have
[1:13:45] proved it by the word and by history and
[1:13:48] by signs and by Supernatural amen now I
[1:13:52] want to express where I really think the
[1:13:54] rubber meets the road when Jesus was
[1:13:58] baptized the spirit of God like
[1:14:02] a descended upon the lamb brother bam
[1:14:08] said the dove could not fall upon a wolf
[1:14:11] the L the lamb the dove had to fall upon
[1:14:14] a nature like
[1:14:18] itsself nature of Heaven and Earth must
[1:14:22] blend
[1:14:23] amen so not only in Doctrine not only in
[1:14:28] history not only in the Supernatural but
[1:14:31] in
[1:14:35] characterall the two Natures must become
[1:14:39] one the alpha and the
[1:14:45] Omega can I go a little
[1:14:47] further on
[1:14:49] August 25th 1960 brother brandom is
[1:14:52] going squirrel huntting bear with me I'm
[1:14:55] going somewhere just you do you're a
[1:14:56] great great you're really paying
[1:14:58] attention we appreciate the
[1:15:01] Lord Brother brandom is going squirrel
[1:15:04] hunting and he goes into a familiar
[1:15:07] Place furthermore it's where he had the
[1:15:10] experience with the squirrels right and
[1:15:13] he said I see three rainbows coming up
[1:15:16] out of the Hill he said they were
[1:15:19] running some 30 foot in the air he he
[1:15:23] said whatever it was it was alive he was
[1:15:26] pulsating with life and he said he tried
[1:15:30] to get close but the spirit warned him
[1:15:32] and said that's far enough and he said
[1:15:35] the three rainbows was going into a bull
[1:15:39] like Affair and he screamed Lord what
[1:15:42] would you have your servant know and the
[1:15:45] response of the spirit was Jesus of the
[1:15:48] New Testament is Jehovah of the old he
[1:15:52] was only changing his
[1:15:56] mask brother ROM said of course he was
[1:15:59] confirming the message that I have
[1:16:02] preached God was confirming the message
[1:16:07] he said and we are saved by grace not of
[1:16:11] works it is Grace that saves you he said
[1:16:14] I thought of the grace of God that would
[1:16:17] take a poor Wretch like myself and give
[1:16:20] him an opportunity to preach the gospel
[1:16:23] to bring healing to people that homes
[1:16:26] that are broke up will be straightened
[1:16:28] up again he said he gave me the grace
[1:16:31] it's amazing grace and God formed
[1:16:35] himself in the form of a
[1:16:38] rainbow which
[1:16:40] means
[1:16:43] Covenant meaning God will be behind
[1:16:51] it like he was AB
[1:16:54] abah you Lord I think it's amazing just
[1:16:57] to take a side J when we talk about
[1:17:01] Matthew 28 the baptism of the Father Son
[1:17:03] and Holy Ghost to me this is incredible
[1:17:06] brother BR said oh no that is not three
[1:17:07] persons it's three
[1:17:10] dispensations the fatherhood God above
[1:17:13] us the son God With Us now the Holy
[1:17:15] Ghost God in
[1:17:17] us he said those three are not persons
[1:17:20] their dispensations that God came from
[1:17:24] Heaven to man into the
[1:17:29] church
[1:17:32] Hallelujah and when God said I will
[1:17:36] restore sayith the Lord this is an
[1:17:40] unconditional Grace
[1:17:47] Covenant it came from a sovereign
[1:17:51] God and brother brandham said Sovereign
[1:17:54] Grace comes from a sovereign
[1:17:57] one and Sovereign means supreme or
[1:18:01] highest in power Superior to all
[1:18:06] others I want you to think about
[1:18:08] independent of and unlimited by any
[1:18:13] other yeah that's right so brother BR
[1:18:17] makes a statement Sovereign Grace must
[1:18:20] come from a sovereign one amen
[1:18:23] yes and I want you to think about this a
[1:18:26] minute as the scripture gives us a
[1:18:29] definition how many believe in the grace
[1:18:31] of God now here was David a man after
[1:18:34] God's Own Heart here is a man that was
[1:18:37] used of God but somehow he got ens
[1:18:40] snared and he falls with beath Sheba
[1:18:43] brother brandham said both of them had a
[1:18:45] part in it but he you know the story he
[1:18:48] took bash Sheba got her pregnant
[1:18:50] realized he was in trouble took the life
[1:18:52] of your IAH a very faithful Warrior and
[1:18:55] a faithful man and then all of a sudden
[1:18:58] Nathan appears after David thinks that
[1:19:01] he escaped the whole situation and he
[1:19:03] tells him a parable of a lamb and how a
[1:19:06] man loved that lamb like his own
[1:19:08] daughter and this Rich ungodly neighbor
[1:19:11] killed that man's lamb and fed it to his
[1:19:14] guest and David that he hit the nerve
[1:19:17] and David by his own judgment said that
[1:19:20] man will
[1:19:21] die and Ean said you are the
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:26] man and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[1:19:29] Spotlight went on David and David saw
[1:19:31] his sin
[1:19:33] openly yeah and David said I have sinned
[1:19:37] and he said and God has put away your
[1:19:41] iniquity according to the scriptures he
[1:19:43] should have died that's the word of God
[1:19:46] how did he get a pardon when the
[1:19:48] immutable word of God said death it came
[1:19:52] came from a sovereign God that can do
[1:19:55] what he wants to it came was Sovereign
[1:19:59] Grace that came on the scene for David
[1:20:02] we need the grace of God we need
[1:20:05] Sovereign Grace in our lives
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:11] hallelujah and brother random said this
[1:20:14] story of a man that was sentenced to die
[1:20:17] and the the king came up and said drink
[1:20:19] the water he said he said here's a drink
[1:20:22] the water and he said and because
[1:20:25] afterwards you're going to die and the
[1:20:27] man was shaking like this and he
[1:20:29] couldn't drink it he said come on you're
[1:20:30] not going to die until you drink it the
[1:20:32] man looked he caught it he threw the
[1:20:35] water
[1:20:39] out and that don't make sense unless you
[1:20:43] look at it to the eyes of a sovereign
[1:20:46] one who will stand by his
[1:20:50] word and the King being sovereign
[1:20:54] spoke a word he was willing to stand
[1:20:57] by and because he stood by it it freed
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:02] man and I want you to think of this and
[1:21:05] brother brandham gave that as an example
[1:21:07] when God makes a covenant he stands
[1:21:11] behind that
[1:21:13] Covenant everybody with me God cannot go
[1:21:17] back on his word God will not renig on
[1:21:20] his word God spoke it God will perform
[1:21:23] it you can depend upon it you can live
[1:21:26] by it you can stand by
[1:21:30] it God stands with it thank you Father
[1:21:36] hallelujah
[1:21:40] hallelujah brother Brenham said Jesus
[1:21:43] Christ is the
[1:21:44] Covenant he tore him apart at
[1:21:48] Calvary received his body up and sent
[1:21:51] back the Holy Spirit
[1:21:53] and when the Resurrection comes the same
[1:21:57] spirit that was in Jesus is the only
[1:21:59] thing that'll raise your body up to meet
[1:22:02] that one there that makes husband and
[1:22:05] wife the bride is the Covenant people
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:10] unconditionally God called you out of
[1:22:13] the world God gave you the Holy
[1:22:17] Ghost the Seed of Abraham tonight he
[1:22:20] said with the Blessed promise you
[1:22:22] believe God regardless of what takes
[1:22:26] place cuz there is a bride and there is
[1:22:29] a
[1:22:30] groom that was in brother Joe's
[1:22:33] song and the same spirit that was on
[1:22:37] Christ must be on you in order to be in
[1:22:40] the Covenant this is why the pastor
[1:22:43] preaches on the Holy Ghost Christ in you
[1:22:45] is the hope of glory the love that was
[1:22:48] in him is in you Hallelujah you are the
[1:22:52] the Covenant people and it is no ifs
[1:22:55] ands or buts it's an unconditional
[1:22:59] Covenant look what it did for Abraham
[1:23:02] look what it done for Israel all Israel

[1:23:25] shake God open our hearts open our eyes
[1:23:29] that we might see who we are by your
[1:23:32] grace not by our Doctrine not by our
[1:23:35] church size but by your grace you have
[1:23:38] made
[1:23:40] us it is an unconditional promise we are
[1:23:44] the Covenant people not by works we must
[1:23:48] claim our god-given rights the Holy

[1:25:09] Hallelujah this same
[1:25:12] Jesus that you saw go will come back in
[1:25:15] like
[1:25:16] manner how many believe
[1:25:19] that I go just a little further am
[1:25:23] amen it's
[1:25:26] amazing in Noah's
[1:25:28] day the Bible tells us that God made a
[1:25:32] covenant the days of
[1:25:34] Noah but the Covenant wasn't so much
[1:25:37] with
[1:25:38] Noah as the Covenant was to
[1:25:43] himself you find it in the scriptures in
[1:25:45] Genesis 9 verse
[1:25:48] 13 he says I do set my bow in the clouds
[1:25:53] and it shall be for a
[1:25:56] token between
[1:25:58] me and the Earth brother brandom said
[1:26:01] now it wasn't between he and Noah it was
[1:26:04] between him and the Earth and he said
[1:26:06] now that Covenant brought Noah
[1:26:08] life he said but God is actually making
[1:26:11] a covenant with himself that's right
[1:26:16] Hallelujah and he said now if we look
[1:26:19] closely he puts a rainbow in the
[1:26:23] for a sign for a token of the
[1:26:26] Covenant and he said but I want you to
[1:26:29] go back and brother Brandon brings us
[1:26:30] out to Genesis 8:20 if you'll pull that
[1:26:34] up in Genesis 8:20 this is why God put a
[1:26:38] bow in the cloud it says and Noah built
[1:26:42] an altar unto the Lord and He took every
[1:26:45] clean beast and every clean foul and
[1:26:48] offered a burnt offering on the altar
[1:26:50] next verse
[1:26:52] and the Lord smelled a sweet Savor and
[1:26:57] the Lord said in his heart I will not
[1:27:00] again curse the ground anymore for man's
[1:27:02] sake for the imagination of the heart is
[1:27:05] evil from his youth neither will I again
[1:27:07] Smite anymore any living every any
[1:27:11] everything living as I have done pull up
[1:27:15] that next verse and while the Earth uh
[1:27:18] let's just stop there brother bam said
[1:27:21] now this is why why the rainbow was put
[1:27:24] in the cloud is chapter 8 Noah offers a
[1:27:29] sacrifice and God smelled it God
[1:27:33] received it and because he accepted the
[1:27:37] sacrifice God gave a covenant rainbow a
[1:27:41] promise because he accepted the
[1:27:45] sacrifice brother Benham said in the
[1:27:47] Book of Revelation John saw rainbow all
[1:27:51] the way around the throne he said it was
[1:27:54] because Christ Our sacrifice and our
[1:27:57] covenant has been accepted and God
[1:28:00] everywhere he looks he sees the
[1:28:04] promise
[1:28:06] hallelujah hallelujah he said on Earth
[1:28:09] he said it's only a half of bow he said
[1:28:11] but in eternity the half has never been
[1:28:14] told he said it went around the throne
[1:28:17] what does that mean it means god is a
[1:28:20] covenant keeping God yeah yes he is when
[1:28:24] you need healing you need to approach
[1:28:26] him and say Lord You Are The Covenant
[1:28:29] keeping
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:31] God hallelujah all
[1:28:35] right
[1:28:37] Hallelujah we know in the Old
[1:28:39] Testament the pillar of fire was the
[1:28:42] angel of the Lord how many know that it
[1:28:45] was Christ brother brandham calls him
[1:28:47] the angel of the Covenant and that angel
[1:28:51] took them into to the manifestation of
[1:28:53] the promise in Revelations chap 10 the
[1:28:57] mighty Angel comes down with a rainbow
[1:29:00] upon his head brother brandham said it
[1:29:02] could only be
[1:29:04] Christ and brother brandham said notice
[1:29:07] he then brother B said Revelations 10
[1:29:10] this is Christ he said the pillar of
[1:29:13] fire he said the angel the mighty Angel
[1:29:17] is the Angel of the Covenant right
[1:29:20] that's right
[1:29:23] true
[1:29:25] Hallelujah and there was a
[1:29:27] rainbow upon his head which represents
[1:29:31] the Covenant keeping
[1:29:34] God thank you Jesus delivering us the
[1:29:37] Seed of Abraham a
[1:29:42] message how many remember 1962 just
[1:29:45] before the breaking of the seals brother
[1:29:46] Brenham speaks of five stars lining up
[1:29:49] in the heavens right and stay with me
[1:29:52] I'm I'm going to get back to my topic
[1:29:54] but I I feel a need to pour this in
[1:29:58] brother Brenham says this in
[1:30:00] 1962 he said five stars have lined up
[1:30:03] and he said I believe it has spiritual
[1:30:05] significance I think there's three four
[1:30:07] possibly five but I think four maybe
[1:30:09] four quotes on it and brother brandom
[1:30:12] said now in the first coming of the Lord
[1:30:16] he said three stars lined up which
[1:30:19] declared the infant Messiah upon the
[1:30:24] Earth and brother Brandon and I read it
[1:30:27] to you just I don't want to pull it out
[1:30:28] I don't want to say it wrong in any way
[1:30:31] brother random said the five stars that
[1:30:33] just fell in line with the world it's
[1:30:35] the number of
[1:30:37] Grace every time those stars come
[1:30:40] something happens upon the Earth and he
[1:30:43] said five stars I'm skipping down he
[1:30:46] said what's happened an infant Church a
[1:30:50] bride INF
[1:30:52] the power of God has begun to fall upon
[1:30:56] her and she is taking
[1:30:59] form a bride for a
[1:31:03] bridegroom the Church of the Living God
[1:31:06] is coming together under the word and
[1:31:09] the heaven is announcing her approach
[1:31:12] what is happening the church is coming
[1:31:17] forth God is going to have a church
[1:31:21] without spot wrinkle or
[1:31:26] blemish he said I believe the latterday
[1:31:29] signs and the things that are happening
[1:31:31] are peeling together to show Christ is
[1:31:33] ready to come for his bride his word is
[1:31:37] coming again making himself a
[1:31:40] manifested bride making for
[1:31:44] himself meaning that it will not stay
[1:31:48] Doctrine but God wants to live the
[1:31:51] Manifest ested word in school children
[1:31:55] in mothers in the kitchen in the church
[1:31:58] in the Sunday School room on Sunday on
[1:32:01] Wednesday in prayer meeting in Bible
[1:32:04] study God wants to manifest
[1:32:08] himself and he said it started right at
[1:32:11] the opening of those
[1:32:14] seals now brother brandom said now he
[1:32:17] said I've been to the pyramids in Egypt
[1:32:20] those stones are laid so perf perfectly
[1:32:22] together you can't take a razor blade
[1:32:24] hardly and go between them he said they
[1:32:26] fit
[1:32:27] perfectly and he said that's how they
[1:32:29] built the Sphinx and so forth he said
[1:32:31] now The Headstone is supposed to fit
[1:32:34] it's
[1:32:36] honed and if they ever could find The
[1:32:38] Headstone it'll fit just perfectly snug
[1:32:42] and bind the whole thing
[1:32:44] together that's the
[1:32:46] Bride of Jesus
[1:32:49] Christ when The Headstone come comes
[1:32:53] there will be a church to receive
[1:32:56] it a
[1:32:58] Ministry exactly like
[1:33:01] his brother R said when Jesus returns he
[1:33:05] will find a church washed without spot
[1:33:07] and wrinkle it will be the same
[1:33:15] Ministry I want you to think about this
[1:33:17] brother brandom in my opening statement
[1:33:19] Grace I won't hold you long every love
[1:33:21] the Lord Grace is as old as the
[1:33:26] world brother brandham said God gave
[1:33:29] Israel law but that was the people that
[1:33:32] was not God it was Grace that made the
[1:33:35] promise it was
[1:33:37] Grace that sent them a prophet it was
[1:33:41] Grace that sent the angel of the
[1:33:43] Covenant it was the grace of God that
[1:33:45] provided a lamb it was the power and the
[1:33:48] grace of God that led the children of
[1:33:50] Israel out of of Egypt everything was
[1:33:54] the grace of
[1:33:57] God how many believe
[1:34:00] that I want to read this quote before I
[1:34:02] change my
[1:34:04] direction here in communion 1962 brother
[1:34:07] bam speaks of it again he said I
[1:34:09] predict that this has a spiritual
[1:34:11] application speaking of the five stars
[1:34:13] he said I believe there's coming in the
[1:34:16] issue of God the great revelation of the
[1:34:19] word that is opened in this time
[1:34:21] remember they claim when those three
[1:34:23] stars came into orbit Jesus was born
[1:34:25] this is five this is the number of
[1:34:29] Grace and then he goes through Jes us
[1:34:32] and F AI the number of great he said now
[1:34:35] God if he ever sends his power to the
[1:34:37] church it'll be the grace of God he said
[1:34:41] Not The Obedience of the
[1:34:48] people and I want to say this
[1:34:52] because the devil will try to so corrupt
[1:34:55] Grace that you don't even want to preach
[1:34:57] it because you don't want the people to
[1:34:58] think that we just say there's no
[1:34:59] standards the word don't matter nothing
[1:35:01] matters go on Sarah sah God loves you
[1:35:04] yeah but if your faith is placed
[1:35:07] anywhere else but the grace of God
[1:35:09] you're in
[1:35:14] trouble it was the grace of God in
[1:35:17] Adam's life that's right it was the
[1:35:20] grace of God in Abra 's life it was the
[1:35:23] grace of God that bore with Israel for
[1:35:25] 40 years it was the grace of God to Saul
[1:35:30] the grace of God to Rahab the grace of
[1:35:33] God to Ruth the grace of God through the
[1:35:35] church ages and God constantly reaching
[1:35:39] constantly reaching it is the grace of
[1:35:42] God in your life brother the grace of
[1:35:44] God in your life sister it is the gift
[1:35:48] of
[1:35:50] God
[1:35:56] Amen brother Venom said if you have got
[1:35:58] the Holy Ghost and you're God's child
[1:36:01] you are Abraham's seed you have got the
[1:36:03] unconditional Covenant Written In Your
[1:36:06] Heart by the allmighty himself and he
[1:36:09] cannot take it
[1:36:11] back God's children unconditionally say
[1:36:16] unconditionally you don't deserve your
[1:36:19] healing tonight there's not one that
[1:36:21] deserves to hear the gospel there's not
[1:36:23] one here that deserves the grace of God
[1:36:26] we're all together it's God's grace that
[1:36:29] done it anyhow you don't deserve your
[1:36:32] healing everyone ought to die every one
[1:36:35] of us on this Earth we don't deserve to
[1:36:38] live he said but God promised it and God
[1:36:41] cannot lie healing belongs to us
[1:36:44] salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost
[1:36:47] belongs to us Heaven belongs to us
[1:36:51] and now we are the sons of God it's not
[1:36:55] what you are or what you will ever be
[1:36:58] but it's what he is it's not that you
[1:37:00] are good it's God that is
[1:37:04] good
[1:37:06] hallelujah our faith must Rest In The
[1:37:10] Sovereign Grace of
[1:37:12] God how many say yeah Lord it is your
[1:37:16] grace that I am here it is your grace in
[1:37:19] a finished work at C
[1:37:21] when he died for every man in this place
[1:37:24] when he poured his blood for our healing
[1:37:27] it was for you brother it was for you
[1:37:29] brother it was for this whole
[1:37:31] congregation it was for the preacher it
[1:37:33] is The Sovereign Grace of God to
[1:37:37] us and all you got to do is accept it by
[1:37:40] faith I believe it I accept it I'll
[1:37:44] receive that
[1:37:47] Lord how many receive
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:53] and the message of Grace 1961 if you get
[1:37:55] a chance to go back and listen to it
[1:37:57] you'll hear these things brother ROM
[1:37:59] said now according to prophecy there
[1:38:01] will come forth a
[1:38:03] headstone and I want you to
[1:38:06] notice when The Headstone comes the
[1:38:09] prince is going to cry out the message
[1:38:14] Grace
[1:38:16] Grace for it's the grace that we are
[1:38:20] saved the message of Grace has been
[1:38:23] Trampled Under the feet of men till it
[1:38:26] has become disgrace some run outs on
[1:38:29] eternal security some run into every but
[1:38:32] the true message of
[1:38:35] Grace
[1:38:37] Hallelujah there's where Satan tries to
[1:38:40] knock it from the
[1:38:41] church but it's the grace of God that we
[1:38:46] are saved
[1:38:48] by brother brandom said the deity of
[1:38:50] Jesus Jes Christ has come to confirm
[1:38:53] this Truth by his word he confirms it by
[1:38:55] signs and wonders he said then this
[1:38:58] Grace must be true
[1:39:01] too
[1:39:03] Hallelujah the coming of the Angel of
[1:39:05] the Covenant was to vindicate that
[1:39:07] salvation is for you and when the devil
[1:39:11] gets in your mind and tells you it is
[1:39:14] not for you you need to step up and say
[1:39:16] the grace of God says yes when he said
[1:39:20] you don't have Faith to be healed you
[1:39:22] can say but the grace of God says I can
[1:39:26] let the weak say they are
[1:39:29] strong Hallelujah I can do all things
[1:39:32] through Christ who strengthens me we can
[1:39:36] have a Revival we can have our loved
[1:39:38] ones we can have the power of God moving
[1:39:41] Among Us God can bring them
[1:39:45] back Grace is one of the Mysteries that
[1:39:48] was revealed under the opening of the
[1:39:50] seals now not disgrace but a true grace
[1:39:53] of God that'll give you Foundation under
[1:39:55] your feet it'll give you a place to
[1:39:58] stand when you do fall God is your
[1:40:00] defense God is your shelter get back up
[1:40:03] brother get back up Sister the grace of
[1:40:07] God is enough for
[1:40:09] you it's God's grace that holds
[1:40:13] us what do I do brother take his word
[1:40:16] into your heart and you hold on and
[1:40:19] don't you let the devil take it away
[1:40:21] from
[1:40:22] you Hallelujah brother renom said I
[1:40:25] believe in the grace of
[1:40:28] God I believe there's going to be a
[1:40:31] church in the last days without spot
[1:40:35] without wrinkle without blemish I
[1:40:39] believe that's eternally secure before
[1:40:42] God and there will be a church if you
[1:40:45] believe that say amen he said I don't
[1:40:48] know who will be in it I don't know I
[1:40:51] trust I will be I trust you will be I
[1:40:53] only live by faith but I believe there
[1:40:57] is a church on the
[1:40:59] way for those that are born
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] again the devil loves legalism
[1:41:07] especially among our
[1:41:09] ranks you see that men and women they
[1:41:12] begin to live by those Works brother
[1:41:14] random said that's the legalistic part
[1:41:16] of your
[1:41:17] walk he said that's why Ruth working was
[1:41:21] the legalistic part of her work she's
[1:41:23] working for her salvation and that's a
[1:41:25] part of the Bible every man working out
[1:41:27] his own salvation with fear and
[1:41:29] trembling but what happens if we stay
[1:41:33] there we are not recipients and
[1:41:36] possessors of the promise that was
[1:41:39] given and so we cannot stop in legalism
[1:41:42] my dress is just right my hair is just
[1:41:44] right and then we justify ourselves by
[1:41:46] measuring ourselves by
[1:41:49] ourselves and you'll find the devil will
[1:41:52] always try to kick a man down to lift
[1:41:55] him up that's what the that's what the
[1:41:58] the Arrogant priest did in the temple he
[1:42:00] said Lord I thank you I'm not like this
[1:42:02] Publican but the Bible said that that
[1:42:05] man was just as sinful as the Publican
[1:42:07] but the Publican was more righteous
[1:42:09] because he was beating on his chest Lord
[1:42:11] I Need Your
[1:42:13] Grace I don't want to be that arrogant
[1:42:16] man that's got all the hair right and
[1:42:18] the and the dress right and the doctrine
[1:42:20] right I want the grace of almighty God I
[1:42:24] need the grace you need the grace of God
[1:42:27] and that ain't just some cheap passport
[1:42:29] so I can watch TV and live like a devil
[1:42:32] the grace of God gives me the power to
[1:42:35] be an overcomer gives me the power to
[1:42:38] receive my healing gives me the power to
[1:42:41] be a
[1:42:42] Victor it is the grace of God that'll
[1:42:45] raise you from the dead it is the grace
[1:42:48] of God that reveals to you you this
[1:42:51] word and it is the grace of God that'll
[1:42:54] take you
[1:42:56] home how many love his
[1:42:58] grace let's stand to our feet let's
[1:43:02] thank the Lord Lord thank you for your
[1:43:04] grace thank you Lord it comes from you

[1:43:09] come I pray Lord Jesus Holy Spirit move
[1:43:13] Among Us now if there are people that
[1:43:16] are Holding On by works Lord open their
[1:43:18] eyes and set them free right now break
[1:43:21] every Power of legalism break every
[1:43:24] Power and stronghold of the enemy that
[1:43:27] binds the people May the grace of God
[1:43:30] the Holy Spirit visit us this morning
[1:43:34] and Lord not Lord not in in just a
[1:43:36] shallow way but Lord down into the
[1:43:39] depths of our souls May the spirit of
[1:43:42] God visit us may Revelation begin to
[1:43:45] break it's like the great Fountains of
[1:43:48] the deep from the depths of the soul

[1:43:52] forth and we see your love and we see

[1:54:38] Victory hallelujah praise be to God God
[1:54:42] has certainly been gracious to speak
[1:54:44] this word to us this morning for our
[1:54:47] church here the last few months I don't
[1:54:50] know if anybody's noticed the themes of
[1:54:53] Grace and letting go of other things and
[1:54:57] embracing his grace and the power of His
[1:54:59] grace it's just been the Lord keeps
[1:55:01] saying it to us over and over again and
[1:55:03] I I do believe the bride is entering
[1:55:06] into deeper
[1:55:07] dimensions and understandings of just
[1:55:11] how Limitless this grace and love is I
[1:55:15] re believe he's entering into that and
[1:55:18] all all the subjects of been along those
[1:55:20] lines even when I speak a series on the
[1:55:22] Holy Ghost the main theme through it has
[1:55:25] been he does the work he calls the
[1:55:29] heart you can't repent without him
[1:55:32] moving upon you first but I tell you if
[1:55:34] he's moving upon you you should repent
[1:55:37] you should come to the Lord because
[1:55:39] there's millions of people may not feel
[1:55:41] that but if you're feeling it this
[1:55:43] morning you ought to act upon it and
[1:55:45] this is how powerful it is that other
[1:55:47] part saying I believe it
[1:55:50] I believe it I Lord I'm asking for it
[1:55:53] cuz he did say in the Bible he'll give
[1:55:55] the Holy Ghost to them that ask so even
[1:55:58] though he's moving on your heart he
[1:55:59] wants you to ask you want to be healed
[1:56:02] he wants you to ask and Lord this is
[1:56:04] your promise it's for me whatever it is
[1:56:06] this morning and I'm so glad I wanted to
[1:56:09] say this I I have so many notes here
[1:56:11] it's tremendous what was said but it
[1:56:13] makes me love the Lord Jesus so much
[1:56:15] more in his Covenant with us and let me
[1:56:18] say this I'm so so glad that God doesn't
[1:56:21] have
[1:56:24] Alzheimer's or
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:27] dementia cuz every time there's
[1:56:29] something like Abraham that he's making
[1:56:31] a mistake he's getting ready to looks
[1:56:33] like he's going to mess up
[1:56:35] everything and every time Israel was the
[1:56:37] place that God even was saying sometimes
[1:56:40] I'll just wipe out the whole thing then
[1:56:43] somehow in the memories of God he comes
[1:56:45] back and he said I remembered my
[1:56:47] promise I got to come back to my promise
[1:56:50] I
[1:56:51] made I'm so glad he don't forget that
[1:56:54] promise he made over our lives and in
[1:56:56] our mistakes he goes back to it but but
[1:56:58] but this is what I promise God's people
[1:57:00] I'm coming back to it and the only
[1:57:03] memories that God cannot remember is one
[1:57:05] that we repent and is washed in the
[1:57:08] blood of the
[1:57:09] Lamb amen it's not in the back of his
[1:57:12] men it's not to pull up anywhere the
[1:57:15] Bible says that's been completely taken
[1:57:16] out and washed in the sea of
[1:57:18] forgetfulness he can't remember your sin
[1:57:20] anymore but oh I'm glad he remembers his
[1:57:23] promise to me can you say praise the
[1:57:25] Lord prise what a what a wonderful
[1:57:27] wonderful message praise the Lord so

[2:00:27] town it's not because of
[2:00:29] us sister sister tabi is
[2:00:32] pastor Pastor due date now so how me be
[2:00:35] praying for her this week amen bring a
[2:00:37] healthy baby we're looking for it here
[2:00:39] she is all the way up here away from her
[2:00:40] hospital I can tell you I've preached
[2:00:42] some babies right some others right into
[2:00:45] labor may it
[2:00:47] happen pulls up them right out
[2:00:50] hallelujah amen God is good you know for
[2:00:54] Saints uh if God has this much grace and
[2:00:57] we are recipients of
[2:00:59] recipients then what the Lord's teaching
[2:01:02] me is that that has to flow through us
[2:01:04] to others can you say amen and if God
[2:01:08] gives us Limitless and unconditional
[2:01:09] Covenant if that's flowing through us
[2:01:12] then that should be flowing through us
[2:01:13] to other people as well we don't justify
[2:01:16] sin but I'll tell you one thing we I I I
[2:01:19] believe that when we when we put
[2:01:21] limitations because it's it's
[2:01:24] really it's denominations that have put
[2:01:27] limitations through 2,000 years on the
[2:01:29] grace of God when you come to the word
[2:01:31] for the last days the final word is for
[2:01:33] God to show salvation is a gift of God
[2:01:36] and it's the grace of God it's a message
[2:01:38] of Grace how in the world the de did the
[2:01:41] devil take this glorious message and
[2:01:43] turn it into works and turn it into
[2:01:46] legalism how did that happen it's the
[2:01:48] devil work to do that but the final
[2:01:51] message is it's a Capstone of Grace that
[2:01:54] comes down on this bride and flows
[2:01:56] through us and whenever whenever we
[2:01:59] limit that uh I believe if we're an
[2:02:02] extension of Grace if I'm not an
[2:02:05] extension of his grace then I become a
[2:02:07] on- man denomination
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:11] myself it's them that has put that
[2:02:13] systems that's put a limitation on the
[2:02:15] grace and made it works again we should
[2:02:17] never do that in this message we should
[2:02:19] know that if his grace has saved us and
[2:02:22] forgave us and brought us to this place
[2:02:24] and it's Grace that saved us are you
[2:02:27] listening and it's Grace that'll take us
[2:02:30] to the end God doesn't start it with
[2:02:32] Grace and now all of a sudden we got to
[2:02:34] get it all together our works he started
[2:02:36] it with Grace he's going to end it with
[2:02:38] Grace and I think we should make have
[2:02:40] that flowing through us to others as
[2:02:43] well remember that we sang that song he
[2:02:46] looked beyond my fault he called it up
[2:02:47] today and I've been thinking this week
[2:02:49] if God looked at me that way and he
[2:02:51] could his grace could look beyond my
[2:02:53] faults and my mistakes cuz I still make
[2:02:55] him even to today if he's got the power
[2:02:58] to look beyond my fault and see my need
[2:03:00] why can't we look Beyond people's
[2:03:04] faults and see their need because for a
[2:03:07] child of God behind every bad thing we
[2:03:09] see in the front on the surface there's
[2:03:11] something laying there that's a need and
[2:03:14] needs God so we should look beyond their
[2:03:17] faults and pray for their need
[2:03:20] Hallelujah did I say we're going to sing
[2:03:22] it again see I forgot that I'm glad God
[2:03:25] doesn't forget me amen and forget his
[2:03:28] Covenant I remember my Covenant with my
[2:03:30] people one more time before we're dis
