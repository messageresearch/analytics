chapter 4 if you have your Bibles we'll read together tonight and uh talk about blessed families again we're enjoying being able to talk together about this and this is the next place in Scripture it speaks of families um mentioned quite a few places but these are key places that I'm drawing out that are inspired to me and uh this would be part 10 bless families we just want to read you in the book of Nehemiah special very special book I've enjoyed the study through it through the years and I pray that it will be a blessing to you tonight amen Nehemiah chapter 4 Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 7 see everybody back the towns took our kids to Johnson City and they were there for enjoy the services this weekend and it's good to have him back with us tonight after their trip on the weekend back as well a lot of weddings going on was at a wedding there several of them there's more coming up jar is coming up jar this isn't your last service with us it Sunday probably all different after that for sure for the good for the good let's be praying for him and Betsy I there's a lot of pressure and a lot of things that come up to the wedding day so let's just give them extra special prayer before the Lord and pray God will bless that day for them I think a lot of the church is going or half of them anyway so we'll have some home I twisted one of the preachers arms to be home here to have a preacher and uh we appreciate brother Josiah doing that uh staying home and uh so there'll be a few here to have a service and so that'll be good Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 7 says but it came to pass that when samulet and tobah and the Arabians and the ammonites and the aites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches begin to be stopped then they were very wroth and conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless we made our prayer to to God and set a watch against them day and night because of them and Judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall and our adversar said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us 10 times from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon you what a threat there verse 13 Nehemiah says therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your houses you know sometimes you got to fight for your daughters and fight for your sons and fight for your household when the enemy really comes in like a flood then we sometimes have to rise up and fight to save our families amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word tonight and may it be inspired not because of me or my gift but may the Holy Ghost Inspire the word to each individual heart for all of us to catch the vision Lord of what you have for us in this day even the young ones catching the vision for their families in the future as you should T may they catch something out of the word Lord that would just stabilize them and anchor certain things Lord to be able to have a good family in the day we live in and bless all the families of literal life Lord and I just pray you'll bless my family as we look at these things may it be another stepping stone for us tonight and we commit the service wholly to you my precious father in Jesus name we ask it amen God bless you as you're seated tonight we just want to go to the word of God and um look at the book of Nehemiah here and look at the incident that took place where he says that he set up the families with their swords and their Spears and their bows but before I do I'd like to say something to the congregation and uh not everyone is here tonight but I'd like to say something about families uh so that uh we we don't have some Among Us who feel not aart or feel kind of left out in this series I don't want anybody to feel left out um and so if you're listening on the Internet or some weren't able to be here tonight A lot of times we listen streaming now I want everybody to know that sometimes family situations can change and I don't want certain ones to feel out because their family situations are different within a body of Christ you you have people and you have people that don't have any family at all you have people that have unbelieving family members in in the city that they live in and so they can only connect on certain things with those unbelieving family members and all of you know that it's just hard to uh come in a common page with a lot of I have a lot of family up here in Michigan I see him maybe every two or three years because we just don't have that much in common it's difficult to you know after about 10 minutes the conversation's over you've kind of reached uh all you can reach unless they're open to talking further and so we have some that way we have some with no family at all we have some with single family homes where the where the mom is raising the children and and uh doing her very best to do that without a father in the home um we have widows uh in the assembly can you say am man and we have we have older bachelors we have younger Bachelors but we have older bachelors and so those are those are different uh family situations that I don't want you to feel like that we're isolating just a certain perfect family of a husband and wife and father and mother and the children and all that uh I I believe with all my heart that when I speak about these principles of a family it includes all the families whatever situation they may be in and uh so I want you to feel that way because in the scripture in 1 Corinthians 7 it even says uh and we have examples of this but it says if the unbelieving depart if you have a husband or wife and the Bible says if the unbelieving depart let him depart uh a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases so I'll read it to you again if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in other words they're not under bondage to stay in that thing that that that is a a bad situation they're not under bage to stay continuing in that to be under that kind kind of into bondage in such cases and when I hear the scripture say in such cases then it tells me back in Paul's day there were other cases than the normal of a husband and wife and the children there was such cases can you say Amen there were other cases and I would say in the day we live in with Satan's attack on the family there's a lot of other cases that come up there's a lot of other situations that is not our choice can you say Amen it's not what the people have chosen and so uh in that we have to realize that so many different family situations pop up the body of Christ needs to support all of the family situations in every way that we can and when someone is lacking something then God will provide that within the body of Christ or at least he should when we yield ourselves if a CH a child is missing a father then she can see a father figure and and Garner a father figure by watching the images of a father within the body of Christ so she won't be lacking can you say me if she was in the world she may not see a good father but she ought to be able to look at the body and say wow I got to see the good image of a good father had a family uh young girl lived with us just uh about a year or so years ago and it wasn't a good family situation uh it was just a very broken up family and so she's married today and happy and serving the lord and she often looks back at the very short time she's been in our home and our home is not perfect by any means but she was able to see some good images that gave her hope that there's a the the the uh the family ended up splitting up and things but she said that I was able to see good images that I could apply to my marriage in the future and you see that's how God does it God never leaves anybody hanging God never leaves anybody just alone can you say amen and if we realize how important the body of Christ is we can find those needs met within the body and so there's so many family situations that pop up I never want anyone to feel left out and let me say this you are in the greatest Family on the face of the Earth and that's the family of God that's right can you say amen amen so don't let the devil tell you you don't have a family you do have a family and it's the greatest family it's the body of Christ and it it has I believe through Christ it has what you need the family of God but sometimes there's different situations how many knew that Timothy uh Timothy was a in a very Timothy was under Paul and he was uh uh Paul was his mentor in the Bible but the history says of Timothy which his name means honoring God Timothy was a son of a mixed marriage Timothy was a son of a mixed marriage and it appears his father died when he was still young and he was raised by his mother and grandmother according to strict Jewish Traditions that's Timothy there's two books in the Bible written with him Paul speaking to Timothy but it came from a mixed marriage and also came with a father dying very young the father wasn't in the picture in Timothy's life so if we use the criteria sometimes say well he's not going to have any hope he can't you know no that's not true he was raised by his grandmother and mother that were Holy Ghost filled people and I'd say he come out pretty good right can I get an amen I think Timothy come out pretty good and Paul refers that he says that uh follow the anointing or follow there something that the instruction you were given by the laying on the hands and foll the instruction your grandmother gave you through the teachings of Christ and all these other things I think it was great ra raised very strict Jewish and then when they came into the faith of God then they became Holy Ghost filled he grew as a young uh Paul being his mentor and then Paul goes so far as to say later he says I have no man likeminded that I could trust save Timothy he came right underneath that Ministry and God Paul could trust Timothy to preach this gospel the same way and there was a lot of men in Paul's life but he certainly trusted Timothy so there's a family situation then it goes on to say he was a resident of lisra or Derby and when Paul and Barnabas arrived in 44 ad his family was converted to the faith and under that conversion I don't know how Tim how young Timothy was but because the grandmother and the mother got filled with the Holy Ghost Timothy was just fine somebody say praise the Lord because the grandmother and mother didn't have a father but he had the Holy Ghost filled grandmother and mother and that was a family yes amen praise the Lord God fills the spaces can you say amen God will love you don't F alone God will love you and God will nurture you as he's the great father and he'll provide what you need now we're going on tonight and we're looking in a place the next place in scripture to encourage the families and uh we looking in here in Nehemiah and we're seeing this setting here uh in Nehemiah has a couple things that we want to bring out we'll probably only get to one tonight maybe finish it next Wednesday night but there's a couple main themes here right in the text and it says verse 13 therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and what he means there is he set them at a place on the wall because they had come to build the build the wall of Jerusalem and he set them but he didn't set them where the families were separate he set them according to their families to build together and so what we're going to talk about tonight is a couple things that I see in this that would be a blessing to the families and that is number one working together for God vision for this day we're going to see here working together for God's vision for this day and uh number two always being ready to fight the forces that hinder the vision amen always being ready to fight against the forces that will hinder the vision because we're going to find and I I won't have time to read it all tonight of course but you read the book of Nehemiah you're going to find samlet and uh uh you're going to find these fellas names of samet and toaya being two men used of the enemy for the sole purpose of trying to stop this building of the wall to try to stop this purpose to try to come against it and they were constantly agitating they were constantly doing everything they can to hinder uh these families building back this wall of Jerusalem if you're trying to serve the Lord and trying to set a higher standard and trying to head in the right direction nobody's perfect here tonight but you're trying to set some order to your family no matter how little a move you make get ready there's a toaya and there's a sble it against you right and they come through people can you say Amen they have names the devil Works through people and he is going to really try hard to come against any family or any father or mother or that step up and say I want to live according to God's principles for my family get ready for a fight get ready for something to be against it and so I was just going to give a quick background and let you know that uh where what the setting is just in case you don't know cuz I know some are just starting to read their Bibles The Young Ones uh some are getting back into their Bibles and so if you never read what neemi Nehemiah is about then you have to realize uh years ago the temple was destroyed God's people rejected God rejected their Prophets The Temple was destroyed they were prophesied Jeremiah said you're going to go into captivity a lot of the religious leaders didn't believe that was going to happen a lot of them said no it can never happen to God's people well it did they were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar and these men taken into Babylon they killed off aot the people they took the young ones the the the the the nicel looking young men and they took them into captivity in Babylon and they took a lot of captives I don't know how many but they took a lot of them and then they tra trampled down the temple they destroyed God's people's Temple and so now then there was a prophecy that said after 70 years uh you will be restored in other words your temple will be built back up again and if you'll turn to me if my people will turn to me then I have a promise that I will restore everything that got trampled down and I'll take you from your cap captivity and take you back into your Homeland and so after 70 years even Daniel caught that he said I understood the number of years that we were to go back according to the books I read of the Prophet praise the lord we understand a lot when we read the books of the Prophet Daniel said I understood by books I understood by Spoken Word books well I didn't quite say it that way but I understood by what books was he reading he was reading the prophets books of Jeremiah he's reading writings and by reading those he got discernment to understand wow in 70 in just a few more years we're headed back no matter what Nebuchadnezzar all the kings say we're headed back because God promised he would restore us so now the season came for restoration it came the time and as the Holy Spirit began to move upon men he moved on three main men and that was zerubabel Ezra and Nehemiah to be leaders to the people to lead groups of families to start the journey and head head back to Jerusalem and begin rebuilding the temple begin to rebuild the priesthood begin to put the sacrifice back in place and also to rebuild the wall and so these three men were used and instrumentals to do that so here they come under a a a holy spirit restoration Ministry to to build and to come back and to to be able to uh come back to their place as God's people again now these are types and shadows of uh the times that we live in because we are under a message that said he would restore all the years that has been lost in other words Joel 228 says though the caterpillar and all these different uh uh uh uh uh animals would eat away at the true tree of life and it's in there in Joel's prophecy they'll eat away at it uh but he said I will restore sayith the Lord so now as we get to the end of that it's time for restoration God begins to work and begins to restore the people back we're under a message of restoration we have come in the last days Jesus spoke of it John uh John spoke of it many of the scriptures speak of the last days are a day of restoration restoring us back to biblical truth restoring us back to Faith in that truth restoring us back to believing that all things are possible restoring us back to the faith of the fathers restoring us back to being like those in the apostolic days can you say man that your faith could raise in your position in Christ that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we're not being coming into some religion that we're a good person and come to church we want the faith of the fathers of Pentecost every believer in the end time say I want that kind of faith not that you're trying to do Miracles but you're also not trying just to be a good religious person that's not our Our Calling can you say Amen our calling is a full restoration back to what our fathers were on the day of Pentecost to Hill shall turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers what whatever they were the Purity everything that they were Faith their love their devotion together that everything that they were I want that I crave that can you say amen I want to be some religion and some denomination and some I'm wearing what I need to wear and I'm I'm giving to the poor I'm doing religious Deeds no the faith of the Pentecostal fathers living in me every day Lord that's what a Christian is today and that's what we're shooting for that's our promise it's a day of restoration and so the the types and the shadows of our times are back here in the book of Nehemiah every time we read now and I didn't discover this till you know maybe 15 16 years ago I didn't realize was reading the message message of Grace and brother bradam reads this scripture if you want to turn with me to Zachariah chapter 4 because this was a prophet during the days of those Restorations and uh they're going to go back and rebuild the Temple and in the book of Zechariah is what he reads in uh message of of grace verse 7 says chapter 4: 7 who art thou a great Mountain before Zer rubbable Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone therefore with shoutings uh Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel hath laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you so it's prophecy of zerubabel when he comes back to build the foundation of God's Temple it's prophecy about the end time that there will be a Ministry of restoration begin and lay the foundations to bring us back to the people that we should be a people of Faith a people back to the faith of Pentecost a people that's molded into a bride that can be married to Christ can you say Amen a people that's coming to full maturity as Sons and Daughters of God with the character with faith virtue knowledge Temperance and patience all those things built into us the character of Christ and so that's prophecy but one thing I noticed here a couple years ago is that we're a part of the building it's not just say well Zer robable came he laid the foundation when I look at that I see and and brother Braham comments right there he says see that's the Malachi 45 behold I send you the Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the children to the fathers he types it right with our restoration min Ministry that Jesus himself said behold I send you he said I'll send you Elijah who truly shall restore all things and Jesus himself himself spoke of it so it begins with the ministry to lay the foundations but foundations are enough I said foundations Aren't Enough once the rubble's done once the foundations are laid that doesn't mean the ministers over it because it says the hands of the reubel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also what finish it God's going to finish it Sunday I said Revelations 10:7 one of the Mysteries is is it's the mystery of Christ The Mystery of God shall be finished in the days of the seventh angel so he's want to finish this mystery of Christ being in you so but one of the things I realize in chapter in hegi uh just one book back hegi chapter 1 he's talking about zero and he hegi the prop is talking about Zer robable and he's he's asking the people in verse 5 to consider their ways verse four is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this how Li house lie waste uh excuse me verse two verse two thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came with the word of the Lord to hegi the prophet is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus say the Lord consider your ways ye have sown much and bring in bring little ye eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm and he that earnthenecklace definitely when they gave me that figure this morning we had to do an extension because our taxes take forever to do we said my wife said somebody else is doing them this year we're having somebody else because it's just so hard to do all of ours and when they came brought that figure that was looking like this morning I was going oh the lord giveth in the IRS take it away but here says that's the way that's the world we live in and he's telling the people you you clothe yourself you you're working you got your own houses and it's all fine except for the house of the Lord was being neglected and you're part of building the house of the Lord that's why I want you to catch it isn't just rubbable it isn't just brother brand but we all have a part in building God's work for the last days amen amen go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and I will take pleasure and I will be glorified sayith the Lord so he's saying for the people to build the house but you will be instrumental and building and that's why I don't believe Z zable is a shadow of just William brandham because he says his hands will finish it I believe it's the entire Ministry of the last days that will finish the whole restoration work can you say man according to Revelations 10:7 and the Mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets we're living in those times God's finishes finishing his work in you are you listening amen we're living in the days God's finishes in his work in his bride he's finishing that and you have uh an in you're an instrument for that in other words you have a part in that families have a part in that and so that's what I want you to to look at tonight as they as they come together and don't be afraid of Shadows and types by the way because that's the way we look at the Bible remember I've been preaching about Jesus said others look at it and they don't understand the parable or they just hear the parable and they walk away but he says you're you're called to understand the mystery of the parable to others it's not given but to you it's given to understand the Mysteries and so we are people who look at the Bible different because we're saying Lord reveal to me what the shadow is I don't want to just read a story in the Old Testament I want to see what it's shadowing and if you don't believe the batt Bible Shadows things then you can't even hardly read the book of Hebrews because the book of Hebrews is Paul taking all the priesthood he's taken all the the the tent all the furniture and he's just laying it out and every one of those things in the Old Testament type is foreshadowing the true reality that's coming so if you don't Believe In Shadows and types and that oh you can't apply something to today then you can't even believe your Bible because it's prophets that catch those shadows and tell us those things so we can see the very time that we're living in yes that's right it's a secret many times the denominations look over and say we don't we don't want to go there because we can interpret it a lot of different ways well scriptures of no private interpretation the Holy Ghost interprets it by bringing it to pass and in the day that you live in God will through his holy spirit interet the hour that you're living in so you can see plainly the day you're living in to walk in the precepts that you're supposed to walk in for the day amen and so now the in the end time is a restoration Ministry and the the shadow of it is under Zer robable Ezra Nehemiah leaders that led families to head back into this we're part of the building and he is using us two one has laid the foundation but there's some to finish it the Myster is to be finished so now the temple was built the the foundation was built and the temple built under Z rable the uh the the priesthood was set up by Ezra and then we come to the book of Nehemiah and as I said I can't read it all but please read it because you get to the start Nehemiah serving a king as the cup Bearer I think he was and he gets word that the wall is crumbled down and the Wall's not been rebuked for some reason he gets this Vision in his heart and he starts crying that the wall of God is not built around the uh the Temple for some reason God just struck his heart and he began to weep and he was very sad for days come in to work that day and the boss said I've never seen you sad pretty good testimony we should learn from that never seen him sad he said I know he said but I've just got some news oh King that back in my land where we come from the Temple's been rebuilt but the walls are torn down and if there's no walls there's no protection for my temple God put it in his heart and God put it upon the king's heart he says listen you take the people that you want to take I'll Supply everything you need you put a trip together look at God working on that man's heart he's not he's not a Jew he's not a Jew is said you do what you need to do I'm supporting that and so now he puts together a whole group to head back and they got all the things that they need and they head back for the sole purpose of rebuilding the wall neemi Nehemiah caught the Revelation the walls are turned torn down and he led a group of people to go back and to build the wall around the temple and when they got back he come in through the night at night he was viewing all the tearing down of the walls he was just so sad about it you got we got a lot of work to do here we got to build but we've got got to do it together and the next the next day as he begin to pursue and put things in order to do it all of a sudden he realizes right away he's going to have some people against it he's going to have some pressure he's going to learn samulet and and tobiah are going to be men that are going to be beh uh going to be uh coming against him and coming against the people discourage the people that you can't do this and all this and he has to keep encouraging the people he has to keep praying say God you called me to do this God this is the work this is the finishing work to build the wall is the final thing to do and we want to do this and we believe we're called to do it and uh samulet and the Bible says his name means strength but he's a moabit samul is a moabit we know where that came from that tribe where it came from and he became the opponent of Nehemiah and The Returned Exiles in their goal of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem tobiah means Jehovah is good to means Jehovah is good and he's the he was the head of the family he returned from Exile with zable but listen to this tobah this toaya he returned with Exile with zero but they were unable to prove their connection with Israel the second uh person was an ammonite Tobi was an ammonite who with samulet opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem now it says they're two different men but it's quite possible that could be the same man one of them who returned back was rubbable but eventually joined in and was influenced by samulet to not be on the ones building the wall but to become a an agitation to ones who are trying to go further and grow in the Lord come on come on now all of a sudden people are along with you oh they're with you say yeah we're all growing together we got the same purpose we got the same mind we got the same vision let's move together and all of a sudden he's influenced by somebody else and now it becomes an agitation to those who want to go forward in the message who who who who want say this is God's vision for the hour this is God's purpose for the hour this is where this is the direction all of our families are headed by the Holy Spirit if somebody turns and goes the opposite way it never works in the body of Christ it's always brings division it's always a an agitation when that happens so the same devil that's working back then is the same devil working today that's right the sablet still come alive there's people that it's against you growing any further than what you are today that's right there's a devil that anoints people to discourage you from going any further right you got to be aware of that they were so against it have your Bibles there if you have them and look look to the things they said chapter two I'm going to move through these quickly chapter 2 and verse 10 says when samlet The Hite and tobiah the servant the am Amorite heard of it it heard of what them rebuilding the wall it grieved them exceeding exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel they hated Nehemiah they couldn't stand it it they they they became exceedingly upset and it grieved them exceedingly two verse 19 says but when samulet the horonite and Tobi the servant the ammonite and gam and the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king so here they laugh him to scorn get ready to get chuckled at get ready to get laughed at get ready to be scorned for what you believe and the purpose that you have catching God's vision for the hour this is what God said he was going to do in this hour according to the Bible and this is what I'm lined up with get ready to get laughed at says in chapter 4 and verse one but it came to pass that when samul had heard that they builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spake before his brother and in the army of Samaria said what did these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned just making fun of it it's not possible they can't do it what do they going to accomplish by themselves and guess what guess what they did because God was with them they finished the work of the Lord because God was with them amen if God be for us who can be against us if God spoken in his word no Devil's going to stop it I'm convinced neither death nor life or anything could separate us from the love of God Amen we will fulfill his purpose as we're obedient to him look at verse 7even and 8 but it came to pass that when samulet and toah the Arabians and the ammonites and the aites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very WTH and conspired all of them together to come come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless Nehemiah said we made our prayer unto God and set a watch against them day and night because of them verse excuse me chapter 6 chapter 6 and verse 12 says and lo I perceive that God had not sent him but that he had Pro pronounced this prophecy against me for tobah and samet had hired him tobiah and samet when they couldn't stop it themselves they hired a prophet to prophesy against them sounds familiar doesn't it B hiring balum yeah so now that makes it harder because it's a prophecy the Jews believe in prophecies but they were taught make sure that prophecy's coming from me he said one day in Deuteronomy 13 said how do we know Deuteronomy 18 how do we know that the prophecy comes from you Lord if I say it and it comes to pass then it came from me if I say it it don't come to pass it didn't come from me right the test of the prophecy amen and so he says I perceive that God had not sent him but that he Pro he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobah and samlet had hired him therefore was he hired that I should be afraid and so do and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me what's the purpose that we might be afraid that we could be scared that we could be put under fear verse 14 says my God think thou upon tobiah and samulet according to these their works and on the prophet no no Noah that was the propheus and the rest of the prophets that they would put me in fear lord it's all you can do sometimes bring it to the Lord L I don't know why they're saying that I don't know why they're against me I don't know why they're being so vindictive towards me and towards the message and just they just become so hateful it seems like they don't even like to hear the term message anymore they become so tainted that they don't even like to hear the term message they get so angry tell you that's not me friend that's not God something is influenced them that way something So Glorious have God sent us and they become so vindictive towards it and so it's what what's it to do to put us under fear to put us under scare to make us afraid to get us to stop in our work of the Lord and what we're trying to do in our families and the direction we're trying to H to rebuild to bring us back to Faith again we're not there friends we're not back to that faith of Pentecost yet and I'm not wanting to sh stop short of it amen sometimes when you look at the church you say how in the world this going to this church going to come back to a Pentecostal church with the faith of the fathers I want to tell you as a pastor I don't want to stop short I don't care what it looks like that's where we're headed amen we have we have to dedicate ourselves we have to consecrate ourselves we have to fast and pray we have to ask for it can you say Amen it has to be our goal throughout this series on blessed families you have to have a goal you're reaching for and all that family is reaching for the same go the you have to tell what the goal is and then say we're not there Lord we we don't know how we can get there but it is the scriptural goal and that is our goal Lord help us help us to consecrate ourselves help us to lay down our own selfishness and attitudes help us to lay down things of the world because this is the goal and those actions prove that you want that go and if you don't want that then you stop short of the promise then then you're happy with where you're at I'm not happy with where I'm at not happy with where I'm at I'm thankful for where I'm at I'm thankful for all that God has given me I'm grateful for what he's done in my life I'm grateful for the Revelation I couldn't have made it this far without the revelation of God but I'm not satisfied with where I'm at or this church we need more faith faith we need more Revival we need people's lives we need more contri we need more humility we need to be at the altar ourselves laying Our Lives before God we need more humility we need more Brokenness we need repentance that's the only way to have Revival fires burning it doesn't come by us just staying cold and formal how many will pray with it for with me praise the Lord I got some on board praise the Lord I was thinking of that guy that today got his sentence what's his name the football player and watching there on the video and watch his reaction no Brokenness no tears life in prison two or three life sentences just so proud and hoty no Brokenness for what he's done of course it's proved that he did it they said the Jailer is saying today on the news the Jailer was with him the whole time he says he's just in another world he doesn't even know he's in jail doesn't even sense he doesn't think he's going to get get caught or anything he lives in another another thing he says he just he doesn't even know it until the sentence came today and when the sentence came he has no expression he has no feeling there's no tears There's No Remorse how does a man get to that spot Pride he don't have to answer to anybody he don't have to learn from anybody he's only he's a young man but he's given all these millions of dollars and no character to be able to handle it think I can kill people and get by with it right no Brokenness no humility No Remorse for what you've done Lord help us that's the kind of thing the world can make you that's the kind of thing the that the devil tries to make the church they're not teachable anymore I always want to be teachable I was always want to be correctable whatever the holy spirit's taking me further and if I get to the place I can't be teachable then I I can't grow anymore can I get an amen amen unless we're broken and humble to come to the altar or to be moved to Tears by the presence of God then we're moving out of the place that we can grow in the Lord that's right amen amen so Lord bring back that Brokenness that I can be touched by the presence of God I can be moved by his presence and I can be corrected when I need to be corrected these are the things that bring Revival right not cold Hearts that's for sure ah Hallelujah so you see all the things that he did and so now while he's building this back in chapter 4 now how he's building this he builds it setting up the families by the walls with their families together and it's read in the Amplified it's read this way so I set armed Men Behind the wall in places where it was least protected interesting I set armed Men Behind the wall in places where it was least protected come on that's good that's good right so there's the thrust by Nehemiah so now I'm going to set up protections so that we can keep working on this wall as families but because of the threat of what might be coming at any time we've got to set some Arm Forces there and we've got to set it in the place that's what least protected we can start with our children come on now because that's the place Satan tries to get our wives we can't get to the man he goes to the weaker vessel attacks her yes get to the children attack them can't get to the man sometimes maybe it's the other way around can't get he can get to the man because he's got some weak spot he doesn't not have underneath the blood he doesn't overcome it yet so he's got a weak spot there so now I'm going to he's in other words Satan is going to attack the weak spot he's going to go to where you're weak and that's what he's teaching us here Nehemiah he's saying take your weak spot and cover it with guards you weak a little bit of this and lust and all these other things you better cover up your weak spots that's the way we're going to live and build this wall is that you got to go to the weak spots and set the guard there amen you got to go overboard when it comes to protecting those SP that's why courtship we had such a great conversation at the youth meeting the other night to to to talk about courtship because I don't want to feel like it's all kinds of rules that's not all about it but what it is is that we're living in a world that's gone to the extreme this way so sometimes it looks like Brother Paul's going the extreme this way it's to counter the age we live in it's to counter our weak spots and So a family should live that way as Nehemiah is teaching us while we're building this great wall and building for the Lord and doing these things that we should do for God's work in this hour we can't do it without protecting our weak spots and watch how the devil gets in in an area would never dream he would get in slip flipping in somewhere he said I put those men there he said Behind the Walls and then he says I set the families in order building in guarding we won't get to the guarding this week as much we'll get to the building we'll get to the guarding next week here they have their swords later on the scripture he said the men were putting up stones and building with one hand and had their sword in the other Lord that's how they build this wall I want you to read that because you'll oh get to it next week that's that's how I do here they are they're working here with one hand but they got their sword in the other that's the way to do it so now he sets these along the wall but he sets them up according to their families in other words I get from that when you're going to have this great work of the Lord the families are set up together building this together and they're catching the goal for the hour they're catching ing the purpose they've come back out of Babylon captivity they've headed back and for some reason God wants them to not do this as separate family members and you know you got the teenager over here and he's on the other side and you got the children over here for some reason he said I want you to build this together I want you to work on this as a family together right sir catch what God's saying now friends because we ought to be really listening because we live in a day that is always trying to separate the family members where the teenagers go here and the children will go over here and they're shipped out over here and you got to sh sometimes they ship them out to daycare over here and this way and the mom's going here and the Dad's going here they're like two ships passing in the night that's the society we live in that's the day we live in no wonder families break up so quickly I'm not even talking about spiritually I'm just talking about it always has us going 50 different directions where rarely there's time for the family to be together to even talk about what their goal is what they want to accomplish what they want to do get to get to know one another and get a feeling for one another and then I can fight for you together because children and the family feel more security when there's times together they feel security from that so now here they are catching the goal and being a part of the F of this as a family Nehemiah wanted them working together on this not separate there's so many things that send us different ways in the world we live in and put us in different age groups even the church does that did you know that we got Sunday school we got youth groups we got couples meetings and there was a book that a fellow read about the church world that that he wondered if all of that had contributed cuz a lot of churches I I like it when we can all come together for the regular service where we sit together as families for the word but a lot of churches I didn't know this till later on that that the entire service the children are all in a children's area the entire time and I'm always wondering how those teachers get fed the word of gone for that week if they're just with the kids the whole time and then they've got the youth they got a whole youth explosion or whatever they call it they got a youth thing going on and and uh all the parents and then they got the older ones in different classes suay morning and so the whole everything is separate ages and I'm not saying that's a bad thing except for except for it doesn't seem to have the big vision of bringing the families together that they can learn it because there's benefits there's benefits to the young ones being around the older ones if they're with their peers all the time I don't know how much they're going to learn amen and so you know if there's a boy and he hasn't been around his dad a lot he didn't have a good dad situation then in the body of Christ there would be opportunities for him to be around older strong Holy Ghost filled men amen that's what that boy needs he doesn't need to be around the girls all the time he doesn't need to be around the youth all the time he needs an image of a strong man to learn from so if we're always separating them all the time and you never have opportunities for them to be together then those those strengths can't take place you understand it would be the girl the same way you know she had a bad home situation or whatever and so now if she stays amongst the youth she may not be able to see the images she needs to see to go and become a wife and a mother according to God's word she didn't see the Right image so the only way she sees it is to hear these women talk hear these older women sister inz and the different ones and hear them talk and my mom and see how they function and and they might say things sometimes and that that younger girl go that's whatever you know but they still need to hear it that's right they need to see that long pattern of that woman being faithful all those years everything's consistent in her life Holy Ghost filled and that's why the Bible says let the older women teach the younger women to be keepers at home amen that's bible teach them to take care of their children to be keepers of home that's what the Bible say the older women should teach the young woman it's not by just having a class teaching them we've done that but it's by example it's by watching their mannerisms how do they relate to their husband how you know how all these things happen images are more important than what said over the pulpit if you could preach all the truth and not see images of it being lived what good would it do if I preaw this and our young people couldn't see images of a holy ghost filled person and how that acts then IM see image is more important even than just hearing it in the word they need to be able to look and so now you start separating this too much maybe this is a good lesson for us is that let me say to you young men is that you need to be around the guys that's great it's lovely I'm not against it but you also need to be around these older guys in the church he's older men you need to learn with them about finances you need to learn how they do that how they talk about their money how they talk about different things that they do and you can learn from that I'd rather you learn here than somewhere else right you young girls that are young marrieds you need to learn from the older marriage you need to be around that some not always all the teenage girls yeah your in you're kind of going backwards you might stay a teenager your husband didn't marry a teenager well maybe he did but he doesn't want a teenager the rest of your life and young girl uh that that guy you married that girl's probably saying to you I don't want you to stay a teenage boy all your life grow up you know 50,000 IR hours a week on video games time to grow up when I was a child I was a child when I became a man I put away childish things these are images you see and the world we live in is to keep everybody a teenager I guarantee you that's right keep them in a young teenage State that's the world we live in but the Bible Praises somebody growing into not that they don't become fun anymore but they grow into aged men that are inheriting the promises that's what the Bible glorifies and that's what all of us young should be shooting for somebody that's growing into that maturity of wisdom of life know how to handle the devil you know how to handle your finances according to the word of God you know how to do this you you figured it you figured it out by the word of God and you're living that out you boys need to see those images and you girls need to see those images of older women and if you run from that you're running from a Biblical way and you're not going to grow up in certain areas that's right all this is not in my notes tonight this is all free completely it's all free actually so now you feel relieved right no special offerings tonight you know it's a good subject we don't talk about this enough good because the world separates but we want to be careful that we're not separating so much the families according to the scripture God likes the families to be together yeah working on the work of the Lord together and uh taking a family trip together amen no matter how hard it is sometimes on that family trip it's good it's all good brother Braham says in uh Middletown Ohio down here in the message uncertain sound our home life has broke up and years ago it used to be that mother and dad was home at night used to be that mother and dad was home at night if it wasn't for church sometimes or something they were home at night and they never let their children they never let their children roam the streets and run around all night and nowadays it seems to kind of a popular opinion oh how how you just go to the modern home today and look what it is Papa he has to hurry down to the pool room the boys are down playing pool or bowling or something him and M the sister's at the canteen somewhere at some rock and roll party Junior's got the hot rod out seeing how many he can outrun with it and that's about what home life is and the Bible oh the Bible it's a great book but it's put in a drawer somewhere until the until the pastor comes over or somebody comes over and we just don't have the home life we used to have home life is so uncertain and I'll add insecure thus it makes those teenagers and kids feel separated feel insecure they're they're trying to put on a show that they're not scared like the guy walking through the graveyard or walking by the graveyard he's whistling so he can tell everybody he's not as scared but he's scared children sometimes won't admit it but they're scared to death because they feel insecurity there's no solidness in the family there's no Unity there's no togetherness there's not what is the absolute of what we believe what do we come what do we come together on I know I'm I'm I Stumble sometimes in my words but I pray the Holy Spirit would get this to you tonight I'm talking about the families being together so that the children and teenagers feel a security in something besides money feel a security in something besides entertainment do you forget what I said last Wednesday night your home can't be a child centered home you can't have an entertainment do you have an entertainment centered home that's all about what's the next entertainment what's the next vacation and you live for that it's what everybody talks about what's the next entertainment what's the next movie that's coming out so we can all watch together that's an entertainment centered home can't do that can't be a wife centered home everything revolves around the emotions of the wife or the emotions of the husband no it can't be an emotion centered home as I was preached to you last last week it has to be a Christ centered home so will you have emotions yes will you have these things to deal with yes all that's normal but what you always come back to well we have a need in our life we feel like we're getting off track families come together let's pray about this let's bring this before the Lord that's a Christ centered home amen daddy comes and says guys I I've been wrong on some stuff I've got off track here I shouldn't acted that way shouldn't have done this I've done made some bad decisions and I apologize you kids and I'm going to do my best to not ever do that again that's a Christ centered home why because it's the humility of Christ that's pointing to Christ it's pointing the kids to Christ yes Mom says you know I I I've done some things and I just I want I'll make that right and I want to be able to do that that's a Christ Center home let's go to prayer let's go to church let's let's take our vacation and get in a couple of those meetings that are going on let's hear the good word of God that's Christ centered home anybody anybody listening tonight now can't be centered around anything else or it can't be a blessed family and so we have an atmosphere in the world that breaks up families and I'm about ready to wrap it up here tonight so we have an atmosphere that breaks up families in the world and it starts by getting everybody going separate ways as brother Bram says Susie's running over here and she's got this to do and all there and I know we get busy doing things and then there's never a night when the family comes together there's never a Time where we just come together and Center on Christ in prayer and talking about things even if it's not just on that kids need a chance to share the burdens they're going through and if Mom and Dad don't have time to hear that they're too busy you're too busy if you don't have time to hear the burdens of your kid that's not being child centered that's being a parent like our our heavenly father who's willing to listen to us any time amen there's nothing more important for God when his children are crying out to him he lays everything else aside for you amen and that's what we do as parents we say my this is critical that I set everything else aside and hear the heart and have the heart of my kids not their heads have their hearts where is the heart of that kid where's the heart of that teenager and that's that's a little bit more challenging to know where the heart of your teenager is but you got to spend time if I go a few days and I don't know the heart of one of my my teenagers I start getting nervous I start getting unsettled right what are they thinking what what are they you know what's going on in that uh brain of theirs you know what are they thinking they're sitting over there and you know they're going like this usually and when they're not they're they're going like this and you ask your son you say how was your day it was all right how's life all right it's about the extent of what you get out of them sometimes really sharing their heart is all right but you got to know where their heart is you got to romance their heart you've got to come close to them and want to know what's what's what what's going on so you can pray for them so you can encourage them praise the Lord so now now we have to work against this world that separates us all the time that we come together more often and when you do that trust me you will have more Security in your wife more Security in your children more security as a whole as a family you think you'll watch things turn around that you maybe couldn't feel like you couldn't turn around but because the family has a goal and that's what I'm preaching to you tonight as they were headed back from captivity they had a goal they would have to get jobs and me do all that but they what was the goal to rebuild this wall to rebuild this this is the work of the Lord this is his vision for the hour and guess what family we're a part of that Vision teach your children to be a part of the vision of the hour yes find out what God's vision is and teach your children to be a part of it do you have a goal do you have a family goal do you have a a a a a a mission statement do you have what you're shooting for as a family have you ever sit down and talked about where you're going as a family you know the Bible says without a vision the people perish what is your family Vision where do you want to go where do you want to be five years from now where what is the ultimate goal and and that goal should be rooted in Christ and his goal that we're of the day we're living in and uh if we see our place in the vision for the last days then we bring our family in line with his vision for this hour as they did in the days of Nehemiah and you connect those children you listening fathers mothers connect those children with the scriptures on how God says we live to please him don't just assume they know it connect them with the absolutes of the word is everybody tired tonight or some are tired hello all right now I got your attention connect those children with the scriptures that show how God says we live to please him connect him with those scriptures see it just seems so intellectual so no no no just connect them with the scriptures let God do the rest pray and let God do the rest his word is his will and we're a family that's seeking his will and not our own will that's right now how many families say I'm seeking God's will will it's a lot easier to raise your hand on that than to really believe it and put it into practice because his word is his will you want God's will for your life a lot of times we think of his will in terms of what job I'm supposed to have or what what city I'm supposed to live in yeah that's all part of it but a few years ago I preached that first of all the will of God is the word of God the word of God for the day what did God want to accomplish for this day and so when we connect with that and know God's will for the day then and you pray with that then God will lead you guide you as a Shepherd to what job you're supposed to have what city you're supposed to live what church you're supposed to be in he'll show you his will but always remember his word is his will and you could search for a job all you want to and the city you're supposed to live in and do all these other things and completely miss the vision that God's trying to accomplish in this day that we live in right some of this stuff is I think uh practical but I pray it's a blessing to you so now our family our identity for our family what is your family identity what are you known by my dad used to say if you were you were convicted as a Christian when they went around your house and went around your life would there be enough evidence to convict you for being a CH for being a Christian and so now what is your family identity what are you known for and our our identity for our family should not be some new version of the Bible but bible-based and people know that our family is bible-based our identity is distinctively a Christian family that obeys the precepts of God that's our identity that doesn't change you can have all kinds of sorts of identities people you're what you're known by but it should start with this and if you live in the blessed time to receive a Ministry that expresses God's will for the present times then praise God Amen if you're blessed which you are to live in a day where God expresses a Ministry to bring God's will for the present time then you should praise God and that's what we should follow Bible says let me read it the way it says this in Titus 2: 11-2 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and Godly in this present world now Paul's talking about his time because he said that right we should be soberly righteously Godly in this present World well we can apply that to our day and say our goal as a family is to deny ungodliness and worldly lust and we should live soberly righteously and godly in our present world not Paul's day in this present world what does it mean to live righteous in our world what does does it mean to live Godly in our world what does it mean to live soberly in our present day so then you start taking all the extremes of this Earth and what they teach us right from uh beauty is emphasized over character a woman's body is emphasized the nakedness of a woman's body is is thrown out there not to be totally naked but to show just enough of it that it excites men's lust that's the world we live in so how do we live soberly and righteously to teach our children we go the opposite of that and we believe in modesty because why we're living in this present world where a woman's body is emphasized and put out there as flesh wholesale beauty so that's our present world what's our present world was TVs and movies Paul's present world no so you don't think preachers got to preach about TV and movies come on why because the Bible says we're supposed to live righteously and godly in our present World well I need Scripture for that well you're not going to find a scripture about TV yeah except for tell the vision to no man which doesn't really fit that's a long shot but I can use set no evil thing before you but you're not going to find television in there you're not going to find internet in there that's right but you're going to find about being trapped by the internet don't shake your head Jared being my s tonight you're not going to find the worldwide web in there you're going to find stuff about being trapped but not the worldwide web interesting isn't it I got to see it in here I I got to see what we're supposed to wear in there well you're the Blessed people that get specifics from a man sent from God that's right his ministry is over but he set the order for the age and I'm not going to be ashamed to say this I'm not going to be ashamed to preach it because I feel it's not a curse it's a blessing that you because some of the other ages never had that quality to be able to come from God and tell us in this present age this is how someone should dress this is how we should live this is how we should act so I don't have any problem teaching my kids that I don't feel no shame maybe they Co it's a cult or something it's not a cult John the Baptist wasn't a cult when the Bible said there was a man sent from God whose name was John he came from God to point us to Christ so why would I be ashamed to point my kids to the very Ministry that was sent and the word that was sent through him to bring us back to how Christ would live in the present day that we live in amen unashamed of it you're blessed that's how families are blessed amen can you say Amen praise the Lord I know I'm wrapping it up here but you if you want to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world you do the opposite of the times you live in and you'll probably be better off do the opposite all right I'm going to wrap it up because people are so tired tonight in this age it was a Ministry to restore to give us the stones to rebuild as he gave them we put them in a in as God gave the stones to rebuild our lives we put them in place in our lives friends under Zer robable the ministry restoration he's given us the tools and the things that we need to rebuild a family to restore Faith to restore us back to a fully matured Sons and Daughters of God today he's given us all what we need but we have to put it in place we have to put those stones in place like I told a SI young sister the other night is that if God puts a stone in front of your path a stone is a revelation a rock has a revelation don't worry about what you're not doing yet what you're not seeing Oh I need need to do this just step on that stone if it's from God and stand on that Revelation and watch for the next one to pop out and God will show you next because we live by Revelation amen God's given us these stones to build to build people of Faith to build the bride for the last days to build families restoration reconciliation he's given us the tools to do and he's given us the building temples for Jesus to live in stone by Stone Faith virtue knowledge Stone by Stone Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience the statue of a perect man that great stone that he talks about in Zachariah great stone with cry's Grace Grace unto it that great and that Capstone love coming on it he's building us into the people of God by those virtues of Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness every day things happen in the whole home and you can either act like the world or you can yield to God to say God build the stones of Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience in me you need more patience or your kid needs it pray and say God help us to place that stone in our lives need more brotherly kindness some of your teenagers need more brotherly kindness or sisterly kindness you need more virtue you need more faith you need more knowledge patience Temperance charity brother Donnie had a great message on charity last Saturday night you should listen to it you'd be surprised what charity is and how it acts according to 1 Corinthians 13 it's the Capstone we need charity in our lives we need to put it on what is your family goal what do you want to accomplish for him what's your family Vision man got make some money send the kids to college and I don't know after that I think you should pray and get a little better Family Vision than that teach your kids to have a f better Family Vision Without A Vision the people perish we're today in the work of taking this message and watching the Holy Ghost build a people unto himself and if families could catch that Vision then I believe that it will put them in a channel that God can do the work in your life and to bring you to that Perfection and that place that you want to come to that the Holy Ghost is really using your family for something for his kingdom and that's what we should desire can you say amen I pulled a lifetime vision statement of our family this kind of a intimate close thing to us I wrote several years ago and I'm not reading for you to copy this at all but I wrote this years ago family mission statement we will honor and obey the word of God in all that we say and do Christ will be the center and unseen guest in our home haven't even had a chance to put this up on a uh a picture or something but I like to put it up in words on the wall we will live the example and the life of Jesus Christ to those around us serving the body of Christ and not ourselves will be our utmost priority we will strive for perfect Oneness in Christ in our marriage and our family what's our values we always live for others starting with our own family members in our treatment of each other we will maintain the highest level of respect including not falsely accusing not raising our voice in Anger not putting each other down and this applies to any other people as well say brother Paul how do you get that well we may not have it all yet but I think it's good to set a goal based upon the word of God I think it's good to put it before us that's where we're headed that's what Christ expects of us that's what he'd like to see living through us as he lives in our lives uh being in church when the doors are open is one of our one of our priorities in life unless an absolute emergency no event will be placed instead of church we will limit what is purchased with credit most purchases will be done because of the cash has been saved to do so money is a tool we use for life and we should always be in control of it money should never control us or our emotions what we receive we consider a gift from God and we seek to take care of it and be a wise Steward over it stand with me if I read as I read the rest of this I don't want you to what we received we consider a gift from God and we'll seek to take care of it and be a wise Steward over it decisions are made only after prayer major decisions are not made until thorough research as to the best decision counsel from our accountability Partners in a time of much prayer time is one of God's greatest tools to swow his perfect will the children are to fully obey the leadership and correction of parents Disobedience will be punished one warning is allowed and then judgment warning then judgment the children's priority in younger years is education in school and godly principles of Life other social events or entertainments are always a reward after school and other work is done entertainments and relaxing time are small portion of life to enjoy never in excess honesty Integrity love joy peace longsuffering faithfulness and respect are foundations for our family and should never be compromised any influence of people or things with an evil spirit to break the Oneness of our family will not be welcome in our home as the children grow into young adulthood the parents will still be involved in the choice of Associates and friends no serious relationship with the opposite sex will be allowed until 18 years of age this is to ensure a happy undistracted young adulthood and preparation for marriage and life in future years the vision for the family the vision of our family will be aligned with the vision of God for the times we live in God has a purpose God has a message for every generation and any goal or dream or purpose we pursue will fit in with God's achievement for the day he revealed that purpose through a prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and6 he began that purpose by using this Prophet to fulfill Revelations 10:7 the steals taken off the book of redemption and the Mystery of God being finished this book being opened will prepare and bring a bride to Perfection and maturity to be married to a Son of God to the Son of God washed in the word without spot or blemish we become carriers of these Mysteries and Proclaim them to this Final Destination in any way that we can we we are the final voice to the final age you say well that seemed kind of heavy I wrote that when the kids were little that seems kind of heavy but it's the vision for the hour and I want them to hear it amen they might not understand it all but that's what God has done and that's the times God's placed Us in and I want them to know that we are a part of this building can you say Amen we're part of the message we're part of what God wanted to achieve for this hour and I believe that's what Nehemiah was trying to say Hey listen put your word towards the work of the Lord here and God will bless you and do it together as a family do it together as a family praise the Lord would you pray with me would you raise your hand if you want prayer tonight would you lift your voice and pray with me this evening Heavenly Father your goodness to us Lord is just been abundant and we have enjoyed being able to learn from your word in this simple way father I pray it is simple to the people Lord not trying to bring it in some great Revelation or something Lord that's ununderstandable but Lord we can be practical so that Lord the families can be blessed bless every family Lord no matter what condition what place that they're in what stage Lord how their family would be single families whatever it would be we pray that you will bless them encourage them in the things of the lord lord what a great thing that Nehemiah did that day when he gathered all the children with each family and said you work on this wall together you stand there and hold your weapons in your hand and be ready for the enemy but work on it together so the children can see this family has a purpose and that's fulfilling the word of God for our day that they can look back one day and see that wall finished see all the sance and all the influences trying to come against it they can look back those children can see look what God has done through our family finishing the work of God what a blessed thing that would be Lord and I pray at the end of the road my family would be able to to look together and say the god of Glory has accomplished helping Souls helping somebody for the kingdom helping somebody along the way Lord building these building stones into our lives Lord let them see what the work you can do father Lord many families starting up and just beginning and young children I just pray you'll bless them Lord each one that they catch the vision for this hour put their lives in order underneath it not to be afraid to do it but just Lord relax and take your word teach it to their children come together on one thing Oneness of God we thank you Father
