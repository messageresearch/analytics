TRANSCRIPT
========================================
together and today I'm going to do my best to finish up this long series here on the more excellent way and I want to talk a little bit about moving into a face-to-face relationship with the lord it's the last part of First Corinthians 13 and if I don't get it finished tonight maybe I'll finish it Wednesday night but I'd like to wrap this series up on Divine love and one of the reasons I want to because there's just a host of things the Lord has impressed on my heart for the coming weeks as far as my part in preaching and so there's so many things he's opening up and I think you're going to be going to bring you great joy to see what the Lord's dropping in our hearts for the congregation so we want to get to those things so hopefully we can wrap some of these things up and conclude and give a climax to talking about Divine love I trust this has been a blessing to you to be able to look at this I think they have them on the YouTube channel and so you can listen to them again and also as I promised I'll be giving you a little handout of the notes and and the quotes and the scriptures that we've used throughout the whole series the PowerPoint that we used and so I'm a little slow at doing that stuff I'm technically challenged so I have my secretary and different ones get that done and hopefully in the next few weeks get that out to you because I did promise that to you first Corinthians 13 at the end First Corinthians 13 at the very end and we're going to as I said try to conclude and wrap this subject up and it's very important what he says here at the end of first Corinthians 13 and last service we were dealing with verse 11 when I was a child so let's just step back into verse 9 and we'll catch the theme again for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away it's a very very important thing so we we and he's talking about knowing god we know God with partial revelation we see him with partial Revelation and we prophesy with partial Revelation but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away and what he means by that that one day which I believe we're in that time uh we will come to a time that's not seeing Christ in a partial Revelation but a perfect revelation and that's prophesied for the end time this is Paul's prophecy hid when that which is perfect has come so aren't you happy this morning that you live in the time that we will see a perfect vision of Christ not just the partial revelation when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly and this is the scriptures I'll get to today for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part in portion in in a partial Vision now I see a partial Vision but then but then shall I know even as also I am known we want to preach on these things today because what a great Revelation to see and to be known by him but not only will he we we are known by him but we will know him in his fullness he will know us and our fullness and we will know him in his fullness because it's a face-to-face relationship and now abided faith hope charity Divine love these three but the greatest of these is divine love amen father bless your word today and bless those Souls that have come today those that are listening online and we pray father you bless our time together bless the uh the the Bride As she meets around the world Lord under the five-fold ministry today wherever they may be feed your people Lord You're always faithful you stored up food for us Lord so that those who would come and are hungry gathered around the fresh carcass of God's word you'd have food for them in this hour to sustain us to give us strength to be help us to be able to make it through whatever trial we would come up Lord make it through this Dark World you put the things in place to feed us Lord and I prayed I'd be a vessel to give that to the people today we're looking to you we are confident Lord that you have done Mighty things and you will do great and mighty things in our hearts today we commit the service to you in in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated we appreciate the meetings last weekend I can't uh I can't say too it's just incredible what the Lord spoke to us if you want to listen those are on the line as well many of you were here we had wonderful meetings with brother Craig Brewer I want to say thank you to the staff and all the sisters and helpers that helped Sister Miriam and all those in the kitchen you did a superb job thank you so much God rewards you for laboring it all went very smooth I asked Miriam and Boaz and it went just so smooth with all the help and all the millions of cookies that came in for the meetings I'm still eating some of those but we we thank you sisters you did a wonderful job helping us out and we know we were able to be a blessing to those visitors who came in for the special meetings we're we appreciate that so much tonight at five we'll be here for a hymns and classic sing-along and we've invited the community and different ones who want to come we're going to be singing some hymns Gideon will be leading in some worship and some other songs as well so we invite you to come out tonight at five o'clock we'll be doing so we want to just try to wrap up the last few verses of First Corinthians 13 and if you're a Christian I'm sure you've studied the scripture and looked at these things we've enjoyed looking through the whole chapter as it has called it a bit of a window outside of the correction that Paul was given to the Corinthian Church who had leaned towards emotionalism and leaned towards prophecies and made such an emphasis on those things that Paul Wright in the middle of all of his correction to put the gifts in order and all that right in the middle of it he has this little window into the more excellent way he says he says that all these gifts covet the best gifts they're wonderful they're of God but yet I show unto you a more excellent way and then he breaks into what that more excellent way is and ends the chapter with the prophecy saying that we'll actually come to a more perfect way at the end time and when we see him in that way face to face we will the bride will come into this victory in Divine love how many believe that this morning so because it's a prophecy for our day then it becomes a very significant thing for us to look at and to realize and it would just like to talk about this face-to-face moving into a face-to-face relationship with Christ and I'll just say that it's really the only entrance into this excellent way how many would raise your hand and say I if God said I could live in this victory in Divine love and live in this more excellent way I mean raise your hands I want to live there every day and so Paul shows us the entrance to this more excellent way is a face-to-face relationship with Christ not a partial and when he uses the term we see through a glass Darkly it's a symbol it's a it's a word picture to show us uh it could be a mirror it could be uh looking through a window that's clouded uh if I had an example this morning I have a window and so it's nothing worse than trying to look through a Windows see something clearly and it's it's clouded with something something sprayed on it and so you have a partial vision of who's behind the window you can see it's Jesus you can see a works of Jesus you can see someone's back there but you never can sear it perfectly clearly and he says throughout Seven Ages we've seen through a glass Darkly Christ has done things he's manifested his power we know it's Christ behind there but we we or prophecies is seeing him in part we're living at a level of seeing him in part but there's a a more powerful relationship coming to the church at the end time that we don't see him through a glass Darkly but we see him face to face and that changes everything can you say Amen and so um we've talked in First Corinthians 13 I don't have to rehearse this too much but we we've talked about this more excellent way of divine love and he wraps it up with growing out of our childhood spiritually childishness spiritually is depending too much on temporal manifestations of God that's why he says when I was a child I spake as a child I I did things I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things in other words spiritually speaking you can't stay a child spiritually and a child spiritually would put his his emphasis too much on temporal things prophecies they'll fail these other tongues they shall cease and so don't put all the emphasis on that because you see that's temporal but Divine love is eternal so if we had all that but we missed Divine love we're missed an important the most important thing and so this is great mature teaching to the church and uh so we're not growing uh in Victory in Divine love if we're living on temporal manifestations of God or depending too much on manifestations of God that are temporal we're not growing in Divine love and and people can do that all of us can do that so also spiritual childness is getting puffed up with the gifts with the sacrifices he said though I give to the poor and have not love I am nothing so it's giving to the poor though I understand all Mysteries and have not love it is nothing though I can prophesy though I can have faith to remove mountains he's basically covering all the manifestations of the true church and yet he says if I had that and didn't have this it would mean nothing it's a pretty powerful statement so we got to make sure that our emphasis and what we reach towards is something to grow into mature of the maturity of divine love and not depending and I'll say this again the tendency and childishness is to get puffed up with the gift I've got my gift I've got one of the nine spiritual gifts or sacrifices you make you get puffed up with it or or not growing into the humility of this Divine love someone's growing more in Pride than they are humility there's something wrong with a Christian who's growing more in Pride with the message than growing in humility because if he's meeting Christ face to face he's coming into more humility and now we watch it not only outside but in our own ranks as someone someone's gift gets lifted up whether it's preaching or prophecy or someone gets lifted up to or something and they personally get lifted up this is my gift this is what I do and they get lifted up in Pride and lose their humility there's something wrong with that because that becomes child it stays childish they're depending on their gift when I leave this platform this morning I go back to my life in Christ I go back to surrendering in private just like I do in public my gift can work this morning if anybody has a gift singing or preaching or whatever gift it is your gift will work if you yield yourself but I gotta live the Sanctified life when I leave this Pulpit I can preach and you can enjoy it and compliments he like the anointing was upon me and the Lord comes on and that's wonderful but I could live in Pride off of I must be okay because my gift went well and people are praising me but everything that I see in scripture me showing the character of Christ is that anybody who is extremely gifted including prophets whenever they were pushed by the people to lift themselves up they always dispelled it and said no don't do that they stayed humble with their gift they wanted to make themselves not popular when the people were trying to make them popular everything I see there's no popular people there's no Superstars there's no Divas in the kingdom of God can I get an amen this morning everyone all the way through Joseph got lifted up to the throne Daniel got lifted up to the throne but every time it starts to people start to praise they said don't praise me praise the god who's using me that's what we need to see in musicians and singers and big preachers we need to see one key element more humility of Christ and then the Bible says Jesus he says he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God but yet made himself of no reputation he intentionally made himself of no reputation how many members of the places in the Bible where he did a miracle and told the person don't go tell nobody about this how many preachers do you have like that something great happens and they lay hands under somebody and they want the whole world to hear it well Jesus wasn't that way for a long time it's not my time yet don't tell anybody what happened that's humility he wasn't promoting and putting out his ministry he was actually trying to decrease it and not too many amens on that but that's the that's the character in Scripture and we should look for that in preachers in singers in anybody who's who's who's raising because sometimes a gift will raise and be greatly used but we better be seeing the character of humility coming out of it and then there's a tendency to have a religious spirit instead of the real spirit and get lifted up in Pride the gift instead of the character of The Giver is emphasized shouting is what he does and ignoring who he is in other words shouting over what God does and ignoring who Jesus is is a great immaturity is this okay with everybody so when the the scripture says here in First Corinthians we prophesy in part in part of course it means partial Revelation partial vision of Jesus and and Paul says God will move us to a perfect Revelation not a partial Revelation but a perfect Revelation from the part to the perfect to Perfection and the opening of the seals at the end time I believe is very much a part if not a significant part of this Perfection that we come to that opening of the seals in 1963 as a part of coming into that Perfection and coming into that more excellent way it's not the it's not the whole thing and and so so you don't think I'm being disrespectful I just want to explain this I believe it was Benjamin Franklin uh the prophet said that he invented and he found electricity he found there was another source there that they couldn't be seen before so he finds it and he said I got it I got it I got it I got it and brother says but he didn't really know what he had but he had something I got it I got it I got it yeah this is great but he didn't know what he had until later on uh another one comes Thomas Edison comes around and he harnesses what he discovered he harnesses it to make it work I tell you we need a church on the rise can you say man that not just makes the seals and the opening of the word just Doctrine but how to live it every day how to make it work in faith can you say Amen for years this feel I feel like there's so many conventions as we got it we got it we're the bride we got it but you've got to find a heart you've got to harness that into an everyday life praise the Lord you may have something and you know what I'll tell you when you have the perfect word come to you you do have something but it doesn't mean the Perfection has come to you yet personally see he's not just he's not just bringing a perfect word which he has but he's bringing his people to Perfection and maturity and remember when Jesus said be therefore perfect it didn't mean Flawless or or something like that in the flesh it meant growth to maturity that's what he meant I said be perfect as your father's and it's growth to maturity if we're not growing in the word and in the vision we see of Christ then that we're not going anywhere and so that's what he wants to take his people to perfection I got it I got it I got it but he didn't know what he had we need to know what we have but not just praise and worship and Shout over what we have and that maybe we're better than everybody else get rid of all that I've I've got something I said but let the Holy Spirit take what you got and bring you to a perfection in it is that okay with everybody so what what we are what we are called to in this present time what are we called to living in understand Vine love as our motive for everything that we do living in a more perfect understanding of him is what Paul's saying living in a more perfect understanding of him with Divine love is the motive for everything that we do every gift everything that we do every every reaction to people we've been preaching this everything that comes in life every trial if we're in that realm of divine love then our reaction is divine love and that's because we have a perfect understanding or we're growing into a perfect understanding of who Christ is we're wanting that to work through our lives if we and listen now if we don't have distinctions from the rest of churches in in our character then we are really like the rest and sometimes we can put down the other churches and I don't think that's right either say well we're different we're better we're you know we have we're better than denominations we're better than these other churches well let's see the character of Christ because the distinctions isn't that you have a building or that you have good music or that you have good preachers the distinction the distinction there has to be a further distinction is Christ himself living in the people Jesus said something interesting in Matthew 5 he said for if we love them if ye love them that love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same so he's saying that you know if you have the same characteristics of only loving those that you want to love and you're selective in your love then you're really not any different than the rest of people Jesus is teaching it I'm not and then he says and if you salute or greet your brethren only what do you eat more than others the publicans do the same they have their Clique they have their Clan and they greet one another and kind of ditch everybody else we're the elite group and he says if you're doing that amongst yourself as Brethren you're really not much different in character than what they are praise the Lord I'm always safe when I'm teaching what Jesus said can you say man because you if you're a Believer you have to say amen and Jesus said you better watch it because you'll get amongst yourself and then you become partial you become selective you become I got my own group here and so now your love becomes selective to your only your friends can you say Amen I used to say it this way you invite so-and-so your real friend over and you serve them steak and the other people you're a little leery of but maybe you'll have them over and you have them over hot dogs your attitude towards them is showing up and we don't have to a right to be respecter of persons like that the worst looking sinner the worst looking person the person that's Bound by all kinds of things I have to catch myself all the time because I have the Holy Spirit of God the same Holy Spirit the prophet had same one the Lord had when we look at this world it's falling apart every day in the news we're seeing this gender thing raised to the top of the news it's infiltrating our company our country and our children can you say Amen I'm greatly concerned and it puts a a something when I see this Spirit of homosexuality in the spirit of mixing genders it just turns my stomach there's something in there that Grieves my heart and I'm glad it Grieves can you say man but in my attitude I have to be careful that I don't put that person in a category with all those tattoos on and all those things on because you know have they had a chance to hear the gospel yet have they have the chances that you have which we've become spoiled with it living in the presence of God our young people become spoiled they take it for granted that the presence of the Lord is here but don't you dare criticize that person in your heart when you don't know if they've heard the gospel can you say Amen we don't have a right to be selective with the love of God or with the message that we have we have to give it to everybody can you say that we can't come into this if you salute your brother not only why do you're not doing anything any different than the others do not even the publicans and then his next script next thing he says is be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect it's the next scripture so he's talking about partiality he's talking about you you religious people are are kind of really the same and that's why I'm talking about distinctions we think we're we make ourselves so different but why are we different are we different because we dress different that's not the whole picture are we different because uh you know because of uh uh believing the prophet well you know now that's not all of our distinction so Jesus is trying to if you're in character acting like them and that that's the way the publicans function and really that's the way being there for perfect even is your father which is in heaven is perfect in other words we're moving out of that that selective love we're moving out of that partiality we're moving out of that that thing that is a respecter of persons if that's working amongst the kingdom of God and the people of God then it's not the maturity of divine love yet what do ye more than others how are you different than denominations when we say we have the only way when we say we have the only way now there's no other way through than through our way how are we any different than a denomination the word is the way the word is the only way but when we get selected to say you only have to come through our group it's not because of our group or our movement it's because the word can you say it the word is the only Christ is the only way don't forget that but when we say you have to come through our church doors or through our Doctrine to be saved how are we any different than the denominations when we have competition amongst ministers how are we any different than anyone else and talking about amongst the ministers who has the premium ministry that's what I heard recently is that there's a discussion about who the premium Ministry is in the message and I'm not leaving all Minister I'm just saying that some of the that's some of the terms that are used who has the greatest gift who's the next up and coming gift who's the next up and coming Church I am so weary of all this and you know why I am because I'm looking into the face of Christ and I don't see any of that there I don't see any of it there it's too denominational competition and and who's this and who's that and who's the next up-and-coming Church Jesus is saying when we do all this just as the rest of them then there's no distinction thus there's not moving into the fathers we're not moving into the father's Perfection what we wear or what we teach or the sign on the door or the fellowship that we have if that's the only distinctions that sets us apart something's wrong those are all part of it but when that becomes the distinction of what makes us different Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples by your love one for another he made the distinction not by what we wear not by we have a different teaching okay not by that but the distinction will come to down to the word of God and divine love the word preached untainted the word preached unveiled to the people how many enjoyed last weekend to just hear the message preach untainted pure can you say Amen no agendas to it I so appreciate that about brother Craig it was just so wonderful and we're we're blessed we ought to say Thank You Lord that I can enjoy that thank you Lord that I can enjoy preaching like that and so what we wear or what we teach or the sign on the door is not our distinction Satan's no respecter of the sign on the church God is no respecter of the sign on the church so it's love for one another that's the difference we would tend to praise the gifts and the success based on other things and when you do it becomes about you or your church then it's no longer about him it's about your church and it's about you when that is present no matter what church or preacher says it including me when that is presented that way our vision of Christ is becoming impaired it's still Limited it's seen through a glass Darkly a glass Darkly when we have God doing things through the seven Church ages and these pulses we see through a glass Darkly now showing gifts showing wisdom showing the supernatural praise God all the manifestations of God for seven Church ages but he says still we're still seeing Christ through a glass Darkly even though all these manifestations of God has happened and are still happening I praise God for it but we're still only seeing him through a glass Darkly seeing him through a cloudy glass at its very best and then because we can't completely see him we start to get off track to other things other than him be ye Perfect by the holy ghost moving into you that's what that means that growth to Perfection be ye perfect means by the Holy Ghost we move into something deeper than uh the denominational Creeds has to offer we are different brother Paul we have the seals we have the Mysteries but what if all the fruits that comes from it still has divisions of denomination have we reached the Perfection yet we have not moved to Perfection just because God has given us a perfect word we have not moved to Perfection just because God has blessed us with the perfect word but we have the right thing to look at we have the right Vision to look at we have the right vision of Christ to look at so that it can change us and that we can move into more Divine love can you say Amen we haven't reached Perfection because we have God has given us the perfect word by Divine Vindication he has given us that and I'm going to read that quote to you in a minute if I get to it we have that that perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication we're blessed with that but you see now just because we have that doesn't mean that we have moved to Perfection but we have praise God this morning we have the right thing to be looking at it if you look at the right thing and look at this vision of Christ God will change you from glory to glory we see through a glass Darkly and it's that means it's an imperfect view of Christ but when he starts removing the Veil uncovering The Book of Revelation means unveiling Revelation means unveiling he begins cleaning the glass whatever you want to call it when it's it's not just that we become greater intellectually when God does that than the rest of the churches when he starts unveiling it's to bring something deeper in our lives Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ in you the hope of glory and so when he unveils it's not just to make us smarter than everybody else it's not to give us more Pride but it's to bring more of the mystery of Christ in your own life manifested every day that's what he sends it for so you can see Christ clearly and when you see Christ clearly in Perfection then God can transform you in your life say well what's my problem brother Paul you're probably looking at other things more than you're looking into the word foreign and I say that as a as a conviction to my own life we are so busy we are so distracted we have so many responsibilities how much time is spent looking in the word of God because that's how we see this picture the word the message can you say Amen we see another portion of Christ how much are we given to do that because that's the thing Satan makes us Overlook it Satan makes it he puts uh he he taints the message he makes people afraid of the message and he does that for a reason because the power is looking into that character of Christ through the word and we catch something Satan does not want that to happen you become a Powerhouse for the kingdom of God so we might be looking at the wrong thing can I have an amen this morning it might be looking too much instead of into the message and into your Bible amen but when when he starts unveiling and uncovering it's more than just to make us a greater intellectual Church than the other churches then I will know him as he knows me this is the final thought in that Paul ends and I'm trying to make it a final thought too this is what he ends on is that I when I see him face to face then I will know him as he knows me I'm gonna elaborate on that in a minute this is the final thought Paul brings in this a full knowing a full knowing of Christ and Christ fully knowing you now that's a given that he knows us there's two main revelations in a Christian Life that a Christian that a Believer needs and uh these things are Beyond any gift or Beyond any knowledge Beyond physical healing by the atonement of Jesus Christ this is deeper and first of all we need a revelation that he knows us he knows me He Knows My Name I have a maker he knows he knows my every thought you say well why are you saying this because there are people that even intend church and they don't realize God knows you inside and out let me say it this way God does not have a partial revelation of you he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly even though there are some people that would like God to be looking at them through a glass Darkly because they can hide some things but God does not see you in your life and your past he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly he knows you 100 completely he knows what you've done and then the power of forgiveness that God forgive me I put that under your blood then he forgets that he can't remember it anymore boy that's the love of God praise God that's the love of God and when I talk about him knowing you then transfer it over us knowing him because when we have a face to face like he has a face and sees your whole life the love of God kicks in it must because he says if you'll repent and bring that Pastor under the blood I can't see that anymore that pass over can you say Amen talk about a complete picture of you he doesn't see you through a glass Darkly he sees you face to face he sees everything that you are amen so that's the first part in a Christian is coming to and you would like to be able to say that all of the Believers and everybody everybody sees how much God knows them but a lot of people think they still have a private life that they're hiding from God they're even in the message and they have a little secret thing that they do it's not healthy it's wearing out spiritually and but they're going to hold on to that because that's my little private world all the time thinking when nobody at the church sees it the pastor I'm really glad he don't see it and then you buy into this thing that God doesn't see it guess what I hate to be the messenger of bad news God sees everything he's seen what you looked at last night on your phone every detail he's an infinite God he knows all things from the end of the beginning he knows he sees it why does this need to be a revelation before the revelation of seeing Christ clearly because you need to know that God knows you and there's nothing that you can hide from God this morning in church and it gets a little bit more exposing when you're in church because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I'm preaching with that word this morning and that Holy Ghost is upon me and it could I don't know you but it could say anything right now that exactly pegs exactly what you're doing there was a mom that come to me and says thank you for two or three weeks ago so that when you talk to the young people and just give them a little warning about what they're looking at she said thank you she said because God dealt with me the Wednesday before of the same thing and her and her husband just the same thing and I said that's just the whole Holy Spirit not just speaking through the preachers but he's speaking through the mothers the fathers if we're in tune with him he's going to drop things in our hearts can you say Amen the word is a discerner he's not going to let things just happen under the current he's going to expose it when you come to church and I don't know if I like this going to church because it's too exposing yes because he's here and he knows you Paula Fontaine doesn't know you unless you share something but he knows every detail of your life this morning and yet and yet he has unlimited love for you he loves he knows you here's the song Gloria Gaither wrote the one who knows you the most loves you the most the one who knows me the most loves me the most that's a revelation knows everything and his love will never give up his love will never stop for you it doesn't give out can you say man it's not like us it's partial Revelation you know what I've dealt with this person 20 years they're still doing that I'm finished that's not the words of Christ not for a son of God not for a daughter of God you're bucking up and Rebellion all those years and you keep trying to question things and you'll never ever get away from the love of God you'll never get away from it you see when I talk about these things and how he looks at us I pray you're transferred over now that when we're really looking clearly at his face it should bring this Divine love that we look at we won't look at God or one another with a partial revelation but with the full picture that's what happened with the woman they'd found in adultery they threw her down using the law and say okay we found her this is it and then Jesus says let him that's without sin cast the first stone what's he doing the love of God is actually expanding their Vision because all they see is through a glass Darkly but Jesus is looking at the whole picture okay and that's why he can offer something else because he's looking at a predestinated daughter of God he's looking at the potential of what she can be because why he 100 there's no partial revelation of that woman down the ground they're ready to Stone God doesn't see a partial Revelation or they see a partial Revelation and they're judging her based upon her acts and they caught her in the act but you cannot have the Divine love of God and judged by a partial revelation of anybody else you must say God help me to understand and see the whole picture and let your love motivate me so we this Revelation which I may only get time on this this morning is the Revelation that God knows everything about you your ins and outs your ups and downs your life your story your your past your present your personality talking about this with the brothers a little bit on Thursday nights you know Satan God knows you completely he knows how you take he knows your bench he knows your weaknesses but Satan has studied you and how you tick how to tempt you so both of these have the had long studies in you and I tell the brothers but you won't take the time to study it as much as Satan does you won't figure out you and your weaknesses and how Satan can get you how your mind works praise the Lord so he knows you this morning and he knows everything about you and he you can't hide that from him you think you're hiding it on your phone you think you're hiding it in private you think you're hiding on your computer but I'm here to tell you you're not hiding anything from him he sees every detail of your life that's why he probably said he's grieved sometimes even with a brother sister with the Holy Ghost he just gets grieved from the season he's his love is never going to end but his spirit is grieved grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption Paul teaching that shows us that we as Holy Ghost Christians can grieve the Holy Spirit doesn't mean he doesn't love us doesn't mean he's giving up on us but he just he just just he's grieved by what you're looking at the reason you do it the reason I anybody would do it is because you feel like there's certain places rooms quietness dirty little secrets there's certain things that are not under the visibility of God and that such a lie he sees it all and he's and he he's already has a plan and a word in place for your life you're going to keep going down that road you're my son I have a plan already for you and you can buck up against it you can resist it but if you're a son you'll come hard you come easy I've said this for Years brother Mark probably back in my church years ago remember if you're a son daughter God you either come hard or you come easy but you're coming because all the father hath given me will come what does that Force demanding No Love unconditional love that's what it is so he knows every detail of your life maybe that'll help somebody live different this week in their privacy can't hide it from God he knows you inside and out and yet yet when he looks at our lives and sees our weaknesses and sees our mistakes he would give up except for he sees the whole thing which means he seemed a predestinated seed of God oh if we could all look at one another that way if we could all have that kind of divine looking but he sees and I'm so glad he's seen me that way beauty is in the eyes of beholder and he sees me for who I really am and so his love now looks at me and there's not anything I can hide let me finish that this part with this and we become very aware of it when God used a prophet with a prophetic gift to to discern secrets in people's hearts visibly the word can do it but with the prophet it's more vocal on the platform through the prayer lines and all of a sudden everybody realized oh you say well I wish those days can come back he's here to still hear the Holy Spirit but if you'd have been in brother bradham's meetings then you gotta you got a real taste of being in an atmosphere where at any moment God could show that profit of vision and show you in a doctor's office 10 years ago and describe it perfectly with the sign on the door and what the doctor said to you he knows all things or he could tell you what you looked at or what you've seen last night and being in that present everybody realizes we're not in the presence of Paul LaFontaine we're not in the presence of William Branham there's no man William Branham even that could do that on his own God worked him to show us the bride this revelation God knows your house number God knows your life God know which who knows what you did last night God knows what you did two weeks ago God knows you're text what you tell God knows it all and we got this jolting said oh God I can't hide anything from you I'm an open book I'm laid bare before you Lord and and it should bring a surrender to say if somebody knows me that well and still loves me then I'm going to give my life to someone like that is this okay with everybody so the Revelation that he knows us he knows us and yet he loves us yet there's something reaching out in his heart to to look at us with the whole picture of a predestinated son and daughter of God and so now there's the two knowings that in a Christian Life is number one and when the son of man was manifested this day showing he showed us he knows everything about us knows our house number knows where we live He Knows My Name he knows my every thought I have a maker can you say amen he knows my name he knows my heart he knows my every thought praise the lord it's not just a song friends it's a revelation he knows what you went through this week he knows the test from the doctor sister Angie I guess the tests come back clear right for what she had a scare there what those tests would be and they're completely clear Hallelujah we rejoice in the Lord and we we're not afraid young people you listen I'm not afraid of a God who knows everything about me because why because I know his love will get me out of my habits and all out of my addictions and out of my and give me the Holy Ghost give me what I need his love will draw me into what I need I can trust a God Like That used to be scared and hide it and everything else no I'm not afraid to let him come and just Peg Me perfectly this morning let him speak exactly what I'm doing and sometimes he does it through the body of Christ because his gifts work in the body is to keep the church clean you have somebody come to you say I just in humbly humble brother sister say I just want to share some of you I had a dream I had this and not all dreams are true but I'm just sharing we should be open to people doing that because in the body of Christ he'll keep the church clean I've seen this something happen in your life is this true you better own up to it sometimes it's not through someone sometimes something just gets exposed and it's embarrassing but you know what in the long run he knows us and he loves us anyway you know it's nothing if others know us except it's embarrassing sometimes but when he knows us and he unveils us the word is a discerner praise the lord well that's I think I I think I covered that but then the second thing is the most important and that's we see him clearly we know him clearly without a dark glass we see him face to face not just the gifts that he does not just the knowledge of him not just that he can perform Miracles not just the signs of God it's all him but I'm not talking about just that this morning not just the gifts and the knowledge him but the person of him and all that he is and we're coming to a perfect clarity of ourselves and of him this face to face that Paul mentions this face to face in First Corinthians this prophecy that the church will move from a glass Darkly Through the Ages to at the end time coming face to face with Jesus Christ we we think quickly uh when we think of face to face we would interpret that right away as being physically seeing Jesus face to face right and it's okay I mean it says when we see him face to face then we'll be known uh we will know him as he knows us and we look at that as being the day when we physically see the physical Jesus 2000 years ago that lived on the earth for uh 33 and a half years when we see him someday so they put it off to the Future when I see his physical characteristics face to face someday uh then I'll be known and then I'll come to this excellent way then I'll come to Divine love but he's prophesying and so it must not mean face to face physically and I want to illustrate this just a little bit from even the children the youngest child can understand if you're a stranger to me this morning to me and I walk up to you and it's the first time you met me Dana pretend that's the first time you met me all right Dan and actually Dana knows me I should choose somebody else because you know me too well to be in the church this many years um anyway pretend you're a stranger if it's the first time that we met and I come in front of Dana like this and we're seeing each other face to face he sees my physical characteristics but if he's a stranger he doesn't know me at all yes he doesn't know me he only knows my career so face to face must mean more than just a physical face to face with Jesus you see so he doesn't know me at all he doesn't know uh what I do he doesn't know some of my uh enjoyments some of my hobbies I don't have that many he doesn't know my friends and I don't have many of those either you know he doesn't know a clue about me how I I'm this way and that way and I like this certainly because we're all different different people like different things you you don't you even you know this you don't know that I like peanut M M's did you know that okay so that's part of me that's part of who I am I like being MNS I I eat a lot less of them today than I ate when I was a teenager but every once in a while at the airport I grab them don't tell my wife but I like pnms and it takes about 50 seconds to suck on one to get to the peanut how many say you raise your hand said I didn't know that about you brother Paul and I'm your pastor see but that's part of my life it's part of me and if I can get around it they will always be a part of my life Pete and Eminem's not the regular M M's there's nothing to those the peanut ones but you didn't know that and so now there's there's a ton to know about me so if I'm around Dana he doesn't know any of that he doesn't know so he really doesn't know me even though he's looking at me face to face and so then as I if he stays here for a half hour he sees the way I move my arms and the way I my my dumb little jokes that I tell and you know corny jokes and then he sees the way I do this and and you know he didn't know I was a preacher so now he sees me preaching so there's one thing about he's a minister and then he moves his hands this way and he yells and then he gets quieted and so then as he watches me he gets some of the characteristics from my body of who I am okay so that's a little bit more learning you see that that says a little bit about his personality you know and and then he'd get come home with me and say he gets a little angry at this sometimes and he and you just start to learn how come your face turned that way brother Paul I've never seen that of course you've never seen him how come your face turned that way well it's something that really irritated me and so my face changes I know none of you ever do that that's just me that's just me but you know as he watches me he can do that but you guess guess what there's deeper levels of me that he still hasn't seen right he doesn't really know me yet because he seems how I've you know moved my arms around and you know he doesn't really know me yet because because he doesn't know my heart and he doesn't know my thoughts so he doesn't really know me because he might know me now physically and see all that I do in my personality I told him about my peanuts all things but he doesn't know my thoughts he doesn't know my heart and so it would take quite a while for him to listen to me and to hear me because I'm gonna there's gonna be a place that I'm gonna reveal my heart and my my thoughts and that's from my words and the more that I talk the more something gets trans gets transmitted from my mind and my thoughts and from my heart that's going to come through my words and that's why Jesus said my words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life how important is the word of God it's so important that you feed on the word of God and you hear the voice of God and hear him talk because he Reveals His heart and his mind through his word this message revealed the heart and the thoughts of God can you say Amen it brought us back to Bible Faith the Bible reels reveals the mystery of God revealed throughout the ages that Bible he said if you don't find Christ in every scripture go back and read it again it's not a story it's not just history can you say man but it's revealing the very thoughts of God and when a prophet comes and reminds us of that Bible and brings us back it's not just some two-bit preacher that's preaching a sermon through prophets he and he brings the very this is what brother man called it in Christ the mystery he reaches back into the back part of God's mind somebody say praise the Lord we're talking the back part of God's thoughts revealed through this message why do you have to say so much to the women about how they dress because do you want to know the thoughts of God how to dress or do you want the Kardashians so anybody's interested in the thoughts of God and the back part of his mind and what he thought of you before the foundation and all of this would have to say I'm gonna have to quit listening to those voices and feed on the word of God because through that it's not a duty just to read my Bible I know I had a sister tell me I know I need to read my Bible I know I need to come to church I know I need to do those things and I might as well to ask but but is it where's where's the I want to whereas I want to because you don't if if you don't see what it is I need to go to church I have to go to church but and I that's that's why I said yeah I come because of who's there not because of the building who's there so this is the way that this face to face with Christ is knowing him in a way the bride the people of God have never known him before but it's revealing his thoughts his heart and I can't preach this as as well as brother Craig did last Sunday morning the heart of God the heart of God and the commission to the church you can't run the commission of God cast out Devils all that you can't write it unless you've caught the heart of God the love of God amen and God through the beginning so opening up the Seven Seals and the Book of redemption broke open to this this perfect interpretation of the Lord what did he break open to us God is sharing his heart with the bride of Christ God is sharing his mind God is sharing his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world you can't hide anything from him and he is not hiding anything anymore from you this is what it means by face to face the thing is Dan as he learns this more about me through the years he's proved he still loves me don't you okay so I know he has the love of Christ because as he begins to learn anything maybe he doesn't understand why did he do this why did you make this decision that's fine you know you're going to have that come in your mind but because he knows my heart and he's watched over the years my motives and my con my just that part of Christ in me that's my full motive for preaching and everything he's a trustee in this church he's watched me for 25 20. whatever almost 30 years with us here and he's watched me so he looks at me deeper my motives and things than just the outside mistakes that's the love of Christ and Dana it's not a partial thing but it's becoming clearer clearer what the picture of Christ is and so now when we look about and I'm going to try to find a place to end this and pick it up maybe Wednesday night now we look at this face how many want to look into the face of Christ just three of us all right it's a good question how many want to look into the very face of Christ and then the extra promise is that as we keep our eyes fixed on his word which reveals the right face of Christ and his thoughts and his heart as we look into it we are transformed and we are changed from glory to glory to glory it's an extra benefit because you're not just looking to say I see more of Christ it's changing you it's changing you so now it's not speaking physically it is speaking and friends I let me say something about seeing Jesus physically nobody really knows what he looks like completely physically but I'll know him I believe when I get there and that face to face I'm going to love that too you know why because he is only one person and this person that has guided me that has leaded me that's convicted me to an altar when I'm wrong that has loved me that has shown me so many Revelations this person that's been with me and in me all these years I know his characteristics I know all those things and it's going to be a joy to meet the person physically can you say Amen it will be worth it all when we see Jesus life's trials will seem so small when I meet the friend and my brother and I will Embrace him because he's not just my king he's my savior he's not just my savior he's my Lord he has become my teacher my counselor I his word I love his word I love everything about him there's no resistance to anything he says anymore and like I'm saying that honestly I have such trust in this word that's been revealed through the message in the Bible I trust Christ if he said it I'm embracing it I'll Trust it even when I don't understand it because I love him I love his word people say do you love me I love the oh they love the Lord but do they love his word because he can't be separated from her I love every part of it but you see now when I meet him someday I will have a joy in that too because I'll meet the one that has been so close to me invisible I'll get to meet him but people preached us as to face to face it's like there's some people who want to see that someday but they don't want his word they don't want who he is they don't want him to talk you're not going to go your whole life and say shh don't talk don't talk I don't want to hear that this doesn't have a voice of God Jesus don't talk Jesus I want Jesus when I get in trouble but I don't want him to talk to me what you don't really want to know him then it's my granddaughter you know we're all in the living room talking and she's got this thing we're all talking with another but we're not talking to her so she said she comes out stop talking stop talking stop talking everybody stop talking and then we all stop and then she really don't have nothing to say she just wants everybody to quit talking because the attention is not on her stop talking stop talking so we'll respected and then what do you want to say she just likes everybody looking at her I guess some people are that way with Jesus they don't want him to talk they wanted Jesus they want a modern Jesus they want a Jesus of their own imagination don't tell me the church hasn't come up with their new Jesus he's the Jesus of rock and roll that's in tattoos and everything up in the platform because that's the Jesus people want never preach against sin they've created their own Jesus of their own imagination I want the Jesus of the Bible because I know he truly loves me but you know they create their own thing and I I want to hug him and that day I can't wait to hug Jesus you know and Jesus said there will be ones that do many wonderful miracles in my name casting out devils but he said I never knew them they didn't know me so when they get there say but we've cast out devils in your name let me give you a hug you know let's have a hug bring it in Jesus group hug with all the saints but you didn't want to hear them talk when you're on Earth you resisted his word you resisted his invitation to give a full surrender to God if they want a hug at the end Judas wanted to kiss him it's called the Betrayal kiss I've experienced some of that when people are so cordial so friendly but they're betraying you they're betraying this word and he said hug up give you a big hug you know and but it's it's a Jesus was kissed and he knew all along Jesus what he was doing he physically wanted it because he felt guilty already he physically wanted to get around Jesus and give him one last kiss and just show a little Brotherhood there and just sold him for 30 pieces of silver you don't know him if you just know him physically or want to know him physically we know him by a face-to-face relationship through this word and then when you start to know him you say I want him I want to know him I want him to reveal my life I want him to reveal himself to me I want to know more of him can you say Amen I'm not afraid of him I want to know him more can you say Amen God does not have a glass dark vision of me a glass Darkly of me he sees it all we cannot stay with a partial vision of Christ or others when our looking is limited or partial of him partial revelation if it's a partial revelation of him it's a partial love if our vision is limited of him or we have partial Revelation even of the word it will limit how much love this works in US Paul ties it together I didn't Paul ties it together a face-to-face knowing him brings this excellent way in this Divine love out in US it breaks open the way for it we cannot ignore a face-to-face relationship with Christ the word and come to this Divine love and I know I've asked this before I want it more than anything else in my life I want to be functioning every day by Divine love I want a victory in Divine love that's the climax of this message friends that's the revival can you say man that is the Revival of the final Revival for the bride a partial revelation will make you partial to people First Timothy 5 19 says against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses First Timothy 5 20 them that sick sin rebuked before All That Others May fear I charged thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one another before preferring one another doing nothing by partiality James 2 and verse 2 he brings it up again I'm just using two scriptures that talk about we don't do anything with partiality we can't have partiality amongst us we can't do that God doesn't look at us that way we can't look at one another that way James two and two my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons for if they're coming to your assembly a man with a gold ring a good new apparel and they're coming also a poor man and vowel raiment and ye have respect to him that we're at the gay clothing and say to them hey sit down sit down sit down here in a good place and say to the poor stand now here sit under my footstool are you not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts this partiality of Love selective love is not to be in the kingdom of God Among Us and one thing that dissolves it from our hearts it's to see Jesus and to know him face to face I want a relationship of face-to-face some of you teenagers at a place it's not about Mom and Dad anymore it's you deciding I want to face I'm not afraid of a face-to-face relationship with Jesus Christ I'm going to get in the word I want to see him and then it needs to change I can't change things I can't seem to do this I can't seem to get over this habit and the brother Ram said that he says you try to quit smoking you go credit drinking you try to quit these habits he said just get in Christ and it's all gone how can you make it make it that simple they need to come through a 10-step program that's what the world says but I'm preaching to you if they're really seeing Christ face to face that habit just washes away maybe not quickly but some with quickly but I'll tell you you stay in his face and behold him there's no way you can hang on to that it just goes because why you're enjoying more your walk with the Lord and your fellowship with him than any entertainment of the world can you say Amen oh Lord I want to know you more this how may you raise your hand and say there's more to say here this morning but I think that's it oh I want to know you more deep within my so I want to know tell them this morning oh I want to know to feel your heart and know your mind looking in your eyes stirs up within me cries that say I want to know you you oh I want to know you can we stand and raise our hands and tell the lord it's not that I have to see you singing it or it's you have to tell the Lord

right there at your seat or come forward you want this face-to-face relationship with Christ through the word of God I no longer want to look through a glass Darkly and just see portions of what he does and rejoice in it but I want this walk with him that's face to face that the love of God just raise your hands out I want the love of God to be the motive of my heart I want Divine love I want
