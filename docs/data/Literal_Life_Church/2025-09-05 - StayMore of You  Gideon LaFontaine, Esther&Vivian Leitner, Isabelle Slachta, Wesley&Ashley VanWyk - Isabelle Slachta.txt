========================================

[Music] I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord. And I know what time it is because time stood still and bodies were healed and families restored. Because we stayed here in the presence of the Lord. [Music] Didn't have to say a word. [Music] Couldn't even make a sound. [Music] But I'd give up everything for this treasure I found. [Music] I never wanted to win, so I stay. [Music] I don't want you to go [Music] cuz my heart is burning [Music] in your presence alone. [Music] Please stay. [Music] I don't want you to go [Music] cuz my heart is burning in your presence. Lord, [Music] I want more. [Music] I want more. I want more. Jesus. I want more. I want more. I want more. I want more. [Music] I want more. Jesus. I want more. I want more. [Music] I want more. I want more. Jesus, I want more. [Music] And so I'll stay. Where else would I go? Cuz my heart is burning. &gt;&gt; Yes, my heart is burning. [Music] My heart is burning. [Music] My heart is I want your presence. I want [Music] I want more. Jesus, I want more. [Music] More of you. Oh, more of you. [Music] I've had it all. But what I need is more of you. of things I've had my fail. But yet I hunger still empty and Lord hear my prayer for more of you. I want more. I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] Jesus. I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] Jesus. I want more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise God.
