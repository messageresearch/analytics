No One Ever Cared for Me Like Jesus

Verse 1:
If my heart could tell a story
If my life would sing a song
If I have a testimony
If I have anything at all

Chorus:
No one ever cared for me like Jesus
His faithful hand has held me all this way
And when I'm old and grey
And all my days are numbered on the earth
Let it be known in you alone
My joy was found
Oh my joy, my joy

Verse 2:
Let my children tell their children
Let this be their memory
That all my treasure was in heaven
And you were everything to me

Bridge:
I'm still in love
Your still enough for me
Still all I want
Your still my everything
I'm still in love
Your still enough for me
Still all I want
Your still my everything

Written by Jason Ingram, Chandler Moore, Steffany Dawn Gretzinger, and Dante Bowe
