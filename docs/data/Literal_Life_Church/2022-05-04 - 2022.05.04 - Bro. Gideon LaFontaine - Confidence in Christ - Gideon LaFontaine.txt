TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um psalms 27 1-5 we'll read those pretty familiar uh verses to us um just um as far as it being a rapture scripture but it's a fitting fitting a time that tonight that we actually did a song for brother hildebrand tonight can you guys hear me okay okay good good amen someone say praise the lord somebody say glory to god hallelujah thank you lord amen that's what i like to hear if you just pull tonight amen i believe god will do god will help you out tonight he'll give you a word of encouragement so you just pull and uh we'll see where god leads us tonight amen praise the lord psalms 27 what i was just going to say what a fitting time to sing a song about brother hildebrand tonight i want to talk about the confidence in christ we have in him so uh just thinking about brother hildebrandt and some of the some of the ministers and some of the men we can look at in our lives i know my grandpa and brother lonnie jenkins we have soldiers that we can look at and say wow they were confident in what they were doing what the work they had and who christ was amen amen we can always look at those people and we say wow how did they get there i feel like i'm just always in the shaky ground all the time but then you've got these men that are just so steadfast in what they're doing amen it's just i want to be there amen i want to be where they they got amen i want to i want to be there amen we have it's great to have those role models in our life do you believe that amen praise god amen let's read the scripture tonight and i hope i'm in the right right place here okay good see i'm in proverbs you got to me in psalms amen psalms 27 all right here we go the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is my strength the strength of my life and whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foe shall even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and whole should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the worst should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temples for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon the rock hallelujah amen let's just let's just uh let's just have our seats tonight and we can get right into the word hallelujah i mean tonight i want to talk about the confidence um i guess this just struck me um probably a couple weeks ago um i guess you you see uh like like what i'm talking about you see uh the overcomers in the past you see uh people in your life um your parents probably that you can say my i just i want to be that amen you just have something about it's not it's not you want to be that person but you want what they've got amen amen so you want that confidence that they got so confidence um just looked up some definitions here uh the feeling or belief that one can own one can rely on someone or something a firm trust in the hebrew it means security confidence safety defense assurance those are some of the words that we come come to when we find this word confidence amen so then when we look i mean we look at ourselves we can look at we can look all around us and see this confidence that we can look at the animal kingdom actually it's pretty exciting if you just look around you can see the animal kingdom and how they have a certain thing called instincts you know what instincts are they have something in them that they were they were born with they didn't they couldn't change it about them but it helps them survive it gets things in line for them so they know what to do one example would be the simple duck you've got a duck pond up in canada and you see them up there you see this male duck come and he uh all he's got to do is come in the middle of the pond and go honk honk honk that's all he's got to do he's got a honk and all those birds come right there it's that instinct they hear that they come right there and then right all of a sudden he says honk honk honk it's almost like we're honking our horn but he goes on to fly in and they head down south for the winter they they skip the cold i mean it's something about it it's instincts they've got it you got the bird to fly who teaches a bird to fly it's instincts right right do you believe there's such a thing as instincts amen hallelujah praise the lord then we've got beavers they they create a dam in the pond they build their home their security against all the evils that are coming attacking their families they've got things set in stone just inside of them that they've they've got and it's it just comes out out of out of nature amen praise the lord um they react to certain situations by nature to thrive in this world amen if they had if they didn't have it they could not survive animals have confidence in the leader amen just like just like a deer um just like a mother deer you see them you see the little little deers following them just it's just nature to follow amen they they know they know they have trust in their mama amen praise the lord and then you've got babies ourselves i mean we're dependent on the mother amen there's certain natures we have to just to just just take take our mothers and just depend on them completely i mean we don't have that i mean there's something in us that we just do we have the nature i mean we just breathe amen i mean we take that one breath of life just like it's just and then we we start getting it right right off the bat amen praise the lord so so that's what i come you know to the human and where where we are in this whole thing god gave them instincts but he gave us the holy ghost he gave them instincts but us the holy ghost if animals can't survive without instincts they can't find food they can't do what they need to do then christians are going to have a hard time to survive and thrive without that holy ghost you believe that tonight we need it we need it more than anything before in this day we need that holy spirit amen that token hallelujah praise the lord and i'm going to take just a little time tonight uh teaching from uh i don't know if it's teaching but whatever it is i don't even know what i do up here just bear with me um but we'll uh we'll go ahead tonight and uh we'll go from the sermon why are people so tossed about this sermon speaks to me so much i can listen to this one so much and so much and i get so much more out of it every every single time i listen to it um you know he starts off you know kind of getting the testimony where he where he kind of sees people and where they are at and he just sees people on the edge all the time they have such a such a such a um just a discomfort in their in their in their lives where one little thing can happen and it's it's just devastation in their lives there's no confidence within them at all then you've got this other side of people that you have this i mean whatever is going on in their lives they could have loved ones die they could have things going on but they're sure they're walking firm nothing nothing is affecting them nothing's keeping them out of the presence of god they'll be in there all the time amen amen it doesn't keep them away from what god's purpose is in their life they just keep on moving on praise the lord amen so i he he brings out these two distinctions he's first he says two types of christians but then he says but no they're actually two phases so there's these phases too first it's intellectual faith you've got first the intellectual faith where these people obviously they're not they're not really they're not really firm they don't have something settled within them amen they don't have something settled then you have the one i'm not i guess i can say the true experience of the lord the true heart experience the other side of this where there's two that next phase the next phase i love that word how it says the phase but um it's the heart experience where you have that experience with god and it changes you forever amen it's an eternal experience amen hallelujah so the human looking back at the old testament um i want to go through the tabernacle kind of just just going through it hopefully you can you know follow along tonight i'm sure a lot of you know that with the tabernacle and with the you know outer core inner court and everything the holy's of holies but i'd like to go through them and just kind of just lay it all out there and i i ask you to you know pull on it because it's uh it is good stuff just to see where you are in your spiritual walk amen see where see where god's uh is exposing you and where your faults are and and uh maybe tonight we can build some confidence through him amen hallelujah thank you lord so first we have this uh first we have the man of falling amen the man is falling all the time right man is falling we have we can bring it into the church here we can bring it in we have people in the church we have souls in the church man is falling preaches preaching he's coming through through the services all the time good preaching i'd say so myself amen do you believe that do you feel like we have a good good good preaching going on around here hallelujah thank you lord that's what we need but we have this uh man is falling we have this outer court though and um there's a there's a this is our flesh if you could type it with the human there's a flesh there's the outer court to this tabernacle and you have your outer senses and that's a lot where these people are at when they haven't really had a deeper walk in their life they're at this they're at the state of the outer court where the light is they're they're affected by everything going on around them it's it's not this it's not this focused life it's it's everything going on around them they're affected by gloomy days they're affected by people talking about them they're affected by by people people may be talking behind their backs they they they get so affected by what people may call them or maybe i i've i've noticed sometimes even in my life where i'll you know we can we can get so disappointed in what the weather will be like amen and it just consumes us and we just get a man brother and we just we get so we get so down because it's raining today wow i'm not going to say any much anything about that but it just in if you put it in perspective this should not be affecting of where we are with god amen hallelujah praise god so you have taste feel smell sound look oh my goodness this cake gross tastes terrible ruined my day i've heard people say that all the time it ruined my day something so simple in their lives and it ruined their day and it seems kind of humorous to us but we actually we we come to those times and we we do we fall into the flesh amen amen so this is a justified man as well he has gloomy days he walks based on his surroundings and that's that's a tough that's a tough place to be if you're walking based on your surroundings amen what's going on around you i mean i said it a few weeks ago but you've got that horse you know and you you've got blinders on them a horse you know you you if they got blinders they ain't seeing anything else they got one purpose they're going and they're doing what the master's saying amen that's where i want to be but if they don't they're they're going to find triggers amen amen so we got the next here here's a little quote from that so i i'll say that tonight as well i'm not saying brother branham says and why are people so tossed about i don't say them people are here in the tabernacle i don't say that they're here you know tonight i'm not saying that but but i say there is there's things that people would do and they get different at least little thing will bring that old temper back again that selfishness open up a year to gossip and do nothing and do something of that type that person has never entered into the into this pot in here here they're outside so that's that's what he's saying here he said they've they've come to a place where they they haven't moved on in their spiritual walk as far as just letting go and letting god take him into that inner court amen so we've got the inner court now and uh as i talk about you know the process coming into the holies of holies here but um i was you know i was kind of thinking back and even in kova times um kovit's starting off and i think we can all relate to it tonight but i remember uh we're watching the news quite a bit and i think some of us probably still do i've kind of left it alone i can't i get i get too too uh worked up in the mind about it but um the news and you know you're watching all the time you see kova's going on and oh my what's going on in this world what am i gonna do you have this fear you know build up and even i gotta apologize to my my grandma tonight but i remember her coming i'm coming to our house just visiting and she was just in the car i remember i couldn't even give her a hug because of that fear that they they had i i mean i i just couldn't believe you know after it was all passing gone i almost found myself in such a humble place i was like wow i can't even hug my my grandma because of what's around me amen amen so so for covid i mean a lot of ways god can send a worldwide disaster to expose where you are sometimes expose where you're going to stand amen amen so you go into the inner court you're seeking god you're going into the inner court and this is the spirit realm this is memory conscience imagination reason affection um this is a sanctified man also so you're seeking that you get this this sanctified you understand that um does all things right you're living a clean life before god you have seven cold golden uh candlesticks burning and giving light you have these candle sticks which actually is you have it burning with oil so it is a type of the holy holy spirit but at the same time those it's it's not it still has a potential to not last it has it still has a potential to go out it can smoke up and those have to be relit at times amen so there's still a time even with a sanctified life you're living right you've come under the subjection of of god's word and you've you've done that you've done the you've done the things that you feel you feel the the holy spirit leading you to do and um you uh you finally come to a place where um you start hearing god's word and it starts actually circumcising you cutting things out of your life and you've got that you've got that process coming god's process do you believe that's god's process bringing you through these amen these this inner court this this this outer core inner court amen it's god's process so we got to trust god's process amen we have confidence in god's process amen we can't put our we can't put our faith in anything else we got to trust where god has us in our lives and he's i love this i'll get to it here in a little bit but then we've got god's word exposing us and where we're actually out where there's not just this step of saint sanctification but there's another step of receiving the holy ghost amen there's another step in entering into that holies of holies amen god works god's word makes us know where we are the word i love this the word divides the spirit and the soul amen that's what what it does the word and i believe it's the word for your day too if you're not in that word for your day how is it gonna how is it gonna separate that amen get in the word people god get in the word amen praise the lord so we have the holies of holies this is this is my personal favorite the holies of holies this is the soul level this is where faith can abound amen do you believe that faith can abound amen it is faith and unbelief but with the holy spirit in there it's only faith amen praise god and this is when the when you enter in the holy place the whole world is shut out what what a place where we want to be where the whole world is shut out amen covert would happen family member would pass away sickness in the family everything just falling around you but when the anchor is in that veil when they anchor when you close that veil behind you and there's nothing else but you and jehovah jireh there's nothing nothing between you and god amen how many want to be there tonight hallelujah thank you lord but when your anchor is in the veil let everything around me fall and i will just keep walking as if nothing happened hallelujah that's what a confidence that's when we really get our true confidence is when we step into that holies of holies amen we step into that place where nothing can stop that light from diminishing amen hallelujah praise god we must have confidence in the holy spirit no human no human fear but as proverbs 14 26 says in in the fear of the lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge that's my place of refuge tonight that holies of holies amen hallelujah thank you lord full confidence they say it's that light in there brother lonnie jenkins said it like this and i love it how he how he put it but he said he said you know like a gas a gas fireplace in your house that never goes out it's always always going amen that's on a soul level i'm talking about a soul level amen that's unchanging it just keeps going amen that's affecting you from the inside out you believe that from the inside out thank you lord and then you see that i love this thank you lord the day at calvary the veil was torn from top to bottom see in the in the old testament in the old testament the priests could only come into that holies of holies but when that veil was torn on that day of calvary he gave access or we could enter into it aren't you glad tonight we have access we've got a right by the blood of jesus christ we have a right to that holies of holies where we're just completely shut out from all of the turmoil going into this world all the things going on we have a right into this alleluia through christ hallelujah thank you lord thank you god thank you lord now it's god knew that that was the only way to restore true fellowship back to believer where we can have true genuine fellowship between god and man amen it was lost but now we can it's restored by by by that blood true worship is found in that blood amen hallelujah found in christ i love this verse here philippians 1 4 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ you believe that tonight if he started that work in your life he will finish it amen you believe he started that work in your life amen however little it may be amen it's it's coming amen i love what brother ron spencer said there at the louisiana camp satan you can't stop this amen it's gonna come through amen his word said it i believe it that settles it hallelujah thank you lord god works from the inside out so in that firm foundation of revelation and when you're talking about confidence you have to talk about revelation as well amen we have peter saying with this something inside of him saying thou art the christ the son of the living god amen what was it was that revelation that confidence dropping in his heart you can speak it with full confidence thank you lord amen hallelujah that was something god given hallelujah now it goes from the soul level thank you lord jesus it goes from the soul level now it's affecting your spirit level amen that burning fire down there that's never going out it's affecting your soul level now it's affecting your spirit and now it's actually coming into your flesh amen and it's actually affecting you uh hallelujah you're the reflection amen of what's going on inside amen you believe that alleluia thank you lord it's working from the inside out amen your outside body is reflecting what was already in you before the foundation of the world amen him christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah and then i also want to talk a little bit about the personality sometimes we sometimes young people and i know i went through this myself but um and even still you know still in a process of you know sometimes you're just like who am i and how should i act what should i do amen and personality i believe this with all my heart personality is amplified when that soul is quickened amen when that soul is quickened by the word of god person your personality and what it's supposed to do it actually amplifies amen it comes to what god wants you to be amen you don't have to you don't have to worry what's going on around you and say oh i need to act this way i need to i need to do this in order to make this person happy and stuff like this you can have trust in what's inside of you and then you can have confidence in what is placed within you amen thank you lord amen we all we all know children have personalities god you know god gives children personalities i know i'm not going to talk about you but i'm going to talk about your mom but um she you know she as a mother you always you know kind of see how a children reacts and does certain things and they try to just say this is how he is that's how she is and that's that's how you know and uh that's how they react you know they know they've got it all figured out amen not really not to not to you know diminish your mom or you know make you feel bad but at the same time when when you're a new creature in christ amen you've got you've got a new name you're not a new name but your your real name now is being amplified amen your real self is being amplified amen hallelujah amen then the worldly view of praise praising self amen and people they do all these things online of all these what what who am i and all these tests on who how they can figure out who they are um to be honest it's it's uh it's not really the most accurate thing amen i mean you may be able to catch some things that you're like yeah i do kind of you know i could kind of see that and stuff but it's it's uh it's it's not it's not um it's not sure amen so uh even you know i mean this whole generation is a praise of self of self like it's uh it's humanism really it's um just basically you know your worship your abilities and what you can do and that that might that mental state you you can go far in life you can you can you can do so many good things but we know the truth that yet not i but through christ and me amen do you believe that amen we've got to knock those things aside amen those those worldly views we cannot keep that in our mind of the humanism thought of of uh wow i'm i'm proud that i could do that or i can do this it's all about it's all about me amen we have to shed that aside because it's not you're breathing because of him amen you're walking because of him amen you're seeing because of him hallelujah do you believe that tonight praise the lord amen we've got a that's we've got here the worldly um inc that's what i was going to say david said encourage yourself in the lord amen in the lord that's the key you encourage yourself and the lord praise god um also tonight i would like to i'm probably speeding through this i don't even know what time it is here uh we're doing okay i also i i hope you don't mind tonight but i i found something in uh this book called mere christianity i don't promote it at all but i found a few things in there that was really interesting as far as the personality um and um just what people kind of struggle with as far as coming into their walk with christ but it's cs lewis you guys are familiar with cs lewis he wrote he's a christian author but um obviously you know he has some catholic basis and just different things but at the same time there are some things he he taps into that are very uh they're very encouraging to me to find that our personalities and what we we come to do like i'm saying are are made known and um made i mean made good through christ amen so i'll just read a little bit of this listening closely because he was an englishman and his word you should is pretty crazy all right so listen closely the more we get what we know the more we get what we now call ourselves out of the way and let him take us over the more truly ourselves we become there is so much of him that millions and millions of little christ all different will still be too few to express him fully he made them all he he's the great inventor he invented and is that it as an author invents characters in a novel all the different men that you and i were intended to be in that sense our real selves are all waiting for us in him it is no good trying to be myself without him the more i resist him and try to live on my own the more i become dominated by my own heredity and upbringing and surroundings and natural desires in fact what i so proudly call myself becomes merely the meeting place for trains of events which i never start started in which i cannot stop but i call my wishes what i call my wishes become merely the desires thrown up by my physical organism or pumped into me by other man's thoughts or other or even suggested to me by devils i mean this is this is powerful stuff with what what that what that means as far as who who we are amen and coming into christ amen it is when i learn is when i turn to christ when i give myself up to his personality amen one god amen do you believe that amen that i first began to have a real personality of my own amen until you have given up yourself to him you will not have a real self sameness is to be found most among the most natural men not among those who surrender to christ how monotonously alike are the great tyrants and conquerors have been how gloriously different are the saints amen then we've got here amen where are we okay but there must be a real giving up of self amen you must throw it away blindly so to speak christ will indeed give you a real personality but you must not go to him for the sake of that as long as your own personality is what you are bothering about you are not going to him at all the first step is to try to forget about the self all together your real new self which is christ and your and yours yours just because and yours just because it's his will not come as long as you are looking for it it will come when you are looking for him amen i got a little bit more but i'll stop there i mean i think you can see the picture amen praise god he's talking about when i turn to christ when i give up and let go let let god have his way in my life that's when god can work from the inside out and actually i love it because god's a god of variety amen you don't have to be there's not one certain way how how you need to react to certain things god is a god of variety amen do you believe that praise the lord amen there is obviously we are we are made in his in his character his likeness but god's a god of variety amen do you believe that praise the lord he he loves his children each and every one are distinct amen praise the lord so just a few more quotes just about this and paul said paul said to me for me to live is christ and to die is gain not me that liveth any more but christ that liveth in me christ liveth in the individual so surrendered when christ speaks through the lips and thinks through the mind sees through the eye acts through the temperament then the things of the world pass away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's christ in you christ in you amen amen that's what we're seeking amen christ christ in us the hope of glory amen alleluia i mean we're not worried so much like like like c.s lewis is saying we're not so much worried about oh god i want my personality to come through and i want things to start happening in my life amen based on what i can do but it's christ in us that does the work amen trust in that have confidence in that not in your own ability not in what you can do with your own hands amen not with what you can do with your own voice but what christ can do through you amen have confidence in that alleluia our true confidence is rest our true confidence rest in the word amen do you believe that amen our true confidence does not come from man made ideas intellectual thinking it comes from the word of god amen amen seek that person seek the person of of god amen the spirit of the the spirit and the word are one a lot of times people get confused and what what is right and what is wrong all you've got to do i love this he puts it through a thinking man's filter amen give it the word test amen go back to the words see what's right and wrong for yourself amen i believe every believer should do that come to that place amen give it the word test amen see see if it see what's in your soul if that if if there's something in there that says no that's not right amen you trust that amen amen and it's by the word amen the man i don't get old in there only life it's in that holy place that shekinah glory amen it's then that that place where nothing gets old and actually life comes forth i said that aaron's rod actually just in a matter of time actually butted forth life amen in that holies of holies amen there's no death in there there's only life amen trust in that holy place amen if you're seeking that tonight amen i wouldn't be waiting amen if i would not be waiting and how and uh just uh have in your heart i'm okay i'll take a halfway experience no if you've got something in your heart that you want to keep going find that resting place find that haven where you can just rest in his word amen then he's got it for you you have a right amen hallelujah thank you lord i got a few more see what with their own interpretation they couldn't do nothing else because they leaned to what the church had told them what he he could he did rather than he would every time he comes and everything he does it'll be in the taste of the word so therefore we can't put confidence in what other people say there's only one thing that you can put your confidence in and that's the word and the word is god and the word anoints and the word anointed makes the messiah the anointed word of the hour how beautiful amen the word that's right the word always right but their interpretation of it is wrong amen amen that's why we can't come with man-made ideas even when approaching the throne of god we can't coming into church we can't come with our own agendas own ideas amen we have to come with that that in our mind amen we're coming for the word amen hallelujah thank you lord don't let the liar speak to you tonight amen satan satan is defeated that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with a defeated devil amen amen he has no hold of what god has placed in your life amen if there was a seed started and it's quickened it's going to come forth satan you cannot stop that hallelujah you have a right because of christ don't settle for this is what i was saying don't settle for a halfway inconsistent walk amen don't settle for that amen if there's a deep there's a deep to respond amen alleluia you have a right to enter that holy place shut out from the world completely in the things of the world amen that's the rapture amen do you believe that only all of this to say though oh it's only by his grace that we have this process amen amen we only by his grace we can we can come into this holy place amen and the things and we find our rest and we overcome amen thank you lord another few encouraging quotes along with us tonight before i close i know this was just a short simple message tonight but i wanted you to just realize just the confidence we have in christ amen we have in him amen that's what i just wanted to hit home tonight and just a few other things just read these real quick here if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything everything thinking about well i might fail it might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aside everything you open up the channel and say god your word is eternally true and it's for me amen that's the kind of confidence you need if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking your word that's the battle that's the thing amen take his word for full confidence believers take with full confidence alleluia the christian faith is based solidly upon rest amen i want to be there lord i want to be there that's right a christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian doesn't fuss and fume the worry about things a christian rest it's all over it's all finished for a believer at calvary aren't you glad tonight that's right oh sickness may come in disappointments but the christian is at rest knowing this that christ is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death there is neither starve there is neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that is in jesus christ we're at we're at rest just let the old ship toss any way she wants to the anchor holds hallelujah aren't you glad tonight
