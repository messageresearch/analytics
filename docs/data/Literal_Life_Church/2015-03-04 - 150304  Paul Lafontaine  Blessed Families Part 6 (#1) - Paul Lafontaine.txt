bless you and all who's come to the house of the Lord tonight on this Wednesday night and we're looking forward to Spring aren't we looking forward to Spring just around the corner it's getting close now amen well I want to speak on blessed F families again tonight this will be part six and we want to take the next place in the scripture that speaks of families in Joshua chapter 7 here and we're taking this really slow each place that it mentions this word families or I shouldn't say every place but uh each place that I feel led to just slow down and and comment on and and preach on that's what we're trying to do and we've garnered I believe some good things from it so Joshua chapter 7 and as we we read we'll just read one scripture and then we can comment on the the text uh and this is chapter 7 of course is when Joshua had discovered Joshua becomes very concerned because the 36 men had died in a battle and uh so his first question is what's wrong what's taking place be and the reason why he's asking that is that's not supposed to take place uh a Christian a believer in battle is supposed to be in Victory his battles are supposed all their battles are supposed to come to victories and uh we should be concerned when we don't have a VI victory that something's wrong and try to figure out what's wrong and that's what happened here after the it's the Second Battle within their promised land when they were going against AI 36 men died and so Joshua was going before the Lord and so then in in chapter 7 verse 14 we'll just read as they were trying to uh give give the instructions of how to trace this down in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the their families thereof and the family which the Lord uh shall take shall come by households and the household which the Lord shall take shall come Man by man as God just narrows it down there and brings it down to the families and we discovered that it was a family then one family in particular uh achen and his family that had taken a a Babylonian garment and a gold wedge uh some silver from uh uh the uh B last battle and when they did that of course that was the thing that brought this curse upon Israel where they couldn't come to this Victory let's have a word of prayer heavenly father it's good to be here tonight Lord and to lift our voices and hearts to you we pray father that as we just settle down now Lord in your presence we're thankful that we have this type of place to come to that we can be refreshed Lord there's not many places in this world we have this anymore but we're so thankful that we can come and I look forward to gathering with the Saints and opening the scriptures breaking bread together I look forward to this time to just just get a clean slate just just get refreshed Lord from all the pressures that we feel and we pray that you will do that Lord may this be a a refreshing drink of water lord for the Saints tonight those who are listening on the internet may it just be a time that we can leave here saying it's been good to be in the house of the Lord bless our families bless the series on the family Lord each family in the church just be blessed by it and learn of it the heads of the homes may we learn from the scriptures Lord what it means to be a blessed family we commit this service to you now and and all that will be said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen you may be seated tonight God bless you we sit had an encouraging thought I think last Wednesday night and look at these things looking at these things and seeing uh back when we were speaking of them coming into the promised land and I'm just going back just a little bit to because we we know in uh chapter we were going back into Moses bringing the laws and such and then in Deuteronomy when he speaks in chapter six of teaching him to his children we learned last Wednesday that there were three things there was Commandments there was statutes and there was judgments and all those mean different things but Moses message and Moses law that came from God had all of those elements within it Commandments and statues which were boundaries limits and boundaries and then judgments which was uh making judgment calls on something like in a court case and all of those things were part of Moses message and Deuteronomy 6 uh brought it as a mandate for parents that I want you to teach these things to your children um all of them Commandments the statutes the judgments I want you to continually teach these things that may they may know the in other words he wanted them to teach them talk about them when they got up talk about them when they went to bed have them upon the the post and everywhere around your house and keep the word in front of them because we have a tendency to forget don't we and so God wants us to keep the word before him because we tend to idolatry we tend to being attracted to fleshly things and the only way to combat that is to keep the word ever ever before us and he wanted them to keep the word before their children keep the statues keep the boundaries so they could re be reminded this is how we live as Believers this is what we do that's what they do but this is what we do and so I thought it was a wonderful thing to see that but it was more more wonderful to see that as they went into the promised land and Moses died the prophet died then Joshua was commissioned to take them into their inheritance and in the first few verses we find that he still wanted them to teach them to their children and he didn't want this law to depart from their hearts and their minds and so there would even though that the emphasis came unto the inheritance of the children of Israel that's why he took them out of Egypt he had a land for them the emphasis was the land the emphasis was their inheritance the emphasis is to go and take that it wasn't the law and yet they had there was some part the the law was so important that they couldn't go into the promised land and overcome without it because he says don't let this depart what Moses said keep it with you teach it to your children don't let it depart out of your mouth keep these principles intact because you're going to need them in the promised land you're going to need them as you come in your ha you're going to need them to overcome so as we follow it through if he gave that to families and heads of the homes to keep that uh word always before their children and to each generation then he kept it and continued it on scripture when they come into their Promised Land we would think that they maybe wouldn't need that anymore or not need it as much but he was uh so clear to say hey you don't let those things though continue to teach those to your children to your wives to your families because they are important now when we come to this story here of aen it mentions them breaking down to the tribes and the families to find out who had done this and who uh had uh disobeyed god um then we want to look at the some of the reason CU we realize that uh they took something that was cursed and they hid it in their tent they felt like a I don't know what achen was thinking as uh as a man uh the prophet mentions a couple places that he figured that they could use this garment and it would be something nice for them to wear and they could certainly use the money uh they figured maybe down the road he was thinking ahead so he was thinking probably very common sense and saying it won't be a big problem to take this and the the problem was not was not with the silver itself or the actual garment itself the problem is God had said this city uh Jericho has a curse on it and he said everything in it has a curse with it and so because God had already said that it wasn't necessarily the Garment as much as it what was the trouble that came with taking it or the curse that came with it and so we learn a very simple lesson that sometimes something can be innocent of itself but whatever it's attached to can carry a curse with it we have to be mature and learn that can you say Amen we have to we have to make choices as Christians sometimes not based upon the Flesh of course and not based upon big arguments uh and get into arguments whether it's right or it's wrong but uh we look at the long-term results and we look at something whether it has whether it brings trouble with it I've I we have done certain things and uh uh you I don't know an example right now but I can think of just my family and the and uh in just trying to raise a family um you try something and and and uh you realize after there's trouble that comes from it uh there's there's H problems that come with it and uh and and not not little trouble but it starts to be big trouble uh and and so you realize that sometimes in a lot of things you don't discover it till afterwards that there's trouble that comes with something there's there's there's a curse that comes with something so then you got to make a mature uh uh decision as a Christian now uh that that we we have to uh Purge things from our lives that are causing trouble that are uh thwarting the blessing from our lives Something's Happened something's changed something it's just it's just saying the same thing that Joshua said something's wrong and I don't know what it is but something's not right something's not like it was and I'm not in in in living in Victory like I was I'm not overcoming like I was listen we are here on this Earth to be Overcomers we are here to live Spirit-filled lives as Christians and so now anything that interrupts that progress is your enemy that's right amen that's right that's what we're here for we're not here to make money we're not here to uh serve the community if you do that I I do that you should do that it's fine but that's not our main purpose of being here we are to become Spirit-filled Christians full of the Holy Ghost growing to the image of Jesus Christ and going to a Rapture coming into adoption mature Christians that's what we're here for to live overcoming lives to be one of those in leoda that's called an overcomer and so anything that interrupts that process is our enemy yes amen and needs to be Lay Laid aside especially when it has something that brings trouble to having Victorious battles so there was something they took that had a curse with it and they took it and they hid it and there was trouble that came with it and they were affected in the victory in the next battle and uh and so I guess the question is does this apply today does this apply today does this principle of them doing taking something that's cursed bringing it into their home and put and hiding it and not telling anybody about it and all of a sudden now it affects the rest of the body it affects the Army it affects other believers it affects their own home it starts to affect things I am I'm asking you does that principle still apply today well I know it applies because I've lived it out I mean I can show you scriptures where it still applies today in the New Testament but but you see now I know it because I have lived out and how many can say I have you have lived it out as well just three or four of us all right well uh we appreciate the honesty in some hey I've been there done that every Christian should should have lived through that process of realizing you Incorporated something in your life and you had nothing but trouble with it and it didn't lead you closer to the Lord and you become more fleshly with it and so it might even be innocent but you became more fleshly and your priorities changed and you weren't into the word as much so let's not have a 10-day argument as far whether it's technically right and get me a quote for it and everything else is it hindering your Christian walk is it making you fleshly in carnal instead of Spirit-filled and that's your that's your decision that's where it's at the pastor doesn't come have to come and tell you that the Holy Ghost tells you that amen but I need a quote I got to see a quote well I'll try to find it for you but you need to be led by the holy spirit that whatever is interrupting your spirit filled life is your enemy that's your battle my friend praise the Lord so we have to look at life as a Christian this way we we we can't be childish and say I don't want that taken away from me and I I've always wanted to keep that and I'm keeping it no matter what anybody says we can't be babies that way we're not supposed to be babies we're supposed to be mature Sons and Daughters of God growing by Grace into a Spirit-filled life knowing what it means to be uh walking in the spirit knowing what it means to hear his voice and follow his voice every day for him to be leading our hearts can you say Amen instead quite often we're led by all kinds of other voices and we don't we we got to get where we're listening to that still Small Voice praise the Lord and so now uh we know that this from experience and we've seen these things and we know this principle does apply Li still today uh in 20 some years of pastoring we've seen it in the church as someone makes a choice to do something Church the holy spirit leaving the the congregation in a certain direction and somebody chooses no they're going to do something completely opposite of that you may not see the effects right away but I've watched it you start to see the effects you start to see the influence to the other young people or the other people in the church and you start to see they deteriorating spiritually and so I I this principle applies that if you take something and even hide it if it's not the right thing it will show up someday no doubt about it we're still human beings God still works the same way and this principle still works the same way as far as a body we are a body so what we do affects one another praise the Lord so we're going to have losses when we do that in the Old Testament it's it's real it's physical losses it's like people die in battle right but we know that as a whole thing is a type of a spiritual death that can take place within the church spiritual death will take place in families there's families that have spiritually died spiritually died they're not going on with Christ today because the message became a religion to them true right they Incorporated something that wasn't the core of what it really is and so they bring that in even a religious idea and add it to it and form something out of it and all of a sudden now you've got a babylonius garment there you've got reasoning there you got something added to it and eventually it brings death it brings death to somebody there's losses somewhere yes a lot of times in the children so now let's let's step back here and talk a little bit about curses and blessings because that's such a a subject that's uh in the Bible so much and so I wanted to talk a little bit about blessings and CH because we're preaching on blessed families right we want to be a blessed family and to be blessed of course is to to have Divine approval to have the favor of God we've talked about it being happy families blessed families to be blessed to be happy to be fortunate to be prosperous first of all spiritually and then even in other ways to be prosperous that's a blessed family of God and and to let me just say it this way if we're blessed in in other ways and natural things of Life The Blessing really is that we're content with what God gives us and we're pleased with what God gives us because you're not really blessed if you're discontent all the time with how much money you got so the blessing is that you live with contentment with what you have so that's a blessed family and and and that God has pleased with you and you're walking with the word doesn't mean you're perfect but you're walking with the word and you're you're that's what being under the blessings of God means and being blessed and we and God has certainly blessed us uh so much in the last days as a people now C the curse having a curse on our lives is the course the opposite of that it's the opposite of happy uh having the uh some cloud or curse come in your life uh doesn't bring happiness and it means the invoking of an evil or the invoking of trust trouble coming in your life and maybe the windows of Heaven were opened but now the windows of Heaven are closed it means to be afflicted by something it does not it does not mean that every time Trouble Comes it's a curse and I really have to clarify this because often we think a bit mature in this way is that if any trouble comes in our life we're under a curse there's a spell somebody cast on us right we can't say that because troubles are used to cause us to grow in the Lord God allows certain troubles to come to our lives so we can't technically say that every time we get in trouble we're under a curse but we can say sometimes we can bring God's displeasing in our lives and we can come underneath a cloud for a certain time and things aren't happy think things aren't peachy the family's not happy uh and things aren't the way they were you're just not blessed and and we must be careful not to attach God cursing us when troubles come but this this curse is an evil Affliction that takes over often often not from God but takes over by our own Disobedience or someone else's influence a curse can come on your life by your Disobedience or by somebody else's words or influence they can cast a spell on you a lot of times people they get depressed because somebody had said something about them maybe even years ago and they're living under the curse of what that person says they're living under that that what was said it might have been a parent years ago something was said and so that power of what they said is still hanging over that person and so it kind of puts a curse that puts this uh Affliction upon somebody and they live with that they live under that that cloud all the time so but we must remember it's not uh it's not God necessarily inflicting that as we might think I'll read this to you that the prophet said the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval Nei neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world see his love goes deeper than just if it's a sunshiny day oh God must really love us more today exactly right that's pretty immature or if it's or if it's like it's been a lot of the winter with a lot of snow and a lot of cold and some days are so dreary well God must not love us as much today that's very immature isn't it and so his love
