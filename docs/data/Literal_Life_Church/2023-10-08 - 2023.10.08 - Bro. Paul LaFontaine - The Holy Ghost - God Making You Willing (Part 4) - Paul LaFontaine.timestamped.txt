[28:54] a missions report also which will bring
[28:58] up and this from LA and it was by way of
[29:03] uh you know brother John went there
[29:07] brother Paul went there several weeks
[29:09] ago and the Brethren are just so on fire
[29:13] and so he sent just photos and so we
[29:15] won't I don't know a lot of explanation
[29:17] of the photos but you'll see a couple of
[29:20] uh of videos at the
[29:23] end and uh you can see how bad the roads
[29:27] I'm not sure if that video got included
[29:29] but they're so bad that you can't even
[29:32] get the motorcycles
[29:34] uphill go
[29:37] ahead and I guess I have it here
[29:39] actually we'll see so this is
[29:43] uh buun and a couple of the other
[29:46] brothers that are ministering you can
[29:47] see they're they're hiking out to areas
[29:51] to to
[29:52] minister there you go and this is in
[29:56] somebody's house where they're
[29:58] witnessing uh you can see there that you
[30:02] dirt
[30:03] floors and poverty compared to us y'all
[30:06] can y'all can be
[30:11] seated there
[30:13] again we have so much to be thankful
[30:16] for and the Brethren have uh 25 or 30
[30:21] books I suppose so they're Distributing
[30:23] those we have
[30:25] Bibles and that's a the need I expect it
[30:28] to be growing since we have more
[30:29] evangelists
[30:31] out there's one of the brothers
[30:34] witnessing to another another person in
[30:37] their
[30:40] home uh a small Church there that you
[30:43] has got Plank
[30:49] Floors same there you can see it's all
[30:51] very casual everybody's
[30:56] poor
[30:57] there's a sister there who I don't we
[31:00] didn't get the baptism photo but she's
[31:02] going to be
[31:06] baptized there's brother bojun on the
[31:09] left and we'll see another baptism photo
[31:13] that is a flowing river and the guy on
[31:16] the right is actually kind of a uh he's
[31:20] going to catch the person just in
[31:26] case there they are
[31:28] witnessing I think the only light was
[31:31] The
[31:35] Flash and
[31:37] brother Zing xong asked for a a color
[31:41] printer so he could print his covers in
[31:44] color to make the books much nicer so
[31:47] that's his color printer along with the
[31:49] ink and uh and the extra papers we got
[31:55] them and there's the brethren at their
[31:57] monthly meeting they do this every month
[32:00] and you've seen the the motorcyclist we
[32:02] send Three Brothers $50 a month and that
[32:06] pays for their gasoline expenses and we
[32:09] said brother chuku it's hard for me to
[32:13] remember the names and they have monthly
[32:15] meetings we send him $100 and that pays
[32:18] for really he helps with the gasoline
[32:20] expenses for the Brethren that come and
[32:23] they have teaching every month on the on
[32:26] the message as well as you know the
[32:28] restored
[32:31] word there they are at the same
[32:36] meetings
[32:39] baptism there you go same
[32:44] thing and this is we'll go to Malawi
[32:47] here we built four put four rofs on four
[32:51] churches in the past
[32:53] quarter and brother Alfred was pointing
[32:56] out that this church wasn't tall enough
[32:58] so he had him put another three rows on
[33:00] top so the roof is higher so the heat
[33:02] can escape
[33:05] better so there's malali
[33:08] Church your missions dollars at work and
[33:12] most of these churches in Malawi they're
[33:14] no longer allowing the churches to meet
[33:16] in schools and so this is forcing them
[33:20] out and they build the
[33:23] walls and this is kakomi church
[33:29] malap Pella
[33:32] church and block 11 Church number
[33:36] four so uh they are very very grateful
[33:40] because if they're not don't can't do in
[33:42] the school rooms they you know they they
[33:45] have their own church building so thank
[33:46] you very
[33:51] [Music]
[33:53] much is this the
[33:55] video okay so we're going to play this
[33:58] video
[34:01] here volume
[34:04] [Music]

[34:11] [Music]
[34:17] up there you
[34:23] go they're young so they they're having
[34:26] fun too I
[34:27] guess you see the jungles in each side I
[34:30] mean it's very poor roads next
[34:39] video okay play this
[34:43] [Music]
[34:46] one so you know he's spotting for her
[34:50] just in
[34:51] case I think that might be it
[34:55] amen that's it it amen okay that's
[34:59] fine and uh missionary update a couple
[35:02] of weeks ago and I didn't bring the
[35:04] didn't put it up on the PowerPoint but
[35:06] his church is growing and he's had a
[35:09] immigrants in the church who are working
[35:11] part-time in Israel sing money back and
[35:13] he's been teaching on the family how
[35:16] it's necessary for the fathers to be
[35:18] home with the family so he's had the
[35:21] immigrants leave and go back to be with
[35:23] their families which is a good thing
[35:25] which sounds counterproductive for them
[35:27] but for the church but for now it's
[35:29] almost all Israelis at his
[35:32] church and uh you he's he's been there
[35:35] six years and now he's ministering in
[35:38] Hebrew about 50% of the time uh two
[35:41] Services a week they've moved recently
[35:45] couple several months ago and their
[35:47] church is too small already so they need
[35:51] a bigger facility so these were just
[35:53] needs of brother
[35:54] Colin uh Hebrew trans translator to
[35:57] translate the books into
[36:00] Hebrew and he's been ministering two to
[36:03] three services a week for six years and
[36:06] he has three children under
[36:08] four and uh he could use some
[36:12] help so uh and he's right he has been
[36:17] teaching English which has worked out
[36:19] well but he'd like more flexibility so
[36:22] he can make his own schedule and
[36:24] Minister more and he's starting a new
[36:27] business uh I think it's real estate so
[36:30] just pray that the business will be
[36:32] successful the goal is to give him more
[36:34] freedom in his uh in his
[36:38] ministry so thank you so much for your
[36:41] prayers and each each of these videos
[36:43] and uh brother Colin is a result of your
[36:46] faithful giving and prayers God bless
[36:49] [Applause]
[36:55] you are we
[36:58] G
[37:01] support2 2200 a month okay so I'm going
[37:04] to piggyback off of brother Jim speaking
[37:06] about brother Colin because we've been
[37:07] keeping track of uh last night late and
[37:10] also this morning the conditions and
[37:12] Israel that changed in 24 the last 24
[37:15] hours and so we're we're actually how
[37:18] many's glad that brother Jim gives us a
[37:20] window into what we're doing here and I
[37:22] would just ask you you know so I don't
[37:24] forget to say it be mindful and
[37:26] prayerful of what we're doing as a
[37:28] church and be a part of it whether it's
[37:29] 20 bucks a month or you know 20,000 a
[37:32] month whatever but let's let's try to be
[37:34] prayerful what we can give to because
[37:36] God is blessing uh what we're doing and
[37:39] we like to look at what God is blessing
[37:41] so the few countries we're trying to
[37:42] support brother Jim is working and God
[37:44] has prospered at and You' like to stick
[37:46] with what God I excuse me for bringing
[37:49] my phone into the church we we're not
[37:50] supposed to do that but I just wanted to
[37:52] read right from his uh WhatsApp from
[37:55] last night in this morning so you have
[37:57] an idea he lives a little bit north of
[37:59] Tel Aviv and of course the the war has
[38:01] started now um they've declared war
[38:04] Israel has declared war officially the
[38:06] defense minister since the terrorist
[38:08] attacks uh yesterday yesterday morning
[38:11] and so the whole country now is in a bit
[38:13] of a lockdown and they're encouraging
[38:15] families I I have one text here that he
[38:18] they're having them stay in their homes
[38:19] to be safe with their children all over
[38:22] the country of Israel so everything's
[38:23] changed uh since this and this war will
[38:26] no out last a long time and so those who
[38:29] are spiritual and know the scripture we
[38:32] know that these things are to mount up
[38:34] uh Trump said yesterday not to quote
[38:37] Donald Trump but uh he said you know
[38:40] this is this is inevitable and he says
[38:42] it's just puts us one step closer to
[38:44] World War I well he's he's right because
[38:47] we know we're headed in that direction
[38:49] our Prophet said that he says the world
[38:52] cannot stand another birth pain before
[38:54] she gives birth to another another world
[38:58] and so but this is where it's mounting
[39:00] up to with with this war especially when
[39:03] you have the potential of what could
[39:04] happen in this particular area and we
[39:06] know scripturally that all that surround
[39:09] Israel will come against Israel and
[39:11] they're not just for they try to make
[39:13] peace and they say they make peace but
[39:14] their laws and their beliefs say the
[39:17] annihilation of Israel annihilation of
[39:20] Israel and I just want to say that I was
[39:23] burdened last night till late in contact
[39:25] with brother Colin and praying how many
[39:28] believes that we need to pray for Israel
[39:30] the nation of Israel we need to pray for
[39:32] the police the the Peace of Jerusalem
[39:34] because why does it always say to pray
[39:36] for the Peace of Jerusalem because there
[39:39] there's never been real peace in
[39:40] Jerusalem and there won't be until God
[39:43] comes and sets it up himself but until
[39:46] that time they're going to have a lot of
[39:47] turmoil and more increased all the time
[39:50] but when I think of the annihilation of
[39:52] the devil trying to annihilate uh God's
[39:55] people the Jews the the same devil this
[39:57] is what also I was burden for last night
[39:59] and I'm already preaching here but the
[40:02] same devil attacks the Believers of the
[40:05] the word every
[40:07] day and he's not just to make peace with
[40:10] you and just to get you to to loosen up
[40:12] a littleit he's out for your
[40:13] Annihilation spiritually that's his
[40:15] agenda for your life so be aware that
[40:18] whatever Israel is fighting now in the
[40:19] natural you're fighting it every day in
[40:21] your mind and the devil Don't Play With
[40:23] the Devil don't mess with him because
[40:24] he's out for your annihilation
[40:27] and uh I feel it's funny how you stay in
[40:29] prayer for the attacks against yourself
[40:31] and the attacks against your ministry
[40:33] when you stand for this message you're
[40:35] going to be attacked and it's
[40:37] interesting to be burdened about that
[40:39] even attacked internally from the enemy
[40:42] um it's interesting to see what happens
[40:44] with Israel now but he said uh when I
[40:46] asked him last night at the moment we
[40:47] are home quietly and so far safe it is
[40:50] very tense right now in the country a
[40:51] lot of fear and unknown the whole nation
[40:54] is in shock and aware that we are
[40:56] entering in an extended conflict I live
[40:58] near the air base and the planes are
[41:00] non-stop tanks lining Road six on the
[41:02] way to Gaza there are over 50 Israelis
[41:05] well that's changed now because it's
[41:07] about 600 murdered now 600 Israelis
[41:10] murdered and a 100 that's taken hostage
[41:13] lots of women and children and elderly
[41:15] people never have we seen something like
[41:17] this the infiltrators are spreading
[41:18] through the country we met on Zoom
[41:20] yesterday that's how they had service
[41:22] appreciate all the prayer only the Lord
[41:25] Jesus can protect and stop it from
[41:26] progressing at the moment all the
[41:28] Believers are okay thanks so much for
[41:30] checking on us and he sent me a couple
[41:32] of videos this morning he said thank you
[41:35] so much the reality on the ground is
[41:36] much worse than the news showing so we
[41:39] appreciate the prayer if I have any
[41:41] updates I will send them to you and so I
[41:44] think we need to be in special prayer
[41:46] for brother Colin his family his church
[41:49] that gathers uh some Filipinos some
[41:51] Russians and also many Israelis now
[41:54] trying to gather this will probably stop
[41:56] their gathering together I don't know
[41:57] but let's pray be in support of them not
[41:59] only financially but also let's be in
[42:02] support of them in our prayers how many
[42:04] will commit to that and we'll just go to
[42:06] prayer in a minute with for that in in
[42:08] in that need amen so be mindful of the
[42:12] our missions that we're dedicated to
[42:15] here at the church in your giving and I
[42:17] want to say also we have needs here at
[42:19] the church that we presented to you I
[42:21] want to say thank you those who are
[42:22] continually given to the HVAC project um
[42:26] and so you have given as of the 1 of
[42:29] October 27,1 127 so uh that makes us
[42:33] only 23,000 away from finishing all the
[42:36] updates with the HVAC so thank you for
[42:39] giving whether it's big or little it
[42:41] doesn't matter it's still uh putting
[42:43] chunks on that and so we've raised
[42:45] 27,000 we need another 23,000 so God be
[42:49] with you in your giving with that as
[42:50] well as as well as the missions praise
[42:53] the
[42:54] Lord wanted to say happy birthday to my
[42:57] daughter-in-law Lily who's a very
[43:00] special daughter-in-law I appreciate her
[43:02] she's a sweet girl loves the Lord God
[43:05] bless you Happy
[43:09] Birthday amen do you love the Lord today
[43:12] the little business coming from Brother
[43:14] Tom the sports director parents and
[43:17] young people please note that the youth
[43:18] Hall which is the back hall is not a
[43:21] gym no ball games of any kind are to be
[43:24] played in that room as of today we'
[43:26] removed the balls from the back room one
[43:28] of the main reasons I told him yesterday
[43:30] is there's a fireplace that's going in
[43:32] there and you can see it going up
[43:33] brother Henry's helping has put that in
[43:35] we would like to make that an area for
[43:37] Fellowship around that for youth
[43:39] meetings and also if the adults want to
[43:41] Fellowship back there eventually we'll
[43:43] have that done and we don't want any
[43:44] balls in that room being played anymore
[43:46] so we're changing that today you can go
[43:49] outside or outside or the fellowship
[43:52] hall uh when it is available those other
[43:55] two places are are to be used for
[43:56] activities or you can go outside as the
[43:58] weather permits so if you would do that
[44:00] we're going to make that change now that
[44:01] we don't want any balls in there we have
[44:03] equipment and the fireplace and
[44:04] different things and we like to like to
[44:06] shift it to an area where we have
[44:08] fellowship and then the children can
[44:10] play other places also having a little
[44:12] issue with uh people leaving food at the
[44:15] end of the day so we'd appreciate it if
[44:17] you take all your food with you and all
[44:18] your pots and pans and especially the
[44:21] tables when you leave a table we want
[44:22] you to stay in Fellowship but even if
[44:25] you leave and go for food and come back
[44:27] or something or come back in the evening
[44:29] make sure you clean your table and get
[44:30] something to wash it off uh clean it off
[44:33] we'd certainly appreciate that and pick
[44:34] up after yourself most people are doing
[44:36] it some are leaving things and so we
[44:38] just want to remind you to stay up with
[44:40] that as well we'd certainly appreciate
[44:41] it amen so you know I don't want to wear
[44:45] my voice out for just the
[44:47] announcements I appreciate your prayers
[44:49] and today's service will go as long as
[44:51] my voice will go but he has healed me
[44:54] and restored it and I'm on the men and I
[44:56] just felt so burdened to preach this
[44:58] morning we'll try to get it out and uh

[45:31] still today to live in a safe country we
[45:34] feel it's still very safe compared to
[45:37] other places and Lord first we want to

[45:42] Nation Lord and surrounded and we know
[45:44] the
[45:45] scripture proclaims that they will be

[45:50] will be a change in the prophetic things
[45:52] that you've said and Lord things will
[45:54] shift from the bride that you've been
[45:55] been molding and she'll be raptured and
[45:57] then the the emphasis will shift to your
[45:59] people to bring them a Revival Lord and

[49:02] 36 and starting at verse 24 for I will
[49:05] take you from among the Heathen and
[49:07] gather you out of all countries and will
[49:10] bring you into your own land then will I
[49:12] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[49:14] shall be clean from all of your
[49:16] filthiness and from all of your Idols
[49:19] will I cleanse you a new heart also will
[49:21] I give you and a new spirit will I put
[49:24] within you and I will take away the
[49:26] Stony Stony heart out of your flesh and
[49:28] I will give you a heart of Flesh and I
[49:31] will put my spirit within you and cause
[49:33] you to walk in my statues and ye shall
[49:36] keep my judgments and do them ye shall
[49:39] dwell in the land that I gave your
[49:40] fathers and ye shall be my people and I
[49:42] will be your God I will also save you
[49:45] from all your uncleanness and I will
[49:47] call for the corn and will increase it
[49:49] and lay no famine upon you and I will
[49:52] multiply the fruit of the tree I don't
[49:54] know if any of you are sitting there
[49:56] saying this is for me this morning but
[49:57] you ought to take this promise for you
[49:59] individually and say whatever he said
[50:02] he's going to do and I receive it I will
[50:05] multiply the fruit of the tree and
[50:06] increase the field that ye shall receive
[50:08] no more reproach of famine among the
[50:10] Heathen then shall you remember your own
[50:12] evil ways and your doings that were not
[50:14] good and shall loath yourselves in your
[50:17] own sight for your iniquities for you
[50:19] and for your Abominations not for your
[50:21] sakes do I this sayith the Lord God be
[50:24] it known unto you be ashamed and
[50:26] confounded for your own ways oh House of
[50:28] Israel thus sayth the Lord God in the
[50:30] day that I shall have cleansed you from
[50:33] all your iniquities I will also cause
[50:36] you to dwell in the cities and the Wast
[50:38] shall be builded and the desolate land
[50:41] shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate
[50:43] in the sight uh of all that passed by
[50:47] and they shall say this land that was
[50:50] desolate is become like the Garden of
[50:53] Eden and the waste and desolate and
[50:56] ruined cities are become fenced are
[50:59] inhabited did anybody catch after he
[51:01] does all of this to Israel then it
[51:04] doesn't stop he said I'll restore you
[51:06] back back to what it was at Eden again
[51:09] I'll restore it completely back to Eden
[51:11] again I tell you you're under a
[51:13] restoration that doesn't go
[51:15] halfway this is significant today
[51:18] because it doesn't look like Israel is
[51:19] heading in a good place there physically
[51:21] but this is God's promise right here and
[51:24] someday the desolate place place will
[51:26] come back like a Garden of Eden again
[51:28] for God's people apply this to yourself
[51:30] and we say thank God that you're doing
[51:32] this work in my life amen may God ask
[51:35] the blessings to his word God bless you
[51:36] this morning now last Sunday uh or the
[51:40] last service that we were speaking we
[51:42] left off with the first reference to the
[51:45] holy ghost in the Old Testament the
[51:47] first main reference and that was in
[51:49] Isaiah 28 where it says for all tables
[51:51] are full of vomit and filthiness so that
[51:54] there's no place clean Whom Shall he
[51:56] teach knowledge Whom Shall you make to
[51:58] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[52:00] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[52:02] for precept must be upon precept precept
[52:05] upon precept line upon line line upon
[52:07] line here a little and there a little
[52:10] for with stammering lips in another
[52:11] tongue will I speak to this people to
[52:13] whom he said this is the rest wherewith
[52:16] ye may cause the weary to rest and this
[52:19] is the refreshing yet they would not
[52:22] hear but the word of the Lord was unto
[52:23] them precept upon pre Reep line upon
[52:26] line here a little and there a little
[52:28] that they might go and fall backward and
[52:31] be broken and snared and taken so the
[52:33] text says when this Holy Ghost comes
[52:36] there'll be many resist it and resist
[52:37] the Holy Ghost but thank God there will
[52:39] be some to receive it so the conclusion
[52:42] of Isaiah 28 just to summarize is that
[52:46] in these scriptures we find that what is
[52:48] tied to the Holy Ghost is it is the
[52:50] fresh food coming it's not it's a fresh
[52:53] word of the hour that he sends the Holy
[52:56] Ghost to make real and so if it's old
[52:59] food vomit he says your tables are full
[53:01] of vomit that's all regurgitated food so
[53:05] when God sends the Holy Ghost it's to
[53:07] identify himself with the word for that
[53:10] hour and it is a fresh word that comes
[53:13] it is the word for the hour so when
[53:15] we're looking at the evidences of the
[53:17] Holy Ghost and wanting to know what it
[53:18] is it's tied to the word of God its
[53:21] evidence is tied to the word because it
[53:23] keeps saying line upon line precept upon
[53:26] precept here a little there a little
[53:28] it's tied to the word being line upon
[53:31] line not outside of the not the outside
[53:34] manifestation of stammering lips that
[53:37] will be the outside manifestation but
[53:39] the inside is its tied to the word the
[53:42] people will come for the word of that
[53:44] day the Holy Ghost will fill them to
[53:46] make that word live that is the evidence
[53:49] of the Holy Ghost and then it says it's
[53:51] the rest how many believe the Holy Ghost
[53:53] is a rest it's the refreshing can you
[53:56] say Amen if it's a rest then it's it's
[53:59] not something that's complicated if it's
[54:00] a rest he don't send the Holy Ghost to
[54:02] make your life more
[54:04] confused Jesus said come unto me all you
[54:07] that are weary and heavy laden and I'll
[54:09] give you rest he's talking about the
[54:11] Holy Ghost so when he comes he doesn't
[54:14] make a struggle over works and I got to
[54:16] gain my entrance into heaven no the Holy
[54:18] Ghost when it comes into your life is to
[54:20] bring rest it is the refreshing it is
[54:22] the rest that comes to your life and the
[54:25] biggest rest is in your soul that I
[54:26] don't have to work my way into heaven
[54:28] that he comes changes your nature can
[54:30] you say amen and I'm at peace with
[54:33] God going in a Rapture that's a rest
[54:37] Jesus God when he when he spoke from the
[54:39] beginning he had to rest in his own word
[54:42] after six days of creating then he went
[54:44] into a Sabbath and you know what he was
[54:46] resting on the word that he already
[54:47] spoke right God has already spoke his
[54:50] word and the Holy Ghost say you enter
[54:53] into rest that he's already spoken it'll
[54:55] be done that's what the scripture is
[54:57] saying and then the last thing some
[54:59] would reject the line upon line for word
[55:01] for their day and this fits with step's
[55:04] rebuke just before he was stoned by the
[55:06] Jews he looks up and he says these words
[55:09] which is pretty Stern and we might get
[55:11] get back into this in a subject of the
[55:13] Holy Ghost ye do always resist the Holy
[55:16] Ghost as your fathers did he's speaking
[55:18] to religious leaders you're resisting
[55:20] the word for your hour you're resisting
[55:23] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did and
[55:25] the the opposite then of resisting is
[55:28] what the opposite of resisting the Holy
[55:30] Ghost is
[55:32] believing it's just that simple God
[55:34] needs a believing
[55:36] heart God needs you to believe God needs
[55:39] you to trust all the stuff that he wants
[55:41] to do to you here in Ezekiel and change
[55:43] your life it it comes by this person
[55:45] that begins to believe not up here but
[55:48] really believe it I believe it and you
[55:50] start saying Lord I believe this I don't
[55:52] see it yet in my life but I believe it
[55:55] resisting it is a different
[55:57] story but when you begin to believe
[55:59] isn't amazing the entire message theme
[56:01] song was just two
[56:04] words and the angel liked that song and
[56:07] though they sang it at every healing
[56:08] line and every service just about the
[56:10] theme of the entire message was not
[56:12] Doctrine the theme song for the entire
[56:15] message was not heavy
[56:17] revies heavy Revelation the theme of the
[56:20] entire message was only believe all
[56:24] things are possible
[56:26] when you get to believe he said if you
[56:27] get the people believe nothing will
[56:30] stand in your way not even cancer if you
[56:32] could do what get a dress code get them
[56:35] lined up on the outside no get them to
[56:37] believe this is
[56:39] God only believe this morning only
[56:43] believe step out come to the altar in
[56:46] your heart begin to believe what God can
[56:48] do for you and that's the opposite of
[56:50] resisting it blocking it and so there
[56:53] was those that resisted it even Steven
[56:56] spoke of but when we begin to believe
[56:58] then we come into God starting a work in
[57:01] us and filling us blessed be the name of
[57:05] the Lord Now we move to the next place
[57:08] in the Old Testament that emphasizes the
[57:11] Holy Ghost and that's in Ezekiel 36 the
[57:13] scriptures that I read to you and of
[57:16] course the scriptures is Naturally
[57:18] Speaking of Israel's restoration as a
[57:20] nation what he will do in the last days
[57:23] for his people what he does to Israel as
[57:26] a nation he does to you as an individual
[57:28] he worked as an individual to the
[57:31] Gentiles and he works as a nation to
[57:35] Israel so whatever he does in Prophecy
[57:38] to Israel as a nation he's doing to you
[57:41] as an individual that's right always
[57:43] forget that always we always forget the
[57:46] fact that we that we are somehow uh
[57:49] looking at this like a group effort I'm
[57:51] in the message I I go to the message
[57:53] meetings I'm this that and the other but
[57:56] we should never look at this I want to
[57:57] see more Unity at the message churches I
[58:00] want to see more unity in the
[58:03] bride and when I think of the Bride I
[58:05] don't just think of certain churches
[58:07] under a certain label that's not how he
[58:10] deals with the Gentiles oh if they could
[58:12] all just come I'm not so sure every
[58:14] technical church is going to come in
[58:16] Oneness and unity but the bride will
[58:18] individuals
[58:20] will I don't even know if everyone in
[58:22] our own assembly I'd like everybody to
[58:24] but would come into the Oneness like
[58:26] Pentecost again I don't know if you will
[58:28] because this is not a church effort this
[58:30] is an individual effort and he will have
[58:33] a bride from every nation from all the
[58:35] churches can you say amen I don't know
[58:37] who his bride is but she will come into
[58:40] unity and she will be in a Rapture so be
[58:43] careful that you own always you're just
[58:44] looking for everybody and all the
[58:46] preachers to agree and all this I think
[58:49] that's not what God looks at it he deals
[58:51] with Israel as a nation he deals with
[58:53] you as an individual that's why he could
[58:55] say if you want your church to have a
[58:58] Revival don't wait around for everybody
[59:00] else let the Revival start in
[59:05] you and it'll break out other
[59:07] places oh we're having a Revival we're
[59:10] having a meeting we're having a camp
[59:11] meeting we're doing a tent meeting we're
[59:12] doing this I got to get to that that's
[59:14] great if you're hearing the word of God
[59:16] but don't don't put yourself as I'm a
[59:18] part of something right and so I'm okay
[59:22] because I'm a part of a certain group
[59:24] the message the message to me is not the
[59:29] churches the message is what God sent in
[59:31] the last days to get us back to Bible
[59:34] Faith that's what the message is lot of
[59:37] things that's been done under the name
[59:41] of the
[59:45] message I don't talk about him a lot
[59:47] because I'm ashamed that would happen
[59:49] under brother Brandon if he was here
[59:51] he'd be
[59:53] ashamed every great minister of God if
[59:57] God uses them greatly Luther Wesley have
[1:00:00] fanaticism that follow them that's the
[1:00:03] devil's
[1:00:04] work we have a reporter that's contacted
[1:00:07] the church and asked us and I'm getting
[1:00:09] some advice from our Communications rep
[1:00:11] there brother Jared he deals with these
[1:00:13] things she's heard a lot of bad things
[1:00:17] and the stuff she listed we're not
[1:00:19] guilty of any of it but she said I want
[1:00:21] to come I'd like to be a part of service
[1:00:23] and I want to inter and I want to talk
[1:00:25] to you to see if I can get a positive
[1:00:28] side to what takes place and and what it
[1:00:32] is that you believe and so I've been
[1:00:34] very prayerful about that because you
[1:00:37] never
[1:00:38] know but I believe God will lead us and
[1:00:40] give us wisdom and we'll be we'll be
[1:00:42] sharing more with you about that it's
[1:00:44] bound to happen when you're out there on
[1:00:46] the internet and things people want to
[1:00:47] know what you believe but I just sent
[1:00:49] back a little simple thing and I said
[1:00:50] listen you are welcome to come and and
[1:00:53] you know view what we're doing but let
[1:00:55] me say this everything you've listed
[1:00:57] here that you have heard we're not
[1:00:59] guilty or responsible or don't believe
[1:01:01] any of that that you've heard that's
[1:01:02] went on we believe in Jesus Christ that
[1:01:05] he sent a man of God and I believe that
[1:01:10] if we're prayerful as a church we can
[1:01:12] send a positive message about this
[1:01:15] message that's would be my desire
[1:01:17] because you don't hear a lot of positive
[1:01:19] praise the Lord so what God does to
[1:01:22] Israel as a nation he does to the
[1:01:25] individual and the end result to Ezekiel
[1:01:27] 36 is that I the end result is in verse
[1:01:32] uh it would be
[1:01:34] 27 I will put my spirit within
[1:01:40] you that's what he wants to
[1:01:43] do now don't let that become common to
[1:01:47] you please that is that is a huge thing
[1:01:52] that God in our s sin in our Humanity in
[1:01:56] our Brokenness in our flub UPS if in in
[1:02:00] our nature that we're born with because
[1:02:02] everybody knows from what I've been
[1:02:03] preaching you were born with the wrong
[1:02:05] nature in you but with all of our
[1:02:08] baggage with everything that we got God
[1:02:10] said I'm going to take that all that
[1:02:12] baggage I'm going to take you
[1:02:15] on and I'm going to cleanse you I'm
[1:02:18] going to take you from the Heathen I'm
[1:02:19] going to I'm going to cleanse you with
[1:02:22] sprinkle you with water and then I've
[1:02:24] got to change your Stony heart and then
[1:02:25] I've got to do this is what I want to
[1:02:27] talk about today and all of it there's
[1:02:29] you have nothing to do with it I'm
[1:02:31] taking you on as my
[1:02:35] masterpiece and my end result is to
[1:02:38] prepare a place a tabernacle In Your
[1:02:40] Vessel that I would actually put my
[1:02:44] spirit within
[1:02:46] you this is the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost hallu I say praise the
[1:02:53] lord lord so we've already learned in
[1:02:56] this that we are his workmanship so we
[1:02:58] see here how he leads and does the work
[1:03:00] from the beginning he does it all I
[1:03:02] mentioned nine times in these verses he
[1:03:05] mentions the word I I will bring you
[1:03:07] from the other countries I will give you
[1:03:09] a new spirit I will change your Stony
[1:03:11] heart I will change your spirit I is
[1:03:14] mentioned nine times and you're not in
[1:03:17] there except what God's doing to
[1:03:20] you you didn't go to any seminars to
[1:03:23] make yourself better you didn't put any
[1:03:25] Band-Aids on it you don't own there some
[1:03:27] Theologian God said I'm I'm it's a
[1:03:30] personal
[1:03:32] pronoun I love you so much I'll take you
[1:03:35] as you are but I won't leave you as you
[1:03:38] are and God can take the worst sinner
[1:03:41] the worst homosexual lesbian a filthy
[1:03:44] adulterer prostitute give me your worst
[1:03:47] cases God says I will take you on and I
[1:03:52] will love you out of your mess and then
[1:03:54] when I'm done I will actually put my
[1:03:56] spirit within you somebody ought to sh
[1:03:59] shout and say praise the
[1:04:00] Lord you better not take that for
[1:04:03] granted that you're just a church member
[1:04:05] because I preach to some church members
[1:04:07] I preach to the body of Christ I preach
[1:04:09] to church members but God wants to make
[1:04:11] you more than a church member more than
[1:04:13] ones that just comes and raises your
[1:04:14] hand God says I want to put my spirit
[1:04:18] within
[1:04:19] [Applause]
[1:04:22] you we are his workmanship so he says
[1:04:25] I'll do it it's not your works from
[1:04:26] start to finish it's him if you will
[1:04:28] believe and receive put yourself for
[1:04:31] your in other words the only thing that
[1:04:33] you can do is put yourself in an
[1:04:36] obedience to him say Okay Lord I'm going
[1:04:38] to climb up on the potter's
[1:04:41] wheel CU you're the
[1:04:44] Potter it's quiet here but I want to ask
[1:04:46] every person in this room I don't care
[1:04:48] if you're a visitor or you've been with
[1:04:50] me 35 years how willing are you to bring
[1:04:54] yourself and put yourself up on the
[1:04:56] Potter's
[1:04:57] will and don't leave you stay there for
[1:05:00] the rest of your life how many would
[1:05:02] trust God and say I'm ready to put
[1:05:04] myself on The Potter's will you mold me
[1:05:07] you cuz when when that Potter he's got
[1:05:10] all that stuff and you see that big lump
[1:05:13] of clay there and he just starts to work
[1:05:15] his hands on your life and get off all
[1:05:17] CU he sees the image of what you'll be
[1:05:19] you don't but he sees it and he just
[1:05:21] keeps working and keeps working and
[1:05:23] tearing things off your life tan that
[1:05:25] smoking drinking and gambling and gaming
[1:05:28] bad gaming and and and pornography and
[1:05:31] all that and you just you just you just
[1:05:33] all you did was get up on the Potter's
[1:05:38] well I'm not perfect today except for
[1:05:41] the blood of Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ but I've kept my life on the
[1:05:45] Potter's
[1:05:47] will and it's day by day sometimes every
[1:05:50] service he's still correcting me just
[1:05:54] just rubbing that off rubbing that off
[1:05:57] too only Perfect by his blood can you
[1:06:00] say Amen so we see then that the result
[1:06:04] and the goal is him living in you that's
[1:06:07] the mystery of Christ is to put his
[1:06:09] spirit in you that's the Holy Ghost his
[1:06:13] spirit and and and and I don't know who
[1:06:15] would not want this I don't know who
[1:06:18] what person would not want for God to
[1:06:20] come in their lives and put his Spirit
[1:06:23] within you
[1:06:24] now we we hash over the details we
[1:06:27] complicate it sometimes ministers will
[1:06:29] get up and give their testimony and they
[1:06:31] think everybody's testimony is going to
[1:06:33] be the same as theirs it's the same Holy
[1:06:36] Ghost but you'll have your own testimony
[1:06:39] because if he's going to go the Heathen
[1:06:40] and find you first he has to go find you
[1:06:44] and you're dwelling amongst the Heathen
[1:06:46] a bunch of smokers and Drinkers and
[1:06:47] gambl and grew up in a home there's
[1:06:49] alcoholics and you come everybody comes
[1:06:51] from different countries but you were
[1:06:53] with the heathen
[1:06:54] and let me say if you weren't with the
[1:06:56] Heathen you got a heathen
[1:07:00] heart if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:02] you're you're on the internet with the
[1:07:04] Heathen every day
[1:07:07] right praise the Lord I'm getting my
[1:07:09] voice back I'm getting ready to preach
[1:07:11] now well I didn't come from the
[1:07:13] denomination I didn't come from the
[1:07:15] world I grew up in this message but
[1:07:16] you're still a heathen in your heart and
[1:07:18] you're still without the Holy Ghost
[1:07:20] hanging around the Heathen on the
[1:07:21] internet with pornography and social
[1:07:23] media media you're you're looking to the
[1:07:25] Heathen how does she dress how does she
[1:07:28] act I want to be like the Heathen and
[1:07:29] God says you know what I got to get you
[1:07:32] away from the Heathen
[1:07:34] first so I'll take you from among the
[1:07:36] Heathen and I'll get you here up on the
[1:07:38] potter's wheel and I'll begin to work at
[1:07:40] your
[1:07:42] life so his result is to put his Spirit
[1:07:45] who wouldn't want this who would not be
[1:07:46] willing to want this wonderful thing of
[1:07:48] his spirit being in us a promise to put
[1:07:51] his Spirit within you that you live out
[1:07:53] this work of the Lord you live out his
[1:07:56] word not by rules not by a law but you
[1:07:59] live out the word by him living in you
[1:08:03] because for 2,000 years Satan's always
[1:08:05] trying to take it back to a law back to
[1:08:07] dos and don'ts you do this you don't do
[1:08:09] this you do that you don't do this and
[1:08:12] so you got people living it to try to
[1:08:14] please God and live this word how can
[1:08:17] anybody live this word with a serpent
[1:08:21] nature you talk about a miserable
[1:08:25] life but when he says I don't want you
[1:08:27] to live it with a serpent nature I don't
[1:08:29] want you to try to do it yourself I need
[1:08:32] you to believe me and put yourself on
[1:08:34] the potter's wheel and I'll burn all
[1:08:36] that stuff out of you I'll sprinkle you
[1:08:38] with clear water then then I'll fill you
[1:08:41] with my spirit and when I do you'll walk
[1:08:43] in my statues you'll walk in my
[1:08:47] word hallelujah
[1:08:51] so it's to restore the human being back
[1:08:56] to Eden again as it said because of the
[1:08:58] Fall look all that God has to do to get
[1:09:01] you in a place to receive his Spirit he
[1:09:03] has to take you from the Heathen gather
[1:09:05] you out of all the countries sprinkle
[1:09:07] with you with clean
[1:09:09] water cleanse you from your filthiness
[1:09:12] cleanse you from your Idols wash you
[1:09:15] from your Idols because you live a life
[1:09:17] of Idols you got Idols you got images
[1:09:20] that you you bow to I don't bow to
[1:09:23] nothing in your heart you bow to images
[1:09:26] you bow to sports
[1:09:28] stars you bow to musical stars to to
[1:09:33] Divas you bow to intellectuals if you're
[1:09:35] more intellectually SL you bow to the
[1:09:37] scientists and you bow to science and
[1:09:40] there's the world is full of idols and
[1:09:42] television helps to bring those images
[1:09:43] in front of us all the time so we can
[1:09:45] bow
[1:09:47] more that's true and then he said I got
[1:09:50] to give you a new heart I got to give
[1:09:53] you a new spirit and God says I'm I'm
[1:09:56] I'm taking away your Stony heart and
[1:09:58] then when then I give you a new spirit
[1:10:02] because you see you don't have a willing
[1:10:04] Spirit you you have a before you even
[1:10:08] get the Holy Ghost and his Spirit within
[1:10:10] you you have a spirit that's unwilling
[1:10:12] to
[1:10:17] come everybody wants to say I know God
[1:10:20] and I i' like to worship God but to come
[1:10:22] his way every Spirit seems to be
[1:10:26] unwilling you don't have a willing
[1:10:28] spirit so this is the way it's been said
[1:10:30] God will never make you go against your
[1:10:34] will but he certainly can make you
[1:10:36] willing to
[1:10:39] go there's an old song I thought of that
[1:10:41] somebody's saying Sharon uh Ike you'll
[1:10:44] remember this and I'm going to go back
[1:10:46] on my notes because oh do you guys have
[1:10:47] that did you find it sister jeie well
[1:10:50] this is just a little break at this old
[1:10:52] song that is uh called um what's it
[1:10:57] called sister
[1:10:58] jeie The Hornet
[1:11:01] song Sharon you remember
[1:11:04] this the old Hornet song that basically
[1:11:07] end saying God doesn't make us go
[1:11:09] against our will but he certainly can
[1:11:12] make us willing to
[1:11:13] go God can create situation when the
[1:11:16] Canaanites Harden their hearts against
[1:11:18] God and grieved him because of their sin
[1:11:20] God sent along Hornets to bring terms
[1:11:22] and to help his own people people to win
[1:11:24] now the Hornets persuaded them that it
[1:11:26] was best to go quickly and not to go
[1:11:28] slow they didn't compel them to go
[1:11:30] against their will but they just made
[1:11:31] them willing to
[1:11:35] go go ahead let's they liked it so we'll
[1:11:37] do
[1:11:38] it God doesn't compel us to go oh no he
[1:11:42] never compels us to go God does not
[1:11:45] compel us to go against our will but he
[1:11:46] just makes us willing to go give me
[1:11:48] another verse there if a nest of live
[1:11:50] Hornets were brought to this room and
[1:11:52] the creatures allowed to go free free
[1:11:54] you would not need urging to make
[1:11:55] yourself
[1:11:56] scarce you'd want to get out don't you
[1:11:59] see they would not lay hold and by force
[1:12:02] of their strength throw you out of the W
[1:12:04] out of the window oh no they would not
[1:12:06] compel you to go against your will they
[1:12:08] would just make you willing to go is
[1:12:09] there another one yeah next one when
[1:12:13] Jonah was sent to the work of the Lord
[1:12:14] the Outlook was very not very bright why
[1:12:17] he never had done such a hard thing
[1:12:19] before so he backed out and ran off from
[1:12:21] the flight but God sent a big F to
[1:12:23] swallow him up the story I'm sure you
[1:12:25] all know God didn't compel him to go
[1:12:28] against his will but he just made him
[1:12:30] willing to
[1:12:32] go Ezekiel 36 to me says this because
[1:12:36] you have a spirit that's
[1:12:38] unwilling you were born with it you were
[1:12:41] born with a nature that actually is in
[1:12:44] an enemy against
[1:12:46] God you didn't learn that you're just
[1:12:49] automatically an an enemy against God by
[1:12:53] what you feel feel rock and roll the
[1:12:55] spirit of rock and roll will catch a
[1:12:57] young heart Prophet says I wish I could
[1:12:59] take my children up to the mountain and
[1:13:01] get them away from all this but he says
[1:13:03] what's in them is going to come out
[1:13:05] anyway oh I wish I could take my
[1:13:07] children up to a mountain no phones no
[1:13:10] internet no access to nothing protect my
[1:13:13] kids completely from it and I think we
[1:13:15] should there's a certain protection
[1:13:16] homes under the token give their kids
[1:13:19] but he said if I would to do that and
[1:13:21] get them away from all these bad influen
[1:13:23] he said what's in them is going to come
[1:13:25] out and he said rock and roll will catch
[1:13:28] that heart just as quick as anything
[1:13:29] because what's in them rock and roll
[1:13:31] Spirit was created to make that nature
[1:13:36] happy I love it I love the country music
[1:13:38] I love the music of the world they grab
[1:13:41] it's all been developed by Satan to
[1:13:43] match a serpent nature but I want to
[1:13:45] tell you there's songs and there's the
[1:13:48] word and there's things God's created to
[1:13:50] match the nature of somebody with the
[1:13:51] Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] Holy Ghost only feeds on one thing and
[1:13:56] that's the word of God not entertainment
[1:13:59] not Fellowship but when you get it the
[1:14:02] main thing that you'll want is to hear
[1:14:04] the word of
[1:14:06] God I want it and I I'm I was here
[1:14:09] Wednesday night and I heard it but I'm
[1:14:10] here again every day I want to because
[1:14:12] there's a craving one of the evidences I
[1:14:14] seen in my life is I got a craving for
[1:14:17] the word of God like I never had before
[1:14:19] Something's Happened if you're craving
[1:14:20] that more than all the other things you
[1:14:22] enjoyed before all of that's become less
[1:14:24] that's a sideshow I don't even want some
[1:14:26] of it anymore I don't want that but I
[1:14:28] really love to hear the next step in the
[1:14:31] word I really love to be in the word of
[1:14:35] God Amen I think a lot of you can say
[1:14:38] that's happened in my
[1:14:42] life
[1:14:43] so God comes and does the work he
[1:14:46] doesn't make us go against their will
[1:14:47] but he makes us willing to go that's
[1:14:49] what I see here in Ezekiel
[1:14:50] 36 and don't put yourself in your own
[1:14:53] time frames of when God's going to do
[1:14:55] this that's where we get in trouble I I
[1:14:58] do see a process here of God working on
[1:15:00] us to get us ready to receive his
[1:15:03] spirit I believe it's a growth I believe
[1:15:06] it's a process but nobody knows the time
[1:15:08] FR frames and the process for you and
[1:15:12] the process for me and if you put your
[1:15:14] own time frames on it say okay I need to
[1:15:16] reach this I've had Minister say okay I
[1:15:18] have how can I come up to the pyramid
[1:15:20] okay so I've got faith I need virtue now
[1:15:22] I need knowledge Temperance patience I
[1:15:24] got this and and so they're trying to
[1:15:27] work it all out and brother B says God
[1:15:29] births everything every one of those
[1:15:30] things he birth into you so he's still
[1:15:33] doing it so I could okay got virtue now
[1:15:37] on to the next one Lord we don't know
[1:15:39] what he's doing we just submit
[1:15:41] ourselves we know when we got more
[1:15:43] patience you like wow something's
[1:15:45] happened to me cuz I would have bit that
[1:15:48] guy's head off
[1:15:50] before Something's Happened to Me the
[1:15:53] love of God is taken
[1:15:55] over so we don't put time frames because
[1:16:00] it I just say in his it's in his time in
[1:16:03] his season we just submit ourselves to
[1:16:06] God can you say amen and I do believe we
[1:16:08] offer a desperation to God that was the
[1:16:11] message after the token the Holy Ghost
[1:16:12] is desperation because God likes to see
[1:16:15] a desperation God let me just say it
[1:16:18] this way to be simple this
[1:16:19] morning how can you receive his Spirit
[1:16:22] the the holy ghost in your life if you
[1:16:25] haven't even asked for
[1:16:29] it he likes to hear you
[1:16:32] ask he likes to really want
[1:16:36] it oh Lord he just give it to me
[1:16:39] whenever he feels I'm not preaching that
[1:16:40] this morning I'm looking for a
[1:16:42] desperation to say God I'm asking for
[1:16:45] this thing of your spirit I need it now
[1:16:47] more than ever the time is short and I'm
[1:16:49] not doing it just to to evade hell I'm
[1:16:52] doing because I need this in my life
[1:16:54] there's too many demon powers trying to
[1:16:56] lead me into pornography and into the
[1:16:58] things of the world and lust and all
[1:17:00] these other things I need your spirit
[1:17:01] living in me ask and you shall receive
[1:17:04] knock and it shall be open to you he
[1:17:07] likes us to be desperate in the asking
[1:17:10] but we don't do the work and let me say
[1:17:12] something about your time frames okay
[1:17:14] that you put on God and try to diagnose
[1:17:16] where you're at and diagnose where the
[1:17:19] rest of the people
[1:17:20] are we're so good at diagnosing where
[1:17:24] people are in their Christian walk can I
[1:17:26] get an amen we're professionals we're
[1:17:29] we're Fruit
[1:17:31] inspectors we're going to examine the
[1:17:33] fruit in everybody else but they're not
[1:17:36] too good at it as far as
[1:17:38] ourselves but we do it in everybody else
[1:17:40] and then we think no we know where we're
[1:17:42] at and you know one fell sometime in the
[1:17:45] office says we're in a really good place
[1:17:46] right now we yeah we're we're in a good
[1:17:48] place we're in a good place and and I'm
[1:17:50] seeing otherwise I'm trying to share
[1:17:51] with them as a pastor now there's
[1:17:52] something you know there's some things
[1:17:54] you need to take to the Cross I'm
[1:17:55] encouraging you as's a pastor some
[1:17:57] things you you you need to talk about
[1:17:59] with your family and such but to him hey
[1:18:01] everything was everything's hunky dory
[1:18:03] but you see now oh you can only pray
[1:18:05] because it's in God's timing God would
[1:18:07] Open the Eyes of every one of us to see
[1:18:10] where we're
[1:18:11] at but God has his own timing and let me
[1:18:15] say this God can do more in one
[1:18:17] moment that's right you see all this
[1:18:21] process he can do it he can do it just
[1:18:23] like
[1:18:24] that right we know that that new birth
[1:18:28] just like sin happened in a moment and
[1:18:30] we all of sons after the first Adam we
[1:18:33] were born in sin by a Moment of going
[1:18:36] against the word of God now all was had
[1:18:37] in a moment all of humanity fell under
[1:18:40] Adam and Eve we didn't even do that we
[1:18:44] inherited
[1:18:45] it in a moment that happened well if it
[1:18:48] can happen in sin in a moment in a
[1:18:51] moment God can change a life when you
[1:18:53] open your heart a moment he can do a lot
[1:18:55] of things because he's doing it so in a
[1:18:58] moment he could do more than you could
[1:19:01] ever do polishing yourself up for
[1:19:05] years don't put time frames of God just
[1:19:07] say my life is in his
[1:19:11] hands if you don't put it in his hands
[1:19:14] you can slow up God's work how many
[1:19:16] knows if you don't put your life in
[1:19:18] God's hand you'll slow up his work in
[1:19:20] ezel Ezekiel 36 I think you could slow
[1:19:23] down this process God wants to do it but
[1:19:25] if you don't put your life completely in
[1:19:26] his hands you slow up the process but I
[1:19:29] remind you of a promise all the father
[1:19:31] have given me will
[1:19:34] come that's what I preached the first
[1:19:36] time in the in the uh series on the Holy
[1:19:38] Ghost all the father given and I always
[1:19:40] say this those who been me with with me
[1:19:42] for years if you're a son or daughter of
[1:19:44] God you're either going to come hard or
[1:19:47] you're going to come
[1:19:48] easy but God's God's not going to let
[1:19:51] you go
[1:19:54] God's not going to let you
[1:19:56] go it's in his time frames but you'll
[1:19:59] never go too far as a son and daughter
[1:20:01] of God that's why we can't be critical
[1:20:03] as somebody who's gone way out and
[1:20:06] say they went out from us because they
[1:20:08] weren't of us and all these scriptures
[1:20:11] that we're
[1:20:12] quoting serpent seed and all and none of
[1:20:15] us have a right to label anyway I've I
[1:20:18] watched a message Minister leave this
[1:20:20] message 20 years ago and just here two
[1:20:23] or three years ago he went out he became
[1:20:25] a theologian he is from Sister miam's
[1:20:29] area there in Quebec he went out he
[1:20:31] become a theologian he studied he
[1:20:33] studied all the religions he studied all
[1:20:35] he' become a great thing and when he'
[1:20:37] been out there for 20 years he come back
[1:20:39] and testified over the pulpit at brother
[1:20:41] Chad's church I haven't found the
[1:20:43] revealed truth like this anywhere he he
[1:20:46] came back
[1:20:48] Hallelujah came back god wow so praise
[1:20:53] the Lord those of you who made him
[1:20:55] serpent seed you need to repent right
[1:20:58] you need to repent
[1:21:02] true God has his time for your
[1:21:05] life Hallelujah God has his timing you
[1:21:08] see I you know young person say I'm
[1:21:10] gonna put this off I'm gonna put this no
[1:21:12] it's not your time it's God's time he's
[1:21:15] got your
[1:21:16] number
[1:21:18] okay so he says here in the inner veil
[1:21:21] about this thing about putting a new
[1:21:23] spirit within you I didn't want to pass
[1:21:25] this up because this is real good he
[1:21:27] says in the interval in the first quote
[1:21:28] there notice you put a new spirit God
[1:21:31] puts a new spirit God has to give you a
[1:21:34] new spirit or you couldn't even get
[1:21:37] along with God you can't get along with
[1:21:41] yourself that Old Devil spirit that you
[1:21:44] had in you so he's got to put a new
[1:21:47] spirit in you so you can get along with
[1:21:50] his spirit amen I will put a new spirit
[1:21:53] in them I will put and I will put my
[1:21:56] spirit in them he said after he's given
[1:21:58] you a new spirit that's you don't get it
[1:22:02] confused with God's spirit sometimes
[1:22:04] somebody just gets a new spirit and okay
[1:22:06] I've got the Holy Ghost now not always
[1:22:08] not always because he has to give you
[1:22:10] and so they feel fresh they feel good
[1:22:12] they feel the maybe feel the power of
[1:22:14] God everything's okay don't say

[1:22:54] Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you
[1:22:55] amen cuz you're in a condition never get
[1:22:58] along you can't get along with your wife
[1:23:00] you can't get along with your husband
[1:23:02] you can't get along with your neighbor
[1:23:04] how you ever going to get along with
[1:23:09] God oh my that's so
[1:23:11] honest how you ever GNA you can't even
[1:23:13] get along with your wife you can't get
[1:23:15] along with your neighbor how you ever go
[1:23:18] you don't have a lot of getalong
[1:23:21] ability you're not born with it you got
[1:23:24] your friends and your little click or
[1:23:26] whatever but most people I don't need
[1:23:27] everybody else hello that's pride and I
[1:23:32] don't understand that's a church member
[1:23:34] because they I'll I'll pick who I like
[1:23:36] to be around and it'll be the cool
[1:23:38] people and I don't want to even be
[1:23:40] around the where's that come in I
[1:23:42] thought we were brothers in Christ
[1:23:45] yeah I just say to you this isn't the
[1:23:48] cool
[1:23:50] church and that's why some people that
[1:23:53] just they may not hang around because
[1:23:55] it's just we're not the cool Church the
[1:23:57] pastor's not cool and after a few years
[1:23:59] they realize he's just not
[1:24:01] cool I mean I try to dress nice but I'm
[1:24:03] still not cool my kids will tell you Dad
[1:24:06] is not
[1:24:08] cool but we're not the cool church we
[1:24:10] have some that's come from very rough
[1:24:13] situations and and we have quirky people
[1:24:16] here and we have we have all kinds here
[1:24:20] and most of us we're just not cool we're
[1:24:24] not the cool church if you want the cool
[1:24:25] church this isn't
[1:24:28] it where's all that come in with
[1:24:30] Brothers and Sisters in
[1:24:32] Christ we're not the cool Church we're
[1:24:35] here to try to find God and serve the
[1:24:37] Lord
[1:24:38] and humble
[1:24:42] ourselves to be broken together how many
[1:24:44] raise your hand say I'm broken I I need
[1:24:47] the Lord I'm broken why don't you come
[1:24:48] and be broken with us why don't you come
[1:24:50] and be one of us instead of think you're
[1:24:52] better than the rest of
[1:24:54] us amen so he goes on to say you can't
[1:24:58] even get along with him you don't have
[1:24:59] any get along ability when you're you're
[1:25:01] born with it so how are you going to get
[1:25:03] along with the word of God and the
[1:25:05] spirit of God not until God gives you a
[1:25:07] new spirit so you can start saying I
[1:25:09] believe him and then when he puts his
[1:25:11] Spirit that's the amen or to his word
[1:25:13] you love his word more than anything
[1:25:16] else there's only one true spirit that
[1:25:18] can live this word and it's the author
[1:25:21] himself of the book it's his Spirit you
[1:25:24] cannot do this on your
[1:25:26] own when I put my spirit in you it'll
[1:25:30] cause you to walk in my statues you'll
[1:25:32] walk in the ways of the word it'll
[1:25:34] happen you said well I struggle with
[1:25:36] dress and I just struggle with that you
[1:25:37] keep submitting yourself to God you'll
[1:25:39] get to the place you'll never struggle
[1:25:41] with that again it'll be over it might
[1:25:43] take you 10 years I hope it doesn't but
[1:25:45] you say someone struggling with that if
[1:25:47] you're a child of God one day that'll be
[1:25:49] over it'll be settled thank God we have
[1:25:51] some sisters in here that had images
[1:25:53] that was settled years ago they're not
[1:25:55] walking out with an UNM modest garment
[1:25:57] or a tight skirt or something like that
[1:25:59] it was settled years ago I'm not
[1:26:01] fighting this anymore this is the way
[1:26:03] God told us how to
[1:26:08] dress all the struggles are gone and you
[1:26:11] love it you you love it you love it and
[1:26:14] so I conclude after this quote he says
[1:26:17] you can't get along with husband how are
[1:26:18] you going to get along with he has to
[1:26:20] give you a new spirit before you can get
[1:26:22] along with him can you say
[1:26:24] amen he has to is there more to that so
[1:26:28] he puts a new spirit in you and then he
[1:26:29] puts his Spirit In You gives you a new
[1:26:31] spirit a new outlook a new Faith then he
[1:26:34] puts his holy spirit in you you know
[1:26:36] what I conclude out all this you're a
[1:26:39] lot of
[1:26:41] work when I read Ezekiel 36 again last
[1:26:44] night I thought
[1:26:47] Lord I'll just say it to you guys you're
[1:26:50] a piece of work
[1:26:53] now I look that up and that can have an
[1:26:55] A positive connotation but today it has
[1:26:58] a negative because when somebody's mad
[1:26:59] he say you're a real piece of
[1:27:01] work and Ezekiel 36 36 must say to us
[1:27:06] all of us he's got to pull you from the
[1:27:09] me he's got to give you you got a Stony
[1:27:11] heart you got a spirit that won't get

[1:27:17] will and not God's you got all of that
[1:27:19] you are a piece of work yeah
[1:27:23] and then God says but I'm taking this
[1:27:26] piece of work
[1:27:27] am and I'm going to do something with it
[1:27:30] that's right you're a lot of work but
[1:27:32] when he moves into your life he can take
[1:27:35] the worst
[1:27:36] cases blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:39] Brother Ray he can take the worst cases
[1:27:43] bring me your worst
[1:27:48] caseall see well I'm not a worst case
[1:27:50] but I'm here to tell you you're still a
[1:27:52] piece of
[1:27:54] work you got things friends I could take
[1:27:57] the next hour start with myself and
[1:28:00] start to go through when you
[1:28:02] come you come with a mind that's been
[1:28:05] against God you come with a bitterness
[1:28:08] you come with people hurting you you've
[1:28:10] got baggage Galore right true you come
[1:28:14] with a lack of trust you come I minister
[1:28:17] to
[1:28:19] people the Holy Spirit ministers through
[1:28:21] me
[1:28:23] to a lot of people that come from
[1:28:24] hurtful situations hallu and I hear
[1:28:27] their past erupt when they get angry
[1:28:29] about something or when I would preach
[1:28:31] or when something would happen similar
[1:28:33] to their past this volcano erupts and
[1:28:36] they spill out this thing and they're
[1:28:38] they're not healed from it yet right I'm
[1:28:41] glad God's put me in this place to
[1:28:44] minister praise the Lord to people who
[1:28:47] need healing by the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:28:51] you're all a piece of work right and I
[1:28:53] am too yes that's the TR but God says
[1:28:57] I'll take the worst cases whatever you
[1:28:59] have that's what he did in the healing
[1:29:01] lines bring me the worst case yeah they
[1:29:04] put it in the papers bring your worst
[1:29:06] case bring somebody that doctors is
[1:29:08] labeled they're almost gone they're
[1:29:09] dying bring your if God was saying that
[1:29:12] through the prophet of this hour and he
[1:29:13] could say it in a healing line bring the
[1:29:16] worst cancer cases bring the bring bring
[1:29:18] the people that are blind I've seen the
[1:29:20] blind eyes open I've seen the dead
[1:29:23] raised I can testify of it take your
[1:29:26] worst case and God says I rose with
[1:29:29] healing in my wings bring your worst
[1:29:31] cases because it wasn't brother brandom
[1:29:34] it was God saying I am God I'll take the
[1:29:37] worst
[1:29:40] case so if he takes the worst case
[1:29:42] physically then he takes the worst case
[1:29:45] for The Souls of
[1:29:49] men problem is was people don't think
[1:29:51] that they're a piece of work come on
[1:29:53] pretty good oh the media team was
[1:29:56] putting out that little clip of me
[1:29:57] saying and it's went a lot of places me
[1:29:59] saying I'm a good old brother Paul I'm a
[1:30:01] pretty good boy and all this stuff you
[1:30:03] need a new birth
[1:30:05] yeah good old boys never make it to
[1:30:08] Heaven it's the Holy Ghost filled boys
[1:30:12] and young men and young women that are
[1:30:14] going to be in a Rapture yes but I'm
[1:30:16] good I was good to my parents and I'm
[1:30:18] taking care of I'm doing and you got
[1:30:19] your whole list of stuff that build up
[1:30:21] say
[1:30:22] you get to the Pearly Gates and you say
[1:30:24] man here's my list I'm ready to go but
[1:30:28] did did you accept simply the blood of
[1:30:30] Jesus Christ for your sin did you
[1:30:33] receive my spirit that was poured out
[1:30:35] from
[1:30:36] Calvary I didn't think I needed that
[1:30:39] because I've been a decent person you
[1:30:42] need the new
[1:30:44] birth you need to be born
[1:30:47] again so God is determined to take the
[1:30:49] worst cases God's determined to live in
[1:30:51] you you it's not a problem for God you
[1:30:54] see you're not determined when you come
[1:30:56] in he's determined thankfully somebody's
[1:30:59] determined here because when you first
[1:31:01] come to him you're not that determined
[1:31:03] you're not determined to receive a
[1:31:04] spirit you're not determined to change
[1:31:07] but God was determined for your life you
[1:31:10] went way out somewhere you went you said
[1:31:12] I'm leaving this thing I'm leaving this
[1:31:14] truth but guess what and when you
[1:31:15] weren't determined when you weren't
[1:31:17] determined even to come back God was
[1:31:19] determined for you
[1:31:22] God had a determination for your life
[1:31:25] hallelujah hallelujah and so we see then
[1:31:28] you see it's what we can it's not what
[1:31:31] we can do but it's what we believe when
[1:31:33] we submit to him to let him have his way
[1:31:35] to get desperate for ourselves to get
[1:31:37] desperate for God I want this Holy Ghost
[1:31:39] living in me say it to him this morning
[1:31:41] I want this Holy Ghost living in me I
[1:31:44] want to be filled with this Holy Ghost
[1:31:46] do you see do you know this work is a
[1:31:49] sec this work of the Holy Spirit moving
[1:31:51] into our lives CU I want to talk about
[1:31:53] when the holy spirit moves into your
[1:31:54] life just like he moves to bring a
[1:31:56] message he moved in the days of Christ
[1:31:58] for his birth and he begin to move he
[1:32:00] gave Joseph A Dream the Holy Ghost the
[1:32:02] Holy Ghost was doing a lot of things but
[1:32:04] it was the Holy Ghost moving because
[1:32:05] he's getting ready to bring the Messiah
[1:32:07] and do something great so the when the
[1:32:09] Holy Ghost begins to move into your life
[1:32:11] eventually eventually great things begin
[1:32:14] to happen but when he begins to move
[1:32:16] it's so similar do you know that when
[1:32:19] the Holy Ghost moves in your life we
[1:32:22] find it in the second verse of your
[1:32:31] Bible what I'm preaching and teaching on
[1:32:33] a series on the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:32:35] second verse of your Bible that
[1:32:38] says you should know it because you
[1:32:40] learned it in Sunday School in the
[1:32:42] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:32:45] Earth and the Earth was without
[1:32:48] form and void empty
[1:32:52] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:32:56] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:33:00] the face of those Waters
[1:33:04] Glory he already did it for this Earth
[1:33:08] that's the condition it was in that's
[1:33:09] the condition you were in but I was
[1:33:11] raised in the message Darkness was upon
[1:33:13] the face of your deep Darkness was on
[1:33:15] the face of your deep your soul Darkness
[1:33:19] covers
[1:33:19] it Lord yeah and you you you would have
[1:33:23] stayed that way but guess what happened
[1:33:24] the Holy Ghost moved
[1:33:27] in might have happened 10 years ago
[1:33:30] might be happening this morning but when
[1:33:32] he begins to move upon the face of the
[1:33:34] waters what be to happen he took chaos
[1:33:38] are you listening he took darkness when
[1:33:41] he moved on it he took chaos and he made
[1:33:44] it an
[1:33:46] Eden so if he did that to the Earth why
[1:33:49] would he just do it to the Earth
[1:33:52] you're his
[1:33:53] people so if he moved upon the face of
[1:33:56] the water and he began to do something
[1:33:59] for for the earth to make an Eden to
[1:34:01] take a chaos to take a piece of work
[1:34:04] like you and turn it into an Eden a
[1:34:07] fruitful place where God can speak
[1:34:10] through you and God can use you and you
[1:34:12] can be cleansed and and all these other
[1:34:14] things if God did that to the Earth then
[1:34:16] he can make an Eden in your life as
[1:34:19] well by what the holy ghost moving upon
[1:34:22] your life some of you can raise your
[1:34:25] hand and say I I felt his touch that he
[1:34:28] was near me even when I was a child oh
[1:34:31] yeah oh yeah I almost died in this
[1:34:34] certain incident but I knew God stepped
[1:34:36] in and preserved my
[1:34:37] life and that's why I think we should
[1:34:40] never we should be careful to say God's
[1:34:42] not working in my life in this current
[1:34:43] trial because it don't take very long
[1:34:45] for you to look back in your life and
[1:34:47] say God in your
[1:34:49] life God was here God was there God had
[1:34:52] a purpose here God God moveed and then
[1:34:54] he begins to really move into your life
[1:34:57] and when he really begins to move and
[1:34:59] start to take the rough edges off a
[1:35:02] little bit you squirm a little bit in
[1:35:09] church and for some reason you sat on
[1:35:11] the front row you probably shouldn't
[1:35:13] have because it's if you're under
[1:35:15] conviction it's worse up
[1:35:18] here you start to squirm in your
[1:35:22] seat and you're not squirming because
[1:35:25] you're sitting by Hannah you're
[1:35:26] squirming because the conviction of the
[1:35:28] Holy
[1:35:30] Spirit and and and people they run from
[1:35:34] that they scare from
[1:35:35] it some of you grw up in the message
[1:35:37] call it condemnation I'm feeling
[1:35:38] condemned so I'm getting out of here
[1:35:40] could it be
[1:35:41] conviction could it be that the Holy
[1:35:44] Spirit was trying to draw You by a
[1:35:47] correction call for something and you
[1:35:50] may scorm there's no problem problem
[1:35:51] with squirming but just realize what's
[1:35:54] going on it might be the Holy Ghost
[1:35:57] moved upon the face of the waters the
[1:36:00] Holy Ghost moved upon
[1:36:04] you people attacking to say oh he's
[1:36:06] preaching at my kids or he's preaching
[1:36:08] at
[1:36:09] me I say be careful right that it isn't
[1:36:13] the biblical way of how God draws a
[1:36:18] heart so all of you have felt that
[1:36:20] little squirming haven't you oh yeah
[1:36:22] when God first to deal with you because
[1:36:24] everything he's going to bring you is
[1:36:25] contrary to your whole Spirit right you
[1:36:28] see but but you say I'm GNA go with this
[1:36:31] because he's starting to work on my
[1:36:32] heart then he breaks the heart and you
[1:36:34] you begin you were going to run out the
[1:36:36] door never come back again but you begin
[1:36:38] to cry I'm sorry sister annna was beside
[1:36:41] me not Hannah
[1:36:44] Hallelujah instead of running away
[1:36:47] something happens and you just start to
[1:36:49] recognize man if I leave this place then
[1:36:53] my life stays the
[1:36:55] same but something's happened to me and
[1:36:57] I'm weeping and I'm crying I'm feeling
[1:36:58] bad for what I've done that's not a bad
[1:37:02] thing it's good it's not bad it's good
[1:37:06] that's right it's good like Ellie says
[1:37:09] it's not bad it's
[1:37:14] good don't
[1:37:17] underestimate what the Lord is doing to
[1:37:19] move upon your life don't run from it
[1:37:22] embrace it because Millions won't feel
[1:37:25] that but you're feeling it you're
[1:37:27] feeling God's doing something in
[1:37:30] meise Lord Brother Paul you don't know
[1:37:34] what I've been
[1:37:36] through and I respond to you and say you
[1:37:39] don't know my
[1:37:44] God
[1:37:46] hallelujah hallu this this mystery of
[1:37:50] him coming in you and coming in a piece
[1:37:53] of work and beginning and and then
[1:37:55] wanting to live in a piece of work uh
[1:37:57] Wednesday night we heard it by our
[1:37:59] brother the Tabernacle the Throne of God
[1:38:02] type of Jesus being the Tabernacle we
[1:38:04] also a tabernacle had three parts to it
[1:38:06] like we have three parts if you've
[1:38:07] studied the Old Testament Tabernacle it
[1:38:09] types the New Testament Tabernacle he
[1:38:11] comes in human beings and His glory
[1:38:13] comes down in the holy of holies comes
[1:38:15] down in your soul that's the Holy Ghost
[1:38:17] but brother landland brought out that
[1:38:19] it's interesting that this whole
[1:38:21] Tabernacle that was overlaid with gold
[1:38:23] on the inside which means deity but then
[1:38:26] did you see how God put covered it all
[1:38:28] up with Badger
[1:38:33] skins Badger
[1:38:36] skins and if we look at it this mystery
[1:38:38] of him coming in you is all through the
[1:38:41] Bible even back to that Tabernacle to
[1:38:44] Badger skins covering this deity that
[1:38:47] God would say in his mystery that I will
[1:38:49] come and live in people that were
[1:38:53] Badgers before all right they're not
[1:38:56] Badgers anymore but I'm going to leave
[1:38:59] the skin to show that my glory can live
[1:39:02] in Badger
[1:39:03] skins cuz until we get a new body we're
[1:39:07] still in these Badger
[1:39:10] skins that's good did you know that a
[1:39:12] badger why did God choose Badger skins I
[1:39:16] found out last night that Badgers we
[1:39:19] know in the world is the one of of the
[1:39:21] most meanest
[1:39:24] animals I mean when I read about them I
[1:39:26] never want to meet one they are they're
[1:39:29] they're the meanest animal they're made
[1:39:30] the most Fearless animal animal and
[1:39:33] sometimes they can actually uh scare
[1:39:36] away a lion which is amazing because
[1:39:38] lion he's the king of the jungle you
[1:39:40] know he can do this but in some
[1:39:41] instances they can do the right thing
[1:39:43] because they are the meanest their
[1:39:45] meanness alone would scare even a
[1:39:49] lion and he will he he will and here's a
[1:39:53] picture okay you don't want to meet up
[1:39:56] with one of these fellas this is what
[1:40:06] he this is what God Said to put around
[1:40:10] the deity of the Tabernacle to show what
[1:40:14] you
[1:40:18] were get back stay away from me come on
[1:40:21] you don't mess and they say they have
[1:40:24] different different Badgers they have
[1:40:26] honey badgers I don't know why they call
[1:40:28] them honey badgers there's no honey
[1:40:30] about them maybe they can be sweet for a
[1:40:32] minute and then they turn on you I know
[1:40:33] people can do that oh they can loving
[1:40:36] you speak shake your hand and all that
[1:40:37] but then they can turn on you oh yeah oh
[1:40:40] my I love you brother Paul I love you oh
[1:40:42] we we support you and all
[1:40:44] these but but but oh my
[1:40:49] goodness they're sweet only a name but
[1:40:52] but this animal would tear you to pieces
[1:40:54] he would tear you up American Badgers
[1:40:56] are some of the worst and they're they
[1:40:58] say they're bad-tempered and they're
[1:41:04] grumpy they don't retreat from any
[1:41:09] fight they will not Retreat it doesn't
[1:41:11] matter if it's the worst snake hey
[1:41:13] snakes they have no fear of they're
[1:41:15] going to they're going to and here's
[1:41:16] that here's what they say about them
[1:41:18] these guys they're going to not Retreat
[1:41:21] from a fight because they haven't
[1:41:22] they're going to they're going to fight
[1:41:24] and they're going to win the
[1:41:26] fight and most of them they do no matter
[1:41:29] what animal it is they
[1:41:30] win I've seen videos of them I mean I
[1:41:33] really researched this for
[1:41:35] y'all I don't want to come up to one of
[1:41:37] these things but I'm wondering if I come
[1:41:39] up to them sometimes and I know this is
[1:41:42] what we were they're the meanest animal
[1:41:44] because without God guess what the
[1:41:46] prophet said without god without the
[1:41:49] holy ghost man can be become like a
[1:41:51] beast and rape a
[1:41:55] woman true so it's the meanest animal
[1:41:59] it's what God Said in here it's grumpy
[1:42:01] it's bad-tempered and they don't retreat
[1:42:03] from a fight they like to fight they
[1:42:05] like to kill in the fight they they like
[1:42:07] to win they don't they must not feel the
[1:42:10] pain I I've seen videos of them getting
[1:42:12] bit by a snake but they have this immune
[1:42:15] system built up to the poison even and
[1:42:17] they're going to keep because the fight
[1:42:19] is more important than the bite that
[1:42:20] they just receive from a snake I watch
[1:42:22] snake bite them in the face and they
[1:42:24] keep fighting until they put those those
[1:42:27] teeth in that snake and take them for
[1:42:30] dinner and they've been even poisoned
[1:42:32] already winning is important to
[1:42:35] them oh who wasn't Moody he said when
[1:42:38] are we going to stop in the ministry in
[1:42:40] the church stop trying to win arguments
[1:42:43] and start winning
[1:42:45] Souls can I get an amen when in the
[1:42:49] message are we going to quit trying to
[1:42:51] win arguments and quit having quote
[1:42:53] battles and try to win some souls for
[1:42:56] the
[1:42:58] Lord more important to kill prey than to
[1:43:01] be hurt they don't care about being hurt
[1:43:03] they're going to stay in the fight even
[1:43:04] the biggest snake can bite them it don't
[1:43:06] affect them they never leave a fight
[1:43:08] that they have started they can chase
[1:43:10] the Lions away sometimes God takes the
[1:43:12] meanest animal and puts that in the
[1:43:14] mystery I'm going to put my I'm going to
[1:43:17] change your spirit I'm going to I'm
[1:43:19] going to put my Spirit within this the
[1:43:22] the the ark was covered around with
[1:43:24] Badger skin notice the only thing left
[1:43:26] now listen the only thing left with this
[1:43:28] was the Skins the badger had to be
[1:43:32] killed your old Nature has to be killed
[1:43:36] your Badger ways has to be
[1:43:39] killed the only thing left was the skins
[1:43:41] for God to say I'm putting my deity in
[1:43:45] Badger
[1:43:47] skins this is to remind us how mean we
[1:43:50] really are against God and God's grace
[1:43:52] says but I wanted to say I can put my
[1:43:56] deity in Badger
[1:43:59] skins that's a
[1:44:01] miracle that's a
[1:44:03] mystery that's the mystery of God Christ
[1:44:06] in you huj the hope of Glory Hallelujah
[1:44:09] can I get an amen this
[1:44:11] morning Hallelujah I preach as long as I
[1:44:13] got a voice and it's starting to go but
[1:44:15] I just want to finish this God has to do
[1:44:17] a lot to us you got a Stony heart you
[1:44:19] got a spirit that rebells else you
[1:44:21] resist you you got a mind dirty minds we
[1:44:24] come with a lot of things and a heart
[1:44:26] filled with other things and after we
[1:44:28] read all this the conclusion is you're a
[1:44:30] real piece of work you really are a lot
[1:44:32] of baggage a lot of stuff anybody ever
[1:44:35] read this scripture in Psalms 39:5 it
[1:44:38] says behold thou Hast made my days as a
[1:44:41] hand breath and my age is as nothing
[1:44:43] before thee verily every man at his best
[1:44:47] state is allog together vanity
[1:44:52] wow I think we should say Amen to that
[1:44:54] one too it's in the Bible take him at
[1:44:56] his very best state and his emptiness
[1:44:59] without
[1:45:01] God I've been successful brother Paul
[1:45:04] I'm doing I'm doing a good job I do
[1:45:05] praise the Lord but you say now without
[1:45:07] God it doesn't mean
[1:45:09] anything man at his best state it's
[1:45:12] still vanity there's still nothing to it
[1:45:15] so we can't properly fix ourselves the
[1:45:20] sin natur inside before we did anything
[1:45:22] wrong you could put kids in the best
[1:45:23] environment and still there's no change
[1:45:26] on the inside you are a real piece of
[1:45:28] work but I know a spirit that can move
[1:45:31] on your life and he can turn chaos into
[1:45:33] Eden if you will let him he will do that
[1:45:36] with you how many believe
[1:45:39] it piece of work piece of work
[1:45:44] Masterpiece and the prophet goes down
[1:45:46] that line he actually called that
[1:45:47] message his Masterpiece sermon the
[1:45:49] Masterpiece cuz he took it took it from
[1:45:51] Adam and Adam and Eve was his
[1:45:53] Masterpiece family son and daughter of
[1:45:56] God without sin standing there as
[1:45:57] controllers of the earth then sin came
[1:45:59] in marred the Masterpiece then he took
[1:46:02] 2,000 years to build his Masterpiece
[1:46:04] back again and Christ was the second
[1:46:06] Adam then he births the church which was
[1:46:10] a piece of the
[1:46:11] master right when he pierced that sear
[1:46:15] put that pierced him with in the side
[1:46:18] with a sword with a spear that blood
[1:46:21] came out he took the spirit in that
[1:46:22] brought it back on 120 Believers you
[1:46:24] were a piece of the master then they
[1:46:27] begin at Pentecost and for 2,000 years
[1:46:29] Satan gets in the church and now becomes
[1:46:31] marred becomes Church systems all these
[1:46:32] other things but God says I will restore
[1:46:35] and says I will take that people and I
[1:46:37] will build my masterpiece off of the
[1:46:40] piece of the
[1:46:41] Masterpiece you are a piece of work but
[1:46:44] God takes the piece of work it says I'll
[1:46:46] make a masterpiece out of the piece of
[1:46:49] work
[1:46:51] yeah so you start out he says that
[1:46:55] Masterpiece that Masterpiece he wants to
[1:46:58] build it's a process but he's going to
[1:47:01] have a masterpiece how many still with
[1:47:04] me bring that picture up this is how it
[1:47:06] starts
[1:47:08] here when you're talking about a statue
[1:47:11] then this is where it
[1:47:13] starts a big chunk of marble out of the
[1:47:19] Quarry
[1:47:21] just grabs a big chunk cuts the big
[1:47:23] chunk this is what you look like you
[1:47:26] don't look like a masterpiece yet that's
[1:47:28] right you're Rough Around the
[1:47:31] Edges you're all
[1:47:33] dirty Ezekiel says I got to put sprinkle
[1:47:36] clean water on you yeah God sends the
[1:47:39] tractors out pulls you out he says I'll
[1:47:42] take you from all the nations take you
[1:47:43] from all the countries out cut you out
[1:47:45] of that look at all the other Stone back
[1:47:48] there but he predestination he cut you
[1:47:50] you out of there with the tractor and
[1:47:52] brings you away from all the rest of the
[1:47:54] stone so he can begin to mold your life
[1:47:56] thank you Jesus then he cuts you down to
[1:47:59] the next one and makes a smaller Stone
[1:48:01] and he begins to work in your life
[1:48:03] chipping with the special tools and
[1:48:05] begins to work something's in there as
[1:48:07] he said about Michelangelo doing Moses
[1:48:09] he said he's seen a vision of what Moses
[1:48:11] he's seen the vision of Moses in the
[1:48:13] stone right he's seen something in the
[1:48:15] stone that you couldn't see only the
[1:48:17] only the uh only Michelangelo could see
[1:48:21] it and because he had the vision of it
[1:48:23] he's the only one qualified to stand
[1:48:25] there and chisel and away at your life
[1:48:28] God's the only one qualified to Chisel
[1:48:31] away at your life and to deal with you
[1:48:34] man should not deal with souls and Men
[1:48:37] God should deal with you he knows how to
[1:48:39] deal with you he loves you in the right
[1:48:42] way and you need to go to the next when
[1:48:44] you start to see something forming after
[1:48:47] a while something begins to form in your
[1:48:49] life
[1:48:50] because you're under the hand of the
[1:48:52] Potter you're under the hand of that
[1:48:54] great architect that great one that
[1:48:55] sculptor that seeing the vision there
[1:48:58] can you say praise the
[1:49:00] Lord hallelujah make sure you listen to
[1:49:02] that message the Masterpiece and then
[1:49:04] finally takes out of that and brings a
[1:49:07] bride in the last days a bride Perfect
[1:49:11] Bride without spot without wrinkle
[1:49:13] without blemish can you say
[1:49:17] Amen before you were a piece of work
[1:49:21] now you're really truly a piece of
[1:49:23] work but you're a piece of his
[1:49:27] work reason I chose this one is
[1:49:30] not and not Michelangelo's Moses is
[1:49:34] because this is what he's molding right
[1:49:39] now it's a
[1:49:41] bride a piece of the master can you say
[1:49:44] Amen you're a piece of work but now
[1:49:47] you're a piece of his work but a work of
[1:49:49] a divine sculpture Jesus Christ and we
[1:49:52] see in the last days it's the build a
[1:49:54] bride if he built the first Adam then he
[1:49:57] can rebuild the rebuild the bring the
[1:49:59] first Adam the second Adam then he can
[1:50:01] rebuild the first Eve and bring her back
[1:50:03] again and the way brother said is if it
[1:50:05] was Adam and Eve together that made the
[1:50:07] first Masterpiece family when
[1:50:09] Michelangelo was moved by by what he
[1:50:12] created that the vision was so perfect
[1:50:15] after he had finished it how many knows
[1:50:17] what he did to the Statue it was so real
[1:50:21] to the image in his mind that he struck
[1:50:24] it and he said
[1:50:27] speak praise the
[1:50:31] Lord final voice to the final age is the
[1:50:34] Bride of Jesus
[1:50:36] Christ and he's molding your life so
[1:50:39] that you come so much to the image of
[1:50:41] Jesus Christ thank you God says where am
[1:50:44] I going to speak now I'm going to speak
[1:50:46] through this
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:48] bride I'm going to use this bride I'm
[1:50:51] going to speak through this
[1:50:56] bride and now for 2,000 years brother
[1:50:59] Bram says nearly 2,000 years God has
[1:51:00] been making him a masterpiece because he
[1:51:02] struck Adam a piece off of him a part of
[1:51:05] him a rib to make a wife for him and now
[1:51:07] that perfect Masterpiece that he struck
[1:51:09] at Calvary he got a piece off of him for
[1:51:12] it's it's this new testament that's all
[1:51:14] he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's
[1:51:16] the New Testament another piece to be
[1:51:17] fulfilled as it is taken him for 4,000
[1:51:20] years to make this masterpiece now he's
[1:51:23] been for nearly 2,000 years making
[1:51:25] another Masterpiece a bride for Christ
[1:51:28] another Masterpiece in so doing he does
[1:51:30] it by his never changing method the same
[1:51:33] way he did he made the Masterpiece his
[1:51:35] word that's the way he makes his
[1:51:37] masterpieces because he is he can only
[1:51:40] be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the
[1:51:42] perfect word he started on the day of
[1:51:44] Pentecost to build another Masterpiece
[1:51:46] The Original Seed word started in the
[1:51:48] first church what was it the seed what
[1:51:50] was he starting it by the Holy Ghost the
[1:51:52] seed the word the words the word
[1:51:54] manifested the promise that been given
[1:51:56] Joel said it shall come to pass in the
[1:51:58] last days say a God I will pour out my
[1:52:01] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[1:52:03] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:52:06] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[1:52:08] see Visions how many see in that
[1:52:09] scripture how many see that it's the
[1:52:11] young people
[1:52:13] too what we he would do in the last days
[1:52:16] as the Masterpiece fell there is a
[1:52:18] masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell
[1:52:22] at Pentecost at niia Rome at Nia after
[1:52:25] niia Rome she's come through a process
[1:52:27] but she is coming right back again to
[1:52:30] that Masterpiece perfected cuz she's a
[1:52:32] part of that word that was spoken by him
[1:52:35] he'll have a church without spot or
[1:52:38] without wrinkle
[1:52:40] thank
[1:52:43] Hallelujah
[1:52:45] Glory he took a piece of himself at
[1:52:48] Calvary it took a piece to make make
[1:52:50] another Masterpiece if that is the final
[1:52:52] goal of God if you're a part of that
[1:52:54] then won't he be molding your life by
[1:52:57] the Holy Ghost and filling you with the
[1:52:59] Holy Ghost he will mold you and fill you
[1:53:02] by his spirit and he's determined to
[1:53:04] have this masterpiece his Masterpiece
[1:53:07] God will make you willing you are a
[1:53:09] piece of work by his grace a bride by
[1:53:11] Grace not by works I will remind you of
[1:53:14] one quote that was quoted to us last
[1:53:16] Sunday by Brother Craig five is the
[1:53:19] number of Grace
[1:53:20] j s u s g r a c f AI t h so forth the
[1:53:26] number of Grace the last quote God ever
[1:53:29] sends if God ever sends his power to the
[1:53:34] church it'll be his grace It Won't Be
[1:53:38] The Obedience of the
[1:53:40] people did anybody catch that it's a
[1:53:43] pretty powerful
[1:53:46] quote so whose hand are we under the
[1:53:49] hand of
[1:53:52] Grace if he changes you gives you a new
[1:53:54] spirit it's the Lord that does it and
[1:53:57] then he fills you with the spirit it's
[1:53:58] the hand of Grace on your life it's the
[1:54:01] hand of
[1:54:02] Grace he says if God sends his power to
[1:54:06] the church how many want
[1:54:09] that it'll be his grace It Won't Be The
[1:54:12] Obedience of the people and Isaiah said
[1:54:15] the 40th chapter cried to jerus
[1:54:17] Jerusalem that her Warfare was over yet
[1:54:20] she was guilty of idolatry but it was
[1:54:23] God's grace that was sending it God
[1:54:25] sends anything to us it'll be by his
[1:54:29] grace and not our own merits now I think
[1:54:34] we should be obedient yes but at the end
[1:54:36] of the day it's you surrendering your
[1:54:39] lives at the end of the day it's his
[1:54:41] handiwork we are his workmanship it's
[1:54:43] his grace and as we keep surrendering to
[1:54:48] that as we keep y yielding to
[1:54:51] that he'll provide all that's needed for
[1:54:54] the rest of the
[1:54:56] journey before I close I want to say
[1:54:58] again this is an individual work in your
[1:55:00] life you and
[1:55:02] God am it's you and God and when you
[1:55:05] meet him someday it'll be you and God
[1:55:08] you're not going to come in with the
[1:55:10] literal life and we all come in as a
[1:55:12] church you know you just you tag along
[1:55:15] my coattails I knew brother Paul so we
[1:55:18] all just stand before God no no no no no
[1:55:22] it' Be
[1:55:23] You prise Lord it' be you and the
[1:55:27] question
[1:55:28] is did you love me enough because he
[1:55:30] loved you you knew that did you love me
[1:55:32] enough to respond back and let his work
[1:55:35] come in your life his grace it's an
[1:55:38] individual it's not doing the big things
[1:55:41] I'm going to share this quick testimony
[1:55:45] before I close and I've I've taken your
[1:55:49] time this morning morning I
[1:55:51] appreciate you being so attentive
[1:55:53] especially to somebody who has a
[1:55:54] scratchy voice I don't like to hear
[1:55:56] somebody like it I gets
[1:56:01] irritating couple weeks ago I found out
[1:56:03] that there was this real godly woman
[1:56:07] named
[1:56:08] AA um
[1:56:11] Ogden AA Ogden AA douly Ogden her ma
[1:56:16] maiden name was
[1:56:17] douly and she very gifted woman come to
[1:56:21] find out she wrote about 3,000 poems and
[1:56:24] hymns and in the 1900s and she 1800 late
[1:56:29] in 1800s
[1:56:30] 1900s and
[1:56:34] she she wanted to go on a revi her and
[1:56:36] her husband wanted to go with a tour
[1:56:38] which was a Revival and be in Revival
[1:56:39] meetings and tent meetings whatever they
[1:56:41] were doing it's a special revival going
[1:56:43] around the country she had gifts to do
[1:56:44] it she had gifts to use and contribute
[1:56:47] to the Revival to do something big like
[1:56:50] that was their desire and come to find
[1:56:52] out she was a school teacher her and her
[1:56:53] husband a Sunday school teacher in
[1:56:55] Toledo for I think 20 or 30
[1:56:59] years and then as they were making plans
[1:57:01] to go do that they were going to go do
[1:57:03] that then all of a sudden her dad got a
[1:57:06] stroke and so I think she had to bring
[1:57:08] him from Iowa and she began to have to
[1:57:10] take care of them they had a they had a
[1:57:12] summer home and they had a little cabin
[1:57:14] beside the home it was attached to the
[1:57:16] house and so she brought her dad there
[1:57:19] and she began to realize that her life
[1:57:22] would change and she would not get to go
[1:57:23] and do something that big she would not
[1:57:26] get to go that Ministry with her husband
[1:57:27] that she really wanted to
[1:57:29] do so AA was caught there taking 247
[1:57:33] taking care of her father and what I
[1:57:36] didn't know is that that home I just
[1:57:38] seen it a few days ago is only three
[1:57:40] miles from this church on Summerfield
[1:57:42] Road the summer home just outside Toledo
[1:57:46] she was right here and so in that time
[1:57:49] as when she wrote a song most of you
[1:57:50] young people are not going to go know
[1:57:52] but some of you older ones know she
[1:57:54] wrote in 1912 in that cabin with her dad
[1:57:56] taking care of them she wrote the song
[1:57:59] brighten the corner where you are
[1:58:04] amen can you pull the words to that up
[1:58:07] right in the corner where you are you
[1:58:09] have
[1:58:11] that and this is what the lyrics says
[1:58:13] I'm only reading it because most of you
[1:58:15] don't know it do not wait until some
[1:58:19] deed of greatness you may do do not wait
[1:58:22] to shed your light afar to the many
[1:58:25] duties ever near near you now to be true
[1:58:29] brighten the corner where you
[1:58:37] are powerful some powerful words and she
[1:58:40] was living it
[1:58:41] out and sometimes when we get to think
[1:58:44] it as of doing big things and doing this
[1:58:46] and do that we need to think where does
[1:58:48] God want to use use me filled with his
[1:58:51] Spirit at my corner at my place because
[1:58:55] God can get even more Glory sometimes
[1:58:57] out of a simple work he she just has the
[1:59:01] on the course she says if you guys
[1:59:03] bright in the corner where you are
[1:59:04] bright in the corner someone far from
[1:59:05] Harbor you may guide across the bar
[1:59:08] brighten the corner where you are she
[1:59:11] has some other verses to it there but I
[1:59:13] thought isn't that amazing right here in
[1:59:15] our own area which we have quite a few
[1:59:18] songwriters in this church as well must
[1:59:19] be part of this road or something God
[1:59:22] draws them here a lot of music a lot of
[1:59:24] things but it is an amazing 1912 God
[1:59:28] moves her heart but we learn a lesson
[1:59:30] from her life that the Holy Spirit In
[1:59:32] Our Lives don't look for big
[1:59:36] things don't look to be
[1:59:39] seen don't look to show
[1:59:42] off just be humble and simple and say
[1:59:45] God what do you do want to do when you
[1:59:47] put this Spirit within my my
[1:59:50] life I worship you I'll serve you I'll
[1:59:53] stay on the Potter's will till you mow
[1:59:56] me into what I should be over and
[2:00:01] over he molds me and makes
[2:00:07] me
[2:00:09] into his
[2:00:11] likeness he
[2:00:14] Fashions the
[2:00:17] clay a vessel
[2:00:20] of
[2:00:23] Honor I
[2:00:25] am
[2:00:28] today and it's
[2:00:30] all because
[2:00:33] Jesus Didn't
[2:00:36] Throw the Clay Away over and over
[2:00:43] over and
[2:00:45] over he molds me
[2:00:51] this is what he does in our
[2:00:54] lives his
[2:00:57] Li he
[2:01:00] fashion the
[2:01:02] clay of the
[2:01:05] soul of
[2:01:09] H I am
[2:01:14] today and it's
[2:01:16] all because
[2:01:20] Jesus didn't
[2:01:22] throw
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:28] clay if you're not in a real hurry to go
[2:01:30] I just ask you to Bow your heads
[2:01:32] hopefully you're not in a
[2:01:35] hurry Jesus knows you this
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] morning and if you feel that the Lord
[2:01:44] said something to you this
[2:01:46] morning that you know he does know you
[2:01:49] you he does know your
[2:01:50] life that you can begin to believe that
[2:01:53] you're one of the ones that could
[2:01:57] receive this Holy Spirit in your life
[2:01:59] could receive his work and begin to work
[2:02:02] your life I believe I'm one of the
[2:02:04] candidates I believe he's calling me
[2:02:06] brother
[2:02:07] Paul I want you to stand and just lift
[2:02:10] your hand and say I'm ready to
[2:02:14] receive this Christ into my

[2:02:41] things you don't understand whether you
[2:02:43] came from the world or you grew up in
[2:02:44] the message you have things you still
[2:02:45] don't understand you have sin in your
[2:02:48] life that you don't know why you did it
[2:02:50] I wish I hadn't done it and you have no
[2:02:52] place to bring that you've just become I
[2:02:54] don't know where I can bring that so I'm
[2:02:56] just I'm numb to it I I don't know what
[2:02:57] to do with it I'm asking you to see this
[2:03:00] place that of Calvary that Jesus says
[2:03:03] you can bring it to this morning
[2:03:05] whatever it is you can bring it to him
[2:03:07] and I'm asking you to lift your hands
[2:03:09] and surrender to the Lord I am ready I'm
[2:03:13] ready to receive
[2:03:14] him I'm ready to receive him and the
[2:03:18] work that he does will be in his hands
[2:03:20] and not in my hands I yield myself to
[2:03:24] him just before we pray together you

[2:03:33] and consider this that The Potter Knows
