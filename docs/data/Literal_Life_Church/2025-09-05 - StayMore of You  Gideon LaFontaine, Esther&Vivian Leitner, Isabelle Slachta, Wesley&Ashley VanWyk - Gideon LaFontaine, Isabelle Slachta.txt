Stay

I know what it's like
To be in the presence of the Lord
And not know what time it is
Because time stood still

And bodies were healed
Families restored
Because we stayed here
In the presence of the Lord

No one had to say a word
Couldn't even make a sound
But I'd give up everything
For this treasure I've found

I never want it to end

(So I say) stay
I don't want You to go
Cause my heart is burning
In Your presence, Lord

Please, stay
I don't want You to go
'Cause my heart is burning
In Your presence, Lord

I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus, I want more

I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus, I want more

I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus, I want more

I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus, I want more

I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus, I want more

So I'll stay
Where else would I go
'Cause my heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
In Your presence, Lord

More of You

More of You, more of You
I′ve had all but what I need, just more of You
Of things, I've had my fill, and yet I hunger still
(Empty) empty and bare, Lord, hear my prayer for more of You
