On March 26, 2023, Literal Life Church hosted a community outreach event, "Hymns and Classics Sing-Along". We pressed the record button that evening and received such positive response from the community afterward that we decided to make the audio recording available for free to the public. 

Glory Road

Is this road you're traveling
Dark, deserted or dim?
Is there hope for tomorrow?
Put your trust in Him!
On this glory road I'm traveling,
Many time I've stumbled on my way.
But, Praise the Lord, I'll soon be leaving
For that land of perfect peace and endless day.

chorus
Oh, I can see the lights of home
I can see Him on His throne.
I'm too near to turn back now,
Oh, praise the Lord, I'm Heaven bound.
When my journey here shall end,
I'll say "Goodbye" to this world of sin.
In that fair land, I'll sake my stand.
It's good to be on this road for Glory Land.

chorus
Oh, I can see the lights of home
I can see Him on His throne.
I'm too near to turn back now,
Oh, praise the Lord, I'm Heaven bound.
When my journey here shall end,
I'll say "Goodbye" to this world of sin.
In that fair land, I'll sake my stand.
It's good to be on this road for Glory, on this road for Glory, on this road for Glory Land.
