[0:01] Lord Jesus we love you and what a
[0:05] privilege it is father to to be here
[0:07] with brother Paul and his family and his
[0:10] church to see what you have done father
[0:14] Lord that you have a work that you have
[0:16] established and are doing
[0:18] Lord and it's it's just our desire
[0:21] father that Lord we would let you have
[0:24] your way
[0:25] Lord that you would use Me For Your
[0:28] Glory not my own father that you would
[0:32] anoint my lips and anoint the ears of
[0:34] the year
[0:35] Lord I can only speak as what you have
[0:38] laid upon me but father you do the
[0:41] directing father may you have your way
[0:43] we already know Lord that the that your
[0:47] spirit is here there's liberty father
[0:50] and father may you just Lord go to that
[0:53] need whether it be sick Lord be a
[0:55] something that is bound to life
[0:57] something that can't move forward with
[0:59] God but Lord You're the same yesterday
[1:01] today and forever and I pray father
[1:04] you'll speak to that need in the name of
[1:07] Jesus Christ
[1:08] amen amen God bless you this evening if
[1:11] you just turn in your Bibles and
[1:16] amen I had determined that when I come I
[1:19] know some folks that are here and that
[1:21] some of them are my relatives and amen
[1:24] and I God bless you brother Joe and
[1:26] sister I I told myself I wasn't going to
[1:27] start calling names because I'm not
[1:29] going to remember them all
[1:30] and it's a certain age that you get
[1:32] brother Mark that you don't remember
[1:34] everything anymore
[1:36] but you're not laughing
[1:39] but some of us understand that better by
[1:41] and by right
[1:43] amen God is good
[1:45] amen and I appreciate him appreciate his
[1:49] love to me appreciate how he has dealt
[1:53] with me over the years and he's been
[1:55] very gracious to me and my my mistakes
[1:57] and my failures to help me and I trust
[2:00] that that he can use what we have Amen
[2:05] to help you amen grow closer to God Amen
[2:08] let's just turn to Isaiah 14.
[2:10] [Music]
[2:12] I want to read some very familiar
[2:14] scriptures to you
[2:22] Isaiah 14.
[2:24] verse 12 we'll read down to the 17th
[2:27] verse
[2:32] how art thou fallen from Heaven o
[2:35] Lucifer
[2:37] son of the morning
[2:39] how art thou cut down to the ground
[2:41] which did weaken the Nations
[2:44] for you have said in your heart I will
[2:47] Ascend into heaven
[2:48] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[2:51] of God
[2:53] I will sit also upon the Mount of the
[2:55] congregation in the sides of the North
[2:57] I'll Ascend above the heights of the
[2:59] clouds I will be like the most high
[3:04] yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[3:08] to the sides of the pit
[3:10] they that see thee
[3:13] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[3:15] consider thee saying is this the man
[3:17] that made the Earth to tremble
[3:20] that did Shake kingdoms
[3:22] that made the world as a Wilderness and
[3:25] destroyed the cities thereof
[3:27] that open not the house of his prisoners
[3:31] amen so we see that Satan has made a
[3:34] declaration it's been exposed
[3:37] amen anybody's made a declaration that
[3:40] he would be like God be recognized like
[3:43] God but then God makes a declaration to
[3:46] say they that see thee
[3:49] shall say is this the man I don't call
[3:52] him God
[3:54] call him a man
[3:57] amen let's turn to Second Thessalonians
[3:59] 2 verse 1.
[4:09] if you're there Say Amen
[4:12] all right I've always wondered when
[4:14] somebody says that there's always
[4:15] somebody that's not there even if
[4:16] somebody says amen so anyway I'm there
[4:20] now we beseech you Brethren by the
[4:22] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[4:25] our gathering together unto him
[4:27] that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be
[4:31] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[4:34] nor by letter as from us as at the day
[4:37] of Christ is at hand
[4:39] let no man deceive you by any means for
[4:42] that day shall not come except there
[4:44] come of Falling Away first and that man
[4:47] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[4:50] who opposes and exalted himself above
[4:53] all that is called God or that is
[4:55] worshiped so that he as God sitteth in
[4:58] the temple of God
[5:00] showing himself that he is God you can
[5:03] be seated may the Lord bless the reading
[5:06] of his word I had
[5:10] took a thought from
[5:13] something brother Branham had mentioned
[5:17] and that was at the end of his
[5:22] um
[5:22] coming down to the end of his ministry
[5:25] he had referenced that he was going to
[5:27] go home
[5:28] and that he was going to preach on the
[5:31] trail of the serpent
[5:33] and so I began to look at those quotes
[5:35] and if you just
[5:37] uh uh if you just bear with me I'm going
[5:41] to title this I'm not trying to copy the
[5:43] prophet I'm just it's a good title
[5:45] so I want to use it and he said it would
[5:50] take about four hours
[5:53] um
[5:54] and I know you're still in Ireland but
[5:56] uh
[5:57] it's not going to take four hours
[6:00] um
[6:01] but with the Lord help us we just want
[6:03] to walk down this this thought if we
[6:06] cannot title it the trail of the serpent
[6:10] and I want to say to you some very
[6:12] familiar things you recognize them when
[6:15] I quote it to you but it's necessary
[6:18] uh so you can see the direction that we
[6:21] are going in uh Paul or brother Branham
[6:25] said that Isaiah saw the desire of
[6:29] Satan's heart
[6:30] and and he exposed it he said that you
[6:34] have said
[6:35] in your heart that you'll be like God
[6:40] and so here is a prophet exposing and
[6:44] this is one of the the great tools of
[6:46] God is is under the prophetic to expose
[6:51] where the enemy is
[6:54] amen because the enemy uh the enemy is a
[6:59] liar
[7:00] is that right this is his greatest
[7:02] weapon is a lie so if it's a lie it's
[7:05] not true
[7:08] and so we can understand that when when
[7:10] the prophet begin to expose him
[7:13] exposing the LIE is actually stripping
[7:16] him of any advantage
[7:19] that he might have over the ones he said
[7:22] he would be above because he made that
[7:24] statement I'll be above the sons of God
[7:27] I'm going to sit in their position I'm
[7:30] going to be worshiped and even mistaken
[7:32] for amen the almighty God
[7:36] amen and so so here is a prophet
[7:40] exposing this and brother Branham said
[7:42] Isaiah
[7:43] shows what's in his heart and he said
[7:45] Paul sees him come and take that
[7:49] position
[7:50] so you have
[7:52] thousands of years ago a prophet
[7:55] exposing his heart and then hundreds of
[7:58] years later another Prophet amen showing
[8:01] him here he's coming to his position but
[8:03] he did not come to that position until
[8:06] it's now our time
[8:08] now now God sends a prophet not just for
[8:12] us to say I have sent you a prophet but
[8:15] he sends you a prophecy so you can know
[8:17] the season you can know the time amen
[8:21] that Satan is once again exposed
[8:25] and laid bare before the congregation
[8:27] that's your estimation of him will go
[8:31] from being Godlike
[8:34] to somebody's whose abilities is just a
[8:38] man
[8:40] you know because Satan takes a hold and
[8:43] I'm speaking as a pastor Satan takes a
[8:45] hold of people's lives and he takes a
[8:48] hold through through lies through
[8:51] disease through setbacks through
[8:54] backsliding and he will use that as a
[8:57] form of manipulation to control what he
[9:01] will call your outcome but I want to
[9:04] just tell you this this evening if we
[9:06] can just start off by saying this he's a
[9:08] liar
[9:11] and we better start with him defeated
[9:13] than him having strength tonight
[9:15] amen oh I love that uh I'm just going to
[9:19] stop you know the most dangerous thing
[9:21] for Danny steaming is to fill at home
[9:24] so if you don't want me to feel at home
[9:27] I don't know what to tell you amen
[9:31] and read this someplace just I I always
[9:34] told my brother Paul and I love history
[9:36] and and I I I I I was looking back at
[9:40] the time of of Roman power and and of
[9:43] course we see their place in history we
[9:45] see their place in Prophecy not only
[9:47] natural but also spiritual but there is
[9:51] uh there's such a thing that is called a
[9:53] Roman Triumph
[9:55] now a Roman Triumph is when a general
[9:58] has went out and and he's waged War and
[10:01] the war could have took years whatever
[10:03] it is but when when when he has
[10:05] completed that that war is finished he
[10:08] is triumphed he comes back and he's
[10:11] coming back with with all all that he
[10:15] has taken from that war he's bringing
[10:17] the vanquished he's bringing their their
[10:19] weapons and they use it actually as a
[10:22] parade as a parade as they go through
[10:25] the the main street of of Rome until
[10:29] they come right up to to the form or to
[10:31] the senate or whether whatever they
[10:32] would come so this conqueror is expected
[10:35] and demanded to show proof that he's had
[10:38] success in his campaign you know these
[10:41] campaigns were before the days of
[10:42] digital before the days of obviously you
[10:45] know instant you know knowledge this was
[10:47] it could take months it could take a
[10:49] year to get some kind of information of
[10:52] what's happening out on the frontier so
[10:54] they had to have proof that this this
[10:57] General uh has waged a successful
[11:00] campaign it can't just be a letter
[11:02] it has to be proof and so he would come
[11:06] back and and he would and they said
[11:08] depending on the the the the length of
[11:11] the campaign it could take up to two
[11:13] days to show this uh Roman Triumph and
[11:16] they would they would gather and they
[11:18] would come through bringing these these
[11:21] spectacles of War
[11:23] and it was actually it was actually
[11:26] showing the vanity of the Conqueror
[11:29] because they would bring they would
[11:31] bring the spoils of a conquered nation
[11:34] and they would bring this prisoners
[11:36] hundreds of wagons and following one
[11:40] after another pictures and statues and
[11:42] all the weapons of war that they have
[11:44] conquered and then they would bring the
[11:46] people of Honor that had been conquered
[11:49] they'd bring the Chiefs the captains the
[11:52] generals the Kings and all of these
[11:54] would be following along in this
[11:57] procession and then after it all would
[11:59] come the the general of the campaign and
[12:02] he was risen to such a status because of
[12:04] his victory that he would actually have
[12:06] a slave behind him in his Chariot
[12:10] whispering in his ears are all screaming
[12:12] out to him that he's a conqueror he he
[12:15] would be they'd be talking in his ear
[12:17] and telling him so remember you're not a
[12:20] god remember you're not a God you're
[12:23] just a man because this man would begin
[12:25] to think because of the worship of the
[12:28] people all because of what he's
[12:30] accomplished in Warfare that somehow he
[12:33] could become a god
[12:36] and I want you to know the shame it
[12:38] would have been for for those captives
[12:40] as they're walking along and they've
[12:42] been defeated by this power and the
[12:45] weapons that they had put their trust in
[12:47] are being put on display
[12:49] shown that wasn't good enough
[12:54] wasn't good enough to conquer the enemy
[12:57] and they're put on display
[12:59] and then they're following behind it as
[13:01] a as a trophy of shame that I I couldn't
[13:03] overcome
[13:07] I didn't have enough
[13:09] he was too powerful for me it's just a
[13:12] show in the heart of Satan
[13:15] is that's what he wants to do is he
[13:17] wants to put on display all those who
[13:20] once used to live in Liberty
[13:24] and they had their weapons of warfare
[13:27] and he wants to show that this has no
[13:29] power anymore
[13:31] and has no influence in your life or in
[13:34] your family and he wants to parade you
[13:38] as a vessel of Shame and a conquered
[13:41] vessel and the Bible and the message and
[13:45] all of this that you once followed is
[13:47] now just put on display as something
[13:50] that doesn't have the power to overcome
[13:54] so I want to preach on the trail of the
[13:56] serpent
[13:58] because we're here to say he's a liar
[14:01] I happen to believe this message is the
[14:04] truth
[14:05] and I stake my life on it
[14:08] I mean say amen I stake my life on this
[14:11] message I don't need an internet Prophet
[14:14] I don't need somebody out there to show
[14:16] me whether this is true or not I don't
[14:19] need a man who's never experienced or
[14:20] been in any any of the meetings to say
[14:22] whether it's true or not amen because I
[14:25] met the gods that brought that message
[14:28] amen and it proved to me it is
[14:31] life-changing
[14:34] is the Lord now the prophet preached a
[14:37] message called Satan's Eden he said now
[14:39] this is Satan is here today in deceit
[14:42] it's a treacherous hour but a tremendous
[14:44] time we're living in but the most
[14:46] glorious time of all the ages because
[14:49] we're facing the Millennium again
[14:52] we're facing Eden again
[14:54] amen but right at this age all the
[14:57] deceit and every tactic that he's ever
[14:59] used and been able to deceive with he's
[15:02] gathered it all together and reinforced
[15:05] himself and come down like God
[15:09] he came down like God he's not God
[15:12] amen he's put himself in place of God
[15:16] he's religious he can quote the
[15:18] scripture he just as Satan did to Eve
[15:21] but he'll leave a spot out so that
[15:24] there's a gap he can pour poison in
[15:28] he said he would exalt himself above the
[15:31] most high he would Ascend above the
[15:33] clouds and the Stars he would sit there
[15:35] like gods and be above the most high and
[15:38] he has succeeded in carrying out his
[15:41] threats and he has had a marvelous
[15:44] success in carrying them out
[15:47] by the people
[15:50] letting him explain away
[15:54] the value
[15:56] of the word
[15:59] in every age this has been his tacky to
[16:02] explain away the value of God's promised
[16:06] word to that age
[16:08] listen he can do all he wants to explain
[16:10] away Wesley's age or or any age but it's
[16:13] this age
[16:15] where the word has its power it's this
[16:17] age where your birth under the words
[16:20] and it's this age that he will explain
[16:23] away the value
[16:25] [Music]
[16:27] hey you'll think about that the value
[16:31] now value we can all talk about
[16:33] what we value what where we place our
[16:37] treasure
[16:39] and so he says he's had a great success
[16:42] in every age he's explained away he did
[16:44] it in the days of Noah he explained
[16:46] through science he used amen science to
[16:51] prove that what Noah was saying could
[16:53] not be true
[16:56] so that began to pull away begin to pull
[16:59] away those that perhaps had gathered
[17:00] around the the message of Noah and and
[17:03] I'm sure Noah had a bigger congregation
[17:06] amen at the beginning than he did at the
[17:08] end
[17:10] because he only ended up with his family
[17:12] now it seemed like that was a powerless
[17:14] message
[17:16] but you can never say predestination is
[17:18] powerless
[17:20] amen and might it took amen 115 years
[17:24] for the eighth one to come in I don't
[17:26] know
[17:27] but it was eight that actually went over
[17:30] on the ark
[17:31] but all the rest were explained Away by
[17:35] science of that day
[17:39] and said this could not happen
[17:43] so they put a microscope on the prophecy
[17:46] of Noah
[17:48] and said it could happen explained it
[17:51] away
[17:52] they did the same in the days of Jesus
[17:55] they Satan poisoned their minds
[17:58] by misinterpreting the word to them
[18:00] saying if you are the Son of God let me
[18:04] see you do something about it
[18:07] now Satan started that with Jesus when
[18:09] he went on to the Mount of Temptation
[18:11] after he'd received the Holy Ghost at
[18:13] the river and he goes up to this
[18:15] mountain and he's tempted for 40 days
[18:17] and well he's he's there for 40 days and
[18:19] 40 nights and at the end of it Satan
[18:21] comes when he's at his weakest you've
[18:22] all heard brother Branham explain this
[18:24] but it's just fresh again to me brother
[18:26] Paul because here's a man who has the
[18:30] power he has the gift Amen to put Satan
[18:33] in his place immediately he said if I
[18:36] just call on a legion of angels can come
[18:38] he could do all of that but he never
[18:41] used one gift he never used any of that
[18:44] Heavenly ability that he had that God
[18:47] had given him and that Divine person he
[18:49] could have spoke him out of existence
[18:51] but he was concerned about your day
[18:53] about your time about the weakest person
[18:56] in this congregation he said I want to
[18:59] show them if they take a hold of the
[19:01] word it will defeat Satan any place any
[19:05] time
[19:06] everybody has a Measure of Faith
[19:08] according to what God has given you it's
[19:11] not all the same my my measure is not
[19:13] the same as Brother Paul's and your
[19:15] measure is not the same of mine I can
[19:17] only operate under what God has given me
[19:21] God does not expect you to act like
[19:24] somebody else
[19:25] but everybody can do what Jesus did
[19:28] there at that point and I want you to
[19:30] know amen that Satan amen gave him these
[19:34] three temptations that directly
[19:35] correlate lust of the flesh pride of
[19:38] life lust for the eyes every one of them
[19:40] directly correlate to the Garden of Eden
[19:42] and Jesus used two portions of scripture
[19:46] that's all he used all out of the same
[19:48] book
[19:51] he didn't quote all of Genesis he didn't
[19:53] quote all of Exodus he didn't quote all
[19:56] of Deuteronomy Oliver of numbers and
[19:59] Leviticus he didn't go on and on he
[20:01] quoted two portions of scriptures out of
[20:03] the book of Deuteronomy and the Bible
[20:04] said Satan left him for a season
[20:07] why your Prophet said the word will
[20:10] defeat him at any place anytime any
[20:12] condition
[20:15] blessed be the name of the Lord
[20:18] amen so that's what Satan done
[20:20] is he poisons their minds
[20:23] against the channel
[20:30] amen now I'm a simple person
[20:35] and uh
[20:37] I love
[20:38] I love how God forces people to get
[20:41] along with each other
[20:46] you know we all have our favorites I'm
[20:48] sure
[20:49] Minds I I'll tell you my favorite it's
[20:52] brother Branham but uh
[20:56] hope that was all right you're close
[20:59] sorry
[21:03] we better be careful right brother
[21:04] Brandon right
[21:05] amen we don't want to ruin it before we
[21:08] start
[21:10] but I thought it was it was funny you
[21:13] know that in the in the uh
[21:15] the restoration of the tempo act had
[21:17] been destroyed the first temple been
[21:19] destroyed and they were going to build a
[21:20] second and the restoration is on
[21:22] and it stopped because of the threats
[21:24] there was a law out you can't build it
[21:26] stopped so God sent him Prophets
[21:29] he sent him two
[21:31] two that prophesied at the same time
[21:35] and I thought it was amazing because
[21:36] he's so opposite of each other hagiai
[21:39] and Zacharias two totally different I
[21:41] mean you look at Zechariah he's in
[21:43] heaven the whole time
[21:45] have envisions
[21:48] right
[21:49] let me know what I'm talking about
[21:51] amen right seven Visions he's at the
[21:54] Throne of God he's seeing Joshua the
[21:56] high priest there he's seeing Satan
[21:58] standing there he's having all these
[21:59] visions and there's hagiah the old man
[22:03] he's down there saying hey get up there
[22:05] on the mountain and chop some wood
[22:08] which which prophet would you follow
[22:14] we all want the vision we don't want to
[22:16] chop Woods amen but they're both whom
[22:19] God sent and they both came together and
[22:20] God used both of them to accomplish his
[22:22] purpose God is using a five-fold
[22:24] ministry as a dress wear of the church
[22:26] every one of them is different and every
[22:28] one of them God says they're my people
[22:30] they're not your people
[22:32] amen and God has put it there shall we
[22:35] all come in the unity of the faith and
[22:38] the faith is his faith it's not ours
[22:40] it's his in fact our faith doesn't work
[22:43] it's his faith that must come into you
[22:46] and that's why amen amen Satan wants to
[22:49] take that from you
[22:52] and he's had great success and take it
[22:55] away the value of the word
[22:59] Jesus made this statement that Satan has
[23:02] no part in me
[23:03] can find nothing in me brother random
[23:05] said it like this he said the devil
[23:07] Jesus said he has no part in me and I
[23:09] have no part in him and the devil would
[23:11] like to prove that different
[23:13] we'd like to say that's not true he'd
[23:15] like to say I have something in him and
[23:17] he has something in me he'd like to say
[23:18] we're equal
[23:20] that we're equal in our ways and we're
[23:22] when I say he's not equal
[23:25] Amen in fact when the Bible says in the
[23:27] Book of Job that he came to present
[23:28] himself among amongst the sons of God
[23:31] he's not God he's not equal he's a
[23:35] created being
[23:39] yet somehow he's convinced the people he
[23:43] has as much power as God or more
[23:48] amen now Satan would like to prove that
[23:50] different but he cannot so he does all
[23:53] he can to destroy confidence in the
[23:57] words
[23:58] but when the church disbelieves Satan
[24:01] so he's sowing that the church some
[24:04] point is believing what Satan is telling
[24:06] them
[24:06] but when they disbelieve Satan and
[24:09] believe the spiritual revelation of the
[24:12] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[24:14] against her
[24:16] and brother bam talks about his ministry
[24:18] and how in the ministry amen Satan would
[24:21] be exposed and it would be through
[24:23] discernment and so forth that Satan
[24:25] would be exposed and he hates being
[24:27] exposed
[24:29] amen he said it's not mind reading it's
[24:32] not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's a
[24:35] revelation by the Holy Ghost that's the
[24:39] only way I know of and he said in the
[24:41] reason that he hates the Book of
[24:43] Revelation in the Book of Genesis is
[24:45] because they show where he came into the
[24:47] church and it shows where he's ended
[24:50] so he hates them so he attacks them in
[24:53] any way he can to destroy the church's
[24:56] confidence in the word now we can see
[25:00] that on a large scale we can see how
[25:02] Satan has destroyed confidence in
[25:04] America in the Bible in church going we
[25:07] can see it in politics we don't need God
[25:09] Amen we don't need to pray anymore
[25:12] there's no there's no confidence in God
[25:14] anymore that's on a national scale but
[25:17] on a church scale and then on a Believer
[25:19] scale he's doing the same thing
[25:22] by causing the people to lack confidence
[25:25] in what God has said and is doing
[25:29] he said but amen and I'm skipping ahead
[25:31] this is a long a long quote but I just
[25:33] want to lay these things in there he
[25:35] said he knows that if the people get the
[25:37] true revelation of the true church and
[25:39] what she is and what she stands for and
[25:42] that she can do the Greater Works amen
[25:46] she will be an invincible Army
[25:49] now I'm not saying you're not and I'm
[25:50] not saying I'm not I'm just talking to
[25:52] individuals now amen she will be an
[25:55] invincible Army if they get a true
[25:58] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[26:01] framework of the Christian Church
[26:03] there's a true spirit in the framework
[26:06] of the church and there's a false Spirit
[26:09] eating away at the confidence in the
[26:12] true spirit
[26:15] amen
[26:17] when they do
[26:18] he'll be he said they get that true
[26:20] Revelation and by God's spirit discern
[26:23] and withstand the Antichrist spirit
[26:26] will be powerless before her
[26:29] I think about put you in her
[26:31] he will be powerless before you
[26:37] what a what a glorious revelation
[26:42] amen he will be definitely thwarted
[26:47] today as when Christ withstood his every
[26:49] effort
[26:50] to gain power over him in the desert and
[26:53] what was the power that he was trying to
[26:55] gain over him he was trying to get him
[26:57] to react to his commands
[27:01] you remember reading in the scripture
[27:03] Ephesians Ephesians 4 27 what does it
[27:06] say there neither give place to the
[27:07] devil but what does it say before that
[27:08] be angry and sin not
[27:11] you know your passions come upon you the
[27:14] anger what Satan's trying to do at that
[27:16] moment and he said let's don't let the
[27:18] sun go down on your wrath and I know we
[27:19] like to say well you know we can be mad
[27:21] for a day it sounds good
[27:24] right amen but it's also amen your
[27:27] passion your anger the things that you
[27:29] allow to start trying to control you
[27:32] will cause the light to lose power over
[27:35] you
[27:37] and Satan will try if you give him
[27:39] pleasure try to use that to force you to
[27:42] do something against God's word
[27:45] it's what he did to Moses
[27:47] Moses and his passion amen got angry and
[27:50] he smote The Rock twice instead of
[27:52] speaking to the Rock and what did God
[27:55] say you glorified yourself you didn't
[27:57] glorify me
[28:00] there's where Satan tries to gain power
[28:03] amen he said but he said yes Satan hates
[28:08] Revelation but we love it
[28:10] with true Revelation Our Lives the Gates
[28:12] of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[28:15] will prevail over them praise the name
[28:18] of the Lord now brother Branham was
[28:20] planning on preaching this message
[28:21] called the trail of the serpent
[28:23] he said it was uh the beast at the
[28:25] beginning
[28:26] and the Beast at the end he said it's
[28:29] like twins
[28:30] so close in worship
[28:35] now I'm picking up on that thought
[28:38] the trail that the serpent has left
[28:41] he said the trail of the serpent
[28:44] Ry how many has went in the woods and
[28:46] and found the trails of the snakes
[28:52] one brother we need you up here
[28:55] amen it's hard to see
[28:58] unless you know what to look for
[29:01] it's very hard to see where a snake has
[29:03] been
[29:05] it can be hard to discern the writer in
[29:07] the Book of Proverbs spoke of the way of
[29:09] a serpent upon a rock it was mysterious
[29:12] to him
[29:13] it was hard to distinguish
[29:15] the serpent is found in an element he's
[29:18] sunning himself and then he leaves no
[29:21] trace of his coming or going
[29:24] it's not so when it comes to the
[29:26] prophetic
[29:27] for God exposed his Trail
[29:30] so notice he said from the beginning
[29:31] it's been so close no he go back to the
[29:35] Book of Genesis which is a seed chapters
[29:37] why he hates this book
[29:39] you can see what was planted you can see
[29:41] how it behaves in the Book of
[29:43] Revelations you can see how it ends
[29:45] in the families of Adam and Eve in the
[29:47] families of Abraham and Sarah in the
[29:49] family of Noah in the family of Isaac
[29:51] and Rebecca what do they all have in
[29:53] common
[29:55] you see there's a cane you see there's
[29:56] an Ishmael
[29:58] right
[29:59] amen there's a ham
[30:02] there's an Esau
[30:04] amen amen you remember speaking about
[30:06] Noah the prophet said you remember when
[30:09] Noah came out ham came with him sin was
[30:12] still there and sin went right on
[30:14] through the ark unbelief and doubt went
[30:15] right over carried in judgment
[30:18] amen he said Noah went through that
[30:21] tribulation period he said but then he
[30:24] said he said but then out come Noah who
[30:27] polluted the Earth again
[30:29] I'm sorry out came ham who polluted the
[30:31] Earth again
[30:33] so Satan amen was always close
[30:42] and I want you to do me a favor tonight
[30:43] when I'm speaking about this don't you
[30:46] put names in it
[30:49] we're talking about spirits
[30:52] amen because Satan wants to use our
[30:54] emotions
[30:55] it's not what we're interested in is our
[30:57] emotions against someone or against this
[30:59] or I think this because you're going to
[31:01] find out the one you think is corrected
[31:03] you need it too
[31:05] if in fact I think I'm still preaching
[31:07] to humans
[31:08] amen
[31:09] so Satan was there
[31:11] with him he came right behind Noah
[31:14] sowing right behind him you remember
[31:16] with with him what happened amen out of
[31:19] hand come Nimrod and ham was under a
[31:21] curse because you think about what ham
[31:23] did he saw his father in his failure and
[31:26] he went began to talk about it amen and
[31:30] he exposed his father's nakedness
[31:33] but his brothers would have nothing to
[31:35] do with that shame they walked backwards
[31:37] and covered we need more Brothers amen
[31:40] that'll cover for one another instead of
[31:42] talking about somebody's failure
[31:44] and when Noah realized what had happened
[31:47] he meant he cursed amen this offspring
[31:50] of ham and he said Canaan is cursed and
[31:52] he will be a servant of servants
[31:57] in other words he'll be the lowest of
[31:59] servants
[32:01] and I thought about why why can't why
[32:04] Kanan
[32:05] because God knew Amen in in Divine in
[32:09] his in his in what would happen in the
[32:12] future that Canaan would actually occupy
[32:14] the place that God gave to his people
[32:21] and then Canaan would live in the land
[32:24] of
[32:25] Canaan
[32:28] and that's who God would give to Israel
[32:30] would give him that land and he would
[32:32] tell them through through Abraham and
[32:34] through Isaac don't you marry daughters
[32:35] from there
[32:37] Miriam of the same blood that I'm from
[32:41] why God did not want anything that would
[32:44] have this that the seed of of a servant
[32:47] that would be a slave forever I'm not
[32:51] talking about being a servant of Christ
[32:52] I'm talking about being a slave to
[32:54] idolatry
[32:55] and they would just be a Slave you know
[32:58] the worst kind of attitude is one I just
[33:00] can't help being what I'm being
[33:02] I said he's cursed
[33:05] amen now
[33:08] these are not just Sons
[33:10] the ones I've named are not just Sons
[33:12] but they all directly impact the
[33:15] promises that have been given to these
[33:17] couples every one of them can't impacted
[33:20] the promise Ishmael impacted the promise
[33:24] right Esau impacted the promise
[33:27] amen God gave a promise that he would
[33:30] vindicate through his people's lives but
[33:33] Satan always close
[33:34] to your affections
[33:38] we've been taught by Brother Branham
[33:40] that it's always been twins through the
[33:42] scripture I remember brother Paul you
[33:44] know I got Twins and I they've been here
[33:46] when they were little they're 30 years
[33:47] old now and I'm we're all advanced into
[33:50] our grandparent years and with joy amen
[33:53] and uh but we my grandfather my wife's
[33:56] grandfather was a pastor in Saint
[33:58] Augustine he called me up one day and
[34:00] he's like hey I'm preaching on Twins and
[34:02] I would like to have a picture of your
[34:04] boys
[34:05] and I'm like no way
[34:07] I'm not sending them to you amen because
[34:10] they're not the kind of twins you're
[34:12] talking about
[34:13] amen so he laughed and that was the end
[34:15] of it amen but anyway
[34:16] amen
[34:18] we've been taught brother Branham said
[34:20] that every Revival produces a twin
[34:24] we've named some of them in the above
[34:26] statement
[34:27] all right
[34:28] Cain Ishmael
[34:30] he saw that's not all
[34:32] right there's Jesus there is Judas right
[34:36] and even to go beyond that the prophet
[34:38] said there's a Holy Ghost and there's
[34:40] the Antichrist
[34:43] twins Holy Ghost and the antichrist
[34:46] twins
[34:50] in the religious realm they can even
[34:53] look alike
[34:59] so he said now don't forget this I trust
[35:01] this is okay it's what the Lord laid on
[35:02] my heart it's what I want to preach
[35:04] you may not amen but I won't preach it
[35:06] anyhow I've reached that age of my life
[35:08] I can't hear
[35:12] there's always twins
[35:14] and don't forget it he said Little Flock
[35:17] don't forget it in this last day there's
[35:20] going to be twins so close
[35:22] to see the elect
[35:26] if it's possible
[35:29] in other words it's going to have the
[35:31] ability to catch your attention
[35:33] to pull you
[35:37] he said it's a Pentecostal move Matthew
[35:39] 24 24 is a Pentecostal move
[35:43] so much like the real thing till it
[35:46] deceived the very elect if it were
[35:48] possible
[35:49] now he said is he said it's just two
[35:52] fathers but the same mother
[35:58] mother is the church
[36:01] but two different fathers
[36:04] you think about that we have church here
[36:08] I have church
[36:09] amen we're in the framework of the
[36:12] message is the church
[36:15] and in that framework is two Spirits at
[36:18] work
[36:20] is that right
[36:22] same church listen same movement
[36:27] same thing the betting ground is the
[36:30] same
[36:32] it's where the word Falls but one of
[36:35] them is perverted
[36:36] you understand
[36:38] one's perversion because it's the wrong
[36:41] father
[36:42] it's the wrong father and he is stirring
[36:44] people toward an organization
[36:47] notice he's stirring people
[36:51] moving people
[36:54] all right
[36:56] I'm not here to identify churches we're
[36:59] talking about spirits
[37:02] I think it's a shame when we have
[37:04] reached a place in our life that we
[37:05] think we're preaching against somebody
[37:12] we're preaching against spirits
[37:14] and and and the enemy he's come at me
[37:17] he's tried to discourage me he's tried
[37:19] to tell me to give up he's tried to tell
[37:21] me the message isn't true he's tried to
[37:23] tell me all the junk that has gone
[37:25] around the internet and as a pastor it's
[37:28] got to come through and just got you've
[37:30] got to be tested and and you got to say
[37:32] I'm going to stay or I'm going to go and
[37:35] you got friends that have believed and
[37:37] all of a sudden they're gone it's a
[37:39] stirring time
[37:42] people are being sturged
[37:45] there's a stirring going on
[37:50] and we use words so easily
[37:54] without really understanding amen
[37:57] ramifications of using words
[38:00] what they do and what they mean
[38:02] we use the word emotion like there's
[38:04] something wrong with emotion
[38:06] but I'm telling you I don't care I don't
[38:08] care if you sit here and stare at me
[38:10] that's emotion I don't care if you jump
[38:12] up and down that's emotion emotion is
[38:15] part of your makeup I came from the
[38:17] Mennonite Church they sat there like
[38:20] this and don't move the whole time
[38:21] that's their emotion I can't help it
[38:25] but we label one another
[38:27] because that's the age we live in
[38:30] of labels and nobody wants to look
[38:33] behind the label
[38:36] come on church if I just call you a name
[38:39] it must be true
[38:42] so when he says it's a Pentecostal move
[38:44] what is he talking about what is
[38:46] Pentecost
[38:48] Pentecost is where a true birth is
[38:51] and that's where Satan is deceiving he's
[38:55] deceiving at the place of a true birth
[38:58] a place where it can look real but it's
[39:01] not real
[39:02] there's only one way you can tell if
[39:04] it's real I'll tell you what a prophet
[39:06] said and that's where I stake my life a
[39:08] prophet said he can impersonate anything
[39:11] he can impersonate any gift he can
[39:13] impersonate moves he said but he cannot
[39:16] be the word
[39:17] [Music]
[39:17] [Applause]
[39:22] you've got to have an anchor in you
[39:26] that Satan cannot move you
[39:30] I don't serve God tonight brother Joe
[39:33] because I've been well all my life
[39:36] I don't serve God because he has paid
[39:38] all my bills
[39:40] come on church I don't serve God because
[39:43] I have a church with no problems
[39:46] it's not why I serve God I don't serve
[39:49] God because it's convenient I serve God
[39:51] because what I have inside of me and it
[39:55] can only be satisfied by what he has
[39:58] said in his word
[39:59] old taste and see that the Lord is good
[40:03] God gave you an appetite to move you
[40:06] into the supernatural
[40:09] that's why you have an appetite not just
[40:12] a taste of it and walk away and say
[40:14] that's a good service but the taste of
[40:16] it and say I want more of that and I
[40:19] want more of that you see we can't be
[40:21] trusted many times with what we have
[40:24] because we're too heavy
[40:28] Paul said amen lay aside every weight
[40:32] and the sin that does so easily says
[40:35] that means even weights are not sinful
[40:38] just make us heavy we're too heavy to be
[40:42] used brother Bannon would say it like
[40:43] this why do you hunger why do you thirst
[40:45] he said it's the father trying to reveal
[40:48] himself to you but
[40:50] but so many things get it out of you
[40:52] and many of those things are not even
[40:54] wrong
[41:01] stirring people
[41:04] stirring people
[41:14] I'm gonna have to run more
[41:19] so again he says when I get home I'm
[41:21] preaching on that trail of the serpent
[41:24] it's my understanding that they did not
[41:26] want him to preach on it
[41:29] he said but it's it's the it's the
[41:30] serpent he said it's the beast at the
[41:33] beginning
[41:34] and it's the beast at the end I'll Trail
[41:38] him right through the Bible
[41:41] an organization cannot do that
[41:44] and he said if the Lord permits us he
[41:47] says and now just watch how that cunning
[41:50] that fellow is it's just like Judas and
[41:53] Jesus Brothers in the same tribe
[41:58] just like Esau and Jacob just like The
[42:02] Crow and the dove everything is a twin
[42:06] in this great Warfare
[42:09] in question and answer 64
[42:12] speaks of it again about twins he says
[42:15] it's been twins all along he said even
[42:17] the Holy Spirit and the antichrist
[42:19] is twins
[42:23] amen
[42:26] so Satan's purpose was from the
[42:28] beginning he said I'm going to make
[42:29] myself an Eden
[42:30] will make us myself a place where people
[42:33] will exalt me
[42:35] people will position me in that place
[42:38] that they look to me first
[42:41] instead of in instead of God they look
[42:44] to me first
[42:47] and and he's done that he's he has
[42:50] lusted for the sons of God to be put on
[42:53] display and vanquished
[42:57] and their weapons of warfare were
[43:00] useless in his Warfare
[43:04] oh what is a shame
[43:06] those same swords and weapons that were
[43:09] put on display in the Roman Triumph
[43:11] could have easily killed that room in
[43:13] general
[43:17] those weapons put on display did not
[43:19] mean they were not powerful enough
[43:28] praise the Lord
[43:31] Satan is not called God of any other age
[43:35] but this one this is ambition
[43:38] and here he is and I just want to I just
[43:41] want to show you in just a little bit
[43:42] how how the scriptures describe Satan
[43:45] just just real quickly is that okay and
[43:48] what what the prophet said that he was
[43:50] he said he was the right hand of
[43:52] almighty God he was the right hand he
[43:55] was the original Archangel in heaven
[43:57] once the greatest person in heaven
[44:00] outside of God this is a man
[44:03] who had a great standing and a great
[44:06] estate he stood at the right hand of God
[44:08] he was a leading the leading cherubim
[44:12] he was also the first one to take the
[44:15] wrong step he was placed on free moral
[44:18] agency and he chose a man to follow that
[44:21] path
[44:23] sin did not start on Earth it started in
[44:25] heaven
[44:27] amen amen Satan Lucifer the devil was a
[44:31] condemned creature before he ever struck
[44:34] the Earth
[44:36] amen
[44:39] because when he was given the
[44:40] preeminances to make his choice he
[44:43] wanted something better than what God
[44:45] had
[44:48] and that seemed so far from us when
[44:49] we're talking about that so far out
[44:51] there way up in the galaxies here's
[44:53] here's something happen out there but it
[44:55] came right here
[44:57] and and the prophet said he said now
[44:59] there's only two Powers that's God's
[45:02] power that's Satan's power there's only
[45:03] two powers and every war every disorder
[45:05] everything that comes along is either
[45:06] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[45:09] power because it's only two Powers there
[45:11] is power of Life power of death
[45:14] amen he said there's remember and don't
[45:16] forget it there's only two Powers one is
[45:18] the spiritual power of the Holy Spirit
[45:20] the other one is the devil working
[45:22] through intellectual power for that's
[45:24] where he entered in the Garden of Eden
[45:26] through intellectual powers to make Eve
[45:29] believe in intellectual conception
[45:31] against the word
[45:32] now intellectual conception is beautiful
[45:34] and will bring forth life
[45:41] but a perverted one
[45:45] all right amen now he said the first
[45:49] decision God gave this people in the
[45:51] carniven was to combat the enemy with
[45:53] was his word and they were fortified by
[45:56] his word
[45:57] he said and now the enemy is going to
[46:00] study our strategy
[46:03] with the word
[46:05] he is going to see how you handle it
[46:08] he's going to watch it
[46:12] he said that was what he did with Eve he
[46:15] used that he caused her to reason with
[46:17] the word and you want to never reason
[46:19] with God's word
[46:22] just believe it don't try to explain it
[46:25] don't try to figure it out you can't
[46:28] figure out God God is the word and it's
[46:32] just made to believe and that is our
[46:35] strength is to accept the word
[46:40] amen so God wants you to take the word
[46:43] in its pure form and accept it into your
[46:47] life it becomes your strength now why is
[46:50] Satan studying us then
[46:54] you know it was said about Napoleon who
[46:58] was a great warrior and a great General
[47:01] amen and speaking of the devil that he
[47:03] studies man to gain Mastery over that
[47:06] man he will he will he'll study our
[47:10] character
[47:11] and and it was like Napoleon every time
[47:14] he came into fresh territory it was said
[47:16] of him he would spread a map upon the
[47:18] ground and he would ponder it he would
[47:21] get on his knees and look at that and he
[47:22] would make himself familiar with every
[47:25] feature that was on that map he would
[47:27] know where the rivers are he was there
[47:28] were the bridges the forge The Villages
[47:30] their positions and relation to other
[47:32] towns and he would then plan out how he
[47:35] would attack that area
[47:38] now this is what Satan does he studies
[47:41] our strategy with the word how does
[47:44] brother Danny use the words he don't
[47:47] call me brother how does he use the word
[47:50] in relation to my attacks
[47:54] how does he use the word in relation to
[47:56] other people and He will study my
[47:59] character now if I'm a certain person
[48:01] that is loud and funny and and all
[48:04] certain different ways or if I'm a very
[48:06] reserved person or you know we all made
[48:09] up different he will try to work the
[48:11] angles
[48:13] that of your weakness
[48:17] and here you're trying to just start
[48:20] putting pressure in certain areas
[48:23] because he wants to see how you're going
[48:25] to react
[48:26] are you going to use the word are you
[48:28] going to fly off the handle
[48:35] the devil has many names
[48:39] it's called The Devil he's called
[48:40] Lucifer he's called Satan he's called
[48:43] that old serpent he's called The Serpent
[48:45] the reason the all of these names have
[48:47] attributes serpent is one who has a very
[48:49] sharp Vision one who eyes its victim
[48:52] keeps his eye upon them an old serpent
[48:56] is a veteran one has been through many
[48:57] wars he's he's sharp he knows what else
[49:01] he he he's planned many campaigns Satan
[49:05] is an adversary amen who who who makes
[49:08] himself an adversary against anything
[49:10] that's what Satan is a devil means he's
[49:13] a false accuser he's a slander
[49:16] we've met him in many of these different
[49:18] ways
[49:20] amen he's also called a dragon a dragon
[49:23] is bigger than a serpent
[49:25] he's also political
[49:28] amen he's also called the Archangel of
[49:31] the bottomless pit
[49:33] amen he's called abandon he's called
[49:36] amen uh which means destruction in the
[49:39] Greek he's a pollen which means he's a
[49:41] corrupter
[49:43] the Bible said he is subtle the Bible
[49:45] said he's a roaring lion the Bible says
[49:48] he's an angel of Light
[49:50] all of those are deceptive
[49:53] and what Satan comes to do is to replace
[49:56] the realities of Christ in your life
[50:01] amen
[50:03] amen and he will give you a substitute
[50:10] Book of Exodus the Bible tells us that
[50:13] when God was training Moses I would have
[50:15] liked to have seen it I don't know if
[50:16] I'd like to experienced it but I'd like
[50:18] to have seen it that when he was
[50:20] training Moses and telling him to go
[50:22] down to Egypt and Moses was given his
[50:24] excuses and and God comes back and says
[50:26] I'm going to do it I'm going to be with
[50:28] you I'm the one that's going to do this
[50:29] Moses you're not the one going to do I'm
[50:31] going to do it and and the most like
[50:33] well how's it going to happen he says
[50:34] what do you got in your hand oh here he
[50:36] has a Shepherd staff and and the Lord
[50:38] tells him amen what do you have in your
[50:40] hand and he goes I got a rod you know
[50:42] when God asked you something he wants
[50:43] you to respond
[50:45] if you're sick tonight he'll ask you
[50:47] what does Isaiah 53 say he don't want
[50:48] you to go um
[50:51] he wants you to say it because you've
[50:54] got to see it
[50:58] amen and he said it's a rod he said
[51:01] throw it on the ground he threw it on
[51:03] the ground and it became a serpent
[51:06] the Bible says Moses fled from it
[51:09] the Lord said unto Moses now put forth
[51:11] your hand that was probably a long
[51:13] period of time between amen seeing it on
[51:16] the ground and now putting your hand out
[51:18] amen because God was teaching a man how
[51:21] to handle a snake
[51:25] amen he'll teach you the same thing
[51:28] you may not get a firsthand experience
[51:31] like Moses but he'll teach you through a
[51:32] prophet's word
[51:34] amen and he would tell him amen now put
[51:36] forth your hand and take him by the tail
[51:38] and he put forth his hand and caught it
[51:40] now this is the same man that ran from
[51:41] it
[51:43] now he comes back and he catches it by
[51:45] the tail and it becomes a rod in his
[51:47] hand there's there's some of you here
[51:48] tonight you're just running
[51:51] but God's going to bring you back
[51:54] and I want you to know it never became a
[51:56] snake until it was on the ground because
[51:58] that's the only position that a snake
[52:00] should be in
[52:02] it was not a snake up here it was a
[52:04] snake down there
[52:09] God has teaching him how to handle a
[52:11] snake
[52:13] he threw it down
[52:15] that's his position
[52:17] it's where God cursed him
[52:20] the prophet that's when he threw him
[52:21] down that's when he became a snake
[52:24] amen had to be on the ground
[52:29] No Moses is like us first he's afraid to
[52:33] take God at his word
[52:35] he shows his emotional side he runs from
[52:38] it
[52:40] you know that's what we do and God tells
[52:42] us something and he confronts us with
[52:44] the word
[52:45] it confronts us in a situation
[52:49] amen and and he forces you to put your
[52:52] hand out
[52:54] and take a hold of it
[52:57] amen because this is going to show you
[53:00] to be a prophet
[53:02] to pharaoh
[53:04] what I'm doing with your life is going
[53:07] to show amen that Pharaohs hold over you
[53:11] is false
[53:16] Hallelujah
[53:18] amen
[53:21] amen
[53:23] at first Moses was afraid but the word
[53:25] of the Lord was you have power
[53:28] over the serpent
[53:30] that wasn't only for that was not only
[53:33] for for Moses that's for our day
[53:35] for what you find out brother Branham
[53:37] had the same thing happened to him where
[53:39] he was given power
[53:41] is that right he was given power over
[53:45] this great monster serpent he had a
[53:48] vision do I do you want me to tell it to
[53:49] you he had the vision he said he said it
[53:52] was about three o'clock in the morning I
[53:53] heard somebody singing we're coming down
[53:55] to the river and he said I'm standing on
[53:56] the map of Palestine he said we were
[53:58] two-thirds of the way there and
[54:00] somebody's saying we're coming down to
[54:01] the river and I look and there's Jordan
[54:03] laying in front of me and oh every
[54:05] promise is over in the Promised Land
[54:08] land of Canaan
[54:11] every promise was over there he woke up
[54:13] and then he went back into the vision
[54:15] again he said and this time I was on a
[54:17] great Highway and I was with a friend
[54:19] and he said he said his voice told me he
[54:22] said there's such danger in this day
[54:24] and it seems like everybody is afraid
[54:29] so fear was a big part of the day
[54:32] and he said I heard a noise they said
[54:35] the voice told me there's such danger he
[54:37] said there's something that said it's
[54:38] instant death when it strikes you
[54:42] he said I heard this noise and here
[54:44] comes this great monster serpent coming
[54:45] through and he was looking at me he said
[54:47] that voice told me he said now you've
[54:49] been given power to mine him
[54:52] the worst or any you've been given power
[54:55] to bind him amen Moses was given power
[54:58] to bind
[55:00] amen he said when he looked at me it
[55:03] just he looked at me said but then he
[55:05] couldn't strike me
[55:07] why because the prophet is representing
[55:09] the word of the age
[55:13] and who has more power
[55:17] amen he said he couldn't strike me he
[55:19] said but then he turned and looked at
[55:20] that man and he started going after that
[55:22] man and he said the man was running and
[55:24] jumping trying to get away
[55:26] he said and I cried out oh God have
[55:28] mercy upon that my that brother and he
[55:31] said the Lord spoke to me and said
[55:32] you've been given power to bind him he
[55:35] spoke in the name of Jesus and he bound
[55:37] the serpent he said you've not only been
[55:39] given power to bind him you've been
[55:41] given power to unbind him
[55:44] Moses you've been given power throw him
[55:46] on the ground he'll become a serpent
[55:48] pick him up here become a rod
[55:51] he said but you must be more sincere
[55:55] what was he telling him the attitude in
[55:57] which you handle the words
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:01] this word is not a game
[56:05] this word is not who is the best Church
[56:07] who is the best preacher who this is not
[56:09] the word God's word is his heart and his
[56:12] heart is his people
[56:17] Hallelujah
[56:18] blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:21] it was in that day of Moses that Paul
[56:23] spoke about it and he named who those
[56:25] magicians were he said it was the days
[56:26] of Janice and Chambers they also could
[56:28] throw a snake down
[56:31] they had power
[56:33] to throw a snake down
[56:36] and pick it up again
[56:39] amen but Moses snake ate theirs up
[56:43] and they could not duplicate that
[56:46] Hallelujah
[56:48] what a time we're living in
[56:51] amen
[56:54] in the first coming of Christ both John
[56:57] and Jesus identified the religious
[56:59] leaders as a generation of what
[57:03] the trail of the serpent
[57:07] amen he said you're the ones that killed
[57:10] the prophets
[57:12] it was a serpent that killed the
[57:15] prophets
[57:17] why were they killing them to take away
[57:19] their influence
[57:26] if Satan can kill the prophet
[57:28] in your life
[57:31] the voice of influence of this age if
[57:34] you can kill it
[57:36] so here's Jesus stand here and he's
[57:39] identifying these prophets or these
[57:42] leaders as a Generation of Vipers that
[57:44] killed the prophets amen those that
[57:46] killed the influence of the word those
[57:47] that argued against the vindication
[57:51] of the word that would deliver the
[57:53] people
[57:55] you see that's what Satan has done in
[57:57] this age he's wanted to make the message
[57:59] about oh you know brother random he
[58:01] prophesied about a bridge or he saw a
[58:03] bridge or he had a vision of this he had
[58:04] that's not the message
[58:06] God
[58:08] allowed him to do that knowing amen
[58:11] there would be unbelievers come back
[58:13] because he's smokescreening he doesn't
[58:16] want you to see the words
[58:21] come on Church
[58:23] because he knows the power of the word
[58:27] he just wants you here to question
[58:29] things that you don't have an answer for
[58:35] he said well was there 16 men on the
[58:37] bridge or was it two how many was it
[58:40] wow I just want you to go prove to me
[58:42] that Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[58:45] well you said I said it in the Bible
[58:46] where brother Graham said it in his
[58:48] message too
[58:49] come on but go find me the place go show
[58:53] me the science
[58:56] prove to me he was born of a virgin
[58:59] by science That's what Satan is going to
[59:02] do to you there's something greater than
[59:04] science something greater than
[59:06] newsworthy I mean it's his words
[59:10] thank you
[59:11] I just got to get personal
[59:14] you know I'm just swimming around a
[59:15] little bit here it's all right
[59:17] amen let me tell you I am a direct amen
[59:20] I I'm a person who had uh I was directly
[59:23] influenced and impacted by The Prophet's
[59:26] Ministry
[59:27] I want to tell you you came too late
[59:31] amen my mother stood for it when nobody
[59:33] else would in her her my daddy hated
[59:36] this message hated it if brother Brown's
[59:39] in heaven I don't want to be there well
[59:40] that's stupid
[59:42] who would want to say that I'll tell you
[59:44] if the poe if Pope if the Pope's in
[59:45] heaven I still want to go
[59:47] come on that means that man went through
[59:50] the process and he got there right
[59:53] but there's such a hatred in the
[59:55] denominations against a prophet
[59:57] because it's not their hatred it's
[59:59] Satan's because it's a Ministry that
[1:00:02] pulls him out of his position as God and
[1:00:05] presents him as a man to you
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:11] my Dad ran my mother all over the
[1:00:13] country trying to get her out of the
[1:00:14] message my grandmother asked brother
[1:00:16] Brown I mean you can read it in 1964 I
[1:00:18] have two daughters in denominations

[1:02:58] he told my mother I'll take you to the
[1:03:00] baptism
[1:03:01] it was not big noises there was not
[1:03:03] lights flashing it was just a change of
[1:03:05] heart that God turned him because
[1:03:08] somebody stayed true to the word and the
[1:03:12] word has power to change any situation

[1:04:26] receive a prophet's reward
[1:04:28] what does that mean whatever God pours
[1:04:31] through him
[1:04:32] for the people is yours by faith
[1:04:38] Hallelujah now I just want to say this
[1:04:42] Jesus said to Satan
[1:04:45] you are of your are you speaking to this
[1:04:47] religious leader says you're of your
[1:04:49] father the devil and the lust of your
[1:04:51] fathers you'll do he's a murderer from
[1:04:52] the beginning
[1:04:54] and he Abode not in the truth because
[1:04:56] there's no truth in him when he speaketh
[1:04:58] a lie he is actually he's speaking of
[1:05:01] his own
[1:05:03] so when he's saying when he tells a lie
[1:05:05] he's actually talking about himself
[1:05:11] for he's a liar and a father of it
[1:05:14] how many has ever
[1:05:16] been in a place of hopelessness
[1:05:19] torment
[1:05:22] you ever been there brother
[1:05:24] hopeless tormented
[1:05:29] I want to say it's not yours
[1:05:34] that's his
[1:05:39] I know you're tired brother
[1:05:41] I see Ireland all over you
[1:05:44] you're turning green
[1:05:47] but I want to give you this testimony
[1:05:49] I think we can help you
[1:05:51] we can help one another if we humble
[1:05:54] ourself
[1:05:55] before one another
[1:05:57] the man said the Pentecostal church is
[1:05:59] only going to talk about how strong they
[1:06:00] are
[1:06:01] he said I'm going to preach to you
[1:06:02] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:06:04] sent a strange message to preach in a
[1:06:06] Pentecostal Church
[1:06:08] when we're all talking about our power
[1:06:10] but brother Graham says never judge
[1:06:12] yourself by the power and the Miracles
[1:06:15] in your life
[1:06:16] he said you look back and judge yourself
[1:06:18] by the fruit
[1:06:21] that is coming according to the word
[1:06:24] right remember because there's twins
[1:06:28] Judas did not have a devilish Ministry
[1:06:34] he had a holy ghost Ministry
[1:06:37] Judas Priest and cast Devils out
[1:06:41] Judas prayed for the sick and they were
[1:06:43] healed
[1:06:46] but he couldn't come all the way up
[1:06:50] to what the word demanded
[1:06:52] to be born again
[1:06:57] I know what it's like to feel that
[1:06:59] hopelessness
[1:07:02] I don't like to talk about these things
[1:07:05] but I think it's important sometimes to
[1:07:07] realize the things we feel and the
[1:07:09] things we're going through
[1:07:12] is coming from Satan
[1:07:16] because when you feel like you have no
[1:07:18] hope
[1:07:18] that's him
[1:07:20] he has no hope when you feel hopeless
[1:07:24] that's his hopelessness
[1:07:28] when you feel powerless that his power
[1:07:31] do you realize the man talking to you
[1:07:33] has no keys to his house doesn't have
[1:07:36] power over your death doesn't have power
[1:07:38] over your grave do you realize he's lost
[1:07:42] it
[1:07:43] you know what it does to a man who's
[1:07:45] lost all of his money in his bank and
[1:07:47] has no power at home
[1:07:54] when you feel that
[1:07:56] torment because fear hath torment
[1:08:00] Satan attacks you with all his hate of
[1:08:03] hate of God
[1:08:05] and it's channeled towards you he's
[1:08:08] going to question God in your life
[1:08:10] he's going to tell you what he's going
[1:08:11] to do to you
[1:08:13] that means heard him tell how many has
[1:08:15] ever heard the Devil tell you what he's
[1:08:16] going to do to you well I want to ask
[1:08:18] you why didn't he do it
[1:08:21] because I see by the Bible if he's ever
[1:08:24] given permission to do anything he does
[1:08:26] it immediately
[1:08:29] but he tells me these things
[1:08:32] and he doesn't do it you know why he
[1:08:35] doesn't have permission
[1:08:37] if you had the permission to take my
[1:08:39] life he wouldn't tell me he's going to
[1:08:41] take my life and he took it
[1:08:43] how many times he told me I want to die
[1:08:45] of cancer
[1:08:46] because I had an ache in my bones or I
[1:08:49] have a history in my family tell me how
[1:08:51] many times he told me this what your
[1:08:52] feeling is this disease or that disease
[1:08:54] how many times has he threatened me with
[1:08:56] something
[1:08:58] that he's actually not allowed to do
[1:09:02] because he's a liar and when he's
[1:09:05] speaking of it he's speaking of his own
[1:09:07] and he wants to hide behind that
[1:09:10] hopelessness because hopelessness will
[1:09:12] not search out A matter it'll give up
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:17] and Sid wants you to give up tonight
[1:09:19] because he wants to put you in a
[1:09:21] procession
[1:09:24] of so-called Believers and used to
[1:09:27] worship God believe them put them in a
[1:09:31] procession of a powerless message
[1:09:34] ah yes
[1:09:36] he likes to do that
[1:09:38] but he can go no further than what he's
[1:09:41] given I've told this testimony a few
[1:09:43] times I'm going to close after I say
[1:09:45] this but I trust he'll help you
[1:09:48] I know what it's like to be depressed
[1:09:50] I know what it's like to have
[1:09:52] hopelessness
[1:09:54] and I'm not talking about before I came
[1:09:56] to the Lord I'm talking about in the
[1:09:57] last few years I know what it's like to
[1:09:58] have a nervous breakdown
[1:10:01] I know what it's like to know what's
[1:10:03] going on and not know and be embarrassed
[1:10:11] in 2016
[1:10:15] I I had done kind of overworked myself
[1:10:18] and
[1:10:19] administered in Ministry and then Satan
[1:10:22] picks his times wisely
[1:10:24] and I I'm home now
[1:10:27] and I come under an attack and I don't
[1:10:29] know what it is but the attack is such
[1:10:32] amen and some of you heard me say this
[1:10:34] before just bear with me but I just felt
[1:10:35] to say it tonight I was under attack as
[1:10:37] such and it was embarrassing to me
[1:10:39] because I became totally afraid to
[1:10:43] preach
[1:10:46] had no energy to hold myself up
[1:10:50] and I did not want to talk to people now
[1:10:52] that's hard if you're a pastor
[1:10:55] because people sure want to talk to you
[1:10:59] glory be to God
[1:11:02] and the Lord used my wife to help me but
[1:11:04] I want to tell you something now about
[1:11:06] the realm of The Supernaturals things we
[1:11:07] don't understand because we we have a
[1:11:09] one-track mind think God only works
[1:11:11] certain ways
[1:11:14] but I was under attack to this extreme
[1:11:16] the attack was my I had got worn out
[1:11:19] physically and then I was attacked in
[1:11:22] the spiritual realm and my nurse broke
[1:11:24] down and I I I didn't realize what it
[1:11:27] was but brother Paul for the space of
[1:11:29] two weeks
[1:11:30] something would come in my bedroom
[1:11:32] and every night every morning about four
[1:11:35] o'clock in the morning it was like my my
[1:11:37] I was falling apart I had actually
[1:11:39] strained myself to try to see it it was
[1:11:42] so real to me
[1:11:43] and it was an unclean presence and I was
[1:11:46] told you know preachers shouldn't have
[1:11:47] nervous breakdowns and I don't
[1:11:50] understand that and I should you know so
[1:11:51] you don't want to talk about it because
[1:11:53] preachers don't have them
[1:11:57] you know it worked tough
[1:11:59] right I mean look at him
[1:12:02] he's barely staying away
[1:12:04] we're tough
[1:12:05] I'm with you brother I totally
[1:12:07] understand you're miserable and I feel
[1:12:09] for you in the name of the Lord
[1:12:12] just bear with me it's coming
[1:12:16] and and I was in this spot
[1:12:20] and I was scheduled to preach a meeting
[1:12:21] actually up here in Ohio
[1:12:24] and I was praying Lord get me out of it
[1:12:26] because I knew that I'd gotten that
[1:12:27] Pulpit I was afraid I was going to break
[1:12:28] down in the Pulpit I could not preach I
[1:12:30] was afraid to preach I didn't want to
[1:12:32] didn't want to come
[1:12:33] and the Lord sent a tropical storm and I
[1:12:36] canceled
[1:12:39] there's some of them that are good
[1:12:44] and the church asked me
[1:12:46] to to
[1:12:48] take some time away give myself a rest I
[1:12:51] was at a place with Paul I could not
[1:12:52] talk to people I literally I didn't just
[1:12:55] didn't want to be around people and I
[1:12:56] don't say that to make you feel sorry
[1:12:58] for me I'm telling you the situation I
[1:13:00] was in
[1:13:01] so my wife she scheduled a place to
[1:13:04] thank God for these wives that know how
[1:13:06] to schedule and work and she worked when
[1:13:08] I couldn't and we went away for a little
[1:13:10] while but in that time she wrote a
[1:13:13] letter to an acquaintance who's not even
[1:13:14] in the message
[1:13:16] and she said if you believe in God and
[1:13:20] they just struck up a conversation if
[1:13:22] you believe in believing God pray for my
[1:13:24] husband he's just gone through situation
[1:13:28] it wasn't sin I didn't know what it was
[1:13:31] that's what was embarrassing it's
[1:13:33] embarrassing
[1:13:35] and
[1:13:37] this woman wrote back
[1:13:39] she's a Catholic
[1:13:41] Glory
[1:13:44] and she said
[1:13:48] she said I know what his problem is
[1:13:52] oh praise the Lord
[1:13:54] I don't now she does
[1:13:57] she goes
[1:14:00] she just she's not even from Florida
[1:14:02] she's from New York she's never been
[1:14:04] there she described our church described
[1:14:07] where people sat in our church
[1:14:09] and said I tell you what his problem is
[1:14:12] he's got witches in his church
[1:14:15] and got more than one I always knew it
[1:14:24] which is she goes Catholic
[1:14:28] tell him not to worry about it
[1:14:31] said I put a hedger about him like
[1:14:33] praise the Lord I got a Catholic hedge
[1:14:35] around me
[1:14:37] I know too many quotes man
[1:14:43] yeah it says a message minister
[1:14:46] receiving Catholic help
[1:14:53] I told my wife because what we were
[1:14:55] going through in the church because
[1:14:56] there was a little bit of a rebellion
[1:14:57] stirring up
[1:14:59] and I told my wife I said well you know
[1:15:01] the Bible says that witchcraft is as a
[1:15:04] sin of rebellion so I just left it there
[1:15:06] so we're on a trip and I get a phone
[1:15:08] call from a message Minister and he
[1:15:10] called me up and he said I said I was
[1:15:11] riding on my tractor he said I can tell
[1:15:13] you where I was he said the Lord told me
[1:15:15] call Danny and tell him he's been
[1:15:17] attacked by a spirit of witchcraft
[1:15:20] so now I have a Catholic
[1:15:23] and a message preacher
[1:15:26] collaborating
[1:15:33] We're Men brother I'm telling you we
[1:15:35] there's no super dupers around
[1:15:38] I tell you when Satan
[1:15:41] Satan worked on me in a place where I
[1:15:44] didn't know what it was and when you
[1:15:46] don't know what it is that's his power
[1:15:50] when you get sick
[1:15:52] he'll tell you what it is before there's
[1:15:54] even proof of what it is
[1:15:57] I've had people in the hospital with
[1:15:59] heart conditions and all kinds of things
[1:16:01] and I told them I said you really don't
[1:16:03] have a heart condition I said it's
[1:16:05] stress doing that to you
[1:16:08] and they wouldn't believe me
[1:16:11] and so they'd go there and the doctor
[1:16:13] would sit them down said I want to tell
[1:16:14] you We've ran all these testers nothing
[1:16:16] wrong with you he said but it's stress
[1:16:18] that's causing that I said Doctor will
[1:16:20] you come to my church
[1:16:24] because they don't believe me
[1:16:27] but you've been around long enough
[1:16:29] long enough it puts pressure on a body
[1:16:31] and a body reacts and that's what I was
[1:16:33] doing I didn't know what it was and he's
[1:16:35] bringing all his hopelessness in and his
[1:16:37] torment and tell you there's something
[1:16:39] wrong with you
[1:16:41] and I'm breaking down I don't I can't
[1:16:43] fulfill what I'm supposed to now it's
[1:16:46] become an evident to the church when the
[1:16:48] Lord told me what it was
[1:16:52] still didn't have all my strength back
[1:16:53] and I wasn't healed but I my the the
[1:16:56] courage that comes with knowing the
[1:16:58] enemy and where he's hiding
[1:17:01] where his Trail has moved
[1:17:05] then I began to regain strength there is
[1:17:07] a situation I trust this is all right
[1:17:08] and somebody hears it and I hope they
[1:17:10] don't get offended if you do come talk
[1:17:12] and we'll say praise the Lord but um
[1:17:15] it was a situation where it was a spirit
[1:17:17] rising up was against the ministry
[1:17:19] against preaching
[1:17:21] period you shouldn't preach
[1:17:25] and it was collaborating and gaining
[1:17:27] strength and then with it came a a
[1:17:30] hyper-critical spirit against all the
[1:17:33] people
[1:17:35] and I don't I don't mind this going up
[1:17:37] because I want the devil to be exposed
[1:17:41] it was hypocritical and I'm a pastor
[1:17:45] I gotta hide things I gotta even hide
[1:17:48] what's wrong with them
[1:17:51] and I'm thinking well how can you say
[1:17:53] that about that person when you are
[1:17:54] doing this
[1:17:56] but Satan is is such a creature that he
[1:17:59] does not consider himself
[1:18:01] but he only points at someone else
[1:18:06] and and I was written a long letter
[1:18:10] of everything that was wrong in the
[1:18:12] church
[1:18:13] you know the old Danny stayman would
[1:18:15] have
[1:18:16] rose up and said listen
[1:18:19] I have got me a shotgun
[1:18:21] and I'm going to use it I'm going to
[1:18:23] pull it till it runs dry I want to just
[1:18:25] point that out there and
[1:18:27] let that chip but the Lord says no
[1:18:30] you're not
[1:18:31] and I waited four months before I ever
[1:18:33] responded to that letter September
[1:18:36] October November then Christmas Day
[1:18:38] Christmas fell on Sunday and Christmas
[1:18:41] so happens to be my birthday so I
[1:18:43] preached a Christmas message
[1:18:48] praise the Lord you know what I preach
[1:18:50] because God knows if somebody's not
[1:18:52] going to change he's going to clean it
[1:18:54] because he wants to sanctify the church
[1:18:57] and and I and all I preached was the
[1:19:00] Bible is brother branham's absolute
[1:19:04] and in three days it was cleaned out
[1:19:09] it's all I preached
[1:19:12] because somehow today the word has
[1:19:15] morphed
[1:19:16] and if we're not careful we're going to
[1:19:18] become Mormons
[1:19:20] our Jehovah Witness write our own Bible
[1:19:26] the prophet never wrote another Bible
[1:19:28] unveiling of God said he said I can't
[1:19:31] even add to the words one letter oh
[1:19:33] brother Branham that Revelation that you
[1:19:35] had on on the Seven Seals it could be
[1:19:37] amen another chapter to the Book of
[1:19:39] Revelation he says no it cannot be
[1:19:43] what was revealed was already in the
[1:19:45] word
[1:19:48] praise the Lord
[1:19:50] but somehow Satan hates the Bible
[1:19:52] so so when I preached that I I receive
[1:19:56] strength I've got strength back from
[1:19:58] staying with the word showing my colors
[1:20:00] but I wasn't healed and I just want to
[1:20:02] say this and I hope it helps you
[1:20:04] that was in December all the way down to
[1:20:06] August
[1:20:08] I am over in Romania and I'm preaching a
[1:20:10] youth camp it's 102 every day it's 102
[1:20:12] degrees and we're preaching it's outside
[1:20:14] so you go back and you sleep and you
[1:20:16] don't rest and you sleep you know how it
[1:20:17] is and you're sweating everything out
[1:20:19] I'm preaching Thursday night Friday
[1:20:20] morning Friday night Saturday morning
[1:20:22] Saturday night and two on Sunday and
[1:20:23] this is Saturday morning and I want to
[1:20:25] preach part two on Saturday night and
[1:20:29] Saturday morning I preached and I'm
[1:20:30] totally drained and that Spirit came
[1:20:32] back again
[1:20:33] when it comes back I'll tell you how it
[1:20:36] acts it acts like I have no inspiration
[1:20:38] to preach I don't know what I'm going to
[1:20:41] preach and standing out in front of me
[1:20:42] is just like a black cloud I'm scared to
[1:20:45] step into and that fear came back
[1:20:48] and I have to preach
[1:20:51] and I'm I'm praying that I'm asking the
[1:20:54] Lord you've got to help me Lord you know
[1:20:55] what's going on here and I'm asking I'm
[1:20:58] not begging I'm just asking him nothing
[1:21:00] happens
[1:21:01] no voice nobody speaks to me
[1:21:05] pick up my Bible and I walk to the
[1:21:07] pulpit
[1:21:09] feel exactly the same I preach the word
[1:21:13] and I sit down
[1:21:15] and a brother stood up he's sitting over
[1:21:17] about where you are brother getting or
[1:21:19] maybe he was on that side I don't
[1:21:20] remember but it was somewhere like that
[1:21:22] and he came and he spoke to the pastor
[1:21:24] of the youth camp and he went back and
[1:21:27] sat down
[1:21:29] and and the pastor spoke to his son is
[1:21:33] also a minister and his Minister ran the
[1:21:35] camp and they spoke about that man and
[1:21:36] then they came and they talked to me he
[1:21:37] said that man wanted to tell me the
[1:21:40] entire time I preached a man stood right
[1:21:43] behind me and held me up
[1:21:45] [Applause]
[1:21:48] brother Paul they they said that man is
[1:21:51] he's not a fly by night he he's a he's a
[1:21:54] Godly Man and I want to I want you to
[1:21:56] know something I never failed him
[1:21:59] and he never spoke to me
[1:22:02] but when he held me that whole service
[1:22:05] he healed me
[1:22:08] and I want to tell you
[1:22:10] that same God
[1:22:13] that same God that I'm talking about
[1:22:16] he wants to expose the trail
[1:22:20] of the enemy I am not just preaching to
[1:22:22] you some some kind of theology out here
[1:22:25] I'm talking about God's desire is to
[1:22:27] always expose the enemy at your weakest
[1:22:31] place in order to show it he is the same
[1:22:34] yesterday today and forever God allows
[1:22:39] us to become weak so that he can show us
[1:22:41] his strength is still
[1:22:45] stand with me
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:51] May that help you
[1:22:54] I don't talk about that often I don't
[1:22:56] like to talk about it often
[1:22:58] but I do like to tell the devil he lost
[1:23:02] so when I talk I talk about something
[1:23:05] like that I know what it feels like I
