[0:23] corinthians chapter three
[0:35] uh let's let's let's start reading that
[0:37] verse
[0:38] 17.
[0:41] the bible says
[0:43] now the lord is that spirit
[0:46] and where the spirit of the lord is
[0:47] there is liberty
[0:50] but we all with open face beholding
[0:54] as in a glass the glory of the lord are
[0:58] changed
[1:00] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:04] even as
[1:06] by the spirit of the lord
[1:08] i mean let's go to um
[1:11] saint john
[1:13] chapter one
[1:15] saint john chapter one
[1:26] familiar verse of scriptures
[1:28] let's start reading that uh um
[1:36] i started verse 11.
[1:40] the bible says he came unto his own and
[1:43] his own received him not
[1:46] but as many as received him
[1:48] to them
[1:50] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:53] even to them that believe on his name
[1:58] hallelujah
[2:01] but look look look at the way this thing
[2:03] is made next verse
[2:05] which were born not of blood
[2:08] nor of the will of the flesh
[2:11] nor of the will of man
[2:13] but of god
[2:17] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:19] among us
[2:20] and
[2:21] we beheld his and we beheld his glory
[2:25] the glory
[2:26] of the only begotten of the father full
[2:29] of grace and truth
[2:31] amen may the lord bless you know his
[2:32] word you can have your seats
[2:34] and as we're as we're in john
[2:38] you know
[2:39] if we flip over
[2:41] to john chapter four
[2:44] i just want to hit a highlight a verse
[2:46] of scripture out of here john chapter
[2:48] four
[2:49] verse 24.
[2:52] the bible says god is a spirit
[2:55] and they that worship him must worship
[2:58] him in spirit and in truth
[3:01] hallelujah
[3:03] god is a what
[3:05] spirit
[3:07] but did it but then the bible said god
[3:09] became flesh
[3:12] you know this this is where the
[3:13] theologians get mixed up
[3:16] because they'll say well how can god be
[3:18] flesh if he's a spirit
[3:19] he put his spirit in flesh
[3:22] hallelujah in the night church by god's
[3:25] grace we want to use for a subject god's
[3:28] material amen
[3:30] god's material before i go there let's
[3:33] let's let's um
[3:35] read revelations chapter one
[3:38] revelations
[3:40] chapter one
[3:42] i'm just
[3:43] hitting these scriptures and we're going
[3:45] to go as god lead tonight
[3:48] revelations chapter 1 verse 8
[3:52] oh my god
[3:54] now does everybody bible verse 8
[3:56] does your bible read read right there
[3:59] is it in red letters
[4:01] so this is not john talking
[4:04] this is not a prophet talking
[4:07] this is god almighty talking
[4:10] now look at his material hallelujah he
[4:13] says i am alpha and omega hallelujah
[4:17] look at what god is made of the
[4:19] beginning and the end he says i'm alpha
[4:21] and omega the beginning and the end
[4:24] sayeth the lord said who
[4:26] nobody can change that
[4:28] no matter what you go through no matter
[4:30] how many problems you might have if he's
[4:33] in your life he's alpha and omega
[4:37] hallelujah he's the beginning and the
[4:40] end and you know the scripture says if
[4:43] god starts a thing that he's obligated
[4:46] to finish it
[4:47] so if he's your beginning he has to be
[4:50] your end hallelujah
[4:51] and we have scripture amen we have
[4:53] promises we have promises that says i
[4:56] come from god
[4:59] so i'm going back to god
[5:02] hallelujah
[5:05] we're talking about the material of god
[5:07] now look church this is what catches me
[5:10] about this verse of scripture
[5:12] now now the verses i just read you in
[5:14] corinthians it talks about beholding
[5:17] god's face from glory to glory and then
[5:20] over here in in saint john 1 it talks
[5:24] about hallelujah for those of us who can
[5:26] receive god hallelujah there's something
[5:29] in us that gives us power to become
[5:33] hungry power to become the sons and
[5:36] daughters of god
[5:37] so when it comes to god there's
[5:39] something about him that changes us into
[5:42] what he wants us to be
[5:45] hallelujah
[5:46] in church i want you to believe that
[5:48] what god has been doing from generation
[5:51] to generation
[5:52] what he's been doing is changing his
[5:54] people back into his material
[5:59] who
[6:00] we're not just flesh and blood flesh and
[6:03] blood shall not inherit the kingdom of
[6:06] god
[6:06] [Applause]
[6:08] so what has god been doing all this time
[6:11] he's been trying to get us to walk back
[6:13] in the spirit
[6:15] hallelujah because in the spirit he is
[6:18] alpha and omega he's the beginning in
[6:21] the end put that back up for me hardly
[6:23] but this is what i like he says i'm
[6:25] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[6:27] end says the lord which is
[6:32] he's god alpha right now
[6:40] now i'm going to shake you up a little
[6:41] bit
[6:42] for him to be god right now
[6:45] it don't take a special meeting
[6:47] they don't take a fasting and a praying
[6:50] it don't take some special preachers to
[6:52] come from out of town
[6:54] hallelujah he's god right now why
[6:56] because he's the god that which is and
[6:59] which was
[7:02] oh my
[7:03] so whether you want to believe it or not
[7:05] he always was whatever you need
[7:09] hello
[7:12] he's the god
[7:13] which is
[7:14] and which was and which is to come
[7:20] hallelujah
[7:21] church i want to lift up the almighty
[7:23] one tonight
[7:26] because i think we get so tested and so
[7:29] so over charged with trying to live down
[7:31] here in this world we forget who we're
[7:34] serving
[7:35] we're not serving some buddha or some
[7:38] allah we're serving the original
[7:43] we're serving a god with a testimony for
[7:46] generations over 2 000 years that he has
[7:49] risen
[7:52] and it's been proven that he has risen
[7:54] you say brothers how you how you gonna
[7:56] say it's been proven because i know he's
[7:58] in me
[8:00] i'm not what i used to be
[8:03] hallelujah
[8:04] oh my
[8:06] i feel my helper coming on
[8:09] church
[8:10] look
[8:11] when we think of god
[8:13] we have to understand holly
[8:16] that god is way bigger than the picture
[8:18] before our eyes
[8:20] hallelujah the the the scripture says
[8:23] hallelujah that he's greater he's bigger
[8:26] than whatever you can ask or think
[8:29] so whatever you're praying about
[8:30] whatever you're asking god for he's much
[8:33] more bigger than that
[8:35] however
[8:37] but when i figured i started thinking
[8:38] about this thought when i was in a hotel
[8:40] room thinking about god's material and
[8:42] thinking about what god what is god made
[8:45] of
[8:48] hallelujah
[8:49] now church what i'm going to talk about
[8:51] tonight
[8:53] it's not something that you could grasp
[8:55] in your flesh
[8:56] holy the revelation of jesus christ is
[9:00] something spiritual hardly
[9:02] and for you to grasp the material of god
[9:05] you got to see him for who he is
[9:08] and he's not weak
[9:10] he's not wishy-washy
[9:12] he's not a promise breaker holy
[9:15] everything about god is truth
[9:18] so whatever he said in his bible it has
[9:20] to come to pass church that's the
[9:23] material we're dealing with we're
[9:24] dealing with truth tonight
[9:26] we're not dealing with a god who's ever
[9:29] failed
[9:31] hallelujah he's never failed
[9:34] he's never failed no matter how big the
[9:37] situation was
[9:39] he's the god that he is and was and
[9:41] which is to come almighty
[9:48] but for you to kind of catch where i'm
[9:50] going
[9:51] i got to talk about some carnal things
[9:53] for a second
[10:00] because it's a challenge
[10:02] for some of you
[10:04] to just believe god for who he is
[10:05] because you got things in the natural
[10:07] realm that's messing with you
[10:10] listen
[10:12] listen what the what the prophet of god
[10:14] says
[10:14] i'm gonna read you some stuff i ain't
[10:16] gonna be too long on this but
[10:18] i just want you to be able to catch this
[10:22] listen
[10:24] now the prophet of god he says
[10:27] everything in the natural hallelujah is
[10:29] a type of what's going on in the spirit
[10:32] can we agree with that
[10:33] and we know how when he preached the
[10:35] message countdown he was showing that in
[10:38] each transition
[10:40] that things would happen naturally on
[10:42] the earth something spiritual was taking
[10:44] place
[10:45] he talked about the horse and buggy and
[10:47] then he talked about the car did he talk
[10:49] about the airplane then he talked about
[10:51] the astronaut age hallelujah and each
[10:53] one of those different natural
[10:55] manifestations was a type of what was
[10:58] going on spiritual now the greatest the
[11:01] greatest challenge that we've been
[11:03] fighting for maybe the past two years is
[11:06] something called covey
[11:08] but i want you to understand that
[11:10] there's a spiritual application behind
[11:13] clothes
[11:14] and i don't want you to fear this thing
[11:16] no more
[11:18] hell yeah it's only been here to magnify
[11:21] how great god is
[11:23] and you know what else covey did holly
[11:25] covet what it did is it's brought a fear
[11:29] all over the world
[11:31] fearing people's life fearing people's
[11:33] church harley and that's just a natural
[11:36] perversion of what really should be
[11:37] taking place
[11:39] the church shouldn't be fearing the
[11:41] church should be walking in the strength
[11:43] and power of god why because we have a
[11:45] god that doesn't change
[11:47] [Applause]
[11:50] church the prophet of god said for you
[11:53] to know god is you must first realize
[11:56] who he was
[11:57] holy so i'm saying to you that god even
[12:00] in this covenant era god was always a
[12:03] healer
[12:05] [Applause]
[12:07] always
[12:09] but what's happened is
[12:12] the spiritual mutation
[12:14] of the of the sickness of covet has
[12:17] overpowered our minds
[12:21] mutation holy
[12:22] let's look at it church
[12:25] mutation put that put that up for me
[12:27] brothers if you got that
[12:29] mutation explained
[12:31] listen look at what it says a mutation
[12:34] occurs when a dna gene is damaged or
[12:37] changed in such a way as to alter the
[12:41] genetic what
[12:50] look at the mutation of covet
[12:52] the whole reason is running all over the
[12:55] world like this and so it could alter
[12:58] the genetic
[12:59] message carried by the gene
[13:04] there is a genetic gene seed message in
[13:08] this bride that satan is trying to alter
[13:15] by something called sickness
[13:20] [Music]
[13:21] oh we're gonna snatch all the power away
[13:22] from it tonight
[13:25] we're gonna fear it no more
[13:28] we're gonna come back to that but let's
[13:30] just let's just let's just expose kobe
[13:32] for a second holly let me say it like
[13:34] this covet the sickness of covet the
[13:37] symptoms of covet have always been here
[13:44] it's always been here
[13:47] you say brother
[13:48] it just happened in 2020. no
[13:51] because if it was something new that
[13:52] would make the devil a creator
[13:57] and the only one i can create is the one
[14:00] who which was and is and is to come i am
[14:03] alpha and omega i am the beginning and
[14:06] the end he is the only one that holds
[14:09] the power of creation
[14:13] [Applause]
[14:15] so for doctors or anyone else to
[14:17] pronounce a sickness on the scene on the
[14:20] whole world it has to have already been
[14:22] here before
[14:27] and i know some of y'all gonna
[14:29] try to get real deep with me
[14:30] you got you got your scientist stuff you
[14:32] read and all this all these other things
[14:34] you're reading well let's let's well i
[14:36] accept the challenge tonight
[14:41] brother tony let's just take some
[14:43] symptoms of coffee
[14:45] has anybody here ever had a cough
[14:49] been here for generations
[14:52] can i get amen
[14:54] his oh my let's take one of the most
[14:57] powerful symptoms of kovic has anyone
[14:59] ever had a fever
[15:03] it's been here forever
[15:09] they say but brother digs the the
[15:11] effects of covet it does so many other
[15:13] stuff has have you ever heard of
[15:15] something called the flu
[15:18] it's been here forever
[15:22] and what you fail to realize
[15:24] what you fail to realize
[15:26] over 60 000 people
[15:29] die a year because of the
[15:31] flu
[15:36] and vaccinations
[15:38] is nothing new
[15:40] people have been getting a flu
[15:43] shot
[15:47] for years
[15:49] hardly
[15:50] and when they take the flu shot
[15:53] they still end up getting what the flu
[15:58] talk to me church
[16:00] am i making this stuff up
[16:02] or have we been experiencing this for
[16:04] years
[16:06] so what's making kovis so strong
[16:13] what's making it so strong
[16:16] we make it what it is
[16:19] because the flu has been here for
[16:20] generations coughing and sneezing and
[16:23] and dry throat and running eyes and oh
[16:26] my but what about this one brother jesus
[16:28] covet makes it hard to believe some
[16:30] people had fluid and they lost been here
[16:33] forever
[16:35] called pneumonia ever heard of that one
[16:39] so all the symptoms that they make up of
[16:42] covet have already been here
[16:46] but what's happened
[16:47] the sickness was mutating
[16:51] sherry what it was doing it was changing
[16:53] its form to seem like something it
[16:56] wasn't but what it is
[16:59] it changed its form into a cough but it
[17:01] was really just a regular coal
[17:04] it changed its form to the flu but it
[17:07] was really just a cough
[17:10] it didn't become any greater hallelujah
[17:14] it's still the same thing
[17:16] because satan can't create
[17:18] but what makes it strong is our
[17:20] confession
[17:24] [Applause]
[17:26] our confession makes sickness what it is
[17:29] earlier you could wake up in the morning
[17:31] and you can say oh i ain't feeling too
[17:33] good you better believe the rest of the
[17:34] day you ain't gonna feel too good
[17:36] because you just spoke that thing over
[17:38] yourself
[17:40] don't you realize hallelujah and we we
[17:42] might talk about some of this sunday
[17:44] hallelujah but don't you realize you
[17:46] have the power to create
[17:48] [Applause]
[17:51] and satan knows that so he wants your
[17:53] confession to be negative because
[17:55] whatever you say will take place
[17:58] [Applause]
[18:00] he knows who your father is he knows
[18:03] your genetic makeup how does he know
[18:05] that because god is protecting you
[18:09] you can't go through anything that god
[18:11] doesn't allow
[18:13] you can't get a cold you can't get a
[18:15] sneeze you can't get a fever you can't
[18:17] get a cough you can't get a high blood
[18:20] pressure you can't get none of it unless
[18:22] god said okay it's time for the trial
[18:30] he
[18:31] allows it
[18:33] why
[18:34] so that he can change masks
[18:38] so that he can step into another area of
[18:40] your life and still show that he's the
[18:43] god who which was
[18:45] and is
[18:47] and is to come right now
[18:51] so as satan mutates and changes his form
[18:54] god does the same thing
[18:56] hallelujah he comes and changes his form
[18:59] into sickness and god changes his form
[19:01] to healing hallelujah he comes and
[19:04] changes his form hallelujah to bondage
[19:06] and god changes his form to
[19:08] deliverance
[19:10] here satan comes and he changes his form
[19:13] to sadness and god changes his form to
[19:16] joy
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:20] oh yeah
[19:22] that's what his material is
[19:25] but look at it put it back up there
[19:27] look
[19:28] his whole job
[19:30] what these things are all about is
[19:32] hallelujah
[19:33] a mutation occurs when a dna gene is
[19:36] damaged sure how many message believers
[19:40] have left this church because they were
[19:42] damaged
[19:43] hardly they said oh the preacher did
[19:45] this so-and-so didn't shake my hand this
[19:48] and that and all these things damaged
[19:50] hardly
[19:51] that didn't mean that it wasn't gene
[19:55] but they let their hurts and their pains
[19:58] change their genetic message
[20:02] and now they're going to go through
[20:03] things that they wouldn't necessarily
[20:04] have to go through if they would have
[20:06] fought through that hurt if they would
[20:08] have fought through that pain
[20:10] because the trial does not change the
[20:13] life of the seed
[20:20] look
[20:21] carried a genetic message carried by
[20:24] that gene
[20:25] so i want you to understand church that
[20:28] we
[20:29] already
[20:30] have a genetic message inside of us
[20:35] i'm about to blow your socks off brother
[20:37] branham didn't bring it to us
[20:41] he was already there
[20:44] he was already there god used him as a
[20:46] masterpiece hallelujah to warm it up
[20:54] he said a mutagen is
[20:56] is an agent of a substance that can
[20:59] bring about a permanent alteration to
[21:02] the physical compulsive composition of a
[21:05] dna gene
[21:06] such that the genetic message is changed
[21:12] so when you come to church
[21:14] and you get hurt and you carry that
[21:16] stuff and carry that what is satan doing
[21:19] he's changing your genetics
[21:22] he's changing the way you worship
[21:24] he's changing the way you pray
[21:27] he's changing hallelujah your spiritual
[21:29] hallelujah walk with god
[21:31] all by some hurts
[21:35] a little bit of damage
[21:38] a little bit of unconfessed sins
[21:41] all these things happen because what is
[21:43] satan doing he's trying to get you not
[21:46] to believe in your message
[21:51] and we thought the message was books and
[21:53] tapes no clearly right here is saying
[21:55] it's a life
[22:00] hallelujah
[22:01] clearly the message is a life
[22:04] clearly your dna your gc makeup deals
[22:08] with a life
[22:10] and if satan can get you to alter that
[22:13] he can defeat you
[22:15] so what does he do he mutates
[22:18] he makes himself to be something that
[22:20] he's really not but he is
[22:29] i'm finished talking about him
[22:33] but let's wrap him up real quick
[22:35] brilliant what do you mean
[22:37] ain't no power in a cold
[22:42] ain't no power in cancer
[22:44] ain't no power and diabetes
[22:47] ain't no power in her blood
[22:50] ain't no power in back spasms
[22:52] hallelujah
[22:54] the only power the enemy got is what we
[22:57] surrender to by altering the message of
[23:00] god
[23:02] and if you don't let satan alter the
[23:04] message you'll walk out in power tonight
[23:11] he said brothers what message are you
[23:13] talking about
[23:14] i'm talking about the revelation of
[23:15] jesus christ
[23:17] that is the message
[23:18] don't you realize that
[23:20] that's all brother brother was talking
[23:21] about
[23:22] hallelujah oh the whole business was
[23:25] surrounded around what the revelation of
[23:27] jesus christ
[23:29] and satan knows if he can alter that
[23:31] hallelujah he can make you walk out on
[23:33] your promises
[23:39] oh my
[23:40] but listen
[23:42] we always hear about
[23:44] dna and connecting it with the blood and
[23:47] the gene
[23:48] and all these things
[23:49] and by no by by no means am i a doctor
[23:53] or any way in that field
[23:56] but i know one
[24:02] so i'm not going to talk to you tonight
[24:05] about the the
[24:07] the the makeup of dna
[24:09] no we're going to talk about tonight
[24:12] what dna does
[24:17] holly
[24:18] how many believe you've got the dna of
[24:20] god
[24:22] so we're going to talk about what that
[24:23] dna is to you holly what that dna should
[24:26] be doing in you and don't get nervous
[24:28] i'm about to close
[24:32] but i hope you catch it hallelujah
[24:35] give me the next part
[24:37] listen
[24:38] what does dna do
[24:40] dna contains
[24:42] the instructions needed for an organism
[24:44] to develop
[24:55] so if you got the dna of god in you
[24:59] there's something in you that gives you
[25:01] instructions to develop into what god
[25:08] [Applause]
[25:11] there's something in you holy whether
[25:13] you like it or not it's giving you power
[25:16] like the book of john said power to
[25:19] become something
[25:21] what is it doing it's changing us from
[25:23] glory to glory what's doing it the dna
[25:27] of god
[25:32] whereby tell me what dna is i can't
[25:36] i'm telling you what it does
[25:40] so if you believe you got the gene of
[25:42] god in you
[25:43] let's look at it
[25:46] what does it do
[25:48] it contains the instructions
[25:51] needed for an organism to develop
[25:55] develop is the first part
[25:57] and what do we say when we explain
[25:59] mutation
[26:00] mutation deals with a genetic message
[26:04] so hallelujah as god changes and he
[26:07] mutates in your life what is he doing
[26:09] he's giving instructions for us to what
[26:12] develop
[26:15] but not only develop hallelujah what
[26:17] does he want us to do he want us to
[26:19] survive
[26:22] hallelujah here we are two years later
[26:25] still serving god still having meetings
[26:28] still rejoicing in the spirit we
[26:30] survived in church
[26:32] how do we survive by god's dna
[26:38] hallelujah
[26:40] survive and reproduce why to carry these
[26:44] functions hallelujah
[26:48] what is it all about
[26:50] we're supposed to be carrying god to the
[26:52] next place
[26:54] hallelujah the development of god the
[26:56] survival of god hallelujah the
[26:58] reproduction of god
[27:01] holy now we're talking about god's
[27:03] material hallelujah look church dna
[27:06] sequences must be converted into what
[27:16] you mean to tell me
[27:18] i had a message in me before the
[27:20] foundation of the world
[27:23] gideon it was in my dna
[27:26] hallelujah
[27:27] brother told me it was in my dna
[27:30] even when i was a sinner out in the
[27:32] world i had a message in me
[27:37] let me give you young people something
[27:38] hallelujah when you were born you were
[27:40] born with a message in you
[27:46] oh we're gonna make the devil mad now
[27:49] before you got the holy ghost you had a
[27:51] message in you
[27:54] [Applause]
[28:01] they say these sequences must be
[28:03] converted into messages that can be used
[28:05] to produce protein
[28:10] now we like to work out
[28:12] holiday
[28:13] and everybody knows
[28:15] your muscles are never never developed
[28:17] without protein
[28:19] so what am i saying brothers what are
[28:21] you saying tonight that the message of
[28:23] the hour is our spiritual protest
[28:30] the more we eat
[28:31] the stronger we get
[28:34] hallelujah
[28:36] to carry out hallelujah
[28:38] what god wants us to do amen
[28:40] see you can exercise and exercise and
[28:43] your body will just flop but if you
[28:45] exercise and put protein in it you'll
[28:47] become a leaning muscle machine
[28:56] we don't want to just drop weight no we
[28:58] want to drop weight and strength bill
[29:02] [Applause]
[29:04] see a lot of people have just hooked on
[29:06] to ah i got the message i got a nice
[29:08] diet i got a good diet yeah a diet is
[29:11] all right but you got to have the right
[29:13] things in your diet
[29:15] because some people have diets they
[29:17] can't keep up
[29:19] which is only wishful thinking
[29:23] but the best kind of diet is a reality
[29:26] diet
[29:29] see my diet still has a little bit of
[29:31] chocolate cake in it
[29:37] just not more than what it used to holly
[29:41] still has a little bit of barbecue
[29:42] chicken in it
[29:44] see i'm a realist
[29:46] let's put scripture hallelujah sister
[29:49] let's put the scripture in the proper
[29:50] order the bible says be sober
[29:55] be vigilant what does sober mean sober
[29:57] means to understand what you're doing
[30:01] and some people got so drunk i got
[30:03] revelation i got regular god over the
[30:05] seal i got revelations rambling first
[30:07] trial pune they gone
[30:12] because they didn't have no endurance
[30:14] for the child
[30:16] they was eating good but they wasn't
[30:17] processing the whole thing
[30:21] oh my look
[30:23] be
[30:24] converted into messages that can be used
[30:27] to produce protein which are the complex
[30:30] molecules that do the most of the work
[30:33] in your body
[30:37] so what am i saying all this good
[30:39] preaching y'all good all this good
[30:41] preaching look it's not them it's not me
[30:43] it's not none of us what's producing it
[30:45] that good word you get
[30:48] it's the word that's turning you into
[30:51] what you're supposed to be
[30:53] the prophet of god said what the message
[30:55] of the hour has been doing all this time
[30:58] it has been positionally placing the
[31:01] bride of christ
[31:05] and what has happened to a lot of people
[31:07] through the battle they've got hurting
[31:08] and damage and they allow satan to
[31:11] genetically alter their message
[31:16] but if we got god's dna in us hallelujah
[31:19] we got overcoming power
[31:24] we got some serious material
[31:28] oh my
[31:29] listen
[31:32] oh my
[31:33] let's look at god's makeup for a second
[31:36] now the bible says that god is a spirit
[31:39] now let's watch god mutate
[31:42] we know how satan mutated we'll just
[31:44] take cover and see all the different
[31:46] things that he mutated let's let god
[31:48] mutate for a second are you with me
[31:51] when god
[31:52] when he first stepped on the scene he
[31:54] wasn't even god
[31:55] he was just eternal
[31:58] so the makeup of god is eternal
[32:01] so if you've got god in you
[32:03] you are eternal
[32:05] there's nothing about you that can be
[32:07] extinct
[32:08] there's nothing about you that can come
[32:10] to an end why because the material of
[32:12] god is forever
[32:17] the blessings of god is forever
[32:20] the healing of god is forever the joy of
[32:22] god is forever
[32:24] why because his whole makeup his
[32:26] material starts with him being eternal
[32:36] and if you're here tonight
[32:37] and you're not safe
[32:39] all i got to say to you is
[32:41] i'm sorry for you
[32:45] because if a man was telling me i had
[32:46] something eternal in me
[32:49] that couldn't be extinct
[32:52] that would do something to me
[32:56] church
[32:57] we have an eternal joy
[33:00] no matter what satan throws at you it
[33:03] always has to mute back into mutate back
[33:05] into the character of god
[33:09] it always has to turn back into its
[33:11] original hallelujah creation
[33:14] it's original material hallelujah
[33:17] hallelujah
[33:18] and in the original state of god there
[33:21] was no wrong
[33:27] he was eternal
[33:28] and then god started to mutate
[33:31] and then hollywood the prophet of god
[33:33] said he was so high he couldn't go no
[33:35] higher
[33:41] i want you to understand the god i'm
[33:43] talking about if you got the holy ghost
[33:46] is in you
[33:49] anybody here got the holy ghost
[33:52] oh you got eternity in you
[33:55] you got eternity in you you got to hold
[33:57] let me see the holy ghost hand you got
[33:59] eternity in you
[34:01] you got eternity in you
[34:03] before there was ever a while you were
[34:05] eternal
[34:07] you were made of it you were made of
[34:09] material that cannot expire
[34:12] [Applause]
[34:15] whoa
[34:17] i feel light for it
[34:20] you know the prophet god said
[34:22] when the disciples was walking down the
[34:24] mayor's road
[34:25] and jesus had revealed himself to him he
[34:28] said they walked out of that light for
[34:30] it
[34:32] why because they had been in fellowship
[34:34] with jesus
[34:36] they problems had no more weight on them
[34:39] why because they heard from jesus
[34:42] jesus had shown himself who they were
[34:44] who he was he said all the prophets
[34:47] talked about me
[34:52] church
[34:53] one of god's material is he's eternal
[34:58] but then as god began to
[35:00] change his mask as he began to mutate he
[35:04] couldn't go higher so he started
[35:05] condescending
[35:09] he started coming down
[35:13] hallelujah god's not coming down
[35:15] hallelujah and as he came down from
[35:17] eternal next next next form he mutated
[35:20] into was elohim
[35:24] now he's self-existent hallelujah he's
[35:27] god all by himself where he came to tell
[35:30] the church tell all of us that he don't
[35:32] need no help
[35:34] hallelujah he don't need no help from
[35:36] theraflu he don't need no help from
[35:38] vaccinations he don't need no help from
[35:40] sugar pills
[35:42] insulin shots he's self-existence
[35:44] hallelujah
[35:46] hallelujah
[35:50] church but what i love about it
[35:52] as god mutated
[35:54] as he mutated into elohim he didn't
[35:57] leave eternity up there he brought that
[35:59] with him
[36:04] [Applause]
[36:09] can you imagine that church
[36:11] that your god he didn't leave any of his
[36:14] material back
[36:15] he kept bringing his material with as he
[36:17] mutated he took the eternal eternal part
[36:21] of him and he brought that to the next
[36:22] stage of his mutation so now he's he's a
[36:26] eternal
[36:27] oh my
[36:29] god he's the eternal elohim hallelujah
[36:33] self-existing one
[36:37] okay
[36:40] let's just take that word self-existent
[36:44] if you really
[36:46] serve him
[36:48] if you really get a revelation
[36:50] about who he is
[36:52] these problems these trials we go
[36:54] through wouldn't mean a thing
[36:59] eternal
[37:01] elohim
[37:06] and then church he kept mutating
[37:10] and then only
[37:12] the bible says i mean the prophet god
[37:14] said that
[37:15] he was just all by himself but then
[37:17] there were attributes inside of him
[37:20] that he wanted to come out so he had to
[37:22] allow certain things to happen so he
[37:25] could express himself early
[37:27] hallelujah see he didn't want to keep
[37:29] eternity to himself he wanted to share
[37:32] eternity
[37:33] whoa hallelujah
[37:35] god wanted to share eternity with us
[37:38] so he didn't just leave it up there all
[37:40] by himself he brought it down
[37:42] hallelujah it didn't turn hallelujah he
[37:45] wanted to show us how powerful he was
[37:47] just being self-existent there's no god
[37:50] like me in all the earth he brought that
[37:53] and he shared that with us
[37:58] but we weren't even there yet
[38:02] because he was just eternal and
[38:03] self-existent and then the prophet of
[38:05] god say hallelujah
[38:07] what made him god was when he created
[38:10] things to worship him
[38:13] he created the angels and the angels
[38:16] began to worship but that wasn't good
[38:18] enough for god
[38:21] god don't want to worship just out of
[38:23] duty
[38:25] so although he appreciated the angels
[38:28] worshiping holy holy holy lord god
[38:31] almighty holy holy lord god almighty god
[38:34] began to mutate again
[38:37] now he's god he's an object of worship
[38:39] but he wanted to make it more personal
[38:41] so you know what he did he let the logos
[38:43] come out of his mouth
[38:45] whoa hallelujah did he begin to create
[38:49] hallelujah
[38:50] all right he's mutating that church he
[38:53] comes from eternal he comes from elohim
[38:56] he comes from god and now the logos is
[38:58] coming out of his mouth he's creating
[39:00] what is he doing he say let there be and
[39:03] it was let there be and it was let there
[39:06] be and it was and the last thing he
[39:08] created out of the logos was what a man
[39:18] god brought eternity
[39:22] god brought
[39:23] his self-existing character
[39:25] god
[39:26] brought the object of worship
[39:29] and then he brought the logos
[39:31] all the way down to a man
[39:39] everything that he is all of his
[39:41] material
[39:42] he put it in what
[39:44] a man
[39:47] because you've seen all of this material
[39:50] reflected in who adam
[39:53] because in the garden of eden there was
[39:55] no death
[39:57] why because god was eternal
[39:59] holy adam didn't need nobody's help as
[40:02] hell why because god was elohim
[40:05] hallelujah
[40:07] and he did who do they worship they
[40:08] worship him why because he was the
[40:10] object and the only object alone
[40:13] and god took all of his characteristics
[40:15] mutated down put all of that in a man
[40:18] but what i want you to catch after he
[40:20] got to a man he never mutated again
[40:27] hallelujah
[40:29] after he got to you god never changed
[40:32] his form again
[40:35] [Applause]
[40:37] so on earth we are the highest form of
[40:41] god
[40:45] are you with me church
[40:47] on earth
[40:49] we are the highest form of god
[40:51] because after he created a man the bible
[40:53] says that god willing what took his rest
[40:58] so god was satisfied giving you all of
[41:02] his material
[41:05] everything that he is he put it in a man
[41:08] he put it in a woman
[41:10] all of his characteristics all of his uh
[41:13] his ability everything that makes up god
[41:16] he put it in a man and he said it was
[41:18] good
[41:22] i don't know about y'all but that make
[41:23] me want to shout
[41:26] you mean to tell me i can
[41:28] i can go into prayer as a god
[41:35] but you know too often because we got
[41:36] spiritual amnesia
[41:38] we get in the prayer we were like oh
[41:40] lord this sickness oh my arm hurting i
[41:44] got a headache oh they diagnosed me with
[41:47] grace disease okay
[41:54] and if you got the holy ghost
[41:57] all the material of god
[42:03] and just to show you how powerful the
[42:04] holy ghost is the prophet of god said
[42:06] when you got the holy ghost the holy
[42:08] ghost is the earnest of the resurrection
[42:12] hallelujah
[42:13] so if you got the holy ghost you already
[42:15] in heavenly places
[42:17] you're already destined for a rapture
[42:20] [Applause]
[42:22] hallelujah
[42:27] let me show you how big this is just
[42:30] think about it
[42:31] because i know i got to go to a natural
[42:32] realm because i think some of y'all
[42:34] missing how great god is
[42:37] you
[42:37] you looking at me like this
[42:47] what i'm talking about deserves more
[42:49] than a smirk on your face
[42:55] if you really catch it you will never be
[42:58] defeated again
[43:01] if you really catch that the character
[43:03] of god hallelujah the whole gene genetic
[43:06] makeup of god he put in his bride if you
[43:09] really catch that you'll walk up out
[43:11] here like a rooster in the barnyard
[43:18] walk around say look my yard around here
[43:22] you'll go home tonight for satan's been
[43:23] troubling you too much you can't get no
[43:25] sleep you got to take metatolin and all
[43:27] this stuff calm yourself this will be
[43:29] the last night you take it
[43:32] say don't you know i serve a god who
[43:34] promised me a rest
[43:37] who promised me peace
[43:39] you stop watching all them crazy tv
[43:41] shows you will be all right when you go
[43:43] to sleep
[43:47] i wonder why you're having nightmares
[43:49] because the foolishness you're watching
[43:50] on tv
[44:01] we think about the genetic makeup of god
[44:03] and all that he put in his creation it
[44:06] should do something for us
[44:10] it's like this
[44:12] you ever heard of warren buffett
[44:15] he's what a billionaire
[44:17] imagine him imagining one of his
[44:19] children
[44:22] going to a ferrari dealership
[44:24] and just got on regular clothes
[44:27] started to walk around
[44:29] and see the most expensive
[44:32] ferrari it is
[44:35] he tells the salesman
[44:36] i won't doubt
[44:38] and sells me judging by how you look
[44:42] don't even know who he is
[44:44] just looking at his outer appearance
[44:47] see our outer appearance we look like
[44:49] nothing
[44:50] but there's a hidden mystery behind us
[44:56] there's something behind us in the
[44:58] spirit that whole realm is paying
[45:00] attention
[45:02] when you walk in the room angels are
[45:04] looking at you when you walk in the room
[45:07] spirits are checking themselves making
[45:09] sure they still got rights or they'll be
[45:11] cast out
[45:13] making sure you don't confess because if
[45:15] you confess they got to go
[45:19] hallelujah can you imagine hallelujah
[45:22] buffett's son walking up in there saying
[45:24] i want a spot i want whatever kind of
[45:26] fire whatever it is i don't know
[45:28] i'm a maserati man
[45:33] which has a ferrari engine in it
[45:37] but anyway
[45:39] can you imagine he going in there and
[45:41] talking to the agent
[45:43] and the agent is judging him on his
[45:44] appearance does not know the material
[45:47] he's made out of
[45:49] does not know who his father is
[45:53] hallelujah
[45:55] if he knew who his father was he'd be
[45:57] careful what he said
[46:03] and when you get the holy spirit satan
[46:05] has to be careful how he approaches you
[46:12] because your father has power to bring
[46:15] judgment on him
[46:17] your father has power hallelujah to make
[46:19] him change zip codes
[46:23] when you really realize who your father
[46:26] is and the genetic makeup inside of you
[46:29] you handle yourself different
[46:30] [Applause]
[46:37] when i go to the doctor i tell the
[46:39] doctor what's going to happen
[46:43] you're going to examine me and you're
[46:44] going to give me a perfect bill of
[46:46] health
[46:50] and i walk out with that every time
[46:53] i ain't saying it don't be challenges
[46:55] sometimes i have to fight for it
[46:56] hallelujah but that's my confession
[46:58] hallelujah my confession is hallelujah i
[47:01] came in here ho and i'ma leave out of
[47:03] here ho why because jesus is my father
[47:09] i'm made out of material that's called
[47:12] victory
[47:17] we are made out of victorious material
[47:20] we're made out of persevering material
[47:23] we're made out of overcoming material
[47:27] don't you realize the bible says that
[47:30] jesus was tempted in all points all
[47:32] matters so as we were yet without sin
[47:38] what are you saying believe i'm saying
[47:40] the dna genetic makeup of god cannot be
[47:44] defeated
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:54] all the other says
[47:57] just give the man this id
[48:02] and sometimes they don't catch it at
[48:03] first
[48:04] but they start looking at that last man
[48:08] buff it buff it
[48:10] by any chance
[48:12] you ever heard of warren buffett
[48:14] yeah he's my dad
[48:18] oh mr buffett what can i get what what
[48:20] you want you want some coffee want
[48:22] something to drink anything you need see
[48:23] the whole demeanor changes why because
[48:26] that young man reminds them who he is
[48:30] and i want somebody tonight to remind
[48:33] the devil who you are
[48:36] and i guarantee you he will handle you
[48:38] different
[48:40] when you realize who you are but satan
[48:42] won't back up if you got amnesia
[48:45] but if you realize who you are it makes
[48:47] him take note of it hallelujah
[48:50] and that's been the problem we've been
[48:52] down here having church so long we're
[48:54] not even walking into our
[49:00] promises it's bigger than church
[49:04] it's bigger than church
[49:06] and god
[49:07] the last place he got
[49:10] was down to a man he brought all of that
[49:15] before i close
[49:17] listen
[49:19] you know man they try to make
[49:21] light
[49:23] of god's mutation
[49:26] and they called it evolution
[49:31] they gotta take it completely away from
[49:33] god and say well it was just a big bang
[49:40] i don't know about y'all but i've had
[49:41] conversation with atheists
[49:45] and i'll just be honest no offense
[49:47] it's a bunch of nonsense
[49:51] because this one particular guy i was
[49:52] talking to he says
[49:54] i just don't believe that there's some
[49:56] higher entity
[49:57] that
[49:58] controls the whole world and i said well
[50:00] you might as well get used to it
[50:05] because
[50:06] it's the truth the whole truth and
[50:09] nothing but the truth so help me god
[50:15] he says well now i just
[50:17] uh
[50:18] your your testimony it has to be proven
[50:22] you know i have to see the paperwork of
[50:23] you having cancer and did i have to see
[50:26] the paperwork where you were uh
[50:28] cancer-free
[50:32] he forgot he was talking to somebody who
[50:33] knew who his father was
[50:36] he's looking for me to give him
[50:38] something naturally didn't i tell you
[50:39] god is a spirit
[50:42] hallelujah so he's asking for paperwork
[50:45] and i started showing him testimonies
[50:47] hallelujah i said you see this cut this
[50:49] is where they did a biopsy you see this
[50:51] cut this is where they need a shunt you
[50:53] see this cut this is where they took the
[50:56] majority of the cast out i said i don't
[50:58] need no paperwork
[51:00] i am the paperwork
[51:06] will you see me hallelujah
[51:08] you see the testimony of jesus christ
[51:11] when you see me
[51:13] you see the revelation of divine healing
[51:17] when you see me hallelujah you see
[51:20] deliverance when you see me you see the
[51:23] manifestation of isaiah 53
[51:27] i don't need no paperwork
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:35] hallelujah
[51:37] church we don't need a bible to prove
[51:39] that it's real prove it by your life
[51:42] [Applause]
[51:46] you don't need a book and a tape to
[51:48] prove that it's real moving by your
[51:51] revelation
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:59] remember
[52:00] all that god mutated to he said
[52:03] hallelujah
[52:05] in john 12 and the word became flesh
[52:10] he put it all in us
[52:14] but what i want you to catch what god
[52:15] has been doing all this time with every
[52:18] trial with every tribulation of me let
[52:21] me read this
[52:24] oh my
[52:25] don't get nervous i'm about to close
[52:30] you know what the guy told me he says
[52:33] he's talking about evolution he says
[52:35] well there was a
[52:36] a big bang
[52:38] five billion years i said oh oh oh oh
[52:42] five billion years ago
[52:44] so yeah five billion years ago was big
[52:46] stop stop stop stop stop
[52:50] breaking point
[52:51] for the breaks
[52:53] now you telling me i'm believing it's
[52:54] something that i can't see
[52:56] but then you're gonna tell me five
[52:58] billion years ago and you said me you
[53:01] told me everything has to be proven
[53:03] he said yes everything has to be proven
[53:05] i said okay and you said big bang five
[53:07] billion years ago a half knowledge he
[53:09] says yes i said were you there
[53:15] if everything has to be proven he would
[53:17] have had to be there for that to happen
[53:19] or else he'll be taking somebody else's
[53:22] word for it like i am
[53:25] [Applause]
[53:30] but once i believe in what i believe in
[53:32] it becomes a real life material
[53:37] i can say i was there hallelujah when he
[53:40] was on the cross because i was in his
[53:42] jeans hallelujah i was there when he
[53:45] went down to hell and he said satan
[53:47] where you at
[53:49] when he said drugs where you at
[53:51] alcohol demon where you at high blood
[53:54] castle where you at the master has come
[53:57] down to hell
[53:58] [Applause]
[54:00] the master is here in hell depression
[54:03] where you at
[54:04] suicide demon where you at
[54:07] the master is in hell now
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:12] hallelujah
[54:15] home problems and all these other
[54:17] problems all these other sickness and
[54:18] diseases where you're at
[54:21] the master is in hell
[54:24] and i've come to take control of death
[54:27] hell and the grave
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:34] that's what our god has done
[54:38] master went down in the hell
[54:40] wow
[54:42] think about the church hallelujah he
[54:44] mutated down to a man just so he could
[54:47] strip satan from all his authority
[54:52] let's go there for a second
[54:55] he's on the cross
[54:57] crucified gives up the ghost
[54:59] and when he gives up the ghost he
[55:01] changed dimensions
[55:06] he changed dimensions and he wakes up in
[55:08] hell hallelujah
[55:10] hallelujah
[55:11] his body is on the cross but his spirit
[55:13] now is in another dimension
[55:15] where satan thought he had all power and
[55:17] god starts to walk through hell
[55:19] hallelujah and they start to
[55:22] make a way like the red sea why because
[55:24] the masters is taking possession of hell
[55:31] church
[55:33] our god
[55:34] owns the hell that you're sitting in
[55:40] you say brother jesus i'm going through
[55:41] hell and i'm telling you god owns it
[55:49] i can see it brother paul
[55:50] i can see god
[55:52] i call this the
[55:53] the cavalry step hallelujah when he
[55:56] takes a step hardly in hell and you know
[55:58] when somebody see that you have
[55:59] authority all they can do is sit back
[56:01] and look and watch you stay up
[56:03] so jesus take a step holly and they
[56:06] looking at everybody moving out of the
[56:07] way as he takes a step and he's
[56:09] possessing and possessing and he takes a
[56:11] step and maybe a demon stands up and
[56:14] jesus said sit down
[56:18] the master is here
[56:20] and maybe he takes another step hardly
[56:23] and the spirit of heartache and pain
[56:25] stands up and jesus says sit down
[56:28] i told you the master is here
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:32] and he took a step and he took a step
[56:34] and he took a step all the way to
[56:35] satan's prison house
[56:41] and not only did he take a step but he
[56:44] met satan face to face
[56:46] holy look him in his eye hallelujah then
[56:48] turns him around and say you got no
[56:51] right
[56:52] [Applause]
[56:55] snatches the keys from him
[56:59] and then he says
[57:00] your house
[57:02] has become my house
[57:07] don't y'all realize
[57:09] god
[57:10] is the only one that allows people to go
[57:13] to hell
[57:16] satan don't even control that
[57:19] it's up to god who he allows to go
[57:21] because the scripture says he'll have
[57:23] mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy
[57:27] so satan can come and say well they did
[57:29] this and they did that and god said shut
[57:31] up
[57:32] this is my house
[57:35] better yet get out
[57:42] think about it i want you to catch this
[57:44] i know i'm very dramatic
[57:49] but this is what heaven's gonna be like
[57:54] think about it church think about it
[57:57] everything is owned by god
[58:02] he even has control of satan's destiny
[58:09] he allows him to be whatever he wants
[58:11] him to be
[58:12] remember he told job you can do whatever
[58:14] you want to do you just can't take his
[58:16] life
[58:21] and he's still doing the same thing
[58:22] today
[58:23] because that's the god he was
[58:26] that's the god he is today
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:31] in church you think about that's who we
[58:33] serve that's the material that's in this
[58:35] god
[58:45] the worst thing you can do to me
[58:51] it's trying to get me to back down on
[58:53] what i believe
[58:55] and i'm preaching that night
[59:01] because if i'm preaching that night
[59:04] and you didn't basically challenge me on
[59:06] what i believe
[59:07] my whole message gonna be geared towards
[59:09] you
[59:12] nobody else might not know but you gonna
[59:14] know
[59:16] cause i want you to understand it's the
[59:19] anointing that breaks yokes
[59:22] and if i can just get out of the way god
[59:24] can deal with you if you are have the
[59:27] dna of god
[59:28] if i can get out of the way and god can
[59:30] let that message go forth hallelujah and
[59:33] dictate and do what it's supposed to do
[59:35] harlow he'll get you even if you profess
[59:38] him not to be a believer
[59:42] and that same young man
[59:44] blue rap i preach i preach
[59:47] and i preach
[59:48] he's looking at me trying not to look at
[59:50] me and preach
[59:51] preach
[59:52] he looking at me trying not to look at
[59:54] me
[59:55] but i made sure he looked at me
[59:58] hallelujah and i preached and we
[1:00:00] preached and the holy spirit came down
[1:00:03] and his girlfriend who was a believer
[1:00:06] and she was backsliding and she was
[1:00:07] trying to come back but now she got this
[1:00:09] this baggage
[1:00:11] this unbelieving baggage
[1:00:15] that's what happens when young people
[1:00:16] get hurt they go out in the world
[1:00:18] looking for love and they pick up some
[1:00:20] baggage
[1:00:21] they pick up baggage with a genetic
[1:00:24] message inside of them that's pulling
[1:00:26] them back with this baggage
[1:00:31] oh my
[1:00:32] some of them come back with two babies
[1:00:34] three babies
[1:00:37] but you ain't gonna stop that message
[1:00:39] hallelujah
[1:00:41] you ain't gonna stop that message inside
[1:00:43] of you
[1:00:45] you might have a lot of baggage but
[1:00:46] you're gonna come back where you're
[1:00:48] supposed to be wow
[1:00:52] [Applause]
[1:00:53] church
[1:00:54] and as we preached that girl the
[1:00:57] anointing hit us she just started
[1:00:59] shouting he never seen her shout before
[1:01:01] what was happening she was connecting to
[1:01:03] the message
[1:01:05] whoa
[1:01:06] whoa that dna was coming alive
[1:01:08] hallelujah right there in the midst in
[1:01:11] her condition hallelujah with a
[1:01:13] backslidden boyfriend and all the stuff
[1:01:15] right there hearing the message she came
[1:01:17] alive
[1:01:20] that dna started developing right there
[1:01:22] overcoming and surviving to reproduce
[1:01:25] right there hallelujah with an
[1:01:28] unbelieving boyfriend
[1:01:36] everybody all right
[1:01:39] and i can see the look on his face
[1:01:45] see the reason why people say they don't
[1:01:47] believe in god because they've never
[1:01:48] been in his presence
[1:01:51] if you ever get in this presence it'll
[1:01:53] change what you believe
[1:01:57] and what i want you to realize his
[1:01:59] presence is in flesh now
[1:02:06] we have the ability to create an
[1:02:08] atmosphere that will save souls
[1:02:11] they ain't got to see a pill of fire
[1:02:14] don't y'all realize the pillar fire
[1:02:16] became a man
[1:02:18] hallelujah
[1:02:19] hallelujah as long as jesus was on the
[1:02:21] earth you never saw the pillar of fire
[1:02:24] why because he was the pillar fire
[1:02:28] church
[1:02:30] and that young lady started to shout
[1:02:33] then the girls behind started to shout
[1:02:35] the young people on this side started
[1:02:36] shouting next thing you know the whole
[1:02:38] church started shouting and dancing and
[1:02:40] he was in there like
[1:02:46] then they started coming to the altar
[1:02:48] to get right
[1:02:51] what was happening god was connecting
[1:02:52] with his material
[1:02:55] it started coming to the altar
[1:02:58] surprise surprise
[1:03:01] guess who came to the altar
[1:03:05] that very same young man who said he
[1:03:06] didn't believe in god
[1:03:09] was that the altar
[1:03:15] and you know what
[1:03:17] last i heard
[1:03:20] he was looking for a message church
[1:03:25] so you can be god's material and not
[1:03:27] even know it
[1:03:28] until you get in the right atmosphere
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:38] listen
[1:03:40] you just take evolution listen
[1:03:43] he says now when god made a man in his
[1:03:45] image
[1:03:46] he was a spirit man
[1:03:48] and then
[1:03:49] there was no man to till the soil
[1:03:51] then he created man out of the dust of
[1:03:53] the earth
[1:03:54] now
[1:03:55] chronologists and so forth and these
[1:03:58] people that search and get old bones and
[1:04:00] so forth believe in evolution this is
[1:04:03] what the prophet says
[1:04:05] i believe in the right kind of evolution
[1:04:07] listen
[1:04:08] he said man
[1:04:10] ever lose from himself
[1:04:13] but not at all from one cell
[1:04:16] no sir because a bird has been a bird
[1:04:19] since god made him a bird and a monkey
[1:04:22] has been a monkey a man has been a man
[1:04:26] that's right
[1:04:27] so what he's saying is man ever loots
[1:04:30] from himself
[1:04:32] not from another cell
[1:04:34] hallelujah
[1:04:36] so y'all see what evolution is
[1:04:39] right kind of evolution
[1:04:42] now let's look at the church in my
[1:04:43] closing god mutated down hallelujah all
[1:04:48] the way from eternal to elohim to god
[1:04:52] the logos to a man hallelujah
[1:04:54] are you with me
[1:04:56] that was god's evolution so when he got
[1:04:58] to man man also had to evolute but we're
[1:05:02] not evoluting down we're ever looting
[1:05:04] back up hallelujah
[1:05:06] so we're evolution hallelujah
[1:05:09] turn oh wow
[1:05:12] oh my we're evoluting also church army
[1:05:15] we're mutating church we're mutating
[1:05:17] with god's material from a man to the
[1:05:19] logos to god
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:26] we're mutating back up amen
[1:05:33] from man to the logos which is giving us
[1:05:35] a spoken word
[1:05:37] and the only ones that can speak the
[1:05:38] spoken word is a god hallelujah and to
[1:05:41] be god you got to be self-existing and
[1:05:43] to be self-existing you must be eternal
[1:05:48] so god mutated down to us so we could
[1:05:52] mutate back up to him
[1:06:01] come musicians i'm
[1:06:03] so
[1:06:06] you say where brother needs
[1:06:08] what is god's material
[1:06:11] his material is a spirit-being
[1:06:16] so when you live in the spirit
[1:06:18] you manifest the character material of
[1:06:22] god
[1:06:24] so that's the challenge to us
[1:06:27] when we come to worship we want to
[1:06:29] worship in spirit and in truth
[1:06:32] when we come to hear the word we come to
[1:06:35] hear spirit and in truth
[1:06:38] hallelujah see it's the truth which
[1:06:41] brings us back to god's original
[1:06:43] material
[1:06:44] that's why god had to bring a prophet on
[1:06:47] the scene because that prophet would
[1:06:49] unfold unveil what the truth
[1:06:52] because from generation to generation
[1:06:55] denominations were hiding the truth
[1:06:58] so god holly
[1:06:59] about for the prophet hallelujah with a
[1:07:02] sound amen that could only be heard
[1:07:05] by truth
[1:07:07] praise the lord
[1:07:09] we're here
[1:07:10] because we responded to what truth
[1:07:18] see
[1:07:19] you don't have to prove anything to
[1:07:20] anybody
[1:07:22] all you got to do is live your life
[1:07:26] you live your life in truth
[1:07:28] it'll show who god is
[1:07:31] hallelujah
[1:07:32] and i'm not i'm not i'm not trying to be
[1:07:34] deep
[1:07:35] but i want us to realize
[1:07:38] who do we search
[1:07:41] we all got needs i got needs i got
[1:07:43] something i'm praying about right now
[1:07:45] but
[1:07:45] in me praying and and all that i believe
[1:07:48] god
[1:07:51] this ain't a time to be backpedaling
[1:07:57] because god's character's made a victory
[1:08:01] hallelujah
[1:08:02] like i said earlier god's character is
[1:08:04] made of overcoming power
[1:08:07] that's who he was and that's who he is
[1:08:10] and that's who we shall be forever
[1:08:17] and satan can't stop it
[1:08:21] because what this message is doing this
[1:08:24] message hallelujah is connecting with my
[1:08:27] genetic makeup
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:33] he said brothers i don't know about that
[1:08:34] i'm gonna make it real simple before i
[1:08:36] close
[1:08:40] it's probably not
[1:08:42] too many
[1:08:43] saints in here that were born before 65.
[1:08:49] i ain't gonna see that
[1:08:52] well it might not be y'all look like a
[1:08:54] pretty young crowd
[1:08:57] but let's just say
[1:08:59] you were born
[1:09:01] after
[1:09:03] 1960
[1:09:04] right
[1:09:07] that was probably five years to hit a
[1:09:09] prophet
[1:09:10] and you probably didn't hear him then
[1:09:11] because he was a baby
[1:09:14] and then in 65 he died
[1:09:16] you hit me ken
[1:09:18] 65 he was gone right
[1:09:21] but look
[1:09:22] billy graham was still here
[1:09:26] preaching that word preaching preaching
[1:09:28] that word
[1:09:29] why didn't you connect with his message
[1:09:34] why didn't you connect with his voice
[1:09:38] it was a wrong message for your dna
[1:09:43] all robbers was here
[1:09:46] why aren't you in the pentecostal move
[1:09:47] right now
[1:09:49] because it was the wrong message for
[1:09:51] your dna
[1:09:54] but to show you how powerful the genetic
[1:09:57] makeup is hallelujah you could connect
[1:10:00] with a voice and a man not even be here
[1:10:07] oh
[1:10:10] oh my honey
[1:10:12] wow yet billy graham and all robbers on
[1:10:15] the scene me not connecting with them me
[1:10:18] connecting with a a man who's not even
[1:10:20] present
[1:10:23] because we didn't connect with flesh
[1:10:26] we're connected with god who is a spirit
[1:10:33] that's what we connect with we connect
[1:10:34] with the spirit
[1:10:36] we're not connecting with jeffersonville
[1:10:38] we're not connecting with belt buckles
