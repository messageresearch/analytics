========================================

is the Lord will read a scripture couple scriptures tonight Luke chapter 10 and verse 21 Luke chapter 10 and verse 21. in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit I like reading that praise the Lord because there's another place that Jesus was troubled in his Spirit the night he was with Judas so Jesus had a spirit and kind of sometimes was affected his soul wasn't affected but his Spirit was affected he was troubled in his Spirit but here I want you to notice Jesus was rejoicing in his spirit makes you curious to know what he was rejoicing about in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and hath revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sights so it makes the it made Christ rejoice and this is something that triggers and moves the heart of God and that is when he can reveal himself not through intellect but by Revelation and he can show his elect the hidden things it says it's refresh Jesus Spirit he said oh this is wonderful father I thank you that you've set it up this way and I always say I'm thankful he set it up this way because the the person with a higher IQ than me would be able to figure more of the word out than me this is not for the wise and prudent we don't figure it out here the Father the father brings it to your soul by Revelation and to his elect can you say amen and that's what made Jesus rejoice in his spirit all things he said all things are delivered for me of my father and no man uh knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will revealed now Mark 4 is the other place that he talks about the hidden things and this is after the disciples were here asking them about The Parables he was talking about and you're familiar with this but I want you to look at it again tonight Mark chapter 4 and verse 10. he says it this way Mark chapter 4 verse 10. and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve ask him of him the parable because he had just given a parable when he was alone with his disciples they asked him about the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables now notice the way he's saying it now is that is that there will be ones who catch the mystery the secret there will be ones who are called to catch the father's hidden Mystery of it and there will be ones that are called just to take the parable and see the parable and I don't know how all that fits as far as who's in what category I'm not I'm not allowed to put people in categories but there's a truth laying here that the mystery the secret he says it's given to the elect to know the secret the mystery singular mystery there and so he he says it that way in verse 10 um excuse me verse chapter 4 and verse 10. and so he says it's unto you it's given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them Father bless the study in the word tonight and we're thankful that you're a good God we're thankful what you're doing in our lives God you have just done so much and father you continue to do things and tonight we lift our voices in Praise on this Wednesday night we give you glory we give you praise we give you honor you are the mighty conqueror Lord you are you're a bigger God than any trouble that we would have you're bigger than any problem you're bigger than any mountain Lord and you're bigger than any fear that we we would have we just lay those things before you because you said cast our cares and our worries upon you for you careth for us Lord Minister through the word of God by your Holy Ghost tonight we pray as we commit the service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord God bless you may be seated tonight God bless you each one so I want to speak tonight a little bit on the father trying to reveal his hidden secret the father trying to reveal his hidden secret and it's the mystery of the Kingdom that's given to the elect it's the singular Mysteries I'm going to pull out a few words here that I'll be speaking on but he says it's given to you not all the mystery now we would think the mystery's plural in other words there's Mysteries of the kingdom of God there's principles of the kingdom of God and uh and we know that Jesus had many things to say about the kingdom children and how they live uh examples are when he when he brought The Parables and The Parables expressed revelation of the last days The Parables expressed how to live in The Parables has written something but it has to do sometimes of how the children live and then you have the Sermon on the Mount which to me is preaching to the people principles of the Kingdom how the children of the Kingdom live you know what he talks about in sermons on the mount turn in the other cheek you know someone hits you turn the other cheek to them if if uh if it talks about lust and he talks about loving your enemies and he says be there for perfect as your father's Heaven is perfect be the chill the children of the Kingdom so in all of those things there's numerous mysteries about how the kingdom children live and how they the principles they live by and they're opposite of the what the world teaches you how many you know that Kingdom principles in finances in living in marriage every subject will be different than the wisdom of the world and so we cannot take our cues from the wisdom of the world but Kingdom children how many Raise Your Hands Say I'm a kingdom child of God and I'm interested in the things of the Kingdom so so we live different and Jesus taught us we live different so I want you to know this does it's not that we don't have Mysteries plural and principles plural of the kingdom of God but when he says it's given unto you no he says it's given to you know the singular the mystery so all of those things of living the principles of the Kingdom actually come back to one mystery that God is trying to get to you that's why to me the gospel is not complicated that's why the message is not complicated to me because when people become overwhelmed she said I got to do this and I got to do that and I got to do this and they they make it all this overwhelming thing I want to tell you tonight the father is actually trying to only get one main thing to you the father has been trying to get one secret one mystery to you and when that comes to you when the father gets it to you then you have something that just opens it all up and now the kingdom you're living in the kingdom and the kingdom principles and the Mysteries everything begins to open from there but if we go backwards and try to live just Kingdom principles and we block the father from getting the one main secret that we need the one mystery that we need then we're missing something huge because it's really one I know this is going to be strange to say this but there's because we we think God has so many things to show us and he has so many preachers and brother brother Paul has so many preachers coming in and there's so much that God wants us to know that's true but I want to tell you tonight God actually is trying to get you one main mystery and it's given for you to know it does that just help you settle down a little bit and feel more peaceful but he he's but he's trying to get a hidden Mystery to you and uh so uh there's multiple teachings and the message that God sent in the last days has multiple things of how a Believer lives never has there been a message to our generation that's so specific and there's so much of it there and yet here it's worded he's it's given to you to know the mystery singular of the Kingdom so really there's one main secret he's trying to get to you he's trying to bring the thoughts of it behind the mighty acts of God he's trying to bring the thought of God to you he's trying to bring his thoughts and brothers through was on that whether Stephen Sunday and what a wonderful message we had what a a thing that caused us to deep to think more deeply than we should because he mentioned one statement this is the way he said it he said the thought the thought is the father of the word he said the attribute and I just I went back and listened to just the part I had written it on my notes but this is the way brother Stephen said it the attribute of God that was in God before the foundation of the attribute you an attribute give rise to a thought the thought is the father of the word then it's a word so it's attribute it's thought it's word the thought is the father of the word we look in the scripture and say the Father the father and we get in our minds you know some some visible thing but Jesus says Jesus says you can't see the father so don't get in this thing father and then Solomon come up here it's a father and son and two separate persons you can't look at it that way I love it when he says that the Revelation because the thought is the father of the word Jesus said no man has seen the father but the son expresses them and the son is the word so the son expresses the father in every generation the son is the word expressed Jesus Christ and the father is the thought of the word and so he says the attribute gives ride rise to a thought thank you brother Stephen I know you're listening tonight God bless you the attribute gives right the rise to the thought the thought is the father of the word then it's a word the spoken word then becomes manifested and the manifestation is the image of the heavenly powerful and I like how he said it it loses nothing in the process glory be to God from the attribute to it passes down to it gets to the manifestated manifested thought to the the expressing the image of the Heavenly nothing is lost in the process and when it manifests in you and I brothers and sisters when it comes out in you and I it's the original thought and the original attribute that God said that you would be it loses nothing in the process now everything man creates it loses in the process it's hybrid can you say Amen but God's original thought of you you are in the mind of God in the process of thought can you say amen and then it's word can you say amen and then it's manifested and then it's bearing the image of the Heavenly it never loses its effect and never loses anything from it I say praise the Lord but tonight I wanted to slow down a bit and break things uh just a little bit more simple if I can and I I kept wanting to emphasize this quote after the last two or three services and I read it in one but I didn't put it up so hopefully they have it tonight I keep wanting to emphasize this powerful quote here saying the same truth that Jesus just said as I read to you but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride he's saying the same thing that Jesus said it's given to you to know the mystery but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery not the Mysteries not all the Mysteries but the one mystery this is what Satan fights against hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand and then he goes into why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you so it even goes back to our hunger and remember I've been preaching we try to replace with a hunger for God we try to replace it with everything else but there's one thing God's trying to bring to you and actually fills the hunger that you're looking for why do you hunger why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you isn't it good to know tonight that even in our weakness God's not going to give up to bring his secret to the bride members he's going to keep trying and keep trying and keep trying and keep trying that's his agenda that's his that's the will for this hour he he says what the but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job oh nobody ever does that you let your wife you let your husband you let your children and this is a quote many of you know some may not know it but look at look at all the things you got the father trying to bring something to you and then you got this world we live in and we get distracted and that's the thing that holds up the process of God trying to get this hidden secret to you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children what's that saying to us there is nothing nothing more important than God in our lives can I get an amen there's no money there's no possession there's no house there's no new car there's nothing more important than God being the foundation of our lives and letting God bring this hidden secret to you people can go their whole lives and God's trying and trying but they they but they keep pushing God off or they keep being distracted they won't settle down long enough for God to get the main thing that he needs to get to them they won't settle down and but I'll tell you I was thinking about today I was telling brother Brandon in the office God has his time for you and if it's within a year of coming to truth if it's the very night you come to truth or if it's 20 years later if you're one of God's Sons and Daughters he's going to bring it to you he's going to keep trying that's why we can't have unrealistic expectations of people because everybody has a different time that they come that's why I said a few Sundays ago is that you got people realizing that they have don't have the new birth some people until 20 years later after being in this message being raised in this message and they're discovering wow I'm lacking the most important thing in my life but you know what praise the Lord praise the Lord and you can preach the greatest sermons but I can tell you that heart isn't coming to repentance until God leads them to repentance you can hear the best preaching in the world but if your heart isn't repented and broken and God doesn't move on you that you're sitting there and it's like water off a deck's back you're not getting what you need to get it's not the father getting that hidden secret to you it's all religion it's all put on it's all being forced how many people are leaving this message because this whole message is being forced to do something listen friends the father's trying to get his hidden secret to you that's what needs to happen but people can go for 10 years 20 years 30 years and all of a sudden bang something happens in their lives that's why you have to be patient with people pastors have to be more patient than anybody because I'm looking for everybody to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost in one service I would love it but but I don't orchestrate this it's whether the father leads you to repentance see but you can open your heart more can you say Amen but the Bible says it's God that leads you to repentance you don't even have anything to do with that he has to break that heart and listen if you go and buck up against it for years God's got your number God's got your number God loves you enough and whatever time he moves on you he will use anything that he needs to use to get a hold of your heart and it's amazing what God uses sometimes to bring a person to True repentance but your children and their loved ones you're praying for you keep praying because they have their season they have their season you like most so many things get it out of you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world all this is distractions and bucking up against or pushing away from the father trying to get this hidden secret to you and you let somebody somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart I love that friends you this is only a Believer now some a Believer that's called to this way down in your heart are you here tonight you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you I see God's love I see God's love there it's the father trying he doesn't give up we give up it's the father trying to bring this hidden secret to you so he's got one main thing he's trying to get to us and there's two things I see in this quote Satan is fighting against this more than anything else this is the Revelation he can't stand this is what he fights against and the second thing I see in that quote is we let him Satan distract us from it even in the cares of life we let it be stopped of the father trying to get this secret to us trying to get this secret to us and you think you think what's in the news uh is is the main event that's not the main event I'm preaching the main event to you tonight it's the father trying to get this mystery to you the news is not the main event you think that the economy oh what are we going to do and you get worried about the economy and the housing market and all that and and I know it's crazy someone called me today about it it's I don't even understand any of that I understand how the interest rates are up so high and there's houses selling for 30 40 000 more uh with four or five offers I don't understand any of that I'm not worried tonight about the economy can you say man I I'm worried about me being in tune with God more than the economy can you say man one fellow I was reading last week said I'm not worried about the world's economy I've got a hairline that's in recession I've got a belly that's in inflation and I'm in depression so I'm not worried about the world's economy I'm worried about me I'm concerned about me can you say amen I I don't want to be a distraction to what the Lord's trying to get to me can you agree tonight how many years we go through our life and we let things distract us from the father trying to get that secret to us trying to get something to us we're we're the culprit we're the one that stops it up but if I could just be released of all my cares and take my worries to the Cross can you say amen I see God I'm going to let you take care of that I'm going to work I'm going to try to plan my finances but I'm gonna let you take everything I'm not going to be worried about the cares of life as he said to cast your worries and cares upon Him He gave you permission to take your worries about this life and pray and cast it on him and he's going to work it out why because he has another Main Event the economy your finances is not the main event it's like that scripture that says money answereth all things you know what that means money it's in Proverbs money answer it means the end of every conversation is money that's the world we live in is the worry of money the worry of the economy the money answers all things and I'm here to tell you it doesn't answer all things it's not the main event it's not the most important thing in your life if you didn't have a dime and God was getting this secret to you then you'd be happy in the Lord can somebody say praise the Lord if you didn't have a house to live in if you didn't have a dime tonight if the father was getting that secret through to you and you were filled with the spirit of God living close to him you're a millionaire can you say amen that's the main event that's the main thing in our lives you let so many things get it out of you your job the money your wife your pastor you let so many things why because you're letting that be the main event the main event is the father trying to get a secret to you oh I'm glad he's trying to get it to me praise the Lord I'm glad the Lord won't give up on me when I give up on him amen so now I'm just going to take this tonight from a different approach in in relation to the father trying to get the secret to you and I'm interested just a bit of teaching here but I want you to really pay attention and hopefully it'll tie in for a Sunday and the last few services but I still had this leftover from a few Sundays ago and I want to take it from a different approach I want you to go to Exodus 19. and exodus 19 of course is the scripture after the the children of Israel had come out of Egypt and uh they had come across the desert and they had went through the different things and God performed miracles for them and many things happened then all of a sudden then when all that was uh kind of come to an end then there's there was an event here that uh in the process of the children of Israel several years down the road there's a process with the children of Israel that was something very huge that was going to happen now and I'll just tell you what it is Exodus 19 is when God begins the process of bringing coming descending upon a mountain and descending to the people for the purpose of bringing his word to them now that's the first part we know he's going to bring his word to the people now he has been a god of Miracles he's been a God that's put Pharaoh's Army in the Red Sea he's been a God that's spoken through his Prophet he's been a God that's provided bread when they needed food food he's been a God that's provided water when they needed water he's been a God that's provided a place for them to live even though they come across the desert he's been a God that they know that has many mighty acts but you see now friends God will not God has an agenda he has a purpose he wants to get something to us and so now in this process he stops and he's going to bring something through Moses from the mountain and he's going to bring his word to the people but tonight I'm hoping the Lord will help me let you see what the purpose of all of it was because it's not even that he would give us all of his word to live by and you just hold on you understand that in a minute so after several years let's read in Nexus 19 break it down after several years of the process with God now he comes to this huge moment and there have been public displays of God Israel has seen firsthand many things I want to say to you they have been keeping up the lamb since Abraham he had the people have been taught to keep the lamb up that's a quote that the prophet mentions in the token he said that night when the token came the blood the lamb they had always they've been keeping up the lamb but that then the Lamb's blood had to be applied to the door that night to pass death so you realize when he says that statement they had been keeping up the land he's talking about 2 000 years of church history that they have been believing in the lamb Jesus Christ they've been keeping up the lamb but this word coming from the mountain was something something deeper than that to bring us into a mystery deeper than that than just knowing that the lamb because they were bringing the lamb they had they had missed the Lost circumcision when they were in Egypt so when they come under uh in the land and come into Joshua then they brought back circumcision but tonight I want you to notice this event and here's let's just read it in the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came they Into the Wilderness of Sinai Mount Sinai for they were departed from referendum and were come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there Israel camped before the mount so they're camping right beside Mount Sinai and there's a purpose in that because God's going to do a different event now okay and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel so God in the mountain tells Moses to tell the children children of Israel this principle God is going to speak to his people through a prophet don't you dare try to train to change that process he didn't change it in Jesus Christ Jesus was the ultimate prophet he was the god prophet but he said I'm going to speak and so here's what he said to the people verse 4 ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians so that's a message when itself and there's some brothers more capable than me than bringing that whole thing of looking back and Miriam granber than tambourine when you see dead Egyptians floating in the water an entire Army that they were afraid and running from and you're looking no wonder Miriam grabbed the tambourine because you look back and see all the things that your habits all the things that are there floating in the Dead Sea dead can you say amen I tell you God knows how to deal with your enemy God knows how to deal with your habits what a rejoicing that was to look back and grab the tambourine and Shout a little bit because they can look and see that's all finished now and it's done oh my that's wonderful but he that's the first thing he says you have seen what I did under the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto who myself so now we're starting to get a picture of the mystery we're starting to get a picture of the purpose and all this God calling a prophet God bringing them out of Egypt which you know is the type of the world type of denominations the call in Revelations 19 I believe it is to come out of her my people to come out of church systems to the genuine atonement to the the truth to the full truth instead of limited Truth by denominations I pray every person would pray about that because there's a calling to come out to come out to full truth can you say Amen in the last days especially so so now you see then uh is I brought you but but what's the watch the mystery now I brought you unto myself there's a reason that God got rid of Israel's enemy there's a reason that God delivers you there's a reason that you take he takes you under his wings how many can say when you come to the Lord he just took me under his wings of protection I've been protected from things that I didn't even know I needed protection from but in the work God is watching over his people how many is under his wings tonight he's letting the people know it's been me and all this I destroyed Pharaoh's Army I destroyed your enemy and now you're under my wings and all of it had a reason to bring you to myself now therefore if you obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people what is this mystery it's about them it's about who they are I'm setting you apart you're not like the world you're a peculiar people Paul picks it up in the in the New Testament he says you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation A peculiar people I'm calling you listen there's there's nothing here in this mystery there's nothing here about God doing the Miracles and God displaying himself and God showing to the world his mightiness this is getting closer to what God does it for and that's to draw you into the third Bowl draw you unto himself can you say Amen draw you into being a peculiar treasure For Me Above All people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so I'm going to come back to that in a minute okay but Moses came and let me just skip yeah Moses came and called for the Elders of people laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded and all the people answered together and said all the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people and the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud the the Lord said unto Moses I'm coming to you in a thick Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever and Moses told the words unto the people moving on you're still with me the and the Lord said unto Moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day now I want you to notice this I've been preaching on the third the three being the mystery I've been preaching on uh Elijah having three parts okay the the first part is Mount Carmel the second part was the juniper tree but the third part is when the really mystery was revealed in the third part and that was in the cave when he says I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the wind but I'm in a still small voice he called them to the mountain in the third month and on the third day and he begins to do this the Lord will for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai on the third day I will descend upon the mountain skip the verse 15. and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives there's a third day again they come it'll come to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and it came to pass excuse me it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and a voice of the trumpet exceeding loud said that all the people that was in the camp trembled and the Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mount and Mount Sinai was all together a smoke because the Lord had descended the Lord descended upon that mountain in Fire and the smoke there of ascendants the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mount Quake greatly and when the voice of the trumpet styled along and the wax louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a what a voice now I I want to simplify this even for the children would be listening I want to I want to take out of this I want to draw out of this some elements simple elements of this uh ascending from God for the purpose of drawing the people to himself not that they're caught up in a miracle not that they're caught up in the Supernatural but now for the purpose of bringing his word to the people for the purpose of drawing and making them priests he knows in Revelations 5. they begin to worship when the book was opened when the lamb took the book he says thou has made us Kings and Priests so what's this mystery about this mystery is not about what God displays this is not about the public show of God this is what he's making the people into this is what this is an identity can you say Amen this is revealing the mystery of Who You Are and that's the most important thing to God that's why the father's trying to get this secret to you because you can dwell in all the supernatural things of God and still miss the reason why he sent the message you could be caught up in the cloud because you got a cloud here you got a cloud at the end time you could be caught up just with the cloud and that's not sure enough that's not an anchor enough that's not the full mystery of this can you say Amen you can stand oh I'm amazed at the cloud and you keep believing and looking at the cloud and all the while God's trying to draw his people near the Mountaineer and bring his word to the people and draw them to himself so that they can come into a kingdom of priests somebody say praise the Lord so there's elements in these this visitation that I want you to look at there's a lot of elements but I'm going to list some and then I'm going to go to our scripture for the end time and you'll see the same elements okay number one I should have put them on a slide but I'll just say them number one in this visitation of God this unique special visitation God is descending how many knows God descended there's a cloud something is thundering out and thunder in the Bible means something's being spoken so when he's thundering out God is saying something now the people hear the thunder and they see the shaking of the mountain but that's because God is saying some to his Prophet Prophet Moses when there's Thunder God's saying something and I tell you he's saying many things to Moses because he comes out of there with not only to the Ten Commandments he comes out of there with all kinds of things of how the people should live we're talking details we're talking everything that the law would give the people how to live how to live as the people of God it was so detailed right down to where the the clothes that you wear the interwoofing of certain clothes the distinction and the genders oh it was a detailed message it talked about what women should wear what men should wear it talked about how fast you drive on the highway the speed limit it talked about this giving back when you come through the border and all of a sudden you realize you've got something to take it back to the border and confess to you I mean it taught us so many things how a Christian should live you say man so now there's things thundering out in the mountain thundering out so we got God descending we've got a cloud we've got something thundering out God's saying something we've and then there's a prophet there's a prophet's voice there and and he's he's he's he's he's taken what God said unto him and he's going to bring it to the people he'd be God's voice to bring it to the people and as we said Sunday he'll he'll decode it he'll decode God if there's any fuzziness how to live a prophet will decode it so you got that you have multiple Thunders blasting out right close together it goes from okay it goes It goes from thundering and voices to one voice and one mystery one thing the father was trying to get to the people all right so here hold that right there that's the elements that happen in Exodus 19. okay now before we go to Revelations 10 and see the same elements I want you to notice something here in Hosea 6 and verse 2. okay in the middle of the Bible Hosea 6 and verse 2 of Prophecy can you guys get it after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now that's a prophecy for Israel but it's a double prophecy for the Bride of Jesus Christ after two days now a day with the Lord is a thousand years so this is the prophecy that says after two days after two thousand years when the third day come when we enter into the third day that's when I'll send a Revival that's when I'll raise you up that's when you shall live in his sight it gives us the time that God is going to breathe forth and bring forth his word to the people because for 2000 years now for the two days we are bound by Creeds and dogmas and all kinds of things but in the third day I'll revive you again I'll visit you again I'll descend into the generation so I wanted you to catch that because we had the third month in Exodus 19 we have the third day and here he prophesies it when he will come and do this great work again in the third day after 2000 years so look at us now in 2023 2000 years of church history it was during this time slot when God would have another not just another visitation like Exodus 19 but actually the ultimate Ascension excuse me descending of God okay now we'll read it I want everybody even the teenagers to read it Revelations 10. the elements that I brought you listen for them Revelations 10 our day and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud so you have a descending of the Lord say is that the Lord that means to the Lord what's the mighty Angel and he has a a rainbow it was about his head his face was actually where the sun and his feet is supposed to fire the description there is Christ the description he's the when you have a rainbow you have a covenant angel so it's not just another one of the Angels this is Christ The Mighty angel what's he doing he's descending at the end time okay so you have him descending the Lord descending you got the cloud there verse two and he had in his hand a little book open and it said set his foot his right foot upon the sea his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now yeah just like Exodus 19 you have thunders particularly seven Thunders so what does that mean God's going to say God's saying something God's saying something God descending there's a cloud and God's thundering out and he's saying something and when the seventh utters had uttered their voices I was about to write John was about to write him because if there's not something being said then he has nothing to write so this isn't this is a symbolism this is a this is the vision of the end time okay and the symbolism says Thunders but if it had just been Thunders he's hearing him my something's thundering out there no something's being said because John's saying get my note get my notepad and he starts to write this down back back in that time when he's on the island Patmos getting this Vision he starts to write because something's being said Mysteries are being said and the angel stuff said don't write it now it's not time for it right now but there is a time for it there is a time he's going to blast them forth he's going to have truly seven thunders of the voices of those Thunders uttering out right next to each other the right close to each other bang bang bang bang bang and there's going to be voices and there's going to be truths that come because the the the seven Thunders the seven Thunders are the Mysteries behind the Seven Seals the book had Seven Seals but when he Thunders it he's saying it can you say amen he sang the Mysteries behind the seals he's saying something right close together bang bang bang seven close together blessed be his name that's exactly how he does it in the end time so let's keep reading he says and they swear by him excuse me where am I at uh yeah verse four and when the seven Thunders that other voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice saying seal up those things that are seven Thunders utter and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven so I'm going to skip down now to verse six well we read them also we'll read verse six and I swear by him that liveth forever who created heaven and the things that they're in our and the Earth and things that there and are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and that's where the Prophet mentions no more delay in other words I'll come I'll reach a point where I will not hold this back anymore after 2000 years I'm gonna get this secret to my people somebody say praise the Lord the father trying to get his secret to the people I'm not going to hold this back anymore time no longer means no more delay that's it but you asked the question after he sealed it up and said don't write about it back in verse 4. you ask the question well when when one scripture and we read in Hosea says after two days after after those two days in the third day I'll start to do this I'll revive you I'll bring something to you this gives the time zone perfectly the time when he says when we say win verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound stop right there you've got you've got the Lord descending you've got a cloud can you say man you've got thundering out of voices Thunders and voices to the Thunders that's what it says you've got a voice of a seventh angel in those days that's going to utter what's being said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets which tells me that he wrote this mystery in a lot of the prophets and what they were talking about in the Bible he's writing this because they were declaring it in mystery form can you say amen I like what brother Stephens true says it's it's not really a mystery when God when God reviews it reveals it can you say Amen when it's time when the father trying to get it to you he'll bring it to you but you see that he declared it to all his servants the prophets but there's a time through the seventh angel he's going to begin blasting it for us and when he shall begin to sound did anybody notice that the same wording as in Luke that we read at the beginning that he says this will be hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed to babes it's given to you to know singular the mystery isn't it amazing that you have seven Thunders you have voices with the Thunders you have many things being said but it Narrows down to one mystery Why didn't it say when the seventh angel speaks when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of God should be finished and really they are but you see this is deeper than just a Doctrine or mystery being settled or the loose sins being tied together because Mysteries is the godhead and serpent seed and all the things that we got lost through the church and now God puts it together by the seventh angel can you say Amen do you think that brother Branham come up with it himself no let me make it clear God was going to use his seventh angel to tie the loose ends together he didn't have anything of himself and he said he studied things from other men's things he studied those things because and just because he studied him doesn't mean that he made them an authority to it God's the authority to it but he studied him because why he's called to tie the loose ends together now either he's the seventh angel or he's not the seventh angel but if he's the seventh angel then he's called to tithe together all the loose sins and the mysteries of God shall be finished the mysteries of God the the serpency what happened in the garden God all of it uh predestination it's got to be settled can you say Amen but even with all of that it's not just fixing Doctrine in the end time that God's trying to do and I'm gonna make a Rapture because I've come to all the Mysteries being revealed to me and I know them and so I'm going to take a Rapture I'm here to tell you that it all sums up all those voices all those things being said and blasted out comes to something more secret and that's a mystery being revealed to individuals is that okay because when you have a blasting forth when you have seven Thunders uttering and it's public and it's on tape and it goes out praise the Lord but when he says the third poll there's a part of it that's not going to be a public show so there's a voice within the voice there's a mystery within it that has only his bride members will catch out of that there's there's a there's a main event there's a main thing to happen just because it now is can you find it out can you find it by just everywhere no no it comes through the seventh angel but there's no guarantee that you have that personal walk with God and that you have that mystery revealed to you personally there's no guarantee of that just because you're in a message Church just because you read the books I think we should approach this so prayerfully when we feed on this word that we're saying God boy that's good I enjoying that but through these Revelations you're opening up to me there's one big Revelation that I'm looking for and that's who I am that's who I am because a lot of people have studied this message the wrong way is to become smarter than everybody else smarter than any other Church and their pride gets lifted up can you say amen I know more you can Peg it Peg it Peg it Peg I know this I know that yes and you can take it to scripture and tie you in Notch with the scripture and the quotes of the message praise the Lord that's wonderful but let me tell you there's a deeper mystery that needs to come to every bride member every bride member has to come to something deeper than that that's what I'm preaching on tonight the father is trying to reveal this hidden secret to you so under all of this if we'll sit quietly that's why I said a couple weeks ago and I didn't mean it to put anybody down but I know I have some people even in my own assembly hasn't even read the seal book hasn't even listened to it so this isn't a quota to reach but if I'm preaching to you that there was something blasted forth through the seventh angel you ought to take some time and sit quietly with your Bible and say Lord this is how you did it it's got a cloud this visitation has a cloud with it this has a voice with it it has a prophet with it the same as Exodus 19. you must have wanted me to hear something so my ears are wide open and I'm not going to go to a seminary to get this I'm not going to find this in the Seminary the Bible told us the channel that it would come through this is de-christianize anybody I would never do that someone received Christ as their savior praise be to God whoever they are I would never put them in Hell or anything like that that's crazy the prophet never did that but when Israel came to Mount Sinai God had something further to bring them can you say amen and after 2 000 years of church history and our Bible's even coming back to you God had something further to open in these Bibles to his people and it's the father trying to get his hidden secret to his people somebody say praise the Lord it's the father trying to heal so so so if you can go back to Exodus 19 we'll we'll say a few closing comments here tonight because this is all I want you to catch okay the importance of God the Father trying to get the father trying to get this hidden secret to you the channel he uses Exodus 19 anybody wants to argue with the same pattern the same principle the same Lord descending in a cloud using a voice to do it thundering out something oh my friends God we don't have any right to change God's nature of doing something right so when he did it in Moses day the same nature he does it in today shouldn't this make us just hunger for all I know when I receive the holy ghost that my greatest evidence that I knew is this an incredible hunger for the word of God I just I couldn't get enough of it and actually it's it's my only even though my life has become busy it's my only joy and my Hunger is still there I want to know as I said Sunday he reads those little scriptures and Mike and all these prophets that in my early years as a Christian seems oh my goodness that's so confusing I said I I want to know I know what he's saying if it takes me weeks I'm going to keep reading it until the Lord shows me there's something in here for me this wasn't meant for the world this is meant for believers to catch the mystery of it can you say man now he offers salvation to anyone who would accept it I believe that that's what he said he's not willing that any should pair us but Jesus said it's given to you it's given to some to just keep The Parables it's given to some to just talk about Jesus yeah 33 years on the face of the Earth praise the Lord Christ is being preached why would we criticize when Christ is being preached don't criticize those people Christ if they only want to talk about the Christ from 2000 years old praise the Lord but there's some called to just The Parables there's some called to just the history but Jesus says there's a group that's called to catch the mystery and I just believe I'm one of them and so when I listen I'm going to listen closely when I turn that tape on when I turn that on my phone when I get that table on my app and I turn that on I'm all ears can you say Amen not to a man not to a man but a voice within the voice what do you want to tell me Lord not just how to live but show me who I am can you say Amen so I hope you see the parallel tonight I hope you see God Did It Again God descending again in this generation 1963 can you say Amen but if you think it only happened in 1960 here you know that's when you begin thundering these out that's when he began this revival who are way down the road now but I really believe we should be coming into the third part we shouldn't be lagging behind and we shouldn't be going back we shouldn't be going back to Pentecostal message there's no rapturing faith back there are you listening to go back just to Azusa Street and we're not even going back just to the Pentecost 2000 years the original uh on the day of Pentecost we're only stopping there for a minute to get that Faith but we're going back into the very thoughts of God before the foundation of the world I'm not stopping just at the damn Pentecost we're going all the way back to what God thought of us before the foundation of the world our journey friend is this back to the mind of God it's not to go back to Azusa Street there's no rapturing faith there but it's to move into where these Thunders thundering out is taking us can you say Amen a little bit of teaching tonight a little bit of treaching actually preaching and teaching together so back to Exodus 19 and verse 4 you have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself friends if I pray God can show it to you it's our God descending and saying my purpose and descending and bringing my word to you through my Prophet Moses is so that I can bring you to myself I'm bringing you to myself I don't want to be this distant God I'm descending to come near you and now I need you to come near me now therefore if you obey my voice oh that's what it is are you going to be his voice not just the voice of man not the voice of man but he said my voice are you going to be in my voice indeed and keep my Covenant if you do that ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation I said at the beginning in The Sermon on the Mount all those things teach in the Kingdom principles and the kingdom way to the Act and the kingdom how a Christian how the how the kingdom people act there's there's a kingdom marriage there's a kingdom uh a teenager there's a way a teenager lives in the kingdom of God so it's all the things of the kingdom and all that is great but he wants to make you a kingdom of priest yourself it's about identity it's about you it's about what he draws you inside of himself and shows you yourself and and this is what the mystery is is to make unto you a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which I spake unto the children of Israel so it's it's about the mystery is about identity the mystery is about drawing inside close to the Lord until that voice as you obey it and you stay close to it it draws you into positioning it draws you into this peculiar treasure unto him above all people it draws you into relationship with him it draws you into a kingdom of priest and remember later on in the law they had a priesthood they would they're the only ones when they come they're the only ones that come in the ark but this is foretelling what's going to come after the seals he have made us Kings and Priests he's given his mystery right here and yet later in the law they develop a whole priesthood only the priest could come in the Tabernacle so all that had to happen because it wasn't time yet for the for the true atonement so now you have preachers and ministers and all these you know government set up and rules set up for the people and dietary laws to live by because why you got to go another how many years before you get to the true atonement you know it's like the Law's got to keep these people in line the Law's got to keep their lust in mind and can you say Amen but there's something further coming he says it's it's a kingdom that I'm building a kingdom of priests where it's not just going to be a certain group of the Levites but it's going to grow into them recognizing and said the whole Kingdom of my people will be a kingdom of priests it's not going to be a select group but every bride member would be a kingdom of priests that's the mystery that's that's what he's trying to get bring us into that's the father what he's trying to get to you is that listen your identity is not in this world your identity brothers and sisters is not even what your father and mother told you that you were your identity is not in your past sins that was not your final say of who you are your identity does is not rooted in Psychology or what mental things can tell you or what the devil tells you can you say amount what you believe in yourself it's even deeper than your personality that God gave you it's deeper can you say there's a mystery of you being in this Kingdom a part of his kingdom can you say Matt and that attribute as brother Stephen said they actually what's the attributes of God it's you you're the attribute of God here I am being expressed tonight and you stumble over my flesh and I Stumble over your flesh but deep inside it's the attribute beginning to manifest more and more I'm a Son of God I was built for this I love this word I can worship can you say Matt I have no problem dressing the way the word says to because I'm in this Kingdom I'm a part I I am his kingdom so his kingdom principles are important to me because I am a priest unto God that's why I can witness that's why I can talk to people confidently not because I got a bunch of head knowledge but I that's why the other day and I can only tell my testimonies because I wasn't met too many other people this week I've been praying for other people but I grabbed what I grabbed the hand of Udi's mom who was weeping Udi's the one we've been praying that her sister gets the papers when was it on a Thursday she was at the house cleaning uh one of our airbnbs and I just grabbed her hand and her daughter's hand I said we're going to pray right now we prayed God opened the doors for their daughters to get here two days later she calls my wife and there she says I'm so crazy my mind they were excited I can't even go clean your houses today we're going crazy rejoicing because she got the papers today and she's coming this week I feel confident that I'm a life Giver I'm not here to be the image of some person of the world I'm here to be a kingdom priest for God I carry the name of Jesus Christ within me I know how to bombard heaven for needs I know who I am can you say amen that's the way he wants his people to live all that we would quit trying to measure ourselves by somebody on social media or somebody else in the church or some other more pretty person than you oh that we would stop that and look in the word and say God you have made me who I am in this Kingdom for a purpose who am I in the word of God you've made me a peculiar us a peculiar people unto you I'm not here to be a statistic I'm not here to manifest something else I'm not here to live like everybody else lives but I'm here to be a kingdom priests can you say Amen it's a pretty important position because you have access because when he broke the veil at Calvary and the veil was tore that means that that means that every child of God can come and approach God not just the Levites we have preachers you know we have a we have preachers and we have governments in the church we have trustees and all that but you know what that's just to keep things running here there's the church the church is so much deeper than positions and and we have the musicians and that's all important but listen the real calling is that we are a kingdom of priests we represent we hold the name of God we're different we're peculiar we're different on the inside we're different on the outside we don't do it to be proud we do it because Scott has made us different and he's drawn us unto himself you talk about the seals in 1963 and all the message and I'm preaching to you tonight I'm bringing it to one main purpose that God's trying to achieve out of all that message it's the father trying to get this secret to you but you let so many things get out of you but the father is going to keep trying to get this mystery to you I love him don't you praise the Lord let's finish a few of these things on Sunday let's stand together tonight we'll finish the rest of this I just want you to catch Exodus 19 tonight the parallel to the revelations 10. and see all those things in there the third month the third day the third mystery third poll God does many things many many things and then he did his mightiest thing in the third poll which is not a public show it's between you and God Alone father trying to get this mystery to you something that's happened that everybody said what's going on what's going on what's going on well God's doing a mighty thing but it's a secret thing Isaiah said who hath despised the day of small things who hath despised the day of small things when God secretly does a secret work when you get alone with him and when you're in communion with him he'll do things in you and I'll quote from God because I have some things in here as as then the message comes we'll bring it on Sunday before he would speak those seals his first message is God hiding in simplicity you know what the Lord is saying through that you know what the Lord's trying to tell us this whole thing that's going to happen it may blast forth on tapes but be careful that you don't interpret it be careful you don't over spiritualize it be careful you don't make it something that it's not because he will hide himself in these things and to find him it's not because you're going to a message convention it's because you have settled down into the word to hear his voice personally yourself when that happens in your rank ten thousand Fall by your left twenty thousand by your right it won't come nigh unto you because when all passes away you're connected to the voice of the Lord what can I say what more can I say you see why I encourage you to you personally even if your husband doesn't it you personally get in this word get in this message feed on it I'm emphasizing I've emphasized it for 35 years but I'm emphasizing it more and more the end result the Practical advice that I give you at the end of all these is to try to show you the value of what God has sent us in the last days but if you're feeding on all kinds of other things on your phone your phone will bring your worst Temptation in this time right now your worst distraction lay down your phones get your Bible feed on this message and listen to the voice of God because the father's trying to get this head mystery to you that's trying to get it Heavenly Father I'm so thankful Lord that you have given me a place you know Lord how much I tell you that I don't know why you picked me to do this quite often I say it to you Lord I still don't understand why you you put me in this place or I'd rather come and be the loudest amenor and hear another brother preaching it Lord I want to stay faithful to you and I want to speak it just as honestly and encourage the people just as much as I can you have descended to our generation you have come down Among Us Lord you are revealing yourself and making yourself known help us not to be blinded by any other thing Lord open our eyes that we can see you father forgive us when we are distracted that quote that was read tonight that you let so many things get it out of you forgive us Lord help us to not have any other priority of our life that would be more important than our relationship and our fellowship with you [Music] we don't want to be in later sins we want to be a kingdom of priest unto you Lord show us who we are show us that we're A peculiar people show us that we're a holy nation unto yourself or you sent this message to draw your people close to you so you can speak to them said father whatever comes out of that Miracles and answering prayer and being a vessel used of you will give you glory for it but Lord we must stay close to you and your voice so that this world can see the final manifestation of Christ hidden in a people hidden in a people let them see Jesus in us I pray Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen everybody said amen we're seeing a couple courses and
