I just want to testify this morning. We had the results from our PET scan came back and uh for the most part it's completely clean scan. We just want to thank the Lord for his healing power and um they're going to do a little test on one area, but we're just believing that it's uh the doctor said it's probably just scar tissue from the healing that we've had. So, we're just really pleased and we're pressing on and asking the Lord to just do a finished work in our bodies. We were practicing yesterday for uh singing at the fairgrounds uh tomorrow night and we were doing this song and I just I just love this song and I love the words. So just listen to the words [Music] &gt;&gt; at my door is standing. Patiently draw we near entrance within he [Music] who is the voice I hear and Sweetly the toes are falling. [Music] Open the door for me. Thou will he my calling. I will abide with thee. [Music] Lonely without he is standing. [Music] Lonely within my while I am still delayed. [Music] Will he not pass me by? [Music] And sweetly the tones are falling. [Music] Open the door for me. If thou will heed my calling, [Music] I will abide with thee and I will I will abide [Music] with thee. [Music] [Applause] We're going to read from Joshua chapter 6, two or three places, but we want to start there this morning. And you know what? God is good. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God is good all the time. And I pray my heart's desire this morning is that he would visit us. Our Lord is the special one among us. I pray he would visit us, but I pray my gift would be a help to all of you this morning. Joshua chapter 6 and verse 10. I'm just going to pull out. I won't read the whole chapter, of course, but Joshua chapter 6 and verse 10. And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, "Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then shall ye shout." Uh, if you know your Bible, we're in the setting of the of Jericho. And um, I'll just add in this chapter 6 and verse one. Now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel. None went out and none came in. So they had already surrounded the city. And the Lord said unto Joshua, "See, I have given into thine hand Jericho and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor." God had already said, "I have already given you Jericho." Now, shouldn't that charge the saints of God to know he's already given it to us? &gt;&gt; So if he's already given it to them, then let's go do it. Let's go do it. But now God tests the people because he's going to do the battle plan his own way, not our way, not their way, but he's going to do the battle plan. And we have to be submissive and obedient to the battle plan. And the battle plan was stranged because said he said in verse 10, he said, "You shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then shall you shout." And for six days they had to shut their mouths until God said to shout. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, shout for the Lord hath given you the city. Verse 20. So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets. And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. I love to read about victories &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Believers are all about victories. &gt;&gt; I know the devil likes to make your life a life of defeat, but if you're a believer, it's a life of victories. Praise the Lord. Let's read in Psalms 149 if you would. And we'll just add this in uh just from a couple Sundays ago that we were speaking on. This will be uh just a part two of that one. Psalms 149. And we we won't read the whole chapter. Verse 6. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hand. Heavenly Father, bless your word today as we minister. We give our gift to you and we give these precious lives who are listening in and also here. We give them back to you. You are their uh you are their savior. You are their Lord. You are their shepherd. Lord, you know them more than any any man knows them. In fact, Lord, you know them better than they know themselves. And you know what they need better than they even know themselves. So I pray dear Lord that this moment that your anointing would take over and that you would do something in our midst for the people's lives in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. Couple weeks ago I was preaching out of this Psalms 149 and it's a wonderful small chapter if you want to read it again. But when all the musicians and singers were here, we were ministering this scripture and talking about the high praises of God. And uh we were bringing to that particular service. We were bringing that worship in this has seemed to reach its highest form. And when worship has reached is how many know that worship is not just singing in church but it's our life and worship reaches its highest form. I believe in this Psalms 149 because it speaks of a people. In fact, I would say that it's prophetic because it speaks of a people with a sword in their hand and the high praises of God upon their lips. And this high praises is the only place it's mentioned in scripture, the high praises of God. And that grabbed my attention because it's if it's mentioned in one place, then we realize it must have some meaning to it. Praise is mentioned many places, but this was a people with the high praises of God upon their lips. And it is also a people that have the sword in their hand. And all of us believers should be familiar with that because we are the people that have received the sword back into our hand. It struck the prophet's hand and it also has struck the hand of the people that we have the word. The sword put blank put back in our hands. But it's not just that we have the word. It's not just that we have the restored word, but we have the high praises of God upon our lips and or or I should say we should have the high praises of God upon our lips. So when I looked up this high praises uh we realized that the first meaning of it it means to be very exuberant. It means to be very joyful. It means to be very excited. It means to be constantly bragging on God. praising God, not only in church, but you're always praising God. You're always bragging on the Lord. You're always telling about the good things that he's done, and you're you're not afraid to talk about it to somebody in the store or your boss or anybody else. If you get the opportunity, it's an exuberant excitement to praise and put on these lips, glory to Almighty God. That's the high praises of God. And it isn't just on Sunday. It isn't just every year at the camp meeting, but it should be every day of our lives. What comes out of our mouth is thanksgiving and praise for what the Lord has done. It is not lukewarm praise or passive praise. It's not laidback, well, I'm too tired to do it, but it actually the high praises of God. It actually embodies itself in a body so much that you see the expressions of clapping your hands and shouting and rejoicing and saying amen. But I'm a shy person. But this high praise kind of overrides that shyness and says I'm feeling this. I'm there's tears coming down my life. God God has redeemed me. God has saved me. Can you say amen? God has done something for me. Can you say amen? Praise the Lord. Uh I I I was looking at the slides coming across and there's one slide there from one of the preachers that says, "Soon as a man is cleansed from sin, he is clothed with praise." Soon as a man is cleansed from sin and he's really been cleansed, he becomes clothed with high praises. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's not lazy. I believe it's not something that's lukewarm or it's when you feel like it. I believe it's something that becomes high praises and it is unashamed. It is an unashamed expression in your song, in your hands, in your body. It may even make you dance every once in a while. And I'll tell you, if it made David dance before Calvary, and it made David's cup overflowing, overwhelmed before Calvary, now after Calvary, it our cup should be running over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our cup should be not not just full but running over. I thought about that the other day. I thought, you know what, in our lives, do we live a life I've got a cup, a coffee cup that says, "My cup runth over." I use it every morning, but I was looking at the other day, how many believers can say like David before Calvary, he was already saved, my cup is running over. I'll tell you friends, God has done mighty things. And this unashamed expression should be in your song. It should be in your hands. It should be in your body. Sometimes even affects our feet. It lets it all out for the Lord and has no fear to bring a vocal celebration upon its lips. &gt;&gt; And that all happens because something is causing it. Not because I'm uh forcing it this morning or I'm working it up. That happens because the revelation of Christ has struck your heart. And when revelation strikes your heart, stimulation is on its way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not working it up. When you have a true revelation, you get stimulation of revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But then I was drawn to the other meaning of high praise, and that's beyond just church. uh uh while music is often part of high praise and it is music is a part of it, worship is a part of it, our expression at church and at home in music. While music is often a part of high praise, it's not limited to it. In other words, it's not limited to being in church. High praises of God on your lips is not limited to being in church. If this is the only time you sing is in church, uh shame on you. Our high praises belong to him wherever we're at, whenever we feel to give praises to God. If this is the only time you read your Bible, then shame on you this morning because this is not a Sunday morning religion. This is every day that we bring the high praises to God. &gt;&gt; If this is the only place you ever sing a song, you say, "Brother Paul, I don't have a gift to sing." God never made qualifications. You know what the qualification is to bring praise? That's if you're breathing. Let everything that hath breath &gt;&gt; check your neighbor breathe on them. Wait, wait a minute. Don't do that. Check Check it. Check your pulse. If you're breathing, you have no excuse. That is the only qualification that makes you a worshshiper. Let everything that have breath praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just a little different. You know, I'm just a little different. Yeah, you are different. Get the high praises of God on your lips. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the writer says here, high praise can be expressed through various forms of worship and even in daily life through actions of obedience and love. So it's the high praises of God is not just something upon our lips as far as songs and worship, but it's our life. It's our daily life. It's our actions of obedience and love. Do you know we worship when we're obedient to the word of God? Do you know we worship it and express ourselves back to him by what we what we say every day and not just what we say at church? Do you know that our obedience and our love for God and for other people expresses worship? &gt;&gt; So it raises the level of our worship not just at church but every day. It raises the quality. Here we go now and I told you to put your seatelt on. It raises the quality when you say high praises. It raises the quality of what's coming out of your mouth every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're a a morbid complainer, you heard a morbid obesity, &gt;&gt; morbid complainer, then you haven't found the high praises of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. True. &gt;&gt; And if you think this is just uh this high praises is just singing in church or shouting or speaking in tongues. No. High praises on our mouth means letting our mouth be used of God for the right things. &gt;&gt; And shutting them from saying the wrong things. &gt;&gt; I'm here to make it clear. The high praises of God is letting your mouth be used of the Lord to speak the right things, to speak edification, to speak things that build up instead of tear down, to speak. It raises the quality of what's coming out of your mouth every day. And it shuts its mouth from all the rest of it. Can you say amen? I don't believe it's only what's coming out of these mouths at church that count. I referred to a story Wednesday night. I don't know if you heard it, but a man in front of his children prayed and he prayed such a wonderful prayer of thanksgiving for his food. But then the rest of the meal, he complained about the bread. He complained about the milk. He complained about the meat. He complained about everything. He wasn't thankful. And his daughter said, "Dad, do you think God heard you when you thanksgiving in your prayer?" "Of course he heard me. I prayed." "Did she said, "Did God hear you when you were complaining about the food that you thanked God for?" Shut up, kid. Get out of the room. What a sobering thing. How weird can we get sometimes when we get so super spiritual and out of the same lips can bring wonderful prayers of thanksgiving, but out of the same lips complaining, &gt;&gt; negative. I was just wondering whether I'd call it what my dad used to say, diarrhea of the mouth. &gt;&gt; No, I better not say that. My dad was only qualified to say things like that and get by with it. The third poll is tied to saying the right thing. &gt;&gt; Right. It is also tied to the sword being in our hand. How many know when that hand that sword struck brother Brandham's hand and he said this is a a king sword. It was so beautiful. It wasn't fake. It wasn't a vision. It was actually a real sword he was holding. &gt;&gt; A real sword. &gt;&gt; And he held that. He said, "I've always been afraid of those things. I'm glad I didn't live in the days of the nights. I didn't want to be part of that kind of battle. But yet now he realizes what it is." And the angel said, "This is not a king sword. This is the king's sword. And he knew he it had to be the very word because Christ is the word. And it's not in heaven anymore. It's not in another dimension anymore. It's actually put into the very hand of the prophet. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't to stay there. It's supposed to be put in the hand of faith in the hand of his people. Can you say amen? And that's part he says, "What is this?" This is the third pole, brother Brandham. It's not the end of your life. It's the third pole. Part of the third pole is the sword being put into the hands of the people. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so it's tied to the sword being in our hand, but I don't think sons can come to this secret when they give themselves liberty with their mouth. You can hold the sword all day long. As a matter of fact, some people with this message and this sword, it's become dangerous because they're not using it on the enemy. They're using it on one another. They're using quotes on one another. They're using quotes to slash everybody else. And they're not even living the life sometimes. But oh, can they quote brother Brandham and oh, can they quote the scripture and it's in the hands of the wrong people. But I believe it's not just what's in our hand, it's what's coming out of our mouths. &gt;&gt; And I just feel like that the third poll also is tied to what we say in our mouth. I was up late a couple nights after I preached that sermon on the high praises of God in her mouth. And uh I don't know, you don't know the preacher side, but the preacher side is that you're always thinking a few days after, I should have said that. You left that out. I should have said this. Oh, I missed that part. Oh, and I suppose the sermon could have been three or four hours long if I'd have done all that. But you just look for what God wants to bring. But I had that for a few days. And uh I wasn't complete. And that's maybe why I'm finishing it today because it wasn't complete without bringing this home to what comes out out of our mouth every day outside of church &gt;&gt; and outside of our prayers because we're always respectful with our prayers. We learn we learn that God was listening to things that were said both sides of it. We learned something that God was listening and things that we wouldn't think he was listening in on, but he was listening in that little room when had height, someone else was in that little room because when Hadtie Wright said just the right thing, God was listening. God was there. God heard what she said and the right thing come out of her mouth and God was listening and he stepped in and said, "I'll give you anything you want in the name of the Lord. You ask it," Brother Bam says. And God is here now to give you anything you want. And it's because something was said. And guess what? God was listening. &gt;&gt; Why are you saying that, brother Paul? Because we forget God's listening. &gt;&gt; We forget God is acting upon the confession that's coming out of our mouth. &gt;&gt; Whether good or bad, God is acting upon the confession that's coming out of our mouth. And God was listening when Hadright said that. God was listening. God was in the boat when that brother said he said maybe we should just go over there and just see how they're doing. There was a some neighbors across the way across the water and they brother ran they're all fishing and the brother just says maybe we should go. We haven't seen him in years and just say hello to them. That's all he said and it pleased the Lord and a little fishy got got its life back because why? God was in the boat. God was listening to what was being said. But someone else was listening when the prophet lied about not being in the house. &gt;&gt; When the lawyer called his wife and he said, "Tell him I'm not here." &gt;&gt; Guess what? &gt;&gt; God was listening. &gt;&gt; God was displeased with what was said. Oh, I didn't really lie. But no, eventually he said, "I lied. I stepped outside the door, but it was a it was kind of a white lie. &gt;&gt; I love these little stories because it shows us that prophets aren't just up here somewhere floating on a cloud. &gt;&gt; They were human beings. All the prophets of the Bible were human beings. And we can see their humanness even in the Bible. But it doesn't take away from because people have capitalized on that and tried to destroy and try to behead what the prophet brought. We were watching that chosen thing when John the Baptist uh John the Baptist uh had his was beheaded by the woman there that arranged the whole thing. Had her daughter dance and uh my wife said, "I don't want to watch this part. It's too it's too gory for me." And I said, 'Well, hun, our prophet of this age gets beheaded all the time on the internet. &gt;&gt; Everybody awake today. &gt;&gt; I said, that's nothing new. Our prophet's getting beheaded every day. Brother Brham says, you destroy a man's influence. That's worse. You can kill a man's influence. That's worse than shooting him with a gun. And every day, every moment on the internet, on social media, everywhere, he get our prophet of this age gets beheaded. And some of you feed on all that stuff. I don't think you should I think you should pull away from it. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; I don't think it should be given credit to even come into your mind &gt;&gt; because we don't take value out of someone who has an agenda like that. We know the position. We know God has sent us this prophet of his age. Why does the devil come back? And so, you know, here he beheads the prophet. You know why he did it? Because John was the one who stood up and spoke out against that. Just like the original Eliah Elijah, he didn't care about what Jezebel thought. He's the one that spoke up against it. &gt;&gt; And now the same spirit of Elijah on the Baptist was not afraid to call the women out of their generation that were acting wrong, living in adultery, living in sin. It's not lawful for you to have her. And from that moment, you can even see it in the movie. From that moment, she set her heart to get rid of him and to behead him. Why? Because she didn't want the man of God correcting her. That's true. &gt;&gt; But God was in that room and God heard that little statement. God hears what's going on. And I wonder how many believers have not caught this higher place that he's calling us to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That God is calling an army of the last days with a sword in their hand and the right high standard for what's coming out of their mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the quote that I get didn't get to. Matter of fact, two weeks ago when I preached this service and I come back to my I I headed back home, come back in the bedroom. My wife, she says, "Is there a" She quoted this quote to me. She said, "You should have read this quote." And I said, "It was on my notes. I didn't get to read it. I didn't have time." Oh, I forgot to read that. That quote. She said that that sealed the whole thing. She goes, "I got a wife that's in the word of God. Jesus, remind me. You should have used that quote. &gt;&gt; Here it is. Here's the secret of this. The Pergamist Church age. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the same mind of Christ, for she knows what he wants done with the word. It's not just that she has the word, but she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; That takes character. Can you say amen? She performs the command of the word in his name. For she has thus sayaeth the Lord. It's not just that she speaks thus say the Lord. She has thus sayith the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered. It comes to a full harvest serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have thus sayaith the Lord or they keep still. Amen. &gt;&gt; Le Fontaine standard revised version of that. They have thus sayith the Lord or they shut up. &gt;&gt; They have. So, so not only have they learned to be led of the Lord to speak the word at the right time, but they're led of the Lord to shut up when it's not the right time. I shouldn't be getting more amens than this. It's kind of a solemn service, but it's not just growing and we're thus sayeth the Lord. We're going to speak the word. We're going to speak this. And I I believe this is the hour we live in. But it's not just that she has I say the Lord. She'll have it or she'll keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling his own word. He did not complete all his work while he was on his Listen to this now. He did not complete all of his work while he was in his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. Did you hear what he said? Jesus didn't complete all of his works, but he's going to complete it in the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He did not complete all his work while he was his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. She knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. But he will now fulfill through the bride that works which he left for this specific time. The bride knows when to speak and knows when to shut up. She will have the right things or keep still. She will learn when to stand still and when to wait. She'll know when to speak and when to go forward. Can you say amen? You know, brother, the the the messenger of the age was preaching to sons in the end time. And he preached why cry, speak, and go forward. But he also preached Paul a prisoner. I want you to just catch these services now. He preached, "Speak to adopted sons. Why cry? Speak and go forward." But that's not the only thing he preached. He preached Paul a prisoner, which meant that sons of God are learning when to speak and not when to speak. And they're submissive to the will of God. &gt;&gt; He preached once more, Lord, Samson. Once more, Lord, work through me. But he also preached, "Is your life worthy of the gospel?" Yes. &gt;&gt; He preached possessing the enemy's gates. But he also preached humble thyself. &gt;&gt; He preached paradox where he said Joshua said, "Son, stand still." There was no Bible for it, but he needed it. And a son of God, adoption now, spoke and said, "I have needed this. Son, stand still." That's what he preached in paradox. But he also preached, "Lean not to thine own understanding." You see how God is teaching sons of God at the end time that it's got to be both. It's not just this power, but it's this silence behind the power that you're willing to be silent when it's time to be silent. &gt;&gt; Because before he said, "Why cry? Speak and go forward." He said, "Stand still and see the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He preached spoken word as the original seed. But he also preached the seed of discrepancy. All that was about the seed. Word coming out of the mouth is that God actually speaks it through a prophet and it's the original seed coming from what's being said. But he also preached that words said are the seed or words of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; It comes through words. It's all backed up by the Bible. Everything the prophet preached here in those sermons is all backed up the Bible. I'll remind you of one verse among many that backs all this up and it simply says, "Death and life are both in the power of the tongue." Can I get an amen this morning? Death and life are in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A person was honored once with an award. They knew 10 languages fluently and so they were being awarded. But the honor was not just that they knew 10 languages fluently, but the award was also that this person knew when to be silent in all 10. And while I was ministering on the sword and the hand, and the pie prays on the tongue, I mentioned some places where the worship was not striking it just right with God. I went from from Cain worship all the way through and mentioned some places where the people were worshiping. They were sincere. Sometimes they were very sincere. Uh sometimes uh that they weren't sincere, but there were elements missing in the worship. And when the elements were missing in in Cain, he was missing blood. He was missing a revelation. He was missing sacrifice. And we think that we're oh, it's worship. It's sincere. It's to God. So we God just accepts it. Not always because God would like to strike just the right type of worshippers, especially at the end time, who worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the woman at the well, there'll come a day, there's an hour coming when the true worshippers will worship him in spirit and in truth. It won't be missing the spirit and it won't be missing the word. At the end time, they'll have it both together. And I want to be one of those true worshippers. Can you say amen? If you want to know who I am, I'm not Paul Leaf Fontaine that has a gift to sing. I'm not Paula Fontaine has a gift to preach. You know who I am? I'm one of those true worshippers at the end time. And whether I could sing or preach, I want to be one of those true worshippers. &gt;&gt; I want you to see it in my life. I don't want you to see it at church. I want my grandchildren to see what I'm excited about in life. And it's not about things. It's about bringing worship in my life to this God. That's what I want them to see. I'm not all these other things. I'm a true worshshiper of God. How many want to be a true worshshiper of God? &gt;&gt; Half of you. Well, praise the Lord. Maybe we can keep preaching and you desire to be what Jesus said. I want to be one of those true worshippers that he prophesied about. &gt;&gt; To worship him in spirit and truth. So sometimes the worship didn't strike right to just bring pleasure to God because there were elements missing. But then I mentioned a a couple times where it struck just right. I brought up the temple and somehow all the elements were there and it struck just right to bring pleasure to God. And you know what happened? All the instruments were in order. All the worshippers were in order. All the dedication, the consecration, everything was in perfectly in order. And there was such a heart in the people just to step back and just worship their God. And it struck just the right thing to the glory filled the temple. And the preacher couldn't even preach. It struck just the right worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I didn't get to Jericho because in Jericho something struck just right. &gt;&gt; Because this this city that God had given him was walled with walls that were so thick that they could have chariot races around it. That's a pretty thick wall. And it was impossible to overcome something like this. And the power in this army on the seventh day when they shouted on the seventh day when they shouted the walls shook and the walls crumbled and they walked right in and took the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the mystery of the power was not just in the shout. It's true. &gt;&gt; The mystery of power is not just in noise. I know that's pushed a lot in some of our ranks, &gt;&gt; but you're if you're pushing just noise and you're working it up and you're working up the shout, missing the other elements, &gt;&gt; then you're missing the mystery &gt;&gt; of what the third pole will do. &gt;&gt; I mean that very respectfully. But listen, don't miss the scriptural patterns because for six days there was six days of absolute silence something happened where God was pleased and the right thing came together. The right shout came together. &gt;&gt; Catch this now. The re the ratio is six days of silence to one moment of shouting. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to sit and enjoy that a minute &gt;&gt; because I feel like in some of our circles that racial is not there. &gt;&gt; Silence isn't emphasized at all. &gt;&gt; Silence makes people nervous that they've got to we got to say something. You ever have somebody that in a conversation in the you have the what is it the 30 second l? Is it 30 seconds or five minutes? It's okay. You can, you don't have to be silent. You can say it. There's a law in the conversation and somebody's just got to say something and then they usually say something stupid because they can't handle the silence. Somebody's telling about someone a few weeks ago. It's like they just got to say something, you know, well, we should do this, we should do that. Just, you know, it's okay if nobody has something to say. Tina, that's a quotable quote. Put that out. Put it on your refrigerator. It's okay if nobody has something to say. &gt;&gt; But you've been in that kind. They just blurt something out. And sometimes, you know, it doesn't even have time. They just think it and it quickly goes and spills right out their mouth. They didn't let their heart ponder it. They didn't use any discernment of the Holy Ghost. They thought it and it spilled right out and they said it. I can't believe you just said that. &gt;&gt; Six days. The ratio is six days of silence to one moment of shouting. It sure seems like some groups got a real imbalance in the ratios, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The ratio is way the other way and actually eliminating the obedience in being silent. silent for six days. That's not even in the scenario. And to believe that the victory came only because of the shout to believe that the victory came only because of the shout is not sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; The obedience of seven days of God's people to follow God's orders, that's what gave power for the shout. [Applause] The silence for the first six days was a test of faith and obedience. Maybe this is why God did it because he had already given him the city. Most of us would be saying, "Glory be to God. Let's have a shout. Let the horns blast. Let the rams horns blast. Let's get the ark going. Let's go get it." Maybe he was testing their obedience. No, we're not going to get it for seven days. And for six days in your tents and everywhere, everybody does not utter one word. &gt;&gt; You know, listen, friends, I don't know how that was accomplished. I do not know how it happened. If they were human beings like you are and I am, I do not know except for this incredible respect for Joshua, who's the type of the Holy Ghost, and respect for God and respect for his strategy for victory. &gt;&gt; And enough people saying, "If that's what God said, that's the strategy for battle and victory. That's what we're doing." And for six days, I don't know how they did it. They were human beings. Human beings can't shut their mouth. They give themselves permission to say whatever they want to say whenever they want to say it. Human beings are like little two-year-olds who say whatever they want to say whenever they want to say it. &gt;&gt; But if we're going into adoption, we're saying, "Lord, get control of this tongue." &gt;&gt; That only edification would come out of it. &gt;&gt; And not just in church, but on an everyday basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a test ensuring that the people did not voice any doubts about the effectiveness of God's strategy. That's what one Christian writer said. That's not my own words, but I like it. He was God was ensuring that the people did not voice any doubts about the effectiveness of God's strategy. No unbelief, no doubts, no question. Why? Why do we have to do it that way? Well, that's the craziest things. God always gives us God's already given us the the city. Uh you know uh what's the test? The test is whether we can hold our tongue from complaining and giving our own opinion to God's orders. Why can't we take the city now? Joshua God said Jericho is is ours. Let's go. Why am I holding this trumpet and I can't use it? You better use your trumpet when God says to use it. &gt;&gt; And you better use it for God. &gt;&gt; And you better use it in harmony with the Holy Ghost anointing. &gt;&gt; You better use your gift in the will in the channel of the word of God or it'll get out of the word of God and you think it's worship and beneficial, but you better keep your gift in the channel of holiness in the channel of God and the way he wants to use your gift. Can't get enough amens this morning. I believe this is the truth. Come on, Joshua. Let's go take it. You know, Joshua, I think it's the devil on the preachers holding the people back from shouting. It's the devil speaking in your ear, saying not to get up and shout right now. Don't quench the spirit, Joshua. Now's the time to shout. No, it's not time right now. It's time to wait till God brings us in a certain place. And you never have to legislate the shout. God will say, "Now let out a shout and the walls of Jericho will come down." &gt;&gt; Don't quench the spirit, Joshua. Don't quench the spirit, you icicle preachers. &gt;&gt; And brothers like that are completely missing the mystery of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Completely missing it. &gt;&gt; There's one verse for the seventh seal. in Revelations 8:1. And there was silence in heaven &gt;&gt; for the space of about a half hour. &gt;&gt; That's the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal, there's no symbolism for it. There's nothing said of it. And brother Bram says because he wouldn't give anything out to let Satan impersonate it. That means Satan can impersonate every gift. Satan can per imp impersonate. Satan can use gifted people. Satan could do all of this in the realms, but it's time for not just to be dwelling in the gifts. This is different. Satan will not impersonate it. And that's why heaven is silent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For a space of time. &gt;&gt; And when heaven's silent for a space of time, then the the the the thing people try to do is we got to make something up here on the seventh seal. We got to come up with something because it's been too long. Moses, you're taking too long to come out of the mountain. We're going to have to build a calf. &gt;&gt; We got to build an image up. We got to do something. And they got shouting and rejoicing because Moses took too long to bring the word from the mountain. &gt;&gt; And every time man gets in trouble, every time, you know, uh Miriam or excuse me, Hagar, Abraham, would you take my my servant Hagar? And maybe God meant for the promise to come through her. It's we're always trying. And so under the seventh seal, the ultimate thing of the coming of the Lord, he says, "Leave it alone. Don't touch it. Don't mess with it. And just trust God in the silence." And I guarantee you when this comes to its culmination through an obedient people, you will not have to work it up in any camp meeting. Can you say amen? It'll be his people that are obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; And there'll be a final shout. Can you say amen? And I believe there'll be a body change and we'll get out of here. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of power this seven seal is bringing to the people. &gt;&gt; But it was marked by silence. &gt;&gt; Silence for six days. People get nervous when it's silent. Let me skip some of this and for my time this morning. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many sermons in Pentecost took this text of the walls of Jericho coming down after the shout? How many sermons have I heard my whole life? And every time, every time the shout was emphasized. &gt;&gt; Never the six days of silence. &gt;&gt; The shout of the people brought the walls of Jericho down. We're going to raise the roof off this place. We're going to shout the walls of Jericho down. But I wonder if there's really any power there or if any walls are really coming down &gt;&gt; in people's lives. &gt;&gt; And I wonder how many gossip are in that group. How many complainers are amongst the heavy shoutters? How many proud people? How many boasters are in the same crowd of shoutters? I'm not against shouting. I I I pray that you could we could find a shout this morning. I'm not against it. I've been amongst them. I've danced. You've seen me dance, worship the Lord. To think that I'm against this. But if you're only emphasizing the shout and say, "That's the power." I wonder sometimes if there's not really walls of Jericho coming down in people's lives and it's got gossips and complainers and proud and boasters. They can't control their tongue from the corruption and things they talk about all week for six days. But oh, on Sunday they sure shouted. &gt;&gt; But what came out of your mouth the rest of the week? &gt;&gt; God's calling for the high praises to be in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Another level of praise. Another level of communication. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; John Wesley is widely cited for his sermon, The Cure of Evil Speaking, in which he defines the sin of evil speaking. it's a sin and offers a method for dealing with it. The most famous antidote, however, comes from a conversation where he's responded to a woman boasting about her talent for speaking her mind. Some of you heard this, the famous antidote. A woman approached Wesley and stated she prided herself on speaking her mind, calling it her talent. And Wesley's famous reply was, "Well, ma'am, the Lord wouldn't mind if you buried that talent. And out of his sermon, the cure of evil speaking, he says, "Evil speaking is speaking evil of an absent person, relating something evil which was really done or said by one that is not present when it is related. Mhm. I'm going somewhere with this really stated person absent relating something which was really done or said by the one that is not present when it is related. It's deadly poison. Speak evil of no man in their absence. A distinguishing mark of a Methodist should be that he censures no man behind his back. &gt;&gt; Wow. He's really saying some things even for brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read brother Brandham in a minute, but they're saying the same truth that believers had a problem with their mouth giving themselves permission to say negative things. &gt;&gt; Don't you think I'm not preaching to myself this morning, but I believe God's calling us to high praises on our lips. &gt;&gt; Interesting thing about something Paul said, and it's only 12:30. I got time here. The interesting thing about what Paul said in 1 Corinthians, he rebuked the people because they were going to court with one another. They had matters to settle between one another in the church. In this Corinthian church, wasn't that large, but they had matters to sell. They were fussing with one another about something. Couldn't get it resolved. And Paul said, "You don't even have the maturity to resolve it between yourself." And you're he was rebuking because they were going to the the the courts of the land to settle their disputes internally. &gt;&gt; And you know what he's saying? He's saying you are so immature that you have to get some outside source to be the maturity to settle matters. He says you should be able to be mature enough now to settle matters amongst yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they weren't. And I find it's real interesting that people they don't even go to the worldly courts when they have something against you. They have their own court. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's true. in their minds and in their mouth &gt;&gt; and they draw their own conviction and conclusion and they have their own court. I don't expect too many amens on this and I don't have really have it necessarily in my notes. I just feel to say it when John Wesley said that the other person's not present, he don't get a chance to defend himself. &gt;&gt; But you've had your own court. &gt;&gt; You have drawn everybody in. You are the one that has the accusation and you're the judge. You're the jury. &gt;&gt; You're the witness. &gt;&gt; You're the condemmer. &gt;&gt; You're the lawyer. You're everything. &gt;&gt; And then not only that, you draw your own conclusion. You settle on it. You bring a conviction. You bring in an indictment. You bring in a conviction. And then you put the other person in jail because I'm not going to speak to them again. And I put them in jail in my life. That's good. &gt;&gt; And you did it all without me being there, &gt;&gt; without the person being there. Well, that's a what they call uh it's it's related to a kangaroo court. &gt;&gt; And a kangaroo court is an unofficial court that happens. And there's no balanced presentation there. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the other person isn't even there. And it's a kangaroo court. &gt;&gt; It's an unofficial. There's no balance. There's no accountability. You just conclude on that person. You say it and that is it. &gt;&gt; How can I say this? May God give us grace in this service this morning to grow out of this form of thinking &gt;&gt; and this court that you make against people. &gt;&gt; Let's move to the next messenger. Martin Luther said this after John Wesley. Martin Luther said it is common pinocious plague. It is a common penocious plague that everyone would rather hear evil than good about their neighbors. Even though we ourselves are evil, we cannot tolerate it when anyone speaks evil of us. Instead, we want to hear the whole world say golden things of us. Yet, we cannot bear it when someone says the best things about others. Those who are not content just to know but rush ahead and judge are called backbiters. Learning a bit of gossip about someone else, they spread it into every corner, relishing and delighting in the chance to stir up someone else's dirt like pigs that roll in the manure and root around in it with their snouts. &gt;&gt; Now, you think I'm a hard preacher? Maybe you should have lived in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; And he'll tell you what your gossip is. He'll tell you the stuff that comes out of your mouth and tell you that it's evil speaking. Paul called it in the Bible corrupt communication. &gt;&gt; Negative communication. &gt;&gt; It's not edifying. It's not building up. &gt;&gt; It's corrupt things coming out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a believer of this message. My goodness. Um, what's coming out of your mouth every day? &gt;&gt; How many preachers have you tore down? Our messenger said, I'm coming to a close in a minute. If the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say, Lord, don't let me never have the root of bitterness springs up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of me. that poison acids, malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It will run him from the tabernacle here. It'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here. Hurt your pastor. It'll do everything. See, don't do that. You just wax that much closer together. Take the buckle. As a brother testified, a minister here the other night about having a buckle, seeing it in the vision, just that buckles on the whole armor of God. Just pull her on. Tighten up. Move right up close to one another. Love one another. Anyhow, talk nice about one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, this is real deep this morning. &gt;&gt; This is deep into the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Talk nice about one another. This is actually &gt;&gt; Never mind. Talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another. And then God will bless you. &gt;&gt; How many want to be blessed? &gt;&gt; Say nice things about people. &gt;&gt; Ask forgiveness if you've been saying the wrong things. &gt;&gt; Stop doing it. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to myself. Stop doing it. Stop talking negative. Stop &gt;&gt; talking trash. Another place that I pulled up late late last night. It's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people. They would say, "Well, I'm weak. My faith is not very much. I'm not a very good Christian." That's just what the devil wants you to say. So now it's not about talking down talking down other people. This is talking you down. &gt;&gt; It's talking you down. Well, I'm not a very good Christian. That's just what the devil wants you to say. You're just talking his language, right? Then see, you mustn't never say that. Don't never let your testimony be negative. Let it be positive all the time. &gt;&gt; I am saved. I have a I have God in my heart. I believe him with all my heart. Do you believe in divine healing? With all of my heart. Let your testimony always and your thoughts and everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind. And I'm adding to that. Say, and don't let it spill out your mouth. &gt;&gt; Never let a negative thought come in your mind. If you could help it when it starts that, don't entertain it. Well, you say, "I can't help the thoughts from coming." Well, that'd be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place, but he could sure stop them from roosting. So, that's a good thing. You see, you can't help the thoughts when they come. But don't entertain them. Just pass it on. No, sir. Jesus Christ is my savior. All things are mine by God and I'm going to keep them. &gt;&gt; I'm going to testify of them. And God can only bless as you confess that he has done it for you. &gt;&gt; God can only bless you as you confess what he has done for you. He's the high priest of our confession. Wednesday night, we'll be back into our open confession as we were this last Wednesday night. It's just interesting how the Holy Spirit's just dovetailing these things together. And I can tell you friends, it's not me. The Lord is teaching sons and daughters. The Lord loves you enough to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; You go ahead and go back to your old life today if you want to, but God's calling you to a high praise on your lips. Can I get an amen? God's calling you to something higher. God's calling you something greater. &gt;&gt; Don't be stubborn. Don't dig in your heels. &gt;&gt; Yield yourself to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God can only bless you as you confess that he's done for you. You see, say nice things about one another. Say good things about one another. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Desire to speak a higher dialect. A dialect is a particular form of a language that is peculiar to a specific region or or a social group. That's what dialect means. It means the language is similar except this particular dialect it's peculiar to some. You start talking positive things. Some of you starting tomorrow, how about today? &gt;&gt; You're going to be very peculiar to your family. brothers, you start using this to your wife. Why don't you start there and you walk in and you say appreciative things and lovely things and nice things. Brother Bram says say nice things about one another. That didn't just mean your brother and sister. It meant your wife brothers and your your husband's sisters. You start doing it though, you're going to become very peculiar to your wife. She might faint on the floor and you have to call 911. A dialect a means a particular formal language that's peculiar to a specific region or a social group. We need to speak and brother Bram says when you talk negative you're talking the devil's dialect. &gt;&gt; You're speaking his language. &gt;&gt; When you down yourself and down other people and you've done it for countless years. Oh, you've been in the message, but your mouth is not in the message. &gt;&gt; You came in the message 40 years ago, but your mouth has not been baptized by the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; And you talk about your sicknesses. You talk about your pains. You talk about the preachers that have hurt you. You talk about your uncle that's hurt you. You talk about all everybody who's wrong in your life. And you sit home and do it. And you you haven't let this message get a hold of your tongue yet. Very good. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being straight this morning. And I'll say it again. I'm preaching to myself just like I'm preaching to you. But we need to speak God's dialect. How many want to speak God's dialect? &gt;&gt; I'm going to issue a challenge as I close this service because I don't like the fact that we, you know, just come and hear a sermon. And I know the Holy Spirit has to do his work, but starting tomorrow because it's the 1 of September. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to challenge this congregation. A whole month of not one negative thing coming out of our mouth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can start today if you want. I'm starting tomorrow cuz I want to get out all that stuff that No, just kidding. No, the Holy Spirit's leading you. Start right now. &gt;&gt; A month of No, you say, "Well, a month and then can we say whatever we want to?" I'm challenging because I think this is going to change more than what you realize. &gt;&gt; I think this is going to create atmospheres that you've never dreamed you'd see in domestic life, in family life, in whatever it is. It's going to change it. Your negative hasn't changed things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; You're still the same. In some ways, you're still the same way you were. So, your negative confession hasn't changed. But you watch the power on your tongue of life &gt;&gt; and you watch it change things. &gt;&gt; Talk nice about every person, say nice things about them and and to them. And that includes everybody. It includes your homes. A whole month of not speaking one thing negative. And when you do speak something negative, give $50 donation to the church for the air conditioning. You know, I wouldn't do that. It sounds like a little kid. That sounds like a kid. You put a dollar in the in the bank when you said something wrong. A month includes everybody. Includes your homes. It includes in your car. It includes your co-workers. It includes your boss. It includes your wives. It includes your husbands. It includes your kids, your extended family. &gt;&gt; It includes your past. Don't say one negative thing about your past. &gt;&gt; Draw out of it what you learned from your past and speak positive what you learned. Bringing me back to you. Keeps bringing me back to you. What are you doing, Brother Paul? I'm singing a song from Brother Jack Duff's new album. My trials keep bringing me back to you. &gt;&gt; Bringing me back to you. That's a That's a sign, Kenny, for you to come to the piano. Not even subtle. He keeps bringing me back to you. I'll not complain about my worry and pain cuz it keeps bringing me back to you. Bringing me back to you is what the Lord's trying to do. I don't know the rest of the words to this song, but I was playing it this morning in my room. [Music] It's for co-workers. It's for boss. I'm not even going to ask of a show of hands because I don't believe in making vows. I think we need to trust the Holy Ghost in our lives. &gt;&gt; But there's a certain there's a certain discipline we say, God, I really want to do this and I want to see the potential of what it could be. &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to raise a show of hands, but in your heart, I'm going to do this for a month and I'm going to see what the Lord will do. Not one negative, only edifying that comes out of your mouth. I know you kids, you parents got to discipline your kids. But don't add to it pronouncing doom on their whole life because they made a mistake. You never get things right. You never You'll never be anything. No, no, no, no. That's negative. Correct them. Tell them what they did wrong. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about stuff that comes out that's not edifying. your boss, your wives, your kids, your extended family, your past. Because your past, you keep bringing it up and keep reliving it. Joseph said all the bad that his brothers did to him, he says God meant it for good. &gt;&gt; This is the only way for those who seek high praises upon their mouth, higher ground. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I desire to speak a higher dialect. &gt;&gt; Your past is meant to bring you back closer to him. Bringing me back to you. I don't know the words. You know them. Bringing me back to you. I'll not complain about my worries and pain cuz they keep bringing me back to you. Oh, bringing me back to you. is what the thing's supposed to do. Da da da da da da da. Because it keeps bringing me back to you. None of them know it e either. None of them know. Nobody knows it, you know. Uh and they recorded it in the studio and they still don't know any. But I know a good one. Lord, lift me up to higher ground. Can we stand together? Lord, lift me up and let me stand [Music] by faith on heaven. Table land [Music] a higher place than I have found. Lord, let the high praises of God upon our lips high ground. Lord, lift me up. [Music] My faith on him [Music] a land a higher place that I have found. Lord my feet on higher ground walk. I'm pressing on [Music] the upward that high calling in Jesus Christ. New heights and gain gaining every day. Still praying as I'm onward. Lord, let my be on higher ground. High praises Lord. Lift me up [Music] and let me stand [Music] on heaven. [Music] Oh, a higher place than I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Listen to this. My heart has no desire. This should be our desire this morning. Where doubts arise and fears dismay. Though others may dwell, where all this abounds, he's abound. My prayer, it's a different dialect. I'm looking for higher ground. Oh Lord, lift me up [Music] and let me stand by faith on heaven. Table of a higher place than I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. [Music] I want to live above the world. Though Satan thought and me are heard, for faith has caught the joyful sound. Yes. The song of saints on higher ground. Sing it now with all your heart. Lord, lift me up. Raise me Lord in the power of your resurrection. Raise my lips in the power of your resurrection. Lord, [Music] oh a higher place than I have found. Lord plant my feet on my ground. Last verse I believe. I want to scare the most high. Oh Jesus. Yes. Of glory. Still I pray till heaven I found. Lord lead me on to higher ground. Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven table. a higher place [Music] than I have found. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Can we ask the Lord to help us? Heavenly Father, you've presented something to us this morning. Some of it, Lord, I've never pondered as deeply as this. And how important it is that the high praises of God be upon my lips, not just when I'm preaching, Lord, Lord, you anoint us, Father, and we're able to yield to the gift and you're able to say wonderful things. Sometimes, Lord, I admire the things that you bring through me, Lord, as not my own, but what you brought through me. But it's on an everyday basis, Lord, that we give oursel permission to speak anything out of these lips. And Lord, if our body belongs to you, then our lips belong to you as well. Forgive us, Lord. Cleanse us. Purge us of this urge and this thing that we give oursel permission to do. Lord, I've offered a challenge to me and the church, and I have to live it first. Lord, give me grace. Help me. And if we fail, Lord, we'll bring our repentance to you and get right back on track. [Music] Lord, help us and give us strength in this challenge, Lord, to direct our tongues and direct what we say, to be silent when we need to be silent and only speak when there's words of edification to be offered. [Music] A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold and pictures of silver. [Music] So may we have words that are fitly spoken, that are thought through. Granted, Father, we pray. We love you for your correction. We love you for your encouragement. Come near us, Lord, as we draw near to you. Thank you, Jesus. And we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I want you to turn to somebody and tell them something encouraging right now. [Music] We're starting right now. Starting not tomorrow. Starting right now. Tell them something encouraging. As embarrassing it as it is. [Music] Everybody saying, "God bless you." That's encouraging enough right now. I can't think of anything. [Music] You know, one time we had a youth meeting years ago and I challenged the young people to look to the person next to them and write out things that they seen strengths in their lives and they did that. You talk about the Holy Spirit coming down in a special way. And just that other person hearing it from another believer, that's really what you feel about me. That's you see my strength sometimes better than I see in myself. It's an encouraging thing. It's a strengthening thing. Amen. So, if you go and say that to somebody today, that'd be wonderful. We'd appreciate it. God bless you as you're dismissed in Christian love. If anyone needs prayer for a need or sickness, we're remembering brothers and sisters in need. Sister Emily will continue to remember the prayer requests that come through uh this week, this Wednesday night, and also over the pulpit this morning. Remember all them if you would take them home with you uh and remember those. Uh people depend on your prayers. when we put that out on Telegram or read it, they they say it because they know this congregation will go to prayer for them. Bring it before the Lord. Amen. God bless you all in Christian love. Lord, lift me up. Come on, brother Michael. And let me stand by faith on heaven. Unable [Music] higher place. [Music] Let's sing the fourth verse again. I am pressing on the award way. New heights and day every day still great as I am back. Lord lay my feet on higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand my faith on him. Stable higher than I am. [Music] Lord, let my feet on higher. [Music] My heart has no desire to stay. We're down to rise and fears dismay. Though some may dwell where they abound. My prayer my name is highest. [Music] Lift me up [Music] now. Let me stand my heaven st [Music] I am found. Lord plant my feet on higher ground. I want to be above the world. No Satan's darkness and me for God. The joyful sound. The song God sings. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Let me stand by [Music] a higher place than higher ground. Lord, make my feet on higher ground. I want to scale the utmost high. And catch all glory bright till I to heaven. [Music] for me to higher [Music] than I am. Lord, let my feet on high ground. Lord, wake me up and let me stand. I wait on [Music] stable land. I am then I am Lord. [Music]
