========================================
businesses it's our heads Heavenly Father I'm so grateful father because that is the best place where we can be Lord even through the in the midst of the storms father that we are facing right now you are there with us you are you're bringing us through the storm father of Life Family situations lower sicknesses and everything father you are there we can trust we can rest father knowing that you know that be behind those uh gray clouds father there is rest there is a sun that is shining father that's what we want that's where we want to be to this morning Lord may you bless us as we speak of you father may I step away or Lord may you move me out of the way father and may you speak your children what we need what it needs to be said father we love you Jesus we we trust in you this morning we we just want to say how much we love you Lord how much we're so grateful to be here Lord how much we are uh privileged to be here Lord there are other places where they don't have this privilege father but we can have it we can have your your presence in our midst Lord and your your love your joy unspeakable and full of Glory father even in the midst of our trials or our tribulations father certainly you are good father your name is a mighty name the righteous run to it it's a strong tower and the righteous can run toward to that Tower and they can be saved father you can see that there is so many righteous this morning father but it's not our own righteousness is your righteousness in us that's what we can run through that Tower and your name is a strong tower for us this morning Father we thank you we love you we bless your name bless the reading of the word Lord bless your children as they have dedicated this time to hear from you Lord bless our pastor as well and the remainder of the service we love you and we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning is certainly a privilege to be in the house of the Lord amen you know when when you think about the book of Philippians in in the Apostle Paul is writing there and he's talking about I can do all things through Christ and everything but I want I want you to notice where he was writing that book he was in prison so just think about it your situation this morning you may think you know it's like you know I'm going through sickness I'm going through tribulations I'm I'm going through family situations but Paul in the midst of all of that he said I can do all things through Christ so what can we say this morning I'm not in prison amen I I I'm alive I'm I'm well I can breathe so what can I say this morning I can do all things through Christ amen so we're grateful to be in the house of the Lord so if you have your Bibles uh we can take our Bibles and go to the Book of Psalms chapter 36 just pray for me amen this morning is always you know that being nervous and what are we going to say and Lord how we're going to bring it it has to be in the right Spirit the right atmosphere and everything so just pray with me and for me this morning Psalms 36 uh verse 5 through 10. and Psalm 63 verse 7. in Psalms 36 verse 5 reads like this die Mercy O Lord thy mercy O Lord is in in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep oh Lord the upper service men and Beast how excellent is thy loving kindness oh God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings they shall be abundantly satisfied satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shall make them drink of the river of thy Pleasures for with thee is the Fountain of Life in thy light shall we see light or continue that loving loving kindness unto them that Know Thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart you may have your sins then Psalm 63 verse 7. and then is is a here it says because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice therefore in the shadow of the of your wings will I rejoice and this morning by God's grace we can talk about Under The Shadow of thy wings under the shadow of thy Wings you know meditating in this phrase this morning you know David expressing himself and and he will say in the shadow of your wings hide me under the shadow of your wings so this morning by God's grace we can meditate on that what does it mean to be on there under the shadow of his wings you know Danny we go back to Psalms uh chapter 17. David is writing here in um if you you know when when you look at the different Psalms they have they have a purpose and they they they were written at a specific time in life of the people that were writing them amen so if if we read Psalm 17 chapter 8 8 17 and verse 8 it says keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy Wings this is David and then from the wicked that oppressed me from from deathly enemies who come past me about so now what was happening or why did David write this song and then I I went back a little bit of history on this song he was writing this song in the midst of crisis in the midst of a crisis that he was going through he says Lord hide me under the shadow of thy Wings amen can can that be our prayer this morning Lord hide me under the shadow of thy wings that doesn't mean that my circumstance is Gonna Change what it means is I'm gonna be hidden under the shadow of your protection Lord that's what I want this morning amen let's let this be a reminder that in whatever situation we may be this morning as the storm of sickness family situations financially stress raged against us we can have the same prayer as David hide new Lord how many is that is your prayer this morning Lord hide me oh Lord Keep Me O Lord Praise protect me that's my prayer Lord hide me under the shadow of your wings Lord and then if you read Psalms 91 Psalms 91 verse 1 through 4 it says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the mosque shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and he is my Fortress he is my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver the Liberty From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise the noise on pestilence and then he shall cover thee with with his feathers and under his wings shall thou Trust his truth and if I if I if we can say you know we may think that all the Psalms were written by David but this Psalm specifically was written by Moses and if you read the entire Psalm then he's talking about a pestilence wasn't he the leader in Egypt from pestilence he was so now he's able to write this and he says but that's what he's saying he shall covered it with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler and I was thinking well okay with the shield that that's a shield and there's the partner but if you look if you study that in ancient times shields were very large and they were used to hide behind during an attack usually from arrows or spears that were being thrown by the enemy but the popular was a small Shield that usually fit on the wrist or forearm of the soldier and was used to in hand in hand to come in it for combat amen so it's in that wonderful to know Lord I can trust when the big comeback when the big bottle is coming I know that I can trust you I know that you are my shield and then when the little ones may come against me I know that you are my Buckler but then you look here it's like when he's saying under his windshield that trust and then he's saying his truth didn't Jesus said I am the truth I am the life I am the way then Moses is writing his truth he's gonna be my my shield his word is gonna be my butler his truth will be my peace his truth who will be the one that is going is going to sustain me through the in the time of the drought amen I'm shaking but I'm okay it's like we're amongst family man he's gonna talk as if we're having a conversation but then it's not exciting amen you want to be screaming and you want to cap people people's attention amen but help us Lord this morning amen now there was uncertainty sir from what uh talking about Ruth there was uncertainty from what she was going to be while she was going from Moab to Bethlehem the only person she she was acquainted to was her mother-in-law what a lot she had so that was a good mother-in-law amen and many love their mother-in-laws amen she might have had many questions you know Ruth may have had so many questions she was like is this true am I making the right choice is this real you can have the same questions this morning what am I doing here is this true is this message true is this Bible true is this real is God alive today can my complexes be dealt with this morning can the past hurt be healed can broken relationships be restored oh we can say praise the lord we go by faith and we don't go about by side we go back by a true experience another religion amen because religion has failed us time and time again because what is religion is just the covering these peace because when you start thinking about something from a religious perspective or a religious Duty it becomes like what is other people gonna say about me if I am if I dress this way or if I if I do this in my life but when you see as a relationship with God you're not gonna do it by what people is going to think about it just you're gonna do it out of love to your heavenly father that's a different thing amen religion and an experience a relationship amen we go by faith we go we don't go by sight because if we if it were by side long time ago we would have been left on the side of the road how many can say Amen to that but his Amazing Grace had kept us so far amen so that's what we're here this morning you know certainly this stress and under a lot of pressure but the Lord is good this morning amen and I can give you a little testimony here my family experience uh and I I have shared this with some of some of you but like remember hearing the testimony of my grandpa in my grandpa since his early childhood became an orphan and for sure he was rejected and he lived in in the streets when he was six years old I was talking to my mom he was like well you know you when after his mom like my mom's Grandma after she passed then they were they were they went to live with one of my grandpa's sisters and then the the husband didn't like my grandpa so they were kicked out so they they so they were they were like in the streets when he was six years old so I was just thinking Lord how is it possible that a a young child or like a six-year-old he was able to accomplish so what he was able to accomplish but you know as he grew up he became a successful businessman and but then in his late 20s he was in the porch of his home he was thinking about about life and then he was thinking about how empty he was and perhaps he was ready to take his life but Jesus went by his house Jesus went by his house I won that this morning if if you're in need may Jesus come by your house may he come and change your situation amen you know he was getting ready you know life is is worth nothing living in the condition that he was living but then there was this sister who was a prayer Warrior say man she used Bye by he she just passed by his house and reviewed those recital thoughts without knowing that Grandpa was dealing with those thoughts he just said I rebuke them in the name of Jesus and he said you know but what was happening here after that he was a leader he he gave his heart to Lord and then he became a missionary for the Lord and then he he became a you know Pastor in everything why is that praise the Lord because my grandpa he he was here under the shadow of the almighty God if he wouldn't have lived I wouldn't be here this morning amen what can we say that that is that the purpose of God cannot be defeated if you're here this morning is because God has a purpose for your life you know and we hear that over and over and over again but it's like we have it has to become a revelation to our hearts that Lord you have a purpose for my life and if you don't know your purpose ask him Lord show me your purpose there is a purpose for your life can you believe that this morning we might get discouraged for example you know think about David he got discouraged but he was able to always go to the greatest source of strength and I invite you to go there this morning if you feel this courage come to Christ come to the Fountain of Life as we as we as we read in the life we will see light oh we can say Jesus do not pass me by and I'll think about Ruth you know she was going from a place where she she was used to everything and she was going going to another place where everything was foreign to you was foreign to her everything was new to her the Traditions everything was new to her but now she went out from out from her people to a land that she didn't know but when she gets to Bethlehem the people were looking at her past people were looking at her past people were looking at her lineage you know she she was she was uh related to to Lord in one of his daughters right so that that was not a good name for her to have but she came to the right place she came to the house of the The House of the the bread of of God Amen but you know the people there the religious community they couldn't see beyond that amen they couldn't see beyond that but how great is when she met boas she looked beyond that he saw the potentials that were in her how great he sees it is that when you come to the Lord certainly the religious world you know they are looking at your past or or where or where your parents were coming from but the lord of the land or Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's looking beyond my faults he's looking at the seed that he that has been deposited in my heart and more than that he's in he's looking at the Royal seed he's looking that you are a child of God and he wants to deal with your complexes he wants to deal with any areas in your life because people may focus more like on the spiritual realm but I can tell you when you are kind of in the daily living you have to deal with that as well you know nobody wanted her you know when she when she went to the field nobody wanted her nobody wanted to talk to her if you look at the Book of Ruth he can be divided in four parts and if you have this coffee version of your Bible there are four parts that the Book of Ruth is divided and the first section is root decides amen there is brother Brandon says there is four stations or for uh Junctions in Ruth and Boaz the first is Ruth is deciding amen she had to decide and and then he says well all of you I guess I I I've had it he says she had to decide whether she was going to go into the land or not so that's the message for us this morning you have to decide whether you want to be here or not whether you want to serve the Lord or not or you you are just kind of wasting your time you have to decide you know we think I have decided to follow Jesus have you decided really amen so she whether she was going to the land or not with Naomi she had to make a decision then after she got there the next thing she had to do she had to serve in the field above us and there he was there barefooted and gleaning behind the Reapers and serving and then after she cut she had found Grace in in the sight of Boaz she had to wait isn't that amazing you know the Lord we come to church you decide you come with all that fire and then you you you're serving and then the Lord asks you to wait he's like Lord you want me to wait I have been coming to this church for so many years and now you want me to wait well that was what happened with Ruth so now she's not a foreigner to us anymore so if it applied to her it applies to us this morning there are prayers that you have been that you have been that you have been having for years and you just have to wait amen after she had found Grace in the sight of boa she had to wait amen and then after she waited then she was rewarded amen so the first the first one what was it she cut she needed to decide whether she wanted to stay in Moab or she wanted to go with her mother-in-law and then she had to serve when she came to to Bethlehem now she was serving in the fields of Allah say man and then she had to wait why because Boaz had to do some work in order for him to be fully redeemed and then after that she was rewarded that's the same condition that we we are this morning you may be in your deciding face maybe this morning that you want to serve the Lord you don't want to serve the Lord but hey make a choice now in the Book of Ruth second chapter verse 10. and he's like why is he talking about about Ruth uh I'll tell you why I'm talking because we're remember that we're talking about Under The Shadow of Your Wings amen now in a second chapter of the Book of Ruth verse 10 it says then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger what is that if you just think about this verse here what is that it is a sign of reverence and submission she went to defeat aboas as soon as the first time she went to her feet to his fate and and she said why have I found Grace in thy side in Boaz verse 11 and Boaz answer and said unto her it had fully been showed me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how that has left thy father and thine mother in the land of that Nativity and art come onto a people which thou knows not heretofore what now what's this verse she had a testimony even though she hasn't been a long time in the land she had a testimony it's like well you you already refused to be in Moab you decided to follow your mother-in-law now I can appreciate something someone like that many many times people see our testimony and they can tell many good things but we only see our faults and our shortcomings amen like the spies when they they came back from exploring the land they saw themselves as grasshoppers while they have testify about them as a mighty Army it you know it depends on the perspective on how you're seeing yourself the Lord is seeing you as an overcomer and it will be up to you how you see yourself amen help us learn to change our perspective amen what is my testimony today can people testify on who you are can people see that you have been with the Lord may that be my testimony this morning Lord that people when I leave this building may people can see that I have been with you that I have had an encounter with you Lord everything is about perspective in verse 12 it says the Lord recompense thy Work in a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel and then he's saying under whose wings Thou Art come to trust why why does Boaz said under whose wings thou has come to trust because under his wings there is a shadow there is a shade there is protection in this case specifically talking about Boaz and Ruth it says in in this case it refers to under someone Superior than her in other words Boaz was proposing to Ruth it was a proposal from Boaz to Ruth it's like seriously is there is there a proposal I will show you but he was asking her do you want me to be your provider do you want me to be your protector do you want me to be your husband do you want me to be your headship amen he was asking her that amen but she didn't immediately responded with that yes but she answered verse 13 she said let me find favor in thy side let me do some work so that you see what's in my heart and then we will talk that's for you young men and you young sister let you see let let her show you some some some some things you know things in in terms of how does she manage a house does she know how to cook does he know how to work but Boaz was working he had already money and she was there just like well let me show you what I can do let me show you that I can make bread let me show you that I can make flour tortillas that's how we said in Mexico you know show me that and then we'll see we can talk my wife can make good tortillas so that's why she said let me find favor in your sight for thou has comforted me like now you're telling me something you have comfort in me and for that thou has spoken friendly unto thine a handmade in Maine so what is what is she telling him he's like you have been friendly you have shown yourself friendly to me but let me show you who I am let me show you let me show you my testimony and then you can decide then she says though I I be no like onto one of the handmaids had made handmade maidens amen and then the prophet of God says now notice closely now he's our Kinsman Boaz or arboas and you can find this is what what I really love about this quote brother says if you can find Grace with him you will find rest if you can find Grace in the sight of God you will find rest boss represented a Christ the rich man the the heir of all things the lord of the Harvest oh my when boas come riding out there in the carriage looking around over the fields and his eyes fell on Ruth he was the master he was the lord of the Harvest and she found Grace in his side there were a lot of Maidens in that area but there was one that found Grace in the sight of Christ and I can tell you there there is many people now upon the Earth but there is one that has found Grace in the sight of God and is here you are the one that had found Grace in the sight of God amen that's that's what the church is doing today what well the Lord the of the Harvest well he's going by he's not looking you know at the big things he's looking for individuals man and woman who are dedicated and had made a clean cut decision for Christ consecrated themselves to his service and you can say God I believe it every word of this book I believe it when you were when your word says anything I stay right with the word that's your word I believe in every word that is written I believe in that what that is what he's looking for the lord of the Harvest that's what he's looking for someone that is going to stay by with the word and that's what he he wants to give he wants to give the Holy Spirit to those who are hungering and thirsting for this now you know when when they came back in in there may be a lot of reading this morning but I want you to capture this and you know because we have like our youth like some some of them may not know about this but let's let's take a little bit of time to to explain some of this so we said that first Naomi in in limelick they went to uh to Moab for a season of time amen and they went with their two children right melanin kellyanne they went and and they stay there their their children they found wives for themselves or find Ruth amen but then um they they died so then they had to make a decision whether Naomi wants us wanted to stay there or not or she wanted to go back to Bethlehem amen so now there came a time when uh a she's like you know what I'm going I'm going back to Bethlehem she told her uh two daughter-in-laws he's telling them you know I'm going back back to Bethlehem and if you guys or if you girls want to want to stay here you're free to go because you know I don't have more children but if even if you want to wait I can get married and I can have children but then you have to wait 30 uh 20 to 40 20 to 30 years and then you can marry them and then the lineage will continue but but like don't wait for that but then one of them was like you know what she kissed she she went in and said you know what I'm going back and she returned and the prophet of God tells us that the one that is kissing the the kissing Naomi which was orpha She's kissing the word and he's she's just going back but then there is another one which is Ruth that she's not kissing the word and she's going back she's like you know what I will go with you your people shall be my people your God will be my God so that's what we're talking when we're saying that she had to make a decision that was the strongest decision or the hardest decision that she had to make because she was gonna leave her family behind she was going to leave whatever possession she had because she had to leave them behind because she was making a decision to go to the unknown and that's why you know like then she she she got to to Bethlehem and then everybody's looking at her funny and then you think about it wouldn't she be discouraged to see all these people that she thought that she would they were gonna welcome her with open arms and hey we're so happy that you're here no they saw her and they were like oh she's coming from Moab she's coming from from from from the from from something that that wasn't right wouldn't that be something that will discourage her to keep being or to stay in in Bethlehem for sure you know many times when we have made the choices for Christ we find ourselves in the same position you come to church and somebody you know they turn their face to you and then you're like well you know I made all these choices and now I come to church and nobody wants to talk to me nobody wants to fellowship with me well you know Show Yourself friendly as is stalking here so you know he didn't have to say anything but she showed herself friendly but one one thing she did she started serving as we were saying she started serving so if you want if you want to be involved in the congregation in the church and start serving and then you're gonna see you're gonna find out you're gonna find yourself a lot of friends you're gonna you're gonna grow better relationships why because now you're serving somebody had to do it and then the testimony came after that oh she's serving she's reaping there with with with with the young man and all the all the um the younger maidens they are on one side but she's on one side but she's serving Show Yourself friendly serve you know because I I like to serve in church everybody has to serve no but if you're gonna have friends in church you want to make a family in church serve that's what she did then she says boys and then she's like well she knew that the fields were above us right but brother Brandon says it's like when they they went back from Moab to Bethlehem they came during the Harley season it was the it was barley season was bread season it was fresh bread that was being served it was not all bread that was being served and the church in these last days through 2000 years of pagan teachings and all of that you have come in barley season why because you are receiving the freshness of life you are receiving the new bread the honey Out of Heaven amen this is the bread from Heaven that's what Jesus said I am the bread of life amen I am the bread of life your your fathers did eat mana and they are that amen but I am the bread of life that comes from God out of Heaven if I'm in if a man eats his this bread he will never die so this is a time for the church that now you're coming in that's that season where the where the word is is being planted and now you're reaping all of that and this is a time of uh new breath not all teachings no no not uh you know uh 2 000 years of teaching of formalism and all of that no you are receiving the fresh Manna From Heaven and that you can say I believe that amen certainly she was a gentile she was as communicated amen she she was she was being she was the worst but she was accepted as a bride amen and so now if you see yourself you have to believe that you are a part of the bride of Christ amen because you have come during this season where the world has been opened to us the seals have been opened to us and what is inside of those seals there is my name written in the last book of life that's what is in there is not in any any any complicated thing but it just says that my name is written in the book so now when the when we say that the Bible became a new book is because every single time you go back and read your Bible you are seeing Christ and I can tell you if you see Christ then you'll see you sir you will see yourself that's when we're talking in the Book of Ruth I'm seeing the bride and I'm seeing Christ therefore I am seeing myself with a relay personal relationship with Christ that's why go back and read your Bible go back and pray go back and talk him Lord Show Me Your Glory show me more of yourself when I open this book because this is the power listen this is the time of new breath in this we sing it's a new season is a new day this is the day that the Lord has made amen now in the book of root chapter 3 verse 7 it says in wimboas got eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to like lay down at the end of the Heap of green then Ruth came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down and then at midnight haven't we heard many times then at midnight there was a cry the bridegroom is coming here you can see the same thing at midnight there was a cry there was a cry what's going on there is a woman laying at the feet above us something needs to happen and at midnight the the man was start started and he turned over in a woman lay at his feet and he said who are you and she answered I am Ruth your mate servant spread your skirt spread your skirt over your maidservant for you are a next of kin so now she had a message for Boaz guess what we are related send that beautiful to know now you can come in in in during this time these the Midnight Cry where there is Darkness now you can come to Boaz and you can tell him hey we are blood of I'm brother of your blood I am flesh of your or your flesh I am yours I am yours is the same thing that you can see this morning now in in during in the midnight during the time of Crisis you can come to him and say hey I am yours and then here if you look the word here there is die skirt SK I RT these words in in I think it's in the Hebrew is canap and it literally means an edge or extremity and can and it can refer to the border of a garment in but also it is a word that is commonly used for a bird's wing so that's what we're saying is like under the shadow of your wind like in in in in in in in in the second chapter he's that you have come to under the Shadow and now in this verse specifically she's referring to the same thing but this word is frequently used as a figurative for protective care in other words she is like you know what you have said before in in in in in verse 2 and verse 12 the Lord recompense thy Work in a full reward be given the of the Lord of God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust she's like now she's responding and she's saying spread your skirt spread your wings express your the wings of your protection over your maidservant what is this and and then this word is frequently used as a a few figure for protective care and then if you read in the in the Book of Matthew 23 and verse 37 in in the Book of Luke Chapter 13 Verse 34 Jesus used the same analogy though in a different language when he's saying Jerusalem or Jerusalem how I have I have a desire to gather you as a hand with with her chickens Jesus is using the same the same thing why because there is protection under the shadow of his wings in fact in this precise context in which boas had used the same very word in speaking with Ruth chapter second chapter verse 12 the law recompense thy Work in a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust is saying the Lord is going to recompense you now she's like extend your wing can we say that this morning Lord extend your wings a protection rude was Now using the same analogy to request boas to bring her under his protective Wing as as her husband now she was saying yes I accept yes I accept your proposal making her meaning unmistakable as she pointed out his rights and duties as the near Kinsman because now she knew she knew a little bit more she knew a little bit more of the message she knew that now Boaz was a kinsman redeemer in other words remember in in Redemption there was when the husband was dead when the father was dead and there was nobody else that could take care of of the widows somebody will have to come and redeem them in order for them to preserve their name the only one that was that was close to them both Saturday in in in the third chapter it says when when he comes to her in verse 11 and there is one that's boy you know what I know it is true that I am died near Kinsman Habi there is a Kinsmen neater than I in other words Boaz was telling her there is someone in between you and I what can we say this morning there is someone in between God and you you know could be your flesh could be your desires who could be whatever it is who is he is the enemy that could be in between you and God but then Boba says Theory this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a king's man well let him do the Kinsman part but if he will not do the part of accusement to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsmen to thee as the Lord liveth lay down until the morning in other words he is like you know what you're still on my feet lay down rest and we will finish the mother in the morning what is this telling you now that there is you know we always say that like there is a it's going to be a resurrection in the morning wouldn't this be talking about Resurrection happening to Boaz and Ruth because he's telling her I will finish the matter in the morning and that is what's happening with us you know we may find ourselves during in the midnight of our crisis but Rejoice because there is always mourning coming amen she was obedient she laid up his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor because I would have Dishonored Ruth if she already had a name just think about her coming to the feet of a man if we already have a name right now that people make fun of us that you're following a man you're following these that and the other just rest and the Lord will finish the work amen and also he said bring the veil that thou has a pandian hold it and when she held it he measures six measures of barley think about this why six why not five why not for why not eight what why because six in the numerology of God is a number of men but he was the seventh he was the seventh portion for Ruth in other words seven is a number of completions so he was sending her a message in between the lines to tell her hey I'm giving you six but the seventh is coming isn't that amazing this morning you know here I'm giving you a portion of the word but the completion is coming Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he is coming he is coming to change your life he's coming to redeem you he has come already to redeem your life but now she didn't just keep the message for herself because when she came to her mother-in-law she said who are who who are thou my daughter and she told her all the men had done to her and she said there's these six measures of barley gay he gave me gave him in where he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law in other words whenever you come to church you will not live empty every time you come with a with a willing heart that you say Lord I want to be under the protection of your of your of your work you are not gonna live empty this morning verse 18. but there was a request Ruth is given a message from her mother-in-law and brother random says that the mother-in-law is the Hebrew church amen the orphan is is the denominational world that they are kissing the word and they are they are going back to the traditions and the documents and everything but he says that Ruth is the real church because she's making decisions that are going to have an impact in the future but you know Naomi she told her this then she said sit steal my daughter until thou know until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day he will not be at rest he will not rest until he finish the work in your life don't we read in the book of Philippians if he started the work he will be faithful to complete it until the day of the Lord look what Naomi tells tells Ruth sit steal just rest because it is now his part of the deal you don't have to do anything else now you just have to sit still now you just have to rest he won't rest until you are made whole he won't rest until you are filled with the Holy Ghost he will rest until your thoughts are changed he won't rest until your quest questions are answered but the Bible says be still and know that I am God in Romans 8 28 verse 31 sorry Romans 8 28 we read these many times but it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose is not your purpose it's God's purpose you are being called to a purpose that is higher than your purpose and then for whom he did for no he also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he may be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that is burned not his own son but deliver him for us all for us all how shall he not be with him as how shall he not with him also freely give us all things freely giving you all things who shall lay anything to the Church of God's elect he has the answer it is God that justify it who is he that brings come the nation to your life it is Christ that died yea rather that it is reason again who is even at the right hand of God who also make it intercessions for us and then who shall separate us from the love of Christ who who separated who could separate Ruth from the love above us nothing could separate her because she was already given a word you just be still and you will and he will finish the work that's the word for you this morning be still and know that he is God who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sore as it is written for thy sake we are kill all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us that's what Ruth could say in all these things he I am more than conqueror now you can say you can make fun of me you can mock me because I don't look like you but I can tell you I have a message I have a word from Heaven that I'm gonna be redeemed I have a message I have a word from Heaven that I can be healed this morning I have a message I have a word from Heaven that my family situation is gonna be fixed according to the perfect will of the father and then what what is what else is Paul writing here for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor that that nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord what can who can separate us from the love of God can separate me from the love of God criticism in all the isms nothing we're good here have a good time you know during that great feast the prophet of God says boys laid on the floor at night in a young woman beautiful morally righteous she had to put her confidence in Boaz without knowing him no matter what anybody had to say she trusted him as a righteous man and she had to do it and everyone that comes to Christ must do likewise you got to lay yourself at the disposal of Christ no matter what your mother says or what your dad says what anybody else says lay yourself at his feet root showed her confidence by laying her head upon his feet while he was sleeping she laid at boss's feet and when he woke up and he and he saw the car the confidence he but the prophet of God says one of these days he will see the confidence that his church has got in him when he's seen that confidence he taken out he taking his own robe his holy spirit he said he had to spread over hurt it was getting cold you know but he had to spread his robe over her and then he sent her on her Road and so did people it happened the same in the day of Pentecost amen the new church when they went out there you know they they were not ashamed because you know when she wasn't she was at boys's feet after that after when she went to her mother-in-laws she was not ashamed that she was at voice as Faith she was happy that she was able to receive a portion just one portion a small portion this the six portions of barley but she was waiting for her double portion and that is what is happening with the church today you have received a portion you know what is in part you have received it but when the that thing that is in part will be taken away then the the fullness of Christ will come to you and I believe we are experiencing experiencing the fullness of Christ in our lives in a small measure but when your body is ruptured then that will be the full expression of Christ in your life amen in order for God to redeem the human race God had to come down he had to be a human amen he had to experience your pain so I can tell you this morning that your pain this morning is not foreign to God because you can say well why am I experiencing well Jesus when he was on Earth he experienced everything he experienced all temptations that you may be facing today all the trouble the drama or anything that you may be facing today he already experience that amen because he he so he came in order for him to experience that to say you know what hey this is possible you can do this and I can tell you this morning you can do this you can overcome this layout they say an age you can you can overcome this morning you can do this and he was the lord of the Harvest the right kind of a man and Jesus was that man amen and now being under the shadow of his wings there is redemption amen what did he redeem the prophet of God says he redeemed you from you he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed and brought you back brought back everything that Adam had lost that is what happened when he put you in the pound shop certainly Satan put you in the pound shop and nobody could pay the price for you but he the kinsman redeemer was the only one that was able to redeem you amen that he was the only one that was closer to you so he is the one that paid the price Jesus Christ uncover it was your kinsman redeemer and he redeemed you from every Court Every curse of the devil he redeemed me from Every curse of the devil he redeems your soul he redeems your sick body he redeems your weary dreary Spirit he brought you happiness he brought you your joy he he brought you that what that is what the Redemption brought you brought you peace he paid for your peace he he brought you long suffering goodness gentleness meekness power the Holy Spirit he brought you Divine Healing that is what Redemption had brought to me Divine Healing all these things Jesus Christ brought to you because he was our kinsman redeemer amen may I have that confidence under the shadow of his wings that there is rest that I can I can be still in that I that I can know that he is still God that I what I need to do this morning is just to keep pressing on keep pressing on keep pressing on Amen now in The Book of Leviticus chapter 15 verse 25 and remember we're talking under the shadow of his wins and we're talking about garments we're talking about the Hem of His Garment but now I want you to notice this Leviticus chapter 15 verse 25. it says and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days are out of the time of her separation or if it run beyond the time of her separation all the days of the issue of her unclean uncleanness shall be as a days of her separation she shall be unclean every bed everything everything where she was you know everything was unclean verse 27 and whosoever told you those things shall be unclean and shall be shall washed his clothes and bathed himself in water and be unclean until they even he's talking about the law and he's you know I think last time we were talking about like how the law was written with a purpose but then when Jesus came there has to be a fulfillment there has to be something that needed to happen so that people could be like well he he it is what what the law says but what does Jesus say you know in this specific instance we're talking about uncleanness of our offer of a woman that had had a a blood many days amen and and then but now in the Book of Luke chapter 8 43 it says uh in a woman having an issue of blood for uh 12 years which had to spend all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any and we know about we have heard about this woman you know she she went to all the doctors because she wanted to be clean you know because when you're gone when you go to the doctor is because you want to receive your healing amen and but there was a desire and she heard that Jesus was was coming her way and she's like I have to do something I I I I have to get to Jesus how many this morning I was like I want to get to Jesus this morning I I want to Touch the Hem of His Garment this morning and you know she had in her heart she was like she came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood stenched and Jesus said who told me when all denied Peter and Dada were with him said Master the multitude trondy and Prezi and says Thou who touched me because they were in in our in like kind of the the physical sphere but they were not looking at what's going on in the spiritual Realm there was something else going on there and Jesus said somebody had touched me for I perceived that virtue is gone out of me in other words power had come out of me and when the woman saw that that she was not hit she came trembling and falling down before him again coming to the feet of Jesus coming to the feet above us why because there was something going on there at the feet of Jesus she declared unto him before all the people for what for what cause she had touched him and now she was healed immediately and she and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith had made the whole go in peace notice the law was against her why because she wasn't clean for many days and she couldn't be around people because if they would touch her they would have to do all their lord rituals and they have to go and wash themselves and then wait for seven days to be again back among the people so nobody wanted to be her friend just think about it that every time she will be around people they will call her or they will they will scream at her unclean unclean unclean don't be near near to her because she is unclean oh Lord under the law there was nothing that could be done but Jesus was passing by amen what can we say this morning Jesus was passing by she wanted to be under the shadow of his wings as she said if I could only Touch the Hem of His Garment I will be made whole the same request as Ruth extend the hand of your garment and I will be made I will receive a new name so when they were in front of her and we're like you are unclean because you have you have a blood issue and she was like well the blood is not coming anymore I'm clean amen so the same you know it's like can we say that this morning Lord extend the Hem of your garment when the enemy is coming and telling me of my mistakes or or my past wrongs now I can say I am not unclean anymore because I have touched Jesus Jesus has touched me this morning and he said that I am clean he said that I am saved he said that I can receive the holy spirit this morning government Don't We Sing cover me when I am broken coming me when or cover me amen Grace descended and made her whole she was clean in that very hour oh if there is someone cleaning uncleanness in my life Lord Let Me Touch the Hem of your garment this morning I don't want to be calling clean anymore I don't want to recall a sinner anymore Lord I want to be called a redeemed I want to be under the shadow of your wings Lord I want to be at your feet this morning I no longer want to be against your word Lord against yours your preacher lure against the pastor against the church Lord I want to be clean if there is something in my life if there is a complex in my life if I have something against my brother if I have something against my sister Lord make you clean it this morning may I may I make it right this morning that's my desire this morning Lord I don't want to be against your word because remember when you have something against your brother you're against the word of God when you have something against your sister as Jesus said it is not the girl stabbing them in the back but is when you speak evil against your brother or your sister then he's you are against God help me Lord this morning help me to talk good things about one another as the prophet of God says when you don't have something good to talk about your brother or your sister it's better for you to use the ministry of shut your mouth help me Lord this morning made me whole made me clean this morning if there's something in my life Lord I want to come at the feet of Jesus I want I want to come at the uh Ruth came to voice and she said now extend the skirt now extend your wings Lord this morning I want that this morning the prophet of God says bring me on your wings Lord away from these things of the world if the musicians can come let me fly away from the fields of this world from my bad habits from all my denominational Traditions let me come only to you their God that your Holy Spirit might pour eat pour into into me the Forgiveness of all my doubts may I tonight become your child fresh born in a new creature tonight catch me carry me away beyond the clucking of the hand of the hen car Carry Me Away to the eagle's nest where there that I could be nurtured by the word of God until I am able to fly granted Dear God that's my desire Lord all my habits all the things that I shouldn't be doing Lord I bring them at the feet of Jesus all my thoughts Lord whatever is is not if I even if I think something against my brother something against my sister Lord I'll bring I bring it I bring it I bring them at your feet Lord that you forgive me this morning Lord I don't want to be cold and clean anymore I don't want to be called a sinner I don't want to be called out wishy-washy that today I can be in church tomorrow I don't know my desire this morning is that you can catch this and you can say Lord I want to be under the shadow of your wings I wanna be under your protection I want to commit to you this morning because once Ruth was able to be under the shadow of that protection then she was she knew that she was commuting to Boaz she knew that all the men around her were gone and then she was now only keeping herself for both may that be your desire may that be your heart this morning that's my heart this morning Lord I am only yours this morning help me this morning Lord now he just bought our heads just to finish the woman we spoke about today Ruth the woman with the blood issue they had something in common according to the law they were not worthy they were condemned but Amazing Grace came to them how sweet is that sound that that save of rich like me there there is a place where you can be safe under the shadow of his queen of his wings at the feet of Jesus [Music] we've got bar heads in him in your heart there is something that you want to bring at the feet of Jesus even you can come to the to the altar but you can say Lord I want to be a steel I'm gonna make a decision for you this morning if I have been all these many years Lord wishiwashy kind of I can be here or I I don't want to be here may we make clear cut decisions for you this morning Lord that we can say I want to love you I want to be under your protection I want to commit to you this morning Lord that's my desire as my prayer Lord this morning may everything that I say may it wouldn't be only words father but may they be the groanings from My Heart Lord a desire from my heart that I want to be closer to you I want to be at your feet this morning that's my prayer Lord that's the prayer I I pray that that's the same prayer from your children that they want to be closer but when we live here we live different new people new minds that need new thoughts that we can live here for a given we can live here hard the Lord we can live here comforted Lord knowing that you have done the work for us because as we read who shall separate us from the love of God nothing can separate us from the love of God either on their your wings we want to be this morning pray this morning Father [Music] old stem foreign [Music]
