[5:28] [Music]
[5:36] [Applause]
[5:38] what is that in your hands
[5:43] [Music]
[5:53] if you would take us
[6:03] down
[6:12] [Music]
[6:19] [Applause]
[6:24] Matthew chapter 11 and verse 11. and
[6:28] then we'll go to Luke 16 16.
[6:30] Matthew 11 and verse 11. verily I say
[6:33] unto you among them that are born of
[6:35] women there hath not risen a greater
[6:38] than John the Baptist
[6:40] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[6:43] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[6:46] what a amazing scripture tonight to
[6:49] realize that when we take someone like
[6:51] John the Baptist who had the spirit of
[6:52] Elijah on him and such a powerful
[6:55] Ministry to introduce the Messiah coming
[6:57] the first time then we realize that he
[7:00] ends this verse by saying there's not
[7:02] risen greater than John the Baptist not
[7:04] withstanding he that is least in the
[7:06] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John
[7:09] the Baptist so this we look at things in
[7:12] levels and certain positions and they
[7:14] the world teaches us we're in certain
[7:16] High positions low positions but in the
[7:19] kingdom of God the least the least one
[7:21] among in the Kingdom of the least one
[7:23] that we would feel as the least and has
[7:25] no popularity has no position has every
[7:28] bit of the power of God available to
[7:30] them can you say amen and that's why he
[7:34] can see the least in the kingdom is
[7:35] greater than he God certainly puts his
[7:38] prophets in a place and a special place
[7:40] to speak through them but the prophets
[7:42] are not a special place where they get
[7:44] all of the power of God from Calvary
[7:46] every believer gets that from the
[7:49] greatest to the least and from the days
[7:51] of John the Baptist until now the
[7:54] Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence I
[7:57] quoted this a couple weeks ago I can't
[7:58] remember all that I was preaching on but
[8:00] I know I was talking about the
[8:01] dimensions and how that the dimensions
[8:04] of demon the dimensions of the demon
[8:07] demonic forces increase more and I
[8:10] quoted this scripture and I have a few
[8:12] things to say tonight just relation to
[8:14] this scripture because the Bible
[8:16] pinpoints the time of Elijah who John
[8:19] Master had the spirit of Elijah since he
[8:22] came and began speaking from that time
[8:24] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[8:27] from the Demonic realm so something
[8:30] triggers all that realm and I was
[8:33] talking about uh you know just the
[8:35] dimension of Hell spilling over into our
[8:37] Dimension and those things and this this
[8:40] gives the trigger for it where it
[8:42] becomes worse and that is when John the
[8:44] Baptist came and began to speak with the
[8:46] spirit of Elijah the Kingdom of Heaven
[8:49] suffered a violent attack from the
[8:52] Demonic realm
[8:53] um and then here I wanted to add this
[8:55] one in Luke 16 and verse 16 if you
[8:57] wouldn't mind Luke 16 16.
[9:04] it says here the law and the prophets
[9:07] were until John
[9:09] since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is
[9:13] preached and every man presseth into it
[9:19] so here's another pinpointing time to
[9:21] from the prophet John with the spirit of
[9:23] Elijah and when you hit that point
[9:25] because of the increase in the Demonic
[9:27] realm from that point of Elijah speaking
[9:30] then we realize that I'll just word it
[9:33] the way they say it here the king he
[9:35] says it here the kingdom of God is
[9:36] preached and every man does what if you
[9:40] want to get a hold of it you got to
[9:42] press into it one to finish that
[9:44] scripture in Matthew I'll finish the
[9:45] rest of it it says from the days of John
[9:48] the Baptist until now the Kingdom of
[9:50] Heaven suffereth violence and I didn't
[9:53] finish it and the violent take it by
[9:56] force I think it's interesting to
[9:58] realize that this is referring to John
[10:00] the Baptist as being uh when he spoke
[10:03] his word for the for the Messiah to come
[10:06] there was a turning point in the the
[10:09] pressures and a turning point in the
[10:11] Demonic realm to begin coming against
[10:14] the kingdom of God more than it was
[10:17] before Elijah spoke and I want to just
[10:19] emphasize that to you the the scripture
[10:22] pinpoints a time that when Elijah speaks
[10:24] something and he and that word goes into
[10:27] the land that that from that point there
[10:31] is a there's an anger there's a there's
[10:33] a stirring up of the Demonic realm
[10:35] there's a change that the Demonic realm
[10:38] was always there and it's always come
[10:39] against the word of God it's always
[10:41] thwarted the people God trying to hinder
[10:43] the people of God but there's something
[10:44] increased after Elijah's word goes out
[10:48] into the land something about Elijah's
[10:51] word that has power in it that when it
[10:54] goes forth once that word is spoken and
[10:57] it is sent out then it's in the land and
[11:00] one of the things that devil don't like
[11:01] about it is he's watched this pattern of
[11:03] Elijah when he speaks something God's
[11:06] word doesn't return void and Elijah's
[11:08] word had such a power of God behind it
[11:10] that Satan has learned once Elijah says
[11:14] it and it's in the land Elijah can even
[11:17] die but the word is there and the word
[11:21] will not return void in other words
[11:23] Elijah can die but the word is going to
[11:26] accomplish everything that Elijah said
[11:28] and now we have a history to watch
[11:30] because every time that Spirit was on a
[11:32] man everything that it said ended up
[11:35] coming to pass
[11:37] so there's something about it and maybe
[11:40] that's why the Demonic realm gets so
[11:42] tense and increases its pressure against
[11:45] the people of God it's not just because
[11:48] of you Satan doesn't Satan doesn't come
[11:51] against you because he doesn't like your
[11:53] personality or your looks or some
[11:56] personal thing or it has nothing to do
[11:58] with that it's the word that you
[12:00] received you are becoming that word and
[12:04] Satan knows if that word is in the land
[12:06] and you're becoming that word he's
[12:08] learned through history there's not
[12:10] anything he can do to stop it Elijah's
[12:13] word was so powerful that when it's in
[12:15] the land it affected the whole land his
[12:17] word went out Elijah could go off the
[12:19] scene and his still his word is still
[12:21] laying there ready to be fulfilled now
[12:24] if you go back in your Bibles to the
[12:25] Days of Elijah when he spoke something
[12:27] he said it's not even not even do with
[12:32] fall there's no rain until I call for it
[12:34] okay now he might have spoken that in a
[12:38] little Hut beside a tree I'd have to go
[12:41] back and read to remind myself where he
[12:42] spoke it
[12:43] he might have spoken to just a few
[12:45] people
[12:46] but it affected the entire land
[12:50] this one man who's Elijah he's a nobody
[12:52] Elijah's by Tish bite who's a dish bite
[12:55] never heard of this guy where did he
[12:57] come from
[12:58] but guess what his word was so powerful
[13:01] it stopped rain in the whole land
[13:04] you can't mess with God's word you can't
[13:06] mess with God's Messengers and when he
[13:08] spoke that rain no rain all of a sudden
[13:12] everything stopped up a famine in the
[13:13] entire land affected everybody
[13:16] and the No Rain affected everybody and
[13:19] then Elijah called for rain again and
[13:21] then he had The Showdown boy I could go
[13:23] into Elijah's life but I just want to
[13:24] make one boy when he began to speak it
[13:28] affected everybody and guess what it
[13:30] made the Jezebels mad
[13:34] I don't know what kind of woman she was
[13:36] before but when Elijah spoke is when she
[13:39] became angry
[13:42] and the demons increased I don't know
[13:44] she might have been a nice person I
[13:46] don't know before that but it was
[13:48] Elijah's word that triggered this
[13:50] vicious anger I'm gonna kill the man I'm
[13:53] going after him and actually Elijah he
[13:56] just kind of went and hid a bit you know
[13:58] and uh but but that's what triggered is
[14:00] this anger that's coming up what's why
[14:03] why would the World Council of churches
[14:05] in the Union begin to start and begin to
[14:08] form a union of churches in Christianity
[14:10] against the Bride of Jesus Christ
[14:13] it's the Jezebel spirit
[14:16] it becomes angry at the word of Elijah
[14:20] if you believe this message you're a
[14:22] target of the enemy
[14:24] you say well I don't I'm not living
[14:25] where I should be completely but I
[14:27] believe with all my heart I believe
[14:28] God's going to deliver me I believe I'm
[14:30] going to be a full matured adopted son
[14:32] of God I'm going to keep seeking the
[14:33] Holy Ghost I'm going to keep seeking him
[14:35] when you confess that you become Satan's
[14:39] greatest Target not because of you but
[14:42] because the word of Elijah and the word
[14:44] of God you've taken it into your bosom
[14:47] I'm resting in his word and there's a
[14:49] violent and increased violent attack
[14:52] against the kingdom of God and the
[14:54] people because Jesus said he said don't
[14:56] look for it somewhere else the kingdom
[14:58] of God is within you where's the kingdom
[15:00] it's not out here in the air it's in the
[15:02] people I'm preaching to unite his
[15:04] kingdom is within you and there's a
[15:06] violent attack against you because you
[15:08] hold the kingdom there's a when when
[15:10] John the Baptist spoke he said Elijah
[15:13] spoke as soon as that happened there was
[15:15] a triggering of all the Demonic realm
[15:17] and since then it's increased look how
[15:19] the Demonic realm has increased plaguing
[15:22] people's minds blazing not just
[15:24] sicknesses plaguing Minds sickness of
[15:27] the Mind why is it it's the enemy
[15:29] increasing his demonic forces against
[15:32] the elect I always like to say this you
[15:35] know he had 120 that come out of the
[15:37] upper room and uh
[15:39] Satan was going to you know what am I
[15:41] going to do with these because
[15:42] I had one to deal with in Jesus and now
[15:45] I got 120 to deal with
[15:47] and then thousands of souls were saved
[15:49] and this was multiplying by the hour
[15:52] and Satan's going I had one to deal with
[15:54] I thought I put him in the ground he
[15:55] must be alive because the same Spirits
[15:57] in these people it's because when you
[15:59] plant that seed in the ground a crop's
[16:01] going to come up it was just a few days
[16:03] instead of one Jesus to deal with
[16:06] instead of one Jesus to deal with he had
[16:09] 120 jesuses to deal with
[16:11] and within days he had thousands of
[16:13] Jesus to deal with they took note they
[16:15] had been with Jesus the world says these
[16:18] people they're like Jesus we're going to
[16:20] start calling them Christians which
[16:22] means partisans of Christ followers of
[16:24] Christ but it wasn't just they were
[16:25] followers or Christ they could see the
[16:28] same works
[16:29] the same raising the Dead the same
[16:32] walking in the shadow Peter cometh they
[16:34] come in the shadow of Peter and someone
[16:36] come back out as a leper Miracles took
[16:39] place where's Jesus at now Satan's
[16:41] having to deal with all kinds of it I
[16:43] believe that demonic forces increase in
[16:46] a violent way against the kingdom when
[16:48] this bride gets a hold of the word but a
[16:50] lot of times people don't talk about
[16:52] convictions and principles when it comes
[16:55] to sexual Temptation and we've been
[16:57] talking about those things a lot of
[16:59] people don't talk about them
[17:00] but I've tried to make the point that
[17:03] when you're living here in Satan's Eden
[17:07] and you're living in the manifestation
[17:09] of Sodom and Gomorrah the complete
[17:11] manifestation of it and you're raising
[17:14] children or you're a young person okay
[17:16] just think about it now if you know it's
[17:19] in the last thrust of Satan with demonic
[17:23] power of sexual Temptation nakedness
[17:27] homosexuality pornography all these
[17:31] things easy available then how should we
[17:33] be responding to that kind of onslaught
[17:36] of the enemy
[17:38] I tell you it'll take more than just
[17:40] laying back and saying I'm the Bride of
[17:43] Jesus Christ praise God I go to church
[17:45] on Sunday morning glory be to God I'm
[17:47] just going to live my life no I think if
[17:50] Satan's kingdom increases a violence
[17:52] against us that's the days of a forceful
[17:55] response back from the people of God
[17:58] and that's why I said that's why I've
[18:01] said that people criticize a bit
[18:03] sometimes that were too strict our
[18:05] church is too strict about courtship
[18:06] about dating we got all these guidelines
[18:09] and all every time I turn around there's
[18:10] another rule I just asked you a question
[18:12] I don't want to become a legalist but
[18:13] how legal how how strong can you be to
[18:16] speak about these things to give our
[18:18] young people some boundaries why would
[18:20] we have loose boundaries in a day that's
[18:23] increasing sex such lustful sexual uh
[18:27] perversion can you say Amen why am I
[18:29] being criticized for being too strict
[18:30] can we be too strict
[18:33] you don't have to say Amen to that but
[18:35] can we be can we be to the place that we
[18:38] gotta we shut our mouths and just let
[18:40] them do and let them all work it out I'm
[18:42] sorry my friend I love them too much in
[18:45] this age and I know demons too much I'm
[18:47] going to give them the word of God and
[18:49] practical things to live by so they can
[18:52] overcome in this age now I if I was back
[18:55] in Luther's day if I if I wasn't in the
[18:57] full manifestation of Sodom and Gomorrah
[18:59] then I may not preach on those things I
[19:01] might not give specific boundaries as
[19:03] far as a guy and girl and dating all
[19:05] that I may not talk about it but in this
[19:07] age under these modern conditions we got
[19:10] to talk about it according to the word
[19:11] of God because when the Kingdom of
[19:14] Heaven is suffering a violent attack
[19:17] the violent take it by force
[19:21] I got to get the kingdom I got to get a
[19:24] hold of it I got to give it to the young
[19:26] people
[19:27] and and as he said since that time the
[19:30] Kingdom of Heaven is preached and and
[19:32] those people press into it what's the
[19:35] other scripture
[19:36] he said the law and prophets were until
[19:38] and since that time the Kingdom of
[19:39] Heaven is preached and every man must
[19:42] press into it
[19:44] you're not going to get it by just a
[19:46] lazy you know lackadaisical kind of yeah
[19:50] okay I heard that before again no Every
[19:52] Man Has to press into the kingdom of God
[19:55] it's a forceful response to the enemy
[19:58] it's it's Satan it's it's a confession
[20:00] it's a forceful confession back he's
[20:02] talking to your mind and talking to your
[20:04] heart and beating you down there has to
[20:06] be a response to that devil speaking to
[20:08] you there has to be a force responsible
[20:09] well I just feel weak and I'll let the
[20:12] preachers do that I need to you know
[20:13] I'll tell you you can get enough
[20:15] strength that if you're not around
[20:16] account meeting you're not around a
[20:18] prayer line you don't have to wait till
[20:20] next year to the prayer line you get
[20:23] enough faith in your heart you can start
[20:25] confessing Satan Satan get out of here
[20:32] that's the kind of body of Christ we
[20:34] need
[20:35] that every day we're given a forceful
[20:38] response an aggressive response
[20:42] to this enemy not a lazy response a four
[20:46] you know and and there are situations
[20:48] that come up sometimes that uh make us
[20:51] that should make us angry with the Holy
[20:55] uh indignation towards the enemy
[20:59] not towards one another
[21:00] but towards the devil
[21:02] sometimes we don't get fed up enough
[21:05] with the Enemy
[21:07] and when we're not fed up with them we
[21:10] don't rise with a forceful response and
[21:13] he just walks over you every day
[21:16] because we're not fed up with them we're
[21:18] not angry enough about it don't get
[21:20] angry at people don't get angry at one
[21:22] another don't get angry at your husband
[21:25] get angry at the Devil
[21:28] I give you permission
[21:30] you know as preachers we preach be nice
[21:31] to people be kind bring your anger to
[21:35] the Lord Don't Let the Sun Go Down on
[21:37] your wrath don't get angry and anger is
[21:40] bad except for I'm giving permission
[21:43] tonight
[21:44] get angry at the Devil all you want to
[21:49] because some of you need to be angry at
[21:51] the Devil
[21:54] you're not mad enough you're not angry
[21:56] enough
[21:58] so he's walking all over you sometimes
[22:00] because you're not mad enough at him
[22:03] trying to take your family time to take
[22:05] your marriage trying to take your joy
[22:08] you don't get mad enough about it
[22:10] you get angry about it can you say Amen
[22:14] I'd be the times that we live in Friends
[22:17] I wonder if we should stay mad at our
[22:20] enemy
[22:22] we preach against anger and stay sweet
[22:24] stay loving but I wonder if that cross
[22:26] is over and how we treat our enemy who
[22:28] keeps robbing us and taking us things
[22:30] from us we get to lovey-dovey and accept
[22:33] things for life just I just accepted
[22:35] that we really the things that we don't
[22:37] have to really accept can you say Amen
[22:41] some problems we do as we spoke on
[22:43] Sundays some problems we do and we we
[22:45] thank God for his grace but there are
[22:47] other things that we just say no I'm not
[22:49] going to let the devil walk all over me
[22:51] push him back get back
[22:55] stay back
[22:57] trying to get my granddaughter's
[22:59] attention because that's what she always
[23:00] says stay back
[23:02] Ellie stay back
[23:05] stay back that's what we tell the Devil
[23:08] stay back
[23:10] don't tell your parents that
[23:13] stay back Devil stay back
[23:17] Satan stay back
[23:19] bad thought comes to your mind stay back
[23:22] I'm a Child of God
[23:24] you don't belong in my mind you don't
[23:26] belong in my heart you don't belong in
[23:28] my house you don't belong in my car can
[23:30] you say man nobody gave you permission
[23:32] to come around stay back
[23:36] stay back
[23:38] now I got her attention
[23:41] praise the Lord you love the Lord
[23:43] tonight
[23:45] and sometimes we just don't get fed up
[23:47] enough with the devil you know and we
[23:50] get angry at others people get angry at
[23:52] other people
[23:54] pretty easy
[23:55] but they're not angry at the Devil
[23:59] people get easily angry at other people
[24:01] anger at their spouse
[24:03] there was a couple that that were
[24:06] working with financial counseling many
[24:07] years ago
[24:09] and the financial counselor showed them
[24:11] all the stuff they needed to do to get
[24:13] out of debt I think it was the Dave
[24:14] Ramsey program and he put him on it's a
[24:16] great program to get out of debt and uh
[24:18] so they were instructed but at the end
[24:20] of the counseling he he said this thing
[24:22] he says now the instruction was you'll
[24:25] never get out of this even with all the
[24:27] instructions you'll never get out of
[24:29] this unless you get mad at your debt
[24:36] unless you're really angry about being
[24:38] in the ditched and being in the hole
[24:40] that you're in financially
[24:41] you'll never get out
[24:44] you have to be fed up with yourself you
[24:46] have to be fed up with the condition you
[24:48] have to be fed out because debt is a
[24:50] load on you that's terrible that is a
[24:52] bad thing but to get out it's more than
[24:54] just just taking a seminar it's more
[24:57] than psychology you have to be mad at
[25:00] the condition you're in and this
[25:02] counselor every time they met together
[25:04] he would say are you still angry
[25:08] are you still mad
[25:10] because if they lost their Madness and
[25:13] their anger against the condition they
[25:15] were in they would never get out
[25:17] so a part of his counseling I've never
[25:19] done this but it's I love it and I think
[25:21] I'll incorporate it in all my counseling
[25:23] then they come in the office are you I'm
[25:25] just gonna all right first of all are
[25:27] you angry at the Devil that's beating
[25:29] you up
[25:30] are you angry what the devil's doing in
[25:32] your life and in your family's life
[25:34] because if you're not angry and you
[25:36] don't have the grit and the faith to get
[25:38] out you may not get out
[25:40] we've got the word it has power we got
[25:42] the support from the body of Christ
[25:44] we've got the principles we've got the
[25:45] boundaries we've got we've got materials
[25:48] we've got scriptures we can hand it all
[25:50] to you but there has to be a faith to
[25:52] say I don't want to stay where I'm at I
[25:55] want to get victory over the enemy we're
[25:57] gathering together here and the devil's
[25:58] going to know and God's going to know
[26:00] that we're Binding Together because
[26:02] whatsoever we bind on Earth is bound in
[26:05] heaven
[26:06] everybody remember the commission to the
[26:09] church he said to the church whatever
[26:12] you bite on Earth will be bind in heaven
[26:14] say not bind any spirit that would try
[26:16] to bring my children bad dreams I bind
[26:19] any Spirit that's trying to bring a bad
[26:20] spirit in my home he stops at the door
[26:22] here I apply the blood of Jesus Christ
[26:24] over this whole household tonight
[26:27] you see what I'm saying it's not a lazy
[26:30] response it's a farceful response I mean
[26:32] business with this devil if he's going
[26:34] to violently attack this Kingdom I'm
[26:36] going to violently respond to him
[26:39] set grit to rise up that's that grit
[26:41] that just arrives that Force Rises and
[26:44] now wait a minute Satan
[26:46] wait a minute
[26:49] I'm a circumcised Holy Ghost filled
[26:52] believer
[26:53] everything Calvary bought for me belongs
[26:56] to me
[27:00] you're not going to rob me of any of it
[27:02] your brothers you think of shangar's
[27:04] position and you think of you you
[27:07] receive Inspire I pray you'd receive
[27:09] inspiration because it's the fathers and
[27:10] the heads of the homes and the men that
[27:13] really catch need to catch this more
[27:14] than any of them today
[27:16] you think of the inspiration that rising
[27:18] up the anger in shamgar that little
[27:20] farmer who didn't know how to go against
[27:22] 600 Philistines
[27:24] but he did he grabbed an ox code that
[27:28] shamgar didn't have any sword he didn't
[27:31] know nothing about how to use one he
[27:33] didn't have a shield but if he'd had a
[27:36] shield he wouldn't have known how to use
[27:37] it but he reached up and he got an ox
[27:39] gold that's an old stick that's got a
[27:41] brass lump on the end of it they beat
[27:44] the ox through the coral with it and he
[27:46] jumped out of that window out there in
[27:48] the middle of that road against 600
[27:50] armed Philistine and killed every one of
[27:55] them Hallelujah
[27:58] ask my brother can you say man that's my
[28:01] brother shamgar
[28:03] and the shamgars need to rise up tonight
[28:05] and say that's devil that's enough
