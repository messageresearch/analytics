========================================

his family dave and them are headed out tomorrow i don't haven't heard the whole story but man we just i just hugged his neck and now he's heaven out and i'm back in town but brother davis good to have you and uh with us and your mom greet your mom for us and maybe we can get a coffee or something before you go but we appreciate you all and bring your dad with you next time we'd love to have the rest of the romero family praise the lord john 3 16. everybody going to quote it because you know it wait a minute don't put it up there everybody knows this one for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god so believing is really important and this ministry comes of his son when he sends his son it's not to bring condemnation but it's actually to bring salvation so but as the scriptures continue verse 19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so it's it's not just his so somebody could just read john 3 16 and a lot of the church world and goes on that scripture we believe it with all our heart that he loved us enough to send his only begotten son but when he comes it's not just his son now you read and the scriptures are continuing light is coming with him so with his son comes light you see so you can try to accept the sun that was here thousand years ago and lived here had him under thirty three and a half years and three and a half years of ministry you can keep looking back to that but when he sends a son he sends light and the light is for the darkness in your life the light is to to shine and expose everything that's dark so when you start preaching that then you wonder some people back off from the sun and back off from why but i accept his son but you got to accept all of it when he comes when the sun is there there's light shining and exposes darkness amen and he said here he said that this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world his son comes how many know that his son actually is the revealed word of every hour it's not jesus of nazareth not just him 2000 years ago every time his son is revealed in every age it's the revealed word of the age and it's light where there's darkness but he says the reason they don't like the darkness is they love darkness rather than light they're not used to it because their deeds were evil it exposes their deeds for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved that's what the light does amen so i want his son but i don't want the light it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way i want the son the begotten son the lord jesus but i don't want my life exposed in the darkness it doesn't work that way look at this scripture that i found today verse 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light in other words they're not running from the light they're actually running towards it they're coming to the light they're not afraid of the light that his his deeds may be manifest that they are wrought and god in a little bit i'll read that in the amplified but what a powerful scripture he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god amen heavenly father blessed us tonight and we're so happy to be home back with our family here and lord jesus we pray you'll bless the word we feel your presence here tonight we pray you'll bless this uh time in the word tonight and bless those who are sick my stick my assistant brother brandon give him speedy healing lord for his surgery had today on his nose that you just give him speedy healing and may it correct the issues and problems and god i just pray that bless all any others who are out sick tonight i just pray you help them give them strength we commit the service to you now in jesus name amen amen you may be seated i thought it might be good to teach some scriptures here tonight and talk a little bit about the subject of accountability and accountability would be related to the series that we're talking about on sundays which is on authority we're taking authority from different avenues and different things in the scriptures so that we can understand god's true authority and what to bring our lives underneath but i want to talk in relation to this on the subject of accountability and maybe this is just another way another avenue or angle to look at authority looking at the subject of accountability and maybe tonight look at it just a little bit in a practical way because it's wednesday night and just a little bit more teaching way we'll see how the lord leads this i certainly believe in a that a christian i believe in a christian being accountable i believe a christian is an accountable uh if they're a christian they're accountable and not only under the obedience of god's word they're accountable to the obedience of god the word but also what god puts in their lives as delegated authority and if you learned a little bit through the series on authority you realize that god deposits or gives his authority in each generation he always has it on earth because he has to give his people direction he has to give his people leadership he never leaves his people without leadership and with that leadership comes power and comes authority and uh satan's actually afraid of it so it's not just that he brings a preacher and he's just bringing intellectual words with god's when god sends something it has his authority with it it has his power with it and demons are already afraid of it and actually only the predestinated are called to come under submission to it and say that's god's authority i'm bringing my life under it only the elect because the rest of them resist and so now i believe in authority and i believe also an accountability in the christian's life to not only the word of god but also god's delegated authority and as i've said to you many times people run away from authority any authority because authority has been abused even sometimes in our own ranks authority has been abused so people get afraid of it but we must not let the devil misuse or misinterpret something that would be powerful for us so and the way that that accountability works is is and and there's there's a lot of things to it but some things that we already know every man will be accountable in the end for his decision someday so if you're if you're not accountable to the word now eventually everyone will be accountable on judgment day everyone will give an answer can you say amen brother branham says that everyone will be accountable to the word that's been given them in their lifetime everybody will be accountable so so you're not gonna even if you get away and run away from accountability here you're not gonna run away someday because everybody will be accountable for the actions everybody about be accountable for their sins for me uh god gave a a sacrifice at calvary for my sins and i would rather believe in him and put those mistakes and sins on the sacrifice he gave for it than to meet it at judgment day and try to answer for myself [Applause] i would rather accept his blood sacrifice from my mistakes but every man every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus is lord if they resist it now someday every man becomes accountable and you remember brother brahma says what do we judge the world by your opinion my opinion what denomination do we judge it by what interpretation he said he'll judge the world by one thing and that's the word of god everybody comes underneath that standard and so so in in the dictionary accountability means accountable means required or expected to justify actions or decisions so you're required or you're expected to justify your actions or justify your decisions this is like a steward a stewardship or a boss over something is the as the owner has placed a suit and stewardship and jesus talked about this you know i put a hundred employees under under you and you're to manage them and you're supposed to make take the money and make something out of it and so in a year's time we have the steward has to be accountable to when the owner comes and says okay what did you do with my money the steward has to give an account for what he's done with what he has and this is a principle in the bible whatever god has handed here it is too much is given much is required so everybody's going to have an account everybody's going to be required something and especially if god gives us something today will be someday we'll be accountable for what god gives us you tell me how much the bride of christ is has been how much has been placed in our hands and to whom and much is given how many could raise your hand and say much has been given to me spiritually i'm a spiritual millionaire i'm not naturally at all but in in in in the spirit i'm a billionaire billions of dollars like trump used to say it he always says billions and he always talks in billions because he's a billionaire and i love how he says this is billions everything's but it's never dollars you know it's billions but he's not a spiritual billionaire we're spiritual billionaires here tonight and we may not have married much in this life may never have that much but i'm telling you we're rich people and to whom much is given much is required so it's not just required of being a witness and telling people about jesus but in our character if he's given so much of his word then much character in response that's required of us can you say amen so so all through the scripture we have this thing of being accountable something that's required and expected to justify our actions and decisions and often though this is after decisions we've already made tonight i'd like to talk about a little deeper in a deeper level to to expose yourself to the word and to godly counsel to to be accountable to the word of god and and godly counsel before decisions are made now the the accountability meant to required or expected to justify actions or decisions a lot of those are already made but what would it be if we say i want to be accountable i'd love to start living more of my life that i would be accountable that god could weigh in on the word could weigh in on before i make decisions so that my decisions are influenced by the word of god and by godly counsel i can tell you there's not a lot of people on the face of this earth that are doing any of that especially because we live in the spirit of laodicea which laodicea means people's rights amen so we don't see a lot of accountability to the word of god we don't see i'm going to be under the influence of the word from my decisions and i'm gonna seek out god's delegated authority and seek out some help in some godly people in order to make my decisions before i do it i'm gonna do we just don't see a lot of it and i'm gonna step out on a limb and say in my in my pastoring years i haven't seen a huge amount of that within the church and young people and yet i'm still going to teach it that it's a big biblical principle that you live a christian life accountable to the word of god influenced by the word of god and that you seek godly counsel got a ton of scriptures here for it and may if we don't get them tonight we'll get to them next wednesday night but listen accountability is is something that you want in your life as a christian you young people make it a a principle in your life of accountability don't be a lone ranger don't be i'm going to do this on my own say i want god's presence i want god's input i want god to influence my decisions so that's when we're really getting deep into the subject of accountability so you know we have lived with the results let me just ask it this way how many has lived with the results of poor decisions in your life i got i got all my my feet up and everything we we know what that means to live with the fruit of poor decisions and then you reap what you sow and all that principle goes and so we we some decisions we made privately and eventually they got exposed openly and it's embarrassing but their decisions that we made and a lot of them are without counsel without the holy spirit leadership without uh anyone inputting without the word of god we just made them for whatever reason and so we got in a little trouble you know and sometimes big trouble we've lived with the results of poor decisions we have made and we experienced the lessons learned through that how many would raise your hand and say i experienced lessons learned through making decisions too quickly and wrong without god's counsel we have learned that we reap the fruit of it and we we learn what that feels like to reap the fruit of our decisions without god and also then praise the lord we experience something through that and that's the forgiveness of god and the washing to forgive us of our wrong actions and our wrong decisions how many can raise your hand and i say i've experienced the forgiveness and the washing of god from bad decisions that i made didn't even deserve god to forgive me of it i did it it was all me i'm owning up to it and yet god in his grace forgave me washed it away can you say amen and as even restoring what i broke down he's restoring it back again we don't deserve that but his power can do it praise the lord let's give the lord a hand for his restorative work in our lives amen all of us have been blessed to see that made decisions and financial decisions 15 years ago i ended up with 10 rental properties within a year and some of them i just didn't seek enough counts on didn't buy them in the right places didn't do the right thing didn't read enough up on it and maybe didn't pray enough i don't know what all turned out but listen it's you know i've shared the testimony to you then you look at the mess that you've made and you you're like abraham ishmael was the mess that he and his wife had made and abraham tries to get god to accept his his mess his mistake and he lifts ishmael up said oh could it be ishmael oh that ishmael might live before you and god says no no i've got the promised son isaac i promise something else can you say man so we we bring those things and i've experienced lord i don't know if you'd even help me but help me get out of this mess help me dig out of it show me wisdom how do i do it please lord and he didn't have to do that but you know i can testify tonight god showed me a way out god showed me a way and i can say by the grace of god tonight that it's all been resolved i am debt free completely debt free and i never deserve that but god when we're sincere in our hearts god comes and restores yes you made a bad decision but i'm going to show your way out how much love is that praise the lord so we live through that and uh so but a thought come to me and when i was in washington a few weeks ago um just speaking about these the influence of our decisions and decisions and god is working deep in our if you have any spiritual discernment you see god is working at a deeper level in our lives the way that he's preaching through the ministers as at a deeper level this word is not coming just to give us a feeling or a sensation it's not something surface it's not just something to smear over something but he's really working deep in our lives and i want the lord just brought it to me that the lord the holy spirit's really working at the level at the level of our decision-making process he's trying to influence our decision-making and that you know we're on free more agency just like it was in the beginning and that eve fell because she exercised her free more agency fell with the serpent's reasoning of the word and so we see what's all come from that in six thousand years or whatever whatever it is and now we come back to the climax of this and brother brahma says this eve this second eve is to prove that we're not like that first eve we're going to reverse what happens so in order to do that then we're going to have to be careful of the influences that influence our decisions in our life and god works at us at a decision level all of us have lived through making mistake falling and god forgives us and restores us but god wants to make a powerful people that's under the influence before they even make decisions that they can make decisions of character the first time why do you think brother brown preached uh the message uh choosing of a bride you think it was just a sermon for the for the men and the women to know what to choose no he was talking about god chooses a bride a young man chooses a bride and when you're going to make that choice you better choose character but but the prophet through god now is teaching the bride of jesus christ what does he do he's teaching sons that when we make our choices choose character amen choose something of character choose integrity choose something that even when he talked about investments he talked about he said you can't just hold on to your money you got to invest it but you want to find some secure proven investment you don't want just about fly by night you know uh uh quit get rich quick scheme we don't do that so what's he talking about that we're good we're going to investigate we're going to invest our spiritual life into something we better make sure it's the word of god we better make sure it's the right pastor with the right balance because we're entrusting our soul to him we better pray about that and make sure it's right and that decision for a church better be a right decision because your family depends on it so what's what's the problem he's talking about influencing sons decisions when the whole world is making decisions based upon their own rights and based upon what they see on the internet every day and based upon about 50 years of feeding on hollywood most of their decisions are based upon the influence of hollywood families is under the influence of hollywood families and god says no i'm going to have some sons and daughters that come out of that influence and they're i'm going to deal with them at their decision level and they're going to make decisions and choose character there's going to be some young men that wait a while and they choose character it's not just the hormones rushing and getting married because i want to be with this woman that's what the world does but sons of god i'm gonna have some young men there that step back and say i know i want fellowship there's a thirst in me to have a wife all these other things when i step back because god's teaching me to choose when you choose choose character first and then if she's pretty fine that helps as well but you better choose character first i thought i was going to teach tonight but i feel like preaching listen jehovah god has provided his leadership in this hour to influence sons at a decision level now we make decisions and god forgives us and we had to restore back no at the decision level wait wait upon the lord he'll renew your strength god i've got a decision to make and i believe that god is big enough to influence this decision that i choose the right thing then you remember the scriptures god can restore if you felt if you make a decision and you fall and you make a mistake how many has ever fallen before but did you know there's a scripture that says unto him who's able to keep you from falling praise the lord you know david said in pro in psalms he said he will enlarge enlarge your feet so that you're that you won't slip you know enlarge your steps so you won't slip you're not slipping and falling all the time because while you're allowing god to influence you now that you make solid decisions let me raise your hand and say lord help me make solid decisions don't just be given in quickly young people just oh i'm just feeling this i'm feeling this and feeling this in my heart and my heart is twitter baited i know this is the one this is the one grow up a little bit bible says the heart is deceitful above all things brother bradham says look at that girl's background look at that man's background be around the family he said check it out pray about it see if they've got the holy ghost it's a decision-making process that the prophet spoke in this hour helping sons to make solid decisions not like the world ah they'll be fine they fall in love just let them go and this is parents saying this they'll be fine just let them do whatever they want and we fell in love that way and we didn't have a job or a penny to our name and things worked out no i think the boy should have a job if he wants to have a wife and kids he should have a good job i think he should think it through i think he should have a plan i think he should go to jehovah god and say god i need a plan i need a vision a lot of that is accountability so he's influencing us in the in the level of our choices in other words if we're under his preeminence and his influence he could influence us before our choices are made praise the lord how many would say tonight lord influence my choices it's influence was preached seven times and i just noticed in this week while i was listening on my vacation to uh sirs is this the time and if you listen to that you just see the whole transition and brother brahm doesn't even understand all that's taken place he's seeing something this is a big deal that's happening it's a transition going into revelations 5 in revelations 10 and the blast that took place in the dream that scared him thought it was into his life so six dreams in his church by spiritual people and a seventh vision and he says when this happens the lord says when this happens in your front yard when they're tearing it up it's time for you to go west all the dreams they go west go west something didn't even know what was going to happen but somewhere along the line he got influenced by the the service of influence that he preached it he preached at home but then he went straight to phoenix and preached it preached it seven times surrounding this whole thing after the seals and it was about uzziah i'd like to preach a sermon on it sometime uzziah being a godly king doing all the right things raised by godly parents everything was right but except this isaiah the young prophet was under the influence of this godly king too much now you think about that he wasn't under under the influence of some guy working at a restaurant or some uh prostitute or some worldly person at college he was influenced by a godly king that was living godly in doing the right things he was under that influence and yet now because he was under the influence of somebody that then his world falls apart because uzziah failed uzziah gets lifted up in pride and the one he never thought would fail never thought he would leave the message i never dreamed this person would leave the message i'm preaching it tonight so i'm going to go ahead and preach it never never but you see the problem was is that may happen and it's a terrible thing that uzi did it lost everything struck with leprosy sin came in his life i don't know what the rest of the future hold i think he died that way i don't know but the point is is that isaiah had to get an experience in the presence of the lord because he was under the wrong influence and it wasn't the influence of the world it was influenced under a godly king who failed he failed and in his eyes isaiah in his desperation oh god i can't believe this he goes into the temple and finally gets under the right influence that's the presence of the lord i'll tell you young people everyone where we need to be is in the presence of the lord we need to meet with god personally we need to be in this word can you say man we need to be feeding on the message because why we're under the right influence and if you think that you're going to get by as a message believer constantly feeding for hours on your phone with everything that's being said on the internet both naturally and spiritually you're gonna you're gonna somebody's gonna fall in your eyes guess what you could live a holy ghost-filled power packed life and never even look at social media again [Laughter] praise the lord so i'm having a good time tonight i don't know about you but i got a few minutes here so i'm taking my coat off amen it's good to be home i like preaching here more than any other place in the world and that's that's saying a lot because africa was pretty good that was a pretty good place to preach but i like preaching here i know you there's a love for the word here and i i love preaching to my congregation so so now don't we have places in the bible where so now we if he could influence our choices we become accountable to his word and the counsel before decisions are made and isn't there place in the bible where they didn't consult the lord some kings didn't consult the lord and one time the king consulted with the the dignitaries but didn't consult the lord so that i believe that term is in there to consult the lord and they didn't consult the lord first and they didn't consult godly people i think we should live a life accountable that we consult the lord first that we consult godly people who have had experience in things first that's the thing about the body of christ you can always find somebody in the body of christ most times that's already been through something that you're going through already had a victory in it already learned their lesson can you say amen and so we uh we don't enjoy the benefits of that too much because we pass it by and say i'm going to do my own thing and yet in the body there's godly counsel i never understand where you know i understand when peers hang around with the same age but i never understand with some older seasoned people in the church why the young people are afraid to be around them when that's the very ones they need to hang around a little bit that's the people you need to invite yourself over and they'll probably be surprised but they'd love to have you come over hey you know hey can you guys have me over for coffee or dinner if you if you knew that and i just want to come over i'm a single guy and i see a real godliness about your life and so i'm just going to run off things i just like some fellowship and just to just to be mentored a little bit that conversation rarely ever happens but yet god and by his holy spirit provides some in the body who's been seasoned in things and if you're struggling for an answer it may not always come over the pulpit it may come through of the body of christ is that okay with everybody so we become accountable to the word the counsel before decisions are made if we could do that it'd be wonderful consult the lord if i could do that more it would be wonderful consult the lord first and consult godly people who have had experience you talk about having the upper edge on the devil if the bride could come more under his headship christ's headship and the preeminence at the temptation level and yield as brother brandon brandon preached last wednesday night to learn how to yield to the holy spirit to yield so it's about yielding can you say man if the bride could come under his pre preeminence and his headship at the temptation level at the moment of being tempted at the decision-making level and yield and be accountable at that point what an army would raise among us can you say amen there'd be less falling for things and more under the headship of him who can keep you from falling blessed be his name i believe many problems i like to talk about accountability because i believe many problems in churches and believers in homes in young people is a misunderstanding of authority and what being under authority is and being accountable to god's authority and god's delegated authority i think a lot of problems come because of that so i believe in accountability i believe it is a godly thing we can go through scriptures and to see god give us instruction in those things it looks like i won't get to those scriptures tonight maybe next wednesday but we can see in the scripture it's a principle that we need to be accountable can you say ma'am but but you see now it's it's not just that but i want to say this that there is an environment there is a a there is a how should i say it there is a world to itself that that god creates it's his atmosphere and the bible says actually is the atmosphere where angels love to be around in the company of angels they're hanging around those the bible says that fear the lord there's an accompany of angels and in his presence so the people are in the fear of the lord they're worshiping god it brings his presence but angels are there as well that he encamps around those that fear him so there is an atmosphere and we can't see in the other dimension but i can tell you that that presence and that environment is not down at the local bar that environment is not in the white house the bible says that company that environment is around where the words being preached around who had those who have christ in their hearts around the body of christ can you say man it's not going to be in some comic book that you'll get that there is an environment and a presence amen and and to go further in that in that is everything that we need his word his correction how many need correction his blessings his direction and matters and so everything is in that everything is in that environment now i can commit when i'm at home and i have my bible and i really enter into the spirit of and say lord just teach me something here let me take time with it i can enter that i don't have to be in church all of a sudden i'm in that environment and i'm feeding and the lord's speaking to me things you see you come into that presence i'm not going to get that if i'm reading my singing news magazine which i enjoy reading by the way it's all the southern gospel groups and i keep up with them and they don't know me but i know them they know sherry but they don't know me and so i go to a quartet convention i say who who are you i said i'm on paul lafontaine lavon oh sherry's brother so i'm sherry's brother but they don't know me but i know them and so but i'm not going to get any near near reading that so now if i fed on only those things and barely cracked this book through the week what influence am i under and have i come into his presence and am i in the right environment for all the blessings to flow to my life and that's why in this challenging busy time that we have we're going con we're going upstream we're live in laodicea we have all these entertainments we got them all of our phone we got everything else but listen a call to the bride you are going upstream to make a decision to say i've got to be in the presence of the lord i've got to feed on his word i've got to be in the house of god i've got to sit and have alter with my family i need to stay in prayer as often as i can because i'm going upstream here praise the lord and what influence you're under will show up in your attitude in your clothes that you wear in the music that you listen to it'll show up what you're feeding on somebody starts to wear these short skirts and tight skirts you're not under the influence of this message there's no way that you can get that result and be constantly feeding on the word of god it has the right result the lord guides you what to wear but see you're on you're on the internet you're watching this and so now that's what you're feeding on and it's a giveaway because we can see it so it's not just that attitudes spirits come from music there are some spirits that come from even christian music some of it spirits of rebellion spirits of tattoos and spirits of nose rings and everything else right in the christian realm if you're feeding on it then all of a sudden you start to manifest what you're feeding on you think this is the first time a preacher's preached on that this is the principle that's been for six thousand years since man has been on earth from the tower of babel all the way through what you're feeding on you're going to manifest in your body and in your attitude and young people say no not me you know this is different you know no you're not different it's the same principle what you feed on is what you become and i'll tell you more and more god help me to be under the influence of the presence of god his word the body of christ listen friends we're getting ready to get out of here we don't need to be weighted down by some worldly thing we need to shed that stuff and say god make me rapture ready to get out of here arguing about this and wearing this and all that stay in the word of god you'll never have to be told what to do because that word will teach you and tell you what to wear the holy spirit will guide you and we'll know more arguments about it there won't be any more because you're feeding on the right thing if every person would just come under the right influence god would influence them all the way to a rapture we're about to wrap this thing up you think we'll be here much longer i don't believe we will it's time for the bride to trim their lamps be filled with the spirit be feeding on the word of god because everything that you're looking at out there will soon be gone your movie stars and your football teams and your nfl it's all gonna be gone the only thing left standing is gonna be this atmosphere this presence this word this only thing left standing somebody say praise the lord tonight there is an environment and in it is everything that we need correction blessing direction and when we step away from it in rebellion whether physically or mentally we step into independence we step away from accountability to it because there's a certain when you when you come to into that presence there's an accountability that goes with it even the fact that you choose to stay in that presence means that you've chosen a life of accountability because you can't come in it without it calling for a surrender you can't get it unless it it's calling for a surrender this message calls for a complete surrender to jesus christ no no if ands or buts about it and years ago about 10 years ago 15 years ago i can't remember what it was and i've had a couple men say this i come as visitors to stay for a little while and they use the word of comedy they say sitting under this ministry and sitting there after a few weeks there's such a accountability that goes with it they're not used to having to answer to how they treat their wife every day i've been in the message for years that's not important no yeah it is it's in the message but when you come around to somebody who talks about it and preaches it in that presence it's correcting everything you think i can correct it i don't want to correct everything i don't know how to do it but i tell you in the presence of the lord it can it can it can step on all 10 of your toes and you don't even realize it praise the lord it's not me it's the it's the nature of the holy spirit it's a light it's light and if you want to walk in the light nothing is hidden expose it lord but in that presence though it's exposing it's everything that we need so when somebody comes into it and it comes in it's like one of them and he said man it's just i can't go here and a couple of them they just leave that i can't attend there it's just too much too much accountability it's just too much for me they never faced that type of presence where and they think it's condemnation many times it's not condemnation it's conviction it's the light you don't need to be afraid of that praise the lord i've learned to love it i don't love when i get my my hide ripped off by the word i love what brother rap said sunday about the evangelists coming and waking everybody up it's like the parent waking kids up you're not the popular person when you have to be the ones that wake them up i love that because i know as a pastor i'm not the popular person when i'm the one has to wake you up out of your sleep sometimes physicals like sometimes they're sleeping on me physically praise the lord and they wake up you know but that's not it it's waking you up spiritually and you're not the nice guys having to wake you up but it's a good thing somebody wakes you up it's a good thing that you get rebuked it's a good thing the light exposes what's in your life who else in your life besides the word in the voice of the lord exposes the darkness in your life who is the guy at the coffee shop going to expose it no no no it's going to be this atmosphere in the word that's going to love you enough to expose it had a parent come to me and say were you preaching on my kids are you preaching on this said you know you were i think you were i said no no sister i if i address something usually there's three or four or more that it has to be addressed for the church so i try not to personalize it to anybody i try to keep a right attitude that way but i asked her i said her husband i said who in your boy's life right now what who in his life would be a voice of truth to correct them and in some situations they're not listening to the parents so i said who in their life is it their boss is it the the teacher at school who it would be a voice that would be the voice of admonition to them besides the voice of the lord and they said well and i said my next question is do you really want do you really want to discourage do you want to really carnalize what's happening and coddle and say oh my poor son is getting hit on you sure you want to do that because if that's the conviction of the holy spirit you want to leave that alone let god do his work they might feel bad they might get mad at the preacher but that's the voice of the lord amen is this okay with everybody so if we if we're rebellious to accountability in this atmosphere we step into independence instead of accountability it's i do my own thing i've got a right to do my own thing i'm old enough now i don't need to answer to anyone i'm under nobody all this worldly laodicean attitude deeper than that it's living by a principle that as i said last sunday originates and lucifer he wanted to function outside of god's authority and his environment actually lift his kingdom above god's satan's principle is to want to work outside of the authority of god i believe people can believe all the doctrine of this message and still be living by satan's principles of rebellion an independent spirit can never work in the presence of god the church sometimes is full of lone rangers who don't have to answer to anybody in their private life whatsoever but brother bradham taught us the lord wants to be lord of your private life all the doors of your heart are opened and exposed to this king nothing is hidden amen did you notice jonah a few weeks ago did you notice in the story what he ran from he went to tarshish paid his trip to tarshish what was he running from the presence of the lord we think many things when it comes to his presence it's a feeling or something and here it shows the presence of the lord was the word of the lord given to him showing us that there was accountability with the word of the lord that it went through not a feeling not a tingle that's not the presence of the lord when you're hearing the true word to you that is his presence and in that is an accountability it speaks directly to individuals jonah was not at a church nobody was in that he was in the presence as god individually spoke to him and gave him a word to do his presence is tied with his word and with his voice in the garden of eden it was the same way they heard the voice of the lord walking in the cool of the evening and then they when the sin came in they hid themselves from the presence of the lord it's when we step away from that presence in that environment that we start to get in trouble people can sit in church but they've stepped away from it in their minds in their hearts they're not there the rebellion is always already taking them away notice jonah was going along fine and serving the lord he was not an unbeliever brother brahm said nineveh and tarshish did not mean god and sin god called him to nitiva he went to tarshish it didn't mean god and sin it was a choice of doing his will or not jonah doing he was doing fine until he personally came in direct contact with god and from that time the struggle began and the moment he got the word he became responsible for it in other words it called for a total surrender and nothing less as soon as he come in contact with god he had to lose his independent spirit he had to go to nineveh and preach no one else could do it for him only jonah no excuse would work he had to become personally accountable for what god said in the bible we see many different responses to men when they come face to face with god we know jonah ran moses made excuses gideon gave his complexes jether in judges 8 said he was too young to pick up the sword he was too young to serve the lord the rich young ruler said he couldn't go let go of his money and his status king agrippa in acts said i'm not persuaded enough yet so i'm not going to go with you today felix said it's just not a convenient season right now for me to serve the lord luke 14 17 the lord said a bit about the great marriage and the invitation to the marriage and all of them began to make excuses and the excuses were more important than the invitation to the feast to his presence what were the excuses i've purchased a piece of land have me excused i have married a wife please have me excused and so all of these are hesitants running from the presence of the lord running from that contact that he made with you and running from it but take a look at the bible who in the bible who people who took it quickly david said i'll take goliath right now isaiah said hear my lord send me mary said be it unto me according to thy word there wasn't give me a few months to think about it praise the lord i've been in his presence whatever you said let it happen to me right now [Applause] hallelujah the ethiopian eunuch said as he talked to philip and received the word right away they stopped and he said here is water what does hinder let me be baptized right now they acted upon it can you say amen let's do it now he's made contact with you i'm in his presence i'm not afraid of that presence i'm accountable to it can you say amen let it influence my decisions praise the lord for some god calls them and you can come hard or you can come easy but if you're a son of god you're going to come but he gives you something you must become accountable to like you did to jonah and you if you choose your own selfish independent ship to tarshish if you do that go ahead and do it but you're going to get tangled up in a lot of seaweed yes you are yes you are and that's not a pleasant situation if you were there you might say jonah what in the world are you doing paying your trip to tarshish i feel like saying that to some young people sometimes even our own church what in the world are you doing god's speaking why are you dabbling in the things of the world god's speaking to you it's time for a full surrender to him it's time to say i'm all on board i'm going to sell out lock stock and barrel to the lord before you seek a wife before you seek your future before i got to get my future arranged before any of that you met god say god i'm accountable to you that you can influence my future and my decisions is anybody getting something out of this tonight if you come into the lord and you want to be accountable not run away from his atmosphere but run into it and stay around it let the word stay around the word it's the light it's walking in the light that's what i'm talking about tonight it's walking in the light it's walking with nothing hidden it's accountability to the lord and to his body can you say amen i'm come to the church because of a desire to come you know what i i the first reason i'm at church tonight even in any time and looking at the time 8 30. so i'm okay i come to church first of all because i love to come to church it's a desire to hear the word but there is another reason i was thinking about this a few weeks ago i come to church because of a submission to the rest of the body of christ bible says submit ourselves one to another the word says to gather together can you say amen and i come to be submissive to that so that i can encourage other members of the body of christ i don't treat church or his people like i can take them or leave them anytime that i want you say well brother paul you're the pastor you have to be here no i'd be here whether i was pastoring or not because i love the lord and i want to be here i want to be in this atmosphere but also i have a certain accountability to you as another member of the body of christ and i my being here encourages you and you being here encourages me now there's some tonight that's listening that not able to come because of distance and because so far away and the children in school but i'm going to say this to to some of you there's some of you who can make it to church do have enough time to make it and you're not here so you need to examine that you need to pray about that because why do we come it's not just to fulfill a religious duty but our hunger to come but also there's a certain accountability to one another there's a certain submission to one another and my presence encourages you we put our licks to fight and together can you say amen and you being here encourages me i don't want to preach to these chairs these chairs can't say amen these chairs don't have any soul but thank god tonight we can preach to you and on the internet tonight i can preach the ones that have a soul that's saying amen to the word of god [Applause] it's a lot better to preach to that i'll tell you amen i got to find a place to end this we'll pick it up next wednesday or the next time the lord has us preached so now oh i wanted to just can we read this before we get out of here i wanted to read our text in john 3 i want to read that last verse john 3 uh verse 21. so the john 3 16 for god so loved the world we understand but the light has come but look what he said about this is this should seal up what we've been saying here tonight this is it in the amplified verse 21 john 3 21. can you give me two minutes here but whoever practices truth and i don't necessarily like that but coming to truth whoever practices truth and does what's right morally ethically spiritually i think it's deeper than that i think when he says he that doeth truth i believe it's coming to truth in other words like brother brandon preached you're not you're not pitching your tent another direction you're not going the other way you're not even looking the other way you may not be where you're at but you're looking the right way remember he preached that you pitch your tent in the right direction so that the first thing that you look at is the right thing that's going to influence you you see so that's what coming to truth is so this says whoever comes to truth when they come to truth they come to light and so here's the amplified comes to light so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are so that his works so the reason that you come to light and you expose yourself to the light and you're accountable to the light is because you want your works to be plainly shown that they are accomplished in god in other words divinely prompted divinely prompted and done with god's help in dependence on him oh i wish i could preach another hour and that right there you come to light musicians can come you come to light so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are accomplished in god in other words listen now divinely prompted how many want to be divinely prompted how many wants to see things done with god's help you come to the light because the things you're doing is with god's help the decisions you're making are divinely prompted and then it says independence on him you come to the light so that you may divinely be prompted and led and influenced in your decisions every day and that's showing your dependence on him you're not an independent creature who gives yourself permission to act any way you want to you are submissive to the presence of god i'm not an independent that just you know i i do all right in church but i do my own thing i say my own thing i act the way i want to out of church no you're coming to light you're carrying that light lord i want to be in that i want to be exposed can you say amen i want to be divinely prompted for the decisions i make every day and i don't want to act independently without the accountability to the word and also god but also god with skin on some people say i don't need anybody nobody needs to correct me i do my own thing i just serve the lord god i serve the lord god you need to read the book of james you don't bless god and curse men god can work through his people god himself is living in his people and you can't say i just be alone with god i'm going to go out in the smoky mountains and i don't need anybody and it's nice to rest like that but if you were going to move out there i i couldn't move out there as much as my i'd love to move out there but i couldn't do it because i do away from the body of christ you see so that would not i know that wouldn't be the will of god for me to do even brother branham tried to do it i'm leaving i'm going up there with my family leaving his ministry all that he said no no and brother god show brother you do this and this is how you end up a bum remember he showed him that so you could do it he had a right to do it but he said no no i'm going to stay in the calling stake even stay around the work of the lord get up to the smokies once a year to rest when the mountains are calling but listen for the most part i'm living life accountable to the body of christ because when i need correction when i need influence that's the influence i want to be underneath not social media not all kinds of preachers friends we ought to be thankful for the message of the hour i there was a tv down there and i was watching jesse duplantis i'll just say his name he was up in his pulpit telling some dream he had of heaven i tell you it was it was absolute heresy it was absolute deceiving the people there isn't anything scriptural about that dream about heaven and you know all those people believing i said god what is this coming to deceiving hearts and i tell you i'm not speaking against him personally but i'm just saying we ought to be thankful for the balanced word of god by the holy ghost preached through ministers with no agenda no money making schemes i'm not here tonight so i can get a new private plane that's what he preaches for to get his next private plane listen thank god we don't have to deal with that trash we have an authority and a power of god and a presence and environment to bring our families underneath in submission and in that in the body in that atmosphere stay as close to it as you can because in that you'll find every need every direction every leadership is going to be right there besides that it'll take you to a rapture someday let's stand together tonight praise the lord i will walk in the light kiev see brother kenny a little bit higher i think i'm sorry beauty for life walk where two drops of mercy [Music] shine all around us by day by night oh jesus the light of i'm gonna just raise your hand say i wanna just i wanna walk in that and be in that light all the time we'll walk in the light drive all darkness away beautiful light walk where the dew drops shine all [Applause] [Music] jesus the light of one more time tell him now we'll walk in the light [Music] lord jesus walk in light lord [Music] we're divinely prompted lord leadership in that light lord drive every darkness away oh shine oh [Music] jesus the light of just pray a closing prayer here brother brandon spoke last week and walking in the spirit and now we're here saying help us lord to walk in the light where all darkness is driven away what a wonderful thing to come to the light to stay in the light around the word of the hour feeding on it for a believer it's everywhere in his life it's most of his phone time it's mostly where he's at mostly the people of god are the ones we want to be around more than any other people his works and his decisions are divinely prompted because he's walking in the light ephesians 5 8 says for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light heavenly father we come to the close of our service tonight [Music] lord we know what that shining is and that brightness lord [Music] we know what it is lord when there's some dark spots and we and you expose them lord yet lord we feel corrected but we feel loved and we feel you've chastened us we could just learn lord to pull away from other things and live in that a little bit more more and more and more to stay in the word to feed on the message to feed on the word and sustain that atmosphere and to stay in that light as often as we have chances to do we're working upstream as it were to the laodicean lazy spirit that's around us lukewarm working against it saying i want to spend time with my lord today and feed on his word i got about an hour here before work or after work or just before i go to sleep lord can you give me something in your word let me just feed on it but when we do that you give divine prompting of our decisions and you give leadership you influence us because we've chosen to be under your influence rather than the influences of others help us tonight heed these things and walk in them lord with all of our heart we just dismiss the service now in the name of the lord jesus christ take the people safely to their homes we pray and we're thankful for this time we've had together bless those listening also our precious saints part of this assembly listening different places i trust they were fed tonight i trust they were led by the holy spirit you feed your flock lord thank you father in jesus name amen everybody said amen god bless you love you all appreciate you welcome to worship or be dismissed i know you got to get the children ready for school so we understand that god bless you each one drive safely don't forget out here just to make
