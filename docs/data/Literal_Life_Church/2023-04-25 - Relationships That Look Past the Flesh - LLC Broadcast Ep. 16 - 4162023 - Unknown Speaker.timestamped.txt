[4:02] I've gotta go
[4:05] now for a little
[4:15] [Music]
[4:21] second Corinthians chapter five
[4:23] and we'll read together starting at
[4:25] verse 14.
[4:28] For the Love of Christ constraineth us
[4:31] that means the love of Christ controls
[4:33] and compels us
[4:35] how many Barnaby compelled by the love
[4:37] of Christ
[4:39] the love of Christ constraineth us
[4:41] because we thus judge that if one died
[4:43] for all then we're all dead and that he
[4:47] died for all that they which live
[4:50] should from should not henceforth live
[4:53] unto themselves but unto him which died
[4:56] for them and rose again wherefore
[4:58] henceforth know we no man after the
[5:02] flesh ye though we know have known
[5:04] Christ after the flesh yet now
[5:06] henceforth know we him no more so we
[5:08] don't know Christ and the flesh Christ
[5:10] is not in his own flesh of 2000 years
[5:13] ago here today we don't know him that
[5:15] way but we know him by revelation we
[5:17] know he's real we know he's a person
[5:19] he's just as real the only part that's
[5:22] missing he's not in his flesh he
[5:24] fulfilled those days for a certain time
[5:26] I believe it was three and a half years
[5:29] of ministry at 33 years on Earth so we
[5:31] don't know him we never knew Christ in
[5:33] that flesh body we will see him someday
[5:35] but we don't know him but we know him by
[5:38] Revelation can you say Amen but also
[5:41] Paul's teaching us that from henceforth
[5:43] we know no man in other words we don't
[5:45] look at one another by the flesh as
[5:47] Christians we're not viewing one another
[5:49] by the flesh by but by the seed that's
[5:53] on the inside the Christ that's inside
[5:55] someone and you say well I know people
[5:58] they don't have Christ but always always
[6:00] the potential is there that they're a
[6:02] seed that's not been dramatized yet so
[6:05] even with an unbeliever we're always
[6:07] praying and looking at them through eyes
[6:10] of Christ to say is the potential there
[6:13] you see so and and how many knows that's
[6:15] the way God looked at us it's a good
[6:17] thing some of you in the world some of
[6:19] you out there and I mean you know you're
[6:21] the least likely to receive this and yet
[6:24] you're here today hungry for the word of
[6:25] God somebody looked at you beyond your
[6:28] faults
[6:29] and saw your need and somebody seen that
[6:31] you were seen of God and God was the
[6:33] first one that looked at you that way if
[6:35] God looks at that us that way then we
[6:37] have to look at one another that way now
[6:39] I want to add in a scripture back in the
[6:41] Book of Romans just one scripture
[6:43] and Paul says something here
[6:46] um that adds in with the Str the subject
[6:49] this morning and I just want to
[6:51] title this relationships I've been
[6:53] speaking on relationships relationships
[6:56] that look past the flesh relationships
[6:59] that look past the Flesh and Paul says
[7:02] Romans 7 and verse
[7:05] 18. now he's talking about himself
[7:08] for I know Paul's talking about himself
[7:11] for I know that in me that is in my
[7:14] flesh dwelleth no good thing
[7:18] for to will is present with you but how
[7:20] to perform that which is good I find not
[7:23] and so I want you to just remember the
[7:25] first part there this is a prophet
[7:29] how many believe Paul was a prophet and
[7:32] the prophet says about himself not the
[7:35] self that's the part of Christ but he
[7:37] says I know and this is almost a
[7:40] revelation that you have to have about
[7:42] yourself first and others I know
[7:45] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[7:48] no good thing
[7:51] that's a prophet talking
[7:53] so how much confidence should we put in
[7:55] the flesh
[7:56] if there's no good thing it's nothing we
[7:59] can offer to God it's a it's a mess can
[8:01] you say the only hope that the flesh has
[8:03] is that you have the Holy Ghost
[8:04] controlling the Flesh and bringing it
[8:06] under subjection but in it in itself
[8:09] there's no good thing in it even a
[8:10] prophet of God and if he said that about
[8:12] himself then certainly if he was a
[8:15] prophet and there was no good in his
[8:16] flesh there's certainly no good in our
[8:18] flesh whatsoever amen it's only through
[8:20] Christ that anything good can come out
[8:23] of us amen and so I I want to go into
[8:26] how much we still look at the flesh
[8:29] relationship because if we're only
[8:32] fleshly driven for example if a husband
[8:35] only looks at a wife and her weaknesses
[8:37] and he begins to dishonor her and only
[8:40] views her according to the flesh he will
[8:42] become disappointed he will be angry he
[8:44] will be upset if a wife looks at her
[8:46] husband only according to his fleshly
[8:48] ways or just the way that he is she will
[8:51] become disappointed and guess what
[8:52] happens the relationship starts to get
[8:54] broken because you lose honor for what
[8:57] you really are a lot of a lot of times
[8:59] marriages just lose their original
[9:01] romance they lose their original
[9:03] attraction to one another because why
[9:05] for years you look at the Flesh and you
[9:07] know the flesh now and the flesh begins
[9:10] to to smother out the way that you
[9:13] should look at one another amen and it
[9:15] goes in churches as well is that if you
[9:17] only look at the Flesh of your
[9:19] congregation or your church if you keep
[9:21] viewing things if you look at your
[9:22] pastor only by the flesh then that will
[9:25] be smothering out what his position
[9:26] really is who he is as the Son of God a
[9:29] pastor can't help you and more if you
[9:31] only view him by the flesh a
[9:34] congregation cannot help you anymore if
[9:36] you only look at all the Flesh of the
[9:37] people and all their quirks and all
[9:39] their personality differences and all
[9:41] the things that irritate you
[9:43] and I'm going to show at the end some
[9:46] examples in Jesus
[9:48] showing the contrast in himself because
[9:50] when Jesus came of course seems the
[9:52] perfect Son of God and he began to be
[9:54] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[9:56] was the The Mystery of what God wanted
[9:59] to express through man he was the first
[10:01] time we began to see what God looks like
[10:04] in flesh because we'd never seen it in
[10:06] its fullness before Jesus was Christ the
[10:09] mystery it was the mystery of God
[10:11] revealed we never got to see what God
[10:13] would look like in flesh until Jesus
[10:16] came on the scene we finally get to see
[10:17] what does God look like in flesh and
[10:20] when he began that he began a whole
[10:22] Kingdom of Sons and Daughters of God who
[10:24] would be in the flesh who would be in
[10:26] sinborn bodies who would be born of sin
[10:29] shaped in iniquity saved filled with the
[10:31] Holy Ghost and then with the Holy Ghost
[10:34] they still live in their flesh in other
[10:36] words they still have the potential to
[10:38] walk in the flesh instead of the spirit
[10:42] and with all of that because of the
[10:44] perfect example of Jesus Christ he came
[10:47] into viewing and seeing things by by a
[10:51] vision by the righteousness of God in
[10:53] other words Jesus was viewing everybody
[10:56] he's seen not through the lens of Flesh
[10:59] because there's some people that came to
[11:01] him if he had been looking at the flesh
[11:02] he would have never given them the hope
[11:04] of what God could bring to them but
[11:07] because he was looking beyond the flesh
[11:09] he knew and he could see whether they
[11:11] were a seed of God or not he could see
[11:13] whether they are a god of God nobody
[11:14] else they were looking at the woman at
[11:16] the well nobody else could see she was a
[11:18] daughter of God but because Jesus was
[11:20] not looking at the flesh he could look
[11:22] inside and see there's a Seedling there
[11:24] this is the daughter of God if Jesus did
[11:27] that then we have to do it as well
[11:32] I'm talking about relationships I'm
[11:34] talking about growing into Christ's
[11:36] likeness and how we view things so at
[11:38] the end if I get to it and I want to I
[11:41] want to show a contrast between how
[11:43] Jesus was seeing things and how the
[11:45] Pharisees were viewing things because
[11:47] the most religious people on the face of
[11:50] the earth viewed everything according
[11:54] to the flesh
[11:56] and when somebody didn't line up
[11:59] their only answer was is that if they
[12:02] need to line up with a with the law they
[12:04] need to line up with the law they need
[12:05] to lie because they were all about
[12:07] appearance they were all about flesh
[12:08] this person's flesh is the myth and
[12:10] their only hope is to get under our
[12:11] religion and line up with all the do's
[12:13] and don'ts and then we'll be happy then
[12:15] they'll be right they had no vision for
[12:18] the righteousness of God they had no
[12:20] vision for the seed of God they're the
[12:22] daughters of God that this did not come
[12:24] by a law but it came by the spirit of
[12:26] Life coming in an individual and
[12:28] changing their lives transforming their
[12:31] lives
[12:33] so let's not put it on the Pharisees
[12:35] let's say how much do us sometimes look
[12:38] religiously like the Pharisees and view
[12:40] everything according to how we see in
[12:44] the flesh
[12:46] I'm believing that this series would
[12:49] help
[12:50] build stronger marriages
[12:52] build stronger Church build stronger
[12:55] relationship with with children and
[12:57] parents that's my prayer in this series
[12:59] because once we understand God's Oneness
[13:03] and God's glory coming in us will never
[13:05] view things the same we're looking for
[13:08] God's glory in the next individual let's
[13:10] just take a quick look at how God viewed
[13:13] Eve before the fall and I particularly
[13:15] mention Eve because we know that he
[13:17] created man a spirit man he was created
[13:19] in the image of God so he was a spirit
[13:21] man first before he was a flesh man and
[13:24] I keep repeating these things because I
[13:26] want everybody to understand include
[13:28] including the children when God created
[13:30] a man he says I create him in my own
[13:31] image and so God was a spirit so the
[13:33] first man Adam uh Adam created was not a
[13:37] body like you see it was a spirit man
[13:38] like God then the next thing in Genesis
[13:41] 2 then he takes that he breathes life
[13:43] into a vessel and Adam had a had a body
[13:46] now so he took that and he put it in
[13:48] there and so then in that body was both
[13:51] masculine and feminine Eve was inside of
[13:53] him so then after and then later on in
[13:55] the chapter God takes the next step and
[13:58] listen now when he takes Eve out of from
[14:01] the rib of Adam but now we have a
[14:03] byproduct off of Adam made from Adam
[14:06] with a different vessel and he puts that
[14:08] feminist part in that different vessel
[14:10] which means that she would be different
[14:12] she would think about things different
[14:14] she would look at life a bit different
[14:16] yet even though she's different they'd
[14:19] still be one
[14:20] so there had to be honor and distract
[14:22] and that respect and that's what Adam
[14:24] had so now when he brings that vessel
[14:26] out the way God viewed them in just
[14:29] before the fall God viewed when he
[14:32] looked at Adam and Eve there in two
[14:34] different vessels
[14:35] we know that when he created Adam he
[14:38] created his Masterpiece he created the
[14:40] animals he brought all these things on
[14:42] the earth of the world but when he got
[14:44] to Adam was God's Masterpiece and one
[14:48] day Michelangelo I'm just telling this
[14:50] for those who don't know one day
[14:51] Michelangelo creating that that uh that
[14:55] statue of Moses and one day it just
[14:57] becomes so perfect and so real to him
[15:00] and he just strikes it with one of his
[15:02] tools he said speak he was so inspired
[15:04] that it was so real he strikes it and
[15:07] then there was a flaw in the Masterpiece
[15:08] that it was the flaw in the Masterpiece
[15:11] that actually made it a masterpiece
[15:16] now we don't think that way we think if
[15:20] there's a flaw
[15:22] we're looking at the flesh
[15:24] but even with the flaw and that's when
[15:27] he brought Christ was God's Masterpiece
[15:30] he was perfect but then at Calvary it
[15:32] was like Michelangelo took that that
[15:34] Spirit the soldier took the spear and
[15:36] pierced him and he made a fall and water
[15:38] and blood came out and now the
[15:40] Masterpiece is flawed can you say Amen
[15:42] but that which came out of him actually
[15:44] made it the Masterpiece to make up a
[15:46] bride so God calls his bride Masterpiece
[15:48] it doesn't matter that she's a byproduct
[15:51] she's received the spirit of God and God
[15:53] says that's actually what makes her the
[15:55] Masterpiece what are you saying
[15:57] Redemption is powerful enough to take
[16:00] someone from the myri clay it's actually
[16:03] more powerful to take somebody that's
[16:05] flawed and born in sin shaped in
[16:07] iniquity and raised them up and that
[16:09] flaw that flaw God raises it to
[16:12] Redemption and he says when I look at
[16:14] her I look past the flaw and I see a
[16:17] masterpiece
[16:20] that's great to talk about that about
[16:22] Christ and his bride
[16:24] but what about relationships
[16:27] if God were to keep looking at flaws
[16:31] that it doesn't look like much a
[16:32] masterpiece does it
[16:35] hard to conclude that this is a
[16:37] masterpiece and so he looked at it that
[16:39] way before the fall
[16:41] and I want you to notice something about
[16:44] uh
[16:46] Eve
[16:47] when God looked
[16:50] at even that different gospel before the
[16:52] fall
[16:54] being a byproduct
[16:57] she had within her the potential
[17:00] to leave the word
[17:04] she had within her the weakness which we
[17:08] know now she did she left the word she
[17:12] fell and left the word and that's how
[17:14] every all of humanity fell but when God
[17:17] looked at her he knew even that she had
[17:20] something within her that could leave
[17:22] the word that could make a mistake
[17:26] and God still he's looking at her with
[17:30] Adam
[17:31] one with Adam
[17:33] this is still my masterpiece boy but
[17:36] without the new birth you're capable of
[17:39] doing anything in your flesh
[17:42] capable of taking drugs capable of
[17:45] beingcoming addicted today this is the
[17:47] addictive generation addicted to
[17:49] everything can you say Matt you're
[17:50] capable that's why we have millions
[17:52] falling to addiction they don't have
[17:54] Christ they go for an alternative I got
[17:56] to get some relief so I'm going to take
[17:57] drugs to get high and feel a relief
[17:59] everybody's turning to Alternatives
[18:00] because this generation is just about
[18:02] completely dead and gone insane because
[18:05] it's without the Lord without any hope
[18:07] can you say Amen without without
[18:09] anything some substance of them to
[18:11] change them thank God for Christ today
[18:14] thank God that we have a token thank God
[18:18] that we have the power of the Cross to
[18:21] change our lives and offer it to someone
[18:23] else without it there is no hope
[18:25] we're in moral failure in this country
[18:29] and we have spirits that are taking over
[18:30] I said wow can you
[18:33] that's a spirit wow somebody calls it a
[18:36] spirit
[18:37] and we have a moral failure in our
[18:39] country
[18:40] we have a moral crisis
[18:42] you're not going to hear very much of
[18:44] that when you hear it you ought to say
[18:45] Amen
[18:47] we're not going to bring back this world
[18:48] it's headed for tribulation we have the
[18:51] access to the Holy Ghost how many
[18:52] believe we still have access to the
[18:54] Cross to the power of cross we better be
[18:57] crying out to God for our children we
[18:59] better be crying to God for deliverance
[19:00] in our whole life we better be crying
[19:02] out for a personal Revival in our lives
[19:04] how many will say I commit myself to a
[19:06] personal Revival in my own life we need
[19:09] God more than we've ever need them
[19:10] before
[19:15] the Masterpiece became
[19:18] flawed and even with that even after the
[19:21] fall when God started to you know what
[19:23] even after the fall
[19:25] and Men fell and they lost their glory
[19:27] of God and they lost their Fellowship
[19:29] then God God began to build a nation
[19:32] with Abraham
[19:33] and when he began to build a nation with
[19:36] Abraham he began to look at them as
[19:39] their potential because remember I said
[19:40] you have the potential without the new
[19:42] birth of doing the worst staple things
[19:44] oh as a good person there's a good
[19:46] people praise the Lord you know I thank
[19:47] God for good people but without the new
[19:49] birth
[19:52] all the good that they do they have
[19:54] resident within their flesh the
[19:57] potential to do the most dastardly
[19:59] things
[20:01] dastardly is that a word I don't know
[20:04] they have and you have that this morning
[20:09] you have it within you
[20:11] and you know what
[20:13] I think killing somebody's influence is
[20:15] worse than killing somebody physically
[20:18] it's the same spirit
[20:20] but you'll do it because without
[20:22] something to bring that in control you
[20:25] go without down all those directions but
[20:27] when he began to build a nation in
[20:28] Abraham
[20:29] he began to look at them now here's
[20:31] here's we see you have the potential for
[20:33] evil
[20:34] but when you when God looks at you he
[20:37] begins to see the potential by his grace
[20:40] and he began to see the potential of his
[20:42] people and when he's seen the flaws he
[20:45] still called it a masterpiece in the
[20:47] beginning the fall made it the
[20:48] Masterpiece because the Redemption power
[20:51] of God is stronger than the flaw let me
[20:53] say it again why does God look at us he
[20:56] can see who we are in our potential and
[20:59] God can look past the fall because he
[21:02] knows the power of redemption will
[21:05] always be greater than the flaw
[21:08] there's no way that we can have Oneness
[21:12] true Oneness if we view each other
[21:15] according to the flesh
[21:18] would never come to it
[21:20] and I said something last Sunday that
[21:22] we're all so used to looking at people
[21:24] by the flesh
[21:26] we've had 6 000 years of only seeing the
[21:29] Flesh and we're actually taught to view
[21:31] and judge a person by what we see
[21:37] we actually bestow honor
[21:40] in the wrong places and we lift up the
[21:42] rich ones we lift up the highly gifted
[21:44] ones the highly gifted people get more
[21:47] praise become our become
[21:50] celebrities
[21:52] it's just how we're taught you know
[21:53] there's there's people that get more
[21:55] honor and then people that don't have
[21:56] the greatest gifts and they don't have
[21:59] a lot of money or they don't they're not
[22:01] successful in in what the world says we
[22:04] tend to okay they're they're okay but
[22:06] these are the real people that get more
[22:07] of our honor that's the same because
[22:09] Paul taught us in the body of Christ
[22:12] in in your Bible he taught in the body
[22:14] of Christ he said the ones that seem
[22:17] least likely
[22:19] the Lesser ones the parts of the body
[22:22] that are not seen
[22:24] and don't have that great of a function
[22:25] he said but they're essential to the
[22:27] body
[22:28] that's how the body of Christ functions
[22:30] but the world has taught us we lift up
[22:32] the wrong ones we praise
[22:34] certain ones Superstars movie stars and
[22:38] and then we put down others
[22:40] and this run writer a Christian writer
[22:42] Colin Smith he was talking about the
[22:45] scripture second Corinthians 5 what does
[22:47] it mean to regard someone according to
[22:48] the flesh
[22:50] from here from from now on regard no one
[22:52] according to the flesh
[22:55] and uh
[22:56] it's he says he quotes from first Samuel
[23:00] man looks at the outward appearance but
[23:03] God looks at the heart
[23:05] is natural for us to form Impressions
[23:07] from the most obvious things about other
[23:09] people and so then he he mentions some
[23:12] things here that I'm just going to use
[23:13] the ten things this is how we judge
[23:15] according to the flesh number one we
[23:17] judge by appearance how many would say
[23:19] that's true we we have been taught to
[23:22] judge people by their appearance and
[23:24] that can go from uh you know uh just are
[23:28] they ugly are they good looking
[23:31] um are they wearing the right clothes
[23:32] are they not wearing the right clothes
[23:35] um it can be I don't want to spend a lot
[23:37] of time because you know we but we judge
[23:39] we categorize we put someone in a place
[23:42] based upon their appearance and that's
[23:45] judging according to the flesh
[23:47] number two we judge according to ability
[23:51] gifts talents abilities that each of us
[23:54] has we're gifted in different ways
[23:56] uh in sports in arts in music and so
[23:59] that we live in a world that's just how
[24:02] good are they in this how much have they
[24:03] excelled in this and I think all of us
[24:05] should excel in our different things
[24:08] that God has given us and gifts but I
[24:10] think we should do it to the glory of
[24:11] God
[24:12] our musicians are always probing to get
[24:14] better and better but it's not to show
[24:15] off it's the Bible says to play
[24:17] skillfully upon the instruments we judge
[24:20] people according to age
[24:22] Paul says to Timothy let no man despise
[24:25] your youth so we look down on ones that
[24:27] are younger sometimes oh and then we
[24:29] look at down on the older the Our
[24:31] Generation actually looks down on the
[24:33] gray-haired older people and won't take
[24:35] wisdom from them I think that's a shame
[24:37] I think the Bible teaches otherwise that
[24:40] the young people should be hanging
[24:42] around the older people to get some of
[24:43] their wisdom I think Young mothers
[24:45] should ask the mothers who raise your
[24:47] children how can you help me I've got
[24:49] this child that's doing this have you
[24:51] been through this and you'll find
[24:52] mothers in the church yeah I've been
[24:53] through that been there done that got
[24:55] the T-shirt
[24:57] but the young mothers are too proud to
[24:59] ask the older ones and I think that's
[25:00] sad there's a lot of wisdom there
[25:03] but we live in a Young Generation that
[25:04] we don't need the older ones we're just
[25:06] going to we're going to do our own thing
[25:07] I think that's not scriptural but we
[25:08] judge people according to their age
[25:10] where they're at you know they're
[25:12] they're less if they're older and they
[25:14] have that gray hair the Bible speaks
[25:16] different we judge people based upon the
[25:18] friends that they keep the associates
[25:20] they keep
[25:21] we judge people based upon race how many
[25:24] know we judge people according to their
[25:25] rates we we have had uh uh distinctions
[25:29] in that and divisions that have come it
[25:32] was in the Bible between Jews and
[25:34] Gentiles they're judging according to
[25:35] race and different things we judge
[25:37] people according to gender
[25:39] God has made us male and female and he
[25:42] distinguishes the difference in male and
[25:44] female
[25:46] we judge people according to their work
[25:48] what's their work what's education
[25:49] what's their business what's their
[25:50] health we look down on them if they
[25:52] don't have an education what's that what
[25:54] are they doing their work are they
[25:55] successful when they work we judge
[25:56] people according to their home the the
[25:58] people the car that they drive the
[26:00] vacations that they go to the
[26:01] restaurants they frequent we judge
[26:03] people according to that the communities
[26:04] they're a part of we judge people
[26:06] according to their family and the of
[26:08] origin where they come from did they
[26:09] have a popular family do they have a
[26:11] family that's not popular
[26:13] and all these things and then he says we
[26:16] judge people by experience
[26:19] our experiences shaped us not only by
[26:21] genes but also the environment and so we
[26:23] come as a product of our environment
[26:25] that we grew up in the only thing that
[26:26] corrects the bad part of our history you
[26:29] might have a line of Alcoholics you
[26:32] might have a line of someone that's
[26:33] given to depression the only thing that
[26:35] corrects it is the Lord's power from
[26:37] Calvary can you say Amen
[26:40] how many can raise your hand and say
[26:42] that God has broken the cycle of a
[26:45] family history through the power of the
[26:46] Cross you're sitting here today he broke
[26:48] the cycle
[26:50] amen sometimes it takes years but God
[26:52] says I have power I can break that cycle
[26:54] and your future is going to be much
[26:56] better than your past
[26:57] amen but we judge people according to
[27:01] their families
[27:03] and are they this and are they that and
[27:05] we judge all these things and I could
[27:07] reflect on this but he goes into another
[27:09] part he says Christ changes how you see
[27:13] others and I agree with them
[27:15] it's Christ that changes how you view
[27:19] others
[27:20] and we don't view according to the flesh
[27:22] but something much much deeper and then
[27:25] the real Revelation comes is we see how
[27:28] Christ sees us
[27:30] because when we see how Christ sees us
[27:33] then we can look at others if you judge
[27:35] yourself according to the flesh either
[27:38] you will always be looking down on
[27:40] others because you see yourself as
[27:42] having more going for you than they do
[27:45] or you will always be losing heart
[27:47] because others have more gifts and more
[27:49] talents and more advantages and more
[27:52] opportunities than you and he ends it by
[27:55] saying and I am in harmony with what he
[27:56] says here
[27:58] when Jesus Christ is your Sovereign Lord
[28:01] what he thinks of you is first and
[28:04] ultimately the only thing that really
[28:06] matters thank you for watching our
