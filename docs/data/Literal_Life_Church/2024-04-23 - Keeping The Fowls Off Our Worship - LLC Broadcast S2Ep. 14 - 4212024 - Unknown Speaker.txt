========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul Le Fontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today I am weak but Thou Art strong [Music] Jesus keep me from all wrong I'll be Satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to thee [Music] just a closer walk with the gr Jesus is [Music] my walking close to the let it be dear Lord let it [Music] be through this world of toils and [Music] snares if I falter Lord who cares and who o with me my burdens bear oh none but thee dear Lord none but thee sing it with us just a g to walk with [Music] the Jesus is my D walking close to thee let it be dear Lord let it be just closer just a closer walk just a closer walk just a closer [Music] closer walking close to me let it be dear Lord let it it be let it be dear Lord let it be let it be minds and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er of the chaes to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a haer of 3 years old and a she goat of 3 years old and a ram of 3 years old and a turtle dove and young pigeon and he took unto them all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the sacrifice or the carcasses Abram drove them away so it's God God is course coming to Abraham in this incident in Genesis 15 to reconfirm his promise that he gave him he's coming to confirm to him the the Covenant that he gave him the promise he gave him so it's reconfirming or confirming the Covenant that he has with Abraham and as you study it you realize this is not a covenant that is making a deal with Abraham that Abraham if you'll do this I'll do this this is an unconditional Covenant and you see God taking care of and doing it all and it's an unconditional it does it's not based upon the actions or perform performance of Abraham it's a different Covenant at the beginning God made a the adamant Covenant was he said you do this and and and this and this and so then man failed in that and we always fail when we're making deals with God man is always the one that fails you don't want to make a deal you don't want to want to be careful of promises that you make can you say amen I think promises are good but we want to make sure with God that in our human weakness sometimes we make a promise but the thing is I'm glad to be under an unconditional Covenant tonight with my God a covenant that says I have done it I have paved the way I have made the way for you and if you'll yield yourself to me I've I've got this journey from your beginning all the way till the end I will finish it for you and so God is coming to Abraham to confirm this Covenant but he does it in a very strange way uh but as he does it it reveals so much about where we are at in the people of God right now because we're at the very end of the RO Royal Seed of Abraham finishing up this journey Abraham began the journey and his Royal seed will finish the journey and if we're not the at the end I'm just crazy I don't understand we are at the end we are at the final generation uh and the final expression of the royal Seed of Abraham and I believe I'm preaching to some of those here tonight that's a pretty important time to be in and so when we go into the idea of Abram uh Shing these fowls away on Sunday we just begin to bring break into this idea of the sacrifice being there and Abram chewing off the fouls and keeping the foul birds away from the sacrifice God laid out a perfect sacrifice before him and uh and and he gave Abraham the specifics of a a perfect sacrifice that God would accept and and to and to lay Abraham to lay his life in worship before that it was a perfect sacrifice Abraham in his reconfirmation here God has him lay out these three animals and these the turtle dove and the pigeon and it all represents Christ it all represents something and I'm going to read it to you in a minute what it means it all means Christ but he lays out the perfect sacrifice he splits the three animals and he lays them a certain way and Abraham is standing in front of a perfect sacrifice now it's not a perfect atonement for his sins but before Calvary came it's the sacrifice that's God's going to accept now if you mess with that sacrifice you're tampering with God's perfect atonement and sacrifice but if you leave it alone that is going to be your answer you worship under that blood can you say amen and if you'll stay there and worship under that blood God's going to finish the the promise and we see then that as people of God come to the real uh reality of what the atonement has done for us and how perfect our sacrifice and how the the the worshipper doesn't have to be perfect but the sacrifice has to be perfect when we start learning that then we realize we release our s in a rest and a worship to God like we've never had before right during our time Satan's fowls are trying to mess with our atonement and when he does it contain our worship that our worship is not pure because he's tainted our sacrifice he's added to it he's taken away from it and that's a pretty uh when we add to something or we take away let's just let talk about our sacrifice let's talk about what God did for us when we add to it or we take away from it that's a serious thing it's perfect when in itself is it not it's perfect when in itself and so the last scripture in the Bible says whoever takes one word of this out or adds one to that's the last warning you know what he saying the last warning the last warning of the Bible must be pretty serious whoever takes out of this or puts in will have his name taken off the book of life that's pretty serious in other words he's saying don't touch this don't touch it leave it alone believe it but don't touch it don't add to it don't add your Works to it don't take away from it don't loosen it up don't loosen up the gospel don't add to the gospel leave it alone and let it do its powerful work in your life keep it simple keep it uncomplicated leave it alone let God take it and put it in our lives the way he wants to you know it's when we have the right thing before us and worshiping under the right thing is when we have the greatest forces trying to mix it trying to taint it trying to distract us away from it let me say it again it's when you have the right thing the right sacrifice the right word is when the devil's trying to fight so hard against it okay he's trying to taint it he when we have the right worship with the right sacrifice and it's and it's the the the sacrifice and the power of it the word is changing us and when it changes us then we get stimulation a revelation and we raise our hands in worship and we we're in freedom of worship I'm worshiping under the right thing the blood of Jesus Christ purely not anything added to it or taking it away no wonder Satan hates that and tries to taint worship and taint the sacrifice to mix it to taint it to take pieces of the word and splice it together or not read the rest of it or not get a balance of it or only use the parts that maybe endorse our background we should pray and keep it balanced and Cast Away influences to bind up our worship and to scare us and to pervert a pure atonement that he gave us to worship under that's right praise the Lord I like when people worship free and I don't mean that they can just be free as far as physically worshiping they're free down here they're free in their Spirit their emotions have been delivered from the bondage of Satan that's why they can shout they can cry they can raise their hand there's nothing binding them because everything's Unbound in here can somebody give me an amen tonight it's not just you physically do it but something has set you free in your spirit something has set you free in your soul I know what a soul freedom feels like I'm not bound by religion I'm not bound by dos and don'ts but there's a rest there's a Sabbath in my soul I know where I stand with God and when I come before him if I have a mistake I bring it quickly under the the blood of Jesus Christ and go right back to raising my hands and worshiping God I came across a sermon by Spurgeon and I referred to it uh Spurgeon the Charles Spurgeon the prince of preachers and he he uh he takes this scripture Genesis 15 and verse 11 and he takes it uh uh quite uh in a more practical way and I just can't get by without bringing out some of his points from it to help us a little bit and the way he takes it is that he looks at the interruptions from our thought life that interrupt our worship how many knows that can take place it's kind of a good place to start let's start with our thoughts the part that nobody can see the part that you can hide from everybody you may have traveled tonight and taken several trips in the last 30 minutes while I've been preaching your mind could have exited here and went to many other things even while you're physically sitting in front of me saying amen every now and then because that's the power of your thoughts and I think it's important maybe to talk about this first because you can talk about all other worship and all other things but he says when we come to worship and he's particularly going to hone in on Sundays because 150 years ago that was the thing that's what you did on Sundays you come to worship so he really goes into the distractions in our mind to the fouls that come around to interrupt our worship even when we come in church and come to service he he really elaborates on the fouls that come in our minds and the thoughts and uh I'll tell you sometimes I hear Spurgeon say things 150 years ago and I'm saying wow the devil's still the same today we're still fighting the same devil he was dead on on some things and he's a real Pastor you can tell he's a real Pastor too because he's seen so much The Human Side of the people and yet pointing him to Christ all the time and and so now he takes interruptions in our thoughts into our worship especially when we're sitting in church and also not giving one day a week Sunday to undistracted worship that was a big deal so he speaking on not giving one day a week Sunday uh giving it un giv it to undistracted worship and so I want to touch on what he says we might use this text he said uh Genesis 15:11 everybody still with me he said we might use this text if we chose as a picture of the ease which with faith repels all attacks that are made upon Christ the fouls rushing them away from the sacrifice the great sacrifice of the New Covenant answorth tells us that the original word word which we translate drove he drove them away has in it the force of puffed them away as if a a very puff of breath these Kites and vultures and Eagles where he uses Eagles were at Once Driven away from the bodies of the victims Faith knows how when skeptical kites when Blasphemous vultures when speculative speculative birds come down to attack the sacrifice of Christ knows how to chase them away but with a puff of her breath we know whom we have believed the Bible says let the Earth let the Earth shake our confidence in him cannot move he is to us as real as a person as always nay we might doubt our own existence but Jesus his power his love his Precious Blood his prevalent atonement we dare not doubt that one puff of the breath of prayer and questions and cavals are gone one puff of the breath of Holy Faith In Praise And every skeptical attack is scattered to the winds as far as we are concerned when these fouls come down upon the body of Christ like Abram by faith we puffed them away he drove them away but I do not intend to use this text with such an object this morning this one of his morning sermons 150 years ago I do not intend to use this text with such an object this morning though one might legitimately do so it seems to me to represent to us our duty when distracting thought thoughts invade the sanctity of our holy worship here's Abraham he has killed the victims according to the divine order he has laid them in their places according to the Heavenly rule he is waiting until God shall over these victims make and ratify the Covenant but meanwhile the buzzards the kites the vultures sent the B sense the body from afar and hasten to Devour the Flesh of the bolock and the ram Abram chases them away that is so his sacri sacrifice may not be spoiled and he may have real fellowship with God brothers and sisters we never attempt to worship god without finding some difficulties in the way we never attempt to worship God remember worship is not just the church lifting our hands worship is our life towards him every day and so so now we never attempt to worship god without finding some difficulties in the way and he quotes a PO that says what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat now you can be coming to any other thing but when you begin to come to the real mercy seat with the power of atonement coming back on your life hindrances get in the way thoughts get in the way Satan gets in the way see young people just so close to coming to a Brokenness to to cross the sound Berry and come into Christ and they get bombarded with all kinds of things some boy or girl comes along or some thing of the world that they're feeding on comes along some new thing and they were just on the verge of crossing the sound barrier and Satan interrupts at all of it because why they were setting their eyes and their heart towards The Mercy Seat what various hindrances we meet in coming to The Mercy Seat we and our assemblies are like angels and theirs when the sons of God came together Satan came also with them how many knows that in the days of joob when the sons of God presented themselves Satan was there too so as sons of God when they come to present themselves Before the Throne of God Satan comes that's a scriptural uh scriptural truth we find that where what wherever we may be and in whatever frame of heart and with whatever earnestness we may attempt to worship God there is a servant with us who must be told to stop at the foot of the mountain while we go and worship God Yonder on the Mountaintop or else our offerings will not be profitable to ourselves nor acceptable to God now how important is our worship before the Lord and how important is our sacrifice that he's revealed to us in this hour how important are those two things it's everything our worship is our life before this sacrifice God gave us and this word that power that comes from the word the two most important things in your life young person parents the most important things you set before your children is what Christ has done for us can you say amen and our lives are worship unto him because of it our lives are our worship the priority it's above any other thing but you're going to have a battle because you start to set your heart towards the mercy seat and your children's Hearts you're going to have the devil bring in some fouls that you have to sh away but Spurgeon says it's our thoughts and here's the thing he getes from Charles Spurgeon I'm going to read some of what he said and I'm going to encourage you to go read it because I can't read all the paragraphs under it it's a full sermon it's tremendous stuff but here's what he says the types of thoughts that invade our worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts anxious thoughts annoying thoughts ecclesiastical thoughts I don't know uh you can't sit here and say oh he's from 150 years ago how many can raise your hand and say yeah he's got some truth here to what he's saying of what interrupts our worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts anxious thoughts annoying thoughts ecclesiastical thoughts and so the first are wicked thoughts the Sons of Satan the wicked thoughts are the Sons of Satan these respect no sac places the sanctity of our closet has been violated with thoughts of lust the Dignity of The Mercy Seat has net suffice to rep repress the vile insinuations of blasphemy wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart of the believer yet seeketh to find a lodging there did you notice how sound that Doctrine is wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart that's what I just preached you the desire for sin is burned out by the power of calvary and the Holy Ghost so there's no more desire for sin on the sole level wickedness though it dwelleth no more in the heart of the believer yet seeketh to find lodging there and well doth it affect its purpose at times for it terth like a wafering man for a night lingering there sufficiently long to Mar our devotion and to prevent our having joy in fellowship with God Wicked lustful thoughts Charles virgin is dead on Wicked lustful thoughts can invade your mind to stop your stop your pure Worship in the Lord can can you say Amen then he says worldly thoughts in company with these foul vultures these things called worldly thoughts which spring from the force of habit the wheels have been running the last six days in this direction and his gets into the seventh day the first day excuse me the last six days the wheels have been running the last six days in this direction it is not quite so easy to reverse the action and to make them go the other way we have been sinking sinking sinking in the myy clay of Daily Business it is not very easy for the soul that lies cleaving to the dust to rise at once towards heaven on Sunday it is no wonder when you have so many things to think of in this age of competition 150 years ago the age of competition it is no wonder when you have so many things to think of in this age of competition that The Ledger should lie there in front of the Pew instead of the Bible and that at times the daybook should come in when your hand holds the hym book or that you should be thinking of a bad debt or of a long account which is rather precarious instead of meditating upon the faithfulness of God of the pardons bought with the blood of Jesus Christ you're thinking about business life you're letting those thoughts invade the worship that is around the greatest thing in the world and that's the atonement for your life you gave yourself permission to by be diverted by what he calls worldly thoughts and I agree with them business thoughts life thoughts the cares besides Wicked and morly thoughts another set of ravens would be croaking over us I mean anxious thoughts which are the fruits of our unbelief oh saith One how can I help it how can I help it how can I help these anxious worrisome thoughts if you knew my condition in business you would not Marvel that I that care or worry would come in today loss after loss continually going backward though with energy and perseverance I seek to make progress you don't know how I feel I've got justification for these worrisome thoughts if you knew the condition of my business right now everybody don't forget that this isn't Paul Le fonting saying this this is Charles Spurgeon sometimes in our prayers and in our Sabbath worship we shall be disturbed by those carryon crows called annoying thoughts The Offspring of our vanity I will just mention some of them that you will that you will think perhaps rather odd but I have no doubt you know them we have known sometimes a sister come to worship and she notices why is Mrs Sono is why Mrs Sono is dressed differently from what she was in last Sunday or perhaps my breth and as you came in there was some little mistake at the door or when our friend got to the Pew he found it occupied by somebody else that's my seat or he is not occupying just the door seat where he likes to sit or perhaps he's standing in An Inconvenient place you know we're chuckling at this stuff and it's 150 years ago but I'm saying he's dead on because our thoughts can invade our freedom of worship I didn't want to pass this practical advice to us okay apply what Abraham did to the sacrifice and apply it to your thoughts nothing should be able to invade our freedom of worshiping God especially when we come here I do my part to keep this place Sanctified this building set aside no other events going on in here keep it quiet you can come here anytime and pray throughout throughout the day we if the door is not open we'll get it open for you this is a place set aside for him if we do that then when you come how about a prar a preparation in your heart to say I'm going to give my full mind and attention to what God's going to do in this place let me finish this he says he says uh I will mention the brood of fowls which will haunt Mount Zion I mean in the last one is ecclesiastical thoughts so what do I mean by these why that sometimes when our minds should be perfectly free from work for worshiping God Church business perhaps Church differences thrust them themselves upon us the Deacon thinks he may worry himself a little about something that has occurred with the poor the Elder thinks it would be a justifiable to be thinking over the case of such and such h a refractory individual whose case has troubled him the member thinks he may be fretting about the dullness of the ministry the minister thinks he may be groaning because some in the galleries have not joined the church and and and mark all these are good things in their places but they have no business at all with us when we come to God's house to worship him then these birds even though they they uh then these birds even though they like The Sparrows that build under the ease of the altar must be driven away for until we can get rid of all we shall not find the day of rest such as it should be nor will our worship be acceptable Before the Throne of God nor our own Souls derive The Joy they ought to have from the service and the presence of the Lord this may be simple tonight Charles spurgeon's points may be simple and practical but they are right how about we start with our own thoughts when we talked about brushing away the fouls off the sacrifice how about we start with our own thoughts getting in the way of our worship in the way of our Sundays in the way of our victory in the way of our freedom to worship casting down imagination in every High thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of God where's that at brother Paul why don't you to go find it tonight it's your homework casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of God bringing into captivity
