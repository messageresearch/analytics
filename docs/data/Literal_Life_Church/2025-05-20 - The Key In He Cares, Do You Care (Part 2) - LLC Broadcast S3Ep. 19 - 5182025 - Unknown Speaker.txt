If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] with you now. And you never walked away. Been through a few trials and somehow I bent but did not break. You've never failed me and you never will. It's true. Might sound crazy, but I'll sing it still. I count it all joy when I run into trouble. I count it all good when the bad days come. Cuz I know that you're always working. And I know that you're still not done. So I'm going to lift your praise through the trial. Ain't no storm going to stop my voice.

The more I learn I can trust you, Jesus. Oh, the more I understand. You never failed me and you never will. And you prove it on the daily. So I'll say it still. I count it all joy when I run into trouble. Count it all good when the bad days come. Cuz I know that you're always working. And I know that you're still not done. So I'm going to lift your praise through the trial. Ain't no storm going to stop my voice. Cuz I've lived some life and I've learned that I can always count it all grace. Count it all joy. Oh, I'm counting all my blessings. I'm naming them one by one. And that number keeps getting higher. And I've only just begun. I'm counting all my blessings. I'm naming them one by one.

Cuz I know that you're always working and I know that you're still not done. So I'm going to lift your praise to the trial. Ain't no song going to stop my voice cuz I've lived some life and I've learned that I can always count it all. Count it all [Music] do. Count it all. Count it all joy. First Peter chapter 5 and verse 5. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourself unto the elder. Yay, all of you be subject one to another. Be clothed with humility, for God resisteth the p proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Casting all your care upon him, for he carth for you. Casting all your cares upon him, for he carth for you. So, I've opened up a little series here. The series is the key in He Cares, Do You Care? That's a service that Brother Bran preached, and I won't go back to some of the things that we brought out in the last service about it. Uh, but it is certainly something that's a key message. is not so much doctrinal, but it's kind of an entrance for people uh people of God to be able to know the entrance into God, the entrance to get God's attention, the entrance to have a caring God step into our situation. And so, I think there's some really key elements here. And the key is bringing a God who cares to connect with a person who cares so that they can really be delivered. When brother Brandon titles it he cares, all of us know that and say know that we have a God that cares about every detail of our lives. But then he didn't leave it just that God cares. He said he cares. Do you care? So the key that I'm talking about is when we can bring those two things together. You have a God who cares. You have a God who wants to step into the situation. You have a God who wants to be the supernatural God and lift you out. As we were speaking of Sunday of the ascension and the power of God to lift, you have a God who cares, but then you've got to connect that with the person who really cares. So, he cares. Do you care? People can say they care, but their actions and their life show if they really want to get help, if they really want to be delivered. So, he cares, but but it's only half of the thing. In other words, God can care and God can step in and God can supernaturally move. But if he doesn't have that other side working with you, they really want deliverance, you can't bring that together. And actually, when you bring those two elements together, God can do something supernatural. God can step in and do something uh that's beyond human. Can you say amen? So if that then if that's true, if those two elements come together and something supernatural can happen, if it's true, then we know that our enemy would work really hard uh at making a person hesitant to turn everything over to him. He does not want to see that connection take place. Satan does not want to see this type of oneness between someone who has a need and a God who's a supernatural God. He would like to see that connection stop. And one of the things in this series is I want to get to is all the things that would make a person hesitant in their heart to embrace. And there's actually a word here casting all your cares. I don't know if you know what that means, but I want to break it down in the next services of even what casting our cares. We got to know what that means because that's what he asks us to do. to take all of our worries and all of our fears and our anxiety and our depression and our things that we don't understand. He's asking for all of the when he says casting all your cares, it means all of our cares. It we don't just handle some things on our own. He's actually saying cast all of our cares upon him. And I want to know what that meaning cast means. And it it has a deeper meaning. And we got to understand because that's what he's asked us to do is we've got to trust him to cast all of our cares upon him because he cares for those things. But you see now I want to explore all the ways the enemy tries to hold back a heart from trusting the Lord to cast everything on him because that's where the enemy works. That's where he's and uh the it's the kind of trust and guess what uh that kind of trust today in the Lord is rare. That kind of trust to cast all your cares upon him is rare. And why is that? Well, I think a lot of it is people don't trust. And people's image of God has been hurt. People's image of spiritual things has been hurt. And so now they're they they love God, but they hold their heart back. They don't fully trust. People don't trust ministry today. People don't trust the government. Of course, today they don't trust. But but when it comes to God, the real God, what a shame when Satan makes people mistrust God. I mean, we can mistrust government. We can not trust those other things. And you might even have an issue with people and people hurt you so much. But there comes a point where Satan, you have to draw a line with the enemy when he's causing you to hold back your heart from trusting in a God who cares. Can you say amen? And I want to explore all the ways the heart can hold back because that's where we run into trouble. God cannot fully step in when the heart is with withheld from him. That's right. So, Satan has certainly uh done his best to keep this connection from happening of he cares, do you care? And that that making that connection and we will just get into all the ways that Satan would uh try to uh keep somebody from fully trusting God and all the hindrances to God uh stepping into your situation. Remember, he does not say, "I care." God doesn't just say, "I care." And this is what I dealt with. It's his caring is doing something about it. God cares enough to step in and change things. He doesn't stand back and say, "I care." He wants to step in with his power and change things. Always remember that when you're praying, God's just saying, "I really care for that. Oh, I care for that need." No, he's ready and willing when the situation's right. When the atmosphere is right, he's wanting to step in and change the whole thing. Amen. Because he's a God that doesn't just say, "I care." He's a God that wants to step in and show that he cares. His caring has emotion and an action to it. And so our caring, he cares. Do you care? Our caring must have emotion and an action to it, not just words. Can you say amen? you know, um I was thinking today we ministers uh um have a kind of an interesting position and um just standing between God and the people and uh that's a that can be a wonderful thing. It is a privilege. It's a wonderful thing to kind of be uh a ministry of reconciliation. What you're reconciling is take a god that's real and reconcile with the hearts of men. And so we stand in between that. You stand in the gap for people as a minister. We stand here in the pulpit and we don't do this for money. We shouldn't do it for money. We don't do it for our health. Uh we don't do it because there's not something else to do it. We do it because there's a calling in our hearts to stand in between and try to connect people with this supernatural God and bring the people together with their needs that they have. And it's it's quite an interesting thing and I I won't elaborate on that, but it's sometimes it's good, sometimes it's rough, sometimes you want to put up your hands and uh retire. I don't think ministers probably can do that, but anyway, uh you know, sometimes you want to because but really what we're what we do this for, we want to help people. We want to help people be saved. We want to help people find their way to the foot of Calvary. We we and but the thing is is that we we have no power of our own to help people. We have no power of our own. We're not serving in this capacity thinking that we can change people. And if we do, we've got the wrong motive. We've got the wrong energy. Can you say amen? We really need the humility to say, "I can't do anything, but I can be a conduit to point the people to the right thing to bring the presence of God." Can you say amen? And connect the people. It has to be a connection with him and the people that happens. And we cannot help people. We cannot uh we cannot change people. Um, a matter of fact, it's today it's a supernatural thing when people change because people change but not much. Bill Gaither's father said that. He said it was some wisdom. People change but not much. And uh that's it seems like a negative statement and all of us in the kingdom of God realize it's possible for God to change people. But if you're looking at it without of God, without God, people change but not much. There's not much change that takes place. Once something's ingrained in their mind, once something's ingrained by their upbringing, once it's ingrained in their spirit, they pretty much stay that same way. It takes a supernatural God to change the heart and change thinking. Can you say amen? To be transformed by the renewing of our mind. But we ministers, and if you've served for a long time, then you are extremely sensitive to your lack of your part in this. And also you're sensitive to waiting for God to show up. Amen. Can you say amen? When you're young in the ministry, you think you can do it, but then God knocks the props out from underneath you and you realize you can't do anything. He did it to Paul. He did it to every other minister. And Paul finally said, "When I'm weak," uh, I love there's one chapter where he goes and starts boasting of all the things he's been through and all his weakness. Because there was some apostles or some preachers that were bragging. They were bragging. We're like Paul. We're doing this. We're doing that. He says, "And they're boasting of what they can do." And Paul's basically saying, "You guys don't have a clue what ministry is all about. You know, I've I've been beaten three times." He goes into his biography and he say, "This is what ministry is really all about. sure you want to be a part of this? You sure you want to do all this? Shipwrecked, you know, all these other things happen to him. And he says, "If I'll boast of anything, I'll boast of my weakness because when I'm weak, he becomes strong." And the only fruit that's come out of his ministry that's supernatural, it's because he became weaker and weaker and weaker. And it was not any of Paul who did it. It's not any ministry who does it. It's God who does it. We we stay disciplined to the call. We do everything that we can, but we realize what we're waiting for as ministers is that moment when somebody connects that needs something and connects with the supernatural God. We're preaching, we're preaching, and we're we're doing, and we're serving, but it's really those God moments. It's those moments there's a connection. Can you say amen? It's there's it's the moments, and it only takes one moment. Can you say amen? It only takes just one connection and it's over. Amen. That's how big God is. But you see now uh and and and so we don't preach. We're helpless unless he comes. 1 Corinthians 2:4, there's a power of God in the gospel. We're waiting on the power of God to change people's lives. Paul said, "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of the power." Paul believed that it's not to get up here and preach a sermon. It's not to dazzle people with all the things, you know. Uh, may we as ministers, if you're listening tonight, may we ditch all this pride and bragging and all this stuff we can do. And may we get to what Paul said is that we're going to bring an atmosphere that there's a demonstration of the spirit and the power of God that people can connect with a supernatural God. Unless we have that, it's a waste of time. It's a waste of a sermon. Can you say amen? And I believe in teaching, but I believe in teaching by the Holy Ghost. I believe the Holy Ghost teach not just preach. I'm going to do a little teaching tonight. But you see, it has to be by his power, not just intellect. What is serving the Lord? It's connecting with the creator of heavens and earth. The one who spoke this world into existence, spoke the stars into existence, is the same one who's speaking to you tonight. We're dealing with a creator. And a creator wants to create something new. Amen. A creator doesn't polish up and put a band-aid on the old. He creates something new. I'm glad that I can preach and point to people and welcome the creator of heavens and earth that can create something in the people. Come on, praise the Lord tonight. Praise the Lord. This isn't just church. This is the creator of heavens and earth showing up. And we want him to show up every service. We need this in our life. Can you say amen? So it's access to the creator himself. So as ministers, that's what we're looking for to really help the people, God. So now let me say, let's move on now. And you know, and you you have to know that there is so much to this series. I'm just going to slow down and even though I'm yelling already and excited, I'm going to slow down and take it piece by piece because this has to be taken piece by piece. So the next point I want to make, God cares by creating. Amen. God cares, shows he cares by creating something new. Never can we underestimate what a creative God can do. In the beginning, uh, and that's where you hear the word create a lot is in Genesis. He created this. God created the heavens and the earth. God created. And so as he took this the 6,000 years there and and he created and he you know he he he brought all these things and he created them. And you know uh before he started creating the Bible says the earth was without form and void. That means it was empty. It was without form. It was what we would call today a chaos. There was no order to it. But the creative power of God by the spoken word took chaos. Took chaos and created something new. That's right. Why are you saying that, brother? Cuz tonight we serve the same God. He doesn't want to patch up human beings. The creator wants to create something new. He wants to start over. Can you say amen? And he wants to take chaos. And so that's when you go to prayer for for even some trial or lack of something in your life. When you go to prayer, it's not just asking for a caring God to be mindful of your situation. You're talking to the creator. And the creator can change and create something new. Now friends, you're I don't want you to just just say amen tonight. I want you to really get this in your heart. When we go to pray, when what we're dealing with is not another sermon or not another movement here. We've tapped into and connected to the very creator of heavens and earth that can create squirrels. Can you say amen? That can speak to the storm and it would go away. A man spoke the words because the creator told him to speak the word and he changed and created something new, something that wasn't there. We're dealing with a creator and he cares by creating. He doesn't want to patch up something. He doesn't want to just make it. so God can start creating. When man fell and he needed redemption 4,000 years later, redemption is not a different work than creating. Redemption is bringing something back, but he still does it by creative power. Amen. God doesn't say, "Well, I created things in the beginning, but now that man has fallen and I've got to bring them back now, I'll just patch him up or I got to use a different way." The same creator that created the heavens and the earth now comes on the day of Pentecost and he's the same creator. What's he creating now? Not the heavens and the earth, but now he's taken a fallen man and he's by his creative word speaks his spirit into that man. And Paul says he becomes a new creature created a new in Jesus Christ. I was thinking of the men on the road to Emmas who had been with Jesus watched all the miracles and so Jesus steps in in another form and he and uh they're all troubled about it and they said that the the women had just went to the tomb and come back and reported that he wasn't there and they're just all trying to and and Jesus said this. Oh, fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said. And from that moment, he begins to open the scriptures to them to show them this was this has happened exactly the way he said. But see, they only looking at the flesh of what happened. Now they're disappointed. He's gone. But they're not looking at the word. This is exactly what was supposed to happen. You see, but look what he said. Oh fools and slow of what? Slow of heart to believe. Now, I just thought of it today that if back then Jesus is telling them, "You're very slow at coming along to believing after they'd been with Jesus physically for three and a half years, then how slow are people today to catch this thing." And that can be a real frustration for a minister. And a minister can become impatient really quick with people. But impatience with the people of God will never work. Fear tactics will never work. Force is never a good motive. Fear is never a good motive. Be in shape. They should be way further along than they should. You see what a a minister deals with? Because as I say to pastors, I say we hold the vision of where this word can take the people. And then as a pastor, we look at the saints every week and some are moving along, some are slow. So, and you can get frustrated. They're supposed to be over here and they're way back here. I'm not talking about any of you, of course, but you're caught in the middle saying, "How can they not see the vision of where this word can take them?" When you got that vision, you say, "My, they should be much further along. Maybe I should be much further along." And you get frustrated with it. But you can't because why? They're slow of heart to believe. But all it takes is one moment in a connection to God, the creator, and that's it. So now, let's move to the next step here. Now, God cares by stepping in and creating. You listening? We show we care by creating the right atmosphere for him to step into. He shows he cares by bringing the creative power of God to create something new and start a fresh. Remember this now. We can't just have a God who cares. Do you care? Well, I want to get into how do we show we care? Well, we're we're creators. And the biggest thing that we create, we can't uh the biggest thing we start by creating is creating the right atmosphere. We're atmosphere creators. You change the atmosphere. You open the door for a creative God to come in. So I want I want you to learn now this. He cares. Do you care? It's God the creator on one side. It's a creator of the right atmosphere on the other side. Creating an atmosphere for God to step in and do something supernatural. It's creating on both sides. It's creating on both sides. You by your attitude and your humility create a different atmosphere that welcomes a creator who cares to step into the room and make changes. Let me say that again. You by your attitude, your humility uh create a different atmosphere. You change the atmosphere and it makes it welcome for a creator to step in. Now, that opens us to the next section here to just begin exploring ways that we can approach and come to him to show we really care. Some of this that you're going to know, some of that you some of this you may not know, but we want to explore. We've probably heard enough preaching about how God cares. He's a supernatural God. He's a creative God. I wanted to deal with that tonight. But we really want to begin to break down how we can create an atmosphere and offer up our hearts. so that we can create the right atmosphere so that for the creator to step in. He cares but do you care? How do we show we care? So we want to explore this approach. We want to explore this and we can come to him and show we really care and create the right atmosphere and and we want to break down the approach to it and those who are interested in a caring God to step in will be interested in these things. One of the things that we do to show that we care and that we want to get help and that we want to connect with God is that you're willing to say, "Lord, line up my heart with your word and my confession." Because why? It it it creates the right heart and atmosphere for God to step in. Amen. And you can't ignore it and get something greater from God. You can't. You're showing if you're hiding things, you're showing it you don't really care. Can I be real? If you're still hiding things or you're not still not being honest about things, you're showing God that you really don't care to get freedom that you're asking for. But let me show you where we're going with some of these points of how we show we care. Okay? And there'll be more to these, but I just wrote seven down tonight. If he says he cares, do you care? How do we show we care? The first one is real, true, unclouded faith from the heart. When that's clear, then we're showing we really care. If it's left hidden, if it's you're hiding things, if the devil's put unbelief there, this isn't for me. I don't believe it because I believe it's for the person sitting next to me, but I don't believe it's for me. Any kind of cloud like that over your heart, uh, is not going to give you the faith that you need to step out. It has to be a foundation of faith. Number two, true submission from the heart. Where do I get that from? I get it from the scripture in the text that reads, "Submit yourself one to another." So submission, true, and as I say, true submission from the heart. Number three, real true humility from the heart. That's in our text. He said, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God." And that's the entrance to to showing you care. You've got to really humble yourself. And I want to elaborate what humility is because it's not just the word. It comes across in our actions and our words and our heart towards God that you're really humble. You don't think you got it all figured out, but God has it figured out truly casting stress, anxiety, worries, and fears on him. And I'm bringing all these words cuz he says, "Cast your cares." And cares is related to stress, anxiety, worries, and fears. It says, "Truly come and cast all those fears upon me." Do you care about getting deliverance? If you care, you're ready to cast all those things on him. Giving more attention to him that is speaking. You need to give more earnest heed to who's speaking. You ever had a kid that's just has selective hearing? You ever give sit them down, look in the face, and give them instruction, and they look like a deer looking at headlights of your car, and they didn't get any of it. Can we be that way with God where we're hearing all the stuff, but we're not valuing, hey, sit still. The Lord's speaking. Perseverance that will not run away or hide. Desperation that won't give up shows that we care for watching our service today. If you would like more information, please contact us by visiting our website, literallife.urch.
