TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 4 and verse 35 and i just want to make a little comment this morning i don't know if kyle knows where he's turned into just yet but um sadden wanted to show my support wasn't sure how big how many people we'd have i'm surprised at how big a congregation is this morning with a holiday in that but so i thought you know i'm gonna go support him and he starts talking right exactly about the subject that i'm gonna talk about this morning so brother kyle let that be a confirmation to you i'm taking it as a confirmation to me and then uh to take it even further he says you know he's talking and he he uh he says you know i really you know i really want to take it this way but i'm going to go this way and i'm thinking well i'm taking it the way you wanted it to go so so god's at work this morning and in the songs and the comments that have been made brother dan taking the the request so now i just got to get out of the way amen mark uh 4 35 and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships am i reading in the right spot here okay and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him just keep going and they came over under the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken pieces neither could any man take him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him and he cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he said unto him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send him away out of the country now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they come to jesus and see him with the possessed hymn that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed of the devil and also concerning the swine and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him how be it jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish and the decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men marveled let's just bow our heads one more time lord lord jesus we come before you and father we're so grateful god we're so thankful for the confirmations you've given this morning lord now i just ask you god to help me to get out of the way help your people to get out of the way father and be fully open to receive from you god and and fully open father for you to step forth god just let me step out of the way now that you'd step forth and speak to your people god i pray lord give them what they have need of lord set lord the captive free father give healing lord to the sick and the afflicted lord give comfort to the needy in jesus christ's name amen amen you can have your seats i'm going to step out on a limb here this morning and i'm going to dramatize it just a little bit and uh maybe say some things that um you're going to say boy i don't know about that but i'm going to say him anyway and just humor me so we know that before there was a beginning there was and before god was god we know that it was the the great i am in a vast before there was even really a space and he was by himself and he was alone with his thoughts but then jesus came the word jesus came forth and then and then creation started and we can fast forward from from that time god visits a virgin mary who who births jesus in flesh and and i can see him coming as he stepped out from from the father and he was creating there with just him and the father and then he was birthed into his creation i can see him maybe one years old and and i know mary they they were considered you know kind of outcast because of of what was thought about him but i just say maybe there was a close group maybe it was family there and maybe it was with elizabeth they were visiting and jesus and john are just one years old and they're in their title and you know they're they're playing you know there's before they can walk and things and and um and the the moms are pitting the olives and they're they're making the food and things you know that the women did back in the day you know it seems like any time there's a depiction of what was going on they're always doing something because they they had to survive and so the kids are there playing and and maybe it's john he gets hurt and he's crying and and jesus looks over at him and in tears fill his little eyes because he's looking on compassion for this little boy that just got hurt and you say that's ridiculous but i've seen little kids that small that when another child started crying they would start crying because it was just too much for them to handle they had so much compassion in their heart that they just started crying themselves say two years later three years old again playing with the other children while the mothers knit together and another child falls and gets hurt and it's crying and jesus is is over there and he's playing with his his wood blocks as daddy made him and he sees this child get hurt and crying and the knees are scraped and bleeding and and the mom walks over and picks them up and you know all the other kids are going about their business and and the mom's trying to comfort the baby and the baby's just hysterically crying and jesus gets up from his blocks and he walks over and with that compassion in his eyes he just touches the little baby and the bleeding stops and the baby quits crying and wiggles out of its mom's hands to go and start playing again with the other kids fast forward in time and jesus is 12 years old on the way home from the passover maybe it's the time when joseph and mary were frantically searching for him and it was that time that they found him in the temple and he was teaching and they were they were astounded yeah i'm going out a little limb now so bear with me as they walk back towards the city gates there was a prostitute standing on the street corner and jesus just a 12 year old boy walking past and he notices this prostitute and he's just never seen anything like that before and so he's just kind of staring looking at her and she she waves at him and smiles and mary's just got her arm around him and she's she's walking him and she's chiding him you know why'd you do this and you shouldn't have done that you gave us a scare and things and she looks up and she notices where jesus is looking and she sees the prostitute she jerks his head and rushes out of the city gates jesus on the way home he's got a lot of questions about what he just saw you're saying brother this is absolutely ridiculous you're off the word but remember jesus was god but he was man and so he saw this and maybe in his young 12 year old body you know the the the hormones and things and and just the curiosity and so he's asking questions why why was she dressed that way mama why was she this way why why why was she a prostitute what is that and he's asking all these questions and maybe maybe the feelings all of a sudden they turn in his heart because the god part kicks in and he starts his mind goes back to what the father said about whoredom and he feels compassion go out of his heart for this woman in this state in this condition 16 years old entering into the city with joseph to sell their carpentry work there's someone singing over in the corner it's a homeless man playing a stringed instrument like jesus has never heard before he's got a couple more licks than what jesus is used to hearing and and uh you know the the the homeless man is is trying to collect money and he's singing about how he lost his dog and his wagon and his wife and and then the song changes and he starts talking about being with a woman who's not his wife and you know it was a catchy tune so jesus is standing there he's never heard this before and he's he's wanting to hear the lyrics and he's you know it's kind of appealing to the flesh and joseph just snaps his fingers and jesus looks over and joseph just shakes his head and does like that jesus comes on maybe 18 years old he gets his license to drive the wagon brand new wagon that joseph just built taken a long time to collect the wood and to get the wheels and things but joseph just got it just right just right beautiful finish on it i mean this thing was slick brand new never had a brand new wagon for the family jesus 18 years old and he's driving through to take the take the products the goods to go sell them and on the way he gets too close to the rock and it scratches down the side of the wagon jesus is frightened because he's thinking this is a brand new wagon what am i going to do i just put a scratch on my dad's new wagon and the thoughts start going through jesus's head well just don't just don't tell him and then reasoning kicks in and he looks at it and he goes he's not going to miss that so then jesus is thinking and he's driving and he's thinking okay if i get home and i get to my tools before dad sees it before joseph sees it maybe i can buff it out and then he says it's too deep he's going to notice and then as he's thinking these things and as you're thinking this preacher is just crazy proverbs 12 22 comes to jesus's mind lying lips or abomination to the lord but they that deal truly are are his delight psalms 101 verse 7 he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight jesus tells the truth he tells joseph what happened around age 21 i told you i'm out on a limb here so jesus is praying hard for him for joseph because he's fallen sick you know you have a lie after a certain time in the bible you have where they don't talk about joseph anymore it's just mary joseph becomes sick jesus is praying hard for him but he passes away it's a hard thing for jesus to understand it's another hard thing for him to watch mary grieve jesus is moved with compassion and he hugs mary and after a good cry together jesus just starts whispering scripture that comes to mind that says joseph is just sleeping mama you'll see him again someday we'll see him again there's a hope and then maybe he tells his mama i'm saying mama but we know but he says mama we know what i'm here for i promise you you'll see him again you see jesus was tempted in every like manner as we are yet he overcame every temptation and he was without sin that you and i could live a victorious life i was realizing this week that you know i've i've i've had a lot more victories in my life than even what i realized and i just became so thankful to the lord because i didn't i didn't see him but yet it was just some things i was reading and god was just showing me that you know what you you have you have victory over here and this and this spot here that the devil's always beating you over the head over you have had a victory there and it was just it was it was just wonderful for me to see and you have victory and though you make mistakes and though you fail and and we falter and and things you have victory through jesus christ because jesus came and he died that you could have victory jesus came that you would have life and have it more abundantly god became flesh that he could feel what we feel the grief of loss the pain of a scraped knee the sickness at different times in his life he became us so that we he could be our our high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities hebrews 2 17 wherefore in all things it behooved us it before him to be made like unto us brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people so god so loved the world that he came down from the glory and splendor of heaven from the pure worship of the angels to save sinners such as you and i this was always something that's that's been astounding to me and that when i think about it i just i just feel that overwhelming feeling that god in his perfection knowing no sin knowing no sickness just in that perfect state that our bodies cry out to be in pure worship from angels angels think of that angels worshiping him day and night designated angels designated just to be in his presence beholding not even be able to behold his glory they have to keep their their their eyes and and their feet covered and they and then they have the wings to stay there and they're just they're in that that presence of jehovah of god and yet god could soak that in but he would rather come down and soak in your praise he left all of that perfection that he had created so that he could be god he left all of that to come down to earth to be with you and i so that he could understand what you go through and what you and i go through so that so that he could answer your prayer and that just like maybe he looked over and saw that little child with the scrape knee and compassion overwhelmed him and and leaked out of his eyes so that he could understand every situation that you would go through and that he could come down and touch you in your situation so i want you to get out of your mind this morning that your situation is too big for god or or that god doesn't hear your prayer god hears every prayer when daniel prayed the angel of the lord came to him and depending on seems like i studied that a long time ago and and i don't know but you could probably say that was jesus christ i'm growing a whole tree here this morning all the limbs but but he said daniel i heard you the first day that you prayed and i tried my hardest to get to you but there was a there was a dimension in the other round that i had to deal with the great prince of persia the devil himself fought me but but i had another angel come i think it might maybe that was what it was maybe it took christ to come and and fight the devil hold the devil off so gabriel could get through but he said i'm gonna i fought for you from day one to get down to you to answer your prayer i heard you the first time you uttered your voice there's a time and a season for prayers to be answered and we we don't understand that because we want it right now but but god knows all things and he knows just where you need to be and he knows maybe where just somebody else needs to be in order for him to come answer that in his full plan be made fulfilled so my title this morning is what god will do for one needy soul it's been a couple years since i preached this and it's been burning on my heart so here we are this morning and if there was only one soul that needed a redeemer to die i believe god still would have done it for that one needy soul if in all the earth if in all of seven thousand years six thousand that we've been here you were the only soul that needed saving jesus christ would have come and saved you the exact same way that he did because he set up his plan a certain way because he had certain attributes about himself and it had to be done a certain process had to be had to be taken care of in order for us to be saved and if you were that one person he would have done it for you brother branham says our scripture reading tonight is concerning a desperate man kyle i think read right from this a man by the name of juria jarius it was in the right in the middle of the ministry of our blessed redeemer savior when he was here on earth he spent much time in prayer he went up into the mountains and he prayed and a day before this he had just crossed over a sea all the way over a stormy sea to help one single person he went over to gadara to help a maniac over there that was bound in the tombs crossed over a stormy sea to help one man in trouble because one soul was calling to him and he's the same yesterday today and forever he come out of glory tonight come out of his his power to make one single person of this earth well tonight to help one person and i believe that he'd be there for each day thousands around the world excuse me where great campaigns are being held now in the closing up of the gentile dispensation may he come tonight now through study and i just i grabbed different things that um excuse me that brother branham said about this man i'mma preach through this if you don't mind the man was probably an upstanding citizen this is what kyle talked about this morning understanding where he came from the man was probably an upstanding citizen a young dedicated christian man let that sink in who had been just recently been married maybe with two or three children and a lovely wife he loved and everything wow that's brother branham going on a limb by the way his raw things he said no that's a prophet seeing it but he got with the wrong crowd and maybe that crowd encouraged him to drink or great or gamble or something brother branham said and listen careful he he took maybe they they talked him into taking his first drink brother branham said first drink first devil went home that evening and lied to his wife about where he had been and what he had done second devil on down he spiraled until he had fully surrendered himself to the devil i was doing some reading and this is some of the things that the lord was was speaking to me personally out of but i just thought that this was some amazing statements the author said sin will always take you further than you want to go sin will always do that it's progressive and it's subtly aggressive so it's progressive in that it takes you further than you want to go so it builds upon itself it's progressive it's always going to take you deeper take you lower but it's a subtle progression it's not it's not just you know the devil puts a a naked woman in front of you and you commit adultery usually there's something that leads up to it right maybe maybe uh uh you know i used jesus seeing a glimpse of a prostitute maybe it's a glimpse of of uh you know scantily dressed woman and then then it gets you into pornography and then it's on down on down until you find yourself committing adultery it's subtle but i say it's aggressive it's aggressive because you never thought you would become that way you never thought that you would go to that low but you did it's aggressive you think you're in control and then you find you lost control when you first yielded to it first string first devil first lie second devil you think you're in control of the situation maybe that man said you know what i'm i'm never going to do that again but he got back around his buddies their own crowd somebody he thought who is was his friend let me tell you if if you've got friends and they're they're trying to coax you into doing things that you know is wrong that's not your friend that person's being used to the devil let's just call it what it is that's not your friend and if you're doing that to somebody else you're not their friend and shame on you if you're doing it you need you need god you need to get to an altar but if somebody's doing that to you you need to recognize that and you need to leave that friendship let it go don't don't stay around and say well i'm going to save them one day no you're probably not they're going to get you filthier and filthier and take you down further and further i've seen it firsthand where someone goes and they say you know well i'm just going to witness to them i'm just going to do my best and god's really moving and god's doing things in their heart and that person is no longer serving the lord today what happened the influence reversed i i'll never forget that you've heard me say it and there's just certain things that have stuck out to me through life but you know this guy was saying if you put a white glove on and you stick it down into the mud the mud doesn't get glovy the glove gets muddy and you think well what about the power of god well the power of god says don't go there don't stick don't stick the white glove in the mud stupid right i only say stupid because i've done stupid things there's another problem that goes on within our soul within our heart the problem is we desire to stop a little less than we desire to keep going the problem is we desire to stop a little less than we desire to keep going and then he asks a question and he said are you more committed to your sin or to obeying god listen this isn't to belittle you this is to say be real be real with yourself and be real with god these are honest questions that you have to ask yourself but one thing that i learned about victory in my life that i didn't recognize before is stumbles and struggles do not equal failure stumbles and struggles do not equal failure you say boy i was doing so good and then i messed up but but but what's in your heart what's in your heart crying out to god and if you have that cry in your heart that's something that you need to latch onto that's a good thing that's a good sign that's that's that's building up to a victory i encourage you this morning keep going keep trying don't give up don't get discouraged keep bringing it to god keep repenting keep coming and and keep getting the strength of the holy ghost keep feeding on the word because eventually like brother paul preached you're going to turn around and you're going to realize that your taskmaster is now drowned [Applause] you'll see it but there's no power to it he said brother branham said if the devil can drive you into a bar room or out into the street immorally and doing let me see here so if the devil can drive you into a bar room or out in the street immorally or doing the things of the world which is contrary to your own nature because you were born to be a son and daughter of god and let these things sink in because these are deep things that can talk to the voice of the enemy in your life and the devil can make you do things and cheat on your husband cheat on your wife steal lie how much more can god do when he gets full possession of you don't don't discount the power of god don't give the devil more more power than he actually has because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world so if you have jesus christ you have all the power you need to overcome the power that keeps binding you that keeps you running you into the gutter you have it in you not by your strength not by my not by power but by my spirit saith the lord can you overcome every temptation through every temptation god has made a way of escape and you have access to it you have the power within you to yield to the holy ghost to overcome these temptations if you'll just yield to it it's all in and what you want more and sometimes it's only just a little margin if the devil can bring some sickness on you that steals your energy and your strength if he can be so strong and hold somebody down through some sickness or affliction often times when brother branham was talking about this he'd say in a wheelchair or with the withered arm or on a crutch if satan has that power then how much stronger is the power of god how much stronger how many testimonies are out there of somebody bound in a wheelchair or somebody dying with cancer and i'm not i'm not trying to point backwards because we got plenty testimonies today but i'm just trying to show you that regardless no matter how strong the devil's hold is to bind you into a chair or to bind your mind up into something that that just is destroying your life how much greater is the power of god how many times have we seen god come down and rise up somebody from the chair throw away the crutches the mind battle ceases the heart is purified the the the the spirit is set free how many testimonies let's not give more power to the devil than what he deserves give the power to god that he deserves let your faith let your faith cut loose this morning let your faith grab a hold of god listen my whole point in going through that at the beginning you have god then then the word comes out and then he comes down and he's going through these things it's because god came down from heaven for one needy soul god came down from heaven for what you have need of this morning whatever it is you you put your you you name it you name it this morning and god came down for you but i'm not wanting to leave that back at some past event of jesus dying on the cross that's where it happened friends that's where it was that's that's exactly right but today this morning in this service god will come down from heaven for one needy soul if there's only one person here that gets something out of this god will have have arranged events not not saying me by all means i'm not saying me but so that a particular service goes a certain way a particular thing is said for you because you had need and and and god will bend heaven down and stoop down i got a scripture at the end that i just i was trying to find it when i found it i was rejoicing in the office because god will bend heaven down to come to you this morning the maniac of gadir completely out of his mind completely and they said that listen now we're talking about power and who's more powerful he was he had not him the devil had so much power in that man's life and he was so yielded to the devil the scripture says that remember when they cried out the demons and they said what do you have to do with us jesus said what's your name and they said legion for we are many when those demons were cast out two thousand pigs ran and drowned into the sea one man had two thousand devils on them and and what i love is just depending on the accounts you read brother kyle read it this morning jesus walked up and this has always been astounding to me and this is just the way that i believe it when the power of god comes down jesus spoke one word in matthew i think it was and all he said was go that's all he said was go jesus is out starting in his ministry and at the beginning of mark you'll find the man as he's preaching and teaching the the the people listening are saying this is nothing like we've heard before maybe it was the same things that they've always heard but they said this man is speaking with authority he's speaking with authority we've never heard it like this before and then jesus astounds them a little bit more and it's and it's devils people bringing actually it was a man in the synagogue with an unclean spirit and it cries out and it says we know who you are you son of god and you know what it said jesus said you know what don't shut up that's right he just shuts the devil's up because he wasn't quite ready for for it to be known who he was and so he says hold your peace go out of the man and that was it the devil might have screamed i think it screeched and thrashed itself but it had to go because jesus spoke because the power of god had come down and there was a needy soul there and and and you know we get we get caught up on on the the physical things that we can see but these are spiritual matters that god is taking control of and that god's speaking to because because there's one soul there that is bound up and and liberty is is so important to god he wants you to be able to worship in freedom and when you're worshiping and you're trying to worship with sin in your life and you can't give yourself freely that's a needy soul god wants to come down and get to you so that you can worship him freely and it's not and it's and yeah it's pouring out your love upon god but it's so that he can pour his love out upon you he wants you to get the full benefit of worshiping him of relationship it's relationship but god jesus saw this man no doubt in a vision and he was there and the multitudes were great with him and jesus no doubt knowing when we hit the water shortly after there's going to be a storm and that was why it was so important jesus could have just said let's get in the boat and sail north he could have left it at that but he turned around knowing what was coming and he tells his disciples let's go over to the other side that should have been enough i don't want to spend too much time on this because brother paul was on it wednesday but he said that should have been enough but the disciples like just the waves came brother branham said there was a thousand devils on every wave sitting there and they're thinking we're gonna sink the ship we got him now he is in our clutch sea is so much more unstable than land we're going to get him he has no idea what he just but then jesus comes later and he says you know what i'm going to answer that call too i'm just going to step out on the stormy weave waves and walk them show the devil he's he's god of the of the land and god of the sea and he's god of the heart this morning and he's god of the mind and he's god of the soul and so he encountered the storm and all these devils on the way over just because one man the the town the city turned them out they said we don't want you here you just you just tore up our livelihood we don't want you here why don't you leave jesus says no problem i got the man i came for amen i got the one i came for there was a multitude that should have been crying out to god because they they all needed this this christ but there was one man jesus said i don't know where it's at in my notes i don't see it and i thought it was here yeah whoops then i lost my train of thought oh there was there was a couple of things g that brother branham said about this man that man was so insane he couldn't cry out for himself so watch watch this now watch the depth of of the power of god of the love of god the man couldn't cry out for himself he was he was too submitted to the devil brother branham said he would come to himself maybe and and he would say what am i doing here and then brother branham said the devil would come right back on him because he don't want him to come to his mind because then he might start believing that there's that he might start crying out to god so before he could have the opportunity the devil would come on him and send him right back but there was a soul down in there and though the devil could stop the lips he couldn't stop the heart that heart was crying out and then brother branham said that there was some gray-headed mama that was praying for this young man somewhere and then he said maybe his wife was praying for him so i want to encourage you this morning gray-headed mama don't stop praying you wife don't stop praying because you send the power of the holy ghost out when that soul isn't crying out himself you have the power within you now to overtake however many devils that that young person has on them that's right that that husband has on him that that wife has on her you have the power to call heaven down and god will bend heaven for one needy soul so i tell you this morning don't stop crying out keep crying out you say but every time i cry they get worse of course of course because you're crying out and the devil knows his days are numbered when the voice of god came brother paul's been saying it when the voice of god came pharaoh's days were numbered when your voice cries out to god the devil's days are numbered but i want you to understand something i want you to really catch this it's not your power but it is power within you because if you jesus said if you abide in me and my word abides in you if the word abides in you that makes you the word right let's reason just a little bit and if you're the word and jesus was the word then you're the same it's the same as jesus christ calling out for that soul you are his lips amen you are you become the heart of god crying out for a need that's good now i don't want to i'm going to take this off of the maniac of gadira for a minute because i want you to just see how important this is to god jesus comes back from delivering the maniac and he steps onto the shore and he starts walking down a particular path jesus hits shore he can go this way and go that way he can go this way and go that way he could go that way this way that way back that way over this way but jesus starts walking and there's a multitude that's following him and along the way jarius comes and says can you come by my house my daughter's sick jesus took a particular path because there was one needy soul in jerius's house it was a dead girl she was gonna die she was really sick on the way there they come out and met her and said you know what it's too late forget it just don't bother him she's dead but there was a needy soul in there look at look it i just feel like we're hitting the devil this morning the devil said you know what i'm going to take her last breath i'm going to take her last breath and that's it then god can't do nothing for but jesus says i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me so jesus says satan you took her last breath whatever the girl is daughter i give you your breath back took her by the hand and said get her something to eat just to show that you know what this girl isn't i didn't bring her back and she's gonna remain sick so sick that she can't eat he said you know what she's fully restored give her something to eat [Applause] but along that same path that jesus walked that day to get to jerius's house there was another woman and this woman had an issue of the blood you don't think jesus knew what he was doing when he took this particular path and that woman was so in need that's why god can come down in a service and he can talk and and hit so many different lives because i just picture jesus walking through the aisles and as he's walking you're touching him your need is touching jesus it reaches out and it grabs a hole it just reaches and and touches the hem of the garment touches touches his pant leg as it were just that it's your heart it's your need but god took that particular path that day and that woman just so ashamed probably an outcast i imagine that she was just so distraught because this was so many years that she's dealt with this thing and the devil kept telling her you're going to deal with this all your life and could you imagine that imagine how needy this woman was that she's walking she starts crawling through the multitude just to just to reach and catch his garment as he walked by could you imagine i mean this is throngs of people and and she just she just had to reach through so many legs just just a touch just to touch his garment but she said i know that if i can just touch the outer skirt of what he's wearing then i have enough faith in this man that he's going to love me enough i know that this is god and i know that my need can touch him this morning and she touched it and jesus out of all these people could you i just uh just imagine all these people jesus you're all the people and i'm jesus and jesus is walking and he stops and he turns around and he starts looking around and he said who touched me and the disciples were like he did just heal the maniac maybe he's losing it but jesus says no no you don't understand you don't understand what touched me there was a need that just touched me and he finds her way in the back and he says woman you're healed amen that's right you're healed thy faith has made thee whole jesus took that path for one needy soul amen there was three women had need of being set free from bondage of sin jesus was at each place at the appropriate time jesus sitting in the house of simon the pharisee he accepted that invitation no doubt knowing that he was going to be rejected that day but there was a needy soul crying out to him he had an appointment that he had to keep and it wasn't with simon the pharisee it was with a harlot amen remember when he was 12 years old maybe he saw and compassion went out and so this particular need was personal to him and as he's sitting there and the party's going on this woman comes and she brings she spends all she has to buy this oil to anoint his feet and jesus sitting there completely rejected that's right and that woman comes and she starts crying pouring out her need on jesus's feet just if i could just touch him and maybe you have that in your heart this morning if i could just touch him if i could just touch jesus touching jesus is all that really matters and then your life will never be the same but there's only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name and that woman believed that she could get something from jesus that day and i imagine that it just tore up to be sitting there watching jesus completely rejected and so she rushes in and she she starts crying over his feet and she's pouring out her her guilt and her shame that she felt she's just just hoping hoping believing that this man is different from the others that maybe he'll give her what she stands in need of she feels bound by the shame and the guilt and the lifestyle that she's had jesus discerns the thoughts of the hearts going around him and he says let me ask you something simon who's more grateful if you owed 500 talents and and if she owes 500 talents and you only owe 50 who's gonna be more thankful if i write off that debt that's right and he says well 50 i guess well done and then he turns to her and he says thy sins are forgiven me amen and can you imagine that needy soul how she felt that day hearing those words knowing that this man is different seeing the miracles and the signs and wonders that he's done hearing his his voice hearing the way he speaks is with authority knowing that this man could make a difference in my life and god gives her what she needed another time there's a harlot another woman another prostitute caught this is if i read the scripture right she's caught in the act of adultery probably set up because the pharisees bring her to jesus throws her at the feet and they say now we got him that devil that was anointing those men says now we got him this is what the law says what do you say i noticed something in each of these things is the religious of that day went back to the law held on to the law but jesus said but there's a needy soul here he said i'm the fulfillment of the law so she's thrown at his feet and the accusers pick up stones and they're going to stone her but jesus doesn't even respond to their question listen this is this is what i'm trying to get to you this morning is that god is answering needs in a much deeper way because it wasn't a sincere question first of all but even if it was jesus starts dealing with them with their heart not what they were trying to do to this woman but jesus listen she had need of somebody to stand up for she had a need she was in a lifestyle that she felt trapped in she's trapped by the devil but jesus comes along and he starts dealing with the accuser and then it's just him and her there jesus bent down probably writing their sins in the sand and he told him he said if you're if you're if you don't have any sin in your life go ahead and cast the first stone and then he drop back down and he starts writing again and they they slowly it says from the oldest down to the youngest they start dropping their stones because they realize i can't justly throw this with what he just said i'm just as guilty look at he's putting i don't want him hey don't put my name next to that let's get out of here before he does and jesus just not even in that world to himself i'll tell you who was in that world with him that day was that woman standing behind him crying fearing for a life they were in a world together because she had need and jesus went by that way that day and so he stands up and he turns around and he just looks around and she's crying and maybe too afraid to look up at him he says hey woman and she looks up he says where's your accusers they're not around and then jesus spoke to that woman's need that went deeper than even a physical healing went down into her soul and he said woman i don't accuse you either go and sin no more and that you know what if you think about it go and sin no more that woman didn't want to live that lifestyle and jesus not only took care of her guilt and her shame for what she had done he gives her an opportunity go this way don't sin no more you can live a new life from this day forward jesus gave that woman new life the woman at the well are you still with me the woman at the well the bible says jesus had need to go by samaria we all know the story the need jesus had was to meet the need of this woman he had an appointment that he had to make there was a need from samaria crying out to god stuck in her sin and her shame stuck in the lifestyle she was living in but but but she had touched god with the cry of her heart not knowing how to get out of it and so jesus says his disciples i have need to go by samaria and they're thinking samaria we hate the samaritans why do you got to go by samaria we can go around samaria but jesus said no no i have need there's a need in samaria jesus went broke all the culture of that day broke all that satan had put in the culture for that day all he went against all odds the cultural separation not despite what she was but he had need but that woman had a question on her heart too and that question was where is true worship supposed to take place you you jews you say this and and we say this but and now you're saying it's in jerusalem but i'm not allowed in jerusalem so where do i go to worship and jesus answered it and said woman let me tell you something it's not a physical place it's in your heart and that's what touched me your heart is what touched me this morning in spirit and in truth so just as i bring this down to a close what's your situation this morning what do you need god to step into jesus said he cast demons out by the finger of god jesus just cast out two thousand devils by the little finger of god brother kyle said this morning he said then what do we have to be afraid of if that's what god if that's what jesus was walking around casting devils out when he had the full he was the fullness of god and he says listen it's just my little finger just hit him in the right spot and they got to go by the little finger of god and i you know it's not it's not downing when people jump and shout and and scream under the anointing of god but you don't have to jump for it this morning you don't have to jump for god to get a hold of your need to see you it's it's your heart's cry your heart crying out to god is what touches god let me just find i want to read this and of david psalms 18. psalms 18 and verse 1. god's in you through the life of the holy ghost just let your faith go this morning what if i don't have enough faith i wish you'd stop thinking that right i wish i would stop thinking that stop thinking that and trust the pool you feel in your heart and just let your faith go just just yield to the call that's in here not what satan's telling you up here yield to the call that's in here amen and just say lord i believe that's right jesus was tired and weary when he was crossing but there was one soul calling out for god and then this is where i found we said this earlier about the mom praying the wife brother branham said love is how you cast devils out it's not getting the person and beating them in the back it's not dragging them to the altar it's it's love remember that quote he said the man was coming home from the meetings and he was so so on fire for god that he'd come home and he'd grab his wife and he'd start shaking her and he'd start come out of her devil come out of her and that totally turned her off from anything of god and brother branham says you know well that's okay but that's not how you cast the devil out you cast the devil out by loving that person amen psalms 18 and verse 1 i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength and whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation in my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me i can i can just hear the devil saying you're going to hell in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears then the earth shook and trembled and the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wrath there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and a fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly he didn't just walk down to the need he flew because the need was so the need cried out to him he rode on a cherub and did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies notice the scene is not not some frilly god not not god coming down and he's he's he's bringing a good word god's coming down with judgment upon david's enemies because a needy soul cried out to him so god said i'm bending heaven and i'm going to fly on the wind to get to your need at the brightness that was before him this thick clouds passed hailstones and coal fire this wasn't god coming down he's he's coming to battle he's bringing down the elements of heaven to drive the enemy out the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire yeah he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomforted them this is what god does for one needy soul then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebukel lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me don't put it off on david let the cry that you have in your heart this morning cry out to god and say god this is what i need this is what i need this is what god does for you this is what god does for one needy soul you can stand to your feet if the musicians want to come if you've got that last quote up there this is the results of an encounter with jesus is it not working there we go this is after the maniacs encounter with jesus i can see him go down and here's the story i see i can see him or look around well the landlord had done put his wife out there was no poor little thing she prayed all the time maybe for him to be healed come back his little children when they'd see him coming they'd run and hide and everything his poor little wife would have to go get out of the way because he's bad he come in he tore up the place you know something else i found in study is when brother branham when he would say this he would say that man had a temper and he'd say a bad temper an uncontrolled temper is is actually scientifically a start of an insanity so if you got a bad temper this morning you need jesus that's the way a drunkard does or demon possessed run into one of these temper fits and kick everything around the house you ought to be ashamed of yourself that you even belong to church and maybe on the deacon board brother i wished i had a little bigger audience this afternoon of some of them that's right yeah belong to the deacon board and act like that here he comes in though he comes down slips down the house is closed where's wife he goes out and asks someone on the street said she had to move down there in the alley i can see him go down there to a bunch of old tin cans and things piled up and look around here and a little old shack with some bushes laying up together and there she is in the backyard or rubbing a washboard maybe taking on the neighbors washing the little children holler mommy mommy here he there he comes there he comes and they started to run like that hard as they could run i can hear him say wait a minute sweetheart his wife says oh oh he said wait a minute sweetheart don't run something's happened amen i can see him walk in and look at the tattered sleeves of his little old wife's dress look at his poor little children standing there trembling put his arms around them i can hear one little boy say the next to the next little girl what's happened to daddy say mother mother what's happened to daddy i can see the tears running down his cheeks put his arms around mother and around the little kitties pick them up said now wait a minute i'm gonna tell you what's happened to daddy daddy come in contact with jesus that's what's the matter daddy found jesus and as it did for legion that day it'll do for daddy and mother both today when you find jesus you'll never be the same legion could never be the same no man could ever be the same after once finding jesus let's pray lord jesus we come before you god and father i just ask the people that if they have a need on their heart tonight this morning if if it's a need for themselves if they can't find their way out of the sin that they've gotten into james said lust takes over and then sin and then death [Music] satan
