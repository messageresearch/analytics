[0:20] if we'd want to turn to Luke 23 and
[0:23] verse 42
[0:30] .
[0:34] just pray the Lord speaks to us
[0:37] and this ministers to you
[0:41] so he says and he said unto Jesus Lord
[0:44] remember me when thou cometh into thy
[0:46] kingdom
[0:48] let's pray
[0:50] Lord we just we thank you for this
[0:51] opportunity Lord Lord we just pray that
[0:54] you open our hearts Lord of what you
[0:56] have to say Lord pray that you help me
[0:58] to get out of the way Lord and relax
[1:00] Lord and you just come through Me Lord
[1:03] Lord let us pray Lord this has the
[1:07] effect that you wanted to Lord
[1:08] pray comes forth like it should Lord
[1:10] Jesus
[1:11] in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:15] amen
[1:16] and you have receipts
[1:19] so this has a bit of a backstory
[1:22] I was actually supposed to preach about
[1:24] a month or so ago
[1:26] and I messed it up
[1:28] and I didn't preach so brother Paul had
[1:31] to throw something together and preach
[1:33] and he did a very good job
[1:35] but during that service I got the title
[1:38] to this and it's if I had a title it'd
[1:41] be love and do you have what it takes
[1:44] so the Lord we
[1:46] humans put titles on these things but if
[1:48] there's something on your heart that you
[1:50] need hold on to it the Lord knows what
[1:53] you need and he can bring whatever that
[1:55] is if it has to do with this title if it
[1:58] doesn't have to do this title he can
[2:00] bring it all we have to do is hold on
[2:01] our Harps and be accepting of it
[2:05] so love
[2:07] what is love and how do we love and what
[2:10] does love look like
[2:11] these are a lot of questions we have
[2:13] about love and love is a very tricky
[2:15] thing
[2:16] so if we start out with what does love
[2:17] look like
[2:18] we have so many places that we can go to
[2:21] to find out what love looks like we can
[2:23] go to Facebook we can go to Twitter the
[2:25] world makes it so much easier to go
[2:27] everywhere on the internet to find what
[2:29] love looks like but if we're going to
[2:32] love look where love if we're going to
[2:34] look for a good example of what love
[2:37] looks like we'd go to the scriptures
[2:41] and where I would start would be Mark 4
[2:43] 35 through 41.
[2:47] you bring that up
[2:51] it's Mark 4 35 through 31 41 35-41 sorry
[3:00] so it says in the same day
[3:02] when Eve was has was come
[3:05] he's saith unto them let us pass over
[3:07] onto the other side
[3:10] and then when they had sent away the
[3:12] multitude they looked they took him even
[3:15] and as he was in the ship and there were
[3:18] also with him other little ships
[3:22] and there arose a great storm of wind
[3:24] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[3:27] it was now full
[3:30] and he was in the hinder part of the
[3:32] ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke
[3:34] him and say unto him Master careth
[3:37] though not that we perish
[3:39] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[3:41] said unto the sea peace be still and the
[3:44] wind ceased and there was a great calm
[3:47] and he said unto them
[3:49] why are you so fearful how is it that ye
[3:53] have no faith
[3:56] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[3:58] to another what manner of man is this
[4:00] that even the Wind and Sea obey him so
[4:03] if we don't stop there and we keep going
[4:04] to mark five
[4:06] this is where the love comes in
[4:11] he did this in Mark 5 verse 1 it says
[4:14] and they came over onto the other side
[4:16] of the sea into the country of gatherine
[4:19] and when he was come out of the ship
[4:21] immediately there met him
[4:24] out of the tombs a man with an unclean
[4:27] spirit
[4:28] so they crossed this whole thing for one
[4:31] man
[4:33] but if we go back a little bit if we can
[4:36] go back to the what I say 35 Mark 4 35.
[4:42] Jesus tells them that we're going to go
[4:44] across the other side
[4:46] it sounds super easy
[4:48] we're just going to go across the other
[4:49] side
[4:51] hop in boys this is going to be fun
[4:54] so they get in this boat so who's in
[4:57] this boat
[4:58] with the disciples are in this boat we
[5:01] can look further in the scriptures and
[5:02] it says the disciples are in the boat
[5:03] but the disciples are in the boat
[5:06] so out of the disciples there's
[5:08] fishermen in the boat there's that we
[5:11] know of Andrew Peter James and John are
[5:13] fishermen
[5:15] and there is some that say Thomas
[5:18] Phillip and Bartholomew were fishermen
[5:20] as well but
[5:22] the point is Andrew Peter James and John
[5:24] were fishermen their dad was a fisherman
[5:28] so they knew how to run a boat
[5:31] so they get in this boat we're going to
[5:33] go on to the other side that's all we're
[5:34] going to do it's going to be simple
[5:38] go to the next scripture
[5:40] next one
[5:42] and there came a great storm and the
[5:44] waves beat into the ship so that it was
[5:46] full
[5:47] so now the ship is starting to go down
[5:50] and you have four fishermen on there
[5:52] that have been doing this their entire
[5:54] lives on this ship
[5:56] so if there was a Rudder their Rudder in
[5:58] this thing as hard as they can render
[5:59] this thing if there was ropes they're
[6:01] pulling on the ropes if there's things
[6:03] that cut they're cutting these things
[6:04] they're doing everything they can to
[6:07] keep this ship afloat
[6:09] and they can't do it they realize we
[6:12] cannot do this so they go to Jesus they
[6:15] didn't go to Jesus and say hey man
[6:17] when you got a minute
[6:19] gonna need your help over here
[6:21] they were going to die they knew they
[6:22] were going to die they had done
[6:23] everything they could they were going to
[6:25] die
[6:27] so they were yelling at him come right
[6:30] now we're going to die we're gonna die
[6:32] and Jesus showed up
[6:35] and Jesus calmed the storm
[6:37] but they get to where they're going
[6:40] and they go for one man
[6:42] so these poor guys went through all of
[6:44] this stuff they're pulling things
[6:46] they're cutting things they're cutting
[6:47] sales off their ship they're trying to
[6:49] keep this thing afloat they're bailing
[6:50] it out they're doing everything they can
[6:52] to keep this ship afloat and Jesus said
[6:55] let's just go to the other side
[6:57] and they get there and there's one dude
[6:59] that they went for
[7:01] so they come off the ship
[7:04] they're shaking I'm sure it didn't go
[7:06] well at all they're pretty sure they're
[7:08] going to die the whole time
[7:10] and we come to mark five
[7:12] and he says
[7:14] he was come out of the ship immediately
[7:16] and there met him out of the tombs a man
[7:18] with an unclean spirit
[7:20] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[7:23] no man could bind him no not what chains
[7:26] because that he had been often bound
[7:29] with Fetters and chains and the chains
[7:31] had been plucked asunder by him
[7:34] and the Fetters broken in pieces
[7:36] neither could any man tame him
[7:39] and always night and day was in the
[7:42] mountains and in tombs crying and
[7:44] cutting himself with stones but when he
[7:48] saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshiped
[7:50] him and cried with a loud voice and said
[7:52] what have I had to do with thee Jesus
[7:55] thou son of the most high God I adjure
[7:58] Thee my God
[7:59] that thou torment me not
[8:02] for he said unto him come out of the man
[8:04] thou unclean spirit
[8:06] and he asked him what is thy name and he
[8:09] answered saying my name is Legion we are
[8:11] many
[8:13] so we know they went across this to get
[8:16] one man
[8:18] it's one man Legion
[8:20] so they get off this boat they're
[8:22] shaking they're cold they've almost died
[8:25] they've done all this stuff and they
[8:28] come up to a naked dude in a graveyard
[8:31] and that was the whole point of them
[8:34] showing up there
[8:35] they come up to a guy with 2 000 demons
[8:38] so if you've ever thought about it with
[8:40] two thousand demons can you name two
[8:42] thousand demons
[8:44] so if you can name two thousand demons
[8:45] can you name two thousand demons
[8:48] without putting murder in there
[8:51] can you name two thousand without
[8:53] putting abuse in there
[8:55] without putting a salt in there
[8:57] without putting the worst things you can
[8:58] come up with can you come up with two
[9:00] thousand demons that someone would
[9:01] struggle with without putting in these
[9:03] horrible things that they could have
[9:04] done
[9:06] so I can't I can't come up with that so
[9:09] they went across the sea they almost
[9:11] died to get one naked dude
[9:14] in the graveyard with two thousand
[9:16] demons that deserved nothing
[9:19] it's very likely that he was a murderer
[9:21] that he was an abuser that he had done
[9:23] horrendous things to people and should
[9:25] have been where he was that's why he was
[9:27] there he wasn't there because he served
[9:29] because he sold too many Girl Scout
[9:31] cookies he was there because he did
[9:33] really bad things and no one wanted him
[9:36] around
[9:37] and they couldn't keep him under control
[9:39] but Jesus crossed
[9:41] this Shore this this Pond to get to the
[9:45] other side
[9:46] for one man with two thousand demons
[9:49] that didn't deserve anything didn't say
[9:51] he was sorry didn't do anything
[9:53] but Jesus crossed the sea for one guy
[9:57] that is an example of love
[9:59] that's how far we push things as an
[10:02] example of love
[10:03] and it's good to think we don't always
[10:06] want to do that I I'm sure the disciples
[10:09] were not happy if you really think about
[10:11] it we almost died we came over to get
[10:13] the crazy guy
[10:15] and then we got back in the boat we got
[10:17] kicked out they didn't go there get the
[10:20] crazy guy straightened out everything is
[10:21] good everybody loves us parade we just
[10:24] walked away awesome no they got kicked
[10:27] out
[10:29] they Jesus delivered this guy and they
[10:31] got kicked out they had to go so we
[10:34] showed up for this crazy guy you helped
[10:36] him out and they don't even want us here
[10:38] but you wanted to do this because God
[10:40] wanted to do that for you
[10:42] we have to have
[10:44] the scriptures have to be real to us
[10:46] this is you
[10:48] this is you in the scriptures this is me
[10:50] in the scriptures
[10:52] this is this is the love that God has
[10:54] for all of us
[10:56] so that's an example that's one of my
[10:57] favorite examples in the Bible of what
[10:59] love looks like
[11:01] but love is hard it's complicated
[11:05] so why is it hard and why is it
[11:08] complicated
[11:10] so if we look back at the beginning this
[11:13] is kind of how I see it at the beginning
[11:14] of our Christian walk when we start off
[11:17] I feel like we get some things
[11:20] we get some tools if we go to Ephesians
[11:22] 6 and 13-17
[11:25] we'll see
[11:28] about this
[11:31] so it says wherefore take unto thee the
[11:33] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[11:36] to withstand in the evil day and having
[11:38] done all to stand
[11:41] there for having your Lawrence girded
[11:43] about with the truth and having on the
[11:45] breastplate of righteousness
[11:47] and your feet shod with the preparation
[11:49] of the gospel of peace
[11:52] above all take the shield of Faith
[11:54] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[11:57] the fiery darts of the wicked it says
[12:00] all the fire darts didn't say some of
[12:02] them says all the fire darts
[12:04] so if we go on and take the helmet of
[12:06] salvation and the sword of spirit which
[12:09] is the word of God
[12:11] so
[12:12] we got our helmet we got our Shield
[12:15] we got all the things we need to start
[12:17] off with
[12:18] and then we start to hear
[12:20] about love where God is love love is
[12:25] everything without without love you
[12:26] don't have God so we start to wonder
[12:29] where do we get
[12:31] What is love and if we look we want just
[12:34] a black and white example we looked at
[12:36] Corinthians 13. First Corinthians 13. so
[12:39] to paraphrase for time we've read First
[12:43] Corinthians 13. so if you read through
[12:46] Corinthians
[12:47] First Corinthians 13
[12:49] you can do almost anything and if you do
[12:52] it without love it means literally
[12:54] nothing
[12:55] you can be a prophet you can be a pastor
[12:57] you can be a preacher you can be the
[12:59] best musician there is you can help
[13:02] everyone you can be Mother Teresa you
[13:04] can give away every nickel you have and
[13:07] you did it with the wrong Spirit it
[13:09] means nothing it means absolutely
[13:11] nothing
[13:13] so what happens
[13:14] we start to this sounds harsh right so
[13:17] we we want to look for love we find love
[13:20] in the Bible but it says if we don't do
[13:22] it with love we're nothing we're
[13:25] absolutely nothing
[13:26] and we start to skew
[13:29] our love we start to see things we the
[13:33] problem is we start to bring things with
[13:35] us we complicate our loves because we're
[13:38] a product of our making
[13:40] we're a product of our raising sorry
[13:42] we bring things with us as we come into
[13:45] this Christian walk and the problem is I
[13:47] see a lot like Moses when they start to
[13:50] leave Egypt
[13:51] so if you think about it this Moses guy
[13:54] comes we're going to leave Egypt he
[13:55] starts doing stuff nothing's happening
[13:57] nothing's happening nothing's happening
[13:59] so finally the guy shows up at the door
[14:03] knocks on your door and he says hey
[14:05] Billy Bob it's time we're finally going
[14:08] this Moses guy apparently it's real
[14:10] we're going this time I promise so you
[14:13] say okay I gotta grab my thing
[14:15] so you run and grab your thing
[14:19] and now you got your thing
[14:22] and you got your you got your sword you
[14:24] got your Shield but the problem is you
[14:26] brought this thing with you
[14:28] you brought this thing with you that is
[14:31] your past
[14:32] you brought this thing with you and you
[14:33] can pick it up along the way so you're
[14:35] so excited we're leaving we're going to
[14:37] leave Egypt but then things start
[14:39] happening as you leave things start
[14:40] happening as you become a Christian
[14:42] and it starts to hurt you and you don't
[14:44] know how to let it go because you got to
[14:46] Sting with you so then
[14:48] you start to try to look through this
[14:50] thing
[14:51] and do all the stuff that you have to do
[14:53] with this thing
[14:55] that you won't let go
[14:57] in it's complicated it's hard to let the
[15:00] thing go it's really big and it's in the
[15:02] way
[15:03] like this plant
[15:04] so we have this thing and it starts to
[15:07] mess up everything that we're doing
[15:08] because we're trying to do everything
[15:10] while looking through this thing and you
[15:12] can't see a thing
[15:13] because you have a thing
[15:21] so
[15:23] where do these things come from
[15:25] these things come from like I said they
[15:27] come from our past
[15:29] a lot of times we have so much trouble
[15:31] letting go of things that happen to us
[15:35] now why do we have trouble with letting
[15:36] know things that happen to us
[15:38] a lot of times because we want to have
[15:41] it handled in a certain way
[15:43] we want to make sure that God is going
[15:45] to get it right
[15:47] but you have no idea what you're doing
[15:51] in we can have the hardest part about it
[15:54] is
[15:54] it doesn't stop it's not just a little
[15:57] thing it can be big things it can be
[15:59] little things
[16:00] so
[16:01] can I tell you
[16:03] can tell you a story
[16:06] so there's this little boy
[16:10] he's four years old
[16:12] when he's four years old he's staying in
[16:13] this hallway
[16:15] and there's Green carpet and you stand
[16:17] in an endless hallway and there's a
[16:18] bookshelf
[16:20] and there's a TV in the living room it's
[16:22] on a swivel he thinks it's cool
[16:24] and he used to watch TV on there with
[16:26] his Dad he used to watch a cartoon
[16:28] called gargoyles
[16:29] but this night his parents are arguing
[16:32] his dad's sitting in a green recliner
[16:34] and they're arguing and they're arguing
[16:36] and arguing they're fighting and it's
[16:38] getting really bad
[16:39] and as dad goes
[16:41] he backs his things up and he goes and
[16:44] he starts to realize this little boy
[16:45] realizes when this happens that this is
[16:47] something Clicks in his head
[16:49] then he knows
[16:51] this is going to be the last time they
[16:52] see his dad for a while
[16:55] so his dad goes his parents divorced
[16:59] his dad goes
[17:01] down the road
[17:02] his dad develops a drug problem
[17:05] so his dad has this drug problem
[17:07] you got to get drugs but you got kids
[17:09] what do you do take the kids to the drug
[17:12] house
[17:13] so as this little boy is six years old
[17:15] he starts asking his mother
[17:18] why do you go to the pharmacy to get
[17:21] your medicine and dad goes to some guy's
[17:23] house
[17:24] and she said what do you mean and I and
[17:26] he said
[17:27] well when when Dad gets his medicine we
[17:30] go to this guy's house he's got dogs
[17:32] he's got all this cool stuff
[17:34] and that's where he gets his medicine
[17:37] so they realize
[17:39] that this man is taking kids with him
[17:41] his children with him to get these drugs
[17:45] so they get taken away and it starts a
[17:47] whole thing of them getting taken away
[17:49] from him he's getting custody for a
[17:50] minute getting visitations for a little
[17:51] bit then they get taken away constantly
[17:54] so this little boy has brothers and
[17:56] sisters he has older brother and sister
[17:57] he has lots of brothers and sisters
[18:00] so his older brother is in trouble all
[18:03] the time constantly in trouble all the
[18:05] time
[18:06] so he comes picks him up
[18:08] and they're driving down the road in
[18:10] these cops cars surround the vehicle
[18:13] and the older brother looks his little
[18:14] brother he's six at a time
[18:16] and he says don't worry they're here for
[18:18] me you'll be fine
[18:20] so the cops arrest his brother
[18:23] and come to find out that his brother
[18:24] had broken into their home
[18:26] and destroyed their house and they
[18:28] couldn't figure out who had done it and
[18:30] it was the oldest brother that had done
[18:32] it
[18:33] so this little boy gets taken home by
[18:36] the police
[18:37] and this just starts
[18:39] this whole thing constantly his brothers
[18:41] and sisters are in in and out of jail
[18:43] constantly he's seven years old
[18:46] and he used to get babysat by his Uncle
[18:48] Pat well you can't get babysit by Uncle
[18:51] Pat anymore and his mom explains to him
[18:53] that's because Uncle Pat's in prison
[18:55] Uncle Pat got in a fight with a man and
[18:57] killed him
[18:58] so he's in prison for the rest of his
[19:00] life
[19:00] he went away
[19:02] and he can't get out now so Uncle Pat's
[19:05] out of the picture now his oldest
[19:07] brother's out of the picture now and it
[19:09] just continues on this way to where
[19:13] you get this kid who down the road is
[19:17] getting in a little bit of trouble and
[19:18] things like that and he's 12 years old
[19:20] and he starts to chew tobacco
[19:23] so then he starts to get into more
[19:26] things because it just lets you let it
[19:28] go
[19:29] your dad don't want you
[19:31] everyone around you is either in jail or
[19:33] in prison no one really cares about you
[19:36] they got their own problems to deal with
[19:37] so it just gets easier to take pills and
[19:40] to drink and forget about it and this is
[19:43] 13 years old
[19:45] so don't think that it's too young
[19:47] this is 13 years old when this started
[19:50] so it just starts this whole deal
[19:53] he's encouraged by his brothers and
[19:55] sisters to do all these bad things it's
[19:57] easy to get things because he has older
[19:59] brothers and sisters it makes it way
[20:01] easier to get the things that you
[20:02] shouldn't be able to get
[20:03] and it becomes an Angry Kid a really
[20:06] angry kid who's in fights all the time
[20:09] he's constantly in fights in school
[20:11] constantly fights out of school wherever
[20:14] he can he's fighting because he has this
[20:16] thing
[20:17] he has this thing with his dad
[20:21] so it keeps going on and it just gets
[20:23] worse and worse and worse gets kicked
[20:24] out of career center expelled forever
[20:26] for fighting
[20:28] he's starting to fights with kids that
[20:30] don't deserve it and doing the worst
[20:31] things that you can do
[20:33] so
[20:35] this little boy his dad is in and out of
[20:37] his life everyone's constantly in and
[20:39] out of his life
[20:40] he gets a stepdad that makes things a
[20:42] little bit better for a little bit
[20:43] longer but then his mom divorces him as
[20:46] well
[20:47] so
[20:48] his dad
[20:50] comes in and out of his picture his
[20:52] whole life he's been in on his picture
[20:53] and there's been times where his mom had
[20:55] to hide the kids in the basement because
[20:57] the dad wanted him he just wasn't
[20:58] supposed to be there and she knew that
[21:00] if she didn't hide everybody in the
[21:02] basement
[21:02] if this man got through the door things
[21:04] were going to end badly it wasn't going
[21:06] to go very well for this family
[21:09] so this little boy goes down the road
[21:12] still doing all these things in car
[21:14] accidents in the drugs into fighting
[21:16] keeps going on and on everyone's going
[21:18] to prison constantly all the time
[21:22] so
[21:23] he gets down the road
[21:25] and he gets into a car accident
[21:28] and things start to change for him at
[21:30] the car accident so if we fast forward
[21:32] he gets married he has all these things
[21:35] but the dad comes back into his life
[21:38] and his dad comes back into his life
[21:40] and starts helping with things when he's
[21:43] 19 years old
[21:44] and he says
[21:46] I'm sorry
[21:48] for everything that happened I'm not
[21:50] pointing fingers at you but I just want
[21:51] you to know I forgive you
[21:54] and the little boy wasn't sure what he
[21:55] was forgiven for
[21:56] because he was a little boy when all
[21:58] these things happened
[21:59] and his dad put him through all these
[22:01] things says Dad would constantly use his
[22:03] children as a bank account
[22:04] so he would get money buy things up and
[22:07] then he'd run out of money so he'd
[22:09] invite the kids over to bring their toys
[22:10] and he would steal all their toys and
[22:13] take them sell them so you get more
[22:14] drugs
[22:15] and anytime he came around it was to get
[22:18] more drugs just to steal something it
[22:19] was to get something from these people
[22:21] to get more drugs
[22:23] so he comes back into his life
[22:25] and
[22:27] he says I forgive you for all the things
[22:29] you did I forgive you for being a bad
[22:31] kid
[22:32] and he says okay
[22:34] I was a child
[22:36] and the man still
[22:39] he just he wanted to let the kid know
[22:40] that he forgave him for being a bad kid
[22:44] so this just this little boy is just
[22:47] angry he's had to deal with all these
[22:49] things
[22:50] and he's just angry he's very angry
[22:53] and it just compiles all the time
[22:56] because you don't want to let it go
[22:58] because this person deserves
[23:00] to get what they have coming
[23:03] but that's not for us to decide
[23:06] so you probably most of you know this
[23:08] but this little boy is me
[23:11] so my dad came back in my life
[23:14] and it never got better
[23:17] it never got better
[23:18] it was constant problems with my dad he
[23:21] continued this until he died he died
[23:24] three years ago and it never stopped
[23:27] in
[23:28] it was constantly him stealing from us
[23:31] him taking things from us him doing all
[23:33] these things
[23:35] and it got really honestly worse and his
[23:39] dad was homeless for a long time so it
[23:41] came to
[23:42] the end of the road and he had nowhere
[23:45] to go my Grandpa died
[23:47] he was living with my grandpa living
[23:48] with whoever because at this point
[23:50] my uncle's dead my other uncle's in
[23:52] prison my dad's almost dead my grandpa's
[23:55] dead everyone that's in Nicholson is
[23:57] imprisoned or dead except for me and my
[23:59] brother
[24:00] so my dad come back into my life
[24:03] and when it got towards the end my
[24:05] brother agreed to let him move into his
[24:06] house
[24:08] so it was a constant problem
[24:10] you have a drug addict in a house that's
[24:12] on hospice where they give you as much
[24:15] drugs as you want
[24:16] which is okay until the drug addict
[24:18] figures out how to get into the
[24:20] medication and takes all of it
[24:23] so my dad took two months worth or sorry
[24:27] A month's worth of morphine in one
[24:30] sitting and then took all of his
[24:32] Dilaudid in one sitting and passed out
[24:34] for a week
[24:35] so the problem with that is you get in
[24:37] big trouble for that because they want
[24:39] to know where all the medication went
[24:41] and you have to prove where all the
[24:42] medication went
[24:44] so this is just a constant thing with my
[24:46] dad all the time
[24:49] so to make long story short that's
[24:52] always been my thing
[24:54] I have dad issues I I have since the
[24:58] start of and this is just a overview of
[25:01] what had happened it goes far deeper
[25:03] than this because in all this
[25:05] we need to understand people do the best
[25:07] they know how and Jesus says forgive
[25:09] them for they know not what they do why
[25:11] does he say that because you really
[25:13] don't know what you're doing
[25:15] people do the best they know how so you
[25:17] take my mom my mom has two children that
[25:20] are not hers my dad had them with
[25:21] somebody else my mom has two more
[25:23] children that hers with my dad
[25:26] and he leaves
[25:28] she has a four-year-old a six-year-old a
[25:30] 12 year old and a 14 year old
[25:33] and she has to work and take care of all
[25:36] four of these children two of which are
[25:37] not even hers
[25:39] and she didn't do some things she should
[25:41] have done but people do the best they
[25:43] know how
[25:44] and when we can actually see that people
[25:47] do the best that they know how we can
[25:49] start to understand where people are
[25:51] coming from
[25:53] so we take this baggage we take all
[25:56] these things in our Christian walk we
[25:57] get back in the Christian walk
[25:59] and we start to see things through all
[26:01] this and it messes with our heads we
[26:04] don't see anything clearly because you
[26:07] cannot let these things go because this
[26:09] is how it should be handled these people
[26:11] should pay for what they did they have
[26:13] you have legitimate things that happen
[26:15] to you and it has to be answered for it
[26:17] just has to because the world says it
[26:19] should
[26:20] and you think that's how it should be so
[26:22] you hold on to it you want to make sure
[26:25] that this gets handled a certain way
[26:28] so you're walking through this Christian
[26:30] walk with this thing constantly on our
[26:32] shoulder you have chips on your shoulder
[26:33] and it doesn't have to be daddy issues
[26:35] it can be that you're born and raised in
[26:37] the church and somebody said something
[26:38] against your family or somebody said
[26:40] something you don't like and you start
[26:42] to build up these complexes
[26:43] and you start to see everything through
[26:46] these complexes because we can't let it
[26:48] go and we start to wonder why are people
[26:51] the way they are
[26:52] the answer is everybody's weird and you
[26:54] have to figure out why they're weird
[26:56] and they're weird because they have a
[26:58] past because they've been through things
[27:00] that you haven't been through or you
[27:02] might have been through but it's still
[27:03] not the same we love the excuse of you
[27:06] have no idea what I'm going through you
[27:09] have no clue you don't know me you have
[27:12] no idea what I'm going through that I'm
[27:14] sorry but that's a dumb thing to say
[27:16] because I can never know what you're
[27:18] going through you're exactly right you
[27:21] have Gideon my buddy Gideon
[27:23] get in you got a great dad you had a
[27:26] great mom
[27:26] I did not have that you didn't do drugs
[27:29] right good I did
[27:33] so if there was somebody who didn't
[27:35] write it was Gideon Gideon was raised
[27:37] with a good family getting was raised in
[27:39] a good church he's always had it good
[27:41] I've had the opposite of that
[27:44] if you put Gideon in the same situation
[27:45] as me we'll handle a totally different
[27:47] ways because Gideon can never know what
[27:49] I've been through and I can never know
[27:51] what he's been through you can bring me
[27:53] into a drug house and I'll literally be
[27:55] at home because I've been there since I
[27:56] was six years old
[27:58] I know exactly what to say I know
[28:00] exactly what to do I grew up in it I
[28:02] didn't know that that was dysfunctional
[28:05] for a good portion of my life I did not
[28:08] know that that wasn't normal at all
[28:11] but
[28:12] you put Gideon in that situation it's
[28:14] not going to go well
[28:16] Gideon's a really nice kid
[28:18] and he's sensitive right
[28:23] it is born and raised in church they're
[28:26] going to realize he was born and raised
[28:27] in church and it's not going to go well
[28:29] for him at all
[28:31] but on the flip side of that you put me
[28:33] in a functioning family and I don't do
[28:35] well with it and that might sound dumb
[28:37] to you but that's the way it is I don't
[28:39] understand I didn't understand what I
[28:42] should say
[28:43] how is supposed to function I didn't
[28:46] understand how love was supposed to work
[28:48] because I had this thing that I didn't
[28:51] want to let go of and I've seen
[28:53] everything through this thing all the
[28:55] time
[28:56] and I didn't want to let it go because
[28:59] like everyone else whether we want to
[29:00] admit it or not
[29:01] we want to make sure that it gets
[29:03] handled in a certain way
[29:05] so we keep walking through this and we
[29:07] going back to why people are weird
[29:09] people are weird because they have
[29:11] complexes because something happened to
[29:13] them that didn't get dealt with properly
[29:15] and whether they know it or not they see
[29:18] everything through that complex my daddy
[29:20] hurt me my mommy hurt me my pastor hurt
[29:22] me my Deacon hurt me somebody hurt me
[29:24] and you have no idea what I'm going
[29:26] through I understand that I'm sorry that
[29:29] happened to you it shouldn't happen to
[29:30] you but it did
[29:31] and we have to come onto the other side
[29:35] of these things which is not fun at all
[29:38] I haven't told you the rest of the story
[29:39] it's not fun at all but as we go through
[29:43] these things we start to handle things
[29:45] the wrong way and we wonder why
[29:47] everyone's arguing all the time we want
[29:48] to argue all the time especially in the
[29:51] message we should know better but we're
[29:53] arguing all the time we want to fight
[29:54] about brother brennam said this brother
[29:57] Brenham said that brother Brenham this
[29:58] brother brought him this well that was
[30:00] thus saith the Lord that wasn't thus
[30:01] saith Lord that was an opinion
[30:04] we are so stuck on these complexes we
[30:07] constantly want to fight about
[30:09] everything that we can come up with to
[30:11] fight about we want to make sure that
[30:14] we're correcting different things in
[30:16] different places because in the end
[30:19] we're trying to constantly get things
[30:20] off of us and onto somebody else we have
[30:23] to make sure we correct them but you
[30:25] still have a moat or you still have a
[30:26] beam in your eye
[30:28] so we look at what brother Brenham said
[30:29] about it
[30:30] in conferences in 60
[30:33] he says
[30:35] when we get to the place that we think
[30:37] we're the only ones that God can use
[30:40] we better call a conference
[30:42] God sent Jesus his son to die for every
[30:45] member of the body of Christ Methodist
[30:48] Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran catholic
[30:50] whatever they may be they are all God's
[30:53] children by The Promise
[30:55] how are we going to hear the message how
[30:58] are they going to heal the message
[30:59] unless we and he just he Fades off
[31:03] but he says then further down in that
[31:06] same one he says what the Pentecostal
[31:08] church and all the other churches need
[31:10] tonight it's a lay aside every weight
[31:13] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[31:16] that we might run with patience and the
[31:19] race that sets before us we need a
[31:22] conference a universal prayer meeting
[31:23] for the churches of the Living God to be
[31:26] called together
[31:28] don't think I'm angry or beside myself I
[31:30] know what I speak of the need of the
[31:32] church tonight is a conference a prayer
[31:34] meeting a get-together called together
[31:37] ministers break down their middle wall
[31:39] of partitions church members that will
[31:42] forget the differences between the
[31:44] denominations of the churches church
[31:46] members and ministers hold to the horns
[31:48] of the altar with one Accord and pray
[31:50] until the fire of God begins to fall
[31:52] again God knows that stubbornness and
[31:54] differences of men he has broken up and
[31:57] god-fearingly gets broken up and
[31:59] god-fearingly
[32:01] and brotherly love it takes place in the
[32:03] human heart then you'll become salty
[32:06] then the message will have its parents
[32:08] in the heart it'll have its influence in
[32:10] the city
[32:12] and then
[32:14] further down he says
[32:16] we could scream and shout or do whatever
[32:18] we want and it will never influence men
[32:20] until they see the Life of Christ being
[32:22] projected in you someone who is tender
[32:25] and merciful and forgiving and ready to
[32:27] turn the other side of the cheek or give
[32:29] the second coat or go the Second Mile
[32:32] Christianity in action not just talking
[32:34] from the pulpit but acting among the
[32:37] members among the pastors that's when
[32:39] you see Christ Living in the church
[32:43] but I feel like we press pause in the
[32:45] wrong part of all these we don't want to
[32:47] pay attention because we have an agenda
[32:50] we keep looking through all of our
[32:53] things our complexes we have all of
[32:57] these problems on our shoulders that
[32:58] we've come up with we've come up with
[33:00] we're a little church we're this we're
[33:02] that where the other thing and it starts
[33:04] bringing these complexes and then you
[33:06] start to think that you can actually
[33:07] hold on to people in your church God you
[33:11] cannot hold on to anything you have no
[33:13] ability to do any of that God gave those
[33:15] people who take those people away there
[33:17] is nothing you can do about it it is in
[33:19] God's order that these things happen
[33:21] so in another message
[33:24] I don't have a title on this I can get
[33:25] it to you if you need it and how he says
[33:28] and how did this great pillar fire the
[33:29] angel of God the logos that went out of
[33:32] God that led the children of Israel
[33:34] through the Wilderness when it come
[33:36] among the people it separated itself and
[33:39] great looks of fire began to come upon
[33:41] each one as the pillar of fire began to
[33:43] break up and God dividing himself among
[33:46] his people oh that ought to tear tear
[33:49] the heart of anybody God tearing himself
[33:52] apart that he might divide himself a
[33:55] little bit with each of us that all
[33:57] together you see what it means can you
[33:59] see now why I'm standing for Unity of
[34:02] every church every Full Gospel Church
[34:04] every believer we ought to be one heart
[34:06] one mind and one Accord no matter how
[34:08] much we differ in scriptures that might
[34:10] be we might see it this way or see it
[34:12] that way that's nothing to do with it
[34:14] but in principle we ought to stand one
[34:17] Great Mighty Army of God marching on
[34:20] because each one of you in the
[34:22] particular in your peculiarities God has
[34:24] proven that he is ignoring your Doctrine
[34:28] because he gave you the Holy Ghost and
[34:31] the Bible said he gave you the Holy
[34:32] Ghost
[34:34] that he gave the Holy Ghost to those who
[34:35] obey him now if I obey him in my
[34:38] peculiar way and you obey him in your
[34:40] peculiar way he give us both the Holy
[34:42] Ghost so we ought to be Christians
[34:44] brothers and sister enough to arm up
[34:46] together and March on for one great
[34:49] purpose the gospel
[34:51] I have come among them
[34:53] and among the brother and out of the
[34:55] Baptist Church and I have seen this
[34:57] great thing and I have never taken sides
[34:59] with any different ones just whatever
[35:01] their belief is is everything
[35:07] I try to stand right in the breach and
[35:09] say we're brothers we're brothers
[35:11] regardless if we can discern the spirit
[35:13] one another and realize if a man comes
[35:16] in I don't care what church he belongs
[35:18] to he's got the spirit of God on him
[35:21] he's my brother I don't care how great
[35:23] he is I don't care how intellectual he
[35:25] is I don't care how powerful he can
[35:27] speak if he's trying to achieve the
[35:29] wrong thing he's not my brother yet but
[35:32] if we are trying to do if we're trying
[35:34] to save souls and doing something for
[35:36] God then he is my brother
[35:38] if he is a Jehovah's Witness he is still
[35:41] my brother if he is a Pentecostal if he
[35:43] has Holiness if he's assume he's a God
[35:45] if he is Church of God if he has Oneness
[35:46] two in his threeness or whatever it
[35:49] might be it's all my brothers and
[35:51] sisters
[35:52] if we got our hearts right with God and
[35:55] we are trying to achieve the same thing
[35:57] for the kingdom and building the kingdom
[36:00] and then God will honor that now brother
[36:03] so
[36:04] we this is what brother Brenham says of
[36:06] it
[36:07] but the problem is we get stuck on
[36:09] things we get stuck on this one should
[36:11] do that this one should do this this is
[36:13] how things should be and the problem
[36:15] with that is is you've literally come up
[36:17] with a rule book in a non-denominational
[36:19] thing you've come up with a rule book of
[36:22] this is the message the message is not a
[36:24] rule book that's the problem is you've
[36:27] denominated you've how you say that word
[36:29] you know what I'm trying to say
[36:30] you've put you made a denomination out
[36:32] of the message because you have a rule
[36:34] book of you got to make sure you get
[36:36] this this and this and this and if your
[36:37] pastor doesn't do this this and this
[36:38] this away then he's not in the group
[36:40] you're not in the cool kids club because
[36:42] you haven't done it the way I've said to
[36:43] do it and you have a spirit no brother
[36:45] you have a spirit of denomination
[36:48] because you want to make a rule book
[36:50] about what is going to happen here and
[36:52] what is going to happen there every
[36:53] church is different every church is
[36:55] Sovereign and that's the way it's
[36:56] supposed to be it's supposed to be like
[36:58] that for a reason so you can go to where
[37:00] you need to get fed
[37:01] so brother Brenham talks about that as
[37:03] well
[37:04] and he says now so he's talking about
[37:08] I just it's really long so I cut out a
[37:10] piece of it but he's talking about
[37:11] speaking in tongues and someone was
[37:13] making fun of people at um Junior
[37:15] Jackson's church so he says now brother
[37:17] Junior Jackson had a right to disagree
[37:19] with that he wants his church the people
[37:21] all want to speak in tongues and things
[37:23] in the audience that's brother of
[37:24] Junior's troubles that's up to him but
[37:27] brother Junior Jackson believes this
[37:29] message is the same as the rest of us do
[37:32] he is one of us he is not a dead bird to
[37:35] go there Junior Jackson is a man of God
[37:37] that I love with all my heart it is not
[37:40] here tonight so I can really
[37:42] pour it out the way I want to and Don
[37:44] ruddle I don't think Don's here tonight
[37:46] either because they got a church of
[37:48] their own but if I seen every person
[37:51] come to this Tabernacle walk out and go
[37:53] to Don ruddles or brother JT Parnell or
[37:56] brother any anything Brothers here
[37:58] that's our brothers here and fellowship
[38:01] of the Kingdom I'd be so happy I
[38:03] wouldn't know what to do I'd say Lord
[38:05] fill this one up back again and let's
[38:08] pour it out again I'd love it I'd love
[38:10] to see those boys they're my children
[38:13] so he's saying that it doesn't matter
[38:16] what the church is doing so if you read
[38:18] this whole this is in questions and
[38:19] answers number 2 and 64.
[38:22] he's he goes to this whole thing about
[38:24] tongues speaking in tongues and brother
[38:26] Junior Jackson's they speak a lot of
[38:28] tongues and they do a lot of that type
[38:30] of thing
[38:31] so brother Branham literally goes
[38:33] through this whole deal of talking about
[38:35] how you don't speak in tongues here you
[38:36] do hear you don't hear he has this whole
[38:38] list of things the way he wants it done
[38:40] to his church and when he gets to the
[38:42] end of that list he says this that
[38:44] brother Junior Jackson can speak in
[38:46] tongues in his church that's fine he
[38:48] says we can they can do whatever they
[38:50] need to do in that church because
[38:51] they're their own church the all the
[38:53] churches are sovereign but we've come
[38:55] with our complexes and all these things
[38:58] and that's all we can look through
[39:00] because we can't let something go
[39:01] something happened to us that we can't
[39:03] let go someone said something to us or
[39:05] we developed it on our own that we've
[39:07] come up with we can handle these
[39:09] situations the problem is we can't
[39:10] handle any situation we have no control
[39:13] over it and if we push it long enough
[39:16] it's it's a hard one to learn but we'll
[39:19] learn it eventually
[39:21] so
[39:22] to go back to my original scripture as
[39:25] you're thinking why did you read that
[39:28] um Luke 23 42 and he said unto Jesus
[39:31] Lord remember me when now cometh into
[39:34] thy kingdom
[39:36] so we have all these complexes that
[39:37] we've built up people have legitimately
[39:39] hurt us and they've done all these bad
[39:41] things to us and sometimes they haven't
[39:43] but most of the time these are
[39:44] legitimate things that people have done
[39:45] to us they've done very bad things to us
[39:47] and we want them to be handled in a
[39:49] particular way
[39:50] so if we can bring that up Luke 23 42
[39:54] and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me
[39:56] when thou cometh into thy kingdom
[39:58] so if we look at this
[40:00] this is one of the thieves that's on the
[40:02] cross
[40:03] so again with the same theme this guy is
[40:06] on the cross of Jesus
[40:08] so if you read back in Matthew he's on
[40:11] the cross of Jesus
[40:13] and he actually makes fun of Jesus he
[40:15] starts out by making fun of Jesus and it
[40:17] says in Matthew 27 this is out of the
[40:19] Amplified but it says 27 verse 44 the
[40:22] robbers who had been crucified with him
[40:24] also began to insult him in the same way
[40:27] so this guy is on the cross
[40:29] making fun of Jesus
[40:32] while he's on the cross
[40:34] but he says something changes in him he
[40:37] says Remember Me Lord
[40:40] that's all he says he says remember me
[40:42] so we think
[40:44] and if we go to the next verse verse 4
[40:45] to 2 and Jesus said unto him verily I
[40:47] say unto thee today shalt thou be with
[40:50] me in Paradise so we love that right
[40:52] Jesus forgave this guy he's hanging on
[40:55] the cross he made fun of him
[40:58] and he'd done everything wrong so you
[41:01] can go into this whole
[41:02] we don't have time for it but if you go
[41:04] into a study of how they wrote that out
[41:06] they put thieves but they also call it
[41:08] robbers because in robbers you did
[41:11] something bad the Romans would keep
[41:12] crucifixion for the most part for slaves
[41:15] or if you did something against the
[41:16] Roman government
[41:17] so most likely this guy was a terrorist
[41:19] or he had caused death to Romans so they
[41:23] more likely think that he was a
[41:25] terrorist that caused a terrorist act
[41:27] and he killed a lot of Romans
[41:29] so he's on the cross next to Jesus while
[41:31] making fun of Jesus then turns to him
[41:34] and says remember me
[41:36] so we like this this dude did everything
[41:38] wrong
[41:39] and he's on the cross and Jesus says
[41:42] that he today shalt thou be with me in
[41:44] Paradise it's a beautiful thing
[41:47] but if you change it to your life
[41:50] in that cross
[41:52] what about your abuser on that cross
[41:55] what if this is your abuser
[41:57] what if this is the band that stood
[41:59] against your family
[42:00] what if this is the man that did
[42:02] everything terrible to you or the woman
[42:04] that did everything terrible to you down
[42:06] to everything that you can think of if
[42:07] you had a good childhood there's still
[42:09] things people do to you if you had a bad
[42:11] childhood what if that's your abuser
[42:13] what if that's the person that did the
[42:15] most heinous things to you on that cross
[42:17] it starts to change your mind a little
[42:18] bit about this man
[42:20] and you start to think of the people in
[42:21] the crowd as you're standing there's
[42:23] this man's on the cross and he says Lord
[42:26] remember me
[42:27] and then Jesus has the audacity to stay
[42:30] verily I say unto thee today shall thou
[42:32] be with me in Paradise how could he say
[42:34] that this man beat me this man killed my
[42:37] family this man abused me this man did
[42:40] horrible things in my family this man
[42:42] spoke against everything that we stand
[42:43] for you know what this guy has done do
[42:46] you understand that these people turned
[42:48] against the church do you understand
[42:50] that this person did these terrible
[42:52] things to my children do you understand
[42:54] what this man did that's why he's on the
[42:58] cross because he should be on the cross
[43:00] he deserves to be on the cross he's an
[43:03] abuser
[43:04] that's where he should be
[43:07] he should be there but then Jesus thinks
[43:10] that he's okay by saying verily I say
[43:12] unto thee today shalt thou be with me in
[43:15] Paradise
[43:16] why did he say that does he not
[43:17] understand what this man put me through
[43:20] does he not understand that every time
[43:22] we had Christmas it hurt because I knew
[43:26] you were going to steal the toys from me
[43:27] do you not understand that every time
[43:30] you come around I'm worried about what I
[43:32] say because I know you're going to use
[43:33] it against me do you not understand that
[43:36] this is the man that came into our
[43:38] church and changed the whole atmosphere
[43:40] in our church
[43:41] how he poisoned everything that we're
[43:43] trying to do that this is the man that
[43:45] stands against me every time I'm trying
[43:47] to do something good did he not
[43:49] understand that
[43:50] and the short answer is Jesus did
[43:52] understand that
[43:54] and Vengeance isn't yours
[43:56] it's God's
[43:58] you were never supposed to have
[43:59] Vengeance on any of these things
[44:01] but that's the problem is we can never
[44:04] get rid of our thing
[44:06] we've always got this thing with us and
[44:08] we can get little pieces of it we can
[44:10] take little things away we can slowly
[44:12] start to heal up we can slowly start to
[44:14] take things out
[44:16] in to but we still have part of this
[44:19] thing that we can't let go because we
[44:22] don't want to give it to God and we say
[44:23] yes I give them to God but it comes back
[44:25] it came back because you gave it to God
[44:27] on a string you gave it to God and you
[44:29] said here you go you can have that lord
[44:31] I can't handle it anymore take care of
[44:33] it and you start to realize well you
[44:35] know that guy didn't get in any trouble
[44:37] well that guy no one is realizing how
[44:40] bad he is he went to a different church
[44:42] and they love him
[44:43] how can you love that guy you realize
[44:46] what he did in my church and you just
[44:48] pull that thing back lord I mean I tried
[44:51] but you weren't handling it you are
[44:53] handling it so I gotta do what I gotta
[44:55] do you know I gotta handle this thing I
[44:57] gotta make sure that I go to that church
[44:59] and tell everybody Hey listen just so
[45:02] you know I'm just putting it out there
[45:04] I'm just saying I'm not trying to gossip
[45:07] I'm just saying this guy's done some
[45:10] pretty bad stuff in our church I just
[45:13] want you guys to know in brotherly love
[45:15] that's all that's the only reason I'm
[45:18] seeing this there's no other reason I
[45:20] just want to say it because I love you
[45:22] that's why and you pull that thing right
[45:24] back
[45:25] and you can't handle it and the next
[45:27] thing happens and you're in the same
[45:29] situation again Lord here you go Lord I
[45:32] want to let these things go but then you
[45:34] pull it back because whoa Lord you know
[45:37] I gave that thing to you but I kind of
[45:39] thought that guy would get in a bunch of
[45:40] trouble or something like that would
[45:42] happen or you know it's House of burn or
[45:44] if you crashed his car or something bad
[45:45] would happen to him just to pay him back
[45:47] a little bit and you didn't so you bring
[45:49] that thing right back and you hold on to
[45:51] it and you have this thing that you will
[45:54] not let go of because you want it
[45:56] handled in a certain way you want God to
[46:00] do what you think is best
[46:02] but God's ways are not our ways and it's
[46:06] really hard to understand that
[46:09] so we have this man on the cross
[46:11] we've gone through all that
[46:14] he'd done all these terrible things and
[46:16] Jesus lets it go
[46:18] so then you start to think you just let
[46:20] this guy go
[46:22] he didn't say sorry
[46:24] he didn't apologize
[46:26] he didn't even say hey man I messed up a
[46:29] little bit you know kind of sort of you
[46:30] know I'm not saying that you were wrong
[46:33] but I'm saying you were wrong not me the
[46:35] guy didn't say anything right he has
[46:38] done nothing right he did everything
[46:40] wrong he made fun of me didn't apologize
[46:43] for it didn't make anything right and
[46:46] you still let him go to paradise what
[46:48] are you thinking
[46:49] this isn't right
[46:51] this is not how it's supposed to go
[46:53] that's because you've been listening to
[46:54] the world you haven't been listening to
[46:56] the Bible
[46:57] you found these things in your Facebook
[46:59] you found these things in his Twitter
[47:00] you found these things throughout life
[47:02] that have told you well you know that's
[47:05] not fair
[47:06] that's not fair at all
[47:08] this isn't fair it's just not how it's
[47:09] supposed to go is this 50 50. you came
[47:12] up with percentages the Bible never came
[47:13] with percentages
[47:14] if you're going to give 150 give 150 the
[47:17] answer to all these things is love them
[47:19] more you say well he robbed me the Bible
[47:21] literally tells you let him rob you more
[47:23] he sued me give him double what he asked
[47:25] for he wanted my coat give him two of
[47:27] them this dude wants me to walk with him
[47:29] for a mile I'm really tired I ain't got
[47:31] no shoes walk with him for two miles
[47:34] give them more but then we always want
[47:36] to come up with well you know brother
[47:37] you're going to get burned out
[47:39] you got to have balance brother you
[47:41] gotta have balance I completely agree
[47:43] with balance but the problem is you love
[47:45] balance too much you balance your way
[47:48] out of the hard stuff well I'm just
[47:49] being balanced you know it just burns me
[47:51] I want to do things I don't want to do
[47:52] too many things because I want to be
[47:53] balanced about it and I just you know if
[47:55] I keep letting things go people are
[47:56] going to walk all over me I just want to
[47:58] be balanced about it you know I just
[47:59] want to balance everything out you want
[48:01] to balance everything and the problem is
[48:02] you've accomplished nothing because you
[48:04] want to make sure the things you handle
[48:06] the way you want them to get handled and
[48:08] you will disguise it in whatever way you
[48:10] have to to make sure that it's balanced
[48:14] nothing in the Bible tells you to be
[48:17] to be logical nothing in the Bible tells
[48:20] you to be smart about things the Bible
[48:22] tells you to do more I have to be
[48:25] realistic we love this new realistic if
[48:29] I hear realistic one more time I don't
[48:31] know be upset nothing in the Bible told
[48:34] you to be realistic nothing told you
[48:36] nothing told it told you to believe when
[48:38] God walked up on that Shore with two
[48:39] thousand demons he didn't say oh man I
[48:43] really hope this works I don't know hey
[48:47] guy
[48:47] um if you could you know if you think I
[48:51] mean if you're ready if you're ready
[48:52] come down here I just want to have a
[48:54] talk with you put clothes on you know do
[48:57] whatever you got to do I just I just had
[48:59] something to say to you no he walked up
[49:01] on the shore and they came to him and
[49:04] said what are you doing what are you
[49:05] doing why were they doing that because
[49:07] they were scared the demons were scared
[49:10] God wasn't scared but the problem is we
[49:13] walk up with our complexes we weighed
[49:15] ourselves down so far with this
[49:16] complexes we start to walk into these
[49:18] things and we can't understand why these
[49:20] things aren't happening because we're
[49:21] not letting things go we can't walk up
[49:23] to these two thousand demons in
[49:25] confidence we welcome to two thousand
[49:26] demons and we say well you know it's
[49:29] just how it's going to be the rest of
[49:31] your life you got a medical condition no
[49:33] that's not how it's going to be for the
[49:34] rest of your life you know we're just
[49:36] this is the way it's going to go you
[49:38] know if the hopefully the Lord thinks
[49:40] this is the way it's supposed to go this
[49:41] is how it's going to go no it's supposed
[49:43] to go the way that God has it to go and
[49:46] if that's the way that you pray for it
[49:48] to go then it could be the way that it's
[49:50] that it needs to be
[49:52] but we get bound up with these complexes
[49:55] so we come up with all these complexes
[49:59] we come up with all these people should
[50:02] get what they deserve
[50:04] and people shouldn't get what they
[50:06] deserve because if they did you wouldn't
[50:07] be here
[50:08] none of us would be here and I know it's
[50:10] easy for me to say
[50:12] and if you're in church and things might
[50:14] be a little bit different but it's easy
[50:15] for me to say because I come from all
[50:16] this stuff and you start to think well
[50:19] why do they get away with all this stuff
[50:20] why are they allowed to do these bad
[50:22] things and then come in like nothing
[50:23] happened
[50:24] these people struggle with things and
[50:27] they're doing everything that you do
[50:29] with nothing they have don't know God
[50:31] try to do everything you do every single
[50:34] day without God do everything you do
[50:35] every single day without the people in
[50:37] this church
[50:38] you'd be a drug addict you'd be drinking
[50:40] you'd do all the bad things that these
[50:42] people do
[50:43] because we cannot handle it the problem
[50:45] is we constantly think we can handle it
[50:47] we got to make sure hey God just sit
[50:50] down for a second I'll show you how this
[50:51] is done
[50:53] it's not going to go well for you I
[50:55] promise
[50:58] so then we come up with well that's fine
[51:00] Brother
[51:01] you know I can let these things go I
[51:03] mean I've let these things go it doesn't
[51:05] bother me at all
[51:06] doesn't bother me one bit I don't even
[51:08] think about it don't think about it all
[51:10] I let this guy you know he's my brother
[51:12] I love him I let it go when's the last
[51:14] time you talked to him
[51:16] when's the last time you have gone into
[51:19] conversation with any of these people
[51:20] that have hurt you that you've let it go
[51:22] when you walk up to them how much do you
[51:24] hate them
[51:25] and be honest about it we hate people we
[51:28] do we don't understand it but we say
[51:30] things we'll say things like well you
[51:31] know I'm not mad at them you know and
[51:33] they're old and they're they're decrepit
[51:35] and this that and the other and you know
[51:37] I don't have anything against them but
[51:38] if they passed away I mean it wouldn't
[51:40] really mean anything to me
[51:42] don't I mean it's no big deal I'm just
[51:44] saying don't mean anything to me no
[51:47] it should mean something to you that's
[51:49] still a son or daughter of God that is
[51:51] the problem is we constantly want to
[51:53] pull people out of heaven we don't want
[51:54] to put people in heaven we're always
[51:56] well you know I don't want to put them
[51:57] in or out of Heaven well I would just go
[52:00] with they're probably going to heaven if
[52:01] they don't make it well then so what
[52:03] it's fine
[52:04] but if we go with they're probably going
[52:06] to make it to heaven we can start to
[52:08] look at things the right way the way God
[52:10] wants us to look at things
[52:12] so the problem is
[52:14] you won't talk to these people and you
[52:16] say well you know I've let it go brother
[52:17] I just got to be gotta hit my guard you
[52:18] know I just I want to get hurt again I
[52:20] want to this that and the other you came
[52:22] up with that the Bible says 70 times
[52:24] seven times why does it say that
[52:27] it says that because it says keep
[52:28] getting hurt
[52:30] it doesn't say get hurt one time I'm
[52:31] never talking to you again man but I
[52:33] forgive you I'm gonna stand over here in
[52:34] my side
[52:35] I'm not gonna talk to you anymore
[52:36] because you're gonna you're gonna hurt
[52:38] me no it says 70 times seven times it
[52:41] says keep getting hurt and you say
[52:44] Brother Kyle but you know I just I don't
[52:46] want to push it too far so you start to
[52:47] go back into balance again you want to
[52:49] balance things out which again I agree
[52:51] with we should balance things out but
[52:53] we're bouncing too far if you're stuck
[52:55] in this one spot you know I'm just an
[52:57] introvert I'm just introvert that's just
[52:59] not me that's not me I'm just supposed
[53:01] to stand over here in my corner and I
[53:03] just like it I like being alone I don't
[53:06] want to be around other people because
[53:07] I'm an introvert this is my thing
[53:09] no you have something that has hindered
[53:13] you to be an introvert you can be
[53:15] somewhat of an introvert I don't want to
[53:16] say that you can't but I'm just saying
[53:18] when you constantly want to avoid these
[53:20] things it's because you haven't let
[53:22] these things go you haven't learned to
[53:24] let these things go and it's tough It's
[53:27] really tough I can stand up here and
[53:29] tell you to let these things go but how
[53:31] do you do it
[53:32] you have to let give it to God and he
[53:35] has to handle it in whatever way he sees
[53:36] fit and if it's not the way you want
[53:38] which is most likely not the way it's
[53:40] going to go then you have to let it go
[53:43] and if you don't you will always be
[53:45] stuck right there wherever that happened
[53:47] if it's four-year-old you if it's 10
[53:49] year old you a 15 year old you you will
[53:51] walk through life and you will be 50
[53:53] years old and you'll get to his point
[53:54] and it'll stop why does it keep stopping
[53:57] because you won't let the hurt go
[53:59] because you are hurt when you're 15
[54:01] years old because your pastor did
[54:03] something to you when you're 17 years
[54:04] old because someone said something about
[54:05] you when you're 18 years old because
[54:07] someone did something when they were
[54:08] nine and you will always walk back to
[54:10] nine-year-old hurt you
[54:12] you will never make it past that point
[54:14] because you didn't let it go
[54:17] so you say what does it matter I'm not
[54:20] hurting anybody I'm not doing anything
[54:23] I've just got my hurt and I'm I'm happy
[54:25] people say that I'm happy right here I'm
[54:27] just happy in my hurt little world I'm
[54:29] not doing anything the problem is every
[54:32] conversation you have every time you're
[54:34] around somebody that hurt comes out and
[54:36] you don't realize it it's always right
[54:39] there it always wants to come out every
[54:42] time you converse with somebody the way
[54:43] you say things if you can't let go of
[54:45] that hurt that hurt will come out
[54:48] and you could do things to people you
[54:50] have a sword and you have a shield
[54:53] and you can hurt people with that sword
[54:55] you can hurt people that steal because
[54:57] you're holding your thing you can't see
[54:59] through it
[55:00] so you have you're trying to wield your
[55:01] sword and you're trying to hold your
[55:02] Shield but the problem is you can't stop
[55:04] with that sword
[55:06] because you're looking through your
[55:07] thing you know if you would just
[55:08] straighten up if you would just do this
[55:10] it wouldn't have problems anymore
[55:13] if you would just do this and do this I
[55:15] ain't got the problem you got the
[55:16] problem if everyone would just do the
[55:18] right thing I wouldn't have issues
[55:20] anymore
[55:21] no the common denominator is you
[55:25] so you come down to it and this is where
[55:28] I come in my life
[55:30] my dad was a terrible person it just it
[55:34] is what it is
[55:35] in in my dad was never told that he was
[55:39] loved his whole entire life he didn't
[55:41] know how to function
[55:42] and then he had kids and he didn't know
[55:45] how to function and that's why my
[55:47] grandparents had to come get my older
[55:49] brother and sister out of the house
[55:49] because my dad had sold the furnace it's
[55:51] true story so the furnace for drugs and
[55:54] it was cold it was December so my
[55:56] grandparents took the kids out of the
[55:57] house
[55:58] but my dad didn't know how to function
[56:01] he had been hurt so badly in his
[56:03] childhood and he did everything without
[56:05] God he didn't know he did not know what
[56:08] to do and he turned to drugs and that's
[56:10] what he did so it went on we took care
[56:12] of my dad
[56:14] and he continually stole from us and you
[56:16] say Billerica why does any of this
[56:17] matter
[56:18] because if you don't let it go it will
[56:21] ruin your life
[56:22] it will it's the grace of God it's a
[56:25] miracle that I'm here
[56:26] if you don't let it go it will ruin your
[56:28] life so we went on and on with my dad
[56:31] he's stealing constantly stealing guns
[56:33] stealing whatever he could I was buying
[56:35] things from him because he was selling
[56:36] my grandparents stuff to try to get more
[56:38] stuff so I was buying the things from
[56:40] him and he was stealing them from me and
[56:42] reselling them and my grandma was
[56:43] helping them do all these things
[56:45] so we kept going on and on and on so
[56:48] finally he got my brother's debit card
[56:50] and he stole everything on the account
[56:51] it was like four thousand dollars
[56:54] and he said we got mad and we said what
[56:57] are you doing and he said well I'm going
[56:58] to get it back to you
[57:00] it's not a big deal
[57:02] he doesn't make any money
[57:05] he didn't have a plan to get it back he
[57:07] just took it
[57:08] and then he stole a bunch of stuff out
[57:10] of her car so he went to him confronted
[57:12] him about it and we said dad you know
[57:14] what are you doing you can't keep doing
[57:15] this you can't keep doing this and he
[57:17] said you know you kids have always been
[57:18] ungrateful
[57:19] you've been ungrateful your whole lives
[57:21] that's why we have these problems
[57:23] because you're money hungry all you guys
[57:26] want is money it's all you're ever
[57:27] worried about when we're worried about
[57:29] it because we didn't have a house
[57:30] payment to pay for the house that you're
[57:32] living in currently that was the worry
[57:34] big guy
[57:35] but he he blamed it on us it was our
[57:37] fault if we weren't such bad kids this
[57:39] whole time
[57:40] we wouldn't have this problem if you
[57:42] guys would just stop loving money so
[57:44] much I thought you were a Christian
[57:47] I thought you were Christian but all you
[57:49] care about is money as we're cleaning
[57:51] him up because he can't hold anything
[57:53] anymore so we're cleaning up her sheets
[57:54] and he's telling you you're worthless so
[57:57] you hold on to this he's a legitimate
[57:58] things that happen to people and you
[58:00] hold on to this and it makes you angry
[58:02] and you can't function right because you
[58:05] don't know how to love you don't know
[58:07] what love is because you haven't really
[58:09] seen it and you don't want to let these
[58:11] things go because what if somebody does
[58:13] it to me again
[58:14] what if they hurt me again
[58:16] if I let this thing go and let my walls
[58:18] down I have to get hurt again and you do
[58:20] the Bible tells you you have to get hurt
[58:21] again it tells you to get hurt more
[58:23] 70 times seven times it tells you to get
[58:26] hurt more it does
[58:28] so we keep but we keep holding on to
[58:30] these things in
[58:32] I don't it's not a part I want to tell
[58:35] you but I will so we keep going down
[58:37] this road with my dad and we're getting
[58:40] in trouble because he's stealing his own
[58:42] drugs which is weird but we're getting
[58:44] in trouble for it
[58:45] and you're stealing things from us
[58:47] constantly
[58:48] and then it comes down
[58:50] to the end and you think
[58:52] this guy deserves everything he gets
[58:55] when he married my mom he had two
[58:57] children he did not tell my mom about
[58:59] and when they got married he literally
[59:01] said Hey by the bye
[59:04] I kind of have another family
[59:06] just throwing it out there but it'll be
[59:09] fine they're good they're over there we
[59:11] don't have to worry about them no more
[59:12] we'll start a new family
[59:14] and this guy started this generational
[59:17] sin to where everyone is in prison
[59:20] everyone is dysfunctional and it starts
[59:23] from this man he robs from his children
[59:25] he robs everybody he does all these
[59:29] terrible things he does all these
[59:31] terrible things and he deserves to get
[59:33] what he gets he deserves it just like
[59:36] the people that hurt you in your life
[59:38] they deserve it and in the world side of
[59:40] it they do deserve it but the problem is
[59:42] they deserve it just like you deserve it
[59:44] so you keep going
[59:46] and you keep with this hatred I don't
[59:49] care if this guy dies it doesn't bother
[59:50] me one bit I don't care about that
[59:52] person doesn't bother me one bit I don't
[59:53] care what happens to them they did bad
[59:55] things they hurt my family they hurt
[59:57] everybody I don't care I don't care one
[59:59] bit the problem is God cares
[1:00:02] and you don't get to decide who you care
[1:00:04] about and don't care about and the
[1:00:06] problem is if you keep holding on to
[1:00:07] this it will ruin you it'll bring you to
[1:00:10] a point where you walk into a hospital
[1:00:14] and you take a watch off a man
[1:00:17] that abuse you for your whole life
[1:00:20] and you take this watch off of him
[1:00:24] as he's dying
[1:00:27] and they say this is what he's got this
[1:00:28] is his watch
[1:00:30] and you start to think this man deserves
[1:00:32] what he's getting
[1:00:34] he deserves
[1:00:35] what's coming to him and you want to see
[1:00:37] that like it's a satisfaction like when
[1:00:40] this person gets hurt it's going to be
[1:00:43] good for me it's not going to be good
[1:00:44] for you it'll lead you to a hospital
[1:00:46] room
[1:00:47] taking a watch off a man's dying
[1:00:50] and as this man's dying he can't breathe
[1:00:53] because he did too many drugs and he
[1:00:56] smoked too much and his lungs don't work
[1:00:59] so you sit there and watch him
[1:01:01] try to breathe for 18 hours
[1:01:04] and you start to think
[1:01:05] I just want this to end
[1:01:07] but you didn't want it to end you wanted
[1:01:09] it to happen you wanted to make sure
[1:01:11] that they paid for what they did to you
[1:01:13] you wanted to make sure that you've seen
[1:01:15] this thing out this person deserves to
[1:01:17] get this this person deserves it this is
[1:01:20] what I wanted but then when you start to
[1:01:22] go through the punishment that you
[1:01:24] wanted them to get so badly you start to
[1:01:26] realize that the love of God comes out
[1:01:28] and the love of God is telling you I
[1:01:30] don't want this to happen
[1:01:32] I want to stop please make it stop but
[1:01:35] you wanted it to happen so for 18 hours
[1:01:38] this man is trying to breathe and he's
[1:01:42] saying help me because he ain't got no
[1:01:44] help he can't breathe and every 20
[1:01:46] minutes he breaks through his medication
[1:01:48] because his pain tolerances are so high
[1:01:50] that it does not affecting him at all
[1:01:52] so they give him more and it doesn't
[1:01:54] affect him and he pops up and he keeps
[1:01:57] saying Hell with me
[1:01:58] so you get to see this face that you
[1:02:00] wanted to see so bad
[1:02:01] say help me
[1:02:03] but the problem is now you're in the
[1:02:05] punishment side of this and you can't
[1:02:07] handle it because you were never
[1:02:09] supposed to handle it you were never
[1:02:10] supposed to see this part of it but you
[1:02:13] wanted Vengeance so badly that when you
[1:02:15] see it you'll realize that you can't
[1:02:17] handle it and you'll realize that
[1:02:20] no matter what you do this is not going
[1:02:22] well and you'll realize that that face
[1:02:24] you'll wake up and see it all the time
[1:02:26] you wake up and see this person hurt
[1:02:28] when you get that love of God you'll
[1:02:30] start to realize this isn't supposed to
[1:02:32] happen this way I don't want these
[1:02:34] people to hurt I hurt why do you
[1:02:36] continue the hurt it has to stop with
[1:02:39] you you will continue that through
[1:02:40] generations you're looking at Kyle West
[1:02:43] and Nicholson I'm the third generation
[1:02:45] of hurt
[1:02:46] my grandpa's dead my dad's dead my
[1:02:49] uncles are dead the one that's not dead
[1:02:51] is in prison for the rest of his life
[1:02:52] because he murdered a man and he
[1:02:54] murdered a man for the dumbest reason in
[1:02:56] the whole world
[1:02:57] but it's this hurt and it just continues
[1:03:00] on and it will continue on until you say
[1:03:02] no more
[1:03:04] I won't have this anymore and you start
[1:03:06] to realize the real love of God the real
[1:03:09] love of God that just lets it go it
[1:03:11] doesn't matter if they get what they
[1:03:13] deserve it doesn't matter the problem is
[1:03:15] we like to be the Pharisees we like to
[1:03:17] think of the adulterous woman that
[1:03:19] brings us adulterous woman before Jesus
[1:03:21] and they say hey we found her she was in
[1:03:24] the very act so she was more likely
[1:03:26] naked
[1:03:27] what do you want to do with her Moses
[1:03:29] says the stoner they were right
[1:03:31] they weren't wrong
[1:03:34] she deserved everything she got
[1:03:37] she was supposed to
[1:03:38] it's how the rules work Lord you have
[1:03:41] rules we have to follow him God doesn't
[1:03:43] have to follow him God does what he
[1:03:45] wants and the problem is you bring your
[1:03:47] adulterous woman before the Lord and you
[1:03:48] say deal with it but make sure you
[1:03:50] follow these rules
[1:03:52] but the problem is you're the Pharisee
[1:03:54] and you want to say I came to church
[1:03:56] every day
[1:03:57] I did everything I was supposed to do I
[1:04:00] know the scriptures inside now I know
[1:04:02] all this stuff I'm always in Sunday
[1:04:04] school I'm always staying after I'm
[1:04:07] making sure everything gets done the way
[1:04:08] it's supposed to get done and this woman
[1:04:10] shows up and thinks she can do whatever
[1:04:13] she wants to do and there's no
[1:04:14] consequences
[1:04:16] she needs to pay for what she did
[1:04:18] and Jesus says nope
[1:04:21] it's not the way it's going
[1:04:23] she's not gonna have to pay for anything
[1:04:25] she did you're still going to go to
[1:04:27] church you're still going to do all
[1:04:28] these things you're still going to be
[1:04:29] the best Christian ever in your eyes and
[1:04:32] she's not but she doesn't have to pay
[1:04:34] for these things because God said so and
[1:04:37] that part bothers us so bad but the
[1:04:41] problem is God said so in your life God
[1:04:44] said so in all of our Lives whether you
[1:04:47] come through this life
[1:04:48] like ranshack Meshach and Abednego not
[1:04:51] smelling like smoke or you come through
[1:04:53] this life doing all the stupidest things
[1:04:55] you can do I've done the dumbest things
[1:04:57] you can do I've snorted pixie sticks
[1:04:59] it's not a good thing don't do that
[1:05:01] but I've done all the dumb things and
[1:05:04] whether you come out not smelling like
[1:05:05] smoke or smelling horrible smoke it
[1:05:08] doesn't matter
[1:05:09] God is the one to answer that makes the
[1:05:12] rules for what happens and God changes
[1:05:14] them because he's Sovereign and he does
[1:05:16] what he wants
[1:05:17] so
[1:05:18] I'm saying brother why does all this
[1:05:20] matter
[1:05:21] the problem is this matters because
[1:05:23] you're holding on to things as you're
[1:05:25] walking onto a shore
[1:05:27] and you're walking on the shore of life
[1:05:30] and we're going up against two thousand
[1:05:31] demons every single day
[1:05:33] and we want this thing to work but the
[1:05:36] problem is we haven't let anything go we
[1:05:39] want to make sure we get Vengeance for
[1:05:40] every last thing that we do but we want
[1:05:43] to walk up on the shore if you want to
[1:05:44] walk up on the Storm be victorious let
[1:05:46] it go let it go right here right now let
[1:05:48] it go give it to God and whatever
[1:05:51] happens happens don't worry about it
[1:05:53] anymore you want to walk up on this
[1:05:55] Shore and you have a wayward child take
[1:05:57] them back you have sickness take it back
[1:05:59] because I said so because God said I
[1:06:02] could that's why I can come up on this
[1:06:05] Shore and show up with my shield with my
[1:06:08] sword and say devil no more I'm not
[1:06:12] doing it anymore this is done right here
[1:06:15] right now
[1:06:17] but the and that is why it matters so we
[1:06:21] can walk upon that Shore and say go
[1:06:24] if you read the different things that
[1:06:26] Jesus said the one who said a single
[1:06:28] word he walked up against two thousand
[1:06:30] demons and we can't walk up against one
[1:06:32] he walked up against 2000 and said go
[1:06:35] and they said how fast
[1:06:37] we're out of here
[1:06:39] if we let these things go and we let God
[1:06:42] have his way that's how we walk up on
[1:06:44] that Shore that's how we walk up there
[1:06:47] and say devil this is how it's going to
[1:06:49] go it's not going to go how you think
[1:06:51] it's going to go it's going to go like
[1:06:53] this this sickness is gone this child is
[1:06:56] coming back these things are gone these
[1:06:59] things that hurt me are gone this stress
[1:07:01] is gone this depression is gone these
[1:07:04] things are gone because God said they're
[1:07:05] gone and they're gone I'm not bringing
[1:07:07] them back I left it there it's all gone
[1:07:10] we're done with the devil because God
[1:07:13] said so
[1:07:15] and it will be a testimony that you tell
[1:07:17] about getting I don't know if you guys
[1:07:19] want to sing a song it'd be cool if you
[1:07:20] did that it's a testimony that you'll
[1:07:22] tell and you say Brother Kyle but you
[1:07:25] don't understand I know I can never
[1:07:27] understand
[1:07:28] but I can tell you through everything
[1:07:30] that I've been through
[1:07:32] that I can tell you for a fact that it's
[1:07:34] helped one kid
[1:07:35] and I don't know how much has helped him
[1:07:37] but I know it's helped him a little bit
[1:07:39] and I would live every second
[1:07:41] of my testimony over again I wouldn't
[1:07:44] change one single thing and you could
[1:07:45] say how why would you say that you
[1:07:47] wouldn't change anything just one little
[1:07:49] bit no because Kyle wouldn't be Kyle if
[1:07:53] I change any of those things
[1:07:55] did it hurt yeah it hurt the whole time
[1:07:57] did I do a lot of dumb things yeah I
[1:07:59] didn't know how to function with love I
[1:08:01] didn't like it I was locked up for years
[1:08:03] it took my dad dying to get me to come
[1:08:06] out of that locked upness to let them
[1:08:08] walls down that took my dad dying to do
[1:08:10] that I say praise God I would live every
[1:08:13] second of it again if it didn't help one
[1:08:15] person I would live every second of it
[1:08:17] again I wouldn't change one single thing
[1:08:18] because I wouldn't be who I am without
[1:08:20] it
[1:08:21] and that is what love looks like it
[1:08:25] looks like God saying verily I say unto
[1:08:28] thee today shalt thou be with me in
[1:08:30] Paradise that's what love looks like it
[1:08:33] doesn't matter what you've done what
[1:08:35] you're doing I'm not putting people in
[1:08:36] and out of heaven
[1:08:38] God says verily I say unto thee today
[1:08:41] shalt thou be with me in Paradise
[1:08:44] and that's if the musicians want to come
[1:08:47] that's about what I got
[1:08:49] but that's what we have
[1:08:51] leave it here we can leave it here right
[1:08:53] now there's no reason that we can't
[1:08:55] Let It Go
[1:08:56] just let it go let it be a testimony
[1:08:59] that you'll tell
[1:09:00] just let it go
[1:09:01] and you say it sounds so easy because it
[1:09:04] is
[1:09:05] God said give it to me he didn't say
[1:09:07] give it to me with strings he didn't say
[1:09:09] give it to me with this he didn't say

[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:19] praise the lord well we certainly
[1:12:22] been moved into a deeper Dimension and
[1:12:24] what it means to surrender
[1:12:26] by the word tonight
[1:12:28] and listen
[1:12:31] I don't know what title he Has but he
[1:12:34] could call that Divine Love or Let It Go
[1:12:38] and everybody here has something to let
[1:12:40] go of
[1:12:42] we heard that tonight can you say
[1:12:43] everybody here has something to let go
[1:12:45] of some plant that you're holding in
[1:12:47] front and you can only see through that
[1:12:48] plant
[1:12:49] but I'll tell you uh I don't think I
[1:12:52] don't know if too many people more
[1:12:54] qualified to talk about hurts and pains
[1:12:58] and what it means to Let It Go than what
[1:13:00] our brother has tonight not too many of
[1:13:03] us has been through a life quite like
[1:13:05] that and yet God's love is greater
[1:13:09] God loved God's love conquers can you
[1:13:11] say amen and to think that
[1:13:14] any anything storms that we have to go
[1:13:17] through in life
[1:13:19] if we could think of the love of God
[1:13:21] Jesus said let us go over to the other
[1:13:24] side because he before he knew the storm
[1:13:26] was coming how many knows Jesus knew the
[1:13:28] storm was coming disciples didn't know
[1:13:30] the certain was coming you didn't know
[1:13:31] the storms are coming you didn't know
[1:13:33] somebody was going to abuse you you
[1:13:34] didn't know the hard life you'd have you
[1:13:36] didn't know if you would have traded it
[1:13:37] you could you would have traded it and
[1:13:39] yet when you come to the love of God he
[1:13:40] said I wouldn't trade my life
[1:13:42] if it brought him to the love of God but
[1:13:45] Jesus knew why he was going to go
[1:13:46] through the storm and he would go there
[1:13:48] so he could say let us go over to the
[1:13:50] inside we're going to make it over no
[1:13:52] matter what Storm's in the middle and
[1:13:53] you know why he was getting over there
[1:13:55] for one Soul one soul that was had two
[1:13:59] thousand demons in them we're starting
[1:14:01] to learn more and more about this love
[1:14:03] of God how many would raise your hand
[1:14:05] we're starting to know where the depth
[1:14:07] of this love and I want it don't you I
[1:14:09] want it with all my heart and tonight
[1:14:11] you can receive you can let it go you
[1:14:15] can
[1:14:15] I I appeal to you tonight this is not
[1:14:18] just a win the Lord is present Among Us
[1:14:21] he's calling you to a greater life a
[1:14:25] Deeper Life in the love of God he's
[1:14:27] calling you to that and there's a reason
[1:14:29] why you're here tonight there's a reason
[1:14:31] why God's called you to this and he went
[1:14:33] for one Soul on the other side and
[1:14:36] sometimes our life and I'll just say
[1:14:38] this about Brother Kyle
[1:14:39] let me appreciate the word tonight let's
[1:14:41] give let's give the Lord a hand for this
[1:14:43] word
[1:14:44] this is special tonight amen
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:50] sometimes we go through storms that are
[1:14:53] alive
[1:14:54] but God has maybe another soul in mind
[1:14:58] so wouldn't it be fine whatever our
[1:15:00] hurts and pains whatever storms we go
[1:15:03] through
[1:15:03] I would say this whatever I've been
[1:15:06] through and I've been through some of
[1:15:07] the things not similar to him Kyle and I
[1:15:09] are different Lifestyles like day and
[1:15:11] night
[1:15:13] maybe that's why we work well together
[1:15:15] because God's brought all types in the
[1:15:16] body of Christ I lived a pretty
[1:15:18] sheltered life
[1:15:20] but but I have my stuff I have my hurts
[1:15:22] I have my pains people said things
[1:15:24] against me so all of us got to come to
[1:15:26] this Victory to say I got to let it go
[1:15:28] and I gotta love people no matter what
[1:15:30] they've done and I gotta quit putting
[1:15:32] people out of heaven when Jesus my
[1:15:36] master is putting people in
[1:15:40] how much of this do we have in our own
[1:15:42] ranks of finding reasons to put somebody
[1:15:44] out when Jesus was looking for reasons
[1:15:47] to put people in
[1:15:49] but I would love it
[1:15:52] that I would go through all my hurts and
[1:15:54] pains in life and get to the end let it
[1:15:57] all go and I would love it that my life
[1:16:00] would bring one soul
[1:16:04] to the cross
[1:16:06] how may raise your hand if my life I
[1:16:09] live my all my trials all my storms it
[1:16:11] would bring one soul to the kingdom of
[1:16:13] God that'd be worth it to me and that's
[1:16:15] the way Jesus love is he's willing to go
[1:16:17] the whole clear cross for one soul
[1:16:20] I thank the Lord so much praise the Lord
[1:16:23] I'm just going to pray and I just thank
[1:16:25] the Lord for this tonight you you I
[1:16:28] don't care where you're at this evening
[1:16:30] I don't care where you're at
[1:16:32] this is something this was a message for
[1:16:34] everybody everybody he'll find you where
[1:16:37] you're at and like the brother said
[1:16:39] Sunday he'll call you he loves you
[1:16:43] he's calling you just respond to the
[1:16:46] call you don't have to do everything
[1:16:47] right yet you have to do anything right
[1:16:50] just respond to the call and let God's
[1:16:54] love do the rest he loves you tonight
[1:16:57] praise be to God I'm just going to pray
[1:16:59] and then he can sing this song I'll
[1:17:02] testify sing a couple courses of it
[1:17:04] before you go home and
[1:17:07] just to ponder these things we
[1:17:09] appreciate the word
[1:17:10] when I hear things like this he drops so
[1:17:13] many bombs tonight that I want to preach
[1:17:14] on every one of the points continue
[1:17:17] drop some bombs for sure praise the Lord
[1:17:21] Lord Jesus thank you
[1:17:23] we're certainly drawing you're certainly
[1:17:25] real you're here tonight we can't deny
[1:17:27] it and Lord it's by the testimony of
[1:17:30] someone like this impossible Paul in the
[1:17:34] Bible was an impossible Comfort there's
[1:17:36] no way he would come to Christ and yet
[1:17:38] he did some of the most impossible cases
[1:17:41] is the ones that you're trying to call
[1:17:44] because of their testimony
[1:17:47] will bring many others to Christ
[1:17:48] something changed the life that seemed
[1:17:50] like it was unchangeable some somebody
[1:17:53] got Divine love and Let It Go
[1:17:56] when there was absolutely no reason for
[1:17:59] them to let it go they had every right
[1:18:01] to seek Vengeance and your love was
[1:18:04] Stronger it's the greatest force in the
[1:18:06] world may we learn tonight Lord may we
[1:18:08] sit at your feet and learn to love
[1:18:11] nothing comes out of these vessels no
[1:18:14] response except Divine love I pray

[1:18:20] amen praise the Lord God bless you
