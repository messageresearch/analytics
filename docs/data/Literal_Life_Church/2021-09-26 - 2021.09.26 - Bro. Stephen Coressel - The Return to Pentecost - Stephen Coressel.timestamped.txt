[0:00] began to speak with other tongues as the
[0:02] spirit gave them utterance may the lord
[0:04] add its blessing to the reading of the
[0:05] word you may be seated god bless you
[0:07] amen
[0:09] amen
[0:11] [Music]
[0:13] um
[0:15] this scripture right here
[0:17] though it is familiar to us it's an
[0:19] extremely pivotal point in the scripture
[0:21] itself as brother bam taught us the
[0:23] roman catholic church taught that the
[0:25] church started in rome and he said
[0:27] that's not true at all it started on the
[0:28] day of pentecost this was the birth of
[0:31] the church here and what's even more
[0:32] amazing about this scripture was that
[0:34] this was a direct fulfillment of what
[0:36] jesus said about being born of the
[0:38] spirit as it says in john 3 verse 8 the
[0:41] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[0:43] heareth the sound thereof but cannot
[0:46] tell whence it cometh and whether it
[0:48] goeth so is everyone that is born of the
[0:50] spirit of god so see there came a sound
[0:53] from heaven you can hear the wind but
[0:56] you don't know where it's coming where
[0:57] it's going and a rushing mighty wind
[0:59] came that day and they were all filled
[1:01] with the holy ghost amen it was a direct
[1:03] fulfillment of what he was saying amen
[1:06] as a matter of fact in acts 2 verse 14
[1:08] to 16
[1:10] uh the spirit when it anointed peter it
[1:12] came to
[1:14] another scripture that was being
[1:15] fulfilled as peter said in acts 2 verse
[1:17] 14 but peter standing up with the eleven
[1:19] lifted up his voice and said unto him
[1:21] you men of judea and all you that dwell
[1:23] of jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:26] hearken to my words for these are not
[1:28] drunken as you suppose seeing is but the
[1:30] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:33] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[1:35] amen now we're not going to go into the
[1:37] exact prophecy but the next four verses
[1:40] is the prophecy from joel amen and we
[1:43] know when the spirit anointed peter amen
[1:47] the spirit of god don't mess up
[1:49] we mess up he don't
[1:51] and so when he anointed peter here he
[1:53] anointed the exact scripture they were
[1:55] fulfilling at this day
[1:57] it wasn't a surprise to god he knew it
[2:00] was going to happen oh glory to god
[2:03] and you go acts 2 17-21 the exact
[2:06] prophecy is actually from joel 2
[2:08] 28-32
[2:10] amen so that was the fulfilling of joel
[2:13] 2 28-32 but if we go to joel 2. you know
[2:17] what i'm going to ask you to open your
[2:18] bibles this one time okay joel 2
[2:21] there's actually something that is said
[2:23] before verse 28 that i want to show you
[2:26] here
[2:26] in joel 2 and we're going to start at
[2:28] verse 23 amen joel 2
[2:31] and verse 23 it's one of those minor
[2:34] prophets so it could be a little hard to
[2:37] find those books sometimes
[2:39] joel 2
[2:41] and verse 23 watch us here
[2:43] be glad then you children of zion and
[2:46] rejoice in the lord your god for he hath
[2:48] given you the former rain moderately and
[2:50] he will cause to come down for you the
[2:52] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[2:56] in the first month and the floor shall
[2:58] be full of wheat and the thou shall
[3:00] overflow with wine and oil amen watch
[3:04] this in verse 25 and i will restore to
[3:07] you the years that the locusts have
[3:09] eaten the cake worm and the caterpillar
[3:11] and the palmer my great army which i
[3:13] send among you now just to do a little
[3:16] refresher i know you all know about this
[3:18] is that brother bam taught us that was
[3:19] the same type of bug just in different
[3:21] stages just like that horse rider that
[3:23] comes but you notice even though it
[3:25] would eat at it amen it would eventually
[3:28] be restored by the spirit of god
[3:31] but if you notice the positioning this
[3:34] restoration right after that comes joel
[3:36] 2 28-32
[3:38] so when you watch when peter said this
[3:41] is that he never quoted verse 25. he
[3:44] quoted verse 28 to 32 because that was
[3:47] the birth of the church but the the
[3:50] extent of the prophecy in joel is not
[3:53] only the birth of the church but a
[3:54] promise that that same joel 28 to 32
[3:58] would be restored to the church again
[4:00] that it wasn't just going to be dead
[4:02] yeah the bugs are going to show up yet
[4:04] an antichrist spirit would try to
[4:06] destroy it but he said i will restore
[4:09] the years
[4:10] glory to god i'm going to restore
[4:13] pentecost to you
[4:15] that's my title in case you're wondering
[4:17] a restored pentecost
[4:20] amen
[4:21] watch watch what brother graham says
[4:22] here rising of the sun i gave him the
[4:24] quotes and we'll just hope they put him
[4:26] up there for you amen i just feel so
[4:28] religious i just got to keep going
[4:30] just like a freight train we're going to
[4:32] keep going amen hope you want to come
[4:33] along amen
[4:35] brother brahm said this in the rising of
[4:36] the sun 65 he was waved to them the word
[4:40] which it was and waved back to them on
[4:43] the day of pentecost the word made
[4:46] manifest
[4:48] now as i said it is to be waived again
[4:51] in the last day
[4:54] amen this is not just a good suggestion
[4:57] this idea of pentecost and we're gonna
[4:59] get to it a little bit but it's not just
[5:01] a a just a funny feeling see a lot of
[5:04] people have corrupted the idea of what
[5:06] pentecost truly is hey man people
[5:09] thought pentecost was the emotion as if
[5:11] emotion just showed up in 1906 azusa
[5:14] street
[5:15] amen the church has always been
[5:17] emotional
[5:18] amen we didn't just start being
[5:19] emotional amen we've always been
[5:22] emotional amen in job 38 god came to job
[5:25] and said where were you amen when the
[5:27] morning stars sang together and the sons
[5:30] of god were shouting for joy
[5:33] amen we didn't just start becoming
[5:35] emotional the church has always been
[5:38] emotional
[5:40] we've always been shot we always been
[5:42] praising god we've always had a reason
[5:44] to be happy amen
[5:46] [Applause]
[5:47] as brother brahm taught us in job 38
[5:50] amen those sons of god were shouting for
[5:52] joy why he said because they saw the
[5:55] plan of salvation when they looked at
[5:58] the plan they said wait a minute
[6:00] we make it
[6:02] wait a minute we're going to be there
[6:04] amen oh and they started shouting for
[6:06] joy
[6:08] you say brother stephen i don't remember
[6:09] shouting
[6:10] back then
[6:12] no but how do you know you were there
[6:14] how do you know you were shouting there
[6:16] it's because you're shouting now
[6:20] is he in job 38 amen remember we don't
[6:23] believe in pre-existence of souls but
[6:26] god's thoughts are not like our thoughts
[6:27] brother graham said in the church age
[6:29] book amen god's thoughts are real who
[6:32] glory to god god's thoughts are real
[6:35] amen
[6:36] and so that means that when he saw you
[6:39] in this day when you received salvation
[6:42] he knew you were going to do that back
[6:44] then
[6:46] so in his mind he saw you shout for joy
[6:49] amen
[6:51] you're getting emotional then
[6:54] sometimes we need to take a drink of
[6:55] that wine amen and you all know what
[6:57] that wine is it's stimulation from
[6:59] revelation that's why sometimes
[7:01] depression can get to you a little too
[7:03] much amen it's because you haven't taken
[7:05] a drink of the wine
[7:11] jesus came in the third seal
[7:13] he said a measure a week four penny
[7:15] three measures of barley for a penny he
[7:17] said but see thou hurt not
[7:19] the oil and the wine
[7:22] now we know what the oil is right it's
[7:25] the baptism of the holy ghost
[7:27] but that wine is that revolu stimulation
[7:31] from the revelation
[7:33] amen listen we don't believe in telling
[7:35] you how you're going to worship god but
[7:37] you can't tell me when the revelation of
[7:38] god hits you nothing's going to happen
[7:42] if i stick your hand right here and i
[7:44] take a hammer
[7:45] and i go smack
[7:48] there's gonna be a lot of emotion that
[7:49] day
[7:51] hey man
[7:52] see we get so scared about this stuff
[7:54] sometimes
[7:55] we get nervous about it you know why
[7:57] you're getting nervous because the devil
[7:59] can't hurt the wine
[8:01] he can't hurt the oil or the wine he
[8:02] can't touch it glory to god so the only
[8:05] thing he can do though is try to
[8:07] convince you to not take it
[8:10] and if it you think god would tell the
[8:12] devil not to touch something unless it
[8:14] was important to you
[8:17] sometimes we need to get emotional
[8:21] amen don't turn into a dirty word don't
[8:23] don't worry about what everybody else
[8:24] sells you make sure you're right between
[8:26] you and god
[8:27] don't worry about what everybody else
[8:29] says about it
[8:30] don't worry about what other people's
[8:31] opinions about it they're not going to
[8:33] make it to heaven for you who preach
[8:35] your brother stephen i think i will amen
[8:37] we look too much at other people
[8:39] thinking they're going to rapture us
[8:41] somehow
[8:43] thinking man's opinions can rapture us
[8:45] only god can do that
[8:47] [Applause]
[8:51] glory to god you love the lord
[8:53] that was all free we're supposed to be
[8:54] talking about this pentecost here hey
[8:56] man
[8:59] i'm gonna go to this next quote brother
[9:00] i'm also saying the rising of the sun
[9:02] he was waved at the day of pentecost
[9:04] when there came a sound from heaven like
[9:05] a waving mighty rushing wind and was
[9:08] waved over the people the pentecostal
[9:11] people that was up at pentecost waiting
[9:13] for the blessing to come and to be
[9:15] waived again we realized in the last day
[9:18] according to luke 17 30.
[9:20] i've listened to this sermon so many
[9:22] times but i never quite caught that
[9:24] luke 17 30 was a waving over us
[9:28] it was a waving of the original again
[9:32] see we're not just another church age
[9:35] we're not just a church with better
[9:37] thoughts in the church down the road
[9:39] we are a
[9:40] manifestation
[9:42] of seven church ages of all the history
[9:45] of the church we're the results of it
[9:50] i don't know there's a as brother man
[9:52] would talk about in dispensationalism
[9:53] there's the idea of type versus
[9:55] anti-type and i'm going to try to
[9:56] explain it and make it clear as i can
[9:58] because it is it gets convoluted in a
[10:00] theological talk
[10:02] but pretty much what an anti-type is is
[10:04] the result of a type
[10:06] for instance you look at the bible and
[10:07] you see a lamb amen remember um
[10:10] abraham found a lamb caught in the
[10:12] thicket
[10:14] right well the lamb would be a type of
[10:15] what the lame was the type of christ
[10:18] christ would be called the anti-type
[10:21] okay so it's the result of a type it's
[10:23] the explanation of a type amen and did
[10:26] you know there's so many types about us
[10:29] in rebecca
[10:30] and ruth and tamar all these great
[10:33] stories in the bible they're typing us
[10:36] do you know we don't type anything
[10:39] we're the result of it
[10:42] we are the anti-type we were the reason
[10:46] why that was written in the bible
[10:48] you say brother stephen there's got to
[10:50] be more scripture on that i'm so glad
[10:52] you asked
[10:53] there is it's galatians 3.
[10:56] galatians 3 watches here
[10:58] and that as you can tell i don't have
[11:00] this saved so i got to turn to it too
[11:03] but it's galatians 3
[11:07] watches here
[11:08] galatians 3 and verse 16 watches now to
[11:11] abram into a seed where the promise is
[11:13] made he saith not as the seeds as of
[11:16] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[11:19] is christ so when god went to abraham
[11:22] and said your seed shall possess the
[11:24] gate of its enemies amen everybody in
[11:27] that time in the old testament thought
[11:28] of a natural seed called isaac
[11:32] amen but paul is breaking into the mind
[11:34] of god here
[11:36] and saying no it's not that wasn't
[11:38] actually what he was talking about in
[11:39] type but the real seed that was he was
[11:42] thinking about what does logos mean in
[11:44] the beginning with the word the word was
[11:46] with god and the word was god the word
[11:48] logos means thought
[11:50] so when you write a p when you write on
[11:52] a piece of paper there's the thought in
[11:55] your mind
[11:56] that allows you to write it
[11:58] and he's breaking into that right now
[12:01] when god anointed moses right and thy
[12:04] seed the thought in god's mind everybody
[12:07] thought was isaac
[12:09] but paul's saying no that wasn't the
[12:10] thought in god's mind when he wrote that
[12:13] it was christ and guess what there's
[12:16] something else in there because if you
[12:17] go down to verse 29
[12:19] in galatians 3 verse 29 and if you be
[12:22] christ
[12:23] then are ye
[12:26] abraham's seed
[12:28] and heirs according to the promise
[12:31] wait who is the seed then
[12:33] if you're in christ that was you
[12:36] you were the thought in god's mind
[12:39] that when he wrote and thy seed he was
[12:42] thinking about you
[12:44] and that's how he was able to write that
[12:46] word
[12:48] you see these promises that god gave us
[12:50] he doesn't even feel pity towards us
[12:53] amen he saw you
[12:58] he already provided for you
[13:02] and you tell me the church ain't gonna
[13:04] be emotional about that
[13:07] i'm not telling you to work it up i'm
[13:09] saying ask god to give you the
[13:10] revelation of that because i'm not
[13:12] asking you to remember that but do you
[13:15] believe it
[13:17] see that's the next thing we need to
[13:19] start walking in this stuff we've been
[13:21] hearing it for years but we need to
[13:23] start stepping into it and walking in it
[13:26] amen
[13:28] it's like a story brother bam talked
[13:29] about you know
[13:31] oh i believe it is the rising of the sun
[13:33] i may be wrong about that brother
[13:35] he's talking about the trinity and so
[13:36] forth and how the how the trinity is
[13:39] wrong and how it actually works as god
[13:40] being offices and so forth and he was
[13:42] talking to a man
[13:44] at dinner i believe and they were
[13:45] talking and they were saying
[13:47] he was saying do you actually think it's
[13:48] that important
[13:50] to be re-baptized
[13:53] if somebody was baptized named father
[13:54] son holy ghost
[13:55] and brother baby said yeah you should be
[13:57] really baptized because you haven't been
[13:58] baptized at all
[14:00] he said you've been baptizing titles you
[14:02] weren't baptized in a name
[14:03] he said oh but it can't be that
[14:05] important
[14:07] and then he even said why didn't why
[14:08] didn't jesus just say that
[14:11] he said if i looked at you
[14:13] and i said go
[14:15] pay for this and sign the check in the
[14:17] name of the governor of arkansas or
[14:20] wherever they live i can't remember the
[14:22] exact quote now i don't remember exactly
[14:23] where they were eating supper but if you
[14:26] go there and write uh
[14:28] uh signed this check in the name of the
[14:30] governor of arkansas you wouldn't write
[14:33] that would you
[14:35] and he said he said well and he said
[14:36] well he said no you because we are
[14:39] citizens
[14:40] of arkansas
[14:42] we know
[14:43] it's arizona thank you lord i was it was
[14:45] driving me nuts it was arizona
[14:49] it's driving me nuts in my head it's
[14:51] arizona in the name of the governor of
[14:52] arizona because we are citizens of
[14:54] arizona
[14:56] amen we know
[14:58] what his name is
[15:00] so you wouldn't even question me about
[15:02] that
[15:03] and you could tell it pricked that man's
[15:05] heart
[15:06] you could tell it pricked it because
[15:08] brother man said he said oh
[15:12] yeah that makes a lot of sense boy don't
[15:14] it amen see jesus didn't have to say do
[15:17] in the name of the lord he didn't he
[15:18] said he said during the name of father
[15:20] son and holy ghost right because he
[15:21] wasn't talking to the whole world he was
[15:22] talking to people who are citizens of
[15:24] the kingdom that were in god's mind so
[15:27] when he came to use they get baptized
[15:29] from father son holy ghost he said of
[15:31] course it's jesus christ well that was
[15:32] pretty easy why i'm a citizen glory to
[15:35] god i'm a citizen of the kingdom of
[15:37] course i know
[15:39] hallelujah thank you jesus
[15:41] but what was so amazing i like how
[15:43] brother brahm said it that man said oh
[15:45] you could tell he pricked him
[15:47] but brother ram says now here's the next
[15:49] thing
[15:50] will you believe it
[15:52] and that's where that man failed
[15:55] see believing something is more than
[15:58] just accepting it in your mind
[16:01] it's more than just accepting it for
[16:03] conscience sake
[16:04] accepting it for what you know somebody
[16:07] convinced you and you say oh that does
[16:09] sound great
[16:10] but when you start actually believing
[16:12] something it changes your very actions
[16:17] it changes the way you are going to
[16:19] behave
[16:20] amen when you actually believe something
[16:24] that's why he said that's the next thing
[16:27] that man accepted what brother branham
[16:29] said he accepted what brother branham
[16:31] said about the the idea of trinity he
[16:34] accepted it
[16:35] but the man couldn't believe it
[16:38] it didn't change his actions
[16:41] one time me and my brother
[16:43] we went to uh
[16:45] um
[16:46] when i used to live in defiance
[16:48] there was a church planting bible study
[16:51] going on
[16:52] and they actually put an article in the
[16:54] newspaper
[16:55] so me and my brother read it and
[16:57] i looked at andrew saying do you want to
[16:58] go
[16:59] he said sure i'll go yeah let's go
[17:02] so monday night we went to this church
[17:03] planting bible study
[17:06] and uh there was a guy and there was a
[17:08] good 12 14 people there
[17:10] and we and this guy was just doing this
[17:12] bible study well i'm flipping through
[17:13] the pages of the bible study you see
[17:15] where he's going and stuff and i see
[17:17] matthew 20 19. i said there's my chance
[17:20] all right let's go so sure enough he
[17:22] goes to matthew 20 and 19
[17:24] and the man says
[17:26] what he reads matthew 20 19 which we all
[17:28] know and he said what is the name of god
[17:32] so my brother pipes up
[17:34] my brother pipes up and says the name of
[17:36] god is the lord jesus christ
[17:39] that man looked at him said uh uh uh
[17:42] he said read your texts again
[17:44] sure enough somebody else in that bible
[17:46] said he piped up and said father son and
[17:48] holy ghost
[17:49] and he said yup see that's the name of
[17:52] god
[17:53] father son holy ghost
[17:56] you gotta know caresses a little bit so
[17:57] i'm gonna give you a little insight into
[17:58] us okay
[18:01] we both go like this
[18:05] and i start praying
[18:07] i said lord if he asks anybody if they
[18:10] got a question i'll ask him one
[18:14] sure enough my brother beside me he
[18:16] starts praying he says lord i know
[18:18] steven's gonna say something
[18:22] so he said he started praying for me
[18:23] then
[18:24] [Laughter]
[18:26] sure enough just he says does anybody
[18:28] understand anybody got a question whoosh
[18:32] right here right here i got a question i
[18:34] got a question about that
[18:35] i said and i brought it up what about
[18:37] acts 2 38
[18:39] that same man who heard the same guy say
[18:40] father solomon goes went to acts 2 38
[18:42] and completely changed to what you're
[18:44] saying
[18:45] taking baptizing the name lord jesus
[18:46] christ it was crazy what he said it's
[18:48] almost mind-boggling but he said peter
[18:51] was trying to evangelize to jews
[18:54] since the jews were the one that
[18:55] crucified jesus he was trying to push
[18:57] the name of jesus christ to the jews and
[19:00] so he was evangelizing that
[19:02] i said that's funny
[19:04] the same guy who was evangelizing jews
[19:06] but the name of jesus felt it was
[19:07] important to do it in acts 10 when he
[19:09] pushed it to gentiles
[19:11] when he went to a house with gentiles he
[19:14] said you need to get baptized in the
[19:15] name lord jesus christ
[19:18] and so i and i went down the same road
[19:19] that brother manum did
[19:21] i said he said i'm a brother i'm a
[19:23] husband and i told him i said i hope i'm
[19:25] your friend
[19:26] i said but i'm not any of those i'm not
[19:28] that's none of those are my name
[19:30] i said my name is stephen carrussel
[19:33] now this is what came out of that man's
[19:35] mouth
[19:36] washes here
[19:37] he said you're turning god like he's
[19:39] this one big diamond
[19:41] and depending on which way you turn him
[19:43] is the part that you're going to see
[19:46] and i went
[19:48] actually
[19:49] that's pretty good i like that
[19:53] i've actually kept that in my back
[19:54] pocket i said that's a good way of
[19:56] saying that yeah i do think that you're
[19:58] right
[19:59] you know what came out of mouths next
[20:02] he said and that takes away from god
[20:04] being three individual people
[20:08] out of his own mouth came one of the
[20:09] best descriptions of the godhead i've
[20:11] ever heard
[20:13] but what was the next thing
[20:15] he couldn't believe it
[20:18] he couldn't believe it and what does
[20:19] that believing mean he could just accept
[20:21] things in conscience like i said it came
[20:23] out of his own mouth
[20:25] he's the one that said it i didn't say
[20:27] that he said it
[20:28] but the next thing came can you believe
[20:32] it
[20:33] and i'm trying to encourage you about
[20:35] this okay
[20:36] you you've got to start accepting these
[20:39] things that's true amen brother brandon
[20:41] said this in the token he said you can't
[20:43] just
[20:44] believe you got the token you know he
[20:45] said that he said you got to know that
[20:47] you know that you know you got the token
[20:52] make your calling election sir you think
[20:54] you're offending god making sure you got
[20:56] the goods
[20:57] amen don't worry about that make sure
[21:00] you got it god's coming back
[21:02] look at the world right now
[21:04] if it was ever falling apart it sure is
[21:07] now
[21:09] look where we're at friends
[21:11] this will not go on forever
[21:14] and i don't i don't mean to scare you
[21:16] but i'm gonna shake you a little bit
[21:18] this ain't gonna keep going on forever
[21:21] enoch one day was walking with god and
[21:24] the bible says and he was not
[21:27] one day he went from being on earth to
[21:30] not being on earth
[21:33] amen
[21:34] it's gonna happen
[21:36] amen and who's gonna be there those that
[21:39] are filled with the spirit of god
[21:41] that's why we needed a restored
[21:44] pentecost
[21:46] amen and thank you lord he brought me
[21:48] full circle amen
[21:50] watch this here brother man said in the
[21:51] church age book this is why i'm
[21:53] preaching this exactly like this too
[21:55] brother bram said this in the church age
[21:57] book
[21:58] he said in the ephesian church age
[22:00] chapter three he said he that hath in
[22:02] the ear let him hear what the spirit
[22:03] said unto the churches
[22:05] how tragic it is that this first age did
[22:08] not listen to the spirit instead it
[22:11] listened to man see that's the beat
[22:13] right there say i wasn't making anything
[22:16] up was i
[22:17] amen we need to stop listening to all
[22:20] these other voices
[22:21] amen and make sure you're going to be
[22:24] there
[22:25] amen you want to make sure you're going
[22:27] to be there don't ask me
[22:29] go ask god about it
[22:32] see if he says you can listen to the
[22:34] spirit you know what that means the
[22:35] spirit talks
[22:37] oh that was so good praise the lord that
[22:40] means he can still talk amen
[22:42] that means he can still speak amen
[22:49] who listens to nothing
[22:53] who listens to nothing the spirit will
[22:56] tell you he will answer you he will
[22:58] speak to you whether in church whether
[23:00] you're home whether left to hear he can
[23:02] talk to you
[23:06] glory to god
[23:10] how tragic it is that first they did not
[23:12] listen to the spirit instead it listened
[23:14] to man
[23:15] but thank god
[23:17] can you say thank god
[23:19] in the last age there will be a group
[23:22] rise up the true bride of the last day
[23:25] and she will listen to the spirits
[23:29] when the spirit says something she's
[23:31] listening she's already ready she's
[23:33] standing attention amen if god wants
[23:36] this then i'm gonna listen to it
[23:41] watch us here
[23:42] and that day of gross darkness the light
[23:44] will return by the pure word
[23:47] and we will return to the power
[23:51] of pentecost
[23:53] to welcome back the lord jesus christ
[23:57] oh isn't that quote just powerful
[24:00] see we're gonna go back to this we've
[24:02] been restored to it hey man
[24:04] god did it right the first time it was
[24:07] when people started listening to man
[24:09] that started all the persecution all the
[24:11] problems in the church all these false
[24:13] doctrines it's when people started
[24:15] listening to man and not the spirit of
[24:17] god amen
[24:20] that's why we got so many problems
[24:22] hey man people keep thinking they got
[24:24] the answer and so forth and they know
[24:26] more about it than god somehow
[24:29] out like like i've said before like out
[24:31] profiting the prophet how in the world
[24:33] is that going to work
[24:35] i had a man one time tell me he didn't
[24:37] like i said brother graham said all the
[24:39] time
[24:40] and he said what's the difference
[24:41] between you saying it and brother brain
[24:42] i'm saying it if you're both anointed by
[24:44] the holy ghost i said easy i said i'm
[24:46] not malachi 4.
[24:49] god didn't write about my ministry in
[24:50] the bible
[24:52] but this man was going to be so
[24:53] important
[24:54] in these last days
[24:56] that he wrote prophecies about his
[24:59] ministry anointing other prophets to say
[25:02] them malachi is another prophet and
[25:04] malachi was anointed by the holy ghost
[25:07] and said i'm going to send you elijah
[25:09] the prophet
[25:12] identified his even his personality and
[25:15] so forth
[25:17] and no idea what he was going to do i
[25:20] said and god didn't do that for me
[25:22] that's why i quote brother branham
[25:25] amen that's why i'm a message believer
[25:28] amen because it was right here god
[25:30] promised he was going to do it
[25:32] through that ministry he's returning us
[25:34] back to the power of pentecost
[25:37] there's power in the holy ghost this
[25:40] morning
[25:41] you don't have to live the same way you
[25:43] came in
[25:45] there's power there's power to do what
[25:47] to change things that word power and in
[25:50] some instances of the bible that word
[25:51] power means dunamis
[25:54] it's actually the word we get for
[25:55] dynamite
[25:57] did you ever like dynamite before i
[25:58] never had but i've seen pictures of it
[26:00] when you like dynamite guess what
[26:03] things change
[26:06] things are going to change
[26:09] amen and that's what we need brother
[26:11] said in the rising and the rising of the
[26:13] sun he said you are a house a temple for
[26:16] the dynamics
[26:18] amen you have the mechanics in you now
[26:20] you need a spark inside of you to ignite
[26:23] it time to light the dynamite church we
[26:26] need some changing power
[26:28] [Applause]
[26:31] see we
[26:32] my dad always told me if you always do
[26:34] we always did you always get what you
[26:35] always got
[26:37] that's the problem just coming to church
[26:39] sunday and wednesday sunday and
[26:42] wednesday thinking something's going to
[26:43] change no you need to step out of your
[26:45] comfort zone get sparked by the holy
[26:47] ghost and things will change
[26:50] [Applause]
[26:52] glory to god
[26:57] i want to welcome him back
[27:01] when i meet him in the air
[27:03] when i welcome him back
[27:05] it's going to be through the power of
[27:06] pentecost
[27:10] who you love the lord
[27:12] i feel good
[27:14] i think we need some more changing power
[27:15] in our life can you say amen
[27:18] it's not going to happen through our
[27:19] works
[27:21] see what happens a lot of times
[27:24] say you have a besetting sin something
[27:26] you can't stand happen
[27:28] and you sit there and you try to come up
[27:30] with
[27:31] ways to strategize
[27:33] to try to get it out of your life
[27:35] to try to change this circumstance
[27:38] oh let's say like this let's bring it a
[27:39] little closer
[27:41] some of us may have family members who
[27:43] don't believe
[27:44] and you kind of try to think of ways
[27:46] that will save them
[27:48] you try to think of avenues well if i
[27:50] can get them to this special service
[27:51] they might make it who said that
[27:54] remember this church
[27:56] if your true goal is
[27:58] for some of those loved ones to be
[28:00] saved to be filled with the holy ghost
[28:03] your first step is to get out of the way
[28:06] you don't know what that person's gonna
[28:08] have to go through to get saved
[28:11] brother stephen what do you mean how do
[28:12] you know i know
[28:14] because i am a result
[28:16] of that promise
[28:20] thank you lord jesus
[28:23] long time ago
[28:24] when i was still a sinner
[28:26] my dad and my brother ended up fighting
[28:28] about this well no my dad knew about the
[28:30] message for years and i'm not gonna try
[28:31] to get into the whole testimony
[28:33] but my dad got back into the church and
[28:35] so forth and
[28:36] was starting to serve god
[28:38] and his boy out there was smoking and
[28:40] drinking still
[28:42] my dad
[28:44] the what what i love most about my dad
[28:47] my dad would always ask me to go to
[28:49] church but he never it was amazing my
[28:51] dad would never condemn me at all
[28:54] never said a word of condemnation to me
[28:56] all he did was pray
[28:59] all he did was pray for me
[29:01] and through events that he had no
[29:03] control over
[29:04] glory to god
[29:07] he wasn't he just got out of the way and
[29:10] god orchestrated events in my life
[29:13] to bring me to this message
[29:17] so when you start doubting that promise
[29:20] just remember this day there was a
[29:22] preacher up here who's up here preaching
[29:24] because of that promise
[29:28] see we're not just returned to the
[29:30] emotion of pentecostal emotions fine
[29:33] we're not just brought back to the
[29:34] doctrines of pentecost which are just
[29:36] great but we're coming back to the power
[29:40] of pentecost that when you pray when you
[29:42] get down on your knees and you speak to
[29:45] god you know he responds
[29:49] oh i tell you what we got a little too
[29:50] wishy-washy bride we need to start
[29:52] stepping forward the bible says approach
[29:55] the throne of grace boldly
[29:59] quit shrieking back against all these
[30:00] problems step forward and believe it
[30:03] amen
[30:05] we need some more daniels in the church
[30:07] when the whole government said you
[30:09] weren't supposed to pray anymore daniel
[30:11] got on his knees and kept praying to god
[30:14] regardless
[30:17] what i love about that story of daniel
[30:19] praying
[30:20] the bible says his windows were opened
[30:23] now i i thought it was the strangest
[30:25] thing
[30:26] why is the bible even mentioning that
[30:29] you can already kind of tell
[30:31] that he was praying
[30:33] you could read in the bible he's praying
[30:35] and you read in the chapter before that
[30:37] they made a law that you can't pray
[30:40] so you know the circumstances but the
[30:43] bible specifically mentions
[30:45] and his windows were open
[30:48] why
[30:49] i wonder if yeah the windows open
[30:51] because he was hot
[30:55] he was hot
[30:56] you know you ever get there you get hot
[30:58] in a room so far especially in those
[30:59] days
[31:00] keep the windows open to keep it cool in
[31:01] the house
[31:02] did you realize the world was so
[31:05] insignificant to daniel
[31:08] that even when he thought uh think about
[31:11] did the thought even cross his mind to
[31:12] close the windows
[31:14] to hide his prayer
[31:16] it was so insignificant to daniel
[31:20] what the world thought
[31:22] that he's like you know what i'm kind of
[31:23] hot i'm gonna keep the windows open i
[31:24] want to cool down a little bit well i
[31:26] pray to god
[31:28] amen god's a bold man
[31:31] amen even throwing the lines then and so
[31:33] forth like that listen i'm gonna say
[31:35] this sometimes when we read these
[31:37] stories
[31:38] we read them like a children's story
[31:40] book
[31:42] oh isn't that neat
[31:44] wow isn't that neat that god did that
[31:46] i'm here to tell you we're returning
[31:48] back to the power
[31:50] of pentecost
[31:52] god
[31:52] what if there was a lion pit out there
[31:54] today could god still close those lions
[31:56] mouths
[31:58] see it's the same god amen
[32:01] we're not just being returned to the
[32:02] doctrines the emotions we're going back
[32:05] to power dunamis dynamite amen
[32:09] of pentecost
[32:11] glory to god
[32:13] hallelujah
[32:15] see i'm preaching this so you keep stop
[32:18] thinking that pentecost is somehow a bad
[32:19] word say pentecost all of a sudden you
[32:21] get a little nervous who i don't want
[32:24] people to think where i am but let
[32:25] people think what you are
[32:27] who cares you know where you stand
[32:31] one time when i was working back in the
[32:33] elevator i walked in the maiden shop and
[32:34] they looked at me and said look the holy
[32:36] roller's in
[32:37] i said thank you very much i like that
[32:41] i know they don't know what they're
[32:42] talking about
[32:43] hey man i know where i stand so when
[32:45] they call me a whole world i'd wear like
[32:47] a little badge
[32:50] they don't know what they're talking
[32:51] about when people start calling you
[32:53] brandonites don't worry about that you
[32:55] know where you stand
[32:59] and if you don't you better get back in
[33:01] pentecost
[33:02] go find out where you stand
[33:07] i don't know about you
[33:09] but i'm tired of religion
[33:12] i'm tired of religious activities
[33:15] i'm tired of thinking because of certain
[33:17] this certain thing not happening now i'm
[33:19] just gonna fail
[33:21] amen we gotta get back to power
[33:23] when god shows up brother baby taught us
[33:25] wherever god is the supernatural's there
[33:30] shouldn't be so foreign in our lives oh
[33:32] that was good help me god as well that's
[33:35] what i'm saying the supernatural
[33:37] shouldn't be so foreign in our lives
[33:44] so the question becomes now
[33:47] what is pentecost then
[33:50] what is it really watch what brother
[33:52] behind says about pentecost himself
[33:54] brother man said this in jehovah 3
[33:57] listen friends
[33:58] i know they say pentecost they organize
[34:01] pentecost
[34:02] that's wrong
[34:04] pentecost
[34:05] is an experience
[34:08] the methodists get it
[34:10] the baptists get it all of them get it
[34:13] pentecost is not organized it is
[34:15] experienced and if you haven't had the
[34:17] experience of pentecost come receive it
[34:20] now
[34:22] listen god's not holding pentecost from
[34:24] you
[34:26] god's not holding power back from you
[34:28] god's not holding supernatural back from
[34:29] you oh no he's not see i know it's i'll
[34:33] see i feel that little pullback
[34:34] sometimes when i've said this before in
[34:36] multiple locations oh you're trying to
[34:38] you're trying to work up god you're
[34:40] trying to call something of god
[34:43] it's a promise church
[34:46] we you it's not just a good idea to have
[34:49] power in your life it is necessary
[34:53] you know how so necessary is if you've
[34:54] got no power in your life tell me how
[34:56] you got saved
[34:58] i think i said this a couple while ago
[34:59] here actually that's where the lord to
[35:01] me amen you're not saved by good
[35:03] thoughts
[35:04] you can't just sit here and think yes
[35:06] i'm safe yes i'm safe yes i'm safe
[35:08] you're not saved by that at all you're
[35:10] saved by power
[35:11] god came and made a blood for you and
[35:14] broke the blood cell and the life of god
[35:17] now comes back upon the believer which
[35:19] is the life of god the holy ghost itself
[35:22] comes back on you you're not saved by
[35:25] good thoughts
[35:26] i'm going to get a little strict here
[35:27] you're not even saved by a church
[35:30] you're not saved by a church you're not
[35:32] saved by these things you're saved by
[35:34] power
[35:35] [Applause]
[35:39] so there's no power
[35:41] how'd you get saved
[35:43] i know i know
[35:46] see and it's not just good enough to
[35:48] talk about this stuff you know what i
[35:49] mean
[35:50] pentecost is an experience
[35:53] you know billy ramsey said one time
[35:55] he said sometimes i think we get people
[35:57] to a church
[35:59] and not to christ
[36:02] we're not against church functions i'm
[36:04] not talking about any of that okay it's
[36:06] okay to get together and fellowship and
[36:08] be with each other it's actually better
[36:10] than some of the alternatives out there
[36:11] let's be real
[36:12] okay so there's nothing wrong against
[36:14] that okay
[36:15] but be careful
[36:17] some people and young people hear me
[36:20] parents hear me too maybe i'll say it
[36:21] like that teacher young
[36:23] amen
[36:24] these things are not to replace the
[36:27] power of god
[36:29] some people think because they attend
[36:31] the religious activities now they have
[36:34] become religious
[36:36] and that's the problem they probably
[36:38] have they didn't get to christ though
[36:41] hey man
[36:42] these things need to be christ-centered
[36:44] brother baby said if he's the center of
[36:46] the bible then he should be the center
[36:48] of our whole lives
[36:49] about knock the wine over
[36:52] it's all right amen if he's the center
[36:54] of the bible he should be the center of
[36:55] our lives
[36:57] it shouldn't be so foreign i'm preaching
[36:59] on myself this morning just so you know
[37:01] i may have to go to the altar this
[37:03] morning as well
[37:05] we it shouldn't be so foreign to us we
[37:07] need to start accepting this getting
[37:09] into it experiencing it
[37:12] here watch this brother man said this in
[37:13] the token
[37:15] the token 64 paragraph 188 the
[37:17] pentecostals they claim we're a
[37:19] pentecostal organization there is no
[37:22] such thing
[37:24] i like that pentecost is an experience
[37:28] not as an organization they try to
[37:29] organize it but you can't it doesn't
[37:31] organize pentecost is an experience it's
[37:34] the seal of god the holy spirit that
[37:37] comes on the day of pentecost
[37:40] amen
[37:41] see it's an experience you've got to see
[37:44] it for yourself actually we're going to
[37:46] get to that here in a minute
[37:48] brother man said in jesus christ the
[37:49] same yesterday forever 63.
[37:53] and if he will manifest himself here
[37:55] that he is here
[37:57] this very holy spirit that you receive
[37:59] proves that it's him watch it's so
[38:01] powerful
[38:02] pentecost is the only thing is going to
[38:05] prove christianity
[38:07] watches you can't prove it by science
[38:11] you can't prove it by nothing but by a
[38:13] pentecostal experience
[38:15] you baptist know that you methodist and
[38:17] peace between whatever you are you know
[38:20] it takes a pentecostal experience to
[38:23] prove god
[38:25] wow
[38:26] now watch this here
[38:27] and to each individual
[38:30] it doesn't prove the organization it
[38:33] proves the individual
[38:37] see i this is why i keep coming back to
[38:39] this it's not just good enough to talk
[38:41] about this anymore
[38:45] do you know just talking about it
[38:46] doesn't prove god
[38:48] it doesn't prove him real in anybody's
[38:50] life
[38:52] i i've said it like this before
[38:54] anybody in here know who george
[38:56] washington is
[38:58] yeah i bet everybody's hand would raise
[39:00] we all went to first grade didn't we
[39:03] george washington was the first
[39:04] president of the united states you ever
[39:05] heard that old story of him cutting down
[39:07] the cherry tree
[39:08] so forth like that we all know things
[39:10] about george washington
[39:11] he could have went for a third term but
[39:13] he didn't want to be president anymore
[39:14] so he stopped and so forth like that
[39:17] we all know these things but who met him
[39:21] anybody here experience him
[39:23] no why he's dead
[39:26] anybody shake his hand
[39:28] anybody talk to him
[39:29] and this is my point a lot of you can
[39:32] learn a lot about jesus
[39:36] and let's just be let's just bring it on
[39:37] down we're not baptist we're not
[39:38] methodists we're here message
[39:40] you can learn a whole lot about god
[39:43] through this message
[39:45] you can learn that you're not supposed
[39:46] to cut your hair you're supposed to wear
[39:48] skirts that you're supposed to just
[39:49] write how we worship how how this works
[39:52] how that works the proper way to be
[39:53] baptized what the trinity had the
[39:55] correct doctrine of the trinity and so
[39:56] forth like that serpenty boy serpency
[39:59] you can know so much
[40:01] about god
[40:03] and yet never experience him
[40:08] you see what happens a lot of times and
[40:10] listen i'm going to bring into some of
[40:12] your holy ghost-filled people that's
[40:13] what happens a lot of times in your life
[40:15] when you feel like god's so far away is
[40:17] because you started trying to figure out
[40:19] how to fix the problem and not start
[40:22] talking to him about it just as much
[40:25] these experiences don't stop glory amen
[40:28] we just don't get one experience one and
[40:30] none no god wants to talk to you every
[40:33] day
[40:35] do you ever think about this for a
[40:37] second think about how much you want to
[40:39] experience god boy i
[40:41] it's through the roof how much i want to
[40:43] experience god yeah brother brando
[40:45] taught us that he wants to give you the
[40:47] holy ghost more than you could even want
[40:49] it
[40:50] so you think about how much he you want
[40:52] to experience him think how much he
[40:54] wants to experience you
[40:59] we're just all over the place this
[41:00] morning aren't we glory to god
[41:03] you look in the beginning of the bible
[41:04] in creation
[41:06] when adam was made
[41:08] when adam was made god looked down on
[41:10] adam
[41:12] and said he's lonely
[41:14] he named all those animals but there
[41:16] wasn't a mate for him
[41:18] and he was lonely
[41:20] so what did he do
[41:22] to fix adam's loneliness
[41:26] he took out of his side
[41:28] his bride
[41:30] his mate eve
[41:32] and when eve showed up it cured adam's
[41:35] loneliness
[41:37] it cured adam's loneliness so much
[41:40] that even when he knew his wife was
[41:42] wrong he was willing
[41:44] to take on her sin to stay with her
[41:49] i heard a preacher say this one time i
[41:51] i've been trying to find the quote he
[41:52] said brother bram said but i haven't
[41:53] found it but i think it's so beautiful
[41:54] anyways when god saw what adam did
[41:58] he said that god said i want to do that
[42:03] that was the cure to adam's loneliness
[42:07] and brother mom taught us when god was
[42:08] alone he was lonely
[42:11] and so what did he have to do to fix his
[42:13] loneliness
[42:17] you think of how much you want to see
[42:19] god
[42:20] can you hear the tears of god up in
[42:22] heaven waiting for you to talk to him
[42:26] he was lonely back then and so he set
[42:28] this whole drama up so he wouldn't have
[42:30] to be lonely anymore
[42:33] so his attributes he could dwell with
[42:35] his family
[42:36] those thoughts in his mind you're the
[42:39] cure to god's loneliness
[42:41] do you see do you ever under the bible
[42:43] says when we partake of these debris
[42:45] promises we partake of the very nature
[42:47] of god
[42:48] did you do you think god gave you
[42:50] promises out of pity
[42:52] oh well he just wants you to be better
[42:54] than everybody else you ever think about
[42:56] that why did god even give you promises
[42:57] to begin with
[42:59] oh my gosh this is fresh from heaven huh
[43:02] thank you lord jesus
[43:04] why did god ever give you a promise to
[43:05] begin with
[43:07] did you ever wonder because he wanted a
[43:09] fellowship with you yeah
[43:11] do you ever think about that
[43:12] how much does god want to talk to you
[43:15] how much god wants to hang out with you
[43:18] hey man oh and it's good to hang out
[43:20] with each other
[43:21] amen
[43:23] but do you ever wonder how much god
[43:24] wants to be there with you too
[43:27] boy that that humbled me a little bit i
[43:29] don't know about you brother
[43:32] thinking about god's own heart how much
[43:34] he that's why he gave you the promises
[43:37] that's why he wants to have fellowship
[43:40] with you he wants to experience you
[43:44] do you ever you ever look at the walk to
[43:46] emmaus
[43:47] i told you we'd be all over huh
[43:50] you ever think about the walk to emmaus
[43:52] those two men walking down talking about
[43:55] the events that happened
[43:57] and then all of a sudden a man
[43:58] approached them now we know it's jesus
[44:00] in the story right
[44:01] we know it's jesus
[44:03] but we look at that they didn't know it
[44:05] was jesus
[44:07] and so jesus looked at these two guys
[44:09] walking down emmaus and goes hey
[44:12] you know why you so sad
[44:14] what what why you got so sad was
[44:16] something bad happened down the road
[44:17] well there was a bad funeral why you got
[44:19] so sad
[44:20] they said what are you talking about
[44:22] dude
[44:24] don't you know what happened
[44:26] three days ago
[44:28] we thought that guy was the messiah
[44:30] and they ended up crucifying him he's
[44:32] dead
[44:35] you know i just jumped the story didn't
[44:36] i
[44:37] did you not hear what happened in
[44:38] jerusalem
[44:40] did you not hear now here's the little
[44:42] thing
[44:43] you know jesus didn't know what happened
[44:44] in jerusalem right
[44:46] you know why he knew
[44:49] he was there
[44:51] but what did jesus say to him
[44:53] what things
[44:56] did you ever wonder about that jesus
[44:57] knew what happened and now he looked at
[44:59] these two men walking through a maze and
[45:01] saying what happened
[45:03] you ever think about he just wants to
[45:04] hear from him
[45:06] he's just having fellowship
[45:09] oh i say you know church if we're if
[45:11] we're the bride that means we're the
[45:12] cure to god's loneliness
[45:15] i say we start stepping in our position
[45:18] get into this he wants to experience you
[45:21] just as much as you want to experience
[45:23] him
[45:25] have that relationship with god
[45:29] and like he said here to each individual
[45:32] it proves god
[45:35] god can't be proven by just book
[45:36] learning is it good to learn about god
[45:38] of course it is
[45:40] i want to know more about him
[45:42] but that's not going to take you all the
[45:44] way
[45:45] you've got to actually experience god
[45:48] it's not just good about to talk about
[45:50] how god's a healer have you experienced
[45:53] it
[45:54] is it real to you
[45:57] that i'll give you a little test brother
[45:59] brahm said this if you be talked into
[46:01] something you can be talked out of it
[46:05] amen you've got to have the baptism the
[46:07] holy ghost so much that nobody could
[46:09] talk you out of it
[46:11] just like our example with enoch did you
[46:13] notice enoch when he went up he had
[46:16] family
[46:18] he had kids
[46:19] he had parents uncles aunts
[46:22] and he was still willing to walk up to
[46:24] god
[46:26] you hear me church
[46:27] it's it you brother stephen you you're
[46:29] making this sound really serious i sure
[46:31] hope i am
[46:33] sure hope i am
[46:35] amen
[46:37] amen i want to read another quote here
[46:40] watch this i want to get to this one
[46:41] brother abraham said in the trial
[46:44] 64.
[46:45] this is that man who actually ends up
[46:47] going to india and he has that um that
[46:50] indian man said that um muhammad can
[46:52] produce such just as much psychology as
[46:54] your god can the only difference between
[46:57] muhammad and jesus is that jesus said
[46:59] when he came back the works that i do
[47:02] shall ye do also
[47:03] that was the difference between what
[47:05] jesus said when muhammad said but i want
[47:07] to show you something brother brahm said
[47:08] here
[47:10] watch us brother man said this
[47:13] he's talking about that man saying i
[47:14] want to ask you something he said when i
[47:16] was a little boy i had an experience
[47:18] and my mother washed washed and
[47:20] everything to send me to school
[47:22] and i thought surely when i got my ba
[47:26] that i would find christ
[47:28] he said that's when it was given to me i
[47:29] didn't find it when i got my doctor's
[47:32] degree
[47:33] i thought i would find it
[47:34] when i got my lld i thought i would find
[47:37] it he said brother branham i got enough
[47:39] degrees both literal and honorary that i
[47:41] could plaster your walls with them
[47:44] but where's the god of the bible
[47:46] now i'm going to bring this down to r
[47:48] i've read the church age book
[47:50] i've read the seven seals i've heard
[47:52] message preaching
[47:54] i go to a message church i have people
[47:56] in this family as a message listen this
[47:59] this all sounds sometimes we take these
[48:01] stories and don't apply them to
[48:02] ourselves sometimes
[48:04] you can replace all this stuff with all
[48:05] that stuff i just said
[48:07] and you could still end up in the same
[48:09] spot he is
[48:11] where is the god of the bible
[48:14] he said was the teachers wrong who am i
[48:16] to say that the teachers wrong brother
[48:18] ramsey said
[48:19] paragraph 17 well
[48:21] here's what i understand that you turned
[48:23] pentecostal
[48:25] brother braham says well i don't say i
[48:26] believe when i was born in the kingdom
[48:28] of god
[48:29] i automatically
[48:31] was pentecostal
[48:33] because pentecost is not an organization
[48:36] they try to make it but it isn't god
[48:38] will fill a presbyterian a lutheran or
[48:40] whoever you are see it doesn't matter
[48:43] quit giving god your religion
[48:45] and give him he wants you
[48:47] he wants you
[48:49] he wants you as an individual he doesn't
[48:51] want your religion just throw it away
[48:53] the bible says can you be more holy than
[48:55] god
[48:56] could get you just somehow
[48:58] just
[48:59] muster up the holiness and go i'm so
[49:01] holy now
[49:03] that i could talk to god now
[49:05] see god god never wanted that to begin
[49:07] with you understand that
[49:08] god wants you he wants a relationship
[49:10] with you he wanted to manifest himself
[49:13] to you
[49:14] amen not just as lord but as savior
[49:18] healer redeemer
[49:20] father forgiver
[49:23] he wants to manifest these things to you
[49:26] when you have those problems i've
[49:27] noticed this
[49:29] the bible says pray without ceasing
[49:32] it doesn't mean to be on your knees all
[49:33] the time what it means is is to be your
[49:35] default
[49:36] when something happens in your life what
[49:38] do you default to
[49:40] you go talk to somebody else about it
[49:42] you talk somebody in the church about it
[49:43] somebody somebody said something bad
[49:44] about you in the church oh i don't mean
[49:46] to get too close but sometimes somebody
[49:48] do about it sure what you do you start
[49:49] talking to everybody else about it
[49:51] and you forgot the one person you ought
[49:53] to be talking to about it
[49:56] relationship that's what pentecost is
[49:59] and with relationship comes power
[50:02] you see what i'm saying i hope you
[50:04] understand what brother brahms said or
[50:05] brother steven's saying does he
[50:08] that this restored pentecost with the
[50:12] power behind it is what's going to
[50:14] welcome back jesus christ
[50:18] so i'm trying to encourage you
[50:20] if this has been lacking in your life
[50:23] if you've been struggling with those
[50:25] mind battles and so forth is this the
[50:27] reason why
[50:30] have you got too much in the ba
[50:32] too much in the doctor's degree in your
[50:34] mind trying to figure everything out you
[50:36] boy i tell you what message people we're
[50:38] the worst about this sometimes
[50:42] i've had my fair share of counseling
[50:44] meetings i've sat in a lot of those
[50:46] things
[50:47] i remember one time i had i was talking
[50:49] to a brother and he was telling me all
[50:51] this and he didn't feel saved and he
[50:53] didn't feel like he was going to be in
[50:54] the rapture he didn't feel like he had
[50:55] the holy ghost and i looked at him just
[50:57] dumbfounded
[51:00] i said brother i said are you sure you
[51:02] just think too much
[51:06] it's like what do you mean i said well
[51:07] you keep saying all this stuff and yet
[51:10] what i see i don't believe it for a
[51:12] second
[51:14] i said if anybody's got the holy ghost
[51:15] at you
[51:16] i said if anybody's gonna make you in
[51:18] the rapture to be you you've been such a
[51:20] faithful brother you pray for the
[51:21] ministry you pray for these people you
[51:23] give your tithe
[51:25] and your hearts filled with the love of
[51:26] god i've seen what you do and i'm just
[51:28] going i'm so dumbfounded right now i
[51:29] have no idea what you're talking about
[51:32] see we get bad about this
[51:35] we think too much
[51:38] think too much
[51:39] and not talk to god about it
[51:41] i tell you what
[51:43] this is what i'm trying to encourage you
[51:45] about
[51:46] chain i want i want you to
[51:48] i want to challenge you a little bit
[51:51] change your prayers
[51:54] change your prayers
[51:55] quit giving god religion
[51:58] if you got an all in your heart about
[52:01] somebody be real with him
[52:04] you're not hiding it from him oh i i i
[52:06] love you message people so much
[52:09] we always think we're good at hiding
[52:12] we're always just good at hiding we put
[52:14] our little halos in church and we're
[52:16] just all bunch of angels i know better
[52:20] but if so if you really got an issue
[52:24] quit giving god a religion
[52:27] be real with him about it
[52:30] lord jesus i don't know why that brother
[52:32] said that about me
[52:34] it's making me mad
[52:37] be real and don't worry god's going to
[52:39] help you in that because you don't
[52:41] actually want to be like that you don't
[52:43] want to feel like that tell them about
[52:44] it lord i don't want to feel like this
[52:46] but i am god's shown me what's going on
[52:50] so i can have a better spirit about it
[52:53] that's pentecost
[52:56] true that was so good right there that's
[52:59] pentecost
[53:01] when you can have that kind of a
[53:02] relationship with god
[53:05] that you can talk lip to ear to god
[53:08] that you know when you pray when you
[53:11] speak he hears from heaven
[53:15] he's going to answer your prayers
[53:18] what brother ramsey said one time
[53:21] he said every time i pray to god he's
[53:24] either giving it to me
[53:26] and told or told me why i couldn't have
[53:28] it
[53:31] see and that's that's what i want to get
[53:32] to well
[53:33] i love you church so much it's like
[53:35] being at home here i feel
[53:38] i get i only get like this with family
[53:40] folks so i hope you can endure me just a
[53:43] little bit longer amen
[53:45] a lot of times we we treat prayers
[53:49] like we're like we're talking to the
[53:51] president or when we when we talk to god
[53:54] sometimes we think he's an atm machine
[53:58] that you insert the promise then here
[54:00] comes the blessing and then you go home
[54:04] [Laughter]
[54:07] but as brother branham said
[54:10] he either told me i could have it gave
[54:12] it to me or told me why i couldn't
[54:17] this is where i want to get to is that
[54:19] this pentecost is a relationship an
[54:21] experience of a relationship power only
[54:24] comes from relationship
[54:27] amen and you look at this
[54:30] how could some of us handle god saying
[54:32] no
[54:34] do you ever think about that
[54:36] when if god would say no
[54:39] how could you could you could you
[54:40] stomach it
[54:42] there was one time a woman came up to
[54:44] jesus
[54:45] and she wanted her daughters saved or
[54:48] healed
[54:50] and the bible says that she couldn't go
[54:52] to him and said she said thou son of
[54:54] david thou son of david
[54:56] jesus didn't even regard her just kept
[54:58] on walking
[55:00] kept wider walking
[55:02] she kept coming
[55:03] lord
[55:04] i have need of thee
[55:06] lord help me
[55:08] lord help me
[55:09] what did jesus say
[55:12] jesus said
[55:13] is it
[55:14] meat to give the children bread to dogs
[55:18] now think about this for a second i'm
[55:20] getting to a point we're talking about
[55:21] what pentecost is it's a relationship
[55:25] like i said it's not an atm machine god
[55:28] is not an idol
[55:30] amen he's not an idol
[55:34] he has a spirit he is living
[55:38] amen
[55:40] he wants a relationship where you're
[55:42] just as much he's worried about you and
[55:44] you're worried about him
[55:46] amen
[55:48] and he says this kind of thing to a
[55:50] woman brother brahman said if you said
[55:52] some of these pentecostal people i know
[55:54] he said they would run right out the
[55:55] back door
[55:57] call me a dog
[55:59] but what'd she say
[56:01] truth lord
[56:04] she admitted the word was right
[56:07] no matter what he said
[56:09] he's right
[56:11] but i'll even eat the crumbs lord
[56:14] and what did jesus say i mean i've read
[56:16] the bible specifically says if i
[56:17] remember this greatly you forgive me if
[56:19] i'm wrong the bible says he marveled
[56:23] you know what that word marveled means
[56:25] means to wonder in amazement
[56:30] i think i'm blending some stories but it
[56:32] still applies to this woman i think
[56:34] wonders in amazement
[56:37] he went he looked at this woman went
[56:39] whoa
[56:41] i have not seen so great of faith
[56:44] no not in all israel
[56:46] see not even the one you see
[56:49] this is my point here of this whole
[56:51] story
[56:52] it's relationship with god
[56:56] god's not an atm machine he wants to
[56:59] hear what you think about it
[57:01] he wants to hear what you think what
[57:03] you're experiencing what you're desiring
[57:07] amen he wants to talk to you
[57:12] he wants
[57:14] fellowship
[57:16] that's pentecost
[57:18] could you imagine you you know how much
[57:20] god wanted this
[57:21] in the old testament
[57:23] uh when they wanted to meet god only the
[57:25] priest could go in there once a year
[57:28] and it was behind the veil
[57:30] and the bible says when you were before
[57:32] the veil you're even before the lord
[57:35] and he wanted to have fellowship so bad
[57:37] but sin was in the way
[57:39] he cannot come in where sin is at
[57:43] amen he can't touch sin remember when he
[57:44] was on the mountain anything that
[57:46] touched it had to die
[57:48] amen so when he was covered in the veil
[57:51] sin could not enter into that
[57:54] amen
[57:55] so when jesus christ came though and he
[57:58] died on the cross and he said it is
[58:01] finished
[58:02] and he gave up the ghost as soon as that
[58:05] sacrifice was made
[58:08] you were so cleansed by it
[58:11] that the bible says he read the fail
[58:13] from top to bottom
[58:16] as soon as the sing question was settled
[58:20] he said i'm sick of this veil in the way
[58:23] i got to rent this veil amen it didn't
[58:26] do it from the earth to heaven right he
[58:27] did it from heaven to earth means it was
[58:29] a work of god came down stroke it and
[58:31] said here i am i finally can make it now
[58:34] here i want to talk to you i want to
[58:35] hang out hey what are you guys all doing
[58:37] over there
[58:38] he wants that fellowship with you that's
[58:41] pentecost
[58:43] pentecost ain't just an emotion it ain't
[58:45] just a doctrine amen it's power from god
[58:48] the same life
[58:51] that dwelled in him he wants to dwell in
[58:53] you
[58:54] have fellowship with you
[58:56] talk with you
[58:57] walk with you
[58:59] he wants to hear what you think amen
[59:07] you love the lord
[59:09] you're right i got about three more
[59:10] pages but i'm going to read one more
[59:11] quote and i'll be done
[59:14] i just want to say this real quick here
[59:17] that
[59:18] if you bring up that balm and gilead
[59:22] that this pentecostal experience
[59:26] just didn't exist
[59:27] 40 years ago
[59:29] 50 years ago during the pentecost it
[59:32] didn't exist or it didn't just only
[59:34] exist
[59:35] during the times of peter
[59:38] of all these stories of martin luther
[59:41] john wesley we hear about these
[59:44] god has never brother braham said
[59:46] pentecost started with no ending
[59:50] do you know what that means church
[59:53] that means it's still here
[59:56] it's still here and i want you to read
[59:58] this i want to read this quote here
[1:00:00] brother graham said in baum and gilead
[1:00:04] bill abraham said this onto the streets
[1:00:06] they went
[1:00:07] they had the results
[1:00:09] they showed that they've been inoculated
[1:00:11] they showed that something had happened
[1:00:14] all the fear and then talking about the
[1:00:16] day of pentecost now
[1:00:17] all the fear and things had vanished
[1:00:20] away as soon as they got the injection
[1:00:22] of god's toxin of the holy ghost that
[1:00:25] was poured out upon them who if if
[1:00:27] you've been feeling that fear lately
[1:00:29] and listen this world is hanging handing
[1:00:32] it out in droves
[1:00:36] remember this about that covid you know
[1:00:38] why covid was a lung disease
[1:00:40] because that devil's trying to snuff out
[1:00:42] your voice
[1:00:44] he he knows what it means when you talk
[1:00:46] to god so if you can get the breath out
[1:00:48] of you you can't talk to god no more
[1:00:50] amen that's why he's attacking the
[1:00:52] breath in you amen i say if he's trying
[1:00:54] to attack our breath then we ought to be
[1:00:56] able to say it louder then
[1:00:59] boo devil i'm still talking to god
[1:01:03] i'm still going to speak to him
[1:01:07] that's why he's attacking here he's
[1:01:08] trying to get you to be quiet i said
[1:01:10] we'd be louder then amen that devil
[1:01:12] don't like it hear this then amen
[1:01:15] oh my glory to god that's why we need
[1:01:18] that toxin when that fear is coming out
[1:01:19] of this covet and this world handed this
[1:01:22] see it's getting worse church
[1:01:25] you got to be careful i was just talking
[1:01:27] to brandon about theirs in the office
[1:01:28] i've noticed this lately that depression
[1:01:31] spirit has been getting stronger and
[1:01:33] stronger than it's ever been
[1:01:36] i remember sars back in 06. i remember
[1:01:40] bird flu this kind of spirit never
[1:01:42] happened
[1:01:44] but this kobe thing when they started
[1:01:46] trying to shut things down said things
[1:01:47] like that has caused such an isolation
[1:01:51] when you get by yourself that's when you
[1:01:53] start fearing
[1:01:54] that's when you start getting depressed
[1:01:56] and anxiety and you get all nervous
[1:01:58] what's going to happen you know when
[1:02:00] those stuff come in god's got enough
[1:02:02] medicine for you this evening morning

[1:02:07] of the holy ghost get back in the word
[1:02:09] of god get back in pentecost amen get
[1:02:12] back in the spirit of god

[1:02:19] it's only going to get worse church
[1:02:23] i'm going to tell you something and this
[1:02:24] is maybe this is attack caresology i
[1:02:26] call it
[1:02:27] my opinion
[1:02:30] just think if this is the extent how
[1:02:32] much farther can they go at this point
[1:02:35] huh
[1:02:36] it's only going to get worse i'm not
[1:02:38] trying to scare you i'm trying to tell
[1:02:39] you there is an inoculation to that fear
[1:02:43] there is something you can do about it
[1:02:46] and look for the world for the answer
[1:02:49] god's got the answer for you
[1:02:51] god can still speak to you and take that
[1:02:54] fear out of your heart by pouring into
[1:02:56] you his perfect love
[1:03:00] guess what he still loves you hallelujah
[1:03:03] even when you get caught up in that
[1:03:04] stuff and you start getting that
[1:03:05] depressed spirit you know he never left
[1:03:07] you yet
[1:03:09] even when you think you left god guess
[1:03:11] what he still holds on to you
[1:03:13] he doesn't let go the bible says you
[1:03:16] were in the palm of his hand
[1:03:18] can a mother forget her child he said
[1:03:20] yay she might but i won't
[1:03:24] he's never forgotten about us
[1:03:26] he wasn't surprised about covet he knew
[1:03:28] it was gonna come amen you need to step
[1:03:31] up and believe that
[1:03:37] you need to get rid of that depression
[1:03:38] and that fear in your heart
[1:03:41] god's coming for us
[1:03:42] he still is holding on to you even if
[1:03:45] you feel so lost right now and so
[1:03:48] depressed about these things
[1:03:50] he's never let go of you yet
[1:03:53] thank you lord jesus
[1:03:56] as butler branham said we're not holding
[1:03:57] on to our religion our religion's
[1:03:59] holding on to us
[1:04:02] glory to god get back in that holy ghost
[1:04:06] amen get back to where you were first
[1:04:08] saved
[1:04:09] get back in that spirit of god get back
[1:04:12] to pentecost
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:19] i want man
[1:04:21] let me finish this part of the quote
[1:04:23] poured upon them it made them slobber
[1:04:26] stammer
[1:04:28] act like a bunch of drunk people
[1:04:30] but they were receiving new life
[1:04:33] god was placing his life into that 120.
[1:04:36] they screamed they shouted they spoke in
[1:04:38] tongues they run they acted like drunk
[1:04:40] people because they were inoculated
[1:04:42] can i say something here
[1:04:44] this is my hopefully my final statement
[1:04:47] he's not just talking about in the
[1:04:48] church
[1:04:51] you can do this at home
[1:04:53] amen i actually i'd be nervous it
[1:04:56] happened in church every time then i
[1:04:57] start questioning some things but
[1:04:59] whenever you need an inoculation it's
[1:05:01] always available no matter where you act
[1:05:04] i'll give you another testimony one time
[1:05:06] i was driving i worked for an elevator
[1:05:08] and um i don't know if you ever seen
[1:05:10] this big three wheel farm vehicles
[1:05:12] they're really tall gators that's right
[1:05:14] and and they they they are floaters
[1:05:16] that's what they're called they're
[1:05:17] supposed to they have big wide tires
[1:05:20] one time i was listening to brother bram
[1:05:21] and that floater and i mean this is a
[1:05:23] big vehicle
[1:05:25] i could crush your car i really could
[1:05:28] and i was striving and brother bannon
[1:05:29] said something that just so blew my mind
[1:05:33] that i i went somewhere
[1:05:35] while i was driving down the road 35
[1:05:37] miles per hour
[1:05:38] i don't suggest this
[1:05:42] like right now everyone's going to go
[1:05:44] home and start doing it i'm not
[1:05:45] suggesting this
[1:05:46] but god came down
[1:05:48] into that little floater's cabin
[1:05:51] and i don't know what happened
[1:05:54] but i was gone for 30 seconds
[1:05:56] i know i was because i was down to the
[1:05:57] next stop sign
[1:05:59] and i was speaking in tongues i was
[1:06:02] rejoicing i was just like god i'm so
[1:06:04] thankful for this
[1:06:06] and he kept that floater on the road i
[1:06:08] didn't hit anybody matter of fact when i
[1:06:09] came to
[1:06:10] i was breaking
[1:06:13] stopping at a stop sign
[1:06:15] and i went
[1:06:16] what see that's pentecost
[1:06:20] i'm not saying that to glorify myself
[1:06:22] what i'm saying is it's available to all
[1:06:23] of you
[1:06:25] what i'm saying is if god did it for me
[1:06:27] he can do it for you sometimes you need
[1:06:29] that to happen in your life
[1:06:31] you need that inoculation
[1:06:34] yes it should happen in church but i
[1:06:36] also say it should happen at work
[1:06:38] sometimes too
[1:06:39] when a married couple may be getting a
[1:06:41] little feuding and stuff like that and i
[1:06:43] listen we'll be real with you when
[1:06:44] husband and wife starts getting to
[1:06:46] feuding you know what sometimes you need
[1:06:47] you just see an inoculation of the holy
[1:06:49] ghost
[1:06:50] grab each other by the hand and say lord
[1:06:52] bring the holy ghost down we need you so
[1:06:54] much more
[1:06:57] if you have an ought with the brother
[1:06:59] grab them by the hand and say we're
[1:07:00] going to pray that the inoculation comes
[1:07:03] you ever seen drunk person before and
[1:07:05] i'm not proud of this but i have been
[1:07:06] drunk in my life and but what brother
[1:07:08] ram says absolutely true when you see a
[1:07:10] drunk person they're in love with
[1:07:11] everybody
[1:07:13] they are
[1:07:14] they they don't even think about any
[1:07:15] problems they don't even think about uh
[1:07:17] all the issues other people have said
[1:07:19] about them they don't care about any of
[1:07:20] it all they just love everybody
[1:07:22] that's what we need an inoculation of
[1:07:24] the holy ghost
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:27] amen you love the lord
[1:07:30] as the musicians come may we just bow
[1:07:32] our heads for a prayer
[1:07:34] most gracious kind heavenly father lord
[1:07:37] i just want to thank you lord for your
[1:07:38] holy spirit
[1:07:40] i thank you lord for the anointing of
[1:07:42] god
[1:07:43] that this little body accepts and
[1:07:45] receives from you lord
[1:07:47] that they hear from heaven lord i just i
[1:07:49] just feel so overjoyed in my heart lord
[1:07:52] it's even hard for me to speak these
[1:07:53] words right now
[1:07:55] i thank you lord for this assembly
[1:07:58] i thank you lord for its pastor and all
[1:08:00] the associate ministers and their
[1:08:02] musicians and the people here lord what
[1:08:05] a wonderful atmosphere lord
[1:08:08] for your spirit to come down
[1:08:10] and to still minister unto us what you
[1:08:13] what you would want us to hear
[1:08:16] for lord even myself
[1:08:18] though i was the speaker there was
[1:08:20] things that i said
[1:08:22] that really struck my heart
[1:08:24] that i'm asking you lord god will you
[1:08:27] help me
[1:08:29] i've been failing in this lately lord
[1:08:32] that when i have a problem or an issue
[1:08:35] i'm forgetting what my default is it's
[1:08:38] prayer to you lord it's a pentecost amen
[1:08:43] that i can even be inoculated of the
[1:08:46] holy ghost even in my office lord
[1:08:49] that i can have it anywhere i seek it
[1:08:52] you'll be there
[1:08:55] though we may have let go lord you have
[1:08:58] not let go of us lord
[1:09:00] and we are truly humbled by it god
[1:09:03] we are so thankful lord
[1:09:06] how much you desire of us
[1:09:10] help us lord to
[1:09:11] not neglect our relationship with you
[1:09:14] anymore lord
[1:09:16] brother branham taught us we backslide
[1:09:18] every day
[1:09:20] and i wonder if that backsliding is
[1:09:22] based solely upon our relationship with
[1:09:25] you
[1:09:26] it's not so much religious activities
[1:09:28] and so forth
[1:09:30] but we're backsliding a lot of times in
[1:09:32] our relationship
[1:09:34] with you god
[1:09:36] and lord maybe ask us a little assembly
[1:09:39] though some may have been continuing and
[1:09:41] maybe they feel all right and some feel
[1:09:44] like they can do a little repentant we
[1:09:46] can all admit together that we want to
[1:09:48] be closer to you lord
[1:09:52] that we want to do a little bit of a
[1:09:53] rededication in our hearts oh god
[1:09:57] to stop looking at the world lord
[1:10:00] to stop looking at all this coven
[1:10:02] nonsense
[1:10:04] to stop stop paying attention to
[1:10:06] entertainment so much and and what's on
[1:10:09] our computers and our phones lord our
[1:10:12] phone's not gonna rapture us the news is
[1:10:14] not going to rapture us but pentecost
[1:10:17] will
[1:10:19] that spirit of god dwelling in our souls
[1:10:22] setting our souls of fire lord
[1:10:26] that's what will clean us that's what
[1:10:28] will cleanse us that's what draws us
[1:10:31] closer to you lord
[1:10:33] as the bible declares draw nigh unto god
[1:10:36] and he will draw nigh unto you
[1:10:40] so lord as i speak for myself i want to
[1:10:43] rededicate myself as well oh god
[1:10:47] i ask you lord forgive me for my sins
[1:10:52] i look at myself a lot of times and i
[1:10:54] just
[1:10:54] think failure but lord i know god that
[1:10:58] you have never failed
[1:11:01] and we just need another pentecost in
[1:11:03] our lives oh god
[1:11:06] help us dear jesus
[1:11:10] may we start speaking to you
[1:11:13] in a relationship
[1:11:15] as you said on the walk of emmaus what
[1:11:17] thanks
[1:11:18] i wonder if the spirit of god is saying
[1:11:21] that to some people in here this evening

[1:19:45] when he was in sabino canyon with those
[1:19:47] brothers
[1:19:48] and he ended up the lord told us to grab
[1:19:50] a rock and throw it in the air
[1:19:52] he said he grabbed the rock through in
[1:19:54] the air when it came down and made the
[1:19:55] whirlwind and god dwelled in the
[1:19:57] whirlwind
[1:19:58] he said but see god was telling me i
[1:20:01] gotta do something
[1:20:04] see you're not an idol either in case
[1:20:06] you're wondering you're not a robot

[1:20:10] automatically because you showed up here
[1:20:12] this morning but you got to do something
[1:20:16] you got to show that you believe in amen
[1:20:20] if that word is true if god is coming
[1:20:23] back in the rapture and you still have a
[1:20:25] doubt about the baptism of the holy
[1:20:27] ghost you got to step forward and do
[1:20:30] something about it then
[1:20:34] you got to step forward you got to step
[1:20:37] out from the pew you got to stand as the
[1:20:39] bible says if you stand for me then i'll
[1:20:42] stand for you
[1:20:45] you got something to do
[1:20:47] grab the rock bride throw it in the air
[1:20:52] if you want something to change in your
[1:20:54] life then you got to do something about
