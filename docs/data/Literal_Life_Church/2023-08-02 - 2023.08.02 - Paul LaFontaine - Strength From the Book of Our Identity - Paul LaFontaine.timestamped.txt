[0:00] brother Jesse and your wife and family
[0:02] good to see you glad to have heard you
[0:04] were coming and uh if I'd known you were
[0:07] in Baltimore I was at the Baltimore
[0:08] Airport Monday I could have brought you
[0:10] over myself
[0:11] uh you would have had to jump in the
[0:13] plane but I could have brought you
[0:14] myself
[0:15] amen make sure you agree brother Jesse
[0:17] and his wife uh and family there I don't
[0:19] know how long they're here but uh he's a
[0:22] good brother in visiting from Mexico
[0:23] it's good to have them
[0:25] amen Revelations chapter 5 and verse one
[0:28] and after this I looked and behold a
[0:32] door was opened in heaven
[0:33] and the first voice which I heard was as
[0:36] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[0:39] said come up hither and I will show thee
[0:41] things which must be Hereafter and
[0:44] immediately I was in the spirit and
[0:46] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[0:49] one sat on the throne how many were
[0:51] sitting on the throne
[0:53] one sat on the throne and he that sat
[0:57] was to look upon like uh
[1:00] uh like Jasper
[1:02] and a starting Stone Sergeant Stone and
[1:05] there was a rainbow you see do I have
[1:07] the right scripture here no I'm in I'm
[1:09] in four okay why didn't somebody yell at
[1:12] me
[1:13] and I saw the right hand of him that sat
[1:16] on the throne a book written within and
[1:18] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:20] this is good because in number chapter
[1:23] four you have the throne set in heaven
[1:25] one sitting on the throne and now the
[1:27] theme of chapter five is my theme
[1:29] tonight now we have a vision of a book
[1:32] all right we have a vision of a book and
[1:35] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:37] on the throne a book written within and
[1:39] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:42] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:45] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:47] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:49] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[1:52] under the heaven was able to open the
[1:54] book neither the look thereon and I wept
[1:56] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:59] open and to read the book neither to
[2:01] look thereon and one of the elders say
[2:03] unto me weak not behold the line of the
[2:05] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[2:07] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[2:10] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and
[2:13] low in the midst of the throne and of
[2:15] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[2:16] Elder stood a lamb as he had been slain
[2:19] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[2:22] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[2:24] into all the Earth and he came and took
[2:27] the book out of the right hand of him
[2:29] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[2:31] taken the book The Four beasts and Four
[2:34] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[2:36] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[2:38] golden vials full of olders which are
[2:40] the prayers of the Saints and they sung
[2:43] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy so I
[2:46] want you to notice now the opening of
[2:48] this book now they're singing a new song
[2:50] things have changed this is a transition
[2:52] in John's Vision this is a transition it
[2:55] was about him sitting on the throne and
[2:58] then we know that Jesus walked in the
[3:01] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[3:04] for seven Church Ages which brother Rapp
[3:06] is dealing with that on Wednesday night
[3:07] a couple Wednesday nights he'll pick
[3:08] that up again but he was we know one
[3:11] like the son of man Christ was in the
[3:13] midst of the seven in church ages but
[3:15] but but the the vision changes now and
[3:18] the emphasis becomes a book that that
[3:20] lamb has to go get and so that's the
[3:23] emphasis but notice the results of just
[3:26] him taking this book Christ that is they
[3:28] sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[3:31] to take the book and to open the seals
[3:32] or for thou was slain and that's
[3:34] redeemed us to God now this is all the
[3:37] people responding to this taking of the
[3:41] book They're responding saying praise
[3:43] the Lord You've redeemed us to God by
[3:46] thy blood out of every Kindred and
[3:48] tongue and people and Nation you all
[3:50] came from a lot of stuff you come from a
[3:53] lot of backgrounds
[3:55] and it's the grace of God and his
[3:56] Redemptive power that you're here
[3:57] tonight
[3:58] can you say Amen so they're starting to
[4:01] shout and rejoice because you've
[4:03] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[4:06] every Kindred tongue people nation and
[4:08] has made us unto our God Kings and
[4:11] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[4:13] I want you to notice as I speak on
[4:16] tonight the strength and the Book of our
[4:18] identity their identity changed because
[4:20] they came from all this stuff but now
[4:23] they've seen their I did this book must
[4:25] be a book of identity because when they
[4:28] seen their new identity we're not we're
[4:30] no longer the background that we come
[4:32] from we are Kings and Priests
[4:35] this is the book of identity and when
[4:37] they begin to see that they seem they
[4:39] have their new identity in Jesus Christ
[4:41] or their original identity and not only
[4:44] have you made us Kings and Priests
[4:46] that's our new identity but we have
[4:48] power to rule and Reign on the Earth
[4:53] so power and strength come from looking
[4:57] in this book
[4:59] father bless your word tonight and we
[5:01] thank you for the trip that we got off
[5:03] and we're thankful to be home we we're
[5:06] thankful for the fruits that you've
[5:07] brought from the ministry and even here
[5:09] Lord Brother Stevens true and all that
[5:11] you're doing by your Holy Spirit here
[5:13] locally we thank you Lord for it and we
[5:16] want to be a part of it we want to just
[5:18] settle in and listen to your voice
[5:19] tonight as Christians and we just commit
[5:22] the evening to you in Jesus name amen
[5:25] God bless you as you take your seats
[5:27] tonight now this is a vision of John and
[5:29] it's it's a vision that's very important
[5:31] to all of us in this time it it has some
[5:35] elements to it worth teaching and taking
[5:37] a little time on tonight and actually
[5:39] this is linked together with what I was
[5:41] speaking before I left into the young
[5:43] people at the camp and that was talking
[5:45] about young girls and young guys being
[5:47] strong young girls in this age being
[5:49] strong to the wrong type of guy young
[5:52] guys being strong to the wrong type of
[5:53] girl but all of us are praying for more
[5:56] strength in the word of God that we
[5:58] could be strong in our convictions that
[6:00] we can be strong in our hearts that we
[6:02] can be strong against the wave of sin in
[6:05] this generation
[6:06] we don't need to be weak we need to say
[6:08] Lord make me stronger be strong in the
[6:11] Lord in the power of his mind so not
[6:13] just young people all of us say Lord
[6:15] make me strong by Revelation and so this
[6:18] will be related to that in that I got in
[6:21] was that the camp I just got into
[6:23] identity a little bit and something
[6:24] really opened up to me it might be
[6:26] simple tonight but we can't uh we can't
[6:29] Overlook the subject of true identity
[6:31] without looking at this book of
[6:32] redemption that is being open to us here
[6:35] in Revelations 5 because it's everything
[6:37] it's everything
[6:38] I don't care who told you your identity
[6:41] I don't care what your mom and dad said
[6:44] I don't care what the world has told you
[6:45] I don't care what you come from all of
[6:48] that was washed away now this book has
[6:50] your true identity this book of
[6:52] redemption tells you who you really are
[6:55] and I asked the kids I said if I were to
[6:57] ask you who are you you'd probably give
[6:59] your name well I'm Sam I'm Gideon I'm
[7:01] William that's what people answer but
[7:04] you see now who you are is deeper than
[7:06] just your name
[7:08] you would have to keep talking and tell
[7:10] me your personality I have to watch you
[7:11] for years but in Christ your identity is
[7:14] actually deeper than your personality
[7:16] deep in the deeper than the way God Made
[7:18] You deeper than your your looks can you
[7:21] say Amen but even your looks were
[7:23] predestinated by God can you say Amen
[7:25] even though mannerisms God made you the
[7:27] way you are but so I want you to notice
[7:30] now when we talk about this book your
[7:33] identity you have to stay in the word to
[7:38] keep God keep letting God unpeal the
[7:41] layers of to get to the depth of your
[7:43] identity it's not just your personality
[7:46] it's not just your name it's not just
[7:49] who you think you are it's not just oh I
[7:52] know myself after 30 40 years I know
[7:54] myself I'm this one no you have to keep
[7:56] looking in the word because this goes
[7:58] beyond your personality this is who you
[8:00] are in the might of God before the
[8:03] foundation of the world
[8:05] when you start to look at it really look
[8:07] at it power and strength come in your
[8:10] life
[8:13] you got to stay in this word
[8:15] and this this sermon will end tonight
[8:18] hopefully with the value of the message
[8:20] because if you think the message is just
[8:22] a gathering of a bunch of message
[8:24] churches and it's a kind of like another
[8:26] movement just like the Seven Day
[8:27] Adventist or whatever if you think that
[8:29] about the message you don't know what
[8:31] this message is
[8:34] because resident within the books of
[8:36] this message is this revealing of This
[8:39] Book of redemption
[8:41] this is the most important thing of your
[8:42] life can you say Amen and so maybe
[8:45] that's what make you feed on better but
[8:46] so now the the vision of John maybe
[8:49] would just look at it tonight and maybe
[8:52] for some of you this is revisiting the
[8:54] subject of this book it was one sitting
[8:56] on the throne he and and so then he's
[8:59] sitting on the throne in chapter four
[9:01] I'm glad I read that and then chapter
[9:03] five introduces a book that's in the
[9:06] hands of this one sitting on the throne
[9:07] and so after Christ is seen for 2000
[9:10] years in the midst of the candlesticks
[9:12] with not really any specifics it's just
[9:15] the condition of the churches brother
[9:16] rap is dealing with this Sardis and
[9:18] laodicea and Philadelphia he's dealing
[9:21] but but the son of man is there in the
[9:24] midst of the candlesticks and he's
[9:25] working in the people but there's no
[9:28] specific action uh in vision of where
[9:31] our lamb is until Revelations 5 when the
[9:35] book comes into view and when the book
[9:37] comes into view by the vision there's a
[9:39] book here and when the book is here then
[9:41] the lamb steps forth into the into this
[9:45] Vision so there's something related to
[9:47] this book and you and our lamb because
[9:50] he's in the midst of the candlesticks
[9:52] but now when the book is is present and
[9:54] when there's seven seals on it our lamb
[9:57] as the way brother around says it our
[9:59] lamb steps forth into this vision
[10:03] very significant thing
[10:06] but it's about the book The Lamb shows
[10:08] himself again he shows up at the end he
[10:11] steps forth into this new vision of John
[10:13] and in in this vision and Christ being
[10:16] there is related to this book and he
[10:19] actually then he takes the book because
[10:22] he's the only one I want every 13 14
[10:25] year old 10 year old to be listening
[10:27] tonight because I'm going to make this
[10:28] as basic as possible
[10:30] there's a book here and Christ takes
[10:33] this book that sealed with Seven Seals
[10:36] and it's because he's the only one
[10:38] worthy to take this book and tear off
[10:41] what's holding it up so we can see
[10:44] what's inside Jesus is the only one
[10:47] who's worthy to look at that book and
[10:49] open it up for us and in this Vision he
[10:51] does and that's why everybody gets
[10:53] excited
[10:55] you know it must be exciting you know
[10:57] when you when you have if you if you
[11:00] were the beginning of your life and
[11:01] there was already a biography about your
[11:03] life and there was a book about it and
[11:06] the title was Paulo fontaine's life
[11:08] I'd say you'd be curious if you were
[11:11] given a book and it's already got your
[11:12] life in it you'd be curious to read that
[11:16] can you say man wow it's already there
[11:19] that makes it easy
[11:21] and you'd be very curious I'm going to
[11:23] tell you tonight we should be very
[11:25] curious about what's in the Lamb's Book
[11:27] of Life
[11:27] we should feed on the word can you say
[11:30] Amen we should be feeding on this
[11:32] message and our Bibles because because
[11:34] it's not just we're learning uh how to
[11:38] to to live right that's it's beyond that
[11:40] there's an identity in Christ in the
[11:44] word that you have to know to receive
[11:46] strength
[11:48] that's what this message is
[11:50] so this book is closed it's sealed up
[11:53] with seven Mysteries around it and if it
[11:56] would be like the old Scrolls that's
[11:58] what the way their book was then you'd
[11:59] have seven straps around it sealed up
[12:02] and so if you in the vision now Christ
[12:05] would have to take it and tear off seven
[12:07] straps open up the scroll on the table
[12:09] and we finally get to look and see
[12:11] what's inside our book is more like
[12:13] looks like this tonight and so that
[12:16] would be seven straps across it and you
[12:19] couldn't see what's in the inside it's
[12:20] sealed with seven Mysteries it's sealed
[12:22] up so we couldn't we couldn't tear off
[12:25] anything to look inside ourselves we are
[12:27] unworthy to do that why were we unworthy
[12:30] because at the beginning we fell with
[12:32] Adam
[12:33] so this book got lost Adam had it it got
[12:36] lost and went back to it didn't get lost
[12:38] and went back to the hands original
[12:39] owner Adam lost it and then God put
[12:41] Seven Seals on it and until the end time
[12:44] he says then the only one worthy to do
[12:46] it is the Lamb to tear the seals off and
[12:49] finally the people of God will get to
[12:51] look in the inside and see what it is
[12:52] it's at the end time we get to look at
[12:55] the words in the book
[12:59] and it's a book of identity can you say
[13:01] Amen so now so now you can't see the
[13:05] contents because it's sealed with seven
[13:07] Mysteries around it and so now in in
[13:11] Revelations chapter 5 all the attention
[13:14] turns to this book of redemption we
[13:17] wouldn't expect that I thought it was
[13:19] going to turn to Christ well it does
[13:20] turn to Christ but it's an action this
[13:23] book comes into play this book of The
[13:25] Mystery of God of your identity it comes
[13:27] into play because this book was with
[13:29] Adam he lost it went back in the hands
[13:32] original owner it's got to come back to
[13:33] the people again and so now this book is
[13:36] important it's not just about I believe
[13:38] Christ I believe he went to Calvary
[13:40] that's what most of the Christianity
[13:42] believes I believe in the Lord and I
[13:44] don't knock that praise the Lord but now
[13:46] as you look to the end time there's
[13:47] another action and the book comes into
[13:50] play that Adam lost the book is at the
[13:53] Forefront of this vision and our lamb is
[13:55] in the vision he has to step forth into
[13:58] this vision and all the elders around
[14:00] them and they're they're all weeping and
[14:02] John's weeping because none of the
[14:04] elders Peter Paul all the Patriarchs of
[14:08] the Bible as good as they lived and as
[14:10] great a prophets as they were none of
[14:13] them have the worthiness to take this
[14:15] book and break it to us
[14:17] and then he says John
[14:20] stop weeping
[14:22] because the lion of the tribe of Judah
[14:24] has showed up in this vision
[14:28] the worthy one has showed up
[14:31] that's why they switched from weeping to
[14:33] rejoicing because somebody's Worthy
[14:36] this is the way it's worded if this is
[14:37] the way it's worded by the prophet if no
[14:40] one come and take took this book all of
[14:42] creation would be lost
[14:44] why is that because he's the one that
[14:47] redeemed everything
[14:48] and he's going to finish Redemption he
[14:50] may have saved your soul but when he
[14:52] died of Calvary he's redeeming this
[14:54] entire Earth from sin
[14:56] and so all of creation would be lost and
[14:58] we would stop someday and it's it would
[15:01] be all be over and done and all the
[15:03] creation would be lost so the book held
[15:06] the key to sons of God getting it back
[15:08] into their hands so he could finish
[15:10] Redemption he can't finish Redemption
[15:14] until the bride has this book and can
[15:17] see her true identity
[15:19] this whole world all of creation is
[15:23] completely lost until this lamb takes
[15:25] this book breaks the seals often and his
[15:28] bride begins to look into it and come
[15:30] back to Sons and Daughters of God of God
[15:33] again all creation will be lost unless
[15:34] that happens pretty important book
[15:38] pretty important message
[15:40] well I thought it was just the preacher
[15:42] with the seventh grade education and
[15:44] everybody makes a big rah-rah over it
[15:46] you don't even know what the message is
[15:48] I thought this was a dress code and I'm
[15:51] getting tired of the dress you thought
[15:52] the message was the dress code
[15:56] hello
[15:58] you thought the message was don't chew
[16:00] gum in church
[16:03] I'm telling you the early years in the
[16:05] message and one preacher said it my
[16:06] earliest years the message what the
[16:08] message meant to me is stuff like don't
[16:09] chew gum in church that was the message
[16:11] to him and he said Lord I'm glad I
[16:14] stayed with it because my goodness it's
[16:16] so much more than don't you come in
[16:18] church
[16:19] there's so much more to this it's not
[16:21] some man with a seventh grade sixth
[16:23] grade education no he would use he would
[16:26] use this as a as the surface but what
[16:30] he's wanting to do is get this book of
[16:33] redemption of identity back into the
[16:35] hands of the people
[16:39] I might shot a little bit tonight on
[16:40] Wednesday night this is pretty exciting
[16:42] so now all the attention turns to this
[16:45] book all the elders must have knew what
[16:48] it was in it because everyone got real
[16:50] happy when the lamb had it in his hand
[16:53] everybody started to get happy the
[16:55] prayers are going up everything's there
[16:57] everybody got extremely happy they were
[16:59] weeping before and now they're happy
[17:02] because they know there's some contents
[17:05] in that book they can't get to but they
[17:07] need to get to it and our lamb is worthy
[17:09] to open it they knew when he had it in
[17:11] his hand they knew he was going to tear
[17:13] the seals off they know he was going to
[17:16] open it up and he was the only one
[17:18] worthy no wonder they're getting happy
[17:20] somebody's going to open this identity
[17:22] to me somebody's going to reveal this to
[17:24] me and it's my Lord
[17:26] it's my land the lion of the tribe of
[17:29] Judah has prevailed
[17:31] he's going to open this book glory be to
[17:34] God
[17:35] we get to see what's in the inside
[17:38] everybody got happy why it was why why
[17:40] did they get so happy because this book
[17:42] was related to them it was the subject
[17:45] of them
[17:47] there was a connection to Christ with
[17:50] this book if they had come to the Altar
[17:52] for two thousand years in the church
[17:54] ages and the preacher preached Christ
[17:56] and they came to the altars I received
[17:58] Christ as my personal Savior and I I
[18:00] received the Redemptive work he did at
[18:02] Calvary that Soul was saved right there
[18:04] if they sincerely believed it can you
[18:06] say Amen so so but so and that's
[18:08] wonderful I'm not knocking that that's
[18:10] that's what happened for 2000 years but
[18:12] but you see now they didn't really know
[18:15] there was a connection to Christ
[18:17] themselves by a spirit Union that none
[18:20] of them didn't know that they just I
[18:22] accept what Christ did for me my sins
[18:24] have been washed away but when they the
[18:27] elders knew when this book is present
[18:29] and it gets unsealed that's my
[18:32] connection that I am a part of Christ
[18:39] this is the way brother Brandon said it
[18:41] Christ is the book of redemption and the
[18:45] bride is the words in the book
[18:49] that's what he said about this book of
[18:51] redemption Christ is the book he says
[18:54] well I thought Christ was the lamb there
[18:56] and the original owners on the throne
[18:58] and you had Christ and then if you're a
[18:59] trinitarian you're trying to figure it
[19:01] all out to split not into three no no
[19:02] this is a vision it's it's a parable
[19:05] it's a vision it's a it's not a parable
[19:07] but it's it's playing out something and
[19:08] so you don't divide and make God a
[19:10] trinity by a vision because that vision
[19:12] would never meant uh match up the rest
[19:15] of the Bible that he's won
[19:17] the original over became Christ the lamb
[19:19] can you say Amen so if you've got a book
[19:21] and brother says the book of Christ yeah
[19:23] it's the revealing All Through the Bible
[19:25] of Jesus Christ but we have to if we
[19:27] have a lamb step forth he is a bloody
[19:30] lamb he's been to Calvary and also he's
[19:33] he's been hit with it throughout the
[19:35] church ages remember the Bible said that
[19:37] after he rose again to set at the right
[19:40] hand of the authority of God and then
[19:42] he's the intercessor uh for 2000 years
[19:45] he's an intercessor for the sins of the
[19:47] people for 2000 years so he's a bloody
[19:50] lamb not only from Calvary but now all
[19:52] the sins of the people would be absorbed
[19:53] by him through the ages that's why when
[19:55] he steps in this Vision he's a bloody
[19:58] lamb a lamb that has been slain
[20:01] so but don't try to say well he said
[20:03] he's the words in the book well who is
[20:05] Christ then it's Christ happened in the
[20:06] vision he'd be the one that have to take
[20:09] this book but the revelation of who he
[20:11] is throughout the ages is is this book
[20:14] this book and guess what Christ is the
[20:17] book and the bride is the words in the
[20:21] book
[20:25] if you had a book that was all wrapped
[20:27] up
[20:29] and uh
[20:31] maybe it was wrapped up in a present or
[20:33] something
[20:34] and you heard that the title of the book
[20:37] was
[20:38] the complete revelation
[20:41] of who you really are
[20:43] for dummies no I better leave that part
[20:45] out
[20:46] the complete revelation of Who You Are
[20:49] For Dummies might as well go ahead and
[20:50] say that because we were dumb
[20:52] we're dummies

[23:51] thing it's the it's the best book in the
[23:54] world
[23:55] for your life
[23:57] and so we should show a craving in our
[23:59] hearts for this book
[24:01] I want to hear it it reminds me of when
[24:03] I receive the holy ghost at 16 years old
[24:05] the one thing I knew was an Evidence of
[24:07] the holy ghost in my life is I had a
[24:09] such a huge vacuum and craving for the
[24:12] word of God I couldn't get enough of it
[24:14] not just conventions not just services
[24:16] but that message and I said if God if
[24:19] God is it true that God would send a
[24:23] messenger to my language and my age with
[24:26] a spirit of Elijah if that's true and
[24:29] God did all that work to send him and he
[24:32] sacrificed and he did it and then he
[24:34] died and went on to his reward if if God
[24:37] did that then I ought to take a little
[24:39] bit of my life and find out what it says
[24:43] I had to lay everything else aside and
[24:45] after work I can tell you I've had a
[24:47] bunch of cassette tapes and after my job
[24:49] that I had at that siding company I come
[24:52] home for about four or five years and
[24:54] usually every day after work I listened
[24:57] to this message which I needed that
[24:59] foundation in my life to do everything I
[25:01] do today but I fed on it because that's
[25:03] why I said if God sent this and more the
[25:05] more I read it I knew God had to send
[25:07] this not a man and I read it and I read
[25:09] it guess what I didn't just see the
[25:11] identity in the position of William
[25:12] Branham I didn't just see God could work
[25:14] through a man I've seen God could work
[25:16] through me as a Son of God I said I
[25:18] could come into my position I said I see
[25:21] my identity in that book
[25:24] this is more than just some books and
[25:26] dates
[25:27] this is more than an app on your phone
[25:30] that's why I hated being an app because
[25:32] everybody has the same you got tons of
[25:34] apps on your phones and just another app
[25:35] don't you ever let it become another app
[25:37] you punch that app on your phone more
[25:40] than all the rest of them and if you
[25:41] have to delete other apps make that app
[25:43] the priority turn that voice on listen
[25:46] to the message of the hour because
[25:47] you're not going to get just some
[25:48] denominational thing you're going to get
[25:51] your identity revealed to you somebody
[25:53] say praise the Lord
[25:55] this is a book that's revealed at the
[25:57] end time with your true identity
[26:02] and I love it praise the Lord
[26:04] so the complete Revelation who you
[26:06] really are for dummies
[26:09] we could get excited about that
[26:11] but there's no Next Step until he opens
[26:15] it so we can get curious all we want to
[26:18] but God has to open it Christ had to
[26:20] open it and until it gets unsealed and
[26:23] handed to us there's no further steps in
[26:25] our Christian walk until it gets
[26:28] unsealed and he hand it to us but see
[26:30] then there's a worship there's an
[26:32] excitement because it's in the hands of
[26:34] the one worthy to break it open they're
[26:36] excited because they know he will open
[26:37] it he has opened it and when he opens it
[26:40] we get to look inside
[26:43] the the biggest thing that we catch here
[26:46] is it must be a book of identity because
[26:50] they say they are redeemed out of what
[26:53] they were from every Kindred tongue
[26:57] Nation people look at that look at that
[27:02] and they changed their identity from
[27:04] what they came from
[27:06] what they were raised in
[27:09] this book made them begin to believe
[27:13] I'm not what I came from
[27:16] I'm not what I came from
[27:19] that's why we don't have things of
[27:21] cultures and things we don't you know
[27:22] it's just like we have our culture but
[27:24] it's like we don't make that the gospel
[27:26] can you say man because it gets washed
[27:29] away for the most part we don't say well
[27:31] this culture better than another culture
[27:32] and always we don't get into racism or
[27:35] anything it's none of it is of god can
[27:37] you say man because why we have another
[27:39] identity that we just don't identify
[27:42] from with the country we come from
[27:43] Nigeria or Mexico no no we've got a
[27:47] whole new identity that puts us all in
[27:49] the same ground can you say amen and
[27:51] they looked in there and says oh blessed
[27:54] be the name of the Lord we've come from
[27:56] all of this from our past but now we
[27:58] realize we're not that we're Sons and
[28:01] Daughters of God we're Kings and Priests
[28:03] unto God this is a book of identity
[28:06] because before this was opened they did
[28:08] not see themselves as Kings and Priests
[28:11] they see themselves as Christians they
[28:13] had accepted Christ but you don't hear
[28:15] too many writers saying and proclaiming
[28:19] strongly that he has made us Kings and
[28:22] Priests until this moment
[28:29] so and then it's a revealing of their
[28:33] true identity and then with it King
[28:35] Power how many believe that when someone
[28:38] has their true identity revealed the
[28:40] true identity power comes with it
[28:43] and I don't mean just power to to zap
[28:45] the devil it's power over the enemy but
[28:48] it's power to live Who You Are
[28:52] and so the power they've seen in the
[28:54] word was that he's made us Kings and
[28:56] Priests there's a whole study on what
[28:58] you become as a king in Priest that's a
[29:00] great position he's called you to but
[29:02] now we're not only Kings and Priests but
[29:04] he's made us to rule and Reign on this
[29:08] Earth I always like to interpret that as
[29:10] being that Adam when he ruled in reigned
[29:12] on the earth nothing controlled Adam he
[29:15] controlled things the weather did not
[29:18] control Adam he controlled the weather
[29:21] he named the animals there was nothing
[29:23] on Earth that controlled him so now
[29:25] modern day times when a Son of God comes
[29:28] into his place he prays with his God and
[29:30] there's nothing on this Earth that would
[29:32] control us we pray and God in us
[29:35] controls it
[29:37] sexual passions if they're under the
[29:39] control of the Holy Ghost in your life
[29:40] they don't control us we control it
[29:43] finances don't control us we control our
[29:46] finances with the Lord's help
[29:48] that sons of God coming into their place
[29:51] so ruling and reigning is what they've
[29:54] seen now I see it now I see I mean
[29:56] redeemed back to ruling and reigning on
[29:59] this Earth I'm not some grasshopper that
[30:02] Joshua and Caleb said were more than
[30:04] able to take the land and all the ten
[30:06] others five says we're like grasshoppers
[30:08] in their sight and in our sight as well
[30:10] we're grasshoppers we don't have a
[30:12] chance we'll always be grasshoppers he
[30:14] said we're not grasshoppers Joshua games
[30:16] we're not grasshoppers they've seen
[30:18] their identity we're Sons and Daughters
[30:20] of God the promise of this hour see
[30:22] they've seen their name in the word even
[30:24] back then they caught a revelation we're
[30:26] not grasshoppers God said we can take
[30:29] this land
[30:33] call the revelation of their name in the
[30:35] book and the book wasn't even totally
[30:36] open yet but they called little
[30:37] Revelation said I am not a grasshopper
[30:39] here friends
[30:41] I have the power to take this land
[30:45] because God's Prophet set is mine
[30:48] Hallelujah so there's strength in seeing
[30:53] your true identity young people hope
[30:55] you're listening
[30:56] older ones I hope you're listening your
[30:58] strength in the Lord
[31:00] is not because you shouted and danced
[31:04] if you're a Christian long enough you'll
[31:06] probably shout and dance and that's good
[31:07] I have I did it this weekend at camp we
[31:11] we were shouting man
[31:13] but your strength in the Lord is not in
[31:16] shouting and dancing
[31:18] it's in knowing your true identity in
[31:20] the word of God
[31:22] but the devil doesn't like is you
[31:24] finding your drug and you walk stable
[31:26] with with with confidence in God I know
[31:29] where I stand here and if I got
[31:30] something that's impossible I serve in a
[31:33] god of the impossibilities I'm going to
[31:35] go to Paramount Grabber my hand the
[31:36] hands of my family I'm going to pray for
[31:38] them right now we're going to get
[31:39] through this and God will step on the
[31:41] scene it's boldness can you say man it's
[31:44] strength it's not weakness I'm not
[31:46] afraid of any devil when you know who
[31:49] you are you're not afraid of any devil
[31:52] there's strength and true identity
[31:54] why didn't we have this book of
[31:56] redemption to start with
[32:01] I'm glad you asked him
[32:05] I'm glad you asked because our father in
[32:08] reality did have this book of redemption
[32:12] he held it it was in Adam's hands guess
[32:16] what
[32:17] knowing who he was as the Son of God
[32:19] gave him Power To Rule and Reign on this
[32:21] Earth Adam never never had
[32:24] Adam never had a former identity like
[32:29] you and I have
[32:31] did you realize that
[32:32] Adam only knew himself by the book
[32:35] by the book and his identity as the Son
[32:37] of God he knew I was created right from
[32:40] the Breath of God he didn't have a
[32:42] former identity he didn't have a mom or
[32:45] a dad that put him down and told him
[32:47] you'll be nothing in life he never had
[32:49] that he only knew his true identity
[32:52] praise be to God
[32:54] he had the title need he had the book in
[32:57] his hands he knew who he was right from
[32:59] the start and that's why he had power
[33:01] over the elements that's why he had
[33:03] power over life because it was in his
[33:05] hands knowing who he was as the Son of
[33:07] God gave him Power To Rule and Reign
[33:09] Adam never had a former identity he
[33:12] started with the right identity I wish
[33:13] all of us could have done that but we
[33:15] didn't start with the right identity and
[33:17] that's why a lot of us even went and
[33:19] sinned you realize that's why you went
[33:21] and lived in sin because you didn't know
[33:23] who you were
[33:25] you can never go back to a life of sin
[33:28] when you know truly who you are in
[33:30] Christ you'll never do it it's the power
[33:33] over sin
[33:35] I could never do that to my Lord can you
[33:38] say Amen
[33:39] identity is the power to everything the
[33:42] reason you went into sin the reason your
[33:43] life was messed up he had children out
[33:46] of wedlock whatever happened divorce all
[33:48] these other things that come from all
[33:49] the fruits of the world why did I do
[33:51] that Lord I wish I had a perfect
[33:53] testimony like so and so in the church
[33:55] and you know come and ask me there isn't
[33:57] anybody in the church with the perfect
[33:58] testimony
[34:00] we were all born in sin
[34:02] the cleanest kid in this church that's
[34:04] never done anything wrong which we don't
[34:06] have anybody if you thought they were
[34:08] perfect they were born in sin like you
[34:10] were have all the potential for sin in
[34:12] them born with a serpent nature can you
[34:15] say Amen
[34:16] they were born in sin and so all of us
[34:18] that's why I say he said well I come
[34:21] from a real dysfunctional family they
[34:23] were dysfunctional and they were bad no
[34:26] guess what we all come from a
[34:28] dysfunctional family and parents Adam
[34:31] and Eve so we all come from a
[34:33] dysfunctional
[34:38] praise the Lord I'm having a good time
[34:40] tonight
[34:42] you all come from dysfunction
[34:45] you're all messed up
[34:49] preacher's not supposed to say that he's
[34:51] supposed to be positive without Christ
[34:53] you're a mess
[34:54] you are all messed up well I've lived a
[34:57] pretty good life and I gave to Charities
[34:58] and uh you know I I stayed true to my
[35:02] dad and mom I wore what they said to
[35:04] wear
[35:05] you're born in sin
[35:06] shaped in iniquity
[35:08] you're messed up
[35:11] that's the identity of the world and and
[35:14] Adam you see he the the book the book
[35:17] fell away from Adam because of sin and
[35:21] the program says it went back into the
[35:23] hands of the original owner God because
[35:27] the title needed this earth and the Book
[35:30] of the book went back to the hands
[35:32] original owner because Satan's hands
[35:34] were too grubby for it
[35:36] he would have loved to have that but
[35:37] just his hands he he didn't so it went
[35:40] back in the hands Adam
[35:42] for the first time coming went from
[35:45] strength
[35:46] to weakness
[35:48] he was weak
[35:49] why was he weak because he was living in
[35:51] a false identity as a fallen Son of God
[35:55] not a son with power but a human
[35:59] governed by weakness of a serpent nature
[36:03] just another human being
[36:06] he forgot who he was brother Brown says
[36:08] Adam forgot who he was
[36:14] he got amnesia
[36:16] through sin
[36:18] and he forgot who he was
[36:21] now in our day the book appears again
[36:23] and Christ opens it the Saints start
[36:24] proclaiming not only has he redeemed us
[36:27] but we see that what he has redeemed us
[36:28] for its power and strength not weakness
[36:32] he's reading this the power power to
[36:34] rule power to reign with Christ in
[36:38] humility can I say it again since the
[36:40] book has been opened to us and it has
[36:42] he's called us to rule and reign in
[36:46] power with Christ with humility
[36:53] not the arrogance power power of this
[36:55] world
[36:56] but with the humility of Christ
[36:58] unreal Unleashed power against the devil
[37:02] and his kingdom by a simple humble
[37:05] believer who's looking and seeing his
[37:08] name in the book
[37:10] glory be to God
[37:13] Hallelujah
[37:16] now
[37:17] I thought it was interesting this week I
[37:19] caught this with the young people I was
[37:20] talking to him about it
[37:21] uh Eric Erickson was the first one who
[37:25] mentioned the term identity crisis and
[37:28] he mentioned it in 1968 so it's the
[37:31] first time he's a he was a psychoanalyst
[37:33] and a psychologist Eric Erickson and he
[37:36] developed the concept of the identity
[37:39] crisis in 1968 and he and he came up
[37:42] with a term to characterize the
[37:44] experimentation and identity development
[37:48] phase that people experienced during
[37:50] their teen years he was specific because
[37:52] he split up all the stages of Life of
[37:54] development into uh five different uh
[37:57] seven different stages I believe it was
[37:59] and the fifth stage this teenage and so
[38:03] he coined this term identity crisis and
[38:07] so I I want to look at this just a
[38:09] second because we realized that it's in
[38:11] 1968 finally this has been happening
[38:14] naturally with teenagers for years and
[38:17] all of us go through stages of life that
[38:19] we forget who we are we don't know who
[38:21] we are we go through an identity crisis
[38:23] our parents have told us so long but he
[38:25] seemed to realize that the teenage was
[38:27] the was the hardest time because then
[38:29] they go out to school and so now they
[38:31] think they know who they are but then
[38:33] they have an identity crisis they don't
[38:34] know who they are so they try to start
[38:36] being like everybody else they start
[38:38] like dressed like everybody else and
[38:40] they start to dress like the movie stars
[38:42] and they try to change their hair and
[38:43] their hair becomes blue instead of the
[38:45] way God made it brown that they make it
[38:47] blue and they put no piercing in their
[38:50] nose and they do everything because
[38:51] they're they're going through something
[38:53] they don't know who they are yet and
[38:54] some of them if I'm looking at a 60 year
[38:57] old on a Harley and he's got his ears
[39:00] pierced and he's
[39:02] you know he's he looks like he's gonna
[39:04] fall over with a heart attack but he's
[39:06] there with his leather jacket on and
[39:08] he's going at it with this image that
[39:09] he's trying to be the guys still have an
[39:12] identity crisis even at 60 years old he
[39:15] hasn't found who he really is
[39:18] so it's not just teenagers but he said
[39:20] it's specific so I want you to notice
[39:22] now he uh Eric Erickson coined that and
[39:26] pronounced something so now we've always
[39:28] had a natural transition of the stages
[39:30] of life and probably back in Jesus day
[39:33] and later times you probably would have
[39:36] had that natural stage of teenagers
[39:38] going through that time of of uh uh they
[39:41] come to that change of life and 12 13
[39:43] years old they become a little bit more
[39:45] sensitive how they look when they're
[39:47] eight year when they're seven-year-old
[39:48] boys they could care less how they look
[39:50] they don't need a bath they come out
[39:52] from the dirt from the day and the rain
[39:54] go to church without a bath or anything
[39:55] they could care less something they look
[39:57] like then all of a sudden at 13 they
[39:59] care about what they look like and
[40:00] they're spending an hour in the mirror
[40:02] getting in there had a shower the shower
[40:04] took about two hours
[40:07] and they're getting their hair just
[40:09] right they're putting some grease in it
[40:11] and they're looking at all this you know
[40:12] and getting it just right and so now
[40:15] it's like you're you're staying who took
[40:18] my son because at 70 I couldn't get him
[40:21] to take a bath and now he's taking three
[40:22] baths a day and he's you know getting
[40:24] his hair just right something changes
[40:26] naturally in them they become noticed
[40:28] that what I look like
[40:29] and then then they get influenced by
[40:31] their kids I want to look like that I
[40:33] want to look like this so This natural
[40:34] thing probably was already there
[40:36] throughout history as they go through
[40:38] the change of life and become a man they
[40:40] become sensitive to how they look uh and
[40:43] and so another thing I brought up to the
[40:45] young people is that they they didn't
[40:47] notice Girls when they were seven years
[40:49] old girls don't count girls are girls
[40:52] are not needed if you ask a
[40:54] seven-year-old do you think girls are
[40:55] needed no women and girls are not needed
[40:58] at all if we had a whole earth with with
[40:59] boys and guys we'd be fine without them
[41:02] we don't need any girls at all I hate
[41:04] girls so seven year old said I hate
[41:06] girls
[41:06] maybe even their sister
[41:10] but I don't know about 12 or 13 years
[41:12] old
[41:13] you ask them do you still hate girls
[41:15] like you did at seven well I'm not so
[41:17] sure that I hate them
[41:20] they're kind of they're kind of nice are
[41:22] they needed on the earth oh yeah they're
[41:24] needed
[41:27] and everything changes now what's
[41:29] changing their body
[41:31] their perception of things they're
[41:33] growing can you say man
[41:35] so you take this natural thing and it's
[41:37] it's such a crisis he calls it a crisis
[41:40] he names what's been developing
[41:42] naturally and I think it's something so
[41:44] much of the enemy to give a name to
[41:47] something sometimes that's already been
[41:49] there naturally and then the devil gives
[41:52] it a name
[41:54] right and so now now the people will
[41:58] take a name that's given to us by the
[42:00] doctors or by the world because they
[42:03] gave it a name we start to buy into it
[42:05] where parents started oh just let them
[42:07] be themselves we don't teach them the
[42:09] word of God anymore just let them go
[42:11] through that and they can be whatever
[42:12] they want they can do this they can do
[42:14] that and we open the doors because
[42:15] somebody called it an identity crisis
[42:20] it starts out natural but then it can
[42:22] turn into spirits
[42:24] that's the devil he always takes
[42:27] something natural and perverts it
[42:31] that's your enemy
[42:33] in Romans 1 here in a minute he takes
[42:35] something natural and he turns it to
[42:37] unnatural and then it turns into the
[42:39] wrong spirit
[42:41] so Eric Erickson says this 1968 and it's
[42:46] during their teen years the period of
[42:47] identity crisis happens during the fifth
[42:49] stage of Eric Erickson's stages of
[42:52] development watch Satan take this
[42:53] identity identity crisis now watch this
[42:56] as he takes the identity crisis label in
[42:59] 1968
[43:00] to new deeper levels than ever
[43:03] let's go to Romans 1.
[43:07] I didn't realize I had so much tonight
[43:09] but
[43:11] we're going to get you some of it here
[43:20] Verse 18 for the wrath of God is
[43:22] revealed from Heaven against all
[43:23] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[43:25] who hold the truth of unrighteousness
[43:28] Truth and unrighteousness because that
[43:31] which may be known of God is manifesting
[43:33] them for God has showed it unto them for
[43:34] the invisible things of him from the
[43:36] creation of the world are clearly seen
[43:38] being understood by the things that are
[43:39] made even his eternal power and God had
[43:42] so that they are without excuse because
[43:44] that when they knew God they glorified
[43:46] him not as God neither were thankful but
[43:49] became vain in their imaginations and
[43:50] their foolish heart was darkened profess
[43:52] themselves to be wise became fools and
[43:55] changed the glory of The Incorruptible
[43:57] God into an image made like a de
[43:59] corruptable man and to birds and to
[44:02] Forfeit obese and creeping things this
[44:04] is idolatry and this is man taking the
[44:06] purity of the glory of God and attaching
[44:09] it to an animal attaching it to the
[44:11] creation instead of the creator
[44:13] wherefore what happens now when you do
[44:16] that when you mock the Creator when you
[44:19] mock the designer when you start
[44:21] rebelling against the original designer
[44:24] of how he even made you watch what comes
[44:27] from it wherefore God also gave them up
[44:30] to uncleanness to the lust of their own
[44:31] Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[44:34] between themselves who change the truth
[44:37] of God into a lie and worship and serve
[44:40] the creature more than the Creator who
[44:42] is blessed Forever This is a mockery of
[44:44] a Creator I am denying the Creator I am
[44:47] denying that he made me I you know a
[44:49] creature made me I evolved from a
[44:52] creature and all this comes from
[44:54] somebody rebelling against the original
[44:56] designer of you
[45:00] for this cause God gave them up under
[45:02] vile affections for even their women did
[45:04] change the natural use into that which
[45:07] is against nature and likewise all the
[45:10] men also the men leaving the natural use
[45:13] of a woman natural use of a woman
[45:15] natural family relations were the one
[45:17] burned in their lusts one for another
[45:20] men with men working that which is
[45:23] unseemly and receiving themselves the
[45:25] recompense of their air which was me
[45:28] and even as they did not like to retain
[45:30] God in their knowledge God gave them
[45:32] over to reprobate mine to do those
[45:34] things which are not convenient being
[45:37] filled with all the righteousness so
[45:38] let's stop right there you see the cycle
[45:40] of man turning against the original
[45:43] identity and design even of naturally
[45:46] who we are they go against God and thus
[45:49] they go against nature and in their love
[45:52] say I don't want to hear what God made
[45:54] me and my natural desire for a woman I'm
[45:58] changing that now and I don't want a
[46:00] woman anymore men will be with men and
[46:02] homosexuality
[46:04] all starts with a denial and a mockery
[46:08] of God
[46:14] it's against what he made you the
[46:16] original designer men turned to Men
[46:19] Women turn to women a defiant spirit
[46:22] that says it don't start out as a
[46:24] homosexual it starts out as taking the
[46:26] spirit is I defy what God has designed
[46:30] me as
[46:31] can I get an amen tonight I defy God I
[46:35] defy he's the designer I go against it I
[46:39] defy right now today I defy the word and
[46:42] what the prophet said I'm going against
[46:43] that that's the prophet's opinion be
[46:45] careful of that
[46:47] be careful where I'll lead you
[46:50] I defy what God made me the natural
[46:52] chapter of a man to woman I defy that I
[46:55] don't have to go with a woman I can go
[46:57] with a man and then as you see that
[47:00] happen in our society the last 60 70
[47:02] years and it becomes a normal laws come
[47:05] in for homosexuals notice now notice it
[47:09] goes deeper than that because Satan
[47:11] never keeps it at that level the
[47:13] Defiance of God as an original designer
[47:16] the Defiance keeps going and Satan takes
[47:19] it deeper into the 2000s which says
[47:23] guess what I I was I'm a biological
[47:27] woman but I'm not a woman anymore I'm
[47:31] going to tell everybody I'm a man
[47:35] I defy science I defy biology and thus
[47:39] you defy the way God made you as a
[47:40] desire
[47:42] and I design my own self however I
[47:46] choose
[47:49] trans
[47:51] we probably won't let this message out
[47:53] public
[47:55] but in Romans 1 you'll find the answer
[47:57] to the trouble of all this it started
[47:59] somewhere it's I defy God is the
[48:02] original designer and creator
[48:05] that's where it starts with but look
[48:07] where it leads now you're not even
[48:08] thinking properly I can choose whatever
[48:10] I want to be I can choose my own dreams
[48:13] and my own destiny and you know what I
[48:15] believe in believing in your dreams but
[48:17] you better go to prayer find out what
[48:19] God wants for your life this isn't some
[48:21] carnal natural zigzag Zig Ziglar seminar
[48:24] that says you can be anything you want
[48:26] in life not without God you can't
[48:29] yeah you can go do it by your own power
[48:31] but we have to go to God first is what
[48:33] what did you put me on Earth to do why
[48:36] did you give me these gifts is it your
[48:39] will for me to do this but the Defiance
[48:41] of God says I don't need God in any of
[48:43] that I can become anything and if I
[48:46] decide this is what I am then this is
[48:49] what I am
[48:51] it's getting quieter so maybe I should
[48:52] pick this up next Wednesday night again
[48:56] but I just I'd like to finish
[49:00] is this brother Steve's water here is
[49:02] this mine
[49:03] okay
[49:05] not that I don't trust him
[49:11] notice the nature of Satan's working and
[49:14] I won't be long I'm just I'm laying in
[49:16] something here about the nature of Satan
[49:18] taking it to level
[49:20] lower level lower level lower level and
[49:23] now we've got
[49:24] now we've got somebody said I choose
[49:26] that I'm not a woman and everything else
[49:28] says they're a man I'm not a man I'm a
[49:31] woman
[49:33] and he thinks that love he takes it and
[49:35] so notice the nature of Satan's work of
[49:38] mixing identity
[49:40] it takes a Defiance towards the design
[49:42] designer it takes the mixing up of the
[49:45] nature of men to men mixing of genders
[49:48] Satan keeps plunging deeper and deeper
[49:50] our gender problem that we have today of
[49:53] messing up genders to a young child
[49:55] can't even think straight about it
[49:57] anymore it comes from Satan and his
[50:00] desire to mix up the identity of Who You
[50:03] Are
[50:06] and it goes much deeper than any of you
[50:08] without the Holy Ghost can handle it
[50:10] goes much deeper Satan is taken deeper
[50:12] every week he takes it deeper in this
[50:14] world you live in to people take the
[50:16] spirit I must have these problems in
[50:18] life because maybe somebody told me I'm
[50:20] a man but I'm really a woman and they
[50:23] take that demon power they open
[50:24] themselves up to that demon power and
[50:26] that thought life
[50:28] and they begin to believe there's
[50:29] something else than what the and so now
[50:31] he keeps them plunging deeper and deeper
[50:33] into sin into confusion about who they
[50:35] are weakness weak Minds weak convictions
[50:39] weak bodies how many know the food we're
[50:42] eating is making us weak bodies
[50:44] come on
[50:46] manipulated bodies taking children and
[50:49] giving permission permission to
[50:51] manipulate and change try to change the
[50:54] biology of who they were manipulating
[50:56] that's how low Satan is taking it
[51:00] God forbid that this is happening and
[51:02] it's already happening and then all of a
[51:04] sudden a kid wakes up and in his nature
[51:07] this is you can read the testimonies
[51:09] online they get that that change in
[51:12] their body to change from a guide to a
[51:14] girl and five years later they they keep
[51:16] feeling these expressions of who they
[51:19] really are when they grow up because
[51:20] somebody did it to them when they were
[51:22] young and now they realize wait a minute
[51:24] I made the biggest mistake of my life
[51:26] and they want to sue the doctors for
[51:27] doing it but it's because their nature
[51:29] starts to come and realize God may be
[51:31] this way and I tried to change it
[51:36] their life's a mess absolute mess
[51:39] no family no children of their own
[51:41] everything natural life that they could
[51:43] have had is finished
[51:45] because Satan deceived them in their
[51:48] identity
[51:50] you Believers listen to me tonight watch
[51:52] out for Satan trying to deceive you
[51:54] about who you really are in Christ
[51:57] you're not the world you're not meant to
[51:59] be like the World Girls you're not meant
[52:01] to dress like that he's called you to
[52:03] something higher guys are not meant to
[52:05] be that out there he's called you to
[52:07] something higher men of God strong in
[52:09] the Lord taking care of your wives and
[52:12] families young women that dress calmly
[52:14] at Godly and are strong in the Lord
[52:16] that's what he's called you to do get
[52:19] your mind off of Satan speaking to you
[52:22] that somehow that's a better life it
[52:24] might be better for them but it's not
[52:25] really it's it's not going to be better
[52:27] for you because why you have the book
[52:29] and God's trying to tell you who you
[52:31] really are and it's not to be part of
[52:33] the Amish is to be a dignified daughter
[52:35] of almighty God a king's daughter that's
[52:39] what he said of you in the Book of Life
[52:42] you forgive me for being straight
[52:44] tonight but listen I'm against the power
[52:46] of the enemy that tries to come even our
[52:48] own ranks and mix up the identity and
[52:50] try to mess with these kids minds and
[52:53] adults Minds maybe I'm this maybe I'm
[52:55] not that maybe this message isn't for me
[52:57] it's all mess up of identity say Lord
[53:00] let me stay in the storm till I find out
[53:02] who I am
[53:04] and I stand upon an unmovable in the
[53:06] word of God let the world pass away I
[53:09] know where I stand and if ten thousand
[53:11] ten thousand Fall by my right twenty
[53:14] thousand my left even even the pastor
[53:15] leaves this message it shall not come
[53:17] nigh unto me because I know who I am in
[53:20] the word of God somebody say praise the
[53:22] Lord tonight
[53:23] we must know who we are in this hour
[53:25] told to go against Satan's identity
[53:28] crisis
[53:30] Hallelujah blessed be his name
[53:33] in Defiance to the original designer
[53:37] Satan's work is slow to complete this
[53:40] perversion of identity that he has in
[53:42] this hour and then you have a thing
[53:44] called intelligent design which some of
[53:47] you homeschoolers teach your kids
[53:48] intelligent design
[53:51] the set of beliefs
[53:53] based on the notion that life on the
[53:56] Earth
[53:57] is so complex that it cannot be
[54:01] explained by the scientific theory of
[54:05] evolution
[54:06] and therefore must have been designed by
[54:11] a supernatural entity
[54:18] that's the conclusion oh yeah it's
[54:20] intelligent design and guess what
[54:22] it's more intelligent than the minds we
[54:25] have on the face of the Earth it's a
[54:27] good thing we can learn learn in the
[54:28] word of God God's intelligence from the
[54:30] beginning because I wouldn't want to
[54:31] trust the intelligence of a psychologist
[54:36] come on now
[54:37] thank God we got intelligent design and
[54:40] that's our creator our designer who said
[54:42] what we were from the foundation of the
[54:44] world
[54:45] I love it that he puts the word
[54:46] Supernatural in there in the meeting it
[54:48] says is that it can't these things can't
[54:50] be explained by scientific theory of
[54:52] evolution and therefore we must have
[54:53] been designed by a supernatural entity
[54:59] God supernaturally
[55:04] chose you before the foundation of the
[55:07] world
[55:13] oh it's intelligent design because who
[55:15] I'm living with in this world have has
[55:17] no intelligence whatsoever
[55:20] and this gender reveal this gender
[55:23] reveal that we've had for some reason I
[55:25] wonder when they're going to phase that
[55:26] out because it's wrong to do a gender
[55:28] reveal to put that on that boy to show
[55:31] it's going to be a boy it's going to be
[55:32] a boy and so they do all these different
[55:34] games for gender reveals yeah it's just
[55:37] an exciting time so we're going to show
[55:38] the rest of the siblings and my whole
[55:39] family and we got this pinata and we're
[55:42] gonna bust the pinata in a bunch of blue
[55:44] things come out and you're oh it's a boy
[55:47] it's a boy wonder when they're gonna
[55:48] stop that it's wrong to tell that boy
[55:51] he's a boy
[55:54] so if you go 30 years and they they did
[55:57] that when you were born but you forgot
[55:59] who you are I think you need another
[56:00] gender reveal with another pinata from
[56:03] Mexico
[56:05] I guess we have to do it again have the
[56:08] family over because you forgot who you
[56:10] were
[56:10] having pinata bust it open have the blue
[56:13] come out and you have to discover again
[56:15] I'm a boy God made me a boy
[56:22] gender reveal
[56:24] sometimes we need that amongst the young
[56:26] people can you say man
[56:27] so they don't dress like a boy
[56:30] and the girls don't dress like a boy and
[56:32] the guys don't dress like a girl
[56:35] maybe you need a revelation
[56:38] but I'm Ending by saying this I never
[56:40] dreamed I'd go this long tonight but I'm
[56:42] having so much joy in my heart right now
[56:44] it's hard to contain myself
[56:47] let me in on this did you notice the
[56:50] time when the proclamation of the of the
[56:53] uh term
[56:56] identity crisis came in 1968 and did you
[56:59] realize just a few years before in 1963.
[57:04] is when the seals were taken off of the
[57:08] book of redemption
[57:15] Hallelujah
[57:18] and it's not it's not an identity crisis
[57:22] it's an identity reveal
[57:26] for the bride
[57:29] the seals were taken off the book and
[57:31] now from that time until tonight because
[57:33] I'm preaching it to you still we're not
[57:35] out here in a Rapture yet and I'm still
[57:37] going to keep preaching this book in

[57:45] God just before the term comes out
[57:47] identity crisis and then it goes into
[57:49] girls not even knowing who they are it
[57:51] goes into changing biologic it goes into
[57:54] an absolute perversion just before the
[57:57] term comes out God comes out with the
[57:59] seals broke and says I'm going to give
[58:01] this book I'm going to hand it to my
[58:04] Prophet on Earth it's open Revelation is

[58:37] takes the seals off and as soon as
[58:39] identity crisis proclaims a title God
[58:42] releases the greatest reveal of ever and
[58:45] brother Graham says he revealed the
[58:47] names of the book he said John must have
[58:48] seen his name there he because he began
[58:50] to shout so much because he must have
[58:52] seen his name and he says this not Orman
[58:55] Neville not our name like Paula Fontaine
[58:58] or Ormond Neville or William Brennan

[1:02:20] let me finish this so the message is the
[1:02:24] revealing of this book
[1:02:26] that is what the message is
[1:02:28] the message is not don't you come in
[1:02:31] church the message is not a collection
[1:02:33] of sermons by William Branham from the
[1:02:35] 50s and 60s the message is not a new
[1:02:38] dress code that's weird the mess is not
[1:02:40] a movement that is out to take all the
[1:02:43] movies entertainments out of our life if
[1:02:45] it does that sanctifies your life but
[1:02:47] the message is so much more than that
[1:02:49] the message is not a conglomeration of
[1:02:51] churches around the world that's not the
[1:02:53] message
[1:02:55] the message is not a near another weird
[1:02:57] break off of Pentecost with Holiness
[1:03:00] beliefs with it no no no that's not what
[1:03:03] the message is that's not what God sent
[1:03:05] us in this age we needed a whole lot
[1:03:07] more than another Holiness level
[1:03:11] we needed a whole lot more than just
[1:03:13] another movement can you say imagine we
[1:03:16] needed more than just another dress code
[1:03:18] we needed to see our names in The Book
[1:03:21] of Life to get our true identity and if
[1:03:24] you don't get anything else tonight that
[1:03:26] is what this message is don't let
[1:03:28] anybody tell you it's anything different
[1:03:30] you feed on it and something else comes
[1:03:33] besides William Branham it's your
[1:03:35] identity in Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:43] the gender reveal
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:46] he's my husband and I'm the bride

[1:03:55] Christ and Christ is my husband I know
[1:03:57] who I am can you say Amen

[1:04:02] young people and all and look at this
[1:04:05] message different and you get curious
