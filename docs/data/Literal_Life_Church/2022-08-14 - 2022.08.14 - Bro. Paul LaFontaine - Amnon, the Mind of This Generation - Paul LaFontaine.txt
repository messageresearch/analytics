========================================

second samuel chapter 13 and verse 1 and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her and amnon was so vexed that as we said a couple sundays ago this couldn't be true love because he was vexed there's no vexation and true love and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought now we're into amnon's thinking what's in his mind amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her amnon thought it was hard for him to get to her it was hard for him to get to her why was it hard to get to her why was it he wanted to do this thing with her but he found it hard why did he find it hard because god had put protections in place and if he were going to do something he was going to override all of god's boundaries and protections to do what he wanted to do heavenly father i pray the people would be gracious enough just to give me a few more minutes today i realized i'd take so long in those things but lord may they see my heart i love them whatever they would decide to do i would lord i wouldn't have the love of christ if i didn't love them anyway i'll stand here i'll preach the word lord i'll i'll be a friend to them whoever they are and most of them that been with me a long time they they know that lord i believe they know that but god i want to be faithful to your house i want to be faithful to this house i want to be faithful to the very last day that we get out of here i want to stand faithful to the word of god lord i'm not afraid of all the voices and all the different directions people lean towards i'm not afraid of that lord because i know when we hold your word before the people and they'll embrace it there's nothing but blessing and glories there's persecution oh they'll get laughed at but lord there's nothing that but blessings that come from heaven when someone decides to follow the precepts and principles of god's word so i pray you'll bless them and may they have a heart to receive lord may they take these things and pray about them we commit the service to you now in jesus name amen amen god bless you may be seated so brother isaiah last sunday um had a couple thoughts there that i had wrote down a wonderful message and i it's a couple things i wrote down and that ran really really deep and i'm just going to bring up one of them that you know fit real well with the subject this morning and talking about amnon i want to talk about ammon in this text about amnon it's kind of a strange section of the scripture to read and take a little series on it but you'll see the reasons why after a while it's a strange text to pull subjects from amnon uh raped tamar he he was in the kingdom of god he was they were both from david they were they were part of the jewish belief system and the jewish belief system had a lot of laws and boundaries in place there and amnon would have had to override all of these boundaries and all these jewish laws he wasn't a heathen now he was in the church he heard all these laws he knew what to do and he gets in his mind he's going to override all these things and he ends up raping tamar so it might be a strange thing to take in the scripture a rape case but there's very much in here and i have many reasons to break it down to you maybe in the next few services i want to title this today amnon the mind of this generation amnon the mind of this generation so because i've entered an all-out attack here against the enemy we're meeting together 7 30 if you want to join us for prayer because i'm in an attack against the enemy and what he's doing in people's minds i'm going to stand with the lord because that's the first thing we do is we go to prayer can you say amen and and we stand against the when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord raises up a standard against it so if you want to pray for with us every thursday morning at 7 30 whether here in the building or in your homes it will be great or if you're at work by that time you will hear a thread of the subject in these things related to sexual perversion you're going to hear that pop up and i will try to talk about it as tactfully as i can but it's something satan does not want us to talk about pornography is something satan does not want us to talk about to brothers and sisters sexual temptation is something satan does not want to talk about but it was it's one of the undercurrents that satan uses to defeat uh men and women and families and it's one of the undercurrents and where sometimes it happens where a family is exposed and it all comes out that's sometimes it happens but there's there's probably a bunch of other cases where it never comes out and just satan keeps everybody defeated because it hasn't come out yet i'm here to stand to stand against the enemy to talk about it according to the word of god so that some people will get victory over these things brother isaiah mentioned the change in the age to changing our thinking on things in other words there's been such an onslaught of social media and the wisdom of this world and people are changing their minds on the scripture and changing their minds on the way they used to believe and changing so so it's and he mentioned this it was so deep so so it's changing our thinking so much that that it actually changed normal biology and now biology normal biology of the of a man and woman normal biology of a man or woman has to bow to psychology that's the way he said it biology has to bow to psychology in other words something that's normal and natural now he so fills the minds that the mind overrides even normal biology and the mind says you're not a woman you're a man you're not a man you're you're a woman because of this spirit that goes with that so now you have to look at not only that where he begins to mess with the mind and then that psychology is the study of the mind and thinking and how it affects behavior and so he's messing with the minds to make it number one question and mock the word of god satan is messing with the world's minds and guess what he's trying to mess with our minds to change our perception of the word of god and question the word and mock the word and say the word is out of date i want to say after i've said all these things this morning the word is never out of date the message is not out of date what the prophet preaches more relevant today in 2022 than it has ever been you say no he was in the 60s it was no no it's more relevant today that's why i'm preaching it and so now first of satan does to mess with our minds is to get us to question and mock the word of god but even natural normal biology of a man and woman it mocks that and says no i'm not a man i'm a woman and the the psychology of it changes the mind if you pull up there in the back romans chapter one this is where we find the cycle of it happening and the scripture by the way is crystal clear here how the deterioration coming to homosexuality happens i'm not talking about homosexuality i'm telling you how you get there and i'm here to tell you the romans 1 here starting at verse 18 it tells how it happens for the wrath of god was revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god has shown it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his internal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened so where does it start the imagination the mind became empty vain thoughts vain thoughts empty thoughts not solid thoughts not word thoughts vain thoughts professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncountable god into an image made like unto a corruptable man to birds four footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves now we have the sin coming the sin starts in the mind they change their mindset on stuff but now god gives them up to their lustful ways verse 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie worshipped and serve the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into with that which is catch this term into that which is against nature so as brother isaiah said biology has to bow now to psychology in other words when this gets in the mind it even goes against nature what's normal a normal marriage a normal family relations between a man and a woman a normal courtship in dating hello a normal way to dress on what's normal what's just normal because years ago 100 years ago friends it was 100 years ago it was it was normal for a woman to wear a dress probably 120 years ago now it was normal it wasn't it wasn't because they did it because of the word of god it was normal that a woman dressed like a woman a man dressed like a man she didn't wear the pants but this spirit when it comes in the mind of the people and they change their mind they evolve into a changed mindset they eventually get to everything now where it's against nature i don't want to do that i'm not going to do that that's you i've always believed that but that's not the truth now things have changed a little bit it's against nature it's against god but it's against nature too against that which is normal and likewise also men leaving the natural use of a woman burned in their lust toward one another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their heir which was meat and even as they did not like to retain god in their where in their knowledge in their mind in their thinking god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all the unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetous maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whispers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters oh my goodness verse 31 without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection impeccable unmerciful all this all this you say wow thank god i'm none of that if you yield your mind to the mindset of the world this is the direction it goes changes your mindset on stuff changes how you think about normal natural things that's not natural anymore brother brahman says how do we ever get kennedy into a presidency first catholic president how do we ever put a catholic president as president when we left the catholic system to come for freedom of worship and so many years later now we elect a catholic president why because the minds have become so deceived they don't know the deception behind that system anymore they forgot it let's put in a catholic president and the women put him in he said and so that's what changes over time is the mindset the change the thinking changes and so brother isaiah mentions the change in the age to our thinking on things so much so that's changed so let me just move down here that's why another thing has changed is that god rose with his ministry in the last days with healing his wings he did it 2000 years ago he rose with healing in his wings when we think of healing we think of physical healing and when he arose in the ministry of brother branham and christ dealing that it was great healing campaigns it was great healing lines but it was mostly physical healing but now if you see that the if you see the change happening where satan has about 70 years here to affect the mind through 100 years because tv is back then 100 years of t you take 100 years of tv of radio of now the internet of social media access to the wisdom of the world and then access to the filthiest dirtiest sexual images you a person should never see you take a hundred years of that now where's the healing needed in the mind oh we still have physical sickness we still it's amazing we got more medicine we ever had and still got sick people still got cancer so we we still need his atonement for healing can you say man but what is the main healing we need today i can tell you we need a healing of the mind everybody ever suggest a healing line for for mental illness we've got a lot of mental illness on different levels i'm not talking about a person who's who's got a mental problem in the sense of a special needs i'm talking if we feed on things all these years we're not thinking sound anymore we're not thinking straight anymore there's a lot of mental illness going and that's why we have medicines for that now but i want to remind the devil this morning that our atonement was not only for physical healing not only to heal cancer but in the atonement he went to calvary for is for mental illness as well because he said i've given you i'm not giving you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind how many raise your hand say i want the devil to know this morning our atonement covers mental illness as well people are not thinking straight anymore because they fed on too many things i encourage you put some of that stuff away and get into the word of god and let your mind be influenced by the word because if the balance of it is that you're feeding on social media and entertainments and a bunch of jokes and tick tock all these times and you're reading a little scripture with brother paul sunday mornings i can tell you your mind's going to be messed with your mind is going to be messed with even if it's decent stuff if that's all you feed on that's the mindset you keep and that's the way you start living it's time to lay some of that stuff down it's time to sanctify your life and say i'm gonna give more to the word of god this mind is not a garbage can this nine is not for mush can you say amen our bodies have become mush because of the foods we eat we're physically down because of the foods we eat how many know that but our minds have become mush too because what we're feeding on the great healing revival in the message those early days but the healing we need now it's mental not so much physical praise the lord when he gave us the atonement he gave us healing for all i believe that if your head is mostly in this stuff instead of the word then you're slowly changing and you're thinking you don't realize it standards are starting to slip for amnon can you give me about 20 more minutes here for amnon i want you to think deeply about ammon here for amnon to carry out what he did in a rape it was a long time of his mind going unchecked and unaccountable there was a private feeding on things even if it was on his own thoughts unchecked by the word of god it happened in his mind first now i don't think amnon in that day had they didn't have tvs they didn't have social media they didn't have pornography but something is something's going on there's no way that a boy could come to this point where his mind is going to is trying to think about ways to rape his half sister without the mind being affected by something now the writers tell me because just two or three chapters earlier is when david himself fell in sin and if you think i'm going to talk about amna not go back to david because to me when you have a family some of this might have been a family situation that had taken over sexually and david's got dealt with by nathan the prophet right but if that trickled down then it starts to go through the family and now you got a boy that's so messed up in his mind he's getting ready to find ways that he could be with his half-sister even if he has to rape her something happened and changed that boy's mind even living in a jewish community even being a son of david the king so listen now let's not be proud and say this stuff does not affect me i can i can click on this site i can do this i can listen to this mindset i can do this don't let's not be proud because they were in the kingdom of david all of us would love to be in the kingdom of david let's not get pride in the message and think this doesn't affect us i can dabble and it don't affect me it does affect us because our minds are just like everybody else's [Applause] i'm preaching to you i'm not preaching to somebody else i'm preaching to you your mind is just like their minds and if it's not submitted to god you're going to start living out what's been put in your mind in your thoughts amnon amnon here had to be unchecked and unaccomplished until it carried out what was there but here's the biggest deal that i want to preach today most never carry it out to that point of a rape i seen a statistic last week that said less than one percent of sexually addicted people actually carried out to do an act it's all done in the realm of secrecy with their computer or their phone they're addicted they're bound by it but it never goes as far as admin where he carries out a rape less than one percent carries it out you know when i read that you know what it told me that's the way the devil likes it because if it comes out then it's exposed you deal with it like davidson nathan dealt with it he lost the child over it there was a big message but a lot of things don't come out and satan likes that because it stays under under everything which means you stay bound for years satan does not like exposure sometimes it helps say oh my family we're going to be embarrassed this is going to come out sometimes it's better it comes out because sometimes there's a deliverance but a lot of times there's not deliverance when it's kept and nobody knows about it so he carried it out but less than one percent today carry out everything that's going on in their mind so they say completely bound in their minds by what they fed on and they continue to do it not an act not adultery and that's why jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after has already committed adultery in his heart already he's bringing it to a heart level because you could technically say i've never committed adultery on my wife i'm staying right with the commandment let me bring it down some more i am i would never wear that out like that i would never wear that immodest outfit or i'd never be unfaithful to my husband and present myself that way but brother says when you present your body and show too much of your body and he he looks at you you're guilty of it too because you presented yourself that way that's what the prophet said so most never carried out so in a nutshell he was amnon was vexed with a lustful eye and a heart towards tamar but the pitiful thing is here's what i get to he seen it was hard to get to her and begin looking for ways to get around this huge protective boundary or boundaries godly things in place normal things that would protect this virgin god put some things in place to protect just the fact that she was a virgin that's a certain get-back she's not a married woman she hasn't been with somebody so there's certain things that should back off some back somebody off she's not someone's wife if i want if i want her and i have a lover right then i should go through the right process and marry her matter of fact paul even said it's better to marry than to burn and brother man says that's burning lust towards if you're going to go out and live a dirty life then you need to go ahead and get married if it's all sex is what you want then go ahead and get married that's what paul said better to marry than to burn in lust play around do sneaky things better to marry than a bird because i had one preacher say the way i do my church is that let them burn a while i'm not going to marry them paul said they're going to be that way take that path with it but you see to come the normal path they don't want to do that and one of the reasons he didn't want to come to north is hit all these boundaries around tamar it was hard i find this hard to get through this he actually had a mind that's like this generation that's looking for ways around god's boundaries i've been thinking about this a lot do you know how many boundaries we enjoy even when we come in a service like this that been put in place by the prophet you know we come in today and we weren't offered coffees and everything in a cup holder and a big gulp and we can wear our shorts in and we can come in and we're talking across the room and you know and i'm describing a lot of churches now so young people where did all this come from that we got an order to this and we respect the house of god and you know we we do these things and we we we we want to keep it quiet in here we want to prepare our hearts we want to pray ahead of time and all these where do we get off it came from the prophet setting the house an order we're enjoying boundaries and if we if if those things if the deacon said we're removing all those things and we're just going to be a free-fall next sunday some of you would get angry because you're enjoying boundaries some of you parents are enjoying some of your parents are enjoying the boundaries that i set as a pastor for dating in courtship you're enjoying that and dads that back it up it's even better you're enjoying that because you're enjoying a certain protection that i have a protection from my daughter the pastor and the leadership have protection same predictions and you're enjoying those but if we remove that and say do whatever you want young people and we don't talk to them about it you wouldn't like it and i'm telling you this generation has been changed in its mindset against the word and against the the boundaries and protections and the godly order that's been set in place for a woman for a man for a family for marriage everything there's been some boundaries set in order and we should never let satan mess with our minds to change those boundaries we actually should be embracing them more than we ever have we all should we we need to be getting hold of the word and saying at this hour at this closing seconds of time judgment's hanging two things days of noah days of lot we see it now we see the full manifestation of the days of lot homosexuals everywhere the spirit trying to take our children you know what we should be doing i'm clinging to this word and this message closer than i've ever been before i want to know it i want the preacher to preach it i want to i want to open up this message to my children and i'm not afraid of any quotes i'm going to read the quotes to my kids some of your parents are afraid to do that because somebody's planning in your mind to be leery of this that's the devil that's told you that this is the thing god sent to us to be delivered this is what god breathed on the generation to save our children from gender well my daughter my boy would never turn to that they know better than that just watch a few years more those spirits are relentless and your own daughter your own son now they lean towards that spirit beginning to question whether they're a girl or not you're living in la la land if you don't think these things are out to get your children and the message has come as a protection to teach our children the token the holy ghost has been given for a protection can you say amen people still questioning it still doubting us so oh i don't know about we need to be embracing it more than we ever have you need to be sending a clear message to everybody to the world to your church and to your pastor i'm all in brother paul i'm all in i believe that i may not be living all of it right now but i'm all in 100 with this message quit riding on the fence make a decision what you believe make a decision what you believe when we start to allow our minds to think in ways to bust down the fences that god has given us in his word we're on bad ground amna's mind represents the mind of this whole generation amnon thought the bible says amnon thought an amnon thought i want you to underline that amnon thought i'm finding it hard to get to her amnon thought i don't like the boundaries around her amna thought i don't like that i can't have her what's blocking me from just having her like everybody else in the world if you want her just go for it i don't like the boundaries it's so hard to do what i really want to do why brother paul is it's so hard for me to go really do what i want to do it's hard to live this way i feel restricted by the message and by the boundaries i can't get what i want i can't wear what i want because of what this message says that is probably the prophet's opinion but because of this message and what it says i can't really go where and do what i want to do a mind that has an agenda to remove every standard boundary fence wall conviction godly principle to have life the way that you want and he thought this is hard what a deception what's hard you listening he thought that was hard what's hard is a life of sin because maybe you haven't been out there but brothers and sisters who stand and testify where they're sitting here this morning they'd love to testify to you they'd love to say give an ear to what the man's saying because my life was a mess i didn't have those boundaries i didn't have a preacher telling it like it is like this and they'd be saying please listen to what he's saying because they come from a life and you're they're saying you're saying this message is hard you're saying the boundaries are hard no the world is hard sin is hard the results of sin on your family and children that's what's hard that's what hurts can you say amen how in the world could this boy that was grown up in a jewish home and in the kingdom of david could ever think of it it's so hard to get through the way that i want her how can i tear this down this is hard what's hard is a life of sin what's hard is living in the world with no corrective love what's hard is to live a life with no corrective love that's a hard life is anybody listening this morning what's hard is dealing with consequences of lustful sin and addiction and other addictions that's what's hard that's what's really hard but this is hard to get what i want because of the protections over this girl that's what amnon thought so i did a little research and i'm going to say it real quickly now because i only gave myself 20 minutes but i'm going to say it quickly i did a little research so just to break this down there was a word a law in from moses law because here they're in time the ammon and david or the time of amnon and david there was a law in the law of moses of course that was against fornication and adultery so of course he's he's overriding the laws right they say uh do not you know she you can't have her until you marry her so am in his mind even though he grew up hearing the ten commandments he's overriding all of it that law doesn't matter anymore anna knew that word and there were several other places and his mind was ready to ditch all of those quotes of the prophet his mind come to a place that he's ready to ditch all of those quotes of the prophet to get what he wants but the law of moses that said no fornication before marriage but there really doesn't wasn't anything specific about being alone with a person in other words here's the point i want to make the law said don't commit for creation don't commit adultery but there really is wasn't too many specifics in the law of moses to protect you from setting yourself up for a fornication there wasn't anything in there or setting yourself up for adultery so as time moved and i don't know when they did it but they say the high court of david as time moved on these scene conditions happened they realized we've got to have some more laws here we got to have something else it's not an adding to the commandments but it's advancing and and uh um amplifying what the ten commandments say because we have situations that could happen and the first one they dealt with is that they made a law uh the high quarter of david and all them made a law that was an expansion or a a amplification they made a law that was called that addressed yakud in the hebrew it's yokud and yakud means uh seclusion it's to be alone so this was a law against yokud for married women and for married men in other words they said we know we're not supposed to commit adultery but if a married man a married woman they're not married to one another if they're put in a room and they're locked in there you have the potential of something happening so we're going to make a law no married woman or no man should ever be alone in a room together with the door locked it was in the hebrew law praise the lord i'm going to tell you a few things in the next five minutes that make me feel so joyful because through the years as a father and working together with brother berry coffee and young people through the years you're looking for things because you realize the present modern conditions there's a lot of situations that happen that you could take a scripture but you want to articulate plainly what to do with that scripture in conditions of guys and girls being alone because there's one thing to say don't do that it's another thing to say if you do this you're setting yourself up to do the wrong thing so let's put some protections in place and we have been made fun of even by some preachers we've been mocked it's too strict young people say it's too strict it's crazy you're making up your own thing but here we have men of god working in the high court saying we know what the law says we're holding that but in the mind of god we're going to set some protections in place so that you'll be protected if you'll follow the protections you'll keep yourself being tempted so there's nothing specific about a single guy and a singer girl being alone just the married couple well here's here's how it goes and deuteronomy 13 7 is where they go back to the mosaic law or the law they take something according to the rabbis that was said what was said in the torah in deuteronomy 13 7 you can read it what was said in there was expanded upon a law called yakud which was a law that prohibited being alone together in jewish law the laws of yakud seclusion prohibits seclusion in a locked private area of a man and woman not permitted sexual intercourse with one another such seclusion is prohibited out of the fear that sexual intercourse or other lesser lesser acts may occur sexual intercourse or lesser acts may occur if you're in a room alone together we're talking to for we're talking like 4 000 years ago here friends a person who is present in order to prevent yakud is called a shomer a person who's present you gotta have a person present a person who's present in order to prevent yakud is called a shomer we call them a yes you could call it chaperone the laws of yukuda are typically followed in strict orthodox judaism the term yokud also refers to a ritual during a jewish wedding in which the newly married couple spends a period of secluded in a room by themselves after their wedding in early historical periods as early as the tomonic era the marriage would be consummated at this time but that practice is no longer current so in jewish weddings some of them even till today they leave the ceremony and the first thing they do is go to a private room together it's the first time they've been that private their entire courtship in a private room together and these days they'll talk they'll kiss i don't know what they do they they're allowed to do everything now so here they are and they're allowed so that's when that's that that's that word uh yakud applies to weddings as well but it came from something that you a law that you couldn't be alone together and then back in hebrew time the weddings that little moment after the wedding that's where it actually consummated the uh the marriage is in that that room just after the ceremony they don't do that today the laws of you the the term you could also remember okay i got that the talmud also claims that after the rape of tamar listen to this now the tomal claims that after the rape of tamar daughter of david when she was left alone with her half-brother amnon david and his high court extended this prohibition to unmarried girls as well so it wasn't there but they put it in as a protection for unmarried girls praise the lord later in the times of shamaya and hill and elder the pro the prohibition was extended to include non-jewish women these rules are discussed in the tumult so as time went on and you could you can go read it yourself this law kept expanding to now unbelieving woman being with jews any woman that wasn't your wife now protecting the young people then it expanded into public areas that you were alone then it expanded into your children and they had certain ages that your children children couldn't spend the night even even with another child their age that that rule extended into that to protect them from something happening molestation or something it kept expanding to deal with oh lord we didn't know this was going to happen so now the law was expanded for what for protection tell your friends we ought to be thankful for the message of the last days and not resist what my god has put in place for us oh boy i'm going to have to continue next sunday i might have to continue next sunday praise the lord god is good amen i'm just going to skip to the end here and we'll come back up with this again it's just a great joy to see that in the scripture because i've been known as very strict when it comes to young people being alone together even my own kids sometimes say it's it's overly strict dad you know we're not doing nothing i know don't you trust me dad and i say yeah i don't trust the devil i trust you i don't trust the devil and i don't trust the flesh dad used to tell us that i don't care how much holy ghost you got you put yourself in the wrong situation the flesh is going to kick in some preachers don't believe it that way but you put yourself in situations something is strict and all these things and then you have this pop-up where they're the david's court and by the way in david's court the prophet nathan was there in his court too praise the lord so it wasn't just men making their own decisions they had the influence of a god called prophet there to make the decisions to say listen here's some boundaries now we got to put in place to protect our children i'd be leery who your children spend the night with in the times we live in you better be watching over it so all these things come out and i remember years ago i always challenge the young men to don't be afraid of the daddy if you want to go ask date a girl whatever don't be afraid of them and don't be afraid of his questions i challenge daddy's give him a few test questions see how he relates you know test him a little bit some guys back off from that but you shouldn't be afraid if you like the girl as and i talk about just give them a few tests you know you tell me your experience with the lord tell me this you know what if they can talk about it confidently praise the lord you know but if they back off from that then then the daddy's got to make this how many believe the daddies make the decision with the daughter amen there's been something else floating around here that you know the parents are not involved and they do their own thing that's not what we teach here we respect the parents that are involved they don't make the final decision but they weigh in pretty heavy both sides amen well i was elaborating on a daddy challenge and the the potential son-in-law there that young guy you know and one day i was reading where caleb he's an old guy and he just raises up caleb in the bible and he come through all this and he says i just want to say something i get this mountain over here i get this mountain any of you young guys that can take that mountain and conquer it you can have my daughter i said praise the lord there's a daddy right there talk about a challenge to the young man that's the way it should be amen god's put some principles in place and when we start removing those it gets a little sketchy all right you know what i think i'm losing some of you so i'm going to end it by this this this is going to represent as i close today this is going to represent the boundaries that i've been talking about that have been sent by god the protections the the laws the principles in the old testament there's statues there's principles there's laws there are four or five things mentioned there so this represents this this morning and so if we look at this as god's principles it's got a pointy head on it and if you leave it in this condition you only see it this way and somebody's bringing this up to you okay this is the way you're going to look at it he keeps probing and pointing at me like that by that thing god's friend he keeps nabbing at me he keeps talking about he's a pastor that talks about what i can't wear what i can wear i could do it harder you know this is god's principles it's god's law so that's why a lot of people start to look at it you're just being poked all the time and he's always saying something about it and he's always and his ministry has always been that way poked and then but if if you just say lord let me change my attitude towards these principles let me change my attitude i want you to read psalms 119 besides listening to flashing red light it was coming i want you to read the whole chapter psalms 119. i don't have time to read it it's so wonderful because it's a man it's not amnon it's a it's david who's allowed his mind to be so changed that his attitude towards the statues towards the laws is completely positive lord how shall a young man cleanse his way by adhering to obeying your principles and your boundaries read the whole chapter he embraces all of them said lord i've made mistakes i've fallen but i'm back i'm paraphrasing and i am determined to obey and follow your principles why because he didn't send him to be mean to us or to poke us and if we change our attitude the same principles change that wasn't supposed to happen sister laura the same principles can be strange you have to edit that part out i'm going to look like an idiot absolute idiot the same quit laughing at me the same principles that were poking us maybe all your years in the message as a young child as soon as you change your attitude about it you'll see them all together different [Applause] yep the same quotes the same quotes that you buck up against be careful could it be god given an awesome protection from the rains from the winds supposed to rain today maybe that's why i got this listen you say i don't need that i'll run here well you know if you do go without it you're going to be in some storms you're going to get wet you might even get pneumonia because something has been given to you for the protection of god amen we need to honor and look at him the right way with the right attitude right down from the seven seals to high heels don't dump any of it out it's all said for a reason thank you [Applause] mom i stole that out of your car the other day i'm giving it back to you i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i don't have time to finish this so let's stand i i'd say i've probably said enough for you to chew on today probably said enough and i don't always say it like a polished preacher i know that i know i'm not the best polished preacher in the message i don't really want to be but i know i'm not that but i hope you see my heart we're all trying to serve the lord here and you're all at different stages okay the only thing i ask for is be careful what thoughts you put in your mind and where it comes from that's all i'm asking today if you're feeding too much of that you're going to change in your mind feed on the word of god and then you'll know for yourself where this comes from josh mcdowell is the one that referred to this umbrella and he said it's always an act of love on god's part it's always an act of love on god's part to protect us and provide for us but when through an act of disobedience by a decision of our own we ignore god's precepts we remove ourselves from the very protection and provision of those pre-precepts there's power that comes from god's word there's power protection that comes from his precepts it's not just laws but when we obey him power comes with it to watch over our lives let me just say this let's quit messing with the boundaries let's quit messing with the mind let's quit questioning them you want to spend your whole life just questioning them you want to know more why where they come from praise the lord research it but let's stop messing with them and letting satan mess with our minds god give us a sound mind a clear mind god give us more of a love for his precepts and his word i give my mind brother kenny can you close your eyes we'll pray just lift your hand brother paul i'll be praying about the things that you've said today i'll take them to my heart i pray you do that and i want to give my mind it doesn't belong to the enemy it doesn't belong to someone else a friend it belongs to the lord and i really want to give it more and more to the lord [Music] you know i'd rather have you as a pastor rather more than shouting and dancing and all that i'd rather have you just repenting and taking this word into your heart pondering it today just saying lord i need you i need an altar in my heart i need to change lord heavenly father we do close this service today lord but [Music] i pray that you will [Music] you do the work lord that we can't do let your word go forth and let it bring forth fruits that it brings forth power in the people's lives and you said of the pentecostals lord they they could shout they could dance they could blow it out the whistle but if they took all that power and put it into an everyday life it'd be a wonderful thing an everyday godly sanctified life is such a power against the enemy that's the thing he can't deal with so i pray he'll bless the people in that send us a revival in our hearts wash away all the trash and things may our minds be totally dedicated to you in our hearts people got to make some decisions lord i pray that your word has influenced their decisions today to make change in jesus name amen i give my mind completely to you [Music] you
