[0:03] i'm sorry open up to romans chapter 8
[0:05] first
[0:07] romans 8 26
[0:10] you can keep your
[0:12] bible handy tonight we'll just read a
[0:15] set of scriptures and then let you be
[0:16] seated and then
[0:19] just like to go through
[0:21] romans a little bit together
[0:25] and if you would keep me in prayer next
[0:26] week i've got a little
[0:28] sinus surgery that they're gonna do to
[0:32] um
[0:32] i kind of laugh because
[0:35] as big as my nose is um i don't breathe
[0:37] too well out of it so
[0:39] they're gonna go in and try to help that
[0:41] so
[0:42] just
[0:43] pray for me and
[0:45] and uh
[0:46] i i don't plan on staying away i will
[0:49] have to miss a couple services there at
[0:50] the beginning but um they tell me i look
[0:53] like i got busted in the face so
[0:55] if you see me just
[0:58] question tiff
[1:02] romans 8 26
[1:09] it says likewise the spirit also help
[1:10] helpeth our infirmities
[1:13] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:15] as we ought but the spirit itself maketh
[1:17] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:19] cannot be uttered
[1:21] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:23] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:26] he maketh intercession for the saints
[1:28] according to the will of god
[1:30] and we know that all things work
[1:32] together for good to them that love god
[1:35] to them who are the called according to
[1:37] his purpose
[1:38] for whom he did for no
[1:40] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:42] to the image of his son
[1:44] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:46] many brethren
[1:48] moreover
[1:50] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:52] called and whom he called them he also
[1:54] justified and them who he justified them
[1:57] he also glorified
[1:59] lord bless his word tonight you can be
[2:01] seated
[2:06] and if you want to turn back to uh
[2:08] chapter six
[2:11] i'm going to skip around a little bit
[2:13] but
[2:14] um
[2:15] something that just caught my attention
[2:18] here in the scripture was
[2:20] was how much the
[2:21] just kind of in that thought i get so
[2:24] impressed and
[2:26] and it's just so overwhelming to think
[2:28] about how much the lord loves you and i
[2:30] and and
[2:32] the fact that he would leave glory and
[2:34] come down to have fellowship with us and
[2:36] to
[2:37] and to go to the cross for for you and
[2:39] me to endure that pain and that
[2:41] suffering and
[2:43] and all all
[2:45] all for me
[2:46] and for you and
[2:48] and you know if we think about our lives
[2:50] we think how poorly we've treated him in
[2:51] response to that
[2:53] um
[2:54] but he knew that we would be sinners he
[2:56] knew that that would be that way
[2:58] and so it wasn't just enough to go to
[3:01] the cross and die for us but he wanted
[3:03] to send his spirit and
[3:05] here in romans chapter 8 he's talking
[3:07] about it's he says the spirit helps our
[3:10] infirmities
[3:12] it's the spirit that makes intercession
[3:14] for the saints it's the spirit that does
[3:16] these things it's the spirit it's the
[3:17] spirit and so i want you to catch that
[3:19] as we go tonight but
[3:21] just stepping back a little bit
[3:24] if you want to sometime read romans 6 7
[3:27] and 8 i just think it's a real good
[3:29] thing but you know especially for the
[3:31] young ones if they're considering
[3:32] baptism young or old if you haven't ever
[3:35] been baptized in the name of the lord
[3:37] jesus christ um read chapter 6 verse 1
[3:40] through 11.
[3:42] it's a good it's a good uh
[3:44] picture of what water baptism signifies
[3:47] in in the believer's life and
[3:50] and i just think it's real good talking
[3:51] about you know how we we die to sin how
[3:54] christ died for us and we rise again in
[3:57] newness of life and you know i always
[3:59] say he got the short end of the stick
[4:01] really
[4:02] um but
[4:03] i guess to him he got the better end
[4:05] because he got us so
[4:07] amen so let's just pick it up in verse
[4:10] 12.
[4:12] and paul writes here let not sin
[4:14] therefore reign in your mortal body
[4:17] that you should obey it in the lust
[4:19] thereof
[4:23] neither yield ye your members as
[4:25] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[4:28] but yield yourself unto god as those
[4:30] that are alive from the dead
[4:32] and your members as instrument of
[4:34] righteousness unto god
[4:36] so paul's actually saying you have a
[4:38] part to play in this
[4:40] and it's just simply who you yield to
[4:43] what do you yield yourself to what are
[4:44] you what are you allowing yourself to
[4:46] partake in god god made these bodies
[4:50] brother paul was saying it on sunday god
[4:52] god is is the absolute principle theme
[4:56] of the scripture so he should be the
[4:57] principal theme of our life and and the
[4:59] scripture talks about everything was
[5:01] made by him and for him and if we were
[5:04] made by him and for him
[5:07] to me
[5:08] just common sense would say we should be
[5:10] giving ourselves back to him
[5:12] yield yourself yield your vessel and and
[5:14] you know oftentimes you know it's it's
[5:17] we make yielding a lot more difficult
[5:19] than what it is yielding is just giving
[5:21] giving over
[5:22] what are yourself what are you giving
[5:24] yourself to that's it's just that simple
[5:27] and we can complicate it and we can make
[5:28] it as as you know all kinds of things
[5:31] but it's just what are you giving
[5:33] yourself to
[5:36] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[5:39] for ye are not under the law
[5:41] but you're under grace
[5:44] what then shall we sin because we are
[5:46] not under the law but under grace god
[5:48] forbid
[5:49] the prophet said one time he said if you
[5:52] could be given a chance
[5:54] to have one night
[5:56] and just go out and do whatever you want
[5:59] and it wouldn't be held to your account
[6:01] he said if you say i will i would go out
[6:03] and i would tear up the town he said you
[6:06] got the wrong spirit
[6:08] even if you had the absolute freedom
[6:12] to go and do whatever you want to do
[6:15] and that thing would not be held against
[6:17] you in the eyes of god
[6:19] i would still want to live for him
[6:21] amen and that should be the desire in
[6:24] the believer's heart because when you
[6:25] realize what god did for you it's it's
[6:28] all you can do to give back to him the
[6:31] best you can we fail absolutely we
[6:34] absolutely fail we're in these bodies of
[6:36] flesh we're going to find this out here
[6:38] as we read
[6:39] but
[6:40] god forbid
[6:42] know ye not that to whom you yield
[6:44] yourself servant to obey his servant ye
[6:47] are to whom ye obey
[6:50] whether of sin unto death or of
[6:52] obedience unto righteousness so if you
[6:54] want to know are you of god who are you
[6:57] who are you yielding your vessel to
[6:59] who are you choosing to obey amen
[7:04] so let's
[7:05] jump ahead here to chapter seven and
[7:08] verse seven
[7:10] and like i said i'm gonna be skipping
[7:12] around so just just hang with me
[7:17] i'm hoping after that surgery i don't
[7:19] sound so nasally when i talk too
[7:23] what shall we say then is the law sin
[7:27] god forbid
[7:29] nay i had not known sin but by the law
[7:31] for i had not known lust except the law
[7:34] had said thou shalt not covet
[7:36] but sin taking occasion by the
[7:38] commandment rotten me all manner of
[7:41] concupit concupiscence however you say
[7:43] that
[7:44] basically it means lust
[7:48] for without the law sin was dead
[7:51] now let's go to verse 11. we're just
[7:52] laying a foundation here
[7:54] for sin taking occasion by the
[7:57] commandment deceived me
[7:59] and by it slew me
[8:02] so sin will actually take what's right
[8:05] and use it against you
[8:08] it'll cause you to sin so
[8:10] all through romans 6 and 7 here paul's
[8:13] paul's laying out basically to me
[8:15] as i read it it was it was a war within
[8:18] himself
[8:19] and he writes how knowing the law
[8:21] brought that war
[8:23] and i believe that the war is present
[8:25] with us today this this war doesn't
[8:27] change it actually at some point in our
[8:29] lives i feel like each of us have this
[8:32] war within us different seasons of our
[8:35] lives
[8:36] with and without the holy ghost this war
[8:38] is is is ever present with us because
[8:42] we're bodies of flesh
[8:44] so paul is actually saying there was no
[8:46] knowledge of sin without the law
[8:48] so before the law he actually says there
[8:51] was basically he says there was no sin
[8:53] because
[8:54] there was no mind of sin there was there
[8:56] was nothing to say hey this is sinful
[8:59] there's nothing to say hey this is right
[9:01] and this is wrong
[9:03] it was just
[9:04] i i just love what what that that
[9:07] revelation that brother paul brought on
[9:09] sunday that you know adam and eve didn't
[9:11] need to know right and wrong
[9:13] that was all in god
[9:15] and that took care of it all
[9:17] but then man wanted a part to play and
[9:19] so god gave us the law
[9:21] and then comes the the
[9:23] the sin the the good and evil
[9:27] so before that there was no knowledge of
[9:29] it which is why the law is what condemns
[9:32] us to death
[9:34] and yet exposes sin
[9:37] as the death-causing life-ruining
[9:40] attribute of the devil that it is
[9:42] so it's almost like a double-edged sword
[9:44] to it you know there's there's it seems
[9:46] like well there's a good side to the law
[9:48] and then it seems like well there's a
[9:49] bad side to the law so you know really
[9:52] you know you could in your mind say well
[9:54] then let's do away with the law well
[9:56] that's not the right answer either
[9:59] you get in trouble
[10:02] paul writes that the law has no power in
[10:04] and of itself and is what makes us
[10:06] miserable when we know it by letter but
[10:09] without the spirit
[10:12] so many sit in churches for years
[10:14] including message churches
[10:16] i had even messaged churches and i
[10:18] thought i'm not trying to sound snobby
[10:21] you know we're not well even message
[10:23] churches
[10:24] no any church doesn't matter who you are
[10:26] you're sin born flesh i don't care what
[10:28] church you sit in i don't care what the
[10:30] name is on the door i don't care what
[10:32] preach what's preached in that church
[10:34] your sin born flesh
[10:37] so we can sit in the churches and and
[10:39] often times as young people we do we sit
[10:42] in church
[10:43] we hear the word
[10:44] we hear the the pure
[10:46] revealed word of the hour
[10:49] and we sit there and and it makes us
[10:51] miserable
[10:53] because we're hearing the word and you
[10:55] start you start hearing the things it's
[10:58] it's it's just a letter that contends
[11:00] and tells you what you can't do
[11:03] you shouldn't do the things you're doing
[11:07] and you should be doing the things
[11:08] you're not doing
[11:10] and when you're when you're living in
[11:11] that state that state and you're sitting
[11:13] there in that state you're just you're
[11:15] of men most miserable
[11:17] because you haven't yet received the
[11:19] holy ghost
[11:20] his spirit to live it out through you
[11:23] so it's this constant war within
[11:25] yourself that within ourselves that you
[11:28] know it's it's just you want to do right
[11:30] but you find yourself doing wrong and
[11:32] and that's going to continue
[11:34] but when you get the holy ghost it gives
[11:36] you the power to live it
[11:38] and it gives you it gives you
[11:40] understanding of all these things it
[11:43] it's not easy but it makes more sense
[11:46] amen
[11:47] when you have just the law just the
[11:49] letter of the law it's it's just the the
[11:52] blood of bulls and goats and it it could
[11:54] never actually take away that guilt of
[11:56] sin
[11:57] and so you have that hunger and you have
[11:59] that desire for sin and to to do the
[12:02] things that you ought not to do and
[12:04] and often times you're yielding your
[12:06] vessel to it
[12:07] but when you get the holy ghost it says
[12:09] no
[12:10] it's it's not the letter that's saying
[12:12] it's wrong it's the spirit of god that's
[12:14] saying it's wrong
[12:16] and it's it's the spirit of god that'll
[12:18] say hey don't go there don't do that
[12:20] don't touch that thing because that's
[12:21] gonna burn you that's gonna hurt you
[12:25] the difference between the two groups
[12:29] is the people
[12:30] you know you you you'll sit there and
[12:32] you'll watch and you'll you'll hear
[12:34] testimonies of people living a
[12:35] victorious life and and
[12:39] sometimes as you sit there you're god's
[12:42] dealing with your heart and you're
[12:43] desiring that victory that victory
[12:45] you you want to see that victory in your
[12:47] life
[12:48] and what's the difference it's the
[12:50] spirit of god it's the spirit of christ
[12:54] you know it's i was thinking
[12:57] uh
[12:59] i
[13:00] i was thinking about just a visual of
[13:02] this you know don't don't touch that and
[13:04] what that is and we built some uh
[13:07] flower boxes
[13:08] at the house and the neighbor has a
[13:10] horse and and uh i i'll just step out
[13:14] from behind the pulpit i hope it's okay
[13:15] to say poop
[13:18] but we went over and we got the got the
[13:20] horse manure
[13:21] and we we brought it back and you know
[13:23] you can't say manure to the kids because
[13:25] they don't quite understand that so
[13:27] you know joey's right there and he's
[13:29] helping me and
[13:30] and i'm shoveling it out and things and
[13:32] one just kind of rolls off to the side
[13:34] and joey's looking at it and i said
[13:36] don't touch that son
[13:38] and he's looking at it i said joey don't
[13:40] that's yucky don't touch it you know
[13:42] and he looks at it and he says that's
[13:44] the poop
[13:45] and i said yeah that's
[13:47] that's the poop don't touch it
[13:49] and so he bends down like this
[13:52] i said joey don't touch that that's
[13:54] yucky
[13:56] he's looking at it he's looking at me
[13:58] and i turn my back for two seconds and i
[14:00] turn around and what's joey doing
[14:04] he said joey now you gotta go wash your
[14:06] hands
[14:10] but it's you know it's it's like the
[14:12] holy spirit does for us he says that's
[14:14] that's don't touch that
[14:17] don't pick that up
[14:19] don't touch that that buddy that that
[14:21] stove it's hot don't touch the hot stove
[14:23] you're gonna get burned and
[14:25] it it's like it's like the poo you gotta
[14:28] touch it you got to find out for
[14:30] yourself
[14:32] and then you get burned
[14:34] but
[14:35] you know we we take that as a as a child
[14:38] but you know we all we've all done it we
[14:40] all do it
[14:41] you know that that warning that it's
[14:43] such a sweet warning of the holy spirit
[14:46] that says don't go there don't do that
[14:49] you know and it's and it's like and i've
[14:51] said this before here so i don't mean to
[14:52] sound like a broken record but
[14:55] you know i've had it in my life when
[14:57] when even before temptation comes
[15:01] the holy spirit's there to warn you
[15:04] and you know so you're sitting there and
[15:05] all of a sudden something feels
[15:07] different
[15:08] and you think
[15:10] you know you just make sure your
[15:13] your spiritual senses start tingling you
[15:16] know
[15:18] and and then all of a sudden the
[15:20] temptation hits
[15:21] and ah okay
[15:23] so now i know what that was the holy
[15:25] spirit was warning me that this was
[15:26] coming
[15:27] you know really
[15:29] it's it's kind of cheating
[15:31] it's like it's like giving you the the
[15:33] answer to the question before the
[15:35] question comes right the holy spirit
[15:36] does that for us
[15:38] oh how he loves us amen
[15:42] but this is but this is what the devil
[15:44] does is he he entices and he tempts you
[15:46] until you sin
[15:48] and then he'll he'll use the word of god
[15:51] and he'll condemn you to hell by it
[15:54] so he's the one telling you do this do
[15:56] this do this putting that temptation on
[15:58] you and then
[16:00] you do it
[16:01] and then he's right there to say oh
[16:03] buddy you know you're going to go to
[16:05] church tomorrow
[16:07] you just did that last night and you're
[16:08] going to go to church you're going to
[16:10] sit there and try to worship and
[16:12] and pray you're going to pray
[16:14] to god
[16:16] and god's the one saying that
[16:19] he said
[16:20] ask confess it and i'm faithful and just
[16:24] to forgive you
[16:25] it's
[16:26] he's given us all the answers already
[16:28] he's he
[16:30] he set this up so beautifully
[16:32] that you have to win
[16:35] he's so determined and that and that's
[16:37] why he sent his spirit it wasn't good
[16:40] enough just to have the law
[16:42] but he sends the spirit of the law so
[16:44] that we can live it
[16:48] and you know as i said we don't do away
[16:50] with the law just well just forget it
[16:52] then that's not the answer
[16:56] if i go as far as i can away from it
[16:59] i'll feel better
[17:01] but that's not it that's not the right
[17:03] approach
[17:04] paul actually goes on to say that the
[17:06] law is good
[17:08] because like we said you wouldn't know
[17:10] that that was wrong unless there was the
[17:11] law so
[17:14] i don't want to keep
[17:15] beating this but hopefully i'm laying
[17:17] the foundation
[17:19] the problem of it lies in the old sinful
[17:21] nature
[17:23] so paul paul writes about this and he
[17:25] gives us a key
[17:27] and
[17:29] verse chapter 7 verse 14. you got your
[17:32] bibles with you
[17:34] all right we're gonna we're gonna be
[17:36] turning
[17:37] looking at him quite a bit
[17:41] why is there such a battle in ourselves
[17:43] what is it paul writes for we know that
[17:45] the law is spiritual
[17:48] but i am carnal sold under sin
[17:52] born in sin shaped in iniquity we come
[17:54] into the world speaking lies you were
[17:56] you were sold into sin adam gave up his
[17:59] rights
[18:00] that's the fault came through adam and
[18:02] eve and that was that was selling the
[18:05] birthright so to speak
[18:07] so now we we know that the law is
[18:10] actually spiritual but we're the problem
[18:13] it's not the law
[18:14] paul says we're the problem it's this
[18:17] old sinful carnal nature
[18:20] verse 16
[18:22] if then i do that which i would not
[18:25] i consent unto the law that it is good
[18:30] so the war within me paul says
[18:32] is caused by the law
[18:35] and sin proves the word is good and
[18:38] right because i want to do good
[18:41] yet i find myself doing the things i
[18:43] hate
[18:44] it was the word that showed me i was
[18:46] doing wrong to begin with
[18:49] verse 18
[18:50] for i know that in me
[18:52] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[18:54] thing
[18:56] for to will is present with me and how
[18:59] to perform that which is good i find not
[19:03] paul says i'm no good
[19:06] and guess what
[19:08] if paul was no good
[19:12] you're no good either
[19:15] i know i'm not good
[19:18] so maybe if some of you don't know
[19:19] you're no good just let the preacher
[19:22] tell you tonight
[19:24] you're no good we're no good i'm no good
[19:28] there's nothing good within me
[19:30] in and of myself
[19:32] i want to do right but i just can't find
[19:35] the know-how to do it
[19:37] right
[19:39] and it's and it just it's this war you
[19:41] can see how it just it tears us up
[19:44] sometimes
[19:45] amen anyone else been there
[19:49] anyone else been there even with the
[19:51] holy ghost
[19:53] amen
[19:55] now we come to an important separation
[19:57] here though
[19:58] and why we shouldn't walk away from the
[20:00] word because of this war we feel
[20:04] let's read uh verse 20 to the end
[20:08] chapter 7 verse 20.
[20:11] now if i do that
[20:13] i would not
[20:14] it is no more i
[20:17] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[20:20] paul just separated it for us
[20:23] yeah you're carnal
[20:25] yeah the law is requiring this of us
[20:27] but paul paul says but
[20:30] i'm desiring to do good
[20:32] i i want to live the word of god
[20:36] i want to live this thing i want this ex
[20:38] i want jesus christ expressed through my
[20:41] life and even as much as i fail and as
[20:44] much as i'm just oh he says oh wretched
[20:46] man that i am
[20:49] he he he draws a line in the sand here
[20:52] if if that's in your heart
[20:55] then it's not you that does it it's the
[20:57] sin that dwells in you
[21:00] 21 i find then a law
[21:03] that when i would do good
[21:05] evil is present with me
[21:09] for i delight in the law of god after
[21:11] the inward man
[21:13] it's that inward
[21:16] but i see another law in my members
[21:19] warring against the law of my mind and
[21:21] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[21:23] sin which is in my members
[21:26] o wretched man
[21:27] that i am who shall deliver me from the
[21:30] body of this death
[21:32] but then watch as he as as our picture
[21:35] changes
[21:36] from from a war and what feels like
[21:38] defeat within us to victory i thank god
[21:42] through jesus christ our lord
[21:44] so then that with
[21:46] with the mind i find uh i'm sorry
[21:49] so then with the mind i myself serve the
[21:51] law of god but with the flesh the law of
[21:54] sin
[21:55] there's these two laws working within
[21:58] you
[21:59] the law of god the law of the spirit and
[22:01] the law of sin and death
[22:03] they're ever present with you
[22:05] brother branham said it's a cockleburn
[22:07] nature
[22:09] and it's with you until we get out of
[22:11] here until this body changes
[22:14] amen
[22:16] but i just love that it's not me doing
[22:19] the wrong anymore it's the sin that i'm
[22:21] stuck with in this flesh
[22:24] and god has grace for that
[22:28] like we said is that law to sin
[22:30] absolutely not
[22:32] is it law to yield your vessel to
[22:35] whatever you
[22:36] whatever you want whatever you desire
[22:38] absolutely not
[22:40] we shouldn't make grace a disgrace
[22:43] amen
[22:44] we shouldn't trample over the blood of
[22:47] jesus christ
[22:50] we we should use it
[22:52] to war amen
[22:55] use the blood of jesus christ to war
[23:00] so let's go to chapter eight now
[23:05] and watch how beautiful this is this
[23:07] this is just
[23:10] this is i i know i keep saying this but
[23:12] it's just it's a beautiful setup
[23:16] there is
[23:18] therefore now no condemnation to them
[23:20] which are in christ jesus
[23:22] who walk not after the flesh
[23:25] but after the spirit
[23:31] no condemnation
[23:33] how
[23:34] because the desire on the inside is to
[23:36] do right
[23:37] to do the will of god by living out the
[23:39] word of god
[23:41] our opening scripture said he that
[23:43] searches the heart
[23:45] if he searches the heart then he sees
[23:47] the desires to do right according to his
[23:49] word
[23:51] and that's what he's looking at
[23:53] it's like
[23:56] it's like he just says i have an
[23:57] understanding
[23:59] i understand
[24:00] what you're going through
[24:02] but i'm i'm not going to look at that
[24:05] i'm going to look at this
[24:07] i'm going to look at your desire
[24:10] blessed are they who hunger and thirst
[24:12] for they shall be filled
[24:14] what's a thirst it's a desire
[24:18] the young people laughed at me because
[24:20] one time i was talking about courtship
[24:22] and things and i said you know
[24:24] you get a young girl or a young guy and
[24:26] and
[24:26] you know they're thirsting for something
[24:28] they're thirsting for a mate and they
[24:30] all just thought that was hilarious
[24:32] because
[24:34] thirsting after
[24:37] a man or a woman it just sounds funny so
[24:40] it's a desire
[24:46] verse 2
[24:48] for the law of the spirit
[24:50] of life in christ jesus hath made me
[24:53] free
[24:54] from the law of sin and death
[24:56] so these laws are warring within us and
[24:59] yet there's a law in jesus christ that
[25:02] jesus brought by going to the cross by
[25:05] dying on the cross and giving his spirit
[25:08] back to us that really
[25:12] i want to say it overrides the law of
[25:14] sin and death
[25:15] does that override your will no it
[25:18] doesn't
[25:19] it gives you power
[25:21] to override the law of sin it gives you
[25:24] power to override the temptation in your
[25:26] life
[25:27] amen
[25:30] it gives us victory
[25:32] so verse 3 for what the law could not do
[25:35] in that it was weak through the flesh
[25:39] god sending his own son in the likeness
[25:42] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[25:45] sin in the flesh
[25:49] god took care of it
[25:51] that's how we're victorious that the
[25:53] righteousness of the law might be
[25:54] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[25:57] flesh
[25:59] but after the spirit
[26:04] so
[26:10] this is this is what grabbed my
[26:12] attention when i was reading the
[26:13] scriptures
[26:14] are you okay with a bible study tonight
[26:19] is this this
[26:21] term that paul keeps using of walking
[26:23] after the spirit
[26:27] he he keeps saying it walk after the
[26:29] spirit walk after the spirit don't walk
[26:32] after the flesh
[26:34] you know it's
[26:35] i need to come up with a better example
[26:37] i can't say poo during the whole sermon
[26:41] but
[26:45] but it's like it's it's like the it's
[26:46] like the horse manure
[26:49] you know quit
[26:50] you know joey quit walking towards the
[26:53] manure
[26:55] walk away from it
[26:56] get get you know what that's it's
[26:59] sin it's
[27:00] it's the flesh it's like manure
[27:03] right
[27:04] i mean that's what it is
[27:06] you know sin is just
[27:09] it's it's an abomination before the lord
[27:11] it's it's the stink it's it's
[27:14] just that putrifying smell that takes
[27:17] your breath away
[27:18] that's what sin is like so quit walking
[27:21] towards it
[27:22] you say i'm i'm tired of living this way
[27:24] well stop walking towards that
[27:26] walk the other way
[27:28] instead of going to this you know when
[27:30] when the temptation comes stop going
[27:33] towards it go the opposite direction
[27:36] change change your focus change your
[27:38] atmosphere that you're in change the
[27:40] scenery i love what brother boaz said
[27:43] take it to a different dimension
[27:46] go fight on your ground not the devil's
[27:48] ground
[27:50] when you when you walk towards the
[27:51] manure pile you're on satan's ground
[27:54] amen
[27:56] walk towards god
[28:00] so the law was still only dealing with
[28:02] the flesh we needed something to go
[28:04] deeper into the soul where the nature of
[28:06] sin was and deal with that nature
[28:09] the law of the spirit of life that was
[28:10] in christ jesus christ gives us
[28:12] overcoming prevailing power
[28:16] against the law of sin and death so paul
[28:18] keeps emphasizing this walk after the
[28:20] spirit
[28:22] so let's read 15 we're going to read a
[28:24] little
[28:25] read on through here
[28:28] excuse me
[28:34] for they that are after the flesh
[28:37] do mine the things of the flesh
[28:40] but they that are after the spirit the
[28:42] things of the spirit it's exactly what
[28:44] we're saying when you walk after when
[28:47] you walk towards that temptation you're
[28:49] minding that temptation
[28:52] you're being obedient to it you're
[28:53] giving yourself to it but he says walk
[28:56] after the spirit when you're when you're
[28:59] not i'm not talking about
[29:04] you know that that saying you're so
[29:05] heavenly minded you're no earthly good
[29:07] i'm not talking about something like
[29:09] that but i'm talking about an overcoming
[29:11] prevailing power
[29:13] walk after the spirit
[29:15] you know
[29:16] think on the scripture
[29:18] get into the word
[29:19] you know do those things that you know
[29:20] to do
[29:22] it's it's it's not as complicated as we
[29:24] make it
[29:25] amen usually when we make it complicated
[29:28] it's because we're wanting to go play in
[29:30] the manure
[29:31] right
[29:33] this is a terrible sermon
[29:38] for to be carnally minded is death
[29:41] this is why to be carnally minded is
[29:44] death but to be spiritually minded is
[29:47] life
[29:48] and peace
[29:50] so we got this war that's within us
[29:53] and paul is saying are you tired of
[29:55] warring
[29:56] you want peace you want life
[29:58] then walk after the spirit
[30:02] because the carnal mind is enmity
[30:04] against god for it is not subject to the
[30:07] law of god neither indeed can be
[30:10] so then
[30:12] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[30:14] god
[30:17] you want to please god
[30:20] but we get into the flesh and and listen
[30:23] i i don't wan i'm not preaching
[30:26] uh absolute perfection here okay we
[30:29] repent we make it right we get it under
[30:31] the blood and we go on
[30:33] we go on to the spirit the spirit's over
[30:35] here we go on walking after the spirit
[30:39] amen
[30:44] but you know
[30:46] i thought of this today too sometimes we
[30:48] give ourselves permission to get into
[30:50] the flesh
[30:53] well they treated me wrong so i'm going
[30:54] to fly off the handle at them
[30:56] i'm justified by it bless god because
[31:00] they treated me bad
[31:02] well this just says that when you walk
[31:04] after the flesh you're not pleasing god
[31:07] so you know i think
[31:09] as much as it
[31:10] ah you know you fight against it i think
[31:13] anyone would admit when you get in the
[31:15] flesh
[31:16] okay yeah i got in the flesh
[31:19] right
[31:20] and that's not pleasing to god
[31:24] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[31:26] spirit
[31:27] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[31:30] you
[31:31] now if any man have not the spirit of
[31:33] christ he is none of his
[31:37] so how do you get into the body of
[31:39] christ
[31:41] you're baptized into it i'm not talking
[31:43] about water baptism but baptism of the
[31:45] spirit
[31:46] amen
[31:48] but don't throw out water baptism now
[31:51] see you gotta you gotta
[31:53] bring the balance on these things
[31:54] because if someone's struggling with it
[31:56] they'll say oh well preacher gave me
[31:57] permission no i'm not giving you
[31:59] permission repent and be baptized every
[32:01] one of you for remission of sin and ye
[32:03] shall be filled with the holy ghost
[32:10] verse 10
[32:12] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[32:14] because of sin but the spirit is life
[32:17] because of righteousness
[32:19] but if the spirit of him that raised
[32:23] of jesus from the dead dwell in you
[32:25] he that raised up christ from the dead
[32:27] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[32:30] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[32:32] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[32:35] the flesh to live after the flesh
[32:37] for if ye live after the flesh he shall
[32:40] die
[32:41] but if he through the spirit do mortify
[32:43] the deeds of the body
[32:45] ye shall live
[32:49] see i want to go to verse 17. for as
[32:51] many as are led by the spirit of god
[32:53] they are the sons of god
[32:57] for ye have not received the spirit of
[32:59] bondage again to fear
[33:01] there's no bondage in jesus christ
[33:06] and
[33:07] you know
[33:09] go out go away and say this was bondage
[33:12] but that's because you were still living
[33:14] after the law of the flesh
[33:16] you wanted the things of the flesh and
[33:18] so that war was in you and so that's why
[33:20] you fell in bondage and that's why you
[33:22] feel free out there you get the spirit
[33:24] and you realize that this is freedom
[33:28] amen
[33:31] but ye have received the spirit of
[33:33] adoption whereby we cry abba father
[33:38] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[33:40] our spirit that we are the children of
[33:42] god i love the scripture
[33:45] because when the minister is preaching
[33:48] regardless of how
[33:50] sinful you feel
[33:52] your heart something that the minister
[33:54] is saying is connecting with your heart
[33:56] it's resonating on the inside that this
[33:59] is truth
[34:00] this is how i want to live
[34:03] this is how i want to be right here he
[34:06] says the spirit itself bears witness
[34:09] that's the spirit bearing witness that
[34:11] you are jesus christ
[34:14] you belong to him
[34:15] you might not be where you want to be
[34:17] you might not be
[34:19] living like like
[34:21] the next brother sitting next to you yet
[34:23] but we're all at different stages we're
[34:25] all growing into maturity amen
[34:28] so keep keep walking after the spirit
[34:31] attend to the things of the spirit
[34:33] because as you attend to it as you as
[34:36] you feed on the things that are
[34:38] spiritual you gain spiritual strength
[34:40] you start growing in the spirit amen
[34:46] and if children then heirs
[34:50] did i miss 16
[34:51] the spirit itself beareth witness okay
[34:53] that we are the children of god and if
[34:55] children then heirs heirs of god joint
[34:57] heirs with christ if so be that we
[35:00] suffer with him that we may be also
[35:02] glorified together
[35:05] your your that that spirit that's
[35:08] connecting with your spirit the spirit
[35:10] of god that's you it it opens you up
[35:14] it's saying you have availability to
[35:16] everything that jesus christ had
[35:19] you have availability to the power that
[35:22] he had to the authority that he had as
[35:25] brother paul's been preaching you have
[35:27] authority you have
[35:28] complete
[35:30] the the checkbook is is blank it's
[35:33] signed and the funds are in the bank all
[35:36] you have to do is write out the check
[35:39] that's it
[35:40] you have access
[35:42] to everything that jesus christ had
[35:45] access for
[35:47] so
[35:48] i started to
[35:50] go into this a little bit more walking
[35:52] after the spirit and i realized you know
[35:54] it was really all preached on sunday
[35:57] so i'm going to say
[35:59] insert sunday sermon here
[36:02] so go back and catch it if you didn't
[36:05] or if you just want to hear a good
[36:06] sermon again amen
[36:08] because it's it's coming under the
[36:11] headship of of the word coming under
[36:13] that headship of the spirit is what he
[36:15] was talking about amen and that's that's
[36:17] it's it's walking after the spirit it's
[36:19] doing the things that that
[36:22] turn you towards the spirit
[36:24] but i just thought of a little bit of a
[36:26] picture here
[36:27] walking after the spirit is about how
[36:30] you position yourself
[36:33] what direction you place the opening
[36:36] of your tent
[36:38] and i'm going to change that to say the
[36:40] opening of your senses
[36:43] not just not just these
[36:46] but your mind
[36:47] your imagination
[36:50] what what direction are you pitching
[36:52] your senses towards
[36:56] lot pitched his tent to the door so that
[36:59] the door opened towards sodom and
[37:00] gomorrah
[37:02] so when abraham and lot split up
[37:04] there was war between them right
[37:07] one was carnal one was spiritual
[37:09] so they had to divide they had to split
[37:12] let's not war between us
[37:15] abraham said lot you go choose what
[37:17] direction you want to go and i'll take
[37:19] the other one
[37:20] and lot said well i want to go down
[37:23] towards sodom and gomorrah
[37:25] and it wasn't just that he went down
[37:27] this is the manure pile
[37:29] it just wasn't that he went down and he
[37:31] he put his tent there
[37:33] but he actually said it so that the
[37:35] opening of it was facing the city
[37:38] so you can imagine that every morning
[37:40] when lot got up and his wife got up and
[37:43] they went out on the porch of the tent
[37:45] to have their coffee
[37:47] what did they walk out and see first
[37:48] thing in the morning with sodom and
[37:50] gomorrah
[37:52] it was the direction
[37:53] that
[37:54] all their senses it wasn't just the tent
[37:56] door
[37:57] it was all their senses were opening up
[38:00] to that first thing in the morning
[38:05] abraham on the other hand
[38:07] pitched his tent
[38:09] in the direction that god was going to
[38:12] come
[38:14] amen
[38:15] he pitched his tent think about this
[38:18] so i need i need more stage
[38:22] abraham pitched his tent
[38:24] so that the opening was the direction
[38:27] that god was going to come walking
[38:29] because if you remember the scripture
[38:31] when he stepped out and he was drinking
[38:33] coffee in the morning in the door of his
[38:36] tent
[38:37] it was from that direction that he was
[38:39] facing that god actually was walking
[38:41] towards him
[38:43] amen
[38:48] lot with the direction that his tent was
[38:50] facing
[38:52] wouldn't have known that the destruction
[38:55] was coming
[38:56] because it was coming from behind him he
[39:00] was facing the manure pile
[39:04] and being drawn towards the flesh
[39:08] being drawn towards the the law of the
[39:10] flesh the things that would would cause
[39:12] the fleshly desires to be enticed he was
[39:15] facing it but what he didn't realize is
[39:18] the same direction that abraham's tent
[39:21] was facing god was coming from this
[39:23] direction and yet that's the same
[39:25] direction that destruction was coming
[39:27] from
[39:29] so we really it's it's it's i want you
[39:31] to take away tonight that it's very
[39:33] important
[39:35] what direction you're pitching your tent
[39:39] what direction you're allowing your
[39:41] senses what are you feeding on what are
[39:43] you allowing yourself to intake first
[39:45] thing in the morning
[39:47] when you when you get out of bed and you
[39:49] get out of your tent and you go to drink
[39:51] your coffee what are you looking at
[39:54] amen
[39:55] what's your mind going to what are you
[39:58] what are you watching
[39:59] what are you listening to
[40:02] what are you allowing your thoughts to
[40:03] dwell on
[40:06] i don't know about you but i thought
[40:07] that was really good abraham pitched his
[40:10] tent the direction god was going to come
[40:13] sometimes it's just as simple as putting
[40:16] a filter on your phone
[40:20] well that's childish brother a man
[40:23] quit acting like a boy
[40:25] right
[40:27] quit acting like a boy
[40:29] put the filter on your phone if you need
[40:30] a filter
[40:31] give somebody access to go through your
[40:33] phone if you're struggling
[40:36] put it put the filter on the tablet or
[40:38] the computer
[40:40] maybe
[40:41] maybe it's as simple as deleting an app
[40:44] or deleting the game
[40:47] or throwing away the book or the
[40:49] magazine
[40:50] or the cds or the movies
[40:54] say well boy all those are on my phone
[40:55] nowadays i ain't throwing that away
[40:57] we'll get rid of them
[40:59] get rid of them
[41:01] it's it's it's that simple you're you're
[41:04] setting yourself up for failure every
[41:05] day if you leave it there
[41:11] maybe it's deleting accounts
[41:14] or it's unsubscribing
[41:17] you know you can block websites from
[41:20] your internet browser
[41:22] you can do that
[41:24] and i know that you can go in and shut
[41:26] them off too
[41:28] but it
[41:29] it might make you think twice
[41:32] right
[41:35] maybe if you're if you turned your
[41:37] direction towards the things of god
[41:40] you'd see jesus christ running after you
[41:44] you'd see him wanting to fill you with
[41:46] your spirit more than even you want it
[41:50] you know i think of the prodigal son it
[41:51] wasn't just that the father saw him afar
[41:54] off and he started walking to him
[41:56] it was the father was
[41:58] you know
[41:59] girding up the loins and taking off he
[42:02] was he was high tailing it to the sun
[42:05] and if we just turn our focus to that
[42:07] direction we would realize that christ
[42:10] that's what we're talking about tonight
[42:11] that's what i'm trying to that's that's
[42:13] the beauty that i keep saying if i could
[42:15] just i just see it as a beautiful
[42:17] picture of god dropping everything that
[42:20] he had
[42:21] everything that he could call glorious
[42:23] and that made him god from the very
[42:26] beginning he dropped it all to run after
[42:29] you and i
[42:30] and if you just turn your focus to god
[42:32] you'd see him running after you
[42:35] you know you're you're going this way
[42:37] you're running hightailing it towards
[42:39] the floodings of the flesh but you you
[42:42] if you just look over your shoulder at
[42:44] least you'd see jesus christ running
[42:46] after you
[42:47] trying to catch you trying to pull you
[42:49] back and say no no no there's something
[42:51] better over here
[42:54] it's a lot less stinky over there
[43:02] so let's open up go to james 1
[43:07] and verse 5.
[43:12] because i want to make this as simple as
[43:14] i believe that it is
[43:19] if i can find james
[43:26] james 1 and verse 5
[43:29] if any of you lack wisdom
[43:33] let him ask of god
[43:36] that giveth to all men
[43:38] say it with me liberally
[43:42] and abradeth not and it shall be given
[43:45] him
[43:47] you have need of something in your life
[43:50] you want the spirit of god you want more
[43:52] of the spirit of god ask him
[43:56] because this says he gives it liberally
[43:59] not not just
[44:01] not just you know
[44:04] i ain't got nothing to give you gideon
[44:08] here
[44:11] [Laughter]
[44:13] it's not just here gideon
[44:16] you're gideon
[44:18] god says no
[44:19] you're
[44:20] gideon spend all you want
[44:23] won't get you too far but you can spend
[44:25] all you want
[44:28] but with god it'll take you far
[44:30] it'll take you it'll just ask him
[44:33] and he gives it liberally
[44:35] gives you liberally the spirit he's
[44:36] wanting to give it to you more than you
[44:38] want it
[44:42] brother paul said sunday he said we
[44:44] bring our lives under the word
[44:47] position yourself to receive it
[44:51] it's as simple as reading your bible and
[44:54] praying
[44:56] don't make that listen that's not a law
[44:59] men men can take that and make it a law
[45:02] that oh my goodness i gotta i gotta read
[45:04] i gotta read the whole book of james
[45:06] today and tomorrow it's gotta be the
[45:08] book of matthew and and the next day and
[45:10] the next day what if it's one scripture
[45:13] just take one scripture and ponder on it
[45:16] amen just it's it's not complicated
[45:20] just read your bible and pray
[45:24] and you say well why do i got to do that
[45:26] well if i wrote you a letter
[45:30] or i sent someone to tell you a secret
[45:33] that would change your life
[45:36] i gave gideon my wallet
[45:38] and i said get in there's only so much
[45:40] on that card but i'm going to i'm going
[45:42] to send you a secret
[45:43] and i write it down on a piece of paper
[45:46] that there's a million dollars that he
[45:47] can deposit into the same account that
[45:49] that card draws from and i give him the
[45:52] piece of paper
[45:53] if gideon stuffed that in his pocket and
[45:55] he never read it it'd do him no good
[45:59] if i wrote you a letter
[46:02] that would change your life
[46:05] or if i sent a messenger
[46:07] to give you a message and tell you this
[46:10] very secret
[46:11] you would have to listen to that
[46:14] messenger
[46:15] or read that letter in order to get the
[46:17] benefit of what i was telling you
[46:20] amen
[46:21] so it's not a law
[46:23] there's a benefit in doing it
[46:26] just get into it just ask him just talk
[46:28] to him just
[46:30] just love him
[46:31] and accept his love for you
[46:34] amen
[46:36] we're almost done let's go to galatians
[46:38] 5.
[46:41] there's a glare on the clock back there
[46:43] so i really can't tell what time it is
[46:46] so we'll just keep going
[46:57] oh why can't i find it
[47:03] here we go
[47:05] galatians 5 verse 16.
[47:15] read to 18 this i say then
[47:17] walk in the spirit
[47:20] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[47:22] flesh
[47:23] paul just makes this easier and easier
[47:26] you don't want if you want to get away
[47:27] from the law of the flesh walk in the
[47:29] spirit
[47:31] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[47:33] and the spirit against the flesh
[47:35] and these are contrary the one to the
[47:37] other so that ye cannot do the things
[47:39] that you would
[47:40] but if you be led of the spirit ye are
[47:43] not under the law
[47:45] how beautiful let's skip to 24.
[47:50] and they that are christ have crucified
[47:52] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[47:56] if we live in the spirit let us also
[47:59] walk in the spirit
[48:02] so you can say you live in the spirit
[48:03] all you want
[48:05] but if you live in the spirit really
[48:06] live in it you walk in the spirit every
[48:09] day
[48:10] amen
[48:13] you got those quotes up there
[48:18] just a couple of quotes i'm coming down
[48:19] to a close
[48:21] did you have you gotten something out of
[48:22] tonight
[48:24] amen
[48:29] i'm just gonna start reading and you
[48:30] catch me if you can
[48:35] did you say what
[48:37] all right i'm just going to start
[48:38] reading
[48:39] now to restore back his kinship to bring
[48:42] back
[48:43] now he had to let them get lost you
[48:45] understand it
[48:46] he had to let them sin put them on free
[48:49] moral
[48:50] now
[48:51] i had a
[48:52] jehovah witness one time come to the
[48:54] house
[48:56] and normally i try to avoid him
[48:59] but i thought i'm going to step out and
[49:00] talk to him this time i just
[49:02] curious
[49:04] and
[49:06] so they they somehow we got on the fall
[49:09] and i can't remember exactly what i said
[49:12] but they gasped and they said you mean
[49:15] to tell me that you believe god knew
[49:17] that they would fall
[49:19] god wouldn't do that and he can't be god
[49:23] and i'm thinking
[49:24] if god didn't know that they would do
[49:26] that he's not god right i mean
[49:28] if he's god he's got to know it but
[49:31] but watch us now so don't don't let this
[49:33] stumble you that that god had to let
[49:35] them get lost but watch how he did it
[49:37] he had to let them sin put them on free
[49:39] moral he could not make them sin and
[49:42] remain god and then punish them for
[49:45] something he had them made them do
[49:48] but when he put man on partnership with
[49:50] him
[49:51] now i love this because brother paul
[49:54] brought it out that adam and eve satan
[49:57] when he came to eve he said but if if
[49:59] you take of this tree he said you shall
[50:01] be gods
[50:02] brother paul said they were already gods
[50:05] and this is god god made man partners
[50:08] with him
[50:09] not not less
[50:11] not more partners equal partners they
[50:14] were gods
[50:17] but
[50:18] when he put man on partnership with him
[50:20] then let man act as a free moral agent
[50:22] see the same thing he's got you on today
[50:25] c c
[50:26] you act any way you want to you're a
[50:29] free moral agent so therefore if he put
[50:32] the first like that he has to put the
[50:34] second like that
[50:35] he has to put everyone like that or he
[50:38] acted wrong in the first place
[50:41] see but everybody is on the same basis
[50:45] do you have that next one
[50:47] and the very thing that man fell and
[50:49] become lost
[50:50] he become the savior so you have this
[50:53] fall because of free moral agency but
[50:56] then this is saying he does he's going
[50:57] to do the exact same thing
[50:59] and the very thing that man fell and
[51:01] become lost he become the savior of that
[51:03] taking his own law and he could not do
[51:06] it as that great jehovah that covered
[51:08] all space time see he couldn't do it and
[51:11] he had to become a man and he took
[51:13] kinship with the man that was lost amen
[51:16] and become a man god made flesh
[51:19] god became
[51:21] god became from god to become me
[51:24] to take
[51:28] to take
[51:29] my sin upon him that he might make me
[51:32] him amen
[51:34] back to his great purpose of sons and
[51:36] daughters of god for he is the eternal
[51:38] father he became me that i might become
[51:42] him
[51:42] amen
[51:44] let's do that last one
[51:48] it's not expressions of some church that
[51:50] we should express something it's a life
[51:52] that you don't live yourself
[51:55] it takes the pressure off of you
[51:58] but he comes in you and lives by a self
[52:01] how by the spirit
[52:03] and you become a prisoner to any human
[52:06] intellectual being at all you're led by
[52:08] the spirit and how do you know than
[52:11] skipping down but if you have the mind
[52:13] of christ
[52:14] christ
[52:18] christ
[52:20] expresses himself through you
[52:22] shows that it's him and not
[52:25] and it's not you
[52:27] you've not lost your mind
[52:29] and then he he talks about that a little
[52:31] bit but he says but a real man is to
[52:34] lose his own thoughts and his own
[52:36] thinking not come up blindly
[52:38] so he's trying to he's trying to explain
[52:40] this so don't let this confuse you it's
[52:42] not just that you become a robot
[52:44] it's not just you you lose your mind
[52:47] completely and you know we're all insane
[52:50] but he says it's not something you come
[52:52] blindly you lose your thoughts as in you
[52:55] lay your thoughts down and you take his
[52:57] thoughts up
[53:00] no sir you come up with your right
[53:02] senses and christ takes you over and
[53:05] expresses itself
[53:07] and now to the world you're an insane
[53:09] person
[53:10] but when christ takes you over he'll
[53:12] express that word right through you
[53:14] because it's him
[53:17] he is the word see and then you can see
[53:19] the expression of christ not some
[53:21] illusion of some sort but a real genuine
[53:24] christ expressing himself right through
[53:27] you how beautiful
[53:30] amen
[53:31] you can stand to your feet
[53:38] this this war that's within us
[53:42] and it's warring and we feel it we feel
[53:44] it at times and seasons in our life we
[53:46] feel it when temptation comes what is it
[53:48] it's that law of sin trying to come back
[53:51] and cause you to war within yourself
[53:54] but if you just give over to the word
[53:56] and you take god's thoughts what's god's
[53:58] thoughts his word
[54:00] you take god's thoughts and it just does
[54:02] away with that
[54:05] it it if if you'll just pitch your tent
[54:09] towards jesus christ towards the spirit
[54:11] walk after the spirit then
[54:13] then it does away with it and then
[54:15] christ expresses himself through you
[54:18] amen
[54:20] amen
[54:24] giddy and i as much as i want to try to
[54:26] sing
[54:27] i just can't
[54:34] let's let's bow our heads and pray and
[54:35] i'll turn it over to these guys and grow
[54:40] heavenly father we we just love you
[54:43] tonight and
[54:44] lord i just pray god that the people
[54:46] could see father how
[54:48] how you set up this plan
[54:51] of redemption and
[54:53] and how you just said it lord so that
[54:55] your spirit just completely does
[54:57] everything
[54:59] not everything in the sense of pushing
[55:01] us through a pipe and pulling us out the
[55:03] other side but
[55:04] all the tools are there
[55:07] and all we have to do is yield to it
[55:11] so father i i pray it's
[55:14] it's simple
[55:17] and yet lord it's it truly is a war at
[55:19] times
[55:22] because
[55:24] because we are carnal lord in our in our
[55:26] own flesh
[55:29] because we still have that flesh nature
[55:32] these flesh
[55:33] bodies born in sin
[55:37] lord that war is ever present with us as
[55:40] paul said
[55:41] but i'm so glad that paul didn't just
[55:44] leave it there
[55:46] but lord your word says that the word of
[55:49] god was written by inspiration of the
[55:51] holy ghost
[55:53] so that same spirit
[55:55] that wants to indwell us and help us to
[55:57] make it
[55:59] to help us to to be victorious lives and
[56:03] to
[56:04] let you express yourself through us that
[56:06] same spirit
[56:07] moved upon paul to write these things
[56:11] that even going back to our opening
[56:13] scripture
[56:15] when we don't even know what to pray
[56:18] sometimes lord i've i've been in prayer
[56:21] and
[56:23] and all's that i know lord is that i
[56:25] need i need help
[56:28] i don't know exactly what that looks
[56:30] like i don't know what that is but i
[56:32] just know that i need i need you
[56:36] and i need the help and the strength of
[56:38] your spirit
[56:41] father even when we don't know
[56:46] your word says that the spirit will
[56:48] intercede for us
[56:51] [Music]
[56:53] i think lord
[56:56] maybe we'll sing it later is i think
[57:00] listen to our hearts
[57:04] father because we lack words so many
[57:06] times
[57:09] god even when i say i love you lord it
[57:12] just doesn't feel
[57:14] it just doesn't feel right it doesn't
[57:16] feel like enough
[57:19] if somebody's struggling here tonight
[57:21] god
[57:25] then lord i just pray father let your
[57:27] spirit come on the scene
[57:31] fill that person lord maybe they just
[57:33] lift it
[57:35] lift their hands to you now to let them
[57:37] know that they need you
[57:39] lord my hand's lifted lord i need you
[57:44] i want to live lord like christ lived i
[57:46] want to
[57:49] i want to walk after the spirit i want
[57:51] the spirit to lead me i want the spirit
[57:52] to take my vocal cords and
[57:57] and speak i i want to
[58:00] lord i hope it's not wrong to say i want
[58:03] to see visions lord i want to
[58:06] i want to lay hands on the sick and then
[58:07] be recovered but lord even more than
[58:10] that i want to live an overcoming life
[58:12] [Music]
[58:14] those things are good but father what is
[58:16] it without a life to back it up
[58:20] i pray god that tonight
[58:22] it would be the power and demonstration
[58:24] that was preached
[58:27] and that you would just take control now
[58:31] of every vessel we love you lord
[58:35] help us god when temptation comes on
[58:37] your word promised you'd give you gave a
[58:39] way of escape
[58:41] let us turn to your way lord
[58:45] help us to just simply yield to you
[58:49] we love you bless our pastor and his
[58:51] family as they're out resting
[58:53] i just pray that they would come home
[58:55] refreshed and
[58:57] just have blessed memories together and
[59:02] and i pray god watch over the flock lord
[59:07] while the shepherd's away lord i know
[59:09] brother paul would say it's the holy
[59:11] ghost that leads the church
[59:14] so that same holy ghost that leads the
[59:16] shepherd father i pray you'd lead us now
[59:20] watch over us lord keep us safe
[59:24] naturally and spiritually until we can
[59:26] meet again we love you
[59:28] lord let your people be encouraged i
[59:30] pray they're encouraged tonight in jesus
[59:32] christ's name
[59:34] amen
