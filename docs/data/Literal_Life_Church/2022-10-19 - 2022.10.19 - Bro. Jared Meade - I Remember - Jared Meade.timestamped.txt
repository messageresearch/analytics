[0:00] so if you guys go ahead and take your
[0:02] seats I just want to kind of relax a
[0:05] little bit but uh I was telling brother
[0:07] Brandon uh back in the office that uh
[0:10] for those of you who are in Sunday
[0:11] school on on Sunday You're Gonna you got
[0:13] a little bit of a a preview of what I'm
[0:15] going to be speaking on tonight
[0:18] um kind of to tell a funny story is that
[0:20] when brother Rapp had asked me to take
[0:22] Sunday School
[0:23] I decided especially since we had a full
[0:26] weekend of the Fall Fellowship
[0:27] the Lord kind of spoke to me to to use
[0:30] the last sermon that I had preached on
[0:31] in Virginia brother Steve coffees and so
[0:34] my wife and I stayed rather late as
[0:36] everyone did at the fall Fellowship
[0:37] because I knew kind of already prepared
[0:39] already had my notes
[0:41] um and I went home and I got on my
[0:43] computer and I opened them up so I could
[0:44] study a little bit and they were gone
[0:46] everything I had was lost so I stayed up
[0:48] about 2 30 in the morning trying to to
[0:51] remember everything that was in my notes
[0:52] and what made the story funny uh or more
[0:55] funny than uh just losing them was the
[0:57] the title of my topic was I remember
[1:01] so I told everyone in Sunday school that
[1:03] I was doing my best to remember my notes
[1:05] because I'd been been a few weeks since
[1:07] I'd actually uh kind of written them out
[1:10] but when brother Paul contacted me
[1:13] Sunday night I actually was in the midst
[1:14] of
[1:15] taking what I had started to build for
[1:17] Sunday school and was kind of rebuilding
[1:19] my sermon and so I just felt like the
[1:22] Lord was leading me that you know since
[1:23] brother Paul asked I'm just going to
[1:25] continue on with that and we'd speak on
[1:27] it again this evening so that will be my
[1:29] topic tonight as I remember
[1:31] um so if you guys just real quickly and
[1:33] I'm sorry to make you stand up again but
[1:34] just want to stand we'll read our
[1:36] opening scripture this evening in
[1:38] Deuteronomy chapter 8. starting in verse
[1:41] 11
[1:48] and we're going to be going to verse 20.
[1:51] so it says be beware that thou forget
[1:53] not the Lord thy God in not keeping his
[1:56] Commandments and his judgments and his
[1:58] statutes which I commanded thee this day
[2:01] lest when thou Hast eaten and art full
[2:03] and has built Godly houses and dwelt
[2:06] therein and when thy herds and thy
[2:08] flocks multiply and thy silver and thy
[2:10] gold is Multiplied and all that thou
[2:12] Hast is multiplied
[2:14] then thy heart be lifted up and thou
[2:16] forget the Lord thy God which brought
[2:18] thee forth out of the land of Egypt from
[2:19] the house of bondage
[2:21] who led thee through that great and
[2:23] terrible Wilderness where and where
[2:25] fiery serpents and scorpions and drought
[2:27] and there was no water who brought the
[2:30] fourth water out of the rock of Flint
[2:31] who fed thee in the wilderness with
[2:33] Manna which thy fathers knew not that he
[2:36] might humble thee and that he might
[2:37] prove thee to do thy the good at thy
[2:40] latter end
[2:41] and thou say in thy heart my power in
[2:43] the might of mine hand hath gotten me
[2:45] this wealth but Thou shalt remember the
[2:47] Lord thy God for it is he that giveth
[2:49] thee power to get wealth
[2:51] that he may establish his Covenant which
[2:53] he swear unto thy fathers at it as it is
[2:56] this day and that shall be if thou do at
[2:59] all forget the Lord thy God and walk
[3:01] after other gods and serve them
[3:03] and worship them I testify against you
[3:06] this day that ye shall surely perish
[3:08] as the nation which the Lord destroieth
[3:11] before your face so shall ye perish
[3:13] because you would not be obedient unto
[3:15] the voice of the Lord your God just bow
[3:17] our heads in a word of Prayer
[3:19] dear heavenly father we just come to you
[3:20] tonight Lord and just Lord thankful for
[3:23] another opportunity Lord just to gather
[3:25] around your word Lord and just
[3:28] hear from you this evening Lord father
[3:30] Lord I just pray that you Lord open our
[3:33] hearts this evening and take all away
[3:35] all nervousness Lord father and just use
[3:37] this this week and humble vessel Lord
[3:39] just to say something that might
[3:42] spark something within your children
[3:44] Lord father to draw them closer to you
[3:46] this evening Lord we just pray for all
[3:48] those that aren't able to be here this
[3:49] evening that you give them an extra
[3:51] special blessing Lord father and we just
[3:53] pray you bless the remainder their
[3:54] service in Jesus name we pray amen
[3:58] so you may be seated sorry
[4:01] I always hate when the minister forgets
[4:03] to say that
[4:04] so in these scriptures uh the the what
[4:08] is translated to forget in the Hebrew
[4:11] the root of that word it means to mislay
[4:14] to be oblivious of from want of memory
[4:18] or attention to stop remembering ignore
[4:21] dismiss from your mind abandon neglect
[4:25] or cease to care about
[4:27] um and I find this interesting because
[4:28] if you look at kind of the timeline of
[4:30] Deuteronomy
[4:32] this sermon of Moses takes place during
[4:34] a 40-day period right before the
[4:37] children of Israel are go to go into the
[4:39] promised land and so we all know when
[4:40] the children of Israel went in the
[4:41] promised land that Moses didn't go with
[4:43] them this was kind of the end of Moses's
[4:45] life and I find it interesting that at
[4:46] the end of his life uh here you have
[4:49] God's Prophet who he had spoke to God he
[4:53] saw God face to face he had held the
[4:55] Commandments that God had carved with
[4:56] his own hands
[4:58] just imagine the things that Moses could
[5:01] have told the people
[5:03] I I have to believe that Moses knew he
[5:05] was coming to the end and there's
[5:07] probably many things he could have
[5:09] shared with him Secrets he could have
[5:10] imparted in them um just information
[5:13] about the Lord and who he was but what
[5:17] God ordained him to speak about was
[5:19] remembering and I find that interesting
[5:22] um and that tells me that remembrance
[5:24] holds something significant not only to
[5:26] God
[5:27] but to the life of a Believer
[5:30] um for the children of Israel to come
[5:32] down to this point to Moses's entire
[5:34] life of everything he'd done and seen to
[5:36] come down to this point and that is what
[5:38] God wanted him to say to use his last
[5:39] words on Earth to say was to remember
[5:41] means is there something significant
[5:43] about that
[5:46] and so Moses knew that remembering was
[5:49] something that God's people had
[5:50] struggled with he knew it was something
[5:52] that they would continue to struggle
[5:53] with so he
[5:54] he used this these last sermons to to
[5:57] not only encourage them but also to
[5:59] admonish them
[6:01] um Moses over the years he had witnessed
[6:03] and we all know the story but he'd
[6:04] witnessed over and over again that God
[6:06] would do something for the children of
[6:08] Israel the children of Israel would
[6:09] worship God and praise God for what he
[6:11] had done and within a short period of
[6:13] time they would forget it and they'd
[6:15] turn away from God
[6:17] so Moses knew that this was a constant
[6:19] struggle and so he knew that going
[6:21] forward this would continue to be a
[6:23] struggle
[6:25] um and and again I know we all know this
[6:27] story but I just kind of want to lay a
[6:29] foundation but even though God had sent
[6:31] them a promise deliver through Moses he
[6:34] had sent that he'd brought the children
[6:35] of Israel out of bondage he kept them
[6:38] through the desert he gave them victory
[6:40] over their enemies he brought them to a
[6:42] Promised Land through all of that the
[6:45] children of Israel still complained
[6:48] and I'm just going to give a few
[6:50] examples but we I'm sure there's
[6:52] probably many more and some that you
[6:53] probably remember better than me but
[6:55] throughout the scripture Israel
[6:56] complains even before God delivered them
[6:59] when Moses first kind of came on the
[7:01] scene
[7:03] um they complained to Moses in Exodus 5
[7:05] because of all his talk about the
[7:07] promised land of all his talk about what
[7:09] God was going to do for them it caused
[7:11] pharaoh to say fine now you make bricks
[7:14] without straw and so the children of
[7:15] Israel were upset and they started to
[7:17] complain that all of his talk of God's
[7:19] promises were actually making their life
[7:21] worse
[7:23] in Exodus 14 uh the people complained
[7:25] and said told Moses leave us alone uh
[7:28] they said it would be better for us to
[7:30] serve the Egyptians than dying the
[7:31] desert so again we're at the point where
[7:33] they've seen miracles from God they had
[7:35] they had witnessed what God had done and
[7:37] they got to a point where they just said
[7:38] leave us alone we'd rather be in sin
[7:42] than to die here in the desert
[7:44] um in Exodus 15 the people complained
[7:46] about the bitter water
[7:48] uh in Exodus 16 they complain about
[7:50] being hungry and God gave the man and
[7:52] they you know they still complained no
[7:54] matter what God did for them no matter
[7:56] what God showed them
[7:57] their memory of what God was doing was
[7:59] short-lived again in Exodus 17 the
[8:03] people complained about being thirsty
[8:05] in Exodus 32 the people Moses went up to
[8:09] the mountain this was when he goes up to
[8:10] get the Ten Commandments from the Lord
[8:12] and to speak to the Lord and the people
[8:13] had such little patience that they
[8:17] forsook the Lord and they they
[8:19] built the golden calf and it angered the
[8:23] Lord
[8:23] um
[8:24] and what I want I want us to kind of
[8:26] talk about at this point was when we
[8:28] talk about remembering in order to
[8:31] create a memory and we'll talk about
[8:33] this more as we get into this it takes
[8:36] time it takes patience and we see in
[8:39] this instance the children of Israel
[8:41] they had no time for it they had no time
[8:43] to meditate on to remember to praise God
[8:48] for what he'd done they had very little
[8:51] or limited I should say patience for
[8:53] doing that the minute they felt like God
[8:55] was taking too long
[8:57] they turn from him
[9:00] again in numbers 12 we have Miriam and
[9:02] Aaron who complained about Moses's
[9:04] leadership
[9:06] numbers 14 the people complained about
[9:08] how difficult it looked to conquer the
[9:10] Giants in in the promised land and they
[9:12] refused to go
[9:14] again I want us to think about just
[9:16] imagine all that these people had seen
[9:19] God had delivered them from Egypt
[9:22] he had they'd seen the waters parted at
[9:24] the Red Sea God had fed them he had
[9:27] given them something to drink he had
[9:28] kept them in the desert they had all
[9:30] these victories over their enemies and
[9:32] yet through all of that
[9:34] they said God this is too big for you
[9:36] and they still complained that's
[9:39] fascinating to me
[9:40] um again and I know in our own lives we
[9:43] get this way and we'll get into this a
[9:44] little bit but to imagine seeing the
[9:47] actual Waters of the sea parted and then
[9:50] to tell God yes you did but this is too
[9:53] big I know you did that but this is too
[9:56] big again there was no remembrance of
[9:59] what God had done once it was over once
[10:02] they had seen the Miracles it never
[10:04] stuck
[10:05] and and so Moses was telling the
[10:08] children of Israel listen you have to
[10:10] remember you have to dwell on these
[10:13] things that God has done for us you have
[10:14] to and and I'm probably getting ahead of
[10:16] myself a little bit but
[10:18] for a memory to take hold into form it
[10:21] has to be something that you're
[10:22] constantly thinking about talking about
[10:25] remembering it can't just be something
[10:27] that we're oh this happened and we'll
[10:29] remember
[10:30] and trust me for those of you who aren't
[10:32] there yet the closer to 40 you get the
[10:35] more you need to do this because the
[10:37] long-term memory seems to to be even
[10:39] worse than it was when we were younger
[10:41] it's something that you constantly have
[10:43] to be remembering in in praising and
[10:46] testifying to what God's done amen
[10:50] um also if you look at scripture and
[10:52] again
[10:53] just the the topic of remembrance you'll
[10:56] find through from Genesis to Revelations
[10:58] you'll find it everywhere God is
[11:00] constantly telling his people to
[11:01] remember
[11:02] and one of the ways that God does this
[11:04] is that there's several stories through
[11:07] scripture where God
[11:09] um puts it on the heart of one of his
[11:11] children or commands his children to
[11:13] build memorials to something that he had
[11:15] done for them
[11:16] the first example would be when Jacob
[11:20] had his his vision of the stairway from
[11:22] Earth to heaven in Bethel when he awoke
[11:26] and he had that Vision he had such a
[11:28] strong feeling for what that meant and
[11:30] the experience that he had that he
[11:31] wanted to commemorate it and he didn't
[11:33] want to forget what it meant and so he
[11:35] took the stone that he had fallen asleep
[11:36] on and he raised it up to build a
[11:39] memorial to God
[11:41] the second one and if you guys want to
[11:43] put up that first
[11:45] Slide the second one was when the
[11:48] children of Israel went Joshua excuse me
[11:50] cross the River Jordan God had told them
[11:53] someone from each tribe is to pick up a
[11:55] stone and then we're going to have them
[11:58] stack these Stones as a memorial to what
[12:01] God had done for them and so I imagine
[12:02] it looks something like this now I don't
[12:05] know exactly how big the stones were but
[12:07] I have to imagine it looks something
[12:08] like this and God said this isn't just a
[12:10] memorial for you that when you look at
[12:12] it you remember it and this is something
[12:14] important to remember as we go on it
[12:15] this is also memorial for your children
[12:17] and your children's children because
[12:19] when your children look at this what's
[12:20] the first thing they're going to do what
[12:22] is that what's it for and that's your
[12:24] chance to then explain to them what God
[12:27] has done
[12:28] because this is one thing that we have
[12:29] to remember about our testimonies
[12:33] my testimony or your testimony when you
[12:36] give it may bring Faith to me it may
[12:42] stir up
[12:44] um excitement or wonder for me to search
[12:47] out something for myself and that's what
[12:50] these memorials are for
[12:53] as we grow in Christ
[12:56] you have to realize that
[12:59] Gideon's testimony will only do so much
[13:01] for me
[13:02] at some point I have to have my own
[13:05] testimony
[13:06] because even through everything that the
[13:08] children of Israel saw God do for them
[13:10] even in those cases where they were
[13:13] actually there
[13:14] they would forget
[13:16] so at some point a testimony from a
[13:18] Believer will get me just so far and
[13:21] then I have to have that relationship
[13:22] with Christ amen
[13:25] the third example is in Samuel first
[13:28] Samuel chapter 7 and this is when the
[13:31] Israelites were under attack from the
[13:32] Philistines and God leads them to
[13:34] Victory and so Samuel erects a stone and
[13:36] he names it Ebenezer meaning the stone
[13:38] of help
[13:39] so again this is another example of the
[13:42] children of Israel setting up a
[13:44] permanent Memorial to remember God and
[13:46] what he had done for them
[13:49] and then probably the most
[13:51] well-known or the one that means the
[13:54] most to us would be the act of communion
[13:57] at the Last Supper when Jesus was with
[13:59] the disciples and he was breaking bread
[14:02] and they were drinking the wine he said
[14:04] do this often remembrance of me and we
[14:06] continue to this day to do this what is
[14:08] it it's a memorial for us to remember
[14:11] what God did for us it's it's not just
[14:14] drinking wine and bread and coming
[14:15] together
[14:17] God wants us each one of us individually
[14:21] to remember why it is that we're doing
[14:23] this because it's important to God that
[14:26] we remember because he knows we're human
[14:29] and the minute we forget the minute
[14:31] we're not remembering what he did we're
[14:34] just like the children of Israel and
[14:35] will start to pull away from him amen
[14:43] in 1957 in time tested memorials brother
[14:47] Branham said this
[14:49] not long ago when I heard when I was in
[14:51] Italy I heard of Mussolini in that great
[14:53] statue 40 something feet high that he'd
[14:55] built as a memorial to Athletics as he
[14:57] was an athlete
[14:59] and I wanted to find that Memorial and
[15:01] you know it had been blown into powder
[15:03] by a big Blockbuster I stood about two
[15:05] three years ago on the place where
[15:07] pharaohs of Egypt had raised up great
[15:09] shrines and idols and they tell me that
[15:12] you have to dig 20 feet under the Earth
[15:14] to find even the ground where those
[15:15] memorials stood I've stood where Caesar
[15:17] Augustus where the herods and the greats
[15:19] of Rome and I went on the street where
[15:21] he used to go down the street from the
[15:23] palace since about 25 feet beneath the
[15:25] Earth
[15:26] those memorials are gone but that Living
[15:28] Word of God Still Remains just the same
[15:31] and just as valuable that's a memorial
[15:34] so again the message that we have the
[15:37] word that God has given us that's
[15:39] another Memorial that we have to look
[15:41] back on and remember what God's done for
[15:43] us and the memorial is something it's
[15:46] usually a structure but for a Believer
[15:49] or a Christian it doesn't have to be a
[15:51] physical structure but it's usually a
[15:52] structure and it's something that's
[15:54] established to remind uh people of a
[15:57] person or an event
[15:59] and we we often don't realize that we
[16:02] have these things in our life anyways
[16:03] for instance the cross that hangs back
[16:05] here brother Branham talked about having
[16:07] one hanging from his rearview mirror
[16:09] these are these are monuments these are
[16:11] things that will spark remembrance
[16:13] enough when we look at them the minute a
[16:15] Christian looks at a cross that means a
[16:17] lot more than just two pieces of wood to
[16:19] put together we remember what that means
[16:21] we automatically associate it with the
[16:24] suffering that we caused God Amen
[16:29] and memories of memorials they give us
[16:31] something to set our eyes on they give
[16:34] us something to help us Center ourselves
[16:36] on Christ
[16:38] remember the problem I get in trouble
[16:40] like you always say you do because I'm
[16:41] going to read a quote from a psychology
[16:43] article but it says memory is essential
[16:46] to all our lives without a memory of the
[16:49] past we cannot operate in the present or
[16:53] think about the future
[16:55] and as I read it read that I kind of
[16:58] heard it differently in my head
[17:00] and it's without memories without
[17:02] remembering the past we can't operate
[17:04] God's gifts in the present
[17:06] and if we can't operate his gifts in the
[17:08] present we can't keep our mind on what
[17:11] he's calling us to
[17:12] that's why remembering what God has done
[17:15] is important if we can't remember
[17:17] his promises
[17:19] then how do we operate them in our
[17:21] day-to-day lives and if we can't operate
[17:23] those in our day-to-day lives how do we
[17:25] hope to be to reach what he's calling us
[17:27] to the higher place that he's calling us
[17:30] to amen
[17:33] during times of trial
[17:36] remembering keeps us from being
[17:38] double-minded
[17:41] it keeps us from losing our hope
[17:44] and our sense of direction
[17:46] when we can remember what God has done
[17:48] in our lives personally
[17:51] it helps keep our feet on the straight
[17:53] path it helps keep us pointed in God's
[17:57] Direction this is exactly what happened
[17:59] or the opposite of what happened the
[18:00] children of Israel they forgot who they
[18:02] were they forgot what God had done and
[18:04] they lost their Direction
[18:06] and they wandered in the desert for 40
[18:08] years because of it most of them never
[18:11] saw the promised land all because they
[18:12] had forgotten what God had done for them
[18:15] now
[18:17] stop and just think about that for a
[18:19] minute here's the children of Israel who
[18:21] were in bondage over 400 years they'd
[18:24] waited for a deliverer
[18:26] it finally happens
[18:28] and all that God's asking them to do
[18:31] is remember
[18:32] don't forget
[18:33] remember that I promised I'd deliver you
[18:35] and I did it so if I promised you that
[18:38] and I did it then every other promise
[18:40] I've given you I will do
[18:42] that's all they had to do
[18:43] all they had to do was remember what God
[18:46] had done
[18:48] foreign
[18:49] so simple so simple and yet they turn
[18:52] from God
[18:53] and it's easy for us to look back and
[18:55] think
[18:56] well that's that's silly
[18:59] God wasn't asking much of them
[19:01] guess what
[19:03] God's not asking any more of us
[19:05] he's saying just remember
[19:07] when you're sick remember that I said
[19:10] you're healed
[19:12] when you're struggling remember that I
[19:13] said I'd be there that's all he's asking
[19:15] us to do because if we can do that
[19:18] God Will Supply the rest amen
[19:21] and again the act of remembering is
[19:23] important to God he wants us to live our
[19:26] lives in remembrance
[19:28] our past present and future in God
[19:32] is linked by our memory
[19:35] now why why is that why is remembering
[19:38] important
[19:39] in Psalm 77 we get an example the author
[19:43] Begins the chapter by describing his
[19:45] despair
[19:46] he says I am so troubled that I cannot
[19:49] speak
[19:50] he continues by saying will the Lord
[19:52] casts off forever and will he be
[19:54] favorable no more is his Mercy clean
[19:57] Gone Forever does his promise fail
[20:00] forevermore hath God forgotten to be
[20:03] gracious hathy and anger shut up his
[20:05] Tender Mercies
[20:07] now how often when we're going through
[20:09] trials does that sound like us
[20:14] if no one else would raise their hand
[20:15] I'll raise two because it sounds like me
[20:17] quite often
[20:19] and I often like to say to people in our
[20:22] humanness
[20:24] there's nothing wrong with being there
[20:28] God understands that we will go through
[20:31] times like this
[20:33] the problem is is when we stay there
[20:37] that's the problem God God came to Earth
[20:40] in Jesus so that he could
[20:42] experience what we experience he knows
[20:45] that this is going to happen to us
[20:47] but he also knows that we can overcome
[20:49] just the way he did he wants us to move
[20:51] on from that and so if you keep on in
[20:54] Psalm 77 the author doesn't stop here he
[20:57] continues
[20:58] and then as he continues in the
[21:00] scripture he begins to remember and
[21:02] meditate on the things that God's done
[21:04] he says this he said I will remember the
[21:07] years of the right hand of the most high
[21:09] I will remember the works of the Lord
[21:12] surely I will remember thy wonders of
[21:15] old I will meditate also of all of thy
[21:18] Work and talk of thy doing
[21:21] remembering is an action
[21:23] it's not something that just happens
[21:26] it's something we have to do we have to
[21:29] do consciously think about what God has
[21:33] done and is doing we have to wake up
[21:36] every morning and say
[21:38] you know what yesterday may not have
[21:40] been the best day but God blessed me in
[21:42] this way this way in this way because
[21:44] I'm telling you
[21:45] I've been serving the lord a long time
[21:47] and some of you a lot longer than me
[21:48] there's never been a day that goes by no
[21:51] matter how bad the day has been that you
[21:53] can't find at least once that God has
[21:55] blessed you
[21:57] and so if we just as the author in the
[22:00] scriptures is done start talking about
[22:02] those things even internally to
[22:03] ourselves start dwelling on them no
[22:05] matter how small we think they are the
[22:07] things that God has done for us
[22:09] something happens and what happens when
[22:12] this author starts remembering and
[22:13] meditating on these things he begins to
[22:15] turn his despair into praise
[22:19] this is exactly what the children of
[22:20] Israel could have done he threw
[22:22] everything they went through if they had
[22:23] said okay you know what we're thirsty
[22:25] we're hungry but
[22:27] God brought us out of Egypt God parted
[22:30] the Seas is going to find a way to feed
[22:32] us he's going to find a way to bring us
[22:33] water if that's what they had done their
[22:36] despair would have turned to praise amen
[22:41] and this is what the author continues to
[22:43] say he is he says who is so great a God
[22:46] is our God Thou Art the god that do us
[22:48] wonders thou has declared thy strengths
[22:50] among the people thou Hast With Thine
[22:52] arm redeem thy people the sons of Jacob
[22:55] and Joseph say law the waters saw thee
[22:58] oh God the water saw thee they were
[23:00] afraid the depths were also troubled
[23:03] the clouds poured out water the sky sent
[23:05] out a sound Thon arrows also went abroad
[23:08] the voice of thy Thunders was in the
[23:11] heaven the Lightnings lightened the
[23:12] world the Earth trembled and shook the
[23:15] way is in the sea and thy path in the
[23:17] Great Waters and thy footsteps are not
[23:19] known
[23:20] thou lettest thy people in a flock by
[23:23] the hand of Moses and Aaron so this
[23:25] author is talking about the same thing
[23:27] that the children of Israel went through
[23:29] but he doesn't talk about them being
[23:30] hungry
[23:31] he doesn't talk about them being thirsty
[23:33] he doesn't talk about them
[23:36] complaining he talks about everything
[23:38] that God had done it's the same story
[23:42] but seen from a completely different
[23:44] perspective and this author instead of
[23:46] being in despair like the children of
[23:48] Israel were and who the children of
[23:50] Israel who missed out on their promise
[23:52] this this author is stepping into the
[23:54] promise that God had given him he's
[23:56] praising the Lord for all the things
[23:58] that he had done because he wasn't
[23:59] looking at the circumstances but he was
[24:02] remembering God's promises amen
[24:05] and I won't read the scriptures tonight
[24:07] but if you guys want to go back and read
[24:08] it read psalms 106 because it it lets
[24:11] you know what happens when we as
[24:13] Believers forget what God has done
[24:16] and just three things that I grabbed out
[24:18] from that scripture is it leads to
[24:20] unbelief and eventually to Rebellion
[24:23] when we don't remember what it is that
[24:25] God's done
[24:26] eventually the devil will get in there
[24:28] and start to twist what it is we believe
[24:30] and start whispering things in our ear
[24:33] to eventually we don't even believe what
[24:35] we used to believe
[24:36] and then if we continue to let that
[24:38] happen it then becomes a rebellion
[24:41] and hopefully I don't get myself in
[24:42] trouble for saying this brother Paul but
[24:44] I often say for all of my friends that
[24:47] no longer are sitting here because
[24:48] they've left this is what happened
[24:51] this is just my opinion
[24:53] they forgot what everything that God had
[24:55] done for them they started to look at
[24:57] the things they didn't understand the
[24:58] things that didn't make sense a minister
[25:00] who had hurt them a friend who betrayed
[25:03] them
[25:04] and it became unbelief and they kept
[25:06] letting that be fed and let be fed until
[25:08] it just turned into Rebellion
[25:10] now as brother Paul always says I always
[25:12] like to caveat this I'm not writing
[25:14] anyone off I believe most if not all of
[25:16] them will come back someday
[25:19] but this is the problem they forgot what
[25:21] God had done for them
[25:24] the second thing that happens when we
[25:25] forget what God's done is it makes us do
[25:27] foolish things
[25:29] we tend to do things we probably never
[25:31] would have done when we keep our mind on
[25:33] God and what he's doing when we're
[25:35] remembering what the works that God has
[25:37] done we tend to look for
[25:40] are what our purpose is what are the
[25:42] things that God is calling us to do
[25:45] um as brother Boaz was also teaching in
[25:47] Sunday school so often we leave our
[25:49] purpose undone and why
[25:52] because we forgot what it is that God is
[25:54] doing for us what he has done for us and
[25:56] what and then in turn what he's calling
[25:59] us to do
[26:02] and the last thing and probably
[26:06] the scariest thing in my opinion
[26:09] is not remembering
[26:11] causes us to anger God
[26:14] and how many times did it happen with
[26:16] the children of Israel at one point
[26:18] Moses had to throw himself in front of
[26:20] God and the children and say God don't
[26:22] do it
[26:23] because it's so angered God that they
[26:25] couldn't remember everything that they
[26:27] had done
[26:30] and sometimes I often wonder why we
[26:32] don't have a greater understanding of
[26:34] how this affects God because how does it
[26:36] affect us when we do something for
[26:38] someone
[26:39] and they forget or they don't
[26:41] acknowledge it or they don't make it
[26:43] seem like it was as big a deal as we
[26:44] thought it was we get hurt we get sad
[26:47] sometimes we get angry sometimes we quit
[26:49] being friends with them
[26:50] probably shouldn't do that but it
[26:52] happens
[26:53] if if that's how it makes us feel how
[26:56] much more would it make God
[26:59] who literally gave his son to shed his
[27:03] blood for our sins none of us no matter
[27:06] how great something is you've done none
[27:08] of us have gone to this level for anyone
[27:10] else
[27:11] so we have to understand how this makes
[27:13] God feel and it's important to God that
[27:16] we remember
[27:19] we're going to get a little technical
[27:21] here a little bit so let's try not to
[27:23] fall asleep I'll try to whoops
[27:25] keep it interesting
[27:28] when it comes to memory we have three
[27:31] types of memory we have sensory memory
[27:33] and this memory allows us to remember
[27:37] sensory information so when we come into
[27:41] a room the sights The Sounds the smells
[27:44] things that we feel this is your sensory
[27:46] memory that's what allows you to
[27:47] remember those
[27:49] the second is your short-term memory
[27:51] now your short-term memory rely allows
[27:54] you to recall specific information for a
[27:56] very short period of time
[27:58] um the human brain can only store your
[28:00] short-term memories depending on what
[28:03] article you read anywhere from 15 to 30
[28:05] seconds
[28:06] and the average person can only retain
[28:09] about five five to nine items in the
[28:12] short-term memory at one time and and
[28:13] that kind of varies depending on the
[28:15] person
[28:16] and the last type of memory is your
[28:18] long-term memory now this is any memory
[28:21] that you can recall after 30 seconds
[28:24] and long-term your long-term memory can
[28:26] last from days to decades and there's
[28:29] one important thing that I want to point
[28:31] out because we're going to talk a lot
[28:32] about your long-term memory is
[28:34] even though theoretically your long-term
[28:36] memory is infinite
[28:39] long-term memories can be lost
[28:42] the only way to keep them to really keep
[28:45] them is to constantly think about them
[28:47] to bring them up to remember them to
[28:50] recite them to share them when you do
[28:53] that it keeps you from losing those
[28:54] long-term memories so even though we
[28:56] like to think once it's a long-term
[28:58] memory it's safe it's not
[29:02] foreign
[29:03] again after you reach 40 that becomes
[29:05] even more true
[29:07] now when you get into kind of the
[29:09] long-term memory there's five stages
[29:11] that a memory has to go through before
[29:14] it becomes semi-permanent
[29:16] first you have the sensing and it
[29:19] involves being exposed to scenes or
[29:21] situations so when you're in you know
[29:23] you walk into the church building all of
[29:25] a sudden your brain is starting to sense
[29:28] different things that we talked about
[29:29] the smells the sights The Sounds the
[29:31] things you touch
[29:33] and so that starts in your your sensing
[29:35] and then your brain starts to encode
[29:37] what it's saying it's feeling and
[29:39] receiving and the the volume and
[29:42] complexity of what your brain uh or is
[29:46] what is passed to your brain through
[29:47] this sense your sensory
[29:49] um
[29:50] sorry your senses
[29:52] it's too great for your brain to process
[29:55] all at one time
[29:56] and so what happens is your brain starts
[29:59] to choose things to focus on and to
[30:02] remember
[30:03] um and a lot of times it's the unusual
[30:05] things that our brain will remember
[30:07] um so when you walk into this room as
[30:09] big as it is and we're all in here it
[30:11] would be hard to remember every item of
[30:13] clothing everyone's wearing what
[30:16] everyone's hair looks it's just too much
[30:17] information so your brain has to pick
[30:19] things
[30:20] um that it wants to remember
[30:22] um sorry Kenny I'm going to pick on you
[30:24] but if Kenny walked up here and started
[30:27] playing the piano in a rhinestone coat
[30:29] I guarantee you all would remember that
[30:32] why because it's unusual it's a little
[30:35] strange a little out of the ordinary so
[30:37] that's something you would remember but
[30:39] you may not remember you know what
[30:41] brother Brandon is wearing sitting down
[30:42] here in the second row
[30:44] your brain has to pick and choose what
[30:46] it's going to remember
[30:47] once it starts to encode the information
[30:50] that it's see it's seeing in order to
[30:54] really root those memories it starts to
[30:57] consolidate what's essential and it
[31:00] starts to
[31:01] to encode and and um put together into a
[31:06] stable long-term memory everything that
[31:07] it's sensing
[31:09] that process uh strengthens the signals
[31:12] between the neurons in your brain
[31:15] and you need that in order to recall the
[31:17] memory later
[31:19] once you get past the consolidation part
[31:22] you get into storage
[31:23] so this is where
[31:25] um the brain has to store it so it's
[31:27] easily accessible to you later when you
[31:29] want to recall the memory
[31:31] um
[31:32] the full memory however isn't stored
[31:35] your brain stores traces of the memory
[31:39] so again walk into this room you might
[31:41] see smell hear everything
[31:45] but even after the brain has kind of
[31:47] picked and chose what it wants to
[31:49] remember even in that it only stores
[31:52] traces of it so that when you recall
[31:55] that memory your brain kind of puts it
[31:57] all together to remember the full memory
[32:00] the last piece is retrieval
[32:03] so thousands of events can be stored as
[32:06] memory traces
[32:07] but they're useless if you can't
[32:09] retrieve them so this is kind of the
[32:11] important part While most memories will
[32:13] never be used
[32:14] some memories can be brought forward
[32:16] through retrieval cues so when you hear
[32:19] a song and that song reminds you of
[32:21] something when you smell something and
[32:23] that smell reminds you of a memory
[32:25] that's kind of what's going on in your
[32:27] mind
[32:30] and so
[32:32] once the memory Trace is activated so
[32:35] once something activates those traces to
[32:38] kind of bring that memory back
[32:40] the more that happens the more likely it
[32:43] is that it'll be reactivated in the
[32:45] future
[32:46] so again when God has done something for
[32:49] us if we constantly are talking about
[32:51] that we're sharing our testimony we're
[32:53] sharing the blessings that God has
[32:55] brought to us the more we do that the
[32:57] more likely
[32:58] when we need that memory that we'll be
[33:01] able to bring it back up
[33:03] so again I'm just laying a foundation of
[33:05] why it's so important
[33:08] as I said before creating memories
[33:13] is an active process especially if you
[33:16] want those memories to become long-term
[33:19] you you have to to
[33:22] consciously say to yourself this is
[33:24] something that I want to remember
[33:26] so that it will become a long-term
[33:27] memory otherwise you risk it being a
[33:29] short-term memory you walk out of the
[33:31] room and you don't remember
[33:33] in Deuteronomy 4 and 23 the scripture
[33:36] says take heed unto yourself and this
[33:39] means be on your guard and watch
[33:41] yourself
[33:42] lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord
[33:44] your God which he made with you and make
[33:47] you a Graven image of the likeness of
[33:49] anything which the Lord thy God hath
[33:51] forbidden thee so again scripture is
[33:54] telling us be careful not to forget
[33:56] watch yourself he God is reminding us of
[34:01] something that we need to do again this
[34:03] active process of remembering but
[34:06] because sorry I'm stumbling over my
[34:08] words but I have to imagine that the
[34:10] children of Israel
[34:12] didn't set out to forget what God had
[34:14] done for them
[34:16] but on the same token they didn't set
[34:18] out to remember either and that's where
[34:20] the problem happened and so as
[34:22] Christians we're we don't wake up in the
[34:24] morning and think
[34:25] I don't want to remember anything that
[34:27] God did yesterday
[34:29] but because we're not doing the opposite
[34:30] which is to remember what he's done that
[34:33] is essentially what we're doing
[34:36] so again that memory consolidation is
[34:38] the process where our brain converts
[34:40] short-term memories into long-term
[34:43] memories
[34:44] in short-term memories again uh tend to
[34:46] be quite Limited in terms of how long
[34:49] they last
[34:50] and so that memory consolidation works
[34:53] by rehearsing or recalling the
[34:55] information over and over and over again
[34:57] so these neural networks become
[35:00] strengthened so for example if you're
[35:02] studying material regularly over a long
[35:04] period of time those Pathways involved
[35:06] in remembering that information will
[35:08] start to be strengthened and you're more
[35:09] likely to remember that in the future
[35:14] another example is you know we have
[35:16] paths out here in the woods and if you
[35:18] were to go out there every day and walk
[35:20] those paths the more often you walk them
[35:23] the more familiar you become and the
[35:26] easier it is to walk that path again
[35:28] just like our Christian walk the more
[35:31] that we're walking with Christ the more
[35:33] that we're dwelling on what it is that
[35:35] he has for us the more that we're
[35:36] remembering His blessings the easier
[35:38] this life becomes
[35:40] the children of Israel if they had just
[35:43] remembered what God had done for them
[35:45] what he had promised think how much
[35:47] easier going sorry
[35:49] going through the desert would have been
[35:52] how much easier it would have it had
[35:54] been when the spies came back and told
[35:55] them all that they had saw for them to
[35:57] say
[35:59] didn't sound that hard
[36:01] if God can do all that he's done this is
[36:03] this is nothing
[36:04] just think that they would have stepped
[36:07] into the promise that they had waited
[36:08] over 400 years for it
[36:10] and instead
[36:12] they were left in the desert
[36:16] I want to go back a little bit again and
[36:19] talk about the three types of memory so
[36:21] again the sensory memory is that sight
[36:24] touch sound and smell and as I was
[36:27] reading up on these types of memories it
[36:29] got me to thinking that your sensory
[36:31] memory is a lot like your flesh
[36:34] we come into church as Believers and we
[36:36] see things we see shouting we see
[36:38] praying we see the Lord touching people
[36:40] we hear things we hear sermons we feel
[36:44] things God you know emotions are great
[36:47] I'm not knocking emotions but it's got
[36:49] to be more than that and we see that
[36:51] that's our sensory memory that's our
[36:53] flesh and too often as Christians that's
[36:56] where we stop
[36:58] we feel something we're like this is
[37:00] great
[37:01] but what happens is the moment that
[37:03] feeling subsides
[37:05] you don't remember it
[37:08] you don't remember what it is that God
[37:10] did
[37:11] we have to get past the sensory memory
[37:14] so then you get into your short-term
[37:17] memory now this is what I like to to
[37:20] um
[37:21] to say is and we'll get into where I
[37:23] kind of came up with some of this in a
[37:25] minute but your short-term memory is
[37:27] your soul this is the believer who goes
[37:29] to a camp or a special service and God
[37:32] does something for them and they truly
[37:34] are touched they're truly God is truly
[37:36] doing a work in them
[37:38] they're genuine about what's happened
[37:40] but they leave and they go home life
[37:44] gets in the way
[37:46] trials start happening Temptations come
[37:49] and they start to grow cold
[37:51] and they find themselves in the same
[37:53] circumstances of the children of Israel
[37:55] they've forgotten what it is that God's
[37:57] done I'm going to quit doing that in a
[38:00] minute
[38:01] they forget what God has done for them
[38:04] it's a short-term memory God had done
[38:07] something for them but they didn't dwell
[38:09] on it meditate on it search out the
[38:12] scriptures get into their prayer closet
[38:14] and talk with the Lord build that
[38:15] relationship enough that it became
[38:17] long-term
[38:19] now your long-term memory
[38:21] I see is our spirit
[38:24] this is the place
[38:26] that if we can
[38:28] build those memories of what God's done
[38:30] for us
[38:32] that when life's circumstances come
[38:36] when the world starts closing in around
[38:38] us when we start to feel our weakest
[38:41] when we're beaten down to our lowest
[38:47] something in that long-term memory in
[38:50] our spirit
[38:51] cries out I remember
[38:54] I remember that he said by his stripes
[38:57] I'm Healed
[39:00] I remember that he said ask and I shall
[39:03] receive
[39:04] I remember that he said he will never
[39:07] leave me
[39:09] I remember that he said the righteous
[39:11] will not be forsaken
[39:13] that his children will not be seen
[39:14] begging for bread
[39:17] I remember that scripture says knock and
[39:20] it shall be opened unto you
[39:22] I remember that he said that if I
[39:25] believe I will have eternal life
[39:28] this is where we have to get to
[39:31] that long-term memory again we don't sit
[39:34] around and
[39:35] and have to
[39:37] and I want to be careful that I don't
[39:39] kind of walk over what I've already said
[39:40] but we have to make a conscious decision
[39:42] to make something a long-term memory but
[39:45] once that long-term memory is there we
[39:46] don't have to think about it every day
[39:48] we have to you know constantly bring it
[39:50] up and remember it to make sure it stays
[39:52] there but we don't have to think about
[39:53] it every day but we have to think about
[39:56] it enough
[39:58] then when something happens in our life
[40:00] that we need that that we need to
[40:03] remember what God's done for us we don't
[40:05] have to make the conscious decision to
[40:06] think about it something Wells up within
[40:08] us that we don't know where it's coming
[40:10] from to say I remember
[40:12] amen
[40:14] so why why is it so important for us to
[40:17] remember why do I and why did God harp
[40:20] on it so much that we need to remember
[40:22] it's because remembering brings praise
[40:25] into our lives
[40:27] remembering brings stability it brings
[40:30] peace it brings comfort
[40:33] I know many of you can uh can attest to
[40:36] this but I point to brother Paul because
[40:38] him and I you know both lost our fathers
[40:40] about the same time what brings us
[40:42] comfort
[40:44] one we know we'll see him again but the
[40:46] other is the memories
[40:47] we can talk about our fathers we can
[40:49] talk about the things that they they
[40:51] taught us we can share with people those
[40:53] memories keep them alive to us they
[40:56] bring us hope they bring us peace it's
[40:59] the same thing with Christ
[41:01] so often we wonder Where's God in our
[41:04] circumstances
[41:05] he's probably just waiting for you to
[41:07] talk about him
[41:09] he's probably just waiting for you to
[41:11] say something to to remember how much it
[41:14] is that he's done for you amen
[41:16] there's so much power in Remembering
[41:18] God's goodness truly remembering it
[41:21] making it a part of who you are a part
[41:24] of your spirit
[41:25] on the other hand there's so much danger
[41:27] in forgetting
[41:29] every time the children of Israel forgot
[41:33] the Lord and what they had he had done
[41:35] for them it led them into captivity
[41:37] idolatry and oppression
[41:41] the very thing that they complained
[41:45] about was what they ended up in all
[41:48] because they couldn't remember
[41:52] and finally go back to the slide I keep
[41:55] I think we're on the wrong way
[41:56] sorry can you bring that back up Genie
[42:01] that's the one I wanted thank you
[42:04] I know I've probably told this story
[42:06] before
[42:07] but I love this story and it fits so
[42:10] well it just kind of came to my mind as
[42:12] I was studying
[42:13] but this is a picture of Horatio
[42:17] spafford I believe is how you pronounce
[42:19] his last name and he's the gentleman who
[42:21] wrote the song it is well
[42:24] and I've mentioned this before but for
[42:26] those of you who don't know the story of
[42:28] this gentleman in this song
[42:30] um Horatio was actually a very
[42:31] successful attorney and real estate
[42:33] agent
[42:35] um he but he lost his fortune in the
[42:38] Chicago Fire in 1871. about the same
[42:40] time that he lost his fortune his
[42:43] four-year-old son died of scarlet fever
[42:45] his family had been going through so
[42:47] much he decided they should take a trip
[42:49] but he had some business he sent his
[42:52] wife and his four daughters on a ship to
[42:54] England ahead of him
[42:56] halfway through their trip
[42:57] there was an accident and the ship sank
[43:00] and when Horatio's wife was the only one
[43:03] survived there's over 200 people that
[43:04] perished all four of his daughters died
[43:07] his wife made it back to England and she
[43:09] sent him a telegram and the only thing
[43:11] that it said
[43:13] I have this right it said saved alone
[43:15] what shall I do
[43:17] so here's a man that lost everything he
[43:19] had lost his son was trying to find some
[43:23] comfort with his family ended up losing
[43:25] the rest of his children
[43:28] as a parent I can't imagine anything
[43:30] worse
[43:31] could you imagine how he must be feeling
[43:34] could you imagine his flesh
[43:37] the last thing he probably wanted to
[43:39] talk about and think about
[43:41] was the blessings that God had given him
[43:44] it's probably the last thing that he
[43:46] wanted to do
[43:47] so when his wife sent him the telegram
[43:48] he immediately boarded a ship for
[43:51] England to be with her
[43:53] when the ship that he was on reached the
[43:55] point where the ship that his family had
[43:57] perished on had went down the captain
[43:59] called him out on deck and pointed it
[44:02] out to him
[44:03] and as he stood there
[44:06] and he looked at the location the place
[44:09] that was the last spot his four
[44:11] daughters were on in this Earth where he
[44:14] never got to say goodbye whereas a
[44:16] father I'm sure he felt his heart had
[44:17] been ripped out in that spot
[44:19] the words the song It is Well came to
[44:22] him
[44:26] the grace and mercy of God what God had
[44:29] done for him they weren't a sensory
[44:31] memory for him it wasn't a Feeling
[44:34] it wasn't something that he felt but
[44:36] then quickly forgot
[44:38] it wasn't a short-term memory that
[44:40] comfort him as long as he was successful
[44:43] it had become a long-term memory so
[44:46] ingrained in his spirit
[44:49] so anchored deep down
[44:52] in his love for God that even at the
[44:54] greatest tragedy that could befall any
[44:56] parent
[44:58] his Spirit cried out I remember
[45:01] my lot
[45:04] thou has taught me to say
[45:06] It Is Well with My Soul
[45:09] this is where God wants us to be
[45:12] he wants us
[45:14] if anyone had a reason to look at their
[45:17] circumstances it was this man
[45:21] and I
[45:22] some may not appreciate this but if
[45:25] anyone had a right to be angry with God
[45:28] it was this man
[45:29] he had lost everything
[45:32] time and time and time again
[45:36] and imagine what was going through his
[45:38] head as he stood there
[45:40] on the deck of that ship
[45:44] and as I was studying I was thinking
[45:45] about that I thought God I don't know
[45:48] that these words would have been what
[45:49] came to me
[45:51] but I want to be that
[45:54] I want to be the kind of person that no
[45:56] matter what happens I can say God has
[45:59] brought me through enough
[46:01] that I know he'll bring me through this
[46:02] it doesn't matter it does not matter
[46:05] what the enemy does because God will
[46:08] bring me through it amen
[46:10] church we have to remember what God has
[46:12] done for us
[46:14] we have to meditate on it daily it can't
[46:17] be something that we just on Sundays and
[46:19] Wednesdays we come here and let brother
[46:20] Paul meditate on it and tell us I love
[46:22] brother Paul and the rest of the
[46:24] ministers I love what they do and I
[46:25] appreciate what they do
[46:27] but my relationship with Christ has
[46:30] nothing to do with them
[46:32] if something was to happen to them
[46:34] whether it be that God take them from
[46:35] this Earth whatever it be
[46:37] that can't stop me from serving the lord
[46:41] we're all humans I'm sure I've
[46:43] disappointed them
[46:45] not yet but you might at some point
[46:46] disappoint me I don't know
[46:48] hopefully not but maybe but I have to be
[46:51] I have to be okay with that to say that
[46:53] doesn't matter
[46:56] the Christ that speaks to them through
[46:58] me that's what's important not in the
[47:01] humanness what we do because we are
[47:03] human we're going to make mistakes amen
[47:08] and to to remember what Christ has done
[47:10] to us to sing his Praises is it's not
[47:13] just important when things are going
[47:15] well
[47:16] it's most important when things are
[47:19] going horribly
[47:20] when your life is falling apart like
[47:22] Horatio when you've lost everything and
[47:25] you probably want to curl up and say God
[47:27] take me now
[47:29] that's when you need to remember that's
[47:31] when you need to praise that's when you
[47:33] need to thank the Lord for His blessings
[47:36] amen
[47:39] and again we have to count our blessings
[47:41] and it's not just for us
[47:43] it's for our children
[47:45] it's for our children's children when
[47:48] I have two two sons now when something
[47:51] goes wrong in our lives
[47:53] they're watching how I react to that
[47:56] and I'm going to be honest like brother
[47:57] Dix was on Sunday I don't always react
[48:00] no 90 of the time I don't react the
[48:02] right way I'm trying to get better
[48:05] but that's why this is important because
[48:08] if we're dwelling on the things of God
[48:10] when these things happen we will react
[48:13] better
[48:14] because it's it's not even our flesh
[48:16] that's reacting it's something so deep
[48:19] down that we don't even understand why
[48:21] we're doing what we're doing amen
[48:25] I can
[48:28] this is kind of a long quote but I want
[48:30] to kind of uh remind you because I know
[48:32] we all know this where I got
[48:35] um the point I was making about the
[48:37] sensory memory being the flesh the
[48:39] short-term memory being our soul and the
[48:41] long-term memory being our spirit so
[48:43] brother Branham is talking about kind of
[48:45] the gateways of what controls
[48:48] us our spirit our soul he says now
[48:50] there's one way to get into the body
[48:52] how's this body controlled now watch
[48:54] real close now and get your pencils
[48:56] ready
[48:57] here's the gate on this side that goes
[48:58] into the body one two three four five
[49:00] now you got that drawn now the first
[49:03] gate is see smell hear taste and touch
[49:06] or feel the sensors
[49:08] it's your sensory memory
[49:12] now that's the senses in the body is
[49:14] that right how many knows that six
[49:15] senses control the body now we got a
[49:18] soul after you get through this
[49:19] the senses is outside that's the outer
[49:22] system now in here there's one two three
[49:24] four five five attributes in the soul
[49:26] now you run and write them down the
[49:28] first one is Imagination the second one
[49:31] is conscience and the third one is
[49:33] memory and the fourth one is reason and
[49:35] the fifth one is affection
[49:37] now did you get them all if you don't
[49:39] then let me know you got them all down
[49:41] see taste feel smell and hear the body
[49:43] that's the opening to the body
[49:46] the soul is Imagination conscience
[49:48] memory reason and affection is the
[49:50] senses or the attributes like the senses
[49:52] of the Soul
[49:54] sorry if I went
[49:58] uh
[49:59] sorry I had to split this into two
[50:00] because it's kind of long and the soul
[50:01] is the nature of the spirit that's on
[50:03] the inside because the soul only puts
[50:04] out an atmosphere of what's on the
[50:07] inside of you it takes the place of
[50:09] sanctification the soul sits in the same
[50:11] category there now everybody got that
[50:13] all down now to this gate there's only
[50:15] one gate so the gate to your spirit
[50:18] that's called self-will you're the boss
[50:21] of what goes on in here
[50:24] filled with the Holy Spirit here and
[50:26] this becomes God's judgment seat where
[50:28] God sits in your heart and if you do
[50:30] something wrong say oh my I did wrong
[50:33] some people say I don't it don't condemn
[50:36] me to wear short hair it don't condemn
[50:38] me to wear manicure or makeup it don't
[50:39] condemn me to go to dances it don't
[50:41] condemn me to tell a little white lie it
[50:43] doesn't condemn me to do to play bridge
[50:45] at my bridge party you know it ain't got
[50:47] nothing to condemn they don't hurt my
[50:49] conscience you got no
[50:51] I love his little sayings you got no
[50:53] more conscience than a snake has hips
[50:55] you ain't got no conscience there ain't
[50:57] nothing there to hurt you you're of the
[50:59] world but I challenge you to let Jesus
[51:02] Christ come in here and try to do it one
[51:04] time brother you'd be soaking them
[51:06] you'll back off and shake your head from
[51:07] that thing just as certain as I'm
[51:09] standing here because he's holy listen
[51:11] I'm quoting the scripture if you love
[51:13] them things that's the world things of
[51:15] the world it's because of the love of
[51:17] God is not even in you so again brother
[51:20] Branham tells us the gates to the body
[51:22] are the senses see smell taste touch and
[51:24] feel that's your sensory memory it
[51:27] allows us to remember things that we
[51:29] sense
[51:31] and as I was talking is when God deals
[51:34] with us sometimes we feel things
[51:36] sometimes we feel emotions there's
[51:38] nothing wrong with that
[51:40] but it's got to go deeper it's got to go
[51:42] deeper than the body it's got to go
[51:44] deeper than the flesh so then the gates
[51:46] to the soul or your imagination
[51:47] conscience memory reason and affection
[51:49] this is your short-term memory this is
[51:52] where you can reason
[51:53] and decide
[51:55] if this is a memory that you want to
[51:57] make permanent to make a long-term
[51:59] memory
[52:02] now when you get to the spirit you have
[52:04] self-will this is your long-term memory
[52:06] again it takes a conscious action to
[52:10] continually dwell and meditate on what
[52:12] God's done to turn that into a long-term
[52:15] memory that's your self-willed that's
[52:17] your spirit amen
[52:19] you make the decision to consolidate
[52:22] memories into something more
[52:23] we anchor the things of Lord deep in our
[52:26] spirit and that's a decision that we
[52:29] make God's not going to force things on
[52:31] us
[52:31] so this is where I kind of Drew those
[52:33] parallels between what brother Brandon
[52:34] was saying the body the soul and the
[52:37] spirit and those three types of memory
[52:40] um I want to kind of share a testimony
[52:43] have only shared it with a couple of
[52:44] people here in the congregation but that
[52:47] kind of started me on this path of
[52:49] thinking about this
[52:51] and so about a year and a half and a
[52:52] year year and a half ago in June of 2021
[52:56] I had been working from home for a year
[52:59] due to covid and we got called back into
[53:01] the office so so it was our first day
[53:03] back
[53:04] and I had been in the office probably 20
[53:06] minutes
[53:09] and I sat down at my desk
[53:11] and I got an email
[53:13] from the HR department
[53:15] I got one and the other leaders in my
[53:17] department all got one and so didn't
[53:19] tell us what it was about just said we'd
[53:21] set up meetings
[53:23] um within the first two minutes of that
[53:25] meeting we were told they were letting
[53:26] go of the entire leadership team
[53:28] and we had five minutes we weren't even
[53:30] allowed to pack up our desk to grab what
[53:32] we could grab and that we were everyone
[53:35] was being escorted off campus
[53:38] I'm going to be honest with you again
[53:39] like brother Diggs I didn't have the
[53:42] best attitude I was angry I was upset I
[53:45] felt despair this was two weeks before
[53:48] Betsy gave birth to Casper
[53:50] I was worried about what am I going to
[53:52] do for insurance how I'm going to pay
[53:54] for the next year we all know how many
[53:57] times you have to go to the doctor the
[53:58] first year of a child's life
[54:00] I was upset that there had been no
[54:02] warning there had been the you know no
[54:05] one had said hey you're not fulfilling
[54:07] your job requirements it was just we've
[54:09] decided to change how we do things you
[54:11] all have five minutes it's been nice
[54:13] knowing you I've been there eight years
[54:16] and so I remember I was really upset
[54:19] um again being very honest I was so
[54:21] upset that the VP of the department had
[54:22] asked me please don't tell anyone this
[54:24] is happening we want to let them know
[54:27] ourselves
[54:28] so I immediately opened my office door
[54:30] and told the entire department honestly
[54:33] I was that upset
[54:38] I'm going to be honest I didn't react
[54:39] very well
[54:41] um I was stressed I was trying to figure
[54:43] out how am I going to go home and tell
[54:44] my wife
[54:46] you're having a baby in two weeks we
[54:48] have no income only a couple of months
[54:51] worth of insurance
[54:52] you know how does that make you feel
[54:55] so I remember Drive riding my car and I
[54:57] was just upset and I was thinking about
[54:58] all the horrible things that could
[54:59] happen and why me and why did I put so
[55:02] much of my time and effort in this job
[55:03] who they apparently didn't care enough
[55:04] about me to give me more warning than
[55:07] just five minutes
[55:08] and I remember as I was doing this and
[55:10] again this was nothing that I did
[55:12] this was all God
[55:14] I remember I was doing this and I was
[55:16] just being negative and I was worrying
[55:18] and I I really didn't want to go home I
[55:20] was trying to figure out where can I go
[55:21] so I don't have to go home and tell my
[55:23] wife right now what can I do to kind of
[55:25] buy me some time
[55:26] and all of a sudden
[55:28] the negative thoughts stopped
[55:30] and something inside
[55:33] said nope
[55:35] and I remember I said this in my head
[55:37] and I remember it happening I said God
[55:40] you told me
[55:41] when I couldn't do it you could
[55:44] I can't I'm done I'm not worrying about
[55:47] it I'm not talking about it I'm not
[55:50] trying I'm not going to try nothing I'm
[55:52] going to go home I'm going to tell my
[55:53] wife what happened I'm gonna tell her
[55:54] everything's gonna be okay and we'll
[55:56] wake up tomorrow and see what happens
[55:58] now if you know me this is not my
[56:00] typical response it's why I say this
[56:02] wasn't me there was something in me that
[56:04] remembered
[56:06] something that I heard time and time
[56:08] again that when we need him the most
[56:10] when when we can't carry that burden he
[56:14] would be there for us
[56:16] now I will tell you
[56:18] that for most of my life my dream
[56:21] has been to work for myself
[56:23] has been to start my own business but I
[56:26] never took the leap because I got
[56:28] married I had kids and I couldn't
[56:30] justify doing it because anyone who runs
[56:32] their own business knows it's not easy
[56:36] I went home that day and I told my wife
[56:39] she was a little freaked out that I was
[56:41] so calm and positive about it because
[56:44] again not my natural reaction
[56:46] but I remember her looking at me and
[56:48] saying it'll be all right we'll figure
[56:50] it out and I will tell you
[56:53] all it took for me is the Lord laid on
[56:55] my heart to send out a quick message
[56:58] to all of my colleagues that I'd worked
[57:00] with over the years I'm no longer at my
[57:02] job
[57:04] I'm open to work
[57:06] in the last year and a half
[57:08] God not me
[57:10] built my business I've not gone after
[57:12] one client every single client I have
[57:15] Has Come to Me by Word of Mouth every
[57:18] time one project finishes
[57:20] I'll turn my wife and I say I don't know
[57:22] where the money is going to come from
[57:25] but God will figure it out
[57:27] I literally get a call within a day are
[57:29] you open to another project
[57:34] and again I don't say that
[57:37] for myself because I didn't do it trust
[57:40] me again if you know me this was not me
[57:43] but God showed me that if I would just
[57:46] remember his promises and place that on
[57:49] hit on him place that in his hands he
[57:51] would take care of it and I will tell
[57:53] you every single time we got to a place
[57:56] where
[57:57] you know the clients were thin or maybe
[57:59] I had to figure out where to get some
[58:01] more money coming in with another client
[58:03] every single time instead of and again
[58:05] anyone who knows me I've always said I'm
[58:08] waiting for the day I can be the grumpy
[58:10] old guy and no one will get offended
[58:11] this has been my dream and some reason
[58:15] God is making me more positive and I'm
[58:17] not quite sure
[58:19] it's throwing me off a bit but every
[58:21] single time that's happened instead of
[58:23] dwelling on well I've got to figure this
[58:26] out well where's this money coming from
[58:28] my wife and I are just like well we're
[58:30] going to see what God's going to do and
[58:31] every single time he's done it every
[58:34] single time and and the funny thing is
[58:37] is
[58:38] my wife and I's relationship has been
[58:40] better I'm happier our family is closer
[58:43] the Lord has opened doors that
[58:45] I'm able to on a Friday say you know
[58:47] what I'm not working I'm going on the
[58:49] co-op field trip I did it last weekend
[58:51] I'll probably do it again Friday
[58:53] but it's because I work for myself I
[58:54] never could have done those things when
[58:56] when someone asked me to come and preach
[58:57] I don't have to say well I've got to
[58:59] figure out how I can take days off work
[59:01] and see if I can take vacation I just
[59:02] say okay I'm coming
[59:04] God did all of that and it's brought
[59:07] peace and comfort to my life it's
[59:10] brought all of these things that had I
[59:12] tried to do it on my own I wouldn't have
[59:14] and again I'm not saying this about me
[59:16] this was God every single bit of it
[59:19] but I wanted to give an example of what
[59:22] how God is showing me that if we just
[59:25] remember
[59:26] what it is that he's done
[59:29] that he will take care of us
[59:34] oh wow time's fine
[59:38] I'm going to come to close here in a
[59:40] minute but here here's the thing too
[59:41] that I love about this subject
[59:43] as much as you look at scripture of how
[59:46] many times God says remember remember
[59:49] and if brother Rapp is listening he'll
[59:52] appreciate this because I use this word
[59:53] in Sunday school and he was happy he
[59:55] said I'm the first person that's ever
[59:56] used it correctly
[59:57] I love the juxtaposition of what I
[1:00:00] consider God's greatest gift which is
[1:00:03] our ability to remember
[1:00:05] so he gives us our ability to remember
[1:00:07] all that he's done for us because it
[1:00:10] brings us that peace that Comfort amen
[1:00:13] but the opposite of that
[1:00:16] and sometimes even more important is
[1:00:18] he's also a blessed also blessed us with
[1:00:21] his inability
[1:00:23] to remember our sins
[1:00:26] it's important for us to remember
[1:00:30] that he doesn't remember any of it
[1:00:32] it's amazing to me
[1:00:34] that something that is so important for
[1:00:36] our lives the opposite is also so
[1:00:39] important for our lives
[1:00:41] Isaiah 43 25 says I even I am he that
[1:00:46] bloodeth out thy transgression for my
[1:00:48] own sake and will not remember thy sins
[1:00:53] that should be something that that alone
[1:00:55] that one scripture if we had nothing
[1:00:57] else in this book but that one scripture
[1:00:59] that enough for us to meditate on every
[1:01:02] single day enough for us to wake up
[1:01:04] every morning be like I got this
[1:01:07] nothing else matters that alone one line
[1:01:11] and yet so often like the children of
[1:01:13] Israel we have how many of those lines
[1:01:15] and we forget
[1:01:17] we let the circumstance we let the devil
[1:01:20] come into our lives and try to get us to
[1:01:22] focus on the things that don't matter my
[1:01:24] job didn't matter
[1:01:26] my ability to bring in an income didn't
[1:01:29] matter
[1:01:30] when the children of Israel went into
[1:01:32] the desert when did God ever say how
[1:01:35] many of you know how to find food in the
[1:01:36] desert
[1:01:37] he didn't because their ability didn't
[1:01:39] matter
[1:01:40] he was going to provide it
[1:01:43] why are we not understanding that he's
[1:01:45] going to do the same thing for us
[1:01:47] you know if you're like me oftentimes
[1:01:50] you think
[1:01:52] you know when I have a need come up God
[1:01:54] it doesn't seem like God's meeting that
[1:01:56] need and I've waited guess what
[1:01:58] sometimes he requires us to wait a
[1:02:00] little bit
[1:02:01] he's not punishing us he's just waiting
[1:02:03] to see are you going to remember
[1:02:06] are you going to remember what I've done
[1:02:08] no matter how long it takes me to meet
[1:02:09] the need are you going to remember
[1:02:11] and it's hard it's
[1:02:14] trust me I I grew up
[1:02:16] in circumstances that caused me to have
[1:02:18] to rely on myself a lot it is very very
[1:02:22] hard Kyle knows what I'm talking about
[1:02:24] he kind of grew up the same way it is
[1:02:26] very hard for me as a Christian
[1:02:29] to rely and I'm being honest fully on
[1:02:32] God I say it I believe it but when it
[1:02:36] comes to rubber meeting the road a lot
[1:02:37] of times I'm like God I know you can
[1:02:39] meet this need but I'm going to help you
[1:02:40] out I'm going to try to do it my way and
[1:02:44] he'll let me he's let me off a lot of
[1:02:46] times
[1:02:47] sometimes it works out but it never
[1:02:49] works out quite the way it would have if
[1:02:51] I let God do it amen
[1:02:54] in 1953 in the sermon Israel and the
[1:02:56] church brother Brandon said this oh
[1:02:59] honey you give me this good book to read
[1:03:00] and I read here where it says the sea
[1:03:03] ain't got no bottom
[1:03:04] and Jesus said he put my sins in the sea
[1:03:06] of forget excuse me forgetfulness
[1:03:08] forever said they're still going
[1:03:10] hallelujah hallelujah that's right sure
[1:03:13] still going ain't got no bottom see it
[1:03:16] up on top there they just come right on
[1:03:17] down keeps going oh my just keep on
[1:03:20] going Hallelujah that's right and I read
[1:03:23] that because I love how I kept saying
[1:03:25] how deep it was and there was no bottom
[1:03:26] and it just kept going because as much
[1:03:28] as I've talked about tonight that in
[1:03:30] order for us to take part in the
[1:03:33] promises of God that we have to bury
[1:03:34] those memories so deep that they become
[1:03:36] long-term memories
[1:03:38] even as deep as we need those to go it
[1:03:41] does not match how God how deep God has
[1:03:43] placed our sins
[1:03:45] all the things that we're worried about
[1:03:46] well God how could you love me God how
[1:03:48] could you do this for me because X Y and
[1:03:50] Z he has no idea what we're talking
[1:03:52] about
[1:03:54] God sees us through the blood of Christ
[1:03:56] he sees us in our perfection
[1:03:59] God God remembered Abraham not as a liar
[1:04:04] but the father of our faith
[1:04:06] he didn't see Moses as a murderer
[1:04:09] he didn't see Moses as a doubter he saw
[1:04:12] Moses as a deliverer
[1:04:14] David wasn't a murderer and an adulterer
[1:04:16] David was a man after his own heart
[1:04:19] he didn't say Rahab as an adulterer he
[1:04:22] saw Rahab it's an ancestor to Christ
[1:04:27] God doesn't see us the way we see
[1:04:30] ourselves
[1:04:31] God doesn't remember the things that we
[1:04:34] remember and see again this is that
[1:04:36] juxtaposition that God wants us to
[1:04:37] remember what he does but he's telling
[1:04:40] us forget your sins because I forgot him
[1:04:43] stop dwelling on the things that I don't
[1:04:45] care about because I don't even remember
[1:04:46] them so again our memory is important in
[1:04:50] one sense but in the other it also
[1:04:51] hinders us when and again it's that
[1:04:54] memory that comes from our flesh
[1:04:55] remembering all the bad things and what
[1:04:58] is it it's the devil that's trying to
[1:05:00] get us again to dwell on the things that
[1:05:02] are wrong what we need to do is remember
[1:05:04] what God has done
[1:05:06] you have to let those promises sink past
[1:05:08] your senses your flesh and meditate on
[1:05:11] them until they become those long-term
[1:05:12] rooted memories in your spirit
[1:05:15] and here's something to something to
[1:05:18] remember
[1:05:19] excuse me
[1:05:23] we will all remember what's important to
[1:05:26] us
[1:05:27] if Christ is important to you if what
[1:05:30] he's done is important to you if his
[1:05:32] blessings blessings are important to you
[1:05:34] you'll remember them
[1:05:36] because I will tell you we don't have
[1:05:37] trouble remembering
[1:05:40] our Hobbies we don't have trouble
[1:05:42] remembering
[1:05:43] um our sins
[1:05:45] we don't have trouble so why do we have
[1:05:47] trouble remembering what God's done
[1:05:50] because we forget how important it is to
[1:05:52] us but if we if we were just ourselves
[1:05:55] to constantly remember every time we
[1:05:57] wake up to remember
[1:05:58] what's important is what God's done in
[1:06:00] my life what God's doing for me stop
[1:06:02] looking at I'm not where I want to be
[1:06:04] and remember you're not where you were
[1:06:07] that's God's blessing
[1:06:10] you know
[1:06:11] and I don't want to say that we
[1:06:13] shouldn't be always striving to grow in
[1:06:15] Christ and to be more spiritual and to
[1:06:17] and to grow closer to him but
[1:06:20] if this is as far as God's going to take
[1:06:22] me
[1:06:23] praise God
[1:06:25] I want to go further but if this is what
[1:06:27] he has for me praise oh I heard someone
[1:06:29] say one time
[1:06:30] we as Believers get so wrapped up and I
[1:06:32] hope I don't get trouble for saying this
[1:06:33] but so wrapped up in I'm gonna go on a
[1:06:36] Rapture I'm gonna go into Rapture I'm
[1:06:37] going to go in a Rapture and he said why
[1:06:39] does it matter
[1:06:40] if God is ordained you not to go in it
[1:06:42] that's where God's ordained you to go
[1:06:45] that's what should matter what should
[1:06:46] matter is what God has ordained for us
[1:06:48] now I'm not saying that we shouldn't
[1:06:50] believe that we are or and hope for that
[1:06:53] I'm not saying that we shouldn't strive
[1:06:54] for more we always should but the Bible
[1:06:57] also teaches us to be content where God
[1:06:59] has placed us you know Brother Paul's
[1:07:01] talked a lot
[1:07:02] um that it's not about positions it's
[1:07:04] not about so often we think being more
[1:07:07] spiritual is
[1:07:09] rising up in a position or rising up in
[1:07:11] different things and it's not it's being
[1:07:12] content where God has brought you where
[1:07:15] God's bringing you I may not be as
[1:07:17] spiritual as maybe the next guy
[1:07:19] but I'm a spiritual as God's wanting me
[1:07:21] right now as long as
[1:07:23] I'm keeping my mind on him and I'm
[1:07:26] always asking him God what do you want
[1:07:28] from me where are you sending me as long
[1:07:30] as I'm doing that as long as he is my
[1:07:33] focus and I'm remembering his promises
[1:07:35] and what he's called me to do
[1:07:37] I'm where God wants me that's what's
[1:07:39] most important
[1:07:45] musicians if you want to come I'm going
[1:07:47] to close on this
[1:07:48] so again from Genesis Genesis to
[1:07:50] Revelation scripture reveals the power
[1:07:53] that God has placed in remembering
[1:07:56] not only for our sake but for our
[1:07:58] children's sake and our children's
[1:08:00] Children's sake there's so much power
[1:08:02] that comes just from remembering what
[1:08:05] God has done
[1:08:07] I read an article as I was studying this
[1:08:10] and the gentleman who wrote this article
[1:08:11] at the end he sums up perfectly kind of
[1:08:15] my thought and he says this he says it's
[1:08:17] time
[1:08:18] that we recapture the gift of
[1:08:21] remembering in a generation that doesn't
[1:08:23] know the story the message or the person
[1:08:25] of Jesus
[1:08:26] we need we need more than ever to
[1:08:29] remember ourselves and to find
[1:08:31] compelling ways to retell his story to
[1:08:34] every people group and culture not to
[1:08:37] get lost in Nostalgia but but to be
[1:08:39] released into fresh Faith and Hope
[1:08:41] fueled by the certainty that God is the
[1:08:44] same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:47] what he promised he will surely fulfill
[1:08:52] that is a simplicity
[1:08:54] of Christ
[1:08:56] we make it so much harder than it needs
[1:08:58] to be we're always I was talking to
[1:09:00] someone the other day we're always
[1:09:01] looking for some new deep truth so that
[1:09:04] we can see more we can seem more
[1:09:06] spiritual
[1:09:08] but if we would just focus on that Jesus
[1:09:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:13] and what he promised
[1:09:14] and what he did for the children of
[1:09:16] Israel what he did for all of his
[1:09:18] children in the Bible he will do for us
[1:09:20] today those promises were not just for
[1:09:22] them they were for us as well
[1:09:24] but the only way for us to step into
[1:09:26] them for us to to use the gifts that
[1:09:30] he's given us as we first have to
[1:09:32] remember we have to remember what he
[1:09:34] said we have to remember what he's done
[1:09:37] in our lives amen
[1:09:39] oh
[1:09:41] I I hope
[1:09:43] the stirring that God has put in my soul
[1:09:46] has come across tonight
[1:09:49] I know it seems like a simple thought to
[1:09:52] remember
[1:09:54] but I I've found as Christians just like
[1:09:59] the children of Israel it can be one of
[1:10:01] the hardest things we do
[1:10:03] because we rely too much on our senses
[1:10:05] what we see what we feel
[1:10:10] enough
[1:10:12] I I won't mention names but there's a
[1:10:15] sister that we all know who's going
[1:10:16] through health issues right now and I've
[1:10:18] been so blessed with talking with her
[1:10:21] family of
[1:10:23] no matter what's happening them saying
[1:10:25] God will take care of it
[1:10:28] it's okay no matter what the doctors
[1:10:30] tell us no matter what's happening no
[1:10:32] matter what it might look like
[1:10:35] it's going to be okay it's going to work
[1:10:37] out and I will tell you from
[1:10:39] conversations that I've had with other
[1:10:41] people who have witnessed this
[1:10:44] their testimony is reaching other people
[1:10:47] there's other people that I know who
[1:10:49] have left this message who are
[1:10:50] witnessing that and are starting to ask
[1:10:52] questions they're starting to wonder how
[1:10:55] how do they have that faith
[1:10:58] how do they trust so much and I know
[1:11:00] they're asking those questions because
[1:11:01] they've asked me I've had those
[1:11:03] conversations
[1:11:05] so again our remembering isn't always
[1:11:07] just for us
[1:11:09] sometimes it's for others
[1:11:11] sometimes it's just to spark enough
[1:11:14] faith in them
[1:11:16] that God can begin to build their
[1:11:18] testimony
[1:11:19] because once God can build their
[1:11:21] testimony and they start to share that
[1:11:23] then he's going to start to build
[1:11:24] someone else's and before you know it
[1:11:27] the last person the last testimony that
[1:11:29] God's looking to build will be built
[1:11:32] and we'll finally be able to step over
[1:11:33] in that Promised Land
[1:11:36] but we have to take heed of what
[1:11:39] happened to the children of Israel and
[1:11:41] to remember to always remember what
[1:11:43] God's done for us amen amen
[1:11:46] brother kidding if you want to come I
[1:11:49] just want to say I love you guys all
[1:11:50] tonight and I hope I didn't keep you too
[1:11:53] late but
[1:11:54] as I came up here tonight and I don't
[1:11:56] mean to keep going on my only wish my
[1:11:59] only hope and I I sat here this
[1:12:01] afternoon in this front row and just
[1:12:03] prayed was it it's not about me
[1:12:06] it's not about how eloquent I am it's
[1:12:10] not about how smart I can sound
[1:12:14] but it's about what God what what one
[1:12:17] word or two words that God can use to
[1:12:19] touch one of you guys
[1:12:21] if I can walk out of here tomorrow and
[1:12:22] this is last time brother Paul ever
[1:12:24] asked me to stand here but somebody was
[1:12:27] stirred enough
[1:12:28] to tomorrow when they wake up to say God
[1:12:31] thank you what you've done for me
[1:12:34] I'm good I'm done
[1:12:36] that'll be enough for me
[1:12:38] and so I hope tonight that that's
[1:12:40] happened I pray that it's happened
[1:12:42] but at the same time I'm not going to
[1:12:45] worry about it it's not my job that's
[1:12:47] God's job
[1:12:48] so I love you all and I hope the Lord
[1:12:51] blesses you abundantly for the rest of
[1:12:53] the week brother Gideon
