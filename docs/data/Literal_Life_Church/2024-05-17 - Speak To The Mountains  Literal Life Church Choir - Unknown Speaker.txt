Speak To The Mountains

Lyrics:
Why would I worry
When giants come calling my name?
My God is so much bigger than troubles I face
Why would I hunger
For power or riches or fame?
Oh, 'cause my God is so much better than all of these things

So I won't be shaken
I won't be moved
My God is faithful
His promise is true
So I'll speak to the mountains
"Oh, it's time to move
'Cause my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you"

My enemies scatter
'Cause they know the battle is done
My God is stronger, the victory's already won
Yeah, He died for my ransom
And rose up on the third day
Oh, 'cause my God is greater than death, hell, and the grave

Oh, I won't be shaken
Oh, I won't be moved
My God is faithful
His promise is true
So I speak to the mountains
"Oh, it's time to move
'Cause my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you" oh

There's no mountain too high
No valley too low
There's no fear that I have
He doesn't already know
There's no problem too big
There's no weapon too strong
There is nothing for God that's impossible
There's no mountain too high
No valley too low
There's no fear that I have
He doesn't already know
There's no problem too big
There's no weapon too strong
There is nothing for God that's impossible
(Nothing's impossible)

I won't be shaken
No, I won't be moved
My God is faithful (oh, He's so faithful)
His promise is true
So I speak to the mountains
"Oh, it's time to move
'Cause my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater
Bigger, better, stronger, greater
Bigger, better, stronger, greater
Bigger, better, stronger, greater
Bigger, better, stronger, greater than you"
