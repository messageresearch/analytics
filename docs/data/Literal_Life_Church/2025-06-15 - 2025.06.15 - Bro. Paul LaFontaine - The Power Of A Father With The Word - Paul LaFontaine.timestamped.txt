[1:22] for this day, Lord Jesus, that you made
[1:25] God. Thank you for your many blessings
[1:27] on our life, God, both natural and
[1:30] spiritual, Lord. But right now, we want
[1:32] to just set everything else aside, Lord.
[1:35] Lord, our jobs, Lord Jesus. Lord, our
[1:38] careers, Lord Jesus. Everything, Lord,
[1:40] that we deal on a weekly basis, Lord
[1:42] Jesus, we just set that all aside, God,
[1:44] and we we focus right in on you, Lord
[1:47] Jesus. God, we want you to speak to us
[1:50] this morning in a personal way, Lord
[1:52] Jesus. God, as we know, Lord, it's not a
[1:55] national revival, Lord, that we're
[1:57] dealing with, God, in this day and age,
[1:59] God, but it's a personal revival to each
[2:01] and every individual, Lord God. So God,
[2:04] we ask for that revival to sweep through
[2:06] this place. Lord Jesus, this morning,

[2:11] father, Lord Jesus. As I was just
[2:13] watching the Lord, the the army um our
[2:17] troops yesterday walking, Lord Jesus, uh
[2:20] God, I just thought of the fathers, Lord
[2:21] Jesus, that are true uh in this church,
[2:24] Lord Jesus, that should be praised,
[2:26] Lord. And Lord, bless, Lord Jesus, for
[2:28] their their soldier-like faith, Lord
[2:30] Jesus, walking with you each day, God.
[2:32] So bless each and every one of them this
[2:34] morning God give them strength Lord
[2:36] Jesus not just in their physical body
[2:39] but God give them revelation more than
[2:41] ever ever before God. Lord let them be
[2:44] leaders for their family God as you lead
[2:46] them Lord Jesus the mighty captain God

[9:37] life's tough. Amen. We just went through
[9:39] a battle this week. I was nervous. I was
[9:42] nervous. She uh my wife, you know,
[9:45] thrown up, nausea, you know, high temp.
[9:48] I was nervous. I was I was like, is this
[9:51] the time? Is like we're going to have
[9:52] this baby tonight.
[9:55] I was searching through all the drawers
[9:56] trying to find all of our stuff. And I
[9:58] was just like, which drawer do we go?
[10:02] Took us forever because to get to the
[10:04] hospital because uh it was just me being
[10:07] nervous.
[10:09] But no, I was I was nervous. But all is
[10:11] well. Amen. God is our healer. Amen. He
[10:15] provided our need right there. But it
[10:17] was just uh I kind of a feeling how I'm
[10:19] going to be through this whole thing.
[10:22] That night kind of proved everything.
[10:24] But Amen. Praise the Lord. Just had to
[10:27] testify of his healing again. Amen. God
[10:29] is so good. Amen. Praise the Lord. You
[10:31] may be seated. Praise the Lord. He never
[10:35] promised that the cross would not get
[10:39] heavy and the hill would not be hard to
[10:44] climb.
[10:47] Oh,
[10:49] he never offered our victories without
[10:53] fighting. But he said help would always
[10:57] come in time.
[11:01] So just remember when you're standing in
[11:06] the valley of decision
[11:09] and the adversary
[11:11] says give in. Oh, just hold on.
[11:19] Our Lord will show up. Hallelujah. And
[11:23] he will take you through the fire. Can
[11:27] we take it up?
[11:29] First verse. So many times I've
[11:33] questioned
[11:35] certain circumstances
[11:38] and things I could not understand.
[11:43] Oh yes. Oh in many times and trials
[11:49] weakness blurs my vision. Then my
[11:54] frustration gets so out of hand. Thank
[11:57] you Lord. Oh, but it's then I am
[12:02] reminded. Oh, I've never been forsaken.
[12:07] Oh, I've never had to stand one test
[12:11] alone. Aren't you glad this morning? And
[12:14] as I look at all the victories, the
[12:18] spirit rises up in me. And it's through
[12:22] the fire. My weakness is made strong.
[12:28] Oh,
[12:30] he never promised that the cross would
[12:34] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[12:38] hard to climb.
[12:42] Oh,
[12:44] he never offered our victories without
[12:49] fighting, but he said help would always
[12:53] come in time.
[12:56] So just remember when you're standing
[13:01] in the valley of decision
[13:04] and the adversary
[13:07] says give in.
[13:10] Just hold on.
[13:14] Our Lord will show up. Oh, and he will
[13:19] take you through the fire again. Just
[13:23] hold on. Just hold on.
[13:29] Our Lord will show up and he will take
[13:34] you through the fire again.
[13:41] Hallelujah. Every time. Thank you, Lord.
[13:46] Amen.
[13:47] Amen. Go down to F one more time. Amen.
[13:50] Let's all stand and sing this one.

[18:49] Hallelujah.
[18:52] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[18:56] Hallelujah.
[19:00] Well, praise the Lord. God bless you
[19:01] this morning. We want to just wish all
[19:03] the fathers a happy Father's Day in this
[19:06] special time and trust that you I think
[19:08] my family's going to take me out to one
[19:10] of my favorite restaurants. So, I'm kind
[19:12] of excited about that, especially when
[19:14] the kids are buying.
[19:16] They didn't know that till just now, but
[19:19] that'd be great.
[19:23] Praise the Lord. Well, um I thought I
[19:25] would read this that I read last night
[19:27] about Luther. I'm going to ask my
[19:28] quartet to come. We got a special song
[19:30] for for the men of God and I want them
[19:33] to come and prepare if they would.
[19:37] Martin Luther was a good father knowing
[19:39] as if by instinct the right mixture of
[19:42] discipline and love. He said, "Punish if
[19:46] you must, but let the sugar plum go with
[19:48] the rod."
[19:50] He composed songs for his children and
[19:52] sang these songs with them while he
[19:54] played the loot. His letters to his
[19:56] children are among the jewels of German
[19:58] literature. His sturdy spirit which
[20:01] could face an emperor in war was almost
[20:03] broken by the death of his favorite
[20:05] daughter Magdalina at the age of 14.
[20:09] God, he said, has given no bishop so
[20:12] great a gift in a thousand years as he
[20:15] has given me in Magdalina. He prayed
[20:18] night and day for her recovery. I love
[20:20] her very much, but dear God, if it is
[20:23] thy holy will to take her, I would
[20:25] gladly leave her with thee. And he said
[20:28] to her, Lena, dear, my little daughter,
[20:31] thou would love to remain here with thy
[20:34] father. Art thou willing to go to that
[20:36] other father? Yes, dear father, Lena
[20:38] answered, just as God wills. When she
[20:41] died, he wept long and bitterly. As she
[20:44] was laid in the earth, he spoke to her
[20:46] as a living soul. Deas leen,
[20:51] you will rise and shine like the stars
[20:54] and the sun. How strange it is. He said,
[20:57] how strange it is to know that she is at
[21:00] peace and all is well and yet be so
[21:04] sorrowful. I read that to show the heart
[21:06] of a daddy, the heart of a godly father,
[21:09] and how much he cares and has a tender
[21:11] heart for his children. not only just uh
[21:14] the fact that you be a daddy to them,
[21:17] but also a godly daddy to them. And I
[21:19] think that's a wonderful thing. It
[21:20] struck his heart so much to lose
[21:22] someone. It's a tragedy, but yet uh
[21:25] there's a higher heavenly father. Can
[21:26] you say amen? There's a greater father
[21:29] than even. And I I I would say oftent
[21:31] times us brothers who get to this
[21:34] certain age, my age, I won't tell what
[21:35] it is, but you know, you you start to
[21:38] second guess yourself. Did I do
[21:39] everything right? Did I do what I should
[21:41] have done? and you have a lot of things
[21:43] that you didn't do right. So, you live
[21:45] with some guilt and different things.
[21:47] And uh I'm sure that every man has had
[21:49] that. But uh I want to read some
[21:51] scriptures today that I believe will be
[21:53] an encouragement to us to see what
[21:54] fatherhood really is.
[21:56] [Music]
[22:14] I am Barabbus, a rebel, a prisoner.
[22:19] Death was the sentence for me.
[22:24] Led before Pilate, I stood there beside
[22:28] him. This man some were calling
[22:32] king.
[22:33] And as the crowd shouted,
[22:36] "Crucify him," the soldiers let me go
[22:41] free.
[22:43] What kind of man guilty of nothing would
[22:48] suffer the shame and disgrace?
[22:53] Paid on a cross, despised and rejected
[22:57] and willing to die in my place
[23:02] at Calary.
[23:05] for someone like me.
[23:10] Someone like me.
[23:16] Yes. My name is Thomas. For three years
[23:19] I followed. I saw every wonder inside.
[23:25] They say he is risen. That his grave is
[23:29] empty. But I just can't believe he's
[23:33] alive now standing before me. Jesus
[23:38] shows me the scars in his hands in his
[23:42] sight.
[23:44] What kind of man embraces the dollar
[23:49] lovingly drawing me near.
[23:54] I don't have to wonder if I've been
[23:57] accepted. You settle the worry and fear.
[24:03] I got
[24:07] someone like me.
[24:17] My name is Peter. I knew him and loved
[24:21] him. But oh, how I failed him that
[24:25] night.
[24:27] I promised Jesus that I'd never leave
[24:30] him. I willingly laid down my life.
[24:36] But there at his trial, I stood by the
[24:39] fire and I denied him three times.
[24:45] What kind of man pours out his mercy?
[24:50] Someone who stumbles and falls.
[24:55] No way it no way to deserve it.
[24:59] Forgiveness still came after all.
[25:03] [Music]
[25:09] [Music]
[25:14] I am bored. The guilty set free. Oh, I
[25:19] have been the doubt the redeemed.
[25:23] I have been Peter.
[25:27] Yes, I've been called free.
[25:33] What kind of man
[25:35] bleeds for the worthless and saves him?
[25:38] Whatever it takes.
[25:42] What kind of man would rescue the sinner
[25:47] and offer amazing
[25:50] grace?
[26:01] [Music]
[26:09] Someone like me.
[26:15] [Music]
[26:19] Someone like me.
[26:21] [Music]
[26:29] Hallelujah.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:35] [Applause]
[26:37] [Music]
[26:39] Aren't you glad this morning? Let's
[26:41] stand and give our Lord praise. Aren't
[26:43] you glad he saved someone like you?
[26:46] Hallelujah.
[26:47] [Music]
[26:48] Thank you, Lord.
[26:51] [Music]
[26:52] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[26:55] Hallelujah. those who have come to know
[26:57] God's grace. And there are so many other
[27:00] men in the Bible with weaknesses and
[27:04] different things in their lives. And you
[27:07] know what it takes? It takes Calvary.
[27:10] And he can save the worst of sinners.
[27:12] Can you say amen? We believe that with
[27:14] all of our heart this morning. If you
[27:15] would turn in the Bible with me to
[27:16] Psalms chapter 78. We're going to read a
[27:20] couple places in the scripture together.
[27:21] We welcome all of our visitors. Of
[27:23] course, we appreciate you being amongst
[27:26] us and we pray that you'll bring your
[27:28] hunger for the Lord and put it in with
[27:30] us and that makes us all the same. We
[27:32] have the same hunger for God and we come
[27:35] to the right place and that's to hear
[27:36] his word. Psalms chapter 78 of a couple
[27:41] unique places that I want to read here
[27:42] this morning and speak to you about the
[27:45] power of a father with the word.
[27:51] The power of a father with the word.
[27:54] Psalms chapter 78 and verse one.
[27:59] Give ear, oh my people, to my law.
[28:02] Incline your ears to the words of my
[28:04] mouth. I will open my mouth in a
[28:07] parable. I will utter dark sayings of
[28:10] old. I want you to pay attention to that
[28:12] that little phrase there uttering dark
[28:15] sayings of old which we have heard and
[28:19] known and our fathers have taught us and
[28:22] they've told us they've taught us. We
[28:25] will not hide them from their children
[28:27] showing to the generation to come the
[28:30] praises of the Lord and his strength and
[28:33] his wonderful works that he hath done.
[28:36] For he hath established a testimony in
[28:39] Jacob. Jacob means the children of
[28:41] Israel. He has established, God has
[28:43] established a testimony which means his
[28:45] ten commandments, his word, his
[28:48] precepts. He has established his precept
[28:51] in Israel. God has appointed a law in
[28:54] Israel which he commanded our fathers
[28:57] that they should make them known to
[29:00] their children. So God gives the word,
[29:04] but there's a commandment for the
[29:06] fathers to pass them on to their
[29:09] children,
[29:11] that the generation to come might know
[29:13] them, even the children which should be
[29:16] born, who should arise and declare them
[29:19] to their children, that they might set
[29:23] their hope in God, and not forget the
[29:26] works of God, but keep his commandments.
[29:30] What a tremendous multi-generational
[29:32] vision and passing down and
[29:35] responsibility the fathers have. 1
[29:37] Corinthians chapter 4
[29:40] in the New Testament.
[29:42] 1 Corinthians chapter 4
[29:46] and verse 14.
[29:50] I write not these things to shame you,
[29:53] but as my beloved sons, I warn you. So
[29:58] Paul the prophet is putting himself in a
[30:01] position or God put him in that position
[30:03] and he calls his converts and calls the
[30:05] people who are listening to him sons
[30:07] because because he's somewhat of a
[30:09] spiritual father to them. I write not
[30:11] these things to shame you because he had
[30:13] to give correction here and he had to
[30:16] give a lot of correction to the
[30:17] Corinthian church and when he was
[30:19] correcting them and getting them back on
[30:22] course he was being a spiritual father
[30:24] to them. Amen.
[30:26] I write not these things to shame you,
[30:28] but as my beloved sons, I warn you. For
[30:31] though you have 10,000 instructors in
[30:35] Christ, not just not the world, in
[30:37] Christ, you have 10,000 instructors in
[30:39] Christ, yet have ye not many fathers.
[30:44] For in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you
[30:48] through the gospel. Wherefore I beseech
[30:51] you, be ye followers of me. How much
[30:54] confidence is that to say you're my sons
[30:56] and daughters spiritually speaking? You
[30:59] should have confidence. Follow me as I
[31:01] follow Christ. I want you to notice you
[31:04] have 10,000 instructors. You may have a
[31:06] lot of instructors in Christ, but he's
[31:08] making a separation now. There's a lot
[31:10] of people instruct you, but the fathers
[31:13] are in a different category. When the
[31:16] father speaks the word, it has a lot
[31:19] more to it. Can you say amen? And how
[31:22] many can raise your hand and say, and
[31:24] some of you say you probably didn't,
[31:26] some of you didn't have that strong
[31:28] leadership with the father, but how many
[31:30] can say that God has a way of providing
[31:33] spiritual fathership when it's missing?
[31:36] Praise the Lord. He always will because
[31:38] that's the ones he wants to pass the
[31:40] word on to the next generation. Father,
[31:43] bless your word. We pray you anoint us,
[31:45] Lord. And I only preach what you give
[31:47] us, Lord, as we study and look at the
[31:49] things and pray. And we pray that it'll
[31:51] be a blessing to all that's here this
[31:52] morning in Jesus name. Amen. God bless.
[31:55] You may be seated.
[31:59] That phrase,
[32:02] we should utter the dark sayings of old.
[32:04] David said, I'm going to utter the dark
[32:06] sayings of old. And God is providing the
[32:09] word to his people. And it's I I kept
[32:11] looking that at that for actually for
[32:13] several weeks and wondering what this
[32:16] actually meant. This dark sayings of
[32:18] old. And when you have the word dark,
[32:20] dark means that it's a word that God has
[32:23] given that has it has the need uh to be
[32:27] spoken. It has the need not only to be
[32:29] spoken. Uh I looked it up and dark
[32:32] sayings actually means that there's a
[32:34] word that needs interpretation and it
[32:36] needs manifestation. So when it says uh
[32:39] that somebody needs to utter and speak
[32:42] dark sayings of old, they're actually
[32:44] the sayings of God. It's the precepts of
[32:47] God. But they have been lost. They have
[32:50] they have lost their light. And they're
[32:52] not dark because the word is dark.
[32:54] They're dark because they've become
[32:56] strange to the new generation because
[32:58] nobody is saying them. Somebody stopped
[33:00] saying them. Somebody stopped putting
[33:03] light on them. Somebody stopped uh
[33:06] speaking them and given interpretation
[33:08] to them. And so that's what it means by
[33:11] dark sayings of old. But he's saying, "I
[33:13] will utter the dark sayings of old." And
[33:16] uh and then it has of course when you
[33:18] speak of darkness uh then you you
[33:21] realize that you the contrast to that is
[33:23] light. And so when you are speaking dark
[33:26] sayings that have been lost, you're
[33:28] speaking light to that word. You're
[33:30] bringing light and you're bringing
[33:31] understanding.
[33:33] uh it's it becomes dark over time
[33:36] because it gets lost or it gets ignored
[33:40] uh by the main public in the in the
[33:42] world. It becomes dark because it gets
[33:44] ignored and it's not being spoken and
[33:47] lived in front of the new generation. If
[33:49] you go several generations and this word
[33:52] is not being spoken and it's not being
[33:54] lived because that's the other more
[33:57] powerful element. It's not just that
[33:58] it's said but it's lived in front of the
[34:01] new generation.
[34:02] And when you go several generations like
[34:04] that and it's not being spoken and it's
[34:07] not being lived, then you're going to
[34:08] have some problems. And the over time,
[34:11] the word gets lost. The word can get
[34:14] phased out when it stops getting spoken.
[34:17] I'd like you to anchor into a few of
[34:18] these foundational statements that the
[34:20] word, no matter how powerful it is, can
[34:23] get lost in a generation just simply
[34:25] because it's not being spoken.
[34:29] It must be spoken.
[34:32] Even when God spoke it, the spoken word
[34:34] is the original seed. It's the spoken
[34:36] word. It's not just that we have our
[34:38] Bibles and that we have these things and
[34:40] that's things that was spoken of course,
[34:42] but it has to be respoken. It has to he
[34:46] Jesus said, "My words that I speak unto
[34:48] you, my words that I speak," not just
[34:51] the words that's in your Bible, but my
[34:53] words that I respe unto you, they are
[34:55] spirit. They are life. They bring light
[34:58] to your life because then it moves away
[35:00] the darkness and so now you have
[35:02] understanding. Now you have light upon
[35:04] and when the word gets phased out and
[35:07] when it stops getting spoken. You see
[35:10] the word can get lost. The word can get
[35:12] lost in translation even it can become
[35:15] dark because it's interpreted by a
[35:18] denominational system. The word can be
[35:20] misinterpreted. It can get lost in
[35:22] translation. It can be interpreted by a
[35:25] denomination or by human beings that are
[35:28] kind of making up their own
[35:29] interpretation of it. And when you do
[35:31] that, it becomes dark. It loses its
[35:34] power. It loses its light. It loses its
[35:37] effect when it goes into darkness
[35:39] because men have put it into darkness
[35:42] themselves. One of the reasons that the
[35:44] precepts of God go dark is that the
[35:46] modern world smothers them out. It's
[35:50] kind of like an eclipse. when eclipse I
[35:52] know there's two types of eclipse but
[35:54] one of them is is when the earth gets in
[35:56] the way of the sun the sun is shining
[35:59] upon the church which is the moon and
[36:02] the earth the the world gets in the way
[36:05] of the sunlight and when it gets in the
[36:07] way the world gets in the way it darkens
[36:10] out the church it darkens out the effect
[36:12] of the light so that's an eclipse that's
[36:14] when darkness takes over can you say
[36:16] amen and and so then the word can get
[36:19] lost not only in translation But it can
[36:21] also get lost in an eclipse. And that I
[36:24] hope you're catching it. That's when the
[36:26] world becomes uh so uh involved so much
[36:30] in our lives that it begins to darken
[36:33] the precepts of God which is light. And
[36:36] so now our lives become darkened because
[36:38] why? We get away from the word. The the
[36:41] the world gets in the way. I don't know
[36:43] if you've lived that out or not that you
[36:45] had the light and then all of a sudden
[36:47] the world got in your way of the light
[36:49] and now your life becomes darkened. Why?
[36:51] Because the word has power in it. And
[36:53] when you darken that or where you
[36:55] smother it out, you're losing your life
[36:57] and power to be able to live. Let me
[37:00] remind you of something. When we come to
[37:02] God, we don't come with our own works.
[37:04] We don't come to try to figure stuff out
[37:06] ourselves. We don't come and say, "I'm
[37:08] going to do things in order to gain
[37:09] acceptance with God." You know what you
[37:11] do when you come to God? You just expose
[37:14] yourself to his light. Can I Can I get a
[37:17] response? People have complicated this
[37:20] so much and they think it all through.
[37:22] If I come to the Lord, I'm going to have
[37:24] to give up this and and they're more
[37:25] more worried about what they got to give
[37:27] up than what they'll get.
[37:29] People don't come to Christ because
[37:31] they're more worried about what they
[37:33] have to give up instead of what they're
[37:34] going to get out of it. Can you say, I
[37:36] guarantee you, you're going to get 10
[37:38] times more back to you. Can you say your
[37:41] family's going to get more when you give
[37:43] up those things? You're going to get a
[37:44] lot in return. you're going to get uh he
[37:48] says you you bring us your ashes and
[37:50] he'll take gold and make it out of
[37:52] ashes. He'll turn it. The exchange that
[37:54] you uh that you get in Christ is a
[37:57] wonderful exchange. And so now we see
[37:59] that it can have be an eclipse when the
[38:03] world makes the principles of God stupid
[38:05] or the more the world says they don't
[38:07] fit anymore or the world says they they
[38:10] they make fun of it or it's out ofd. Oh,
[38:14] that that that that you're saying,
[38:15] daddy, is so irrelevant now. It's so 10
[38:19] years ago. Uh what a deception to teach
[38:23] that somehow the word of God that comes
[38:26] from the mouth of God would would become
[38:29] something that would be out of date.
[38:30] That's such a deception
[38:33] because I believe when God speaks
[38:35] something, he had in mind all the
[38:39] pressures, all the temptations, all the
[38:43] perversions that would come even in
[38:46] 2025. And when he spoke his word, it's a
[38:49] timeless precept. And if the people will
[38:53] get a hold of it and respeak it to their
[38:55] children, it's a timeless truth. It has.
[38:59] We heard it Wednesday night from our
[39:01] brother from Nigeria. This word is not
[39:03] just a word. It has authority that goes
[39:06] with it. Can I get an amen? This word
[39:08] has authority already with it.
[39:12] It has power with it already. And so,
[39:15] you know, the world smothers it over.
[39:17] It's irrelevant. They make fun of it.
[39:20] Then someone starts then someone starts
[39:22] speaking truth that has become dark
[39:26] through the ages. And then someone rises
[39:28] up and begins to say it and begins to
[39:30] respeak it and begins to teach it to his
[39:32] family. Say, "We're going to believe
[39:34] this. We're going to follow this." And
[39:35] they start speaking no matter how odd it
[39:37] is. You know, sometimes I preach,
[39:39] sometimes I've told my children things,
[39:41] and I'm reminding them of what the
[39:43] prophet of God said, all the prophets of
[39:44] the Bible. I'm reminding them what the
[39:46] principles of the word are because if I
[39:48] don't, if I don't, then then all of the
[39:51] mo the new modern ideas will replace the
[39:53] word of God. Right? So, something has to
[39:56] be said and I have to be the bad guy. I
[39:57] hate being the bad guy, but somebody's
[39:59] got to say something. Somebody's got to
[40:01] step up to the plate. And I find
[40:03] sometimes you preach it or you say it
[40:05] and they look at you like you're from
[40:07] another planet. Why is that? Why is
[40:10] that? When things that used to be normal
[40:12] are not normal anymore. Principles of
[40:14] the word of God are completely crazy
[40:16] now. They're actually considered uh
[40:18] racism. They're actually considered all
[40:20] these new words that they have,
[40:22] homophobic and all that. When you speak
[40:24] the word of God, you can get put in a
[40:26] category that makes that precept of God
[40:29] seem like it's weird.
[40:34] So, you know, uh I'll remind you of a
[40:37] couple scriptures. You know, it should
[40:40] say sayings of light instead of sayings
[40:42] of dark sayings. It should be sayings of
[40:44] light because it should be the
[40:46] principles are of God are so visible and
[40:50] so known. You see because light is
[40:53] understanding. How many knows in the
[40:54] Bible when you talk of light, it doesn't
[40:56] mean a physical light. It means light
[40:58] means understanding. Light means
[41:00] revelation. Darkness is the opposite of
[41:02] that. Darkness in a generation means the
[41:04] lack of understanding of God's word and
[41:07] the understanding how to live in life.
[41:09] And when you go several generations, you
[41:11] don't have God's light. Then it becomes
[41:13] darkness. People do not I'll remind you
[41:15] of a scripture that has always explained
[41:17] it to me perfectly. John 1 and verse 5.
[41:20] I wonder if you could put these up. John
[41:22] 1 and verse 5. And the light shineth in
[41:25] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[41:28] it not. It's about comprehension.
[41:32] It's about understanding. And God shines
[41:35] the light, but there's so much darkness
[41:38] that they don't understand because
[41:39] they're caught in their lack of
[41:41] understanding. When he brings his word,
[41:43] he's bringing light to your
[41:45] understanding.
[41:48] Christ brings light in the world. Here's
[41:50] another scripture. John 3, John 3 and:e
[41:53] 19. And this is the condemnation that
[41:57] light is come into the world and men
[42:00] loved darkness rather than light because
[42:04] their deeds were evil. Now just imagine
[42:08] that that a world becomes to the place
[42:11] that they actually love and are so used
[42:14] to the understanding because remember
[42:17] that's what we're talking about is
[42:18] understanding. They're so used to the
[42:20] understanding of the world that they
[42:23] actually love darkness rather than
[42:25] light. That's a sad state to be in. They
[42:28] actually begin to love the darkness.
[42:30] They're so comfortable with the
[42:32] darkness. They've learned to function
[42:33] with the darkness and they're actually
[42:35] don't want the light. They they this
[42:37] this is the condemnation by the way.
[42:39] This is the ultimate condemnation. That
[42:41] light comes into the world. His word is
[42:43] spoken by a prophet and all of a sudden
[42:45] now the light shine and men are so
[42:47] groped and so love their life and their
[42:50] lifestyle and their darkness that
[42:52] because their deeds are evil. Why do
[42:54] they why do they shun away from it?
[42:56] because it exposes.
[43:00] It's not just that it's going to shine
[43:02] light and bring all the good things to
[43:03] your life. It exposes things in your
[43:06] life. Praise the Lord. That's right.
[43:09] There's there's some people who've went
[43:10] away and some God led them to move away.
[43:13] But there's some people that don't like
[43:15] the exposure and the type of preaching
[43:18] that light shines in their lives.
[43:21] Because I'm not here just to pat us on
[43:23] the back, tell us how good we are. Can
[43:26] you say amen? I've got a responsibility
[43:28] to bring all the word of God to you. And
[43:30] sometimes that's going to expose things
[43:32] that you don't want exposed. Sometimes
[43:34] it exposes things in me. But I've
[43:36] learned to be comfortable with that
[43:38] because on the other side of it, I'm a
[43:40] I'm a victorious man.
[43:43] I feel good because God has exposed
[43:46] something in my life. It's a good thing.
[43:48] You think it's a bad thing, but it's a
[43:49] good thing when he does that. But men
[43:51] will run from it because their deeds are
[43:53] able. It exposes their deeds. It's an
[43:54] openness. Can you say amen? And people
[43:56] sometimes they stop coming because this
[43:58] is just I had one man say it's just this
[44:00] two rubber meets the road. This is two
[44:02] down where we're living at. He couldn't
[44:04] take it. He liked the preaching that's
[44:05] way up. You know, we're the bride and oh
[44:07] my we we we're predestinated and you
[44:10] know we're as good as in the rapture and
[44:12] all that. And I love to hear that too.
[44:13] We hear that over this pulpit. But I'm a
[44:16] little bit different because so
[44:17] sometimes because we are human beings
[44:20] and because we can get off track even
[44:22] with the Holy Ghost. We need correction
[44:25] as sons and daughters of God. And that
[44:27] correction is good when it shines light
[44:29] on something. People run from it. I'll
[44:31] tell you that they go and God bless you.
[44:33] You have to go somewhere else. I trust
[44:35] that the Lord will bless you somewhere
[44:36] else. But sometimes it's just a little
[44:38] too tight because I talk about things
[44:41] sometimes that nobody's talking about.
[44:44] I don't say that to boast. I say it.
[44:45] It's in the word. I've got to say it.
[44:47] That's right.
[44:49] But men love darkness rather than light.
[44:52] What kind of condition is that? Actually
[44:54] become so used to the darkness that they
[44:57] love it.
[44:58] So smother out any light or anyone who
[45:01] tells them about the light and get away
[45:02] from them who love uh who they they
[45:06] actually love a place where there's no
[45:09] light spoken in their life. I don't want
[45:11] to hear it. I I've heard it since I was
[45:13] a child. I don't want to hear it
[45:15] anymore. And so they they they they're
[45:17] getting used to the dark. Or maybe
[45:18] they're getting used to living in two
[45:20] worlds. I could talk about that another
[45:22] time. But you're getting used to used to
[45:24] be a song the Macami sang getting used
[45:26] to the dark. We're getting used to the
[45:29] dark. We're not asking him to change our
[45:31] hearts. We're just getting used to the
[45:33] dark. And sometimes those songs don't
[45:36] make it very well in the industry
[45:39] because they're pretty convicting. But
[45:41] she spoke a truth. Sister McCammy spoke
[45:43] a truth. We're getting used to the dark
[45:47] and running from the light. You see, you
[45:50] know, my my wife, she
[45:54] she likes it pitch black in the bedroom
[45:56] when she sleeps.
[45:59] Now, wait a minute. I should I re I'm
[46:02] not associating my my wife with liking
[46:04] the darkness. Okay, let's qualify. This
[46:07] is Father's Day and I don't need to get
[46:09] in trouble. I want to go have that
[46:11] dinner today.
[46:13] But she does. She loves it. And she
[46:16] don't like one little nightlight.
[46:18] Nothing. I've tried just a little so
[46:20] light. And the reason that I like it is
[46:22] because I got to have something to find
[46:25] my way to the bathroom during the night.
[46:29] My toes have been stubbed way too many
[46:31] times. My knees have come across the
[46:34] bed, the end of the bed, cuz I couldn't
[46:36] see where the end of the bed was.
[46:38] And I don't understand why we can't just
[46:40] have a little light in our lives. We
[46:42] have it in all the rest of our life. We
[46:44] have the word,
[46:46] but we can't have it when we sleep. Not
[46:48] one thing. And then if I just if I, you
[46:50] know, we got Okay, never mind. We just I
[46:53] try one little thing. Why is that light
[46:55] on? Why is that? I can't sleep. You woke
[46:57] me up.
[46:59] So, I hate to say this, but because of
[47:01] this uh pressure in my life, I have had
[47:06] to learn how to walk in the pitch dark
[47:10] to count my steps
[47:14] like a blind person
[47:17] around the bed because since our
[47:18] marriage, for some reason, she gets the
[47:22] side of the bed that's closest to the
[47:23] bathroom.
[47:25] I didn't hear that in the marriage
[47:27] ceremony. I didn't hear that in any kind
[47:30] of contract.
[47:33] It's just a given. She always, even in
[47:36] motel, she gets the place closer to the
[47:38] bathroom. And I need the bathroom a lot
[47:41] these days.
[47:43] And so I have learned one, two, three to
[47:47] the baby steps. Baby steps to the end of
[47:51] the bed.
[47:53] baby steps around the bed, but I have
[47:56] knocked my head into things. I have been
[47:59] injured. Then you yell out an ouch and
[48:01] you wake her up anyway. It's sad, but I
[48:05] thought of this last night when I'm
[48:07] thinking of people getting used to the
[48:08] dark because they don't want the light,
[48:10] right? But also, that's the way it is in
[48:13] this world. So, they just get used and
[48:14] they actually fall in love with the
[48:16] darkness and they learn how to function
[48:19] in a dark world.
[48:21] They just function. and they're just
[48:23] barely surviving. They don't want the
[48:24] light in their life, but they've learned
[48:26] how to function in the darkness. I think
[48:29] that's really sad. When you have light
[48:33] and you have the message, which is the
[48:35] light on the scripture, when you have
[48:37] the word, when you have availability to
[48:40] all light that gets us in a rapture, why
[48:43] would anybody want to stay in darkness?
[48:46] Let's not learn to function in darkness.
[48:49] Let's learn how to function in the light
[48:51] because we can. Can I get an amen? We
[48:53] can function in the light. And so our
[48:56] text then says, look, and and I want you
[48:58] to look at our text in Psalm 78. Look
[49:00] who falls in the hands of taking this
[49:02] word that's dark and speaking it. And
[49:06] the word says it and the testimony, the
[49:08] commandments are given by the prophet
[49:10] Moses. And look who whose hands it falls
[49:14] into to respe it. Fathers.
[49:19] Fathers.
[49:21] It didn't say preachers. Now, I know
[49:24] preachers are spiritual fathers and they
[49:26] speak things. It didn't say Sunday
[49:28] school teachers. We thank God for our
[49:30] Sunday school teachers. But when it says
[49:32] it here that when the word comes from a
[49:34] pro prophet, he mentions fathers as
[49:36] being the one that you have a mandate.
[49:39] You have a responsibility to take those
[49:42] dark sayings and bring light to them and
[49:45] pass them to the next generation. Yes,
[49:48] sir. You not what you will not find a
[49:50] greater top responsibility of a father.
[49:54] You're not a father because you just
[49:56] fathered a child and you had a baby with
[49:58] a woman.
[50:02] You're you're just a daddy that had a
[50:04] baby with a woman. But there's very few
[50:06] fathers in this generation. A father
[50:09] number one priority, he's going to pass
[50:11] the word to the next generation. Can I
[50:13] say it again? A spiritual father is has
[50:17] a a a responsibility to take this word
[50:20] and respeak it and live it in front of
[50:23] his kids so that he when he's gone and
[50:25] kicks the bucket that word will live on
[50:29] with his legacy.
[50:34] All of these are important. Sunday
[50:35] school teachers, instructors, preachers,
[50:38] all these things. And pro a prophet,
[50:40] that's important because he's always the
[50:42] mouthpiece beast of God. In the Bible,
[50:44] the prophets were the mouthpiece of God.
[50:46] God didn't have any other lips besides
[50:48] the prophet to speak things. That's what
[50:50] he used to speak the original word is a
[50:52] prophet. But in this scripture, we
[50:54] realize the prophet spoke it, but it's
[50:56] passed down. It's uttered. gets passed
[50:59] to the next generation by uh fathers
[51:02] speaking it to the next generation
[51:05] saying it. This is it. This is what
[51:07] God's word says. I'm just re reiterating
[51:10] it to you. I'm echoing it to you. This
[51:12] is what God's prophet said. And uh and
[51:15] we find who who makes sure that it's
[51:17] carried on after the prophet is gone.
[51:19] The fathers make sure that the prophet's
[51:22] word is carried on to the next
[51:23] generation. The prophet is gone. He
[51:26] speaks it and then he goes on to be with
[51:28] the Lord whose responsibility is to take
[51:31] that prophet's word and hold it up
[51:34] before his family. The fathers
[51:40] the fathers.
[51:42] Fathers that's in their hands. Now what
[51:44] kind of influence and power on the next
[51:46] generation are we talking about here?
[51:48] Brother Steve Brouson was here and he
[51:50] had a section of his teaching on the
[51:51] family that spoke about women. the woman
[51:54] living on the voice of the of the man or
[51:58] the father or not just the voice of
[52:00] promise. He talked about it's not just
[52:02] that the man speaks and he was getting
[52:04] into how that it can be very detrimental
[52:06] to a woman if a if a man is silent
[52:09] especially on spiritual things. It
[52:11] creates insecurity in a family and in a
[52:14] wife if the husband is silent. Uh and
[52:16] I'm not talking about being shy. There
[52:18] are men that are more shy. There are men
[52:19] are more vocal. And I'm talking about
[52:21] that every man, whether he's shy or
[52:23] whether he's vocal, has a responsibility
[52:25] to speak the word to his family, to read
[52:28] the word to his family. I might get real
[52:30] basic here this morning and say to you
[52:32] just a simple thing. If you're not
[52:33] opening your Bible or or a message book
[52:36] or something and reading it to your
[52:38] family at least once a week or if not
[52:40] every day, just for a short time, you
[52:42] say, "Well, those little little babies,
[52:43] you know, they don't understand." Just
[52:45] do it. You don't realize the power that
[52:47] is over those kids. Amen. So, we just
[52:49] just fatherhood 101 here this morning.
[52:51] If you're not doing that, if you're not
[52:53] getting them in church, go ahead. Amen.
[52:59] You see, when you speak dark sayings
[53:02] that aren't popular, you might not get a
[53:05] lot of amens, but I'm telling you, you
[53:07] brothers have a responsibility to have
[53:09] your family and expose them to being in
[53:12] the house of God around the body of
[53:13] Christ. Get them up early. Get them
[53:16] there. And I appreciate all the fathers
[53:17] who do that. But some of you need to
[53:19] come on board and realize the
[53:20] responsibility of that and to teach them
[53:22] at home. In Deuteronomy, it says, "Teach
[53:24] them to thy children. Put them upon the
[53:26] doorpost of your house. Put them upon
[53:28] the the signs in your house. Put put
[53:30] them upon your bed post. Put the word in
[53:32] front of your family." It's the
[53:34] responsibility of the father and mother
[53:35] to do that. Keep the word. And you may
[53:37] not be a success in this world. You
[53:39] might not leave them a great
[53:40] inheritance. I'll tell you, my dad
[53:42] didn't leave us hardly anything, but he
[53:44] left us a wealth of things when he
[53:47] taught us and lived this message with
[53:49] all of his heart. I'm a rich man today,
[53:51] not in money from my dad, but in the
[53:53] spiritual wealth that he passed on to
[53:56] our family. He had devotions with us. He
[53:59] sat with us. We repeated the Lord's
[54:01] prayer even when we were young, very
[54:02] young children. He was consistent with
[54:04] that. He was consistent in church. And
[54:07] that got passed on. I don't want to I I
[54:09] didn't want to speak of my family. We've
[54:10] got great men of God here that's held
[54:12] this word up. They're not perfect, but
[54:15] they've held this word up before the
[54:17] family. My point to you today is that's
[54:19] the main priority is hold this prophet's
[54:22] word up in front of your family. That's
[54:24] the best thing you can do for your
[54:26] children. Say, "Well, I want to leave
[54:27] them an inheritance. I want to leave
[54:28] them money." All that is wonderful, but
[54:30] it's secondary. Never let that be more
[54:33] important than holding the word in front
[54:35] of your family.
[54:37] That's a true father. It's the voice of
[54:40] this father and the voice of a man
[54:42] that's respeaking things. And that's the
[54:46] bride. We live by the word. It's the
[54:48] woman. We're the bride. And Jesus said,
[54:50] "Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[54:52] by every word that proceeds out of the
[54:54] mouth of God." The bride lives by the
[54:56] word. The bride of Christ survives and
[54:59] lives and overcomes by what's been
[55:01] spoken to us. Man shall not live by
[55:04] bread alone. It It's not the things of
[55:06] the world. It's not all the money. It's
[55:07] not all these other things, but we're
[55:09] the bride lives by the word. I need a
[55:11] fresh word from God. Can you say amen? I
[55:13] need that word from the prophet and the
[55:15] scriptures to be re-spoken to me today.
[55:17] That's why I got my family in church. I
[55:19] need that word before me all the time. I
[55:21] need it to be resoken to me. I need to
[55:22] be reminded of it. Can you say amen? And
[55:24] I'm not never going to let that in. I'm
[55:26] going to be here. I'm going to be
[55:27] wherever it is. I'm going to be in the
[55:29] Bible because God can give me something
[55:31] for my family.
[55:34] And I'm going to make that the top
[55:35] priority. Can you say amen? I'm going to
[55:38] I'm It creates security in a wife when
[55:43] the the man and it creates security in
[55:45] the children if the man is a spiritual
[55:47] leader. Doesn't have to be a preacher.
[55:49] Doesn't have to, you know, don't take
[55:51] your two two year olds and go through
[55:53] the whole series of the seven seals with
[55:54] them. I'm not talking about that.
[55:58] But you adapt to what their age is. and
[56:01] and and if you adapt to their age, you
[56:02] just bring them along and then later
[56:04] they'll be wanting to talk about things
[56:05] like that because it's important. All
[56:07] those things are important. We should
[56:09] never ignore any of them. But you see
[56:10] now just saying that word just I was
[56:13] trying to look it up last night because
[56:14] years ago I heard in the early 1900s
[56:16] there was a big spike in u the uh
[56:20] literacy rate going up in the schools.
[56:23] And they kept researching trying to
[56:24] figure out what is this big spike going
[56:27] up in the literacy rate going up in
[56:28] children. confidence that they jump into
[56:30] their schoolwork. And finally, when it
[56:32] was all said and done, they find that
[56:34] the fathers were sitting and reading
[56:37] their Bible with their family and their
[56:39] children. And they attributed that was
[56:41] the most contribution to increasing the
[56:44] confidence and the literacy rate when
[56:46] they went to school.
[56:48] What's it about the father's power and
[56:50] the father's security he provides in the
[56:54] word? You try to provide security in
[56:57] money. I want to leave my kids all this
[56:59] thing. Well, you're going to get more
[57:01] security if you left them a legacy of
[57:04] pointing them to the word of God.
[57:07] Whatever way God leads you to do it, you
[57:09] don't have to be a preacher, but your
[57:11] legacy, if you want to leave a leg,
[57:12] leave a legacy, leave that legacy with
[57:14] your children. Is this okay with
[57:16] everybody today? You know, you create
[57:19] security by the things that you say. And
[57:21] he talked, brother Steve Brasson talked,
[57:23] you can listen to it again. We're
[57:24] getting ready to put the messages out.
[57:26] wonderful family series. But when a a
[57:28] husband or father's voice is silent,
[57:30] especially on spiritual things, he's
[57:32] he's got lock jaw and he don't talk
[57:34] about it. When he does that, it creates
[57:36] insecurity for the entire family.
[57:41] But when the father is vocalizing
[57:42] things, it creates security. When God
[57:46] spoke things through the prophet to his
[57:48] elect, it creates security in our
[57:51] hearts.
[57:53] You say amen.
[57:56] When God speaks, when God went to
[57:58] Calvary, when Jesus went to Calvary,
[58:01] what did it do? It creates security in
[58:04] the bride of Jesus Christ. That I don't
[58:06] have to earn this by my own works. He
[58:08] went to Calvary for me.
[58:11] So, you can create security, settleness,
[58:15] peace, or you can create chaos. You can
[58:18] create unsettledness. I don't know where
[58:20] daddy stands. I don't know how many
[58:22] daddies through the years that they
[58:24] tended church over and over again. They
[58:26] were here and some of them even
[58:27] faithful, but their heart wasn't in it.
[58:31] And guess who could tell? Maybe me as a
[58:33] pastor, probably not the rest of the
[58:35] congregation. Hey, they're here good
[58:36] enough,
[58:38] but the kids and the wife eventually
[58:41] sense, "Daddy's not on board. Daddy
[58:45] never hardly responds.
[58:48] Is this okay?"
[58:50] the kids pick up on if daddy's not all
[58:53] in and sold out to this thing. And
[58:55] eventually you see the fruits of it is
[58:58] the children, they don't have nothing
[58:59] secure and solid to to fall back. And a
[59:01] lot of times they don't respond to the
[59:03] invitation of the Holy Spirit because
[59:05] they haven't seen daddy respond. They
[59:08] haven't seen brokenness in daddy. They
[59:09] haven't seen him broken to say my life
[59:12] and repenting and repenting to them and
[59:14] repenting to God. These are all things
[59:16] that show you're a man. Because how many
[59:17] you know Jesus is not only lion but he's
[59:20] a lamb. He's the perfect man. What kind
[59:22] of man is this? He's the lion but he's
[59:24] the lamb. He has both sides. He's a lion
[59:26] to roar when he has to roar to speak the
[59:29] word. Can you say amen?
[59:32] When the rest of the whole jungle
[59:34] kingdom is screaming and it's chaos. The
[59:37] lion speaks and everything else shuts
[59:39] down.
[59:40] But then there's another part to Jesus
[59:42] Christ, the man, and that's the lamb
[59:45] willing to sacrifice, willing to go to
[59:47] Calvary, willing to die out to himself
[59:50] so his family can be healthy, willing to
[59:52] die to his the temptations he keeps
[59:54] falling into. I'm doing this for my
[59:56] family. I'm doing this for the sake of
[59:58] my family. I lay this down for the sake
[1:00:00] of my family.
[1:00:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:09] It brings confidence in them.
[1:00:13] It brings confidence when you're saying
[1:00:15] with your lips, "This is where our
[1:00:16] boundaries are. This is what our family
[1:00:19] stands for.
[1:00:21] We have a safety zone to run to, family,
[1:00:25] and this is the safety zone. This is the
[1:00:27] place I've been speaking about, the
[1:00:28] hiding place and the secret place." And
[1:00:31] and and let me just say to the
[1:00:33] congregation, those who are in our
[1:00:34] congregation, I want to say to you that
[1:00:36] there's a reason God leads a pastor to
[1:00:38] speak about these things. And if you
[1:00:40] come up onto trials in the next few
[1:00:42] weeks or next few months, let me tell
[1:00:44] you what's being preached over this
[1:00:45] pulpit is God's answer for your life.
[1:00:47] That you have a hiding place that
[1:00:49] nothing in this life that would happen
[1:00:52] ever changes your position with God,
[1:00:54] your peace with God, your rest with God.
[1:00:56] You need to be in that place in case
[1:00:58] something comes up that you can't
[1:01:00] handle.
[1:01:03] Don't ever underestimate what God's
[1:01:04] speaking ahead of time to prepare you
[1:01:07] for what's coming. But we have a safety
[1:01:09] zone. We can tell our kids we have to
[1:01:10] say we have a we have a bomb shelter in
[1:01:13] our home. Look at the brother from
[1:01:15] Israel now with his family. Two little
[1:01:17] kids, three little kids. And there he is
[1:01:19] looking outside his window with the with
[1:01:21] the things being shot from Iran. Look at
[1:01:23] these things happen. We don't live in
[1:01:24] that, but we we might someday. And and
[1:01:27] to have a bomb shelter that's in the
[1:01:29] bottom of your house may not be enough,
[1:01:31] but this word is a shelter from the
[1:01:34] storm. This word is a hiding place. Can
[1:01:37] I get an amen? We have a bomb shelter in
[1:01:39] our home. And you're telling it's the
[1:01:41] word of God. And that hiding place is
[1:01:43] the word. And it is a safety zone. Why
[1:01:46] do I know? Cuz dad spoke the word to us.
[1:01:50] And it is our safety zone.
[1:01:55] Praise the Lord. Brother Bram says, "I'm
[1:01:57] so glad that we have a shelter. My wife
[1:01:59] gave me this quote this week. It was
[1:02:01] wonderful. Sent it to our family."
[1:02:04] So, you know, she's not
[1:02:07] she's of the light, you know. She sends
[1:02:09] me quotes. I'm redeeming myself here.
[1:02:14] She sends me some wonderful quotes. I'm
[1:02:16] so glad that we have a shelter. The name
[1:02:18] of the Lord is a mighty tower. the
[1:02:20] righteous run into it and are safe. No
[1:02:22] matter how many bombs or many things,
[1:02:24] and I'm reading this because of the
[1:02:26] recent events the last few days, no
[1:02:28] matter how many bombs or how many
[1:02:30] anything else, we're safe there. So, the
[1:02:32] world and the sinner not having this
[1:02:34] shelter or this safety place, it's a
[1:02:36] shaking time. I believe if I wasn't a
[1:02:39] Christian, I'd go crazy to thinking of
[1:02:41] what might happen at any time. And with
[1:02:44] a house full of little kitties and
[1:02:46] everything, I wouldn't know what to do.
[1:02:48] But I'm so glad that I can stand in my
[1:02:50] house and introduce them to a shelter
[1:02:53] that no bomb could ever touch.
[1:02:57] Nothing else under the protecting wings
[1:03:00] of our Lord Jesus. Not by power, not by
[1:03:03] might, but by my spirit saith the Lord.
[1:03:06] And that is our protection.
[1:03:10] That is our protection. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:14] our text now going back again. I want to
[1:03:16] read it in Psalms 78. I want to just
[1:03:18] follow along with it and look at some
[1:03:20] things uh related. I don't want to miss
[1:03:23] these wonderful things in Psalms. So,
[1:03:25] where was it? Back to Psalm 78,
[1:03:28] I believe. It is Psalms 78. Just reading
[1:03:32] through. We have verse three. Which we
[1:03:34] have known and our fathers have told us.
[1:03:36] We will not hide them from their
[1:03:37] children, showing to the generation to
[1:03:40] come the praises of the Lord and his
[1:03:42] strength and his wonderful works that he
[1:03:45] has done. What am I speaking about? It's
[1:03:47] not always reading the word. It's
[1:03:48] telling testimonies. It's telling your
[1:03:50] testimony. That's right. Let your kids
[1:03:53] hear your testimony. Let your kids know
[1:03:56] how God uh brought you to truth. Let
[1:04:00] your kids speak it to them. Say it to
[1:04:02] them. You're passing something down.
[1:04:05] Daddy met God. Let your kids know the
[1:04:07] story of how you and your wife met. Let
[1:04:10] your kids know the story of the past
[1:04:12] mighty works he has done. Can you say
[1:04:14] amen? Let your kids know the praises of
[1:04:17] the Lord, his strength. If there was
[1:04:19] something that happened that God showed
[1:04:21] up, tell that story to your children
[1:04:26] and his wonderful works that he had
[1:04:27] done. For he has established a
[1:04:29] testimony. That means a law precepts.
[1:04:32] God gave the word and then it says which
[1:04:35] he commanded our fathers. He gave a
[1:04:38] command to the fathers that sh they
[1:04:40] should make these precepts known to
[1:04:42] their children to declare them to them
[1:04:45] to make them known to put light on the
[1:04:48] word so that they can see it clearly. He
[1:04:51] is handing this to the fathers. Why?
[1:04:54] Why? The prophet spoke it. The prophets
[1:04:58] in the Bible have it. But why is he
[1:05:00] handing it to the fathers to respe to
[1:05:03] the new generation?
[1:05:06] Because that's the person
[1:05:10] that's closest the closest connection on
[1:05:13] a daily basis to the ears of those kids.
[1:05:17] Not just the mother, but he has the
[1:05:20] closest Can you imagine, brothers, where
[1:05:21] you stand today? The closest connection
[1:05:24] to pass on the prophet's word to them by
[1:05:27] your own lips. and you're the closest
[1:05:29] connection. I'd rather you get the word
[1:05:31] in them before any teacher, before any
[1:05:34] college professor, before anyone. The
[1:05:37] mom gets them first. Brother Bram said
[1:05:39] that the young years and then about
[1:05:41] 1213,
[1:05:42] I'm going to say this because it's been
[1:05:44] echoed here many times. But there's
[1:05:47] there's a transition even in tribes and
[1:05:49] different things overseas. 12, 13, 14
[1:05:52] years old, the mom backs off and lets
[1:05:55] the dad take over and give him
[1:05:57] direction.
[1:06:00] There's something natural about it. And
[1:06:01] when the mom doesn't back off, she's
[1:06:04] just there for the boys or the girls.
[1:06:06] She's just there for them. But when when
[1:06:08] that real training comes in, she still
[1:06:11] does it. But she's had her part to play
[1:06:12] when they were young. And now that
[1:06:14] transition comes and you don't want to
[1:06:16] have a mother smothering their children
[1:06:19] or especially their boys, but they have
[1:06:21] to be given liberty because they're
[1:06:22] going to find their own way and they're
[1:06:24] given instruction by their daddy,
[1:06:26] whatever it is in business and things,
[1:06:27] but especially in the things of God.
[1:06:29] Then you're really praying that they
[1:06:31] receive and have a connection with God
[1:06:32] themselves. That's what you should
[1:06:34] really pray is let my children get the
[1:06:36] same God and the same Holy Ghost that I
[1:06:38] got because they're not going to make it
[1:06:40] without that. They're going to have to
[1:06:42] make their own decisions. Someday
[1:06:43] they're going to have to uh launch out
[1:06:45] on their life. What a terrible thing to
[1:06:47] launch out in life without having the
[1:06:49] Holy Ghost and a conversion on their
[1:06:51] soul. Can you say amen? That's why we
[1:06:54] pray so hard that God would get a hold
[1:06:56] of them. I just two or three uh want to
[1:06:58] be baptized now. I believe some young
[1:07:00] children again. We thank God for God
[1:07:02] dealing with their hearts. And I've said
[1:07:04] it before, you don't really you can't
[1:07:06] underestimate what they're hearing in
[1:07:08] their spiritual ears. And when God moves
[1:07:10] on their heart, you're leading them and
[1:07:11] everything. that when God touches them
[1:07:13] and makes it personal and they say, "I
[1:07:15] want to give my life to God. I want to
[1:07:17] be baptized with no coaching by the
[1:07:19] parents, you know, God is moving in to
[1:07:21] take that life over."
[1:07:25] We should be thanking God for that. We
[1:07:26] should be praying for that. Praise the
[1:07:29] Lord.
[1:07:31] He's handing it off to the fathers
[1:07:32] because they have the closest connection
[1:07:34] on a daily basis to those kids in this
[1:07:36] world. They're never going to hear this
[1:07:38] stuff. in this world. They're they're
[1:07:41] going to be in a world that mocks their
[1:07:43] their college professors and the
[1:07:45] influence are going to mock the word and
[1:07:48] mock the message of the hour. Amen.
[1:07:52] That's the world they're going into.
[1:07:54] They're going to find every way to
[1:07:55] reason out of it. They're going to say,
[1:07:57] you know, they're going to make it a
[1:07:58] cult. They're going to say everything.
[1:08:00] And some that even left the message turn
[1:08:02] around and make it that. Well, you
[1:08:03] better know where you stand.
[1:08:07] That's right.
[1:08:08] You better cling to a spiritual father.
[1:08:16] Paul says there may be a thousand
[1:08:18] instructors but none will be so powerful
[1:08:20] as a father both physically of the
[1:08:22] physical the physical father you have
[1:08:24] being a spiritual head and a spiritual
[1:08:26] father. When no one else says what Moses
[1:08:28] says anymore, a true father will say
[1:08:31] what he says. When you have voices in
[1:08:33] your life like that saying that no one
[1:08:35] dares to say. When you have a voice in
[1:08:38] your life that's saying the things that
[1:08:40] no one dares to say, it's not popular
[1:08:42] anymore. When you have that, that's a
[1:08:44] father in your life that God has
[1:08:46] provided in your life. To say the things
[1:08:48] that's unpopular to say, to say the
[1:08:50] correction that's unpopular to say. To
[1:08:53] say the correction when you might get
[1:08:54] laughed at and somebody says it because
[1:08:57] it's not daddy's word, it's the word of
[1:08:59] God. So, I'm willing to bear a little
[1:09:02] bit of the reproach because I've got a
[1:09:04] confidence this isn't my word. I've told
[1:09:06] my children that I'm echoing things the
[1:09:09] prophet said and I said this isn't my
[1:09:11] word. This is the scripture. It's not
[1:09:13] daddy's doctrine. Don't follow this
[1:09:15] because what daddy believes but follow
[1:09:17] it because it is the word of God. It
[1:09:20] doesn't change from generation to
[1:09:21] generation. It is our safe place. It is
[1:09:24] our stronghold. It is our tower that we
[1:09:26] run into. And if daddy goes and I I I I
[1:09:29] heard back that one of my sons says if
[1:09:31] daddy would go arai and the whole church
[1:09:34] would fall apart where do we stand in
[1:09:37] this message in this word?
[1:09:40] It's a good question all you young
[1:09:41] people to ask if that was removed in
[1:09:44] your life and people go arai where do
[1:09:46] you stand with this word? I'm going to
[1:09:48] be clinging to spiritual fathers that's
[1:09:49] going to keep proclaiming it to me.
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:54] Look at this multi-generational impact
[1:09:56] that the generation to come, this is
[1:09:59] what the effects the generation to come,
[1:10:01] verse six, might know them, even the
[1:10:05] children which should be born who should
[1:10:07] arise and declare them to their
[1:10:09] children. It's passed on through the
[1:10:13] fathers. It's passed on. When David says
[1:10:16] this, it's 350 years past Moses saying
[1:10:20] the commandments of God.
[1:10:23] 350 years David is saying, "Let the
[1:10:25] fathers keep saying these dark sayings.
[1:10:29] Let them utter them." Praise the Lord.
[1:10:32] What's the fruit of it? Generation might
[1:10:34] know them, even the children which are
[1:10:36] born, who should rise up and declare
[1:10:37] them with children. Here's the real
[1:10:38] effect. Verse seven. that they might set
[1:10:42] their hope in God and not forget the
[1:10:45] works of God, but keep his commandments.
[1:10:49] Set their hope in God. Isn't that
[1:10:50] wonderful? I love for my children to set
[1:10:53] their hope in God.
[1:10:55] David, it's 350 years. David, David,
[1:10:58] come on. It's been 350 years since Moses
[1:11:01] gave those things. Dad, that's so 350
[1:11:06] years ago.
[1:11:11] But dads, I don't care how dark it
[1:11:13] seems. Speak it.
[1:11:16] Amen. Say it. Speak it. Teach it. Live
[1:11:20] it. Can you say amen? Talk about those
[1:11:22] things. Who the father? So, who is the
[1:11:25] real father? Not someone who can just
[1:11:27] have a kid. Not just a man who puts food
[1:11:29] on the table, and that's a good thing.
[1:11:31] You should do that. But it's not. A real
[1:11:33] father is not just the one who gives you
[1:11:35] clothes to wear or leaves you
[1:11:36] inheritance. It's someone who speaks and
[1:11:39] lives the principles of God and they're
[1:11:41] not afraid to stand up for it even when
[1:11:45] it's not cool.
[1:11:51] Even when it gets out of date to your
[1:11:54] children, somebody's got to speak it
[1:11:58] again. And even when it's not cool. And
[1:12:01] also, I might say this, when they look
[1:12:03] at daddy, the word is in a bondage to
[1:12:06] them. The message isn't a bondage. It's
[1:12:08] not a frustration. It's not a downer.
[1:12:10] Kids can tell if this is a downer or if
[1:12:13] it's really life to you. Can I say it
[1:12:15] again? Kids pick up on somebody who's
[1:12:18] not allin and it's a real downer and
[1:12:21] it's really bondage. I grew up in this
[1:12:23] and yes, I'm going to say this to you,
[1:12:25] but they can tell that you're not allin.
[1:12:29] It should be a passion.
[1:12:32] It should be your greatest joy.
[1:12:38] You're not afraid to stand for it even
[1:12:39] when it's not cool. It's not bondage to
[1:12:42] you. It's not frustration to you. It's
[1:12:43] exciting to daddy. It's his greatest
[1:12:46] love. He loves to talk about God's
[1:12:48] precepts. It's a joy to him. He will do
[1:12:50] it even when his teenagers start calling
[1:12:53] it lectures.
[1:12:58] And it's not received well. When the
[1:13:00] teenagers are starting to say, "Oh, I
[1:13:03] know, Dad. I know, Mom. I know. Another
[1:13:08] lecture. Another lecture. I won't ask
[1:13:11] for a show of hands. How many's heard
[1:13:13] that before?
[1:13:15] And it's just the stage they go through.
[1:13:17] They're viewing it as another lecture.
[1:13:20] And so, I don't know. I can't tell you
[1:13:22] how to deal with that. It's just smile
[1:13:24] and keep saying it.
[1:13:29] Paul told Timothy, he said, "Be instant
[1:13:32] in season and out of season." And
[1:13:35] there's one translation that says,
[1:13:37] "Timothy, preach it when they want to
[1:13:40] hear it and keep preaching it when they
[1:13:43] don't want to hear it. Don't cram it
[1:13:46] down their throat." That's a wrong
[1:13:48] parent to do that. There's boundaries.
[1:13:50] There's respect. But you got to keep
[1:13:53] speaking it.
[1:13:56] and his word will not return void. Can
[1:13:58] you say amen when you know it's his
[1:13:59] word? You go through ages, you know,
[1:14:04] where even the stuff that you wear is
[1:14:06] uncool, you know, to your kids. Problem
[1:14:09] with my kids is they let me know that. I
[1:14:11] I bought the nicest pair of shoes and I
[1:14:14] thought they were the coolest things
[1:14:15] because they're not only cool, and I
[1:14:18] don't mean cool cold, they're they're
[1:14:20] cool and they're Sketchers. I'm I'm
[1:14:23] promoting Sketchers today because
[1:14:24] they're not only cool, but they're
[1:14:26] comfortable and you don't have to bend
[1:14:29] down to tie them. You just Brother Bart,
[1:14:32] are you a Sketchers guy? Praise the
[1:14:34] Lord.
[1:14:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:38] And we think we think they're cool, but
[1:14:40] I wore those last year. I walked in in
[1:14:42] front of my son Solomon and his buddy
[1:14:44] from town, and they both look at my
[1:14:47] shoes and they go, "What are you
[1:14:48] wearing?
[1:14:53] the the knee doctor the other day, she
[1:14:56] was looking at my shoes. I had another
[1:14:58] one a pair of shoes and she said she
[1:15:00] said, "Those shoes you're wearing, they
[1:15:02] may be cool, but they're not going to
[1:15:04] help your knees." So, I'm hearing it
[1:15:07] from everybody now.
[1:15:10] But I got these really cool shoes and I
[1:15:12] wore a shirt here a few weeks ago and
[1:15:15] you know I got a picture up on the
[1:15:17] family telegram or chat or whatever it
[1:15:20] is and and what is that dad? What are
[1:15:23] you doing? How much did you spend for
[1:15:25] that?
[1:15:27] Give me give me it back. I'll take it
[1:15:29] back for you.
[1:15:32] And you know what? Sometimes I let them
[1:15:33] know that I'm so confident that in a lot
[1:15:37] of ways I know for years I have set the
[1:15:40] new fashion trends in this message.
[1:15:43] I just let them know. So they need just
[1:15:45] need to give it time because things are
[1:15:47] coming back.
[1:15:52] Ann Landers says this. When I was four
[1:15:54] years old my daddy can do anything. When
[1:15:58] I was 5 years old my daddy knows a whole
[1:16:00] lot. When I was six years old, my dad is
[1:16:03] smarter than your dad.
[1:16:05] When I was eight years old, my dad
[1:16:07] doesn't know exactly everything. When I
[1:16:10] was 10 years old, in the olden days,
[1:16:12] when my dad grew up, things were so
[1:16:14] different. When I was 12 years old, oh
[1:16:16] well, naturally, dad doesn't know
[1:16:18] anything about that. He is too old to
[1:16:20] remember his childhood.
[1:16:23] When I was 14, here's where it gets real
[1:16:25] sticky. When I was 14 years old, don't
[1:16:27] pay any attention to my dad. He is so
[1:16:29] old-fashioned. When I was 21 years old,
[1:16:32] him he's hopelessly out of date.
[1:16:36] When I was 25 years old, dad knows about
[1:16:40] it, but then he should. He's been around
[1:16:43] for so long.
[1:16:47] When I was 30 years old, maybe we should
[1:16:49] ask dad what he thinks. After all, he's
[1:16:52] had a lot of experience.
[1:16:55] When I was 35 years old, I'm not doing a
[1:16:58] single thing until I talk to dad.
[1:17:02] When I was 40 years old, I wonder how
[1:17:04] dad would have handled this. He was so
[1:17:06] wise.
[1:17:08] When I was 50 years old, I'd give
[1:17:10] anything if dad were here now so I could
[1:17:13] talk this over with him. Too bad I
[1:17:17] didn't appreciate how smart he was. I
[1:17:20] could have learned a lot from him.
[1:17:23] They may go through stages
[1:17:26] up and down with their attitude towards
[1:17:29] you.
[1:17:30] But the word stays the same. Our
[1:17:33] attitude towards the word should stay
[1:17:35] the same. Our consistency should stay
[1:17:38] the same. Because if God gets a hold of
[1:17:40] their heart, they kind of grow out of
[1:17:42] those stages and realize, "Dad was
[1:17:45] pointing us to the only absolute that we
[1:17:48] have in this life, and that's the word
[1:17:49] of God."
[1:17:51] Can you say amen?
[1:17:57] It may have sounded like this back then
[1:18:00] in David's time.
[1:18:03] Kids,
[1:18:05] let me read some things to you,
[1:18:11] kids. God sent us a prophet.
[1:18:14] He gave us a word from God.
[1:18:17] It was actually wrote out by God on
[1:18:19] stone by God himself. He wrote it out.
[1:18:21] It was so important. He wrote it in the
[1:18:23] mountain,
[1:18:26] but it came right from God. That word
[1:18:28] came right from God. And then his
[1:18:31] prophet went down and spoke it to his
[1:18:33] people. He's telling his kids, God sent
[1:18:35] a word. He told us told us how to live.
[1:18:38] God sent a prophet and he spoke those
[1:18:40] words for God so he could come down out
[1:18:42] of the mountain and give it to the
[1:18:44] people so we would know. And guess what,
[1:18:46] kids? That word was the Ten
[1:18:48] Commandments. And you know what, kids?
[1:18:50] Every one of those commandments, God
[1:18:52] must have knew because every one of
[1:18:54] those commandments of thou shalt not
[1:18:56] steal and thou shalt not commit
[1:18:58] adultery. Every one of those address a
[1:19:00] problem that we already have in our
[1:19:03] fallen nature. God addressed every one
[1:19:07] of those things in his law to address a
[1:19:10] problem that we couldn't overcome
[1:19:12] ourselves. We're born with a nature.
[1:19:15] We're born with things that we want to
[1:19:17] do. And it takes the new birth. Amen.
[1:19:20] Yes sir. Only one thing, the new birth.
[1:19:22] That's it. Not even a law to live by.
[1:19:24] That's a wonderful thing. But daddies
[1:19:26] today are given the full story. And that
[1:19:29] is God gives his word, but he also gives
[1:19:32] his spirit to live it.
[1:19:35] You still with me? A couple more
[1:19:37] minutes.
[1:19:39] Every one of those commandments address
[1:19:40] a problem that we have in our nature
[1:19:42] that we're born with. And then when
[1:19:44] Moses spoke the ten commandments, then
[1:19:46] the days after it broke into many, many
[1:19:50] more things so specific that God must
[1:19:53] have loved us to be specific of how we
[1:19:56] live, what we do in our homes, how we do
[1:19:59] this, how we do that. God God was so
[1:20:02] specific to speak through the prophet
[1:20:04] for our lives. He must have loved us so
[1:20:07] much because he wanted us to give us
[1:20:09] some precepts, some principles, a
[1:20:11] testimony to live by. It must have been
[1:20:15] the heart of love that breathed these
[1:20:18] things out through his prophet.
[1:20:24] Daddy, did he say anything about what a
[1:20:28] girl should wear?
[1:20:30] Did he say anything about the difference
[1:20:32] between boys and girls and we should
[1:20:33] always keep them separate and they
[1:20:35] should dress separate? Did he say
[1:20:37] anything about that? And daddy says,"I
[1:20:39] glad you asked."
[1:20:42] I'm glad you're asking that question. I
[1:20:44] honor you for asking that question
[1:20:46] because you're curious and you want to
[1:20:47] know, "Did God say something about
[1:20:49] this?"
[1:20:51] And you can safely say, "He did."
[1:20:54] Sometimes you say, "I don't know. Let me
[1:20:56] go check."
[1:20:58] Can you say amen? Because there's some
[1:21:00] questions these days you got to do some
[1:21:02] research. But every time, friends, every
[1:21:05] time that I'm looking for an answer for
[1:21:07] my family, I find it in the word of God.
[1:21:10] I find it because God would not leave us
[1:21:13] without his answers.
[1:21:17] What is daddy doing? Yes, dad's honey.
[1:21:20] Dad's dad's telling you that the prophet
[1:21:23] spoke these things. It's so specific.
[1:21:25] You wouldn't believe how specific it is.
[1:21:27] even a protection over a daughter. If
[1:21:29] she would get engaged and make a promise
[1:21:32] she shouldn't make, the daddy's
[1:21:33] authority could break that promise that
[1:21:35] she's made because the daddy has that
[1:21:37] kind of authority and protection over a
[1:21:39] daughter's life. All these things and
[1:21:41] I'm saying some things sometimes that
[1:21:43] you don't even know about, but yet
[1:21:44] they're in the word of God. I think we
[1:21:46] should know. And I think we should know
[1:21:49] what God carried on to this generation
[1:21:52] through his prophet because there were
[1:21:54] things that went dark. There were things
[1:21:56] that went dark even in the last century.
[1:21:58] What a woman should wear went dark in
[1:22:01] this century. And guess what? We had a
[1:22:03] spiritual father 60 years ago in the
[1:22:06] prophet and he took those dark sayings
[1:22:08] and he spoke them and he put light on
[1:22:10] them and he says, "Yes, this is what
[1:22:13] God's heart is. What a woman should
[1:22:15] wear, what a man should wear, how a
[1:22:17] godly man should be."
[1:22:20] Yes, he spoke it.
[1:22:22] Now I need you to respe it.
[1:22:25] Yes, he spoke those things. What is
[1:22:27] daddy doing? He's making dark precepts
[1:22:29] and bringing them to light. Shedding
[1:22:31] light on something they never will hear
[1:22:34] in this world. And if they do, it will
[1:22:37] never be as powerful as a spiritual
[1:22:39] father saying it. I think we should do
[1:22:43] these things for our families. Brothers,
[1:22:46] some of you already are, but uh it's a
[1:22:48] call for men to be men and fathers to be
[1:22:51] fathers. It's not just an encouragement
[1:22:53] to fathers today, but it's also a call
[1:22:55] for you to rise. You say, "Well, it's
[1:22:58] I've done so many mistakes. I don't even
[1:23:00] know what to do now." Just rise and
[1:23:02] expose yourself to the light and start
[1:23:04] speaking it. Say, "God, fill me with
[1:23:06] your spirit." Can I get an amen? The
[1:23:09] devil likes you to live in your past,
[1:23:11] all your mistakes. No, I'm I'm pointing
[1:23:13] you to your future. It's time to make
[1:23:15] changes. And when you make even small
[1:23:16] changes, you watch that little family
[1:23:19] come along and say, "We'll get behind
[1:23:21] that." Because it's security to them.
[1:23:27] I'm shedding light on something that
[1:23:29] this world will never show them. It will
[1:23:31] never be as powerful though as a
[1:23:33] spiritual father saying, "I think we
[1:23:34] should do it, brothers. I think we
[1:23:36] should hand our families in church. I
[1:23:38] think we should speak the word of God."
[1:23:40] If your children are grown, then you
[1:23:42] keep holding that up in your life that
[1:23:44] you live. But if you feel overwhelmed in
[1:23:46] a in a nutshell, it's just you exposing
[1:23:49] yourself to the light. Can you say amen?
[1:23:53] This light has the power to do its work.
[1:23:56] It's not that you bring your works
[1:23:58] before God, but you expose yourself to
[1:24:01] light yourself.
[1:24:03] And everything dark turns to light
[1:24:07] through the word of God. Can you say
[1:24:09] amen? There's another section in I'm
[1:24:12] going to point you to read
[1:24:15] in in Jeremiah 35. I don't have time.
[1:24:17] I'm going to bring this to a close.
[1:24:19] There's a whole another section
[1:24:21] about a brother Jonadab and his family
[1:24:25] was the Recoite family.
[1:24:28] And once again, 300 years later after
[1:24:32] David. So now you got 350 years that I
[1:24:34] said from Moses to David. And David
[1:24:37] said, "The fathers ought to take these
[1:24:39] precepts and speak them again in front
[1:24:42] of their children to affect the next
[1:24:43] generation." Speed ahead 300 years, 350.
[1:24:46] It's I was looking it up. We're
[1:24:48] somewhere around there.
[1:24:51] And you have a family, the Recoite
[1:24:54] family in the church.
[1:24:56] And you find there that the prophet
[1:24:58] invites them to the temple, the whole
[1:25:02] family, and lays wine in front of them
[1:25:05] and bottles of wine and cups. And he's
[1:25:08] doing it for a purpose. He's doing it to
[1:25:10] prove a point to Israel that they're
[1:25:12] they're not listening and they're
[1:25:13] rebellious. But he brings a particular
[1:25:15] family in front of them, puts wine in
[1:25:17] front of them. And they all say, "We are
[1:25:20] not
[1:25:22] going to participate in this. We don't
[1:25:24] drink.
[1:25:28] And you know what it come from?
[1:25:31] 300 years before a brother Jonadab laid
[1:25:34] that down for his family for future
[1:25:36] generations.
[1:25:38] There's a bad Jonadab in the Bible. But
[1:25:41] this is the good one. So don't read the
[1:25:42] bad one.
[1:25:44] And he set that 300 years earlier to a
[1:25:47] family. And that family tradition and
[1:25:49] that family word continued and was so
[1:25:52] strong after 300 years that even in the
[1:25:55] modern-day temptation of wine being foot
[1:25:58] and put in front of them, they said, "We
[1:25:59] have a family principle. We don't drink
[1:26:02] wine."
[1:26:05] And who is it established by? A daddy
[1:26:08] who was a powerful man. He was an
[1:26:10] ordinary man in his time, but became
[1:26:13] very famous. wasn't a prophet, but he
[1:26:16] became very famous in his time for his
[1:26:18] wisdom and his piety and the way that he
[1:26:22] led his children. He also said, "We're
[1:26:25] going to live in tents. We're going to
[1:26:27] do this." He had a bunch of things he
[1:26:28] laid out and after 300 years, they were
[1:26:30] still doing it because they had such
[1:26:33] respect for what that man laid down.
[1:26:36] Don't tell me that the word established
[1:26:39] for your family is not going to last
[1:26:41] from generation to generation.
[1:26:44] The world may fall apart and even those
[1:26:47] kids sometimes may fall apart but the
[1:26:49] word remains the same
[1:26:51] and Christ's love remains the same.
[1:26:54] Christ doesn't change his love for you.
[1:26:58] Can you say amen? One more thing that
[1:27:00] the prophet said here
[1:27:03] in what dust thou hear 59. Do you know
[1:27:06] the walk that we make makes an example
[1:27:09] for others? really is an old story some
[1:27:13] years ago in England. There was a man he
[1:27:14] taught he thought that he would go out
[1:27:16] and have a little friendly drink at
[1:27:18] Christmas time just for fellowship.
[1:27:20] And he went out amongst his neighbors
[1:27:22] and he was exchanging presents and
[1:27:24] everybody would say to him, "Now John,
[1:27:26] just take a little drink of this and a
[1:27:27] little sip here and a little sip there."
[1:27:29] And he really got intoxicated.
[1:27:32] And on his road home, there had come a
[1:27:34] snow about 6 in and his little boy was
[1:27:36] following him. He couldn't pack him. He
[1:27:38] was too drunk and he was on his road
[1:27:41] home and he happened to turn around and
[1:27:42] notice his boy just almost wallowing in
[1:27:45] the snow. And he said, "Son, why are you
[1:27:48] wallowing in that snow?" He said,
[1:27:49] "Daddy, I'm trying to follow in your
[1:27:53] footsteps."
[1:27:55] And he picked up the little lad up in
[1:27:57] his arms and he said, "God, from this
[1:28:00] day on, I'll never take another drink."
[1:28:06] What jolted him? His son was following
[1:28:10] him.
[1:28:12] His son was watching what he was doing.
[1:28:16] I'm not here to be a a a bad guy to you
[1:28:19] today. I'm just holding something in
[1:28:21] front of you. There's a better life when
[1:28:24] we bring the word of God into our life.
[1:28:26] And I'll say it again. You think you got
[1:28:28] to figure it out. How am I going to do
[1:28:29] this? How how am I going to change my
[1:28:31] life? No, no, no. Don't try to change
[1:28:33] your life. Just expose yourself to the
[1:28:35] word the light and these dark things and
[1:28:38] maybe you're hearing for the first time
[1:28:39] today they won't be dark anymore all of
[1:28:42] a sudden they become important things
[1:28:44] like this man it become very important
[1:28:46] he realized and look at the commitment
[1:28:48] he can make right then say from this day
[1:28:51] forward I'm done with that and look what
[1:28:54] the effect is because I've got little
[1:28:55] eyes watching my life when I leave here
[1:28:59] someday I wouldn't want them to leave
[1:29:02] with that impression in their mind that
[1:29:04] daddy was compromising. I want them to
[1:29:06] believe that daddy stood for what was
[1:29:09] right.
[1:29:11] God bless the men of God who stand for
[1:29:15] the word of God. God bless the men who
[1:29:17] echo the message of this hour and the
[1:29:20] scriptures to their children and family.
[1:29:22] God bless them and God bless you for
[1:29:25] starting today to do that. God will
[1:29:28] bless you for it. You love the Lord this
[1:29:31] morning. God bless you. Let's stand and
[1:29:33] pray.
[1:29:43] Known him as a father,
[1:29:46] known him as a friend.
[1:29:50] I will sing
[1:29:52] of the goodness
[1:29:55] of God.
[1:29:57] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:30:05] All my life you have been so
[1:30:09] so good.
[1:30:13] With every breath that I am able,
[1:30:19] I will sing
[1:30:21] of the goodness.
[1:30:27] I love you, Lord.
[1:30:32] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[1:30:38] All my days
[1:30:41] I've been held in your hand. Oh Jesus,
[1:30:45] help us, Lord. From the moment that I
[1:30:48] wake
[1:30:51] until I lay my head,
[1:30:55] I receive
[1:30:58] of the goodness
[1:31:00] of God.
[1:31:03] Oh,
[1:31:06] all my life you have been faithful.
[1:31:11] Yes, you have, Lord.
[1:31:14] And all my life you have been so
[1:31:19] so good.
[1:31:23] Every breath that I am able,
[1:31:29] I will sing
[1:31:32] of the goodness
[1:31:34] of God.
[1:31:37] I love your voice.
[1:31:42] You have led me through the fire.
[1:31:48] In darkest nights,
[1:31:51] you are close like no other.
[1:31:56] I've known you as a father.
[1:32:01] Known you as as a spiritual father this
[1:32:04] morning. I have live
[1:32:08] in the goodness. That's right. Of God.
[1:32:12] Sing it now everybody.
[1:32:16] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:32:22] Yes.
[1:32:24] All my life you have been so so good.
[1:32:33] Every breath
[1:32:35] that I am able
[1:32:39] I will sing
[1:32:41] of the goodness
[1:32:44] of God. I love this verse. I love this.
[1:32:47] I love your Lord.
[1:32:50] We need to hear his voice. You have led
[1:32:53] me through the fire. His voice has
[1:32:56] security in it.
[1:33:00] You are just like no other.
[1:33:06] I know you as a father.
[1:33:10] I know you as a friend.
[1:33:14] I will sing
[1:33:17] of the goodness
[1:33:19] of God. Amen.
[1:33:25] All my life
[1:33:28] he's been a faithful father to us. He's
[1:33:30] never been inconsistent.
[1:33:32] Oh, all my life you have been so so
[1:33:38] good. So good.
[1:33:42] Every breath that I will take, oh,
[1:33:48] I will sing
[1:33:50] of the goodness
[1:33:52] from God. Think about this now. This is
[1:33:54] the father. Oh, this is the father. Your
[1:33:58] goodness is running after. It's running
[1:34:02] after.
[1:34:04] Amen.
[1:34:06] Your goodness is running after. is
[1:34:10] running out to me in my life right now.
[1:34:15] I'm surrendered now. I give you
[1:34:19] everything.
[1:34:22] Your goodness is running out. It's
[1:34:26] running out. Your goodness is running
[1:34:29] out.
[1:34:31] Your goodness is running out. It's
[1:34:34] running out. And we love you, Lord, for
[1:34:37] your goodness. Your goodness is running
[1:34:41] after. It's running after me.
[1:34:46] My life is made out. I'm now
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:57] running after
[1:34:59] running after me.
[1:35:04] Can you pray this morning? Just bow your
[1:35:06] heads and pray. And I just I plead with
[1:35:09] you as a minister of the gospel,
[1:35:12] while the bombs are
[1:35:14] while the bombs are being sent,
[1:35:17] while we're right on the verge possibly
[1:35:19] of another another war.
[1:35:22] I don't say that to scare you. I say it
[1:35:24] to put the fear of God in you. If you
[1:35:26] haven't completely surrendered, his
[1:35:29] goodness is running after you. The
[1:35:31] father's running after you.
[1:35:34] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[1:35:37] That's all it takes. Exposing yourself.
[1:35:40] Lord, I believe what's been spoken is
[1:35:41] the truth. And I want to receive the
[1:35:44] Lord Jesus. I'm 14 years old. I'm 20
[1:35:47] years old. I'm 50 years old. Doesn't
[1:35:49] matter the age. I'm ready to stop this
[1:35:52] up and down in my life. And I'm ready to
[1:35:54] give my life completely to the Lord.
[1:35:57] He's here this morning. He'll receive
[1:36:00] you. You just raise your hand. We'll
[1:36:03] pray together.
[1:36:05] Our precious Lord, would you be mindful
[1:36:08] of a heart this morning that would be
[1:36:09] searching for you? When I talked about
[1:36:12] darkness over this world and darkness
[1:36:15] even over the word, people can't even
[1:36:17] find it anymore. Well, Lord, that's not
[1:36:20] true this morning because you shine your
[1:36:22] light brightly.
[1:36:23] I pray Lord that light would push back
[1:36:27] push back the darkness in that person's
[1:36:29] life. Lord, if they're feeding on things
[1:36:31] that's bringing dark spirits and opening
[1:36:33] up to portals of demons, oh God, may
[1:36:36] they stand today and say, "I need my
[1:36:38] life sanctified by the word of God. Come
[1:36:42] into my life, Lord Jesus. Come into my
[1:36:44] heart. Take over. Take the control tower
[1:36:46] over, Lord. I pray, Lord. May your love
[1:36:49] break through. I'm letting it break
[1:36:50] through to my life just now. And as the
[1:36:52] song says, I'm laying it down because
[1:36:55] your goodness, Lord, has always been
[1:36:57] there for me. I'm not going to turn that
[1:36:59] down anymore. I'm not going to turn it
[1:37:01] down. I'm going to receive. I'm going to
[1:37:03] accept the pardon for my life. A pardon
[1:37:06] isn't a pardon until accepted as a
[1:37:08] pardon. My life hasn't been right, but
[1:37:11] Lord, would you make it right today as I
[1:37:14] expose myself to your light? Bless us.
[1:37:16] Bless the fathers. Encourage them. May
[1:37:19] they stand, Lord. May they step out,
[1:37:21] Lord, and realize this is something so
[1:37:24] powerful in their lives. Make the
[1:37:26] changes in us, Lord. We pray. We commit
[1:37:29] every life to you. In the name of Jesus
[1:37:32] Christ, we ask it. Amen. If you want to
[1:37:34] come to this altar this morning, it's
[1:37:36] open to just go before God. We'll pray
[1:37:39] with you. Nothing is more important than
[1:37:42] being close to the Lord and knowing
[1:37:43] where you stand in this late hour. So,
[1:37:46] we open it up to you this morning as we
[1:37:48] continue to worship. God bless you each
[1:37:50] one and enjoy your day with your fathers
[1:37:52] and the families today. God bless you
[1:37:54] each one. remember Wednesday night's
[1:37:56] service and also next Saturday at 6:00.
[1:37:59] God bless you. How many believe the name
[1:38:02] of the Lord is a strong tower?
[1:38:05] The righteous run into it and they're
[1:38:09] saved. Isn't that amazing? He has a
[1:38:11] place for us to run into and his
[1:38:13] goodness is running after us. And so
[1:38:16] it's a it's a it's a win-win situation
[1:38:19] when you were surrendered to the Lord.
[1:38:20] Can you say amen? Praise be to God. All
[1:38:23] my life you have been faithful. Gideon,
[1:38:28] come and sing.
[1:38:30] Yes.
[1:38:32] All my life,
[1:38:36] so good. So good.
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:46] Oh, I will sing
[1:38:48] of the goodness
[1:38:51] of God. All my life,
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] all my life, you have been faithful.
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:05] And all my life you have been so so
[1:39:10] good.
[1:39:13] With every breath that I am in,
[1:39:19] oh, I will sing
[1:39:22] of the goodness
[1:39:24] of God. I love you, Lord. I love you,
[1:39:29] Lord.
[1:39:33] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[1:39:37] [Music]
