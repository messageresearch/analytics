[9:58] [Music]
[10:05] we bring sacrifice a place
[10:18] [Music]
[10:27] [Music]
[10:43] [Music]
[10:55] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[10:58] you and ye shall be clean from all your
[11:00] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[11:02] I cleanse you a new heart also will I
[11:05] give you and a new spirit what I put
[11:08] within you and I will take away the
[11:11] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[11:14] give you a heart of Flesh I want you to
[11:17] notice he hasn't said that said yet
[11:19] those words I will put my spirit in your
[11:22] spirit this is he's only dealing with
[11:24] your spirit
[11:25] he is only changing your spirit he's
[11:28] only
[11:29] um he's only making your spirit more
[11:31] compliable more get alongable as it were
[11:34] so that you can get along so you can get
[11:37] in a place that you'd receive his spirit
[11:38] so he gives you a new heart he takes
[11:40] away your Stony heart he gives you a new
[11:43] spirit and then after that then he says
[11:46] verse 27 and I will put my spirit within
[11:50] you and cause you to walk in my statues
[11:54] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[11:57] them so on Sunday we were given the
[12:00] first part of redemption and just taking
[12:02] it in pieces so that even the children
[12:04] can understand it and the first part of
[12:07] redemption according to the law is that
[12:09] the wages of sin is death uh God said to
[12:13] Adam and Eve at the beginning if you eat
[12:15] of eat thereof of that fruit then you
[12:18] shall surely die so if you sin if
[12:21] there's unbelief in your sin and you eat
[12:22] of that you said you'll die so that's
[12:24] the wages of sin so if you sin that's
[12:27] that's that's you you can't get out of
[12:29] it that there has to be a punishment for
[12:30] it and and so now the only way that you
[12:33] can get out of it is someone paid the
[12:35] price for that sin someone paid the
[12:37] penalty a penalty has to be paid and so
[12:40] the only way that something can happen
[12:42] is you pay that penalty but you can't
[12:44] pay that penalty and say you can't deal
[12:46] with the problem so the only way is
[12:48] someone paying the penalty for your sin
[12:50] the first step is somebody paying the
[12:53] penalty you couldn't get out you you
[12:56] would finish this life you would die in
[12:58] your sins uh you would go to a sinner's
[13:01] hell you could not lift yourself up you
[13:03] could not pay your debt uh and you were
[13:06] helpless you couldn't lift yourself up
[13:08] and and and so then if we were wanting
[13:11] to begin to believe the word and start
[13:13] to come back to God we couldn't even
[13:16] start coming back until the penalty of
[13:20] our sin was paid
[13:22] you say do you want to come back to God
[13:24] I want to come back to God I want to
[13:25] come back to him but you see you
[13:27] couldn't until first your sin was dealt
[13:29] with because you never come in the
[13:30] presence of God with that sin
[13:33] so and you can't deal with your sin so
[13:35] you're actually you're doomed without
[13:37] the grace of God
[13:39] you're due without the grace of God and
[13:40] because of the penalty has to be paid
[13:43] that's the first step and praise the
[13:45] Lord tonight can you say praise the Lord
[13:47] he paid the debt for our sins he paid
[13:49] the full debt
[13:50] the debt of sin was paid at Calvary you
[13:54] don't have to pay it he paid it in full
[13:58] Ezekiel 36 look at this
[14:00] verse 16 moreover the word Lord came
[14:02] unto me saying son of man when the house
[14:04] of Israel dwelt in their own land they
[14:07] defiled it by their own way and by their
[14:09] doings their way was before me as the
[14:11] uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore
[14:14] I poured my Fury upon them for the blood
[14:16] that they had shed upon the land and for
[14:17] their Idols were what they had polluted
[14:19] it and I scattered them among the
[14:21] Heathen and they were dispersed through
[14:23] the countries according to their way and
[14:25] according to their doings I judged them
[14:27] and when they entered into the Heathen
[14:29] under the Heathen whether they went they
[14:31] profane my holy name so it's it's bad
[14:34] enough that Israel left God and began to
[14:36] serve Idols then when God scattered them
[14:39] to all the Heathen Nations they get
[14:40] amongst those Heathen and they start
[14:42] profaning the name of God when they said
[14:45] to them these are the people of the Lord
[14:47] and are gone forth out of his land so
[14:49] these people in the heathens were saying
[14:51] this is the people of the Lord this is
[14:53] supposed to be the ones that are blessed
[14:54] of God these are the Jews and they're so
[14:57] far away from God they're actually
[14:58] profaning his name and they're saying
[15:01] but these are the people of God these
[15:03] were supposed to be the people of God
[15:04] that's how far backslid they were that's
[15:06] how far backsled you were with sin in
[15:08] your life
[15:10] amen
[15:11] this is all about the individual now
[15:13] because remember at the End of the Road
[15:15] God saved Israel as a nation but he
[15:18] saves Gentiles as individuals
[15:20] so everything that applies to Israel as
[15:22] a nation applies to you as an individual
[15:25] and you by yourself born in sin shaped
[15:29] iniquity you're in a land you rebelled
[15:31] against the god you're out amongst the
[15:33] world amongst the Heathen you start
[15:35] acting like them you take on the nature
[15:37] you just you do what they do you smoke
[15:39] you drink you into all the kinds of
[15:41] things the worldly music and everything
[15:42] because you by Nature you have that
[15:45] nature so you're out there amongst the
[15:46] Heathen and a lot of times they're
[15:48] looking at saying hey didn't you have a
[15:50] better upbringing than that didn't you
[15:51] say this didn't you say that and they're
[15:53] kind of looking at you saying my weren't
[15:55] you weren't you you used to grow up in a
[15:57] Christian church or something I can't
[15:58] believe you're acting like that
[16:01] but I had a he's God says I had a Pity
[16:04] let's notice now I had a pity for my
[16:07] Holy Name which is the house of Israel
[16:08] had profaned among the Heathen whether
[16:10] they went therefore saying to the house
[16:11] of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do
[16:13] not this this next thing I'm going to do
[16:15] Redemption I do not this for your sakes
[16:18] o House of Israel but for my holy
[16:21] namesake which ye have profaned among
[16:23] the Heathen whether you went there's one
[16:25] thing we got to know about Redemption
[16:26] it's not just about you can you say man
[16:29] but it's about God said I made a promise
[16:33] that I'm going to manifest myself
[16:35] through human beings he comes in that
[16:39] his name could be glorified in your life
[16:43] and he does that through flesh the plan
[16:45] of God is for the word to be manifest in
[16:49] your flesh In the Flesh of Sons and
[16:50] Daughters of God but it's not about you
[16:53] it's about him in you and he's saying to
[16:55] Israel when I redeem you don't think
[16:58] that even that is about you I'm doing it
[17:01] to protect and restore my name
[17:06] you're going to read it he's going to
[17:09] say I'm going to do this I'm going to do
[17:11] that I'm going to do that and we could
[17:13] interrupt and say where do I come along
[17:15] how do I contribute there's none of us
[17:18] in it
[17:21] and guess what I'm glad there's none of
[17:24] us in it
[17:26] I'm gonna do this I'm Gonna Change you
[17:27] I'm gonna do that
[17:30] because when we inject into it
[17:33] that's what he said about the children
[17:34] of Israel when they chose law over Grace
[17:36] they should have chose Grace
[17:38] and they said to Moses give us a law
[17:41] tell us the Commandments tell us what to
[17:42] do and we will do it they should have
[17:44] never said that that's not a good deal
[17:48] they should have said we surrender Lord
[17:51] you do what you want to do in US 23 and
[17:54] I will sanctify my great name which is
[17:56] profaned among the Heathen which he have
[17:58] profaned in the midst of them and the
[18:00] Heathen shall know that I am the Lord
[18:02] saith the Lord God when I see he never
[18:04] lets the devil get the last word
[18:08] I will not let the last word be my name
[18:11] being profaned to the Heathen God said I
[18:14] will not let my name continue thy thing
[18:16] so now I'm going to take my people I'm
[18:18] going to redeem them because I'm going
[18:20] to get the last word Satan don't have
[18:21] the last laugh
[18:25] verse 24 says I will take you from among
[18:28] the Heathen and gather you out of all
[18:30] countries and will bring you into your
[18:32] own land he hasn't filled him with the
[18:34] spirit yet he hasn't changed their heart
[18:36] yet he said I just need to gather you
[18:39] out of all those Heathen lands and bring
[18:41] you into your own land and when your
[18:43] Christian Life Starts you don't know
[18:45] that God is beginning to call you and
[18:47] work on you even on some job maybe you
[18:50] were working in a bar maybe you're in a
[18:52] factory and cussing with all the other
[18:54] guys and and so but if you're a Son of
[18:56] God he's he's already hunting for you
[18:58] God is hunting for you because he's
[19:01] going to find his sons and daughters
[19:02] wherever they're at and he's going to
[19:04] say I need to get you separated from
[19:07] that atmosphere a bit and bring you into
[19:09] your own land first so I can start to
[19:12] deal with you he took Israel by the
[19:15] power of redemption out of all those
[19:17] he's in Heathen lands and gathered them
[19:20] all by something that was in heart we
[19:22] got to get back to Jerusalem we got to
[19:23] get back to Jerusalem they came from all
[19:26] the countries and he gathered them back
[19:27] hadn't even dealt with them yet
[19:30] hadn't even restored them yet but the
[19:32] first thing is I'm going to bring him
[19:34] out of all those lands
[19:36] I will gather them to their own land
[19:41] verse 25 then
[19:43] I will sprinkle clean water upon you and
[19:47] ye shall be clean from all your
[19:50] filthiness because you're too filthy to
[19:53] come before the Lord and you're
[19:54] certainly too filthy to receive his holy
[19:56] spirit
[19:59] God's got to deal with that old nature
[20:00] first
[20:02] I will sprinkle you clean water you
[20:04] should be clean from all your filthiness
[20:05] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[20:08] you you see this is why I preach to
[20:10] people in different stages of their
[20:11] Christian Journey
[20:14] I preach every service and everybody's
[20:16] at different stages
[20:18] and some people think that they're in
[20:20] they're in another stage than what they
[20:22] really are but the word reveals where
[20:23] you really are
[20:24] you're still all
[20:26] filthy from the idols of the world
[20:29] walking in this church
[20:31] well then you you can't just act like
[20:35] that you're a holy ghost Phil Christian
[20:38] your life needs to be cleansed of the
[20:40] idols you shall be clean from your
[20:42] filthiness from your Idols why cleanse
[20:44] you I a new heart also will I give you
[20:47] and a new spirit will I put within you
[20:50] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[20:53] of your flesh and I will give you a
[20:55] heart of Flesh your heart we want to
[20:57] allow God in this Redemptive process to
[21:01] be able to change our spirit
[21:03] and and see what do you do brother Paul
[21:05] you say Lord wherever I'm at
[21:07] be it unto me Lord
[21:10] if I'm not getting along with you Lord
[21:13] change my spirit if I've got a Stony
[21:16] heart that's just cold towards God and
[21:18] maybe everybody else God you got to deal
[21:21] with that Stony heart it's not just that
[21:24] you get the Holy Ghost but in this
[21:26] Redemptive work of God for Israel it
[21:28] wasn't just getting his spirit it's him
[21:30] changing your spirit first it's him
[21:33] dealing with your broken heart and some
[21:35] Sundays not everybody might get the Holy
[21:38] Ghost but somebody might get their
[21:40] broken heart their heart broken and soft
[21:42] before the Lord and then the next Sunday
[21:45] or even Monday they can be filled with
[21:47] the Holy Ghost so he says I then verse
[21:51] 20 said I will put my spirit within you
[21:52] and cause you so he's he's dealt with a
[21:55] Stony heart he's dealt with he's given
[21:57] you a new spirit that will get along
[22:01] and then I will put my spirit within you
[22:04] to cause you to walk in my statues and
[22:06] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[22:08] and ye shall dwell in the land that I
[22:10] gave to your fathers and ye shall be my
[22:12] people and I will be your God I will
[22:14] also he's not done
[22:19] this is so powerful friends this is so
[22:23] such a deep work
[22:25] God wants to do
[22:28] a deeper work in your life
[22:30] it's such a powerful deep work it's a
[22:33] process and he does it all can you say
[22:35] Amen but when we look at this Redemption
[22:38] taking place then we we realize that in
[22:41] these scriptures in Ezekiel 36
[22:43] the first thing that we have to know
[22:46] is that he
[22:50] he
[22:51] is doing it all it's almost like God
[22:54] responding to the all the eyes that
[22:58] Lucifer rose up in Isaiah way at the
[23:02] beginning Isaiah reveals
[23:04] he said I will lift my throne above the
[23:07] Throne of God
[23:09] I will set myself up I want to be
[23:12] worshiped by God I I I and he boasted
[23:15] and he boasted and actually went in
[23:17] caused the fall all these other things
[23:19] so it's almost like God is responding
[23:21] saying now
[23:23] all right you've had your time
[23:25] I will step in for my people now
[23:28] and you gotta imagine friends the devil
[23:31] he's the one that preaches no hope for
[23:34] this human being
[23:36] he's the one that takes somebody
[23:39] sometimes so far there's no hope for
[23:41] them there's no Redemption for that
[23:44] and then he tells you personally with
[23:47] your story
[23:48] I don't think there's I'm not sure this
[23:52] Redemption that is preached at the
[23:54] pulpit is for you
[23:56] everybody else seems to be getting it
[23:58] but I don't think it's for you and your
[24:00] family I think you're an exception to
[24:03] the rule that's the devil's voice
[24:06] that's the devil's voice
[24:09] I don't I don't I don't think and you
[24:12] know you you've got such you have been
[24:14] through so much and have such a Stony
[24:16] heart that I don't know you're a dick
[24:18] you're in a different category you're
[24:19] not in a different category
[24:21] and God wanted to tell Satan I don't
[24:24] care how deep the Stony heart I don't
[24:25] care how the spirit that won't get along
[24:27] with me I don't care they're scattered
[24:29] all over the Nations I don't care if
[24:31] they're defaming my name I don't know if
[24:33] they're care if they're cussing I don't
[24:34] care if they're swearing I don't care if
[24:36] the deepest pit that they're in if
[24:38] they're my sons and daughters I'm going
[24:40] to show Satan I'm gonna go get them
[24:44] I'm showing the devil that there isn't a
[24:47] dark pit black enough and deep enough
[24:50] there isn't a myri clay
[24:52] that is deep enough for me not to redeem
[24:56] my child somebody say praise the Lord
[24:59] he brought me out of the miraclee
[25:03] he set my foot
[25:05] notice he did it can you say Amen I'll
[25:07] bring them out I'll do this I got to
[25:09] finish before I sing I will also save
[25:12] you from your uncleanness I will call
[25:13] for corn I will increase it and lay no
[25:16] famine upon you I will multiply the
[25:18] fruit of the tree I will increase the
[25:20] field that ye shall receive no more no
[25:23] more reproach of famine among the
[25:24] Heathen I you know it's not you're not
[25:27] done after he puts a spirit in you it's
[25:30] still he's still telling Satan I'm gonna
[25:32] do this for my people I'm going to
[25:35] multiply your fruit of the tree then
[25:38] shall you remember your own evil ways
[25:40] and your doings that were not good and
[25:42] shall loathe yourselves in your own
[25:43] sight for your iniquities and for your
[25:44] Abominations not for your sakes do I do
[25:47] this saith the Lord heckles it again be
[25:49] it known unto you be ashamed and
[25:50] confounded for your own ways or House of
[25:52] Israel
[25:53] thus saith the Lord God in the day that
[25:56] I shall have cleansed you from all your
[25:59] iniquities I will also cause you to
[26:01] dwell in the cities and ways shall be
[26:04] building and the desolate land shall be
[26:06] tilled whereas it lay desolate in the
[26:09] sight of all that passed by and they
[26:12] shall say this lamb that was desolate is
[26:15] become like
[26:17] the garden
