========================================

trillions a day that you've created us you've placed Us in it so happy and thankful Lord that you've given us this day Lord we thank you this morning Father for you ministering to every heart every soul and every life father we've come to the service here this evening and we need you one more time Lord I feel scattered and need you Lord to come and take over my mind and my thoughts and may it not be a man that speaks tonight but may you speak lip to ear to Every Soul here Lord we believe that you can provide something for everyone tonight you're that God you broke the bread Lord and you fed five thousand fish bread fetus again tonight Lord father as we look into your word we ask Lord that you would help us now father to find your mind and to move quickly aside in we ask it now in the precious name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ can you say Amen this evening and God bless you it's certainly uh good to been here I told Brother Paul I said sometimes going somewhere else to church is like a vacation to a pastor it's good to go and see other people and and to realize that you're not the only one in the battle because the devil certainly tries to make you think that you're the only one you're the Lone Ranger in the battle and but there's um one thing I found that we all are in a battle together can you see me and we're all fighting the same same enemy you might be fighting it North I'm fighting in the South but we're fighting it to be able to go home thank you that will be all the music I I leave the singing up to my wife I'm not the best singer in the world I try sometimes but then I think I fail maybe I just need to practice more and I might be all right I can sort of carry a tune but I'm not a great singer I don't even think I'm a good preacher I certainly I've told the church I said I wouldn't have called me to preach the gospel you know if I could have chose a gift it would have been singing I would if God said which gift do you own I said I want to sing but we don't get to choose those things we gifts and callings are without repentance Joshua chapter 1 verses one through nine I don't want to take up too much of your time I want to move straight to the word of God I want to take a little thought something that I've been meditating for a while and just asking the Lord I knew it was going to be a youth median it's going to be really simple tonight but I don't know why we're going this way but we're we're living in an hour that that we have to know him more than anything else because that's the only thing that's going to stand can you say Amen to that Joshua chapter 1 verses 1 through 9 it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that Joshua that the Lord rather spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses now notice what he's doing he's reminding him of the prophet in his words but it's not going to stay right there it's going somewhere else from the wilderness and this Lebanon and to the Great River the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and into the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life now I like this part as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee I like what he gives him the encouragement he says be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt out divide for an inheritance the lamb which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest Prosper with orsoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou must observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous young person if you want to be prosperous listen to what the word is saying and then shall then Thou shalt have good success I love what he says to him he says have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest Heavenly Father Lord we one more time approach you we have read your word and we need to know what you once said tonight so we're surrendering I'm laying my nervousness aside my thoughts aside and asking you to take over this body and take over these thoughts and may you speak what you once spoke tonight Father for I am helpless I am just a mutant like a microphone that has no one to speak through it Lord I could say some things and it might would be of a help but I'm not interested in me speaking and being to help I want you to come and I want you to be the help tonight father meet the need as you said you would in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen God bless you may be seated I want to take just a real simple thought this evening and be conscious of time here but if I could give it a title it's just something that the Lord put on my heart of accepting the commission accepting the commission and I begin to look at the life of Joshua and I looked up the word accept it means to receive willingly to be able or designed to take a hold of something so in other words if you're going to accept it if if it's been given then that means you have the ability to grasp it you have the ability to take hold of it the word commission means an authorization or a command to act in a prescribed manner or to perform a prescribed Acts or it's a charge or an authority to act for in behalf of or in the place of another now remember he said as I was with Moses so will I be with thee and so to receive this command means that to accept it means that that Joshua had to be willing to take a hold of something Joshua had to be able to say you know what you're talking to me and I'm going to take a hold of it before we maybe this evening just look at the commission we want to um back up for just a minute just um Joshua and his life maybe some inspiration I'm not a Storyteller but we're going to attempt by inspiration just to look at a few things and the Bible says it don't say much about Joshua I think it's number 17 I believe it is or Exodus one of those books 17 and verse 9 is the first place you really find the word Joshua you you find him mentioned but it says that he was born the son of none so we know he was born he was born in Hebrew and he was born into captivity he was born into slavery so he was birthed into something that he didn't have a choice to be birthed into are you with me so in other words he was born but he was born for a purpose he God God had allowed this boy to be born for a particular reason and I want you to think about it young person as we're going through this tonight you just wasn't born to be born but you were born for a purpose you were born for a reason and the only person that can reveal that purpose to you God might use your pastor God might use a minister but it's going to take God himself revealing that purpose to you nobody else can you know you can say well brother so and so told me this or mama told me this or daddy told me this that's fine and good but it still comes back to God telling you what your purpose is are you with me this evening and I thought about maybe as a child if we could just go back into the life of Joshua's a child at night maybe after a long hard day of slavery and he'd watched his mom and dad and they were beaten with with whips and they were maybe bloody and they were bruised and they would come in and and and even though they were tired what little supper they had they would eat and right before they went to bed they began to talk about well you know in the word God promised us a deliverer he said that one day he was going to ascend and deliver and Deliver Us From This Bitter bondage and this had gone on year after year after year but sometimes it falls upon the right ears at the right time and the right moment when God is allowing something to transpire it falls upon the ears that's there for a purpose and so Joshua we begin to listen to these stories over and over him and he began he begin to maybe imagine well what's that deliver going to be like him and who is Jehovah anyway I've heard Mom and Dad talk about him and that he's going to send this one but as he grew he heard the promise over and over and over you know how sometimes we sit in church and we'll hear it over and over and over and over and we really just don't get it and we get upset because well I I'm not understanding don't worry about it it's there for a purpose and there for a reason and I can listen to his thoughts now as a as a boy and as he may be grew into his teenage years he said well you know I've heard that deliver thing all of my life I've heard that God is going to sin to deliver but when I'm watching Mom and Dad's health breakdown and I'm there ain't nothing happening around here and I I don't like where I'm at I don't like the situation that I'm in so when is God going to sin to deliver will he ever actually come in my lifetime will I ever actually see it or is this something that I'm going to get old and I'm going to repeat to my children is Jehovah even real if God loved us how can he let us suffer the way he suffers you know we all ask that at times we all get a little offended at God we get upset well if you really love me then why is it this way why is it that way but see God don't always tell you everything sometimes he withholds himself because there's a reason and a purpose for that if he was really real then how could we be where we're at today you might be asking yourself well everything's in a mess right now everybody's leaving everybody's doing this no everything is right on time there's nothing out of order with God but one day I can see Joshua maybe he he he maybe he's seen Moses and maybe he heard the story well yeah Moses there's something different about him he's going to be our deliverer he's going to one he's going to deliver us and he wants him and he hears the story where he kills one Egyptian and they say well praise the Lord this is it Jehovah is going to deliver us and the next thing you know oh he hid his body in the sand see Joshua has heard these things over and over and over but he's liking something he's lacking a reality he's missing something in his life everything that he was hearing everything that he was looking at was true but he himself wasn't liking something he was he was needing something and so then he hears how Moses well Moses got sent out to the backside he ran he got run out through the desert and there's no way he could have survived I thought he was this you know young person it's when you think it's this it's never really that are you with me it's when you think it's this it's never really that just ask some of these adults that's a little bit older we haven't figured out it ain't the way we thought it was supposed to be well I'm so disappointed brother to him well join the crowd who hasn't had disappointment who thought we was going to stay here this long we thought the Lord was coming but nonetheless he's still coming and you're here young person for a reason and for a purpose God has placed you here and and you know life was difficult for him if there was no end inside him and then maybe one day as Joshua was going down to the pit and he was working all of a sudden he gets some unexpected news hey Moses is still alive and and now Moses has come back with the message and he's talking to the king and he says let my people go Joshua was like oh I've heard all that before there's been other deliveries that's raised up who is this Prophet with a message kind of sound familiar don't a prophet and a message but in in the ending of Exodus chapter 12 Joshua finds himself following a prophet up out of Egypt and and we find in Exodus 17 I want you to listen now he finds himself receiving and following the instructions of a prophet Without Really knowing what it's about because he could see God in this man's life and he knew if he just did what he said it was going to work out but that wasn't where God was taking Joshua God wasn't leaving Joshua at the prophet he was taking him for a purpose he had called him for a specific reason and he finds him under the inspiration and the instructions of this prophet and he finds himself winning battles he knows I'm going to follow this message because that's pretty good it works it's worked out pretty good so far so I'm going to follow the message of the hour but now watch Joshua God had Joshua in mind for something very specific because God came to Moses and he said Moses write this in a book of Memorial and rehearse it in Joshua's ears so in other words it just wasn't about Mo Joshua fall in a prophet but God was trying to do something very specific with this young man he had a purpose he had caught him to a place Joshua we didn't understand it but he said record this in a book Moses and you rehearse it over and over in the ears of Joshua I thought about how maybe Joshua didn't catch it right then but what was happening when Moses said now Joshua what God told me to tell you this God was not established in a relationship between Moses and Joshua but he was reestablished in a relationship between Joshua and himself because he knew there was coming a time when Moses would go off the scene he knew there was coming a time that Joshua was going to be nor than just the message that God sent him a prophet are you with me now Joshua had the fortunate experience that he was there and experienced it but many of us today never have are you with me now Exodus 24 and verse 13 in other words God was bringing this thing real personal to Joshua it says in Moses rose up and his minister or his servant or his attendant Joshua and Moses went up into the Mountain of God so watch God has already spoken to Moses to speak to Joshua but now he's still here he's still following this prophet wonderful are you with me still following this Prophet Now put on your spiritual thinking caps whatever Moses spoke he followed it without understanding sometimes blindly Joshua went up with Moses and waited as God gave the instructions or gave the word now watch this he recognized that Moses was God's chosen Prophet because of the signs of a prophet was Vindicated before his eyes and to receive a prophet is to receive God John 13 and 20 says verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I sin receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me but now watch this in Exodus 32 and 1 we're going to place here with us in just a minute it says and when the people saw that Moses was delayed to come out of the mount in other words Moses had gone off the scene and all of a sudden there was a bunch of murmuring and complaining we don't even know what happened to Moses we don't even know if Moses was a prophet now we thought we were going to the promised land but here we are we'd have been better off if we'd stayed in Egypt we'd been better off if we stayed with what we believed if he'd have been a real prophet he wouldn't have struck the rock twice listen young people if you hadn't heard it you're going to hear things in the next few years you're going to hear things that's going to rock your world and you've got to have your ship stabilized are you with me Moses he's just a liar and a deceiver he's a false prophet well he was wrong here so he's got to be wrong over there oh my you know what I just think we've been following an occult all these years mom and dad they're cuckoo after all these years listen now I'm tired of a bunch of rules but your laws a bunch of regulations think about it let us get a captain let's let somebody lead us back well Moses is just a hypocrite he told us not to kill and he killed an Egyptian we don't need him anymore Moses had a temper if he was a real prophet of God he wouldn't even have that do you know what young people those murmurs and complainers and groaners were doing they were following a prophet they were not following the God that was working through the prophet are you with me now listen this very thing is repeating itself it's here today where oh we don't need this and we don't need that we've missed the point I want to get you a quote here in just a minute something that brother Branham said that just stirred my soul but for Joshua it wasn't just about a prophet it wasn't just about a connection let me drop something in here you know David was a young man before he was King he had a relationship with Jehovah he had a relationship before God sent him a prophet you know the difference between David and Saul young person Saul had a connection to Jehovah through a prophet but he never had a relationship and when all of that was pulled back from Saul he didn't know what to do because he didn't know the god of Samuel there's a difference between having a connection to something and actually having a relationship with it David didn't have a connection he had relationship so then when God took Samuel off the scene he had the words of Samuel but he had God also that's what established David through his trials through his mistakes when those walked away from David when those forsook David he still had his God oh my think about it for Joshua it wasn't unnecessarily about a prophet though he adhered to the prophet though he listened to the prophet he respected Moses and the instructions that was given by Moses but his eyes wasn't really on Moses if you get your eyes on your pastor he's going to disappoint you he's going to fail you because he's human but if you can ever see the god working through him and ever understand that through the Frailty of human flesh that God lives and dwells and moves and has his being then he can really help you I want you to think about this Joshua was there when the Red Sea was opened Joshua was there when the Egyptians drowned Joshua was there when Mary picked up the tambourine and began to dance because she had been delivered from the enemy he was there he had seen it he was there when Manna fell out of heaven he partook of it he knew what it tastes like Joshua was there when the earth swallowed up opened up and swallowed the rebels because they disbelieved Moses and his message Joshua was there when they were fussing about the doctrine of Moses listen young people let me tell you something from somebody that's becoming an old man don't ever argue about the truth leave it alone let God deal with you on it he'll take care of it you don't have to worry about rightly dividing it you let the holy spirit in your life rightly divide the word of Truth to you are you with me oh my he was there when they said well Moses didn't really mean that or he actually meant this Joshua heard it all but remember he said Moses write this in a book of Memorial and rehearse it and Joshua's ears just wasn't a connection but it was something that was very personal to Joshua are you with me now watch this I want to show you that he had this connection in Exodus and 33 in a couple verses there one place it says that Moses because of certain things it came to pass that he took the Tabernacle and he put it outside he put it outside the Tabernacle we put it outside of the camp and anybody that went to seek the Lord had to go outside of a camp to actually find him in other words they had to go away from their own thinking to actually find him one time Moses went into the Tabernacle and come out to the people but the Bible said Joshua departed not from the Tabernacle why God was established in himself to Joshua now why because he had a commission for Joshua would it take a hold of he had something that Joshua was going to do now everything that Joshua had heard all his life was starting to make sense Joshua was willing to go outside of theology Joshua was willing to go outside of a doctrinal camp Joshua could see God in Moses but he needed more than that you can see God in your pastor you can see God in your mother but you must see God in yourself are you with me you must see God in you young person oh my God see God was not established in a connection to himself through a prophet he was establishing a relationship with Joshua so that when God changed the mask Joshua we wouldn't get thrown away he wouldn't get thrown off in the wilderness he wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't find himself well I don't even know if it's true I don't even know what to believe think about it I want to read you a quote listen to what brother Branham says and it's in the Ephesian Church age he said Revelations chapter 2 and verse 4 he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love now listen when I read this I got a little excited about it he said to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints at Ephesus alone the messages is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years now he didn't leave it there listen to what he says it's a message then is to all generations in that span and he says Now history keeps repeating itself we've got young people that's been born along this Wilderness Journey we've got young people that's heard fussing and fight over the message fighting over Doctrine and they're like what's that about I need to know if Jesus loves me you know what I found as a pastor here in the last five years I preached enough funerals now to realize that what's going to take you across the river do you know the person amen he's good right I watched people let go of their fights I let people go go of their beliefs because you have to know him to cross listen to what he says now he said history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation's Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth generation there being maybe no Vestige whatsoever of the original Flame think about it down four generations deep I'm looking at a fourth generation since God sent a prophet I'm looking at four generations deep this is my heart this evening this is where I'm at when I'm I'm looking out I'm looking at four generations deep I look at myself my father was there in 1960 and brother branham's meetings there was brother Branham there was my father there was me and now here's my children and my grandchildren they've got to have a part of the original fire it's not coming in and putting her name on a mineral young person but it's experiencing a part of the original fire shouting's good speaking in tongues is good I believe in everybody I've experienced all of the nine spiritual gifts but you can experience every bit of those and still not have the fire are you with me you can experience all of it and still not have the fire oh I like this he said in the fourth there may be no Vestige whatsoever of the original flame he said but then God are you with me it's not God coming to a prophet to you but it's God himself right Elites the original fire again back into the church there's a generation that's going to raise up they ain't going to fuss they ain't gonna fight they ain't have an old fighter spirit because all they know is what Joshua has revealed to them they ain't gonna worry about was there a bridge ain't gonna worry about was there a bear they ain't gonna worry about this ain't gonna worry about that because God has reserved them for the fourth generation why because we're approaching the coming of the lord it's a dark hour in which we're living and if it's dark there then there's a fire that's greater than the darkness I said there's a fire that's greater than the darkness God himself listen man's Ministry is done are you with me listen young person you respect the ministers but you'll be looking for God through that minister that's the only thing that's going to light your fire I can't light my young people's fire at home but I want to preach the gospel in such a way that it becomes a reality to where it's just not God's in a prophet it's not this Doctrine and we believe X and we believe why and we believe Z I told the young people at home I said the devil believes that also but what he cannot produce is the life the fire of God [Music] you know as well as our older folks that what their young people are facing today is a greater challenge than what we faced are you with me it's a greater challenge today than it was back then he said in the fourth generation that God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren okay just because your mom and dad believes the message just because your grandpa leaves the mess believes the message that ain't got nothing to do with it it's got to be a fire lit on the inside of you it's got to be the original fire the acts 238 the Pentecostal I hope that ain't a dirty word around here listen pick the cost if you don't have Pentecost in your life we don't have it I ain't talking about Pentecostal isms but what happened in Acts 2 38 was what was called Pentecost it's when God set the fire in the church and that's the pattern hereafter listen I taught my children you asked my two older ones it's a home I taught them and I'm teaching Samuel about the life of the prophet and about the exports of God through him but I said you've got to have the same relationship that he had because God don't have no grandbabies in this I love my grandbabies now I love holding my little boy my little girl but I realize they born in sin they shaping an iniquity and they're going to have to they're gonna have to have a birth are you with me they're gonna have to be born again just like we did you know what I find sometimes old people ain't never been born again settled into a belief structure settled into a belief I did when God comes along and tries to move us we just like foreign I've been believing this for 40 years now what can you tell me see Joshua wasn't like that Joshua found his alone time with his God he was still listening to the ministry but something was happening with Joshua there was a fire that was getting lit inside Joshua he said salvation is not passed on by the natural birth any more than this truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word he said you start out with truly born-again Believers and the Next Generation comes along and there are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and now are Baptist can I say something to be okay I'm going to anyway if you don't have me back you're okay I love you anyway we've taken the name of message believers but what is a message believer what is a message believer somebody tell me what is a message believer listen Methodist and brother Bram says Etc he said that's exactly what they are to they aren't Christians [Music] watch now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake directly and to Joshua he spake one-on-one to Joshua now well I need the preacher to speak to me maybe God wants you to get a loan and get quiet and let him speak to you that Moses my servant is there now therefore arise and go over this Jordan Joshua could have said well I'm not capable of doing it I'm not old enough to do it what do I do God says I just need you to listen to me I need you to rise and I need you to take the commission that I've given you see it was no longer with somebody else young person it was with him personally now he had accepted the commission well God can't lie I I I I've seen him with Moses and he says I'll be with you now I'll be with you as I was with Moses now watch what he says in verse 3 he says every place that the soul of your mama's foot shall tread every place that your daddy's foot is going to tread your pastor's foot the prophet's foot brother Brown's foot I told the church a while back I said we can identify Malachi 4 5 and 6 we can identify the who the Lord was we can identify the messenger but can you identify the you in that picture he was sent for a very specific reason there shall not be any man to be able to stand before thee all the days of the life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee in other words it just wasn't contained somewhere else but it was now very personal was Joshua because he said I accept I received this thing it's no longer just a figment of my imagination now I want to give you a a story here for just a minute I won't be too much longer I want to give you a story of a of a young man who who grew up in the message if I can say it that way and and it's like I said this morning I believe the message and I believe the messenger there ain't nothing wrong with any of that but young person I'm going to tell you something God has to walk off the pages of the Bible God has to walk off of a quote and has to walk down into your life or guess what's going to happen there's going to be a Vortex that comes along a tornado and just sucks you right out and you're gonna be like well I thought I thought I believed what did you believe really did you believe in him or did you believe in an idea did you believe in a theology did you believe in something way out here there was a young man that was raised in the message that all of his life and he listened to it and he heard every Doctrine coming and going he didn't even know what to believe anymore he's like was it I don't even know if it's true this was before it was a mass Exodus he don't even know what to believe he's got all these filters in his mind he's got all these ideas of what it's like and he's like well well what do I really believe um well I I I know they've said he's a prophet but is he really a prophet I mean I've heard and I know people that's been in those meetings but see God is the butt Destroyer he's the one that wants to answer all your questions he wants to take you from a spirit of confusion to a spirit of clarity and this young man was raised him he was he he grew up and he believed and he did all the right things and he knew all the right sayings and he knew how to act in church and oh he was a believer outside but not inside and he had a certain filter because that's what Mom and Dad believed he had this filter and everything was filtered through this and this was the message of the hour for him and he got up he got older and he got married and he started having children and he was like hmm I'm not so sure anymore I heard what Mom and Dad said but I don't know I just I'm a little confused what do I do and then one day he gets tired of the confusion one day he he grabs a a a a player and grab some MP3s he says I'm going to figure this thing out for myself and he says you know I I I don't know what's true I don't know what really to believe but Lord I believe that this is your voice to me he did have enough sense to say that and he said I don't have a filter I don't have a doctoral filter but I want you to reveal you to me are you with me he'd heard of God of a prophet he'd seen God in Mom and Dad but he didn't know God for himself are you with me he didn't know that God he was wondering where is the god of Elijah where is the god do I read the Bible he we read the Bible and we see that the god that does all these things that God's still supposed to be in the church but he's not seeing him what he's seen is a bunch of fussing and fighting out of what's supposed to be mature adults but they're immature and they separate over Doctrine it won't speak to each other for 30 years and he's like there's something wrong with this picture and he begins to have a Joshua experience he begins to listen for himself and all of a sudden hears a story of a of a woman that drops dead a city block away and brother branham's media and says she said if I die take me on through the prayer line anyway and so The Story Goes brother Brandon related how that how that she was brought through the prayer line and God raised her from the dead this young man that said I'll serve a god like that where is that God are you with me not the god of Doctrine we got to have the right teaching instruction but we can have all that and never know that he's real never know that he's alive never know that there's a generation that's going on or you understand that's had the power of God in it but it must become reality to the Next Generation and he starts crying he says Lord that is not fair to me don't ever tell God something ain't Fair that's not fair you took that gift off the scene five years before I was born if I had a button I would go back and push that button so I could see that why because inside of every human being they want to know the reality of true power and he's sitting here and he's crying he's weeping because where is that God and he says hey listen to me I've got a commission if you'll accept it will you take it and the voice speaks to him and says I have a question for you where was her faith anchored because this young man was wanting to see a God that was alive not a god of teaching not of God contained in a Pulpit but a God who walked down the aisles a God who walked in the home a God who walked at work are you with me I thought that when he would call he would answer he didn't know if he was existing or not and that young man says I I don't know where Faith was anchored and the Holy Spirit speaks back to him and says her faith was anchored in a risen savior working through a submitted vessel I am Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and in the instant he became a True Believer you see that was me I was raised mom and dad had been to the meetings oh I would have loved to have been there but God's gift is gone God's a god of history now where is this God from that moment I have never doubted him one time because you know what I took a commission that if you repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you will receive the literal life of God himself it's not second-handed anymore it's not contained to another vessel but it's contained in inside of this and these become Oracles of God that's walking we don't listen young people you don't gotta wait until you're 50 to get it you don't got to wait until you go through this oh you got to say God who are you and where are you he says I am so glad you finally asked me I'm glad somebody asking me who I am let me show you that I was in the Old Testament and I am now in the New Testament the same God that was in the pillar of fire that I will be in you and I will dwell in you and I will walk in you and as I was with Moses as I was with Joshua as I was with brother Bynum so will I be with the housewife so will I be with the young sister that don't feel like she's nothing so will I be with you when you feel like turning and walking away that I am the god who give the message I am the god that sent the messenger I am the god of that Covenant and I am still alive today if it's not it's theology it's dead religion I told you this morning I ain't a popular preacher and I ain't afraid to speak the truth but God must become real to you tonight God must become real to every young person we got a generation that's coming now the devil's sweeping and taking confusing the minds and it's not going to be mama and daddy that stabilizes a ship it's going to be your prayer but it's going to be God himself stepping down into young hearts it says no I am still that same God I am the god of Elijah and you can stand when the whole world turns if everybody walks away from the message I'm going to have one young person that's going to stand and say I believe why because it won't be you that's doing the believing anymore it won't be you that's doing the believing anymore see when God became a reality to me I knew that at that point there was nothing that was possible nothing that was impossible where I wanted to see God I've seen him everywhere at that point I'm just going to give you testimony and I'm getting relieved I ain't talking about Tim but I'm talking about a man who struggled to know listen I believe Doctrine but I had no overcoming power I know coming over power over lust over pornography over other Devils that come in on my life it gave me no power when I said I believe God sent a prophet the devil laughed at me he said I do too he cast Me In Hell many times are you with me he wasn't afraid of Peter when Peter had been with Jesus but when Peter had the same God inside of him that Jesus did that was a completely different story are you with me God is giving you a commission not just to believe a message but to believe the god of the message to take him off the pages of the Bible and make him a living reality to you not just to say oh that was a good thought thank you Lord and go home and fight are you with me you're going to fight either way but if you'll let him you put some in your hand and you'll be able to pull the sword to say you know what I don't care what Devil's come I have not been given a spirit of fear but of power and of a sound mind and of love and you've given you the spirit the sword of the spirit to be able to cut the Devils you know sometimes who I'd rather have pray for me than I would an older person a young person you know why because they don't know anything but believe they ain't they don't have baggage they ain't been through doctrinal battles they ain't had scars they just know how to believe why because God is the reality to them Joshua didn't get hung up I would imagine him walking down he say it ain't gonna be too much longer we're going to take over now I know you've heard a lot of stuff we're going to cross over but now you need to let all that stuff go just know that we've been called to take the land you ain't been called to just believe a message you've been called to become the message you've been called for the message to take on a body of Flesh Jesus Christ is come not has 10 or will but is come present tense in the flesh see I know what it's like to not know who he was but now I know him in the power of his resurrection to a point that when the doctrine Medical Science tell you well your babies you little girl she's got down syndrome and this is going to be the problem that's going to be the problem and in the instant something inside says I refuse are you with me oh if that happened to me six seven years before that being like well I guess this is what it is no but God has not called you to just believe that's the first step but God has called you to an action when the doctor says well she's going to have the operation on her heart because she's got a hole in her heart I refuse to accept it you know why because he wasn't a figment anymore he was a reality to me and I knew that there was nothing that I've asked him that he would not do you realize that if he's that real to you and you ask him he said I will do it I will do what he says there is nothing that he can what we do sometimes we get our eyes on the preacher with a gift oh that preacher will pray for me but what about your prayer what about your prayer you you can enter into her infirmity better than I can you are about the same age you understand what I'm saying you got the same struggles the same troubles you see what I'm saying this isn't just contained to a preacher anymore it ain't contained to Abyss it can't contain to a prophet but it's to go out to the whole body so that it can calm the reality of the Flesh of God one more time your daughter's got a hole in her heart she'll have to have surgery I said I don't believe it well we can show you the exercise I don't care what the X-ray says my God said if I would ask him you know what I am crazy enough to believe that I might be the first individual in the world that God will rewrite the genetics of a child oh I can't believe that I'm going to take a body change and be changed in a moment of Twinkle and I and I can't believe that God can rewrite genetics come on now foreign you know I I when she was first born eight years ago I was on my way up here to Ohio to another church to preach and I got to call your daughters have to be transferred to Charlotte she's got this problem this problem you know what I did brother I turned my van around and I cleaned out my seat the drought the passenger side and I said Lord would you come and ride with me back to Charlotte he's not a figment Lord would you come and ride there was a being that come and sit down inside my beside my chair you know when I began to sing I felt this prison I feel the pull that's one of my face that song was written for me I began to sing that and that presence came and sat in my car and he spoke to me he said because of your faith oh it was a struggle to believe because of what medical science was telling me listen brother Tim ain't nothing special I'm trying to tell you each one of you that this God is just this real he said because of your faith I have healed your daughter from Down syndrome you know what when they say this somebody out on the street does she have Downstream I said well the doctor said she did Tim ain't confessing it because I'm calling because I know him now he's not a figment he's not tied back into brother Branham anymore are you with me but he's present tense right here right now this is what's been missing a long time we put him in the preachers we put him off somewhere else but I want to bring him down to your door tonight I want you to understand that this God my God your God is alive today I don't have to accept you don't have to accept what he's trying to do to you tonight maybe you've got the Holy Ghost and you've had it for a while now and he's trying to tell you you don't got it you can't make it and you've believed that lie and you're struggling I've seen people that has it for years and they don't act like it well I ain't worthy enough who is see I'll take the word and turn it back on the devil I know I ain't you telling you telling me that I ain't work don't you think I already know that but he said that Bob that's a reality said I have taken your unrighteousness and I have clothed you with my righteousness so devil you don't get to stay around here anymore are you with me we let him play too much we let him play in our lives we let him play in our mind we don't have to we've been a commission to take the word watch how real it had become to Joshua I'm getting ready to close watch how real it'll become to him he had never seen God but he knew his voice and one day under the commission he was under such an anointing he seen a man standing over with a sword drawn he's like uh I'm under commission to do this and he walked over to him it was so real to him that he was willing to fight anything that got in his path even God himself are you for us are you against us he said oh Joshua I'm the one that spoke to you I'm the one that gave you the commission this job's a little bit too big for you see when you face a job that's a little too big God says take your shoes off let me get the job done he's the best friend that you'll ever have he'll never forsake you he'll never turn his back on you David said when my mother and my father have forsaken me he said the Lord will take me up learn the message listen to it for yourself not second-handed listen to it for yourself but know the giver of the message first that will answer all of your questions God is called each and every one of you young people he's given you a commission to take the land oh sometimes I envy y'all I wish I could be your age coming up and just know God and not have to fight through as much stuff as I've had to fight through to believe but it's made me who I am today it's made me to know him in the power of his resurrection to know that the God that was with the prophet brother is with me how can you say that how can I not say it that means the same God that was with the prophet will also be with you even in you to the end of the world see we don't get to separate this message from the scriptures when you do we begin to make it say something it did not say and it creates confusion but to know him he is the revealer of all truth he is the one that brings the clarity to you well should I or shouldn't I well I got to find a quote whether I should or shouldn't really if you know him you don't need a scripture verse and you don't need a quote he will tell you God not do that shhh can I ask you a question what quotes and what scriptures did Abraham have he just had a one-on-one conversation with god just like this God has such confidence in him he said shall I hide anything from Abraham we're seeds of Abraham we're supposed to have that same one-on-one relationship the same commission that Joshua had well what I might have carried brother Tim the truth in a body of Flesh again so that Christ can manifest himself and whatever desire he wants to in whatever way he wants to I'm glad that some of y'all don't have to detox but if you don't know him this evening if you don't know that God that I'm talking about I want to introduce you to him I want to give you the opportunity to say I want that God I want the god of Joshua I want the god of the Prophet I want the god of brother Brown I want the god of Brothers him I had to believe it for myself and now when I listen to the message I hear other stuff I'm like that's that's an uncertain sound you know why because the one who gave it to me is on the inside directing my path bringing me to the place to where I need to be let's bow our heads Lord Jesus as a musician comes father we have testified of you of your power of your glory and of your grace oh God I thought about when brother Paul read that scripture this morning Psalm 78 of uttering the dark sayings of old God how I had slipped from one generation to the next and they had didn't even know you in a deep down just like the woman at the well didn't know who she knew that when the Messiah would come she had this historical understanding she had some reference of who you were and what you were to do but when you said I am he it was a very personal commission to her she said Oh Come See this man who's told me all I've ever done Lord if one tonight does not know you in the way that I'm speaking Lord may they come to know you tonight may they just say Lord I'm willing to lay everything aside younger old and I need to know you that way I believe the message I believe the prophet but I need to know the god of it all would you grant it to us tonight father granted Lord [Music] Hallelujah yes Lord Jesus in Jesus name we ask you I want
