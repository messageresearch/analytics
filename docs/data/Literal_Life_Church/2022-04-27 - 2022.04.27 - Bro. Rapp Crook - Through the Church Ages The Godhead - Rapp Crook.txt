========================================

um the deity of jesus christ is front and center it is very very very clear jesus christ is god and also there is only one god now sometimes you might get jehovah's witnesses coming by your door from time to time and i was in holland somehow we got on their network and we had three or four different times and i welcomed them in we had nice conversations and it's difficult talking to them because they have a different bible so they'll try to make a point and they'll give you a verse and they look it up in their bible and it's different than the verse that you're that you're thinking of but it was really interesting revelation chapter one was one that they weren't able to really get around it shows jesus christ is god very very clearly anyhow john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which which was and is to come this is jesus christ jesus christ he was a prophet he was he came in flesh and he came to deuteronomy 18 15 says that the lord will raise up a prophet like unto me that was jesus and he which is right now jesus christ is now our high priest or intercessor in heaven and who is he he is also to come he's a coming king so we've got three offices right there and just had jesus christ reveals himself he revealed himself as a son of man as a prophet on earth he's her intercessor a high priest in heaven he's a coming king but how many jesus are there there's just one so a multiplicity of offices doesn't make a multiplicity of personalities so greetings from him which is which was is to come and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of then if we skip on over to verse eight let's get down to verse eight it's beautiful the titles the characteristics that are being highlighted about jesus i am alpha and omega the first and last letters of the greek alphabet the beginning and the ending set the lord which which one to talk about he which is was and is to come jesus and the almighty is also ascribed to him these are characteristics that in the old testament are very clearly speaking about jehovah isaiah 44 6 thus saith jehovah the king of israel his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first i am the last beside me there is no god there's no god beside me first and last says the same thing pretty much in isaiah 48 12. and we look in revelation chapter 1 and there's no difficulty saying who this is i'm alpha and omega first last jesus christ there's just one god it is jesus christ god revealed in flesh not the second person third person it is god in flesh going back and john is hearing this voice and but he's not really seeing anyone then he turns around and he turns to see the voice they spake with him he turns he sees seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks he sees one like unto the son of man god reveals himself to john the number where is john right now he's in prison he's he's he's in exile rather on the isle of patmos this isn't the vacation destination he is that he's he's he's he's he's in a bad case he's a bad state and when we're in a bad state we need god to reveal himself to us in the way that we can perceive him in the way that we know god and jesus appeared to john in the way that john would recognize him he sees him one like unto the son of man and that's how god god comes to us in a way that we can perceive him and know him noticing john's in trouble jesus comes to him there and at the end of the chapter again when i saw him i fell out his feet as dead john writes and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first i am the last he that liveth was dead i am alive forevermore those two scriptures unite the old and new testaments beautifully i'm the first and the last we heard about that in isaiah i'm he that liveth was dead alive forevermore i'm the one who was both of these things not two different people i am i am he and he says that really really beautifully now when i um when i look at this um growing up and uh um every wednesday night brother would be uh would be teaching and we heard lots and lots of teaching on the goddess which i'm thankful um but when you're going through the teaching at times like why why are we hearing another service on the goddard as you're cutting your teeth on the church pew why another certain what what's the big deal and that's kind of an answer what's the big deal question why are we doing another service on the godhead why is the doctrine of the godhead so important that brother branham preaches about it again and again and again and again just goes on and on about it why and i think this is a you could there be other answers that you could give these are three that i just want to offer i believe that the doctrine of the godhead as scripturally truly teaches it gives us really beautiful insight into god's heart if we don't really see who god is it's hard to see god's love for us what god's doing here it's um i understand growing up in the in the baptist church school i can remember a chapel service and the minister finishes his service and he takes questions he opens up for questions and one of the girls raises up her question asks a question i'd never really thought of asking but raised in the trinitarian background she asks who should i pray to should i pray to the father should i pray to the son who should i pray to isn't that just like the devil who wants to try to create all kinds of confusion and noise so we don't even know where to offer our prayers i was listening sometime back on saturday and they've got adventures in odyssey in the morning i'm still going to introduce an odyssey listener and you've got another another program another program and finally there's this moody broadcasting network a jewish christian who takes all kinds of questions to the bible and i listen to him from time to time but he got a call on question about the trinity and wondering about it and he answered the question with a with a metaphor i had never heard before he said comparing the trinity to trying to build a house who is it that builds the house you have you have an architect who draws up the plans and then you have but does the architect really build the house no the a contractor bids on and the contractor starts getting things going and then does but does the contractor really put much together in the house no so he says like the architect he says that's kind of like god the father and then the contractor that's kind of like god the son but the contractor doesn't really do the hammering of things like that that's left to god the holy spirit he compared the holy spirit to the power drill who's putting everything together you think listen that's that's not the picture of god that's there in the bible it's it's it creates it makes even things even more confusing so the devil tries to create confusion so we don't have clear insight into god's heart but i believe that the doctrine of the god that as it's as it truly is intended gives us the drama of god's plan it's not dry it's dramatic it's showing how god is descending from heaven coming all the way down to earth revealing himself making us making himself knowable to us it's a dramatic plan and has truly intended that's what it's bringing across and lastly the doctrine of the god that as it's truly taught in the bible shows clearly what the believer's position is but if if we don't really know who the son of god is it's hard to know who we are as sons and daughters of god so i think it is important and worthwhile spending some time on we just pray the lord will help us make it clearer and not any more confusing but on on page one of our notes i think it's interesting how brother branham says in the in the church age book this is on the paragraph 29 of the new edition how his the spirit of god in john expresses thusly in revelation 1 in order to set forth the supreme deity of jesus christ and to reveal the godhead as one god today there's a gross error that there are three gods instead of one but this revelation is given to john by jesus himself corrects that error the next part that's bold-faced this mighty revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day along with the correct baptismal formula of water baptism this is something that was supposed to be restored in the last days and if you look at revelation 10 7 it says the mystery of god should be finished and that's part of why we're able to see this this truth in about about the godhead now looking at what's the big deal how we see into god's heart if you look at the bottom of page one um in the message of revelation of jesus christ here the first part of the series brother brennan at the end of the message is starting to teach about um the story of joseph we talked about that some last month he's getting into the story of joseph he's talking about this detail on that detail and then the holy spirit completely interrupts his illustration and if you and at the bottom of page one he's telling about how joseph was what was in prison just like jesus was in prison one was saved on the thief on the cross the other one was lost etc that was taken off the cross and on top of page two and then look here in the beginning when adam said i just can't get away from that seems like somebody's not getting it somewhere look so he's completely stopping his illustration of joseph because he somebody's not getting it somewhere and there's something that can that should be gotten that god really wants us to get so he's completely interrupting the flow of this illustration to give this let me show you something again the holy spirit warns me to do this i'm leaving my subject for a minute when the first news came to glory that the son had been lost adam did god send an angel did he save the son did he send anyone else no he came himself to redeem his lost son he sweeps down to eden adam adam where are you where are you he wants to find adam he's not sending this to anybody else god himself comes down and here you see the heart of god whereas we don't have to have some discussion which person of the godhead is going down we don't have to have because it's not that's not part of it god comes himself with because that's his heart redemption he didn't trust it to anyone but himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed man himself and we see the heart of god very clearly revealed there and as we look at the godhead we we have to it takes quite a bit of humility because we're talking about something completely out of our dimension and out of our out of our understanding and i just like to use the illustration of a bird watcher a bird lover and here you got this beautiful eagle who loves the bird the most you got bird lovers out there the bird watchers love the ornithologists love watching them with the binoculars but you have another group of people who love the birds and that's the the taxidermist but which one loves the bird the best the taxidermist will get that bird and he'll cut that bird open and he'll be able to tell you exactly where its heart is exactly where its liver is exactly everything works on the inside how the wings work all these things he'll be able to explain it to you in excruciating detail but in order to do that he has to kill the bird and i just wonder sometimes at 3 325 a.d in the council of nicaea was there such a desire to explain god perfectly to the nth degree exactly how does god how does this work how does this work how does this work were they not just kind of trying to put god on the operating table cut them open explain this this this as they try to over explain god they almost kill his effect upon them so the best way of learning about god is like this bird watcher watching god we learn the most about god when we just look to him and let him reveal himself to us on his own so it is not intellectual um uh intellectual um chicken-heartedness to put a question on the shelf about god because sometimes that just takes the humility that we really need to see lord would you reveal this to me in your time because if i try to explain it i'll make a bigger mess of it anyhow another part of it i like is talking about explaining things here we have an early model of the atom you can see here's the here's the neutron in the middle with the nucleus and the proton there and you can see exactly in this model where each of those electrons is right there right there there's three of them you can see exactly where they are and this is a beautiful model you'll see it still in some textbooks but this is not how it really works if you put you look under an electron microscope you're going to see this because those electrons move so fast it defies photography divides anything all you will see is a cloud you can't define god and say god is here here here you can't do that you can't do that with the electron either you just have to sit back and say god works i'm going to watch him work i'm just going to let him show himself to me as he wishes and that's appropriate humility there for a believer now in the old testament there's a warning about making models except the old testament word isn't modeled the old testament word is image the old testament says thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image and here you have an image of the or a model of the godhead that was formed probably a couple out close to two thousand years ago um saying that god's like a triangle and there are three vertices on the triangle father son holy spirit but they're all one god but there are three vertices and each vertex is unique they're they're not the same they're they're separate and i would say that this is like an image of god that's been created and if we're not careful we can worship the image that we set up and and let that will replace the real god himself and this example kind and i just want to take a look um at the scriptures and see how what they have to say about each one of these vertices that has been separated here on the triangle but this image of god is not based on scripture it's based actually on greek philosophy and i would just say if we want to have a model about god it needs to begin with the assumption that god begins with hero israel the lord our god is one lord and that's how we should begin let's just take a look at the questions about the father is not the holy spirit well matthew 1 18 says mary was found with child of the holy ghost yet this model clearly trying to clearly say purports to say that these two are separate but matthew says no mary was found with child of the holy ghost and in the book of ephesians paul writes there is one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all hold up i thought the holy ghost came and lived inside me that was but here paul's saying the father is above all through all and in you all so i think this separation of two different virtues and these aren't the same i think that's a serious question there it doesn't hold up to scriptural uh inspection if you look at the top of the triangle or the the father is not the son according to this model isaiah 9 6 speaking of the messiah says his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father well how can you make sense of this if you believe that you've got the son and the father whereas the son is going to be called the father but that's what the scripture says and then jesus says in john 14 he that hath seen me have seen the father and it's the father that dwells in me that does the works that's right separating like this doesn't doesn't work even more strongly in john 10 30 jesus says i and my father are one so we don't i don't think this holds up to scriptural scrutiny john looking at this the son different from the holy spirit well john in john 14 18 jesus says that he's preparing to leave he's having last conversation with the disciples says i won't leave you comfortless i will come to you i will come to you not somebody different i will come to you just like when adam was in trouble and i lived there at eden god himself came to them same thing here and it gets even more exciting if you look at the book of acts after the holy spirit has fallen there on the day of pentecost and then saul of tarsus is going up to damascus to continue his persecution and it says here he's uh he's spitting off his high horse as the pillar of fire comes down and and blinds him and speaks to him and says saul saul why persecutest thou me i am jesus well did saul with saul stan we don't know if saul was standing at the cross or not we don't know i'm going to assume he wasn't he might have been we don't know but he wasn't persecuting jesus his body lit his physical nail with with the nail holes and the wound in the side he wasn't persecuting that body but he was persecuting the body that the spirit of jesus the spirit of christ was in and as he's going and beating believers and throwing them into prison jesus says you're persecuting me because they're filled with his with with with the holy spirit all these things kind of show that this this triangle geometric model doesn't really hold up doesn't fit in the church age book brother branham says real clearly it's a beautiful statement the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new testament god revealed himself in the old testament in one way he reveals himself further in the new testament is jesus and all jesus means is jehovah savior it's another way of god revealing himself amen this um it was funny we talked about how the trinity gets put into christian school textbooks all over the place i was teaching geometry a couple years ago as we're going on to the chapter about triangles at the end of the section there's this beautiful triangle with that model i just showed you explaining and the doctrine and the study of triangles is another beautiful example of the doctrine of the trinity et cetera et cetera et cetera everybody's reading this i've got to do something about this right now we have to talk about it and earlier we had kind of had a conversation now if you have a polygon which is just a figure with sides that are connected a triangle is a polygon what happens if you add one side to a triangle you get a square if you add a side to a square you get a pentagon you have to side to a pentagon you get a hexagon then heptagon octagon decagon we'll stop there let's just see what happens as you do that square pentagon all the way up if you keep on adding sides what shape do you eventually get to a circle if you have a god with an infinite number of attributes you don't have a triangle anymore you have a circle i just ask if we have to have a geometric model which one's better a one god with an infinite number of attributes or the fathers not the sons not the holy ghost yet somehow is still one god which model is actually the best at expressing god's unity and his eternality i think the circle's a beautiful expression of it if we have to have a model so kind of looking at again what's the uh what's the big deal we talked about how it shows god's heart as he comes down from heaven to eden himself not not delegating it to anybody else but then looking at now the drama of god's plan first timothy 6 16 shows one of the major problems that the doctrine of the god had i say it very academic one of the major problems that god himself wants to solve that he is not knowable by simple human beings it says god dwells in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see if it's left up to us we cannot get close to god we can't even see god it's an insurmountable problem for us but god loves us so much he wants to be knowable by us so he bridges this dimensional gap so that we can know him and the only way that something that's invisible can be knowable by us is by putting on a jacket by putting on a suit of clothes all of a sudden the h.g wells wrote a book about the invisible man and the invisible man's walking around he's cold but he can't nobody can see him but he goes and puts the invisible man puts on a jacket then he's got this problem people see the jacket but nothing else but he's warmer well god puts on a jacket he puts on clothes he he hides himself that's the only way that an invisible being can be seen and that's what god does throughout the entire old testament isaiah 45 15 says verily you are a god that hides thyself o god of israel the savior we read this the first one we think why does god hide himself it's not the idea of god playing hide and seek with us but if god didn't hide himself he couldn't be found by us either that's the fun part of hide and seek right getting found and finding the person well god does that he hides himself under a skin otherwise we have no hope of ever seeing him and i love this quote from the message identified christ of all ages the express is just so clearly the heart of god the whole purpose of the matter brother branham says so you see the whole thing is god becoming tangible that is the whole story of scripture tangible just means touchable god in john first john 1 1 says that which is from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen mature with our eyes which we have handled of the word of life god wanted to become visible audible tangible to us so that we could know him and we're just like little kids little kids they want to know you they're not going to be they don't want a distant relationship they want to come and wrestle with you they want it it's show and tell feel but they want to know you that's how god came to us he wanted to know us and us to know him that much the whole thing is god becoming tangible on the great day that's to come i have the quote middle of page three when christ sets upon the throne of david reigns in the millennium it's god tangible in the earth and then he is now in you you are his attributes you were in god's thinking now and you're just materialized god wanted to be tangible in jesus christ and he still wants to be tangible and that's what god was when he materialized in christ god displayed manifest in flesh in christ he became material god that we could touch god knows that little kids learn best by hands-on and he knows that human beings learn best about him by being he's a hands-on god he wants us to be hands-on with him as well that's what that's what this that's what the doctrine is all about that is god's heart to become tangible because you know what when we when god isn't tangible to us and we don't see god in our trials but we can't perceive god anywhere around us we get nervous don't we i don't know where god is where is guy i'm freaking out i don't know where god is that things are falling apart i need god and that's how job felt in the middle of his trial behold i go forward but he's not there i look behind me i go backward but i can't perceive him on the left hand where he does work i cannot behold him he hides himself on the right hand i can't see him and job is trying in the midst of his trial to be strong so yes i've known my redeemer liveth but god i just need to see you and finally in the book of job at the very end god comes down he comes down he hides himself in the whirlwind why does he hide himself in the world because god has to come on the form because he's invisible if he didn't come on the form he wouldn't be visible he comes down in the whirlwind the lord answered job out of the whirlwind where was god he was in that whirlwind that whirlwind was hiding god like isaiah said thou art a god that hides thyself oh god of israel the savior god hid himself in that whirlwind so that he could comfort job where is god hiding himself today he might think where is god where is god well god's not hiding so that we can't find him he's hiding so that he we can be found of him it's completely reverse of how we usually think of it but that's how it works then we have in the book of exodus when the children of israel are leaving are leaving egypt and they're wanting to find out where god is also exodus 13 21 the lord went before them by day in a pillar of clouds where was he he was in the pillar of cloud he was in the fire if it hadn't been for the cloud on the fire they wouldn't have seen him they needed something to see so they could follow it but also to be a reassurance god's with me and then in exodus 14 is the as the as pharaoh's egyptians the chariots are rushing upon them they're between the egyptians and the red sea the rock and the hard place as it were and and then the god comes in the pillar of fire and is between them and the egyptians and the morning watch the lord looked under the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud where was god he was hiding himself there not to be mysterious but to be visible to be visible amen amen and throughout the old testament there are so many examples like this in the old testament i'm just going to hit on a couple of them otherwise it just becomes really long and don't be needlessly long here but there are many times in the old testament where god appears to somebody and talks about the angel of the lord appears to them and who is the angel of the lord here i want to take a look in judges chapter 6. when god appears to someone as the angel of the lord he's taking on some kind of a human form because when he comes as the angel of the lord most of the time the person doesn't realize that they're talking to a supernatural being only later does god show that to them but um when this angel had gideon's there threshing wheat and it says there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which wasn't ophra what kind of angel is this a normal human being who that's always appearing who just sits under the tree and is resting and watching it starts out saying verse 11 there came an angel of the lord but as the story unfolds verse 11 says the lord looked upon gideon and said well inside this we don't see this but this angel is hiding the invisible god within him so god the invisible god is looking through the eyes of this human form is described as the angel of the lord and speaks to gideon verse 16 the lord said unto gideon how the lord is revealing himself through this human form this messenger of the lord the angel of the lord says surely i will be with thee that's how god is revealing himself to getting he's taking on this form and it kind of shows you how does god what kind of form does god use throughout the old testament the most to unveil himself to humans he does come as a whirlwind in the book of job he comes as a pillar of fire in the cloud in the book of genesis or a book of exodus a couple different ways but the way that is most frequently used is in some kind of human form that for that show us something about the heart of god what's god's great desire is he wants to unveil himself reveal himself and the human form it gets closer and as we go through the old testament gets closer and closer he's unveiling more and more throughout to the angel of the lord the prophets till finally a sinless baby is born through a virgin birth and god can completely reveal himself there so all these human manifestations of god these theophanies these bodies for a spirit all these in the old testament are just foreshadowing leading up to god's the high point of his drama where he can be revealed in a human flesh-born child and finally that's only making way for the rest of god's drama where he can be unfolded and revealed in all of his children it's a it's not it's not dry it's not academic this is the heart of god so he can be in us through us living through us revealing himself through us i want to show one let's take a look at judges chapter 13. i think it's just interest i don't have this on the screens this is when um the angel of the lord comes to sampson's mother mrs manoah i'm just going to hit a couple verses judges 13 3 it says the angel of the lord appeared to the woman and we're going to be kind of asking the question who's appearing here who is coming to her verse 6 the woman comes and tells her husband saying a man of god came unto me she doesn't realize it's an angel she says the man of god coming to her and then manoa wants to see who it is he wants to meet her yeah i have just as good a right here from this angel his message affects me like it affects you i want to see him too in verse 10 the angel of the lord came again in verse 10 the woman made haste and ran and showed her husband said unto behold the man has appeared to me who came to me the other day he says the man appeared who came the other day who is she there's confusion about who this person is and if we think about if there's sometimes confusion about who how god revealed himself to us through brother branham well that kind of goes with the territory sometimes when the angel of the lord comes and moves we see it right here so verse 10 the man hath appeared unto me and then verse 16 the angel of the lord says to manoah don't don't stop me don't keep me from going i'm not going to eat your bread if you want to offer up or an offering just offer it to the lord for which is a great point of irony offer to the lord when this is the angel of the lord god revealing through human flesh and it says for noah didn't know he was an angel of the lord he didn't know but god was revealing himself in the form so that they could be known so that he could be known of them and then finally verse 21 after the angel goes up in fire from the altar it says the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoa unto his wife and then then manoa knew he was an angel of the lord and he said to his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god so in this one short story we go from angel of the lord man of god a man to angel lord again to god but god is hiding himself so that he can reveal himself because if god doesn't hide himself an invisible being can't be seen so again throughout the old testament there is a multitude of ways that god reveals himself he comes to joshua as the captain of the host this was a a human form but joshua bows down and worships this form and he's not stopped and said he doesn't he's not stopped and told you can't do this um you shouldn't worship anybody but god this is the captain of the host is hiding god then that rock was christ when that rock is smitten provides water burst out that's god taking on a form that wasn't no simple rock it was god hiding itself there melchizedek a man who wrestled with jacob all these ways are ways that god revealed himself hid himself so that he could reveal himself this is the unveiling of god brother brennan has a sermon by that title but that captures the whole theme of scripture that captures the drama of god's plan it says like he was in moses when the word was in moses he was god in flesh and it was in jesus it was god in the flesh the only thing he did was change his mask mother's word not his nature just his mask he's the same yesterday forever he only changed his form he changed from noah to moses moses to david david on down till they come into the fullness of the godhead bodily in jesus christ but it's still the same god he just takes on another veil he puts on another veil he's still doing that today he's taking on the veil with each one of your names that's how god is veiling himself because he's still a god that cannot be approached unto you that cannot be seen by human eye but he wants to be seen he wants to be known and jesus of nazareth isn't walking the earth right now but his spirit is in human form again so that our colleagues or their fellow students or their teachers they can know god also that is the that is the drama of it continues this is quoting from ephesians chapter three oh god poured himself into christ not another person the one out of him called the holy spirit it was he himself he poured himself into the people christ in you how beautiful wonderful to think god pouring himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was a part of the drama to do that so the whole purpose of god to be veiled in human flesh amen so all the fullness of the godhead bodily brother branham says was in this person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person will we put them into persons like that we're limiting god it's not one two first second third person it is the person god veiled in human flesh and why does he do this so that he is the invisible god from a completely different dimension can come and be known by us now the recently in the last year um facebook changed names didn't they they became meta which is short for the the metaverse which is like this other this other world it's a virtual world right well in order to be seen in a virtual world you have to take on a virtual body in order to be in that virtual body ironically i think it's called a skin what skin do you use in the metaverse well you can even my uh my my son likes to play on the little minecraft world sometimes i know when you're on minecraft you can go into your settings and you can choose out what skin you want and there are different different skins that somebody could choose for their minecraft be on this different world and you go but you have that you have the you have the player behind the console is that player behind the console different than that little skinned a little guy that's walking around no it's just an extension of them it's an image of them so that anybody else is in that metaverse can see him if he didn't have the skin then you wouldn't be able to see who he was in the metaverse and likewise you can change skins as you're going through the game you can just take on a different skin does that mean that just because it's because uh somebody takes on a different solid one takes on a different skin all of a sudden we've got two or three solomons running around the world no just an extension he's revealing himself with some with with another skin trying out what it's like to be in somebody else's skin in the metaverse today but that's the only reason why so what's the purpose of the skin so that somebody else who's in this imaginary world can know you and the example kind of works because god is god's in a different dimension that's unknowable to us so in order for he comes into our world and has to take on a skin so that we can know him just like if like our world is so much better than any kind of minecraft world but we love the minecraft world so much that we want to reveal ourselves to this minecraft world to other players are in there because we think it's so special so we take on the skin and jump into the minecraft where the other players can get to know us and like what condescension who would want to have screen time when there's this great world out here but that's the same kind of condescension when god left his world heaven to come down to our world i mean a screen it's so limiting so two-dimensional but we want to throw ourselves into this screen with a skin so that we can be known here but that's what god did with this heaven he's coming down to put himself box himself in it would be like but he loves the people in the screen world so much he'll take on the skin but we can't say that the skin is something different than god no not at all we can't say that the skin is somebody different than the player no it's just an image of the player how the player is revealing himself but it's one player the whole time it's one god the whole time amen praise the lord here we have it without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh god took on a skin so that we in this universe could see him god was manifest in the flesh great is the mystery of godliness there's no controversy about it but the truth is it's just god manifesting himself in flesh why so that he could be knowable by us and on page five i've got a number of scriptures to kind of go through this i'm just going to go through them quickly but in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh why it dwelt among us so that we could know him first john 1 1 so that our hands could handle him so we could see him with their eyes our ears could hear him so we could know him god was manifest in the flesh it says god was in christ in second corinthians 5 19. john 1 18 says no man have seen god at any time because we can't see god that's the problem that's the problem that we can't surmount but god does he comes in the skin so that we can see him and have a relationship with him jesus christ is the image of the invisible god and then the hebrew says he's the express image of god's person and i would say that's the drama god reeling himself in christ but it just continues as he still wants to reveal himself in skin and here it talks about we want to talk about how the true understanding of the story of scripture i think the doctrine of the god dead if we talk like it like that it's uh it's academic it's the best way to say it's the story of scripture how god revealed it's the story of scripture it's not the doctrine of the god that it's the story of scripture that's what it is job chapter 10 and verse 11 all of this is god hiding himself and where now thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh you offensed me with bones and sinews who's the me here you look in the mirror nothing of what you see in the mirror is you we spent a lot of time on it but that's not you the real you is that soul inside of you and the best part is when god comes down the same god that revealed himself throughout the old testament different ways in different human forms takes a portion of that it has all the same properties and puts in our soul and then who's the real me well it's clothed in your skin and your flesh so that people can have come in contact with it amen praise the lord colossians 1 27 it's christ in you hope of glory christ wants to be unveiled in your skin now first corinthians 3 know you not that you are the temple of god god's dwelling in you so that people can what you do in the temple you you come into contact with god you worship god well you're the temple of god so the people can come into contact with god but you're not the focus god's the focus that's why if we lose track of who we are and we just kind of and we have an experience with god but then we kind of slide away and start identifying ourselves with god both we're identified more with our profession or with our hobbies but we're we're losing track of who we are we're we want god's inside of us we're the temple of god the point of us being here on earth is that people can come in contact with god not that we can have the best car the best house highest salary so that people can come in contact with god second corinthians 6 16 again paul says what agreement at the temple of god with idols you're the temple of god what are you doing hanging around with places where the temple of god shouldn't be you are the temple of the living god amen how was man created in the beginning he was created in god's image god created man in his own image unfortunately man fell but god is restoring man again to be the image of god who was jesus christ he was the express image of god and that is what god wants to restore us so that we could also be the image of god romans 8 29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that's what we were that's what adam was created to be he was created in god's image and we're still image bearers of god but because of sin the image has been twisted the image has been broken in some to some extent but we're predestinated to be conformed to the image of god god is putting the image of god back together again on earth so that again he can overcome this problem that no man has seen god at any time it's interesting that phrase no man has seen god at any time comes up twice in the bible once in the book of john and that's referring to jesus no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son he hath declared him and in the first john john brings us up again the problem no man seeing god at any time but if we love one another god dwelleth in us his love is perfected in us if we love one another god's image can again be seen by the world he's again trying to tackle that problem god wants to make himself tangible and as the body of christ loves god loves one another then it's the image of god again that people can see who god is and come into contact with him and then this understanding of the story of god god wanting to come into us helps make this one scripture that we read every time for the communion service makes sense it says he that eateth and drinketh of the communion supper unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body not deserving the lord's body that we that we are a part of god's body that we are the temple of the living god that's what this is talking about not deserving the lord's body that we're a part of it and yet we're living a lie we can't do that for the temple of living god we conduct ourselves as a temple of god we live or live as a temple of god because we understand where the lord's body is that god is embodying himself in us and brother branham talks about this briefly in the communion message in the middle there of page six kind of at the end he quotes at the end of that paragraph 7 he says he quotes what the scripture he that eateth and drinketh on the earthly eats and drinks damnation to himself not deserting the lord's body the discernment of knowing that you are the lord's body that god is hiding himself and you and you can't and you and you can't see it you're not identifying yourself as that in wickedness and sin we've got to be above that we discern that the lord is righteous we discern he's our propitiation that all of our sins we've confessed and we believe in him of waiting upon this atom to cleanse us from all of our iniquity then we're deserting the lord's body we're deserting what the lord's body is for and then discerning again that in among us as the lord's bride body that there's anything wrong with us in here that would hinder the gospel from growing or the lord from presenting us before god's a chaste virgin let's discern that out right now and find out if it's wrong i think it's interesting he says two things there about the lord's body the first part of the quote talk what's the lord's body for he's not saying that we're once we've got the holy ghost that we're living sinless lives and if we ever make a mistake we're not deserting the body of the lord and we're written off the first part says we discern the lord's body what it's there for why it hung on the cross for us he's the blood the propitiation of our sins all of our sins that we've confessed he's cleansed us from our our iniquity we discern what it's for that keeps us clean but the second part again shows wow if we've been cleansed by the blood of the lamb if we've been cleansed by the washing of the water of the word then we can be the we're just a skin through which god can reveal himself i just pray that i can be as translucent a skin as possible the god's spirit can be seen clearly through me and that's that second part that we are the lord's bride body we've been washed in the blood so we can't be the god can reveal himself to the world through us amen so the true doctrine of the god it's again i don't even like the the term or phrase it's the story of god that's what it is it shows the position of the believer it shows the position of the believer as to how god is now making himself flesh now making himself knowable to mankind and if we looked at the last uh last our our last service we talked about revelation how the satan hates revelation he really hates this revelation because it disrupts all of these plans if you see who you really are in christ you'll be an invincible army the gates of hell can't prevail against you the devil hates this kind of revelation which is why which is why he creates this confusion about who god is who the son of god is who you are so that we really don't even know someone that might know who should i even pray to he makes the christian powerless by doing that but god has shown in this last day he is the mystery of god should be finished and by god's grace this revelation has been restored and we can live a victorious christian life and i'm just going to we'll we'll we'll close right here but brother brandon finishes this section of on the godhead in this first chapter of the church age book the transitions right into talking about water baptism well why on earth if we're supposed to eat and drink in jesus name because we're supposed to pray in jesus name cast out devils in jesus name do everything in jesus name why on earth all of a sudden would we be asked to well when you baptize make sure you baptize the name of the father son holy ghost it doesn't fit but he's trying to break off that connection between the bride and the groom because that's where we get our identity from taking the groom's name and that a wrong doctrine of baptism is trying to break that connection he's trying to take the prevent the bride from getting the groom's name and make that understanding so much harder to see trying to divorce from divorces from our from our source of power i'm just thankful that god has uh has given this uh revelation and like i said i i understand i grew up in a in a little little baptist church school somewhere and you get questions sometimes and if you have questions i i didn't touch on you still got questions sometimes i'm not going to look at you say what did you not believe what i said are you an unbeliever don't you believe i'm not going to say that because questions are absolutely normal i'm happy if you have a question i'm very happy to take him i might say i don't know because it's better i don't know than give the wrong answer but we'll just pray if you have questions that god will reveal himself closer and closer to each one amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you very much for your goodness and grace to us lord now lord you're a god in the in the simple things lord i thank you that you desired a relationship with us so much that you left your limitless world in eternity to become bound in this in the human body of jesus of nazareth lord that we could know you and lord i pray that you would draw us into a closer relationship with you father lord i pray that there are ones who haven't received of you or desire a filling of your holy spirit so that you might float through them even more like i pray you to answer that and lord pray if there are questions one way or the other lord if i said something wrong i prayed forgive me just pray will you make all things clear father i pray to answer each question and it's time oh lord we thank you in jesus name amen amen um can we sing the same god who spoke to the woman at the well the same god and i don't remember the words after that but i know that we've got the he's the same god yes and gideon do you want to help me here same god [Music] the same god who parted the raging received [Applause] [Music]
