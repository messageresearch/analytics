[0:00] Been
[0:15] a long year. Cried some hard tears on
[0:19] some dark nights.
[0:22] Tried to pray through. Nothing seemed to
[0:26] make the wrongs right.
[0:30] Oh, I can't believe the pain I've seen.
[0:34] But looking back
[0:38] to every step you never left. And I'm so
[0:43] thankful that
[0:46] I'm coming out the other side stronger.
[0:50] One foot in front of the other. Hands
[0:54] still raising. Heart still raising. I
[0:57] made it. I made it. I made it. I made
[1:01] it. Through the storms in hell and high
[1:04] water. I never left the hands of my
[1:08] father. I'm still breathing. Thank you,
[1:11] Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it.
[1:15] I made it.
[1:23] Oh, it cost me, but it taught me that
[1:27] you won't quit.
[1:31] How faithful, how amazing,
[1:35] that your grace is. Oh,
[1:39] no matter what this life may bring, I
[1:43] know you'll bring me through.
[1:47] And even in my suffering,
[1:50] Lord, I can trust in you.
[1:55] I'm coming out the other side, stronger.
[1:59] One foot in front of the other. Hands
[2:03] still raising, heart still raising. I
[2:06] made it. I made it. I made it. I made
[2:10] it. Through the storms and hell and high
[2:13] water. I never left the hands of my
[2:17] father. I'm still breathing. Thank you,
[2:20] Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it.
[2:24] I made it. I made it through more than I
[2:28] thought that I could. I walked through
[2:31] the worst, but it worked for my good.
[2:34] It's a miracle that I can stand here and
[2:37] say I made it. Oh, I made it. I made it
[2:43] through more than I thought that I
[2:45] could. I walked through the worst, but
[2:48] it worked for my good. It's a miracle
[2:51] that I can stand here and say I made it.
[2:55] Oh, I made it. I'm coming out the other
[2:59] side stronger.
[3:01] One foot in front of the other. Hands
[3:05] still raising. Heart still raising. I
[3:08] made it. I made it. I made it. I made it
[3:13] through the storms of hell and high
[3:15] water. I never left the hands of my
[3:19] father. I'm still breathing. Thank you,
[3:22] Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it.
[3:26] I made it. Coming out the other side.
[3:30] Stronger.
[3:32] One foot in front of the other. Hands
[3:35] still raising, heart still raising. I
[3:39] made it. I made it. I made it. I made
[3:42] it. Through the storms and hell and high
[3:46] water. I never left the hands of my
[3:50] father. I'm still breathing. Thank you,
[3:53] Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it.
[3:57] I made it.
[4:04] I made it.
[4:09] Praise God. I made it.
