[0:00] sometimes i've found that i have a need
[0:02] and i don't know i have a need
[0:04] and so if he comes by your door and
[0:06] knocks on it and touches you and don't
[0:08] get mad at him this morning because
[0:10] that's his
[0:11] love to you can you say amen let's just
[0:13] bow our heads heavenly father
[0:15] lord jesus we stand here
[0:18] this morning lord just in this
[0:19] atmosphere and
[0:21] kind of trembling inside
[0:23] hardly knowing lord where we should
[0:25] start because we're
[0:27] standing before your wife this morning
[0:30] lord but more importantly we're standing
[0:32] in your presence
[0:34] we understand father that a man could
[0:36] stand here and read the scripture and he
[0:38] could maybe read some quotes or read a
[0:40] story
[0:42] but it's going to take you this morning
[0:43] lord as you walked with the two and you
[0:46] came down to the evening time lord and
[0:48] and you were going to pass them on by
[0:50] and they compelled you to come in and
[0:52] you came in and when you broke the bread
[0:55] they knew who you were may you break the
[0:57] bread to us this morning father
[0:59] may we know who you are may we know you
[1:01] and the power of your resurrection lord
[1:03] whatever need will be here this morning
[1:05] i asked heavenly father that you would
[1:07] just come and meet it now
[1:08] we ask it in the precious name of our
[1:10] lord savior jesus christ and the body
[1:13] would say
[1:15] amen if you have your bibles this
[1:16] morning i'm
[1:18] not much for small talk i'll greet you
[1:19] here in a minute we'll just go ahead and
[1:21] read the scriptures
[1:22] in ephesians chapter
[1:24] 6 and verse 12 and the reason i'm not
[1:27] much for small talk it's not about me
[1:29] it's about him and i want to make sure i
[1:31] don't care if you remember me or you
[1:33] remember my name but i do care that you
[1:36] remember the jesus that i bring you this
[1:38] morning that's the most important thing
[1:40] ephesians chapter 6 and verse 2 12
[1:44] is a very familiar portion of scripture
[1:46] says for we wrestle not
[1:49] against what
[1:50] flesh and blood
[1:52] but against principalities against
[1:54] powers
[1:55] against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:57] world against spiritual wickedness
[2:00] in high places
[2:02] over in first kings chapter 18
[2:05] and verse 21
[2:07] it reads it like this this is when
[2:09] elijah was dealing with the people and
[2:10] the prophets of bell
[2:13] says an elijah came unto all the people
[2:16] and said how long
[2:18] halt ye between two
[2:20] opinions so he's asking them a question
[2:23] he said if the lord be god
[2:26] follow him
[2:28] but if baal then follow him
[2:30] and the people answered him
[2:32] not
[2:33] a word sometimes god asks you a question
[2:36] ask me a question
[2:37] and he won't say nothing because he's
[2:39] wanting to see what our response
[2:41] to the word will be one more scripture
[2:43] and we'll let you be seated over in the
[2:44] book of james
[2:46] chapter one and verse eight we said it's
[2:48] a familiar scripture but the bible
[2:50] should be a familiar book to us can you
[2:52] say amen
[2:54] james chapter 1 and verse 8 says it like
[2:57] this
[2:59] that a double minded man
[3:02] is unstable
[3:04] in what some of his ways
[3:07] part of his ways
[3:08] in all
[3:10] of his ways let's pray one more time
[3:12] heavenly father
[3:13] lord we come to you now we have done our
[3:16] part we have reached the point where we
[3:18] can go no farther that
[3:20] it's going to take you to come and take
[3:22] control and we're asking that you would
[3:23] minister lord you would forgive
[3:26] each of us of any sin and
[3:28] trespass iniquity thought and failure
[3:30] and we ask the lord that we're not
[3:32] looking in to ourselves this morning
[3:34] lord but each of us are looking unto you
[3:36] who is the author and the finisher
[3:38] of our faith now come lord and minister
[3:40] in jesus name we ask you
[3:43] amen god bless you may be seated i will
[3:46] say before we get started it's certainly
[3:48] good to be with you
[3:49] many of you don't know i know brother
[3:51] kenny and sister tina i met them a while
[3:53] back and i know sister rebecca we go our
[3:56] families go way back when we were
[3:57] children and and i've heard the
[4:00] lafontaine family sing through the years
[4:02] but just recently became acquainted i
[4:04] heard something that your pastor had
[4:06] preached somebody told me something he's
[4:08] preached so i went online and listened
[4:09] to it
[4:10] and uh when i did i'm like wow we're in
[4:12] the same channel so i reached out to him
[4:14] and we talked
[4:16] for about an hour and a half and we
[4:18] found that we had a lot in common and
[4:19] that was the lord jesus and and we're
[4:22] interested i told the church a while
[4:23] back i said i'm interested in preaching
[4:26] myself out of a job
[4:29] i'm not interested in building a kingdom
[4:31] i'm not interested in another woman god
[4:33] gave me a woman that i'm very happy with
[4:35] very pleased with four children by
[4:38] i'm not interested in money and i
[4:40] certainly will never be the most popular
[4:42] preacher because
[4:44] i believe that it's gun barrel straight
[4:45] i believe it's a bare fisted gospel i i
[4:48] believe in a practical gospel that's the
[4:50] kind of preach around that it must
[4:52] affect your life if it's theology and
[4:54] it's out here somewhere and it never
[4:55] comes down to your door it's probably
[4:57] not
[4:58] the right gospel so i'm kind of just
[5:01] that kind of preacher i don't know how
[5:02] to do anything other than just take the
[5:04] word and just let the holy spirit take a
[5:06] hold of it but it certainly is a
[5:08] privilege and an honor to be with
[5:10] another part of the bride we've been
[5:12] ministering since about 2003
[5:16] been pastoring since 2017 took a little
[5:18] church where a pastor had been there for
[5:20] about 30 plus years and and so we're
[5:23] still wet behind the ears as the old
[5:25] saying goes we're still green we're
[5:26] still learning so i glean from your
[5:29] pastor anything that i can i believe
[5:30] each church is sovereign but i believe
[5:33] the same god that's there in north
[5:34] carolina is here
[5:36] in ohio this morning we live and reside
[5:39] in hickory north carolina pastor of the
[5:41] church close there
[5:42] and so we're we're just trying to do our
[5:44] best for the kingdom of god to uh
[5:46] like i said i want to preach myself out
[5:48] of job i want to preach the word in a
[5:50] way that it changes the people and we
[5:52] can take a body change and we can leave
[5:54] this earth can you say amen to that
[5:56] that's what i'm after if not what are we
[5:58] doing i'm tired of walking around the
[6:00] mountain you know what i'm saying we
[6:02] walked around the mountain long enough
[6:04] we walked around the mountain of
[6:05] doctoring over and over and over and
[6:06] over but something's got to come there's
[6:09] got to be a generation that raises up
[6:11] that takes a body change and i want to
[6:14] be that part of it i'm not as young as i
[6:15] used to be but i'm still young in spirit
[6:18] and i'm still young enough to take it
[6:20] are you with me and i won't i want to
[6:22] see our loved ones so god bless you this
[6:24] morning we'll move straight into this
[6:26] little thought it's um
[6:28] kind of a practical thought
[6:30] but um it's been those things that has
[6:32] changed my life and this is a thought
[6:35] that's very near and dear to my heart
[6:37] that the lord has given me and i
[6:39] preached it to the church but before i
[6:41] preached it of the church it had to be
[6:43] preached to me at home and it changed my
[6:45] life so i pray that there would be
[6:47] something that you could
[6:49] glean from this morning that would be of
[6:51] a benefit to you can you say amen to
[6:52] that because if you didn't come brother
[6:55] brown said we come to the church and
[6:56] we'll leave the doors better or we'll
[6:58] leave
[6:59] worse and i've left worse so many times
[7:01] i'm not interested in doing that anymore
[7:04] i want to leave a much better christian
[7:06] than what i came can you say amen to
[7:07] that but i want to take a thought this
[7:09] morning and
[7:11] just in my way i be you and you be me
[7:13] and we'll let god be god is that okay
[7:15] i want to ask you a question sort of
[7:17] this thought would be a question to you
[7:20] at what altar do you worship
[7:23] at what altar are you worshiping this
[7:25] morning and i want to give it a subtitle
[7:27] of either an altar of faith
[7:30] or an altar
[7:32] of offense
[7:34] an altar of faith we're either
[7:36] worshiping at one of two altars this
[7:37] morning at an altar of faith
[7:40] or an altar of offense and many times
[7:42] when we're offended we don't even know
[7:45] that we're worshiping at the altar of
[7:47] offense
[7:48] but what we're doing we're trying to
[7:50] have faith and seems like nothing's
[7:52] happening
[7:53] where's god god's not moving so i want
[7:55] you to keep that in mind as we move
[7:58] through this as i ask you the question
[8:00] this morning what altar do you worship i
[8:02] want to just lay a background for just a
[8:04] minute here if we think about this an
[8:07] altar is a place of sacrifice it's where
[8:09] you come and you give an offering to god
[8:12] it's a place of worship we in other
[8:15] words it's something given
[8:17] the first place we really find in
[8:19] genesis would be genesis chapter 4 where
[8:21] there was an altar
[8:23] that was brought and there were two
[8:25] sacrifices
[8:26] one was by revelation
[8:29] by the heart and the other one was from
[8:31] intellect and god accepted one
[8:34] but he would not
[8:35] accept
[8:36] the other one are you with me this
[8:38] morning
[8:39] one is acceptable and one is not matthew
[8:42] 6 and 21 just a few scriptures here this
[8:44] morning it says for where your treasure
[8:47] is
[8:48] there will your heart also be so
[8:51] really the altar this morning is not we
[8:53] call this an altar we give an altar call
[8:56] but the altar lays within the heart of
[8:58] every human being this morning that's
[9:00] where it is jeremiah 17 9-10 says it
[9:03] like this that the heart
[9:05] is a deceitful thing
[9:08] the heart is a deceitful thing above
[9:11] all things not just some things it says
[9:14] desperately wicked and who can know it
[9:17] now watch this this is what the lord did
[9:19] with me when i looked at this little
[9:20] thought he said i the lord
[9:23] not your pastor this morning not a
[9:25] preacher not an evangelist not a teacher
[9:28] not a prophet but i the lord search the
[9:31] heart or search the altar brother
[9:34] branham made a statement one time he
[9:35] said the sickest body i know is the
[9:37] bride of jesus christ it's a paraphrase
[9:40] quote okay but when i looked at this i
[9:42] began to understand sometimes sickness
[9:44] is in the body and you don't know that
[9:46] you're sick
[9:47] until a symptom arises and when the
[9:50] symptom arises then you go for the
[9:52] checkup watch something is off and so
[9:54] it's the same way with the spiritual
[9:57] side of things he said i the lord
[9:59] searched the heart or the altar he says
[10:01] i try the reigns to
[10:04] even to give every man according to his
[10:07] ways according to the fruit of his doing
[10:10] so the our actions are connected to what
[10:14] our heart
[10:16] it's connected to our altar
[10:18] luke chapter 6 and verse 45 says that a
[10:21] good man out of the good treasure of his
[10:22] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[10:25] and an evil treasure out of the evil
[10:27] evil man out of the evil treasure of his
[10:29] heart bringeth forth that which is evil
[10:31] for the abundant for out of the
[10:33] abundance of the heart his mouth
[10:36] speaketh
[10:37] so when you and i speak this morning
[10:39] where are we speaking from we're not
[10:41] speaking from our lips we're actually
[10:43] issuing it forth from our heart you know
[10:46] sometimes we come to church and we don't
[10:48] feel like praising god
[10:50] we've had a bad day we've had a bad week
[10:52] are you with me we expect the song
[10:54] leader and we expect the preacher to
[10:56] pump us up but i told the church a while
[10:58] back i said there's only two times that
[11:00] you should
[11:02] feel like
[11:03] praising the lord that's when you feel
[11:04] like it and when you don't feel like it
[11:07] because his feelings has got nothing to
[11:09] do when he went to the cross for you and
[11:11] me
[11:12] he didn't feel like killing me he didn't
[11:14] feel like delivering me because he knew
[11:16] every time i would turn my back on him
[11:18] but he did it anyway
[11:20] he did it anyhow in other words it had
[11:23] nothing to do with feeling so when we
[11:25] comes to praising god we praise him
[11:27] because he is
[11:29] worthy can you say amen to them
[11:31] matthew 15 and verse 8 says these people
[11:34] draw nigh draw nigh unto me with their
[11:37] mouth and on earth me with their lips
[11:38] but watch this their heart is far from
[11:41] me
[11:42] so in other words there's something up
[11:44] on the altar of the heart that is
[11:46] unacceptable but he said in vain they do
[11:49] worship me and this is what the lord
[11:51] showed me said you can have an offense
[11:53] in your heart towards somebody or
[11:55] something and you're trying to come and
[11:58] worship me
[11:59] and you are worshipping me in vain
[12:02] because there is no faith
[12:04] because the bible says that he that
[12:06] believeth that he
[12:07] must have what
[12:09] must have faith in other words to know
[12:11] without a shadow of a doubt that he is
[12:14] produces a true worship
[12:16] can you say amen to them
[12:19] now at this thought we're looking at
[12:20] what altar do you worship i want to lay
[12:23] a background this is where the holy
[12:24] spirit really pulled this from was out
[12:26] of first kings chapter 18 but i want to
[12:29] background something here just a minute
[12:31] before we before we look forward first
[12:34] kings chapter 16. i'm just going to pull
[12:37] some nuggets out of this this evening
[12:39] and or this morning rather and we'll see
[12:40] how the holy spirit will lead us we find
[12:43] where ahab had married jezebel and the
[12:46] bible says he went into worshipping
[12:48] baals so in other words the type of the
[12:50] antichrist he had he had raised up an
[12:53] altar and he had built a house for
[12:55] another god in samaria the bible says
[12:58] and another thing is that he allowed
[12:59] jericho to be rebuilt and the bible says
[13:02] that he did more to provoke god than all
[13:05] the kings before him
[13:08] he set up an altar and i want you to
[13:09] understand when an altar is set there's
[13:12] going to be worship
[13:14] when he sets up this altar there was the
[13:16] prophets of baal that came with this
[13:18] altar in other words there was another
[13:21] spirit that was ministering to israel
[13:23] now other than the spirit of god
[13:26] another god was being worshipped and i
[13:28] thought how the anything that connects
[13:31] disconnects god from his wife
[13:35] anything i said anything it could be
[13:37] your job it could be your career it
[13:40] could be your husband you realize some
[13:42] people worship their husbands some
[13:44] people worship their wives i've seen
[13:46] some people worship their children and
[13:49] grandchildren
[13:51] anything that's set up in our hearts
[13:53] this morning disconnects us and puts us
[13:56] at an altar of offense and not an altar
[13:59] of faith this morning
[14:01] anything that we put before god is an
[14:03] altar offense first kings 17
[14:06] i thought about this and this is what
[14:07] the holy spirit really showed me and it
[14:09] really just kind of jumped out to me
[14:11] when an altar of offense is set up
[14:15] there are two conditions that come with
[14:17] this
[14:19] drought
[14:21] and it dries up the rain
[14:24] when they set up the altar of of bell in
[14:26] their israel that they they had no food
[14:29] the cattle didn't have any food the
[14:31] people didn't have any food because
[14:33] there was no rain
[14:35] in other words when i want to set
[14:37] something up on the altar of my heart
[14:39] that's not connected back to the holy
[14:41] spirit he dries himself up from me he
[14:43] just pulls himself back away from him
[14:46] and he don't like that because the bible
[14:48] said that he's a jealous god in other
[14:50] words he wants your praise he wants your
[14:52] affection he wants your thoughts he
[14:54] wants everything that you are because he
[14:57] gave everything for you in other words
[15:00] for you and i to receive everything we
[15:02] must give everything
[15:05] in other words we can withhold nothing
[15:07] from him everything has got to be
[15:10] surrendered but here in first kings we
[15:12] find when this altar of offense was set
[15:14] up there was two conditions there was a
[15:17] drought and the rain had dried up now as
[15:19] we go through this altar of offense i
[15:21] want to lay this out in two ways
[15:24] the altar of offense that i want to look
[15:26] at this morning is a doctrinal altar of
[15:29] offense
[15:31] and a personal altar
[15:34] of offense
[15:35] a doctrinal offer of offer a altar of
[15:38] offense and a personal altar of offense
[15:40] so hold that as we go through this now
[15:42] first king 17 we find that it opens with
[15:45] a widow woman or if i could say it this
[15:47] with a church with no head ship
[15:50] what had caused the headship there was
[15:52] an altar of offense that broke the
[15:55] headship between israel and god
[15:58] are you with me now and so what happened
[16:00] it was affected but with no rain or very
[16:03] little food and we find this woman was
[16:05] down to the last little bit of meal
[16:10] what because there was an offense set up
[16:13] you know i found in my own life when i
[16:15] have a fences that lays in there that i
[16:18] want to know where god is
[16:20] that he's just like he's so far from me
[16:22] i can't find him
[16:24] you know and i can lis you can listen to
[16:26] all the messages you want you can read
[16:28] all the scriptures you want but if your
[16:30] heart's not right with god if there's
[16:32] another if there's something else upon
[16:34] the altar it'll never work
[16:36] it'll never work why because you wasn't
[16:38] created to have an altar of offense you
[16:41] were created for an altar of faith to
[16:43] believe all things
[16:46] now i want you to think about this after
[16:48] three years of dry time of no no rain or
[16:52] we could say no spirit or very little
[16:54] food or or spiritual word the conditions
[16:57] had gotten so bad that that this woman
[17:00] she said you know what i don't even know
[17:02] if there is a god
[17:06] are you with me we can sit in message
[17:08] churches for 50 years and don't know
[17:10] that there's a god
[17:12] why because we've got something else
[17:14] laying upon the altar of our heart
[17:16] because jesus can't stay there he takes
[17:18] a step back he says when you get rid of
[17:21] it when you're ready to surrender then
[17:23] i'll come back and take over but until
[17:25] then
[17:26] see he cannot fight your battles as long
[17:28] as you're fighting them when you want
[17:31] vengeance god says then you have your
[17:33] own vengeance but it's not going to work
[17:35] out the way you wanted it to why because
[17:38] vengeance is mine saith the lord if we
[17:41] operate anywhere outside of the word of
[17:43] god it will not work it never has work
[17:46] and won't work today
[17:49] but i thought about this that this altar
[17:51] of offense to another deity it has no
[17:53] power
[17:54] and it's amazing how far things can
[17:57] decline in such a short period
[18:00] of time
[18:01] you know the devil when he walks in
[18:06] oh i can handle this i'm okay
[18:09] and it just goes farther and farther and
[18:13] farther
[18:15] and we start getting sticky with her
[18:16] husband
[18:17] we start getting sticky with her wife we
[18:20] start getting sticky with the children
[18:23] and eventually we dry up
[18:25] right
[18:26] why because we're worshiping at the
[18:29] altar of offense
[18:30] not the altar of faith this morning is
[18:32] this okay this morning i'm just god told
[18:35] me to come here and deliver this i don't
[18:36] know why but we're going to do it this
[18:37] morning but i want to give you my own
[18:39] testimony of this here in just a minute
[18:42] but i thought about this when when the
[18:44] altar of offense comes we become
[18:46] stubborn
[18:48] we'll still come to church we'll still
[18:50] raise our head we'll still sing we'll
[18:53] still look right we'll still dress right
[18:57] but because we're worshiping at the
[19:00] wrong altar
[19:02] we get nothing from god
[19:07] i found something
[19:09] interesting here how
[19:10] that when things go wrong
[19:14] we blame everybody
[19:16] but ourselves
[19:20] ahab
[19:21] called elijah he said are you the man
[19:24] that's causing that struggle with israel
[19:28] ahab was the one that did it
[19:31] ahab was the one that married the wrong
[19:33] woman it brought the prophets of baal
[19:35] set up the altar of offense brought in
[19:37] another ministry and he said elijah you
[19:40] know that's how it is now come on when
[19:42] the pastor comes and has to bring a
[19:44] correction to you we get upset and says
[19:46] well you're the one that's got a problem
[19:48] i'm happy where i'm at that's not your
[19:50] pastor that's doing that now that's the
[19:52] gift that's in his life that god says i
[19:55] love that one enough
[19:57] i didn't shed my blood and die so that
[19:59] they could go their own way but i love
[20:01] them enough to put a gift in a man's
[20:03] life that'll come down and says you're
[20:05] wrong and you need to get away from that
[20:07] thing
[20:08] why because that's the love of god to
[20:10] you
[20:12] see you were designed to express him
[20:14] upon this earth
[20:16] are you with me you were designed to
[20:18] express jesus christ
[20:20] upon this earth you in other words a
[20:22] reflection of your husband and anything
[20:25] that's not a reflection of him is an
[20:27] altar of offense this morning
[20:29] but he says are you the one that
[20:31] troubleth israel are you the one that's
[20:34] causing me this problem are you the one
[20:36] that's causing all the israel
[20:40] are thou the man that troubleth israel
[20:43] in other words we have no rain we have
[20:45] no food
[20:47] but i like this god says hey
[20:50] i love you enough to let's have a
[20:52] showdown this morning
[20:54] let's call for a showdown
[20:56] so he calls israel to assembly
[20:59] with this altar of offense
[21:03] and he said how long will you halt
[21:05] between two opinions
[21:07] you know sometimes we can be halted
[21:09] between doing the right thing and the
[21:10] wrong thing because we're wanting our
[21:12] own way with it
[21:14] don't we haven't surrendered to the holy
[21:16] spirit the way we ought so therefore
[21:18] well lord i'm going to pray this way
[21:20] because this is how i want it to come
[21:22] out
[21:24] not father if it be thy will
[21:27] are you with me
[21:28] watch he's looking for a complete
[21:30] surrender this morning so he can give
[21:32] you all the power
[21:37] well this is my life this is what i know
[21:39] to be the truth this only way i know to
[21:41] put it is from my own experience how
[21:44] long will you haunt between two opinions
[21:46] if the lord be god follow him but if
[21:48] baal then follow him and the people
[21:51] answered him not a word
[21:54] in other words how long will you worship
[21:56] between two altars this morning
[22:00] now i want you to think about this when
[22:02] he brings them together
[22:04] he lays two elements upon this altar
[22:08] one is wood
[22:10] and what is sacrifice
[22:12] humanity and the cross
[22:15] and this is what i have found that when
[22:17] we look at things from the aspect of a
[22:20] of a doctrinal offense that
[22:22] we can have
[22:24] all the right quotes
[22:27] we can have all the right scripture
[22:29] verses
[22:30] but one is from revelation
[22:34] and the other one is from
[22:35] intellectualism
[22:38] and they're really close together
[22:40] i said they're really close together
[22:43] but one can produce and one cannot see
[22:46] the devil does not care this morning
[22:48] that you believe that god sent you a
[22:49] prophet
[22:51] he don't care about that
[22:54] he don't care that we said in message
[22:56] churches
[22:57] are you with me
[22:59] but what he does care about is when you
[23:01] come in contact with the one who sent
[23:03] the prophet
[23:05] when you come in contact with the one
[23:07] who sent the message
[23:09] then he knows at that point he now is in
[23:11] trouble are you with me
[23:14] he doesn't care what we believe i i've
[23:16] seen it through the years and i'm going
[23:18] to be i'm just going to give you a
[23:19] little bit of of me i grew up in the
[23:21] messages it's okay this morning i grew
[23:24] up in the message and
[23:25] and and i believed certain things and i
[23:27] thought that's what the message was
[23:30] but come to find out that was a altar of
[23:33] offense it was a doctrinal offense
[23:36] because you know why it produced no
[23:37] power in my life
[23:39] it gave me nothing to overcome with it
[23:41] actually wanted me to argue with people
[23:44] about that i was right or that i was
[23:46] wrong and the holy spirit was standing
[23:48] back and says when you quit
[23:50] when you release what you believe
[23:54] are you with me i want to say this
[23:55] there's nothing wrong with the message
[23:57] nor the messenger
[23:59] but it's what people has made out of it
[24:01] for the last 50 years
[24:03] are you with me we're coming back to the
[24:05] essence of what it really was in other
[24:08] words all the offenses that's upon the
[24:10] altar of people's heart god's cleaning
[24:12] it off
[24:14] oh hallelujah
[24:17] i found out when when when you're stuck
[24:19] in a doctrinal offense you do all the
[24:21] talking
[24:23] because you got to convince somebody
[24:25] just how right you are because you don't
[24:26] even really believe what you say
[24:29] you don't believe it so every time you
[24:31] regurgitate it you're convincing
[24:33] yourself that you're the one that's
[24:35] right
[24:39] you ever heard the saying that a man
[24:41] convinced against his will
[24:44] is of the same opinion still
[24:48] you win your argument over a doctrine
[24:50] but then you walk away and they're like
[24:52] i still don't believe what you got
[24:56] you know what was printed it was
[24:57] theology was the presentation
[25:00] not the person behind the theology
[25:04] oh my god
[25:08] is this okay this morning
[25:11] i want you to think about it now you can
[25:14] have all the right fundamentals
[25:17] you can have the
[25:19] right hair length
[25:21] you can have the right dress you can
[25:23] wear
[25:26] and it still be an offense
[25:29] it can still be an altar that you're
[25:30] worshiping at that you ought not be
[25:32] worshiping that
[25:35] and what you're doing is
[25:38] maybe you're not guilty this morning
[25:40] maybe i'm just preaching to the four
[25:41] walls
[25:43] but those prophets of baal were so
[25:45] convinced that they were right that they
[25:46] stood and afflicted themselves
[25:50] see all elijah was trying to say if god
[25:52] is god then where is he at today
[25:55] well we believe what we believe we
[25:57] believe x doctrine
[26:00] you got to see it the way i see it
[26:02] i'm going to cut myself and maybe i'll
[26:04] catch your attention with it
[26:09] are you with me
[26:11] yeah i don't know nobody like that do
[26:12] you
[26:14] listen i told you when i started i
[26:15] believe in a practical gospel
[26:17] i believe if the gospel does not come
[26:19] down to my life every day and address it
[26:22] then it ain't doing me no good
[26:25] are you with me
[26:26] the bible says that he was the firstborn
[26:29] among many brethren in other words the
[26:32] life that was in jesus christ must be
[26:34] back in the bride in the believer
[26:39] he said you by your traditions make the
[26:41] word of god a nun effect where did the
[26:43] pharisees get their traditions from
[26:46] right out of moses's message
[26:49] there wasn't nothing wrong with moses
[26:51] and there wasn't nothing wrong with this
[26:52] message but because they did not know
[26:55] the giver of the message
[26:57] they had traditions produced from it
[27:00] there was another altar there was a
[27:02] disconnect
[27:10] i i watch people well we're in the
[27:12] british no we're in the laodicean church
[27:14] age we're in the bright age and and i'm
[27:16] thinking
[27:21] somebody help me
[27:22] somebody give me m ibuprofen
[27:26] and i thought lord what's really the
[27:28] problem
[27:30] and see here's what i believe i don't
[27:32] know about you but i believe that you
[27:34] can actually hear
[27:35] the voice
[27:36] of god himself
[27:39] [Music]
[27:41] are you with me
[27:43] and i said lord there's two quotes on
[27:45] both sides of the fence but there's got
[27:47] to be a middle of the road
[27:49] you know what he said to me he said son
[27:51] when has there not ever been a bright
[27:54] age
[27:57] see we get hung up on theology and
[28:00] terminology and we create one man
[28:04] denominations
[28:06] brother braham said this message would
[28:08] never denominate but he never said
[28:11] that the spirit wouldn't creep into our
[28:13] churches wouldn't creep to her thinking
[28:15] you know how easy it is for you to
[28:17] create a denomination within yourself
[28:19] because i've done it
[28:21] it's when you put a period at the end of
[28:23] it
[28:24] instead of a comma and whatever else god
[28:27] you choose to reveal
[28:29] not whatever quote i find to support
[28:31] what i believe
[28:33] see when a person's got a doctoral
[28:34] offense they ain't listening for the
[28:36] voice of god they're coming to church to
[28:39] see if the preacher is going to support
[28:40] or be against what they already believe
[28:43] are you with me and when we search the
[28:45] message it's not to find the voice of
[28:47] god to let eternal life be imparted to
[28:50] us even more it's to find what we
[28:52] believe even more
[28:54] i had to come to a point to say god i
[28:56] know nothing
[28:58] i need you to minister to my spirit to
[29:01] change my life
[29:03] when i did oh you're talking about a
[29:05] spiritual detox
[29:08] i had to have a doctrinal detox i had to
[29:11] be detoxified from everything i thought
[29:14] i knew was right
[29:20] listen the only way only place you ever
[29:22] get anywhere with god is you got to be
[29:24] brutally honest with him
[29:27] you might fool your husband you might
[29:28] for your wife you might for your pastor
[29:30] you might even fool yourself but you
[29:32] ain't gonna fool god
[29:35] he knows right where you're at he knows
[29:36] how to come down to your doorstep but
[29:38] when i said lord what's the difference
[29:40] between the bright age and the laodicean
[29:42] church and she said when have i not ever
[29:44] had a bright age
[29:48] i said well there's got to be scripture
[29:49] for that you see where things come is
[29:51] when we take the message and we separate
[29:54] it from the bible
[29:57] are you with me this morning
[29:59] when we take it and separated it now i
[30:01] said lord where is the scripture for
[30:03] that then
[30:05] he said well
[30:06] paul said when i had him to write it
[30:09] they were seated in christ jesus in
[30:11] heavenly places
[30:13] he said i was the first angel
[30:16] heavenly and i was the seventh angel
[30:19] and down through seven church ages i had
[30:21] seven messengers upon the earth at that
[30:24] time
[30:25] i spoke they picked the revelation up
[30:27] and they sounded it
[30:29] and the revelation through them caught
[30:31] the bride and set them up in christ
[30:33] jesus
[30:35] i said there's been the bright age we
[30:37] get hung up on terminology well you
[30:39] don't believe it the way i do and what
[30:41] we've done we've caught a shism and an
[30:43] ism and a division from one church to
[30:46] the next from one church member to the
[30:48] next and we have divided the body of
[30:50] jesus christ paul said there should be
[30:53] no schisms
[30:54] in the body are you with me
[30:57] my body still feels the effects of
[30:59] laodicea
[31:02] gross darkness
[31:06] you say well i don't know about that
[31:07] well let me cut you off on the highway
[31:11] and you'll find out real quick that your
[31:13] mind and your body is still trapped in
[31:15] the spirit of gross darkness
[31:17] because you want to do what you want to
[31:19] give them a piece of your mind
[31:21] i'm going to roll up my more roll up as
[31:23] i'm going to roll my window down i'm
[31:24] going to tell them don't you know you
[31:26] cut me off
[31:27] see your body still see there has to be
[31:30] a way to reconcile these things if we'll
[31:33] let god do it and let men stop
[31:36] [Music]
[31:38] are you with me
[31:39] it's both one or the other but when we
[31:42] stand over here on this side and we
[31:44] stand over here on this side and don't
[31:46] let the holy spirit recognize it we're
[31:48] standing at an altar of offense
[31:50] and we're looking it out at one another
[31:52] and so you don't believe it like i do
[31:54] you know what i said i'm glad i don't
[31:56] believe it like you do sometimes
[31:58] because i found out what i thought
[32:00] people should believe like me i was
[32:02] wrong to start with
[32:03] [Music]
[32:06] is this okay this morning
[32:11] let me give you a little secret this
[32:12] morning
[32:17] brother brahm says the reason
[32:21] he's talking about paul that he had this
[32:22] christ in her life is because he
[32:25] personally
[32:26] now laying aside his teaching
[32:31] he personally met christ
[32:37] he had to lay aside said everything i
[32:39] thought i knew i'm paraphrasing this
[32:41] morning i had to count it as dung
[32:44] to know what
[32:46] the person
[32:50] we can sit in messes churches and say i
[32:52] believe x i believe this doctrine i
[32:55] believe this way but never come to know
[32:58] him
[33:00] you realize that jesus christ the holy
[33:02] spirit is a person today
[33:04] he has a personality he has emotions he
[33:08] has feelings
[33:17] he's not tied up in the quote
[33:20] he should be tied up in your heart
[33:28] he says and that's the only way you're
[33:30] ever going to know him is to meet
[33:33] him
[33:36] do you do we still believe that we can
[33:38] meet with jesus christ
[33:43] it's it's to meet him see he said to
[33:46] know him as life
[33:48] notice he never said to know a scripture
[33:50] verse to know a quote is life
[33:53] that's all that the element that comes
[33:55] in here
[33:56] but it must to know him is life because
[33:59] it's the letter that killeth but it's
[34:02] the spirit that giveth life this morning
[34:06] oh my
[34:08] he says to know him as life
[34:11] now watch this and paul had not yet had
[34:13] this experience
[34:18] and he said here one place the life that
[34:20] i now live showed he lived a different
[34:22] life at one time
[34:24] his life had been changed
[34:29] and when your life it's changed it makes
[34:32] you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do
[34:37] so if we're still holding something
[34:39] against somebody
[34:40] because they don't believe it like we do
[34:43] and we won't shake their hand or we'll
[34:45] avoid them
[34:47] when we see them
[34:49] y'all don't go to walmart around here do
[34:50] you
[34:52] for the ones that don't go to walmart
[34:53] when you go to target
[34:57] and that one that believes just a little
[34:59] bit different than you
[35:02] and you won't shake their hand you won't
[35:04] go out of your way to greet them
[35:06] are you
[35:08] i i'm going down this aisle yeah i do i
[35:10] got this on my list i need to go over
[35:11] here
[35:12] to the laundry section
[35:15] they will stand god put them right where
[35:17] you're at
[35:19] you needed somebody off that aisle but
[35:21] you wanted to go over here to avoid them
[35:22] why because god says i must remove you
[35:25] from the altar
[35:26] of offense
[35:29] think about it now
[35:33] you ordinarily would not do and it makes
[35:35] you say things you ordinary ordinarily
[35:37] wouldn't say he said a man's got a
[35:39] christ in her life
[35:41] he said paul stood in the right in the
[35:43] midst of those peoples and jews and so
[35:45] forth
[35:46] there wasn't one speck of fear about him
[35:48] he knew
[35:49] whom he believed
[35:52] do you know that
[35:54] jesus christ is with you
[35:57] or do you just know that you believe a
[35:59] message that god sent by a prophet
[36:03] there is no the devil believes that also
[36:08] the devil believes that also
[36:11] and can keep you backed into a corner
[36:14] it didn't matter that jesus had walked
[36:16] peter had walked with jesus
[36:19] that didn't wasn't what buffaloed the
[36:22] devil that wasn't what put the devil in
[36:24] his
[36:24] place but when je when peter began to
[36:28] act like jesus
[36:29] that's what backed the devil into the
[36:31] corner are you with me because now he
[36:34] knew this is not just somebody that has
[36:36] it from an intellect this is not just
[36:38] somebody that has it from their mouth
[36:40] but this is somebody that has it on the
[36:43] inside and now i am in trouble
[36:47] see i don't know about you but i'm tired
[36:49] of the devil backing me in the corner
[36:52] i'm tired when i get up in the morning i
[36:54] know we're going to have a mind battle
[36:55] but i'm tired of him telling me that you
[36:57] can't make him i'm tired of him telling
[37:00] me that your past is too great are you
[37:02] with me don't tell me you don't hear it
[37:04] every one of us hears it
[37:07] and what we do is we give into that and
[37:10] we let our spiritual immune system
[37:12] become weakened over time and we don't
[37:15] have any no victory we don't have no
[37:17] victory in our lives
[37:19] but we still believe the right things
[37:25] see i told my church a while back i said
[37:27] look just because you believe x means
[37:30] absolutely nothing
[37:32] if the god that you believe isn't there
[37:34] to back it up
[37:39] i'm going to say a strong statement
[37:41] he can correct me later if he needs to
[37:44] but we may as well be a baptist
[37:47] we may as well be a lutheran
[37:49] we may as well be presbyterians
[37:52] we're called by another name message
[37:55] believers
[37:56] but if that message don't produce the
[37:59] very life
[38:03] your church's name literal life
[38:08] if it doesn't produce the literal life
[38:11] it is an altar of offense you say it's
[38:14] kind of challenging this morning yes i
[38:16] know it is
[38:17] but you know i found the only way i
[38:19] would ever grow
[38:22] is i had to get outside of myself i had
[38:24] to be challenged
[38:27] i i'm not much of a musician but i try
[38:29] to play the guitar a little bit
[38:31] and and brother kenny when we was at a
[38:33] church a few years back he came and and
[38:37] you you challenged everybody that day
[38:39] you didn't realize it
[38:41] some of them got mad i didn't i knew i
[38:44] was there i watched your attitudes but
[38:46] he told us what we needed to do to
[38:48] become better
[38:49] i was the only one that listened to it
[38:52] because they said you're doing something
[38:54] different what are you doing i said what
[38:55] he told me to do
[38:58] you see god sometimes tells us exactly
[39:00] what it is that we need to do and it's
[39:02] too simple to follow
[39:05] because we want the deep mysterious
[39:07] things of god but we can't even get the
[39:09] abcs right
[39:11] we must have the foundation laid and if
[39:13] we don't have it we got to be let be
[39:16] willing to let the holy spirit come in
[39:17] and wipe our foundation down
[39:21] so you must be born again to make sure
[39:23] we got that foundation right
[39:30] oh my
[39:32] i wish i could be an no i don't want to
[39:34] be an intellectual but i wish i could
[39:36] deliver it a different way
[39:38] but you see when i got rid of theology
[39:41] and i met the giver of the message
[39:43] literally met a being
[39:45] i said but where is the god of the
[39:47] prophet
[39:49] because i know i had no overcoming power
[39:51] in my life just because i heard it just
[39:53] because my family believed it just
[39:55] because my father had been in the
[39:56] meetings
[39:57] uh-uh no i needed a personal contact
[40:05] is this okay this morning
[40:08] he said he knew noting who he believed
[40:12] in after that
[40:13] he says and he had a little life
[40:16] and he had a life that he would
[40:18] would by no means have he did it if he
[40:21] hadn't found something that had
[40:22] genuinely anchored him
[40:26] this is what i found maybe not for you
[40:28] but i believe ex-doctrine was not an
[40:30] anchor in my life
[40:33] it was actual stumbling block to me
[40:35] right
[40:36] because i was like i can't explain it
[40:39] i can't figure it out
[40:41] i can't make it work i can't i can't win
[40:44] somebody to the message
[40:47] because i was trying to win them to the
[40:49] wrong thing
[40:52] why did they want anything different
[40:54] than what i had they had theology just
[40:56] like i did
[40:58] but when you say hey let me introduce
[41:00] you
[41:01] to somebody
[41:03] oh
[41:04] a person yeah his name is jesus
[41:12] i believe that god is detoxing us
[41:15] from all doctrinal offenses things that
[41:17] ought not to be there
[41:20] many times they're correct but we hold
[41:21] them in the wrong place
[41:24] are you with me we hold them in the
[41:26] wrong place
[41:30] what about a personal altar of offense
[41:34] i want to deal with this for just a few
[41:35] minutes i won't keep you much longer but
[41:38] this right here was a real real kicker
[41:40] in the gut for me
[41:42] because
[41:44] i'm offended
[41:45] how dare somebody tell me that i'm
[41:48] offended
[41:52] see god's interested in what you believe
[41:55] and he's interested in your personal
[41:57] life as well
[42:00] he's interested in making you 100
[42:03] whole
[42:04] sort of a body change
[42:08] he didn't say i give you tribulations
[42:10] abundantly said i give you
[42:13] life
[42:15] i've given you joy i've give you peace
[42:17] i've given you happiness
[42:20] and sometimes we think well we ain't
[42:22] even a christian unless we're in a trial
[42:24] unless we're fighting
[42:25] sometimes you've got to have a respite
[42:27] sometimes you've got to have a place of
[42:29] rest
[42:35] here's what god showed me i was
[42:37] listening to a book
[42:39] i'm going to say this i think it's okay
[42:40] i think you and i are on the same page
[42:42] but i was listening to a book that
[42:44] wasn't a message book is that okay i
[42:46] like to listen to audio books now i
[42:48] ain't listening to a bunch of junk
[42:51] but this book was called
[42:53] unoffendable
[42:56] it's about a four-hour book it's called
[42:57] an unfiddle unoffendable and it's a
[42:59] nominal christian
[43:01] and this viewpoint how christians
[43:03] shouldn't get offended i'm like man this
[43:04] is some good stuff i'm going to preach
[43:06] out of this
[43:08] god said you will after i fix you first
[43:14] i thought man this is an awesome book
[43:17] until the second trip through it and i
[43:19] thought i don't like this book no more
[43:23] because i realized i had offenses
[43:26] in my life
[43:28] don't ever think
[43:30] your pastor walks on water
[43:33] he's a man just like you don't ever
[43:35] think that the fifo ministry walks on
[43:37] some great level
[43:39] we have as much battles if not more than
[43:41] you we're greater targets many times
[43:44] because if he can get us discouraged and
[43:46] get us to fall and get us to not repent
[43:56] but i thought i'm not offended
[43:58] what's this going on
[44:00] but you know what when i look listen to
[44:02] this and and i found it in the
[44:04] scriptures okay so i'm not
[44:06] off the wall
[44:09] you know something i found you can say
[44:11] the same thing that the quote saying
[44:12] without saying it verbatim but the
[44:14] essence is being produced
[44:17] because i know a lot of people that
[44:18] repeats the quotes
[44:20] verbatim
[44:21] but don't have a revelation behind it
[44:26] paul said you say well where's that at
[44:27] paul's brother bram said i preached what
[44:29] paul preached can you find verbatim the
[44:32] things that paul preached brother brahm
[44:33] saying absolutely verbatim you don't but
[44:36] it's the same god coming through the
[44:38] same two different vessels
[44:40] but it's producing the same
[44:42] manifestation
[44:44] but the lord showed me this that
[44:46] when you are offended
[44:51] you have received a lesser value
[44:54] you've you've become less than now when
[44:56] you accept that offense
[45:00] and many times we'll find ourselves
[45:02] standing at an altar thinking that we're
[45:05] standing in an altar of faith trying to
[45:07] worship and have faith for god to move
[45:09] and and to to believe and nothing's
[45:12] happening
[45:13] it's because it's an altar of offense
[45:16] that i was worshiping at and not an
[45:19] altar of faith
[45:20] and i thought well lord i got to find
[45:22] this in the message where's it at
[45:24] i i believe the message okay and i
[45:26] believe the messenger
[45:28] don't don't get me wrong i'm not going
[45:30] i'm not a man that's leaving it i'm a
[45:32] man that's actually coming to what it's
[45:34] about
[45:36] as every son and daughter of god must be
[45:38] coming to what it's about it's got to be
[45:41] something that's affecting you see i
[45:42] believe this this is what i told the
[45:44] preachers at the church i said look when
[45:46] you read a quote of brother branham
[45:47] you're either putting brother branham
[45:48] before the people
[45:50] you're either using it to build your
[45:51] ministry or that quote should be
[45:53] revealing jesus christ back to the
[45:55] people again because the one that
[45:57] preached the message the 1200 sermons
[45:59] that's what his message that's what his
[46:01] life did was put jesus christ back
[46:04] before the people we're talking about a
[46:06] literal life your church this morning
[46:08] are you with me that's what the original
[46:10] literal life it is the original life of
[46:13] god himself zoe god's own life back in
[46:16] the life of a believer
[46:19] and i i went back and i began to search
[46:22] what the prophet of god brother bam said
[46:24] about your conscience your
[46:26] your reasoning your memory your
[46:28] affection your imagination and i came
[46:30] across this scripture verse
[46:33] proverbs 18 14 says the spirit of a man
[46:38] will sustain
[46:40] his infirmity
[46:43] but a wounded spirit
[46:46] who can bear it
[46:47] where does the offenses take place
[46:49] it's in your spirit realm
[46:54] now watch tying that scripture verse in
[46:57] with the things that brother branham
[46:58] said listen
[47:00] when somebody offends you you always
[47:02] have a memory of it
[47:04] you cannot let them you can choose to
[47:06] forget it but it's like it's stored in
[47:09] your hard drive
[47:12] and every once in a while the devil will
[47:14] pull it up
[47:17] and the memory of you remember what
[47:19] happened
[47:21] and then your best friend kicks in
[47:23] reasoning
[47:25] says
[47:26] no why did they do that
[47:28] i i
[47:30] i thought they was a believer
[47:33] reasoning
[47:35] what we're talking about an offense and
[47:36] an affirmative now it's being sustained
[47:39] by the spirit man according to the
[47:41] scriptures
[47:44] why did they do that and then all of a
[47:46] sudden because you don't know
[47:50] you don't realize either the lord may
[47:52] have allowed it to happen or the devil
[47:54] got up on that person and caused that
[47:57] now your imagination kicks in
[48:01] well i bet it was because of this
[48:04] i bet you anything this is the reason
[48:06] they did it
[48:09] you remember what happened reasoning
[48:11] says why and then your imagination
[48:13] begins to supply the answers
[48:19] now we find ourselves moving into this
[48:21] altar of offense
[48:25] now watch
[48:27] because we're affectionate human beings
[48:30] so i'm not an affection yeah there's
[48:31] something in your life that you're
[48:32] affectionate about
[48:35] it might be golfing it might be hunting
[48:37] it might be fishing it might be hobbies
[48:39] it might be your husband a wife your
[48:40] children you are affectionate about
[48:41] something or you're dead
[48:44] you are affectionate about something or
[48:46] you are dead
[48:48] and because we're affectionate what we
[48:50] do is we
[48:52] hold on to this value that's been given
[48:54] because it identifies us
[48:57] and it gives me a validity well i
[49:00] am offended
[49:04] don't we realize jesus said that
[49:05] offenses are going to come
[49:11] and then the conscience kicks in this
[49:13] inner feeling that says
[49:14] you know you really
[49:16] ought not be like that
[49:18] you know what the word says you have to
[49:20] forgive
[49:21] to be forgiven
[49:23] and then guess what kicks back in the
[49:25] memory cycles itself again
[49:29] well i still ain't never i know i'm
[49:30] supposed to give i still ain't never
[49:31] figured out why they did that
[49:33] but you know what
[49:34] i bet it's also this why they did it
[49:39] you realize that the human mind
[49:42] if the events are written down within 24
[49:44] to 48 to 72 hours you do not remember
[49:48] the details of it
[49:50] science has proven this
[49:52] but guess who else knows it
[49:54] the devil
[49:56] and then what happens it's memory
[49:58] reasoning imagination affection
[50:02] conscience and it's the cycle that locks
[50:06] well we're message believers
[50:08] can i give you a scripture verse there
[50:10] is no temptation
[50:12] but what's common
[50:14] to non-message believers and message
[50:16] believers
[50:18] and so this cycle runs over and over and
[50:21] over and over and we come to church year
[50:25] after year
[50:27] after year
[50:29] setting
[50:30] in an offended place
[50:32] with
[50:34] the holy ghost
[50:41] he's the magic pill
[50:44] the bible says he will lead you
[50:46] so that means we have to surrender for
[50:48] him to leap for the inside brother ram
[50:50] said jesus had to pray much to stay in
[50:52] fellowship with the spirit that was with
[50:55] in him
[51:01] with the holy ghost we set and will hold
[51:03] these altars offenses and he's service
[51:05] after service year after year month
[51:07] after month he's saying
[51:08] i will take it
[51:11] if you'll release it
[51:15] but lord i believe that you're jesus
[51:17] christ the same yesterday today and
[51:19] forever and then the back of your mind
[51:20] says but you haven't seen him move
[51:25] are you with me
[51:27] an altar of a personal offense
[51:32] trying to have
[51:34] and and i said lord how can this be true
[51:38] and he said you want scriptures for it
[51:40] i'm like well i always want scriptures
[51:42] for it
[51:42] i want to know where it's at in your
[51:44] word
[51:46] it took me the most unusual place first
[51:50] peter 2 68 says wherefore
[51:52] also it is contained in the scripture
[51:54] behold i lay in sign
[51:56] a chief cornerstone elect precious and
[51:59] he that believeth on him shall not be
[52:01] confounded unto you therefore which
[52:04] believe he is precious but unto them
[52:06] which are disobedient the stone which
[52:08] the builders disallowed the same has
[52:10] made the head of the corner
[52:12] and a stone of stumbling
[52:14] a rock
[52:16] of a fence
[52:17] and i went
[52:19] now he's talking about cyan or the bride
[52:22] it was like he said just because you
[52:24] think you're the bride don't mean that
[52:25] you won't get offended and hold
[52:27] something in your heart for years and i
[52:29] went
[52:30] see even the preacher gets corrected
[52:38] watch this in romans 9 33 as it is
[52:40] written behold i lay in cyan or the
[52:43] bride a stumbling stone in a rock or a
[52:46] revelation
[52:48] that she can be offended
[52:51] also
[52:56] you know when elijah
[52:58] the bible says that he rebuilt
[53:00] the altar
[53:02] he didn't build an altar
[53:04] he picked up what was already laying
[53:08] there
[53:10] the altar of the lord the altar of faith
[53:13] was laying in shambles because an altar
[53:16] of offense had taken
[53:18] its place
[53:20] now there was wood
[53:22] there was a sacrifice humanity brother
[53:25] brahm said is a representation of wood
[53:26] wood is a representation of humanity the
[53:28] cross is the sacrifice
[53:30] on both altars
[53:32] the altar of offense
[53:34] and the altar of faith
[53:37] have the same beliefs
[53:40] but still be worshiping at the wrong
[53:42] altar
[53:46] but there was a couple other elements
[53:49] on elijah's altar
[53:52] there was water
[53:55] washed by the water of the word
[53:59] and there was stones
[54:02] which is a revelation
[54:06] but you know sometimes something happens
[54:08] in your life
[54:10] and you think you got over it
[54:14] and you think you've moved beyond it
[54:17] and you think you're okay you know why
[54:18] because human nature is so adaptive
[54:22] we have the ability to survive
[54:25] trauma we have the ability to survive
[54:27] things that come into our lives
[54:29] because we can cut it off and push it
[54:31] aside
[54:33] but this is what the holy spirit showed
[54:34] me
[54:35] he said son there was one thing that was
[54:38] left on elijah's altar
[54:41] he said it was dust
[54:44] and i said
[54:45] what's dust represent
[54:47] he said it's when you think you're
[54:49] beyond it
[54:51] but the remnant of it is
[54:53] the dust of the offense
[54:55] is still laying in my wife's life at
[54:57] times
[54:59] you know why because the original
[55:01] offense is gone but the behavior that
[55:03] the offense caused still lives on today
[55:11] but what was the cure for it
[55:15] fire
[55:20] let the god
[55:22] who is god
[55:23] answer
[55:24] by fire
[55:28] see god don't want you halfway
[55:31] he don't want you three-fourths
[55:35] he wants you
[55:36] all he wants you whole
[55:39] he just don't want you to believe the
[55:41] message he wants you to be come
[55:44] the message
[55:45] she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of
[55:49] his bone
[55:56] we need fire
[56:02] i thought about it how
[56:04] that our own self-will keeps us many
[56:06] times
[56:08] at the altar of offense
[56:10] our thoughts keep us
[56:11] at an altar of offense
[56:14] bitterness
[56:15] grudges
[56:17] the past
[56:19] our own abilities our knowledge our
[56:21] wisdom
[56:23] our length of time and the message
[56:26] like there's some tenure
[56:28] i said the 11th hour worker debunks that
[56:31] one
[56:36] our hurt feelings our doctrines our own
[56:38] understanding
[56:42] let me give you a testimony and i'm
[56:43] closing with this right here
[56:47] i read this book
[56:49] listen to it called unoffendable
[56:56] and oh it was so awesome
[56:59] until it came to tim's doorstep
[57:03] until it began to walk down
[57:05] my avenue
[57:11] there's something that's been off
[57:12] between me and my wife for a very long
[57:14] time
[57:16] was
[57:18] a very long time
[57:20] so we almost couldn't talk to one
[57:22] another about anything without getting
[57:23] upset
[57:26] you think the preacher's immune to that
[57:29] no
[57:31] we're all humanity
[57:33] we all have the same faults and failures
[57:35] as a sinner
[57:37] as a denominational believer
[57:39] we're all we're all in this thing
[57:41] together
[57:42] the only reason you see the message is
[57:44] because god chose you to see the message
[57:48] that's it
[57:50] when others walk away why have you
[57:52] stayed because you've been predestinated
[57:54] to stay
[57:56] it's not because you believe a certain
[57:58] doctrine it's because you've been
[58:00] predestinated to stay right where you're
[58:02] at
[58:03] where else can you go you have the words
[58:05] to eternal life lord
[58:10] but i was sick i got sick a while back
[58:13] and my wife wasn't feeling well
[58:17] and so
[58:18] i had a brother to church he's a
[58:20] minister in the deacon there and he took
[58:21] the service and
[58:23] after his wonderful service and
[58:26] after service he called he said hey we
[58:28] want to come by and pray for your wife
[58:29] aside i said we might have omnicron
[58:31] whichever variant it was i said we may
[58:33] have it i said so he said well i don't
[58:35] care he said i've never been around all
[58:36] that stuff and i said well come on if
[58:38] you want to come i'll take your prayer
[58:39] come and pray
[58:41] and so when he got there
[58:43] he began to talk
[58:45] and both of the deacons they came and
[58:47] they put their hands on me and my wife
[58:51] and i reached out and took her hand
[58:54] and when i began to pray
[58:56] i began to realize
[58:59] how offended i was at her
[59:05] and when i prayed for her the way i've
[59:06] never prayed for her
[59:08] as though i would pray for another
[59:10] sister in the lord
[59:13] are you with me now
[59:17] when they left we looked at each other
[59:19] and we both immediately recognized
[59:22] that thing was gone between us that
[59:23] don't mean the devil ain't tried to come
[59:24] back
[59:26] but i'm gonna show you the power
[59:28] when something is released
[59:32] i just know when god does something for
[59:34] me i'm just going to tell somebody about
[59:35] it
[59:37] we go to church on a wednesday night
[59:39] brother dwayne jackson had ministered
[59:40] for us
[59:41] i got up after and this was burning on
[59:43] my heart where god had released us from
[59:46] this offense
[59:48] what most people didn't know what the
[59:49] church didn't know for two or three
[59:51] years my wife had had a garter that was
[59:53] growing on the inside
[59:56] of her throat
[59:57] getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
[59:58] bigger we weren't sure what we were
[1:00:01] going to do about it
[1:00:03] it's real easy when you're at an altar
[1:00:05] of faith and not an altar of offense to
[1:00:07] have faith
[1:00:09] when you're not mad at somebody it's
[1:00:11] easy to have
[1:00:12] faith and so she said honey on the way
[1:00:15] to church she said babe she said i still
[1:00:17] feel this thing she said i don't have to
[1:00:19] swallow now it's it's getting bigger
[1:00:23] i just put my hand over on her and i
[1:00:24] didn't even pray i said well lord i said
[1:00:26] you're still the same god that when
[1:00:28] women would come up through your
[1:00:30] prophet's prayer line that garters would
[1:00:32] disappear that's all i said
[1:00:34] it didn't go away right then
[1:00:37] but we got the church that night
[1:00:39] and after service
[1:00:41] i gave my heart for five minutes after
[1:00:43] the brother preached to the church
[1:00:45] and i told him i said the bible said
[1:00:47] these signs shall follow them that
[1:00:49] believe
[1:00:51] i asked my wife i said would you come
[1:00:52] off the organ and let us lay hands on
[1:00:54] you i said let's ministers and i said no
[1:00:56] if you're a believer
[1:00:58] i said i want you to lay hands on my
[1:00:59] wife
[1:01:00] are you with me see this ain't just a
[1:01:02] one-man ministry this ain't your
[1:01:04] favorite preacher i'm real sorry if you
[1:01:06] got favorites
[1:01:08] uh and you can't do that
[1:01:10] you can't do that
[1:01:11] it's moved from the ministry into the
[1:01:14] body or it must be
[1:01:16] that don't mean you'll get up here and
[1:01:17] preach because if you don't have a gift
[1:01:19] you won't do that but the word has moved
[1:01:21] from here down to there it cannot stay
[1:01:24] here only
[1:01:25] it's got to go out with you and
[1:01:27] reproduce itself every seed
[1:01:31] must bring forth of its own kind if it's
[1:01:33] a bride if it's the word it's going to
[1:01:35] reproduce another bride
[1:01:39] within three seconds of the whole church
[1:01:42] laying hands on my wife's
[1:01:46] body one on the other those who could
[1:01:49] reach or put their hands on her
[1:01:51] i heard her scream she's
[1:01:53] quiet woman she ain't a screamer she
[1:01:54] ain't a shouter
[1:01:56] i i like emotion because you got to have
[1:01:59] some emotion you're dead
[1:02:03] i watched the spirit god hit her and she
[1:02:05] dropped
[1:02:06] i'm like well praise i was getting ready
[1:02:08] to have the church to pray the spirit of
[1:02:09] the lord swept into the building
[1:02:12] we worshiped for 15 minutes after it was
[1:02:14] over she said can i testify
[1:02:17] i said sure she said when the hands were
[1:02:19] laid on me within three seconds it
[1:02:21] disappeared
[1:02:23] but you know what
[1:02:25] do you know where it got started from
[1:02:28] is when i stop being offended
[1:02:32] when i let the fire of god come into tim
[1:02:35] hayden's heart
[1:02:37] and take me from the altar of offense
[1:02:39] and put me back at the altar of faith
[1:02:42] then i could say all things
[1:02:45] are possible
[1:02:48] you know what i'm going to say this as
[1:02:50] you get ready to come whoever's going to
[1:02:51] come
[1:02:52] musicians come
[1:02:57] when we stay
[1:02:59] at the altar of
[1:03:00] offense and we will not allow the holy
[1:03:03] spirit to move us to the altar of faith
[1:03:06] we're defrauding
[1:03:08] our spiritual husband
[1:03:10] from working
[1:03:11] the bible says defraud you not one
[1:03:13] another we look at husbands and wife
[1:03:14] what she's defrauding he's defrauding
[1:03:17] but what about
[1:03:19] the frauding going on like this
[1:03:21] are you with me
[1:03:23] as you play the song let your word be
[1:03:25] born let's just bow our heads
[1:03:30] with me if you will
[1:03:33] father
[1:03:36] lord i know what you put upon my heart
[1:03:38] but not knowing
[1:03:41] how to bring it out
[1:03:45] god you're
[1:03:47] the god who can be touched by the
[1:03:48] feeling of
[1:03:51] every infirmity in her heart and life
[1:03:57] where my heart's been delivered this
[1:03:58] morning
[1:04:02] you know the needs lord
[1:04:06] maybe there was not none here this
[1:04:07] morning that needed maybe we just needed
[1:04:09] a reminder
[1:04:11] i don't know lord
[1:04:13] but father if there's one that
[1:04:16] needs what may you walk up and down the
[1:04:17] aisle this morning
[1:04:20] walk down into the heart say son
[1:04:22] daughter
[1:04:24] i will move you from the altar
[1:04:27] of offense to the altar of faith if
[1:04:29] you'll just
[1:04:30] let me do it right now
[1:04:32] if you just surrender everything that
[1:04:33] you are
[1:04:35] i gave everything for you
[1:04:41] now give it all to me and i'll take care
[1:04:43] of it at this point
[1:04:49] if he's speaking to your heart this
[1:04:50] morning don't don't push him away don't
[1:04:52] resist him
[1:04:54] allow him to take a hold of it
[1:04:59] give you a testimonial
[1:05:01] preach this in another
[1:05:03] place another state another church
[1:05:06] there happened to be a baptist woman
[1:05:07] that was sitting there 74 years of age
[1:05:11] she said preacher i i never heard
[1:05:13] nothing like that in my life she said i
[1:05:15] i thought i was over a lot of stuff
[1:05:18] she said if i had so memories come flood
[1:05:20] him back into my mind that i don't even
[1:05:23] know what to do with them now
[1:05:26] i told her i said sister you heard what
[1:05:28] he said
[1:05:30] let him take control of that offense
[1:05:34] maybe you've held this morning to a
[1:05:35] particular doctrinal belief from the
[1:05:37] message
[1:05:39] and you fought over it you squabbled
[1:05:40] over
[1:05:43] i'm urging you to release that this
[1:05:44] morning
[1:05:46] to let the holy spirit walk down into
[1:05:48] your life and say lord
[1:05:50] if i have to start all over
[1:05:53] from the basis i will do that
[1:05:56] because i want to be right before you
[1:05:58] and write with you in my
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] walk just released it to him this
[1:06:05] morning
[1:06:08] in jesus name we ask him
[1:06:12] sing this with me i may sing a little
[1:06:14] different than you but this i know this
[1:06:16] where this song came from but it's a
[1:06:17] very
[1:06:18] special song to me because i believe
[1:06:20] this is what it's about
[1:06:22] is that we let
[1:06:24] his word
[1:06:25] be born
[1:06:26] in the mangers no it no no when they
[1:06:28] wrote it never said it in our minds
