we have a very special agent with us today agent Ashley and she is going to tell us how she became a special agent for God so let's listen carefully okay hi kids are you ready to hear my song [Music] [Music] he called me by my name I was chosen for a mission and my life has never been the same [Music] for me [Music] cause I'm a special agent of God Caleb [Music] they believe in God's plan [Music] [Music] for me [Music] cause I'm a special agent of God all my special plans for me to prosper ous [Music] so I can always be [Music] switching of God [Music] I'm a special message [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] you must uh you must be Celeste sit down and act natural congratulations over the miles you've been chosen for a mission yes oh really um what what oh sorry one mission agent Morris you've been chosen by the chief director himself for mission 316. this Mission should you choose to accept it we'll require you travel to the four corners of the world and find four hand-picked special agent recruits must return this formula before the ending forces get enough um wait enemy forces what are you talking about um I didn't know this was going to be dangerous agent miles it is perfectly normal to be nervous on your first mission but God will be with you the chief director would like you to share this formula for the new recruits and then get them back to headquarters so then they begin their training as soon as possible even though this is your first mission it is critical and essential to the future of the world this is a life or death matter this Mission success could mean the transformation of the world as we know it here look at this I think about the content of the formula to be quite surprising top secret whoa am uh am I reading that right the only content in the formula this says l-o-v-e love love yes that's correct but it's not just any kind of love it's a special kind it's the only thing that can save us it brings eternal life to those who choose to receive it [Music] um so that means we have a choice miles God is not a bully he gives his love freely to save us but it is our choice whether or not we want to accept the formula there is however a man named Dr Diablo who is a bully he's been sabotaging our efforts and no doubt that causing trouble among the new recruits he has a few dead beats to send me here's a few dead beats he sends out to do his dirty work but the formula in this Caster will help you reach the neighborhoods see Dr Diablo has produced many different kinds of love as a substitute for God's love but he's never been able to come up with anything quite like the love of God so that's why this formula is so special yes see this kind of love was so powerful that it caused God to risk his own son's life on a Mission of Hope for the entire world for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so wait what you're saying is this mission this goes all the way back to God yes and this formula has also withstood the test of time you will start to see the changes that the formula will create in the lives of the recruits as soon as you share it with them their countenances they will change they will find themselves with more strength to overcome the enemy and they will find themselves loving others the way Christ loved them dude are you hearing this we better get back and tell Dr right away it's away this is a pretty big mission um are you sure I'm the man for the job deep director is never wrong about who he chooses miles if he has chosen you you can know with confidence that this this is what you are called to do and he will give you everything you need to be successful on your mission everything including this formula yes [Music] you know what I accept oh wait I I accept good now go buy a hot dog uh wait wait what did what did you say I repeat go buy a hot dog um there's one problem uh I just ate and I'm not hungry patience miles go buy a hot dog I found a hot dog where do I go oh a hot dog uh hello there excuse me hello excuse me hello there oh uh hello uh I'd uh I'd like two hot dogs hold the ketchup what are you talking about you will need much more than hot dogs to accomplish the mission you're going there oh wait how'd you know that what headquarters wants you to be prepared for anything miles so I'm here to make sure you have everything you need and give you four of our latest state of the art devices that will help make your mission be success are you listening to me oh yep you got it now this is the new btpd which stands for Bluetooth career device okay it gives you a direct connection to headquarters no matter where you are you stay in constant communication with them and things get really crazy out there you can use this to call him back up you just press this button right there [Music] next generally submission email me you must study this book every day it contains training from the director himself if you do what it says you'll have to pout and strength you need to complete this mission do you understand yeah oh yeah the next item it's a pair of glasses Sunglasses to be exact ly these are the son-500 AKA The Son of God glasses does he pass what a person looks like on the outside and let you see what is in their heart this would not only help you identify the other special agents you were looking for you also ensure that you recognize that enemy forces are around [Music] what's oh yeah I agree last but not least here is your Smartwatch terrific we're gonna did it oh oh yes this little guy will help you determine between what is truth and what is lies sometimes we are out there in the world it's hard to tell if something is real and sometimes we get confused just remember that God is not the author of confusion he wants to know the difference between good and bad and not be deceived by the enemy's lies any questions no I'm good I also have a Nifty bag for you to carry all your gadgets and here's this oh what is that that's the hot dogs you ordered God [Music] Mission 316 begins now I'm on a mission wait say that again [Music] I'm on a mission [Music] how about a mission today reporting

foreign you see agent miles took a special formula with him which means Dr Diablo now has the formula for himself we've also received Intel that Dr Diablo plans to dilute the formula and render it powerless but we know that the machine Emmanuel says that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord raises up a standard against him and it also says if we resist the devil he will flee from us and so agents what shall live inside of these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not freely give us all things Romans 8 30 verses who shouts are Brutus from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution of famine or nakedness or Peril or sword nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved it for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord who shall separate us from the love of Christ [Music] dude dude dude what about listening what about this one ready [Music] miles is cool but not cool enough [Music] come on that was so good wait hold up what about this one oh she got the camera I got a great one miles is tied up and yeah yeah [Applause] miles [Music] I assume you know why you're here oh yeah uh they're giving me a haircut dude I like this guy I don't know it okay very funny I need that special formula and I need it now oh but I think I think I remember it being in one of those uh two two looking thingies oh yeah yeah yeah yeah like the like the one you carry like on your shoulders like on like on the shoulder yeah yeah like that I can't also kind of like the one on Asia miles is cool oh yeah right here in this family room oh you bumbling fools bring it here [Music] finally it's mine I have it [Applause] [Music] she was with that formula [Music] you don't know my plan I'm going to change the formula and dilute it people will think they have the formula but it won't have any power and the only reason I'm telling you this is because you won't be around to see the devastating effects I will cause all the entire world that's right I have all the power and you you have nothing that's not true Diablo I have the pure formula within my heart and you know what I've been sharing it with recruits all around the world you will never stop us from sharing the love of God and with that you will never stop the formula we'll see about that but I'm just staring at you fools let's open the canister out with it Safety First I'm evil but I'm a dumb oh okay does it matter no okay accidents here it is I get it yes fear [Music] I'm sorry thank you it's not working on here it's because perfect love perfect Blood cast out all fear [Applause] silence [Music] [Music] I don't want to hear those flashes from that Emmanuel of yours it sickens me yeah hurry up I'll try something else add some hate that will work either because love love is kind I said be quiet Rick try some selfishness [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] it's not working if you hold this for me please watch us hold it what do we have what he's a dangerous what do you do here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] come on [Applause] foreign ERS although you're returning from Mission 316 we must find comfort in the effect that he accomplished his mission with great success his mission was to travel to the four corners of the world spreading the special formula and to bring the four of you to us please for this great accomplishment we will always be grateful we've been able to reach agent months since we lost contact with him in Asia but we must have faith that somehow he will make it back to headquarters safely in the meantime here is a specialty brief message from the chief director himself [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] you have each been chosen to be an Elite member a special agent in the most powerful force he will be asked to take an oath to make a definite commitment to accept this position and we'll also need to learn to use each of the tools that have been given you so that each one of you will also be able to defeat the enemy in every situation now do you have a question [Music] served I have one concern the secret formula it was with agent miles the secret formula with Dr Diablo that is no concern because the enemy is unable to put it into action for it only works on those who have faith that is no concern now purpose of the mission from which you have just returned yes sir what is it for God so loved the world that whosoever believeth on him [Music] but but have everlasting life [Music] foreign yes that is true but do you know what that means do you know what that means for God so loved the world [Music] so loved the world that he wanted to share his love with the world and the only way for God to do that of Heaven come to Earth be born on the manger in Jesus Christ and wherever Jesus Christ went preaching healings followed Miracles followed Deliverance is followed the force of Darkness were pushed back many were drawn to him who for many years had carried their sorrows had carried their own burdens their pains in their heart their disappointments and they came these men and women who came to him they became his disciples what we would call today in our drama they became his special agents and you know what Jesus Christ is still looking for disciples today still today now today we've talked about a special formula and I want to introduce you to most sacred formula there has ever been and that is the formula of God's love where crew 3 come forward [Applause] here we have and this bottle purplish liquid this represents the sin in each one of our hearts if we were to take that liquid and pour it over my white shirt it would stain terribly we couldn't get that out that is exactly what sin does in our hearts but we have sin in our hearts we're miserable we're angry we're frustrated we have pain we cause pain and God never created us [Music] inhabitors of sin to be the Tabernacles of sin God created us to be the Tabernacle of his presence but that's how we're born how can we [Music] hives we try many ways to overcome it in our own strength but how can it if we have our hearts closed the sacred formula being in church being in the right situation I could pour it on there and it does absolutely nothing I have the right formula of the love of God but to a heart that is closed it does nothing once opened our hearts hard Opening Our Hearts we have to admit I can't do it on my own Lord and we open our [Music] open our hearts it meant Lord I am a sinner I have carried my griefs my pains long enough I don't want him anymore Lord I want your formula the love of God to come into my heart and when that happened a miracle takes place The Impossible happens as God's love comes into the sinful heart that sin is transformed and removed and we become white as snow thank you why why would we want to keep sin in our hearts all it takes is open up our hearts Lord Jesus I've had enough I can't do it on my own would you come inside amen and every person you today I ask you that have you kept your hearts closed for too long you don't have to and you've been miserable for too long carrying your own weights and sins you don't have to go another moment longer I invite you open your heart let us pray Heavenly Father you are the chief's director who has designed the life that we live the course that we go on oh God and Lord we've heard today about the special sacred formula of God's love we were created not to hide sin and be miserable inside [Music] of your and of your peace your joy oh Diablo will try to give us every single counterfeit but they are fake person adult everyone is there anyone here who says yes I've been fooled by Diablo too long I want to open my heart to God's love love and ask Jesus Christ to become my savior anyone like your that today say yes would you please pray for me I would like to have Jesus and [Music] God bless you Heavenly Father you see these hearts I pray that this become much more than the drama it's more than the end of a presentation they had become the beginning of a life Lord I pray that you would come in each one of us fill us with your spirit and your love we ask in the name of your son in Jesus Christ amen amen agent miles well done
