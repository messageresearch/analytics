Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. could tell a story. If my life would sing a song, [Music] if I have a testimony, if I have anything at all, [Music] No one ever like &gt;&gt; his faithful hand me all this way. And when I'm old and gray, all my days are numbered on the earth. Let it be known in you alone my joy was found. Lord, you are my joy. [Music] Let my children tell their children. [Music] And let this be their memory. [Music] That all my treasure was in heaven. [Music] Lord, you were everything to me. [Music] No one ever like his faithful hand this way. [Music] All my days are numbered on the earth. Let it be in you alone. My joy was found. [Music] Lord, you are my joy. [Music] Still in love. You're still for me, [Music] still all I want. You're still my everything. [Music] I'm still in love. You're still enough for me. You are still all I want. You're still my everything. I'm still in love. You're still enough for me. You are. You are still all I want. [Music] You're still my everything. No one ever cared for me like Jesus. His faithful hand has held me all this way. And when I'm old, all my days are numbered on the earth. Let it be in you alone. My joy was found. Matthew chapter 6. We'll just pick it up. There's so many good things in here, but we'll just have a section here. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret. and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. And then further in prayer, when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking. It's not quantity of words, it's the quality of words. It's not just that you're praying, but it's the faith behind your prayer. And this is speaking of an effective prayer. How many this morning want a effective prayer when you pray? And and so then he says, "Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask. After this manner, therefore pray ye. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. And that's usually how we end it when we repeat the Lord's prayer here, but it's not finished yet. It says in verse 14, "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you." Forgiveness is part of the faith of your prayer. But if you forgive not men your trespasses, neither will your father forgive your trespasses. Mark 11 uh the mountain moving faith and speaking to the mountain in verse 11 and verse um 23. Verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea, and shalt not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith cometh to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, what things soever ye desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them. And when you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. There's trespasses again that's mentioned. But if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. I want to speak this morning on the word removing the trespasses to move mountains. Faith and the prayer of faith is linked in both of these texts with forgiveness and the word uh releasing trespasses and so I want to talk about that this morning because these two places link our faith with the forgiveness of our heart. And there are many other places that I want to get to that the scripture brings these things in. And whenever you're talking about faith, you must speak about the whole picture of faith so that we can be in a position of faith and that we can be the right heart for more faith to work through us and God to anoint our faith. We must position ourselves to have perfect faith. And we must, as the scriptures uh showing us, we must for mountainoving faith, we must acknowledge the things that would be in our heart, the aunt that we have against others or the trespasses either that we have done towards God or towards other people or that people have trespassed against us. We cannot approach faith the right way until we approach the the subject of forgiveness and releasing of trespasses. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And this is another scripture that shows this because in this particular scripture they they came the disciples as they were watching Jesus pray they came to him after he was done praying and said Lord teach us to pray. Now the sun the Sunday school has got the theme this month of prayer. So, I want to be working in coordination with that as they teach their children about prayer and what prayer is and that we should pray. What a powerful thing to teach children. Can you say amen? That they have access to God, that they can speak to the Lord, that they don't have to go through a priest, but they can utter things from their hearts straight to him and they can hear back from him. Isn't that a wonderful thing? This is the Christian journey. This is what it's all about. It's not about oh what we wear or church order and these other things but it's that I want to live a life that when I go to God I can pray a whole through to heaven and he can hear my prayer and he can answer back to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now uh the word uh trespass is brought into these. And so now they came and asked Jesus, teach us to pray. Lord, would you teach us to pray? Because they had learned. Why are they asking Jesus to teach us to pray? Because they had learned his prayer got through to God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; They had watched his life. They had watched this vessel. They had been around him. And when and when he's over there in the corner and he's bowed at his knees and he's praying maybe for an hour or two hours and they left him alone. They knew these prayers had a different thing. Now I want to I want you to notice something. I don't think that the disciples had never prayed before and that's why they were asking him teach us how to pray. These were Jews. These the Jews prayed to God. They prayed to Jehovah. They knew that they that that was part of their lives to pray. They went into the temple and they prayed and and and and so uh it's it's not they were asking to teach us to pray because they didn't pray, but they knew God's Jesus prayers got through. &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus prayers got through. And and you know, if you ask people in the world, you know, that's the thing is that everybody prays. And that's a good thing. I'm not being critical of it. But if you ask a sinner, sometimes they'll say to you, unless they're an atheist and don't believe in God, "Yeah, I pray every day. I'm always praying to God." And so prayer is a common thing to speak to the Lord and and all these other things. But you see now believers today, we have to look at it a little deeper than just saying a prayer. How many knows there's a difference in saying a prayer and praying? &gt;&gt; How many knows there's a difference in just saying a prayer at your meal or something like that? That's wonderful. you should do that. But there is a difference in saying a prayer and sometimes even a an orthodox prayer, a prayer that's a repetitive prayer and it's the same prayer that you repeat and it becomes a tradition. That's a big difference in somebody entering into real prayer. &gt;&gt; And praying the prayer of faith &gt;&gt; and I don't mean to make it something complicated, but we must find the prayer of faith &gt;&gt; especially in the hour that we live in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm just going to say it to you. We are dealing in troublesome times. &gt;&gt; We are experiencing demon power like I've never seen it before. &gt;&gt; And if you are engaged in the battle and serving the Lord and believing this word and standing with it every day and trying, then you're facing things that you never faced before. The devil, as soon as you make a step, the devil's going to fight against it. And besides this, there's darkness upon the earth, but also on the minds of the people. There's an oppression. There's a depression. There's there's an oppressing uh spirits that come against you to bring darkness into your life that you can't even have joy anymore. You can't even enjoy moments anymore. We're living under an oppression. Can you say amen? And there is no theology, there is no psychology that is strong enough to pierce the darkness of this mental depression. It takes prayer of faith to pray a hole through to the sky. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes getting a hold of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so they prayed before, but they said, "Lord, teach us to pray." And I believe a believer has hunger, especially when he sees here a prayer that showed results. I believe it's the believers that they wanted to say a prayer like Jesus to be able to get results. They they said, "Teach us to pray." And it didn't mean that they didn't mean that we haven't ever prayed before. Doesn't mean the world says they pray. No, that means they were hungry for this kind of results from the father. What's happening? Uh teach me what's happening, Lord, when you pray. What? Something happens. Your prayer is getting through. Uh something happens when you pray. Something happens when you speak. There's a power behind you. And listen now. Jesus had thousands of people around him watching this go on. And none of them desired to come and ask Jesus to to teach us to pray. But believers when they see that, they say, "Lord, there's something in me. Teach me that I can pray this way. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord. I I I want to I want to grow. It's only believers saying that. The rest of the world say, "I'll just say my prayers and I'm fine with that." But believers are saying, "No, no, I want my prayers to get through. I want to hear back from God." Can I get an amen this morning? We need a God that shows up and answers back. We got too many young people without the Holy Ghost. We got too many oppressing spirits. We got too many mental battles. I'm telling you, we need a God that answers back. We got too many devils fighting against families, fighting against marriages. We got too much upon us just to have church and just to have a religion. We've got to have the prayer of faith that gets through. And I believe this is what we're going to learning to depend on as the days are coming. &gt;&gt; The economy is going to fall apart. We got brothers that's feeling the pressure in this congregation, having to work second and third jobs, might even have to put the wife to work, things like this. We got grocery prices up 60%. We've got all this damage and it's it's not prophesied to get any better. So, we got pressures that are still coming. We're hoping for a relief, and I pray there is, too. But listen now, if it if it if there's not a relief to some of the pressure and the insecurity of jobs and income and everything else, we're going to have to learn to depend on something. Come on now. &gt;&gt; It's easy if you got a really good job right now. You're making good money. It's easy. Okay. Yeah, I I know. But see, when you feel the crunch of it, &gt;&gt; we will be driven into a spot to depend on God like we've never depended on him before. &gt;&gt; And I want to be positioned that my prayer counts. &gt;&gt; Now, I know God hears our prayer, but we we can read that. God hears our prayer. But what we need a God that answers back. We need a God who answers back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so now uh you know when sons, let me just stop here a minute. When sons of God are coming back to Jesus and asking him to teach us, you know what that says? That shows that they there are sons that want to move to their position and to adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because adoption, adopted son. And how many know there's a difference in a birth of a son and an adoption of a son. There's some ministers that speak it. When you're born again and you receive the Holy Ghost, you're a fully adopted son. I don't think there's enough scripture to support that or message. I believe you're birthed into the kingdom and you grow to an adopted son. The very reason you have the Holy Ghost is to bring you to maturity and adoption and bring you to a rapture. You won't make a rapture without the Holy Ghost. But when you receive the Holy Ghost, it is the spirit of adoption to take you to adoption. And part of the thing of adoption is the separation between is this a son who's teachable from the father to learn, Lord, I want to do what you do. Now, there's nothing wrong with a son saying to Jesus, I you're the son of God. You're the only begotten son, but I want to do what you're doing. I want the faith that you have. I want you to teach me how to be that kind of son. I want you to teach me how to pray like you're praying. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You might not feel worthy to ask that, but sons, God has made you worthy to ask the father. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm teachable. &gt;&gt; Adopted sons are teachable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember he brings that whole thing out of, you know, in the Old Testament, the Hebrews, the boy when he was young, he was a son born into a family, but then he's put under a tutor to train him and teach him the father's way, teach him the father's business. And if it's a son that was rebellious, he's still a son. He's still a son, but it's like he could rebel for years. I don't want that to I don't want to become like that. I want to do something else. But when once the son becomes teachable, then the tutor can come back and report to the father and say, "How's my boy? How's my boy by? He's so teachable. He's so He's wanting to learn. He's wanting to learn the business of the father. He's wanting to become like you. Can you say amen? And when he shows that teachable spirit, somewhere along the line, there's an adoption ceremony to say, "This son, I am pleased with." How many you know there was an adoption ceremony with Jesus, &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; And what was the adoption? The adoption wasn't just a feeling and build three tabernacles. In fact, God said, "Don't build Peter, James." No, we're not building tabernacles. We're not building a system to oursel. This is about adoption. I'm pleased with my son to fill him completely. This is my son in whom I'm well pleased. This is my desire. So, it's not a problem for you to come and ask the father to teach you. You know why the disciples could feel comfortable doing that? Because all along Jesus said, "The works that I do shall you do also. He kept dropping this in and saying, "Now, I'm doing this, but the works I need to do, all the sons will do those works." &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Don't get quiet on me this morning. This is the word of God. And I'm talking about you. I'm talking about you. Not somebody sitting next to you. I'm talking about you. If we're sons, we're in a different category. And if we're teachable, he'll teach us to position oursel in faith to bring the prayer of faith. &gt;&gt; When you lay your hands on that child with a fever, you pray the pray the prayer of faith. &gt;&gt; And so they could ask because Jesus kept hinting and saying, "Listen, what I'm doing, where I go, you will go also." He's telling the sons, "Whatever I'm doing." So that must have been a stir in their hearts to say, "I am a son. I believe I'm a son and I will do the things that he will do." And sons that are trainable are humble. They're humble to admit they're wrong. &gt;&gt; Adopted sons that are trainable and wanting to move to adoption. Their sons are trainable. They're humble. They admit they are wrong. They admit I have been doing things for the Lord maybe even for years but I want to go deeper. Here's another thing adopted sons do in their in their teachableness and that is uh you know they want the will of God. They want to be truly led by the will of God because they've learned in their immaturity. They made decisions in their life sometimes that they called the will of God but they found out it wasn't it was my own will. sons that come and sober up to say, "Wait a minute. I'm a son of God here. Lord, teach me how to mature because I have learned not only do I want to be taught to pray the prayer of faith, but I want to walk truly in the will of God. I want to walk like Jesus." He said, "I do nothing except my father shows me." &gt;&gt; I want to live that kind of life that I do nothing except my father shows me in heaven. And I know he's seen it by vision, but we catch the vision of what God wants to do for his will. We want to walk in his will because we've experienced maybe what it is to walk out of his will. Or sometimes the famous line that comes from people, I'm a good person. I pray uh you know how many sinners have justified themselves to say, I pray to God all the time, but there's no change. There's no change in their prayer. And then sons are teachable to come and say, Lord, I I I want to walk in your will. I want to be uh uh in not only pray the right prayer of faith, but I want to walk um it's a son that's saying that it's immature sons that that that is that is uh trying to always fight for their own will. Can you say amen? And trying to make it God's will, but they're saying, "I I truly want God's will." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Sons are teachable. sons do not no longer want to say and you know God gets blamed for a lot of things that we do wrong &gt;&gt; because it's God told me to do this and God told me to do that and God to hear a lot of that attaching God to it it's fine but you better make sure God's really led you to do that &gt;&gt; because we feel more comfortable we bring God in God into it and guess what your counselor your pastor is not going to come up against to try to correct you when you say God told you to do it &gt;&gt; I back off I don't want to be coming against God. But how many times years down the road we were and God gets blamed for a lot of stuff we did? &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness this morning? Can I get some people that admit to sometimes doing this? &gt;&gt; We attach. We better be careful that we don't attach so things to God. We better make sure. But mature sons want to say, "Lord, mature me that I'm not just always pursuing. Make me teachable." Especially when there's my prayer. I want to be like Jesus. But most of all, I want my prayer to shake things up. I want my prayer to move the heart of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; There are things that we can do to position oursel to say and do the right thing that will throw God into action. &gt;&gt; The prayer faith shall save the sick. &gt;&gt; The prayer that gets through to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just saying a prayer. &gt;&gt; One day the disciples prayed for an epileptic child and they didn't get any results. In Matthew 17:14, it says, "And when they were come to the multitude, there came him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he's a lunatic and sorvexed, for of times he fall into the fire and often into the water." Matthew 17:16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. Then Jesus answer said, "Oh faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him thither hither to me." And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he departed out of him, and the child was cured from that very hour. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, "Why could we not cast him out?" And Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For verily I say unto you, if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you. How be it this kind goeth not out but by fasting and by prayer. So now you could attach yourself just to the fasting and prayer and say okay I need to do more prayer and more fasting. I believe that doesn't say how much you fast. I believe it's a dedication. It's a positioning yourself to be available to God with all things cleared up from your heart that you could pray the prayer of bringing the impossible God in impossible situations. The disciples weren't there yet. But he says because of your unbelief there's still too much in your heart. There's still too much there. And he says but when you pray you can move mountains. You know he's hinting you're going to come to this. &gt;&gt; Oh praise the Lord. You're going to come to this kind of faith. You're going to come and when you do you could say mountain be removed and cast into the sea and nothing shall be impossible. Nothing shall be impossible to you. They were not there yet. Of course, they needed the Holy Ghost which would bring them faith in their part to speak to mountains. But he didn't say, "Oh, you know, Jesus didn't say when they come to him and they prayed for this epileptic and nothing happened." Jesus did not say, "Oh, you guys are you're losers. You'll never get this. You will never have this." No. He said, "You don't have perfect faith yet, but you will get it if your position is right and you know who you are. standing with a token. Nothing shall stand before your prayer. Nothing shall be impossible to you. I'm I'm preaching the right kind of faith to you this morning. The disciples said, "We want this kind of faith." But they had they hadn't grown to it yet. But he didn't say, "You're a bunch of losers. You're never going to catch this. I'm so disappointed. I'm going to call call Zip Recruiter and get some more disciples. I'm getting online with Zip Recruiter and I've got to find 12 more disciples." He didn't say that. &gt;&gt; He said you're going to grow into this. Can you say amen? You're going to come into this faith, too. My brother and sister, I don't care what the devil has told you this week. If you're a son of God, you're going to come into perfect faith. We just know how need to know how to position ourselves &gt;&gt; for this kind of faith. You know, there's people that walk into this church sometimes and you got a lot of past on you and a lot of clouds and things and it's such a heavy load. It's such a it's it's a mountain. You know, it's interesting Jesus uses mountains because that's probably one of the most unremovable things you could remove. &gt;&gt; But that's what's he going to use for things in your life. Cuz he didn't talk about us moving to literal mountains. As I told you, my wife's from Tennessee and she would be have moved all the Smoky Mountains up here to Michigan by now if it was literal mountains. And I would have helped her with my faith. It's not literal mountains. But Jesus is trying to show you how powerful this is. Because the stuff you go through, it's it seems impossible. &gt;&gt; A mountain, moving a mountain and casting it to the sea. What are you talking about? He wanted you to know nothing is impossible with God. &gt;&gt; No family member has gone too far that the prayer of faith somewhere down the line is going to catch that child, catch that husband, catch that wife. You don't need to look at the circumstances. You need to look at what Jesus said to his sons. Nothing shall be impossible to your prayer &gt;&gt; for watching our service today.
