encourage you today [Music] come and clean all the secrets he had kept from her so long are finally [Music] known her big mistake it's that one regret that haunts her to this day it just won't fade so many different stories we thought could not be redeemed but it's against our darkest failures we start to see the beauty of the blood the goodness of his grace the mercy undeserved that could never be explained Heaven's best takes all our SPS for the worst in all of us that's the glory of the Cross The Wonder of his love that's the beauty of the blood [Music] what a [Music] thought just a single drop forever wipes away our every stain and with it power every chain that has us bound lights at our feet and we stand free that's the beauty of the blood the goodness of his grace the mercy UND deserted that can never be explained Heaven's rest takes all our scars for the worst in all of us that's the glory of the cross the one of his love that's the beauty of the [Music] blood when you get news from the doctor that you hoped you'd never hear and fear sets in but then the [Music] word like a standard it cries out do not fear for you are heal that's the beauty of the blood the goodness of this Grace the mercy on deserted that could never be explained Heaven's best has paid the price for our healing by his stripes that's the glory of the Cross The Wonder of his love that's the glory of the Cross The Wonder of his love that's the beauty of of the [Music] blood the beauty of the blood amen Psalms chapter 112 a just the two just the two verses chapter 112 and 7 and 8 he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies I like to title this not afraid of bad news because this is how this brother in the scripture is living this uh believer and I'm so impressed with all the scriptures before it and afterward to talk about his strength and the favor of the Lord that he has and he's so blessed in so many ways he's prospering in so many ways and that's because he fears the Lord he respects the Lord he respects his Commandments he respects the word he walks in those precepts and though thus he becomes a a blessed man nevertheless even though he's a blessed man even though he's a prosperous man even though things are going good because he fears the Lord uh it did not mean that he would not be given evil Tidings that's what it says in verse 7 he even though he's blessed and he's prospered and has so many good things he's still going to receive evil Tidings well why is that well probably because he lives in the same he lived in the same world we live in and that is you're not going to get back by without uh evil Tidings coming to you which is bad news and everybody sitting here and sitting at home has had bad news come your way and usually it comes at the most unopp ofune times sometimes you feel like that you have done everything right sometimes s you have followed the Lord with all of your heart sometimes we bring that back to God lord I don't understand you're not alone many people in the Bible felt like they did everything right and you know what some people like job did everything right and bad news came to him anyway and so bad news we cannot stop bad news until we're in a Rapture and then bad news will stop can you raise your hand and say now I'm looking forward to the Rapture cuz I'm tired of getting bad news but you will not live a life without getting some bad news every now and then and maybe it's come a lot to you and so this man he's prosperous he's blessed he fears the Lord he's walking there's so many positive things to his life you say this guy doesn't even deserve to get any bad news and yet it says he gets evil Tidings bad news comes to good people sometimes bad news comes to Christians sometimes but what I like about this fellow fow is how he responds responds to the bad news at the very moment that he receives the bad news he is not afraid and why why is that the contrast because bad news brings fear bad news our first reaction is fear we heard something really bad from the doctor we heard something bad from our boss we lost our job you're fired uh whatever it is okay but the but our first reaction oh what am I going to do now uh you you the the doctor says you've got this uh you got this coming and bad news is funny you know the the story that says that the man was at the doctor's office and the doctor said I've got bad news and worse news he said my I'll take the bad news first he said you're you're only going to live for 24 hours he said what what could be the worst news he said I I I found out yesterday I should have told you yesterday 24 hours ago so but that's it sometimes it just keeps coming doesn't it and sometimes it comes when we feel like we don't deserve it but here there's a a a brother here that is is fixed in his heart the Bible says is his heart is fixed and when our heart is fixed and established then it is not afraid of evil Tidings it's not afraid of bad news um in other words it does not get us all wound up it doesn't get us all scared of the bad news and why is it that we could have the ability to live that way that our first reaction cuz remember I said our first reaction is fear if we let it grip us our first thoughts my what are we going to do about this what are we going to do so that's our first reaction but this Fell's first reaction is he's not afraid of bad news he's not afraid of it in other words he's stabilized his heart to the place that I'm not going to react first out of fear I'm going to just wait for a moment and see what this is and he's got a lot of confidence in his heart you know why because when you serve a god of Resurrection ction power you know that God can eventually turn bad news into good news he's probably holding in his heart uh that confidence in God that God's going to watch over him no matter what the bad news is if he was in the New Testament he could refer back to Romans where it says all things work together for the good that love God and are chosen according to his purpose all things and so now that's why he stands there without a fear overtaking him because the bad news can turn out to good news praise the Lord so he he's been stabilized the reason he can be is he been stabilized on the word and uh it's as I preached Sunday he his his heart is following the security that has come to his soul it is anchored Hebrews 6:19 says which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that Within in The Veil The hope that we have as a Believer has an anchor we have an we have hope as an anchor and it's not out here as we look at the Old Testament Tabernacle it's within the veil it's not out here because if our Hope was out here we wouldn't be anchored but it's not where the elements are it's not outside it's not the bad news of the world it's not the news that we hear from the doctor we're anchored within the veil which is within our soul and that Anchor Holds no matter what storm or news that we get I'm just going to be very simple that the stability of the Soul can hold on and direct the heart to not be so reactive when we get bad news and this is what the Christian is there's something deep within us within the veil that's anchored and the and the heart has to line itself up with the security that is in the soul the hope we has of is an anchor it's not out here or changed or affected by the outside elements it's anchored within the Veil behind that behind the veil is not affected by the elements not affected by the storms that come but The Anchor Holds within the veil but our mind and heart has to Anchor to what the soul is saying our minds and our hearts have to be in line with and be anchored to what the soul is saying cuz your mind and your heart your emotions will will play tricks on you will guide you a different way the rush of fear will overtake you and that's why we said Sunday our hearts have to be in line in line with where our soul is at now I I realize as a minister Soul and Spirit are used interchangeably and heart even is used interchangeably in the Bible so sometimes I speak of the soul and it means the person's Spirit sometimes it'll speak of the heart and it means the soul but then sometimes as I read out Sunday when it speaks of the heart it says uh the heart is deceitful above all things well that's not talking about the soul the soul can't be deceitful but your heart can so that's why I've been preaching it that the other parts of you the mind the spirit the emotions the heart that can be unstable has to come to a stability like is in your soul yeah has to be anchored it has to be as he said here he was fixed his heart was fixed and fixed means to be fastened securely in its position fasten securely in its position when it is then that's how the fear moves away when the bad news comes in when the bad news is presented and the evil Tidings come before you that's when fear is rushed is pushed away and it is fastened in its position just hold study in the soul you're listening to the soul is saying hold study here a minute this is bad news it's really happening but let's just hold study let's just pray let's just take a minute and let's just remember the god that works all things for his good amen let's let's be stable a minute let's let's not uh be getting mad and angry at God I don't deserve this God and all why don't why don't we grow up a little bit and when we get bad news just Just Hold Steady for a minute let's let's wait and see what God is doing can I get an amen tonight when you get your bad news how do you react to it just hold study for a few minutes I don't have enough this week I got a a decrease in my pay and I don't know how I'm going to pay the bills and you receive that from the the office at your job that's the news that you receive we're going to have a lot of bad news but it's how we react to it that's right say Lord I'm just going to hold on to your promise here just a minute and and and and hold on to what God can give us so I want to say a couple things initially here about bad news um you know uh and hearing bad news on the news which we hear a lot of that today and we've always heard a lot of that matter of fact somebody told me about 40 years ago a a new a brand new news company wanted to change things up and set a rule that they would not report anything except positive things on the on the air and they said we're not going to report anything negative we're only reporting the positive you know it never made it to any success at all never made it anywhere so then you ask why well because we are trained more to live in fear and feed on bad news then we are the good so they're only feeding human beings actually what they like to hear because we're so accustomed to it you see and so they're they're not going to that wasn't successful because we have a bent in this world and that is that they're used to dwelling in fear and so they're looking the next thing that brings them fear and they keep feeding on it and feeding on it and it just keeps bringing Their Fear so that they kind of exib but you see now if we were more used to positive all the time then the negative news wouldn't affect as us as much but the reason that why that was not successful is we are trained in this world to live more in fear and to feed on bad news and uh you know so I want to talk about this because I want to be relevant always relevant to the hour that we're living in I want to talk about a little bit about social media and the news and keeping up feeding on those things because that's being relevant we're not 50 years ago now now we're in 2024 and we can safely say that the things that we can easily feed on we can easily surround ourselves with bad news all the time we are exposed to it all the time and sometimes we expose ourself to it sometimes we hang around people that are negative who you hang around is the atmosph osphere they create and so you sometimes you're courteous to people and if you have to be around them a little bit okay I know this is out there but it's hard to spend a lot of time with those people but sometimes we do and uh as you know my son Soloman has told me there's some people they're just show so used to drama in their life and they're so used to the negative in their life that if there's no drama going on they're uncomfortable and the devil knowes that so he just dwells in that realm of negativity and bad news and bad news and then that's how we call the Great Vine we call it the Great Vine we call this uh bad news travel how many knows bad news travels faster than good news exactly does yes because you see it's something within us but it's also something the devil Works in and people hang around that they feed on it and they're around people who talk about it and uh you so what I'm talking about first is that this isn't bad news coming to you this is you going to it so before we talk about surprising bad news that you go oh I never I didn't know that was going to happen you hang around the wrong people you feed on the wrong things you're actually running towards bad news that's really bad news isn't it that's bad news within itself that you're running towards things that are the are negativity that you're putting yourself around it that you're always feeding it on your phone and on your computer and you're going to it it's not coming to you you're going to it so we should deal with that first why does bad news travel faster I looked it up why does bad news travel faster than good news bad news spread so quickly because negativity is a survival Instinct people want to know what's going on in the world and whether it poses a threat to their way of life negativity provokes a strong emotional response make it an effective way for news outlets to engage Their audience they're all about ratings they're all about numbers they're all about how many is going to listen in and that's why that company could not promote positive because the people want to feed on the negativity and and somebody's lying in their pockets because the more we watch it the Richer they get and the more they feed us the bad news so it says it spreads more quickly because negativity is a survival Instinct human beings without the Lord and without something else that's real in their lives they actually it's a survival Instinct people want to know what's going on the world and whether it poses a threat to their way of life people whistling in the graveyard pretending they're not afraid and people are walking whistling in the graveyard of this world CU they know judgment is coming they know they're condemned they know they have no place to take their sin well they do but they won't go there they won't go to the Cross bring their sin with their sin they live in their guilt they know Judgment Day is coming sometimes Sinners know it more than than Christians know there's a judgment day coming because they feel the guilt of it and they know they're not right they know they're headed for hell someday some of them sing songs about it and actually boast that they're heading for hell that's when you're really becoming numb right that's when the world is with a hot iron is seared your conscience the Bible says boy I don't want to become that way you I know where I'm going I'm headed there and and so uh another article says addicted to bad news how Doom scrolling is affecting your mental health I'll let you know what that is here in a minute Doom scrolling it's a new term often find yourself down you often if you often find yourself down the rabbit hole scrolling through negative stories articles and posts for hours on end if the news is making you feel anxious it might be time to unplug from your phone for a while what is Dooms scrolling Doom scrolling is when you do exactly what we describe above sit on your device for long periods of time consuming bad news the term has gained popularity in recent years related to significant events like the covid-19 pandemic the 2020 us election natural disasters and conflicts in the Middle East and in Europe that's what's happening now because social media platforms serve content using algorithms you're more more likely to see content that's similar to content you've engaged in before or that people who share interest or a location with you uh that that you have engaged with this means it's more likely if you've looked at bad news content before and you spent time engaging with it you'll be served more bad news and before you know it your doom scrolling maybe you didn't know that tonight but I'm not trying to attach another title to you but if that's what you're doing you're Dooms scrolling everything's doomsday let me say that we're not called to Doomsday we're not called to tribulation we're not we're called to a Rapture can you say Amen we're called to rapturing Faith right now can I get an amen tonight we're not called where this world is going we're not called where the bad news is going this C is headed to World War II can you say Amen it's headed for disaster can you say Amen we are not called to go down with it we're called to go up we're not on a Titanic that's going down we're on the the The Old Ship of Zion somebody say praise the Lord we're on The Old Ship of Zion and we're headed to Zion we're marching to Zion hallu Hallelujah and so now we can't feed on all this cuz we're not headed in that direction so we don't need to be Doom scrolling like the rest news anxiety hopefully this will be a rebuke to you tonight if you're too involved in all the news but in this world with without God they hear the news this morning they feel unsafe they feel afraid can you say Amen it's just fear upon fear upon fear that's right it goes on to say because social media platforms serve content oh I already read that news anxiety is nothing new but it's on the rise fear and anxiety around the state of the world and possible future scenarios are not limited to the 21st century even ancient texts tell tales of the end of the world or Invaders from far away places the difference today is that our constant access to information particularly news and opinions means we can confirm our fears with a quick online search or by opening our social media apps so you got fear and you feed on of us it confirms fears now who wants to live a life confirming fears how pitiful is that we're actually feeding on things that's confirming our fears fears are not based on any truth so it's like I fear that my I'm going to lose my job I fear the economy is going to crash I fear that I'm not going to be able to get move into this because this may happen to the economy so it's unfounded yet but if you read the news it may confirm your fears right I just friends I just don't know if we should be living here in this kind of atmosphere confirming our fears NE in fact negative content gets twice as much engagement on social media than positive content the psychological effects of excessive consumption of negative or threatening content can be serious especially if you have a pre-existing mental health concerns such as depression or anxiety feelings of fear hopelessness sadness and isolation are all associated with doom scrolling and news anxiety in extreme and in extreme cases the symptoms can your PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder consuming happy or calming content on the other hand can improve a person's Outlook and make them more likely to perceive their own personal challenges in more a positive way the best way to reduce news anxiety sounds real simple but it can be tough to do in practice stop reading bad news I got too much to do for his kingdom you have too much to do for the kingdom of God to be worried about the bad you got too there's too many good things to do there's too much good news in the world there's too many good things that God wants out of your life and he said it in Matthew he says won't the father give us all good things if we ask him he's got a load a motherload of good things to download to you can you say amen God has good things for believers Our God Specializes Joe hoo wrote the song Our God specializes in good things things that you and I really need good things for the body and spirit all you have to do is just believe good things good things are God Specializes in good things we know those songs positive songs but it's it's truth God has good things so we don't want to feed on all the bad what you're feeding on is directly related to The Rush of fears that you will feel that's right in most cases I want to say in most cases cuz some cases anxiety hits and you can't find the source of it you don't know but if you're feeding on the wrong things you can be pretty sure it's contributing to the rush of fear in you yes sir so watch what you're feeding on we get overwhelmed by negative things we get in anxiety we get overwhelmed so if they are using the algorithms that's what you call it they're using our algor algorithms in order to what we're feeding on then they give us more of it they give us more of it they pinpoint you as an individual off your phone there's no privacy they find you they find what you're looking at this ought to tell people if they know what you're looking at God certainly knows what you're looking at and listen they picked up on something you got algorithms you have a certain thing and you have weaknesses and you have strength and if they know that God knows it and the devil knows it and I don't think we should let people just control us like that I don't think we should let the devil control us I think we should let God control us feed on the right things and then he might see send some more good things our way it's not reality that we won't have feelings of fear come around us I I I wouldn't preach that tonight because that would be preaching a perfection in our flesh in other words deny that you feel fear deny that you don't feel have feelings of fear I wouldn't ask you to do that because they are real they're around you but it's that initial reaction of what you're hanging on to and if your heart is stable its first reaction isn't to be given into the fear the rush comes along say Noe hold study right there I'm not going to give into that fear my future belongs to God wouldn't it be good that our first reaction is Faith instead of fear wouldn't it be good if we were built up that we can can handle bad news when it comes and not fear it wouldn't it be good to be living closer to that that we can handle bad news and we're not afraid of evil Tidings thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our
