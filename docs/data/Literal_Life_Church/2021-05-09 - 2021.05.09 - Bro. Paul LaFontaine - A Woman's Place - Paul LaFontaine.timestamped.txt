[0:00] virtuous woman her price
[0:03] is far above rubies the heart of her
[0:07] husband does safely trust in her
[0:09] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[0:13] she will do him good and not evil all
[0:15] the days
[0:16] of her life it's like a long-term
[0:19] relationship to me
[0:21] it's not an overnight thing but all the
[0:23] days of her life she would do
[0:25] him good sure a different message the
[0:29] world gives us
[0:31] she seeketh wool and flax and worketh
[0:34] willingly with her hands
[0:36] she is like the merchant ship she
[0:38] bringeth her food from afar
[0:39] she rises also while it is yet night and
[0:42] giveth meat to her household in a
[0:44] portion
[0:45] to her maidens she considereth the field
[0:48] and buyeth it
[0:49] with the fruit of her hand she planteth
[0:51] a vineyard she girdeth her loins with
[0:53] strength
[0:54] and strengtheneth her arms she
[0:56] perceiveth that her merchandise is good
[0:58] her candle
[0:59] goeth not out by night she layeth her
[1:01] hands to the spindle
[1:03] and her hands hold the distaff
[1:06] she stretcheth out her hand to the poor
[1:09] yea
[1:09] she reacheth forth her hands to the
[1:11] needy she is not
[1:13] afraid of the snow for her household for
[1:16] all her household
[1:17] are clothed with scarlet she maketh
[1:21] herself
[1:21] coverings of tapestry her clothing is
[1:24] silk and purple her husband is known
[1:28] in the gates when he sitteth among the
[1:29] elders of the land she maketh find linen
[1:32] and selleth it and delivereth girdles
[1:35] unto the merchant
[1:37] str excuse me strength and honor are her
[1:40] clothing
[1:41] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:45] she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in
[1:47] her tongue
[1:48] is the law of kindness so it's not just
[1:51] what this woman does
[1:53] but it's what she is it's what her
[1:56] character is
[1:57] what comes out of her mouth as well her
[1:59] tongue is the law of kindness
[2:01] she looketh well to the ways of her
[2:03] household i don't know if you noticed it
[2:04] but
[2:05] two or three times her household has
[2:07] mentioned
[2:08] her husband is mentioned i'm going to
[2:11] speak this morning on a woman's place
[2:13] and this scripture is giving the woman's
[2:16] place
[2:17] and if you look at it carnally like the
[2:19] world does
[2:20] it it can be viewed very different by
[2:22] the world
[2:23] but this is expressing something much
[2:26] much greater than the world could ever
[2:27] interpret
[2:29] this is the blessed honored place that
[2:31] god gave a woman
[2:34] and it's related to her household
[2:37] it's related to her household verse 27
[2:41] she looketh well to the ways of her
[2:42] household and edith not the bread of
[2:44] idleness
[2:44] her children arise up and call her
[2:47] blessed
[2:48] her husband also and he praiseth
[2:51] her maybe i should just take a text on
[2:54] that scripture to the brothers
[2:58] he praiseth her for all these things
[3:03] be next sunday many daughters have done
[3:07] virtuously
[3:08] but thou excellest them all favor
[3:12] is deceitful and beauty is vain
[3:15] but a woman that feareth the lord she
[3:18] shall be praised give her the fruit of
[3:22] her hands
[3:23] and let her own works praise her in the
[3:26] gates
[3:27] amen what a beautiful i don't think that
[3:30] was just some
[3:31] poem i think i think solomon was
[3:34] under a great inspiration of god
[3:37] to say it just that way
[3:40] now here in uh first peter chapter 3
[3:43] before your seed in first peter chapter
[3:44] 3.
[3:49] another section of scripture is that i
[3:51] feel like in the old testament expresses
[3:53] the place
[3:54] of a woman of god
[3:58] likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[4:01] your own husbands that if any obey not
[4:05] the word they also may without the word
[4:10] be won by the conversation of the wives
[4:14] and conversation there is not her words
[4:16] it's her manner of life
[4:18] now if i read the first line
[4:22] of this verse to worldly people and
[4:25] sometimes people who haven't even found
[4:27] their place if i read that first slide
[4:29] wives be sub in subjection to your own
[4:31] husbands if i stop there
[4:33] you'll never see the picture you'll
[4:36] never see her place
[4:37] if you just read that you say well her
[4:39] place is just under subjection to her
[4:40] husband
[4:41] you didn't finish the verse i want you
[4:43] to notice the power
[4:45] that comes when a woman finds her place
[4:50] they miss the scripture like they miss a
[4:52] lot of scriptures they don't read the
[4:53] rest
[4:54] they don't seek out what god's trying to
[4:56] say you wives be in subjection to your
[4:58] own husbands that if any
[5:00] obey not the word they also
[5:03] may without the word be won
[5:07] by the manner of life of these wives
[5:10] in their place did anybody consider how
[5:13] much
[5:14] power is behind the woman being in place
[5:17] that even if the word is not there
[5:19] somebody
[5:20] can be one without the word
[5:26] why is that because she
[5:29] is the expression of the word
[5:34] the bride is the expression of the word
[5:38] and people can be one they may not hear
[5:40] it through her lips
[5:42] but her manner of life has the
[5:44] possibility
[5:46] to win someone who doesn't believe i'll
[5:48] tell you friends
[5:49] that's pretty powerful that's a pretty
[5:52] powerful place that goes on to say
[5:54] while they behold your chaste
[5:56] conversation
[5:57] coupled with fear it's just respect
[6:00] who's adorning let it not be that
[6:02] outward adorning of plating of the hair
[6:04] and of course
[6:04] for a woman's vessel it has to talk a
[6:07] little bit about what she wears
[6:09] because her vessel is different than the
[6:11] man's
[6:12] brother brown says somebody asked him i
[6:13] read it last night i said why are you
[6:15] always talking about
[6:16] the women's dress and never the men's
[6:18] well he said i have to talk about men
[6:20] sometimes when they have
[6:21] long hair or do this but he said most
[6:24] mostly it's because
[6:25] a woman is a different vessel and
[6:26] different body than the man the man
[6:29] naughty knees he's the ugliest thing he
[6:31] said
[6:32] there ain't nothing appealing about him
[6:34] whatsoever
[6:35] smells most the time
[6:40] but a woman's body is different and
[6:42] usually when he talks about the woman
[6:44] there's something in relation to what
[6:46] she wears
[6:47] that's god's heart can you say amen
[6:52] whose adorning let it not be that
[6:53] adorning outward adorning of plating the
[6:56] hair and of wearing of gold
[6:58] or putting on it of apparel but let it
[7:00] be the hidden man of the heart
[7:02] and that which is not corruptable even
[7:04] the ornament of a
[7:06] make and quiet spirit which is in the
[7:08] sight of god
[7:09] a great price for after this matter in
[7:12] the old time the holy women also
[7:15] who trusted in god adorned themselves
[7:18] being in subjection unto their own
[7:20] husband even as sarah obeyed abraham
[7:23] calling him lord whose daughters ye are
[7:27] as long as you do well and are not
[7:29] afraid
[7:30] with any amazement if you're in this
[7:32] manner of life and in this place
[7:34] and you do well with it and you're not
[7:36] afraid with any amazement
[7:39] being caught up with hysterical fears
[7:41] that's what that means not afraid with
[7:43] any amazing
[7:43] being caught up with hysterical fears if
[7:46] you're consistent to stay in this
[7:48] then you're you're acting out the
[7:49] daughters of sarah and the daughters of
[7:51] god can you say amen
[7:53] likewise ye husbands now why would it
[7:55] turn to the husbands because
[7:59] it's not just the wife that should
[8:01] reverence this position
[8:03] the husbands must reverence it too
[8:08] he's got to get his act together and
[8:09] he's got to see this position and place
[8:11] god gave her as well
[8:13] if he don't he's going to have trouble
[8:16] if you know if you see your woman as
[8:18] just another woman this
[8:20] any other woman and if you dabble and
[8:22] look at another woman you'll see your
[8:23] wife
[8:24] you'll disrespect her just like the
[8:25] world does because you're looking at the
[8:27] wrong thing
[8:30] so he addresses the husband you husbands
[8:32] dwell with them according to knowledge
[8:33] giving honor
[8:34] unto the wife as under the weaker vessel
[8:37] and as yet
[8:38] being heirs together of the grace of
[8:41] life so yes
[8:42] truly physically she's the weaker vessel
[8:45] but don't forget she's co-heirs with you
[8:48] of grace can you say amen
[8:53] there's a position that she's with you
[8:55] if you're alone
[8:56] that is a different story but the two of
[8:58] you together you're co-heirs together
[9:00] that's quite a good position
[9:01] of the grace of life and then he says if
[9:03] you don't honor this this way
[9:06] buddy your prayers you're in trouble
[9:08] with god
[9:10] you get in trouble with god if you don't
[9:13] see
[9:14] this place of a woman and honor it
[9:17] properly
[9:19] can you say man all right you can sit
[9:22] down i was preaching already
[9:24] i have to stand the whole service you
[9:26] know
[9:28] it's a good time this morning to take a
[9:31] moment
[9:31] and do as the scripture says as they
[9:34] shall be praised
[9:36] it's a good time to take a moment and
[9:38] praise the women who fear the lord
[9:40] the bible said she will be praised she
[9:43] should be praised
[9:45] and her husband should praise her the
[9:47] bible says as well
[9:49] but a husband won't do it unless he
[9:52] really sees and
[9:53] a lot of times this takes place over
[9:55] time some brothers catch it early on but
[9:58] you you learn it over time you begin to
[10:00] see this
[10:01] depth of this position that's when i
[10:03] want to speak on a woman's place
[10:05] and a lot of you know that i could
[10:08] finish that a woman's place
[10:10] is a woman's place is in the
[10:13] and you know those quotes very well a
[10:15] woman's place is in the and i'll read
[10:17] those things to you today
[10:19] but sometimes you make that place just
[10:22] that it's just about just as long as
[10:25] she's there in the kitchen in the home
[10:26] she's in her place this this meaning to
[10:29] a woman's place goes
[10:30] far deeper than her washing dishes in
[10:34] the kitchen
[10:36] hello maybe you don't know yet but i'm
[10:39] going to preach it to you this morning
[10:41] so i just want to say a woman's place i
[10:43] don't want to say a woman's place is
[10:45] here because i want to take it a bit
[10:46] deeper
[10:47] and when the other husband understands
[10:49] that he understands
[10:50] and he will praise her
[10:53] and over time many people learn more and
[10:56] more what this is and they learn to
[10:58] appreciate it more
[10:59] this glorious place and when she is in
[11:02] it the power that goes with it
[11:04] now i just wanted to say a comment about
[11:08] solomon's statement that says her value
[11:11] is far above rubies
[11:16] can you say amen so don't try to measure
[11:20] this woman of god don't try to measure
[11:22] her by any
[11:23] worldly terms or by any treasure
[11:27] this value of a godly woman don't don't
[11:29] don't compare it with any worldly terms
[11:32] or treasure
[11:33] of this godly woman who serve their
[11:34] husbands and serve their household
[11:37] and serve their children with the fear
[11:39] of the lord there is no price that can
[11:41] be put
[11:42] on that it is above rubies that's what
[11:44] the scripture says
[11:45] her value sisters godly sisters
[11:50] whoever you are around the world the
[11:52] bible says your value
[11:53] is above rubies
[11:57] above rubies and she is never to be
[12:00] looked at as just the same as any other
[12:03] woman
[12:03] she is far from any other woman can you
[12:06] say amen
[12:08] if you go to salary.com they've
[12:11] established a
[12:12] a salary for a mom of the stuff that she
[12:15] does in comparison they've been doing
[12:16] this for years and
[12:17] i looked up a recent not a recent one
[12:19] but two years ago they've probably added
[12:21] to it but when they take it the
[12:22] comparables of all that a woman does
[12:24] they come up with about a 95-hour week
[12:29] it's okay sisters it's okay to say amen
[12:31] today
[12:32] he says you're so quiet this is the
[12:34] service you're really saying man
[12:36] maybe go a little nudged to your husband
[12:39] it's okay you have permission but
[12:43] they set a salary based on all the
[12:46] comparables of what she's doing
[12:47] for a 95-hour week and
[12:51] they come up with a salary every year
[12:54] of a hundred and sixty four thousand
[12:57] dollar annual salary
[12:58] for what a mom and a woman does laurie
[13:02] come on now i'm getting some response
[13:06] 160 on salary.com
[13:09] that's what they establish the salary as
[13:12] what you're worth
[13:13] every week sis i can't get some of you
[13:17] to smile at all
[13:19] lighten up a bit 164
[13:22] brothers i guess your puny little
[13:25] flowers today
[13:27] from kroger
[13:30] don't seem like very much the girls
[13:34] should be making 164 000 a year
[13:36] and i know some of the scissors they're
[13:38] thinking yeah pay up here let's just
[13:40] bring it on
[13:42] give me 80 of it
[13:45] for what she does for how she works
[13:50] for most of the time you don't see it
[13:52] that's done but i want to say sis
[13:54] god sees it and there are rewards beyond
[13:58] imagination for sisters
[14:00] particularly in the last days who find
[14:03] their place
[14:04] and work in that with an attitude of
[14:06] grace and a spirit of
[14:08] rejoicing this is what i do there
[14:11] are rewards on the other side that blow
[14:14] our mind that will blow our minds
[14:16] for the sisters that are sitting here
[14:18] today and around the world
[14:19] in this generation who express
[14:23] the wonderfulness of of a godly woman
[14:26] there's rewards for you sister you may
[14:29] not get the 164 000 here
[14:31] but you're going to get a lot more than
[14:33] that someday
[14:35] praise the lord so
[14:39] you know if we respect you know you
[14:42] brothers and your kroger flowers
[14:44] i'd say if you got her the flowers and
[14:46] got her a nice meal today
[14:48] if there's respect and love and value
[14:51] for you that goes with those flowers
[14:53] then she'd probably enjoy the flowers
[14:58] it's not just about the card or the
[14:59] flowers it's about do you
[15:01] see her place
[15:05] now sisters don't demand that they see
[15:08] your place
[15:09] just let god speak through me and maybe
[15:11] they'll catch it this morning
[15:16] a woman's place some think sometimes a
[15:18] woman places in the kitchen
[15:20] the carnal mind looks at it and says you
[15:22] know even the worst
[15:23] carnal mind you're a cult if you say a
[15:25] woman's place is in the kitchen a
[15:27] woman's place is in the home
[15:28] a woman's place there you're just cult
[15:30] and you're following a cult leader
[15:32] they they take that carnal view of it
[15:34] and you're they say you're putting woman
[15:36] in bondage
[15:37] and the reason is they see it that we
[15:38] have no revelation of the bible or the
[15:40] scriptures
[15:41] they have no revelation of the depth of
[15:43] a woman's place
[15:44] and the power that goes with it
[15:47] no revelation to all that conclusion and
[15:50] sometimes even our own ranks
[15:51] they don't have a revelation of what
[15:54] what a how glo
[15:55] bless a sister told me how you guys
[15:57] don't mind us
[15:58] sister brittany told me the other day
[16:00] and her husband brother joseph
[16:02] coming from van work i hope you guys
[16:04] don't mind me saying that i already said
[16:06] your name so it's too late
[16:09] they made a decision a few weeks ago to
[16:10] bring her home
[16:12] and always used to the two salaries to
[16:14] bring her home to be with the kids when
[16:16] they're little
[16:17] and they're doing extra things to be
[16:19] able to meet up the thing together to
[16:20] sell things to be able to meet that
[16:22] salary together
[16:24] i i'm all over that when somebody says
[16:26] it to praise it
[16:29] must be praised because those are rare
[16:31] decisions today
[16:33] but i said sis and i said to the
[16:34] brothers and says god
[16:36] you will not know till someday the
[16:38] trickle-down effect
[16:40] of that one decision sacrifice
[16:43] financially do
[16:44] everything you can and you do it but he
[16:45] said you may not see the results now but
[16:47] i'm telling you someday
[16:49] you'll see a huge trickle-down effect
[16:51] from that mom being with those kids
[16:54] see you see around here you're going to
[16:56] get all the worldly views of thing and
[16:58] sometimes in the church you get worldly
[17:00] views in the church
[17:01] but this boy this pastor is when he sees
[17:03] it i'm all over it
[17:04] it's going to be praised decisions like
[17:06] that are going to be praised
[17:13] and that's not to be little as i said
[17:15] i'm respectful to every woman that has
[17:17] to work many of them have to do that
[17:18] it's completely fine
[17:20] i just know when someone makes a
[17:21] decision like that i say god bless them
[17:23] for it
[17:23] that's great if they can do it
[17:24] especially for the children's sake
[17:26] can you say amen let me clarify
[17:28] something else
[17:32] i mean i'm feeling pretty good so i must
[17:35] go for
[17:36] i'm already in trouble with some people
[17:37] but listen hey
[17:40] it's not the message of christ
[17:43] that has belittled and disrespected
[17:45] women
[17:49] if women are in the place they're at
[17:51] today it's not because of people
[17:53] that's saying it's the message that puts
[17:55] people women in bondage
[17:56] it's not the message of christ that has
[17:58] done that it's the world that's
[18:00] disrespected women
[18:02] it's the world that's dirtied women it's
[18:04] the world
[18:05] that's got women out of their place can
[18:06] you say amen women are completely lost
[18:09] today
[18:09] and they've lost their place for for
[18:11] many years now in the world
[18:13] they don't know who they are anymore and
[18:14] it's not because of the bible or the
[18:16] message
[18:17] it's because the world has taught them a
[18:19] different thing
[18:20] and got them out of their place i should
[18:23] get greater amens than that because
[18:24] that's exactly the truth
[18:26] women have been brought to the lowest
[18:28] place by the fashions of this world
[18:30] by the movies of this world by the lust
[18:33] of men by the mixed messages of what's
[18:35] pretty
[18:36] women have been deteriorated in their
[18:38] place they don't even know who they are
[18:40] anymore but it's not the message that
[18:42] has brought the women under bondage
[18:43] it's actually the message of christ
[18:45] that's brought us back to that beautiful
[18:47] glorious place of a woman again
[18:52] you dare let the devil or anybody online
[18:54] tell you any different
[18:56] the message of christ has come to
[18:58] restore the dignity of true womanhood
[19:02] even all the talks about in the
[19:04] preaching about dress
[19:06] it's all for a purpose can you say amen
[19:10] women are looked at wrong and they're
[19:14] viewed wrong because the world has
[19:15] dirtied
[19:16] and disrespected women they can't even
[19:18] look at them right anymore
[19:19] and you brothers you you men that look
[19:22] at pornography or you're
[19:23] you're bound by that and you listen you
[19:26] can never look at your wife correctly if
[19:29] you're looking at that stuff
[19:31] and you'll start putting her down i
[19:33] heard that the other day they're putting
[19:35] people down and
[19:36] they laugh at her i've seen that in men
[19:38] they put her down put their wife down
[19:40] laugh at her and the reason you become
[19:41] disrespectful
[19:42] is because you're feeding on what the
[19:43] world feeds on and it and every time
[19:46] that will belittle a godly woman and
[19:48] you'll have a
[19:49] sarcastic view towards a woman's place
[19:51] in the bible
[19:53] it's what it does it's a spirit you
[19:56] never look at your mom right
[19:57] you'll never look at your wife right as
[19:59] long as you dabble in that
[20:01] you need an altar you need to be
[20:03] sanctified and you young girls
[20:05] listen to me you better know
[20:08] that a young man has been completely
[20:11] delivered of that
[20:12] before you entertain marriage with a
[20:13] young man
[20:15] because he will not respect you i don't
[20:17] care how much he would love you now
[20:19] he will not respect you as the woman of
[20:21] god that you want to be
[20:22] and you want to be looked at right it'll
[20:24] never happen if he hasn't overcome that
[20:26] thing in his life
[20:28] it's okay i'm compared with no amens i'm
[20:30] prepared for it i may ask for him but
[20:32] listen
[20:32] you young girls better pray hard can you
[20:34] say man that that man is a sanctified
[20:37] holy ghost-filled man
[20:38] and these things have been resolved in
[20:40] our life because the disrespect and
[20:42] sarcasm and spirit
[20:43] that is that is in his life will be
[20:46] carried into the marriage
[20:48] you want him to be find his place as a
[20:51] godly man
[20:52] as you're trying to find your place as a
[20:54] godly woman
[20:56] and that would be a honorable marriage
[20:58] if both knew that
[21:02] praise the lord
[21:05] brother bryan says it's just a shame
[21:07] that the enemy has taken our american
[21:08] women
[21:09] and stripped them down as a quote the
[21:12] first quote that i have there guys
[21:13] it's just a shame that the enemy has
[21:15] taken our american women stripped them
[21:17] down out here on the streets
[21:18] it's a disgrace no wonder little boys
[21:20] and little girls and things are in such
[21:22] a shape as they are today
[21:23] they're always trying to pattern after
[21:25] some woman out here in hollywood
[21:27] married four or five times and she'll
[21:29] come out with some sort of a nude
[21:30] clothes on
[21:31] and all the little girls in the country
[21:32] will pattern after that what a pity
[21:34] that's too bad yes sir it's too bad and
[21:36] it's got into the church
[21:37] the beautiful virtue that god give a
[21:39] woman to be a mother
[21:40] has been marred and that's the backbone
[21:43] of the nation how many knows that
[21:44] brother brown says womanhood and
[21:45] motherhood
[21:46] is the backbone of a nation
[21:50] you break motherhood and you've broke
[21:51] the nation right then that's one thing
[21:53] that helps hold it together
[21:54] real genuine parenthood and i was
[21:57] talking to the cab driver coming down
[21:59] he was talking about some delinquent
[22:00] children up there and he said i think
[22:01] it's parents and i said amen fell i
[22:03] don't know who you are but you're on the
[22:04] right road
[22:05] and later on he says long ago too long
[22:07] ago has this long ago
[22:09] too long ago has the beautiful virtue of
[22:11] women and their fine dress has
[22:12] bowed before the shrine of the goddess
[22:15] of hollywood
[22:16] it's the truth it's such a pity that the
[22:18] world has gotten a place like that
[22:20] nation's backbone is broken sex appeal
[22:23] is many times regarded as
[22:25] fashion it's the statement brother brain
[22:27] brandon makes over and over again
[22:28] sex even in the church sex appeal is
[22:31] okay to appeal someone
[22:33] sexually is okay and sex appeal is
[22:35] considered
[22:36] fashion modern people
[22:39] dressing going out on the street you
[22:41] know what the bible says
[22:42] so true womanhood and true motherhood is
[22:45] the backbone of our nation
[22:47] it's the backbone of our church
[22:51] can you say amen and i just say to you
[22:55] a woman's place how powerful is this
[22:57] place
[22:58] when the women find their place
[23:03] the message did not come to put women
[23:05] let me correct this too
[23:06] while i'm on a roll the message did not
[23:08] come to put put women in their place
[23:12] but it came to show them in the bible
[23:13] their true place of value and virtue
[23:16] see you have to correct these things
[23:19] because the devil's lies
[23:21] the message did not come to put the
[23:23] women in place
[23:26] it came to show you your wonderful place
[23:33] marriage and divorce you know after
[23:35] marriage divorce i see he comes through
[23:37] talking about if a woman gets out of
[23:40] order
[23:40] and from the fall from eve all the way
[23:42] through brother bram just elaborates it
[23:44] and just goes on and on and on
[23:47] and he comes to a couple spots in mary's
[23:48] divorce and he says
[23:51] here also later in recognizing your day
[23:54] you know the bible said that those who
[23:55] escape
[23:55] out of this great damnation will be a
[23:57] beautiful branch for before the lord
[24:00] someday i'll get to it the lord willing
[24:02] for for you women let you see what god
[24:04] thinks of a woman that really escapes
[24:06] the damnation of this day
[24:08] he said she would be beautiful
[24:11] i heard a woman the other day laughing a
[24:13] girl a bunch of half-naked females with
[24:15] morals
[24:15] lower than a mother dog laughing at an
[24:18] old woman with a long dress listening
[24:19] here
[24:20] you twist listen here you twist it up
[24:22] female she's got something
[24:24] you know nothing about she's got moral
[24:26] you don't even know what the name is
[24:28] you lost it in the cradle almost you
[24:31] don't even know right
[24:32] from wrong she does she's got something
[24:34] hid in her heart that you don't know
[24:36] nothing about
[24:38] you think i'm a hard preacher
[24:42] you lost it can never find it you don't
[24:45] don't call her old-fashioned and so
[24:46] forth like that she knows something you
[24:48] don't know nothing about
[24:49] she's got hid in her heart the treasure
[24:51] of decency
[24:52] you don't know one word of it and then
[24:54] later on he says
[24:56] i'm talking of the immoral now not you
[24:58] sisters
[24:59] we'll give you your place right here so
[25:01] now in marriage and divorce after he
[25:02] covers the bad woman
[25:04] he keeps dropping as he just said he
[25:05] says someday he said i'd like to take
[25:08] this
[25:08] and teach this because he had to talk so
[25:10] much about the women of the world being
[25:12] out of place
[25:13] he said someday sisters i'd like to take
[25:15] time and show you
[25:16] your place in the scripture and in
[25:20] marriage and divorce he says it twice he
[25:21] says i'm talking now of the immoral now
[25:23] not you sisters we'll give you your
[25:25] place right place in a few minutes in
[25:27] the word of god here
[25:28] later in marriage and divorce he says
[25:30] now can you see why i have said the
[25:31] things that i've done
[25:32] and the things the things that i've done
[25:35] in other words he's saying for years
[25:37] he's what they call harped on the women
[25:39] he said now you see in marriage and
[25:41] divorce you see the things that i've
[25:42] done
[25:43] knowing that this was in my heart
[25:44] brothers and sisters i know sisters
[25:47] you got your place just in a moment and
[25:50] the wonderful character that god can
[25:52] mold in you
[25:52] but i'm just trying to speak on the
[25:54] other side to show
[25:56] what you're actually from in the
[25:57] beginning but he says you have
[26:00] your place i i believe he didn't really
[26:02] have the time after elaborating so much
[26:04] in marriage divorce he didn't have the
[26:06] time
[26:06] in that message to get to the full uh
[26:09] the full
[26:10] thing of it he did in later sermons and
[26:13] he says enough about it and she points
[26:15] us to the place
[26:16] the true place he had to talk a lot
[26:19] about a woman being out of place
[26:21] but he he got to it in several services
[26:24] and what he didn't get to there's enough
[26:26] in there
[26:27] that us ministers can preach it to you
[26:30] in 2021.
[26:35] so it must be deeper than just a quote
[26:38] a woman's places in the kitchen or
[26:40] woman's places in the home and if you're
[26:41] looking at first peter again if you pull
[26:43] that up first peter chapter
[26:45] three again this is a pretty powerful
[26:48] place to be in when she's in that place
[26:50] that her testimony and her manner of
[26:52] life could actually
[26:54] win somebody who's not obeying the word
[26:57] and won't listen to somebody speaking
[26:59] the word
[27:00] there's such a place of power in this
[27:02] that her life
[27:03] may god help me to show you in the next
[27:05] few minutes now what the place of the
[27:07] woman is what the place
[27:08] it's not just that she's in the kitchen
[27:10] and she's at the home there's a reason
[27:11] why it's home centered there's reasons
[27:13] for that
[27:14] but the deeper part of it is that when
[27:16] she is in this place
[27:17] she is expressing something she's
[27:20] expressing something and it's hidden
[27:21] within her
[27:22] the hidden man of the heart and all of
[27:24] these expressions in first peter chapter
[27:26] three
[27:26] she has the hidden men of the heart
[27:28] there's there's a mystery behind her
[27:30] there's something in here the world
[27:32] knows nothing about and when he says the
[27:34] meek
[27:34] and the humble quiet meek is humble and
[27:37] that quiet
[27:38] spirit listen a lot of times that's
[27:40] interpreted wrong too
[27:42] that she never says nothing and her
[27:44] personality is squelched
[27:45] when it says a meek and quiet spirit it
[27:48] says just that
[27:49] it's not so much she's quiet with her
[27:51] words but a meek and quiet
[27:53] spirit it says
[27:58] i i know where i'm going with this don't
[28:00] be nervous
[28:04] if it means just that she shuts up and
[28:06] never says nothing then
[28:07] then sarah doesn't fit in that in the
[28:09] bible can you say it
[28:11] zipporah doesn't fit in that if meek and
[28:14] quiet meant she never
[28:15] said nothing and that's really godly if
[28:17] she's just just
[28:19] completely silent on every she never
[28:21] says nothing
[28:22] she's such a godly woman she never says
[28:24] nothing
[28:26] it's not what it means if that's the
[28:28] case the poor don't fit
[28:31] because moses and all this great
[28:32] ministry forgot to circumcise his own
[28:35] child
[28:36] and so poor had a little temper
[28:40] she said to her husband thou art a
[28:42] bloody husband to me you forgot that
[28:44] all your ministry and going down to
[28:46] pharaoh you forgot to circumcise your
[28:48] own son
[28:48] brother braham said she had a temper and
[28:51] moses had one too
[28:53] and he says it must not have been so
[28:55] pleasant on the backside of the desert
[28:57] when both of their tempers got going at
[28:59] the same time
[29:01] that's his own words but quiet doesn't
[29:05] mean that she was
[29:06] so poor wasn't quiet sarah wasn't quiet
[29:09] sarah got involved with their husband so
[29:11] this meek and quiet and being a daughter
[29:13] of sarah must not mean you're completely
[29:14] silent which
[29:16] many of the messages have interpreted
[29:17] this for years the wrong way
[29:21] i don't mind saying it can you say amen
[29:24] and some of you brothers are not married
[29:26] to quiet wives
[29:36] no i'm not going to ask for a show of
[29:38] hands
[29:40] no better than that
[29:43] you have expressive wives
[29:46] i have one
[29:49] we had a minister in here
[29:53] oh man almost 30 years ago for a
[29:55] dedication of a little building
[29:56] he was from trinidad and the whole
[29:58] weekend he stayed at our house
[30:00] nobody else was around me and my wife
[30:02] and she just talked and talked and
[30:04] talked and
[30:05] my wife loves to talk about the word and
[30:06] his brother was in the word so i'm
[30:08] sitting there on the couch and she's
[30:09] doing most of talking
[30:12] and if you know my wife she always feel
[30:14] bad about it afterwards so she come the
[30:16] last she said i apologize but she
[30:17] i just got excited about the word and
[30:19] i've talked way too much and i probably
[30:21] shouldn't
[30:22] oh he said that's fine sister that's
[30:24] fine that just shows you're free
[30:26] and your husband lets you be free
[30:31] yeah i didn't marry her to change her
[30:34] personality
[30:37] i married her so meek and quiet
[30:41] i believe humility is a part of it i
[30:42] don't think you should be all
[30:44] showy and about yourself humility is a
[30:46] part of it but this quiet thing
[30:48] has to mean something different and i
[30:50] think it's just a secret mystery behind
[30:52] her
[30:52] that is that there's this there's this
[30:54] quietness if i can explain it right
[30:57] is that she of course she doesn't handle
[30:59] the word of god in front of the pulpit
[31:01] she can't do that but that that's part
[31:02] of it but there's this mystery behind
[31:05] her that she's
[31:05] she's hidden behind the mystery of her
[31:08] husband and
[31:09] as it says in the beginning the woman's
[31:10] place is that she shall be a help
[31:13] meet for him
[31:16] so now a woman loses her own not her
[31:20] personality but she
[31:21] loses and becomes lost into the vision
[31:25] and the identity of this man so much she
[31:27] becomes hidden in that
[31:29] so she don't want to speak for the man
[31:31] or speak something outside of that
[31:32] vision in the world of the man
[31:34] so that's where she becomes quiet in the
[31:36] sense that she
[31:38] you see this woman is that she's so much
[31:40] a part of her husband
[31:42] that she don't want to speak something
[31:43] other or or different or belittle him or
[31:46] anything like that
[31:47] it's a different meaning than just being
[31:48] silent does everybody understand
[31:52] so look it up and study it some more
[31:54] because you want to understand it right
[31:55] it's this this meek and quiet spirit and
[31:58] sarah was behind the tent of course
[32:00] and we know she laughed but she was
[32:01] behind there and he tells her to bring
[32:03] the meal out
[32:04] and so we know that happened but there
[32:06] was she the thought is
[32:08] is she is connected with abraham
[32:14] she shall be a help meet for him in
[32:15] other words she's a
[32:17] she's a helper suitable
[32:20] for his vision
[32:24] and if she has a bit of an agenda or an
[32:27] agenda but a vision of her own
[32:28] that will always fit with that man's
[32:32] vision it's not like this i'm going off
[32:36] and i'm doing my own thing and my own
[32:39] career and my own deal
[32:40] and he hasn't signed off on it and it
[32:42] jeopardizes many things
[32:44] she can't do her work it gets a little
[32:47] iffy doing that
[32:48] you understand what i'm saying is that
[32:51] what she does and who she is and all
[32:53] that
[32:53] is within this this world of being a
[32:56] helpmate to him now you can't get around
[32:58] scripture now don't buck up against it
[32:59] the original purpose of eve was that she
[33:02] be a helpmate
[33:03] a help meet which means a helper
[33:06] suitable
[33:07] for him and his vision
[33:10] doesn't mean you don't have a vision
[33:11] doesn't mean you don't have creativity
[33:16] but it's it's god blesses it when it
[33:18] when it's in this
[33:20] vision of this man or their father
[33:25] right till she's married it's like she's
[33:28] not all
[33:28] just doing her but no she's staying
[33:30] within that protection
[33:31] of her father and that counsel of her
[33:34] father
[33:35] and if she don't have a father then
[33:37] she's staying within some council
[33:38] somewhere
[33:39] to get advice to stay within the world
[33:41] of having a good
[33:43] leadership so she's not tempted or false
[33:47] how many knows that after the fall
[33:49] everything changed and they were
[33:50] co-equal before that
[33:52] they're still co-equal and the coirs
[33:54] together and grace is still that way
[33:56] and calvary's restored things but after
[33:57] the fall god
[33:59] put her under the rulership of a husband
[34:01] because
[34:02] of the protection because of her vessel
[34:04] because of the fall
[34:05] then he says i've got to give her a
[34:06] place he didn't have to give her a place
[34:08] but he gave her a place
[34:09] he put her under this protection
[34:10] rulership of the husband for her
[34:12] protection
[34:13] and that's happened since the fall how
[34:15] many understands that so it was a
[34:16] different covenant for the woman
[34:18] after the fall happened but god did it
[34:21] for protection god did
[34:22] it to take this vessel and put a
[34:24] protection around it of her husband's
[34:26] headship
[34:27] so that she wouldn't fall into these
[34:28] traps again anytime a woman starts to
[34:31] live her life without the right type of
[34:33] headship
[34:34] she can get in trouble in a lot of ways
[34:37] anytime a man
[34:38] gets out of the headship of the holy
[34:39] ghost he can get in trouble in a lot of
[34:42] ways
[34:43] we are all called to be under headship
[34:45] the headship of the lord jesus christ
[34:48] and we step out of that we're getting a
[34:50] very dangerous spot
[34:53] i think we get back up here because i i
[34:55] got a lot to finish
[34:56] and my ipad has got six percent left
[35:02] forgot to charge it
[35:05] if you guys one of you guys want to work
[35:07] on getting me plugged in here i
[35:10] i'm sorry for doing that i don't know if
[35:11] somebody has that plug me up
[35:16] is this okay today is it okay with
[35:18] everybody
[35:20] can i leave my church over it
[35:30] so now i've already commented on some of
[35:33] this in first peter so i'm just going to
[35:34] move on the husbands need to see that
[35:36] it's her place in the fear of the lord
[35:38] if you dishonest or dishonor her you get
[35:40] in trouble with god she's coheirs
[35:41] together with you
[35:42] of the grace of life it's all about this
[35:44] place it's focused on the right thing
[35:46] god wants her focused on
[35:47] and when a woman is focused on the right
[35:49] thing in her place focus on the right
[35:51] thing she needs to be focused on
[35:53] when we say a woman's place is in the
[35:55] home it's so much deeper than that
[35:57] and you know i when i think of that i
[35:59] think of my mom that's sitting here
[36:00] today which i'm very grateful to still
[36:02] have her and every day to be able to be
[36:04] with her and talk to her
[36:06] but if we were to say a woman's place is
[36:08] in the home
[36:09] well my mom that doesn't mean just being
[36:11] in your home because
[36:12] my mom for a lot of years didn't have a
[36:14] home
[36:15] and we lived in motels most of my young
[36:18] years
[36:19] so home must be something more in fact
[36:21] two years we didn't even have a home
[36:23] dad put damn dad he put everything in
[36:25] storage
[36:26] wanted to go on the road full-time
[36:28] evangelism and for two or three years
[36:30] we mom didn't even have a home now
[36:32] that's something for a woman
[36:33] right not a lot of you women can do that
[36:37] but my mom was built for it because when
[36:39] god calls a man he calls his wife with
[36:41] him
[36:43] can i get a bigger amen when god calls a
[36:45] man what he calls him to he calls the
[36:46] wife with him to help him
[36:47] in that and so mom you know she's in
[36:51] she's one of the first homeschoolers in
[36:53] this nation or in the world
[36:54] she was the first homeschooler i believe
[36:55] in this entire world she was doing it
[36:57] before any of the schools
[36:58] she homeschooled us in the back of a van
[37:01] in the
[37:02] in the motel room everything is you know
[37:04] everywhere
[37:05] she's somehow you know what i know how
[37:07] to count today and i know a little bit
[37:08] about math and things because
[37:10] she kept it going dad didn't keep it
[37:12] going dad had his calling and stuff but
[37:14] but that's the place you see she gave
[37:16] attention
[37:17] to the children this is important we
[37:19] need to educate them
[37:20] this is important we need to feed them
[37:22] because she fed me too much
[37:26] we need to teach them to sing we need to
[37:28] do this so there's something about that
[37:29] that the dads can't provide
[37:31] she's built special to say okay if this
[37:33] is your calling and mom was right all
[37:34] over it
[37:35] daddy's going to travel the country got
[37:37] invitations everywhere i'm going i go
[37:39] we we may not have a home for a while
[37:41] but i feel called to go and evangelize
[37:43] around this nation
[37:44] that's what i did as a kid but she was
[37:46] called to make that work she could i'm
[37:48] good with it i'm going with it this is
[37:49] your vision
[37:50] i'm making it happen and i'm gonna make
[37:52] it run as smooth as i can
[37:54] i'm gonna cook in motels we had a little
[37:56] cooker there and we didn't have money
[37:57] sometimes needed a restaurant
[37:59] if we did have money it was five dollars
[38:01] at mcdonald's
[38:02] and we could feed the entire family big
[38:07] for five bucks can't do that today
[38:10] but she's cooking a lot of the motels
[38:12] and bringing the pots and pans in and
[38:14] just doing all this stuff
[38:15] when i think mom i love you today i
[38:17] appreciate it but it's not just about
[38:19] having home it's can i say it this way
[38:22] she is home
[38:26] it's not about her places in the home
[38:28] she becomes home she makes it a home
[38:33] that's a woman's place and a lot of
[38:35] situations she makes at home wherever
[38:37] they're at whatever they can do
[38:38] if it's a mansion or if it's a little a
[38:41] two-bit house with nothing there with
[38:42] with an outhouse for a bathroom that
[38:45] wife will say listen i hope things get
[38:47] better someday
[38:48] i hope you get a better job someday but
[38:50] there's something in here that reaches
[38:52] out we're going to make this
[38:53] work no matter what we have to do god
[38:55] bless you women who find that place with
[38:57] your husband
[39:01] yeah just doing it doing whatever i'm
[39:04] going dead whatever and it was here and
[39:06] there and everywhere
[39:08] i think we moved 30 times by the time i
[39:10] was 20 years old
[39:12] 30 times that's why i've been in one
[39:15] place
[39:15] this area for 33 years now
[39:19] because i don't like moving
[39:23] she was called to it you know a woman
[39:25] doesn't do something unless she's called
[39:26] to it
[39:27] and she's in the world of her husband
[39:29] this is it we go with it
[39:32] god bless you mom thank you for your
[39:35] years of labor
[39:41] she's a woman who found her place and
[39:43] did god bless it god blessed it
[39:45] tremendously
[39:46] all of her children serving the lord can
[39:49] you say man
[39:50] some of your children aren't serving the
[39:52] lord but i'm believing with you that
[39:53] they're going to come
[39:54] because if you bore that image in front
[39:55] of them that image
[39:57] in their minds and hearts they may not
[39:58] admit it will be more powerful someday
[40:03] than any damage they've been through or
[40:04] whatever's happened that image lays
[40:06] there
[40:07] you can't get rid of it and has the
[40:09] power
[40:10] to save they better
[40:13] never darken the door of a church or
[40:14] read their bible but that bible says
[40:16] by her manner of life he can be one
[40:21] she can be one without the word how
[40:23] powerful is that
[40:27] i think of my wife i was thinking about
[40:30] this two days ago as the lord just gave
[40:32] me this i didn't know what to preach i
[40:33] thought
[40:34] what's a woman's place what's the woman
[40:35] saying i was thinking my wife you know
[40:37] she made that adjustment i think she was
[40:39] 25 and i was 27
[40:41] and she had already got a bachelor's
[40:43] degree and it was working at the
[40:44] hospital great job making good money
[40:46] i wasn't here i come along wanting to
[40:49] marry her and
[40:50] i don't know what i made i made almost
[40:52] nothing
[40:53] she so she's she's making this money she
[40:55] can go buy the dresses that she wants
[40:57] she can ride the car she had a red
[40:59] honda prelude sports car
[41:02] cool car that's some of the reason i
[41:05] married her i thought that's a cool car
[41:09] but cool woman here
[41:12] so she's got this car she's got all the
[41:14] money she needs you know i think she
[41:16] made it that time which was a lot 30 000
[41:17] which is a lot back then
[41:19] she had so you know here she's going to
[41:20] accept me and you know you know the
[41:22] story she's sitting on
[41:23] her front porch looking at the smoky
[41:25] mountains in tennessee
[41:27] and crying saying lord
[41:31] you know i love this man if i'm willing
[41:33] to leave all of this
[41:34] to go to toledo ohio
[41:39] i was thinking about the other day
[41:40] because she called me when we were
[41:42] engaged and she had to
[41:43] switch i made her get okay i'll take the
[41:46] blame for this
[41:46] i made her get rid of the prelude
[41:49] because at that time i had the twisted
[41:51] view that
[41:52] a pastor probably shouldn't be riding
[41:54] around in a prelude
[41:57] i was so dumb james i was so dumb i
[42:00] would love to have that prelude today
[42:03] i would drive it in between all your
[42:05] cars
[42:06] and wouldn't care what you thought at
[42:08] all
[42:10] it's perfectly fine for a pastor to
[42:12] drive a red honda prelude
[42:14] it would have been worth something today
[42:18] and i made her get rid of it i said i
[42:19] don't think a pastor should drive that
[42:21] you should get something more
[42:22] conservative so
[42:22] she goes to the honda dealer she trades
[42:24] that in and she gets this car but she
[42:26] gets this
[42:27] it was a brand new accord four door
[42:29] court and she calls and she's crying she
[42:31] says
[42:32] she said i love this new car except that
[42:34] my prelude did a lot of things
[42:36] i was sitting in the car and the
[42:37] salesman said said
[42:39] she said how do i get the antenna up he
[42:41] says oh you got to go out and pull it up
[42:48] and you got to manually move your seats
[42:50] and you got all this stuff
[42:52] and she called me crying she said i love
[42:54] you but
[42:55] can i just look at something a little
[42:57] different than this and i said yes i
[42:59] understand the pain that you're going
[43:01] through right now
[43:03] we'll spend a little bit more and get it
[43:06] so the antenna
[43:07] can come up and so through the marriage
[43:10] now for 27 years
[43:12] we've been in this mode you know just
[43:16] happy wife happy life you know but you
[43:19] know why a husband can do it
[43:21] i just thought of that that she didn't
[43:24] have to call and necessarily ask
[43:27] but she had made the transition i'm in
[43:30] his world now
[43:34] what i do i'm not my own identity here
[43:36] now i'm
[43:37] i'm in his identity and what decisions i
[43:40] make
[43:40] affects us because we are one that's an
[43:43] engagement
[43:45] and i said just dropped to my heart said
[43:46] lord i'm going to preach on this a
[43:47] little bit because
[43:48] we've got examples hundreds of examples
[43:50] in this congregation
[43:51] of women women that are finding their
[43:54] place
[43:55] to not try to make decisions as just
[43:56] some career woman
[43:58] but in the world that is protected
[44:01] of this hobby so i'm sitting here
[44:05] without a hubby this morning
[44:06] and i'm working hard i got a scripture
[44:08] for you in a little bit
[44:10] just hang on you got time
[44:13] dude i gotta go back up and find out
[44:14] where i'm at
[44:17] petersburg michigan i know i know i'm in
[44:18] pittsburg michigan that's where i'm at
[44:20] right
[44:22] so i thank god for the godly woman i
[44:26] thank god for my wife
[44:27] it's been a wonderful marriage a
[44:29] wonderful year 27 years with her
[44:32] and a lot of it is you find your place
[44:34] in christ the man
[44:36] under the word under the headship and
[44:38] the woman finds her place
[44:41] the world doesn't know anything about
[44:42] this
[44:44] to this am i supposed to serve this
[44:46] person
[44:47] you go do your own dishes you go do you
[44:49] you see it just gets to be this carnal
[44:51] thing
[44:52] that's the place is not necessarily a
[44:54] geographical place
[44:55] but it's a position of power that god
[44:57] said if shall be in that
[44:59] i'll bless their family i bless their
[45:01] lives is this okay with everybody
[45:13] a woman is not the source of life
[45:19] for bearing children she's not the
[45:21] source of that life
[45:22] the man is the source
[45:25] i'm just i was going to do this this
[45:27] sunday again i'm just going to throw it
[45:28] out
[45:31] just send a message somebody get me a
[45:33] hook
[45:35] go ahead you can pick it up
[45:38] that's a visual so the whoever's in
[45:41] charge gets me a hook to put my jacket
[45:44] on we're not sending this video out at
[45:47] all
[45:48] it's on facebook no not this sunday
[45:52] a woman is not the source of life
[45:55] that comes from the man right
[45:59] uh jesus said i am the vine
[46:02] but you are the branches so she bears
[46:06] she bears where the life source comes
[46:09] from
[46:10] she's the expression of it so the woman
[46:12] is not a source of life
[46:14] and jesus made it clear you've got to
[46:17] abide in the vine if you don't abide in
[46:18] the vine
[46:19] you don't you don't have a source of
[46:22] life yourself
[46:24] how many raise your hand as christians
[46:26] you have no source of life yourself
[46:28] without christ you're finished so let's
[46:31] not get an attitude that the lord needs
[46:33] me
[46:33] the lord needs me that's not yet without
[46:35] the source of life you have nothing
[46:36] so it's just like a woman a woman can't
[46:38] have a baby on her own
[46:40] a woman can't have life come into her on
[46:42] her own she can't do that
[46:43] she has to be with a man but we must
[46:45] realize how important a woman's place
[46:47] because there is some elements to it
[46:48] that he may be the source of life but he
[46:50] can't have the baby
[46:53] so she is essential to bring forth what
[46:56] the life is
[46:57] i would never meet my children this
[46:59] morning solomon and getting i'd never be
[47:01] able to know them
[47:02] unless i had my wife they could be in me
[47:04] but i would never have the essential
[47:05] what i need
[47:06] to see that life come to the right
[47:08] betting ground so the woman
[47:10] so now the man's the source of life but
[47:12] the woman is the betting ground for life
[47:14] the woman is the nurturer of life and
[47:16] she has it in her belly she nurtures it
[47:18] the woman is the birther of life can you
[47:21] say amen and then after that the woman
[47:23] is the trainer brother bram says in her
[47:24] earlier
[47:25] she's training that child the woman is
[47:27] the creator of an atmosphere for that
[47:29] life
[47:29] everything that life is really comes to
[47:32] that woman
[47:33] she's she's not the source of life but
[47:35] she's everything about the environment
[47:38] that that life is nurtured in
[47:41] now we can type that with the bride of
[47:43] christ friends because god
[47:45] when god sends his word it's not just to
[47:48] say on books and tapes and computers and
[47:50] phones
[47:51] or in your bible it's to be expressed in
[47:53] the life of the bride
[47:55] and there's only one woman that can do
[47:56] that the bride of jesus christ
[47:58] this message is not books and tapes this
[48:01] message is not about william branham
[48:03] he was the source that life come through
[48:05] he was just the mouthpiece
[48:06] to bring the source of life but the
[48:08] bride the body
[48:12] is the betting ground and we will see
[48:15] the fruit of this message
[48:17] in the people's lives that's the way god
[48:20] set it up that's why she's a part of her
[48:22] husband
[48:22] that's why we're a part of christ
[48:24] there's such an important position when
[48:26] she finds her place
[48:27] because she's the betting ground she's
[48:29] the nurturer she's the atmosphere
[48:31] creator
[48:31] she's the theater of new life she feeds
[48:34] that baby
[48:35] she creates an atmosphere of that baby
[48:37] none of this is man's place
[48:39] it's her place is anybody catching what
[48:41] i'm preaching this morning
[48:43] that's not man's place that's the
[48:45] woman's place
[48:47] all of that it's hers he
[48:50] is the provider she is the producer
[48:57] and they both god says in the mystery
[49:00] they both
[49:01] they go together they must be together
[49:07] so she expresses her place in two ways
[49:09] the way she is with her husband
[49:11] and the way that she is with her
[49:12] children that's what it comes down to
[49:15] the way she is with
[49:16] her husband the way she is with the
[49:17] children sisters don't forget that if
[49:18] you don't know what this revelation is
[49:20] your place what's a woman's place your
[49:23] relation and me
[49:24] behavior and mannerisms in relation to
[49:26] your husband
[49:27] that's why brother brahm says this
[49:32] no one can ever fulfill the place to
[49:35] console a man
[49:37] no one will ever he says the greatest
[49:39] gift god gives man outside of salvation
[49:42] is a godly wife her price is above
[49:44] rubies
[49:46] and he says no one can console that man
[49:48] no one
[49:49] can comfort his heart no one can give
[49:51] him affirmation
[49:52] he can be successful in all of life but
[49:55] if he doesn't have his wife's admiration
[49:57] it really doesn't mean anything to her
[50:00] only she has that certain secret
[50:03] that affects the man sometimes she can
[50:06] affect him
[50:06] badly and he just got to go
[50:10] shh she doesn't find her place he goes
[50:15] [Music]
[50:16] because she's not treating him why she's
[50:17] not and he doesn't have affirmation
[50:19] you don't have the courage to go forward
[50:21] and do what he does the energy behind
[50:23] him
[50:24] my ministry up here the visible ministry
[50:27] in public
[50:28] most of success to it besides the lord
[50:30] is this woman right here
[50:32] because there's been corrections and
[50:34] then things and discussions and things
[50:37] if i'd have headed this certain
[50:38] direction see the thing about sarah
[50:40] is when she suggested abraham go with
[50:42] hagar which i'll talk about in a minute
[50:44] when he suggested she was she was dead
[50:47] wrong
[50:48] right but later on she was used of the
[50:51] lord tell
[50:52] abraham you've got to kick the bomb one
[50:53] and the sun out there's tension in the
[50:55] camp
[50:56] she was used of the lord and he needed
[50:57] to listen to her
[50:59] this is the paradox about women
[51:03] this is the paradox about women
[51:06] sometimes they can be dead on
[51:09] and sometimes through their emotion
[51:10] they're making emotion they can be dead
[51:12] off
[51:15] and when any of you brothers figure out
[51:20] a woman and figure without
[51:23] what i just said you can preach the next
[51:26] marriage retreat
[51:29] because in some ways you're still trying
[51:30] to figure it out but you can't just dump
[51:32] it off
[51:32] you don't have nothing to say god used
[51:34] sarah to speak to abraham
[51:36] god used my wife in many ways god used
[51:38] my mom still uses her
[51:40] and so you're going to but something can
[51:42] be said
[51:43] and it just balances things out
[51:48] can you say amen
[51:52] i know what it is today i have to get
[51:54] back up here and
[51:56] remember thanks for the plug brothers
[51:58] appreciate it
[51:59] i can preach another two hours now
[52:05] no one can produce or affect children or
[52:08] a man
[52:09] like her when she's in her place
[52:12] everybody says no man can console a man
[52:15] like a woman can
[52:17] no one can produce an atmosphere for
[52:18] christ like his bride can
[52:22] she knows the type of atmosphere he
[52:24] comes down in no one can produce the
[52:26] right atmosphere
[52:28] like the bride of christ can
[52:34] you have no life of your own a woman
[52:35] can't conceive a child without him
[52:37] but he can't produce one himself without
[52:39] her so sarah is so in abraham's world
[52:43] she calls him lord
[52:45] she's so and even that i don't believe
[52:47] is mechanical to start preaching a
[52:49] doctrine that
[52:50] all you sisters need to start calling
[52:52] your husband lord you're not going to do
[52:53] it anyway
[52:57] but once again look at the deeper
[52:58] meaning it's not technically about
[53:00] saying yes my lord yes my lord
[53:02] there's been a lot of pockets sometimes
[53:04] even in our own ranks that
[53:05] take the scripture that way and boy they
[53:07] are in order their their women are
[53:09] calling their husband lord
[53:10] yes my lord yes my lord it's deeper than
[53:13] that
[53:13] it's the respect it's the honor
[53:17] it's a reverence that he's he's the king
[53:20] and it's a reverence from him that she's
[53:21] the queen
[53:22] she's not the servant she's the queen
[53:26] it's a royal relationship
[53:31] co-heirs together so sarah
[53:34] is because sarah i'm going to take two
[53:37] women now and i'm going to try to draw
[53:38] this to a close
[53:40] sarah is blessed and protected
[53:44] under a power of god because she's in
[53:47] her place
[53:49] in abraham's world in abraham's vision
[53:52] she's in that place
[53:54] submissive to that place humbly
[53:57] quiet in that place she is
[54:00] in abraham's world and because she's
[54:02] part of abraham brother bram says
[54:04] because she's in his world and stays in
[54:06] that world remember lot's wife would not
[54:08] she wanted to go to sodom and all that
[54:10] she stays right there she could have
[54:11] said well i'm going to go with lot's
[54:12] wife i want to go down in the
[54:14] into no no no she's in abraham's world
[54:16] with the promise this is what god told
[54:18] me to do this is what's going to happen
[54:20] she stayed with it she didn't understand
[54:22] sometimes can you say matt
[54:24] she had uh a difficult
[54:28] time sometimes sarah made terrible
[54:30] mistakes
[54:32] laughing in her heart towards the lord
[54:36] but all let me just say this
[54:39] all of her mistakes and all of her
[54:42] imperfections
[54:44] got overrode because
[54:47] she was in her place can anybody see
[54:51] that
[54:53] all of her mistakes and all the things
[54:55] she said a place
[54:56] even in her heart i talked about two
[54:57] sundays ago she laughed in her heart she
[54:59] had a sarcasm in her heart about the
[55:01] promise
[55:02] but god couldn't kill her god couldn't
[55:04] disown her because she
[55:06] because why she was part of abraham's
[55:09] world
[55:11] and so her mistakes were overrode
[55:16] because she was part of abraham abraham
[55:19] could not
[55:20] produce the promise without her
[55:24] she was not perfect we go right to
[55:27] her poor decision when she suggested
[55:30] hagar but even that
[55:34] terrible look what it produced in
[55:36] ishmael
[55:38] terrible decision when she made her
[55:39] husband go
[55:42] be with hagar to try to produce a son
[55:45] terrible interrupting the promise i can
[55:47] preach a whole sermon on
[55:49] completely producing an ishmael a
[55:50] terrible decision
[55:52] but let me just let's just think about
[55:53] it this way why did she do it
[55:56] she was impatient for what the promise
[55:59] of god
[56:02] so when you when you step back and look
[56:05] at that as
[56:05] bad as a decision as she made
[56:09] it still came from a desire
[56:12] for the promised son you remember
[56:16] brother brahma said
[56:17] god looks at our desires
[56:21] can you say amen and that's why our
[56:24] mistakes we ask forgiveness they're
[56:25] overruled because he's looking at your
[56:26] desire
[56:27] and sarah's desire was so much to have
[56:29] their promises it's not coming abraham
[56:31] it's not coming i suggest you go with
[56:32] hagar maybe god meant it go
[56:34] and she's messing everything up but yet
[56:36] what's it come from
[56:37] a desire for the promise of god
[56:40] and god worked it out later can you say
[56:42] amen god brought the promised son she
[56:44] just couldn't wait
[56:45] so we can be very critical of women but
[56:48] you realize when she's in her place
[56:50] god had to override even that decision
[56:52] can you say gave ishmael a place
[56:54] the decision was wrong but why did he do
[56:56] it she was
[56:57] in her place with abraham and she
[56:59] desired the promise
[57:00] with her husband one more women in first
[57:03] samuel chapter 25 and verse 2.
[57:05] first samuel 25 and verse 2.
[57:08] so this is a woman that makes mistake
[57:10] what if a woman lives with a man who
[57:11] makes a bunch of mistakes
[57:13] what if a woman tell me about a woman
[57:15] who's a god a right woman
[57:17] but her husband is a jerk
[57:21] or a husband is a mess or he's
[57:23] disrespectful
[57:25] first samuel 25 2 what is there so what
[57:27] about
[57:28] a woman that's like that i'm glad you
[57:31] asked because i'm going to read it
[57:32] first samuel chapter 25 and verse 2 and
[57:35] there was a man in mohammed
[57:36] whose possessions were in carmel and the
[57:38] man was very great and he had three
[57:40] thousand sheep and a thousand goats and
[57:42] he was shearing his sheep and caramel
[57:43] now the name of the man was nabal and
[57:45] the name of his wife
[57:46] abigail and she was a woman of good
[57:48] understanding
[57:50] and of a beautiful countenance but the
[57:52] man was churlish and evil and he
[57:55] didn't have a chance to look up churlish
[57:56] but he was evil in his doings
[57:59] and he was of the house of caleb and
[58:01] david heard now this
[58:02] is a guy within the within the group
[58:04] here of the
[58:05] children of israel david heard in the
[58:07] wilderness that native
[58:08] naval did shear his sheep david sent out
[58:11] ten young men
[58:11] and david sent it to the yemen gets you
[58:13] up so basically to make the
[58:14] long story short you know the story
[58:17] david says i'm gonna go in there and i'm
[58:18] gonna ask for some food for my man and
[58:20] i'm gonna do that
[58:21] when he gets in this nabel he says who
[58:23] is david
[58:25] who is david what is he
[58:29] disrespect for the man that's
[58:32] representing christ
[58:34] and this is the way he was abigail
[58:35] wasn't this way but her husband was
[58:40] so she's living with a man that's
[58:41] embarrassing her all the time
[58:44] i said abigail's living with a man
[58:46] that's embarrassing her all the time
[58:47] what he says he should have said that he
[58:49] should have done that he made that
[58:50] decision to
[58:52] he's he's messed up and she just keeps
[58:54] it quiet
[58:55] she probably covers for him sometimes
[58:57] she's he's always
[58:58] embarrassing her because he's just evil
[59:01] his evil doings constantly
[59:03] he's not a right man
[59:08] and i'm trying to make this story short
[59:11] but he says
[59:12] who is david who is david disrespect
[59:14] well
[59:15] when it got back david says we'll just
[59:16] get the army the other one and go take
[59:18] everything we're just going to go do it
[59:19] you know the story abigail hears they're
[59:22] coming going to destroy anything you
[59:23] know what abergo
[59:24] she's in the world of her husband
[59:28] you read the story i don't have time to
[59:29] read it she comes out representing
[59:32] to try to give get grace from david for
[59:35] her husband she's praying for her
[59:36] husband no doubt
[59:37] she's a godly woman and so here she's
[59:40] she's in the realm
[59:42] she's not saying just let david come
[59:44] serves them right
[59:45] she's with her husband and she's got to
[59:48] go out
[59:49] and deliver him in front of david
[59:53] and god blesses it she appeals to david
[59:57] david said i didn't realize what i was
[59:58] doing david backs off
[1:00:00] then she goes home she this guy doesn't
[1:00:03] even realize what i've done for him
[1:00:04] right now
[1:00:05] he's probably the same temper he had the
[1:00:07] same mess he's being
[1:00:08] complaining doing all this other stuff
[1:00:10] i've got to live with this man he don't
[1:00:11] realize i've just done
[1:00:13] it's like some sisters i've prayed for
[1:00:15] this man for years
[1:00:16] he doesn't realize how much i'm standing
[1:00:18] in the gap that god would change him
[1:00:23] and some men they still don't get it
[1:00:25] they don't see it they don't see what
[1:00:26] they've got as a godly woman
[1:00:28] and after a while it just it just it
[1:00:30] just gets to be too much
[1:00:32] i'm not i don't promote of course
[1:00:35] divorce it's against the word of god
[1:00:37] but first corinthians 7 bible says if
[1:00:39] she depart
[1:00:40] there are times when she departs if she
[1:00:43] departs
[1:00:44] let her not be married again or let her
[1:00:46] be reconciled
[1:00:47] if that little state slogan is there i
[1:00:49] don't believe in a man abusing a wife
[1:00:51] physically mentally for that many years
[1:00:53] i don't believe in a man doing that
[1:00:55] she does not have to stay with that type
[1:00:57] of thing but look how long abigail
[1:00:59] stayed look how long after
[1:01:01] these years of these evil doings
[1:01:04] and she represents him because she
[1:01:06] stayed
[1:01:08] serving her children serving her husband
[1:01:11] no matter how bad
[1:01:13] that he was being i'm not putting down
[1:01:14] any men here today i'm just saying
[1:01:16] they're sisters
[1:01:17] in those situations it's not an ideal
[1:01:19] situation
[1:01:22] and then you know the end of the story
[1:01:24] where he comes
[1:01:25] and she comes home and he i think he
[1:01:28] drinks all night or whatever you
[1:01:30] remember the story better than me
[1:01:31] and ends up i think having a heart
[1:01:34] attack and he dies
[1:01:37] so that ends it takes a long time
[1:01:39] sometimes it ends though finally it ends
[1:01:41] it ends in a tragic way but i'm looking
[1:01:44] at abigail saying
[1:01:45] sarah made her mistakes but abigail was
[1:01:48] fine
[1:01:49] her husband made a lot of mistakes but
[1:01:51] because she was in her place
[1:01:53] god still blessed her and after he was
[1:01:56] dead
[1:01:57] she remarried again guess who she
[1:01:59] married
[1:02:00] christ david was the type of christ
[1:02:05] so sister you might be lonely and you
[1:02:07] might have all these things that happen
[1:02:08] in your life but you know what
[1:02:09] spiritually you can be remarried again
[1:02:11] to the lord jesus christ
[1:02:13] he'll be your headship he'll be your
[1:02:15] guidance because god's blessing you
[1:02:16] because you did the right thing under
[1:02:18] the word of god can anybody hear what
[1:02:20] i'm saying today
[1:02:21] this place is a powerful place and
[1:02:24] whatever the situation
[1:02:25] if you're in your place god will move
[1:02:27] over time
[1:02:29] god will bless you for it
[1:02:32] oh my how long have i been
[1:02:38] nobody's saying
[1:02:42] yeah i got a watch right here i got four
[1:02:44] percent here
[1:02:47] okay ten to one wow i'm going a long
[1:02:49] time so exodus chapter one and verse 19
[1:02:53] says
[1:02:59] verse 15. actually you know the story
[1:03:02] here where
[1:03:03] this is what brother brahm takes on
[1:03:05] teaching on moses he takes the story to
[1:03:06] the children
[1:03:08] about moses's parents and pharaoh kept
[1:03:12] putting pressure on the people
[1:03:16] seven and the children of israel were
[1:03:17] fruitful and increased abundantly and
[1:03:19] multiplied and the wax is seating mighty
[1:03:21] and the land was filled with them
[1:03:22] and there arose a new king over egypt
[1:03:24] whose net knew not joseph and he said to
[1:03:26] the people behold the people the
[1:03:27] children of those who
[1:03:27] are more and mightier than we come on
[1:03:29] let us steal wisely with them
[1:03:31] lest they multiply and come to pass that
[1:03:33] when they're falling out many
[1:03:35] war they join also unto our enemies and
[1:03:37] fight against us and so get them up out
[1:03:39] of the land
[1:03:40] therefore they did set over the task
[1:03:41] masters to afflict them with their
[1:03:43] burdens
[1:03:43] and they built for pharaoh treasure
[1:03:46] cities
[1:03:47] uh pittham and ramses but the more they
[1:03:50] the more they afflicted them the more
[1:03:52] they multiplied and grew
[1:03:54] and they were and were grieved because
[1:03:56] of the children of israel and the
[1:03:58] egyptians made the children of israel
[1:03:59] serve with
[1:04:00] rigor and they made their lives bitter
[1:04:02] with hard bondage and mortar and brick
[1:04:04] and in all manner of service in the
[1:04:05] field
[1:04:06] and all their service wherein they made
[1:04:07] them serve was with rigor
[1:04:09] and the king of egypt spake unto the
[1:04:11] hebrew midwives
[1:04:12] of which the name of one was shafa in
[1:04:14] the name of
[1:04:16] pura and he said when when ye do the
[1:04:18] office of a midwife to the hebrew women
[1:04:20] and see them upon the stools if it be a
[1:04:23] son then ye shall kill them
[1:04:25] but if it be a daughter then she shall
[1:04:27] live
[1:04:28] but the midwives feared god and did not
[1:04:30] as the king of egypt commanded
[1:04:32] them but saved the men children alive
[1:04:35] and the king of egypt called for the
[1:04:37] midwives and said to him why have ye
[1:04:39] done this thing and have saved the men
[1:04:41] children alive
[1:04:42] and the midwives said this is the
[1:04:44] scripture i want to get and the midwives
[1:04:46] said unto pharaoh
[1:04:48] because the hebrew women
[1:04:51] are not as the egyptian women
[1:04:58] praise the lord that's a whole sermon
[1:05:00] right there
[1:05:02] pharaoh buddy
[1:05:06] you don't know something you are so
[1:05:09] dumb and he keeps putting pressure on
[1:05:12] the children of israel
[1:05:13] so to bring the numbers down and they
[1:05:15] keep multiplying
[1:05:17] they keep bringing more more children
[1:05:19] forth
[1:05:20] god was blessing them under trials
[1:05:23] now spiritually speaking we live in this
[1:05:25] day where egypt even sending women back
[1:05:28] to work brother brown referred to it in
[1:05:29] teaching of moses he says
[1:05:30] he said even pharaoh said we'll just put
[1:05:32] the women to work and that way they
[1:05:33] won't be home
[1:05:34] they can't have all these children and
[1:05:35] we just put the women to work he says
[1:05:37] that's what he's done today
[1:05:38] try to put the women to work it's all
[1:05:40] pharaoh
[1:05:42] it's all his pressure any of you sisters
[1:05:45] feel pressure today
[1:05:46] any of your brothers feel the pressure
[1:05:48] of this egypt around that's around us
[1:05:51] and yet under this because we're called
[1:05:54] of god
[1:05:55] like israel we just keep multiplying we
[1:05:58] keep growing spiritually
[1:06:00] i i love to see and i'm closing in a
[1:06:02] minute but i love to see
[1:06:04] under this age that is the worst age for
[1:06:07] disrespect to women
[1:06:08] everywhere we look every sunday i come
[1:06:11] in here
[1:06:11] and wednesday and i see you sisters i
[1:06:14] there's something that drops on my heart
[1:06:16] this is a miracle this is a
[1:06:18] this is a a a black eye
[1:06:22] in the eye of satan every time they walk
[1:06:24] in here
[1:06:26] godly dress godly spirit all their
[1:06:28] different personalities
[1:06:29] but such a reflection of a contrast of
[1:06:32] what this world matter of fact the world
[1:06:34] says you can't produce women like this
[1:06:36] and i say no no here they are here they
[1:06:39] are
[1:06:41] but he says we'll put them to work we'll
[1:06:43] do all this other stuff and they
[1:06:44] multiply the midwife says we're not
[1:06:45] going to do it
[1:06:46] but when pharaoh come and ask him he
[1:06:47] says you need to know something buddy
[1:06:49] you need to know something can i have
[1:06:50] that scripture again
[1:06:52] you need to know this principle the
[1:06:55] hebrew women
[1:06:56] are not as the egyptian women for they
[1:07:00] are
[1:07:00] lively rigorous
[1:07:05] in our delivered air the midwives come
[1:07:07] into them they are so healthy
[1:07:09] it's naturally speaking they're so
[1:07:11] rigorous and so healthy
[1:07:12] they have their baby boys before we can
[1:07:14] even get to them
[1:07:16] that's what that scripture means
[1:07:19] pharaoh you messed with the wrong women
[1:07:24] you don't know what you're doing you
[1:07:25] think they're like the egyptian women
[1:07:26] and i want to say that to the devil you
[1:07:28] think these women are like
[1:07:30] other women if you husbands think you
[1:07:32] think that these women
[1:07:33] are not like other women these are not
[1:07:36] the egyptian women
[1:07:38] this is a different woman sitting here
[1:07:39] in online wherever you are
[1:07:41] this is different than the egyptian
[1:07:42] women and
[1:07:44] god will multiply you god will bless
[1:07:46] what you do at home
[1:07:47] god will give you great blessings in
[1:07:49] your life god will have a trickle down
[1:07:50] effect to the decisions you make
[1:07:52] that are the right decisions when you're
[1:07:54] in your place it can only
[1:07:56] be blessing can you say amen no matter
[1:07:58] what position you're in
[1:07:59] if you find your place in jesus christ
[1:08:02] and what god's called you to
[1:08:03] then you are different than the world
[1:08:05] and never be measured by the world
[1:08:07] and your price dear sisters is above
[1:08:09] rubies here this morning
[1:08:12] we love you we thank you and we thank
[1:08:14] god for the message of the hour
[1:08:15] that brought us back to the word that i
[1:08:17] can preach a sermon like this
[1:08:19] and encourage that's why at a wedding
[1:08:21] when someone stood there and they
[1:08:23] haven't
[1:08:23] a man and a girl a man and a a woman has
[1:08:26] kept themselves pure until that wedding
[1:08:30] day can you say amen
[1:08:31] if i know that i say praise the lord and
[1:08:34] i'm going to say to the whole world in
[1:08:35] that wedding let it be known
[1:08:37] with all the perversion and all the
[1:08:39] things that go on in the world
[1:08:40] here is a couple that stayed faithful
[1:08:42] until their wedding day
[1:08:44] it needs to be praised
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:48] because the world never
[1:08:51] praises the right thing and the world
[1:08:55] never praises you women for what you do
[1:08:58] and who you are but i'm going to let
[1:09:00] pharaoh know today
[1:09:02] you messing with the wrong women because
[1:09:05] this is not
[1:09:06] like the egyptian women these women
[1:09:09] are different they're rigorous
[1:09:12] they're strong and no matter how much
[1:09:14] pressure you put on them with all the
[1:09:16] responsibilities
[1:09:17] they're still going to rise they're
[1:09:19] still going to grow spiritually they're
[1:09:21] still going to draw closer to the lord
[1:09:23] can you say amen hallelujah
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:31] dragon snotty knows johnny and with them
[1:09:34] dragon susie with different colored
[1:09:36] socks getting them to church
[1:09:39] probably miss most the service because
[1:09:41] they're back in the nursery somewhere
[1:09:44] but they're there because they love the
[1:09:47] lord
[1:09:48] didn't catch drove two hours and didn't
[1:09:51] it wasn't able to catch hardly even
[1:09:53] any of it but you were there and god is
[1:09:55] going to bless you
[1:09:56] because of your position in your place

[1:10:16] lord again and we'll just have a word of
[1:10:18] prayer and close the service
[1:10:19] but god is good amen didn't expect this
[1:10:22] to come out this way today
[1:10:23] but i believe that i press it will be a
[1:10:25] blessing to you
[1:10:26] not only to the dear sisters but also to
[1:10:29] you men
[1:10:30] and young young men now you know what
[1:10:32] kind of girl to look for young guys
[1:10:34] and girls you know what kind of girl to
[1:10:35] be and to seek
[1:10:37] to be in the lord but you husbands
[1:10:39] taking knowledge
[1:10:40] of what i've preached to you today
[1:10:41] because as your revelation grows of her
[1:10:44] position in place
