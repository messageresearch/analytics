TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just lift those up in prayer this evening god bless you each one psalm chapter 1 is what we read on sunday and we were here by ourselves with the musicians but we certainly had a good time and that archive got a little bit um the message got a little bit messed up on streaming i understand it was the ice on some of the lines and that restricted it so we apologize it should be up now clear and you can listen to it again and i'll go over a few of those things tonight that we went over sunday just finishing up so you won't miss anything there and we're going to go back to psalms chapter one but we do appreciate the response from sunday and we had about four or five of us here leading the service and sure different not having you all here that's for sure but i think they did a good job of just uh trying to create the atmosphere and i told them to get up before we all got up i said get up and sing and play your instrument and preach like there's 10 000 people out there that's the way i want you to do it and i think they did that i think they really did it and created a good atmosphere for us hopefully in our homes and such as well psalms 1 and verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper i'd like to read verse 1 again but because that's probably what i'll mostly get to tonight blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful so i i just want to speak a little bit tonight about walking sitting and standing in the wrong places walking and sitting and standing in the wrong places you don't want to be standing or sitting or walking in the wrong places but you want to be positioned in your position in the times we're living in father i pray you'll bless the word encourage the saints of god we appreciate your presence coming down and being among us we feel know that you're here and we know lord you have something to deposit into our hearts tonight and we pray father that that same anointing fathers we felt you just sweep through our souls lord and just give us a refreshing in the holy ghost may you come through the word now and be an encouragement to your people may help me help us get out of the way and encourage each one to come as believers tonight and anyone who is listening even after this lord though they be maybe unsaved or an unbeliever or someone who's on the on the border line i pray that these words would encourage them lord and get into the ark of safety and to give their all to you in these closing hours of time for lord we know that we are in the closing seconds we know we're in the last wrap-up and so lord every soul is important to you we just intercede for each one we pray you'll bless each life tonight in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you once you shake somebody's hand before you're seated tonight greet him in the name of the lord now walking and sitting and standing in the wrong places and i'm gonna make this just as simple as possible tonight and uh and go back into this a little bit i'm just rehearsing a little bit from sunday but we'll just elaborate a little bit more because uh sunday we talked about out of perfect faith the believer's position and what perfect faith is and how we get into that and if you remember we read quite a bit from that message perfect fake to show us that it wasn't necessarily brother brandon pointed to a lot of fasting and prayer although we should fast we should pray none of these things are eliminated but when he spoke the message perfect faith he gave us some different things that we can that that we would think that we would that would move us into living in a perfect faith and one of the things of course was just knowing our position jesus was in perfect faith because he knew who he was he had the confidence not human confidence but a real confidence in his position and who he was in god and what he was there to do what his purpose was on earth and when we begin to have a revelation of that that it creates confidence and faith love was another thing love works in coordination with faith and when we know how much god loves us truly loves us then our love reaches back to him and our love for one another and this creates this uh atmosphere of perfect faith and reliance and confidence that we're not so susceptible to all the fears of this world and the anxiety that's of this world you're not a sinner because you have anxiety today but we have to be reminded there is a resting place for our souls our minds our spirits we have a resting place tonight and if we'll learn as a christian how to move ourselves out of the nervousness of the world and into that position of perfect faith and try to even learn to stay in there every day how many raise your head i'd like to stay in there all every hour that's all of our challenge but we have so many things to try to pull us out of it but we've got to learn that nobody else is interested in this except believers no the message didn't come to everybody but except to believers that perfect faith is for believers nobody else wants that kind of life but we want it and so now we have to learn and be a move into an adoption maturity that we recognize the devil at every one of his tricks we recognize the fear of the world we recognize what triggers us what makes us upset what makes us unhappy what draws us down and soon as we begin to notice it we can quickly change our thoughts and say no no no we're not going there i'm staying right here in this realm of perfect faith amen and so this is something we learn it doesn't happen overnight i don't believe that a believer i believe a believer has everything he needs when he gets the holy ghost to be able to overcome but i don't believe he knows how to overcome overnight i believe we learned this i'm i'm 55 years old and i've been serving the lord for 30 some years and i'll tell you i'm still learning every day i read my devotional the last three or four days that i gave as a gift and we had and i'll tell you i'm inspired by the word of god it encourages me can you say amen and i learn things every day from him so i'm like a child when it comes to the word and i just think i'm thankful that we can be teachable can you say amen we're growing into a life of perfect faith and so now why is this man in psalms 1 why is he so blessed and and favored by god he said because he said blessed is the man he's blessed he's favored he's thriving and he's prospering because it ends saying because he's planted in the right place everything he touches prospers everything he does prosper and so why why is he's this way the the simplest answer is he's living this way because it is where he has positioned himself because it says he plants himself besides the rivers of water so it's all about positioning it's all about where you plant yourself spiritually i know where you're planted tonight physically some of you are here in uh petersburg some are in your homes somewhere on the couch i'm having to stand tonight you're on your couch but anyway i know where you're planted tonight every in every other place but i'm talking about spiritually where are you planted because where your position and how your thought life is and how you think every day that's the position that shows whether you're going to live a thriving spiritual life and we have to stay there we have to work we have to walk in that place and so it's where this man positions himself and it's in that world of perfect faith that jesus talked about i read it on sunday that jesus lived in it he lived in a realm of perfect faith the devil couldn't get to him there and it's a place that it was a world to himself that nobody else knew anything about and incidentally praise god if the prophet is preaching that jesus lives there how many knows that jesus said that where i am they may be also everywhere that jesus goes he's bringing the rest of the brother and brethren with him he's the firstborn among many brethren he says he's leading many into victory in other words it's not just jesus that goes there but wherever jesus goes he's bringing every son and daughter of god with him and if he lived in perfect faith now it's time for us to live in perfect faith and it was a world all to himself brother brown says he explains where it perfect faith masters every circumstance how many have circumstances tonight how many has had a life of no circumstances i'd like to sit down with you and see what happened you're probably not breathing the reason brother says because we have a life of circumstances and almost every day there's some circumstance so it's not that we're not going to get them it's not that we're not going to be physically sick it's not that we're going to have not going to have trials we're not going to get sicknesses cancers uh deaths all these things to deal with can't promise that whatsoever but i can promise you from the word of god he gave us an escape he gave us a promise he gave us a place to live that perfect faith can master every circumstances and he can give you things that you know that you can control because there are things you can't control but i can tell you there are things the believer controls through the faith of god amen i told someone the other day you you know you can't you can't control what happens on the outside but you can control your thought life there's a lot of people's given up if thoughts are bombarding me and so i have no control no no you do have control the bible talks about it you have control to redirect your thought life so you ought to take that as a victory tonight to say satan can only go so far because there's a domain of my thought life that i can be in control by the holy spirit i can redirect my thoughts and he wants us to do that so he lived it around perfect a perfect faith perfect faith masters every circumstance and so it's about your spiritual position it's in when it uses the words the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly standeth in the way of sinners sitteth all these words sitteth standeth walketh are all about position i know that's real that's just simple as dirt sitting standing walking is all about position and we think of it physically but he's speaking about a spiritual all these positions that we're in and place ourselves in and expose ourselves to it can be the right thing or can be the wrong thing and this this brother as an example this godly blessed man is chosen to position himself not in these positions of standing and and sitting amongst the scornful or standing and watching the way of the sinners or or walking with the council of the ungodly he distanced himself from that he intentionally positions himself spiritually that he's not going to be under those influences every one of you can do that every one of you can position yourself away from those things and so swalking standing sitting that's what i want to speak on walking sitting and standing in the wrong places i want to elaborate on it tonight because this is real this is the place sometimes that we get where we don't realize spiritually people don't know where they're at but if they stand back and look and they can they can see they've positioned themselves too close to a wrong relationship too close to feeding on something that's not right that can be from something very evil on the internet to always somebody hanging around a jonah you can position you cannot be involved in internet dirtiness but you can be always buddy and buddy with a jonah a backslidden or a person that's running away from the lord and you're staying close to them maybe you're trying to help them but you're staying so close that they're actually bringing you down and the guys on the boat with jonah eventually realize hey bud get off of my boat get off of my boat when they realized and jonah realized why the storm was happening and why all these incidents which had said listen bud we're giving you a kick whatever god wants to do with you but get off of my boat because you're causing storms in my life be loving be kind be gentle but don't let a jonah continue to be so close to you that it keeps bringing you down amen you want me to start over zach all right all right you were listening on the way okay so i can stick with it here praise the lord look at that embarrassing somebody who's late that's terrible isn't it all you remember when you're late i remember all everybody everybody's been late raise your hand that make you feel better brother zach look at all these people who've been late before all right where am i at petersburg michigan i know but where am i at in my notes so now if this position this place this uh positioning that he places a christian is is away from these things you you need to kick a jonah off your boat because he's he's in a uh sometimes they're not backslidden but they're in a place of running from god so you're talking to him maybe you're trying to help him give a word of encouragement but if you got yourself positioned close enough to them it may influence you so it's all about positioning yourself and so we're going to get into that a little bit more tonight that that uh when you were talking about walking standing sitting that about covers it wherever we are spiritually and none of those are in the counsel of the ungodly he chooses i'm not going to be around the council of the ungodly or around the path of sinners or in the seat of scorpio so the first thing in his mind is not to be open to just any influence that's around too many believers position themselves too vulnerable and too influenced by many many voices and then wonder why they have no faith and then wonder what's going on in my life why why do i feel so defeated there doesn't seem to be enough victory and they're not looking at the voices they're listening to they're not looking at where they're positioned they're not willing to pull away from something maybe they're not willing to cut maybe cut off some influences in their life they're not willing to do it and so now there's the defeat there's the thing that places you you can't live where you need to live there might need to be some real prayer to say lord what is it that i'm positioning my life too close to in order that's keeping me weak and that i couldn't be the full potential what i should be so the first thing he says is that this man walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly so to break this down this brother this sister has given a deaf ear to hear the advice and counsel of anyone ungodly he has chosen to give a deaf ear to advice or should i say screening the advice and counsel of everybody because everybody some most people have good intentions but not all council will do your life good right and so this brother this sister is saying i'm not i don't want to listen to the counsel of the ungodly he's not going to follow the advice their advice or their example and you should know friends that in our world you can receive counsel and counseling with not even going to pay and sit on a couch with a counselor in our world and in our environment i don't know if paul would have had to spoke about this as much as i do in his day or even back in luther's day but in our day people are receiving counsel and advice and guidance all the time but most of it's not good you have to sit down on a couch at a psychologist and and pay him 300 bucks an hour to get counseling every day you're getting guidance and counseling by what we read by the news we're being guided a certain way can you say man that the news intentionally guides a certain way and so now everybody else may swallow that everybody else may say you know i'm fine with that but but not us because listen now we had to screen the council that we get we got to watch the council that we get we got to know the source that it comes from and and we got to know what we trust can you say man and you can get counsel of what to do and you didn't even ask for that counsel but you're getting counseled people go and find the counselor that they want to find they only pick the people that's going to agree with them or they're only going to go visit places they can feel better about the guilt that they feel so they're only going to hang around and get the advice of ones that's going to tell them what they want to do i don't think that's wisdom can you say man so now you can you you can get counsel of what to do and you didn't even ask for it sometimes and you can sit right in your home with your phone and receive all kinds of influence within just minutes counsel is counsel is advice given whether formal or informal so it can be a formal counsel and somebody's telling you i'm going to give you some advice or it can just be informal and that means you can receive counsel but it it wouldn't be the right counsel it can mean guidance it can mean direction so you can get guidance by many things in this life and we must screen and we must be holy ghost filled to say i do not wan i want to make sure that i'm not receiving the counsel of the ungodly i don't want to position myself where i'm receiving the counsel of the ungodly you can receive guidance by movies you better choose the movies that you watch because you can receive guidance by that you can receive guidance by the music that you listen to you receive guidance by the books that you read can you say that you're being counseled you're being guided you're being directed a certain way you can receive guidance and counsel from the political voices that are in this world you can be influenced and guided by that political voice there's a lot of information out there especially on the information highway and daniel prophesied and said in our day that knowledge shall increase are we living there knowledge the wisdom of this world there's so much knowledge out there and some of it's good but you see when a christian is looking to the word of god he has an absolute in his life and he really has to be saying lord i don't want to receive the counsel of the ungodly you have given me a source to go to first and if you're not reading this and you're not wanting if you're not reading the word and going to that first and you're going to be swayed a million different ways because the wisdom of this world is very persuasive especially the teenagers especially the teenagers so um there's a lot of information and so but you see now by swallowing by and information is not a bad thing uh is information isn't necessarily a bad thing but swallowing it too quickly not putting it through the word sometimes making quick decisions on those things is not a right thing to do and we don't go with all the political extremes that's in the world today and the conspiracies and the fears politically it's swayed so many different ways but mostly either to fear or to conspiracies or to extreme and both sides whether extreme they are are it's both fear but it's the either conspiracy side or government control side you know what i'm talking about it's but it but it's all i i i i we we cannot go with being swayed by those spirits of the end time and and then there are some message people that are swayed politically and they're even using then they then they get some scriptures and quotes together and then they call it right he's just talking to brother steven shrew about this he'll be in not this sunday but next sunday to visit they're attending the church now so we're going to welcome the family next sunday but you know just talking to him about it the other day it's it's just amazing how swayed we can be and even sometimes in this message people standing for uh conspiracy theories and all these things that they read using quotes and using scriptures i'm just going to say as your pastor be very careful of what you read and not try to attach and put it the puzzle together you have to be careful of the sources and what's being said is that okay and i say that just as polite as i can say it but because we have that happening on both sides we can't just receive the counsel of a source and think that's okay we have to be prayerful we have to be praying we have to be guided by the word and the holy ghost in our lives or we will swing certain ways and not even realize that we're taking the council of the world or the council of the ungodly just because it sounds right doesn't mean it's always right not getting a lot of amens there but i'll say myself amen brother paul you know what we we're not identified ourselves first by democrats or republicans you may be tonight and i respect that but we're not totally identified by that that's not our identification i'm just reminding you conservatives are liberals you may swing a certain way but that's not our identification we're christians we're believers of this message we know what's coming down the road i can't believe people are so surprised sometimes they don't know their message they don't know their bible some of these things are supposed to be happening amen and if they knew their message and they knew their bible they wouldn't be so fearful because fearful sights fearful things men's hearts shall fail them for fear pestilences will continue and increase can you say amen brother brown says cancer will be a tooth day to what's coming down the road there's things coming on the face of the earth i'm not afraid of it because the word said it had happened but the word also said he gave me a hiding place to live in he gave me a hiding place he gave me an atonement and that atonement was good from calvary all the way to 2022. if i get sick if i'm gonna die i have an atonement to go to my god i have healing in the blood of the lamb let's not forget that though god heals true medicine god heals through different things god uses vaccines and all these other things let's not forget our atonement that god has for us didn't intend on saying those things and i don't want to be political but i want to say remember we're not liberals or conservatives we are believers we are christians can you say man this word is our absolute this is what we should be clinging to this is what we should look lord where's my guidance in the word of god amen some people's strong views originate in what they've been feeding on and not the word boy some strong views today not balanced by the word of god when that happens we got to remember we're believers and what we're feeding on has to be balanced and checked by the word of god you might want to quit feeding on it so much you do what you want to do but if this if this scripture and i'm saying i feel that this scripture this psalms 1 1-3 and you've read it hundreds of times i think this scripture applies to where we're living right now because we're in a place we've got to know that we're not positioned under the influence mainly of anything but be planted by the rivers of water and by the word of god standing in perfect faith and then make your individual choices for your family of what's needed and what medicines need and all that make those choices being led by the holy spirit but never lose your absence is that okay with everybody some strong views and people get such strong views and you know and and if you watch sometimes it's just us tonight right and the rest that's the world watching here whoever's but you watch sometimes some people influence and i only say this because i last year remember i apologize for being just a tad too political even over the pulpit i don't want to become that way because we're not called to be that i have my personal political opinions i i get frustrated what things are going on but i can only let that go on so far because some things you're not going to stop you're not going to change it so you're not going to change it by voting you're not going to change it by raising a big revolt to it you're not going to change it by that it's not our calling can you say man our calling to say is as to stay as gideon saying tonight burning the midnight oil keep my lamp trend and burning let me say full of the holy ghost ready i've heard the midnight cry but i'm ready to go with him that's our calling and so now people get strong views feeding on certain things but they're not balanced by the word of god we're believers we have to be reminded of that and and my bible reads that we all will come in the unity of the faith my bible reads that we should all speak the same thing now how do you how do you pattern that with a world and a nation now that's in a civil war and in such a divide and digging their heels in on both sides if we let that come amongst us we'll be dividing over opinions and my bible says that we're supposed to come in the unity of the faith how are we going to come to that if we're influenced by the spirits that's in the world i ask you even listening on the internet how in the world do we come to the unity of the faith how do we come all speak the same thing and we're not even we're not there yet but i believe the holy ghost if he said in his word we're going to get there but we certainly can't get there if we're influenced by these strong opinions both sides and all of a sudden you get into conversations which you get into with somebody that's in the church or someone is like okay and you start digging in their heads all of a sudden you're divided on something and you're choosing to divide over that i don't think we should let that happen i think we should say brother i'll pray for you you pray for me help me to be balanced can you say amen but help us both to stay in the word to see a unity of the faith to see the holy ghost movement among us to see souls save to see our young people filled with the holy ghost can we get together on that and lay the political stuff aside because they ain't going to get us nowhere why are we becoming so much more divided because the spirit of our country is dividing i was talking to brother stephen and he had a good point it's clear you can see people get under a spirit of a nation that's in civil war right now and they not realize and i said they don't realize what spirit they get under we don't realize what spirit we get under sometimes politically motivated but yet he said i thought it was good if you're under that you had to first open yourself up to it to receive the spirit of it i thought it was a good point thank you brother stephen for saying that because nobody takes a spirit without first opening themselves up to it without clicking onto something and they opened the door so now they're teeter-totter maybe they're not possessed yet but it was a minister who said here the other day that i think during the retreat online there is a a christian can't be possessed but he can certainly be influenced by a spirit never full possession but he can be influenced you as with the holy ghost can be influenced by the wrong spirit amen you get over in a spirit of anger or something you act out a place you got to make that right right away can you say amen and you're going what's in here well a sprung spirit came in the home between you and your wife or whatever and so you may have all the holy ghost in the world but sometimes you got to repent and say god i see that's the wrong spirit that's working in me amen praise the lord so it's what we feed on and uh you open yourself spirit to spiritual son you open yourself to it then you can take on this thing it's kind of like the black dog white dog story and you can pull that quote up somebody told me brother braham says in 64 somebody told me one time was converted received the holy ghost received the holy ghost and he said to him how are you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad now he got the holy ghost and he how are you getting along pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty pretty good he said well since me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them is black a black dog one of them is a white dog and said they argue all the time said they growl and fight at one another this is the indian chief describing what's happened to him since he received the holy ghost and these dogs are arguing and fighting each other time and i said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well chief which one of them wins the fight that depends on which dog which one chief feeds the most it's 1964 everybody i don't know why i have to bring up the year but i'm bringing it up brother brenham says that depends on what chief feeds the most so i think brother bram said that's a good answer see there's just just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that's the person with the holy ghost we're to move to adoption we're to move to an overcoming life can you say man but i guarantee you you feed on the wrong things you're going to be defeated and you're going to win victories you're going to lose victories and it all goes back to what you're feeding on questions you should ask if you're feeding on the council of the world is this right council is it truth is it trusted is it tested you should ask those questions a believer should not be living on google for information for the decisions they make all the time not following the dating habits of the worldly shows said that sunday don't live on the advice of people who have left the message and form their own life with what they want of the bible don't don't be under the advice of people like that their fruits show that that's not headed in the right direction so you're not taking scriptures and advice from them they're teaching the scriptures but but watch where their life is going so that's the counsel of someone that has not got the pattern of a life can you say amen and so now if this is some of the influences in your life you will never grow to more faith this uh blessed believer in psalms 1 is not influenced by those things he don't walk in the counsel of the ungodly he's not planted near the council of the ungodly he's not opening his spirit to just anything being said can you say amen we better make sure the council mostly comes if not all from the lord and a holy ghost-filled person don't underestimate someone that you know has the holy ghost to get advice from them don't underestimate what god can speak through them to help you and i'd rather go to a person maybe a little sister in the church sister yeah a sister she's got the holy ghost like a brother and you young sisters should go to the sisters that show that they have the holy spirit in their life and ask advice we don't do that a lot today young people don't ask for advice from the older ones but i'm not just saying the older ones they have some wisdom i'm saying i know this person has the holy spirit in their life they've proved it for years so i can trust i'd rather listen to what they have to say been through it been there done that been through the trials and there's that consistent life now just living for the lord i ought to have my ears open to somebody like that instead of some google or some scallywag or someone that's left the message i ought to be clinging to a holy ghost believer amen amen the next thing he does is that okay now that's the first part is that don't he doesn't he doesn't uh walk with the counsel of the ungodly now he doesn't uh stand in the path of sinners that's an obvious thing that we shouldn't stand in the path of sinners but standing in the path of them doesn't mean you're going down their path it means you're you're standing in the path watching them in the path they're going down you're around them you're watching what they're doing you're standing in the path not necessarily following them but just standing and watching what they do all day you're feeding on what they do and maybe how exciting their life is oh i would never do some of the things that they're doing but it's just fun just to get on and watch them in the path that they're on what path they headed down most of them going to hell amen so you're going to stand on the path to somebody oh i'm not on the path i'm not heading that direction i'm a message believer but you stand all day on the internet and you're standing there watching the path that they're going down this believer says listen i'm not going to stand and position myself watching the path they're going on i could be watching something else amen praise the lord so it's all day feeding on what they do and how exciting their life is how many know the scientists if you sit there all day and listen to that stuff somebody else's life is everybody's life is more exciting than yours their vacations are better than yours your life is a miserable failure you're nothing you're sitting there in your little three-bedroom house and you'll never reach up to where they're at you'll never make a cobbler as good as that person on the internet that's what the whole thing is about and now that's where depression comes from i'll never look like them i'll never have the beauty of them i don't know this is what our world has become christians should not be taking their cues and watching the way and the path of sinners are going down we've got a word to look at can you say man we've got the glory of christ among us god's doing things and we can be looking at something else besides the path they're going down and we can we got another path because the bible says that we can walk in the path in the light of the word thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path that's the path i want to be on can you say man you ever sit and watch you ever sit and just watch people for a long time at walmart oh no i should have said that it's it can be a very entertaining day you can see where our world is at right there in central just take four hours if you've got that and if you want an entertaining day it probably for a believer will burn you to become a prayer warrior to see the condition people are in but an airport is another place if sometimes i'm stuck in an airport and it's pretty funny friends just sitting and watching people got a little discernment and you just see and it can be and my son and i were talking about on monday i sent a picture to my kids because the ymca i went to the ymca and the parking lot was packed with cars on monday you might have been there yourself i was there and the place you couldn't find a parking spot of course that's what happens every year all the new year's resolutions the place was packed but some of the things that my son and i saw were chuckling about is this all these big guys coming in there which i'm one of them big guys come in you haven't seen them in there all year but they're coming in and they're going to do everything in one day and there's lines waiting for the bench press and there's lie waiting for the weights and they're going to lift 160 pounds on the first day and they're killing themselves through it it's funny to watch he had a blast watching them and here he's working for months to work up to 160 they're going to do it the first day and they're dying and you probably won't even see them tomorrow it's true it lasts about two or three weeks and spring comes along and it's like well i wore myself that out that's it it's funny to watch people sometimes and so in our nature we watch those things and we watch people but in our nature we can get on the internet and we can just watch people and if we're not strong ourselves we can be influenced by watching the path of others if we're not strong in the holy ghost we start to get we say well maybe there's something to that no no there's nothing to it amen just standing and watching the sinners go on their path a path that leads to a wrong place don't forget watching the life of the backslidden person as i said about jonah we shouldn't do that because it weakens us it's not a good position to be in to be standing in the way of sinners it's not good to be it's not going to be walking in the counsel of the ungodly it's not good to be standing in the path of sinners watching which direction they're going now let me do this deal with this one just before we wrap it up here tonight he doesn't sit in the seat of the scornful and that means the scoffers that can mean people that are critical how many's ever been around critical people you might be one tonight i've been critical before the seed of scornful can mean many things brother bram says i was sitting in the sea the scornful back in 1955 or 56 uh maybe a little later when he got the church and some pentecostals came in and they started to dance and had the tambourine and go at it and the baptist like he was he said my i got real critical i said look what they're doing to my church they're tearing things up they're dancing they're shouting around this place he said i he said i was sitting in the seat of the scornful sat there for 15 20 half a half hour just being just as critical man i'm gonna have to get up and bring some church order this church and just being critical i was sitting in the seat of the scornful be careful what we say when the spirit is moving i know that people sometimes get in the flesh but i would rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all and if someone gets way out of line sure we'll we'll bring them in line will correct him but listen listen let the spirit move let him do what he wants to do amen if we start restricting that we become like a denomination can you say amen we got to let the lord do what he wants to do and so he was scorned for these pentecost until god convicted him in the service that you're sitting in the sea of scornful and he reminded him in the bible of david dancing and embarrassing his wife and dancing before the lord this is exactly what they did in the bible it's what they did on the day of pentecost that's what they did throughout when the blessings of the lord that may not be the anointing because brother bram says the anointing is something different but then the blessings come we ought to enjoy it and let everybody else enjoy it i believe the blessings came in here tonight the whole presence of the lord blessed us tonight we ought to enjoy every moment because we don't get every day like that on a wednesday night the lord visited us and we begin to get blessed can you say amen and the anointing of the word my we ought to say thank you lord for this wednesday night thank you for blessing me he said he would give us times of refreshing and you tell me in here tonight who doesn't need times of refreshing in the day we live in every one of you need a time of refreshing and the more that we can have the better can you say amen he's given us a time of refreshing tonight and we ought to thank god for it but i'll tell you when you're sitting in the seat of the stormfall like brother branham was and so this is i'm going to elaborate sitting around people who complain being around people who are critical being on the internet with somebody who's constantly critical somebody who mopes all the time somebody who's moping all the time now you might try to encourage a person like that and and uh that's great if you can do that i find with people it's hard to pull them out of that stuff and so you can give all your efforts to it but if they keep staying and they're they're moping then you just say i'm going to pray for you they got to encourage you you got to be careful how much you hang around moping critical people trying to find the fault and everything all the time because we're we're called to be positive we're called to give a positive word we're called to talk about our victories not our defeats can you say amen and i don't mean be phony that we don't have defeats we do but but when david was called before goliath goliath and all the children of israel and saul when he got up in front of him and he gave his testimony he told of his victories with the bear and with the lion he didn't share his defeats he shared his victories at that moment was time to share his victories goliath is not a problem because i've done this through the spirit of the lord i've done this back about five years ago i did this god gave me the victory in this i'm living in victory in this i'm testifying i've got the power to be able to handle goliath and he shared his victories he maybe didn't share the time he ran away from such an animal i don't know so david would have never done that how do you know that he didn't share those times he just shared the time when he wrestled them down and the spirit of the lord came on me and goliath is no big deal so you get around negative people and they're they're really negative and really critical and they're always talking about what's wrong and they're always talking about the hurts of the past and they're always talking about what decisions were made that they disagree with and they always talk about and they and if you hang around negative people who never talk about the kingdom and why we come to church and what god's really doing these souls you never hear it there are people sometimes you never hear from them unless it's a it's a warning or it's a it's a critical thing of something that's going never hear from them otherwise and i'm sitting here as the pastor and if i did that i know about a lot of things that's going on i know negative things are going i know more a lot more than what you think and i know the negative things and the devils defeating people and and sometimes people get bound by things i know some of the private things if people share them with me i'm the one that probably could get down and say is this worth it or not that's right but i can't do that because why i got a whole host of other things that i can pull my thoughts away that and say but look what god's doing look at this new soul that come in look at this brother who's been bound for 20 years look at this heart that grew up underneath the wrong thing and now they're coming to life so i just switched my thoughts i could get more down by being critical more than anybody but we can't do it we can't become negative and live in that realm because we can't position ourselves and one of the things is to position yourself sitting sitting sitting with the scornful so the standing one we have the walking one but we have the sitting one which sometimes that's where it's at in a living room at the coffee shop and they're going to come and unload on you they're going to just share their heart in a few things and after about an hour there isn't anything positive there and so then you go and meet with them again six months and it's the same things over and over again and after a while you had to say listen you know i pray that god will help you and i'll encourage you but i you can't sit with this at the seat of the scornful or you'll become critical how many has been there done that there was a preacher one time and he uh he had a lot of trouble he called another preacher and he's always putting his wife down putting his wife down putting his wife down it's all i seem to talk about i could give the name and you probably know it but i wouldn't do that this preacher he's called and so this other preacher who heard him on the phone he'd never done that very much to his wife but he noticed in the next coming weeks he started to do the same thing with his wife he'd never done it before he became real critical of her and putting her down and look how you do that and just laughing sarcastic about her and all this other stuff and he all well once he picked up on it he realized wow it's the influence of this guy who's made it a normal just to put your wife down he said god forgive me call the guy says i realize that's not right i don't want to do that forgive me the things i said about my wife to you i shouldn't have said that and got it on track what was it influence of somebody else bringing in a normal that's not normal people that are negative and critical live that way they're not happy they're not content in the lord they're not thriving but you don't want to become that way yourself and so you don't want to sit in the seat of the scornful complain critical hanging around people that never talk about the kingdom what god's really doing in souls you never hear them talk about what god's doing in their life you never talk about the positive what the words being preached what the word's doing in their life it's all about the administration it's about what church decisions are being made or it's about the voting or it's about pushing their opinions on everybody i respect everybody's opinion but people who live in that realm and you never hear them talk about anything else there's a problem because we're not here from administrations and voting on colors and we're not here for that we're here to have church we're here for souls can you say amen god's blessed us they have some beautiful things but we can have church without any of this i want to tell you that we have governments and administrations and deacons and all these other things to have church order and all that but don't ever let that distract you friends and if you ever have a question about anything the the door is open always ask a question that's fine that's fine but don't become burdened downed and succumbed by church business or by things maybe even in a church you went to before don't just say listen let's go on with god amen work through those things take them to the cross and you have to forgive because sometimes people do you wrong you have to forgive they may not ask for forgiveness but you're you're forgiving from your heart so you can be free you don't forgive because of them you forgive so you can be free and that's hard to do sometimes listen let's not get bogged down by how loud something is it's loud for me sometimes that's another thing i said last sunday when all of you weren't here i told these guys to play as loud as they wanted and they did i wouldn't they know i wouldn't normally say that but like a balance sound and a good sound man like ike's back there to balance it all but we're still working on this building it bounces around and and so we're still a work in progress here so give us grace we're working on it and here i am defending and explaining myself but it's not it's not about that ultimately what are we here for it's not about what we wear it's not about who's hurt me we got to focus on the right thing and brother bran says the bride is always positive we got a positive word we got a positive thing he's doing and i don't mean to pretend that uh that we don't have negative and pretend problems aren't there we should deal with problems that's that's being phony we do have issues we have problems to work through but don't let it get you bogged down and give up is that okay amen that's the people you don't really want to hang around all the time the people that are constantly talking about how who hurt them and people that they don't trust and it's never about the kingdom it's about finding fault all the time the bible said there'll be scoffers in the last days sarcastic about the dresses that you wear sisters sarcastic about your uncut hair sarcastic about the holy life you're trying to live scoffers in the last day so where's the promise of his coming and we don't want to be influenced by that can you say man i i don't want to sit too long in atmospheres that are not positive and you shouldn't either there's a statement if you guys want to put it up i always like this statement great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people i read that 30 years ago great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people i'd like to take that to a higher level to the message the best minds are submitted to god and they discuss the promises of god coming into those promises in their life that's the great minds not just ideas it's god's promises can you say man let me take it a little higher i'll just blow your mind right now scripture says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus there's a mind who thought it not robbery to be equal with god and made himself of no reputation true humility but yet true confidence in his position and he said let that kind of mindset be in you wow i'd like to be thinking about that can you say amen let me blow your mind again look at this quote in christ the mystery look what was once god's great secret everybody's familiar with this what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put into the hearts of the believer next quote says that's what every genuine believer has to do so separate yourself from these doubters separate yourself from the unbelievers and walk with christ it's life to you and abraham did such a thing and 25 years later we find him still believing the same promise why he had focused his mind to the will of god by the word of god and believed it if we can focus ourself to the plan of god for to what god wants for us and what god promised us and let everything else alone there's that psalms 1 christian separate yourself from these doubters and unbelievers and scorners negative people critical people you'll become that way yourself if you hang around that long enough he says another place but i think today when we see our sisters wearing long hair as the bible said that they should i think it's a nazarite sign that they want to follow the lord and i know that sounds flat and i want it to go home see because it's it looks like somebody is trying to do keep uh something that god told them to do no matter what the price the world has to say about it out there and how many scornful or laughers or critics that doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world and to the things of god they'll obey the word and separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them i know they stand criticism but if we wasn't criticized then there'd be something wrong the world always knows its own but i've said that remember criticism on account of the word of god is only growing pains of his grace it shows that you have separated yourself when you're getting criticized if you're the one getting criticized it shows that you've separated yourself it shows you're living in another world another kingdom and when you it shows that you've been separated to be a christian to act like one to live like one to obey the commandment of god and it's a nazareth vow to separate to call from god that separates you from the things of the world i believe tonight that every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of god is a nazarite unto the lord because they have separated them things themselves from the cares of the world and whatever the world has got to say praise the lord amen amen don't sit in the seat of the scornful don't stand in the way of sinners don't walk in the counsel of the ungodly pull yourself away from that be polite be courteous okay because we have to be a witness in testimony but there's certain influence you just pull away from because why you want to position yourself which goes to the next scripture we'll maybe take it up sunday morning i want to elaborate on this where this man's delight is then because if you pull yourself away with you know that's the thing about loneliness sometimes if you pull yourself away which a lot of people don't do that but when you pull yourself away we're human beings you have to fill it with something else and i find a lot of times you go through that signification somebody pull themselves away from all this stuff but you don't feed it with the word of god and good fellowship and develop some other friends you're going to feel pretty lonely there you're going to get depleted and you might turn back to some of those things but when you pull away you got to fill it and that's what this guy did his delight became the law of the lord his delight became the law of the lord and he meditated day and night so i want to talk deeper about our thought life because that's what we have control over what's in your thought life mind is really who you are and that's what's really going on can't deny it that's what's really going on and even a christian for many years can be locked up in their thought life and if they could get victory there i believe they can have victory other places the whole time they're just out here they're worshiping maybe doing everything and they're bound right here something's kind of stuck they're obsessed with something and it's just like they're they're stopped right there never move sometimes for years never move from that thought and paul says casting down imagination and every thought that lifts itself above the knowledge of god so we must have the power to cast down binding thoughts that's lifted itself above you see that we're going to have other thoughts but when it lifts itself to be the dominant thought above christ above your victory in christ that's when it becomes wrong you might have thoughts come to you but it becomes the dominant thing that binds you and christ is down here think about him down here but he says cast down every thought that lifts itself above the knowledge of christ so i might get the thoughts and down here but they're not allowed to go very far because you're but because this guy he's uh obsessed with he is obsessed with something i meditate day and night in the law of the lord that's why i gave you the devotionals you don't have to use that let's stay in the word of god this year spend a little time in the word of god here grab that thought for the day and say man i'm going to think about that and when satan brings you into something else i'm going right back to that thought let me dwell on it controlling your thought life so let's talk about that the lord willing sunday and let's uh let's spend some time more time in the word and we'll let you go home tonight someone said that i was sunday afternoon we were supposed to talk about goals a little bit and we got cheated out of that but i'm going to take two minutes here and you can just close that as the service there and i just want to say it's not rocket science people are asking
