[0:00] and make cakes upon the earth isn't this
[0:02] just like a husband
[0:03] who invites somebody over and forgets to
[0:05] tell the wife and said
[0:06] i need you to quit do a meal and abraham
[0:09] ran under the herd and fetched a calf
[0:11] tender and good and gave it unto the
[0:13] young man and he hasted to dress it
[0:15] and he took butter and milk and the calf
[0:16] which he had dressed and set it before
[0:18] them and he stood by them under the tree
[0:20] and they did eat
[0:21] and they said unto him where is sarah
[0:23] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[0:25] and he said i will certainly return unto
[0:27] thee
[0:28] according to the time of life and lo
[0:31] sarah thy wife shall have a son
[0:33] and sarah heard it in the tent which was
[0:35] behind him and abraham and sarah were
[0:37] old
[0:37] well-stricken in age and it ceased to be
[0:39] with sarah after the manner
[0:41] of women and therefore sarah laughed
[0:43] within herself
[0:44] saying after i am waxed old shall i have
[0:47] pleasure with my lord
[0:48] uh being old also and the lord said unto
[0:51] abraham wherefore did sarah laugh
[0:53] saying shall i have surety bare child
[0:55] which i'm old
[0:56] is anything too hard for the lord at the
[0:59] time appointed i will return
[1:01] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:03] and sarah shall have a son
[1:05] he says it again to her he reaffirms the
[1:08] promise that he got years ago
[1:10] in a visitation from god years ago he
[1:12] comes in another visitation to reaffirm
[1:15] i'm going to visit you so you so i want
[1:18] to speak this morning
[1:19] these visits from god and these final
[1:21] visits from god these are significant
[1:23] visits of the lord these are significant
[1:25] visitations of the lord
[1:27] early in his journey and now here at the
[1:29] end and then he speaks of another visit
[1:32] that will bring life to sarah these are
[1:34] important visits
[1:36] these are important times let me finish
[1:39] up here in the reading
[1:41] is anything too hard for the lord at the
[1:43] time appointed i will return unto thee
[1:45] according to the time of life and sarah
[1:47] shall have a son then sarah denied
[1:49] saying i laugh
[1:50] not for she was afraid and he said nay
[1:53] but doubt its laugh
[1:54] and the men rose from fence and looked
[1:56] toward sodom and abraham went with them
[1:59] to bring them on the way and the lord
[2:01] said shall i hide from abraham that
[2:03] thing which i do
[2:04] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[2:07] a great
[2:08] and mighty nation and all the nations of
[2:10] the earth shall be blessed in him
[2:12] for i know him that he will command his
[2:14] children
[2:15] and his household after him and they
[2:17] shall keep the way of the lord to do
[2:19] justice and judgment which the lord
[2:20] may bring upon abraham that which he has
[2:23] spoken of him
[2:25] and the lord said because the cry of
[2:28] sodom
[2:29] and gomorrah is great and because their
[2:32] sin
[2:32] is very grievous now just to stop here
[2:35] does anybody
[2:36] see that we're right exactly in this
[2:38] position
[2:41] this is written here just as a type can
[2:43] you say man it happened but it's typing
[2:45] our day
[2:46] so this visitation is important because
[2:49] this
[2:50] visitation is where we stand today where
[2:52] the sin is heaped up in sodom and
[2:54] gomorrah
[2:55] but look what he says here now what's
[2:56] going to happen this transition
[2:58] and the lord said because the cry of
[3:00] sodom and gomorrah is great and because
[3:01] their sin is very grievous
[3:03] i will go down and see whether they have
[3:06] done
[3:07] all together according to the cry of it
[3:10] which is come unto me
[3:11] and if not i will know he is going to go
[3:15] visit sodom himself and investigate
[3:18] if it's as bad as they really say
[3:21] and the men turned their faces from
[3:24] fence
[3:25] and went towards sodom but abraham
[3:29] stood yet before the lord
[3:32] praise the lord i'll just add one more
[3:35] scripture
[3:36] over in the next last visitation in
[3:39] chapter 21 and verse 1.
[3:45] praise god and the lord visited
[3:48] sarah as he had said
[3:51] and the lord did unto sarah as
[3:54] he had spoken praise the lord that's
[3:58] going to happen with us friends
[4:00] it's happening with us but there's a
[4:01] final visit that i'm looking for
[4:03] gideon sang about it this morning
[4:05] there's a soon and very soon
[4:07] there's a final change of these bodies
[4:11] father bless your word you have come
[4:15] already lord and
[4:16] expressed yourself in such a wonderful
[4:18] way through the songs
[4:20] and we just know that you're present it
[4:23] makes us lord almost
[4:24] your glory fills this place it makes a
[4:28] minister almost want to just stand back
[4:30] lord and
[4:31] just i so want to be used of you today
[4:33] to be the vocals for you lord
[4:36] to be able to hear your voice and speak
[4:39] those things that are needful
[4:41] bless your people bless those
[4:44] as we were thanking many who labored for
[4:46] the meetings blessed them for it
[4:48] and we thank you for the move of god and
[4:51] the changed lives
[4:53] the many testimonies that are coming in
[4:55] lord of
[4:56] of things that we didn't know about and
[4:58] things that we didn't know were laying
[5:00] there
[5:01] and god you come down and spoke things
[5:03] that we
[5:04] we didn't even know and you change lives
[5:07] and you as the song says father you took
[5:10] that which is couldn't be broken and you
[5:12] broke it lord and you
[5:14] you did the impossible lord jesus will
[5:17] take time as we hear these testimonies
[5:19] we'll share them and we'll give glory to
[5:21] you for them lord
[5:22] thank you for what you did in the
[5:24] meetings meet with us and speak to us
[5:27] this morning once again
[5:28] and we'll give you the glory for it in
[5:31] the name of jesus christ
[5:32] amen praise the lord you may be seated
[5:40] i want to speak on the final visits from
[5:43] god
[5:44] the final visits from god
[5:48] and keeping in mind that abraham the
[5:52] father of faith the father of the faith
[5:54] seed
[5:55] what god did in abraham's entire life
[6:00] is a type of how god will visit the
[6:04] church and visit
[6:05] his royal seed from jesus christ who was
[6:08] the royal seed of abraham
[6:10] until the rest of the sons and daughters
[6:12] come culminating in the last days in
[6:15] these last days
[6:16] we find the royal seed of abram has had
[6:18] a journey and
[6:20] in that journey you'll see similar
[6:22] visits from god
[6:23] like as with our father abraham and
[6:26] these visitations
[6:27] should be studied because they're so
[6:29] important but i want to focus
[6:31] on the final visits and jesus himself
[6:34] just so i can tie it together for you
[6:37] jesus
[6:38] pointed to the end time in his
[6:39] prophecies in luke and when he pointed
[6:42] to the end time
[6:43] he used the son of man term and he says
[6:46] so shall it be
[6:47] in the coming of the son of man and he
[6:49] will come
[6:50] and then he tied it to sodom and
[6:52] gomorrah he tied
[6:54] the coming of the lord and the coming of
[6:55] the son of man he tied it with sodom and
[6:58] gomorrah
[6:59] so we know when sodom and gomorrh has
[7:01] risen to a place
[7:02] that judgment is hanging over it we know
[7:05] that we're
[7:06] in already in the time of the son of man
[7:09] he has already come in word form can you
[7:11] say amen
[7:12] we go to meet him in the air but he has
[7:15] already come because the son of man
[7:17] was already visiting abraham when this
[7:20] sodom condition came up can you say amen
[7:23] that's very significant so this visit
[7:25] this particular visit of god
[7:28] was so significant for our time and that
[7:30] he revealed
[7:31] as son of man and uh you know i love to
[7:34] talk about
[7:35] god visiting his people it's an
[7:38] honor when he shows up can you say man
[7:42] it is an honor and i've lived this my
[7:44] whole life god filled me with the holy
[7:46] ghost when i was 16.
[7:47] i never grow weary or tired i never
[7:50] it never becomes common when he shows up
[7:53] and gives a visit to us it never becomes
[7:56] common to me
[7:57] and it should never become common to you
[8:00] it is an honor when god visits his
[8:02] people
[8:03] and as a dispensation god come
[8:06] after many thousands of years and
[8:09] visited this final generation
[8:11] through the ministry of not a reformer
[8:14] not just a godly man not a man that just
[8:16] had a healing gift
[8:18] but a manifestation of the son of man
[8:20] himself
[8:21] brother brad and being and let me make
[8:23] this distinction because people
[8:24] can't seem to make it they think that
[8:26] we're making making a man god
[8:28] no brother branham was a son of man but
[8:31] he was revealing
[8:32] the son of man brother branham was not
[8:35] the son of man
[8:36] jesus christ is the son of man but this
[8:38] end time visitation
[8:40] was a special visitation because the son
[8:43] of man is going to reveal himself
[8:45] through the end time ministry so we're
[8:47] not waiting for that to come
[8:49] we're in that coming right now you know
[8:51] what you won't hear many preachers
[8:53] preaching that
[8:54] on that in the in the community today
[8:56] and i'm not putting them down but i'm
[8:58] saying
[8:58] we're not waiting for the coming of the
[9:00] son of man we're living during the times
[9:02] because jesus worded it he said the
[9:04] revealing of the son of man
[9:06] he didn't necessarily the say the
[9:08] physical return of jesus christ
[9:10] he said the revealing the revealing is
[9:12] an unveiling
[9:14] he's going to unveil jesus christ he's
[9:16] going to unveil who jesus is
[9:18] can you say amen this is the time of the
[9:20] revealing of the son of man
[9:22] and it's in the time when sodom heaps up
[9:25] and when god visits his people because
[9:29] god is god he can appear in different
[9:32] forms
[9:33] can you say amen because god is god he
[9:36] can appear in different forms
[9:38] and most always when he visits his
[9:40] people
[9:41] he does not come in the way people are
[9:44] expecting him to come
[9:46] people are actually surprised most
[9:48] people miss it when he's there and
[9:50] visits
[9:51] they said he was here he was here
[9:53] because they're looking for a certain
[9:54] way
[9:55] for him to come but he has a way god and
[9:57] morphy
[9:58] god can change his form and he can
[10:01] appear
[10:01] in a way that the people didn't expect
[10:04] he can come and flesh even that day with
[10:07] abraham
[10:08] it was a revelation that god showed him
[10:10] that this man sitting down
[10:12] having a meal with him and these two
[10:14] angels were flesh and blood
[10:17] they had features like a human being
[10:20] they had they they had a countenance can
[10:21] you say man
[10:22] so i don't know what distinction abraham
[10:25] had to call one of them lord
[10:27] but it must have been a revelation but
[10:29] he was sitting there
[10:30] in flesh people look for christ and he's
[10:34] on a cloud and he's
[10:35] he's this and he's in a glorified
[10:36] condition that's not the way he
[10:38] sat there and ate meat and had a meal
[10:41] with abraham
[10:42] and it was jesus christ the son of man
[10:46] in a different form so this
[10:50] the visitations from god can be
[10:53] in a different form and that's why
[10:54] people miss him and i'll say this
[10:57] you will miss him if you put him in a
[10:59] certain box
[11:00] if you put him in a certain way he has
[11:02] to come this way
[11:03] you might miss him can you say amen but
[11:06] don't miss his visitation
[11:09] these men were in flesh eating with him
[11:11] and he had features to their face and
[11:13] all these
[11:14] other things and it looked like men but
[11:16] it was a visitation from god
[11:18] now abraham had many visits from god
[11:21] throughout his spiritual journey
[11:22] but these final ones were the last
[11:25] visits
[11:26] and now typing the church now i'm and
[11:28] many of these things are
[11:30] foundational things for the message many
[11:32] of you know some of these things
[11:34] but just so happens i may say some
[11:36] things this morning and i'll tell you
[11:37] where i'm going a little bit
[11:39] because not only was god visiting
[11:41] abraham in the son of man
[11:43] and this matter and the way he's doing
[11:44] with us now
[11:46] but he also says i'm going to visit
[11:49] sodom
[11:51] and i don't know if you read the last
[11:53] two or three days
[11:54] the i'm already calling it what brother
[11:58] ram called it
[11:59] but the increased sightings of lights
[12:03] around the pentagon
[12:06] and it just got my attention matter of
[12:08] fact i read the article i'm going to
[12:10] read some of it this morning
[12:11] i read it and i thought you know i went
[12:13] to the scripture and i was going to go
[12:14] on with my series
[12:16] on david and saul but god just directed
[12:18] me here to
[12:19] take a little time and talk about this
[12:20] current event that's taken place
[12:22] because they don't have a clue there's
[12:24] an increased number of sightings
[12:26] we've always called them ufos and all
[12:28] the other things but we know by the
[12:29] message what they are
[12:32] and then i go to the scripture realize
[12:34] that he just sends his two angels
[12:35] and he sends investigating angels to go
[12:38] down and look at sodom
[12:40] so it's not only the us that's receiving
[12:42] a visit from elohim
[12:43] but god is sending messengers and he
[12:46] right now is investigating
[12:48] this condition in sodom
[12:52] that's another visitation but i'm not
[12:54] interested in that visitation
[12:55] i'm not going to tell you a whole theory
[12:57] about ufos this morning
[12:59] i'm interested in one visitation and
[13:01] that's with this son of man
[13:02] i want to meet with him can you say amen
[13:04] i want to commune with him
[13:06] and i want to invite him and make him
[13:08] feel welcome
[13:09] when he comes my way i don't want to
[13:11] push him off but i want to say lord i'll
[13:13] take this time and i'm going to stand as
[13:15] the bible said
[13:16] those two angels went down to sodom but
[13:19] abraham
[13:20] stood before the lord
[13:23] how many would raise your hand this way
[13:25] and say that's my position
[13:27] right now when there's chaos around this
[13:29] world
[13:30] when covenant is spiking again here's my
[13:33] position
[13:33] i'm just standing before the lord i'm
[13:36] right here looking right in his face i'm
[13:39] not moving from this place
[13:41] let them go look at sodom all they want
[13:43] to abraham stood before the lord
[13:47] and he kept him there as long as he
[13:49] could
[13:51] somebody say praise the lord amen i'll
[13:54] never get to all this without unless i
[13:56] stay with it
[13:56] but you see now then he visits abraham
[13:59] sarah he reaffirms his promise that was
[14:02] at the beginning of his journey
[14:04] and you see then he says i'll visit her
[14:07] according to the time of life and the
[14:09] next year i'm going to give you a visit
[14:12] that you have been looking for for years
[14:14] and so he had been through many things
[14:15] and
[14:16] hagar and all and all these other things
[14:19] but now
[14:19] what he's saying is in this revisit he's
[14:22] saying it's close now
[14:23] my visit the final visit is closed now
[14:26] sarah and she laughed in her heart
[14:31] but he come to revisit to say my
[14:34] final visit is close
[14:37] i'll visit you for the final visit
[14:40] according to the time of life
[14:42] and scholars say that's in another year
[14:44] i'm going to visit you
[14:46] and this promise that you heard at the
[14:47] beginning of your journey
[14:49] i'm going to visit you and this promise
[14:52] is going to trigger
[14:54] so sarah laughed inside because she has
[14:58] not come to how real
[15:01] this is abraham had
[15:05] but sarah being a type of the bride had
[15:07] not come to how
[15:08] real this is and let me just say this i
[15:10] don't think sarah had come
[15:12] to how important this visit was
[15:15] does that sound like some message people
[15:17] to you does that sound like the people
[15:19] who've grown up in the message
[15:21] and they know the quotes and everything
[15:22] so they're sitting in church and just
[15:23] all these quotes oh yes yes i know where
[15:25] he's going i know where he's going and
[15:26] listen it becomes common to us
[15:28] sarah even when she heard the original
[15:30] promise laughed within herself there's a
[15:32] little sarcasm within her
[15:34] i've heard this our whole marriage i've
[15:36] heard this every says abraham said god
[15:38] talked to him said
[15:39] i'm going to have a child she had a
[15:40] little sarcasm
[15:42] not verbally she didn't she respected
[15:44] enough she didn't say it her
[15:45] in her mouth but inside she had a little
[15:48] sarcasm
[15:51] maybe maybe 30 years ago but not now
[15:53] look at me look at
[15:54] look how old i am she had a lack of
[15:57] belief
[15:58] in the promise
[16:02] but yet she's the predestinated one
[16:04] she's a type of the bride
[16:06] that son was not gonna come through any
[16:08] other woman
[16:09] except sarah and let me tell you this
[16:11] morning you can run
[16:12] you can hide you can doubt but god's
[16:15] gonna bring you around
[16:16] to believing this promise like the song
[16:19] said
[16:20] i believe what you said
[16:23] because sarah was going to have it
[16:24] nobody else is going to have it you're
[16:26] predestinated to receive this word
[16:28] and to have a body you're predestinated
[16:30] to have a body change
[16:31] and bring forth the promised son
[16:34] somebody say praise the lord
[16:36] hallelujah she was the one that was
[16:39] going to have it
[16:39] but she or she's doubting and she's
[16:42] she's got a little
[16:43] i tell you friends am i speaking to
[16:45] anybody if you were to be honest you
[16:47] won't say it to me but you need to tell
[16:49] the lord
[16:50] god that's where i'm at this morning i'm
[16:52] like sarah i haven't verbally said
[16:54] nothing disrespectful
[16:56] but in my heart i need you to cause me
[16:59] help me to believe again
[17:02] to believe this message is true
[17:06] i've got this little laugh within me
[17:10] when preachers preach certain things i
[17:13] got this little sarcasm within me
[17:15] may god burn it out of us may god love
[17:18] us out of it
[17:19] before it's too late can you say amen
[17:21] may god
[17:22] take you that have been hurt and you've
[17:24] got to doubt within your heart
[17:26] may you say like the man to jesus lord i
[17:28] believe
[17:29] but help thou my unbelief
[17:32] that's sarah isn't it if you ask her
[17:34] verbally say i believe abraham i believe
[17:36] my husband
[17:37] verbally but she she said lord i believe
[17:41] help thou what's laying down here
[17:45] it's just sarcasm she laughed a little
[17:47] and guess what
[17:49] brother brown says god could have just
[17:52] god could have just said okay that's it
[17:54] your disrespect
[17:56] it's over mcgregor said god couldn't do
[17:58] it because she was part of abraham
[18:01] the bride is bone of his bone
[18:04] flesh of his best you are part of christ
[18:07] he can't
[18:08] disown you you're bone of his bone flesh
[18:12] of his flesh
[18:13] he can't disown you and because
[18:16] sarah was a part of abraham even though
[18:20] she had this sarcastic laugh within
[18:21] herself
[18:22] god come back and says why did you laugh
[18:25] and here's another sign of the son of
[18:26] man
[18:27] that all you should be familiar with if
[18:29] you're not when that son of man revealed
[18:31] himself he revealed the secrets of the
[18:32] heart
[18:33] she was in the tent and she said i
[18:35] didn't laugh in my heart
[18:37] and he said you did laugh and she knew
[18:39] it was true
[18:40] because the son of man knows the secrets
[18:43] of the hearts
[18:44] and for many years the prophet traveled
[18:47] around so now i'm saying if you listen
[18:49] to the
[18:50] to the recordings you're going to see
[18:52] incident after incident
[18:53] not some television preacher that's
[18:55] saying somebody out there has heart
[18:57] trouble
[18:58] i see somebody has this no you're going
[19:00] to see an accuracy
[19:02] because it's not a man it's the son of
[19:04] man discerning
[19:06] the thoughts and intents of the heart i
[19:09] didn't laugh oh yes you did
[19:11] and she couldn't deny it look at god's
[19:13] grace
[19:15] look at god's grace could have wiped her
[19:17] off the face of the earth
[19:19] but she was part of abraham and he said
[19:21] sarah you laugh
[19:22] but i'm going to reaffirm i'm going to
[19:24] say it to you again i
[19:26] will visit you according to the time of
[19:29] life
[19:31] praise the lord how how low do we get
[19:34] sometimes
[19:36] and how much grace does he have to come
[19:38] back and telling you
[19:39] i don't know what you've done just
[19:41] repent i'll forgive you
[19:43] i'm going to visit you according to my
[19:45] life i have a body change for you
[19:48] i have a rapture for you you will bring
[19:51] forth the promised son
[19:54] can somebody say shout praise the lord
[19:56] this morning how many times does god
[19:58] come
[19:59] in all your ignorance and your sarcasm
[20:01] in your heart and whatever is going on
[20:03] your heart
[20:03] and god still comes back and preaches
[20:05] sermons like last sunday
[20:07] to tell you you're my elect you're my
[20:09] people
[20:10] you're my bride can you say a man and
[20:13] you'll come hard
[20:14] or you'll come easy but you're coming
[20:16] can you say amen
[20:17] and i will visit you according to the
[20:20] time of life
[20:21] somebody please get me a hook to put my
[20:23] coat on
[20:25] i will visit you despite your disbelief
[20:29] i will visit you
[20:30] what a visit that's going to be can you
[20:32] say amen so by the secrets of the heart
[20:34] we'll pass
[20:35] some more of that up because we see that
[20:36] that's part of the son of man ministry
[20:39] that's part of this ministry and for
[20:41] people who say that's over
[20:43] it's over in the sense of a prophet gift
[20:45] but the bible says that the word is a
[20:48] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[20:50] the heart
[20:51] so now it's still going on especially
[20:53] like last sunday so many things happen
[20:55] in the meetings last weekend
[20:57] that were secrets of people's hearts
[20:58] revealed through the word being preached
[21:01] can you say amen
[21:02] and people say that here in certain
[21:03] services if you'll yield to the lord
[21:05] and if you'll pray i don't even have to
[21:07] talk to you god can show me in the word
[21:09] and speak some problem in your life or
[21:11] some habit in your life some victory
[21:14] that you need in your life
[21:15] you cannot talk to me all week and god
[21:17] can reveal the secret of your heartbeat
[21:19] how many has had that happen just so the
[21:21] young people and everybody knows
[21:22] raise your hand anybody who's ever had
[21:24] my if you've been a believer even for
[21:26] six months
[21:27] you know that's real had to be god can
[21:31] you say amen
[21:32] praise be to god so notice now the
[21:35] change in verse 20. i got to move along
[21:37] another visit to investigate sodom and
[21:41] gomorrah
[21:42] and so just the word about this visit
[21:44] now i just want to talk about the word
[21:46] visit if you give me a minute
[21:48] the word visit now in the in the he
[21:51] in the greek in the new testament the
[21:54] greek meaning of visit
[21:56] usually just means spending time with
[21:59] someone a visit is just spending time
[22:01] and a lot of times when we think of a
[22:02] visit you just stop by someone's house
[22:04] you're going to visit
[22:05] and it's just to spend time with someone
[22:08] but in the
[22:08] in the old testament in the hebrew word
[22:10] visit if you
[22:12] study the word the word visit is not
[22:15] just to stop by
[22:16] and just see somebody and have a little
[22:18] chat and a coffee
[22:19] and get going that's not there's a
[22:21] deeper
[22:22] meaning when god visits
[22:27] when he comes he's not coming
[22:31] just to have a little chat
[22:35] he's not coming and stopping by just to
[22:37] have a little time with you
[22:40] but there's a deeper purpose
[22:44] there's a deeper meaning to this visit a
[22:46] visit has a strong
[22:48] meaning to god that when he visits
[22:51] there's going to be
[22:52] something take place when jesus is in
[22:55] the room can you say man
[22:57] things take place because he's not just
[23:02] stopping by for a casual visit but you
[23:04] see if we don't invite him in like
[23:06] abraham did
[23:07] it'll become just a casual visit but god
[23:09] doesn't want it to be a casual visit but
[23:11] see we just say okay another sunday
[23:13] put my tithes in the box here we are
[23:16] another sunday
[23:16] and we can let a visit of god we can
[23:18] miss it can you say amen
[23:20] but the word visit in the
[23:24] old testament it's deeper than the new
[23:26] testament
[23:27] and it's used in two sides the one
[23:30] meaning
[23:30] of a visit is actually punishment and
[23:34] uh his visit means punishment
[23:37] how many remembers the scripture this
[23:39] god says i will visit
[23:41] the iniquity of the fathers on the
[23:44] children how many remember that old
[23:46] testament
[23:47] so that visit has a punishment to it
[23:49] that visit has a judgment to it
[23:51] i will visit he's not just coming to say
[23:53] hello he's coming to visit the
[23:55] iniquities of the fathers on the
[23:57] children
[23:57] so we find that side of the meaning in
[24:00] the old testament
[24:01] but but we find uh then the other
[24:05] side of the meaning and incidentally
[24:07] there's only 10
[24:09] of the words visit in the old testament
[24:11] the hebrew word there's only 10
[24:13] that means judgment there's only 10 that
[24:15] means punishment when it says visit
[24:18] the other 90 means
[24:21] he comes for a blessing he comes for an
[24:24] appointing to appoint something
[24:26] he comes to lay upon a certain charge to
[24:30] somebody
[24:30] this isn't just a casual stopping by
[24:33] saying hello
[24:34] he wants to give a charge and the last
[24:36] meaning that i love
[24:37] is he comes to deposit something
[24:45] it's not just stopping by saying hello
[24:48] he wants to appoint you he wants to
[24:50] deposit
[24:51] something amen i'll tell you when the
[24:53] son of man visits a generation like he
[24:55] has now
[24:56] he isn't coming just to say just to do
[24:58] miracles and impress you
[25:01] he isn't coming just to do the the first
[25:03] and second pull
[25:04] right he's coming to deposit something
[25:08] the holy ghost to the seat in the elect
[25:12] when he comes into service this morning
[25:15] i want you teenagers to listen to me
[25:17] when he comes it's not paul lafontaine
[25:20] it's not just some casual visit to
[25:22] church and you see this and then
[25:24] and gideon leads songs you've got to
[25:26] look at this different
[25:27] because when our lord comes the way that
[25:29] he's come this morning
[25:30] he wants to deposit something in your
[25:33] soul
[25:35] he wants to appoint you to something he
[25:36] wants to call your heart
[25:40] it's not just a casual car hey glad you
[25:43] showed up
[25:44] see you next week and sunday that's how
[25:47] some people are
[25:48] they walk out those doors never crack
[25:50] their bible
[25:51] never crack the message if you can crack
[25:53] the message never look at anything else
[25:58] lord really enjoyed that this morning
[26:01] you felt your presence there
[26:03] see you next sunday let me say something
[26:06] to you
[26:07] there might not be another sunday
[26:10] what guarantee you have that this is
[26:12] you're going to be able to come back
[26:13] next sunday
[26:14] might be over it might be the last visit
[26:17] of the bride
[26:17] on monday morning from six to nine
[26:21] and there'll be no service you'll come
[26:23] here and looking for cars and there
[26:24] ain't nobody here
[26:26] because why the final visit took place
[26:28] and you missed it
[26:32] you think about it so we don't we don't
[26:33] say lord i'll see you next week
[26:35] lord i really enjoyed it it was nice to
[26:37] talk to you you really talked to me in
[26:39] the service day really blessing

[26:42] you know what i'm looking for the same
[26:43] thing as god

[26:47] right it might be the last sunday
[26:51] i was praying yesterday morning at five
[26:53] in the morning

[27:05] i was in this building last night
[27:06] praying for these everybody who sits in
[27:08] these
[27:09] just praying god put me in that
[27:10] atmosphere to call upon the
[27:12] things of god for the people's sake
[27:16] been burdened about some situations and
[27:19] and then i had a wonderful discussion
[27:21] last night with
[27:23] one of my family members with such a
[27:25] relief i was waking up and so i couldn't
[27:27] think of anything else i was praying but
[27:28] i said lord could this be the morning
[27:31] for the rapture please
[27:35] even so come quickly
[27:38] i don't need to go to church tomorrow i
[27:41] can go to the ultimate youth camp in the

[28:34] because i want to be with my lord
[28:37] and i'm tired of this sodom condition
[28:39] people are going absolutely insane
[28:42] and the prophet said that they would
[28:44] they're not the mental faculties of many
[28:47] people
[28:47] most people are going they're going lulu
[28:50] they're going crazy
[28:52] can't think properly a woman yesterday
[28:54] in an accident
[28:55] you're standing outside the car just as
[28:57] just a temper just
[28:59] crying yelling cussing just you know
[29:02] it's just a little fender bender
[29:03] but she's she's like about ready to have
[29:06] a war there
[29:07] over a fender bender somebody hit her my
[29:10] wife said brother ben said
[29:12] they go totally insane they're not going
[29:14] to settle down everything
[29:15] triggers them so i'm ready to go how
[29:18] about you
[29:21] when god comes and visits it's not just
[29:24] a casual event he comes to deposit
[29:26] something he comes to put something
[29:27] within you and you have to believe and
[29:30] receive that what he said
[29:31] i believe it let me receive it but a
[29:34] visit from god
[29:35] and when he said i'm visiting you now
[29:37] and i'm going to visit you sarah
[29:39] according to the time of life
[29:40] sarah should not have been laughing
[29:42] sarah should have been saying
[29:43] thank you lord when is it going to be
[29:45] isn't it a year
[29:46] i can't wait glory i can't wait
[29:50] to that visit that's the final visit
[29:53] brother bob
[29:54] that's the final visit that i'm looking
[29:56] forward to sarah should have been
[29:57] praising the lord
[29:58] and i pray your faith can rise in the
[30:00] next months or weeks or today whatever
[30:03] it is
[30:03] that you get rid of your doubt that you
[30:06] get rid of your hurt
[30:08] and pain that you get rid of your
[30:10] sarcasm
[30:11] and say just purely say i believe
[30:13] there's a final visit for this bride
[30:16] and i am a part of it and i can't wait
[30:18] till it happens
[30:20] somebody say praise the lord
[30:23] that's what sarah should have been
[30:24] saying lord thank you
[30:27] and i can't wait to that final visit in
[30:28] a year from now
[30:30] praise the lord god doesn't visit us
[30:32] just to spend time with us he has
[30:34] something he wants to deposit
[30:35] he's something he wants to fulfill his
[30:37] promise something he wants to trigger
[30:39] that life within you
[30:40] let's not ever minimize coming to the
[30:43] house of god
[30:45] let's make it a priority to come to the
[30:47] house of god
[30:48] can you say man we're living in trouble
[30:51] sometimes and some
[30:52] things we have to navigate through
[30:54] because of the covet
[30:55] but don't you dare let the covet or
[30:57] anything
[30:59] deteriorate what a priority is sometimes
[31:02] we have to miss because of it
[31:03] but don't let it read into that this is
[31:06] not important
[31:07] once you're healthy this is important to
[31:09] come
[31:10] never minimize coming to church this is
[31:12] not just a
[31:13] casual social gathering to see your
[31:16] friends
[31:17] god is present and god wants to deposit
[31:20] his word in our hearts
[31:24] we should make our visits with him count
[31:27] that's what abraham's doing he's making
[31:28] this visit count
[31:31] he's inviting him in not like the
[31:33] pharisee who brother ronald spencer said
[31:36] the pharisee invited him but it was for
[31:38] ulterior motives
[31:41] some people invite christ and run up to
[31:44] christ
[31:46] and they have all different agendas why
[31:48] they want god's blessing
[31:51] but they don't want to give a commitment
[31:52] to him
[31:54] amen
[31:58] they might want to they enjoy being the
[31:59] presence of god because it just
[32:01] makes them feel better this gives them a
[32:04] good feeling
[32:05] but there's no commitment there's no
[32:07] heart
[32:09] hearts are all locked up so in this
[32:14] visit with
[32:15] abraham and sarah there's two things i
[32:18] will visit you sarah
[32:20] and i will visit sodom i'm going to
[32:23] visit sarah
[32:25] i'm visiting you now
[32:28] and then he he says i'm going to visit
[32:30] sarah
[32:32] according to the time life and i'm going
[32:34] to visit sodom and gomorrah
[32:36] which is truly happening and there was a
[32:39] moment
[32:41] in that conversation that he dismissed
[32:43] the other two men
[32:44] two angels as we know them the other two
[32:46] men and those other two men
[32:49] started to walk towards sodom he
[32:52] dismissed them and they were starting
[32:55] going to investigate sodom and gomorrah
[32:59] but the bible says abraham stood before
[33:02] the lord that's good
[33:03] that's a good thing to look at during
[33:05] these times
[33:06] to fix your gaze upon the
[33:10] countenance of the lord
[33:15] that's abraham's position
[33:18] if you're dabbling
[33:21] in the ways of sodom or the spirits of
[33:25] lust in sodom
[33:27] so i'm not doing that you're not what
[33:29] are you looking at at your phone
[33:33] say well i'm not a homosexual the spirit
[33:36] of sodom
[33:37] is a filthy sexual spirit
[33:40] whether it's homosexual or not it's
[33:43] perverted
[33:45] sexual spirit with women's flesh
[33:48] everywhere
[33:48] with men everywhere with with dirty
[33:51] jokes everywhere with dirty movies
[33:53] everywhere
[33:53] i'm talking to you now
[33:57] it's real and i can't make that choice
[34:00] for you you have to make that choice to
[34:02] realize
[34:03] do i want to be investigated do i want
[34:06] investigating angels coming and looking
[34:08] at my health
[34:08] i want to tell you you can't hide it
[34:13] is that the position you ought to be is
[34:15] living in sodom remember saud
[34:17] lot did not move right to sodom his
[34:20] first move was to pitch his tent
[34:22] towards sodom there are a lot of
[34:24] families that are not homosexuals and
[34:26] not living there
[34:27] some have got so far away from god they
[34:30] have turned to lesbianism because
[34:32] if you keep going with that spirit of
[34:33] filth it'll take it it's only going in
[34:36] one direction
[34:37] but a lot of families are not in sodom
[34:39] they've just
[34:40] pitched their tent towards it
[34:44] that's what lot did he didn't even know
[34:46] he ended up down there but he ended up
[34:47] the mayor of the city
[34:49] i don't know how many years it took but
[34:51] he didn't just move and say we're moving
[34:52] to sodom he didn't say that he was too
[34:54] religious for that he just his wife
[34:58] influenced them
[34:59] she's seen some of the carts come by
[35:01] through the years of the new makeup
[35:03] and all the new clothes and what they
[35:05] were wearing in sodom and they were
[35:06] selling stuff
[35:07] and lot's wife got attracted to the
[35:09] fashions
[35:10] she wanted to be in sodom and she kept
[35:14] influencing lot
[35:16] oh i pray so i hope you're listening
[35:20] sometimes our wives can be used of god
[35:22] to speak to us and sometimes
[35:24] they're influenced by other things
[35:26] sometimes you men can be influenced by
[35:28] other things
[35:29] and it affects your choices he listened
[35:31] to his wife said
[35:32] let's pitch our tent towards sodom i
[35:34] want to be there and she finally got him
[35:37] down there he was the head and she was
[35:40] the neck that was turning the head a
[35:44] jezebel
[35:45] she had that in her heart and she wanted
[35:47] it and they ended up down there he was
[35:48] the mayor of the city
[35:49] and he is still righteous because the
[35:50] bible says it vexed his righteous soul
[35:52] daily
[35:53] we have a lot of godly people living
[35:55] close to sodom and it's vexing the
[35:57] righteous soul
[35:58] but i'm talking about you this morning
[36:01] do you want to be
[36:02] dabbling in the things of sodom and
[36:06] that's where you position yourself
[36:08] or do you want to be where abraham was
[36:11] fixed
[36:12] standing before the lord and as long as
[36:15] he stood there abraham stood the bible
[36:17] said this
[36:17] he stood before the lord
[36:22] i want to be right there you this
[36:25] morning that are dabbling in the things
[36:26] of sodom
[36:28] i believe the lord's calling you to get
[36:30] in the presence of the lord
[36:32] and stand and look into the gaze of
[36:35] jesus christ
[36:37] and be transformed and changed by just
[36:40] looking
[36:41] at him can you say amen
[36:44] if you're dabbling in the fellowship
[36:46] with sodomites
[36:48] and you're around that type of spirit
[36:49] all the time
[36:51] you need a visit from god that will
[36:54] cause you to stand before him
[36:57] i want you to watch something as we take
[36:58] a look a couple scriptures first and
[37:00] then i want to
[37:01] read an article to you let's focus our
[37:03] attention now on these
[37:04] this investigation to sodom everybody's
[37:06] still with me
[37:08] let's look at the investigation to sodom
[37:10] now right here in the bible but turn
[37:11] with me if you
[37:12] would to luke 21 because i want you to
[37:14] see the scriptures first
[37:16] luke 21 and verse
[37:19] 8 through 11. says here
[37:22] jesus prophesying and he said take heed
[37:26] that ye be not deceived for many shall
[37:29] come in my name saying
[37:30] i am christ and the time draws near
[37:34] go ye not therefore after them but when
[37:37] ye shall hear of wars and commotions
[37:40] be not terrified for these things must
[37:42] first come to pass
[37:43] but the end is not by and by then said
[37:46] he unto them
[37:47] nations shall rise against nation and
[37:50] kingdom against
[37:51] kingdom and great earthquakes shall be
[37:53] in
[37:54] many places diverse places and famines
[37:58] and pestilences i'll stop right there
[38:01] pestilence is a a tragic or
[38:04] uh i'm looking for the word a pandemic
[38:06] that is fatal a fatal pandemic
[38:11] jesus said there'd be pestilences and he
[38:13] didn't say one
[38:16] he said there'd be many that's right
[38:18] we're not done
[38:20] oh i know all of us want to be done
[38:24] but we're not done the new strains
[38:28] the new ones that would come out jesus
[38:30] said
[38:31] there will be fatal pandemics fatal
[38:35] almost 600 000 people in our nation
[38:38] that's pretty bad that's a lot of lies
[38:43] pestilences and then he says fearful
[38:46] sights and great signs shall there be
[38:48] in the heaven hold that thought fearful
[38:51] sights
[38:51] in the heaven in other words it's making
[38:53] everybody fearful because they don't
[38:55] know what it is
[38:56] fearful sight shall be in the heaven and
[38:58] when the prophet refers to this about 40
[39:00] times
[39:01] since 1954 all the way through the
[39:03] prophet refers to these things
[39:06] these lights appearing we call them ufos
[39:09] or we call them
[39:10] spaceships or whatever no one knows what
[39:12] these ufos are they still haven't known
[39:14] and actually the pentagon continues to
[39:17] for for
[39:17] 40 50 60 years have hid all their
[39:21] reports
[39:21] and hid everything because they they
[39:23] have no explanation for it
[39:25] and they're coming up i'm going to read
[39:27] you in june they're going to finally
[39:29] issue an
[39:30] article in june from the pentagon that
[39:33] finally after this many years they're
[39:35] going to admit
[39:36] these things are real they would never
[39:39] admit that
[39:40] they don't know what they are but
[39:42] they're admitting this is a reality
[39:45] and we don't know what it is
[39:49] that sounds real familiar with our
[39:50] government and our science
[39:54] they don't even know what coven really
[39:56] is i know some people don't like that
[39:58] but i'm here to tell you there's no
[40:00] absolute to anybody knowing
[40:02] what this thing is or what it's doing we
[40:05] know what it's done
[40:06] but don't put your trust in men who
[40:09] think they've got it figured out
[40:12] this is a stealth enemy can you say amen
[40:15] this is an invisible army that has come
[40:18] and it's demons to me can you say man
[40:23] so just like these ufos just like all of
[40:25] science don't you dare put your trust
[40:27] and make
[40:27] there is no absolute to this thing
[40:32] i have to be careful boy i make some
[40:33] people upset
[40:35] investigating angels investigating judge
[40:37] this is what brother branham called
[40:39] these things now
[40:40] i don't want to have a whole service on
[40:42] ufos or you're going to think that i'm
[40:43] going wacko
[40:45] i'm just saying what the prophet said
[40:47] that there will be lights and
[40:48] investigating angels
[40:50] just before judgment come on the scene
[40:52] and he
[40:53] pointed for since 1954 is he said you
[40:56] see those lights around the pentagon
[40:58] incidentally they're always showing up
[41:00] around the pentagon and around the
[41:02] uh around our our army facilities
[41:06] around the uh the um oh the uh
[41:10] i can't think of it right now just uh
[41:12] give me about
[41:14] a couple days and i'll think of it
[41:19] dave especially what is that a nuclear
[41:21] plant they have sightings around the
[41:22] nuclear places around nuclear things
[41:25] sites around our army ships
[41:28] these are a lot of science and i can't
[41:30] really explain that myself i just know
[41:31] that he called him
[41:32] investigating angels and then here hold
[41:35] hold in fearful sights
[41:37] this is the scripture brother ben
[41:38] pointed to fearful sights
[41:40] and signs shall be in the heaven
[41:44] now turn with me to revelations eight
[41:46] under the sixth seal
[41:48] in revelations eight how many wants to
[41:50] learn something here
[41:52] then the prophet points to the sixth
[41:54] seal in revelations chapter
[41:56] eight and while he excuse me while he's
[41:59] preaching the sixth seal
[42:00] he refers to revelations 8 and he says
[42:04] here verse 12
[42:05] revelation 8 verse 12 and the fourth
[42:07] angel sounded and the
[42:09] third part of the sun was smitten in the
[42:10] third part of the moon third part of the
[42:12] star so as the third part of them was
[42:13] darkened
[42:14] and the day shone not for a third part
[42:15] of it and the night likewise verse 13 is
[42:17] what i want to get to
[42:18] and i beheld and heard an angel flying
[42:22] through the midst of heaven now this is
[42:24] the scripture brother of adam refers to
[42:26] in the sixth seal
[42:28] there's an angel flying through the
[42:29] midst of heaven saying with a loud voice
[42:32] whoa whoa whoa that's where we get the
[42:34] three woes
[42:35] okay to the inhabitants of the earth
[42:39] by reason of the other voices of the
[42:41] trumpet of the three angels
[42:43] which are yet to sound so here we're at
[42:46] the
[42:46] end of the fourth trumpet and this angel
[42:49] flying
[42:50] is saying and and to me he's observing
[42:54] who the inhabitants of the earth
[42:59] they're looking at all the inhabitants
[43:00] the people the sinful condition can you
[43:03] say about it
[43:05] and screams whoa whoa whoa and that
[43:08] means there's three more trumpets to
[43:09] come now
[43:10] i don't have time to read the last verse
[43:12] chapter nine the last three trumpets but
[43:14] when you read the last three trumpets
[43:16] you're gonna find
[43:17] such uh tribulation diseases
[43:20] and all these things coming and that's
[43:22] where you get the
[43:23] shapes of locusts uh and just
[43:27] um just terrible hideous and hair as the
[43:30] hair of a woman and their teeth as teeth
[43:32] of lions
[43:32] all these hideous things during
[43:34] tribulation start to come out
[43:36] it's all in the last three trumpets
[43:37] there and that's why
[43:39] he's predicting this angel's predicting
[43:41] saying whoa whoa whoa
[43:44] three woes three more trumpets these
[43:47] will be worse
[43:48] judgment is coming
[43:52] if he to come to the inhabitants of the
[43:54] earth flying around
[43:55] and observed the inhabitants of the
[43:57] earth and didn't see it has been
[43:59] reported to sin
[44:00] then he would have backed off but when
[44:02] he seen it all
[44:03] investigated all of it he says this is
[44:06] over whoa
[44:08] whoa whoa to you inhabitants judgment is
[44:11] just around the corner
[44:16] and it's god visiting
[44:20] investigating before judgment
[44:24] i tell you i sometimes i see a little
[44:25] bit of the mercy of god in that
[44:27] because you think well god knows
[44:29] everything and he knows all things but
[44:30] he actually going to visit
[44:32] with his angels and investigate just to
[44:34] make sure
[44:35] it's it's got as bad as it's really
[44:37] gotten
[44:39] because maybe if it's not as bad maybe
[44:42] there's hope for this nation
[44:43] maybe there's hope for this world and he
[44:46] investigates and says
[44:47] there's no hope for this earth
[44:51] whoa whoa whoa i know you think of woe
[44:55] is a different thing
[44:56] but it has a much deeper meaning just
[44:58] like visit does
[45:00] woe has a much deeper meaning and i got
[45:02] it written up here i'll come back
[45:04] up here and read it to you if you study
[45:06] the word woe
[45:07] and the three woes there's two sides of
[45:10] that word as well
[45:11] one is when jesus says same same greek
[45:13] word alas
[45:14] alas babylon or capernaum
[45:19] and he uses the term alas alas that's
[45:21] like woe but it's what it is as god said
[45:23] alas
[45:24] capernaum how i would have hovered you
[45:26] how i would have taken you
[45:28] and saved you but you're under judgments
[45:30] alas alas and it means that god
[45:32] is sorrowful last last means it's a
[45:35] sorrowful grief from god
[45:38] but there's another woe that's in the
[45:39] book of revelations that's not alas alas
[45:42] but it actually uses the word woe but
[45:45] its greek meaning
[45:46] is extreme severe afflictions
[45:50] that are coming and a denunciation
[45:53] of god completely
[45:56] when that angel investigates when these
[45:59] angels investigate
[46:00] and they come to this conclusion which i
[46:02] believe they already have
[46:05] it's not just whoa this is a bad
[46:07] situation
[46:08] that's what we say whoa this is no these
[46:11] wolves mean
[46:12] god is denouncing the whole thing
[46:16] i think brother rap said it a few weeks
[46:18] ago or some minister
[46:20] god's spirit it's proven right now god's
[46:23] spirit
[46:24] is lifting from the earth and when god's
[46:27] spirit is lifting from the earth
[46:30] hell is surfacing
[46:33] because there's no holy ghost to hold it
[46:36] back
[46:38] so hell is spilling over
[46:41] and it's becoming so bad till those
[46:42] angels said god will denounce the whole
[46:45] thing
[46:46] and there's nothing but just
[46:49] affliction and torture and
[46:52] judgment that's just around the corner
[46:58] sobering i pray that it is
[47:04] because i don't know the day or the hour
[47:06] i just know
[47:07] the conditions and the spirits that i
[47:09] feel every day
[47:11] i know that we're very close
[47:16] there's no hope for this nation you
[47:18] won't hear too many preachers saying
[47:20] that either
[47:20] there's no hope for this world she's set
[47:23] for a third
[47:24] a third birth pain first world war first
[47:27] birth pain
[47:28] second world war second birth pain read
[47:30] it in the message birth pains
[47:32] but she won't survive a third birth pain
[47:36] she'll give birth to a new world and a
[47:38] millennium
[47:39] this earth is going to be purged by the
[47:41] holy fires of god
[47:44] woe has a strong meaning to the
[47:46] inhabitants of the earth why they're
[47:48] watching they're visiting if you guys
[47:49] would pull those quotes up
[47:50] they are visiting to see the condition
[47:52] of sin since the revealing of the son of
[47:54] man
[47:55] the first and second poll these
[47:57] sightings have taken place
[47:58] and i i looked this up you can bring
[48:00] that quote up brother branham
[48:02] i looked this i was saying when was the
[48:03] first sightings well they've had a lot
[48:05] of them written
[48:06] down through the years but the official
[48:08] sightings
[48:09] that were recorded and put down for our
[48:11] nation was in seattle i believe
[48:13] and it was the year 1947.
[48:19] so just between you and i that's when
[48:23] the son of man ministry or the ministry
[48:26] began in its initial stages
[48:29] of a visitation from god son of man
[48:34] now reports reports the pentagon puts
[48:36] under it and brother ram says it this
[48:38] way in
[48:39] the quotes if you guys have it we're in
[48:42] a dangerous time
[48:44] remember the scripture says when these
[48:47] things begin to happen
[48:48] time is no more she's fading away when
[48:51] we see the manifestation
[48:53] earthquakes you see them a thousand
[48:55] killed the other day earthquakes in
[48:56] divers places
[48:58] said fearful sights in the skies pillars
[49:00] of fire like
[49:01] floating around like flying saucers they
[49:04] don't know what it is
[49:05] see they don't have any idea did you
[49:08] notice the angels that come down
[49:10] investigated sodom before sodom was
[49:12] destroyed
[49:13] you remember that congregation says amen
[49:15] there was a bunch of them down
[49:18] come down three of them one of them
[49:20] stayed with abraham
[49:21] you remember that yeah amen they were
[49:23] lights from heaven that came down in
[49:26] the investigating judgment look where
[49:29] they're all found around the pentagon
[49:31] and things they find them that's the
[49:32] world judgment
[49:33] sodom and there is one represented will
[49:36] be represented among the churches
[49:38] will be christ himself vindicating
[49:41] himself
[49:43] you glad you're around that group aren't
[49:45] you a grand you're around christ
[49:48] son of man revealing himself sights in
[49:51] the heavens above
[49:52] and signs on the earth below certainly
[49:56] and then in the next one i wanted you to
[49:57] see this in the sixth seal and a crisis
[49:59] so close
[50:00] like real christianity to the bride said
[50:03] it will fool everyone that wasn't
[50:04] predestinated that's right the bible
[50:06] said that he's given end time things now
[50:07] the spirit would be so close it deceived
[50:10] the very elect apostle
[50:11] all everything jesus said here about the
[50:13] end time the bible said that in the last
[50:15] days
[50:15] everything that wasn't predestinated the
[50:17] elect it says the elect
[50:19] now no anybody take that word and run it
[50:21] back in your margin you see what it
[50:22] means it says the elected
[50:23] predestinated see it'll fool every one
[50:26] of them whose names were not
[50:27] on the lamb's book of life from the
[50:28] foundation of the world and take the
[50:30] mark of the beast when the lamb was
[50:32] slain the names were put on the book
[50:34] he is standing in the holy place tonight
[50:36] in glory
[50:37] i want everybody to notice 1963 at the
[50:39] sixth seal he is standing in the holy
[50:41] place tonight
[50:42] in glory as an intercessor making
[50:45] intercessions
[50:46] for every one of those souls whose name
[50:49] is on that book
[50:50] i want to say praise the lord i don't
[50:52] know what anybody else preaches but this
[50:54] is the sixth seal
[50:55] and i thank god that he's saying as an
[50:57] intercessor
[50:58] he's in that holy place making
[51:00] intercessions
[51:01] still somebody says that's over
[51:06] you better be careful can you say mine i
[51:09] don't know when it's over nobody knows
[51:10] when it's over but in the sixth seal
[51:12] he's saying he's making intercessions
[51:15] for every one of those souls
[51:17] whose names are on that book
[51:21] and anybody knows that name but him
[51:24] he is the one that's got the book in his
[51:26] hand and he knows and when that last one
[51:28] comes in
[51:28] then his intercessing days is over he
[51:31] comes forth
[51:32] then to claim what he's interceded for
[51:34] he is doing the kinsmen
[51:36] redeemer work now and comes forth to
[51:39] receive his own
[51:40] oh my listen to this now that ought to
[51:43] set
[51:43] every christian to searching himself
[51:46] and holding his hands before god and
[51:49] saying
[51:50] cleanse me oh lord.
[51:55] notice he didn't say unbelievers he said
[51:57] christians
[51:59] even though that we say i believe i'm an
[52:00] elect i've been protesting in this time
[52:02] we need to raise our hands and say god
[52:04] cleanse me look into my life
[52:08] let me see where my bad part is let me
[52:11] get it out of the way
[52:13] real quick lord every teenager every
[52:17] young person every child
[52:19] every older person you ought to be know
[52:21] the hour i'm preaching to you this
[52:23] morning
[52:23] these are investigating angels we're
[52:25] almost at the end of this thing
[52:27] it should jolt our hearts and say god i
[52:29] need to invite you into my heart
[52:31] if you don't have the holy ghost and you
[52:32] keep putting it off say lord
[52:34] i need you i'm not only going to get to
[52:36] heaven because my parents go to this
[52:38] church
[52:38] i need to invite you and be baptized in
[52:40] the name of the lord jesus christ
[52:43] because the time is short i'm not
[52:44] hanging you over hell i'm trying to show
[52:46] you the time is short
[52:49] children listen to what brother paul is
[52:51] preaching to you we have fun we have
[52:52] youth meetings we do all kinds of things
[52:54] we love you we love your personalities
[52:56] we do everything for you but this is the
[52:58] core of what brother paul preaches
[53:00] is that we're in the last days we're in
[53:02] the last seconds of time
[53:04] ufos are showing everywhere
[53:06] investigating angels saying
[53:07] this thing is just about done
[53:11] you won't come out of tribulation and
[53:14] escape it
[53:15] without inviting this christ
[53:19] completely in your heart
[53:22] you won't get on the sh the coattail
[53:25] of your mom and dad or your pastor
[53:30] see i'll just grab a hold of daddy's
[53:31] coattail and i'll make it into the
[53:32] rapture
[53:33] no you won't you'll stand alone before
[53:36] this lord
[53:38] say god here i am cleanse me
[53:41] let me finish the quote for if the
[53:44] righteous me scarcely say
[53:45] where will the sinners and the ungodly
[53:47] appear it's a checking up time
[53:49] and if you would place it and want to
[53:51] and give this word
[53:52] i don't want to to ask me a question on
[53:55] this because it get might be plumb over
[53:57] on another
[53:58] i mean in writing your questions i think
[53:59] the question is done in anyhow
[54:01] this is the time of the investigation
[54:06] judgment if you want to know what time
[54:08] it is
[54:09] this is the time of investigating
[54:12] judgment
[54:12] we're not in the judgment yet but it's
[54:15] investigating judgment
[54:16] that's right now we'll get to that on
[54:18] the trumpets when we come to that
[54:19] whenever the lord provides on the vials
[54:21] you've got the seven vials the seven
[54:23] blast plagues the seven trumpets
[54:26] which are mostly the israel and world
[54:27] events and we'll find that out
[54:30] we've got the three wolves investigating
[54:33] when just before the woes went forth
[54:36] and we see that this is true and the
[54:38] three angels that struck the earth
[54:39] crying you know
[54:40] whoa whoa whoa unto the inhabitants
[54:44] of the earth and we're living in
[54:47] a terrific time everybody understand
[54:51] trying to make it just as crystal clear
[54:53] he's pointing in the sixth hill saying
[54:55] we're living in investigating angel's
[54:58] time
[55:00] it's a time where they say whoa and that
[55:02] means it's just around the corner
[55:05] it's over
[55:10] i read this article yesterday the u.s
[55:12] government is actually gearing up to
[55:14] share information about the reality of
[55:15] ufos with the public
[55:17] and not a moment too soon says the man
[55:19] who claims to have run the pentagon's
[55:20] ufo program for nine years
[55:23] former president trump his 2.3 trillion
[55:26] appropriation bill for 2021
[55:29] contained a mandate that the pentagon
[55:31] and spy agencies must file a report
[55:32] about unidentified
[55:34] aerial phenomena uap most of us just
[55:38] call them flying saucers or ufos
[55:41] whatever the jargon the whistleblower
[55:44] louis
[55:45] alzando former head of the advanced
[55:48] airspace threat identification program
[55:50] which operated out of this a secretive
[55:52] fifth floor of the pentagon sea ring
[55:54] told the post that the resulting
[55:56] blockbuster document
[55:58] which is reported slated to release
[56:01] this june tied to the mandate
[56:04] al zando said the upcoming report
[56:07] touches down on the unexplainable
[56:09] long time uf believers are hungry for
[56:12] explanations
[56:13] of the tic tac shaped objects the navy
[56:16] encountered in 2004 the strange
[56:19] cubes with spheres seen by navy pilots
[56:22] in 2014
[56:23] or the mysterious black triangles
[56:26] continually reported around the world
[56:29] details promised to come via the much
[56:31] anticipated report and at least one
[56:33] evolution of belief
[56:34] i think he says this i think the
[56:36] government has acknowledged
[56:38] the reality of uap el zondo
[56:41] exclusively told the post despite
[56:43] signing
[56:44] what he refers to as a lifelong nda
[56:47] before he resigned from the pentagon
[56:48] i think they all want answers and i
[56:51] think
[56:52] they are all willing to ask the hard
[56:53] questions
[56:55] during a press conference this week el
[56:57] zondo made clear
[56:59] that the ufos have been observed to have
[57:02] qualities
[57:02] that are nothing less than other worldly
[57:10] thank god we already knew that they're
[57:13] concluding now that these are nothing
[57:15] less but
[57:16] other worldly can't be from our world
[57:20] he described vessels flying at 11 000
[57:23] miles per hour
[57:24] and being able to turn instantly
[57:27] providing
[57:28] a comparison he explained for our most
[57:31] advanced jets going at the same speed
[57:34] if you wanted to make a right-hand turn
[57:36] it would take you about a half
[57:37] the state of ohio to make a right-hand
[57:39] turn he also detailed spielberg worthy
[57:42] operational capabilities that fall into
[57:44] the realm of trans-medium travel
[57:46] zondo explained that the eye-popping
[57:48] vessels can fly 50 feet above the
[57:50] earth's surface
[57:51] or 80 000 feet in the sky and even
[57:53] submerge underwater without a compromise
[57:55] in performance when you see that
[57:57] he says you recognize you're dealing
[57:59] with a technology
[58:01] way more advanced than ours we are
[58:04] nowhere near that
[58:08] our prophet already told us that
[58:11] we've been traveling at the speed of
[58:12] light for thousands of years
[58:15] at least angels have can you say man
[58:22] elijah was particularly disturbed by the
[58:23] locations where ufos and uaps tended to
[58:26] hover
[58:26] even the way in which these in
[58:29] explainable flying machines managed to
[58:31] lift off blows away rational engineering
[58:33] these things have no wings no cockpits
[58:37] no control surfaces no rivets in the
[58:40] skin
[58:41] no obvious signs of propulsion and
[58:43] somehow they are able to defy the
[58:45] natural
[58:46] effects of earth's gravity
[58:53] i know another group of people
[58:57] that's getting ready to divide earth's
[58:59] gravity
[59:01] i'm a part of that kingdom i'm a part of
[59:04] the kingdom
[59:05] that gravity's going to lose its hold
[59:07] someday brother josiah
[59:08] i'm a part of that kingdom
[59:12] this world keeps us earthbound but i got
[59:15] a holy ghost that's going to lift me up
[59:16] someday
[59:19] can you give me five more minutes here
[59:20] 10 minutes
[59:23] how is it possible elsando said how's
[59:25] that possible
[59:26] and by 2019 the pentagon had confirmed
[59:30] to the post for the first time now
[59:31] remember
[59:32] these their things are just coming out
[59:34] they've never admitted anything they've
[59:35] never admitted their reality they just
[59:37] make them a mystery
[59:38] but now they start putting in they gave
[59:40] this to the uh
[59:41] the post for the first time to put as an
[59:43] article that they researched and
[59:45] investigate ufos
[59:47] and continue to do so in other words
[59:48] they've just admitted that they're
[59:49] continuing their research all these
[59:51] years on this
[59:52] they've just admitted that they kept it
[59:53] quiet meanwhile
[59:55] ufo sightings in new york city were up
[59:58] 31
[59:59] in 2020 46 compared to 35 in the
[1:00:02] previous year
[1:00:04] marking a whopping 283
[1:00:08] spike from 2018.
[1:00:12] did anybody hear that percentage
[1:00:17] does that speak anything to anybody but
[1:00:19] that there is a 283 percent
[1:00:22] spike in investigating
[1:00:26] angels since 2018.
[1:00:30] does that say anything about the time
[1:00:33] that we're living in
[1:00:34] that if there's an increase in the
[1:00:37] visitation
[1:00:38] of investigating angels
[1:00:42] we're getting closer and closer can you
[1:00:46] say amen
[1:00:46] and i only say to that i pray there's an
[1:00:49] increase in visitations from god
[1:00:51] for me can you say man i
[1:00:54] pray there's a 283 percent
[1:00:58] increase since 2018 in visitations from
[1:01:02] god
[1:01:03] to you because we're close
[1:01:09] sodom is receiving these things and i'm
[1:01:12] saying this only by a prophet's
[1:01:14] word that speaks it so it's to happen
[1:01:17] i'm not going to get into the details
[1:01:19] which things they see as which or
[1:01:20] whatever
[1:01:21] i'm just saying he pointed us to say
[1:01:23] those lights whatever shame or for
[1:01:25] a shape they see there's a couple
[1:01:27] pictures of the shapes here
[1:01:30] some of these these days are pyramid
[1:01:31] shapes whatever they see i'm only
[1:01:33] pointing to what a prophet said
[1:01:35] that there will be lights and angels and
[1:01:37] investigating angels
[1:01:38] at the end time that's investigating
[1:01:40] sodom
[1:01:41] before the judgment day comes can you
[1:01:43] say amen there's 283
[1:01:45] increase in investigation angels in the
[1:01:47] three years more sightings last year
[1:01:49] another new pandemic increasing of more
[1:01:52] and more
[1:01:53] can you say man in other words as those
[1:01:56] things increase
[1:01:57] we know if jesus said that pestilences
[1:02:00] plural will come if there's a 283
[1:02:03] percent
[1:02:04] increase in this i wonder if there will
[1:02:06] be an increase
[1:02:07] in pestilences as well
[1:02:11] the thing is wrapping up i wonder if we
[1:02:14] could pray and say god
[1:02:16] let your visits to me increase
[1:02:19] can i get an amen let your visit if it's
[1:02:22] increasing for sodom
[1:02:23] let you come and visit elohim to me i
[1:02:26] want to be with him
[1:02:27] i want to be in his place i want to be
[1:02:29] where he is as gideon sings lord i want
[1:02:31] to be where you are
[1:02:32] in this room where jesus is can you say
[1:02:34] amen and he ha
[1:02:35] if he has these flying things
[1:02:37] investigate in sodom
[1:02:39] listen i'll let you know you can't hide
[1:02:40] anything if that's true that you can't
[1:02:42] if that's true and they're investigating
[1:02:45] you can't hide anything from him
[1:02:48] there's no sin that's secret there's
[1:02:50] nothing hidden to him
[1:02:52] that's what makes them so nervous is
[1:02:53] these things coming up
[1:02:55] and the way they move you guys can
[1:02:57] finish the i think they had a video did
[1:02:58] that one work too
[1:02:59] all right so just the pictures but you
[1:03:01] you see then that
[1:03:03] you you have to look at is that if
[1:03:05] there's these sightings are increasing
[1:03:07] then we realize that investigating
[1:03:09] judgment has taken place to wrap
[1:03:11] this thing up can you say amen
[1:03:15] but he knows what we're doing why not
[1:03:17] open up your heart and stand right in
[1:03:19] the lord's face this morning
[1:03:21] in his countenance instead of thinking
[1:03:23] that you're hiding things from sodom
[1:03:26] or from these angels i go home and i
[1:03:30] i don't know what people are looking at
[1:03:31] on my phone nobody else knows but
[1:03:35] but just me if this is true that's why
[1:03:37] they're so nervous
[1:03:39] because they realize this is this may be
[1:03:42] an enemy because they
[1:03:43] trump puts it under they these things
[1:03:45] are so serious trump gave all this money
[1:03:46] how much does it sums me a million
[1:03:48] or he calls it billions billions
[1:03:52] i love how trump says billions
[1:03:58] it's always billions to him
[1:04:02] it's all this money you know what he did
[1:04:04] because this is
[1:04:05] isn't going away and it's increasing and
[1:04:07] he's supposed to protect the country
[1:04:09] he says you've got to find out what this
[1:04:11] is in case this is other countries
[1:04:13] coming in stealth and we're not our
[1:04:15] country isn't protected
[1:04:18] how arrogant how proud is that i
[1:04:22] appreciate somebody trying to protect
[1:04:23] but they don't have an answer for these
[1:04:25] type of vessels or whatever they call
[1:04:27] them
[1:04:29] i believe we do this morning
[1:04:33] and that means they don't know what they
[1:04:36] can see
[1:04:37] i can tell them they can see everything
[1:04:40] there is no secrets they don't have
[1:04:44] anything
[1:04:45] whether that classified not with the
[1:04:47] angels of the lord
[1:04:49] and you don't have anything classified
[1:04:53] that you're hiding that's a secret from
[1:04:55] the lord
[1:04:57] it's time to live open and honest before
[1:04:59] the lord's face
[1:05:02] time to get your heart right with god
[1:05:05] time to look into his face and be
[1:05:07] changed by it
[1:05:09] that visit with him as the investigating
[1:05:12] angels got in sodom
[1:05:14] and i'm closing now two things
[1:05:18] because now i'll take our attention off
[1:05:20] of sodom and the investigating angels
[1:05:21] he's visiting in angels before judgment
[1:05:25] now
[1:05:26] but let's go back to abraham because
[1:05:28] that's what that's what we're
[1:05:30] concerned about there's two things
[1:05:33] that's happening there i've preached on
[1:05:34] some of these things before but it bears
[1:05:36] repeating and it's something we should
[1:05:37] know number one
[1:05:39] he's standing before the lord's face and
[1:05:42] he stood in his place
[1:05:43] before the lord as long as he stand
[1:05:44] there then the scripture says
[1:05:46] that he got up and he begins to walk
[1:05:49] towards sodom
[1:05:50] because he was going to go too and while
[1:05:53] he got up and walked what did abraham do
[1:05:56] he got up and started to walk with
[1:05:59] christ and begin to plead
[1:06:04] for any righteous that were in sodom
[1:06:09] he said lord if there's 50 would you
[1:06:12] spare it and i pointed it out before to
[1:06:14] you all
[1:06:15] lot's only hope was abraham praying and
[1:06:18] crying for mercy for him
[1:06:21] lot's family in sodom huh i won't ask
[1:06:23] for raising hands
[1:06:24] you got you got family members in sodom
[1:06:28] right now
[1:06:30] i mean we got piano players that were
[1:06:33] here
[1:06:34] that's living the life of sodom and
[1:06:36] gomorrah i'll just say it
[1:06:39] my wife and i pray for them we pray for
[1:06:41] their deliverance
[1:06:43] but they're living right in the middle
[1:06:45] of sodom
[1:06:46] got girls that have gone into lesbianism
[1:06:50] caught in that spirit
[1:06:54] ministers children
[1:06:58] i know some people in the message would
[1:07:00] just say well
[1:07:02] they've crossed the line they're done
[1:07:04] and i always try to point out
[1:07:05] that's not what your father abraham was
[1:07:07] saying
[1:07:10] why are you positioning yourself as a
[1:07:12] judge
[1:07:13] to put them finished didn't brother ron
[1:07:16] spencer preach it here
[1:07:17] you can't do that with anybody you
[1:07:19] cannot write anybody off
[1:07:21] no matter how low a person has gone
[1:07:23] there's still
[1:07:24] possibility for god to reach them out of
[1:07:26] the my reclaim
[1:07:28] your children that are unsaved whatever
[1:07:30] it is there's nothing impossible with
[1:07:32] god
[1:07:36] so if you don't get anything else this
[1:07:38] morning i would ask you to
[1:07:39] to grab these two things of position of
[1:07:42] abraham
[1:07:43] he's beholding in the face of the lord
[1:07:46] and he stands there
[1:07:47] that's what he's looking at but when he
[1:07:49] begins to move
[1:07:50] jesus moves with him in a heart and
[1:07:53] prayer
[1:07:54] for the souls in sodom
[1:07:57] nobody else is praying for that
[1:08:00] god let me just say it the way
[1:08:04] jesus said it was said about jesus
[1:08:09] one scripture in matthew i think it says
[1:08:12] jesus
[1:08:12] was moved with compassion
[1:08:16] for the lost
[1:08:20] the tendency in our generation is hard
[1:08:22] hearts
[1:08:24] writing somebody off somebody did me
[1:08:27] wrong
[1:08:28] that's it they're done that's the
[1:08:31] tendency of the world
[1:08:32] didn't jesus said many will betray one
[1:08:33] another in and the love of many
[1:08:36] will wax cold we've got to fight against
[1:08:39] that
[1:08:41] not only with our love for the lord we
[1:08:43] don't want a cold love towards the lord
[1:08:45] or lukewarm
[1:08:46] we don't want to draw cold but cold for
[1:08:48] our love for one another
[1:08:49] and for the lost and for someone who's
[1:08:52] done us wrong
[1:08:53] and for a customer or a boss or a dad or
[1:08:56] a grandpa
[1:08:57] or whatever it is we are the ones that
[1:09:00] can't get so cold-hearted that we don't
[1:09:03] even have a feeling
[1:09:04] to pray for the mercies of god to save
[1:09:08] them
[1:09:10] let's be like our father abraham
[1:09:14] let's be who we are the children of
[1:09:15] abraham
[1:09:17] and say lord as long as there's breath
[1:09:20] in my body
[1:09:21] and as long as i can read brother brad
[1:09:24] i'm saying
[1:09:26] the intercessor is still there make an
[1:09:29] intercession
[1:09:31] till every last elected seed comes in
[1:09:34] and then he leaves the mercy seat
[1:09:40] i'm correcting some doctrine here
[1:09:43] because people get technical say okay
[1:09:44] there's no mercy out there and there's
[1:09:46] no mercy to cert listen
[1:09:48] there's no mercy without blood and if a
[1:09:50] denomination doesn't have the real blood
[1:09:52] of jesus christ
[1:09:53] there's no mercy but whatever if the
[1:09:55] blood is still on the mercy which it is
[1:09:57] there's still hope for anybody there's
[1:10:00] still hope for anybody
[1:10:02] and we're going to continue to preach it
[1:10:03] that way because one of the reasons we
[1:10:04] know
[1:10:05] it's still there is because we're still
[1:10:06] here and the last elected seat hasn't
[1:10:08] coming in
[1:10:09] might be your kid sister laura
[1:10:12] it might be your daughter or son that's
[1:10:14] a wayward might be an uncle might be an
[1:10:16] ant can you say amen
[1:10:18] i'm still believing for my dad's family
[1:10:20] members that the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:22] will change them be filled with the holy
[1:10:25] ghost can you say amen
[1:10:27] and many times there's no others praying
[1:10:28] for that they don't want to
[1:10:30] we don't want them to be caught in this
[1:10:31] tribulation and judgment
[1:10:33] we want them saved and sanctified filled
[1:10:36] with the spirit of god our children my
[1:10:39] children your children
[1:10:41] those that have left us those that went
[1:10:42] astray though who's left a message
[1:10:44] don't try to get all bogged down and
[1:10:46] just pray abraham said if there's 50
[1:10:48] lord would you spare it
[1:10:49] if there's 30 when you spare it and he
[1:10:51] said he would and if there's 10
[1:10:53] i think it got down to 10 or 5 if
[1:10:55] there's just a few righteous lord would
[1:10:57] you spare it
[1:10:58] and god and the elohim listen to
[1:11:01] abraham and because his prayer and cry
[1:11:05] was heard by our lord look at that faith
[1:11:08] that he had
[1:11:09] look at what the lord said if there's
[1:11:11] that many i'll spare it
[1:11:12] there wasn't even ten but because of
[1:11:15] abraham's
[1:11:16] crying out for mercy god spared lot in
[1:11:19] his family
[1:11:22] that's our position brother ed we stand
[1:11:25] in a very important position for our
[1:11:26] loved ones
[1:11:28] there's no no hope without us
[1:11:31] so let's not get caught up in
[1:11:32] possessions let's not caught up in
[1:11:34] more money can you say man let's not get
[1:11:37] caught up in this building
[1:11:39] i told our staff and our our leaders i
[1:11:41] told some of them listen
[1:11:43] we've had to be so obsessed with getting
[1:11:44] this this way it's time to
[1:11:46] put our focus off of this building and
[1:11:48] put it back on what really matters
[1:11:50] this will be gone someday let's have
[1:11:52] ones crying out for souls that have been
[1:11:54] lost
[1:11:55] let's cry for those that have left the
[1:11:56] message lord bring them back
[1:11:58] and put them on these pews listening to
[1:12:00] the word of god
[1:12:02] will you join with me saints
[1:12:05] will the young people join with me say
[1:12:07] god give me a heart to cry for the lost
[1:12:10] give me a compassion break my heart if
[1:12:13] it's stony lord
[1:12:15] let me find within that
[1:12:18] inner fellowship with god and looking at
[1:12:21] his face
[1:12:22] let me find that real soberness to say i
[1:12:25] know the hour that i'm living i know
[1:12:29] how late it is now i'm going to hold on
[1:12:31] to my faith
[1:12:32] for those that are lost can we stand and
[1:12:35] pray
[1:12:37] sobering thoughtful things to
[1:12:41] to ponder this morning not at all meant
[1:12:44] to scare
[1:12:45] anybody because i know if i preach these
[1:12:48] investigating angels
[1:12:49] and i see how close we are to the ending
[1:12:52] date
[1:12:53] i can tell you i'm not afraid at all
[1:12:56] i'm burdened and concerned for the loss
[1:13:00] but i am not afraid of this world ending
[1:13:04] because there's another verse there that
