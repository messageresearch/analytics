just read and then we can sit just going to read verses last time the uh 21 it's all hello Revelation 1 verse 1-6 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw John and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heav have been prepared as a bride adorned and I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself says there God himself that he goes in no other no other form and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the found of Life May thank the Lord for the reading of his word so again I'm just going to again finish hopes to be finished I did make some changes just so that we could see and read better the other church was definitely different is what I was more used to in terms of smaller that you could uh weren't far from the screen and things but even I just had a lot of trouble reading it uh myself down the back back so it does make more more slides but it's just not as condensed as all so this uh this message particularly is from two messages it's from Mostly from future home of the USC Biden Biden guide Grom and uh I just referred to his future home and also uh the other one is Harvest Time which is only a couple of days after so he kind of flows into the other one uh which he which is so easy to do that you're run the same thoughts into the next message and that's what he did so it's kind of a two-part thing it happens often so we're just thankful for uh and it's it's just amazing uh how it is weaved in there in the future home the these thoughts about the Plan of Redemption in there he it's just because he's got a couple of different topics and it just it just pecks in every right to it's a long message and it goes in from early in the message right till later in the message and it's uh it's just uh really it's it's like U uh the word in due season you know it's just uh when he preached when he preached about that like food in due season and and when there was just things that were stored up word was stored up and it was just let released and let go uh you know over time because you just couldn't take it all in so these things come out and you hear them and you hear the Ministry talking about things and a lot of times they're saying the same thing is because this stuff with the opening of the seventh seel it just it just made it all clear you know and we we all see it ourselves now how God does it how he's back and forth in Ang it Compares as an angel and uh you know I just read a scripture to here uh a quote to her the other day I should have probably brought it but it it was Jesus Christ same yesterday and today and forever and brother Brandon was saying you know I just had so I said I prayed about this and I talked to the angel of the Lord so much about it you know he says it's so casually you know it's just wonderful that he can have that relationship with Christ like that you know in the angel of the Lord you know so here we see the two the two he had to split it for a time it was it was an end and a beginning and an end and it would eventually end there there would be no more time so we're living in that now and we know it oh okay just leave there and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the loss that God by his Sovereign Grace might someday lift that little hickey or Gap or time back into the perfect circle then she then she rolls on just the same you see see once it time is over it just starts it's just eternity again it's like that forever and never happen again it's all for a reason right and he said like he said here it's what I just read it's the reason was for the trying and perfecting and for the purging of the lost that God by his Sovereign Grace might someday lift that that God of his Sovereign Grace might someday lift that little hickey or Gap back into the perfect circle so like I say we're we're Sons and Daughters of God the Angels didn't have to go through this we were we were bypassed our theophan and went right in here into flesh into a sinful time sinful time there below as as as was created by God in that time created meaning having a beginning and an end but the Angels didn't do that the Angels didn't have to do that they were just Servants of God they did they don't they never would appreciate like we do the salvation and the Redemption that we we go through what we had to go through all the Christians when they get to heaven they they would never understand it right this is when Jesus came in flesh in these spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity you see it there's Plan of Redemption right wonderful and all the all the when he created this he created that Loop of time and all the seed were in the Earth so they were everyone that was going to everyone that was his was in the Earth at that time and of course the Earth is a part also of of God it was in the thoughts of God so if you were in the thoughts of God at the beginning you were put here in the earth when he created the Earth right in Genesis so where you know the Earth was the same the Earth was the thought the Earth will always be the Earth will never not be it'll never it didn't have a it didn't have a beginning because it was in the thought of God just like we were right and you see that alter the seals especially the six seal is just something that's not destroyed same as us is not destroyed but we're we're purified we're clean and then brought in so the Earth is it's an it's a thought of God God and owns so just this quote so just this quote here so just this quote here that I read this quote here that I read last qu here I read last time again I read last time again this is last time again this is from har again this is from Harvest Time this is from Harvest Time which is right after and I want to bring you bring you conscience conscious of that before we approach further that God is in this room the author of this this word is here so he's he's with his word so it doesn't matter how you are dressed or what degree you live in Life or what kind of home you live in or what type of care you drive or how much education you've got God looks at your heart and he looks in my heart and we're judged from our heart not even our words our heart judges us from the heart speaketh the mouth if it isn't it's hypocrisy right so it's it's I just want to just do the review quickly not get too bogged down but it's uh it's just wonderful it's just like David he was a man after God's Own Heart and and David would pray he say you know listen to me you know look at my heart and that's that's what it because you know that's what what God sees right the rest is the Flesh and the flesh is never be will never be purified or in or clean or holy in the sight of God we you'll have it right till you leave it you're always going to have it so so here uh we're familiar with this and I just use it again because uh it just it just shows in terms of in the in the Old Testament and the the Jews they U they they had this the the feast here that they followed every year and they did it for 1,600 years under the law and it was it was for something but they lose side of that it's just so easy for humans to do that you know we get on a path we like and we can just go forever and it a lot of times we don't like to change right and in the case it's a case of everyone you know just there's some things you just don't want to change but God God has a plan and he sees a change coming and he gives he starts to work on you and you're kind of you know it's is you know sometimes not so easy to make a change right and especially in the uh in the Old Testament in the New Testament and B often said that you know it takes a prophet to to take a turn you know we can go straight and keep doing what we have to do and go straight but it takes a prophet to come and make a turn and to do God's will you know to shows the way to go so here you know the the the uh the feast went on for 1600 years and they did the same thing they go through this you know Passover and that represents the lamb that you see it back in Exodus and when uh the children of Israel were leaving Egypt and where they started to do these things and They carried it on forever right up until the person came along that was going to fulfill this right and and the Jews could not come Rend that that here now we have a Passover and it's not a lamb like an animal this is the real capital L lamb that has come now is going to fulfill this and once it's fulfilled it's over right you don't have to do it again you know and we know that now and Peter knew it but a lot of Jews didn't you know and it said it RI ripped the veil that was in the temple from top to bottom and these veils were huge right and heavy and hard but they just went in and fixed it and went out but Jesus was God was showing that you know this was fulfilled you don't need this anymore you we're not going to do it this way anymore well what way are you going to do it well the way Peter did it Peter was a Jew right and he had the Revelation and he came out and told him look this is all fulfilled we don't have to do this anymore now here's what we're going to do and they they remember this Passover in in in in the uh communion and the foot washing and things like that that's how we remember it we don't have to do it like they do like like the Jews do and kill a lamb to show that they that was over that was finished but you know it's still carried on with so many people doing it but the what God was expecting is what he saw in the Acts of the Apostles right and that's what happened and that's what we carry on today and that's what we need to do because it like we said it's it was U it was a revelation and Peter had a firm Revelation he had the Holy Spirit there right and he knew what was what was required so this goes on here and it goes up in I put in a holy convocation because that is U that that was really representing the Eighth Day and so God comes and fulfills the feast the Feast of the Lord Leviticus 23 forever once and for all so the Jews after the U Pentecost then there really it was uh it's quiet in the Jewish tradition with these feast days it was was quiet but really you know the the uh Revelation and the carrying out of that was in the Gentiles through the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals that's what that was the type of was the Gentile Church coming into uh God's body so that's that's what happened then and then it comes back into on on on the uh later months in the fall feasts and you see the trumpets the atonement and the and the Tabernacles is what really what the the 144,000 is going to see fulfilled in this and they won't have to do it no more it'll be done it'll be all finished you know so that's uh that's the next thing in line for us and I I I did a whole series on that a few years ago if you remember no you don't but probably but but we went into it quite deep each one of those uh feasts and that right so trying to move along that's my what I just said so the Feast of trumpets the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time so this is a you know a quote that said a lot and this brother R talks about this in terms of after 2,000 years of denominational systems and the the uh the way the the word was hacked up then God and was really at in the seventh in the last day was when that the U uh uh Christ with the word Christ being is is loosed is no longer sealed up under denominational teaching and thinking is no longer like that and denominations brother ban was against denominations he was all against always against denominations and rightfully so because denominations just just separate right they they get a few Believers together and few unbelievers probably and few make believers and they create their own denomination and their own way that God wants us to do things the way that they interpret the word and they build a fence around it and there's no there's no uh uh Fellowship then with any other Christians only the ones that believe that way and we know now there's something like 33,000 denominations and various of various uh different kind of uh organizations up to 33,000 that are just separated from each other and brother Brandon was against it you know totally he was saying you know this is the body and the body needs to be uh you know in fellowship and denominations are keeping us out of Fellowship so you know this is what happened in ' 63 is that you know the uh uh the the full word came it was loosed under those denominations and the full word came into place and and then the bride was called I call you no more church I call you bride right and I remember to this day reading that where I was and it it was just an amazing statement but and it was a big turning point for the church because now you're no longer Church your bride he was finished he was outside the door knocking right he couldn't get in in Revelation three and that's that was that fulfilled right there you know in that for from then on and when the bride was going to be called uh so but to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time light the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it so after 2,000 years that was done the word being set free and we're the benefactors of all of that amen and I'm thankful from the future home and all our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created because you're out of the Dust of the Earth Earth it was all laid out there when God himself created it and were in in his thinking and in in him the great Eternal was the thought which is his attribute right so you you see here it's God himself he's only by himself everything that he's created now is all separated from him because of sin so God himself can't go in there and the people that are in that that a realm of time can't go in to the realm of Eternity you know you can't go into that realm of Eternity because you have to be holy it have to be totally holy and we're not in that state because it his body right so here he is totally separated so he he begins this is the beginning here where he he's he's he's got to lay out a Plan of Redemption like how all my people are over there they're separated from me so how am I going to get those back there and how am I going to get in there so we all get back together and that's the plan the Plan of Redemption so how will he bring his seed back to Eternity in the condition they're in what is the plan everything created on Earth resides in time under Adam and Eve God himself is not not with them in Genesis 3 after Adam and Eve were removed from the Garden of Eden they were removed and brother randam even alludes that Adam really didn't have full understanding of what happened back there it was like was he was blinded of it so he is in eternity Adam and Eve are in time and two different Realms so that's that's where it's all now starting and he's got to he's got to put a plan in to get them back so what's the plan he knows the plan so I I this is small I know and it's hard it's just a little timeline shown Old Testament here and feast in the feast and nothing really changed in the Old Testament there wasn't there was there wasn't anything God did go he did go in a form and he would go in and he would go to Joshua and he would go to Moses and he would go you know to Gideon or all of these prophets he would go to them and in a form and he would create something that was holy that he could go in and then go into time that's how he did it he could never go himself and and when when people died who are in time they went to a place and we know it was uh it was it was under there was seems to be uh a place where uh the the the ones who were not children of God were heing and there was a great Gulf fixed and then there was other people because you know uh you could see it that they could see AC cross you know in the scriptures you could see in the gospels they could see over there but when Jesus now died and Rose they were taken from them and went to paradise and they went to another place and that was never the case after once Jesus died but but they could never go into that presence of God they never could because they couldn't they still didn't have their body they still didn't have their body it was still in the earth and still couldn't uh uh couldn't go through that change in order that they could go into the presence of God's holiness God himself so that that's what what happened here we see the uh and we wenter this just to go quickly the seven sabbaths at at at the resurrection and of at Calvary and then we went into to the Pentecost which was the 50th day and that's a holy convocation and as it says here below so there's the holy convocation the Holy Fire And The Eighth Day soul is the Eternal uh rain realm forever so in the Holy convocation that's a that's an eighth day and original day that's the Eternal day Jews were required to sacrifice Animals by fire for their holy day but it just didn't work the same until Peter realize it the first one the 120 who went into the upper room went through that Holy convocation which was a a burning and they were totally burnt out from that and received the Holy Spirit they were burnt out by a holy convocation you have to have it the Holy Fire and the Earth has to have it everything that goes back is going to go back up into that eternity realm has to have that Holy convocation and it's the Eighth Day and and then there's also so in the Holy communication there was three elements here and uh that had to be brought to their Eighth Day or back to the first day the original day the Eternal day so it's the Eternal day there's no more no more sevens no more after this once they go through the eighth you're into eternity once you've reached the E Peter was in that Eternal day his soul was in that Eternal day it was in in eternity so the first one first one has to be your soul and then the second one is the Earth and then there was an eighth day for the word of God and we just mentioned that one so it is the end of the seven sabbaths with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now your soul is in the Eternal day Peter was in eternity amen so we we got that already from from the uh from the last time brother Brian says and notice after 50 days he's explaining this now what happened during that that first day in the day of when the Holy Ghost came down when it came out of the upper room and notice after 50 days or seven sabbaths from here again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost the eighth day there was seven sabbaths later 8th day after the seven sabbaths 49 exactly after his resurrection so it had be seven times that again and bring it right back around to the first day of the week again exactly so that's a holy congregation that's an day an original day that's an eternal day and that's why it can never be changed what Peter said can never be altered repent and be baptized he said that on that Eternal day it'll never be changed that can't be altered you can't sidestep and turn around that that's part of the Holy convocation that's part of the mystery of redemption that was laid out everyone has to be B repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus that's simple but not a lot of people doing it right so the Old Testament continued on the blood sacrifice of the Lamb covered their sins God was revealing himself and God came down in the form of man Jesus Christ so now it's all changed it took a huge change that's why Calvary is so important and we went through that all last time but that quote there brother ROM is saying the same thing I'm saying I hope and pray so I'm really going through the this so of 50 day the Holy Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and the 50th day sorry about the small I tried to make it a bit bigger it's an eternal Day end of Sabbath your your soul is an eternal day Born Again of the spirit of God and act so we see now the soul what happened with Peter is the soul went into eternity he was in his body but his soul now was was was was eternal because it had hit that e so that's that's why you feel the way you do or sense the way you do or you know because your soul is part of that Eternal it it you you received by the Holy Ghost you've received the Holy Fire you've ref you you've received the Holy convocation so you're you that's all redeemed it's all Eternal and the beauty of it that it's it's in it's in that Eternal part and the devil can't get at it there's no way it can get at it God has you've gone through the judgment you've gone you've gone through it all your soul is is in there will the flesh still will it will the flesh still have trouble the flesh will still have trouble why because it's in the element of time it has not received uh uh uh a holy fire a holy convocation and never will it will never reach it but your soul praise God is in that Eternal realm right and God doesn't see it he doesn't see he doesn't see everybody days anymore what he I sinned yesterday uh he he doesn't go by days he doesn't understand it he he I guess he understands it but he doesn't work work with that he works with eternity this is dumb I can't even see it God can't even see you you know it's all finished there's no way it can be held against you you're going to come up and you've already you've gone through what he wanted you to do I'm doing my plan and I your it's your time time you get the holy you get the holy uh you get the Revelation you get the holy convocation you get the Holy Fire and you're brought into his presence into eternity you're taken away from the devil's presence he can't get at you he can get at your flesh but you know that right you know you see he get he can get at your mind right but you know you can be very happy today to know that you're you're your you're if you're if if you got the Holy Spirit then you're in that presence of the Eternal you're back there where you came from right CU that's where you started you're always in the the mind of God and now the work is done so now okay it's like the symphony I'm a note I'm done he goes on he just goes on right so you're just waiting you're doing what he needs you to do here maybe it's another Soul or whatever it is he needs you to do and that's you're doing it but it's over it's wonderful it's just you got to have the revelation of it right it's part of the doesn't matter it's still done right it's it's part of the Holy convocation that's why people give testimonies right this is what happened me basically you didn't get saved there you were you were always saved right God just want had to get you back that's all you know and that's and that's what you you felt at the altar is that you realize what happened you know God has come to get me it's part of the Holy congregation that was laid out laid out the Holy Fire the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the soul you must have Holy Fire not a handshake it it has to annihilate every Trace Satan has on you or you will or you will or will have on you has on you or will have on you it's not a man-made religion at this stage so it's not like if you're if you're going to a church and you shake hands and and then you just go on you carry on the same way and you come to church every Sunday it that doesn't happen you go through the Holy Fire you go through a total change of desires you don't have any of those desires anymore you don't do this do do these things anymore you you're congregating with a whole different PE set of people right you know you've taken you know it's not yourself but you come down it's just like me I came down the road and I hit a fork and I could carry on in the way I was living with the people I was living with or whatever or I go down this thing now I'm going to go any because you're predestinated you had no choice you're going anyway right but you know that that's what happens is is that you go through a separation and you're separated from those things right and that's the plan of his Plan of Redemption that's how he was planning to come back and get you it's not a man-made religion at this stage right right is not you're into the big leagues now right so here from the future home what happened Christ came and called the church to repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and he's talking about right here now in Pentecost right what happened with Peter at that time and the other other in the upper room and those that were converted that that day baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the the remission sanctify the church and with the fire of God come down and burn out all the filth and come and dwells in the human heart that because he made that that soul of yours holy so that he could dwell otherwise he couldn't and the only way he can do that is with the Holy Fire that's that's easy right that's easy to understand right that's how he could come into you into your soul because it was it received the Holy convocation the Eternal fire and that was we know in the Old Testament used to be a a Sacrifice by fire that's what they used to do was uh always sacrificed an animal by fire and burnt it like the man was when he still had hatred Mal oh sorry I didn't get like the man was when he still had hatred malice and strife in him when the fire baptism come it cleaned it off no more jealousy no more of nothing it's just just absolutely is a dwelling place for God and remember that's his delegation that's going to meet him Yonder you know so and you can see the difference like it's it's paragraph 107 and he's saying the same thing in paragraph 284 so this thing is all weaved into right into that message but you know it's uh it's it's just wonderful what God is doing with his people and you know he's he's not going to come back and get those that weren't in his mind in the foundation of the world he's not going to do it you know it's like like we always thought we always thought that every scripture that dealt with salvation uh applied to everyone but it didn't there's there's there's there's different types here there's the elect and the elect are the only ones that are going to get the Holy Ghost the the elect are only the only ones that are in the Plan of Redemption they're the only ones that will receive the Holy Spirit the the other ones say you know the those that are saved saved uh uh saved in the end uh you know save from destruction they're given uh eternal life they they never did have the Holy Ghost in their real life they just uh they just might have had justification and sanctification and lived the holy life in things but they never received the Holy Ghost right so they will have to go through the tribulation for the sake for the sake of uh they didn't they didn't receive the word in in this day for their age so they go through the tribulation come up to the Judgment they don't take the Amica of the Beast so they're giving eternal life that's what happens so they go and they they go and live outside the city they don't they're not in the city because it's the bride is the only one in the city so they're outside the gates at at night D do dot so that and that's Grace to him you know that's Grace that's God's grace and he goes through through all of those different ones in there the unbeliever and whoever it is in the in the judgment and uh I think he'll have Grace for a lot of people's someone who did good to the bride and all of those things right and they weren't they weren't part of the in God's mind in the beginning they weren't an attribute of God so all that happens but the this is for the bride and there's scriptures and he says when when he goes and he has 99 and he's missing one he's going to leave that 99 and go get it right and that doesn't mean uh you got a choice right you're going and you you should want to go right uh so when you when you understand it all I didn't understand it I wasn't looking for it and it it came right because it was your number was up you were called and you think oh I was saved here I wasn't saved I was always saved he was just coming to get me back you got it right wonderful plan so here is in the scriptures and when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is what he's talking about where Christ is in your soul that Holy Soul who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in sorry who has blessed us with all Heaven spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him from the foundation of the world and in Leia Church age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it its own mouthpiece that's what happened in 63 so God is turning on her he he will confound her through the prophet he's talking about the nominal church here right through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in Revelations 22:7 the spirit and the bride say come right amen still in review here we did cover this so here in the future home you be you become a new person amen not just an old one patched up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit God takes the old man and burns him completely out holy convocation and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself sends down your representation Holy Spirit no one can come to me except my father has drawn him and all the father has given me will come to me you see it some plan same plan same way for everyone right and over here on the side is just these these uh he he just scramble these verses but it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in Noah cast out right and the other part of that no man can come come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him so no the father has to to come looking for you right no one can go up a lot of that's denomination when you go up to the altar to be saved and God didn't call you that's denomination because you're going yourself good for you right but uh it's not you're not the elect you may be the elect later God might call you the right way who knows we never know we can never judge but that's denomination when you just go yourself right but if God calls you if you're just going on in your life like me and you're going on and then all of a sudden tap tap God calls you then that's a different story right you're you're elect right so no man can come to me except the father has sent me has sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day so there is a way for the elect and that's Under The Plan of Redemption so how we doing on time oh no so Satan will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother or he can tempt he can tempt you but he cannot get a born again Christian you're once you're in that eternity once that your soul is in that that eternity realm it's over right it's it's it's Ephesians 4:30 right but God from the foundation of the world foresaw him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he sin when he can't be seen even by God the only can't he can the devil can't see it see that Soul God can't see it the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation amen that is true see but by the same means for the world is one of its attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes the Earth is an attribute of God it's a thought of God it was in there from the beginning the world you see that you read that all in the Sixth Seal the world comes becomes one of his attributes because it was in God's thinking in the beginning to have the world to be on a throne to be a king or a redeemer to be a Healer that's his attributes so he's just whatever he has thought he's going to do it there's nothing going to stop it if that's in his thoughts he's going to do it if that person was in his thoughts it's going to be there right there's no choice here you know I know you could really put up a stink if you wanted to you know it's like brother's brother and God will take you he'll take you off the scene way earlier than you should but you're still some of God now you probably miss you won't get your reward that you see in Revelation 21 22 you won't get your reward or something but you're still there you're a thought of God sorry that I didn't click click on that sorry about that should be reading it out of there so there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal things that's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God look how high this is with eternal life with the predestinated that never did that never did start there was no start right you were always there always have eternal it's never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved this is quite statement isn't it amen Jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with amen and the world doesn't have access to it you say but you made a mistake yesterday I'm not judged in days he says here you know you weren't saved on any day you you're I'm not judging days I don't start on a day the devil can point to yesterday and last and last week day and last year day and 20 years ago day and none of that counts why because I have passed from days and weeks and months and I'm in eternity you you are always saved so there is no such thing as spiritual death now to the baptized saint of God the curse is gone when the Holy Spirit accepts you you you don't accept it it accepts you do you know that Jesus said that to his disciples you haven't chosen me actually I've chosen you you don't accept it it accepts you because it's God's attribute it was accepted because you were ordained for that P that purpose you were you were yes you were born in sin just like everybody else Paul taught taught us that but he says the thought of God has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose yet you were born in sin but God has had that attribute and here you here you expressed yourself on Earth and he comes down and gets you he came down and got you he took you from there to here and now you can't ever leave here so this is the position you are and the whole thing is based on an attribute of God a thought of God he says he comes down to get you and know you're back there back here here is where you belong so an attribute it's like a gene right it's like a you have a gene it's it's the same with in God's terms right so getting through it here Heaven and Earth have met is from the future home God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun has begun see all the curse is gone just like all the curse is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you didn't accept it it accepts you you see because it's God's attribute see if if it's the holy ghost means God's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of God it's a gene has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose you was born in sin but God had that attitude and here you are here you express yourself here on the earth and he comes down and gets you see you're back here you're back here he's talking about that eternity part here is where you belong and sin has lost its power that's right the desire for sin has gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you are a restored person that doesn't happen in your heart that other those desires are be in your flesh that's what you have to work on you have to like Paul says in Galatians you have to push that down right and you push it down eventually it will go right believe me it will so just a quick just some U Insight on this so with St Paul uh was a prophet and when he passed on it went into as we know the Gentile agees from 1 to 7 and then in the seventh age there was another Prophet wood brandham came on the scene and it was for a very specific reason there was many many things for brother Brandman to come come in as the seven Church age messenger and the prophet to that age that would come and you know there was just as a messenger so there was there was many things that brother rham had to do in that age and then after you know before the Rapture he leaves the scene of course and when the Rapture comes it's the end of the Gentile age so in in terms of the Jews they they they have a path this is pretty empty right up to the last last of it but it come all the six trumpets are have been have been uh uh uh you know already finished so they're complete it's only the seventh trumpet which is in Revelations 11 and that's when the two prophets are on the scene with 144,000 revelational evidence all that right so in the as I said before in the seventh is when all of this trumpets will be revealed by these two prophets so he knows there Moses Mo and Elijah they'll have other names but that's the spirit of Moses Moses and Elijah these two prophets and then after of course they go into Armageddon they die and then it goes into the Millennium that's the timeline for it all so William manam picked up they automatically picked up where Paul left off right so Paul left off and the church went right into a a a downward slope right down into the uh Dark Ages and it only started come up we've went through this before come up in Luther's time in the re in the Reformation right it started to started to pick up again and but at this point once Paul went off the scene and it was all warnings that it was the spirits that were in the church and it was going to fall and it did in the first age gradually all fall off right into a tribulation so but then brother brandham when brother brandham is not a messenger couldn't pick it up what what had to be done here at the end it had to be a prophet who had to speak to these things in the seventh age right when it was over so a prophet came on the scene the grace of God to us that a prophet came we wouldn't know otherwise you could see how confused the denominations is because and how the world is because of the spirit that's been dropped and the Darkness that's upon the Earth right and gross Darkness upon the people so that's what's happening but in Ghost and there was light right so the bride in this age you know were in light and a lot of light and it's good light but we're still like in that diagram I got with the time it's a shadow it's just like a negative of a f right it's not clear it's not very clear at all in this age really what's going on with God but the light is in the great light is in that Eternal realm right and so when your soul gets that light there's an Awakening and a and a light that you have in this walk on this Earth that let you get through in to uh the into that Eternal peace with all of you Body Soul Spirit everything right so we're in the process so brother Brandon picked up right where St Paul left off and and and he was following what Paul said because we know when he went over into that other dimension they said you know uh you know you know that to the people said said to him you know you know to you know Paul what Paul says and and that's what he said he was doing right he was he was doing what Paul was doing he says what Paul says right and then in the end Moses and Elijah picks up where where Paul uh lead leaves off so they do the same thing so it's all just a a gap for the Gentiles to come in so Paul is here and and then they the the other two prophets come on the scene 2,000 years later and just pick right up so it's all pled right that don't happen just you know H by luck this is all planned the whole thing is planned and they have the same message come out of her my people it was the same message that both both sides have and you know one side Moses Elijah doesn't know really anything about they're not even really manifested yet this will be soon I hope and then you know the prophet is off seen anyway right now it's in the broad so just trying to get through it so here just get down to a point here St Paul goes off the scene and after that John is imprisoned on the a of patmas for two years takes him two years on the thing he's totally blind and he sees all these things writes it down it's all in symbol form not to be not to be revealed so John records what he sees in sees on the island into a book The Book of Revelation and the Book of Revelation is sealed then for 2,000 years no one knew what was going on if you read any commentaries and you if you want to waste your time and you they start talking about Revelation and they say well it could be this they talk about a little phrase and it could be this but it could be this or it could be one person could be that you know it's just blinded to it all right strictly part of the Plan of Redemption it's it's it's for the bride so the Seven Seals are sealed and everything is in symbol form that's what we what the person reading Revelation looks like so it is a closed book in the last seventh last age the seventh age a prophet is on the scene we all know this Christ comes down and breaks the Seven Seals in March 1963 what a great day and you know the church is over right it was the first thing he declared the church is over right it's finished the book of Revelation is revealed through a prophet and no one has understood these Mysteries since St Paul Paul St Paul knew he knew this stuff because it was it was uh it was open then because John had it sealed so if something was sealed it must have been opened it had to be be there before right and Paul knew it Paul references it when he goes up in those other dimensions and stuff like that and he sees things now he didn't reveal it because it wasn't his day he knew this was coming but this had to come now and it was all being he knew what was going to happen and Paul was long dead before poor John went on the a so the world says we don't need a prophet has anyone heard that don't put up your hand right everyone's agreed it's only the everyone that's experienced it right it's only the ministry of the son of man that reveals the mystery of redemption it's only in the son of man the son of man is a is is in a prophet form right when it comes down Jesus came as son of man Paul and brother randam came as son of man and they came they came to reveal and they were the only ones that deal in the in Redemption because the Redemption Redemption is only for the elect if you go and say these things to someone who's not in the bride everyone here is in agreement I'm pretty sure right those are are listening are in agreement and you know if you go into the world with this into nominations they would not believe you at all they would they don't can't even get through a prophet let alone The Plan of Redemption and all of this laid out here you know what the prophet laid out in these in these messages they wouldn't believe it we know they won't because they can't they're blinded to it right I understand that I don't hold that against them could be me right but by election is not right the ministry of the son of man operates to a prophet right so with when there's a son of man on this Earth is a prophet you know a full-fledged Prophet the and brother BR was a prophet the ministry of and Paul was a prophet the ministry of redemption requires prophetic Insight because you have to you have to turn a corner here God is s the prop to turn a corner this is he's saying first a second AG third AG I can't remember the order of them fifth sixth 7th and then there's a turn now we will go on the same churches go on the same we go on okay this all these people died we're still going the same way doing the same things every day and it takes something like a prophet with God behind it to make it make the turn and we're making the turn now and it's not easy right it's not easy because things change we you don't like change there are M Mysteries under Redemption that you have have there are mysteries on the Redemption that you have access to I just want get on my notes Here the mystery of redemption was contained in the book of redemption now did you ever hear the book of redemption I didn't hear the book of redemption so all of these Mysteries that happen in for Redemption are hidden and they're not mentioned much in the in the Epistles or the you see what happened but it's not explained very well but and that's what the entire Book of Revelation is about is about Redemption the entire book of redemption is about God redeeming his family and if you read it that's what it's about right it's at the end and he's redeeming his family and the Earth and his people in the seals and the trumpets and all of this and the kingdom and setting up a whole new civilization right right up to Revelations 20 2122 all the judgments happen so this is all about Redemption the book of redemption is the Book of Revelation right I never you know that's really something that's wonderful Redemption and in there was seven so what is the what The Book of Revelation about it's about Redemption and in there was a Seven Seals book of redemption and Christ opened it and gave it to a prophet who gave it to the people and everyone has access to it you have access to it totally open as much as you can is revealed to you you know but it's totally revealed as long as you can just reach it right God has accepted you because you were ordained yet you were born in sin but you were an attribute and you expressed yourself worthy and he came and got you now you're back here where you belong and sin lost its power these are Mysteries under Redemption that you have access to amen God bless us because when you look at the Book of Revelation it was sealed up by John John didn't understand it he was getting all mixed up he thought that he was thought this Angel who was a prophet thought it was Christ and it was bound down before for it and had to pick him up and this is not you know this is not this is a prophet right and you know the different angels and him trying to figure it out and he would look at things and they'd say seal it up he didn't know what it was it was just in a symbol form and they said seal it up don't say nothing or don't even put a symbol on this part you know the Thunders or something so he didn't know it and up to the 2,000 years no one knew it and then it was opened it was open in our age and a prophet came along and opened it and we're the only ones the bride is the only on that saw in it in its full form what it meant not in symbol form but in actual revelation of what these things mean and what it is and let us see see uh all that was going to take place upon the Earth so that is an hour so I've got I think I finished my review but I don't have many pages here just I going to do it quick here just so we get through it here so on the top here it says the earth and the body so the the body your body is your soul is redeemed we know that it's up in the you see it up in eternity there and uh the earth the earth and the body are together when the earth is is redeemed the body are are are redeemed right so you see it here and probably can't see it that well but it it really goes out here the holy you see the seventh age and then there's the 3 and 1/2 years of the uh marriage supper for the bride and in the Millennium for a thousand years a thousand years okay so that makes 7,000 oh seven what happens after seven we all know now right right if you don't if you know it don't put up your hand it's the it's the holy convocation right so the fire comes down so the earth the earth is cleared here now it's coming down not on a person but it's coming down on a on on the earth now because the Earth is the attribute it's a seed of God it's a gene of God it's going to be used in eternity by God all the people are going to dwell on the earth the New Jerusalem new heavens and the new Earth is all on the earth on the earth the new Earth he's G he's doing it now you know Abraham looked forward we're going to find it it's going to be and it has but it has to go through here so in theill millenum you know we're still on the earth it is burnt over here by atomic fire we see that all building up now it will be Burnt Over by nuclear weapons and the whole thing everything destroyed but it's not the it's not the cleaning that the the fire that God is going to give it after the Millennium because we still in time in the Millennium right we all know we're still in time so in then after the Thousand Years then it it comes the Holy Fire which is which is the holy convocation which is God's now doing it totally himself cleaning off the Earth and then after that the new heaven end the new Earth come down and God himself comes down at that point so the the Earth is totally changed but it's the same Earth and then we go into eternity forever and ever and it's not the same at all right you know there very very little there but it's not the same we know you know there's hold it there's no sea there and 70% of the earth now is sea right 70% of bus is water you know it's it's it's going to be no there's going to be no sea at that time right in the new heavens and new earth so just quickly so the rapture we see the body change and then the marriage supper and the bride body redeemed we go into Armageddon three in the three and a half year tribulation and the Earth is purged first time now the second time was we go through goag and Magog first and then Satan is destroyed and in Revelation 20 then there's a great Resurrection that's the second Resurrection we go through to judgment everyone is raised great white own judgment and then we go into the new Heavens then there's the new the purging and then new heavens and the new Earth so and you are these other parts that's draw out of this earth the earth you're a part of the earth your body your soul is part of God and attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the body is to be redeemed so B in future homies focusing now on this part the earth and the body right I'm just giving you the highlights here now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin so God came down by the process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you being part of the earth it's re it's Redeemed by it your your you're you're redeemed with the Earth you're in the process now it's gr on your body was justified under Noah's baptism and your flesh when it dropped I put in here the blood of Jesus upon there and the Earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we know that it was in Noah's days it was it was baptized by water the whole earth in Jesus day the blood went down on it from the cross we were in that blood right we our seed went into that Earth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for Christ and his bride the holy the New Jerusalem so Noah was the water that's done for the earth and the bodies and all and then Jesus the blood that was all done and now this holy convocation the third time the whole thing is just burnt right off right so those are the three things that will redeem the Earth beautiful just as God created the Earth in six days made the Earth in 6,000 years and he said be not ignorant we read in the scriptures 1,000 days 1,000 years is one day and Christ has gone and is preparing a place that's been on its construction for many many thousands of years preparing a place and I go and prepare a place and I will come again and receive you that wherever I am there you may go also notice the Redeemer and the redeemed and we're familiar with that scripture just last couple of quotes here and Christ has gone and is preparing a place the redeemed and redeemed so I went through that one sorry about that I need to watch up there so what God has has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he led us to how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come to the Earth so he's saying this the same for your soul it's the same for your body it's the same for the Earth it's all those three stages of the water water and the the fire and the blood it's all consistent right so here here now you see the the at that point when the new heavens and new earth are gone that the loop of time that fell down is gone right time is over it's ended so it goes back to the Eternal realm there now which and everything has been redeemed soul body representing all the elect and the Earth right and whatever else was in the thoughts of God that was an attribute is all finished so he himself there now is back just in the regular Eternal in realm and uh there's no more time there's no more sin there's no more devil it's all gone everything is gone amen and that is good just finishing up here now in the new Earth and the new Heavens will never be blackened again when the new Earth is to come the devil will be bound Satan he is still loose now he is accuser but in the new Earth he will be bound and cast into the Lake of Fire in his in this Holy Fire heavens and earth will will have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun see and the curse is gone curse is gone forever no more Plan of Redemption is ended it's over so there is a start and there is an end just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts it see you don't accept it it accepts you you always thought the other right see because it's God's attribute see it's the holy ghost means holy spirit and it's the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because you were ordained for the purpose you were in the thoughts of God you was born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on Earth and he comes down and gets you and you're back here here is where you belong see sin has lost its power that's right the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in and you are a restored person never to be go back again to that but now it's here to go through a baptism of fire Holy Holy Fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it then it's purchased so that the redeemed can have can live on it live in live in it in peace notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease germs from sinners from the devil and all of his group we know all them right it is to be cast out into the Lake of Fire but we won't miss him one more
