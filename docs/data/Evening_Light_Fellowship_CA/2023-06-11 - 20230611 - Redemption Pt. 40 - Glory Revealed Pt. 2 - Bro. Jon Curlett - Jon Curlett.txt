that aren't here Lord those that have need of your touch Lord we pray your grace to them each one Lord that you've reveal yourself to them as well we pray Lord just speak to your people now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you if you'll turn your scriptures to John chapter 17. then John chapter 17 is good to be home picked up a bit of a sore throat and cold while I was away but I think it just goes to show I meant to be here not elsewhere I'm a homebody I told my wife it's how I know I wasn't a missionaries because every time I go away I seem to get sick so I'm a homebody I like to stay where I am but it's uh it's good to be home welcome our brother Isaac Whitmire here with us he's going to be spending another week or so with us Lord willing it's good to see him I could see brother Paul and sister Michael back in our midst as well recovering from their pregnancy and good to have him back on the guitar as well from his his flesh wound on his hand as well so we're thankful for that brother Josh that was a wonderful song service this morning and I believe that was the leading of the Lord very good just listening to the different things there and the thoughts that the Lord's put on my heart for this morning I'm thankful for that just uh one prayer request some of you will know my uh one of my uh friends from school Lisa Lynn stockley her mother passed away from cancer yesterday or the day before so they're having a a visitation today and tomorrow so I'm hoping to go see her and and be with the family for a bit but just wanted to bring that need to the family it's uh it's a it's a tough thing I know and so just keep her in prayer I told her we would be praying for her so trusting that the Lord will be with them she's a Salvation Army her and her family so just trusting that they'll find a measure of Grace and comfort where they're at amen and then John chapter 17. and verse 1 says these words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is eternal life that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I have with thee before the world was amen you can have your seats this morning God bless you we're going to continue on this thought of adoption inside of our series on Redemption and I just wanted to quickly thank brother Matt we've got the other screen up and we've got a bigger screen there that I can see so much more easily so it's wonderful to see these things that's really coming together we've got a few things left I know but it's it's just nice to be in a church that works and everything is kind of in its place so thankful for that and I know it's a lot of work we still have the sound booth going in over there and these different things we've got carpet coming in in the next few weeks but just thankful for that I think most of you would have seen the email from brother Mark sharing that our power bill went down by 55 percent I think month over month and some of that's because things got a little bit warmer not much but we're seeing just a big impact just from putting in the the HVAC system here the heat pumps and that so to those listening online I know there's some ministers listening that have that have supported us this is a benefit from from the money that we've received so we're so thankful for that amen so we're going to take a series or continue our series on Redemption and we've been speaking about adoption which is kind of the last portion of redemption because Redemption is bringing you back to your original position and that means adoption is putting you into it he brings you back to it and then he puts you into it and so I want to speak on this thought of Glory revealed just continuing from where we were last service and if you remember last service we spoke about the special robe for the adopted son and it was a robe that was built just for him and today maybe it would be a tailored suit or something like that as a son would come into the family business or come into his purpose in the family he would wear this special jacket this special robe that was given to him and it was specifically for him it wouldn't fit anybody else it wasn't built for anybody else but rather it was fitted to him and we won't go into it so much today but brother Brandon would talk about when Elijah and Elisha in that last scene and Elijah's taken up and that robe came down he says it fit perfectly on Elisha not because the robe was cut for him but he was cut to the robe amen we do not the word is not cut to fit us but we are cut to fit the word amen and so you'll see with this sun what had happened was he'd been trimmed he'd been shaped into what the father had in store for him and then he could wrap him in the robe of the word then he could wrap him in the fullness of his righteousness then he could wrap him in his purpose and his predestinated plan and the son would wear it because he was fitted to the robe amen the robe was already prepared he was waiting for the sun to be ready for those things and this robe was affirmation of what he had done the trials and the testing he had passed it was it was a confirmation of the witness of the of the Tudor of the Holy Spirit we would say and it was also representing what he was going to be because in adoption you are you are coming to the place where you're recognized for what you've done and you're recognized for who you are but it's to take you further into what you're supposed to do now it's taken you into the purpose of the father into the family business into the kingdom of God and it was pointing to the fact that not only were you good and were you affected but you were going to be even more effective and you're going to do more and more for the family and for the good of the family and these different things we talked about how Jesus had done most of his signs and wonders before he ever came to adoption and we wanted to remind ourselves that just because we're in a journey to adoption doesn't mean that God can't use us and God doesn't use us he absolutely does as he teaches you as you learn as you grow as you pass the test of this life then God can trust you in those areas and so he'll bless you with gifts he'll bless you with opportunity he'll bless you with people that can come in and he'll use you for those things but he's taking you to a place where there's a greater work and there's a final work that he's calling you to but after his Transfiguration Mount Transfiguration experience what did he do he started focusing now remember Elijah and Moses came and they talked to him about what was going to happen next and in the adoption ceremony is not just recognition but it's telling you here's your job now here's what you're supposed to do and Jesus focused after that was to get to Jerusalem and get into that final role which was Redeemer he had done all the signs and wonders and healings and miracles and all of those were wonderful and they proved who he was they proved who he was the training of the child proves who he was because he's got the DNA of the father inside of him he's got the DNA of the Overcomer inside of him he's got the DNA of the business owner inside of him he's got the DNA of the one that is successful and that training was to prove who he was and that's what Christ was doing he was proving he was the son of God he was proving he was the second Adam he was proving he had dominion over all these things but if all he did was signs and wonders we'd will we'd still be lost today if all he did was walk on water if all he did was cast out demons if all he did was heal the sick then we would still be lost today because the prophets did that men and women of God did those things in the past but that did not solve the issue brother Branham would say this he said all of his teaching he brought the word he was the word all of his teaching all of his works all of his miracles died with him if he didn't raise from the dead there had to be something Beyond works there had to be something Beyond just a life he had to give his life to restore us back amen the reason we can live today without guilt without fear without shame without these things in our life is because he died and the price was paid and then he sent back an overcoming life to us that would look past all those things that would take us practice Fallen flesh that would take us past our memories and our minds and our opinions and it would bring us into a Walk of Life where we could live in Victory we could live in peace we could live and rest we could live in the life of God Amen it was a life that would transform us from death into life he proved it because he died and he rose again and the scripture says if the same life that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body right here today right now and it'll make you do the things that Christ did it'll give you the life it'll give you the signs and wonders it'll give you overcoming power it'll give you the mind of Christ it'll give you a heart to serve God and do the things that he has for you to do in this life brother Brandon would say this if he never performs any more Miracle on you but the great miracle and forgives your sin that's the greatest miracle that God ever performed was to forgive a human being it's sin take a man and convert him from the things that's changed his innermost being from the things that he once drank and gambled and done evil and things like that and all of a sudden he said it turns him right around to what to love God is love the defining future of God is love not this wishy-washy love but it's a love that's for our good he says it turns him right back to love and he goes home to his wife and says honey I'm sorry that I treated you like that picks up his ill children hold him in his arms daddy spent all of his money for whiskey and Daddy has done this I'll never do it again God forgive me he says how that testimony that's one of the greatest things there is all the alcoholics anonymous and all like that can never change like that did they can never do it for the person I believe in signs and wonders I've seen signs and wonders I've been a part of signs and wonders I've had signs and wonders in my life and my family's life and these different things but those things follow the believer they do not lead the way so often what I'm finding is being preached is that it's saying to do the Greater Works and the life isn't There Yet brother Brad I'm saying the greatest Miracle he does is he changes you from what you were what you are today to what you were before the foundation of the world he takes you back into the mind and the thoughts and attributes of God and he changes you into that and you walk in it willingly and there's no strife and there's no stress on the inner man because it's connected with God now and it's starting to grow out and the word is starting to come forth into your life amen you know when your life has been changed I say it so many times you know you know what your innermost thoughts are you know what your desires are you know where your head's at you know what your internal reaction is we only get to see the outside but you know when the Inner Man the inner woman has been changed and that's when you know you've passed from death into life is you see that you are not what you used to be you may not be what you're going to be but you're not what you used to be and that's what we can take rest in is that he's changing us from Glory into Glory line upon lie and word upon word don't get bogged down in the fact you're not there get get lifted up in the fact that you're not where you used to be that something has changed and you're walking and you've come from death into life amen what is it we sing that song it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life amen it's an outward expression of an inward work Brother Brad would say this when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God that means victory that means healing that means overcoming power that means your tongue is under control that means that your emotions don't Define how you respond to situations something is taken over and this thing that used to control us now no longer has control he says hallelujah he that's born of God did not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8 1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking or if I could just look you'll stop looking at that website or if I could just get away from these friends or if I could stop this and that all this temper if I could get away he says you don't have to do that but getting Christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's not more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creation in Christ he says in your body becoming subject to the spirit tries to live a right kind of life and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being not just your body your whole being your five outer senses your five inner senses your mind your thoughts your opinions your words everything gets tied in it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened and made alive and when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it quickly turns to it quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again why because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly that's why the scripture says you are now in Heavenly places in Christ because you have been turned into a Heavenly realm you've been turned into a Heavenly creature you're caught in time but you're a Heavenly creature we are supernatural creatures having a natural experience he says now he says that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture let me encourage you this morning the reason you're going in the resurrection is because he's already started it in you that's why you're going is because he who started a work and you will be faithful to complete it that he's done a work he started a work and he doesn't start anything that he's not going to finish because why he's God he can't change his mind he can't start and not finish he can't say it's going to be and then let it not be he's come in and as soon as he starts working your life then he's going to finish these things amen and what did he do he took you to a place where you sat maybe for so long and you couldn't hear the word but then he opened your eyes to see and he opened your ears to hear and he gave you a heart that could receive it and as soon as you did that as soon as he did that in your life now something starts to Quicken and it starts to come up inside of you and once it starts coming up Church there's no way it can die why because he says it's right here it's nothing less than the seed of God the gene of God inside of you coming out what is it you're built for this you're made for this and that means you're going to do it he gave you the earnest the down payment he says that's the the down payment the earnest of the Resurrection The Rapture is the change he started in your life Paul said in Philippians he says being confident of this very thing that we he which had begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Christ Church be confident today be thankful be joyous be happy be at peace be at rest because if what your confidence is in what he has started if you know he started the work then you can be confident he's going to finish it but you've got to be confident he started it you've got to be confident he started not that you sit in church not that you hear the preaching of the word but that the word has come in and been quickened inside of you he's filled you with the Holy Spirit that's what you're confident in you've got to know that you've got the holy spirit because that is your typos that is your anchor your anchor is not God's son of prophet your anchor is God sent a prophet to me behold I send you Elijah and he has come to you and the Holy Spirit has spoken to the church and you've received the word you've you've done what Acts 2 38 says and that has made the word come alive in you not that you've heard it but it has made you live now and it's changed who you are from what you used to be how by the very life that was in him the eternal life that he laid down on the cross it's come back that life left that body and that body could die but that life could never die that Natural Body could go into the grave but that Life of Christ went into a theophany body when he died that life had to go somewhere and then and it was one it was a theophany like he had at the beginning and then what did he do he went down into hell and he preached to souls that are in prison and then he went down he took the keys of death and Hell In The Grave and then on the third day he rose again in that theophany merged with this flesh and it glorified that body and he came back and he started talking to us again brother I would say this he said this when a man is Born Again from heaven you've got an origin church you've got a place that you're coming from and if you have a place you're coming from then your Redemption is taking you back to that place origin is Destiny the prophet of God would say you've got to realize that you're going back to something that this is not your starting place this is just the middle of the journey he says when he a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there's a natural body a theophany that's your natural state church is in a theophany that's where you are when the sons of God shouted for Joy was in a theophany that's your real man that's the real woman that's the real child of God is in a theophan or brother Braham says that's your natural place so that means this is unnatural to us it's got to feel unnatural if it's feeling uncomfortable today that's good because guess what if you're a child of hell if you're a child of Satan this feels really normal he says there's a natural body a theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body so you take a theophany and you put it in perfect you put it in sinless flesh and it makes a glorified body your theophonic body drops into a fleshly body but it's not like this body but it is flesh you can still eat and it can drink and when you put those two together you're glorified when your Heavenly Body merges with a flesh body you become a glorified body that's what he's saying he says that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison he says he turned back into that theophany that's what he did now we're going to go back to our opening scripture to dig into this a little bit more today that's just setting a foundation for it so we go to John 17 and this is Jesus and he's in the Garden of Gethsemane remember it says in these words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee remember Jesus has already had his adoption ceremony he's already had a glorification experience or taste on Mount Transfiguration but now he's stepping into a different glorification now he's stepping into a different level now he's stepping into a higher plane and he says its purpose is to glorify the father not to glorify me our glorification is not for ourself it's to glorify the one that gives us his glory he says as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him you know the scripture brother Brown would say that we give eternal life to people we don't give eternal life to them he says what you do is you give them the opportunity you give them the word you give them your life you give them your testimony he says that's where the eternal life comes from that's how you impart eternal life is you give somebody the word and they accept it you didn't give it to them but you gave them the means to it the word is life amen the word is life and that's what we're giving to him but what Jesus is saying you gave me Power Over All Flesh to impart it he says and this is life eternal this is what he gave that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent he says I have glorified thee on the Earth so there's a glorification that happens down here and if he did it then we've got to do it and if he had it then we have it he says but but what I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do the work of an adopted son is to finish the work there's a work that's laid out after that ceremony and adopted Sons finished the work that they were given can you say this morning you may not be done it I don't believe any of us have done it but have you started your work is there something that he's asked you to do is there a place that he's asked you to be and are you stepping into that role into your adopted son role can you say God I'm not done but I'm started I'm started I'm doing what you asked me to do I'm doing it to the best that I know how let us at least be saying Lord we've started the work you've given us and then he says and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I have with thee before the world was what a request glorify me with thine own self what was it what was he saying he was taking it back to his origin he says before the world began there was a glory I had with you and that's what I'm looking for what is it it's a revelation of where he came from it's a revelation of who he was not just who he is what was he saying take me back he said take me back to my original place with you listen he was God incarnate he was God in flesh and Jesus was tired he was weary he was worn they said you're not a man of 50 Years yet but he looked 50 and he was 33. it was tough on Christ to be in that flesh body sinless though it was he was surrounded by unbelief he was surrounded by sin he was surrounded by Temptation and he's saying here God don't leave me here don't leave me in this condition take me back to my original place we've got to pray the same thing Church God don't leave me here even under the blood even with no condemnation this is a miserable place to be amen God take me back to where I was before the world began take me back to my position in you I know I've got a work to do here but when that's done Lord don't leave me here take me back to that place of perfect rest that perfect love that joy unspeakable amen he says I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee now I want to stop here real quickly because just touch on it for the second he says I have manifested thy name in other words he says I have revealed the very self of God that's what that means I personally have revealed you what a thing to say Church and he was the firstborn of many Brethren that we're going to reveal the very self-same God we're not just talking about Jesus we're talking about you and I because we're in him we're like him we're supposed to be like him we're supposed to be reflecting the things he went through amen it's critical That Glory that we understand this idea that glorification is God revealed in US that's what glorification is it's God stepping down into flesh it's God stepping down into this Earthly creature and manifesting himself showing himself that's the glorification of God and Jesus is saying listen I've proven you to be alive I've proven you to be well and we've got to be able to say the same thing he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is still the same amen again we're not going to spend too much time on this but the sun always takes the name of the father in God's line and we'll talk about how John didn't take his father's name and we'll see God Jesus gave Simon Peter a name change and these different things why to call them into a new line of duty to call them into a place that God had called for them amen but the son is always the reflection of the father there's no one else in there it's just the father it's his DNA it's the same thing and so if it's the same DNA then how can you be anything but but the same as your father you can't do it that's why brother Brown would talk about the seed of God the sea Gene of God inside of you how can you be anything less than God if that's what's inside of you you can't but that's what we're growing into amen but Jesus is looking back a long ways and he's looking back past time he's looking all the way back to Eternity and he's looking back to the very beginning of things to the very start of these things because Jesus was a lot of things before this here's a lot of things he was Melchizedek he was a pillar of fire he was a pillar of cloud he was a burning bush he was the angel of the Lord he was all these things but he's saying take me all the way back to the very beginning we have to remember though that he's got to fulfill every purpose before he can go back and you and I have to do the same thing we're being restored back but there's a work for us to do down here and we're going to talk about that a little bit but we see in Revelation that he was a very particular thing in Revelation 13 8 it says and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Jesus is saying take me back but as God is folding him back up to his origin he's got to go through that manifestation because he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so before he can go back to what he was at the very beginning he's got to go through that land manifestation he's got to go through that that sacrifice he's got to go through that laying down of his life he's got to be the slain lamb before he can go back to his great original position he's got to fulfill it all before he can go back to his origin brother Brown would say this he says now God gave himself birth to this son he didn't say he gave birth to himself he said he gave himself birth to his son as in something came out of him it says which was before there was even heir to make an atom see Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we have before the foundation of the world see way back Yonder in Saint John 1 he said in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being so he's pointing back to the beginning unfolding himself all the way down to humanity and then he rolls himself all the way back up to God again so he's revealing himself he's unfolding himself he's showing himself he's letting us know who and what he is and then the idea is to roll it all back up into one in Christ at the very end of these things what was it he rolled it right back up to the Ascension of Jesus and then that body went up and he went to sit on the right hand of the Throne of God Amen that's the same thing that he's doing with us brother Brown says there was a time that you knew that you knew what who you were what you were he says but your mind is darkened to that now there's only been one man on Earth that knew that he was before and that was Jesus notice he didn't say knew who he was before he says he knew that he was before knew that he had a pre-existence knew that there was something before he came into this Consciousness before he drew a breath of life here what's he saying there's a pre-existence and if you were before you weren't just somewhere or something but you were someone right you were you were a an attribute you were an expression you were a nature you were something before you ever came here he says and he said glorify me Father which the glory that I have with you before the foundation of the world he says he was the Incarnate God he could move back there and know what it was but our minds are blackened there we've got to go through something here to restore our minds back so that we understand who and what we were in the beginning amen we have to go through a transformation and what's it doing it's giving us eyes to see more and more remember the scripture says we see through a glass Darkly but then we'll see him and will be known as he is we'll have a body like his and these different things and it's giving us ears to hear the word and it's starting to bring back the mind of Christ because the mind of Christ knew who he was before he ever came into this existence the mind of Christ in you will get you to understand who and what you were before the existence that you have today as well it's the same thing we've got to be able to realize just like Christ did we come from God and we are going back to God and that's the path we're on today we're not going to this end of this life we're going back to God Amen and whether we go in Rapture whether we go in Resurrection however it works what is it we're restored back to our original position in Christ amen our minds can't really grasp that that's why it's got to be a revelation we can't stop and think we can't grasp this idea that we come from something but yet we've got to grasp it there's got to be a revelation of who and what we are and that there was something before this and it's just a little bit every day it's a little step every day you step into that word a little bit more you believe it a little bit more and you start to recognize things and how do you recognize it because the word starts to happen in your life and so if a little bit will happen then you know that the rest will happen as well and it starts to build your faith up build your faith up and pretty soon you have rapturing faith I say soon through this life you build up to rapturing Faith because the word has been made flesh and you over and over and over again like I said before I believe that last step will be the easiest one it'll just be like that Lord I'm coming home amen we're ordained to be Overcomers here we're ordained to be Victors here we're ordained to go through the things we're doing amen but it's a finished work in God's eyes but we're creatures of time and so we've got to go through this trial process we've got to go through this this time of of proving who we are and what we are and letting us see what it is so that will recognize our place and recognize our family line but there's still a glory that's given to us here amen as Christ had a glory even before his adoption and there was a glory after his adoption we have it as well and it's been a revealing of God in his bride for over two thousand years but it was shown in the first church age with the apostles and the first you know the the day of Pentecost and these different things and then it went down into a valley and then it's coming up to this last stage and it's Omega Alpha's Omega and he's what he's revealing himself once more and so there's a glory that's being revealed in each every one of us and what does it do he gives us the Holy Spirit first to help us to believe the word than to act on the word so that we will live the word and when we live the word we become the word that's it it's a simple process it's a simple process you know I was thinking about this the other day Satan doesn't have to get his children to feed they feed very naturally on the things of this world on the mess and the filth and everything out there they feed very naturally and he's trying to cram that down our throats but the thing is as Sons and Daughters of God we ought to be able to feed just as effortlessly on the word of God that ought to be something that satisfies us in a way that nothing else can that ought to be something that draws us to it that there's our Natural Instinct our nature is to feed on the good things of God amen you can't express God and flesh if you're feeding on something else can't do it you can't do it brother Bram says this he says the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy listen to this that Spirit of honesty I'll tell you what church I need a spirit of honesty so that I can say Lord I'm not where I ought to be because that's the starting point remember we've spoken that this is the Zeal of this age is to repent and to repent means to say that I'm not where the word says I ought to be a spirit of Honesty will help us to look in the mirror of the word and say that's not me yet I believe I'm the word but Lord there's a work to be done and that Spirit Will Keep Us true to the word and it'll keep us coming back and checking up in our lives day in and day out amen it'll keep us in Fellowship it'll keep us with our brothers and sisters that can give us that honest feedback that'll help us to see when we're maybe turning a bit to the right or to the left a spirit of honesty the spirit of trueness in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went to logos which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit in all that I'm going to I'm going to explain this just in a second but I want to set the foundation scripturally here he says in John 4 it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so what brother Brown I'm saying here I'll go back is he's saying in the beginning that God the Father the great Elohim the self-existing one he says he wasn't even God then because there was nobody to worship him because God is an object of worship he says he had these thoughts and he had these ideas and those ideas were what we call the word the word is the thoughts of God the word is the intentions of God the word is the will of God and and he says that word is the expression of God in thought form but then he says the word was spoken it was expressed within God he doesn't even say it was spoken it was expressed within God he says and then that life of God went out and it became the logos and the logos is just the form the shape the image of the thought it's a body it's a vessel if we could put it that way not a physical body like we have but it's a vessel for God to be in that's the logos that's the life of God coming out and forming this image or this vessel and then God stepped into that form and brother Abraham says that form now was the word of God expressed and he says that was Christ God is a spirit you'll never see God except in the expressed form of Christ and so what he was saying was he said God gave himself birth God brought something out that life out of himself and created a form Christ steps into it and now that is God incarnate in a body in a shell in a vessel if you want to talk about it that way it was visible it was light it could be seen you can see that in Genesis 1 it was a light it was it could be seen and it could be interacted with but not in the way we interact now it was a Celestial body it was a Heavenly Body it can be seen and we can recognize that it's there but it does not touch us or interact with us it would go through us if you tried to shake the pillar Fire's hand you would feel nothing in and of yourself there's no form to touch but yet it is the image of God it is the expressed image of God in these things it's like the burning bush experience with Moses that was the image of God in a burning bush and the bush burned but it was not consumed why because it was not interacting physically with the burn to cause it to burn it wasn't interacting with oxygen and these different things it was itself just sitting in that bush and it made it look like it was on fire it was theophonic it was a theophany body just hiding itself in that bush if we could put it that way brother Brown says this he says like someone was speaking the other day he said God what was he when he was back Yonder millions and millions of years ago you say we don't believe in that the Earth is millions and millions of years old all I can tell you is that brother Brown says that God was there millions and millions of years ago and whatever thing looked like through that time we don't know but listen to this he says and then he gathered up into the logos and then he came from the logos down into Christ Christ the flesh body he says and then he got down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth and then going right back into God again God unfolding himself and then God rolling himself back up don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the logos from the logos there into man then returning right back again for one purpose to redeem that man that had fallen now that's what he came for to be a redeemer that's why I say if he came down and he did signs and wonders and the prophet said did signs and wonders and he he did all his Doctrine and He restored the word but he didn't raise again then he missed out because he had to redeem us and Redemption requires blood he says now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and before God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law a Kinsmen Redeemer he had to be Kim folks to us now we listen to that we say whoo that is wonderful that is amazing look at that revelation of God to see him in the plan and the manifestation of God but church you've got to see the purpose and you've got to see your place in all of that amen let's not just see the revealing of God through Christ we've got to see the revealing of God through us as well notice he said he had to be kin folks to us and we look and we say yes he became Kim Folks by becoming flesh but he had to be Kinfolk with us in the beginning to be Kim folk with us back here we had to be Kinfolk to him in the beginning so he could come down and become folk to us now amen we were kin folk with him because we were in Christ before the foundation of the world then we dropped into flesh and so he had to drop in the flesh to redeem us down here to bring us back to our Kinfolk relationship up there as well he's Kinfolk here because we were Kim folk back there he doesn't just magically become our kin down here but he was always our Kinsmen Redeemer he was always us amen we were always in him if he was then so were we if he is now then so are we and if he is going to be in the future so are we because we are kin with him we're tied to him we're a part of him in these things it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all the way back to the beginning and going all the way into eternity amen our glory is in our origin that's why we shouted them in the beginning we're in glory we were glorified we were with him we were in full and open relationship we were in Perfection that's where our glorious so our goal has to be to get back to there and not try and do something here he says that's the very way we go so I said don't forget that you're a part of this we go Plumb back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not a flesh born again not of blood but Born Again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty it comes down to make its place in us here and now and then when we die from this life we go into the body he says which if this Earthly Tabernacles dissolve we have a theophany to go into a body Celestial that at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up from the Earth again and made in a glorified State what is it it's full of quickening power it's full of eternal life it's on hinder by anything it's without sin it's perfect we are made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever now brother Brown goes in to explain this in the message called who is this Melchizedek he says you came like Adam like me you became from the attribute so you came the ACT you were the thought of God the attribute of God you became the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go he says that is the word not just the word says it but that is the word we go back to being the word then when we go back we can look back and see what we did now we don't understand it you don't have to understand it all you can't you can't understand eternity we don't we're not built for that in the in the sense right now he says we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word he says because Christ became the word and then the word was made flesh he says we dropped we skipped the word and came straight to flesh because of sin and so now we've got to be built back into the word he says but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning I've said this many times brother Brown's idea on predestination was very traditional very denominational if I could put it he said God knew what you would do and therefore he predestinated you but now after the seals opens up he comes back and he says no no no you are in the thoughts of God you're in the mind of God you are an attribute of God you are a part of God and because of that you will have eternal life you are eternal life you're part of God in these different things he says that proves the predestination of God see so he says predestination but look it is changing now he grew in his Revelation Church we're allowed to grow we don't have just put our foot down and say this is what I believe and that's it no we grow in Grace and Truth Christ did it we'll grow in Grace and Truth as well he says you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first now remember God never changes his mind that means if he thought you in the beginning you're going to make it if you're in his mind if you're in his thoughts if you're in his attributes then that has to be expressed because he's coming back to roll it back up again all the way back to him but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand he says all the father had given me will come to me and I will raise him up in the last days see he says you had to be first you had to exist first you had to have a pre-existence you had to be somewhere else before you came here to go back to where you were the the children of this world the children of Satan a child of hell has no origin they're just here that's the effect of serpency that's the effect of of seed being sown in the field by an evil man they have nothing to go back to and so they go to destruction except for those that are granted eternal life based on what they do for the bride based on whether or not they make a free will decision to accept the finished work of Calvary they'll never get the Holy Ghost they can't because the Holy Ghost is eternal life and you can't get it unless you already had it but we preach it to all because we don't know who's in and we don't know who's out he says you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute to flesh before the foundation of the world his names put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear and disappear that's what brother Brown says when we go back we'll be able to travel like a thought we can move from here to there because what we're in perfect form we're the word again he says and then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then at this Earthly Tabernacles the dissolve we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look he says when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God and we read the rest of that quote a little earlier now remember in John 17 Jesus was praying In The Garden of Gethsemane and he was saying God take me back to where I was originally don't let me go through all of this and then leave me hanging take me back to where I was I've got a work to do but I've got to go back to my eternal glory My Cry is to go back to what I have with you in the beginning that's where I belong we sing that song in your presence that's where I belong I'm kind of homesick for a country Christ was singing his Beulah Land here he was saying take me back to where I had that complete and open Fellowship without any of this mess around me that's why you need a prayer Life Church to get away from the mess to get tied in to fall in love with the presence of God to fall in love with Christ where everything else disappears and you can have that communion that draws you in and once you get it you'll never ever enjoy the taste of anything else once you get it that Sweet Hour of Prayer when you learn what it means to have a Sweet Hour of Prayer to know that he's there to know that he's talking to you you don't ever want to go back you don't want to take anybody's word for it you want to take somebody's opinion for it you want to go back in his presence that's what Christ was saying what are we crying for today brother Brahm says he says there's one sign he says of the Holy Ghost he says and if there's sign and crying for the Abominations that are done in this world does it grieve us to be here does it Vex us to be here does it like you know not like lot who's whose righteous Soul was vexed but he wouldn't leave it but does it Vex Us in the way of vexed Abraham so that he stayed out of it completely that he wouldn't go into these things amen I I when I every time I travel because I get to work from home so often and I work with a pretty good group of people and I don't get to be out but boy when you're going out and you're sitting on airplanes and you're walking through airports and you're sitting in restaurants and Church where he Grieves me when I see what passes for clothing today it Grieves me what passes for politics it Grieves me what passes for entertainment it Grieves me what passes for sanity today and the more and it doesn't take long two and a half days out in the world and it ought to make it very obvious this world is not my home I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger here there is zero draw for me here in this world if this is what the good life looks like kill me now it's not there people are striving and they're pushing and they're pressing into Insanity they're feeding on it they're gobbling it up because it's in their nature to do it and yet we've got to keep a right attitude towards them all because we don't know who is and isn't a child of God it out of Vex our righteous soul but not in a way that would tell us keep us away from being a witness keep us from being a testimony keep a keep us away from giving an expression of what Christ has done in our life we've got to be able to walk in it not lose our patience not lose our peace not lose our rest but to have a heart that's open towards people that we could tell them about a Christ that's changed our lives amen I want to get out of here I believe like Jesus Lord restore me back to where I'm supposed to be don't leave me down here don't let me just work down here and give of myself here and then leave me hanging but Lord take me back there's a cry for something that's greater than what I have right here but if there's a cry to have a greater relationship Lord there's got to be what a relationship developing here it can't all wait for over their Church there's an invisible Union that's happening with Christ and the bride that means there has to be moments of intimacy with just you and him where it's just you and Christ Alone in that room and you know that he's there and you know that he's working in your life amen Romans 8 23 says and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit or the first fruits of the spirit love joy peace patience kindness goodness what all these different things he says even we ourselves grow within ourselves brother John you say that you're going to be groaning even though you have the Holy Spirit that's what will happen when you get the holy spirit is you will start to groan we sing that song thou Mighty Christ come forth in me my will my way I yield to thee the barren sing the travailing song why because pretty soon it won't be long because what there's something coming forth out of us Paul says you get that Spirit there's a groaning inside of us to get out of here to get back to what we are to get back to Who We Are he says we groan within ourselves he says waiting for the adoption because there's an adoption but there's a fullness of that adoption and the fullness of the adoption is when you've completed your work and you go back to him you and him become one he says waiting for the adoption he says to wit the Redemption of our body full Redemption is when we get a body change we're redeemed and we're given the Holy Spirit as an Earnest as a representation of what's going to happen we get a taste of it here we get a shadow of it here I don't doubt it for a moment even in adoption like I said before this is just me I believe it'll be a quick short work because with this world with social media and these different things you got manifested Sons and Daughters of God walking around doing the things that they will do and they are doing when you get that in any sort of scale the world will see it at some point you won't be able to hide it you couldn't walk up and heal somebody in front of a temple or a gate or on the sidewalk without somebody videoing it in all probability or catching it on a closed circuit TV camera or something like that you can't do it but coming up to that there's something that's got to happen and that victory has to be over what this because in order for this to redeemed be redeemed it has to die completely die completely the biggest problem I've got today is Jonathan curlett the flesh that's the biggest thing I've got because it's on redeemed sinful body fights against my soul and the nature of God within me and so there's got to be a groaning that says get me out of this get me out of this battle get me out of this fight get me out of this pest house get me into that original rest amen what am I praying I'm praying Christ's prayer glorify me with the glory I had before the foundation of the world where I was right there with you and there was nothing in between you know I have a choice as to what gets between me and God you've got a choice as to what gets between you and God Church don't let it don't lay it on Satan sin say always he's done that we have a choice for everything we do in life everything we have if we let something get between us and God it's our choice God didn't put it there and Satan can't force it in there nothing can get between me and my wife unless I let it and nothing can get between me and Christ because we're in the same relationship unless I let it it's my choice whether it's work whether it's finances whether it's entertainment whether it's friendships relation whatever it might be whatever I get into if I let it get between him and me it's my choice so we can't go blaming it on somebody else we have a choice in those things so if we are surrounded by a mess let's clear out the mess that's our choice it's our choice it's our choice young people it's our choice what we have around us what am I praying for I'm praying Lord let me surrender let me die out let me give this up take me out of myself and take me back into you but Brian would say and now God in his great picture drama that we have under consideration this afternoon he brings in three Earthly Witnesses Peter James and John them from Heaven he brings three Heavenly witnesses to see what he's going to do he says oh I love to see Jehovah moving out to display his power and his grace oh it's so beautiful when you see him in his great power before he does it he will set on the sideline something some people some Believers to watch him display his great omnipotence did you know that we're spectators in the working of God in our lives because we know in ourselves there's no good thing we know that we can't do it and so we're literally Watching God do a miracle in our lives where I am today is a miracle compared to where I used to be and I believe the miracle is going to keep working until he takes me into Glory until he takes me into eternity he says God puts a witness there and you've got to be witness that something's going on he says and I notice him now as he brings from Heaven to watch The Scene Three Jesus Moses and Elijah he brings from the earth Peter James and John if I'm going to confirm this in the earth I'm going to confirm it in heaven also it's got to be a witness here on Earth and it's got to be a witness also in heaven notice now as he comes and then this had another meaning to it I know many of you my brethren you apply that to the coming of Christ he says that's right it was applied there the order excuse me of the coming of Christ now catch this it says as they looked they saw glorify Jesus we're talking about Glory revealed so the first thing they saw was glorify Jesus adoption is about glorification and we're seeing Christ glorified right there he says this is the order of the coming so if the coming of Christ looks the same as that then we've got to see a glory revealed in Christ in the second coming it's got to happen so it's only Christ though then he says and then they locked again and they saw Moses and Elijah the two witnesses revelation 11. what is it it's God going back to the Jews and the tribulation then they look back and seen Jesus only and this is the fully visible coming of Christ with his bride he says exactly the order the coming glorified Christ of preaching to the Jews and then Jesus coming with his bride exactly now catch this because he says there they saw a glorified Jesus first then they saw Moses and Elijah then they saw glorified Christ again so there's a glorified Christ that has to come he never touches foot on the earth in the second coming church he doesn't touch so how is he being revealed in flesh and you and me you and I are going to be the glorified Jesus Christ for this day not going to be we are and not everyone recognizes it and sometimes we don't even recognize it quite where we're at but we are the first glorification of his coming then he goes to the Jew or to the Gentiles and he's revealed in two witnesses and he seals 144 000 and then he comes back and it says then his glorified Christ again he says it's Jesus only the third time but scripture says he comes with Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand of his Saints but it's Jesus only it's full unification it's perfect Unity now it's Christ and his bride are one and brother Branham I don't have the quote here we'll we'll maybe share it later he says it's full Unity perfect Unity Christ and his bride have become one so all they see is Jesus but it's in a multi-member body the second time but the glorification of Christ is in us today listen to this Ephesians 1 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that means we can ask him to glorify us this way church if he wrote this about us and we can say Lord restore us to that that's what Christ did Christ recognize his place in his position and he said restore me back to that so we can look at this in Ephesians 1 4 and say Lord take us back to this Lord take us back to being holy and Without Blame in love you can ask him to make you holy you can ask him to put the love of God in your life because he's already promised that that's where you were having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of what his grace this is a Grace work glorification this is not works that any man should boast but this is Grace coming through us to glorify us to bring us into the statue of perfect men and women in Christ wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved remember Psalms 102 16 says this when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory now brother Branham would say that in scripture Mount Zion is always the bride if you've ever noticed that Jerusalem is the city and that's the Jews but Mount Zion is inside Jerusalem we're a special Mountain inside of the Bride if I could put it that way we are the bride the Bride is a special group inside of the body inside of the original portion of Christ so he says when he shall build up Zion what when you're built up into the stature of a perfect child of God in Christ that's when he's going to appear in his glory because the Capstone coming down is the perfect glorification that's the finished work that's what makes us glorified is when the finished work is there when you're a mature believer and the Capstone comes down and it's the uniting sign of the end time is when Christ comes down and he caps off his bride and there's perfect unity and then we have that quick short work and then off we go that's when we see his full Glory Paul was or Peter would say this he says ye also as Lively stones are built up remember he says when he would build up Zion Peter says you are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ and then in Colossians Paul comes and says even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest made to appear to be revealed to be made alive to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles what is the mystery what is the glory of God it is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you is what produces the glorification it says whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus the glorification of God is in a perfectly unified word bride that's the only thing that we glory in that Gloria has shown it is when the word is made flesh that's what glorification is the word made flesh just like it was in Christ I want to quote this I quoted it I think last service of the service before but I want to read it again be put because it puts us in our proper place and it puts our focus in the right place and it helps us to understand where we are and it helps us to push out pride and Seth will and all these things when we see God's intentions for us brother I'm saying wait a minute Jesus said in Saint John 13 35 by this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other the spirit revealed truth of the kingdom of God to come looking out to the end Yonder seeing what the prophets cried about see what Jesus spoke about and say hear the same Holy Spirit in you crying right back is something crying and you write back today that's right that's right what is it it's spiritual reveal truth I love my brothers regardless of where they go to church whether they're former or latter or no rain at all as long as they're in the body of Christ trying to achieve he says not something for a certain purpose to manifest yourself on Earth but the purpose for the kingdom of God and the glory of his coming to reveal and make known his soon appearing you're at church we're it the only Christ they're going to see is in you and I and that's a glory that he's given us to be revealed in this last age and it hasn't been seen since 2000 years ago it's it's on our shoulders it's a robe that he's put on us it's that code of adoption that he's put on us is the glorification of our bodies with the word for the hour I'm not here to make a name for myself I'm not here to build up some reputation but I'm here to reveal Christ and that ought to be our everyday purpose get up in the morning and say Lord let somebody see you and me we sing that song Let the beauty of Jesus be seen to me that ought to be our prayer it ought to be our hearts cry every morning what are we here to prove I'm here to prove that you can be filthy you can be lost you can be depressed you can be completely obsessed with the things of this world and then God can step into your life and turn you into a son or daughter of God that's what I'm here to prove I'm not here to prove I'm anything I'm here to prove that he's alive and well today in me and he can do the same thing in you amen I'm here to show that there's a remedy there's a cleansing there's a cleaning there's a changing power of God that's available to the people of this age that's what I'm here to prove we're here to let people know that God is real we're here to let people know God has thoughts and he doesn't just have preferences but he has good and he has evil that he has a word for this age we're here to let them know that God has outstretched arms and he's calling his people to him today that he's not a god of judgment yet that we're under grace that we're under a mercy seat that there's blood to cover these things we hear people to show people their sanity simple sanity the common sense of the Gospel we're here to show them people wonder it's a testimony to us how our families turn out the way they do you know how they do it it's the grace of God in us that gives us children that gives us families that can stay and hold on to the word of God even before they get the Holy Ghost they can be raised in a way that stands out even amongst professing Christians all over the world what is it it's the Hope Christ the hope of glory in US that's where all the credit goes Church but it's proof of something that's happened inside of us it's proof of a life that's there amen we're here to show you don't have to live for the weekend that you can live every day with purpose I was seeing something yesterday where a woman that was an atheist said there is no purpose to life and all I could think is well why are you alive then if there is no purpose then why would you keep yourself alive why would you do the things you do and she's an author and a writer and if if there is no purpose why would you express yourself in any way why would you put effort into it why would you stress yourself why would you do things that cause you discomfort if it wasn't for purpose and she can't answer that question because she's living with purpose what she doesn't realize is she's a child of hell and everything she does reflects that she's going to hell unfortunately unless God steps into her life and all she's doing is reflecting where she came from we've got a purpose is to reflect where we came from and maybe get somebody else to see hey I resonate more with that than where I'm at right now and it's the seed of God inside of them quickening amen brother Brahm says where are they at show me where they're at God calling his children aside by manifestation not just what you believe not just what you say by manifestation he says they don't have to say one word about it you see that Something's Happened I'm gonna have some musicians to come I want to ask you something this morning you've been struggling lately feeling overwhelmed feeling like you can't get ahead feeling like it's just I'm not a swimmer and so I feel overwhelmed when I'm in the water you know and I'm thrashing and I'm thrashing and I'm doing this and that and I'm hilarious to watch in the water because I don't swim very well and what I'm trying to do is survive and you ever see somebody that enjoys the water they're so relaxed they just lay there just to they don't have to move if I don't move I die in the water but sometimes we're in this life and it feels like we're thrashing and nothing's happening and all we can say is if I don't stop thrashing around I'm gonna die and we find that there's there's things that are so overwhelming and we get a bit ahead and then the next wave hits and we drop behind and pretty soon you feel like you're drowning and it's just thing on top of thing on top of thing we know God never promised a Bed of Roses he never promised us a life of ease but he did promise he'd never leave us or forsake us amen you want to know how to move forward do you want to know how to save your family do you want to know how to save your marriage do you want to know how to save your sanity do you want to know how to save and preserve the walk that you have with God do you want to get through it with your patients intact with your testimony intact I've got a couple quotes for you this morning God wanted to bless his children and he couldn't do it under the law neither could he under judgment and justice do you want a blessing this morning listen to this but the only way he could do it was under the love of his son Christ Jesus watch this love he said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him what is it all the laws finished all the judgments are finished this is my beloved Son hear him all those other things are done this is him today we want to hear everything else but him you want to hear rock and roll you say brother John I don't listen to rock and roll go take your music and crank it up to 10. and walk away that'll let you know if it's rock and roll or not I've been going through my music lately because what I've found is of so many of my songs I like they start good and they end bad but Church they don't end in rock and roll if they don't start in rock and roll and you hear something and sometimes it takes your children listening to it till you sit down you say what are they listening to and you realize that it's something that you've listened to you say I don't listen to rock and roll brother Branham said that end time Church of this age was walking to the beat of rock and roll the beat of rock and roll he didn't say she was it was rock and roll he says to the beat of rock and roll and what you'll find is they have worked it in especially over the last 10 years they have worked rock and roll right into Christian music and it is so tough to find something that doesn't devolve into drums clashing banging screaming guitars and all these different things there's a song says I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship it's all about you and we've replaced him with heavy metal this and clashing this and banging that and jumping up and down and everything and where's Christ gone he says you want to listen to rock and roll you want to hear all these other things but you don't want to hear him that's what God Said hear ye him and I say to this group of people in this Arena tonight hear ye him I'm giving you a way out Church I'm showing you the way out and he said except a man be born again he will in no wise enter into the kingdom hear ye him he's the great physician he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed hear ye him if the doctor says you got a Cancer and you're going to die the man's honest that's all he knows about it all his medical Sciences prove that it cannot be cured they haven't got nothing to cure it with but hear ye him he said I'm the Lord who heals all your diseases if you're guilty and you've sinned and you've trespassed against God's Commandments and you don't know what to do it the Bible said hear ye him he took all our iniquity he took all our trespasses away here ye him Christ fulfilled everything under the law and now he comes under grace and God speaks from heaven and he says hear him that's where Grace is that's where life is that's where Deliverance is that's where healing is that's where preservation is it's where all of these things are that you're looking for and all you have to do is hear him all you have to do is hear him the only way you're going to get out of this is if you hear him you can't blend you can't blend and get out you've got to take him or nothing Psalms 107 says he sent his word that's why the hearing of the word is so critical that's why the reading of the word is so critical he sent his word and he healed them I would say brother Bram says that first healing is what your sin sick soul that's the first healing everything else comes after that he healed them and he delivered them from their destructions we've got lots of destructive ways about a Stoneway Church we've got inclinations from our our family DNA we've got inclinations in this body we've got it in our minds and these different things he says he sent his word and he delivered you out of your destructions get into the word hear Christ I think we're looking for so much and we're forgetting that it comes so simply so simply Church so simply remember what he said in Revelation 3. he said what hear what the spirit saith to the churches that's how you overcome that's how you get out of that age that's how you get out of that destruction that's how you get out of that judgment is here what the spirit says to the churches what church age are you in where are you at what is your message and are you feeding on that message and that message alone because remember what did he say to the Legacy in church age he says you are lukewarm he said you're not hot and you're not cold and I wish you were hot or I wish you were cold but you're lukewarm how do you get lukewarm water Church you blend it you blend it you blend the word you blend your music you blend your friendships you blend your influence and you try and Pull It in and that's what gets you lukewarm it's not that you don't have some hot it's not that you don't have hot it's not that you don't have the the burning fire of the word in your life but you're what you're deluding it I say you were we delude it by adding in things that aren't anything to do with the word we delude it by listening to those that aren't saying what the spirit said to this age you delude it by sitting still do you want to get lukewarm water when this came up this morning it was cold you know what it is now lukewarm why it sat too far away from its source of cold you want hot water you got to keep it on you got to keep it on the fire don't you you got to keep it on the on the oven you got to keep it where there's heat you got to keep it where there's warmth you got to keep it where there's fire if you let it sit still where there is no fire where there is no Refrigeration it'll come to a room temperature and that's lukewarm and almost nobody likes lukewarm water except preachers that are trying to keep their throats from closing up I know nobody likes lukewarm who likes lukewarm food go to a restaurant you want your lukewarm food how do you get there you let it sit too long you're not eating as it comes you turn away and say no that's not for me today my brother John's preaching no we'll leave that for another day it'll be lukewarming do you no good you got to eat it now you got to eat it today you got to be in the word you got to be in the presence today don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today amen stop blending the word of God with your feelings stop blending it with your opinions start blending it with your emotions stop blending it with the things that are not spoken by the spirit of this age that includes your inner voice let's stand together as we read this last one it says people come up and say I got the Holy Ghost too look the way they live notice this doesn't say they don't live holy he says they don't last from one Revival to another from one meeting to another it's made manifest that they haven't got it if a man is born of the spirit of God or a woman they have the fruits of the spirit they walk Godly they live that life it's not legalism it's not legalism remember legalism it's this we're talking about the life of God doing it legalistically means doing it because the word says and there's nothing in you that actually makes you want to do it that's what legalism is is obedience without the life inside you and that's a starting place simple obedience is what God is looking for but you can't stay in simple obedience there's got to be a life that comes behind it he says watch what they do they live that life a legalist has to be told to do it has to be forced to do it has to remind themselves to do it and somebody that's got the life will generally and naturally come to it on their own because there's a life in them that feeds on those things he says see how do they live that life they keep away from the things of the world God moves in them and makes himself manifest and proves that he's God working in there the other one is impersonating man let's close our eyes Heavenly Father Lord we want to choose life Lord you've given us life Lord but we've got to let it express itself Lord we want to be your glory Lord we want to be manifested Sons and Daughters of God Lord would you help us Lord to take inventory this morning of anything that hinders us Lord of anything that dilutes you that makes our experience lukewarm Lord that holds us back Lord and we sit there and we wonder why are we this way Lord help us to take inventory and say I know Lord let our lives be Sanctified so that we see the spots so easily Lord and keep it clean Lord would you grant us Grace each one Heavenly Father we want to reflect you Lord our hearts desires that people would see Jesus in me Lord that people would see Jesus in every member of this congregation Lord those online as well Lord

that you've given us the Holy Spirit Lord for those that are doubting Lord may you just Lord settle it in their hearts today Lord for those that need it Lord May there be a cry that doesn't settle Lord that doesn't come Lord that doesn't go easily into the night until they've met that place Lord where they've met you and they know that it's a finished work in their life Lord we pray for our children Lord our precious young people Lord thrown into the midst Lord we get to stay away from it so easily Lord but they're thrown into the midst of it Lord and we know that Satan's going around as a lion Thor seeking whom he may devour Lord give them sane Minds give them Clear Eyes Lord let them separate themselves quickly and easily from every influence Lord let them trust Lord the work that you've started you're going to complete we pray Lord God we ask your grace this morning nor for me in order to pulp it all the way to those in the back from the oldest to the youngest Lord we pray your grace would be revealed Lord by Your glory in US Lord help us to be humble Lord help us to be quick to hear quick to obey we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you know I went away and I left on Wednesday morning and when I went on Wednesday morning I looked at my lawn and there were maybe 30 or 40 dandelions and I said I've got time I can stop this I came back three days later and I had a thousand what are you saying Brother John settle it today clean it today get delivered today make a confession today let him do a work in your life today before the battle gets harder I spend more time yesterday trying to clean that lawn up it had grown some of my grass was a foot and a half some of the weeds were two feet tall I had to go through and I had to weed eat everything in the wet and then I had to mow everything in the wet my mower wouldn't do it I had to cut it down just to get the mower to the place where it could do a bad job because it would just clog up and die constantly I should have done it before I left that's going to take me days and with the weather here it may take me a week or two to get that lawn looking the way it's supposed to why because I didn't do it when I ought to have done it doesn't mean it won't be perfect just means I'm gonna have to fight that much harder to get it to where it ought to be that's what I'm talking about this morning amen is Glory being revealed we've got choices to make we've got decisions to make them don't put it off don't say I'm good there's only 30 dandelions tomorrow there'll be a hundred the day after 300 the day after a thousand that's how quickly it multiplies amen start feeding on the word and watch that multiply start cleaning out your life and let that what make room for more of God and trust him and then trust him that he'll put the satisfaction there that he'll put the right Desires in there that he'll start to use you for these things amen I sing that song did we sing already I was born to be a dwelling place today I don't think we did I was born to be a Dwelling Place 742 brother weichel I was born Born to Be a dwell ing place a home for the presence of the Lord so let my life now be consecrated

Lord to thee that I might be what I was born to be do we know that song all I want to see is Jesus believe it created me a clean heart 150 but Josh I'm going to turn it over to you here amen you know David wrote these words [Music] David was the son of God Dave was a child of God David was an anointed Son of God they came to a place yet where he said Lord I need a clean heart there are things that are weighing on me there are things that are holding me back you got a wrong Spirit on him maybe you got cynical maybe you got stressed out I imagine he did run him for his life for as long as he did he got to a place where being in the presence he couldn't even maybe get there things were holding him back they said renew restore to me the joy of my salvation he says Lord It's not that I'm not saved I said I'm not enjoying my salvation I'm not enjoying my walk I'm not enjoying my relationship he said Lord restore that I know I'm sealed I know I saved I know I'm good in your sight but there's something missing today that I used to have and Lord I want to have that I got off the road a little bit here a little bit there Lord I don't know where I got off perhaps but I know I'm not where I used to be that I'm not enjoying the presence I'm not enjoying the word I'm not seeking after those things maybe in the way and Lord I want to go back lord I want to go back to where I was will you take me there and if you read later God took him back God doesn't God doesn't put the the thought of restoration without making a way to restore amen amen you're seeking more there's more to be had if you had something you can have it again amen if there's something you're there Desiring from God that means there's something of God to be had but you got to cry out you gotta sigh and cry you've got a groan Paul said for what God has in store for you scripture says the Harvest is white he says and there's only a few laborers he says pray that he'll send laborers that he'll send laborers to you let you be a laborer in it pray that he'll make you a laborer pray that he'll make you a part of the work not just have you standing on the sidelines all the time bring you back to a place of service bring you back to a place of rest bring you back to a place of Peace bring you back to a place where you can enjoy your devotions where you can enjoy the presence of the Lord and the

know that I'm right in your size it's not wrong to say Lord I don't feel it if you're not feeling it say Lord I don't feel it I need to feel it but greater than feel it Lord I Need to Know It I've got to have a settled Assurance in my life so sing this as a prayer sing this as a prayer if you've lost something sing it as a prayer cry out to God don't just sing a cry out to God this is your chance this is your opportunity to say Lord I know that I've lost something or Lord I know I haven't moved sometimes that's a promise we just haven't moved we've stayed and we've gotten stale and we've gotten lukewarm say Lord Kindle the fire again make it burn hot and let it be obvious to me the work that you're doing in my life and then we'll sing this as brother Joshua come [Music] create in me
