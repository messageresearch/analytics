[39:46] value heavenly father
[39:48] and lord you've called us to that place

[39:51] you you've called us to your side as
[39:53] your bride heavenly father and lord

[40:07] battle that lies ahead amen for we
[40:10] remember the many prayer requests lord
[40:11] those that aren't here today lord we
[40:14] pray your grace and mercy to each one
[40:15] heavenly father you know the needs of
[40:17] each heart
[40:18] though may you just discern them tonight
[40:19] through the going forth of the word lord
[40:21] speak into the lives of each person
[40:23] that's gathered here and listening to us
[40:25] we pray in jesus christ's name we ask
[40:27] and pray
[40:28] amen
[40:29] amen god bless you thank you musicians
[40:32] if you would turn the scriptures to
[40:34] psalms chapter 63
[40:36] psalm 63 amen god bless you this evening
[40:38] it's good to be back in service
[40:41] and i've got a lot on my
[40:43] i got a lot on the fork tonight this is
[40:45] something i've been sitting on for two
[40:46] months
[40:47] amen and just felt that this was the
[40:49] time to bring it amen so psalm 63
[40:52] trusting that god will bless you this
[40:54] evening
[40:55] minister to your heart's need
[40:58] psalm 63 in verse 1 says o god
[41:01] thou art my god
[41:03] early will i seek thee
[41:04] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[41:07] longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[41:09] land where no water is to see thy power
[41:12] and thy glory so as i have seen thee in
[41:15] the sanctuary
[41:16] because thy loving kindness is better
[41:18] than life and my lips will praise me i
[41:21] want to look back at verse 2 there
[41:22] quickly he says to see thy power and thy
[41:24] glory so as i have seen in the sanctuary
[41:28] what was he asking for he was asking for
[41:29] god to be the same in his life as he was
[41:32] in the church that the feelings he had
[41:34] that the anointing that he had that the
[41:36] presence that he felt in church that the
[41:38] things that he had seen god do would be
[41:40] the same in his day-to-day life as what
[41:42] he had in church amen
[41:44] because thy loving kindness is better
[41:46] than life my lips shall praise thee
[41:49] thus will i bless thee while i live i
[41:52] will lift up my hands in thy name my
[41:54] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[41:57] and fatness and my mouth shall praise
[41:59] thee with joyful lips
[42:01] when i remember thee upon my bed and
[42:04] meditate on thee in the night watches
[42:07] because thou hast been my help therefore
[42:09] in the shadow of thy wings will i
[42:11] rejoice
[42:12] my soul followeth hard after thee thy
[42:15] right hand upholdeth me but those that
[42:17] seek my soul to destroy it shall go into
[42:19] the lower parts of the earth they shall
[42:22] fall by the sword they shall be a
[42:23] portion for foxes but the king shall
[42:26] rejoice in god every one that sweareth
[42:29] by him shall glory but the mouth of them
[42:31] that speak lies shall be stopped amen
[42:34] god bless you you may have your seats
[42:36] this evening amen i read this scripture
[42:38] when we uh spoke on thirst and that was
[42:41] two months ago amen it's hard to believe
[42:43] that but it was two months when i when i
[42:45] spoke on that service on knowing where
[42:46] to go to satisfy your thirst and we we
[42:49] read a portion of this scripture there
[42:50] and it was just on my heart to stay with
[42:52] it and so i want to i want to preach on
[42:54] that this evening but we spoke of david
[42:56] there where he
[42:58] he had a close enough relationship with
[42:59] god that he knew where to go when he had
[43:01] a need and when he had a thirst amen he
[43:03] knew where to get the satisfaction the
[43:05] joy the strength the encouragement as he
[43:07] sought to keep from being killed for
[43:09] over 10 or 15 years amen this was not a
[43:11] life of ease for david despite the the
[43:14] king anointing but he had a place of
[43:16] refuge he had a place of strength amen
[43:18] and so tonight i want to take a title of
[43:21] my god amen my god and we read there
[43:23] that he said oh god thou art my god my
[43:26] question tonight is can you say that
[43:27] same thing oh god thou art my god amen
[43:31] we see david writing here in psalm 63
[43:33] and this is well into david's life amen
[43:35] this is not something that david wrote
[43:37] when he was 14 years old perhaps you
[43:39] know watching the sheep but david has
[43:41] come to the place where god is very
[43:43] personal to him amen he has come to the
[43:45] place where he's no longer just jehovah
[43:47] god but he has become my god amen that
[43:50] he has identified a reality of god that
[43:52] is outside of the church that is outside
[43:54] of the sanctuary that is outside of the
[43:56] prophet's message that is outside of
[43:58] what he's seen in other people's lives
[43:59] but he's seen a reality of god that
[44:02] allows him to call him now my god that
[44:04] he's identified with him that god has
[44:06] revealed himself in a way that makes him
[44:08] personal to david amen and david didn't
[44:10] come to this place of relationship david
[44:12] didn't come to this place of revelation
[44:14] just by sitting in church i mean this is
[44:16] not something that just comes by by
[44:18] sitting into wonderful sermons and
[44:20] hearing anointed ministry and and
[44:21] singing anointed songs and these things
[44:23] it's not just coming by nodding your
[44:25] head to what's coming over the pulpit or
[44:27] or what you might hear or or as you read
[44:29] your bible amen but there was plenty of
[44:31] others that were doing those things in
[44:32] those days that we're still going to to
[44:34] the tabernacle that we're still going to
[44:36] to the synagogue in in these different
[44:38] things and hearing the priests read the
[44:40] scrolls and whatnot and nodding their
[44:41] heads and saying amen
[44:43] but david out of all of those was picked
[44:45] by god amen amen i want you to
[44:47] understand that it's something to be
[44:49] picked by god it's something to be
[44:50] chosen by god to be drawn into a
[44:53] relationship with him and brother
[44:54] branham would say in so many messages he
[44:56] says if god is calling you give in right
[44:59] away right don't fight it don't resist
[45:01] it when god is pulling you when you feel
[45:03] conviction when you feel god's saying
[45:05] there's more for you then don't resist
[45:07] it amen but to come to it and david we
[45:09] know didn't have much of a choice when
[45:11] it came to his anointing because a
[45:12] prophet came his way picked him out of a
[45:14] crowd and poured oil over his head and
[45:16] said you'll be the next king of israel.
[45:19] so david had an anointing regardless but
[45:21] the point is that god chose david david
[45:23] did not choose god necessarily amen god
[45:26] pulled him out and he said i have a plan
[45:28] and i have a purpose and he told them
[45:30] what the plan and the purpose was but
[45:32] you know what he didn't tell him he
[45:33] didn't tell him how he was going to get
[45:34] there
[45:35] and so he had to trust that he was
[45:37] anointed for that purpose he had to
[45:38] trust that god was in the plan but he
[45:40] had to now walk through the plan without
[45:42] any foresight as to what was going to
[45:44] happen the next day he had no idea when
[45:46] the plan of god was going to be fully
[45:47] manifested in his life but he had to
[45:50] have a closeness that would keep him
[45:51] going when it didn't look like that was
[45:53] never going to come at all amen
[45:55] i want to ask you the same question is
[45:58] that do you know you've been called out
[46:01] and then do you know that you've been
[46:02] called for a purpose do you know that
[46:04] you don't just sit in this church
[46:05] because you're raised in the message
[46:07] family but god has called you personally
[46:09] to serve him and it's with purpose and
[46:11] it's worth a plan amen each one of us
[46:13] has to realize that we don't just come
[46:14] to church because we believe a message i
[46:17] mean that's great and that's good but
[46:18] the the rich young ruler had that
[46:20] experience
[46:21] amen but when he calls you out it's for
[46:23] a purpose and it's because he wants to
[46:25] be real to you it's because he wants to
[46:27] have a relationship to you it's because
[46:29] he wants to take a place in your life
[46:31] that nobody else has amen and maybe
[46:33] you've got things maybe you've got
[46:34] habits maybe you've got relationships
[46:36] maybe you've got ideas and things that
[46:38] are holding you there but he wants you
[46:39] to set those aside so that he can be
[46:41] real to you in a way that he's never
[46:42] been before amen
[46:44] but we see today and you can see it in
[46:46] the ranks of of certainly nominal
[46:47] christianity you can see within the
[46:49] ranks of the message if you've traveled
[46:50] at all and even within our own circle
[46:52] here and that there are three types of
[46:54] believers in every congregation amen and
[46:56] you have the real believer you have the
[46:59] misbeliever or the fake believer if you
[47:01] will and then you have the rank sinner
[47:03] amen you have the unbeliever that's
[47:04] there and we have those that profess
[47:06] christ and their lives are no different
[47:08] than they were before they came and then
[47:10] they walked through the church door and
[47:11] all they became was somebody that nods
[47:12] their head to the word but their life
[47:13] didn't change that's not a believer
[47:16] that's somebody that's just associated
[47:17] with the truth potentially amen amen but
[47:20] if you have a heart to serve god which
[47:22] david did then there's something special
[47:24] in you that's calling out for something
[47:25] that's available to you because god
[47:27] won't put a call in there if there's not
[47:29] something to satisfy that call amen amen
[47:31] amen but out of all of these people out
[47:34] of all of these types of believers we've
[47:35] been called out to do one thing and what
[47:37] is that if you look in revelation
[47:39] chapter three there's only one thing
[47:40] we're told to do and that's to overcome
[47:42] and then we're called to be an overcomer
[47:44] we're called to overcome the trials and
[47:46] the tribulations and the traps and these
[47:48] different things that are set for our
[47:50] day we're called to come out of her my
[47:51] people and in that coming out to him we
[47:54] have overcoming power amen but if we
[47:56] stay where we're at we're never going to
[47:58] have anything
[48:00] but brother branham would say this
[48:01] to the believers to those that are
[48:03] called out he says don't try to
[48:05] impersonate that's what's the matter
[48:07] with pentecost today now pentecost
[48:09] remember was where the truth was until
[48:11] he came
[48:12] so i want to say today where you say
[48:14] pentecost i would say put the message
[48:16] say that's what's wrong with the message
[48:18] today if you want to look at it because
[48:20] i'm hearing more and more ministers talk
[48:22] about the messages if it's a group
[48:24] the message is not a group it's an
[48:26] individual amen it is christ himself
[48:28] revealed in your life personally so
[48:30] there's no such thing as message culture
[48:32] there's only god and you amen but
[48:34] they're talking about it in a way that's
[48:36] drawing us into paths that i worry about
[48:38] sometimes the way they talk about the
[48:40] way they approach things is as if we're
[48:42] one big group and guess what we're not
[48:44] one big group amen it is individuals
[48:46] walking with god alone that will unite
[48:48] together under one thing and that is the
[48:50] baptism of the holy spirit in their life
[48:52] and that is the only thing that's going
[48:54] to keep you amen but he says that's
[48:55] what's the matter with pentecost today
[48:57] that's what's the matter with the church
[48:58] today there's too many trying to
[49:00] impersonate that they've got the holy
[49:02] ghost
[49:03] there's too many trying to impersonate
[49:05] divine healing there's too many trying
[49:07] to impersonate different things of the
[49:08] lord you can't do that those things come
[49:11] by election and god calling you're
[49:13] dropped from your mother's womb with
[49:14] that gifts and callings are without
[49:15] repentance he's talking to ministers
[49:17] primarily there and those with gifts of
[49:19] the spirit and whatnot he says oh my
[49:21] that's true you can't make yourself
[49:23] something you're not
[49:25] but if god calls you be the most
[49:28] thankful person in the world
[49:30] because he has called you then it
[49:32] becomes real to you so it's the calling
[49:35] of god that is a separating factor amen
[49:37] right many are called but few are chosen
[49:40] and that's really what we're looking at
[49:41] is those that are chosen not that heard
[49:44] the call but those had a call on them in
[49:46] the first place to receive what was
[49:48] coming forth amen this is why i spent 18
[49:51] services talking about conduct
[49:53] right it's so that you would understand
[49:55] that this is not just about nodding your
[49:56] head amen but it is about a life lived
[49:59] it's about living voices not just
[50:00] speaking voices amen it's so that you
[50:02] can get established and grounded in the
[50:04] living word that will change your life
[50:06] in a way that you've never had before
[50:08] it's about the reality of god inside of
[50:10] your life amen so that god can what
[50:12] develop you to the point where he can
[50:13] trust you and use you just like he did
[50:15] those in the book of acts
[50:18] in first john 2 it says i write unto you
[50:20] fathers because you have known him that
[50:22] is from the beginning
[50:24] that means to recognize god by intimate
[50:26] relationship
[50:28] i write unto you young men
[50:30] so fathers the fathers would be the
[50:32] older ones amongst us then he says i
[50:34] write unto you young men because you
[50:36] have overcome the wicked one you've
[50:38] conquered you've prevailed you've gotten
[50:39] victory over satan by a reality of god
[50:42] and then he says i write unto you little
[50:44] children because you have known the
[50:46] father so we're all covered in the
[50:47] scripture
[50:48] every one of us is covered in here amen
[50:50] god has revealed himself to you that's
[50:52] what he says you've known the father god
[50:54] has revealed himself to you even you
[50:55] little children he says those that are
[50:57] young in the faith he says god has still
[50:59] revealed himself to you
[51:01] i have written unto you fathers because
[51:02] you have known him that is from the
[51:04] beginning i've written unto you young
[51:06] men because ye are strong and the word
[51:09] of god abideth in you
[51:11] and you have overcome the wicked one
[51:14] love not the world neither the things
[51:15] that are in the world if any man love
[51:17] the world the love of the father is not
[51:19] in him
[51:20] for all that is in the world the lust of
[51:23] the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride
[51:25] of life is not of the father but is of
[51:27] the world and the world passes the way
[51:30] in the luster of but he that doeth the
[51:33] will of god abideth forever
[51:36] i want you to catch that there that
[51:37] obedience being found worthy of trust to
[51:40] do god's will takes us all the way to
[51:42] knowing eternal life
[51:44] obedience is what takes us there amen
[51:46] the son that does what the father asked
[51:48] is the one that truly loved him remember
[51:50] when they talked when jesus was telling
[51:52] the parable he says the father goes to
[51:54] the sons and he says do this and one of
[51:55] them says yes i will and the other one
[51:56] says no i won't. but he says afterward
[51:58] one of them is conscious being pricked
[52:00] he goes and he does what the father
[52:02] asked and then the other one that said
[52:03] yes doesn't do it at all he said which
[52:05] one loves the father
[52:07] and they said the one that did what he
[52:09] asked but he was disobedient at first
[52:11] but he came to himself and he went and
[52:13] he did what the father asked amen that's
[52:14] what jesus is saying here you can nod
[52:16] your head all day long but unless you go
[52:19] do what the word tells you to do then
[52:21] guess what
[52:22] there's no love in you amen right and
[52:24] that won't take you to our eternal life
[52:26] is just not in your head amen what is it
[52:28] it's letting god come in through the
[52:31] door of our life and change our life
[52:33] change our decisions change our way of
[52:35] doing things so that he can use us amen
[52:37] so that we'll do what he says and he can
[52:39] trust us in that place
[52:41] amen so we have to find ourselves in the
[52:43] position of the overcomer and the
[52:44] overcomer always gets there first
[52:46] through obedience and then god's got to
[52:48] know he can trust you so what will he do
[52:50] he'll give you the word as you read your
[52:52] bible as you listen to messages as you
[52:54] come to church he'll give you the word
[52:55] and then he'll say are you going to do
[52:57] it
[52:59] and it's a simple question isn't it yes
[53:01] or no yes i'll do it not yes but not in
[53:04] my head but yes i'll apply it in my life
[53:06] yes i'll take what was said and i'll let
[53:08] it have preeminence in my life and then
[53:10] he says that's a son i can trust that's
[53:12] a daughter i can trust because when i
[53:14] speak he obeys when i speak she does
[53:16] what i told her to do
[53:18] it's very simple
[53:20] right it's not difficult when he says
[53:21] move we move when he says obey we obey
[53:24] amen
[53:26] but to overcome is to do what is to keep
[53:28] the life of christ in you through every
[53:30] trial through every tribulation through
[53:32] every difficulty and come out on the
[53:33] other side stronger and better in him
[53:36] than you were before you went in
[53:37] remember brother brown talks about that
[53:39] log that was rotted on the inside but
[53:40] looked good on the outside he says it to
[53:42] overcome is to keep life within you so
[53:44] that everything is solid so that
[53:46] everything is strong not just the
[53:47] outside looking good amen the outside
[53:49] nods
[53:50] the inside has to be strong by obedience
[53:52] it's the only way because that's what's
[53:53] taking in the nutrients isn't it
[53:55] amen we see it in the life of david as
[53:57] to what brought him to the place where
[53:58] he could call god my god amen and what
[54:01] was it it wasn't a a life of cuddles and
[54:04] kisses and pats on the back and david
[54:06] you're an awesome man no god chose him
[54:09] god said i've chosen you and that
[54:10] settled it and then god started
[54:11] preparing him amen god wasn't coming
[54:13] along every day pat and david saying hey
[54:15] good job buddy good job keep going keep
[54:17] going that's not the way god worked god
[54:19] anointed him and then god put him
[54:21] through the trials to make sure that
[54:22] that anointing would have the right
[54:23] effect on him amen because saul had the
[54:25] same anointing didn't he as soon as
[54:27] david got the anointing it left saul so
[54:29] there was no difference in the anointing
[54:31] what was the difference the vessel it's
[54:33] the only difference
[54:34] amen
[54:36] so david's path to a reality of god was
[54:38] not one of these
[54:39] and it was it didn't start with glamour
[54:41] david was a shepherd david was a
[54:44] shepherd and then he got anointed and
[54:45] then he went right back to being a
[54:47] shepherd he didn't become some big thing
[54:48] amen but as soon as he was anointed
[54:51] things change in the life of david and
[54:53] then i'll say it to us today if you've
[54:54] got the holy ghost when you get the holy
[54:56] ghost your life will never be the same
[54:58] it cannot be the same as what it was and
[55:00] it will never be the same moving forward
[55:02] you don't stagnate you don't stay the
[55:03] same but god is constantly moving
[55:05] constantly moving constantly pulling
[55:07] constantly drawing constantly pushing
[55:09] you out and bringing himself in amen and
[55:12] the difference is will you go easy or
[55:13] will you go hard
[55:15] amen
[55:16] amen what is it it's an anointing in us
[55:18] that is calling us out of those things
[55:20] amen and here's the thing god never
[55:22] gives us his anointing so that we'll
[55:24] stand still
[55:26] as in it puts us into action is what i
[55:28] mean we've got to stand still many times
[55:30] scripture tells us having done all the
[55:31] stand stand amen you guard your position
[55:34] you guard your land you guard what god
[55:36] has given you amen but when it comes
[55:37] we're moving because we move as he is in
[55:39] the life amen so the holy spirit will
[55:41] continue moving us with god every single
[55:44] day the overcomers anointing is not
[55:46] stagnant it does not hold us in a place
[55:48] but it moves us with the word of god
[55:50] amen and with david we see this because
[55:52] there comes a day where david's sitting
[55:54] and he's enjoying being with the sheep
[55:56] and he maybe he's writing psalm 23.
[55:59] amen he's writing psalm 23 and then what
[56:01] happens is a bear comes out
[56:03] and all of a sudden something sweeps
[56:05] over david that's a little different
[56:07] than the last time amen because he looks
[56:10] and he says guess what i'm anointed to
[56:12] do something
[56:14] and the first king anointing is always
[56:15] to protect
[56:17] amen it is to take care of those that
[56:18] are weaker than you it is not to put
[56:20] dominance over them but it is to serve
[56:22] them by protecting them so david sees
[56:24] this bear come out and before i don't
[56:25] know what david would have done maybe he
[56:27] would have tried to get him away with
[56:28] the sling maybe he would have done
[56:30] whatever he could and not being able to
[56:31] he would have just went and told his dad
[56:33] dad i couldn't get it i couldn't get the
[56:34] lamb away from him i couldn't get the
[56:36] sheep away from him but after he's
[56:37] anointed something special happens and
[56:40] david says what that's my sheep
[56:43] and there's an anointing that sweeps
[56:45] over him and he goes and he beats on
[56:47] that bear until it lets go of the sheep
[56:49] now most of us would say good enough
[56:51] right got the sheep let's go
[56:54] but what happens is the bear turns on
[56:56] david after that
[56:57] so now it's not about the sheep now it's
[56:59] about david amen having protected his
[57:01] sheep now the bear wants a piece of him
[57:03] and most of us would say run
[57:05] it's the first thing we do run get out
[57:07] of the way you've done your job get out
[57:08] of the way now he wants you but guess
[57:10] what that anointing is still on david
[57:12] and what does he have he has a voice and
[57:14] size that fear is not i'm with you amen
[57:17] and then something rises up in david and
[57:19] says listen this is just an escalation
[57:22] but i'm still with you the same way i
[57:23] was when you beat him off of the lamb
[57:25] amen and what does david do david walks
[57:27] up and he grabs him by the beard and he
[57:29] kills him
[57:31] that's the difference between an
[57:32] anointed david and an unanointed david
[57:34] is that he'll grab a bear look it in the
[57:36] eyes and he'll kill it while looking
[57:38] into its eyes listen i don't want to be
[57:40] anywhere near a bear with anything less
[57:42] than a than a 270
[57:44] rifle amen and i want to be up a tree
[57:46] where he can't reach me
[57:48] but yet david would walk up with whoever
[57:50] knows what he had i assume he had a
[57:51] knife or something and just grab them
[57:53] put it in and say that's it bud you're
[57:55] done
[57:58] what is it
[57:59] there's a moment there where david had
[58:01] to
[58:02] not just be saying amen to what was
[58:04] happening in the service but he had to
[58:06] say amen to what i am with you always
[58:08] amen
[58:09] what was it the
[58:11] you got to remember that in that time
[58:12] what did they worship they worshiped the
[58:14] god of abraham they worshiped the god of
[58:16] isaac and the god of jacob and you know
[58:17] what happened in that story he became
[58:19] the god of david amen so david wasn't
[58:21] just looking back at a prophet's
[58:23] ministry david wasn't just looking back
[58:25] at what joshua had done in these
[58:27] different things but david now
[58:28] experienced an anointing on him that
[58:30] allowed him to identify god now with his
[58:32] life and his purpose amen amen and then
[58:35] after the bear what happens
[58:37] we go up another tier don't we we go to
[58:39] a lion and the lion comes out and grabs
[58:41] the sheep and david does the same thing
[58:43] goes in beats the lion off of the sheep
[58:45] and the lion turns us turns around and
[58:47] says all right i want you now and david
[58:49] does the same thing listen he says if
[58:50] he's with me with the bear he's with me
[58:52] with the lion as well and he grabs that
[58:54] line and he does the same thing the
[58:55] bible says he grabs him by the mane and
[58:57] he kills him face to face right here
[59:01] look i wouldn't even want to try a man
[59:03] that close and he goes after a lion what
[59:05] is it there's an anointing on him that
[59:06] says that you're just fine you're where
[59:08] you're supposed to be david you're in
[59:10] obedience you've got an anointing on you
[59:11] to protect and you can do whatever it
[59:13] takes to protect what god's put in your
[59:15] in your hands
[59:17] brother brown says this he says every
[59:19] man or woman in here that's a christian
[59:21] knows that something's been on you all
[59:23] your life
[59:25] now you weren't always aware of it
[59:28] yeah obviously we weren't because if we
[59:30] were aware of it we would have lived
[59:32] quite differently wouldn't we especially
[59:33] those that aren't raised in the message
[59:35] amen but there was something always
[59:37] there when you were a child he says you
[59:39] longed to serve god something beat at
[59:41] your heart it was god's election
[59:43] david before anything ever happened
[59:45] before he'd ever had the anointing oil
[59:47] on him in anything he knew god was with
[59:49] him he killed a bear he killed a lion
[59:51] with that slingshot and he know that was
[59:53] super to an ordinary man to do that he
[59:56] knew what he could do and he knew that
[59:58] god was with him why because he killed a
[1:00:00] lion and a bear
[1:00:02] no it says he knew god was with him
[1:00:04] because his whole heart beat after god
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] that's an amazing thing people seek
[1:00:12] signs and wonders as confirmation of god
[1:00:15] being with them
[1:00:16] listen signs and wonders are available
[1:00:18] to anyone with faith
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:21] but brother braham says that he knew god
[1:00:23] was with him because his whole heart
[1:00:26] beat after god that's an amazing thing
[1:00:29] that we can take away here amen is that
[1:00:31] if your whole heart beats after god you
[1:00:33] know he's with you because that's the
[1:00:34] only way you can ever have something
[1:00:35] like that
[1:00:36] he said in the 47th psalm i believe her
[1:00:39] somewhere there as a heart penteth after
[1:00:41] the water brooks so my soul thirsts
[1:00:43] after thee oh god he says no wonder he
[1:00:46] could play the evil spirits away with
[1:00:48] his music he had something to play about
[1:00:52] you'll notice when people sing specials
[1:00:54] the ones that have an experience about
[1:00:55] what they're singing about sing the best
[1:00:58] specials don't they not the best voices
[1:01:00] necessarily not the best music but
[1:01:02] they're singing about an experience and
[1:01:04] that experience does what it projects
[1:01:06] faith through the song that they're
[1:01:08] singing and it has effect on the hearer
[1:01:10] right he had something to play about and
[1:01:13] it come from his heart the devil knew
[1:01:15] that was from his heart and he knew that
[1:01:17] david was elected of god amen so david
[1:01:20] knew the reality of god he knew the
[1:01:22] power of god he knew the saving grace of
[1:01:24] god he knew the protection of god he
[1:01:26] knew the election of god brother brahm
[1:01:27] says it was even before he was anointed
[1:01:29] king
[1:01:31] that's an amazing thing
[1:01:32] amen but i want you to catch something
[1:01:35] about this relationship and that said
[1:01:37] david never takes credit for anything
[1:01:39] that's happened in his life
[1:01:41] amen what did brother brown say humility
[1:01:43] is power with god
[1:01:44] david never goes and he says yeah i'm
[1:01:46] the world's best slingshot guy i killed
[1:01:49] a lion i killed a bear yeah man it was
[1:01:51] no big deal no
[1:01:53] what does he say the lord delivered me
[1:01:56] out of the paw of the bear and the mouth
[1:01:58] of the lion amen the lord delivered me
[1:02:00] he didn't say yeah i went in there i
[1:02:02] knew i could do it no he said the lord
[1:02:04] delivered me out of it amen i didn't go
[1:02:07] and attack he says the lord delivered me
[1:02:08] out of it i was doing my job i was
[1:02:10] staying in my post of duty and god kept
[1:02:12] me safe basically this was just an
[1:02:14] extension of his duty and he says god
[1:02:16] kept me safe through all of it this
[1:02:17] ain't about me
[1:02:18] you know david wasn't some big guy as
[1:02:20] far as we know
[1:02:22] right he's just a youth a striply a
[1:02:24] young guy
[1:02:25] but yet he kills lions and bears where
[1:02:27] most people would run him and he's not
[1:02:28] about you know superior tactics i did he
[1:02:31] didn't ambush this animal amen he said
[1:02:34] the lord delivered me out of it amen
[1:02:37] let me say this you better give credit
[1:02:39] where credit's due
[1:02:40] amen if you've got something if you've
[1:02:42] got a gift if you've got a ministry if
[1:02:43] you've got a talent whatever it might be
[1:02:46] give the credit to god because without
[1:02:47] him it will have no supernatural eternal
[1:02:50] effect on anybody amen what does the
[1:02:52] scripture say except the lord build the
[1:02:54] house right
[1:02:55] they that labor they that they labor in
[1:02:57] vain that build it amen so if we've
[1:02:59] achieved anything it's because god has
[1:03:01] granted us grace
[1:03:02] and you know what that grace is that
[1:03:04] grace is to get you out of the way so he
[1:03:06] can actually do something amen that's
[1:03:08] what it is in my life amen when when he
[1:03:10] minimizes me the best things happen
[1:03:13] that's what i found in my own life amen
[1:03:15] god has kept me from myself delivered me
[1:03:17] from my own thinking from my own
[1:03:18] thoughts
[1:03:19] right and all of a sudden something can
[1:03:21] happen because i'm not standing in his
[1:03:22] way
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:25] listen to this this is
[1:03:27] this is uh david talking to the
[1:03:29] goliath he says then said david to the
[1:03:31] philistine
[1:03:32] thou cometh to me with a sword and a
[1:03:34] spear and with a shield but i come to
[1:03:36] thee in the name of the lord of hosts
[1:03:38] the god of the armies of israel whom
[1:03:40] thou hast defied this day will the lord
[1:03:43] deliver thee into my hand
[1:03:45] now remember what david said to saul he
[1:03:47] said what he already delivered me from
[1:03:49] the lion and the bear
[1:03:50] and so he looked and he's now up the
[1:03:52] food chain even more he's fighting a
[1:03:54] nine and a half ten foot guy with with
[1:03:56] 250 pounds of armor and weapons on him
[1:03:59] but what does david say
[1:04:01] lion bear goliath same thing
[1:04:04] right the spirit of god will tell you
[1:04:05] that it doesn't matter what's standing
[1:04:07] in front of you if it's in your way and
[1:04:09] you're supposed to be where you're
[1:04:10] standing then it has to go down
[1:04:12] amen and it doesn't matter if it takes a
[1:04:14] second if it takes an hour if it takes a
[1:04:16] week if it takes a year it's got to go
[1:04:18] down amen can i tell you a testimony
[1:04:20] it's not mine but it's a wonderful
[1:04:22] testimony
[1:04:23] a good friend of mine
[1:04:25] shared the story shared a prayer request
[1:04:27] three years ago and his son was having
[1:04:30] marital issues
[1:04:31] he serves the lord he's in the message
[1:04:33] and he was having marital issues and his
[1:04:35] wife got caught up in the joseph branham
[1:04:37] thing
[1:04:38] and she said i'm gonna leave you and go
[1:04:40] and attend that church and sit under his
[1:04:42] ministry whether you like it or not
[1:04:45] his career was in shambles he hated his
[1:04:47] job and now his wife is saying she'll
[1:04:49] leave him if he doesn't go with her so
[1:04:51] what did he do he went with her and he's
[1:04:53] just praying and he's praying and he's
[1:04:55] praying and then he gets fired from his
[1:04:56] job
[1:04:57] so now he's got his wife leading him
[1:04:59] around and he's got no job and he's
[1:05:01] saying you know you think where's god
[1:05:04] amen you know where he is today
[1:05:07] his wife has come back under his
[1:05:08] headship they've gone back to a church
[1:05:10] that believes what we need to believe
[1:05:12] and god gave him a job that he didn't
[1:05:13] apply for
[1:05:15] amen two years it took for that to
[1:05:17] happen
[1:05:18] two years and in the midst of it what do
[1:05:20] you think he's saying do you think he's
[1:05:22] thinking wow god is so real to me right
[1:05:24] now
[1:05:25] but what he had to go through the lion
[1:05:26] sequence he had to go through the bear
[1:05:28] sequence he had to go through the
[1:05:29] goliath sequence to get a reality of god
[1:05:31] amen and i guarantee you the god he
[1:05:33] serves today is far different than the
[1:05:35] god he served three months three years
[1:05:36] ago amen in his life
[1:05:38] god hasn't changed but that man's life i
[1:05:40] i guarantee you has absolutely changed
[1:05:42] because he came to the place where god
[1:05:44] stepped in and out of nothing gave him
[1:05:47] and restored him back something that i
[1:05:48] would say would never have come back
[1:05:49] amen sure you can always get a job amen
[1:05:52] but but when a wife or a woman goes out
[1:05:54] like that under that it's very rare for
[1:05:56] them to ever come back especially under
[1:05:57] you know the issues that they they have
[1:05:59] under i'll call it a cult that's what it
[1:06:01] is amen amen they go in there and
[1:06:03] they're so tied to a man they never come
[1:06:05] out from under it we've got personal
[1:06:06] experience with that in some cases amen
[1:06:09] but what he had to go through a lion
[1:06:11] experience he had to go through a bear
[1:06:12] experience he had to go through things
[1:06:13] that most people would die from their
[1:06:15] relationship with god would die out
[1:06:17] because they'd say lord what are you
[1:06:18] doing you're taking away the very things
[1:06:19] you've given me
[1:06:21] but yet god brings them through it and
[1:06:22] now he's praising the lord and his mom
[1:06:24] and dad are praising the lord they're
[1:06:25] they're old and not not in such great
[1:06:27] health and you know it wears you down
[1:06:29] and you're praying and you're wondering
[1:06:30] and you can't see them because it's
[1:06:31] coveted so he's all on his own
[1:06:33] he's all on his own going through this
[1:06:35] amen just like david with the sheep but
[1:06:37] yet what god brings them through it and
[1:06:39] now he's praising god for his grace and
[1:06:40] goodness to him amen
[1:06:43] what is it
[1:06:45] we've got to recognize that it's just
[1:06:47] one thing after the other and guess what
[1:06:49] brother bob cancer is no different than
[1:06:50] death is it
[1:06:52] right sister priscilla arthritis is no
[1:06:54] different than death blanca gallbladder
[1:06:56] trouble's no different than death amen
[1:06:58] it's just one other thing that we're
[1:06:59] going to step right through amen
[1:07:01] all it is is what god's just growing us
[1:07:03] and moving us towards that great final
[1:07:04] challenge amen what is it we'll just
[1:07:06] step in from one thing to another thing
[1:07:08] to another thing and we just got to
[1:07:10] realize it's no different
[1:07:11] it's the same anointing that's coming
[1:07:13] against us and we've got an overcomer's
[1:07:14] anointing and that means it's got to go
[1:07:16] down every single time david said this
[1:07:18] day will the lord deliver the into mine
[1:07:20] hand and i will smite thee and take
[1:07:22] thine head from thee and i will give the
[1:07:24] carcasses of the host of the philistines
[1:07:25] this day under the fowls of the air and
[1:07:27] to the wild beasts of the earth that all
[1:07:29] the earth may know there is a god in
[1:07:30] israel this was supposed to be single
[1:07:32] combat david says not only am i going to
[1:07:34] kill you but we're going to destroy the
[1:07:35] entire army
[1:07:37] and all this assembly shall know that
[1:07:39] the lord saveth not with sword and spear
[1:07:41] for the battle is the lord's and he will
[1:07:43] give you into our hands listen david
[1:07:46] didn't come here looking for a fight
[1:07:48] david always comes to these trials by
[1:07:50] obedience have you noticed that because
[1:07:52] what his dad pulled him from the sheep
[1:07:53] and said go and take some food and some
[1:07:56] cheeses to their captain and go to your
[1:07:58] brothers and bring them some food and
[1:07:59] see how they're doing
[1:08:01] so david's not going there with some
[1:08:02] some idea of making a big name for
[1:08:04] himself he's not going there to pick a
[1:08:06] fight
[1:08:06] he's not going there with an idea of
[1:08:08] delivering israel he's just going in
[1:08:10] obedience to what his father told him to
[1:08:11] do and then he comes there and all he
[1:08:13] sees is he sees another lion trying to
[1:08:15] take the sheep
[1:08:16] so he says hey same situation i can take
[1:08:18] care of this why because the lord will
[1:08:21] deliver him into my hand no
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:24] what is it
[1:08:25] david's the one standing but he wasn't
[1:08:27] the one having pretensions of overcoming
[1:08:29] he said the lord's going to do this work
[1:08:31] the same way he did the line and the
[1:08:32] same way he did the bear brother brahm
[1:08:34] says it this way he says almighty god
[1:08:37] father god of heavens and earth who was
[1:08:38] with david and david knowing that he
[1:08:41] walked right out with faith lord and
[1:08:43] challenged because he knew that you were
[1:08:45] with him and his position is in you
[1:08:49] was in you amen that's the only reason
[1:08:51] he walked out was because he knew god
[1:08:53] was with him amen
[1:08:55] you have to walk into the battle but
[1:08:57] it's god that's going to do the battle
[1:08:58] for you amen you've got to be willing to
[1:09:00] walk out
[1:09:01] amen and we don't go picking a fight and
[1:09:04] then we don't go picking a fight but
[1:09:05] when he comes on our property that's
[1:09:06] when we say enough's enough and what do
[1:09:08] we do we say the lord is going to
[1:09:09] deliver you into my hand amen
[1:09:12] second samuel 22 says thou art my lamp o
[1:09:15] lord and the lord will might will
[1:09:17] lighten my darkness so god makes things
[1:09:20] plain god shows the way god moves away
[1:09:22] doubt and brings clarity god drives away
[1:09:25] the shadows but he had to experience
[1:09:27] darkness before he could experience the
[1:09:29] god of light
[1:09:30] he says for by thee i have run through a
[1:09:32] troop by my god have i leaped over a
[1:09:35] wall god gives strength for the battle
[1:09:37] protection from her even to the point of
[1:09:39] supernatural events in our lives amen
[1:09:41] but he still had to face a troop and he
[1:09:44] still had to run at the wall
[1:09:46] amen as for god his way is perfect even
[1:09:51] if it means running through a troop and
[1:09:52] over a wall
[1:09:54] the word of the lord is tried he is a
[1:09:56] buckler to all them that trust him
[1:09:59] david's saying what god does all things
[1:10:01] well and he says i've i've experienced
[1:10:04] that god does it right time and time
[1:10:06] again
[1:10:07] amen on the outside it doesn't look so
[1:10:09] great but he says what the word of the
[1:10:11] lord has tried and his way is perfect
[1:10:13] amen god never looked david alone even
[1:10:15] when it looked like david was completely
[1:10:17] forsaken remember when he's on the hill
[1:10:19] and he's completely surrounded by saul's
[1:10:21] army and what happens somebody comes to
[1:10:22] saw and says hey they're attacking and
[1:10:24] saul runs away nobody was attacking
[1:10:27] but it was just drawing them away so
[1:10:28] that david could escape time and time
[1:10:30] again
[1:10:31] the noose gets so tight around his neck
[1:10:33] and then god would just boom and he'd
[1:10:35] give him a way of escape each and every
[1:10:36] time
[1:10:37] he says for who is god save the lord and
[1:10:40] who is a rock save our god amen what
[1:10:43] david had only one place of refuge amen
[1:10:45] but he tried many things he tried
[1:10:48] hanging out with the philistines didn't
[1:10:49] he
[1:10:50] just to get a break he was willing to go
[1:10:52] sit with the enemy for a while
[1:10:54] and then he tried what lies
[1:10:56] he tried disguises
[1:10:58] he tried doing all sorts of things but
[1:11:00] he realized there's only one place i can
[1:11:01] go and by experience it was to god and
[1:11:03] god alone amen
[1:11:05] he said what god is my strength and
[1:11:08] power and he maketh my way perfect
[1:11:11] can you testify of that
[1:11:13] can you say that when god has his way
[1:11:15] then all things are perfect
[1:11:17] i can say that
[1:11:19] after 42 years i can say that many times
[1:11:21] that when it looked like it wasn't going
[1:11:23] so great but we trusted in the lord it
[1:11:25] brought it out to a perfect end each and
[1:11:27] every time
[1:11:29] even when it looks like it was hopeless
[1:11:30] even when somebody's sick even when
[1:11:32] there's not money in the bank it doesn't
[1:11:34] matter i remember when brother bob was
[1:11:36] getting our mail because we had gone
[1:11:37] away to nova scotia and we came back and
[1:11:39] we were about to go into we were about
[1:11:41] to go negative in our bank account
[1:11:43] and there was going to be a bill go out
[1:11:45] the next morning and we prayed in our
[1:11:46] car before we went into church that
[1:11:48] sunday morning how are you going to get
[1:11:49] money on a sunday morning you don't get
[1:11:51] money on a sunday morning and what
[1:11:53] happened brother bob gives us a check
[1:11:54] and it's a rebate check and we put it in
[1:11:55] there and it was just enough to cover
[1:11:57] the bill and take us to mary brown's
[1:11:58] that afternoon amen
[1:12:00] right what is it god's just looking for
[1:12:02] you listen that did not appear in
[1:12:04] brother bob's coat that day
[1:12:07] god had already prepared the answer to
[1:12:10] my prayer but what was he looking for he
[1:12:12] was looking for me to pray so that he
[1:12:13] could answer the prayer why to prove
[1:12:15] himself able to give me what i had need
[1:12:17] of in the time that i needed it amen
[1:12:20] my preference would have been to have it
[1:12:22] a week prior
[1:12:23] but god had set it up so it was just at
[1:12:25] the last minute when all hope was gone
[1:12:27] unless somebody basically came up and
[1:12:29] said brother john i felt in my heart to
[1:12:30] give you cold hard cash i was going to
[1:12:33] have an overdraft the next morning and
[1:12:34] yet god provided the way amen
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] brother brahm says it this way he says
[1:12:40] and in him is the fullness
[1:12:43] in him is all the sufficiency that we
[1:12:45] have need of he is my pleasure
[1:12:48] he is my life he is my joy he is more no
[1:12:51] i don't have to puff on a cigarette to
[1:12:53] get some kind of relief i take the lily
[1:12:55] of the valley he's the opia he's the
[1:12:58] things that he's a thing that makes me
[1:12:59] walk in the clouds he is my
[1:13:01] all-sufficient he is my hopes he is my
[1:13:04] rest he is my god he is my savior he is
[1:13:06] my healer he is all that i have need of
[1:13:10] because i die we die in him and are
[1:13:13] baptized in him and in him is all
[1:13:16] sufficiency what's your need what your
[1:13:19] cries the song says is anything too hard
[1:13:21] for the lord i listen to that service in
[1:13:23] the last while what a tremendous message
[1:13:25] if you need to pick me up is anything
[1:13:27] too hard for the lord amen what's he
[1:13:29] saying is there any insufficiency in the
[1:13:31] almighty infinite god
[1:13:33] there isn't amen the scripture says
[1:13:35] he'll withhold what no good thing from
[1:13:37] those that walk uprightly
[1:13:40] listen to this he says but did you ever
[1:13:43] try to ask god to make it manifest to
[1:13:45] make it real to you not just as a
[1:13:47] historical christ but a risen christ
[1:13:50] when i listen to those tapes where
[1:13:52] brother branham's preaching and the
[1:13:53] spirit of the lord is moving guess what
[1:13:55] i want i want that same thing in my life
[1:13:58] not the gift because that was that was
[1:14:00] for him i believe
[1:14:01] but i want the moving of that same holy
[1:14:03] spirit in my life in my family's life in
[1:14:05] the church's life in the community
[1:14:07] around us amen a reality that jumps off
[1:14:10] of the page and is living in me day in
[1:14:12] and day out and the first place i wanted
[1:14:14] to have power is in me
[1:14:16] i don't want power but i wanted to have
[1:14:18] power in me amen to overcome jonathan
[1:14:20] corlett
[1:14:22] amen he says what is it not a historic
[1:14:25] historical christ but a risen christ now
[1:14:28] many people accept christ as their
[1:14:29] savior because they're afraid of hell
[1:14:32] others are afraid to die without it but
[1:14:35] have you accepted him as your lord who
[1:14:37] can stand in the innermost part of you
[1:14:39] and open up the doors of your faith and
[1:14:42] just let yourself be in his hands i'm
[1:14:45] sure if you do he will punctuate every
[1:14:48] promise in here with an amen for it's
[1:14:50] his own spirit that wrote the bible and
[1:14:52] it's here to make it say amen because
[1:14:55] he's the author of this bible we've said
[1:14:57] it many times amen doesn't just mean i i
[1:15:00] agree
[1:15:01] but amen means so be it so where when i
[1:15:05] say amen when you say amen in service
[1:15:07] are you saying it for your brother your
[1:15:08] sister sure if it applies to them but
[1:15:11] you're saying it for yourself
[1:15:13] right you're saying so be it in me
[1:15:16] i don't just wanted him brother bob i
[1:15:17] don't just want it in brother matt i
[1:15:19] don't just want it in sister lydia but i
[1:15:20] want it in jonathan corlett so i'm
[1:15:22] saying amen for me it's not selfish to
[1:15:25] say so be it in me that's what god's
[1:15:27] asking us to do is let it be real in me
[1:15:29] let it be real in each one of us
[1:15:30] individually amen
[1:15:33] what is it do we want to deliver that
[1:15:34] only delivers other people a healer that
[1:15:36] only heals other people no we want that
[1:15:38] within our own lives don't we
[1:15:41] why because otherwise it makes him their
[1:15:42] god and he never becomes my god
[1:15:46] brother brahm says why don't you just
[1:15:48] come to christ and settle the whole
[1:15:49] thing
[1:15:50] once born again that settles it forever
[1:15:54] you'll stop searching when you get the
[1:15:55] holy ghost
[1:15:57] that's an easy way
[1:15:59] you'll stop searching you'll have rest
[1:16:01] it doesn't mean you stop seeking in that
[1:16:04] you're not always that you'll you'll
[1:16:05] never look for more because you're
[1:16:07] always looking for more of god you're
[1:16:08] always looking for more of him in your
[1:16:10] life but you'll have a rest that it was
[1:16:12] settled and it's settled for eternity
[1:16:13] amen
[1:16:14] once born of the spirit of god you have
[1:16:17] everlasting life and cannot come into
[1:16:19] condemnation but a pass from death to
[1:16:21] life then you can enjoy yourself
[1:16:25] then it's a pleasure to pray you don't
[1:16:27] have to wonder about whether god's going
[1:16:30] when you kneel to pray you're right in
[1:16:31] his presence when you're walking on the
[1:16:33] streets you're right in his presence
[1:16:35] wherever you are you're in his presence
[1:16:37] all the time for you have perfect
[1:16:39] fellowship with the son of god
[1:16:41] what a marvelous
[1:16:43] victorious life what when his presence
[1:16:46] is with you always and when you're aware
[1:16:48] of it and you know it and you're resting
[1:16:50] on that
[1:16:52] halfway life is the most miserable thing
[1:16:55] there is
[1:16:57] and by the way he says there's no such
[1:16:59] thing as a halfway christian you've
[1:17:00] never seen one and you never will
[1:17:03] you know when you experience that the
[1:17:04] closest
[1:17:05] when god is calling you to give your
[1:17:07] life and you haven't given it
[1:17:09] that's the most miserable isn't it
[1:17:10] because before he calls you you'll do
[1:17:12] okay but once he starts calling you and
[1:17:14] you don't give in that's when you're
[1:17:15] miserable and i can say that by
[1:17:16] experience until i gave my heart to the
[1:17:18] lord and he was calling me to give my
[1:17:20] heart to him i was miserable and i was
[1:17:22] miserable for six years
[1:17:25] six years sitting there trying not to go
[1:17:28] to the front brother gerald and it
[1:17:30] didn't matter what sermon he was
[1:17:31] preaching i always felt conviction to go
[1:17:33] and give my heart to the lord the most
[1:17:34] miserable time 11 years old that's a bad
[1:17:36] time to be miserable
[1:17:38] all the way up till i was 17 when i gave
[1:17:40] my heart to the lord brethren says it's
[1:17:42] a marvelous victorious life but the
[1:17:44] halfway life is the most miserable thing
[1:17:47] there is
[1:17:48] what's that what's that old southern
[1:17:50] gospel song
[1:17:54] give up
[1:17:56] and let jesus
[1:17:57] take over
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] that's what he's looking for
[1:18:03] he's looking for someone that says amend
[1:18:05] every word that's what he's talking
[1:18:06] about there you know what amen means
[1:18:08] you're gonna laugh
[1:18:09] you know what amen means
[1:18:11] mine
[1:18:13] mine
[1:18:14] when he says i am the lord that heals
[1:18:16] thee amen mine
[1:18:18] i am the deliverer mine i am the healer
[1:18:21] i am the one that gives you what you
[1:18:22] have need of i am the great provider
[1:18:25] what are you saying mine mine amen amen
[1:18:28] so be to me mine mine like the seagulls
[1:18:31] right mine mine everything you hear mine
[1:18:33] mine mine
[1:18:35] but guess what there's a price that
[1:18:37] comes with it being yours
[1:18:38] amen because it tastes good in the mouth
[1:18:41] but it's bitter in the belly and the
[1:18:43] reality is that you've got to go through
[1:18:44] trials and tribulations to prove out the
[1:18:46] word of god but in the meantime when it
[1:18:48] comes over that pulpit when you're
[1:18:49] you're reading your bible you're what
[1:18:51] you're saying when you say amen is
[1:18:52] you're saying that's mine
[1:18:53] right
[1:18:54] that's the possessor's cry amen mine so
[1:18:56] be it in my life
[1:18:58] that's what it's talking about amen
[1:19:01] says you've been penned up so long till
[1:19:03] you just have to get out and let your
[1:19:05] soul go a while just have to go out and
[1:19:07] have a lot of good time kind of release
[1:19:09] yourself on a vacation
[1:19:12] he's talking about people that say i
[1:19:13] just need to get away for a while
[1:19:15] now we all do
[1:19:16] i think we can all say we all need a
[1:19:18] vacation from time to time
[1:19:21] but he says brother that just shows
[1:19:22] you've never had fellowship with christ
[1:19:25] we all nodded and said we needed that
[1:19:27] and then he says we've never had
[1:19:28] fellowship with christ
[1:19:29] but what is it we need a release is
[1:19:31] really what we're talking about amen you
[1:19:33] get bottled up you get so tied up that's
[1:19:35] why it's good for us to have special
[1:19:36] meetings you know that
[1:19:38] because what you can get a different
[1:19:39] gift in same anointing different gift
[1:19:41] and guess what you can kind of just
[1:19:42] relax a bit and have something different
[1:19:45] come across the pulpit for a little bit
[1:19:47] and what just let go a little bit
[1:19:49] it's a vacation a change is as good as a
[1:19:51] vacation they say
[1:19:53] he says if a man or woman has ever had a
[1:19:56] real divine taste of fellowship with
[1:19:57] christ i'd rather have it all than the
[1:19:59] vacations and things in the world now
[1:20:01] that i can say amen to
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:04] sure if you want to give me relaxation
[1:20:07] let me feel christ let me talk to him a
[1:20:10] little while and my burdens roll away
[1:20:12] it's all done he says no i'd rather talk
[1:20:14] to him than anything i know in the world
[1:20:17] have fellowship with them david said
[1:20:19] taste and see that the lord is good
[1:20:22] just taste it after him once and see if
[1:20:25] he isn't good he says it tastes like
[1:20:27] honey in the rock
[1:20:30] you know how you know when you're under
[1:20:31] the influence of something other than
[1:20:32] the holy ghost
[1:20:34] you're all worked up
[1:20:37] you're frustrated you're unhappy you're
[1:20:39] on the warpath you're out to get someone
[1:20:41] amen that's never the fruit of the holy
[1:20:43] spirit and it never will be amen but it
[1:20:45] shows something's wrong david didn't say
[1:20:47] read and see
[1:20:48] see sometimes that's what we're going
[1:20:49] through as we're reading and we're
[1:20:50] trying to see what we're reading he says
[1:20:52] no no no you've got to taste and see you
[1:20:54] got to put it into action you got to let
[1:20:56] it actually come into your life and have
[1:20:58] a portion there amen get something into
[1:21:00] you touch it put it in your mouth
[1:21:02] experience it is what he's saying don't
[1:21:04] just nod your head but he says take it
[1:21:06] and eat it let it become a reality
[1:21:08] right john he said go take the book and
[1:21:11] then he said you got to eat it
[1:21:13] and it's real easy to take it
[1:21:15] but it's real hard to eat it sometimes
[1:21:16] isn't it
[1:21:18] but eating it's the only way you're
[1:21:19] going to taste and see that god is good
[1:21:20] amen you can't read about god and
[1:21:22] experience god amen you've got to let
[1:21:24] him come into your life in a reality way
[1:21:26] amen what is it it's bitter in the belly
[1:21:29] like john experienced because the
[1:21:31] reality of god always takes you through
[1:21:33] trials and testing always paul says if
[1:21:36] you don't go through it then you're not
[1:21:37] a you're not a child of his you're a
[1:21:38] bastard
[1:21:40] how can you know a supernatural god
[1:21:42] unless you go through things that
[1:21:43] require a supernatural god
[1:21:45] amen how do you know a god that's going
[1:21:47] to bring light if you're not in darkness
[1:21:49] how do you know a god that delivers if
[1:21:50] you don't need deliverance how do you
[1:21:51] know a god that's a healer if you don't
[1:21:52] need healing and then the very things
[1:21:54] that define god are our trials
[1:21:57] without trials then we're just doing
[1:21:58] this happy-go-lucky life where we're
[1:22:00] rich spoiled kids is what we are
[1:22:02] but the reality of god comes through
[1:22:04] what the testing and trials that he puts
[1:22:05] us through i've read this before brother
[1:22:07] cadre diggs is the one that brought it
[1:22:09] he says now remember god has counted you
[1:22:11] worthy when you have a test now don't
[1:22:14] fail to get this when you have a trial
[1:22:16] or a test it shows the grace of god has
[1:22:18] found you you found favor with god and
[1:22:21] god believes that you'll stand the test
[1:22:24] why because what's on the other side of
[1:22:26] that test is a revelation of a reality
[1:22:28] that god is with you
[1:22:29] every time if you go through the test
[1:22:31] the way that he wants you to if you keep
[1:22:33] ducking and sliding ducking and sliding
[1:22:35] and ducking and sliding guess what god
[1:22:37] can't meet you there but if you'll walk
[1:22:39] through it willingly like david yea
[1:22:41] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:22:42] shadow of death i'll fear no evil he had
[1:22:44] to walk through the valley of the shadow
[1:22:45] of death before he could say i had i'll
[1:22:47] fear no evil
[1:22:48] i mean he's got to go through it before
[1:22:49] he can say hey i went through it and
[1:22:51] didn't have any fear amen amen we don't
[1:22:53] have a need for god when we've got tons
[1:22:55] of money in the bank and our health is
[1:22:57] great and our relationships are great
[1:22:58] and our career is great and church is
[1:23:00] great and our ministry is great and no
[1:23:02] that's not where you're going to grow
[1:23:04] we think that if god if god cared for
[1:23:06] his bride then he would give her
[1:23:08] everything she has need of he did trials
[1:23:10] and tribulations with the power to go
[1:23:12] through it by the anointing of the holy
[1:23:13] spirit amen
[1:23:15] but what we want to when we do get a
[1:23:17] break
[1:23:18] i think sometimes we're not getting many
[1:23:20] breaks these days because it seems like
[1:23:21] you just go from one thing to the next
[1:23:22] thing to the next thing but when you get
[1:23:24] a break what's the idea
[1:23:26] keep your weapon sharp and then don't
[1:23:28] slack off then because you know what's
[1:23:30] coming over the hill you know what's
[1:23:31] coming through the tunnel don't you
[1:23:33] brother joe and it's the headlights of a
[1:23:35] very large truck
[1:23:36] right so what you've got to take that
[1:23:38] time what to get ready for the next one
[1:23:41] and then don't slack too often
[1:23:43] amen but get right get right back to it
[1:23:45] amen you want to you want your
[1:23:47] discernment to be on par
[1:23:48] for where it needs to be when the next
[1:23:50] thing comes along because satan's going
[1:23:51] to try and trick you every time we're up
[1:23:53] against a religious spirit more than
[1:23:54] anything amen that means discernment
[1:23:56] revelation is a requirement for the
[1:23:57] believer in this day
[1:23:59] look at daniel
[1:24:01] okay daniel is one that talks about my
[1:24:03] god and this is a mighty man a gifted
[1:24:05] prophet anointed to speak to the jews
[1:24:07] and to the gentiles he's a man that's
[1:24:10] known to excite spiritual warfare to get
[1:24:12] him an answer and yet in the end daniel
[1:24:14] was taken into the den of lions
[1:24:17] why what did daniel do
[1:24:18] what did daniel do to deserve to go into
[1:24:20] the lion's den from god's standpoint if
[1:24:22] i could put it that way what he's been
[1:24:24] he's been thrown to the lines for
[1:24:26] faithfully doing what god told him to do
[1:24:28] how is that fair
[1:24:30] there's no fairness in it has nothing to
[1:24:32] do with fair it has to do with the
[1:24:33] sovereignty of god amen look at daniel's
[1:24:36] life maybe 14 15 years old the the
[1:24:39] babylonians come in they take him and a
[1:24:41] couple thousand other young men just
[1:24:42] like him the best of the best the cream
[1:24:44] of the crop the the the most educated
[1:24:47] the most uh likely to succeed
[1:24:49] right and they take him out of his home
[1:24:51] they take him from his parents they take
[1:24:52] him from his pastor they take him from
[1:24:54] his church they take him from his food
[1:24:56] they take him from his home everything
[1:24:57] he's he's taken away from everything
[1:24:59] that we would expect a believer to need
[1:25:00] to succeed in this world and taken to a
[1:25:03] place where him and three others are the
[1:25:05] only ones that will stand in the end
[1:25:06] thousands and thousands of believers
[1:25:09] and yet in that place every single one
[1:25:11] of them backslid except three others
[1:25:12] plus daniel
[1:25:14] right what is it
[1:25:15] it was god proving his prophet was what
[1:25:17] it was right daniel has an experience
[1:25:19] here that very few people will have and
[1:25:21] has to go into a lion's den and come out
[1:25:23] alive the next morning
[1:25:25] david got daniel got thrown into the
[1:25:26] lion's den for praying publicly
[1:25:29] could you be thrown into the lion's den
[1:25:31] for that today
[1:25:32] i've always said it i'll say it again
[1:25:34] the to me the best way to let people
[1:25:36] know sometimes that you actually believe
[1:25:38] in something that you're not just a
[1:25:40] christian that says i'm a christian you
[1:25:42] bow your head and pray over your food
[1:25:44] that lets people know that you actually
[1:25:46] believe that there's a god to pray to in
[1:25:47] the first place amen i was in the gym
[1:25:49] the other day and a very serious prayer
[1:25:51] request came through you know what i did
[1:25:52] i bowed my head right there and i prayed
[1:25:54] and i didn't pray a 10 second prayer
[1:25:56] either
[1:25:57] right this is we're not here to just
[1:25:58] duck out and do this no i bowed my head
[1:26:00] and i prayed until i i wanted to raise
[1:26:02] my head again amen we've got to be able
[1:26:04] to stand for what we believe and not to
[1:26:06] go out and put it in front of people and
[1:26:08] try and offend them or anything but when
[1:26:10] we've got to do something for god then
[1:26:12] we do something for god regardless of
[1:26:13] what people are going to think about us
[1:26:14] amen we've got to have a boldness what
[1:26:16] does that old song dare to be a daniel
[1:26:18] dare to stand alone listen you're going
[1:26:20] to be standing alone if you haven't
[1:26:21] experienced it yet you're going to be
[1:26:23] standing alone at some point you're
[1:26:24] going to have to do what god wants you
[1:26:26] to do regardless of what people think
[1:26:27] you know how silly it looks a guy
[1:26:29] standing there over by a weight stack
[1:26:31] with his head bowed
[1:26:32] maybe people thought i was just trying
[1:26:34] to catch my breath
[1:26:35] i don't know but guess what you've got
[1:26:37] to be able to do what god calls you to
[1:26:39] do amen regardless of what people are
[1:26:40] going to think
[1:26:44] matthew 10 32 says whoever therefore
[1:26:46] shall confess me before men him why will
[1:26:49] i also confess
[1:26:50] before my father which is in heaven
[1:26:53] and daniel's a perfect example of this
[1:26:54] he didn't just go pray in his room
[1:26:56] listen daniel didn't have to pray in
[1:26:58] that window
[1:26:59] he was supposed to look towards
[1:27:01] jerusalem amen but you can look towards
[1:27:02] jerusalem in a closed window in a closed
[1:27:04] room if you want to but he opened the
[1:27:05] window and he let his voice go he wasn't
[1:27:07] going to hide the fact that he was
[1:27:08] praying to god
[1:27:10] right remember we we read that quote way
[1:27:12] back when about brother branham says if
[1:27:14] you're if you're not a part of the five
[1:27:15] full ministry you're not anointed to
[1:27:17] preach the word to handle the word so
[1:27:19] don't do it but what did he say he said
[1:27:20] give your testimony
[1:27:22] did you know daniel needed a testimony
[1:27:25] brother brahm says i'll read you the
[1:27:26] quote in just a minute but we need a
[1:27:28] testimony
[1:27:29] we don't just need to be able to tell
[1:27:31] people god sent a prophet or we believe
[1:27:32] in in a god that's here today the same
[1:27:34] way he was back then but we need a
[1:27:35] testimony that backs up what we believe
[1:27:38] otherwise we're just hot air
[1:27:39] aren't we
[1:27:41] but says this he says a living god not a
[1:27:43] dead one what good is a god that could
[1:27:46] open the red sea if he can't do the same
[1:27:48] today what good is a god that could heal
[1:27:50] a leper in the days gone by if he can't
[1:27:52] do the same today a historical god is no
[1:27:55] good if he isn't the same god today
[1:27:57] that's right he is the same god today
[1:27:59] yesterday today and forever the same one
[1:28:02] only asking the same faith that they
[1:28:05] exercised
[1:28:07] look at this in daniel 6 it says then
[1:28:08] the king arose very early in the morning
[1:28:10] and went in haste to the den of lions
[1:28:12] and when he came to the den he cried
[1:28:14] with a lamentable voice unto daniel and
[1:28:16] the king spake and said to daniel o
[1:28:18] daniel servant of the living god is thy
[1:28:21] god whom thou serve us continually able
[1:28:23] to deliver thee from the lions i like
[1:28:25] that testimony they saw no wavering in
[1:28:28] daniel's testimony from start to finish
[1:28:30] amen when he came up and they says he
[1:28:32] prayed and he prayed to god he prayed to
[1:28:34] somebody other than the king daniel
[1:28:35] didn't duck
[1:28:36] he didn't say no no no king you know me
[1:28:38] i would never lie no no no daniel owned
[1:28:40] up to it and he had never wavered prior
[1:28:43] to that
[1:28:45] and then daniel said unto the king o
[1:28:46] king live forever my god
[1:28:49] has sent his angel and has shut the
[1:28:51] lion's mouths that they have not hurt me
[1:28:53] for as much as before him innocency was
[1:28:56] found in me and also before thee o king
[1:28:59] have i done no hurt then was the king
[1:29:01] exceedingly glad for him and commanded
[1:29:04] that they should take daniel up out of
[1:29:05] the den so daniel was taken up out of
[1:29:08] the den and no manner of hurt was found
[1:29:10] upon him why
[1:29:12] because he believed in his god amen
[1:29:17] what daniel brought him what brought
[1:29:19] daniel to this place
[1:29:21] again it wasn't just listening to wasn't
[1:29:23] just reading the scrolls
[1:29:24] wasn't just going to church but it was
[1:29:26] standing in obedience to what god had
[1:29:28] called him to be and to do what god had
[1:29:30] called him to do amen he'd been put in
[1:29:32] isolation he'd been a captive like i
[1:29:34] said he only had three believing friends
[1:29:36] out of all of them
[1:29:37] they're sitting in a king's palace and
[1:29:39] i'm sure they have every temptation
[1:29:40] known to man they're from food to women
[1:29:42] to popularity to money and all these
[1:29:43] different things but daniel never
[1:29:45] partook of it and he kept himself
[1:29:46] separate from it amen and what when the
[1:29:48] time came for a trial god accepted his
[1:29:51] faith and brought him through it without
[1:29:52] a scratch on it
[1:29:54] brother brown would say it this way he
[1:29:56] says here it is
[1:29:57] every true witness of god sometimes will
[1:30:00] be put to the showdown amen will be put
[1:30:03] to a showdown to prove
[1:30:04] oh how god loves to do it when he can
[1:30:07] find a real witness and it proves god
[1:30:10] and when the lions come to destroy the
[1:30:12] prophet after he had been a true witness
[1:30:14] that there was a living god an angel
[1:30:16] perhaps of fire unfolded the veil from
[1:30:18] the b size and when they rushed to the
[1:30:20] prophet they backed away because god is
[1:30:23] a consuming fire and animals are afraid
[1:30:25] of fire when god appears he usually
[1:30:28] appears in fire and as they rush to the
[1:30:30] prophet to consume him hungry lions they
[1:30:33] saw the fire around the prophet and they
[1:30:35] stood their distance
[1:30:36] and then daniel in his trueness of the
[1:30:39] witness of the living god gave testimony
[1:30:42] the next morning that there is a real
[1:30:44] true and living god who can deliver from
[1:30:46] the lion's den now i want you to listen
[1:30:48] to this part he says he testified to it
[1:30:51] when
[1:30:52] before the trial
[1:30:54] he didn't testify after he testified
[1:30:55] before
[1:30:57] and god gave him the opportunity to what
[1:31:00] match matches testimony how by a trial
[1:31:04] daniel said i serve a living god god
[1:31:06] said let's prove it
[1:31:08] this had nothing to do with the king
[1:31:09] this had to do with daniel proving that
[1:31:10] there was a living god
[1:31:12] daniel says there's a living god god
[1:31:13] says let's prove it
[1:31:15] and then brother brown says and he
[1:31:16] proved out a hundred percent and then
[1:31:19] after the trial was over he was still
[1:31:20] standing and god had proved himself to
[1:31:22] be real through him listen daniel was a
[1:31:24] prophet
[1:31:25] but brother brahm says he was a prophet
[1:31:27] of god but now he became a witness of
[1:31:31] god
[1:31:32] so you're saying he could be a prophet
[1:31:33] and not a witness absolutely because
[1:31:35] what prophet is just a gift it's just a
[1:31:38] calling right balaam had the same thing
[1:31:41] in that what god could speak to him and
[1:31:43] he would know what to say and he could
[1:31:44] deliver the message that had nothing to
[1:31:46] do with the witness that was just being
[1:31:47] a microphone but when it comes this time
[1:31:50] now daniel gets to be a witness because
[1:31:51] now his life's on the line and it's him
[1:31:53] that's proving that it's a living god
[1:31:55] amen
[1:31:56] what is it it's about a present reality
[1:31:58] it's not just gifts and callings it's
[1:32:00] not just signs and wonders but it's god
[1:32:02] moving in people of his choosing amen
[1:32:04] it's not just a god that acts in our
[1:32:06] minds and hearts we've been changed i
[1:32:08] believe
[1:32:09] and that's a wonderful thing but nobody
[1:32:10] knows that except us
[1:32:12] but when we see him acting and moving in
[1:32:14] our lives that's when they get to see
[1:32:16] the reality of god amen we get so caught
[1:32:18] up in being spiritual sometimes that we
[1:32:20] forget that god promised to be literal
[1:32:23] healing is literal
[1:32:25] right deliverance is literal provision
[1:32:27] is literal
[1:32:28] amen when he says i'm going to provide
[1:32:30] for you whether he does it by money
[1:32:31] whether he does it by somebody helping
[1:32:33] you out whatever it is it's still a
[1:32:34] literal action we are the still the
[1:32:36] hands and feet of god and god will still
[1:32:38] create things out of thin air but it's
[1:32:40] still a literal manifestation of a
[1:32:42] supernatural god amen and sometimes
[1:32:44] sometimes we forget it what is that
[1:32:46] saying you're you're so spiritual you're
[1:32:48] of no earthly good well guess what god
[1:32:50] is not so spiritual that he is of no
[1:32:52] earthly good because most of the
[1:32:53] promises of god are earthly
[1:32:55] they are a manifestation in our body
[1:32:57] their manifestation in our lives they're
[1:32:59] not just ideas and thoughts and
[1:33:01] something in the e3 man
[1:33:03] you look at the three hebrew children
[1:33:05] amen what brought them to the point of
[1:33:06] being in front of an angry king and
[1:33:08] refusing to bow down to the image
[1:33:10] what is it daniel's not there to protect
[1:33:12] them
[1:33:14] it's sad i don't know that it's true
[1:33:15] that perhaps the image was of daniel
[1:33:17] himself
[1:33:18] that they turned into prophet worship
[1:33:20] but either way daniel wasn't there we
[1:33:22] know and the three of them are standing
[1:33:23] there the prophet's gone there's nobody
[1:33:26] there to protect him there's nobody to
[1:33:27] say come on king
[1:33:28] daniel was it was over everybody if he
[1:33:31] said king come on now let's you know
[1:33:33] what we are you know what we stand for
[1:33:35] we've been through this i've been
[1:33:36] through the lines then just let us go no
[1:33:37] no they had to stand on their own two
[1:33:39] feet each one of them amen
[1:33:41] what they didn't have that profit there
[1:33:43] to back them up but what did they do
[1:33:45] they're christians they're believers so
[1:33:46] they just stay with the word regardless
[1:33:48] didn't they
[1:33:49] listen sometimes we go out looking for
[1:33:51] trials
[1:33:52] we don't think we do but we do and what
[1:33:55] is it we go looking to get noticed
[1:33:57] we go looking to be different we go
[1:33:59] looking to stand out
[1:34:01] and you'll see mostly that in social
[1:34:03] media these days
[1:34:04] and you go out and all of a sudden
[1:34:05] people start disagreeing with you and
[1:34:07] you think that you're what being
[1:34:08] persecuted you're not being persecuted
[1:34:10] you just went unpicked a fight and
[1:34:12] predictably there are other people that
[1:34:14] disagree with you and so they started
[1:34:15] fighting with you
[1:34:16] you're not going out and claiming your
[1:34:18] property you're going out and picking a
[1:34:19] fight
[1:34:20] which is what it is amen but there they
[1:34:23] didn't do that amen amen in those
[1:34:25] situations you go and pick that you're
[1:34:26] unwise
[1:34:27] you're you're picking a fight thinking
[1:34:29] you're standing up for god they weren't
[1:34:30] picking a fight with the king when they
[1:34:31] stood in front of him and said we won't
[1:34:33] bow
[1:34:34] they were picking a fight they just said
[1:34:35] we can't do that because i'm because
[1:34:36] we're believers
[1:34:38] that's all there was to it they weren't
[1:34:40] debating or anything like that they just
[1:34:41] said look we can't do it
[1:34:44] going out to try and prove we're
[1:34:45] different is never what's going to save
[1:34:47] somebody
[1:34:48] amen right
[1:34:49] so often today
[1:34:51] we want us we want to just be this this
[1:34:53] glowing this huge light
[1:34:56] and guess what that's never what we're
[1:34:57] called to do
[1:34:58] not in that sense look at the way
[1:35:00] brother branham says he says now just be
[1:35:02] yourself
[1:35:04] simple
[1:35:05] humble waiting for the coming of the
[1:35:07] lord
[1:35:08] now we don't believe in glamour
[1:35:11] something shining you know i always said
[1:35:12] hollywood shines but christianity glows
[1:35:16] there's a lot of difference between
[1:35:17] shining and glowing hollywood shines
[1:35:19] with great class and society and glamour
[1:35:22] but a christianity glows with humility
[1:35:25] the way up is always down
[1:35:28] he says now i trust that everyone will
[1:35:30] be filled with the holy spirit and now
[1:35:32] before you can be filled with this holy
[1:35:34] spirit you've got to die to yourself
[1:35:36] first in order to be born again so what
[1:35:40] loud boisterous flashy talkative that
[1:35:42] was never the way of christ
[1:35:44] you look at christ it says there was
[1:35:45] nothing on him that made us like him
[1:35:47] when we looked at him visually he wasn't
[1:35:49] a good lucky man he wasn't tall muscular
[1:35:52] didn't have the greatest deltoids in the
[1:35:54] message
[1:35:55] right
[1:35:56] here's just a normal man
[1:35:58] just look like anybody nothing special
[1:36:00] about him he didn't have this great
[1:36:02] booming voice he didn't have this the
[1:36:04] the big stature you know he wasn't a
[1:36:06] great orator necessarily scripture says
[1:36:08] there was nothing that would draw us to
[1:36:09] him in terms of his physicality or or
[1:36:12] his features or these things amen
[1:36:14] but he just sat there and he spoke to
[1:36:16] people at their level
[1:36:17] he was humble
[1:36:19] great god jehovah in a man's body
[1:36:21] a perfect image of god is sitting there
[1:36:24] speaking and there's no flash or
[1:36:25] boisterity about about christ amen and
[1:36:28] yet we'll go out there and we'll be that
[1:36:29] loud and boisterous and we'll be we'll
[1:36:31] be pushy and we'll be looking for a
[1:36:32] fight and that was never it listen peter
[1:36:34] had to get the new birth so that he
[1:36:35] could get that spirit off of him peter
[1:36:38] was always looking remember when jesus
[1:36:39] said
[1:36:40] he was just about to go to the garden
[1:36:41] and he says he's talking about something
[1:36:43] that's completely unrelated he says
[1:36:45] you'll need some swords and peter says
[1:36:46] hey we got swords
[1:36:48] that's what peter was good for bringing
[1:36:49] a sword that was it but when he got the
[1:36:52] new birth we never see peter or zealot
[1:36:53] again we never see peter going and
[1:36:55] picking fights do we
[1:36:56] why because he had the new birth there
[1:36:58] was a different spirit that was driving
[1:36:59] him now amen
[1:37:01] can you imagine
[1:37:02] it struck me as funny as i was thinking
[1:37:04] about this these young these three
[1:37:05] hebrew children they're they're standing
[1:37:07] in front of the king and he says listen
[1:37:09] if you don't do what i say i'm gonna
[1:37:10] burn you do you know what they'd be
[1:37:11] doing today they'd be on their phone tag
[1:37:13] right they'd be on their phone they'd be
[1:37:15] saying hashtag we won't bow
[1:37:17] right and they'd be on twitter and
[1:37:19] they'd be tweeting and they'd be on
[1:37:20] facebook and they'd be on on instagram
[1:37:22] and they'd be saying what call them call
[1:37:24] the press
[1:37:26] bring them here it's going down they're
[1:37:27] gonna burn us right we're immigrants
[1:37:29] it's racist what he's doing workplace
[1:37:32] harassment religious persecution guys
[1:37:35] come on bring the cameras up watch
[1:37:37] what's going to happen
[1:37:38] right drawing a big thing to themselves
[1:37:41] that's what happens today isn't it
[1:37:42] people want to bring the news in they
[1:37:44] want to they want to bring a spotlight
[1:37:45] on their little trial their little
[1:37:46] difficulty it's amazing what i see when
[1:37:49] i when i dare venture on the cbc and
[1:37:51] they have the littlest stories of people
[1:37:53] and they elevate them to great big
[1:37:54] mountains until something happens right
[1:37:56] what is it everybody thinks they've got
[1:37:58] to have everybody doing something for
[1:38:00] them
[1:38:01] but look at these three
[1:38:03] then nebuchadnezzar and his rage and
[1:38:04] fury commanded to bring them and they
[1:38:06] brought these men before the king and he
[1:38:08] spake and said unto them is it true oh
[1:38:09] shadrach meshach and abednego do you not
[1:38:12] serve my gods nor worship the golden
[1:38:13] image which i have set up and shadrach
[1:38:16] meshach and abednego answered and said
[1:38:17] to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not
[1:38:20] careful to answer thee in this matter if
[1:38:22] it be so our god whom we serve
[1:38:25] they had a reality even before then that
[1:38:27] this was their god is able to deliver us
[1:38:30] from the burning fiery furnace and he
[1:38:32] will deliver us out of thy hand o king
[1:38:35] but if not be it known unto thee o king
[1:38:37] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[1:38:39] worship the golden image with thou set
[1:38:41] up so they're saying you know just
[1:38:43] because we're getting close to the fire
[1:38:45] and our clothes are starting to melt and
[1:38:46] our eyebrows are starting to go away
[1:38:48] we're not going to change then
[1:38:50] right when the fire gets hot when things
[1:38:52] get very tough we're not going to bow to
[1:38:53] your image then
[1:38:55] doesn't matter what happens if he
[1:38:56] delivers us great if he doesn't deliver
[1:38:58] us great but we're sticking with the
[1:38:59] word that's what they're saying here
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:03] but listen to what brother branham says
[1:39:05] here this is a absolutely phenomenal
[1:39:06] quote he says here's the words that they
[1:39:08] had god was so real to them they said
[1:39:11] our god is able
[1:39:14] how about that the fellow didn't believe
[1:39:16] that don't believe in divine healing god
[1:39:18] is able to deliver us come these fiery
[1:39:21] furnace but will not bow down to your
[1:39:23] images and when they walked into the
[1:39:25] fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that
[1:39:27] god was able not promised but he was
[1:39:30] able
[1:39:31] that's a big difference
[1:39:33] they had no promise walking in but they
[1:39:35] said he's able but even if he doesn't
[1:39:37] we're walking in no matter what
[1:39:39] and god sent christ in the fiery furnace
[1:39:41] and fanned the fire away from them and
[1:39:43] protected them and brought them out sure
[1:39:46] but i'm saying god is able now watch
[1:39:48] this transition here
[1:39:50] watch this transition because nobody in
[1:39:52] history had walked through the fire that
[1:39:53] way certainly one that was seven times
[1:39:55] hotter
[1:39:56] nobody had ever done it they said god is
[1:39:58] able but there was no promise there was
[1:40:00] no past experience they could draw on
[1:40:02] they couldn't say well joshua went
[1:40:03] through this so we can go through it we
[1:40:05] serve the same no no no they said worry
[1:40:07] in a trial that's particular to us
[1:40:09] nobody's ever faced it we believe he can
[1:40:12] do it but if he doesn't it won't change
[1:40:13] whether or not we serve him
[1:40:16] but watch this transition brother
[1:40:17] branham makes he says now you don't come
[1:40:20] saying god is able
[1:40:22] you don't have to come that way
[1:40:25] god you promised amen you prepared it at
[1:40:29] calvary and i've come to receive it it's
[1:40:32] your preparation you provided it you
[1:40:35] promised it i see others receiving it so
[1:40:38] i come to lord to get my part of it
[1:40:41] you'll go away a different person you'll
[1:40:43] go away with such an anchor inside your
[1:40:45] soul then nothing can upset you you know
[1:40:48] that you're healed you know that god has
[1:40:50] taken care of this matter for you
[1:40:51] because he has promised
[1:40:54] amen the world has plenty of images out
[1:40:56] there for you to bow down to if you want
[1:40:58] to and then we've talked about many of
[1:41:00] them current events entertainment social
[1:41:02] justice movements p female empowerment
[1:41:04] and feminism politics alternative
[1:41:06] lifestyles career fixation amen if
[1:41:08] you're involved with any of them
[1:41:10] what is it god can't have a reality in
[1:41:12] your life like you're looking for
[1:41:13] because you're bowed down to another
[1:41:15] image you can try all you want and i see
[1:41:17] believers doing it they try and fit it
[1:41:19] into the word of god it has no place in
[1:41:21] our life amen it is not a focus for a
[1:41:23] believer none of it
[1:41:26] none of it
[1:41:27] none of it
[1:41:28] jesus refused to get drawn into it
[1:41:30] why are we getting drawn into it amen
[1:41:32] there's a quote i'll bring in the next
[1:41:34] service lord william where brother brown
[1:41:35] says we've got a new president coming in
[1:41:37] we've got a new president coming he says
[1:41:39] all i care about is that he is coming
[1:41:42] amen that's what we're caught up in is
[1:41:43] not who's a president not who's a prime
[1:41:45] minister we're carrying about what who's
[1:41:47] coming in a rapturing and who's going to
[1:41:49] take us away that's where our concern is
[1:41:51] that's what we're supposed to be talking
[1:41:52] about amen the rest of it's a twisted up
[1:41:54] mess and somehow we're thinking that we
[1:41:56] can untwist it if we just get in there
[1:41:58] with our christian values guess what
[1:42:00] it's satan's kingdom it's not for ours
[1:42:02] to be untwisting amen
[1:42:04] why would we ever work in his kingdom
[1:42:05] we're working for a kingdom that is to
[1:42:07] come amen it's not of this world in the
[1:42:09] first place
[1:42:11] amen love and love and kindness have
[1:42:14] never grown on social media all the
[1:42:16] studies say that it thrives on discord
[1:42:18] disagreement and partial truths and what
[1:42:20] does it do it turns people into
[1:42:22] polarized minions that can't remember
[1:42:24] they're supposed to be a christian
[1:42:26] i can't tell you how many people i had a
[1:42:27] a man that i knew by by name and by
[1:42:29] reputation i never met him he has to be
[1:42:31] a friend of mine on facebook i said sure
[1:42:33] and all i saw from him was trump trump
[1:42:35] trump and then he got racist with an
[1:42:37] arab and he was doing this and that the
[1:42:39] other thing this is a man that's a a
[1:42:40] worship leader in a church
[1:42:44] and he's saying these sorts of things
[1:42:45] and you know what i did
[1:42:47] i just took him right off of my feet
[1:42:49] because why that has no place in a
[1:42:51] christian's life amen and he was saying
[1:42:52] and doing things that i would have been
[1:42:54] ashamed of an unbeliever to say much
[1:42:55] less a christian
[1:42:57] and how many times i can't tell you that
[1:42:58] people have asked to be a friend on
[1:43:00] there or that they've linked up with me
[1:43:01] in some way and i end up just shutting
[1:43:03] it off because i can't stand to see
[1:43:04] their their reputation besmirched as a
[1:43:06] as a believer because of the things
[1:43:08] they're putting on social media it's
[1:43:10] ridiculous
[1:43:11] and then we got to be careful
[1:43:13] even in a professional environment and
[1:43:15] then you're going to face it and i'm
[1:43:16] sure most of us have faced it at some
[1:43:17] point where you got to stand up for what
[1:43:19] you believe and not to make a big thing
[1:43:21] about it right not to call the news and
[1:43:23] say this is my religion no no no i'm a
[1:43:25] believer i'm a christian this is the way
[1:43:27] i live my life and this is what i'm
[1:43:29] going to do and this is what i'm not
[1:43:30] going to do whether it's not going into
[1:43:31] a bar when everybody else goes into a
[1:43:33] bar when you're traveling or whether
[1:43:34] it's saying listen i'm not going to sit
[1:43:36] on this meeting because this is
[1:43:37] something that i just can't i can't get
[1:43:39] in line with
[1:43:40] what and if you're if you're gentle
[1:43:42] about it usually they'll they'll respect
[1:43:43] you sometimes they won't and then you
[1:43:44] just have to say them we're gonna have
[1:43:45] to disagree and just move on
[1:43:47] amen
[1:43:49] what does the scripture say after the
[1:43:50] first or second admonition move on and i
[1:43:52] find that's what's happening so much
[1:43:53] again with the social media side is
[1:43:55] we're not moving on after the first or
[1:43:56] second admonition but we're going and
[1:43:58] going and going and going like it's
[1:43:59] somehow going to make a difference and
[1:44:00] it just won't like the king you're just
[1:44:02] going to end up angering them amen
[1:44:05] then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury in
[1:44:07] the form of his visage was changed
[1:44:08] against shadrach mesa meshach and
[1:44:10] abednego therefore he spake and
[1:44:12] commanded that they should heat the
[1:44:13] furnace one seven times more than it was
[1:44:15] want to be heated and he commanded the
[1:44:18] most mighty men that were in his army to
[1:44:19] bind shadrach meshach and abednego and
[1:44:21] to cast them into the burning fiery
[1:44:23] furnace then these men were bound in
[1:44:25] their coats their hoses and their hats
[1:44:27] and their other garments and were cast
[1:44:28] into the midst of the burning fiery
[1:44:30] furnace
[1:44:31] therefore because the king's commandment
[1:44:33] was urgent in the furnace exceeding hot
[1:44:35] the flames of the fire slew those men
[1:44:37] that took up shadrach meshach and
[1:44:39] abednego
[1:44:40] then these three men shadrach meshach
[1:44:42] and abednego fell down bound into the
[1:44:44] midst of the burning fiery furnace and
[1:44:46] then nebuchadnezzar the king was
[1:44:47] astonished and rose up in haste and
[1:44:50] spake and said to his counselors did not
[1:44:52] we cast three men bound into the midst
[1:44:54] of the fire the answer and said unto the
[1:44:55] king true o king
[1:44:58] he answered and said lo i see four men
[1:45:00] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[1:45:02] and they have no hurt and the form of
[1:45:04] the fourth is like the son of god it's
[1:45:06] amazing that a king like that could
[1:45:08] recognize the son of god and yet he
[1:45:10] could come and walk the earth and the
[1:45:11] priest could never recognize him
[1:45:14] then nebuchadnezzar came near to the
[1:45:16] mouth of the burning fiery furnace and
[1:45:17] spake and said sharach meshach abednego
[1:45:20] ye servants of the most high gog come
[1:45:22] forth and come hither then shadrach
[1:45:23] meshach and abednego came forth of the
[1:45:26] midst of the fire
[1:45:28] now i read that it's a very familiar
[1:45:30] scripture but i wanted to take it as a
[1:45:31] type because guess what we walk into a
[1:45:34] lot of fires
[1:45:36] as believers we walk into a lot of fires
[1:45:38] not because we chose but because we have
[1:45:40] to
[1:45:41] and guess what we go through fires that
[1:45:43] would destroy most people that would
[1:45:44] destroy most marriages that would
[1:45:46] destroy most relationships that would
[1:45:48] destroy most careers and that would
[1:45:49] destroy most churches and we walk out
[1:45:52] not not even bound anymore but loose and
[1:45:55] with what the presence of the living god
[1:45:57] in the midst of us why
[1:45:58] because we stood on the word and people
[1:46:01] take notice when you go through a
[1:46:03] life-changing disease you go through
[1:46:05] cancer you go through something like
[1:46:06] that and guess what you walk through and
[1:46:08] you come out and guess what you're
[1:46:09] sweeter than you ever were right when
[1:46:12] when you go through a trial in your
[1:46:14] relationship you go through a trial in
[1:46:15] your marriage maybe you go through
[1:46:16] bankruptcy maybe you go through a year
[1:46:18] without bus without work brother matt
[1:46:20] and guess what you don't come out bitter
[1:46:22] at the world you don't come out bitter
[1:46:24] at god amen your marriage worked its way
[1:46:26] through it your kids were happy most
[1:46:27] people would never have known that you
[1:46:29] went through such a trial because you
[1:46:30] came out so completely unchanged except
[1:46:32] that god took a couple things off of you
[1:46:34] that you went in with amen that's the
[1:46:36] kind of testimony that believers have as
[1:46:38] we walk through things that other people
[1:46:39] will be destroyed by and we come out and
[1:46:41] we're the better for it why because
[1:46:43] we've got to be purified and that's all
[1:46:44] those things are doing for us as it
[1:46:45] doesn't destroy us it destroys the
[1:46:47] things that we don't need and it leaves
[1:46:49] the purity of god within us amen
[1:46:52] when i was studying this
[1:46:55] what struck me
[1:46:57] is that we're inoculated with the holy
[1:46:58] spirit that's what brings us through
[1:47:00] those things you know we talk about
[1:47:00] vaccines and these different things now
[1:47:02] you know what takes you through that
[1:47:04] it's the vaccine of the holy spirit amen
[1:47:06] that allows you to go through trials and
[1:47:07] tribulations that would destroy mere
[1:47:09] humans and you come out and yet you're a
[1:47:11] better person because of it not a worse
[1:47:13] person amen
[1:47:14] when i was studying this service i was i
[1:47:16] was i searched the phrase real
[1:47:17] expression real experience in the
[1:47:19] message and you know what i found
[1:47:21] the most consistent or the most common
[1:47:23] factor of all those was a story that
[1:47:24] brother branham talks about when he's
[1:47:26] talking about hunting with bert remember
[1:47:28] the guy that had the the the mean eyes
[1:47:30] the the the slits for eyes and he just
[1:47:32] he he had no good things to say about
[1:47:34] bird as a man remember he said burt
[1:47:36] liked to shoot the babies
[1:47:38] right or the does
[1:47:40] and and and when he was doing that burt
[1:47:42] had made that special call if you
[1:47:44] remember that sounded just like a baby
[1:47:46] deer and what he was doing was trying to
[1:47:48] get a mother doe out there so he could
[1:47:50] shoot her because he knew brother
[1:47:51] branham hated it when he did it the only
[1:47:53] reason he was doing it was because he
[1:47:55] knew brother branham hated him doing it
[1:47:56] in the first place amen
[1:47:58] but
[1:47:59] so they're sitting there and they're
[1:48:00] taking a break
[1:48:01] and he just makes that call and what is
[1:48:03] it what does brother bram say he says a
[1:48:04] doe a mama dear she stands up
[1:48:07] and makes herself known makes her
[1:48:08] presence known he says in a time when
[1:48:10] they won't do that because they've been
[1:48:12] hunted so hard they know the pressure's
[1:48:13] on they know it's dangerous he says but
[1:48:15] she stood up and she just looked at us
[1:48:19] in full view
[1:48:20] he says and that
[1:48:22] is what made bert say lead me to this
[1:48:24] jesus you talking about
[1:48:26] what was it he saw somebody that was
[1:48:30] real an animal not even a human but he
[1:48:34] saw an animal that reacted to something
[1:48:37] that was within her and she put her life
[1:48:39] willingly on the line because greater
[1:48:41] was in her than what she would have
[1:48:43] wanted to do amen that's what the
[1:48:45] believer has it's something that's
[1:48:46] greater in us that'll put us in the line
[1:48:48] of fire that will put us willingly into
[1:48:50] a battle that'll put us willingly
[1:48:52] through a trial because we know that
[1:48:54] there's something in us that's forcing
[1:48:55] us to go through it amen and we
[1:48:57] willingly step into it but you know what
[1:48:59] struck me with all that
[1:49:00] that mother doe wasn't trying to be a
[1:49:02] hero
[1:49:04] she was just doing what was in her to do
[1:49:06] right she wasn't trying to stand out she
[1:49:08] wasn't trying to be special quite the
[1:49:09] opposite if she had her way she wouldn't
[1:49:11] have moved a muscle but something inside
[1:49:13] of her made her stand up and be counted
[1:49:15] because her baby needed her and that was
[1:49:17] more important than her life at that
[1:49:19] time amen she was just being what was
[1:49:21] inside her and she couldn't help it
[1:49:24] i want to bring one little one last
[1:49:25] thought here by way of a couple quotes
[1:49:27] and brother brahm says now we find out
[1:49:29] when paul got converted and had this
[1:49:31] real experience he was absolutely turned
[1:49:34] around
[1:49:35] and you know conversion means to be
[1:49:36] turned around you're going this way and
[1:49:38] you start and you turn back this way yes
[1:49:41] sir it's a turn around and about face
[1:49:43] and paul as soon as he was converted
[1:49:46] before he could ever make his experience
[1:49:49] now he had a marvelous experience now i
[1:49:51] believe when you accept christ just as
[1:49:53] your personal savior it's an experience
[1:49:56] i believe the joy of knowing your sin is
[1:49:58] forgiven just thrills your heart through
[1:50:00] and through
[1:50:01] but then when the blessed holy spirit
[1:50:04] comes down that's an experience that's a
[1:50:06] new birth that you'll never forget you
[1:50:08] become a child of god and here is what
[1:50:11] it does
[1:50:12] how do you know it brother branham he
[1:50:13] says now these are teaching lessons
[1:50:16] so you see after all it is the
[1:50:19] experience of passing from death to life
[1:50:22] now listen to this
[1:50:23] when all the old things die
[1:50:26] and all things become new
[1:50:29] christ becomes real
[1:50:32] you say brother john i'm seeking a
[1:50:33] greater reality in my life let the old
[1:50:35] things die
[1:50:37] what old things are you holding on to
[1:50:39] that are keeping the new things from
[1:50:40] coming through let the old things go
[1:50:42] that the new can grow
[1:50:44] the old things drop away the old roots
[1:50:47] of carnality you know how to dig a root
[1:50:49] out we used to take a grubbing hoe and
[1:50:50] just get down at it and dig it till
[1:50:53] there wasn't a speck left in it
[1:50:55] and they said if there be any root of
[1:50:56] bitterness spring up unto you grubber
[1:50:58] out
[1:50:59] he says that's right and that's what the
[1:51:01] holy spirit does is root out all the
[1:51:04] roots digs them out piles it up burn
[1:51:07] them get rid of them he says you got a
[1:51:09] good crop then if you do that
[1:51:11] but what you got to dig up all the old
[1:51:13] stuff you got get got to get rid of all
[1:51:15] the old stuff first amen but i wanted to
[1:51:17] stop here and say something because
[1:51:18] sometimes we forget we think we're in a
[1:51:20] message home
[1:51:22] and i'm speaking to the young people in
[1:51:23] particular we think well i'm a good kid
[1:51:26] i certainly thought that
[1:51:28] and then and we think well i've been
[1:51:30] listening to the message all my life and
[1:51:31] so i go and i get baptized and so i just
[1:51:34] continue on with my walk with god
[1:51:37] but the thing you have to remember is
[1:51:38] that you've been listening all those
[1:51:39] years without the holy ghost
[1:51:42] and so you come in with an idea of
[1:51:44] religion you're coming in with an idea
[1:51:45] of the relationship with god you come in
[1:51:47] with an idea of what it means to be a
[1:51:49] real christian you have an idea what it
[1:51:51] means to be this and that and the other
[1:51:52] thing listen i said it before i thought
[1:51:54] people in this church were hypocrites
[1:51:55] before i got saved
[1:51:57] why because satan is the accuser of the
[1:51:58] brethren and until i had the holy ghost
[1:52:00] then i was under the influence of satan
[1:52:01] most of the time wasn't i so i'd look at
[1:52:03] people and what would i see the hinder
[1:52:04] parts rather than the godly parts
[1:52:07] so it just depends where you're looking
[1:52:08] at
[1:52:09] amen but if we were all honest we'd say
[1:52:11] i'm a hypocrite i profess one thing and
[1:52:13] i do other things because paul did it so
[1:52:15] i'm gonna i'll put myself there with
[1:52:16] paul every time
[1:52:18] amen
[1:52:19] so what i could see was a hypocrite but
[1:52:21] i couldn't see a child of god
[1:52:23] but as soon as i get saved all of a
[1:52:25] sudden i'm so busy looking at myself
[1:52:27] that i don't see
[1:52:28] the failures in brother mark amen are
[1:52:30] the failures of brother david or the
[1:52:32] many failures in our pastor
[1:52:38] we all have many failures
[1:52:41] brother gerald can take that kind of
[1:52:42] talk that's why i said it amen
[1:52:45] but what is it is i had to have
[1:52:46] something happen and that's that the
[1:52:48] mind of christ had to be put in my head
[1:52:50] now and it had to be put as a filter in
[1:52:52] my heart so that everything that i
[1:52:54] thought now i don't throw it away but
[1:52:56] now i'm running it through a new filter
[1:52:58] and the filter is not jonathan corlett
[1:53:00] the religious boy the filter is now the
[1:53:02] mind of christ in me with the holy
[1:53:04] spirit running it through the word and
[1:53:06] so that completely changed the way i
[1:53:07] looked at people
[1:53:09] completely changed the way i looked at
[1:53:11] people and it made me look at myself a
[1:53:13] whole lot more and it made me look at
[1:53:14] people a whole lot less
[1:53:16] because when you do that you start to
[1:53:17] recognize that god's got to do a whole
[1:53:19] lot of work in you to get you into a
[1:53:21] place where you can go in a rapture not
[1:53:24] because you're good
[1:53:25] but because you've surrendered
[1:53:27] because he's cleaned you out because he
[1:53:29] can say you've got gold that's been
[1:53:30] tried in the fire you've got character
[1:53:32] of christ in your life amen
[1:53:34] so you still have to die this is what
[1:53:36] he's saying
[1:53:37] he's saying you can get baptized and you
[1:53:39] can have all your sins taken away and
[1:53:40] there's joy in that but he says that's
[1:53:42] not when the old things die it's when
[1:53:44] the holy ghost comes in and it roots out
[1:53:45] all of that stuff amen
[1:53:47] you can do the rest you can go
[1:53:48] justification that's baptism go out okay
[1:53:50] my sins are taken away sanctification
[1:53:52] clean up my life but until you get
[1:53:54] something that comes in and fills and
[1:53:55] does a real work of it
[1:53:57] then you're not going to get anywhere
[1:53:58] because you'll never dig deep enough
[1:54:00] compared to what the holy spirit will do
[1:54:02] in your life i mean if you've ever had
[1:54:03] something taken out you can say that
[1:54:05] with assurance that i didn't go far
[1:54:07] enough and it took god in my life to dig
[1:54:09] those things out to the point where i
[1:54:10] never had to deal with them again where
[1:54:12] i have a total and complete victory in
[1:54:13] my life over the things that used to
[1:54:14] drive me nuts and that that can happen
[1:54:17] 10 15 20 30 years into your relationship
[1:54:19] with god because he's constantly moving
[1:54:21] and digging moving and digging moving
[1:54:22] and digging opening doors cleaning them
[1:54:24] out going to the next door cleaning it
[1:54:26] out going to the next door cleaning it
[1:54:27] out so that what the fruit of the spirit
[1:54:29] can come out
[1:54:30] because otherwise what we do is we start
[1:54:32] on the same foundation as the rich young
[1:54:33] ruler says listen i've done everything
[1:54:36] but all he had was a church experience
[1:54:37] didn't he
[1:54:38] right the life the word is standing
[1:54:40] right there in front of him and he's
[1:54:42] done everything the word says but then
[1:54:43] the word stands in front of him and says
[1:54:44] do something you don't want to do and he
[1:54:46] says i can't do it
[1:54:49] the laodicean mindsets that they're rich
[1:54:51] increase with goods and have need of
[1:54:52] nothing spiritually
[1:54:55] spiritually we have it physically and i
[1:54:57] think we get caught up in that sometimes
[1:54:58] is the idea that well we have it all i
[1:55:00] have a car i have a house i have a good
[1:55:01] paying job i don't have a ton of debt to
[1:55:03] death to death that's not the lay of the
[1:55:05] seeing spirit that's been the spirit
[1:55:06] forever
[1:55:07] that's nothing new to laodicea but it's
[1:55:09] that they're spiritually
[1:55:11] you know
[1:55:11] they think they're spiritually rich
[1:55:13] amen and it's because they don't give
[1:55:16] themselves into the holy spirit amen
[1:55:18] as i've said before the prophet said in
[1:55:20] the in the church age book that the zeal
[1:55:22] of the laodicean church ages to repent
[1:55:24] and the thing is if you don't if you
[1:55:26] think you have it all what do you have a
[1:55:27] need to repent of
[1:55:29] that's the problem is if you think
[1:55:30] you've got it all if you think that
[1:55:32] you're all that in a bag of chips as we
[1:55:34] used to say if we're so busy admiring
[1:55:36] our christianity and then what are we
[1:55:38] going to repent of we're so busy
[1:55:39] admiring ourselves in the mirror that
[1:55:41] we're not looking in the mirror of god's
[1:55:42] word and saying whoa
[1:55:43] whoa
[1:55:44] that doesn't match up lord help me again
[1:55:47] amen what is it it's the epitome of
[1:55:49] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:55:51] the power thereof because the power that
[1:55:53] so many people are seeking starts first
[1:55:54] in your own life and secondly god will
[1:55:56] use it for other people's benefit amen
[1:55:58] think of paul paul pharisee the
[1:56:00] pharisees said unto camille listen if
[1:56:02] there was somebody that knew the word it
[1:56:03] was paul and yet as soon as he got
[1:56:05] converted he had to go to the desert for
[1:56:07] over three years so that the holy spirit
[1:56:09] could go and rearrange his mind to think
[1:56:11] the thoughts of god rather than pull it
[1:56:13] through his religious
[1:56:14] his religious life before that he was a
[1:56:16] great scholar of the scriptures already
[1:56:18] and yet the the holy spirit had to take
[1:56:19] him back there and teach him how to
[1:56:20] actually look at it god's way instead of
[1:56:22] his own way
[1:56:25] brother brahm says but when we
[1:56:27] not in an imaginary way but we prostrate
[1:56:29] ourselves before a living god a living
[1:56:32] virtue a living knowledge a living
[1:56:35] patience a living godliness a living
[1:56:37] power coming from a living god makes a
[1:56:40] living man a living image in the stature
[1:56:43] of god
[1:56:44] that's a lot of living in there
[1:56:46] living virtue that strength knowledge
[1:56:48] patience godliness and power coming from
[1:56:51] a living god makes a living man a living
[1:56:53] image in the image of god
[1:56:55] and the stature of god what's he doing
[1:56:57] the same things that jesus did walking
[1:56:59] the same way he walked doing the same
[1:57:01] things he did because it's not an
[1:57:03] imaginary thing there's a reality that's
[1:57:06] proven
[1:57:07] the thing that's been on my heart the
[1:57:08] thing i'm praying for is a greater
[1:57:10] reality in my life
[1:57:11] amen and i believe there's many others
[1:57:13] that have impr you know in conversation
[1:57:15] and fellowship
[1:57:16] i i think that there's a lot of us
[1:57:18] praying that way amen that we're looking
[1:57:19] for more of god and that more of god's
[1:57:21] got to start in our life before it
[1:57:23] starts working on the things that are
[1:57:24] external to us amen he's wanting more of
[1:57:27] us before he can act in the things that
[1:57:29] are in our life amen the situations
[1:57:30] we're in i'm not looking for great
[1:57:32] sermons
[1:57:33] i'd love to have i'd love to be a an
[1:57:35] amazing minister with tremendous sermons
[1:57:37] but the most important sermon that
[1:57:38] brother brown said we could ever live is
[1:57:40] that of a life
[1:57:41] of an overcomer amen we've got to be
[1:57:44] living sermons amen living voices as i
[1:57:46] as i read in a quote some time ago amen
[1:57:48] to where god can be expressed in every
[1:57:50] part of me that's what i'm looking for
[1:57:52] every part nothing held back
[1:57:55] listen to this as we start to close he
[1:57:56] says i tell you peter preached a sermon
[1:57:58] on the day of pentecost and three
[1:58:00] thousand souls were saved and the devil
[1:58:03] never even moved out of his bed
[1:58:06] this is the start of the the most
[1:58:08] powerful church
[1:58:10] up to the rapturing church in this age
[1:58:12] and he says the devil never even moved
[1:58:14] out of bed at that first instant
[1:58:16] three thousand souls saved the
[1:58:17] outpouring of the holy spirit he says
[1:58:19] and and the devil never moved
[1:58:21] that's right oh well let them alone see
[1:58:24] but he passed through the gate called
[1:58:26] beautiful the next day and healed a man
[1:58:28] and crippled from his mother's womb and
[1:58:30] all hell turned loose on him
[1:58:32] that's right he throwed him in the jail
[1:58:34] and kept him there overnight yes sir put
[1:58:36] him into prison the inner cell there
[1:58:38] because of the phenomenal the devil said
[1:58:40] i can't let this thing get started now
[1:58:42] to find healing if they do they will
[1:58:44] really knock my props out from under me
[1:58:47] that's right because i might fool them
[1:58:49] around with the little theology once in
[1:58:51] a while but i sure can't fool that real
[1:58:53] thing that comes out and people see it
[1:58:55] done i'll just stop this before that
[1:58:58] other group gets on the scene
[1:59:01] amen you're fighting for deliverance
[1:59:03] healing take note of this the devil
[1:59:05] doesn't care about the great sermons
[1:59:08] doesn't care like about the great
[1:59:10] sermons amen but he cares about people
[1:59:12] that throw him out of their lives
[1:59:15] first by your own obedience
[1:59:18] and second by the power of god amen
[1:59:20] that's all he cares about he doesn't
[1:59:23] care if you go to church every day of
[1:59:24] your life if me and brother joe preach
[1:59:26] three sermons a day three square meals
[1:59:28] right if we came every day three times a
[1:59:31] day
[1:59:32] he doesn't care a lick about that amen
[1:59:34] but he says when you throw him out of
[1:59:36] your life that's when he starts to care
[1:59:37] about it
[1:59:38] amen
[1:59:41] he says he never stopped it then and he
[1:59:44] can't stop it now that's right god's
[1:59:46] gospel will move on and on and on and on
[1:59:49] and when there's no more heavens or no
[1:59:50] more earth that word would still remain
[1:59:52] the same for heavens and earth will pass
[1:59:54] away but my words shall never pass away
[1:59:56] it can't pass away that word is just as
[1:59:59] immortal as god is himself it can't pass
[2:00:02] away and i believe every word of it all
[2:00:04] the things that jesus was he is now and
[2:00:07] always will be that's right he's the
[2:00:09] same yesterday today and forever
[2:00:14] he's praying this prayer and just once
[2:00:15] more he says god bring us back to the
[2:00:17] holy ghost and power and the
[2:00:19] manifestation of the word once more lord
[2:00:22] once more he says do you believe it lord
[2:00:24] god once more once more let me see the
[2:00:27] presence of jesus christ walking through
[2:00:29] the church let me see his power and his
[2:00:31] promise may manifest before us
[2:00:33] once more lord once more god be merciful
[2:00:37] and help us
[2:00:38] you see what these other things get us
[2:00:40] it drives away the nature of christ out
[2:00:42] of the congregation out of the church
[2:00:44] out away from this people we should be
[2:00:46] so
[2:00:47] woven together that there would be
[2:00:49] nothing separate us from this word and
[2:00:52] our love one for another
[2:00:55] jesus christ is here he is our father he
[2:00:58] is our mother he is my healer he is my
[2:01:00] king he is my god he is my life he is my
[2:01:04] joy he is my peace all that there is he
[2:01:07] is for me he is my all in all he is here
[2:01:10] now he wants to bring the church back to
[2:01:14] that place
[2:01:16] he says here the person
[2:01:18] christ jesus produces the real thing and
[2:01:22] keeps that person secured in christ
[2:01:25] until he comes
[2:01:27] the person christ jesus that means he's
[2:01:30] personal
[2:01:31] amen right it's not the person to a
[2:01:34] group it's a person to a person
[2:01:36] i mean it's something that comes down
[2:01:38] personal to you it's not just doctrines
[2:01:39] i mean it's not just sermons it's not
[2:01:41] just messages by a prophet but it's a
[2:01:43] bridegroom himself stepping into your
[2:01:45] life and drawing you close to him and
[2:01:47] changing you growing you stretching you
[2:01:49] healing you delivering you leading you
[2:01:51] guiding you encouraging you correcting
[2:01:53] you restoring you redeeming you back to
[2:01:55] what he saw before time even began
[2:01:58] and then god's not wanting to stay on
[2:02:00] the pages of our bibles
[2:02:01] amen that kills
[2:02:03] the letter kills but the spirit is what
[2:02:05] gives life amen and he wants to live
[2:02:06] what in the fleshly tables of our hearts
[2:02:09] where we live him and breathe him and
[2:02:10] we're in expectation for brother brother
[2:02:12] braham says it was that wonderful
[2:02:14] victorious life was to know that his
[2:02:15] presence is with you always not when you
[2:02:18] feel it
[2:02:19] or not only when you feel it but because
[2:02:21] you have that holy spirit inside of you
[2:02:23] that he is always there and with you
[2:02:25] when you have a need amen
[2:02:27] i was talking to my wife
[2:02:29] a while back and
[2:02:31] and i was saying i don't know what
[2:02:33] people's lives are like when it comes to
[2:02:35] their walk with god and
[2:02:37] take this
[2:02:38] this is no ego here
[2:02:40] but i said it brother gerald you were
[2:02:41] talking about it over the surface the
[2:02:43] other day
[2:02:44] and you said you know when you're in
[2:02:45] your car you're thinking about him and
[2:02:47] when you're walking down the street
[2:02:49] you're thinking about him and when
[2:02:51] you're sitting and this and that and the
[2:02:52] other thing and sometimes at the oddest
[2:02:53] of times that's exactly what's happening
[2:02:56] is that what there's god that's trying
[2:02:57] to deal with us
[2:02:59] and all he's looking for us to do is get
[2:03:00] the distractions away and then turn the
[2:03:03] screens off turn the phone off get away
[2:03:05] for a little bit and just dwell with him
[2:03:07] that's all he's looking for you know
[2:03:08] what he rarely comes to me when i've got
[2:03:10] things buzzing in my head
[2:03:12] but if i can just be quiet
[2:03:14] driving in my car music no music it
[2:03:17] doesn't matter if i'm in a spirit of
[2:03:18] worship you know what he draws near
[2:03:21] right if i'm just listening for
[2:03:23] entertainment guess what that doesn't
[2:03:24] bring god on the scene but if i'm in a
[2:03:26] spirit of worship if i'm listening to
[2:03:28] the right things if i'm playing the
[2:03:30] right things if i'm doing those right
[2:03:31] things if i'm clearing out the clutter
[2:03:33] then what happens is he can draw so
[2:03:34] clear so fast right he just draws in
[2:03:37] close because there's nothing there to
[2:03:38] get between you
[2:03:40] right remember brother branham talked
[2:03:41] about he says the crying of a baby could
[2:03:43] cause the holy spirit to not be present
[2:03:46] what things do we have in our life so
[2:03:47] often that would push that dove of the
[2:03:49] holy spirit away
[2:03:52] because we want this reality
[2:03:54] but are we setting ourselves up for the
[2:03:55] reality david was there by obedience
[2:03:58] amen and that's the first thing that
[2:04:00] we're supposed to do is obey
[2:04:02] right separate ourselves and be in
[2:04:04] obedience to that word every single time
[2:04:06] amen how do you make them your god put
[2:04:08] them first
[2:04:10] he's only your god if he's first if he's
[2:04:12] second then he's not your god
[2:04:14] because god is first and foremost the
[2:04:15] object of worship he's the preeminence
[2:04:17] in your life amen and if he's not first
[2:04:19] then how can he be your god scripture
[2:04:21] says seek ye first the kingdom of god
[2:04:23] you know talking with joe about his
[2:04:24] business he's had to learn that you got
[2:04:26] to seek god first
[2:04:28] in in my schooling i remember i would
[2:04:30] never miss a service didn't matter how
[2:04:32] many exams i had the next day i wouldn't
[2:04:34] miss a service because if i'd done my
[2:04:36] part i knew that he would do the part to
[2:04:38] get me through that exam the next day
[2:04:40] amen why it's putting the kingdom of god
[2:04:42] first it's giving him the opportunity to
[2:04:44] actually step into my life so often
[2:04:46] we're sitting there and we've got our
[2:04:47] life so jam-packed and we're saying god
[2:04:50] come and show yourself real and he's
[2:04:51] saying where
[2:04:53] that you've got no room for me you've
[2:04:55] got no room for me and so it's half the
[2:04:56] time he's got to give you a a beating of
[2:04:58] a trial just to get you to give him some
[2:05:00] room to get you desperate enough to push
[2:05:02] something out of your life to allow him
[2:05:04] in there to make himself a little more
[2:05:05] real into your life
[2:05:06] now he's going to do trials and
[2:05:08] tribulations come no matter what we know
[2:05:09] that
[2:05:10] and that's the grace of god as we read
[2:05:12] amen but the idea is to is to allow him
[2:05:14] the place not to have him force the
[2:05:16] place into your life amen
[2:05:18] i found for me if he's not being
[2:05:20] personal it's because i'm not listening
[2:05:22] i'm not honest
[2:05:24] or i think it's a man speaking instead
[2:05:25] of my pastor
[2:05:27] right
[2:05:28] because he's given us a five-fold
[2:05:29] ministry for the perfecting of the
[2:05:31] saints and he's given us a word that'll
[2:05:33] do the work if we'll listen so the only
[2:05:35] thing that often will hold me back aside
[2:05:36] from that is when i think i'm more than
[2:05:38] i'm not or i'm unwilling to to allow
[2:05:41] myself the possibility that i might have
[2:05:44] some work left in my life to do amen
[2:05:47] what is it i love the sermons where it
[2:05:49] seems like god's just talking to me
[2:05:52] you know why
[2:05:54] one shows he cares amen when god comes
[2:05:57] in and he touches that little or big
[2:06:00] spot in your life and he just goes right
[2:06:01] there for a little bit
[2:06:03] you say ow
[2:06:06] ow
[2:06:07] ow
[2:06:10] and you know that minister knows nothing
[2:06:11] about it
[2:06:12] that's the best sermon because you know
[2:06:14] that god is moving on your behalf and
[2:06:15] that service do what try and get you to
[2:06:17] a place where he can use you amen
[2:06:19] i think people give the ministry more
[2:06:23] more than they deserve many times they
[2:06:24] think we know things and we really don't
[2:06:26] have a clue
[2:06:28] as in we don't have a clue by knowledge
[2:06:30] in that sense amen
[2:06:31] but the other thing that i love about
[2:06:33] that is when he ever comes my way he's
[2:06:34] always calling me higher i mean let's
[2:06:37] stand as i just start to close here
[2:06:38] whenever he comes my way he always calls
[2:06:40] me higher man he doesn't put me down
[2:06:43] and then it's satan that puts you down
[2:06:45] isn't it it's satan that puts you down
[2:06:46] without a way to come back up but all
[2:06:48] god's saying is if you'll let this go i
[2:06:50] can take you further i mean if you can
[2:06:52] open up your life i can take you further
[2:06:54] if you'll just trust me i can show you a
[2:06:56] greater reality but as long as you cling
[2:06:57] and hold to things so tightly i can't do
[2:07:00] anything with you amen
[2:07:01] it's like we talked about that that old
[2:07:04] wine and new vessels you can't do that
[2:07:06] your your experience has to grow with
[2:07:08] you and then you i can't jump up to
[2:07:10] brother mark's level i can't jump up to
[2:07:11] brother uh gerald's level i can't jump
[2:07:13] up to brother bob's level i've got to go
[2:07:15] through it the way everybody else does
[2:07:17] and that's by a life experience where
[2:07:18] god can grow and change me in those
[2:07:20] things amen it's not this doctrinal
[2:07:22] checklist we're not going to make a
[2:07:23] rapture because we believe serpent seed
[2:07:25] and because we believe godhead and
[2:07:26] because we believe this and that the
[2:07:28] other thing that's got to be there and
[2:07:29] it's got to be a part of it and we'll
[2:07:30] get into that in the next service lord
[2:07:32] willing as to why it had to be there but
[2:07:34] he's looking for a people that will
[2:07:35] surrender themselves fully to his word
[2:07:37] and step out in faith and just watch him
[2:07:39] meet it amen that's the reality of god
[2:07:42] that i'm looking for is where i say lord
[2:07:44] i believe and he says then i'll do it
[2:07:47] that's all we're looking for
[2:07:48] because listen we're not going to take a
[2:07:49] rapture of our own making
[2:07:51] we're not going to heal ourselves we're
[2:07:53] not gonna make ourselves better people
[2:07:54] because we decide to do it in man it
[2:07:56] takes a working of god my wife and i
[2:07:58] were talking the other day and
[2:08:00] we had our 21st anniversary as many of
[2:08:02] you know and
[2:08:03] and we're we're at the meal and she said
[2:08:04] you know
[2:08:05] it was around the time i was 30 years
[2:08:07] old she says you know what
[2:08:09] she said i really felt that was where
[2:08:10] you being so disciplined kicked in
[2:08:12] because you made such a a big shift
[2:08:14] there and some certain things in our
[2:08:15] marriage and i said that wasn't
[2:08:17] discipline i said if it was discipline i
[2:08:19] would have done it a long time ago in
[2:08:20] all probability but god had to make a
[2:08:22] change in my life
[2:08:24] and i said the only way i could ever do
[2:08:25] that is make is have him make the change
[2:08:27] because i can't decide to make a change
[2:08:28] in my life i can make myself more
[2:08:30] romantic by booking things into this
[2:08:32] schedule as we talked about
[2:08:34] right but that doesn't change me that
[2:08:37] just gives me some things to make her
[2:08:39] feel better amen and these different
[2:08:40] things but god had to do a work in me
[2:08:42] and that had to start with me saying i
[2:08:44] don't have what i need to have i need to
[2:08:46] step up to a higher plane i need a
[2:08:48] greater experience i need a greater
[2:08:49] surrender i need some rooting done in my
[2:08:51] life i mean i need the holy spirit to go
[2:08:53] in and pull some things out so that god
[2:08:55] can plant something that'll bring some
[2:08:56] real fruit in my life amen that's a
[2:08:58] humbling experience to do that but it's
[2:09:00] the only way to know god is to let him
[2:09:02] actually do something so often i find
[2:09:04] that we resist in order to stay where
[2:09:06] we're at
[2:09:08] what kind of sense does that make we sit
[2:09:10] here and we're halfway off times on
[2:09:12] something we're halfway to surrender and
[2:09:14] we're we're halfway to holding onto the
[2:09:15] wheel and all we've got is a battle
[2:09:16] going on and where are we going nowhere
[2:09:19] we're fighting to stay where we're at
[2:09:21] and all he's saying is let go
[2:09:23] just let go and see where god can take
[2:09:24] you amen
[2:09:26] amen let's bow our heads together
[2:09:30] heavenly father lord i pour my heart out
[2:09:32] this evening
[2:09:33] lord for you see the prayer of my heart
[2:09:36] lord i believe it's the the prayer of
[2:09:38] the heart of every believer that's here
[2:09:39] this evening lord is that they want a
[2:09:41] greater reality of you in their life
[2:09:43] heavenly father
[2:09:45] and lord i believe many of us have had
[2:09:46] experiences many experiences lord
[2:09:49] but we can say you are my god amen lord
[2:09:52] i believe that without a doubt i can
[2:09:54] raise my hand and say lord that you have
