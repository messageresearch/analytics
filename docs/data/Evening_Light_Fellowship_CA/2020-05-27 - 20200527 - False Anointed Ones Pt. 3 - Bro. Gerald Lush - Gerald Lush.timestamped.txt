[46:03] empty a man and what we're left with the
[46:06] impression that the building is full
[46:07] when it's not a man thank God that the
[46:12] recording is on the right side not on
[46:15] the wrong side
[46:16] Amen not on the left because the seats
[46:19] are empty amen this is amazing so every
[46:22] time we need to be impress it's in this
[46:25] time while all these things are going on
[46:27] and pray the grace of God for the for
[46:31] the bride the grace of God for the sons
[46:33] and daughters of God the grace of God
[46:35] for the elect well you see we're
[46:38] brothers you know this is this is for
[46:40] believers you know and it starts to test
[46:43] our faith yeah it does
[46:45] test test our faith but again you go
[46:49] back 2,000 years ago when the Holy Ghost
[46:52] fell on the day of Pentecost and the
[46:53] church in the first stage where the
[46:55] Bible says they went from house to house
[46:57] and they gathered and fellowship but
[47:00] we're not allowed to do that you know
[47:02] really loud just a few here in the in
[47:04] the in the congregation a few in the in
[47:07] the in the church and we're not allowed
[47:09] even to go and fellowship one with
[47:11] another you know just maybe two families
[47:13] are together or whatever and and so on
[47:16] so brother as is the test of our faith
[47:18] alright let's see if we're going to
[47:20] maintain our faith stay with the word
[47:22] and he-man stay with the promise of God
[47:24] and say well I believe so I'm not going
[47:27] to let the devil deceive me I'm not
[47:29] gonna let the devil hinder me I'm gonna
[47:31] keep pressing on a man and force I guess
[47:35] for some it's it's a lonely existence
[47:37] because you're you know you don't have
[47:39] the fellowship you don't have you're not
[47:41] ain't not allowed to go here go there no
[47:43] no not by any means so but we pray the
[47:46] grace of God be with us and take us
[47:48] through this trial amen the grace of God
[47:51] be with us and help us brother and again
[47:54] brother and you know again God is God is
[47:57] testing our faith God is testing our
[47:59] hunger and our thirst for him God is
[48:02] testing our thirst for our thirst for
[48:05] for the word our hunger thirst for
[48:07] fellowship a man are longer thirst
[48:10] for Jesus a man that's that's exactly
[48:12] the truth because if you hunger thirst
[48:15] for Jesus you want to get together with
[48:17] the body of Jesus by the grace of God so
[48:20] brother God God sees our faith and God
[48:23] sees our actions and our reactions to to
[48:25] what's going on in the world concerning
[48:27] this guest to call it pandemic and so on
[48:31] and it's amazing yeah it's amazing I
[48:34] guess it's not something that we were
[48:35] really expecting but maybe it's could be
[48:38] something that the prophet of God would
[48:40] it would have told us he knew that there
[48:42] was things going to happen but he said
[48:45] it will be in my heart he said when I go
[48:46] to my grave he wouldn't tell us he would
[48:49] tell us this was going to happen that
[48:50] was going to happen and what else is
[48:52] going to happen well there's going to be
[48:54] other things happen in the world too but
[48:56] it's going to test your faith to see if
[48:59] you're going to stay with the word a man
[49:01] and and the prophet of God did say the
[49:04] hour is coming when we won't be allowed
[49:06] he said to pray for the sick we won't be
[49:09] allowed to do this won't be allowed to
[49:10] do that
[49:11] so we pray the grace of God to help us
[49:13] amen to stay with the word and there's
[49:18] something somewhere a prophecy
[49:20] concerning that you know we might be out
[49:22] there in the street somewhere in a
[49:24] corner to to to fellowship or the
[49:27] minister or to do this or to do that
[49:29] yeah so I pray the grace of God give us
[49:32] his wisdom and his anointing rather an
[49:35] hour that we need is anointing it's now
[49:37] and listen this is not 10 years ago this
[49:41] is not 30 40 50 I can guarantee that
[49:44] because that anointing that was in the
[49:47] atmosphere then is not in the atmosphere
[49:49] now brother because it has been narrowed
[49:51] down and narrowed down to where to our
[49:54] hearts the anointing in our hearts this
[49:57] is what's going to keep us moving back
[49:59] back years ago the anointing way oh yeah
[50:02] Luther had in his heart but it was also
[50:04] in the atmosphere a man if you walked
[50:07] into Luther's and lose his presence you
[50:09] would feel the anointing a man not just
[50:11] Luther was feeling it you you would
[50:13] sense it and was all around everywhere
[50:15] and this is how that John Wesley came to
[50:17] what he did revelation that God gave him
[50:19] because II was in a Martin Luther
[50:23] cottage meeting he was yes he was and
[50:26] there was a brother preaching that
[50:28] believed what Martin Luther preached
[50:30] Martin Luther had gone home and now here
[50:33] was John Wesley the next messenger
[50:35] rising on the scene and he needed a
[50:37] revelation hey oh yeah he believed this
[50:40] need believe that and like Martin Luther
[50:41] he was what he was doing his works you
[50:43] know Martin Luther believed if he if he
[50:45] did this did that did that he'd be
[50:47] justified and to finally got the
[50:49] revelation that he justified by faith in
[50:51] Jesus Christ and Christ justified him a
[50:54] man always struck Martin Luther or what
[50:57] a revelation a man that he had and so in
[51:00] a Martin Luther cottage meeting a man
[51:03] and brother that's where I got a lot of
[51:04] revelation with in a cottage meeting and
[51:06] Martin Luther was in a cottage minion oh
[51:08] yeah and and the brother was preaching
[51:11] and just just as justified by faith and
[51:13] that's where it struck Martin Luther he
[51:16] was sanctified by faith because like
[51:19] Luther John John Wesley and then the
[51:21] Methodists they were would do he works
[51:23] or if I were if I do this if I do that
[51:26] and I do that I'll be just I'll be
[51:27] sanctified oh yeah I'll be sanctified
[51:29] and uh finally he was there and he was
[51:32] worse with me and he was stood up and
[51:34] and he was hearing the word and and it
[51:37] finally struck him or justified by thing
[51:39] I'm sanctified by faith
[51:41] it's my pain and it went as I said it
[51:44] went from the crown of his head right to
[51:45] the soles of his feet he found that
[51:47] anointing moving not just and I was
[51:51] really not just in him now
[51:53] but it was in the audience it was in the
[51:54] in in the atmosphere oh yeah in the
[51:57] cottage amen and the anointing was on
[51:59] the preacher it was on on the others
[52:01] there and it was on John Wesley
[52:03] and he finally struck him I'm sanctified
[52:06] by faith a man and he went forth with
[52:10] the revelation for that for that church
[52:12] age praise the name of the Lord so
[52:15] brother the the anointing is with us the
[52:19] anointing in us I pray grace and now as
[52:22] I said more and more the anointing was
[52:23] with them there did not just in them but
[52:26] it was with them they had that power at
[52:28] the end that anointing and those that
[52:29] met them they they they if they were
[52:32] believers and they were they had any
[52:34] Christian experience they would know
[52:36] oh there's something about that Martin
[52:38] Luther there's something about John
[52:39] Wesley there's something about the
[52:40] Methodists there's something about the
[52:42] Lutheran's those that believed and had
[52:44] received that faith there was an
[52:46] anointing in them and it was all around
[52:49] them they created an atmosphere they
[52:52] created an atmosphere and brother it was
[52:54] a time when believers used to create an
[52:56] atmosphere but not so much now as it
[52:59] used to be all mine we go into a into a
[53:02] cottage meeting we go and meet brothers
[53:03] and sisters just in their homes and
[53:05] fellowship with them
[53:06] there was an anointing there as I said
[53:09] when we first came to this message even
[53:11] when I went to be or maybe in 1970 or 71
[53:14] and I went to Bjorn - to our 1969 dude
[53:19] because why because sister Golding was
[53:21] witnessing to family and friends in Bern
[53:25] concerning the message of the hour and
[53:27] they caller said what's this all about
[53:29] you know and she sent them the message
[53:32] of the spoken word message of the
[53:33] prophet a man certain messages to her
[53:37] sister and her brother-in-law and and
[53:40] what did he do did he read it no he
[53:42] didn't read it just listen amen god help
[53:45] us a man and what did he do with it well
[53:48] he went into his what we would call a
[53:50] while I don't know what it was in his
[53:52] kitchen and off the kitchen there was
[53:54] the cupboards and where they would wash
[53:56] their dishes and everything and where
[53:58] they put their food and there was a
[54:00] window there and above the window there
[54:02] was a shelf yeah and he took those books
[54:06] that Citra Kolya said them the spoken
[54:08] word books and he laid them up on top of
[54:10] the shelf and he didn't read them he
[54:13] just looked at the Oh william branham
[54:15] and and then maybe the titles of the
[54:17] message and left him there yeah but how
[54:20] did he get to the revelation of it well
[54:22] he had a border that it that was living
[54:26] with him and I guess attending the not
[54:29] dear it's a college a college there
[54:33] tending a college and and he was he was
[54:36] bordering paying to stay at brother
[54:38] Smiths and he was Pentecostal and any I
[54:43] think he was going on to eventually a
[54:45] Pentecostal pastor but err he was and he
[54:48] was
[54:49] at the sink there and he was washing
[54:50] something and he looked up and he saw
[54:52] the books and so he took the books down
[54:54] he looked at it william branham oh no
[55:00] their of their followers are William
[55:02] Brennan you know more about William
[55:04] Brown then then our then our brother or
[55:06] sister Smith did at the time a man and
[55:09] he so he went in there that's what
[55:10] happened he went in a report on it that
[55:13] they were followers of William Branham
[55:14] because they were getting together they
[55:16] were having cottage meetings but not
[55:18] listen you do with him random they were
[55:19] listening to Jack Cole they're listening
[55:22] to Jack Cole's records yeah it may it's
[55:25] absolutely amazing just here little the
[55:27] Lord just to give this witness and give
[55:29] this testimony and so when they got
[55:32] together for a cottage meeting and with
[55:34] brother Charlie and he went on when he
[55:38] was only 33 when he went on to be with
[55:40] the Lord and they were having cottage
[55:42] means in his love and listening to
[55:44] listening to say Jack Jo was Jack Cole
[55:52] listen to him on record listen to my
[55:55] records and and they and that this this
[55:58] young brother thought it was listening
[56:00] to Elam brain'll and he went and
[56:01] reported it and said they were message
[56:03] believers and they believe William
[56:05] Branham and they were gathering together
[56:07] and cottage meetings and listening to
[56:08] Willie rattle but it was Jack Cole and
[56:11] brother and of course they attended the
[56:13] same Pentecostal church and of course
[56:16] that's when they called they called a
[56:18] special meeting and they called brother
[56:20] and sister Smith and three or four other
[56:23] those are the Saints they're all gone on
[56:26] now and they called him in into this
[56:29] special meeting and oh they were shocked
[56:32] when when they when they were being
[56:35] judged for following the message of
[56:37] William Branham and they didn't they
[56:39] didn't know about William Branham they
[56:41] didn't know what he was teaching they
[56:43] didn't know these things yeah but there
[56:45] but they just asked brother brother
[56:48] Smith one question and they said brother
[56:50] Smith and he said yes sir and he stood
[56:55] up and he said got one question okay
[56:58] said he said do you believe in the
[57:00] Trinity
[57:01] and he thought they were believing
[57:03] brother Brown was teaching on to Trinity
[57:05] but they didn't know what william
[57:06] branham taught they had no idea and he
[57:09] said Willie so I believe the Bible he
[57:11] said the Father the Son the Holy Ghost
[57:13] and he said these three are one and so
[57:16] on so he says what I believe so and oh
[57:19] they they're you're this you're that
[57:21] well eventually before the surf was over
[57:23] they were put out of the church because
[57:25] they took their stand for the word even
[57:27] though they didn't realize it was
[57:29] William Branham but they took their
[57:31] stand for the word and after that
[57:33] brothers sister they went back to the
[57:35] message and God it's hard to get into
[57:38] the message and they called sister
[57:40] Goldie and they said what's this message
[57:42] all about we like to know because we
[57:45] just been kicked out of the church for
[57:46] it and they were for that of the church
[57:50] for it and and and and there was of
[57:53] course sister Donna was there too at
[57:54] that meeting and there was a brother
[57:57] Brown there and he's gone on for many
[58:00] years now and he was at that meeting and
[58:02] our brother sister brush it and they
[58:05] were at that meeting so we thank God the
[58:09] EEC God God does it one way we do it
[58:11] another but we got we got a we got a we
[58:14] got to know God's ways and his ways are
[58:17] he's no wonder God said my ways are not
[58:19] yours and he said my thoughts not yours
[58:21] and so on it's right as I as the heavens
[58:23] are above the earth so are my ways and
[58:25] thoughts above yours and that's the
[58:27] truth that exactly the truth brother and
[58:30] God proved it in calling out our brother
[58:32] and sister Smith and the Buren
[58:34] fellowship at the time God proved it in
[58:36] calling us out him in in gamble oh yeah
[58:38] because he even even even in gamble
[58:42] brother they weren't really following
[58:44] the message with a random when they were
[58:46] put out of Pentecost they were
[58:48] nondenominational they were following
[58:50] people like a a alan and TL Osborn and
[58:52] so on and they were question concerning
[58:55] the faith and what they believe you
[58:57] don't believe this you know but had they
[58:58] said no we don't believe in
[58:59] denominations no anyway that when they
[59:02] came out of that they finally came to
[59:05] the message not long after that oh yeah
[59:07] someone someone mentioned him but
[59:10] William Brenda Oh what did William
[59:11] Graham say and that's and all
[59:14] triggered it triggered their faith and
[59:16] they got into the message by the grace
[59:18] of God see God's ways are not our ways
[59:21] see God I got out of God out of purpose
[59:24] in bringing them out of denomination to
[59:27] bring them into the message amen he
[59:29] didn't bring into the message and out of
[59:31] denomination he brought him out of
[59:33] denomination into the message by the
[59:35] grace of God so it's absolutely amazing
[59:37] what God does and how God does it amen
[59:41] oh yeah and and even did there's others
[59:45] too I know another sister that's gone on
[59:47] god rest her soul god bless her a man
[59:50] and she case she was she left Pentecost
[59:53] come to them G and leave it they put her
[59:55] out and again there wasn't B she didn't
[59:58] come with many costs because he didn't
[59:59] come to the message because all I saw
[1:00:01] the message so I'll leave denomination
[1:00:03] no no she saw things in denomination
[1:00:06] that she knew wasn't right and it wasn't
[1:00:08] the Lord a man it was she said this is
[1:00:11] not the way God does things I don't
[1:00:13] agree with this and she tried to stop it
[1:00:15] but they voted her out and she was a
[1:00:19] neighbor of mr. burns and a man and she
[1:00:24] came from set came to visit sister Birds
[1:00:26] and she was she was sorted down and
[1:00:28] sister Burns was there to encourage her
[1:00:30] not to press the message on her just to
[1:00:32] encourage her that's all right sister
[1:00:34] God is not in in in that no more and so
[1:00:37] on God is in his word
[1:00:39] oh and sister the sister said oh why did
[1:00:44] what do you mean and she began to
[1:00:46] explain things to her and that opened
[1:00:48] her heart and soul to the word and she
[1:00:51] came to the message well I believe that
[1:00:53] she said he's right amen brother Branham
[1:00:56] is right she said I agree with it even
[1:00:59] though she was she put she was put out
[1:01:01] why because of her stand for the word
[1:01:04] but not the message at the time but she
[1:01:07] came to the message after a man and she
[1:01:10] and the Lord took her on few years later
[1:01:13] she was with us in the cottage meetings
[1:01:15] worshipping and praising God a man and
[1:01:18] and she was diagnosed where the cancer
[1:01:21] going to die and
[1:01:23] brother Manuel was preaching there one
[1:01:25] time and he and he made reference to it
[1:01:27] and touched on it that's regarding our
[1:01:31] sister there was going to die and he and
[1:01:35] he he felt you know maybe that after
[1:01:38] that maybe it was hard for him to say
[1:01:40] what he said or to highlight it and
[1:01:41] maybe thin not thinking that she knew
[1:01:43] about it and I don't think she did and
[1:01:45] he said I didn't mean to do this that's
[1:01:48] certain
[1:01:48] brother she said listen she said death
[1:01:50] has no terrorist to the blood but one
[1:01:52] that was her faith a man I remember now
[1:01:56] when she was sitting behind me in the
[1:01:58] cottage meaning to God be the glory
[1:02:00] so brother God give us faith God
[1:02:03] increase our faith by his word God
[1:02:06] increased our faith by his message amen
[1:02:08] brother he brought me from one to
[1:02:10] another to Pentecost or from Pentecost
[1:02:12] to the message a man
[1:02:13] well this God doing why are we here
[1:02:15] tonight where are the others listening
[1:02:17] online to the message tonight why is
[1:02:20] because God has increased our faith a
[1:02:22] man we went from faith to faith the
[1:02:24] faith to greater faith in a greater
[1:02:26] faith and now that we're even and go
[1:02:28] what going from one one church to
[1:02:29] another Church to another Church to the
[1:02:31] message of the hour and now in the
[1:02:33] message we're going from faith to faith
[1:02:35] to faith a man God is increasing our
[1:02:38] faith by the grace of God because we got
[1:02:41] to go move on to a greater faith we got
[1:02:44] to move on to a resurrection enrapturing
[1:02:46] faith brothers ever of faith that God is
[1:02:48] looking for in this hour he's living for
[1:02:50] the faith in the resurrection he's
[1:02:52] looking for the faith in the rapture do
[1:02:54] we believe it amen
[1:02:56] that's the thing that God wants a mad
[1:02:58] house should be confessing that's the
[1:03:00] thing that God wants us to be putting
[1:03:02] the emphasis on it's not just a message
[1:03:04] of the hour of this doctor of the
[1:03:05] adoption but the resurrection and the
[1:03:08] rapture is two getting out of here by
[1:03:10] the grace of God amen
[1:03:12] this not list not what's going on in the
[1:03:15] world today don't let that get our get
[1:03:17] our attention to the extent that it's
[1:03:19] going to it's going to pull us away from
[1:03:21] what God wants us to focus on amen
[1:03:24] no matter what's going on in the world
[1:03:25] let's keep our focus on the resurrection
[1:03:28] and the rapture amen
[1:03:30] no matter how much the devil is trying
[1:03:32] to do to distract us from this
[1:03:34] revelation let's stay
[1:03:36] with the word and let's stay with the
[1:03:39] purpose that God is working out in you
[1:03:42] and me and brother we know what he was
[1:03:44] working out in Luther and Wesley and the
[1:03:46] Pentecostals and other churches what's
[1:03:49] he working out in you and me it's the
[1:03:50] resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:03:53] because it may men that our testimony be
[1:03:56] thus so that there will be a generation
[1:03:58] left behind that's going to say I
[1:04:00] thought there was to be a rapture it
[1:04:02] already happened they didn't know it
[1:04:03] I trust by the grace of God that they'll
[1:04:06] miss you and me a man that you and me we
[1:04:09] won't be here because we'll be gone in

[1:17:12] Oh
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:35] Oh
[1:17:48] a my bridge the name of the Lord god
[1:17:51] bless his turn with me to Revelation
[1:17:53] chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 and we'll
[1:17:59] read the scripture and the explanation
[1:18:02] of what brought the church to this time
[1:18:05] of anointed ones at the end time a man
[1:18:11] what did the Anointed One said the end
[1:18:13] time produce what was the church what
[1:18:18] was their spirit a man what was their
[1:18:22] action their reaction so we pray the
[1:18:25] grace of God to give us understanding a
[1:18:27] man and the Lord Williams have already
[1:18:31] been maybe hour a half an hour or so
[1:18:35] will see us see whether where the Lord
[1:18:36] will lead us into trying to get some
[1:18:39] thoughts as I said that the Prophet
[1:18:41] Express in the message the anointing
[1:18:42] once at the end time and to give us the
[1:18:44] true understanding and to put us on our
[1:18:47] guard and I think that if there's any
[1:18:49] message again that the Prophet preached
[1:18:52] to put us on our guard it would be in
[1:18:54] the anointing once at the end time a man
[1:18:56] so we're not just going to go go by the
[1:18:58] anointing and say that brother is
[1:19:00] anointed that sister is anointed so I'll
[1:19:02] believe there I believe that part
[1:19:04] brother that sister and I'll just I'll
[1:19:07] follow them and I believe what they say
[1:19:09] and so I know we got to judge all those
[1:19:12] things by the word amen bring it back to
[1:19:15] the world and when we witnessed the
[1:19:17] anointing let's make sure that the
[1:19:19] anointing is going to be in agreement
[1:19:21] with the Word of God a man grace of God
[1:19:24] are not be with us and in Revelation
[1:19:28] chapter 3 and verse 14 and unto the
[1:19:33] Angel of the Church of the lauda seon's
[1:19:35] write these things saith the Amen the
[1:19:41] faithful and true witness a man not a
[1:19:45] false witness but the faithful and true
[1:19:49] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:19:52] God a man I know thy works God knows our
[1:19:58] works will trust my grace that is my
[1:20:01] faith
[1:20:02] that pleases God a man that your works
[1:20:05] my works is based on a faith that
[1:20:08] pleases God a man that were not false
[1:20:12] anointed ones but they are true anointed
[1:20:18] once a man and again we know that even
[1:20:21] the false enlightened ones ahead has got
[1:20:23] a genuine only ghost anointing but a
[1:20:26] false teaching
[1:20:27] so buddy if you were if you're a true a
[1:20:29] ninety-one you got the true teaching of
[1:20:31] the word of God a man you're going to
[1:20:34] reflect the word I know thy works that
[1:20:38] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[1:20:43] thou wert cold or odd but they're
[1:20:45] lukewarm yeah because they're in the
[1:20:48] middle the grace of God that we're not
[1:20:52] in the middle and we're not cold but
[1:20:55] grace of God that were hot filled with
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] a man so then because thou art lukewarm
[1:21:03] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:21:07] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[1:21:12] rich and increased with Goods and have
[1:21:16] need of nothing and knowest not that
[1:21:20] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[1:21:24] and blind and naked is amazing amazing
[1:21:30] that they could be in that condition oh
[1:21:34] yeah
[1:21:35] and here is the a man of God the
[1:21:38] faithful and true witness bearing
[1:21:39] witness to them concerning himself and
[1:21:44] his word because I sensed oh I'm rich
[1:21:49] and increased with Goods I got need of
[1:21:51] nothing and he said but they don't know
[1:21:53] that they are wretched and miserable and
[1:21:56] poor and blind and naked god forbid that
[1:21:59] we should get to that place god forbid
[1:22:02] that we should be in that person in that
[1:22:04] condition a man although we think we're
[1:22:07] in the word we think we're in the
[1:22:08] message we but again like the prophets
[1:22:11] Edgar the message is not in you a man
[1:22:13] and that's why he could say that they
[1:22:15] were
[1:22:15] in this condition and he said you don't
[1:22:18] know he said your wretched miserable
[1:22:20] poor blind and naked oh because although
[1:22:24] I believe this I believe that they felt
[1:22:26] they were in the will of God but they're
[1:22:27] out of the will of God a man and they
[1:22:31] were wretched in the eyes of God so now
[1:22:35] what you are your eyes what are you
[1:22:36] wearing the eyes of God a man again
[1:22:39] looking looking to the mirror of the
[1:22:40] word and don't deny what you're seeing a
[1:22:42] man the testimony of the word regarding
[1:22:46] you and again I'll never forget our
[1:22:48] brother Perry green there preached on
[1:22:50] that many many years ago and I still got
[1:22:53] the tape where he braced on it and he
[1:22:55] talked about going good movie now out
[1:22:57] somewhere and he said right on the side
[1:22:59] there was a mirror and he looked in the
[1:23:01] mirror and it struck him concerning the
[1:23:03] scripture a man
[1:23:05] don't break the mirror a man leave the
[1:23:08] mirror held of the revealed word and
[1:23:11] many have broken the mirror of the
[1:23:13] revealed word today and that's why
[1:23:15] they're going that a living this way
[1:23:16] doing this doing this doing that and
[1:23:18] they still feel that they're believers
[1:23:19] but they're not because they're denying
[1:23:22] what they're seeing in the revelation of
[1:23:24] the word denying where they're seen in
[1:23:26] the mirror of the revealed word they
[1:23:29] they feel that they are this because I
[1:23:31] believe this and again is all by the
[1:23:33] doctrine but what about the spirit a man
[1:23:37] you've got to know your anointing you
[1:23:39] got to make sure make your calling and
[1:23:41] election sure and has to make sure of
[1:23:44] your anointing that you got the right
[1:23:45] anointing because they saw this but when
[1:23:49] Jesus looked down he said your wretched
[1:23:51] your miserable amazing and you're poor
[1:23:54] and you're blind and naked we think
[1:23:58] we're Richmond in the revealed Word oh
[1:24:00] yeah not only physically but we're
[1:24:03] thinking we're rich in the revealed Word
[1:24:04] we're rich they're rich they're and so I
[1:24:06] got this I got that but in the eyes of
[1:24:10] God they're wretched oh I'm wonderful no
[1:24:12] I'm not are you looking in the eyes of
[1:24:15] God through the eyes of God or your own
[1:24:17] eyes
[1:24:17] amen grace brother then the anointing
[1:24:21] the anointing can give us to reveal word
[1:24:23] but brother whatever it's in our heads
[1:24:25] but the prophecy is not in the heart
[1:24:28] he may that's right he said again let me
[1:24:31] repeat it
[1:24:31] he said you're in the message but the
[1:24:33] message is not in you hey babe and there
[1:24:37] are many other in the message but the
[1:24:39] message is not in them I know that by
[1:24:42] their attitude I know that by their
[1:24:44] Spirit amen

[1:28:11] you're gonna be really serious in your
[1:28:12] repentance acknowledging that you are
[1:28:14] apps you were born in sin you were saved
[1:28:17] in iniquity you come to the world
[1:28:19] speaking lies and brother when you get
[1:28:21] to when you get the revelation of
[1:28:22] repentance
[1:28:23] amen brother it's not a casual thing
[1:28:25] it's not a religious thing it is a
[1:28:28] spiritual conviction in your heart and
[1:28:30] in your soul and whether you're going to
[1:28:31] repent with tears and Lord forgive me
[1:28:34] Lord yes Lord
[1:28:35] that's me I was born in sin i was shaped
[1:28:38] in iniquity i come to the world speaking
[1:28:40] life forgive me lord i was the absolute
[1:28:43] opposite of the righteousness as you're
[1:28:45] looking for and lord i I'm sorry
[1:28:47] forgive me and I received Jesus Christ
[1:28:50] as my Lord and Savior because without
[1:28:52] him I
[1:28:53] lost without him there's no hold for me
[1:28:55] so Lord die I thank you for what you did
[1:28:58] amen and lay down your life for me amen
[1:29:01] just think he laid down his life for you
[1:29:03] and you know it ought to bring upstairs
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] in other caused us to cry in other
[1:29:08] causes to weep a man in our repentance
[1:29:11] when we consider the place that he paid
[1:29:13] to redeem us what he suffered to redeem
[1:29:16] us what he endured to redeem us just
[1:29:19] think brother sister what he what he
[1:29:20] suffered as Jesus in the flesh I'm being
[1:29:24] rejected by this were rejected by that
[1:29:26] one and what he suffered when they are
[1:29:28] when he was betrayed by Judas yeah amen
[1:29:31] and the power of God brings that I went
[1:29:33] to come through the anointing was at the
[1:29:34] end time and he said here is Jesus The
[1:29:37] Anointed One and here is Judas and he
[1:29:39] said he was anointed because Jesus was
[1:29:41] anointed them and he went out and did
[1:29:42] his signs and wonders they healed the
[1:29:44] sick they raised the dead and Judas was
[1:29:47] among them and understand this there's
[1:29:49] very very very little said about Judas
[1:29:52] in the Bible just that he was naive was
[1:29:55] identified as a disciple and again a a
[1:29:58] is highlighted when it comes to the
[1:30:00] betrayal of Jesus amen
[1:30:02] but Jesus knew who he was he knew who
[1:30:05] was going to betray him amen
[1:30:07] because they went when he served the
[1:30:08] Last Supper there and and he turned to
[1:30:10] Judas he said what you do is to do
[1:30:12] quickly a man and a man this is must
[1:30:16] have struck Judas and again I believe
[1:30:18] maybe Judas knew and Jesus knew a man
[1:30:20] Jesus discerned the spear that was in
[1:30:23] Jonas and no doubt Judas maybe knew that
[1:30:25] Jesus knew him but yet he was among the
[1:30:28] 12 disciples that Jesus sent out with
[1:30:31] the anointing amen and they came back
[1:30:33] and testified or we did this we did that
[1:30:36] and so on and Judas was among them there
[1:30:39] is there's no where where where the
[1:30:40] Bible separates Judas to say that Judas
[1:30:43] was there so Judas was that and Judas
[1:30:45] said this spirit of that spirit brother
[1:30:47] as I have said before the one that is
[1:30:49] highlighted among the disciples more
[1:30:51] than anyone else
[1:30:52] it's Peter Peter Peter Peter was there
[1:30:56] to say this Peter was here to say that
[1:30:58] and when Jesus said this gee Peter stood
[1:31:01] up and Peter Peter said this
[1:31:03] wanted to stop this and stop that and I
[1:31:05] know that Jesus had to turn to Peter and
[1:31:08] say get thee behind me Satan a man so
[1:31:12] what he was under he was under the annoy
[1:31:14] of the revealed word to recognize Christ
[1:31:17] as Messiah but brother is also in the
[1:31:20] United order of sub judice of Jeff of
[1:31:23] Satan rather a million what for to
[1:31:26] prevent Jesus from doing what he was
[1:31:27] ordained to do in going to Jerusalem and
[1:31:30] he and he was trying to stop Jesus from
[1:31:32] going to Jerusalem and Jesus said get
[1:31:35] behind me Satan
[1:31:36] he knew it was Satan's annuity on Peter
[1:31:38] a million because Satan knew what Jesus
[1:31:41] was going to do when he got to Jerusalem
[1:31:42] and brother Tommy the devil knowing that
[1:31:45] brother that a that he is power his
[1:31:47] anointing was going to be weakened amen
[1:31:49] when Jesus would lay down his life and
[1:31:52] pick it up again
[1:31:53] a man Satan had the power over death
[1:31:55] hell the grave and Jesus was going to
[1:31:57] conquer it
[1:31:58] amen amen praise the Lord and when he
[1:32:01] when he came back on the day of the
[1:32:04] resurrection that is the Saints that
[1:32:06] where they were locked away and the
[1:32:08] Saints they were they were imprisoned
[1:32:09] there in death Jesus brought with him
[1:32:12] amen because he opened the gate and he
[1:32:15] said come on I should have said you free
[1:32:17] and he rebuked the devil and he said I'm
[1:32:20] going to take the key of hell and of
[1:32:21] death amen he rebuked the devil brother
[1:32:24] neros and they conquered death hell and
[1:32:26] the grave for the believer he conquered
[1:32:29] death hell and the grave for the elect
[1:32:30] of God and brother he proved it when the
[1:32:33] saints of God the Old Testament Saints
[1:32:35] arose with him and they went into the
[1:32:37] city and appeared on too many amen again
[1:32:40] though that may be why then the prophet
[1:32:42] of God as I later that the Saints of the
[1:32:45] New Testament are going to rise from the
[1:32:47] day and they're going to appear to the
[1:32:49] living Saints by the grace of Almighty
[1:32:51] God amen
[1:32:52] and the prophet of God said we're going
[1:32:55] to be changed in a moment between them
[1:32:56] and I and with them we're going to be
[1:32:58] caught up to meet the Lord in the end or
[1:33:00] in the rapture amen
[1:33:02] he said we get together - he said in
[1:33:04] that dimension and in the slum where the
[1:33:06] prophet of God did say thirty to forty
[1:33:08] days
[1:33:09] and I'm still looking for that that
[1:33:11] quote and and then he said after that he
[1:33:13] said we're going to be cut looking we're
[1:33:15] going to look up and he said there he
[1:33:17] said there's Jesus why the pillar of
[1:33:19] fire would go up and get the body and
[1:33:21] get into the body of Jesus had come down
[1:33:23] to receive us unto himself
[1:33:25] amen praise the name of the Lord for the
[1:33:28] marriage supper of the lamb and we look
[1:33:30] up oh there's Jesus and we're going to
[1:33:32] rise to meet him he comes down we go up
[1:33:35] amen to the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:33:37] by the grace of Almighty God so God help
[1:33:40] us in this day and in this hour brother
[1:33:42] sister that we're not going to miss that
[1:33:44] revelation when are they going to miss
[1:33:46] what God has done what God is doing
[1:33:47] brother to get us into that bride
[1:33:49] material
[1:33:50] amen so brother that we know we're
[1:33:53] braids brother I'd say that God got out
[1:33:55] of us that we're not going to be
[1:33:57] deceived by the end by the false
[1:33:58] anointed ones at the end time just
[1:34:00] because we got the anointing I feel this
[1:34:02] and I feel that yeah and I and I believe
[1:34:05] the word I believe this that message
[1:34:07] that message this doctrine of that
[1:34:09] doctrine but when it comes to
[1:34:10] influencing your everyday living brother
[1:34:13] or no then then they'll prove you're
[1:34:16] talking about a false anointed one not a
[1:34:19] probe not the false anointing but the
[1:34:22] false person in their teaching in their
[1:34:25] actions and in their reactions amen
[1:34:28] oh they they they they could they say
[1:34:30] well I believe the message I believe
[1:34:32] this I believe that but brother it's in
[1:34:34] their heads but not in their hearts
[1:34:36] Amen because it was in the heart that
[1:34:38] it's Kalei it's going to take control
[1:34:40] and all your life you could have take
[1:34:42] control of your spirit take control of
[1:34:44] your mind and it's going to bring it all
[1:34:46] subject to the Word of God it'll bring
[1:34:48] your subject to the will of God for your
[1:34:51] for the day of the hour that you're
[1:34:52] living in amen brother took control of
[1:34:55] our Luther
[1:34:56] it took control of Wesley and brother
[1:34:58] we'll all praise the Lord and they went
[1:35:00] forth and they lived that justified
[1:35:02] light they went more than they'd the
[1:35:04] sanctified life and the Pentecostals
[1:35:06] went for the lay of the Pentecostal
[1:35:08] light where there were the gifts of the
[1:35:10] Spirit amen
[1:35:11] that was there on the day of Pentecost
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:14] now that wasn't the resurrect
[1:35:16] that wasn't the rapture they were a man
[1:35:18] that was God bringing us on to
[1:35:20] perfection amen
[1:35:21] he revealed this to Luther that
[1:35:23] diversely that to the Salvation Army
[1:35:25] there to other churches and to finally
[1:35:28] the Pentecostals a made and after the
[1:35:30] end the Pentecostals brother went around
[1:35:32] the world in a way that Luther's message
[1:35:34] didn't go in a way that Wesley says he
[1:35:37] didn't go but the Pentecostal mercy went
[1:35:39] around the world amen brother and they
[1:35:42] were all shocked and even the religious
[1:35:45] people non religious people they were
[1:35:47] shocked at Pentecost is their Pentecost
[1:35:51] is there it's in that country it's got
[1:35:53] over there it's got over there oh my why
[1:35:55] because what brother was game was
[1:35:57] getting closer and closer to the
[1:35:59] resurrection getting closer and closer
[1:36:01] to the rapture
[1:36:02] amen and that's why the prophet of God
[1:36:04] said that the message of the hour and
[1:36:06] the ministry of Malachi 4 was the
[1:36:09] capstone of the Pentecostal message amen
[1:36:13] what happened after Luther was the
[1:36:15] capstone of his message and happened
[1:36:17] after Wesley and the Bayon and the
[1:36:19] others and the Pentecostals brother the
[1:36:22] curbstone of the Pentecost are not the
[1:36:24] bangles but the capstone of what God was
[1:36:26] doing in there taking them on to the
[1:36:28] capstone but brother when God brought
[1:36:30] the capstone on the same they rejected
[1:36:32] it
[1:36:33] oh yeah they rejected it brother la
[1:36:36] lista they were they were there were
[1:36:38] Methodists they believed Luther and went
[1:36:40] on with Wesley but again there was there
[1:36:42] were those I believe Luther's message
[1:36:43] that wouldn't go on to Wesley and
[1:36:45] they're those say oh yeah then there are
[1:36:47] those that believe the Pentecostal
[1:36:49] message of Lutheran's and Methodists and
[1:36:51] they went on with the bedycasa 'ls but
[1:36:53] they're also they were still Lutheran's
[1:36:55] they're still Methodists dan there are
[1:36:57] still other churches that would not
[1:36:59] believe the Pentecostal revival and move
[1:37:01] on with the pedicle revival they
[1:37:03] wouldn't do it
[1:37:04] no no but again the elect of God moved
[1:37:07] on the seat of God moved on and brother
[1:37:10] brother hallelujah praise the Lord and
[1:37:12] that's what you and I are here amen
[1:37:15] God is moving us on to perfection God
[1:37:18] add the predestinated seat in Luther's
[1:37:20] day Wesley stay the Pentecostal day got
[1:37:22] a debride
[1:37:23] native seed brother a man to bring this
[1:37:26] do you and me to this place a million it
[1:37:29] was their predestinated seed of God amen
[1:37:32] amen that God was going to raise up to
[1:37:34] believe the message of the hour there
[1:37:36] was a generation a man that did come out
[1:37:39] of Pentecost there was a generation that
[1:37:41] did believe the Prophet they did believe
[1:37:44] the message of the hour a man to the
[1:37:46] extent that God had revealed it in that
[1:37:48] day a man that the problem of God was
[1:37:51] preaching preaching preaching and they
[1:37:53] didn't understand at all the part of the
[1:37:55] God said I know he said you know you're
[1:37:56] not getting it he said it's because he
[1:37:58] says not striking me the way that it
[1:38:00] should
[1:38:01] well what did he mean by that not
[1:38:03] striking him the way that it should
[1:38:04] well to strike us the way that it should
[1:38:06] is going to produce the resurrection and
[1:38:09] the rapture and he said but he said is
[1:38:11] not the hour and he knew that it was
[1:38:13] going to rise a generation that it would
[1:38:15] strengthen the way that it should and it
[1:38:17] would produced the resurrection but if
[1:38:20] the rapture I pray the grace of God that
[1:38:22] we are that generation because listen
[1:38:25] the part of God even before God took him
[1:38:27] off the scene he was talking to her
[1:38:29] brother concerning the word and
[1:38:31] concerning the message of the hour and
[1:38:33] what God had done what God was doing and
[1:38:35] whether or not that generation was
[1:38:38] seeing all that God had done and why God
[1:38:41] did it and what is God doing and the
[1:38:43] powder God said brother he said the
[1:38:45] older generation eration around the
[1:38:47] message now he said they will not see it
[1:38:50] and he said they will not catch it that
[1:38:52] way but there's a generation rising and
[1:38:55] he said that's going to it's going to
[1:38:57] strike them the right way there's a
[1:38:58] generation that's rising that's going to
[1:39:00] catch it and they're going to see with a
[1:39:02] generation back there in 1965 in the
[1:39:06] 1960s whether they never got it no no no
[1:39:09] they just dated knew God has said a
[1:39:11] prophet and thus and the mysteries of
[1:39:13] God was revealed but when it comes to
[1:39:16] seeing the resurrection of Raftery faith
[1:39:18] it wasn't striking them and it wasn't
[1:39:21] under the 1990 70 90 70 72 73 the other
[1:39:26] day that God began to get the people and
[1:39:28] brother a watt into the message a man
[1:39:32] not not to bring them around the message
[1:39:34] and to identify with the message amen
[1:39:37] my brother he began to bring them into
[1:39:39] the message and the message in them any
[1:39:41] man to make the word fleshing them to
[1:39:44] give their in the faith that they needed
[1:39:46] old brothers sister if God didn't do
[1:39:49] that in nineteen seventy seventy two
[1:39:51] around their brother and that's whereas
[1:39:53] when what what happened there
[1:39:55] brother the ministry are upon till that
[1:39:57] hour the ministry was preaching goddess
[1:39:59] and a prophet goddess and a father to
[1:40:01] goddess at a profit and they went around
[1:40:03] the world preaching God has sent a
[1:40:04] prophet a man oh yeah and I know I've
[1:40:08] heard this pretty sure I've heard that
[1:40:10] preacher this brother that brother a man
[1:40:12] and well they didn't preach this to know
[1:40:14] because the way God didn't want them to
[1:40:16] preach it then it wasn't ordained for to
[1:40:19] strike them then a man so they they all
[1:40:23] that was ordained all they what God
[1:40:24] wanted to be a witness he wanted to be a
[1:40:26] witness say that Malachi 4 was fulfilled
[1:40:29] in that God has sent a prophet a man to
[1:40:33] turn our hearts back to the original
[1:40:36] Word a man but not to the extent of the
[1:40:39] faith that he was looking for the
[1:40:41] rapture the resurrection a man and
[1:40:44] brother and any they oh yeah sure they
[1:40:46] that generation believe that God has
[1:40:49] sent a prophet and that the mystery of
[1:40:51] God was revealed and then the word was
[1:40:54] was writ was was was revealed the seven
[1:40:57] seals are revealed but when it comes to
[1:40:59] getting into the revelation of the seven
[1:41:01] seals the revelation of the mystery of
[1:41:03] God to get the faith that we needed for
[1:41:05] this hour they didn't have it no no they
[1:41:08] weren't ordained to get it as the
[1:41:10] Provost said they will not but there
[1:41:12] will arise a generation and as I say
[1:41:14] there wasn't on two ninety seventy
[1:41:16] seventy two around there that they begin
[1:41:19] to get into the message and there was a
[1:41:22] brother that was rising around the
[1:41:24] message then there was other brethren

[1:41:30] message he said with now he said we know
[1:41:32] there was a messenger he said they said
[1:41:34] because God said I'll send you Elijah
[1:41:36] the prophet and he'll do this and he'll
[1:41:38] do that yeah but what is what's what's
[1:41:41] the faith in it what is the faith that
[1:41:44] God is looking for in me now that he is
[1:41:46] right now that the populists on that now
[1:41:49] that the word is revealed what is God

[1:42:42] brother Bo yeah he was criticized by a
[1:42:45] lot of believers and not only him but
[1:42:47] many other preachers were criticized by
[1:42:49] so-called believers honor their teaching
[1:42:52] this their teaching this to teaching
[1:42:53] that they were trying to get the
[1:42:55] believers to get the braids into the
[1:42:58] word a man and get the word in the
[1:43:00] bright praise the name of the Lord not

[1:43:05] message was around us let's get into the
[1:43:08] word and get the word in us a man and in
[1:43:11] that if that is the teaching we got to

[1:43:28] so brother and now God is looking for us
[1:43:30] to have a faith that they never had even
[1:43:33] ten years ago or a paid that they never
[1:43:35] had as fleshly 50 years ago or a time
[1:43:39] when the problem of God was called off
[1:43:41] the same brother what faith do I have
[1:43:43] compared to the faith that they had what
[1:43:46] they do I have compared to the faith of
[1:43:48] Eddie yes even in nineteen sixty or
[1:43:51] sixty-five or 1970 Amen brother I tell
[1:43:54] you this
[1:43:55] as I said I come to this word in 1966
[1:43:59] that's when I was baptized in the river
[1:44:02] in the bitter Falls River a man and
[1:44:05] again I might have been in December a yo
[1:44:09] December 1965 I was baptized in the name
[1:44:13] of the titles in the Pentecostal church
[1:44:16] oh yeah it's like I can remember that
[1:44:21] now and brother and going up there
[1:44:24] behind the behind the the the the
[1:44:27] platform because I used to sit on the
[1:44:29] platform singing in the choir you did oh
[1:44:33] yeah I did I was singing in the choir
[1:44:36] there oh yeah I remember looking down oh
[1:44:39] yeah when there was a certain church
[1:44:41] that that I started in that church when
[1:44:44] it was on KC Street and that ability to
[1:44:46] still there but it's not a church and I
[1:44:48] went to that church when they built the
[1:44:50] new one yeah I was on the platform when
[1:44:53] they dedicated the new one I was on the
[1:44:55] platform with when they took up a
[1:44:56] donated took up the offering and I
[1:44:58] believe it was six or seven thousand
[1:45:00] dollars yeah amazing the church was full
[1:45:03] and when they took up the donation it
[1:45:05] they took up six or seven thousand
[1:45:07] dollars and that was a lot of money for
[1:45:09] that day yeah
[1:45:10] and I remember Sunday platform standing
[1:45:12] up and singing and I believe yeah and I
[1:45:17] sure you believe it but I believe that I
[1:45:20] had that I was singing higher than all
[1:45:22] the rest I believe that I was singing
[1:45:23] louder than all the rest because when I
[1:45:26] opened my eyes and I looked at the song
[1:45:27] leader at all I said I must be
[1:45:30] disturbing everybody because I don't
[1:45:32] know what we were singing but I was
[1:45:34] singing loud I were screaming a man not
[1:45:37] just so I'm a member of the choir so I'm
[1:45:40] gonna I'm not gonna sing any higher than
[1:45:42] this I'm not gonna sing no louder than
[1:45:43] the dis and so on
[1:45:44] no it was for the glory of God amen
[1:45:46] nobody mentioned it but I didn't go back
[1:45:49] into the choir and and by the grace of
[1:45:54] God I was still in that church I stayed
[1:45:56] in that church I was there on Wednesdays
[1:45:58] when they made their bread made their

[1:46:10] honest on a Sunday morning service amen
[1:46:13] and it's still there and I and again as
[1:46:16] I said I was baptized using the titles
[1:46:19] in 1965 in that church yeah and I
[1:46:22] believe it might have been that might
[1:46:23] have been the pastor of the Church of
[1:46:24] the time they baptized me a million but
[1:46:28] then in the early 1966 you know I was in

[1:52:24] when they didn't know it they didn't
[1:52:27] realize well they thought that it all
[1:52:28] happened back in 1906
[1:52:31] yeah they held it all happened back then
[1:52:34] you know I'm around that around that

[2:06:57] said he was preaching out a certain
[2:06:59] message and he went word by word by word
[2:07:03] by word line by line by line a man
[2:07:06] preached a commented preached and
[2:07:08] commented amen
[2:07:09] as I said he preached maybe seven
[2:07:14] sermons on that on that one message and
[2:07:17] a certain brother I told you before a
[2:07:21] certain brothers at all said you're not
[2:07:22] let your you can't preach likely Vale
[2:07:24] and so on because I preached just very
[2:07:29] few messages on a certain sermon and so

[2:08:02] paragraphs that I want to share with you
[2:08:04] what for to give us a greater revelation
[2:08:07] of the anointed ones at the end time
[2:08:09] what for
[2:08:11] so that at the end of it we're going to
[2:08:13] come to the conclusion and know the
[2:08:16] anointing that's on us and where it is
[2:08:18] to make sure that we yeah we're anointed
[2:08:23] but not false anointed now as the
[2:08:26] prophet of god said the 90 is true
[2:08:28] the 90 is real and it's in it's Christ
[2:08:31] he said buddy said the false he said
[2:08:34] it's a false teaching oh yeah I said you
[2:08:37] can experience the true and 90 of the
[2:08:38] Holy Ghost and then he said but not take
[2:08:41] the teeth to true teaching you glad to
[2:08:45] add a wordy rattle were there a change
[2:08:47] of their change it there and brother
[2:08:49] were experiencing a lot of that even

[2:08:55] ninety-one at the end times are staying
[2:08:56] with the word and there's a there's a
[2:08:59] false of ninety-one at the end time Lord
[2:09:01] brothers sisters the true anointing but
[2:09:03] they're compromising on the word and
[2:09:07] brother concerning considering know what
[2:09:10] I have seen and what I've heard over the
[2:09:11] year of fifty years there's been a lot
[2:09:13] of compromising and there's more and
[2:09:16] more compromising as we get more and
[2:09:19] more into a modern world as we get more
[2:09:22] and more into the time of the end please

[2:10:45] of God oh my
[2:10:46] he was absolutely true he said yeah he
[2:10:48] said there's many anointed ones he said
[2:10:50] even now he said and there was because
[2:10:55] some of them when I was back there as a
[2:10:59] young believer maybe we were myself and
[2:11:02] and those in our cottage means back then
[2:11:04] in gamble we were supporting this
[2:11:06] evangelist that evangelist that one and
[2:11:08] they all condemned within badams
[2:11:10] teaching yeah but yet they went out with
[2:11:14] signs and wonders heal the sick yeah
[2:11:16] even some were it raised the dead and he
[2:11:19] did this and did that yeah but denied
[2:11:22] the message of the hour and eventually
[2:11:25] push William Branham off the scene you
[2:11:30] know they begin to they refused to
[2:11:33] support William brows ministry as I said
[2:11:37] one evangelist went to William Branham
[2:11:39] and I said brother Bentham you got to
[2:11:41] stop preaching those things he said
[2:11:44] because people is not don't want to hear
[2:11:45] it and they're gonna refuse you when he
[2:11:48] said prophet said somebody got to preach
[2:11:49] it
[2:11:50] he said the pastors are not preaching it
[2:11:52] so he said I gotta preach it and that
[2:11:54] was a very famous evangelist that told
[2:11:57] him to do that yeah and it was an
[2:12:02] evangelist that I don't know I might

[2:12:40] take he said a dozen of the rest he said
[2:12:42] of the Evangelist and put him in the
[2:12:43] other end and he said no way would they
