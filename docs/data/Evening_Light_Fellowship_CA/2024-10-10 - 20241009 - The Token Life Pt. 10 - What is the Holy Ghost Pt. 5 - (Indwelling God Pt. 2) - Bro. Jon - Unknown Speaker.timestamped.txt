[31:58] Heavenly
[31:59] Father Lord we're asking you to just
[32:01] take the service
[32:03] now Lord your word says that you're a
[32:06] spirit that'll lead us into all truth
[32:08] Lord that you'll settle our hearts on
[32:10] your word Lord that you'll bring us to
[32:12] the place that we need to come to Lord
[32:15] to full restoration full Redemption
[32:17] Heavenly Father Lord and we're asking
[32:19] you to take your word once again Lord as
[32:21] we dig in deep tonight Lord I pray that
[32:24] you would help us to understand Lord to
[32:26] have Clarity of Mind of who you are and
[32:28] what you're doing Lord that we could see
[32:30] ourselves in your word Lord to not just
[32:32] place it on somebody else or even on you
[32:35] Lord but that we could find our place in
[32:37] your word and that we could rest our
[32:39] souls on it Lord and let it draw us up
[32:41] and turn us into Lord creatures of
[32:43] Eternity out of this time that we live
[32:45] in Lord I pray for your grace now Lord
[32:48] settle us we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[32:50] we ask it amen amen God bless you turn
[32:54] if you will to John chapter 14 John
[32:57] chapter 14
[32:59] 14 amen God bless you good to see sister
[33:01] Jean again amen good to see you
[33:07] amen John chapter 14 this is the opening
[33:10] scripture that we had from last service
[33:11] and and we'll be here for a little bit
[33:14] uh
[33:16] certainly this is Jesus up at the Last
[33:18] Supper and he's talking to the disciples
[33:20] and he says yet a little while and the
[33:22] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[33:26] because I live you shall live also so at
[33:28] that day ye shall know that I am in the
[33:30] father and ye in me and I in you amen
[33:34] God bless you you can have your seats
[33:35] this evening and we're continuing this
[33:37] series on the Holy Ghost and what is the
[33:39] Holy Ghost and I want to take another uh
[33:42] service on this thought of the
[33:43] indwelling god and I found myself at an
[33:46] impass this week as I was studying
[33:47] because I was moving further and further
[33:49] and we want to understand how God can
[33:51] live with us and live in us and we want
[33:53] to understand who he is and all of these
[33:55] different things and I'd intentionally
[33:57] kind of steered away from godhead
[33:59] because it is a it's a deep topic it's a
[34:01] heavy topic and and I didn't just was
[34:04] trying to kind of ease through it but I
[34:06] found myself at a place here where I
[34:07] couldn't and so we've got to go into
[34:09] godhead and I want to start that tonight
[34:11] and just help us set a foundation for
[34:13] next service or three perhaps as the
[34:15] Lord would lead uh to get us on this
[34:17] understanding because if we can't
[34:19] understand who God is and who the holy
[34:21] spirit is and what it was and what it's
[34:23] doing and these different things then
[34:25] we'll kind of get our part mixed up and
[34:26] we don't see ourselves even how we can
[34:28] be in Christ and Christ be in us as he
[34:30] was talking about in our opening
[34:32] scripture amen but Christ is our example
[34:34] of how we're supposed to be unified with
[34:36] God if we want to understand how we are
[34:38] supposed to be as Believers then we
[34:40] ought to be able to look at Christ and
[34:41] see that and and and Christ was
[34:44] expressing this to his disciples and
[34:46] expressing to to them how that it was
[34:48] supposed to work and he says at that day
[34:50] he says when you come into this Oneness
[34:53] that I'm talking about he says at that
[34:55] day you shall
[34:56] know not by knowledge not by theology
[35:00] but you'll know by experience it'll be a
[35:02] reality in your life that I am in my
[35:04] father and you are in me and I'm in you
[35:07] it's going to be a personal experience
[35:08] he's talking about because he's talking
[35:10] to them and we think that well by
[35:12] Revelation by by theology maybe they
[35:14] would know but they had no clue what he
[35:16] was talking about but he says there's
[35:17] coming a day and it was on the day of
[35:19] Pentecost he says when you'll understand
[35:20] how this works you'll understand how God
[35:22] can be in me how I can be in him and how
[35:24] you can be in me and yet I can be in you
[35:27] and how this Works in unity and if we
[35:29] jump ahead even in that that that book
[35:31] of John to to John 17 and now he's in
[35:34] the Garden of Gethsemane and he's
[35:36] praying and he says and for their sakes
[35:38] I sanctify myself that they also might
[35:41] be Sanctified through the truth he says
[35:43] neither pray I for these alone so he's
[35:45] not just praying for his disciples he
[35:47] says but for them also which Shall
[35:49] Believe on me through their word so
[35:52] everyone that's going to be converted
[35:53] after by the disciples by the Gospel of
[35:56] Jesus Christ he he says what I'm talking
[35:58] about here is for every single one of
[36:01] them it's not just for the disciples
[36:04] it's not just for that day it's not just
[36:05] for the the first church age under Paul
[36:08] and these different things amen but
[36:10] everything that he's talking about is
[36:11] for the ages to come as well and every
[36:13] single believer that's coming after this
[36:16] and what is coming after he says that
[36:18] they all may be one as thou father art
[36:22] in me and I in thee that they also may
[36:25] be one in US that the world may believe
[36:28] that thou has sent me now the world
[36:30] believes in a trinity and here we have a
[36:31] trinity and it's father son and
[36:34] us but there's supposed to be a holy
[36:36] ghost fitted in there somewhere as well
[36:38] and so Jesus is praying here and he's
[36:40] saying I want them Lord I'm praying that
[36:43] they will be the same as you and I are
[36:46] so the Oneness that Christ had with god
[36:49] with Christ had with the father is the
[36:51] same thing that we're supposed to have
[36:52] with both of them both of them not just
[36:55] one of them both of them it's supposed
[36:56] to be the same thing so this Oneness is
[36:59] described as God in Christ and yet
[37:01] Christ is in God and that sounds like a
[37:03] paradox it sounds like a physical
[37:05] impossibility how can you be in somebody
[37:07] and yet they be in you you'd have to
[37:10] fold yourself in up inside out but
[37:13] basically be the only way to do it but
[37:14] Christ is saying the Believers coming
[37:16] after me they have to be exactly as we
[37:18] are I'm in them and they're in me and
[37:19] I'm in you and you're in
[37:21] me and then now he continues and he says
[37:24] the glory which thou gavest me have I
[37:26] given them
[37:28] that they may be one even as we are one
[37:30] i in them and thou in me that they may
[37:33] be perfect and one and that the world
[37:35] may know that thou has sent me and has
[37:37] loved me and has loved me them as thou
[37:41] Hast loved me now Jesus is clarifying he
[37:43] says now I'm going to be in them and
[37:44] you'll be in me and they'll be perfectly
[37:46] in Oneness like we are and he says
[37:49] father I will that they also whom thou
[37:51] Hast given me be with me where I am in
[37:54] other words there's now a restoration
[37:56] there's a Redemption coming that they
[37:58] may behold my glory which thou Hast
[38:01] given me he says for thou lovest me when
[38:05] when I was born in a
[38:07] manger no he says Thou lovest me before
[38:10] the foundation of the world so that kind
[38:14] of talk leaves people scratching their
[38:15] heads really and it's a tough scripture
[38:18] for the Trinity because you have to do a
[38:19] bunch of mental gymnastics and I'm
[38:21] pretty sure you have to break a bunch of
[38:23] scriptural laws to make all these things
[38:25] fit one inside the other and be three
[38:26] separate and yet three one and one and
[38:28] the other and then simultaneously
[38:30] outside of it it's very difficult to
[38:31] make that happen because if you have two
[38:34] separate persons and you put one inside
[38:36] the other then how does the one that's
[38:37] inside the other suddenly become the one
[38:39] that's outside of the other it's very
[38:41] difficult to do those things but as we
[38:43] start to go through this tonight I did
[38:44] want to publicly thank brother Jason
[38:46] dears for this because his his help in
[38:48] my study and he's helped me many times
[38:50] through the years because he's very
[38:52] exhaustive when he goes into something
[38:53] and he digs into the depths of the
[38:55] scripture to really bring the truth of
[38:57] it and so much of what I have here
[38:59] tonight comes directly from him uh
[39:01] certainly in part and his study and his
[39:04] research and he quotes the Trinity and
[39:06] I've got to be able to present the
[39:08] Trinity to you so that you can
[39:09] understand what we really believe
[39:11] because so often I even with believers
[39:12] they don't understand how we differ from
[39:14] the Trinity so this is the the the
[39:16] generally accepted phrase of the Trinity
[39:19] it says the doctrine of the Trinity
[39:21] means that there is one God who
[39:23] eternally exists as three distinct
[39:26] persons he says the Father the Son and
[39:29] the Holy Spirit stated differently God
[39:32] is one in essence and three in person so
[39:35] that means god is one in in his
[39:37] attributes and nature but he is three in
[39:41] persons he says these definitions
[39:44] Express three crucial truths the Father
[39:47] the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct
[39:50] persons so as soon as you get a person
[39:53] you have a
[39:54] personality you have a will you have a
[39:56] nature you have a mind then it says each
[40:00] person is fully God and then he says
[40:05] there is only one God so you have three
[40:08] persons that are each fully God and then
[40:11] they say that there is only one God now
[40:14] that to me makes no sense whatsoever you
[40:16] can't have three fully God people and
[40:18] then say there is one God you can say
[40:20] that they agree in one but you can't say
[40:23] they are one because they they say they
[40:25] are three distinct persons they put
[40:27] their them in three distinct bodies they
[40:29] can be three different
[40:31] places all these different things and so
[40:34] what you have here is what they call a
[40:36] social Trinity meaning three persons in
[40:39] total agreement with one another and and
[40:41] there's there was a a theologian by the
[40:43] name of lamp he was an Anglican priest
[40:45] he wrote a book called God is Spirit he
[40:47] says the Trinity as a Unity of human
[40:49] persons in a social the Trinity as a
[40:52] Unity of human persons in a social
[40:54] Trinity in which three persons in the
[40:56] full iological sense of persons are
[40:59] bound together in mutual love so they
[41:01] have three different minds but they're
[41:03] Bound by mutual love it said it implies
[41:06] the existence of three Divine
[41:10] Consciousness
[41:12] consciousnesses three mindsets three
[41:15] Minds three persons he says in other
[41:18] words three
[41:20] Gods Gods
[41:22] plural three separate Gods amen they are
[41:27] all claim to be fully God so we believe
[41:30] and they believe that God is omnipotent
[41:32] all powerful and if you have three that
[41:35] are simultaneously all powerful then
[41:37] guess what none of them is powerful they
[41:40] cancel each other out none has the
[41:42] advantage over the other none can say I
[41:44] am all powerful because they have two
[41:45] other persons that have the same power
[41:47] they do so it's a contradictory
[41:50] statement in what they believe in these
[41:52] different things it's an impossibility
[41:54] but if there isn't three persons then
[41:56] the question is well how do we we have
[41:57] Jesus Christ a man with a human body the
[42:00] Son of God now you remember when the
[42:02] Trinity if I just scroll back here they
[42:05] say that he is God the father he is God
[42:08] the son and he is God the Holy Spirit
[42:11] three Gods but when we come to scripture
[42:13] you do not ever find it saying God the
[42:17] son it is nowhere in scripture what do
[42:20] they say the Son of God they do not say
[42:23] God the son they say the Son of God they
[42:26] say the spirit of God they do not say
[42:28] God the spirit they say the spirit of
[42:31] God and so this the the very definitions
[42:34] what you get into is is if you're
[42:35] talking to a trinitarians they say is
[42:37] who is God the Father who is God the son
[42:39] who is God the Holy Ghost the first
[42:40] thing you have to say is that the
[42:41] scripture does not say there is God the
[42:42] son what it does say is there is the Son
[42:45] of God that is not the same thing you
[42:48] don't you can't make him God the way
[42:50] that they do but they made up those
[42:52] phrases it does not say God the Holy
[42:54] Spirit it says God is Holy it says God
[42:55] is a spirit it does not say God the Holy
[42:57] Spirit it says the spirit of God Amen so
[43:01] we have to understand that and if we you
[43:03] when we're talking of Jesus Christ
[43:05] specifically the scripture calls him son
[43:07] of David Son of God and Son of Man it
[43:12] never says God the son ever in scripture
[43:14] you cannot find a place in scripture
[43:15] where it says that it is what they add
[43:17] into it they imply it they make it into
[43:19] something that's not there and so you
[43:21] can't fight the trinitarian doctrine
[43:23] with trinitarian phrases you've got to
[43:25] say the word doesn't say that you got to
[43:26] be able to back away from their way of
[43:28] saying it but if we want to know who
[43:30] Christ is because that's the one that
[43:32] they always get messed up on usually we
[43:34] can come to an agreement on the Holy
[43:36] Spirit and and God the father that's
[43:38] that's something that seems to make some
[43:39] sense and we'll cover it in a bit but
[43:41] when it comes to Christ that's the one
[43:43] that always throws the wrench into the
[43:44] spokes is because they say that's a
[43:46] person that's a man that's a body how
[43:49] can you not make him a separate person
[43:52] but we'll go into that as we go but we
[43:55] want to see who Jesus Christ is and that
[43:57] relates to us so when we look at who
[43:59] Christ is now he's talking to the woman
[44:01] at the well remember and we're trying to
[44:03] understand who God is and Jesus says
[44:04] unto her woman believe me the hour comes
[44:07] when you shall neither in this mountain
[44:09] or yet at Jerusalem worship the
[44:12] father he says we ye worship ye know not
[44:16] what we know what we worship for
[44:18] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[44:20] cometh and now is when the true
[44:22] worshippers shall worship the father in
[44:24] spirit and in truth for the father
[44:27] seeketh such to worship Him He says God
[44:31] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[44:35] who the spirit the father he's been
[44:39] talking about the father all along he
[44:41] says they must worship Him in spirit and
[44:44] in truth so who's Jesus talking about
[44:45] he's talking about God he is talking
[44:47] about the father amen he's the source
[44:50] and or origin of all life and what are
[44:53] the attributes of God he is a father he
[44:56] is a spirit and he is one that's the
[45:00] attributes of God he is God alone he's
[45:02] the one we worship we're not to worship
[45:04] anybody else but God remember what what
[45:07] what Moses said in Deuteronomy he says
[45:09] here o Israel the Lord our God is one
[45:13] Lord he says and thou shalt love the
[45:15] Lord thy God with all thine heart and
[45:18] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[45:20] that means you can't add a second God in
[45:22] there there's only one and you've got to
[45:24] worship Him amen you can't add another
[45:26] one uh God of anyone's choosing or
[45:28] making it has to be God Alone that we
[45:30] love and worship but let's take both
[45:32] wings of the scripture because you can't
[45:34] preach it all out of the old and you
[45:35] can't preach it all out of the new they
[45:37] all blend in together because it's all
[45:38] one revealing of God is what we'll see
[45:41] so let's go so we've used the Old
[45:42] Testament here o Israel the Lord our God
[45:44] is one God one Lord now watch what
[45:46] Ephesians 4 says it says there is one
[45:49] body and one Spirit even as ye are
[45:52] called in one hope of your calling one
[45:55] Lord one faith
[45:57] one
[45:58] baptism see if you look in scriptures
[46:00] you can come up with two baptisms you
[46:02] can come up with in the name of the
[46:03] father Son and Holy Ghost and then you
[46:05] can go into acts 238 and he says in the
[46:07] name of Jesus Christ that is not two
[46:10] baptisms that is one baptism one is the
[46:13] revealing of what he meant in the first
[46:15] place and that is that we are baptized
[46:16] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:18] because that is the name of the Father
[46:20] the Son and the Holy Ghost we'll get
[46:22] into that as we go through much much
[46:24] later not in this service today then he
[46:26] says there is one one God and Father of
[46:28] all he does not say one God the father
[46:32] he says one God and Father who is above
[46:35] all father is an
[46:38] attribute it is not a
[46:41] person son is not a person it is an
[46:44] attribute is I am a father I am a son I
[46:47] am a husband I am a pastor I'm a
[46:49] preacher I'm an employee that is just a
[46:52] description it's a title it is not a
[46:54] person it's saying what I am
[46:57] more than anything amen one God and
[47:00] Father of all now listen to this who is
[47:03] above all who is through all and in you
[47:08] all so we understand God and we know
[47:11] that the nature of God is that he is
[47:12] omnipresent Amen in other words God can
[47:15] dwell everywhere at once God can be
[47:20] everywhere at once that is the nature of
[47:23] God Amen he can divide himself up he can
[47:25] dwell in believers and yet we do not
[47:28] have thousands of God because he dwells
[47:29] in you and I that's not the way it works
[47:32] amen he's not thousands of God he is one
[47:35] God and one Spirit one body God can be
[47:37] in heaven and God can be in Earth
[47:39] simultaneously God can be outside of
[47:41] time and God can be inside of time
[47:44] simultaneously amen God's able to be
[47:46] above us through us and in us all at the
[47:48] same time now one way to sort of
[47:51] understanding it's not a perfect example
[47:52] but it is certainly an example is you
[47:54] take air we can't see it it's kind of
[47:57] like a spirit to us and we'll get into
[47:59] the nature of a spirit in a little bit
[48:01] amen air is everywhere practically
[48:03] speaking outside of a vacuum there's no
[48:05] air in a vacuum but we're not again
[48:07] we're speaking practically here so air
[48:10] can be in something this desk did you
[48:12] know is mostly
[48:14] Air at an atomic level there are more
[48:16] holes in this than there are solid
[48:18] points so there is air there is space
[48:21] there is all of these things in there
[48:23] and yet I can take this bottle and I can
[48:26] fill it full of air and air is in that
[48:29] bottle and yet I have not really
[48:30] diminished the air outside of it it is
[48:32] in it is above and it is through the
[48:34] whole thing air is everywhere and God is
[48:37] the same thing amen what makes God able
[48:40] to do this is that his attribute is that
[48:42] he is a spirit his his very it's not
[48:45] even a being a spirit is not a being
[48:46] like we would understand it physicality
[48:48] in that amen it's not just a spirit but
[48:51] rather it's the spirit and God is
[48:52] everywhere he's with us he's in us and
[48:54] through us and that is the ability and
[48:56] attribute of God is that he is
[48:58] everywhere he is able to be everywhere
[49:01] now brother Brown would say he's
[49:02] everywhere by omniscience that he
[49:04] understands and knows all things but
[49:05] when we understand that that God is a
[49:07] spirit is that he is not bound
[49:09] physically the way that we are he's not
[49:11] bound the way we are and that's why we
[49:13] can say he can be everywhere it's not
[49:14] that he is or he works that way but he
[49:16] is not bounded by the physical
[49:18] limitations that we understand amen and
[49:21] he's not diminished by division he's not
[49:23] diminished by you know we get one more
[49:25] person that's filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:26] God does not lose a little bit of
[49:28] himself he has not diminished in power
[49:30] or understanding or ability or any of
[49:33] these things amen he's not made less
[49:35] powerful by working through
[49:37] us none of these things affect God Amen
[49:40] he is God and he stands alone and he has
[49:42] all of this great power a and he's an
[49:45] eternal being that isn't bounded by the
[49:47] laws that we have in this world Amen and
[49:50] Paul makes no mistake here he says it is
[49:52] God our Father that lives through us and
[49:54] in US amen that's who it who it says he
[49:57] says he is our God he is our father he
[49:59] doesn't say he's God the father he says
[50:01] he is God and Father that's his nature
[50:04] that's that's what he he he is amen but
[50:07] I looked at that word through and that
[50:09] really jumped out of me when I looked at
[50:10] this because it has a peculiar meaning
[50:12] we can understand very quickly God above
[50:14] us God in heaven uh you know holy
[50:17] Untouchable and it's the invisible God
[50:19] the source of life and light and all
[50:21] these things and then he says now he is
[50:23] in us all and we can understand that by
[50:25] the Holy Spirit even but he says he is
[50:28] now he is through us and that word
[50:30] through means an extension or act or
[50:33] motion occurring in a particular place
[50:36] so in other words God just isn't in us
[50:38] and around us but God is acting and
[50:40] moving through us and using us on a day
[50:43] byday basis amen and and if you look in
[50:46] the scriptures where this word through
[50:48] is used it come it's most used commonly
[50:51] commonly when it says the word of God
[50:53] came to the prophets and really what it
[50:55] says is the word word of God came
[50:57] through the prophets that they received
[51:00] something and that word flowed through
[51:02] them not just in word but in deed as
[51:04] well so in other words the actions of
[51:07] God are not just spoken but they are
[51:09] lived they are produced by his power and
[51:11] might through US amen that's where that
[51:13] idea of a tangible God like we finished
[51:14] with on last service comes from it is
[51:16] not just God in us but it is God working
[51:18] through us that's the idea of it amen
[51:22] and it's not me doing it and it's not
[51:23] you doing it it's Christ in us that's
[51:25] doing it it's the Holy Spirit acting in
[51:27] us and we'll get more into that deeply
[51:29] as we move through this service tonight
[51:30] and further down the road but Jesus
[51:32] would be warning his disciples about the
[51:34] difficulties they would face ahead we're
[51:36] talking about God above us through us
[51:37] and in Us and how they'd be
[51:39] excommunicated and put in prison and
[51:41] beaten and brought before the rulers he
[51:43] says but when they deliver you up take
[51:45] no thought for how or what you shall
[51:47] speak he says for it will be given you
[51:49] in that same hour what you shall speak
[51:51] for it is not ye that speak but the
[51:54] spirit of your father it does not say
[51:57] God the Father it does not say God the
[51:59] spirit it says the spirit of your father
[52:02] which speaketh in you amen what is the
[52:04] spirit of our father it is the holy
[52:06] spirit it is God it's one and the same
[52:09] thing and Jesus is making it abundantly
[52:11] clear that you cannot separate these
[52:13] things it's all one God working in us
[52:15] and through US amen and that Spirit of
[52:18] Truth would come as we read last service
[52:20] and it's God himself indwelling those
[52:22] Apostles and it's no less the same for
[52:24] us today it's God himself in us we're
[52:27] not just a dwelling place but we're a
[52:29] place we're a body we're a temple that
[52:31] is actively in service by God working
[52:33] through us it's the indwelling god
[52:35] working through our human flesh through
[52:37] all of these things that we have and
[52:38] it's not just through ministers it's not
[52:41] just through men it's not just through
[52:43] educated people it is through all that
[52:45] receive the baptism of the holy spirit
[52:48] in their soul amen hallelujah that's how
[52:51] great God is today is that from the
[52:53] youngest the smallest one here to the
[52:55] oldest and the greatest here God can
[52:58] live and move and work in us and he is
[53:00] not held back by the our lack or our
[53:02] humility or or our our failures or
[53:04] faults or any of those things that's
[53:06] what God's trying to do amen so we see
[53:09] that God is a father and God is a spirit
[53:12] and we start to look now at the other
[53:14] attributes of God we come to Leviticus
[53:16] and he says speak now unto the
[53:17] congregation of the children of Israel
[53:19] and say unto them ye shall be holy for I
[53:22] the Lord your God am Holy so I am a
[53:25] spirit
[53:27] I am Holy it doesn't take a whole lot of
[53:30] Revelation to put that together and say
[53:32] God is a holy spirit God is the holy
[53:35] spirit scripture says God is a spirit
[53:38] God is holy God is the holy spirit it's
[53:40] not God the holy spirit it's God is the
[53:43] holy
[53:44] spirit that's that's him that is his
[53:47] nature that is his attributes God is
[53:49] Holy and no one else is except he
[53:51] declares it holy everything else is not
[53:53] God and therefore it cannot be holy We
[53:56] Are Holy because he says we Are Holy
[53:58] it's by the blood of Christ that we do
[54:00] that amen so we come in here that God is
[54:02] holy God is a spirit God is the holy
[54:04] spirit amen but then the question arises
[54:07] okay we've satisfied that I don't feel
[54:09] that's a difficult one to go through but
[54:11] now we come to Christ and we say but
[54:13] hold on a second that's a man that's a
[54:15] person that was born that's human flesh
[54:18] it might have been sinless but it's
[54:19] still a person with a mind and all of
[54:21] these different things amen so but if we
[54:24] want to see who Christ is we have to
[54:25] start at his
[54:27] origin and most people go straight to
[54:29] the manger and say that is his origin
[54:31] but that is not what the scripture says
[54:33] is the origin of Christ amen he was not
[54:36] he did not come into existence the first
[54:39] when he was born in the stable through
[54:40] Mary's body that was not the start of
[54:42] the Son of God that is not what the
[54:44] scripture says we read this literally
[54:46] during communion on Sunday but I'll read
[54:48] it again to make it clear Jesus is
[54:50] saying he says Jesus knowing that the
[54:52] father had given all things into his
[54:54] hands and that he was come from Mary
[54:58] no that he was come from God and went to
[55:02] God Amen so Jesus didn't come from Mary
[55:06] Jesus came from God by his own admission
[55:08] Jesus said remember that he was in the
[55:10] father and that he was returning after
[55:12] his death burial and resurrection and
[55:14] Ascension back to what he was in the
[55:17] father that was what he was going to do
[55:20] so the man the physical body of Jesus on
[55:23] this Earth was not the starting place
[55:25] for the son of God
[55:26] that's not the starting place for Christ
[55:28] amen that's just another expression of
[55:31] Christ but is not the start of it Christ
[55:33] did not begin on this Earth Christ was
[55:35] in existence long before he was ever
[55:37] manifested in flesh if we go to
[55:40] Colossians 1 now Paul says giving thanks
[55:42] unto the Father which has made us meat
[55:44] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[55:46] the Saints and light who had delivered
[55:48] us from the power of darkness and had
[55:51] translated us into the kingdom of his
[55:53] dear son now that sounds an awful lot
[55:55] like two persons but let's keep
[55:57] reading he says' in whom we have
[55:59] Redemption through his blood even the
[56:02] Forgiveness of sins who is what the son
[56:06] is the image of the invisible God the
[56:10] firstborn of every creature so let's
[56:12] start with the first bit we'll go with
[56:13] the image and then we'll go with the
[56:14] firstborn he says the image of the
[56:17] invisible God that is the Son of God
[56:19] that is Jesus Christ what is he he is
[56:21] the image an image would be a picture an
[56:25] image would be the the mirror that shows
[56:27] the person you can't see you know if you
[56:29] take a mirror and put it on the corner
[56:31] and angle it just right you can have
[56:32] somebody standing in a hallway and you
[56:34] can't see them but you can look at that
[56:35] mirror and you can see that person
[56:37] Christ would be like the mirror of God
[56:39] in that sense that he is the visible
[56:41] image of what you cannot see God is a
[56:44] spirit we'll see this in a in a second
[56:47] Spirits are invisible to us so God in
[56:49] this Earthly realm unless he would open
[56:51] our eyes unless he would open our
[56:53] understanding somehow unless he would
[56:54] reveal himself in some way he cannot be
[56:56] seen by our technology by our five
[56:59] natural senses we cannot touch taste
[57:01] feel see hear him none of those things
[57:03] except he would move in some way in
[57:05] those physical Realms so God as a spirit
[57:07] is completely invisible to US unless he
[57:10] chooses to reveal himself okay now we go
[57:14] to John 1118 and he says no man hath
[57:17] seen God at any
[57:20] time no one's ever seen
[57:23] God what God the spirit God in his
[57:26] original Elohim form nobody's seen him
[57:31] he says the only begotten son which is
[57:34] in the bosom of the father he had
[57:37] declared him that word decare means he
[57:39] has revealed him he's unfolded him he's
[57:42] narrated him he's explained him he's
[57:44] shown him so you go to the Amplified now
[57:47] and I kind of did a a mix of a couple
[57:49] different versions here it says no one
[57:51] has ever seen God the only begotten son
[57:54] who is close to the father's side
[57:56] has made him seen and understood so
[58:00] Jesus Christ is what he is the image he
[58:03] is the revealing the revelation of God
[58:07] to us amen he's the visible God to us if
[58:10] we want to put it that way he's the
[58:12] explanation he's the understanding of
[58:14] who and what God is Jesus Christ is God
[58:17] made visible to us that's where we are
[58:20] amen God Jesus Christ is God made
[58:23] understandable in the only way that we
[58:24] could ever really understand him amen so
[58:27] that we could start to comprehend him
[58:28] but every time God is made visible to us
[58:32] that is Christ that's Christ Okay so
[58:36] we've got to understand now that God is
[58:38] outside of this this Dimension he does
[58:40] he's not limited by it he can come into
[58:43] it and he can go out of it but he is not
[58:45] limited by our Dimension and our
[58:47] Dimension is limited by time space and
[58:50] matter a spirit is is Ageless it does
[58:54] not die it can be destroyed but it does
[58:56] not die so it's outside of time space it
[59:01] has no being in the way that we do
[59:04] naturally and there's no matter to it so
[59:06] it is not affected God is not affected
[59:08] by this realm that we are in amen and
[59:11] look at it this way it's kind of like if
[59:12] we look at the internet so if I go if
[59:15] I'm on the internet and I go to Facebook
[59:17] Facebook is a
[59:19] dimension it's a virtual Dimension and
[59:22] there I create a a Facebook profile
[59:24] named Jonathan klette and I can go in
[59:26] there and I can put pictures of myself
[59:28] and stories and I can share things and I
[59:30] can do all these things and if
[59:32] somebody's living in Facebook the only
[59:35] Jonathan klette they can see there is
[59:38] what I put in that
[59:39] profile right that is the visible
[59:43] Jonathan klette who exists completely
[59:45] outside of the the internet Dimension my
[59:48] reality is not the internet but I can
[59:50] put myself into the reality of the
[59:52] internet and yet never change I'm not
[59:54] diminished in any way so I can exist
[59:58] there that profile is me in the Facebook
[1:00:01] Dimension so Christ is literally if we
[1:00:04] want to put this into Facebook Christ is
[1:00:06] God in our Dimension he's the expression
[1:00:09] of God he's he he he's the thing that
[1:00:11] shows him there amen but it doesn't
[1:00:14] limit God nor does it change God in his
[1:00:16] supernatural abilities amen God's a
[1:00:19] spirit and he is outside of that
[1:00:20] Facebook Dimension outside of our
[1:00:22] Dimension but he's working with us
[1:00:24] through Christ through his profile
[1:00:26] through his explanation his visible
[1:00:28] image within time space and matter if I
[1:00:31] could put it that way does that make
[1:00:33] sense so Christ is God being revealed in
[1:00:37] our dimension in our in a way that our
[1:00:39] five senses can contact and our mind and
[1:00:41] these different things Christ is God be
[1:00:43] being revealed in a dimension that God
[1:00:45] can step into but that God also exists
[1:00:47] outside
[1:00:48] of are we
[1:00:50] okay this is a lot I know it's heavy and
[1:00:53] I'm trying to go slow and easy here and
[1:00:55] kind of reinforce for it as we go so we
[1:00:57] come now and he says he's the image of
[1:01:00] the invisible God the firstborn this is
[1:01:03] speaking now of Christ he is the
[1:01:05] firstborn of every creature you can't
[1:01:08] have a son that always was the son by
[1:01:12] definition comes after and from a father
[1:01:15] so you cannot have an eternal son you
[1:01:18] can have an everlasting son that lives
[1:01:21] forever but you can't have an eternal
[1:01:22] one because by definition a son comes
[1:01:24] from a father am amen so he says the Son
[1:01:27] of God Christ is the firstborn of every
[1:01:30] creature he was the first creation the
[1:01:32] first thing made the first of anything
[1:01:35] in this realm that we are in on this
[1:01:37] Earth amen now we have an issue when we
[1:01:40] take
[1:01:41] God and God was first of all because God
[1:01:44] existed God was not
[1:01:47] created God existed and we we were
[1:01:49] talking about this before church we
[1:01:51] can't wrap our hands around something
[1:01:52] that doesn't have a start because we are
[1:01:55] creatures of time in these bodies so
[1:01:57] everybody has a start and so for
[1:01:59] something to exist outside of time to
[1:02:02] never have a start we can't even explain
[1:02:04] that and God never chose to show us how
[1:02:06] that we're we're not able to to
[1:02:08] understand it maybe we'll understand it
[1:02:09] on the other side but God was not
[1:02:11] created he was not made he just was he
[1:02:15] was the self-existing one amen and we
[1:02:17] can't understand it and so we won't try
[1:02:19] and understand it all we do is we accept
[1:02:21] it as the attribute of God that he was
[1:02:23] in fact when he comes now to Moses
[1:02:25] remember what he says I am he's just
[1:02:28] there and he's there in the future he's
[1:02:30] there in the past he always was he
[1:02:31] always will be there is no destroying
[1:02:33] him amen but now we're not talking about
[1:02:36] God we're talking about the Son of God
[1:02:37] we're talking about Christ and it says
[1:02:39] he's the firstborn the first creation
[1:02:43] and that seems to make him an obvious
[1:02:45] separation from God we'd
[1:02:47] think but we have to see what that
[1:02:49] looked like in the scripture because
[1:02:50] otherwise we we we start to go with this
[1:02:53] idea of God the son rather than the son
[1:02:55] of God and that's where we get into all
[1:02:57] sorts of problems so let's continue in
[1:02:59] Colossians and then we'll go back to to
[1:03:01] Genesis to see the origin of the Son of
[1:03:03] God it says the Son of God was the first
[1:03:05] creation and then let's see what it says
[1:03:08] that Son of God did it says for by him
[1:03:11] were all things
[1:03:14] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:03:17] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:03:20] be Thrones or dominions or
[1:03:22] principalities or Powers it says all
[1:03:25] things were created by Him and for him
[1:03:29] who the Son of God Christ okay so I want
[1:03:33] us to build on the foundation of the
[1:03:34] word here to see this it says that the
[1:03:36] Son of God created everything and
[1:03:38] everything that was created was created
[1:03:40] for him it was created by Him it belongs
[1:03:43] to him it's his It All Belongs to Christ
[1:03:47] okay we're talking about this world
[1:03:49] that's what we're looking at in the the
[1:03:51] things around it now we go to Psalm 24
[1:03:53] it says the Earth is whose the Lords and
[1:03:57] the fullness thereof the world and they
[1:04:00] that dwell therein then we come to acts
[1:04:02] 236 and Peter says therefore let all the
[1:04:05] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[1:04:07] ha made the same Jesus whom ye have
[1:04:10] crucified both what Lord and Christ Lord
[1:04:14] and Christ so it says the Earth is the
[1:04:16] Lords it says it was created by the Son
[1:04:18] of God so who created all these things
[1:04:21] because time and time again we see in
[1:04:23] the New Testament that they refer to
[1:04:25] Christ as Lord and he says even as we
[1:04:27] read in communion ye say well for so I
[1:04:30] am he is Lord amen that is a title that
[1:04:34] is a position amen and we're going to
[1:04:36] try and we can't separate now Psalms
[1:04:39] from acts and say well that was a
[1:04:40] different Lord and now there's another
[1:04:41] Lord no it's all Christ It All Belongs
[1:04:44] to him the name of the son of God is
[1:04:46] Jesus Christ but the fullness of his
[1:04:48] Revelation is that he is Lord Jesus
[1:04:51] Christ amen we'll see it as we go it's
[1:04:55] it says now as we continue in Colossians
[1:04:57] it says and he is before all things and
[1:05:00] by him all things consist so it says he
[1:05:03] came first and it's by him alone that
[1:05:05] everything that's in this world that
[1:05:06] goes on in this world it's held together
[1:05:08] it functions how he's the one that
[1:05:10] maintains life it's all the work of
[1:05:13] Christ it's all the work of the Son of
[1:05:14] God it says and he is the head of the
[1:05:17] body the church who is the
[1:05:19] beginning so the church period Then he
[1:05:22] says who is the beginning who Christ the
[1:05:25] first form from the dead that in all
[1:05:27] things he might have the preeminence for
[1:05:30] it pleased the father that in him should
[1:05:33] all fullness
[1:05:35] dwell now it says in him should all
[1:05:37] fullness dwell and that's a key phrase
[1:05:40] because if you're looking in the Trinity
[1:05:42] we have this Paradox we mentioned where
[1:05:43] it says that they were all
[1:05:46] powerful and yet now we have it says
[1:05:48] that everything's in
[1:05:51] one all the fullness is in
[1:05:54] one so so if they're equally powerful
[1:05:56] equal in strength they're not all
[1:05:58] powerful now he says Paul says the Son
[1:06:00] of God is the dwelling place for the
[1:06:02] fullness of God he's where all of God is
[1:06:06] as it relates to us amen he's everything
[1:06:08] that God is he has all of God that in
[1:06:11] him that can be placed in a being
[1:06:13] knowing God isn't limited but yet
[1:06:15] everything that can be placed inside of
[1:06:17] of a being is placed in Christ amen so
[1:06:21] the scripture says he is the firstborn
[1:06:23] the Christ is the first creation and if
[1:06:25] that is true then we ought to be able to
[1:06:27] go back to the very beginning and see
[1:06:30] him amen the scripture can't lie and so
[1:06:33] what we see in Colossians we ought to be
[1:06:35] able to go directly back to Genesis and
[1:06:37] see at the very beginning and we can so
[1:06:40] if we go to Genesis 1 it says in the
[1:06:42] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:06:44] Earth
[1:06:46] period not as we see it
[1:06:49] today it was it was just a lump it had
[1:06:53] water on it mostly it was covered by
[1:06:55] water there is no real light there was
[1:06:57] no life it was just chaos it was just
[1:06:59] something sitting there okay amen and
[1:07:03] from this point until the end of verse 2
[1:07:05] and three we have no idea what that
[1:07:07] timeline is it could be a day it could
[1:07:10] be an hour or it could be billions of
[1:07:12] years we don't know scripture doesn't
[1:07:15] say and it really doesn't matter to us
[1:07:17] CU it it's not the beginning that's not
[1:07:19] the beginning the beginning is verse
[1:07:21] three really verse end of verse two and
[1:07:23] then start of verse three it says the
[1:07:26] Earth was without form and void there
[1:07:28] was nothing there and darkness was upon
[1:07:30] the face of the deep so the whole the
[1:07:32] the entire world system the entire world
[1:07:35] was in darkness there was no light at
[1:07:37] all total darkness he says and that now
[1:07:40] what happens the spirit of God moved
[1:07:42] upon the face of the waters now who is
[1:07:44] the spirit of God it's the holy spirit
[1:07:47] amen it's God himself it's God our
[1:07:50] Father and he's moving across the Earth
[1:07:52] and what is he doing he's trying to
[1:07:54] produce life
[1:07:56] cuz it's just void it's Darkness there's
[1:07:58] nothing there now let's use the
[1:08:00] continuity of scripture here Paul said
[1:08:01] that the Son of God was the firstborn of
[1:08:03] every creature so he was the first thing
[1:08:05] that God created within this Earthly
[1:08:08] dimension of time space and matter okay
[1:08:11] he was the start of it all now watch how
[1:08:13] this looks because we have to see the
[1:08:15] continuity of scripture otherwise we
[1:08:16] miss the Simplicity of how God's
[1:08:18] revealing himself and verse three says
[1:08:20] and God said let there be light and
[1:08:23] there was light
[1:08:26] he said and God saw the light that it
[1:08:28] was good and God divided the light from
[1:08:31] the darkness now there's a separation
[1:08:32] there of light and darkness we see that
[1:08:34] as the nature of light today we see that
[1:08:36] as the the the properties of light is
[1:08:39] that you can't have light and darkness
[1:08:40] simultaneously but that is literally a
[1:08:43] cre a a work of God that that's how it
[1:08:46] works that you can't blend light and
[1:08:48] darkness that's that's what God did
[1:08:50] that's how he defined light is that
[1:08:52] there can't be any darkness in it
[1:08:53] they're incompatible you can't be in
[1:08:55] light and darkness
[1:08:57] simultaneously you can't have it you
[1:08:59] can't say your light and then have a
[1:09:01] shadow or have a dark spot in you you
[1:09:04] can't do it it's impossible now God
[1:09:06] called the light day and the Darkness he
[1:09:08] called night so when he separated it now
[1:09:10] he had a definition for what that looks
[1:09:13] like he says in the evening and the
[1:09:15] morning were the first day now people
[1:09:17] think well that's where he created the
[1:09:18] Sun the moon and the stars but if you go
[1:09:20] down in your Bible those were not
[1:09:22] created as light until Genesis 1:4 14
[1:09:25] and 19 which is the fourth day the first
[1:09:28] day the first creative act of God is to
[1:09:30] create a light that is not the Sun the
[1:09:33] moon and the
[1:09:35] stars so what is this light what is this
[1:09:38] light we have to be able to see what
[1:09:39] this
[1:09:40] is we have to know what Genesis 1:3 is
[1:09:44] and he says let there be light and there
[1:09:46] was light now if we go back to 1 John 1
[1:09:49] it says then this is the message which
[1:09:50] we have heard of him and declare unto
[1:09:52] you that God is light
[1:09:55] and in him is no Darkness at all what
[1:09:57] did Genesis 1:3 says or 1:4 it says that
[1:10:01] God divided the light from the darkness
[1:10:03] there is no darkness in God Amen he is
[1:10:06] all light the light was divided from the
[1:10:08] darkness God is light he says and if we
[1:10:11] say that we have fellowship with him and
[1:10:13] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:10:15] truth why because those are divided you
[1:10:17] can't be in both
[1:10:19] simultaneously now James comes along and
[1:10:21] he says every good gift and every
[1:10:23] perfect gift is from above
[1:10:25] and cometh down from the Father of
[1:10:27] Lights with whom is no variableness
[1:10:30] neither shadow of turning in other words
[1:10:33] God is pure light today we can have
[1:10:36] impure light we don't really tend to
[1:10:39] know what pure light is I'm going to
[1:10:40] talk about it in a minute what it looks
[1:10:41] like but we have lights that flicker
[1:10:44] these lights are flickering you can't
[1:10:45] tell that but they're flickering they're
[1:10:48] not perfect because the the current
[1:10:49] that's flowing through them is not
[1:10:51] necessarily simultaneous and so there's
[1:10:53] little blinks in there and if you could
[1:10:54] you can you can see it if you take a
[1:10:56] very fast shutter speed with your camera
[1:10:57] you'll see that there is no light at
[1:10:59] times in these lights it looks like it's
[1:11:01] always there but it's not there is a
[1:11:03] shadow there is a variableness in these
[1:11:05] lights but God is not that way it's
[1:11:08] perfect light he is perfect light amen
[1:11:10] there's nothing that's dark about him
[1:11:11] there's no Shadows there and then we
[1:11:14] come so we're going through the
[1:11:15] scriptures now then we come to the very
[1:11:17] end amen we come down to the New
[1:11:18] Jerusalem it says the city had no need
[1:11:21] of the sun neither of the moon to shine
[1:11:23] in it for the glory of God did lighten
[1:11:27] it and what the lamb is the light
[1:11:31] thereof now I want you to notice
[1:11:33] something who is the Lamb that is we we
[1:11:36] cannot debate who that is he is Christ
[1:11:40] Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God Amen
[1:11:43] what did John say Behold the Lamb of God
[1:11:46] he died as the lamb he's a lamb slain
[1:11:48] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:11:50] and in the new heavens and the new Earth
[1:11:52] when we go back to our original
[1:11:53] conditions and inheritance is what is it
[1:11:56] that we walk into we walk into a city
[1:11:59] with perfect light all over again it's
[1:12:02] the original light it's the source of
[1:12:04] light now I was I was showing something
[1:12:06] to my wife here the other day and when
[1:12:08] you look at the 12 gemstones that make
[1:12:11] up the New Jerusalem when you put them
[1:12:15] so all of those stones have a certain
[1:12:17] amount of light or color okay but when
[1:12:20] you put them through pure light and they
[1:12:22] have to filter light to get it purely
[1:12:24] when you put pure light on those gems
[1:12:27] they light up
[1:12:29] completely they have light and colors
[1:12:31] that they never had before it takes pure
[1:12:34] light to reveal the beauty that's within
[1:12:36] them but if you take a diamond for
[1:12:39] instance and put it under pure light you
[1:12:41] know what it does it goes
[1:12:44] black it has its own light and it's a
[1:12:47] type of the world as it is because the
[1:12:49] things that we value have nothing in the
[1:12:51] presence of God and the humble things
[1:12:54] the little things in the presence of him
[1:12:56] they just just they just explode into
[1:12:58] color and it's a reflection of him
[1:13:01] rather than the beauty that we have
[1:13:03] ourselves unless you're in his presence
[1:13:05] those Jewels have no great Beauty
[1:13:07] comparable to a diamond if we were to
[1:13:09] choose Beauty we'd say go with diamonds
[1:13:11] they're rare they sparkle they have the
[1:13:13] but in that light if the city was made
[1:13:15] out of diamonds it would be
[1:13:17] black sisters diamonds are not a woman's
[1:13:20] best
[1:13:21] friend I've got a Doctrine for it now
[1:13:23] this is where it starts
[1:13:26] but in that light it's perfect and
[1:13:29] everything comes into these great colors
[1:13:32] the scripture says the glory of God did
[1:13:34] lighten it the scripture didn't say
[1:13:35] there is no sun moon there it says it's
[1:13:38] not needed it's not needed amen says
[1:13:42] there's NE no need for them because the
[1:13:44] lamb Christ himself is the light of it
[1:13:46] all now let's take it all the way back
[1:13:47] through the scriptures we go back to
[1:13:49] John 18 it says then spake Jesus unto
[1:13:51] them saying I am the light of the world
[1:13:55] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:13:57] darkness but shall have the light of
[1:14:00] what life this is not just light for the
[1:14:03] sake of light but it's light for the
[1:14:04] sake of life amen Jesus in preview of
[1:14:08] where we're going with this whole series
[1:14:10] said in Matthew 5 ye are the light of
[1:14:12] the world but here he says I am the
[1:14:15] light of the world but there's coming a
[1:14:16] day where there's a transferral of the
[1:14:18] very thing that made him light into us
[1:14:20] that makes us the light of the world but
[1:14:22] looking backwards he was the original
[1:14:25] light he wasn't just the light of that
[1:14:26] day he was the light all along that
[1:14:28] brought forth life in Genesis now Christ
[1:14:31] is coming down to the end of his time on
[1:14:32] Earth as the Lamb of God to be
[1:14:34] sacrificed and he's talking of glory and
[1:14:37] watch how he says this now we can see
[1:14:39] who the light is at the end of The Plan
[1:14:41] of Redemption but remember which was is
[1:14:43] what shall be what it was in the
[1:14:45] beginning is what it will be at the end
[1:14:47] there's no there's no big reveal here it
[1:14:49] always was the same thing amen watch
[1:14:52] what Jesus says now and we're going back
[1:14:53] to the Garden of Gethsemane he says and
[1:14:55] now oh Father glorify thou me what with
[1:15:00] thine own self with the glory which I
[1:15:04] had with thee before the world was see
[1:15:08] he was pointing forward when he
[1:15:10] says he's pointing forward now and he's
[1:15:13] saying Lord make me what I was before so
[1:15:17] he's pointing forward but he's showing
[1:15:19] what he was in the beginning and that's
[1:15:21] the basis for what Christ is is what he
[1:15:24] was in the beginning is what he's going
[1:15:25] to always be at the end and we can look
[1:15:27] in Revelation 21 which we read and we
[1:15:30] see what that glory is he says what
[1:15:33] thine own self the glory of Christ is
[1:15:36] God indwelling him wrapped in light and
[1:15:39] that entire being is Christ the original
[1:15:42] lamb that's who he is amen the glory
[1:15:45] that Jesus had before the world as we
[1:15:47] know it is the person of God within a
[1:15:50] body that's the glory that's our Glory
[1:15:54] our glory is the presence of God within
[1:15:56] us there's nothing in this flesh that we
[1:15:57] should Glory but it's Christ in us that
[1:15:59] we would glory in that's what brother
[1:16:01] Bram says now he says when God way back
[1:16:04] before there was a star in heaven before
[1:16:07] there was even light in the skies God
[1:16:09] was there God dwelling he says all that
[1:16:11] great space of Eternity to Eternity God
[1:16:14] was setting back in eternity he says
[1:16:16] then out of God came the logos which we
[1:16:19] would say it like a little sacred light
[1:16:21] that moved out of that Darkness or out
[1:16:24] of that eternal he says as a child
[1:16:27] playing before the father's house and in
[1:16:29] his infinite mind he had the scene of
[1:16:31] what would be at the end from the
[1:16:35] beginning that he was then so what you
[1:16:37] see at the end is what he was in the
[1:16:40] beginning amen there's no new revelation
[1:16:42] here it's always it always was amen so
[1:16:45] what was at the beginning is what will
[1:16:46] be at the end so there's a lamb that's a
[1:16:48] light at the end which means it had to
[1:16:50] be a lamb that was a light at the
[1:16:51] beginning that's what Jesus was saying
[1:16:53] amen there's a lamb SL came from the
[1:16:55] foundation of the world and that's the
[1:16:56] original light now notice what he says
[1:16:59] there he says that logos out of God came
[1:17:01] the logos and he says that logos is a
[1:17:04] light and he says he doesn't say it is a
[1:17:06] child playing before God it is like it
[1:17:09] he's trying to draw a similar to what we
[1:17:10] would have in our life today where a a
[1:17:13] child would come from the father amen
[1:17:15] but when we look at Genesis 1 what
[1:17:18] happened is God the Eternal Spirits
[1:17:20] dwelling alone with himself it's just
[1:17:22] him and it's his attributes and ideas
[1:17:24] and he is everywhere and he's the
[1:17:26] unchanging God okay so this is my this
[1:17:28] is my drawing of God now I'm no brother
[1:17:31] Mark but we're going to do this as best
[1:17:32] we can so I've drawn a boundary around
[1:17:35] the edge and I've made it kind of
[1:17:37] nebulous
[1:17:38] because everything on this page if we
[1:17:40] were going to say is God he's not
[1:17:42] limited by that boundary but I've just
[1:17:43] made it there to show that everything on
[1:17:45] this page is going to be him and we see
[1:17:47] there that he's a spirit he's invisible
[1:17:49] he's shapeless he's boundless he's
[1:17:50] Eternal he's Supernatural he's holy and
[1:17:53] within God are all these things we have
[1:17:55] all the thoughts of God we have the
[1:17:57] attributes of God we have the plans of
[1:17:59] God we have the children of God we're in
[1:18:01] this picture Church we're there we're
[1:18:04] there there's all the expressions of God
[1:18:06] the purpose of God everything that God
[1:18:09] is is right there but that's all it is
[1:18:12] it's just
[1:18:13] there it's in him but it's not expressed
[1:18:17] in any way
[1:18:18] okay but now within God what happens is
[1:18:22] things start to happen within him amen
[1:18:25] and what it it is is it's his thoughts
[1:18:28] it's his plans and his ideas as they
[1:18:30] relate to us as they relate to this
[1:18:32] world and that's a portion of God okay
[1:18:36] it's not all of God but it's our portion
[1:18:39] of God the things that relate to us amen
[1:18:41] it's all from God but it's not all that
[1:18:44] God is and we call this the
[1:18:47] word and we have a written portion we
[1:18:50] have a written record of what that was
[1:18:52] right here this is what God was thinking
[1:18:55] right here and this is what you and I
[1:18:56] were right here this is the plan all of
[1:18:59] these different things the attributes of
[1:19:00] God it's all written here but it was in
[1:19:02] his mind it was in his thinking before
[1:19:04] all of these things amen it's all of God
[1:19:07] that relates to us as we needed to go
[1:19:10] through this life and return back to God
[1:19:12] it's called the word amen we can't
[1:19:13] absorb everything of God because we are
[1:19:16] uh we're we're in a natural body with a
[1:19:17] natural mind we're limited am me we
[1:19:20] bypassed our theophany and so we can't
[1:19:22] absorb all these things but God has now
[1:19:24] dwelling within him he has a portion he
[1:19:27] has a thought he has a plan he has
[1:19:28] children and we call that the word the
[1:19:30] scripture calls it the word not me
[1:19:33] that's what the scripture calls it amen
[1:19:35] now what happens is God has all of this
[1:19:37] there and then what happens is God spoke
[1:19:39] and what did he say he said let there be
[1:19:42] light and so out of him now comes the
[1:19:45] the word that was a thought now it is
[1:19:47] the spoken
[1:19:49] word okay that's the spoken word that
[1:19:51] comes out of him he says let there be
[1:19:53] light and what happen
[1:19:55] the thoughts the Expressions the plans
[1:19:57] of God went out of him not out of him
[1:20:01] because he's everywhere but rather they
[1:20:03] went forth would be the way to put it
[1:20:05] okay so they went forth from God it
[1:20:08] didn't separate itself from him but
[1:20:10] rather it came out of him and it was put
[1:20:12] into action by the spoken word okay
[1:20:15] that's what God's doing so what happens
[1:20:17] after that spoken word Goes Forth is
[1:20:19] what
[1:20:21] light because what he thought of first
[1:20:24] was
[1:20:25] light so he's producing the word but the
[1:20:28] first thing that he produces is light
[1:20:30] and when God thought and spoke by the
[1:20:32] word then it became reality so logos
[1:20:35] went out of God the word went out of God
[1:20:37] that's what logos is it's just the word
[1:20:39] the word went out of God and it came
[1:20:41] into existence and what was that light
[1:20:43] what was that logos it was light it was
[1:20:47] what we would call the pillar of fire
[1:20:50] okay so what is it the the logos the the
[1:20:54] light is what it's the what living
[1:20:56] manifestation of the word it's the
[1:20:58] reality of the word it's God living in
[1:21:02] and through his word that's all it is
[1:21:05] okay God didn't just make this light to
[1:21:07] to look at he made it for a purpose and
[1:21:10] so what did God do God didn't just let
[1:21:12] the light sit there but it was a created
[1:21:14] Supernatural light and it's a place
[1:21:17] where the invisible spirit of God Elohim
[1:21:19] now the self-existing one could step
[1:21:21] into and dwell and so God steps in into
[1:21:25] that Pillar of Fire amen and that light
[1:21:28] now becomes God
[1:21:32] visible that's the son right there the
[1:21:35] Son of God it's a body it's a being
[1:21:38] created for God to dwell in see we look
[1:21:42] at at this idea and this is I think the
[1:21:44] the great problem with the Trinity is
[1:21:46] they keep looking at persons as if God
[1:21:48] has to always be a person no he just
[1:21:51] needs a body to work through he just
[1:21:54] needs an expression it's him over and
[1:21:56] over and over again in whichever way he
[1:21:59] chooses amen so the light was not God
[1:22:01] himself but when God stepped into it
[1:22:04] then that light was all God it was not
[1:22:08] all of God but it was all God it was
[1:22:11] 100% so my DNA is 50% Lanny klet 50%
[1:22:14] Sandy klet okay so I'm not all dad and
[1:22:18] I'm not all mom but when this light came
[1:22:21] forth it was by the word and the word is
[1:22:23] a part of God and so that light is 100%
[1:22:27] DNA of God if we want to put it that way
[1:22:29] it source is all God so the light is
[1:22:31] perfectly God there's no other thing
[1:22:33] mixed into it it's all God but it's not
[1:22:35] all that God is if I could put it that
[1:22:38] way amen that light becomes God to us
[1:22:41] amen what was it it was Christ it was
[1:22:43] the anointed one The Dwelling Place of
[1:22:45] God that's all Christ means is the
[1:22:47] anointed one and the word Christ
[1:22:49] indicates the presence of God in a body
[1:22:53] that's it and like I said we can't look
[1:22:55] at the body as if it is a body of a
[1:22:58] person but rather whatever God steps
[1:23:00] into becomes him and that's the way it
[1:23:03] is amen it's a body of light in this
[1:23:05] case because that was an attribute that
[1:23:06] God tied to himself and so there you
[1:23:09] have God invisible form you have God
[1:23:11] living and dwelling in his own word
[1:23:14] amen it's not only a person but then we
[1:23:17] now we come back to John 1:1 and we can
[1:23:19] start to understand now how this works
[1:23:22] because John 1:1 says in the beginning
[1:23:24] was the
[1:23:25] word and then it says the word was with
[1:23:28] God and then it says the Word was God
[1:23:30] and that is three separate
[1:23:33] events three separate Expressions if we
[1:23:35] want to put it so if we go back to our
[1:23:37] diagram now we look on the left side in
[1:23:40] the beginning was the word what is it
[1:23:42] it's the thoughts and and the attributes
[1:23:44] of God and it was with God it was a part
[1:23:46] of him not expressed but it was there
[1:23:49] and then by the spoken word it's
[1:23:51] expressed out of his mouth and then it's
[1:23:54] manif ested into reality and now the
[1:23:57] Word was God because God steps into it
[1:24:00] it's with him and now God steps into it
[1:24:02] and that becomes God to us it's not all
[1:24:04] of God but God steps into it the
[1:24:06] fullness of God steps into that amen so
[1:24:10] it's all God but it's not all of God as
[1:24:12] I've said before so he spoke that word
[1:24:14] and it left him and it becomes light and
[1:24:16] now God pours himself into that light
[1:24:19] and he can dwell there and he can be
[1:24:21] there and that light was all of God he's
[1:24:23] a spirit everywhere the time so it's not
[1:24:25] that God lost or changed himself but God
[1:24:27] said this is how I'm going to reveal
[1:24:29] myself and interact with my creation now
[1:24:32] so God poured all of the
[1:24:34] attributes that he is into that there's
[1:24:38] no variance there's no difference
[1:24:39] between what's in that light and who God
[1:24:41] is everything that God is the nature of
[1:24:44] God he poured into there amen and it's
[1:24:46] for this season and time this blip and
[1:24:48] Eternity and God said this is for me
[1:24:50] this is my portion to work in and that's
[1:24:52] the expression of God the light on its
[1:24:54] own is not God but as soon as God steps
[1:24:56] into it God now that's the god that's
[1:24:58] revealed to us that's the way it works
[1:25:00] amen it's all God it's just not all of
[1:25:02] him but it's him that's that's the
[1:25:05] difficulty for for people to understand
[1:25:07] is that something can be God and yet not
[1:25:08] be all of him it's the only thing he can
[1:25:11] do there he's just fitting himself in a
[1:25:13] vessel that we can sort of understand
[1:25:16] but he's everywhere amen the invisible
[1:25:18] God always remains the invisible God but
[1:25:21] he's putting himself into something and
[1:25:23] what he's doing he's a spirit he's life
[1:25:25] he's omnipotent he's omniscient he's
[1:25:27] omnipresent and all that Arrow
[1:25:28] represents there's not something that
[1:25:30] leaves God but rather it's the
[1:25:32] expressing of God and it comes out of
[1:25:34] himself in order to be manifested okay
[1:25:37] it becomes the embodiment of God it
[1:25:39] becomes a theophany is what the
[1:25:40] scripture calls it amen it's a
[1:25:42] supernatural body and brother Bradon
[1:25:44] would say that God God's body it can be
[1:25:46] a light it can be the angel of the Lord
[1:25:49] it can be MDC it can be a whirlwind it
[1:25:53] can be a burning bush
[1:25:54] it can be a pillar of fire it can be a
[1:25:57] pillar of
[1:25:58] cloud all of these things is is God
[1:26:01] being expressed in a body and those
[1:26:04] bodies can
[1:26:05] speak right the pillar of fire can
[1:26:09] speak the burning bush could speak there
[1:26:12] came a
[1:26:14] voice out of the
[1:26:16] wind all of these things can speak God
[1:26:19] is not limited to a a body of a human he
[1:26:21] is whatever he dwells in that is God
[1:26:24] that can work inside of it amen so that
[1:26:26] logos that light there that that that
[1:26:29] expression of the word the manifestation
[1:26:30] of the word is the same substance as God
[1:26:33] is if it had DNA it would be the exact
[1:26:36] same DNA as God it's only when we come
[1:26:38] to Jesus that we get to see physical DNA
[1:26:40] if we wanted to put it that way amen but
[1:26:42] it's the same life life essence of as
[1:26:45] God is amen and so it's that part of God
[1:26:48] that came out just before the creation
[1:26:50] of this world as it is today that's John
[1:26:53] 1:1 and this is the whole whole picture
[1:26:54] of John 1:1 the word was with God the
[1:26:57] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:26:59] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:27:01] because the start of the beginning is
[1:27:02] the thought and the expression of God in
[1:27:04] his mind soon as he starts to think that
[1:27:06] then that's when time starts to tick and
[1:27:08] then from that thinking there comes a
[1:27:09] speaking and from the speaking comes the
[1:27:11] reality and that's the beginning is as
[1:27:13] soon as we come into reality there's
[1:27:14] time started amen there's a clock that's
[1:27:16] ticking and what is it it's God creating
[1:27:19] All Things by the word amen that's what
[1:27:21] he's doing brother bramin says this now
[1:27:24] he says I can see him speak to this
[1:27:26] world hanging there as an icicle
[1:27:28] whatever it was way way away and he
[1:27:30] moved it over here I see this little
[1:27:32] like go out that that logos that Pillar
[1:27:34] of Fire he says now we got two now the
[1:27:38] father and out of the father come the
[1:27:40] light the sun he says and I can see that
[1:27:43] light moving over here and it pulled the
[1:27:45] Earth over near the sun to dry it off
[1:27:48] and he began to raise the water up and
[1:27:50] separated the land the Earth from the
[1:27:52] water and so forth and then he be to
[1:27:54] create and he made the fishes of the sea
[1:27:56] the vegetable life he put the cattle on
[1:27:58] the hill and it all looked good to him
[1:28:00] who did Christ that light the Sun the s
[1:28:05] o n the s o n but now brother Braham
[1:28:08] says this he says now we got two
[1:28:11] there he says in you Oneness Brethren
[1:28:14] many of you get off the wrong track when
[1:28:16] you try to think of God as one like your
[1:28:18] finger is one he says he can't be his
[1:28:20] own father he can't be but he is God he
[1:28:24] says God is Jehovah the spirit Christ
[1:28:27] was the house that he dwelt in so the
[1:28:30] fact is that this logos this word is
[1:28:33] simply God expressing himself visibly
[1:28:35] within our Dimension so first it was in
[1:28:38] God then it comes out of God and now it
[1:28:40] is with God Amen but it does not become
[1:28:43] less of God it is God from start to
[1:28:46] finish it is all from God Amen so you
[1:28:49] can't see God because he's a spirit but
[1:28:50] now God becomes visible so is that logos
[1:28:53] really God
[1:28:55] sure but it's an expression of him and
[1:28:58] that's why it was with him amen it's not
[1:29:01] it is two but it is not two
[1:29:04] persons that's the problem is when you
[1:29:06] start to make personalities now you have
[1:29:08] Wills Natures desires thoughts and
[1:29:09] opinions and all these different things
[1:29:11] it is not two persons it is a body and
[1:29:14] it is god with his
[1:29:15] body amen God dwelling in his body amen
[1:29:19] that's why it's with him it's God in his
[1:29:20] body so whenever you see the scripture
[1:29:22] like we read in Colossians one that God
[1:29:25] created everything through Jesus Christ
[1:29:27] it means he created All Things by and
[1:29:29] through his spoken word the word itself
[1:29:32] became a manifestation and then out of
[1:29:34] that word flowed the rest of the word
[1:29:37] amen so while the logos the word that
[1:29:40] Pillar of Fire it's numerically distinct
[1:29:42] brother BR would say we got two now amen
[1:29:45] he says he's not one like your finger is
[1:29:47] one it's not a distinct personality from
[1:29:50] God it's not a different personality
[1:29:51] from the invisible God it's a super
[1:29:54] superatural but visible extension of God
[1:29:56] himself amen that pillar fire could talk
[1:29:59] it could act it could move it could
[1:30:01] touch it was a supernatural body with
[1:30:04] God in it working and moving God showing
[1:30:07] himself amen and what does that word do
[1:30:10] it continues the creation work the plan
[1:30:12] of God by the word of God you look at at
[1:30:15] that diagram and you can see two but
[1:30:17] it's not two like we think cuz it's all
[1:30:19] encapsulated in what God is amen God
[1:30:22] isn't one like we think because he's
[1:30:24] that Spirit he's Unbound he's limited
[1:30:25] like the air we talked about he he he
[1:30:28] isn't limited that way he can be around
[1:30:29] you and in you at the same time you can
[1:30:31] have air within you and outside of you
[1:30:33] and all through these things and and in
[1:30:35] a compressor or whatever and it doesn't
[1:30:36] change the fact that there's air
[1:30:37] everywhere but we can't see it but yet
[1:30:40] it's there but now you put it in
[1:30:41] something and you can squeeze it there's
[1:30:43] air in this I can squeeze it and I can
[1:30:44] only go so far why because there's air
[1:30:46] inside of it if that was God we'd say
[1:30:48] there's God inside of it cuz I can feel
[1:30:50] I can't see him but I can feel how he's
[1:30:51] resisting the motion here amen amen so
[1:30:55] God has an expression and a
[1:30:57] manifestation and that's the logos
[1:30:58] that's the word so everything we see of
[1:31:01] God is that logos it's that word and God
[1:31:03] wanted to reveal himself and so out of
[1:31:05] him came that logos that body it's the
[1:31:22] theophonic then clearly God is not bound
[1:31:25] by
[1:31:26] us so why is he Bound by
[1:31:29] Christ we'll get into what that fullness
[1:31:31] means cuz I think some of you are
[1:31:32] thinking that well he said the fullness
[1:31:33] but we'll talk about what that fullness
[1:31:35] is man but this light this fire and this
[1:31:38] is where we're going to go and we're
[1:31:39] almost done this
[1:31:41] evening amen it's it was God and what
[1:31:43] was he doing brother bran would say he's
[1:31:44] putting on a
[1:31:47] mask when you say he's putting on a body
[1:31:49] that's what trips people up because they
[1:31:51] keep thinking Body Mind personality
[1:31:53] these things like like Jesus Christ was
[1:31:55] on this Earth but it's God just putting
[1:31:57] on a first mask and what is this first
[1:31:58] mask it's God above us you'll never see
[1:32:01] brother Bram say it's God the father in
[1:32:03] that sense and God the son he doesn't
[1:32:06] use those terms because it's it's
[1:32:07] trinitarian terms but he says it's God
[1:32:09] above us God With Us and God in us and
[1:32:13] you'll see that it's what we read it
[1:32:15] says God is above us God is through us
[1:32:17] and God is in
[1:32:18] US amen it's it's God revealing himself
[1:32:21] and the first mask of God is the pillar
[1:32:22] of Fire it's the word logos it's a it's
[1:32:25] a it's a fiery being it's a light and we
[1:32:28] know this fire we know what this light
[1:32:29] is we know what this fire is it's
[1:32:31] clearly identified through scriptures
[1:32:33] and we'll we'll start that next service
[1:32:34] Lord willing but we can even understand
[1:32:37] it as we look at ourselves amen we are a
[1:32:39] body we are a soul and we are a spirit
[1:32:42] we're one person but we have an
[1:32:43] expression of three things amen I have
[1:32:46] an expression through my soul I have an
[1:32:48] expression through my spirit or my mind
[1:32:50] then I have an expression through my
[1:32:52] body and there's different senses that
[1:32:53] go with with all of those different
[1:32:54] things so I am one and yet there's three
[1:32:56] things going on in me at the same
[1:32:58] time none of them is different from me
[1:33:01] it's all a part of me but there's a
[1:33:03] different expression each time amen so
[1:33:05] we're not one like our finger is one
[1:33:08] we've got a lot going on inside of that
[1:33:09] finger if we were to put it that way and
[1:33:11] God's not like our
[1:33:12] finger brother Jason said it this way he
[1:33:14] says God is the unfolding God and I
[1:33:18] thought that was a beautiful way to put
[1:33:19] it you know the scripture says and Jesus
[1:33:21] warned them in Matthew 24 he says
[1:33:23] there'll be false
[1:33:25] christs that say Christ is here and
[1:33:27] Christ is there he says don't believe
[1:33:29] them you know why because there's going
[1:33:31] to be real christs and they don't have
[1:33:33] to say go here and go there they're
[1:33:34] going to say he's right
[1:33:36] here it's not that there won't be
[1:33:38] christs it's that the real ones don't
[1:33:40] have to point you elsewhere forth
[1:33:42] they'll be able to say he's in my heart
[1:33:43] he's living in me showing the world that
[1:33:45] he's alive and well amen but if we go to
[1:33:48] John 1 as we just start to close here he
[1:33:51] says what in the beginning was the word
[1:33:53] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:33:55] he says the same was in the beginning
[1:33:58] with God all things were made by him and
[1:34:02] without him was not anything made that
[1:34:04] was made by who Christ we read it in
[1:34:06] Colossians 1 Christ's identification is
[1:34:09] the word that's how we identify him amen
[1:34:12] and we see that the word means the
[1:34:13] expression of the thoughts and
[1:34:15] intentions of God it's the anointed one
[1:34:17] it's the manifestation it's the
[1:34:18] expression it's the visible image it's
[1:34:20] the the reality of God in him who in him
[1:34:24] in the word in Christ was life why cuz
[1:34:27] life follows light and you couldn't have
[1:34:30] life unless you had light and as soon as
[1:34:32] that light is created we start to see
[1:34:33] Life come with it he says now and that
[1:34:35] life was the light of men and the light
[1:34:38] shineth in darkness and darkness
[1:34:41] comprehended it not what did Genesis 1:4
[1:34:44] say light and darkness were divided
[1:34:47] Darkness could not overcome light light
[1:34:49] winds Darkness cannot stay in the
[1:34:51] presence of light amen God bless you
[1:34:53] let's stand this evening with teaching I
[1:34:55] don't want to go too long that's for
[1:34:57] sure and we'll carry on what this light
[1:34:59] is and and the revealing of Christ as we
[1:35:02] go through this this this short portion
[1:35:04] of this series amen God bless you let's
[1:35:06] bow our heads Heavenly
[1:35:09] Father Lord I can feel so inadequate at
[1:35:12] times when we get into some of these
[1:35:14] things but Lord I pray that there's a
[1:35:16] Clarity here that comes from your word
[1:35:18] Lord that as we go through this Lord
[1:35:19] that it would lock in these these
[1:35:21] scriptural truths Lord that have been
[1:35:23] revealed to us us Lord in this last age
[1:35:25] Lord like they were in the first Lord
[1:35:27] and I pray that you'd help us to see not
[1:35:28] just who you are and who you were Lord
[1:35:31] but that we could clearly identify you
[1:35:32] in our own lives Lord that we could see
[1:35:34] how it is that you can be God and you
[1:35:36] can be around and through and yet in US
[1:35:38] each and every one Lord that we could
[1:35:40] live a life that's Christ in us the hope
[1:35:42] of glory Lord and that we could come
[1:35:44] through it all Lord that we we'd be able
[1:35:47] to express your word just as Christ did
[1:35:49] on this Earth as well we pray Lord I
[1:35:51] pray you bless your people Lord be with
[1:35:53] us this night we ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:35:55] name
[1:36:00] amen it's Jesus I really want to see
