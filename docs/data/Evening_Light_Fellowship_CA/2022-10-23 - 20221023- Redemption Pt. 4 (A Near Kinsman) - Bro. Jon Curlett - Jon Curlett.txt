each one we pray Lord would you just speak again this morning Lord just once more maybe this will be the last time the Lord we plead your mercy and Grace in the meantime Lord we claim that blood oh we claim that blood every day let us never stray too far from Calvary Lord Jesus Lord will let us be reminded every day Lord that it's your lord the the shed blood of Calvary Lord that keeps us clean in your eyes every day Lord and we're so thankful that the life of that blood is living within us Lord that we could live before you in Perfection and maturity Heavenly Father Lord just be with us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen God bless you this morning if you turn the scriptures again to revelation 5. Revelation 5 is the same opening scripture from last time but we have an announcement this morning and one of Paul and sister Kimberly have asked me to announce that they have a baby that will be due in late May or early June Lord Willie so we praise the Lord for that I believe what happened is they recognized that we might be getting a larger building and decided to start filling it so we thank the Lord for that amen people that are committed to the church body amen but we certainly want to pray for sister Kimberly in particular that God would just bless her amend Body Soul and Spirit take her through this pregnancy and bring it all the way to a healthy baby amen as the Lord would bless them amen God bless you it's good to be here in service again this morning we're going to pick right up where we left off in the last service and Revelation 5 verse 1 says and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud noise who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there upon and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song amen do we sing a new song this morning don't we amen they were under the law of sin and death but all of a sudden something happened and now they sang a new song and they said Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and Nate people and nation and has made us unto God our God Kings and Priests Our God Amen this is a personal God and it's not just a God but our God and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen God bless you can have your seats this morning and as I mentioned we're going to keep continuing with our series on Redemption and this morning I want to take a title of a near Kinsman I mean I know many things here should be familiar for us but we're building a platform we're building a foundation so we can go a little higher and a little deeper as we go through these things and last service we spent a great deal of time the entire service nearly pointing out the fact that on our phone uh on on our own certainly on our phone um we are not worthy amen you'll never find your phone makes you worthy amen but on our own in our flesh in our fallen condition we could never be worthy even if we lived a perfect life we said we could not be worthy if you remember and we talked about it because our very birth is condemned our very birth is sinful and because of that even if you lived a perfect life you were not an acceptable sacrifice for us amen we couldn't meet the standard of Holiness or righteousness that God had that God requires by his word and because of that that meant that we could never come fully into the presence of God be restored back to the fellowship that's required to give us dominion and eternal life as we need it amen amen so in other words we were without hope we were without hope and even today people are without hope until they realize that in and of themself they can't make it amen it's a it's a world of self-love if you notice these days and and they say love yourself and you're great the way you are and all of these things and guess what we are great the way we are if we fall into God's purpose and plan to use what we are amen but there still has to come A change in and of ourselves and our minds will never get us there our education will never get us there the the good raising of our parents will never get us there there is no hope in this Fallen flesh for us if we don't have a change in our bodies and in our minds amen we looked at what it took to to even keep God's Wrath off of us and it was death death was a requirement there had to be blood and and that was the the proof that a price has been paid was always that there was blood somewhere and he could see that blood amen and we know we read it in the last service in Romans 6 23 it says for the wages of sin is death in other words the price that has to be paid for sin is death every single time but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord then we finish with this this scripture in Romans 5 6 to give us some hope and we're getting into the hopeful part now we're getting into the good part amen we went down in the valley last time in the in the Valley of the shadow of death is where we were yesterday or away in the last service because we are in our human condition and that's where death lies but then we read this scripture to finish out and it says for when we were yet without strength in other words when we couldn't do it on our own in due time Christ died for the ungodly amen so we want to talk about our great Redeemer this morning and we know he couldn't have been exactly like us because exactly like us has failed amen we know that he had to be related and that he couldn't come by natural bloodline the way that we have amen and so when we look at that if we realize that he came a different way and by a different bloodline then you also have to realize that your bloodline is not what you think it is and your family is not what you think it is amen because if he's going to redeem you you've got to be in his family he doesn't come to your family but he brings you to him amen so you've got to recognize that there's something above and beyond this body in this family that you've been born into a church you've come into and all these different things you've got to realize there's a different bloodline there's a different father that's there there's a different Spirits that's there and that's what unites him with him that's what makes him a near Kinsman is not where you stand today but where you stand in relation to him and in that Royal bloodline amen it's a natural it's not a natural bloodline it's a spiritual bloodline and it's a it's a Royal bloodline and it's a it's a it's a bloodline of Kings and Priests as we just read in Revelations amen amen we're not all Kings and Priests here now if we look at it the sisters don't even qualify for yet but yet in his bloodline we are all Kings and Priests with him amen we know that redeemers we talked about this last time they only come to redeem those that are in the family you can't be a redeemer if you're not a member of the family amen and so what did they do they only come to redeem those that are lost those that are missing something those that are broken those that are sick those that are out of the original place of inheritance the land or the position or the place that God gave them amen so amen if you think you're good you can't be redeemed if you think you are whole you can't be redeemed If You Think You Are Holy you can't be redeemed because your recognition is that you have need of nothing it's the laodicean condition I don't need a redeemer I don't need more because I have everything I need amen so he's not coming back because you're in a state of perfection or a state of health or a state of spirituality because he had lots of that when Jesus Christ came on the earth they had lots of spirituality they had great men Good Wonderful ministers and all these different things but that wasn't what he came for he came for those that were what lost he came for those that were in prison he came for those that were bound he came for those whose Hearts have been broken that's the ones that he came for so to be redeemed you have to be in a broken lost failed condition and until you get to that place you'll never recognize your need for a redeemer amen but what we know know that before all of that you are deemed healthy you were deemed whole you were deemed worthwhile you were deemed perfect you are deemed spotless before the foundation of the world but we drop into this condition and this is what we need to be redeemed back out of amen and we talked about how the beauty of redemption is that it doesn't look at you amen Redemption doesn't look at you but it looks at the one that is redeeming it looks at the sacrifice and says is that perfect and if that's perfect then they don't care what you say they don't care what you do all they're looking at is is that sacrifice perfect and so for us we had a perfect sacrifice and it was our Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet would say this and the message it is I he says he's praying at the beginning he says we just humbly bow our heads in humiliation Lord I noticed he doesn't say humility he says in humiliation why because we are worthless there's nothing we're bringing here there's even in our greatest state in our greatest day yet we fail him so he says we come in our bow our heads in humiliation Lord and thank you to know that we were once alienated from God without hope without Christ without God and why we were yet sinners Christ died in our stead to reconcile us back to the great family of God so we could not be able Lord by human speech to ever express the Adoration of our hearts for thy goodness and mercy to us but father in our simple humble childlike way receive our Thanksgiving Lord amen I love brother Dale's prayer this morning how many times did he say Lord we thank you and we love you and we appreciate you why because we're sitting in a place of redemption having no worthiness that ever will bring us back to it amen it's all his work in the last Source we spoke of Adam and how he was the Perfect Image the perfect reflection of God in human form amen and we know he was the son of God he was a Son of God if you look in the lineage it goes back to Abram and or Adam and it says he was who was the son of God Amen but yet in that he paid up he he fell out of the will of God he fell out of the word of God and in doing that he had to pay a price and the price for unbelief for sin was death and that's all we've had ever since Adam a Son of God brought us to death amen and then God set that precedent and we spoke last time and I'm just covering it briefly because we want to build on this this morning that death was supposed to take hold of Adam and Eve as soon as they sinned because he said the day you do it that's the day you're going to die amen and we talked last time about how there's two things is death is separation from God and we'll get into why that is in a little bit and then there is to lose one's Breath of Life That's the other death and we saw that God met that requirement in Genesis 3 because he said unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of sin and clothe them so something died and God set a precedent here because something had to die to make them those clothes and what were those clothes it was a covering for their sin literally it was a literal covering for the literal area for which they had sinned amen so the the original sacrifice was a covering for the sin of the person that committed it and it was proof that a life had been paid amen because there was blood there and brother bam says he talks about them leaving the the Garden of Eden he says he hears The Slap as they're walking as that that skin of the Lamb is hitting off them in the blood running down their legs from the from the Fresh kill of that lamb just flowing down them and Eve saying will we ever get back will we ever get back well was it they're sitting there and they knew that something had died for them I can't imagine the weight of of guilt and shame that was on them as they walked out of the presence of God not knowing if they could ever get back and knowing that something had died knowing that something had died for them and that's the only reason they could walk out with their life spared that morning or that afternoon amen why because the only response God has for sin is Wrath it's the only thing it's the only thing remember we said in the last time that that the very penalty up front he says the day you eat the rest of the day you die that's God's Wrath that's the only thing that he can express to sin is wrath and in Romans 1 it says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in righteousness so God's Wrath has to be expressed and he made a way and the way that he made it was he said something innocent and perfect can take my wrath and as long as something can absorb that wrath then I'll pass over and I'll move Beyond it and we'll continue on there and in Leviticus 17 11 it says for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul now that word atonement means a covering we saw it in the Garden of Eden they had a covering over their bodies to hide their nakedness so atonement was a covering it was a coating and it was a pacifier and what was it it was pacifying the wrath of God it was absorbing that punishment so that God would say all right I've done what I said I was going to do now I can move on and they can move on as well and they don't have to die but the thing is this Blood this atonement was never perfect it was not completely affected because they had to do it how often every year didn't they and then in some cases they had to do it after certain sins they had to come and do it regularly so this was something they had to keep doing and doing and doing year after year for themselves for their family for their households all these different things it was there so that it could what keep absorbing the wrath of God year after year after year but it never took away the sins it only covered it and you see that in type in the in the Garden of Eden it didn't take away their sin it just covered what had caused them the problem in the first place now we remember that God told Moses in the Passover he said the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so the blood was a token it was a proof that the price had been paid that a death had been caused and when God saw it he moved on he passed over right he overlooked what was inside the house because on the outside of the house was blood that proved that the price had been paid so he didn't go in he could not go in and see the sin that was inside the house because there was a covering on the outside that said the price has been paid you have to move on and so he made a way for them to do that amen now in Hebrews 9 22 Paul speaking of this says and almost all things are by the law purged purified so by almost all things by are by the law purified with blood he says and without shedding of blood is no remission so I want to say something here because the blood is the price that's required to pay our debt but they paid that price over and over with the land but why was it not sufficient to actually take away the sin why can't it only cover it temporarily the prophet of God answers it for us and he says because the life that was in that blood could not come back on the worshiper because your life is Tainted what is inside of us is Tainted and the idea was that the innocent life of what was killed would come back on you so that you could be restored back to innocence you could be restored back to Purity but the life of a lamb won't mix with the life of a human right so he said the worshiper would come in and he would sacrifice but the life of that lamb couldn't come on him because it's not compatible with human life and so he would go out and he would have the same thoughts he would have the same desires he could still hate he could still do wrong nothing was changed about the worshiper he came in and went out the same person he says that's why it could not be a sexual time in and time out it had to come every year because the worshiper was never changed the sacrificer was never changed so what if he isn't changed then he's got it he's going to keep sinning he's going to keep cutting he's got to keep it covered and that's why he keeps coming back year after year after year now to understand exactly why that won't work we've got to look at what it means to redeem and we covered this in a previous service but we'll go into some depth here and let Leviticus 25. and this is Moses speaking of their land amen we'll see you when it comes to Redemption you have two types of redemption you have Redemption of the land but you also have Redemption of the bloodline and that's really what we want to get into is because the land is is positioned in the land is possession but you also want life and we'll see that Redemption is all about restoring life that's its purpose is to restore life to keep the bloodline going that was the main condition or the main idea for it but we're talking about land this morning and said the land shall be not sold forever for the land is mine this is God speaking for you are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land If thy brother be wax and poor and has sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then he shall redeem that which his brother Soul so we've got three requirements here for the Redeemer so he had to be a Kinsman that means he had to be a relative or a bloodline member of the family amen a stranger couldn't do it and he had no right to do it if a stranger came up and went to the man that owned that land and said I want to redeem it for Jonathan he'd say are you a relative of Jonathan if he said no then he'd say sorry you can't have it he didn't have an obligation to give it back to anyone unless they were a Kinsmen Redeemer they had to be a relative and you had to prove that you were a relative you had to have the marriage certificates you had to have the genealogy there to show how you were tied to that person that you had a right to take back what they had lost otherwise they didn't have to give it back right they knew the name that was on the title deed and if you couldn't show a relationship to the name that was on the title D you couldn't get it back for them the second thing was that the Kinsmen had to be willing to redeem he couldn't be forced to do it so I couldn't go to my brother Nathan and say Nate I've fallen in hard times buy my land back for me I couldn't force him to do it he had to be willing to do it I couldn't you know say I'm going to tell Mom I'm going to tell Dad if you don't I'm going to spread it all around that you're refusing to do it you got millions of dollars in the bank and you won't pay 300 Grand to get my land back for me I couldn't force him to do it he had to be willing to do it amen and we talked about in previous verses how it had to be a special person to redeem land because we know what land costs it's not cheap and especially if it has a land on it or a house on it it's got farm and improvements and everything these days would be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars and you stop and think about would I pay hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to redeem my brother's land back would brother Joe go and redeem Paul's land back for him or vice versa most of us would say not not on my life not going to happen I can barely afford what I've got and now you want me to come and redeem yours amen but I want you to understand something because when Redemption happened it was because the Redeemer had stayed with the word of God and God had so blessed him in staying with the word in staying with his position that he could rely on God to continue to bless him even though he incurred greater debt or took on a bigger burden why because his Hope was in the Lord his trust was in the Lord he had stayed through thick and thin he had proved that if you stayed with the word that God would bless them with health and with good crops and animals and all these different things so he didn't worry if that brother lost it yet again because what his Redeemer was faithful and true he was staying with the promise and so he knew God was going to make it back up to him if he needed it again he had a trust that was there and that's why he wasn't worried to go in and maybe spend all of his money to redeem his brother back he knew that there was more were coming where he got it from amen and then the last thing is that the Kinsmen had to be able to redeem it so he had to be a Kinsman he had to be willing but he had to be able because it does me no good if you say brother I'd like to redeem your land for you and you say how much money do you have and you say 12.32 cents that's not going to redeem my land your willingness does not make it make you a redeemer amen you've got to be able to do it and they didn't do payment plans back then they didn't have credit cards back then you had to come in with the full sum on that one day or else they couldn't redeem it you had to have the full price for the debt that was owed otherwise no Redemption would happen that day amen so we're talking about a situation where we've lost our position with God and the price that is required therefore is a perfect innocent willing human life that's what's got to be paid because it has to be death it has to be a near Kinsmen and they have to be willing to do it and it has to have the it has to have the full price it has to be Perfection it has to be innocent amen so you think about that I can't redeem you and you can't Redeem Me because as much as I might be blood related and I might be willing yet I'm not able because I lack perfection in and of myself so I can't do it I can't redeem you I can't redeem my family I can't redeem my wife I can't redeem my kids it's impossible all I can do is point them to the same one that's doing the redeeming work for me amen there is a great Redeemer over all of us and that's the one we point to when I'm standing up here I'm not redeeming anybody I'm just pointing you to the Redeemer and it's the same thing we do as husbands and as fathers and these different things amen it has to be somebody that is perfect and so we don't do it we can't do it and we know who did it and it was God himself and he pointed to it through the through the Old Testament he says it about a hundred times I just picked a few here he said in Isaiah 47 as for Our Redeemer the Lord of hosts is his name the Holy One of Israel in Isaiah 62 he says and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken that's Mount Zion and Jerusalem then we look at the prophecy for the Messiah who is the Redeemer and says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace now you're going to get very confused if you don't understand godhead with that scripture a child is born a son is given he's the Mighty God and he's the Everlasting father how do you have a child a son and an everlasting father all in the same person it doesn't fit three don't go into one the way that you think they want them to do it amen he says of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this it's his Zeal it's his commitment it's his Covenant that's going to do it your Zeal is not what makes you redeemed it's his Zeal to do it remember in the Book of Ruth then then Naomi says listen he won't rest till he's done what he said he was going to do it's the Zeal of Boaz that gets the Redemption done not the Zeal of the Bride my man the prophet of God will put it this way this is 1949 this is about as early as you get in his ministry that's recorded it says and then the only way that God could ever redeem him would be to come down and redeem him himself not in another not send somebody else he couldn't send an angel that wouldn't be right why because an angel is not in line with the humanity he says but the only way God could redeem the man was come down himself to redeem it God in flesh that's the way it had to happen amen we spoke of Adam and him being a Son of God and there was potential for us to live eternally all the way from the Garden of Eden the potential was there but the potential was also there to what go the way of knowledge of a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and so we know he fell and so we needed a redeemer we needed a restart we talked about we needed another kick at the can to see if we could get back to eternal life amen and so we needed a second Adam we needed a second Adam because Adam was the Perfection we needed another Perfection to come and kick start this all over again and we go on Corinthians and Paul's talking about this and he says and so it is written the first Adam was made a living soul and the last atom was made a quickening spirit now I want you to catch something because a living soul is one man it can only affect one man there's only one Soul when you say a living Soul there's living Souls all throughout this building they're individuals so the first Adam was an individual living soul but Paul says the last Adam was made a quickening spirit now we know Spirit can be divided we know that it can be because we have the Holy Spirit so he says the last item was made of quickening spirit how be it that which was not first which is spiritual but that was his natural so he says the first living Soul was natural it was Adam he says and afterward that which is spiritual he says the second Adam is a spiritual atom the first one was natural the second one is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy and the second man is the Lord From Heaven so you've got to quickening Spirit he says it is the Lord From Heaven so when Christ came Paul Paul looking backwards in the scripture calls him the last Adam he calls him a quickening spirit so his purpose is to do what Quicken that means to give life which means that something must be dead if it's a quickening spirit you don't need a quickening spirit to something that's been quickened to something that's alive but rather this is a quickening spirit to give life to something that's dead and what is it it's a bride that's fallen and she's in the law of sin and death right he's got to make her live one Adam Falls and we die as a result and then the second Adam comes and we live as a result amen he's undoing the work of the first Adam the first Adam put us in a death condition under the law of sin and death and then the second Adam puts us in a life condition under the law of Grace of the law of God which is Grace and a merit of favor amen Adam the first Adam brings death in a following condition the second Adam's a quickening spirit and he gives us a living condition and then he takes the dead he makes them live he takes the broken and he heals him he takes the the worthless and he makes them worthy amen these are the things that he's doing he's bringing us to a place back to where we were supposed to be in the Garden of Eden I want to see you to see something this morning we've covered this before but again just to touch on it briefly so much ties into this I struggle to preach it because you want to go off in all these different directions and I'm trying to stay tight to my notes this morning because it makes more sense if I if I keep it tight this way but Adam in his original form we remember was a spirit he was a spirit man and then after that he what he was he couldn't contact Humanity or he couldn't contact nature they couldn't contact him and so God put him into a human form so that they could see feel here touch smell him all these different things he put him into a form so he could interact with his Creation in the senses that they had right so God makes him a body and then we see Christ coming by prophecy and he's a quickening spirit the first Adam was natural when it comes to humanity and the second Adam is a spiritual body and he's from heaven so it's a spiritual body that we're working with here now we taught before that Christ took the same path as Adam he's in spirit form and then he drops down into a body amen spare first body second he has to if he's a second Adam he's got to follow the same path and so we see in Hebrews 10 he says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice an offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me it's the same thing he did for Adam Adam had a body prepared for his Spirit to step into in the Amplified it says hence when Christ entered into the world he said sacrifices and offerings you have not desired speaking to God he says but instead you have made a body ready a body for me to offer right so he's made a body for him to step into to be offered as a sacrifice amen and so Paul said is speaking Jesus words there and he's saying God you didn't want the sacrifices of bulls and uh and lambs and goats and all these things but you made a body to step for me to step into and that is the body you want me to offer back to you to pay the price that will be the ultimate settlement for the sin of the people amen so it's no different than Adam's creation story a spirit put into a body but if we look then at the birth of Jesus we something that's quite that's quite different and this is where we want to spend some time this morning so in Luke 1 it says the angel came into her Mary and said hail now that our highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his sane and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with god listen under the law of sin and death when God talked to you it was rarely a good thing but the first thing he says here is as soon as she's troubled he says no no no don't worry fear not this is good news this is a good message he says and behold thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David so this is a fulfillment of Isaiah 9 where we're ready to be the the the the counselor the Mighty God Prince of Peace Everlasting father this is the person that's going to do it he says and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end the Mary said unto the angel practical how shall this be seen I know not a man she says I've never been intimate with the man so how is this one going to happen and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God Amen so remember he says a body has thou prepared me and what you have to realize what's happening here because Jesus is being born the way we were meant to be born you've got to catch this amen look at how the body is created the Holy Ghost shall come upon the woman overshadow her and it produces a holy thing the prophet of God said it this way he says there's only one person could be the word and that was Jesus he was God's Spoken Word by a virgin birth I'm a perversion see I'm the result of a union between my father and mother this has to die that's me see the body that has to die it wasn't so with Jesus he was the word he was born virgin amen he said brother there's no woman man or nothing else had nothing to do with him the woman was the incubator that's right and he nursed her breasts and so forth that might have been true about that but let me tell you he was God that's who he was wasn't no sex about it at all he had to be free from sex to bring forth life through that blood notice he says to bring forth life through that blood because the life of that blood is going to have to come on the people after he sacrifices so it cannot be tainted by Humanity's Fallen condition but to bring forth life through that blood as we'll get to in a few minutes and then we look he was the word so the prophet of God has said and I've I've mentioned this over the pope but not read the quote and I'll read it in a moment where the prophet of God said in Eden children would have been born by the spoken word and guess what that'll choke a denominational believer because they'll say where do you get that from you get it right here in Luke you see how birth was supposed to happen amen this is a sinful way that we have it happen today but there was a different way but the prophet of God says it just so you have the quote he's speaking of Eve he says now you see the seed that she was holding so Eve had an egg inside of her he says and it was ready to be made alive but it needed seed from a man right so the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of God through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait because what she was trying to fulfill the Commandment be fruitful and multiply so she has the means within her but she doesn't know how to make it happen and she listened to the serpent who said I've got a way for this to happen rather than what waiting on God I want you to catch something here and we're going to touch on three different things two today and one in a later service because brother Branham would talk about the seven seal book that titled deed to Redemption that we hope that in the the scripture we read there in Revelations 5. and he said the book that is written within is then completed when this Angel ceases he says now please understand this when the seventh Angel's message is completed the godhead mystery the serpent seed mystery and all the other mysteries of these things speaking again of that book he would say it is a book a mysterious book it's the book of redemption a mysterious book you say it's simple Christ came he redeems us back what's so what's so difficult about this no he says this book is a mysterious book this is a mysterious book I was reading there just this morning where brother Brown says he was talking about the Holy Spirit he says and God just gave them a little bit in Luther's day and then a little bit more on Wesley's day and then he says he comes in here and he gives us more because there's more to be fulfilled there's more to be revealed in there and so he gives the spirit in accordance with what's to be revealed and there's a Redemption that's happening here that hasn't happened in any of these so he's got to give more here because it's a Redemption that takes us all the way off the planet we've talked about this before amen so there's a mystery there because it's never happened before he says we'll get into that in a little while and we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed at through these six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probe that he says all through here they probed at this listen Paul had it because this man only preached what Paul preached right he only preached the same message and as somebody pointed I think it was Ellie said to the other day in his prayer he said that he got the same results that this guy did right so there's nothing here that wasn't known in and of itself in terms of understanding but there's a revelation by experience that we're going to have that nobody else had before we'll get into this I'm getting ahead of myself he says he winds up all the loose things that these fellows probe that because they were in truth here at the beginning truth went down and then it built up here has been trying to figure out how this is going to work what's in that seven seal book what are those Mysteries of the Seven Seals and he says at the end he's going to wind up all the Loose Ends that means they were tied together at one point they came apart as men went into denominations and tried to make things happen their own way and then now he ties them back up together again so that they form the right picture so we can understand what this Redemption plan is all about that he says and the Mysteries comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed he says it again he says now you see I'm not just making that up it's thus saith the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book The Scriptures he says that the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages has been probed at will be wound up together he says again the Seven Seals holds the mystery of the book and until we can see what those Seven Seals has sealed in we're only presuming them things so there's something very critical behind those Seven Seals now brother Branham he's pointing forward to the opening of the seals and he would say that they've been lost since the time of the Apostles and in one place we just read he says through these Church ages another place he says these denominational years he says it's been lost and it's been Unwound and it's been messed up and he would specifically mention serpent seed and godhead and he's preached on both those things to this point but now that as God is opening it up to him he realizes how much further they're tied into the Plan of Redemption then perhaps he understood before because these are part and parcel he says to what it takes to understand what's under those Seven Seals what is it because when you read the book of Revelation when you read this entire book is a book of redemption you've got to read it in the context of redemption and so you've got to understand godhead in the context of redemption you've got to understand the sir the serpency in the context of redemption because that's what's sealed up is the Plan of Redemption so he says you've got to you know we'll talk about it but you're gonna have to read this book with understanding right because everybody probed at it but they didn't have understanding they didn't have understanding so you've got to have understanding to read what's on it remember brother Brown talked about the Capstone and he pried it off and he said look on these things and guess what they looked on it for a while and then one went here and one went there and they went off and did their own things why because they didn't understand they didn't understand it and so they say what's the point of looking at if I don't understand I'm just going to go back to my Ministry but he said stay here stay here because what there's a revelation coming that'll make plain what is written here if you'll just stay there right so we've got to read it in the context of redemption by the understanding of the Holy Spirit now to give you just an example of this in Daniel 9 it's Daniel says yea while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding Daniel's wondering what's going on what's going on what does this mean and so an angel comes to the prophet and gives him an understanding of what's hidden why so that Daniel could sit there in his closet and just say well now I know what's there no so Daniel could take it and write it down to give a timeline to the children of Israel as to what was going to happen in their future because what they were going to stay in Babylon for a while weren't they he gave them a timeline then he had a timeline to what the Messiah then he had a timeline after that to what the tribulation it's all revealed to Daniel what so that the people will understand what's going to happen it wasn't just for Daniel it was for all of us he says at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth and I've come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved amen it's the Beloved that get to understand therefore understand the matter and consider the vision and then he goes in to explain what's going on then we come to our time and John says this he says and we know that we are of God you've got to know you're of God and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true not just to know him but to be in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life not just to know him but to be in him he says that is the true God and eternal life so you've got to understand godhead there don't you you've got to understand how he fits into it and how you fit into it as well so let's bring us back to this message this morning we spoke of Jesus being born by a Virgin by the Holy Spirit by the spoken word of God right God said the angel Gabriel and he said this is going to happen and then it happened no Humanity involved no no Decisions by man no decision by women Mary couldn't have stopped it from happening if she tried she couldn't have stopped it the word went forth the spoken word went forth and as soon as it did she was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and a baby was formed in her belly there was no stopping it it was going to happen now brother Brahm said we would have been born by the same way but what happened the serpent beguiled Eve he gave her a different way to produce what God wanted her to produce amen and so Humanity fell into what a new way of producing children so if you don't understand serpent seed you won't understand why we are sinful in the first place amen if you don't understand why your natural birth is wrong you won't understand your need for a redeemer because you'll say I live a good life or maybe I lived a perfect life that ought to be good enough right and not realize that your very existence is proof of sin the fact that you are alive today and it wasn't by the spoken word of God reveals a very sinful nature because that is the original act that caused him to sin in the first place your existence is proof that your parents sinned in the in the essence of they did what they were not supposed to do in the Garden of Eden amen so what was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was what the means to produce life outside of the way that God had said it was to be done what it was it it was to be fruitful and multiply of your own accord rather than waiting on the word of God waiting on the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit God said don't do it that way and guess what they did it that way and the scripture never says that we lost access to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you ever noticed that we have no problem accessing the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but it did say we lost access to the Tree of Life so that means the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is with us today show me where it is don't literally show me where it is but guess what if you go to the world and say where's the trillion knowledge good and evil because that's supposed to still be available they can't tell you why because they don't understand serpent seed right they don't understand why we truly need a redeemer they go back to I did wrong rather than I am wrong they don't understand why it requires blood they don't understand that because your blood is Tainted and there was a Breaking of a blood in that original act amen so the question is how would God have done it we know the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil did it but how would God have produced life well we have the answer there in in Luke amen but listen let me put it this way if you wanted Apple life where would you go apple tree if you want to pair life you'll go to pear tree if you want life where do you go the Tree of Life they would have gotten it from the Tree of Life and what is the Tree of Life it's not an apple tree remember brother Brown says they ate apples and they made their eyes come open realized they were naked and passed the apples right it couldn't have been that tree it couldn't have been a natural tree the way that we think of trees prophet of God says this the Holy Spirit guarded the tree of life until the atonement was made and now the holy spirit is running the people to the Tree of Life Adam and Eve was trying to get to the Tree of Life trying to get to it now their children are trying to stay away from the Tree of Life the Holy Spirit was guarding it and now it's bringing them to it and they refuse to hear the spirit's voice because the same adversary that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away from the Tree of Life guess what the world is consumed with the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil speaking literally you notice how centralized the world is everything is centralized around centralized around that tree of life that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil everything is about sensuality these days more and more and more why because that distracts them from the Tree of Life but then he would say keeping them away from the Tree of Life and Jesus Christ he says is the tree of life so here's where God godhead comes in because if you believe in three Gods then you're going to have some real problems with this because he says we've got the Holy Spirit overshadowing but yet the Holy Spirit overshadows but the one that's born as a son the one that's born as a child the one that's born is the Mighty God and the one that's born as the Everlasting father so you've got God producing God you've got a father producing a son how is that going to work it doesn't work you've got to understand godhead and I'm not getting into godhead this morning amen but then you see where he says he's also a quickening spirit so we've got a father right from Isaiah 9 it says he's the mighty mighty God the Everlasting father then we go in to Luke and he says he's a son that's given right well he said in Isaiah 2. and then we come and Paul calls him a quickening spirit so we have Father Son and Holy Spirit in one person amen that's being born that never existed before how you fit that into three persons it doesn't work doesn't work right you've got to understand it in the idea of the manifestations of the spirits of God or the attributes of God rather than one two three or just one even like this amen it's the ability of God to take on a different form to achieve what he's planning to achieve amen amen so what if we look at what was supposed to happen then in the perfect will of God and Eden you'd have been born by the word of God and it would have been by the Tree of Life who is what Christ who is what a quickening spirit right so just as Mary had had a child by what the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit Well what had been happened is you would have been born by the way of life which would have been the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit on the woman to Quicken what was inside her and a baby would have come forth that's simple amen very simple amen you wouldn't have had any desire or sensuality because why the life that was in Adam and his wife would have been in you because why the life comes through the blood of the father so you'd have the same life that Adam had you'd have had the same life that the woman had and you would have just continued on in eternal life because why you came from eternal life you came from a quickening spirit you came from Mighty God you came from Everlasting father so that's why you would have lived forever and ever was because you would have had the same father you would have had the life of his blood inside of you if we want to put it that way amen and if you want to see a difference look at Cain because Cain had a different father look how different he was than able why because the life of the father that he had was different than the life of the father that Abel had Even Adam as a fallen man had a different spirit and nature that followed his bloodline than Cain who had the blood of the serpent in him right the prophet God puts it this way he says now look I want you to notice something and when this the only way that God himself could ever redeem this man was to come down and take his place and that was a law that was given by Moses of redemption that it had to be done through a Kinsmen Redeemer a man first who was worthy a man who was worth the price a man who would make his public testimony and redeem the Lost estate of somebody that had fallen and then God was worthy and then God was worthy he came down some 1900 years ago in the form of a baby born in a manger overshadowed by the Holy Ghost not born by sexual desire he was God God's blood was in him that's key scripture says we're saved by the blood of God the blood is always the blood of its father never its mother we know that I've taught that before here in times and you know that the baby has not one Speck of its mother's blood in it not a bit no nothing does it's always the blood of the male a hen can lay an egg but if it isn't fertilized it'll never hatch no matter how pretty the egg is how well she warms it it will always be infertile it'll lay right there and rot right there and rot that's right unless the male bird has been with a female bird and the germ of life he says comes from the male therefore when Mary knowing not a man she was with the male God the almighty Jehovah and he overshadowed her and God is the creator that created a blood cell in the womb of Mary knowing no man at all that's why brother Branham said you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation Mary didn't feel a thing but she had life within her one moment she didn't one moment she did Why overshadowed by the Holy Spirit a quickening spirit you can have life inside of you and not realize exactly what's happening amen now you'll notice eventually because Mary started showing signs of Life didn't she but that moment she didn't have a clue whether anything had actually happened it took a while for it to show he says and that brought forth the very creative blood of God to redeem us from our life coming in here being born of sexual desire and then that blood was drawn out of Emmanuel's veins on calvary's cross and today has the same saving redeeming holy power that it did the day the transfusion was made out at Calvary you believe it he says amen now that's right we're Redeemed by the blood of God and the Bible says we are bought by the blood and Redeemed by Blood God's own blood so Christ was born by what the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit and what was it it was a sign of the new birth required by us he was being born the way that we needed to be born because we need to be born by what the spirit the quickening Spirit by the word of God and Paul talks about this being born again what not a flesh but by the What Spirit by the word he was showing us that we had to have a new birth in the form that he was birthed in you couldn't stay in your Fallen flesh that way amen as I said before our own first birth condemns us it's the literal act that the serpent and Eve committed in Genesis 3 and then Adam and Eve did right afterwards our literal existence is proof that that there has been sin amen so we can't get away from that amen we have to be born again by the word of God by the holy spirit so the thing is if you have to be it's not enough to say the Holy Spirit overshadowed you have to be a part of the word of God that's what is in the book of redemption is what who is in the word of God the names that are there that can't be removed amen you got a book of life but then you have the Lamb's Book of Life which is the sealed book of redemption and that's the ones who were sealed and redeemed before the foundation of the world whose names are written and so their names are a part of the word their identities and their attributes are part of the word and so that is the thing that what sends forth a quickening spirit to bring forth the word that was spoken before you ever came into existence before you ever knew anything before there was ever time it was back in eternity before there was ever a speck of anything your name was written in that Lamb's Book of Life and so that word comes forth as the seals are ripped off and your name is called forth the quickening spirit is going out to do what bring to life that which is said in there and to bring you back to the what the title deed of your Redemption that shows you what you have access to because of who he made you from the beginning amen that's what's happening under those Seven Seals it's not a new doctrine listen prophet of God said this clearly he says he can't you can't add one word or take one from his word and he can't do it either so he can't give us a new doctrine to take us out that would be unfair once the word is given that's it it's sealed and he doesn't do one bit more and he doesn't take away one bit from it it's already there so under the Seven Seals is not Doctrine but what is it it's a revelation by experience of the Redemption plan of God including what going into that little room where it's just you and him right it's an experience Revelation not just a doctrinal revelation you need to understand what's going on we teach because it's it's it's good for us amen but teaching is not what's going to get you in there it's going to be the experience of what that teaching is talking about that's going to take you off of this planet amen what is it when you get in what when you're born by that Holy Spirit what does it do it puts you in that bloodline now you're kin to him and until you are he can't do anything with you you got to be born again so the thing is you got to die out of this one and you got to be born into another one by the word by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit and that's what gives him access to say there we go that's the one I can redeem right there you always were that's the beauty of it you always work you always were a part of it it's not that you hit you go out and in and out and in these things but when you realize that that lets you know that hey when that Redemption call goes up when he walks into the pawn shop you say hey that's me that's me yeah you're talking about meal yes I want to go with you and you submit yourself now into that Redemption purpose and plan so he can do something in your life probably God would say this again he says and so there he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be opened the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessing hearing those Mysteries then he says marriage divorce serpent seat all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by God himself that's open those seven Mysteries now I want you to pay attention to this because he summarizes what those seven Mysteries are he says of what the church was not here not here way back before the world began of what the church was how it was in Christ where Ephesian Church age no no no no he says in the beginning and how it will be revealed in the last day what the church the church that's the mystery that's under there is what Christ and abroad United and the revealing It's the final mystery of God being revealed is him in us and what's that going to look like amen because you say what in the world does that have to do with us what does marriage and divorce have to do with the calling out of a bride we'll get into it later what does God have to do why does it matter because you got to realize that you are part of it before it ever began as as time as we know it in these different things amen and the other thing is this is because if you don't understand those you don't understand how we got out of our place and if you don't understand how we got out then you don't know how we get back in right because if you don't understand why you're in a fallen condition you don't understand why you need a new birth if you don't understand that your birth has to be by a quickening power rather than by your dad's power then you won't understand why you need to have a new birth if you don't understand why you need a redeemer if you don't understand what you used to have then you don't understand why you need a redeeming person because you don't realize you had anything else all of these things are tied in marriage and divorce is going to be a huge one we'll spend a whole service on it not on marriage and divorce itself but how it relates to Redemption because it's all about life it's all about bringing us back to these things amen we need Rapture and faith we need wrap stream Faith this is where it's all leading to his rapturing faith but how do you get Faith it's by hearing amen and how does that hearing come that word hearing means what understanding and understanding comes by the word of God by the word of God every single time we're talking about what seeing things as God meant us to see them and accepting it and believing it so that he can do what what the word said it's all he's waiting for is for us to accept it and believe it and then he'll do it he'd say this Faith cometh by what hearing now not just listen with your ear but if you hear that means you understand it and you accept it he says I hear you I believe it see it's hearing but Stephen said you stiff-necked uncircumcised in the heart and ears see uncircumcised they could hear it with the ears but uncircumcised they couldn't believe it see and then Paul would talk about he says the holy spirit in your life does what a circumcision of the heart what does that do it takes away the things that block your hearing that block your eyes that block your ears and allows you to hear what the spirit of God is saying to the churches and accept it and believe it and step into it I heard brother Brown say something this morning he said the gospel is to manifest the word of God that's what he's bringing us into the full manifestation of the word of God for our day amen this is what we're talking about in this series it's so much deeper it's so much deeper and like I said it's been three years of dwelling on some of these things it's so much deeper than we ever imagined because one thing ties into another ties into another ties into another and you can't get away everything's tied up remember he talks about the prophet of God tying those loose ends together and what you see is that everything touches everything it's a twisted chord it's a it's a wound chord and everything's touching everything and you can't touch anything without pointing it back to Redemption somehow it seems amen what is it it's a seven seal plan what is it showing us the Redemption of God and how he's going to do it amen but it's funny because inside there is a mystery of how and we don't know how exactly it's going to work but we experience the how on a daily basis because we see what he's doing in our life and we don't always understand how but we know it's being done and the only question we don't know and nobody knows is when is when because we know that even when we see the Saints arise it's a 30 to 40 day period and so we don't know if it's going to be 30 31 32 halfway through the 33rd we don't know we don't know when that's up to him and Jesus said only the father knows that it's it's only one one one one thing knows it and so that's the only thing that he's held back is when is he going to do it but the prophet of God said there's only one thing left that I see he says and that's the going away of the church amen so we're in Redemption season because that's the final part of redemption is when he takes us away to be with him amen let's stand together if we would amen more of a Bible study I know this morning but again sending a foundation we don't want to preach out of a message book we want to take it back to the scriptures and then take what the prophet said and point us to where the scripture lines up with that it's amazing the things he says and boy if you pray about it and wait on it long enough and you see where he got it from it's absolutely it's astonishing the things that he pulled out of scripture and the only way it could happen was that he was a prophet amen that God would show him those things because it sometimes it hangs on literally one or two lines in obscure places and you see where he pulls these things from since is absolutely amazing but remember how he said he says after those Seven Seals he says the Bible became a brand new book because he saw now so often what we're stuck in is the Here and Now and what what happened when he opened those Seven Seals was he saw from beginning to end and he saw the great big plan of God he saw the purpose of God and then he saw how we tied into it he saw how our Redemption was going to happen and I think that's what changed his life was that he saw that God was doing something in a way that he'd never seen it before that's what we have to do this message is about taking us off this Earth amen about redeeming us back to that place and that's what we want to dwell on in these things and some of it's going to be mysterious in the sense that it's a mystery it's something that was hidden and being revealed and then like I said there's an experience that goes along with it because you're going to know if you're pregnant by the word of God Amen like I said Mary knew after a while she didn't know initially perhaps but maybe the next morning she woke up and she was going why am I throwing up oh oh morning sickness morning sickness then a month or two later you know maybe she's getting a little pooch in front she says okay this is happening and then pretty soon what happened what nine months later out come a baby and that was what the word manifested amen amen lots of little bumps and things along the road and difficulties but in the end the word of God wasn't going to be stopped and it's the exact same thing for you and I because there's going to be bumps on the road there's going to be struggles there's going to be trials there's going to be persecutions there's going to be people saying things about us amen but in the end what matters is what he said about us and whether we'll submit and let him do what he wants to do in our lives amen I mean let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord when we see the care you have for us Lord when we see the Precision you have Lord how clearly and yet how simply you declare these things in your word Heavenly Father Lord it gives us Lord Assurance it gives us Comfort Lord that like Boaz you're not going to stop until you fulfill Lord you won't rest Lord that it's your Zeal that's going to make this Redemption plan happen and Lord all we want to do Lord is to rest in what you've said Lord that we not go out there and try and make it happen Lord but that we'd rest in the gifts Lord you've given gifts you've given food in due season Lord you provided us to wait on you and Lord may we not just be useless Lord but may we be ready to go at your word or that when you call we would be ready to go back into our inheritance Lord this is the time lord we're not waiting anymore Lord not that we're presuming to move out Lord but this is the fullness of redemption happening even in this day Lord so we know the land is ours Lord we know that what's written on the title deed of Our Lives Lord has been given to us to possess Lord and what you're asking us to do is step out by Faith Lord under the unction of the Holy Spirit to walk around this landlord and that our footsteps would be possession so Lord Lift us up into a higher realm of Faith Lord we don't want to get into mysteries for the sake of mysteries Lord but Lord may you just make it so simple and clear to us how you've planned this out Lord that we would know and believe and accept and understand it Lord and say just like Mary be it unto me according to your word Lord would you just grant us that Grace this afternoon and throughout the week or just be with us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen let's sing that song greater than all my sin 1189 is the blood that still greater [Applause] is the Great the
