[21:04] [Music]
[21:16] Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[21:19] may that be
[21:22] our heart's cry as we worship you,
[21:23] Father. How great you are in our lives,
[21:26] Father.
[21:28] So many things you've done for us, Lord,
[21:29] that we can never fully thank you for
[21:32] everything, Lord. Lord, as we worship
[21:35] your name, Father, may it just be
[21:38] holiness unto you, Father. I pray Lord
[21:40] that you just accept our worship,
[21:42] Father. And may you just cause you to
[21:44] draw near to us this day, Father. Lord,
[21:47] with the pressures of the world just
[21:50] pushing in on us, Lord, I pray that you
[21:52] just help us to roll our cares and
[21:54] everything that is distracting us onto
[21:56] you, Lord. And and Father, may we just
[21:58] turn our eyes completely on you and set
[22:02] aside this time, Lord, just to focus on
[22:05] you, Lord, and to hear what you would
[22:06] have to say to us, Lord. Lord, as we
[22:10] enter this service, Father, pray that
[22:11] you just forgive us of anything that
[22:13] we've done wrong or thought or said,
[22:15] Lord, may you just forgive us, Lord.
[22:19] Help us, Lord,
[22:21] as we hold each other up in prayer,
[22:23] Father. There's many needs here that
[22:25] weren't listed, Father. Things that
[22:27] we've kept hidden in our hearts, Lord,
[22:29] but may we just lift it up to you,
[22:30] Father.
[22:33] grace, Lord, to those that couldn't make
[22:35] it, Father, for whatever reason, whether
[22:36] it's sickness, Father, or obligations,
[22:38] Lord.
[22:40] May you just give them a double portion
[22:42] this night, Father, and raise them up,
[22:44] Father, and restore them to us. Grace
[22:46] those, Lord, that'd be traveling, Lord,
[22:48] and with the different needs, Father,
[22:50] put her to Lord, Lord.
[22:53] So many requests, Father. So many
[22:55] oppressions from the devil, Lord, but
[22:57] we're just holding on to you.
[23:00] Grace, Father, as we we sing and praise
[23:02] your name, Father. Grace, especially to
[23:05] the pastor as he comes, Lord. May you
[23:06] just help us step aside and may you flow
[23:08] freely, Lord.
[23:10] Lord, we're looking for a mighty
[23:11] infilling from you this night, Father.
[23:14] There isn't a single one of us that
[23:15] don't need a special touch from you,
[23:17] Lord. A word that speaks to us this in
[23:20] this moment, Father.
[23:23] Grace to us, Lord, is my prayer. May you
[23:25] just bless your service, Lord. Jesus
[23:28] Christ's name I pray. Amen.

[40:13] Lord, we can't thank you enough. Lord,
[40:16] the scripture says if we started
[40:18] praising you from the rising of the sun
[40:19] to the going down of the same, Lord, it
[40:22] wouldn't be enough. But Lord, we want to
[40:24] say thank you once again, Lord. Lord, we
[40:27] want to say thank you with our mouth. We
[40:29] want to say thank you with our lives,
[40:31] Lord. We want to say thankful. Thank you
[40:33] with all the energy we have and where we
[40:35] place it, Lord. We want everything we
[40:37] are, Lord, to be a thankful offering to
[40:40] you this night, heavenly father. Lord,
[40:42] asking you to just take your word once
[40:44] again, Lord. Show us your place. Show us
[40:46] our place. Show us your promise, Lord.
[40:49] Lord, and give us faith, Lord, to raise
[40:50] up and lay hold of it, Lord. To trust
[40:52] you, Lord, a little bit more tonight. We
[40:54] pray, Lord. Draw us one step closer to
[40:57] glory, one step closer to a body change,
[40:59] Lord. One step closer to a total
[41:01] surrender. We pray tonight. Lord, bless
[41:04] us each one. Be with those not here,
[41:05] Lord. Those that are sick, Lord, we pray
[41:07] a special grace to them as well. In
[41:09] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. And
[41:12] amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[41:14] would to Colossians chapter 1.
[41:16] Colossians 1. Good to see brother Paul
[41:18] back with us and also have the extra
[41:20] Phil and the and the musicians and the
[41:22] music there. Amen. Wonderful to see him.
[41:25] Remember we've got brother Carmen Mills
[41:27] coming this weekend. Amen. Just trusting
[41:29] the Lord will bless those services.
[41:31] Brother Joe and I are traveling away to
[41:32] the men's meetings. Amen. And we're just
[41:35] trusting the Lord to bless you here and
[41:37] bless us while we're there as well.
[41:39] Certainly enjoy the song service
[41:40] tonight. Amen. Appreciate you, brother
[41:42] Joe, for that. Good to see brother
[41:44] Gerald and Sister Betty back with us.
[41:46] Amen. God bless you. We got a strong
[41:47] left side tonight. It's usually the
[41:49] right side seems to be strong. Now we've
[41:50] got everybody on the left. So, bringing
[41:53] some balance back in the the church
[41:55] seating, it looks like. Amen. God bless
[41:57] you. Good to see each one here tonight.
[41:58] Colossians chapter 1, Paul says this.
[42:01] It's a bit of a choppy start, but I
[42:03] didn't want to read the whole thing.
[42:04] We'll get into it a little later, but he
[42:05] says, "Whereof I am made a minister
[42:08] according to the dispensation of God,
[42:10] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[42:12] the word of God."
[42:15] That's why he's preaching, church. He's
[42:17] made a minister to a people to fulfill
[42:19] the word of God. Even the mystery which
[42:21] had been hid from ages and from
[42:23] generations, but now is made manifest to
[42:26] his saints, to whom God would make known
[42:28] what is the riches of the glory of this
[42:31] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[42:33] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen.
[42:36] God bless you. You can have your seats
[42:38] tonight. And as you can imagine, we're
[42:40] continuing this this thought on the
[42:42] mystery finished on our series on the
[42:44] Holy Ghost. And where we're at in this
[42:45] service and and in this series is really
[42:47] the final work, the final phase of of
[42:51] the finishing work of the Holy Spirit.
[42:53] And that's why we're preaching these
[42:54] things. And we've had glimpses of it and
[42:56] we've had, you know, little portions of
[42:58] it shown as we're going through. But
[42:59] we're in the time and the season now
[43:01] where we're seeing exactly what God's
[43:03] been trying to do all along. And it's
[43:05] the work of the Holy Spirit through the
[43:07] word of God to produce something in each
[43:09] and every one of us. And we closed on uh
[43:11] uh this quote last service and I want to
[43:13] open up with it this morning and or this
[43:15] evening. I love it because it speaks of
[43:17] the certainty of the word. Amen. And
[43:19] that's one thing that we ought to have
[43:20] by now, church, as believers of this
[43:22] message is we ought to be certain of God
[43:24] that when he says something, he's going
[43:26] to do it. Amen. And brother Brandon
[43:27] would say this to the to the to the the
[43:30] bride of this age. Amen. when the
[43:32] mystery of God will be finished, he
[43:33] says, "There will be a bride just as
[43:36] certain as I'm standing in this pulpit.
[43:39] There will be a bride that is washed in
[43:41] the blood of that lamb." Now, see,
[43:44] church, that's nothing new. You can go
[43:47] to any church today and they can preach
[43:49] that you are covered and washed in the
[43:51] blood of the lamb. I would say that's
[43:53] the generic portion.
[43:56] They may not preach a bribe, but they'll
[43:57] preach a church. And they'll say, "We're
[43:59] all washed in the blood of the lamb.
[44:00] We're all clean." But catch what he says
[44:02] next. He says, "And that lamb will be
[44:05] living among them." Amen. He'll be
[44:07] showing super signs of his resurrection
[44:10] after 2,000 years. The same thing he did
[44:13] when he was here on earth. And last last
[44:16] service, we asked the question, what's
[44:17] that mystery going to look like? Who is
[44:19] it going to be? Who is it going to that
[44:20] that's going to reveal this? How is it
[44:22] tied to the bride? And how is it wrapped
[44:24] up in our time? How does it affect us?
[44:26] What does it do for us? What does it
[44:28] look like when it's working in our
[44:30] lives? How do we get to the place that
[44:31] he's talking about in this quote and in
[44:33] the scriptures that we've read over the
[44:35] last 80 portions of this series? Amen.
[44:38] But I'm coming preaching a prophet's
[44:40] message tonight. Amen. I am not
[44:42] preaching a generic Christian experience
[44:44] anymore. Not that we have been. But I
[44:46] want you to understand something,
[44:47] church, that what we have is specific to
[44:50] us. It is specific to this age and it is
[44:53] specific to the word for this age.
[44:56] That's the message that we have today.
[44:58] Amen. What we're going to hear tonight
[44:59] and what will be to the end certainly of
[45:01] this this series that we're preaching on
[45:03] is specific to what we received from a
[45:06] prophet messenger. Nobody nobody
[45:10] anywhere is preaching what we're going
[45:13] to talk about tonight and what we'll be
[45:14] preaching as we go through this. Amen.
[45:16] Because what we're preaching about is
[45:17] our inheritance.
[45:20] Church, we have an inheritance here and
[45:22] we have an inheritance over there. We've
[45:24] got one inheritance here. You've got
[45:26] something that's far grander over there.
[45:28] Amen. But I want you to understand
[45:30] something. We have an inheritance here.
[45:31] And I love how when brother Barry was
[45:33] here, he said, "Listen, we've got a
[45:35] message that has lift." I thought that
[45:37] was such a beautiful thing to say. We've
[45:39] got something that takes us up out of
[45:41] this earth. We've got so many people
[45:43] preaching a gospel that makes us
[45:44] comfortable down here, that makes us
[45:46] want to stay here, but we've got a
[45:47] message that tugs on our hearts, that
[45:49] tugs on our lives, that tugs on our
[45:51] souls, and it's pulling us away from
[45:53] this. It's got lift. Amen. It's drawing
[45:55] us away from everything that would hold
[45:57] us back in this age. Amen. And so, we've
[46:00] been given an inheritance down here,
[46:01] church. There's only one inheritance we
[46:03] have. Because remember, if it comes from
[46:06] God, it has to be eternal.
[46:09] And there's an inheritance we have,
[46:10] church, and that inheritance is his
[46:12] word. That's what he's given us. Amen.
[46:14] If it's from God, it has to be eternal.
[46:16] And so, health and wealth and ease of
[46:18] life and comfort and all these things,
[46:20] they're temporary. Healing is only
[46:22] temporary.
[46:23] Our internal inheritance is a healed
[46:25] body, not healing. It's a body that
[46:28] can't get sick. Amen. And Peter says we
[46:30] have an inheritance incorruptible and
[46:32] undefiled waiting in heaven for us. But
[46:35] we've been given one inheritance here.
[46:36] And brother Brandham says this. He says,
[46:38] "Now we have a sacred trust. And we have
[46:40] an inheritance, a heritage that we
[46:42] inherit as believing children. It's a
[46:45] sacred trust. And that sacred trust, and
[46:48] our sacred heritage is the word of God
[46:50] that's been given to us." And then he
[46:52] says it this way, the full word of God.
[46:55] You say, "What do we have that nobody
[46:57] else has?" If you're a child of God,
[46:58] you've got the full word. And you know
[47:00] where you're at and you know what it
[47:02] means for you. And amen. So what we have
[47:04] today that is supernatural is the word
[47:07] of God. We've got the full word of God.
[47:09] That's what we have. Amen. And then what
[47:10] comes behind that word is the spirit to
[47:12] make it live in us. The spirit is the
[47:14] dynamics. It's the power to make that
[47:16] word live. It takes it from letter and
[47:18] it turns it into life. Amen. That's what
[47:21] we see here today. That's what we see in
[47:22] the lives of experienced believers and
[47:24] mature believers is it's gone from
[47:26] letter into life. And that's what the
[47:28] the power of the Holy Spirit is supposed
[47:30] to do. So, we have a prophet that comes
[47:33] in this age and he preaches those seven
[47:35] seals. And I want you to hear what he
[47:37] has to say early on as he starts to
[47:39] preach those seven seals in that first
[47:41] service. This is the confidence I have
[47:43] in this prophet because he comes,
[47:45] church, and he's okay with humbling
[47:47] himself before the people. He's okay
[47:50] with humbling himself before the spirit
[47:51] of God. He's okay with humbling himself
[47:53] to the word of God. Remember, we read in
[47:56] the book of Revelation, in Revelation 5,
[47:58] that the lamb came and he took the book.
[48:01] No man was worthy. No man was able. No
[48:05] man was found that could open the book.
[48:07] But there was a lamb found that was able
[48:10] to open the book. And so only Christ can
[48:13] take the book. And only Christ can open
[48:16] the seals. church. That means even a
[48:18] prophet is not able to open those seals.
[48:23] He can't do it. He can't do it. He's not
[48:25] able. He isn't worthy. He's not able and
[48:29] he doesn't have the understanding
[48:30] required to do those things. But like
[48:32] Daniel had, remember when Daniel's
[48:34] praying and the angel came to him and he
[48:36] says, "Daniel, I've come to give you
[48:38] skill and understanding."
[48:41] That's what our prophet got. Now listen
[48:43] to this. He's preaching the first seal
[48:44] here and he says this, "I would have
[48:47] made a horrible mistake on that about
[48:50] 12:00." He says, "If it hadn't been
[48:52] about 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit
[48:54] came in the room and corrected me on
[48:57] something that I was writing down to
[48:59] say." So, Brother Bam's studying that
[49:01] morning to preach that evening. He's
[49:03] gone. He's been told to go preach the
[49:05] seals. And so he's sitting in his hotel
[49:08] room and he's studying and he says, "I'd
[49:10] have made a big mistake if I was left to
[49:14] my own devices." He said, "I was taking
[49:17] it from an old context. I had nothing on
[49:20] it." He says, "I don't know what the
[49:23] second seal is. No more than nothing."
[49:25] He's in the church preaching the first
[49:28] seal. He says, "I've got to preach the
[49:30] sec second seal tomorrow, and I don't
[49:32] have a clue what it is."
[49:35] church. That's the confidence of a
[49:37] prophet. He knows he's got to preach it,
[49:39] but he doesn't have the answer for it
[49:40] yet. He doesn't have the understanding
[49:42] for it. He says, "But I had got some old
[49:45] context of something that I had spoke on
[49:47] several years ago, wrote it down, and I
[49:49] gathered this context from Dr. Smith and
[49:51] many great outstanding teachers that I
[49:54] had gathered it, and all of them
[49:55] believed that. So, I had written it
[49:57] down." So, Brother Brandham, church,
[49:59] brother Brandon didn't just read his
[50:00] Bible. He read all sorts of things from
[50:01] all sorts of other people. And he says,
[50:03] "I took what they had and I put it into
[50:06] context. I put it into notes. And
[50:08] everyone seemed to agree on this. So I
[50:10] wrote it down, too. It made sense to
[50:12] him. It seemed to fit. It seemed to work
[50:14] through there." Amen, church. He's doing
[50:16] everything he can to preach the seals.
[50:19] But listen to this. He says, "And I was
[50:21] fixing to say, well, now I'll study it
[50:23] from that standpoint." So he had a
[50:26] perspective on the seals that he was
[50:27] going to preach from. He says, "And
[50:29] there about 12:00 in the day, the Holy
[50:31] Spirit just swept right down into the
[50:33] room." He says, "And the whole thing
[50:35] just opened up to me and there it was."
[50:37] See this first seal being opened. He
[50:40] says, "I'm as positive as I'm standing
[50:42] here tonight that this is the gospel
[50:44] truth that I'm going to say here. I just
[50:47] know it is."
[50:49] That takes humility, church, to stand up
[50:52] and say, "I was going to preach
[50:54] incorrect word."
[50:56] But he came.
[50:58] He came and he opened the seal. Brother
[51:02] Graham didn't open the seal, church. The
[51:04] Holy Spirit told him what it meant.
[51:06] Christ came down with an open book and
[51:09] said, "Here's what those seals are."
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he'd have that seven times
[51:15] over seven days. He'd come, he'd there,
[51:18] he'd study and church, he says, "I don't
[51:21] know what the second seal is." But then
[51:22] he comes and he preaches the second
[51:24] seal. Why? The Holy Spirit comes in,
[51:25] does the same thing. And day after day
[51:28] after day, he's studying. He's praying.
[51:30] He's doing his best. And then the Holy
[51:31] Spirit comes in and it shows him exactly
[51:33] what to say and do. Church, he didn't
[51:35] preach it by inspiration. He preached it
[51:37] by divine revelation from Christ
[51:40] himself.
[51:41] That's what we're believing this
[51:42] evening. We're believing a message that
[51:44] came that way. Amen. You talk about
[51:46] divinely revealed truth. Remember I was
[51:48] talking about that that that great
[51:49] nominal Christian pastor that says that
[51:51] that there is no more divinely revealed
[51:53] truth. Church, this is divinely revealed
[51:55] truth. This message we believe is taking
[51:57] us back to that word. Amen. And God
[52:00] opened up eternity for his prophet so he
[52:03] could see exactly what was going on.
[52:05] That's why we listen to the seventh
[52:06] church angel's mo voice church because
[52:08] he stopped and he heard what the spirit
[52:11] was saying. See, too many of us, we
[52:13] presume.
[52:15] We just madly push forward. I've got
[52:18] this. I'm a prophet. I'm a believer.
[52:19] I've got the right. No, sir. He waited
[52:21] and he waited and the Holy Spirit came
[52:23] and he corrected him and he gave him
[52:25] exactly what we needed to hear. Amen.
[52:27] But I say that to say this. Brother Bram
[52:30] said after the seals were opened, his
[52:32] Bible completely changed.
[52:35] He's been preaching church for what, 30
[52:38] years? 33 to 63. 30 years. And he says,
[52:42] "My Bible completely changed after those
[52:44] seals were open." Something happened
[52:46] when those seals were open. And many
[52:48] preached some of the most wonderful
[52:49] things after those seals were open. What
[52:51] was before, church, we don't throw it
[52:53] away. Like we said, you can't come to 63
[52:55] unless you go from 33 to 63. We've got
[52:58] to grow. We've got to mature. We've got
[52:59] to have a foundation built there. But
[53:01] after the seals, he preaches some
[53:03] amazing things. Amen. But I want us, and
[53:05] we're going to preach from one of those
[53:07] great messages tonight mostly. But I
[53:09] want you to catch what he says. He says,
[53:11] 'Now, it's hard to say this. It's very
[53:12] hard because speaking to people who feel
[53:14] the same way I do and the way I've been
[53:16] for many years. He says, 'But since the
[53:19] opening of those seven seals of them
[53:21] angels just behind the mountain yonder,
[53:23] he said, "This has become a new book."
[53:27] He says, "It's the way that's been the
[53:29] things it's the things that's been hid
[53:32] are being revealed as God promised in
[53:34] Revelation 10, he would do it." See,
[53:36] he's starting to see his message. He's
[53:38] starting to see his ministry now placed
[53:39] exactly where it's supposed to be. He
[53:42] saw Malachi 4, but now he's seen
[53:44] Revelation 10 now being revealed in his
[53:47] own life. He said as he promised in
[53:49] Revelation 10, he would do it. He said,
[53:51] "And we are the privileged people that
[53:54] God has chosen of the earth that we
[53:56] might see and understand these things."
[53:59] He says it's not uh that which is not
[54:02] some mythical fleshy mind of a person
[54:05] trying to make it up. He says it's the
[54:07] word of God made manifest. Proven that
[54:10] it's right. He says proven not by
[54:12] science but by God that it's right. You
[54:15] know, I was listening to uh what I do a
[54:17] lot of times either on a Thursday
[54:19] morning or Sunday afternoon as I go
[54:20] home. I do around the world in 60
[54:22] minutes. And I go around and I check in
[54:24] with different churches and different
[54:26] ministers that I've known and these
[54:27] different things. And so I was checking
[54:29] in on my old pastor in Dallas Fort
[54:31] Worth, uh, Brother David McGiri. And he
[54:34] said something on Sunday morning that I
[54:36] so appreciated. He said the purpose of
[54:38] this word is not just for us to tell
[54:41] people.
[54:42] He said the purpose of this word is for
[54:45] us to show people. He said the purpose
[54:49] of the word is just not to be written
[54:51] and read. The purpose of the word is to
[54:54] be manifested. I thought that was so
[54:57] beautifully put. Amen. What a wonderful
[54:59] thing to say. Amen. God is looking for
[55:01] people that are the word. God is
[55:04] producing people that are the word. Not
[55:06] just people that can nod their heads and
[55:08] say amen. Not just people that can fill
[55:10] a pew Sundays and Wednesdays, but he's
[55:12] looking for people that will take it and
[55:14] eat it and they'll become what they're
[55:16] eating. They'll become what they're
[55:17] believing. Amen. God's looking for a
[55:19] transformation.
[55:21] He's looking for a transformation of his
[55:23] bride. Amen. And that's why we need the
[55:24] new birth. That's why we need his word,
[55:26] the washing of water by the word, so
[55:28] that we become what we're believing. We
[55:30] become what we're hearing. We become
[55:32] what we're dwelling on and people see
[55:34] us. Not just hear us, but they see us.
[55:38] And that's what catches their attention.
[55:40] It's not just the words that come out of
[55:41] our of our life, but it's the life that
[55:43] comes out of our life. Amen. Now, I want
[55:46] to take us back to scripture, and I want
[55:47] to go back to Colossians 1. And we're
[55:49] never going to get it all tonight, but I
[55:51] just want to take this in small portions
[55:53] for each service as we go forward so not
[55:55] to to burden the people too much, but I
[55:58] want to take us back to this first uh
[56:00] portion of Colossians. We're going to
[56:01] read more of it later, but I want to
[56:02] come here to understand something. Paul
[56:06] says, "Whereof I am made a minister
[56:08] according to the dispensation of God,
[56:10] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[56:12] the word of God." His message came with
[56:15] a purpose, and it was that the word
[56:17] would be fulfilled in the hearers and
[56:18] believers of his message. Okay, that's
[56:22] the first thing. Watch now what he says
[56:24] now. It's even the mystery which has
[56:26] been hid from ages and from generations.
[56:29] But
[56:30] when
[56:33] in the year 2000
[56:36] he says now. He says but now is made
[56:39] manifest to his saints to whom God would
[56:42] make known what is the riches of his of
[56:43] the glory of this mystery among the
[56:45] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[56:48] of glory. Now if you remember brother
[56:49] John's been preaching this is us now.
[56:52] But Paul says no it's now 2,000 years
[56:55] ago. But remember what Revelations 1077
[56:59] says. It says the mystery of God should
[57:01] be finished.
[57:04] That means it had to be started
[57:06] someplace else.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; It didn't start in our age. It gets
[57:09] finished in our age. And Paul says,
[57:11] look, it's showing itself now. This
[57:13] thing that God is hidden all through
[57:15] time. He's hidden it through his word.
[57:16] He's hidden it through his people. It's
[57:18] being h it's happening now in who? The
[57:22] church. In the saints and the believers
[57:25] of that time. Amen. We're in the time of
[57:27] the mystery being finished. We're in the
[57:29] omega. He's in the time of the alpha,
[57:33] the start, the beginning. We're at the
[57:35] finishing. We're at the ending. Do you
[57:38] see why I'm saying this? Amen. And the
[57:39] people that day, they didn't really
[57:41] catch it. And guess what? They're not
[57:42] going to catch it today either.
[57:45] Paul, brother Brandon would say this. He
[57:46] says, "Now, God had a purpose and a
[57:49] hidden mystery. And that's what I want
[57:50] to speak on to the church this morning.
[57:52] the mystery, the hidden mystery of God
[57:55] that he had in his mind before the world
[57:57] ever began and how that it's unfolded
[58:00] itself right down to this present hour
[58:03] that we're living. He sees he says,
[58:05] "See, then you will understand clearly
[58:07] then I believe what is being done."
[58:09] God's great mystery of how it's a
[58:11] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knew
[58:13] nothing about it. Even the angels didn't
[58:15] understand it. He said, "See, he didn't
[58:17] reveal it." That's the reason under our
[58:19] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[58:21] was opened there was silence. Now notice
[58:24] he says that mystery is unfolding
[58:26] itself. If you've ever taken something,
[58:29] have you seen origami? Do you know what
[58:31] origami is? Where they take paper and
[58:33] they fold it up and they make it into
[58:34] these swans that the wings move when you
[58:36] pull on different things. Very
[58:37] beautiful. I think the the Japanese or
[58:39] the Chinese did it. You ever take
[58:41] origami and what you can do is you can
[58:42] unfold it.
[58:44] You can unfold it and you can see that
[58:46] what started as a simple sheet of paper
[58:48] becomes this beautiful swan or this
[58:50] animal. You can unfold it to see what it
[58:53] started, but then you can fold it back
[58:54] and see what it is. He says this mystery
[58:57] has been unfolding. In other words,
[58:58] God's been revealing it all this time.
[59:01] It wasn't fully revealed at the
[59:03] beginning. It's only revealed at the
[59:05] very end, but it's been unfolding all
[59:07] the way through time. Amen. It was lost
[59:10] to sight. See, they saw it in that first
[59:12] age and it was coming so perfectly into
[59:14] clearness. And then what happened? The
[59:17] apostles died and the church went into
[59:19] apostasy. They fell away. They put the
[59:21] Holy Spirit out. And so that vision,
[59:23] that clarity of what God was trying to
[59:24] do, it fell with it and it went into
[59:26] darkness. But now we've had this this
[59:28] regeneration. We've had this restoration
[59:30] through the seven church ages. And now
[59:32] in the fifth and the sixth and into the
[59:34] seventh, we've had justification,
[59:35] sanctification, the gifts, and the
[59:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit and these
[59:38] things. And it's coming back now so that
[59:40] it's clearly seen. And the key is this,
[59:42] church. You've got to see it.
[59:44] If nobody sees it, you've got to see it.
[59:47] You've got to see it in yourself. I
[59:48] trust we'll see it in each other. But
[59:50] this is a mystery that we have to see
[59:52] inside of ourselves as we're going
[59:53] through this life. Brother Bam says
[59:55] this. He says, "Jesus, when he was on
[59:57] earth, they wanted to know when he would
[59:59] come." He said, "Even the son himself
[1:00:01] doesn't know when it's going to happen."
[1:00:02] See, God has this all to himself. It's a
[1:00:06] secret. And that's the reason there was
[1:00:08] silence in heaven for the space of a
[1:00:09] half hour and seven thunders utter their
[1:00:12] voices. And John was even forbidden to
[1:00:14] write it. See, he says it's the coming
[1:00:16] of the Lord. He says that's one thing he
[1:00:20] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[1:00:23] and when he will come. He says it's a
[1:00:25] good thing that he doesn't. So all of
[1:00:28] this thing, this final mystery is tied
[1:00:30] up. It's wrapped up to that final event
[1:00:32] which is the coming of the Lord. It's
[1:00:34] the resurrection. It's the rapture.
[1:00:36] Amen. And that's tied to the mystery
[1:00:38] that God had from the beginning. That's
[1:00:40] the final part, the culmination of this
[1:00:42] great mystery is this rapture. Amen. And
[1:00:44] it's all coming through that sealed
[1:00:46] book. Amen. That's that book of
[1:00:48] redemption. It's the book of life. It's
[1:00:49] the book that holds the names and the
[1:00:51] purpose and the plans that God has for
[1:00:53] everyone of his children. And it was in
[1:00:55] the mind of God from the beginning. And
[1:00:57] the question is, who are they? How do we
[1:01:00] know them? Do we know who they are
[1:01:02] tonight?
[1:01:05] We don't. We think we do, but we don't
[1:01:09] really know. We don't really know
[1:01:11] because that's going to be the final
[1:01:13] portion of the mystery is when and how
[1:01:16] and who. That's the showdown is the
[1:01:19] rapture. Amen. Church, we can look
[1:01:21] around this and listen, we better
[1:01:23] believe we're going in a rapture, but we
[1:01:25] also better make our calling and
[1:01:27] election sure day by day. Amen. We
[1:01:29] better have a secure uh settled feeling
[1:01:32] in our soul that we're right with God.
[1:01:34] Amen. But the confirmation of who really
[1:01:36] is a child of God is only going to be
[1:01:38] proven on one day and that's the day of
[1:01:39] the rapture. That's when we're going to
[1:01:41] know, church, who was real and who was
[1:01:43] fake. That's the showdown. Amen. We can
[1:01:46] look around and we can believe we're all
[1:01:47] going to make it. But let me tell you
[1:01:49] this, church, and I'm not putting you
[1:01:50] down. I've seen people that amen more,
[1:01:53] that shouted more, that dressed better,
[1:01:56] that were more focused, that were more
[1:01:58] committed to the word, and they've
[1:01:59] turned away.
[1:02:02] That's the sad truth. I know ministers
[1:02:04] that have preached this message and
[1:02:06] walked away. I know them personally, and
[1:02:09] I'm not talking about young bucks. I'm
[1:02:11] talking about men that have preached it
[1:02:12] for 30 and 40 years and walked away. Why
[1:02:16] am I saying that? I'm saying the
[1:02:17] showdown is the rapture. Today, we're
[1:02:20] just here and we're fighting and we're
[1:02:21] believing, but the rapture is going to
[1:02:23] prove who's really in and who's really
[1:02:24] out. Amen. That's where the proof is
[1:02:26] going to be. And that's why we need a
[1:02:28] bride preparing message. Amen. We need a
[1:02:31] rapture ready message. Amen. That'll get
[1:02:33] us set for that for that final moment
[1:02:35] when that mystery is revealed and we
[1:02:37] finally see who's who and what's what.
[1:02:39] Amen. That's what God came to do through
[1:02:40] a Malachi 4 prophet was to get us ready
[1:02:43] for the rapture. Now, he says this. He
[1:02:45] says he has showed or revealed it in
[1:02:48] every type that's in the Bible. We're
[1:02:49] talking now about this mystery.
[1:02:52] He says, "Therefore, the entire Bible is
[1:02:54] the revelation of God's mystery in
[1:02:56] Christ." The entire Bible is an
[1:02:59] expression of one goal that God had, one
[1:03:01] purpose that he wanted to achieve in the
[1:03:03] entire Bible. He says, "And all the acts
[1:03:06] of the believers in the Bible has been
[1:03:09] in type an expression of what God's
[1:03:12] great goal is. And now in this last day,
[1:03:14] he has revealed it and shows it. See,
[1:03:17] this mystery has been showing all along.
[1:03:19] God's been giving glimpses all along.
[1:03:21] And the prophet of God says, "Listen,
[1:03:23] you can go back and you can see it in
[1:03:25] the types and shadows of the lives of
[1:03:27] the true believers in the scripture."
[1:03:30] And I don't want to get too far ahead of
[1:03:31] myself, but he'll say, "Look at Moses,
[1:03:34] and what do you see? Christ. Look at
[1:03:36] Joseph and what do you see? Christ. Look
[1:03:39] at David and what do you see? Christ.
[1:03:43] Look at Samuel. What do you see? Look at
[1:03:44] all these great men and what do you see?
[1:03:46] You see Christ, but you only see it in
[1:03:47] type. It's not perfect, but you see a
[1:03:51] glimpse. You just catch catch a moment,
[1:03:54] a fleeting window of what God has been
[1:03:56] trying to do all this time. And he says,
[1:03:58] if you look at their lives, you'll see
[1:03:59] that. And in the Old Testament, so much
[1:04:01] of time it was limited to men. It was
[1:04:03] limited to prophets. It was limited to
[1:04:04] kings. It was limited to priests. And
[1:04:06] you had the occasional woman in there
[1:04:08] that show great faith in these things.
[1:04:10] But it was a more select group of
[1:04:11] people. But he says it's just a type.
[1:04:13] It's not perfect. But there's a people
[1:04:15] coming where it'll be through all of
[1:04:16] them. It's not just going to be through
[1:04:18] the ministry. It's not just going to be
[1:04:19] through the prophets. It's not going to
[1:04:20] just be through those that handle the
[1:04:22] word behind a pulpit. But it'll be
[1:04:24] through a people that have surrendered
[1:04:27] themselves to the word that they've
[1:04:28] received. Amen. He says, "And then comes
[1:04:31] the revelation of the mystery to reveal
[1:04:33] what it's all been about. Then come back
[1:04:36] in the last days and pick up all these
[1:04:38] mysteries and clearly explain it and
[1:04:40] reveal it. Notice he says two things,
[1:04:42] explain and reveal. Explain is to give
[1:04:45] understanding. Reveal is to manifest.
[1:04:48] Okay? We're not receiving an
[1:04:50] intellectual message. We're receiving a
[1:04:52] transforming message. That's what it's
[1:04:54] supposed to do. He says, why? It's all
[1:04:57] the last days when this great mystery
[1:04:59] that God had in his heart is being
[1:05:02] revealed. He says, do you get it?
[1:05:03] Remember this is the truth of thus
[1:05:06] sayeth the Lord. It's the truth. It's
[1:05:08] the scripture. Notice what he says here.
[1:05:10] He says the this great mystery that God
[1:05:13] had in his heart. Church, it's personal
[1:05:15] to God. It's a part of God. It's not
[1:05:17] just an intellectual concept. It's not
[1:05:19] just an academic exercise for God. But
[1:05:22] this is something near and dear to his
[1:05:24] person. Amen. It's very personal to him.
[1:05:26] It's a part of God himself. He says it's
[1:05:29] like the second the seven mysteries of
[1:05:31] the seven last seals. The seals had been
[1:05:33] broken and every age had come down and
[1:05:36] there they had left a lot of scattering.
[1:05:37] See through through the ages so many
[1:05:39] things had gotten scattered out. The
[1:05:41] truth had been scattered. They they cut
[1:05:43] it all apart and you had all these loose
[1:05:45] ends and all these doctrines and
[1:05:46] halftruths and partial this and and he
[1:05:49] said it's all been scattered. He says
[1:05:51] and God not willing that it should be
[1:05:53] scattered, he comes back and picks up
[1:05:55] those things, those doctrines they
[1:05:57] started and brought it on out and
[1:05:58] revealed the whole thing. That's why we
[1:06:00] say that brother Brandham before the
[1:06:02] seals, what's he doing? He's clearing
[1:06:03] up. He's tying up a lot of the loose
[1:06:05] ends. That's what he's doing. He's
[1:06:07] getting the people ready for what God
[1:06:08] really wants to do. But he's got to
[1:06:10] clear out all the clutter. He's got to
[1:06:12] get rid of all the fog and all all all
[1:06:14] the things that don't add up with what
[1:06:16] all the denominations believe in these
[1:06:17] different things. He says he brought it
[1:06:19] on out, revealed the whole thing. It's
[1:06:21] the same thing he's doing now in
[1:06:23] revealing the mystery of Christ. How he
[1:06:25] was God's three-fold purpose for the
[1:06:27] church. Notice what he's saying. He's
[1:06:28] saying it was all right to start, but
[1:06:30] then it got scattered and now he's
[1:06:32] bringing it back again so we can see
[1:06:34] what God was trying to do all along.
[1:06:36] Amen. Now, I'm not going to preach this
[1:06:37] whole message of Christ is the mystery
[1:06:39] of God revealed to you tonight. Amen.
[1:06:41] But I'm going to just selectively hit
[1:06:43] some points as we we speak on this
[1:06:44] thought on the mystery finished. Now, I
[1:06:46] don't know about you, if you have
[1:06:48] favorite messages. I have a couple
[1:06:49] favorite messages. This is far and away
[1:06:51] my favoriteest message. I absolutely
[1:06:54] love it. And every time I listen to it,
[1:06:56] every time I read it, I underline
[1:06:57] something new. I see something new. I I
[1:06:59] think somebody said maybe brother Lonnie
[1:07:01] Jenkins said this was the seventh seal
[1:07:03] message that brother Brandon preached
[1:07:06] because after the seals were preached he
[1:07:08] says the whole thing became a new book
[1:07:10] and he starts to see things from a
[1:07:12] bigger picture and from a greater
[1:07:14] perspective than he ever has. And this
[1:07:15] is one of the most wonderful messages.
[1:07:17] Amen. And I think it's most beautiful
[1:07:19] because we can see our part in
[1:07:21] everything that God was trying to do. He
[1:07:24] says this. He says, "Now notice, God has
[1:07:26] had a three-fold purpose in this great
[1:07:28] mystery secret. God in his great mystery
[1:07:31] secret that he had before the world
[1:07:33] began, he has a three-fold purpose." And
[1:07:36] we're going to summarize the first two
[1:07:38] of those. The third one really comes
[1:07:39] after we go anyway, so it's not as as
[1:07:42] critical to what we're preaching on
[1:07:43] right now. But I want us to get to our
[1:07:45] part. That's what I'm interested in
[1:07:47] tonight is what's mine? What do I have
[1:07:49] to do? What does God have for me? What
[1:07:51] does the word say about my part in this
[1:07:53] mystery? Amen. But we want to see first
[1:07:55] what came before us. We have all those
[1:07:57] types in the the and shadows in the
[1:07:59] lives of the believers. We'll see later
[1:08:00] how that plays in. Amen. But we want to
[1:08:03] see what God's trying to show us. And
[1:08:05] let's look at this three-fold purpose
[1:08:07] here just quickly for the second half of
[1:08:09] this service. He says, "Now the first
[1:08:11] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[1:08:13] himself to the people." He said he
[1:08:17] couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[1:08:19] who covered all space, time, and
[1:08:21] eternity. He could not. He's too great
[1:08:23] to ever be revealed to people because it
[1:08:25] would be too mysterious. How could that
[1:08:27] great being that never did begin that
[1:08:30] after you went beyond the cycle of
[1:08:31] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:08:33] trillions of years of light space and on
[1:08:36] out into the infinite into the eternity
[1:08:38] and a great creature that was all that
[1:08:40] and still is? He said, "How could we do
[1:08:42] that, church? We can't even understand
[1:08:44] ourselves.
[1:08:47] We can't.
[1:08:49] I don't know why I do certain things.
[1:08:52] And yet, how would I ever hope to
[1:08:54] understand the great God, the
[1:08:56] self-existing one that has no beginning,
[1:08:58] that has no end, that covers all space
[1:09:00] and time. As brother Bram says, he says
[1:09:02] he was unobtainable. He was unreachable,
[1:09:05] unstandable in his original form. Okay?
[1:09:09] But what does he do? He wants to
[1:09:10] connect. He wants to create a touch
[1:09:13] point. He wants relationship. He said
[1:09:16] but what he wanted to do he loved
[1:09:18] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[1:09:20] only way he could express it was to
[1:09:22] become a son a man that's the reason
[1:09:25] Jesus kept saying the son of man see
[1:09:27] they didn't know what he was talking
[1:09:28] about many of them see he wanted to
[1:09:30] express himself that was one it was the
[1:09:33] first of his great three-fold purpose
[1:09:35] was to express himself
[1:09:38] identify himself with human beings to
[1:09:42] reveal himself in Christ now we're
[1:09:45] seeing this great desire. Now, we're
[1:09:46] talking the three-fold purpose of God.
[1:09:49] And he says the first thing he has here
[1:09:51] is he has a desire. And his desire is to
[1:09:54] have relationship. We would say God
[1:09:56] wanted to have a family. I would say God
[1:09:59] wanted to be a family. Not just have a
[1:10:03] family, but be a family. Cuz say
[1:10:04] somebody could walk up to me and say,
[1:10:06] "Hey, you seem like a pretty nice guy.
[1:10:07] Why don't we go live in a house together
[1:10:09] and we'll be a family?" No, that's not
[1:10:11] it. That's not going to work. a young
[1:10:13] man could come up and say, "Hey, you
[1:10:14] look like you might be a good dad. How
[1:10:16] about you be my dad and I'll be your
[1:10:17] son." As much as I could adopt him and
[1:10:19] take him into my home church, that's not
[1:10:21] the true basis of relationship. The true
[1:10:23] basis of relationship is origin. It's
[1:10:26] where you come from. And guess what? As
[1:10:29] much as I could try to bring that son
[1:10:32] into my home, he's not my son truly
[1:10:36] in the same way that Jonathan and Jensen
[1:10:38] and Samuel are because they're blood of
[1:10:40] my blood. They come for me. There is a
[1:10:42] natural thing that's built into me to
[1:10:44] love them. And as much as I could extend
[1:10:46] myself to that young man that wants to
[1:10:48] be a part of my family, that wants to
[1:10:49] call me dad, all these things, I
[1:10:51] guarantee you I would never love him the
[1:10:52] way I love my the ones that came from
[1:10:54] me. There's a linkage there that comes
[1:10:56] from that. There's a bloodline that
[1:10:58] keeps me tied to them, no matter how
[1:11:00] horrible they are.
[1:11:02] I have no such problems with my
[1:11:04] daughter, of course,
[1:11:06] because she's always wonderful.
[1:11:09] No,
[1:11:11] they're all wonderful in their own way.
[1:11:13] And they're all horrible in their own
[1:11:15] way, too.
[1:11:19] We're were horrible. Amen. Selena's
[1:11:22] getting offended in the front. If this
[1:11:25] offends you, watch this. That's what
[1:11:26] Jesus said, right? No, we're not going
[1:11:28] to do that. Amen. But God wanted to be a
[1:11:31] family. Amen. God wanted to have love
[1:11:32] based on origin,
[1:11:35] not just based on somebody saying,
[1:11:36] "Well, I guess I'll love you, God." He
[1:11:38] wanted something that was deeper than
[1:11:39] that. And how does God become a family
[1:11:42] with humanity? Brother Ram says he comes
[1:11:44] down and he puts himself into humanity.
[1:11:47] He takes and he forms himself into human
[1:11:49] body. The first thing he did was he made
[1:11:51] Adam. Adam was the son of God. And he
[1:11:54] made Adam. But what Adam fell by way of
[1:11:57] disobedience and now God is I I he's not
[1:12:00] left in a lurch because he saw it all
[1:12:01] coming. But he's left without a means to
[1:12:03] progress if I could put it that way.
[1:12:05] Because Adam fell. Adam fell by his free
[1:12:08] will. And so, you know what God said?
[1:12:10] God said, "Listen, no matter who I
[1:12:12] build, they're going to fall in free
[1:12:14] will." So, he says, "I need somebody
[1:12:16] that won't fall. I've got to go down
[1:12:18] myself." And so, what did he do? He
[1:12:20] built himself a body called Jesus. And
[1:12:23] he stepped down and he poured himself
[1:12:24] into it. Amen. But see this, church, he
[1:12:28] had to do what he did with Adam. See,
[1:12:31] with Adam, he had to strike Adam and
[1:12:33] take a part out to make a family for
[1:12:36] Adam. And so, what did he do? He had to
[1:12:38] make a second Adam. And then he had to
[1:12:40] strike him to take a bride out of him as
[1:12:42] well. Amen. That's perfect
[1:12:44] compatibility, church. That's perfect
[1:12:46] unity. You know something fits if it
[1:12:48] comes out of something.
[1:12:50] You strike something, it pops out. You
[1:12:52] know it's going to go right back in
[1:12:54] because it came from that place. It's
[1:12:55] built out of that very thing. Amen.
[1:12:57] That's perfect compatibility. You can't
[1:12:59] you can't dislike something that comes
[1:13:01] from you.
[1:13:03] Remember the scripture says though we
[1:13:05] deny him he cannot deny us. He says
[1:13:08] because he cannot deny himself. What we
[1:13:10] lack sometimes is the revelation of
[1:13:12] where we come from in our humanity. But
[1:13:14] he can't deny us because we come from
[1:13:16] him. The scripture says a man can't hate
[1:13:18] his wife because she's his own flesh.
[1:13:21] He shouldn't. Amen.
[1:13:24] But he had to smite Christ as he did
[1:13:26] Adam to bring out a bride. Now watch
[1:13:28] this. He says it's it pleased God to
[1:13:31] smite him.
[1:13:33] He's trying to create a family now.
[1:13:35] Okay? He says, "And now why did he smite
[1:13:38] him?" He says, "For the same cause he
[1:13:39] had to smite Adam." Now we see him
[1:13:41] stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted,
[1:13:43] the perfect lamb for sinners slain, a
[1:13:46] perfect masterpiece. He says, "Now for
[1:13:49] 2,000 years, God has been again making
[1:13:53] him a masterpiece." In other words,
[1:13:56] there's a process that's going on,
[1:13:58] church, and it's to produce a second
[1:14:01] masterpiece.
[1:14:02] He says, because he struck Adam to get a
[1:14:04] piece off of him, part of him to a rib
[1:14:07] to make a wife for him. He says, and now
[1:14:09] that perfect masterpiece that he struck
[1:14:11] at Calvary, he got a piece off of him.
[1:14:14] He says it's just the New Testament,
[1:14:15] that's all. Catch this now.
[1:14:18] He says it's just the New Testament,
[1:14:20] that's all. He fulfilled the Old
[1:14:22] Testament. Now, it's the New Testament.
[1:14:24] another piece to be fulfilled. See the
[1:14:26] new and the old is husband and wife. The
[1:14:29] first hus the first masterpiece
[1:14:31] fulfilled the old testament. The second
[1:14:33] test the second masterpiece has to be
[1:14:36] fulfilled in the old new testament. He
[1:14:39] says it it took the old to for show the
[1:14:42] new. Christ came the masterpiece to
[1:14:44] fulfill that. He says now his bride will
[1:14:47] fulfill everything that's in the new
[1:14:49] testament. He says another masterpiece
[1:14:51] is in the making. You say, "Brother
[1:14:53] John, what is this about?" A
[1:14:54] masterpiece. You're a masterpiece.
[1:14:57] You're the in the process of God
[1:14:59] creating a masterpiece to fulfill the
[1:15:02] New Testament. You're the word
[1:15:04] fulfilled. You're the masterpiece that
[1:15:05] will fulfill the word. He says it took
[1:15:08] him 4,000 years to make this
[1:15:10] masterpiece. He's talking of Christ. He
[1:15:12] said now he's been for nearly 2,000
[1:15:14] years making another masterpiece, a
[1:15:16] bribe for Christ, another masterpiece.
[1:15:19] He says in doing it, in so doing it, he
[1:15:21] does it by his neverchanging method. The
[1:15:24] same way he made the masterpiece, he
[1:15:26] said his word.
[1:15:29] That's the way he makes his
[1:15:30] masterpieces. Because he can only be a
[1:15:32] perfect masterpiece when it's the
[1:15:35] perfect word. Why is the word our
[1:15:37] inheritance? Because it's the only thing
[1:15:38] that produces a masterpiece. It's the
[1:15:40] only thing that works to produce what
[1:15:43] God is looking for. That's why we focus
[1:15:46] so much on the word because the word is
[1:15:49] the producer of the masterpiece. It's
[1:15:51] the only thing that gets us ready. It's
[1:15:53] the only thing that makes us suitable.
[1:15:54] It's the only thing that makes us match
[1:15:56] the image of the word that we're reading
[1:15:58] from. Amen. The word itself by the power
[1:16:00] of the spirit. Amen. It's the very thing
[1:16:02] that's driving this time, this season,
[1:16:04] this age that we're in. And it's doing a
[1:16:06] work on the bride today. That's the
[1:16:09] first thing he said was to reveal
[1:16:10] himself to the people. He says now he's
[1:16:12] doing a second thing. It's a masterpiece
[1:16:15] of the bride. He says secondly, it's to
[1:16:17] have the preeminence in his body of
[1:16:20] believers. That is his bride that he
[1:16:24] might do one thing,
[1:16:26] live in people.
[1:16:30] That's why we can look back in the Old
[1:16:32] Testament and we see shadows and we see
[1:16:34] types. We see the spirit of God coming
[1:16:36] on somebody but not staying with
[1:16:38] somebody. We see somebody doing
[1:16:39] something that's so perfect and the next
[1:16:41] minute something that's so flawed. It's
[1:16:43] just a type. It's imperfect. But it was
[1:16:45] showing what God was wanting to do all
[1:16:47] the time with everyone that's a part of
[1:16:49] his family. Amen. This is the massive
[1:16:53] portion that we've been building up to
[1:16:54] in this entire series is what is God
[1:16:56] trying to do? What is the purpose that
[1:16:58] he gave the Holy Spirit in the New
[1:17:01] Testament to the New Testament church?
[1:17:02] Amen. That's why he sent it back to us
[1:17:04] so we could have a new birth. And that's
[1:17:06] why we need this word with the spirit
[1:17:08] behind it is to what? Cause a
[1:17:10] transformation to produce this second
[1:17:13] masterpiece that he's talking about.
[1:17:14] Amen.
[1:17:16] Why do we need the spirit to point us to
[1:17:18] the word so we know that it's the spirit
[1:17:20] talking to us and not another spirit?
[1:17:22] Because let me tell you, there's a lot
[1:17:23] of spirits rolling around trying to
[1:17:25] produce their own masterpiece. As God is
[1:17:27] trying to produce a bride, Satan's
[1:17:29] producing a great Amen. And the
[1:17:31] people that are doing it think they're
[1:17:32] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:34] It takes the word to straighten us up
[1:17:37] and get us right. Coming back to
[1:17:39] Colossians now, he says, "For this cause
[1:17:42] we also since the day we heard it, do
[1:17:44] not cease to pray for you and to desire
[1:17:46] that you may be filled with the
[1:17:47] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[1:17:50] spiritual understanding." We're talking
[1:17:51] about this bride masterpiece now that
[1:17:53] God wants to live in people. Now, we're
[1:17:56] not going to touch on it this service on
[1:17:58] this idea of of of all know of the
[1:18:00] knowledge of his will, but I'll say
[1:18:02] this. Brother Bram said that the bride
[1:18:04] knows what the what he wants done with
[1:18:06] the word. She has the word. She knows
[1:18:10] what he wants done with it. And that's
[1:18:12] what she does. Amen. That's part of
[1:18:13] being adopted is knowing his will and
[1:18:16] then doing it. He says, "Why? That you
[1:18:18] might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[1:18:20] pleasing, being fruitful in every good
[1:18:23] work and increasing the knowledge of
[1:18:25] God." Notice all pleasing. Everything
[1:18:27] that you would do would be pleasing to
[1:18:28] him. That our lives would be completely
[1:18:31] pleasing. Church, when you see all, it's
[1:18:33] a superlative. It's an absolute. It
[1:18:35] means that everything that you do is
[1:18:38] pleasing to God.
[1:18:40] Being fruitful in how much of your good
[1:18:42] works? All of it. Every good work.
[1:18:46] Everything that you do that you're doing
[1:18:48] for God is satisfying. Amen. And that
[1:18:50] we're increasing in the knowledge of
[1:18:52] God. So, in other words, God's looking
[1:18:54] for our lives. He's desiring that our
[1:18:56] lives will produce fruit that reflects
[1:18:58] something more than me.
[1:19:01] that reflects something more of you.
[1:19:03] Amen. There's a way for that to happen.
[1:19:05] It's not by those self-chosen, stubborn
[1:19:07] works that we talked about in Matthew 7
[1:19:09] where they're going to come to Jesus and
[1:19:10] say, "Hey, we did all these wonderful
[1:19:11] works." He says, "Depart from me. I
[1:19:13] never knew you." What's the problem?
[1:19:14] They decided what they wanted to do for
[1:19:16] God and then they went and did it.
[1:19:19] That's not what we're here to do. We're
[1:19:21] here to have him tell us what he wants
[1:19:22] to do and then we do it. Amen. You'll
[1:19:25] get fruit if you do it your own way, but
[1:19:27] it just doesn't last.
[1:19:29] It doesn't last. Why? Because it it
[1:19:32] doesn't have eternal life inside of it.
[1:19:34] It's not God working in it. Jesus said
[1:19:36] it this way in John. He said, "I am the
[1:19:39] vine. You are the branches. He that
[1:19:41] abideth in me and I in him. The same
[1:19:44] bringeth forth much fruit. For without
[1:19:47] me, you can do nothing." Now, catch
[1:19:50] this. You can do nothing of eternal
[1:19:52] value. You can do nothing that I'm
[1:19:54] looking for. Without me. Why? Because
[1:19:57] without him, you don't know what he
[1:19:58] wants. Without him, you don't know what
[1:20:00] you're supposed to do. You don't know
[1:20:01] the right way. You don't know the right
[1:20:03] attitude. You don't want You have no
[1:20:04] clue. You're just coming up with
[1:20:06] something out of your own religious
[1:20:07] context somehow. And then he says this.
[1:20:10] He says, "You have not chosen me, but I
[1:20:12] have chosen you and ordained you."
[1:20:17] In other words, I've got a purpose
[1:20:18] already declared for you that you should
[1:20:21] go for go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:20:24] your fruit should do one thing. Remain.
[1:20:29] That word remain means abide, continue,
[1:20:32] and endure. Now, church, we're talking
[1:20:35] about the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:36] really is what we're looking at here.
[1:20:37] And notice what he says is you don't
[1:20:39] lose your fruit based on circumstances.
[1:20:43] that when things go sour, when things go
[1:20:45] sideways, when time gets tough, when
[1:20:47] you're feeling disappointed, when you're
[1:20:48] feeling down, that your fruit goes away.
[1:20:50] He's saying, "No, no matter what, your
[1:20:52] fruit stays."
[1:20:55] You don't lose your Christianity when
[1:20:57] things are not the way that you might
[1:20:58] want them to be. When hard times come,
[1:21:00] the fruit endures. The fruit remains. He
[1:21:03] says, "Why? That whatsoever you shall
[1:21:05] ask of the Father in my name, he shall
[1:21:08] give it to you." So what Paul's talking
[1:21:10] about is the fulfillment of Jesus words
[1:21:12] here that your fruit should remain. What
[1:21:14] did Paul say just a little bit earlier?
[1:21:16] He said that you would be fruitful in
[1:21:19] every good work and increasing the
[1:21:22] knowledge of God. Jesus said this is
[1:21:24] what's supposed to happen. How you going
[1:21:25] to get there, church? You've got to
[1:21:26] abide in him. That's the only way you
[1:21:28] can do it. How do you abide in him? 1
[1:21:30] Corinthians 12, by one spirit. We're
[1:21:33] baptized into one body, the body of
[1:21:35] Christ, the bride of Christ. That's the
[1:21:37] only way you can abide with Christ is by
[1:21:39] the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, we're just
[1:21:41] in a religious experience. And you can't
[1:21:43] produce this good, this lasting fruit
[1:21:45] without the spirit, without being tied
[1:21:47] into Christ.
[1:21:49] Paul continues. He says, "Strengthened
[1:21:52] with all might according to his glorious
[1:21:54] power
[1:21:56] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[1:21:59] joyfulness."
[1:22:01] I want you to read a portion of this
[1:22:02] with me. Strengthened with what?
[1:22:06] How much might?
[1:22:08] All might.
[1:22:11] According to his glorious power unto,
[1:22:14] how much patience? All patience and
[1:22:18] longsuffering with joyfulness. Here
[1:22:20] goes, brother John.
[1:22:23] Church, when I see all, I say, "Praise
[1:22:25] the Lord."
[1:22:28] If you're feeling weak, what does the
[1:22:29] word say as your inheritance? Almight.
[1:22:32] When you're worn out, what does the word
[1:22:34] say? Almighty.
[1:22:36] When you're feeling overcome, what does
[1:22:39] it say? Glorious power.
[1:22:41] When you're going through the valley of
[1:22:44] the shadow of death, when you can't see
[1:22:46] light at the end of the tunnel, what is
[1:22:48] there? All patience and longsuffering
[1:22:52] with joyfulness.
[1:22:54] Church, the problem ain't us. Ain't the
[1:22:56] promise. It's whether or not we'll
[1:22:58] receive it. He says you can go through
[1:23:01] this with joyfulness or you can go
[1:23:03] through it your way. But it's not
[1:23:05] because I didn't offer it to you. All
[1:23:08] might, glorious power, all patience,
[1:23:11] longsuffering with joyfulness. Amen.
[1:23:14] Problem is not the inheritance, church.
[1:23:16] The problem is a people that's willing
[1:23:18] to accept it.
[1:23:20] He says, "Giving thanks unto the father
[1:23:22] which hath made us meet."
[1:23:25] That word meat means qualified you. God
[1:23:28] has qualified you.
[1:23:30] God has made us of a nature and equality
[1:23:33] that meets his standard.
[1:23:36] That's what he produces, church. God
[1:23:38] doesn't produce substandard materials.
[1:23:41] God doesn't produce failures. God
[1:23:43] doesn't produce losers.
[1:23:46] God has made us meat to be partakers of
[1:23:49] the inheritance of his saints in light
[1:23:51] church. God has literally qualified us
[1:23:54] to be saints, to take part in this
[1:23:57] inheritance. Amen. He's built us. He's
[1:24:00] prepared us from eternity to partake of
[1:24:02] what we're talking about tonight. You're
[1:24:04] built for your inheritance. Amen. You're
[1:24:08] accepted. Now, watch how he qualifies
[1:24:10] us. It doesn't seem so obvious at first,
[1:24:13] but let's keep reading this. He says,
[1:24:15] "He's made us meet. He's made us
[1:24:17] qualified to be partakers, who had
[1:24:20] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:24:21] and had translated us into the kingdom
[1:24:23] of his dear son. In whom we have
[1:24:26] redemption through his blood, even the
[1:24:29] forgiveness of sins, who is the
[1:24:31] invisible image of the invisible God,
[1:24:33] the firstborn of every creature. For by
[1:24:35] him were all things created that are in
[1:24:37] heaven and that are in earth, visible
[1:24:39] and invisible, whether they be thrones
[1:24:41] or dominions or principalities or
[1:24:43] powers. All things were created by him
[1:24:46] and for him and he is before all things
[1:24:48] and by him all things consist church. I
[1:24:51] just told you he qualified us. And I
[1:24:52] just read it. Did you catch it?
[1:24:56] Did you catch it? Who is Paul talking
[1:24:59] about? Whose virtues is Paul extolling?
[1:25:01] Who is Paul raising up here? Is it you
[1:25:04] and I?
[1:25:07] It is by extension. But who's he talking
[1:25:09] about? Christ. And he can't shut up
[1:25:12] about Christ. He's qualified you. And
[1:25:15] then who does he talk about? He doesn't
[1:25:16] talk about you and I. He talks about
[1:25:17] Christ.
[1:25:19] Why? Because Christ is the one that
[1:25:21] qualifies us, not ourselves. Amen. It's
[1:25:24] through him that we're qualified. Amen.
[1:25:26] I'm taking our prophet's message now and
[1:25:28] he's speaking of Christ, the image of
[1:25:30] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:25:32] every creature. Christ was the original
[1:25:34] creation of God, the dwelling place of
[1:25:36] God. And we just said that God qualified
[1:25:38] us. Now, Brother Matt knows a lot about
[1:25:40] quality assurance. Amen. And he says,
[1:25:43] "God has told us we're qualified for
[1:25:46] what comes our way. The inheritance he
[1:25:49] has for us in the word, the inheritance
[1:25:50] that he has waiting for us. But what
[1:25:52] makes us qualified? What makes us
[1:25:54] suitable? What gives us the stamp of
[1:25:56] approval that makes sure that God is not
[1:25:58] rejecting us? That at then it comes down
[1:26:01] to the final point, the final check that
[1:26:03] God doesn't say, you are so close, but
[1:26:05] depart from me." What is it that does
[1:26:08] that? What is quality assurance?
[1:26:11] Quality assurance is in a manufacturing
[1:26:13] process, but it can be any process. It
[1:26:14] can be software, coding, all sorts of
[1:26:16] things, but it's generally accepted in
[1:26:18] the manufacturing process where
[1:26:20] everything that's built or a certain
[1:26:21] portion of things that are built, they
[1:26:23] get checked against the original drawing
[1:26:25] or template.
[1:26:27] So, you have something as simple as
[1:26:29] we'll take this bottle of water. When
[1:26:32] they make the bottle, they make the
[1:26:33] bottle, they make the caps. Now, there's
[1:26:35] a couple things that really matter with
[1:26:36] this. It's got to have the ribs for
[1:26:38] stability and it's got to have the
[1:26:40] threads in it that are at the perfect
[1:26:42] pitch and they got to be spaced just
[1:26:44] right and they can't have too much
[1:26:45] material because if they have too much
[1:26:47] material the cap won't go on and if they
[1:26:49] have too little material then the cap
[1:26:51] won't tighten up. So the quality check
[1:26:53] on this primarily is going to be that it
[1:26:55] is the correct dimension on the outside
[1:26:57] and that the threads that this cap goes
[1:26:59] on are the right size and shape. Okay.
[1:27:03] And what happens is they'll take that
[1:27:04] and they won't take everyone because
[1:27:06] it's a high-speed process, but they'll
[1:27:08] take every one of the hundred or they'll
[1:27:09] take one out of a thousand, whatever it
[1:27:11] might be, and they'll take it and
[1:27:12] they'll check everything on it. And if
[1:27:15] it doesn't match the drawing, what do
[1:27:16] they do?
[1:27:18] They throw it out. They put it back in
[1:27:20] the melting pot. They say it's no good.
[1:27:23] And what do they have to do? They have
[1:27:24] to go check everything that's run on
[1:27:25] that machine since they caught that one.
[1:27:28] And what do they do, church? They have
[1:27:30] what they call rejects.
[1:27:32] And the purpose of quality assurance is
[1:27:34] to make sure that what you get is what
[1:27:36] you designed in the first place.
[1:27:39] What's our quality assurance church?
[1:27:43] Tell you what, it's not John Kurlet.
[1:27:46] It's not the five-fold ministry.
[1:27:49] It's not our works. It's not our amens.
[1:27:51] It's not our church attendance. It comes
[1:27:53] another way. Amen.
[1:27:56] Remember, we've said it of of Christ in
[1:27:58] the in the past so many times. Scripture
[1:28:01] says that God looked at Christ and he
[1:28:03] said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:28:05] am well pleased."
[1:28:07] What was he doing?
[1:28:10] Quality assurance. He said, "He's
[1:28:12] perfect. He's so perfect. I'm going to
[1:28:15] dwell in him and you have to listen to
[1:28:18] him now."
[1:28:20] So what did he do? He guaranteed Christ.
[1:28:22] He put his stamp of approval on Christ.
[1:28:24] Amen. God deemed him a perfect creation.
[1:28:27] So perfect church that he could dwell in
[1:28:31] him. Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] Church,
[1:28:36] your quality is determined by what he
[1:28:40] puts in you.
[1:28:44] So when he fills you with his spirit,
[1:28:47] what's he saying?
[1:28:50] He's saying, "This is my beloved son.
[1:28:53] This is my beloved daughter. This is my
[1:28:56] quality assured
[1:28:58] perfection
[1:29:00] because he won't put perfection
[1:29:03] in a vessel of dishonor.
[1:29:07] The vessel is prepared for what goes
[1:29:10] into it. Amen.
[1:29:14] Only a perfect vessel can can contain
[1:29:16] God. Hallelujah.
[1:29:19] I'm telling you, only a perfect vessel
[1:29:21] can contain God. What do you have when
[1:29:24] you receive the Holy Spirit? God
[1:29:26] himself, church. That's the place you're
[1:29:28] sitting tonight in heavenly places. He's
[1:29:31] accepted you. He says, "Let us not
[1:29:33] forget that in the beginning when he
[1:29:35] smoked the side of Adam, he took
[1:29:37] something from his side. Now the smiting
[1:29:40] of Christ was for a cause that he might
[1:29:42] take from him one to be a family, the
[1:29:45] bride. He might take him a bride. So
[1:29:47] when his masterpiece was perfected, then
[1:29:50] he had to smite it to take from him not
[1:29:53] another piece, not another creation, but
[1:29:56] of the same creation.
[1:30:00] See church, too often we draw a
[1:30:02] distinction between us and Christ.
[1:30:05] He's trying to take that away. He's
[1:30:07] trying to get our eyes focused on what
[1:30:09] he's got for us. He says, "My brother,
[1:30:12] don't think that bad at this." He says,
[1:30:14] "But think a minute. If he took from him
[1:30:16] the original creation to make a bride
[1:30:19] for him, he never made another creation.
[1:30:22] He took a part of the original creation.
[1:30:25] He says then if he was the word, what
[1:30:27] must the bride be? It's got to be the
[1:30:30] original word. Living God in the word.
[1:30:35] In other words, when God said Christ is
[1:30:37] perfect and then out of Christ came a
[1:30:39] bride, then that bride cannot be
[1:30:41] imperfect because she comes from a
[1:30:43] perfect source.
[1:30:46] She was qualified when Christ was
[1:30:48] qualified. She was perfected when Christ
[1:30:51] was perfected. Amen. She's a dwelling
[1:30:54] place, a temple for the living God
[1:30:56] today. Amen. As a many member Bible, as
[1:30:59] a many member bride, I should say. And
[1:31:01] she is the fullness
[1:31:04] expressed.
[1:31:06] Amen. The complete expression of Christ.
[1:31:08] Amen. Church of Christ is perfect. The
[1:31:11] bride's perfect. And if he was the
[1:31:13] perfect expression of God, then we have
[1:31:14] to be the perfect expression of Christ.
[1:31:17] You can't be perfect and have an
[1:31:19] imperfect expression. It doesn't work
[1:31:20] that way. Amen. That's our
[1:31:23] qualification. That's our guarantee of
[1:31:25] being accepted. We came from a qualified
[1:31:27] source.
[1:31:29] We have this thing
[1:31:32] when it comes to materials
[1:31:35] where if you take a material, brother
[1:31:38] Matt would know this, they work with
[1:31:39] some pretty fancy stuff over there. And
[1:31:40] when you're working in the offshore, you
[1:31:42] have these the the the steel that comes
[1:31:44] in and the special alloys
[1:31:47] and they what do they do, church? They
[1:31:49] certify it and they do a test on it and
[1:31:52] they say, "These are the certifications
[1:31:54] for this material. This is how strong it
[1:31:56] is. This is the elongation. This is the
[1:31:58] tensil strength. This is all these
[1:32:00] different things. Here's the the
[1:32:01] chemistry of it. And it all is to a
[1:32:03] spec. And when they certify it, Brother
[1:32:06] Matt, you're allowed to take any part of
[1:32:08] that material and use it, aren't you?
[1:32:10] You don't have to say, "Don't go get me
[1:32:11] another test." Why? Because it's
[1:32:13] certified.
[1:32:15] It's tested through and through. The
[1:32:18] process worked. It's a perfect material
[1:32:20] for what you're looking for. Amen. The
[1:32:23] problem is this.
[1:32:25] We take ourselves and we compare
[1:32:27] ourselves to Christ.
[1:32:30] We take our individual selves and we
[1:32:32] compare ourselves to the fullness of God
[1:32:34] in a single man. And what do we
[1:32:36] inevitably say?
[1:32:38] I'm not him.
[1:32:41] Cuz why? We're not all him.
[1:32:44] We were never meant to be all him. I was
[1:32:47] never meant to be all him. I You were
[1:32:48] never meant to be all him. We were
[1:32:50] supposed to be a part of him. He was the
[1:32:54] perfect example. Now we're just parts of
[1:32:56] that perfect example. Amen. God's not
[1:32:59] comparing us to Christ. God's comparing
[1:33:01] us to our purpose.
[1:33:04] God's got a different standard for me as
[1:33:06] a minister as for you as a lay person.
[1:33:10] God's got a different standard for
[1:33:11] deacons than he does for the other men
[1:33:13] of the congregation. Doesn't mean you
[1:33:15] can't act like a deacon. Doesn't mean
[1:33:16] you can't meet the qualifications of a
[1:33:18] deacon, but a deacon has to be a certain
[1:33:20] way.
[1:33:21] God compares you to what your role is.
[1:33:24] God compares you to what your purpose
[1:33:26] is. church. We're not here to be the
[1:33:28] fullness individually. We're here to be
[1:33:30] faithful. That's what God's looking for
[1:33:32] is faithful servants, not fullness
[1:33:35] servants. He's saying, "What are you
[1:33:36] doing with what I've given you? Are you
[1:33:38] where I told you to be? Are you found
[1:33:40] doing what I told you to do?" Amen.
[1:33:42] We're faithful servants, not full
[1:33:43] service. That's what he's calling us to
[1:33:46] be. Are we faithful to and with the
[1:33:48] portion that God has given us? That's
[1:33:50] what shows we pass from death unto life.
[1:33:52] We're joined into the body. Now, we're
[1:33:54] functioning. It's a part of our
[1:33:55] adoption. Paul would say it this way. He
[1:33:58] says, "I beseech you therefore,
[1:33:59] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[1:34:01] you present your bodies a living
[1:34:04] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[1:34:07] which is your reasonable service." So
[1:34:10] what is our part, church? Our part is to
[1:34:13] offer.
[1:34:15] Our part is to make ourselves available.
[1:34:17] That's all we have to do. He is the one
[1:34:20] that takes our offering or lays it
[1:34:22] aside.
[1:34:24] Amen. But he's not going to lay any one
[1:34:26] of us aside completely. But we might
[1:34:28] offer ourselves for something that we're
[1:34:30] not ready for, that we're not built for,
[1:34:33] that we're not called for. But the point
[1:34:35] is to offer. And it's up to him to place
[1:34:38] you into service. Amen. What we're
[1:34:41] supposed to do is be available for use.
[1:34:43] Remember when brother Mark preached on
[1:34:44] this not too long ago,
[1:34:46] when brother Mark taught on this, he's
[1:34:48] not a preacher. I'm not allowed to say
[1:34:50] that.
[1:34:52] But when he taught on this, he says,
[1:34:53] "What is our purpose? To keep ourselves
[1:34:56] clean from the world and the things of
[1:34:58] the world. Keep our lives sanctified.
[1:35:00] That's our reasonable service." Church,
[1:35:03] God's not up there. I don't know if we
[1:35:06] did in Sunday school. We may have, but I
[1:35:07] know we certainly did it in elementary
[1:35:09] school. If you came into school every
[1:35:10] day, you got a gold star for attendance.
[1:35:13] And if you got a certain mark on your
[1:35:15] test, you got a star here and you got a
[1:35:16] star there. And when you got a certain
[1:35:17] number of stars, you got a prize of some
[1:35:19] sort. Anybody else have that?
[1:35:22] Well, guess what, church? God doesn't
[1:35:24] give us gold stars for coming to church,
[1:35:27] for paying our tithes, for staying
[1:35:28] separate from the world, for not
[1:35:30] drinking alcohol, for not going to
[1:35:33] parties. God doesn't give us gold stars
[1:35:35] for that. That's our reasonable service.
[1:35:38] That's just expected of us. That's what
[1:35:40] believers do no matter what. Amen. We're
[1:35:43] not God's not coming and patting us on
[1:35:45] the back. Oh, good for you. You made it
[1:35:46] to church on a Wednesday night and you
[1:35:48] were so tired. No, that's reasonable
[1:35:50] service. Unfortunately, we've turned
[1:35:52] that into look at my great sacrifice.
[1:35:57] It might feel like a sacrifice, but it's
[1:36:00] your reasonable service.
[1:36:02] Amen. Can I be your pastor tonight?
[1:36:05] Making it to church does not get you a
[1:36:07] pat on the back. I'm glad you're here.
[1:36:11] You're supposed to be here, but it's
[1:36:12] your reasonable service. Keeping
[1:36:14] yourself away from the things of the
[1:36:16] world, that's your reasonable service.
[1:36:17] Why? because you're making yourself fit
[1:36:20] for his use. You're making yourself
[1:36:22] available for his use. You're keeping
[1:36:24] the barriers and the boundaries that
[1:36:26] would go between you and Christ away.
[1:36:29] You're keeping an open channel between.
[1:36:30] Amen. But don't set yourself up for
[1:36:33] failure by setting a standard that God
[1:36:35] does doesn't. God's not looking at my
[1:36:38] life and comparing all of it to Christ
[1:36:40] and saying, "Yes, he matches or no, he
[1:36:42] doesn't."
[1:36:43] Our perfections in Christ. We will never
[1:36:45] have literal perfection in this flesh.
[1:36:48] So don't try.
[1:36:50] Don't expect it. It's not going to
[1:36:51] happen. We're fighting a battle every
[1:36:54] day and sometimes we win and sometimes
[1:36:55] we lose. But God's asking us to what?
[1:36:59] Make our bodies a living sacrifice. Keep
[1:37:01] our lives clean. Keep our lives
[1:37:03] sanctified so that he can use us. Amen.
[1:37:06] That's a reasonable requirement. That's
[1:37:07] a reasonable ser service from us. But
[1:37:10] it's up to him to put us into our
[1:37:12] purpose. Amen. And that's a part of
[1:37:13] adoption. Then he says, "What if you're
[1:37:17] doing that?" He says, "Be not conformed
[1:37:18] to this world." How do you know, church,
[1:37:20] that you're in your reasonable service?
[1:37:22] You're not being conformed to the world.
[1:37:24] You're not taking on their mindset.
[1:37:25] You're not taking on their issues.
[1:37:26] You're not taking on their worries.
[1:37:28] You're not taking on their their their
[1:37:30] dress, their habits.
[1:37:33] And man, I've seen too many times how
[1:37:35] the world has a certain uh style, and
[1:37:39] what do we do? The sisters will take it
[1:37:40] and they'll convert it into a skirt
[1:37:41] style, but it's the same thing. We don't
[1:37:44] do that. We don't need to do that. Just
[1:37:46] live your life according to the word. We
[1:37:49] shouldn't be taking our influence or
[1:37:50] inspiration from anything this world has
[1:37:51] to offer. That's for sure. He says, "But
[1:37:54] what? Be ye transformed by the renewing
[1:37:57] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:37:59] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:38:02] will of God." Church, what's he saying?
[1:38:04] He's saying, "Church, take care of the
[1:38:05] basics and watch God take care of you.
[1:38:09] If you'll take care of the basics, if
[1:38:11] you'll read your Bible, if you'll pray,
[1:38:12] if you'll keep yourself separated from
[1:38:14] the word, you'll prove what God's trying
[1:38:16] to do in this age. That's all we can
[1:38:18] really do, church. We can't raise
[1:38:21] ourselves up. We can't give ourselves a
[1:38:23] rapture. But what we can do is take what
[1:38:25] he says and obey it just simply day by
[1:38:28] day. It's a simple, humble, victorious
[1:38:30] Christian life. Amen. And what happens
[1:38:32] then is he'll place you and he'll use
[1:38:34] you to prove what he's trying to do.
[1:38:37] You'll be the proof. if you'll be the
[1:38:38] living proof of what God's trying to do
[1:38:40] in this age. Amen. There's all sorts of
[1:38:43] parts to our bodies that we have. And
[1:38:45] each one of us plays a part. And each
[1:38:47] one of us plays a different part. Hey,
[1:38:48] you might be a finger and I might be a
[1:38:50] finger, but I'm a pinky and you're a
[1:38:51] thumb. Or you might be a pinky and I
[1:38:54] might be a pinky, but you're on the left
[1:38:55] hand and I'm on the right. See, we've
[1:38:57] all got our own place in our position.
[1:38:59] Individually, we're not the fullness.
[1:39:00] But as an entire bride body of Christ,
[1:39:03] we are the fullness of Christ expressed.
[1:39:05] That's what the scripture says. Amen.
[1:39:07] That's an amazing thing to think. I
[1:39:09] can't claim it. You can't claim it. But
[1:39:10] together we can claim it. That's a
[1:39:12] wonderful thing that where I have a
[1:39:14] failure but brother Mark has a victory.
[1:39:15] I say, "Lord, I'm claiming the victory
[1:39:17] through brother Mark."
[1:39:19] You can do that sometimes, church.
[1:39:21] Listen, we don't all have great
[1:39:23] strengths. I believe there's victory for
[1:39:25] things that hold us back. But there's
[1:39:27] some amongst us that express Christ a
[1:39:28] little better than others in certain
[1:39:30] areas. But Brother Matt's got an
[1:39:32] expression. Sister Amber's got an
[1:39:34] expression that's different from mine.
[1:39:36] But together we c we all express Christ.
[1:39:39] And I can't do it without you and you
[1:39:40] can't do it without me. But together we
[1:39:42] can all do it. Amen. That's why it
[1:39:44] breaks my heart when I see those that
[1:39:46] aren't aren't here and those that go
[1:39:48] away and fall away and these different
[1:39:49] things is because we're potentially
[1:39:51] missing a part. And we need it here to
[1:39:53] have the fullness. We're all a part of
[1:39:55] that perfection that we're talking
[1:39:57] about. Paul says this. He says as we
[1:40:00] start to close tonight, he says, "And he
[1:40:02] is the head of the body, the church. who
[1:40:05] is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[1:40:07] dead, that in all things he might have
[1:40:09] the preeminence. For it pleased the
[1:40:11] father that in him should all fullness
[1:40:13] dwell. Now remember, we're talking about
[1:40:15] this three-fold purpose. The first was
[1:40:17] God could reveal himself to us, and that
[1:40:19] was through Christ. And God showed
[1:40:21] himself in many ways in the Old
[1:40:22] Testament through the lives of the
[1:40:24] believers. But it was all Christ being
[1:40:26] shown in those things. We saw a pillar
[1:40:28] of fire. We saw a burning bush. We saw
[1:40:30] Melzdc. We saw three angels walking, but
[1:40:33] one of them was the Lord. saw all these
[1:40:35] things and that was Christ being
[1:40:36] revealed. But we saw Christ revealed in
[1:40:38] a body and then we saw Christ revealed
[1:40:40] in people as well. It was two different
[1:40:43] things. Amen. But now he's bringing it
[1:40:45] together. He says, "Now we've got a head
[1:40:46] coming down to a body." Amen. And so God
[1:40:49] poured himself into a standard typical
[1:40:52] looking human. Jesus was just a regular
[1:40:54] looking guy. You know, probably look
[1:40:57] like brother Paul.
[1:41:00] just normal. Just regular
[1:41:03] slope shouldered, skinny, weak chin.
[1:41:07] No, just a normal guy. And God poured
[1:41:10] himself into that. Amen. And hey, what?
[1:41:12] He walked and he talked and he spoke and
[1:41:14] he ate and he slept and he he said
[1:41:17] things to us and he said hard things and
[1:41:19] he said nice things and he said jokes
[1:41:20] and all these different things. And it
[1:41:22] was God pouring himself into human
[1:41:24] flesh. And that was the first p purpose.
[1:41:25] But now the second purpose is this.
[1:41:28] Because once he's in Christ, now he's
[1:41:29] trying to do it now in his bride. He
[1:41:32] says what? He said Christ is the head of
[1:41:35] the church, the body. And what is the
[1:41:37] purpose of him stating that? He said so
[1:41:39] that he can have one thing have the
[1:41:42] preeminence in the church. The second
[1:41:45] purpose of God, the second part of this
[1:41:48] mystery revealing is for Christ to have
[1:41:51] preeminence in the church. In Ephesians
[1:41:53] 1, he says, "And he hath put all things
[1:41:55] under his feet and gave him to be the
[1:41:58] head over,"
[1:42:00] there's that word again. All church, if
[1:42:03] you want it all, you got to give it all.
[1:42:06] He says, "Head over all things to the
[1:42:08] church, which is his body." Listen to
[1:42:10] this description of the body. Which is
[1:42:13] his body, the fullness of him that
[1:42:16] fillth all in all. The Common English
[1:42:18] Bible says, "Which is his body?" His
[1:42:20] body, the church, is the fullness of
[1:42:23] Christ. He says, "Who fills everything
[1:42:26] in every way?" Church, can I ask you
[1:42:29] tonight, has Christ filled everything in
[1:42:31] every way in your life?
[1:42:34] I say we probably have some work to do
[1:42:37] because we're still here. But I say,
[1:42:39] Lord, have your way. Lord, help me to
[1:42:42] see those doors that are closed. help me
[1:42:43] to see areas where I'm holding on where
[1:42:45] I'm the head instead of you cuz he's
[1:42:48] preaching to us here and he's saying
[1:42:49] he's got to have the preeminence so he
[1:42:51] can fill every part of your life so he
[1:42:53] can express himself through every part
[1:42:55] of your life. Now, brother Brandham says
[1:42:57] it this way. He says revealing himself
[1:43:00] and having first to reveal himself in
[1:43:02] Christ the fullness of the Godhead
[1:43:04] bodily. He says, "And then to bring that
[1:43:06] fullness of the Godhead bodily into a
[1:43:09] people that he could have the
[1:43:11] preeminence, the oversight, the
[1:43:13] leading." Why? Why does he want to have
[1:43:16] the Why does he want to be the head? Why
[1:43:17] does he want to have the preeminence?
[1:43:18] Why does he want to have oversight? Why
[1:43:20] does he want to have the leading? He
[1:43:22] says, "And through that purpose, he
[1:43:24] achieved a church that he, the fullness
[1:43:26] of God, might bring to pass every
[1:43:29] promised word of God in these last
[1:43:32] days."
[1:43:33] What did Jesus say? I came to do the
[1:43:36] will of my father. What's the bride
[1:43:37] going to say? I came to fulfill what
[1:43:40] Christ desires.
[1:43:43] Cuz we're built from the same cloth.
[1:43:45] We're made of the same metal. He came to
[1:43:48] do the will. We come to do the will as
[1:43:50] well. What is it to produce the word?
[1:43:52] Every promise of the word in this day.
[1:43:54] He says when he gets the preeminence in
[1:43:56] the church, the position, his place in
[1:43:59] the church. Jesus said, "He that
[1:44:01] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:44:03] shall he also, even more than this shall
[1:44:06] he do, for I go to my father." He said,
[1:44:07] "See, that was his purpose. There was
[1:44:10] the manifestation." Let me say it this
[1:44:12] way. There is the manifestation. There
[1:44:14] will be the manifestation. What is it? A
[1:44:16] continuation of the works of Jesus
[1:44:18] Christ. What was his work? To do the
[1:44:22] word that was written of him. That was
[1:44:24] the will of the father. To fulfill every
[1:44:26] word. Like I said last service, Jesus
[1:44:28] never overstepped or underepped his
[1:44:30] authority. He did exactly what the word
[1:44:33] said he would do. No more, no less. He
[1:44:35] never presumed. He was perfectly in the
[1:44:38] will of the father.
[1:44:41] You say, "That's beautiful, brother
[1:44:42] John." Listen to this. He says, "And now
[1:44:44] today," he wants to get somebody that
[1:44:46] can so see it that they can let the
[1:44:48] word, he said, see Jesus so saw it was
[1:44:51] so perfectly born for the day. Church,
[1:44:54] you're born for the day. That's what
[1:44:56] he's trying to get you. See, as Christ
[1:44:58] was born in the right time, in the right
[1:45:00] season, in the right place, in the right
[1:45:01] way, in the right circumstances, so you
[1:45:03] are born the same way. He says, until
[1:45:06] God was expressed in every move that he
[1:45:09] made, he was God's revelation, God
[1:45:12] revealed. That's what God's trying to
[1:45:14] get in us, that we could be God revealed
[1:45:17] all over again. That Christ could be
[1:45:19] revealed through us. He says, "Now he's
[1:45:21] sanctified with his spirit and blood, a
[1:45:23] church that he might make every promise
[1:45:26] in this last day be revealed."
[1:45:30] See, we put so much on Christ and what
[1:45:32] he did and the supernatural power and
[1:45:34] authority that was there. And he says,
[1:45:35] "Listen, you're just a continuation of
[1:45:38] what he was doing.
[1:45:40] He fulfilled the Old Testament. Now he's
[1:45:42] got a whole New Testament that has to be
[1:45:43] fulfilled and you're it. Balls in your
[1:45:46] court. Are you going to take the shot?
[1:45:48] Are you going to step step up to the
[1:45:49] line?
[1:45:51] How's he going to do it, church? Not in
[1:45:54] dead letters,
[1:45:57] but he's going to quicken it by the
[1:45:58] spirit
[1:46:00] and make it spirit and life. Amen. It
[1:46:03] has to be revealed in us, not just to
[1:46:06] us. The purpose of revealing it to us is
[1:46:08] so that it can be in us. It's the same
[1:46:10] thing with God. He's revealed to us so
[1:46:12] he can be in us. The word is revealed to
[1:46:14] us so it can be in us and work through
[1:46:16] us. He says, "Now see, he could go back
[1:46:18] and pick up what those other fellas had
[1:46:20] left off here in the last days and by
[1:46:23] his Holy Spirit reveal all the mystery
[1:46:25] of the seven seals." He said, "See, he's
[1:46:27] expressing himself." He's not just
[1:46:29] talking. He's not just speaking. He's
[1:46:32] not just delivering a message. He's
[1:46:33] expressing himself. He says that's his
[1:46:36] purpose. What are we talking about?
[1:46:38] Dynamics.
[1:46:40] Not just setting an order, but starting
[1:46:42] the engine up. That's what he's trying
[1:46:44] to do. What did he say? He says, "Go
[1:46:47] back and pick up what those other fellas
[1:46:48] had left off there. It started and it
[1:46:52] never finished. It started in the days
[1:46:54] of Acts and the book of Acts and the
[1:46:55] days of the apostles." And what
[1:46:57] happened? It fell off into these
[1:46:58] different things. But he says, "Now
[1:46:59] God's coming. He's picked up that
[1:47:01] purpose all over again. And he's going
[1:47:02] to finish what he started."
[1:47:04] He says that's why he died. That's the
[1:47:07] second fold of his three-fold
[1:47:08] manifestation. First to express himself
[1:47:10] in Christ, then express himself through
[1:47:12] the church. And the same thing, Christ
[1:47:15] was the word and the church becomes the
[1:47:17] word when it lets the word go through
[1:47:21] them.
[1:47:23] That word preeminence keeps popping up
[1:47:25] here.
[1:47:27] That word preeminence means having first
[1:47:29] place to be the first in rank or
[1:47:32] influence. In other words, we're coming
[1:47:35] back to the place where God is first and
[1:47:38] everything else is second. Everything
[1:47:40] else is second.
[1:47:42] That's when God's going to have the
[1:47:44] preeminence. If he's everywhere in first
[1:47:48] except in one place, church, that's not
[1:47:49] the preeminence. And so, what are we
[1:47:52] waiting for? We're not just waiting for
[1:47:54] brother Mark to get him in preeminence
[1:47:56] and sister Morina in preeminence and
[1:47:58] sister Justine and Sister Selena. Every
[1:47:59] one of us has to have him in the
[1:48:01] preeminence.
[1:48:02] See, he's waiting on us. That's the only
[1:48:05] thing we to church. That's where our
[1:48:07] will comes in. Will I give him the
[1:48:09] preeminence? Will I let him be first?
[1:48:12] Will I let him be the primary influence
[1:48:14] in my life? Will I let him be the only
[1:48:16] one who's got his hands on the steering
[1:48:18] wheel? That's what God's looking for in
[1:48:20] our life. Amen. That's what God's trying
[1:48:22] to do. That's the place that the bride
[1:48:24] has been placed. Amen. Where God is
[1:48:27] first. And that's when the power flows
[1:48:29] through her. When she'll let the word do
[1:48:31] the work by the spirit. Amen. And that's
[1:48:33] us putting us outside of every other
[1:48:35] influence. Closing our minds to
[1:48:37] everything. I think it was brother
[1:48:38] Garfield and I were talking about when
[1:48:40] life has been brought forth in the womb
[1:48:42] of a woman, it closes itself to
[1:48:43] everything else. And that's what you got
[1:48:45] to do is you got to close yourself to
[1:48:47] everything but the word of God.
[1:48:50] Your self-help books, your psychiatrist,
[1:48:52] the the the ins and outs of this world,
[1:48:54] the social media, everything. It has to
[1:48:57] be closed out. And you've got to say,
[1:48:58] "Lord, it's your word or nothing."
[1:49:01] That's the only thing that can break
[1:49:02] this veil. Amen. I'll read one quote as
[1:49:05] we close. He says, "By one spirit, we're
[1:49:09] all baptized into one body, and that
[1:49:11] body is Christ, which is the royal seed
[1:49:13] of Abraham and heirs to everything
[1:49:15] that's in it." He says, "Amen.
[1:49:16] Everything that was in God, God poured
[1:49:18] into Christ. And everything that was in
[1:49:20] Christ, he poured into the believer."
[1:49:22] Amen. God above us, God with us, God in
[1:49:25] us. He says, "Everything, every promise
[1:49:28] in the book is yours if you can believe
[1:49:29] it." He says, "If you have faith enough
[1:49:32] to accept it and believe it." Amen. God
[1:49:35] bless you. Let's stand this evening.
[1:49:39] Amen. Next service, we're going to pick
[1:49:40] up on this thought of the preeminence
[1:49:42] and see what it means and see what it
[1:49:44] looks like and what it produces because
[1:49:45] it's a beautiful thing.
[1:49:48] It ties to so many things. It ties to
[1:49:50] leadership. It ties to healing. It ties
[1:49:52] to salvation. Ties ties itself to
[1:49:54] deliverance. It ties us to the dynamics
[1:49:57] to knowing what God wants to do with the
[1:49:59] word to speaking in the right time and
[1:50:00] in the right season. So many things come
[1:50:03] back to that idea of God of Christ
[1:50:05] having the preeminence in our life.
[1:50:06] Amen. I'll be honest. I read some of
[1:50:09] these things, church, and I can't
[1:50:10] believe it. And by that I mean I can't
[1:50:13] believe it's for you and I
[1:50:16] cuz I say, "Lord, why me? Why us?"
[1:50:20] It's that elective love that we've
[1:50:21] talked about. Amen. The wonderful things
[1:50:24] that we could be to the glory of his
[1:50:26] praise. Amen. Who first loved us. It's a
[1:50:29] wonderful thing that we have. We are
[1:50:31] privileged to be believers this evening,
[1:50:33] church. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow
[1:50:35] our heads. Lord God, Lord, how wonderful
[1:50:39] it is to read, Lord, that you didn't
[1:50:41] have just a purpose to be above us. You
[1:50:43] didn't just have a purpose to be with
[1:50:45] us, Lord. But the great unfolding of
[1:50:47] your mystery is that you would be in us.
[1:50:50] Lord, your desire, your plan, Lord. Your
[1:50:52] purpose, your mystery was that you could
[1:50:54] live through the lives of believers that
[1:50:56] will take you at your word, Lord, that
[1:50:58] will yield themselves to your spirit.
[1:51:01] Lord, that's my great desire tonight,
[1:51:03] Lord. I believe it's on the the heart's
[1:51:05] cry of each one of us, heavenly father,
[1:51:06] is that you would have the preeminence
[1:51:08] in our lives, Lord, that you would have,
[1:51:10] Lord, your way in our lives, that we
[1:51:12] could run our lives through a filter of
[1:51:14] your will, of of your way, Lord, of your
[1:51:17] time and of your season, Lord. and
[1:51:19] having found it, Lord, that we would
[1:51:20] stay there and we would hold to there,
[1:51:23] Lord. That we would press the mark, that
[1:51:24] we would stay the path, Lord, whatever
[1:51:26] you've called us to do, Lord, by faith,
[1:51:28] we keep pressing until we get the
[1:51:30] victory by your word, through your
[1:51:31] spirit,
[1:51:33] Lord. I pray you take these things,
[1:51:36] Lord. They're deep. They're beyond our
[1:51:38] comprehension, Lord, how this can ever
[1:51:40] happen, Lord. But we've seen that you
[1:51:42] started a work, Lord. How thankful we
[1:51:45] are that you started a work in our
[1:51:46] lives. that you've called us out and
[1:51:48] you've separated us, Lord, but you've
[1:51:50] separated us out for purpose, Lord. And
[1:51:52] that's so that you could reveal yourself
[1:51:54] through us, Lord. Help us, Lord, to be
[1:51:57] available, Lord. Help us to be an
[1:51:59] offering to you day by day, Lord. That
[1:52:01] we could take up that cross daily that
[1:52:03] we could set aside, Lord, the things
[1:52:05] that this flesh would desire, Lord, that
[1:52:07] this world is trying to cram down our
[1:52:08] throats and into our minds, Lord. And
[1:52:10] that we could take on the mind of
[1:52:12] Christ, Lord. that we could surrender
[1:52:13] ourselves to your word and to your will.
[1:52:16] Lord, bless your people, Lord. Those
[1:52:18] that are sick, remembering brother
[1:52:19] Jeremiah especially tonight, Lord,
[1:52:21] praying a special grace for him, brother
[1:52:22] Dale Walsher also. Lord, praying your
[1:52:25] touch on them, each one we pray in Jesus
[1:52:27] Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:52:35] Thank you.
[1:52:39] Oh, yes. before we move too far. So, uh,
[1:52:42] Brother Karma Mills, of course, will be
[1:52:44] here this weekend to preach on Sunday,
[1:52:46] but the Sunday after that will be
[1:52:47] brother Gideon Gunnawan from Edmonton.
[1:52:50] Now, he's got an earlier flight out than
[1:52:52] is usual, so we're going to have church
[1:52:53] at 10:30 on Sunday, October 5th. There
[1:52:58] will be no Sunday school that day. We'll
[1:53:00] just go straight into service that day.
[1:53:02] So, you should still get here the same
[1:53:04] time as you usually do. So, you're good
[1:53:06] and ready for the service to move
[1:53:08] forward that you can get yourself
[1:53:09] settled. Amen. But we'll start service
[1:53:11] at 10:30. The deacon the deacons the
[1:53:14] deacon will send out an email notifying
[1:53:17] us this to each one of us to remind us,
[1:53:20] but we definitely want to have church
[1:53:21] start 10:30 that morning just so that
[1:53:23] brother Gideon's not rushed in the
[1:53:25] service. We don't know how long it would
[1:53:26] take and so that he can easily make his
[1:53:28] flight. I think he's leaving around 3:00
[1:53:30] in the afternoon. So, it could be tight
[1:53:31] if uh if we started at usual time. So,
[1:53:34] amen. remember those those uh services
[1:53:37] in prayer. Remember our travel as well.
[1:53:40] Amen. Let's sing that song.
[1:53:43] Jehovah Gyra my provider. 7:22

[1:55:41] enough.
[1:55:44] You are more
[1:55:47] than
[1:55:49] enough.
[1:55:53] for me.
[1:55:58] Jehovah

[1:56:08] my proer.
[1:56:11] [Music]

[1:56:47] By your stripes
[1:56:52] I've been
[1:56:55] set
[1:56:57] free.
[1:57:02] Jehovah
[1:57:05] Sha,
[1:57:10] you are with
[1:57:14] me.
[1:57:18] Oh, you supply
[1:57:24] all
[1:57:26] my
[1:57:28] needs.
[1:57:34] Oh, you are more
[1:57:38] than
[1:57:40] enough.
[1:57:44] more
[1:57:46] than
[1:57:48] enough.
[1:57:50] You are more
[1:57:54] than
[1:57:55] enough
[1:57:59] for me.
[1:58:03] Power of your love. 797
[1:58:15] Lord, I come to you.
[1:58:20] Let my heart be changed,
[1:58:25] renewed,
[1:58:28] flowing from the grace
[1:58:33] that I found
[1:58:37] in you.
[1:58:46] And Lord, I come to know
[1:58:51] the weaknesses I see
[1:58:57] in me.
[1:58:59] They will be stripped away
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:07] by the power of your love.
[1:59:12] So hold
[1:59:16] me close
[1:59:19] and let your love surround
[1:59:25] me.
[1:59:28] Oh, bring
[1:59:31] me near
[1:59:34] and draw me to your side.
[1:59:44] And as
[1:59:47] I wait,
[1:59:49] I'll rise up like

[2:00:01] Your spirit leads me on
[2:00:05] by the power of your love.
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:12] And Lord, unveil my eyes.
[2:00:17] Let me see you face
[2:00:22] to face
[2:00:24] with the knowledge of your love
[2:00:29] as you live
[2:00:33] in me.
[2:00:35] [Music]
[2:00:42] and Lord renew my mind
[2:00:48] as your will unfolds
[2:00:52] in my life
[2:00:55] in living every day
[2:01:02] in the power of your

[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:52] And I will soar with you.
[2:01:55] Your spirit leads me on
[2:01:59] by the power of your love.
[2:02:06] Lord, unpale my eyes.
[2:02:11] Let me see you face
[2:02:16] to face
[2:02:18] with the knowledge of your love.
[2:02:23] that you live
[2:02:27] in me.
[2:02:37] Glory renew my mind
[2:02:41] as your will unfold
[2:02:46] in my life
[2:02:48] in living every day.
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:56] in the power of your love.
[2:03:02] Hold
[2:03:05] me close
[2:03:08] and let your love surround
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] me.
[2:03:16] Oh, bring
[2:03:19] [Music]
[2:03:20] me near
[2:03:22] and draw me to your side.
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:32] And as
[2:03:35] I wait,
[2:03:38] I'll rise up like eagle
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] and I will soar with you.
[2:03:49] Your spirit leads me on
[2:03:53] in the power of your love.
[2:03:58] So hold
[2:04:02] me close
[2:04:04] and let your love surround
[2:04:10] me.
[2:04:13] Oh, bring
[2:04:17] me near
[2:04:19] and draw me to your side.
[2:04:28] And as
[2:04:32] I wait,
[2:04:34] I'll rise up like eagle
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:42] and I will soar with you.
[2:04:45] Your spirit leads me on
[2:04:49] by the power of your love.
[2:04:54] Amen. Lord, renew my mind.
[2:04:59] Keep your mind set on him.
[2:05:02] That's what we need to do, church.
[2:05:05] Remember the things he said. Keep that
[2:05:07] in the front of our mind when you wake
[2:05:09] up in the morning. Put the word in front
[2:05:11] of you. Get a promise from him. Get a
[2:05:15] vision from him. Amen. Get a prophecy
[2:05:18] from him. Read something about yourself
[2:05:20] and say, "Lord, I want to be that today.
[2:05:22] Lord, help me to be that today. Lord,
[2:05:24] you told me I'm going to be that today.
[2:05:26] Lord, help me to produce it. Amen. And
[2:05:28] then what do you do? Remember we read
[2:05:30] that that that quote last scripture. He
[2:05:32] says, "Stay refreshed in his presence."
[2:05:35] Amen. Say, "Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:37] Thank you, Jesus."
[2:05:40] Show him you're thinking about him. Show
[2:05:42] him you know you're a child of God. And
[2:05:45] you'll be surprised how it'll change
[2:05:46] your day as you're going. Amen. We can't
[2:05:49] be caught up in just what's happening in
[2:05:51] life and work and school and all these
[2:05:53] things. We've got to remember we're
[2:05:54] children of the king. Amen. He's got
[2:05:56] something he wants to do in us every
[2:05:58] day. And if we can keep our mind
[2:06:00] centered on him, amen, he can do
[2:06:02] something so special in each one of us.
[2:06:04] We're going to sing that song as we
[2:06:06] close. My hope 1088. Brother Vichel, I
[2:06:09] ask brother Garfield if he would close
[2:06:10] in prayer tonight. Amen. Again, remember
[2:06:13] brother Joe and I as we travel away.
[2:06:15] Remember the services coming this
[2:06:16] weekend. Amen. Many needs among us, the
[2:06:19] sick, those that aren't here tonight.
[2:06:22] Amen. Just trusting God to move. Amen.
[2:06:24] Let's sing this as Brother Garfield
[2:06:26] comes.
[2:06:28] I stand in awe within the presence of
[2:06:33] the Lord.
[2:06:36] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[2:06:42] lies.
[2:06:45] For whom the raging of the sea
[2:06:50] subides,
[2:06:53] the living sacrifice,
[2:06:57] the only source
[2:07:00] of life,
[2:07:02] my hope
[2:07:05] is in the Lord.
[2:07:09] from this time on
[2:07:14] and ever more.
[2:07:17] Oh my hope
[2:07:22] is in the Lord
[2:07:26] forever more.
[2:07:29] In his tender mercies come with every
[2:07:34] rising sun.
[2:07:38] To meet the sinner in his brokenness
[2:07:46] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:07:54] And those who trust in him
[2:07:58] will find their hearts
[2:08:01] at rest.
[2:08:03] My hope
[2:08:06] is in the Lord
[2:08:10] from this time on
[2:08:14] and ever more.
[2:08:18] Oh, my hope
[2:08:22] is in the Lord
[2:08:26] forever more.
[2:08:30] And his tender mercies come with every
[2:08:35] rising sun
[2:08:38] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[2:08:46] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:08:54] And those who trust, hallelujah, thank
[2:08:57] you, Lord, they'll find their hearts
[2:09:01] at rest.
[2:09:03] My hope
[2:09:06] is in the Lord
[2:09:10] from this time on
[2:09:14] and ever more.
[2:09:17] Oh,
[2:09:19] my hope
[2:09:22] is in the Lord
[2:09:26] forever more.
[2:09:30] My hope
[2:09:34] is in the Lord
[2:09:39] from this time on
[2:09:43] and ever more.
[2:09:49] My hope
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:52] is in the Lord
[2:09:57] forever
[2:09:59] more.
[2:10:01] [Music]
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:14] Praise God.
[2:10:16] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
[2:10:20] Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus.
[2:10:24] Thank you Lord.
[2:10:27] Father, with humble hearts, we come
[2:10:29] before you one more time.
[2:10:32] Lord God, we say thank you, Lord God,
[2:10:34] for your goodness and for your mercies.
[2:10:39] Surely, Lord God, you have been an
[2:10:41] awesome God.
[2:10:43] An awesome God you are tonight, Lord.
[2:10:48] Lord God, you have proven yourself to us
[2:10:51] over and over
[2:10:54] that your love, Lord God, never fail.
[2:10:57] And that Lord, you are the unchanging
[2:11:00] God.
[2:11:02] Lord God, we thank you tonight, Lord
[2:11:04] God, for the call
[2:11:07] and for a heart, Lord God, that we're
[2:11:09] able to respond to that call,
[2:11:13] Lord God, in in in a time such as this,
[2:11:16] Lord, where we see
[2:11:18] the world, Lord God, and nature and all
[2:11:22] that is around us, Lord God, is at the
[2:11:24] brink, oh God, of destruction. And
[2:11:29] Lord God and hearts are seeking for
[2:11:32] refuge for somewhere Lord God of
[2:11:34] assurance and
[2:11:37] we're here Lord God your children Lord
[2:11:39] God have heard your voice and they
[2:11:41] recognize
[2:11:43] the call of God upon our lives Lord.
[2:11:47] Lord God we recognize Lord God that it's
[2:11:50] not because we are good. It's not
[2:11:53] because Lord God we can present any
[2:11:55] works of righteousness Lord
[2:11:59] Lord God but because Lord God Lord you
[2:12:02] had us in your mind predestinated for
[2:12:05] the hour and Lord God we cannot get away
[2:12:08] from it Lord God sometimes we feel so oh
[2:12:12] God drawn back at all these things Lord
[2:12:14] but but in our heart there's something
[2:12:17] calling us Lord the oppressing of a call
[2:12:20] oh God that goes beyond Oh God, oh
[2:12:23] mortal strength, Lord. And and so here
[2:12:26] we are one more time in your presence,
[2:12:28] Lord God, as we lay our hearts before
[2:12:31] you, Lord God. We ask as we invite you
[2:12:33] one more time, Lord, to come,
[2:12:36] Lord God. The greatest that we can ask
[2:12:38] for, Lord God, is is that you may come,
[2:12:41] Lord God, and indwell in our hearts,
[2:12:43] Lord. And and so God, Lord God, we we
[2:12:47] present, Lord God, all that we are to
[2:12:50] you tonight, Lord God, that you will
[2:12:51] come forth, Lord, and and possess our
[2:12:54] reign, that you'll take forth, Lord God.
[2:12:57] And Lord God, Lord, in our weakness,
[2:12:59] Lord God, in our failures, Lord God, and
[2:13:01] all that we are, Lord, may your
[2:13:04] presence, Lord God, bring forth life in
[2:13:06] us, Lord. And and may, oh God, every
[2:13:08] dead works, Lord God, bring, oh God, be
[2:13:11] brought to life, Lord God.
[2:13:14] Lord God, may our bodies, even our
[2:13:16] bodies, oh God, as mortal as it as it is
[2:13:19] unfailing, but may oh God, it be a
[2:13:21] temple, a place, a dwelling place, oh
[2:13:23] Lord God, that they'll bring forth your
[2:13:26] presence, Lord God, in a dying world,
[2:13:29] Lord God, that from the lips of your
[2:13:31] children, Lord God, as we speak your
[2:13:33] word and Lord God, and we speak it
[2:13:35] because, Lord God, there's a confidence
[2:13:37] behind it, Lord God, it it was spoken to
[2:13:40] us, oh God, by a vindicated prophet. And
[2:13:43] we know it is true, Lord. And and so
[2:13:46] every word, Lord God, we accept, Lord.
