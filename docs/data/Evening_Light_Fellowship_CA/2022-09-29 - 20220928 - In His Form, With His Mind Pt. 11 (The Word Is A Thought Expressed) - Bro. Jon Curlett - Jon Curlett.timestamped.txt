[48:10] Lord to reach into our lives Lord to
[48:12] open those doors where maybe we haven't

[48:55] certainly want to welcome back sister
[48:57] Maureen amen glad that the Lord has
[48:58] protected her from from the the house of
[49:03] pestilence over there
[49:06] amen and hopefully I talked to brother
[49:08] Mark and he's certainly doing much
[49:09] better I talked to brother Paul down in
[49:11] the states what a trip you go down for a
[49:13] funeral and you get coveted so anyways
[49:15] he says he is recovering very quickly so
[49:17] we thank the Lord for that happy to see
[49:19] brother Gerald back brother uh David
[49:21] back as well and happy to see our
[49:23] visitors amen from western Canada God
[49:25] bless you both it's good to see you amen
[49:27] I just wanted to give a quick update
[49:29] before we start the the preaching of the
[49:31] word this this evening and of course I
[49:32] shared last week about Brother David
[49:35] Nash the missionary that we've been
[49:36] supporting and uh later that evening on
[49:39] Sunday I believe maybe it was Monday he
[49:41] sent me this picture so they were in
[49:43] Panama and they went up into the
[49:44] mountains to the indigenous people and
[49:46] they preached up there and I shared
[49:47] those pictures last time well he said at
[49:49] the end of the services they had four
[49:51] people that wanted baptism
[49:53] so you know what we sent them about
[49:55] maybe two thousand dollars so it's five
[49:57] hundred dollars or so I'd say we got a
[49:59] pretty good deal right there amen so we
[50:01] praise the Lord for that that's what
[50:02] we're looking for we're looking for that
[50:04] last one to come in
[50:05] so we can get out of here but you see
[50:07] it's it's certainly no special place
[50:09] it's no great Cathedral that's waiting
[50:11] for them no amazing musicians but it's
[50:14] hardcore preaching amen this is where
[50:16] the rubber meets the road and uh anyways
[50:19] he's in there that's him in the in the
[50:20] in the in the far distance there on the
[50:22] the middle left hand side the little
[50:24] short white man there that's Brother
[50:26] David Nash in the middle of a a dirty
[50:28] River in the middle of nowhere baptizing
[50:30] four souls into the Kingdom so we
[50:32] certainly are thankful for that and
[50:33] certainly as we we can moving forward
[50:35] we'll continue to bless him but he
[50:36] wanted to to thank the church for their
[50:38] support and and give an account amen
[50:41] give an account for what he's doing with
[50:42] his time and with his energy over there
[50:43] so we thank the Lord for that amen if we
[50:46] just stand together as we read the word
[50:47] this evening we're going to turn to
[50:49] Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10.
[50:52] a very familiar scripture of course to
[50:54] the believer
[50:55] Romans chapter 10 and verse 8.
[51:03] amen Romans 10 and verse 8 says what but
[51:06] what saith it the word is nigh thee even
[51:09] in thy mouth
[51:10] and in thy heart that is the word of
[51:13] faith which we preach that if Thou shalt
[51:16] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[51:18] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[51:20] God hath raised him from the dead Thou
[51:22] shalt be saved amen this is not just a
[51:24] word of confession but this is something
[51:26] that starts in the heart amen it says in
[51:28] verse 10 for with the heart man
[51:31] believeth unto righteousness and with
[51:33] the mouth confession is made unto
[51:35] salvation for the scripture saith
[51:37] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[51:40] ashamed amen God bless his word you
[51:42] maybe have your seats this evening we
[51:44] want to continue in our our series of in
[51:46] his form and with his mind and we're
[51:48] down to the the last strokes and I know
[51:50] I've said that a couple of times but
[51:51] this is truly it and I want to start
[51:53] what's probably going to be maybe a
[51:55] three-part final portion of this with
[51:57] the the the title of the word is a
[51:59] thought expressed amen and we spoke last
[52:02] time of kind of the overarching theme as
[52:04] we finish this is the idea of a speaking
[52:06] bride amen we've talked about being in
[52:08] the form of God we've talked about
[52:09] taking on the mind of Christ we've
[52:11] talked about the emptying out of the
[52:12] believer and the surrender and letting
[52:15] the Holy Spirit come in and anoint us
[52:16] and use us and we said last service that
[52:19] if you have a voice or if you have a
[52:21] body and if you have a mind of God then
[52:22] you're going to speak like God Amen that
[52:24] if the if the word is inside of you then
[52:26] the word has to come outside of you as
[52:28] well it cannot just stay in there
[52:30] because the word is life and it is
[52:31] spirit and so it's going to have an
[52:33] effect in our lives but when we start
[52:35] talking about the word as a thought
[52:36] expressed and really we go back to a
[52:39] word before we go to the word and I
[52:41] looked up that that that that that word
[52:44] word and and the dictionary says it's a
[52:47] single distinct meaningful element of
[52:50] speech or writing so from a human side
[52:53] from a from a civilization side when we
[52:55] talk about word it's limited to speech
[52:57] and it's limited to what is written down
[52:59] amen but when we look into the word of
[53:01] God we see that word means so much more
[53:03] when we go into the scriptures in John 1
[53:05] 1 and this is a very familiar scripture
[53:07] to us I know it says in the beginning
[53:09] was the word so we are not just talking
[53:11] about a word because we can say a lot of
[53:14] words we can confess a lot of words but
[53:16] what we're interested in now this
[53:17] evening and over these next few services
[53:19] in particular is the word amen and
[53:21] there's a big difference and we'll get
[53:23] into that in a moment but it says in the
[53:24] beginning was the word and the Word was
[53:27] with God and the Word was God the same
[53:30] was in the beginning with God and all
[53:32] things were made by him who the word and
[53:35] without him the word was not anything
[53:38] made that was made amen so it's the word
[53:40] the word the word it starts with the
[53:42] word and it's going to finish with the
[53:44] word we've talked about that we're
[53:45] supposed to be a word bride amen it is
[53:48] Alpha and Omega the start is the same as
[53:50] the finish so it's going to be a word
[53:51] bride that's represented exactly the way
[53:53] that he has it right here amen the word
[53:55] that was in the beginning is the word
[53:57] that's going to be expressed in the end
[53:58] it says in him who the word was life and
[54:02] the word the life was the light of men
[54:05] and the light shineth in darkness and
[54:07] the Darkness comprehended it not that
[54:09] word comprehend doesn't mean it didn't
[54:11] understand it it meant it could not
[54:13] overcome it amen that when the word
[54:15] comes in it brings light and the light
[54:16] cannot overcome that word or the
[54:18] darkness cannot overcome that word amen
[54:21] it cannot overcome the life or the light
[54:22] of that word for what is Darkness
[54:24] Darkness is merely the absence of life
[54:26] we don't have a flash dark we only have
[54:29] a flashlight if you don't turn the light
[54:31] on you have Darkness but as soon as
[54:33] light comes in darkness by definition
[54:34] disappears because it's the opposite of
[54:37] light so if light is there then Darkness
[54:39] can't live and it's the same thing for
[54:40] life if life is there death itself
[54:42] cannot live either I mean it cannot be
[54:44] present and so it says that when the
[54:46] word comes then Darkness goes away and
[54:48] life and light rain in its place then we
[54:50] jump down to verse 14 it says and the
[54:52] Word was made flesh so in the beginning
[54:55] was the word the word was with God the
[54:56] Word was God it created all things and
[54:59] then it says the word was made flesh and
[55:01] dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory
[55:04] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[55:07] father full of grace and truth amen
[55:11] that's a very good attribute to know by
[55:14] whether something is the word or not
[55:16] that it's full of grace and is full of
[55:18] truth because it's the first thing we
[55:19] received was Grace and he followed right
[55:21] up behind it with truth didn't he amen
[55:23] that's what he came to us for with was
[55:25] to set us free and to give us that truth
[55:27] so we walked we to opened with a word
[55:30] but John takes us very quickly to the
[55:31] word and there's a difference because
[55:33] the human mind will limit what that word
[55:35] is but when we look into the scriptures
[55:37] we see that the word is the combined
[55:39] elements or attributes of God that are
[55:42] written that are spoken that are visible
[55:45] that are invisible that are living that
[55:47] are inanimate all of which express the
[55:49] nature and purpose of God
[55:51] so you can look around you that's why
[55:53] brother Brandon would say you don't even
[55:54] have to preach to people all they have
[55:56] to do is look around them and they will
[55:58] see the evidence of God they look up
[56:00] into the sky you go out into the Rocky
[56:02] Mountains sometime and you'll say there
[56:04] is a God Amen you see what happens on
[56:06] the sunshine on the sunsets I take all
[56:08] these pictures you know of of Nature and
[56:10] these sunsets and you look at one of
[56:11] those and you say there has to be a God
[56:13] Amen the beauty of it the the way the
[56:15] world works the way the earth works the
[56:17] way nature works the way that life comes
[56:19] forth all of it express a greater mind
[56:21] than this could ever come by chance amen
[56:23] so that the whole creation speaks that
[56:25] there is something greater than what we
[56:27] see amen and that is the word because
[56:30] before it ever existed the word was and
[56:33] the word will always continue to be even
[56:34] when this is is gone and burnt to ashes
[56:37] amen the prophet of God would say now
[56:39] the first place he's speaking of the
[56:41] scriptures and he says the first place
[56:42] we must realize that this
[56:44] is God's word
[56:46] okay that is our absolute right now
[56:49] amen he says this is the foundation this
[56:51] is the blueprint this is where God lives
[56:54] this is his word and this is God Amen if
[56:58] it disagrees with this then you are not
[57:00] talking to God he is not talking to you
[57:02] he is not inspiring you if you mess with
[57:05] this then God is not a part of it amen
[57:07] he cannot disagree with his word because
[57:09] this is him in written form if you want
[57:11] to know what God is then this is going
[57:13] to tell you I mean this is where we
[57:14] start brother Branham said if you want
[57:16] to get close to God he said read your
[57:18] Bible and pray notice he didn't just say
[57:20] pray because there's many spirits we'll
[57:21] answer you if you pray but if you read
[57:23] your Bible and pray you'll know the
[57:25] spirit that's responding to you amen
[57:26] amen in the beginning was the word and
[57:29] that word was ever before though a Bible
[57:31] existed
[57:32] right before God even existed in a
[57:35] visible form there was the word and
[57:36] that's what he was identified was was
[57:38] the word and then brother Brown talks of
[57:39] that light that he created and God
[57:42] stepped forth into that and he stepped
[57:44] out of what Elohim and he stepped into a
[57:46] body that we call the son of God Amen
[57:49] and it's the same God it's no different
[57:50] amen but so that we could understand it
[57:53] in a human way he called it his son
[57:54] because it was not the self-existing one
[57:57] now it was in a created body something
[57:59] that came out of him and the closest
[58:00] thing we can relate that to as a child
[58:02] so he says this is the Son of God but
[58:04] it's still the same God amen amen
[58:06] there's no difference between the two of
[58:07] them it's not another God it's not a
[58:09] second God it's just God stepping into a
[58:11] form and it was light in the beginning
[58:12] and then in the beginning was that great
[58:14] light that we talked about that God
[58:16] created and stepped into amen but it was
[58:18] an expression of God's power and God's
[58:21] purpose and God's form and God's nature
[58:22] even in that light because his very
[58:24] nature is light it brings what it brings
[58:27] things to light it it opens things up it
[58:29] allows us to see them that's his nature
[58:30] is to let us see things to understand
[58:32] things amen but then we read in verse 14
[58:35] here and John says the word was made
[58:37] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[58:39] it doesn't say a portion of the word it
[58:42] says the word the fullness of God
[58:44] stepped into a body and that body had a
[58:46] name called Jesus Christ and that is the
[58:49] name of God to the believer amen he
[58:51] identified himself in that body as the
[58:53] word and the Word was expressed fully in
[58:56] that body as much as it could ever be in
[58:58] a body amen so we're speaking on this
[59:00] idea of the word is a thought expressed
[59:02] but we don't just want to limit
[59:03] ourselves to this
[59:06] or to what is said to the preaching of
[59:08] the word to the speaking of the word
[59:09] even to the confession of our mouth of
[59:11] the word but we want to recognize that
[59:12] the word is so much greater than all of
[59:14] that amen it cannot contradict itself
[59:16] but God is so much bigger than just that
[59:18] Bible amen then just the words that we
[59:21] say or or the things that we understand
[59:22] he's so much greater we can't even
[59:24] comprehend it amen but he gave us enough
[59:26] here to get us through to the end didn't
[59:28] he
[59:30] May brother Brandon would say this he
[59:31] says if we would think the very Earth
[59:34] that we're living on this morning is the
[59:36] word of God
[59:37] he says that tree is the word of God and
[59:40] you your body is the word of God God
[59:42] spoke it into existence like that made
[59:45] it from nothing which had nothing he
[59:48] made something out of nothing amen and
[59:50] that's not just a literal thing that's a
[59:52] that's a Transfiguration amen he made
[59:54] something out of nothing in my life but
[59:56] he says you are the word you're the very
[59:58] fact that you exist the very fact that
[1:00:00] you have a functioning body is the word
[1:00:02] and it's an expression he says of God's
[1:00:04] nature and God's purpose
[1:00:06] the trees the Earth the Rocks everything
[1:00:08] of nature it all declares the word
[1:00:10] because it's one big picture of what and
[1:00:12] who God is amen but it extends all the
[1:00:15] way to us it better extend to us amen we
[1:00:18] can't leave the word as just an external
[1:00:20] thing where we go and we say well this
[1:00:22] is only the word no the word is here too
[1:00:25] the word of God is neither even in thy
[1:00:27] mouth we are the Temple of the Living
[1:00:28] God Amen the word has to become
[1:00:31] something that we identify with
[1:00:33] right not just by belief but as
[1:00:35] experience amen that something inside of
[1:00:37] us says I'm the same thing as what I'm
[1:00:39] reading as what I'm looking at that the
[1:00:41] god that is out there is now inside me
[1:00:43] and he's having a purpose and a plan in
[1:00:45] my life and he's doing things through me
[1:00:47] amen talking about it is good we want to
[1:00:49] talk about the word we want to say the
[1:00:51] word amen it's better than not talking
[1:00:53] about it that's for sure amen but it has
[1:00:55] to go beyond that amen and we have to
[1:00:57] catch as we've been preaching on so much
[1:00:59] in this we have to catch the inspiration
[1:01:01] of God to know how to use that word to
[1:01:03] know how it's applied yeah amen Peter
[1:01:06] talks about this now Peter was a simple
[1:01:08] man
[1:01:09] Peter wasn't a well-trained
[1:01:11] well-educated man like Paul was
[1:01:13] but yet you show me a man that have more
[1:01:15] power than Peter amen it didn't keep him
[1:01:18] his Simplicity did not heat him keep him
[1:01:20] from the power and authority of the
[1:01:21] believer in his life of the power of the
[1:01:23] holy spirit in his life it meant great
[1:01:25] signs and wonders follow Peter wherever
[1:01:26] he went to the point where as he crossed
[1:01:28] people they would stand or sit in his
[1:01:30] shadow and they would be healed by it
[1:01:32] amen so we're not getting out of here
[1:01:34] because we have an understanding of the
[1:01:36] word amen that's not what's going to get
[1:01:37] us out of here we want to understand it
[1:01:40] but we want to understand in the context
[1:01:41] of what it's supposed to do in our lives
[1:01:43] and what God wants us to do with it just
[1:01:45] having an understanding of the doctrines
[1:01:47] of this message that have been revealed
[1:01:49] to us the Loose Ends that have been tied
[1:01:51] up that's not what's going to take us
[1:01:52] out that's right
[1:01:53] because the letter killeth
[1:01:55] and in the end doctrines are only letter
[1:01:57] but it's a spirit that giveth life amen
[1:01:59] and that's what we're talking about if
[1:02:00] he's got a body it's got to have a life
[1:02:02] and that life better be the Holy Spirit
[1:02:04] but Peter's talking about Paul because
[1:02:07] he struggled with Paul Peter had
[1:02:09] struggled to capture the things that
[1:02:11] Paul was talking about he says an
[1:02:13] account that the long-suffering of Our
[1:02:15] Lord is salvation even as our beloved
[1:02:17] brother Paul also according to the
[1:02:19] wisdom given unto him hath written unto
[1:02:22] you
[1:02:22] as also in all his Epistles speaking in
[1:02:25] them of these things he says in which
[1:02:27] are some things hard to be understood
[1:02:30] listen we're not all going to grasp the
[1:02:32] great mysteries of this message I don't
[1:02:34] believe in terms of the the
[1:02:35] understanding and the the mental
[1:02:37] manipulations that maybe have to happen
[1:02:39] in the the deeper things of God we don't
[1:02:41] all have to understand that Hattie
[1:02:43] Wright never understood the Seven Seals
[1:02:45] but yes she got what she asked for amen
[1:02:48] we're not going in just on understanding
[1:02:50] of Doctrine and Peter says there's some
[1:02:53] things that Paul talks about they're
[1:02:54] hard to understand now Watch What
[1:02:57] Happens though people take things that
[1:02:58] are hard to understand he says which
[1:03:00] they that are unlearned and unstable
[1:03:03] rest not rest as in are at peace but
[1:03:07] rest which means they forcibly pull it
[1:03:09] or manipulate it they try and make it
[1:03:11] work
[1:03:12] he says they're alarming and I'm stable
[1:03:14] they rest it as they do also the other
[1:03:17] scriptures
[1:03:18] it's all of it they're struggling to
[1:03:21] make happen it's all of it they're
[1:03:22] struggling to get to work the way they
[1:03:23] think it's supposed to and it says what
[1:03:25] it leads them onto their own destruction
[1:03:28] amen so you cannot get there by your own
[1:03:31] work you cannot get there by your own
[1:03:33] understanding amen Peter though A Simple
[1:03:36] Man knew what this meant and he knew
[1:03:37] what the power of God was and he knew
[1:03:39] what God wanted done with his word amen
[1:03:41] amen amen but he says people are getting
[1:03:42] caught up in these doctrines these
[1:03:44] things that Paul's talking about and
[1:03:46] they're trying to make it do what they
[1:03:47] think it should do
[1:03:49] and what happens he says it leads to
[1:03:51] their own destruction it leads to their
[1:03:54] downfall and I think that's what we've
[1:03:55] seen around the message so often is
[1:03:57] people have gotten so tight and and so
[1:03:59] deep into things and they've forgotten
[1:04:01] that it's only God that can give you
[1:04:02] Revelation and they get to the point
[1:04:04] where they get so so twisted up and they
[1:04:06] lead others astray and they lead
[1:04:08] themselves astray and all of a sudden
[1:04:09] you're wondering what happened to them
[1:04:11] what is it they tried to rest it they
[1:04:13] tried to manipulate they tried to
[1:04:14] wrestle it that's where the word wrestle
[1:04:16] comes from rest
[1:04:17] to try and force it into something that
[1:04:20] will work for them and it's not going to
[1:04:21] do it that way right it reminds me of
[1:04:23] the seven sons of Siva they said they
[1:04:25] tried to cast out demons by Jesus whom
[1:04:27] Paul preaches
[1:04:29] right you can't go up to Things based on
[1:04:31] the god that brother John or brother
[1:04:33] Gerald preaches or any other minister
[1:04:34] you got to be in contact with that God
[1:04:36] yourself amen otherwise what's it going
[1:04:38] to do it's going to kick you out amen
[1:04:40] it's going to overcome you because
[1:04:41] you're relying on something other than
[1:04:43] the spirit that is within you to
[1:04:45] overcome it amen
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:48] what's the problem they don't have the
[1:04:50] mind of Christ
[1:04:52] right there they're wolves among sheep
[1:04:54] they're coming in to try and make
[1:04:55] something happen to try and prove
[1:04:57] themselves to try and get the benefit of
[1:04:59] the word without the surrender and the
[1:05:00] relationship that must follow amen it's
[1:05:02] got to be there and we'll get into that
[1:05:04] maybe in the next series we're going to
[1:05:06] go into amen are they sincere
[1:05:08] many are I believe they are sincere
[1:05:12] sincerity is not the that's not our goal
[1:05:15] though
[1:05:16] our goal is inspiration and Revelation
[1:05:18] amen because how many people are
[1:05:20] sincerely wrong today not just you know
[1:05:23] around maybe the circles of the message
[1:05:25] but but also in the world I mean they're
[1:05:27] sincerely wrong they think they're doing
[1:05:29] the right thing and they're doing the
[1:05:30] exact opposite thing amen the goal is to
[1:05:33] have truth not just a sincere opinion
[1:05:36] and man I've got lots of opinions and
[1:05:38] guess what they'll get me
[1:05:40] if I had them in 100 bucks I'd have 100
[1:05:42] bucks
[1:05:43] that's what they're worth it's just an
[1:05:44] opinion this is a sincere opinion is not
[1:05:47] worth any more than an unsincere one is
[1:05:49] if it's wrong amen so we're seeking
[1:05:51] after truth and we we spoke about this
[1:05:53] in the last service where truth is what
[1:05:55] truth is the will of God for your life
[1:05:57] and your circumstances I don't need to
[1:06:00] know what it is for Ellie's life I need
[1:06:02] to know what it is for mine and for my
[1:06:03] family and those that are under my
[1:06:05] authority amen you need to know it for
[1:06:07] yours and I need to know it for mine
[1:06:09] amen the problem is is that what we
[1:06:12] found is that it's a world of ideology
[1:06:13] not a world of an absolute because what
[1:06:15] we have is an absolute and the thing
[1:06:17] that ideology is is it's a theory that's
[1:06:19] unproven
[1:06:21] right and it sounds great but the minute
[1:06:23] it starts to impact Our Lives all of a
[1:06:25] sudden we say well maybe I don't quite
[1:06:27] believe it that same way haven't we seen
[1:06:29] it with climate change and all all of
[1:06:30] the the expenses and the taxes that come
[1:06:33] with it and everybody wants to save the
[1:06:35] world save the world and we're going to
[1:06:36] die and we're going to die and then they
[1:06:37] spend third I have to spend 30 cents
[1:06:39] more on a liter of gasoline all of a
[1:06:41] sudden they say you know what I'm not
[1:06:42] too worried about the climate now
[1:06:44] because this is uncomfortable for me
[1:06:46] but when you're looking at an absolute
[1:06:48] if it brings you into something
[1:06:50] uncomfortable you say well this is the
[1:06:51] way it's got to go because this is
[1:06:53] proven this is truth this is life to me
[1:06:55] so I'll go the way of the of the hard
[1:06:58] few that are chosen amen and I'll stick
[1:07:00] with it no matter what happens we want
[1:07:03] to know the truth we read the scripture
[1:07:05] last service that said that we know all
[1:07:07] things
[1:07:08] and we saw how that meant that we know
[1:07:10] what we need to know for our lives we
[1:07:12] don't know everything I don't know
[1:07:13] everything for you and you don't know
[1:07:14] everything for me and I don't know
[1:07:15] everything there is to know but God has
[1:07:17] given us the holy spirit so that we know
[1:07:19] what to do and how to handle things in
[1:07:21] our life and to know what he wants done
[1:07:23] with his word more importantly if I
[1:07:24] could put it that way listen we're all
[1:07:26] bold when the crowd is behind us we're
[1:07:28] all bold when we're sitting in front of
[1:07:30] our phone or typing on our computer but
[1:07:32] the minute it steps into our life how
[1:07:33] many of us will stick with what we
[1:07:35] believe
[1:07:36] if you've got an absolute you're going
[1:07:37] to stick with it won't you if you've got
[1:07:39] an absolute if that is the only thing
[1:07:41] that you hold true you're going to stick
[1:07:42] with it but if it's an ideology what
[1:07:44] happens as soon as the trial or the pain
[1:07:46] comes then you bend and you let it Flex
[1:07:48] right it twists it allows you to get out
[1:07:51] of that that impact that it's having on
[1:07:53] your life right the truth doesn't change
[1:07:55] and an absolute does not change
[1:07:57] an absolute can only be the truth
[1:08:00] because truth doesn't change and it
[1:08:02] absolute never changes either if you're
[1:08:03] in quality control they always have an
[1:08:05] absolute they always have a fixture they
[1:08:07] always have something that's perfect as
[1:08:09] perfect as you can get they have
[1:08:11] something that is the the measuring
[1:08:13] stick they have something that is the
[1:08:15] perfect implementation or production
[1:08:16] that you're looking for and they compare
[1:08:18] everything to that
[1:08:20] that's what the absolute is that's what
[1:08:21] we're comparing to is the thing that
[1:08:23] doesn't change the thing that is perfect
[1:08:24] and for us that is the word of God Amen
[1:08:27] listen to what the prophet of God said
[1:08:29] this this quote
[1:08:31] it made me stand up
[1:08:33] he says now that's the reason where the
[1:08:35] church is in the condition it is tonight
[1:08:36] it's been man LED and not spirit-led
[1:08:40] he's talking about the nominal church I
[1:08:42] believe Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:08:44] led by the spirit of God the spirit of
[1:08:47] God is to lead the church he says now
[1:08:49] man might say anything but the holy
[1:08:52] spirit will tell the truth on you
[1:08:55] I like how he says he'll tell the truth
[1:08:57] on you not just to you he won't just
[1:09:00] give you the truth but he'll say
[1:09:01] Jonathan you're lacking in an area
[1:09:05] you're not Towing the line today
[1:09:07] you're slacking off a bit you need to
[1:09:10] move this out of your life you need to
[1:09:12] step up to a higher plane you've got a
[1:09:14] problem you've got an addiction you're
[1:09:17] tied down with this you need to break
[1:09:18] off here he'll tell the truth on you why
[1:09:21] because you're a child of his that's why
[1:09:24] he'll do it because the child is the
[1:09:25] only one that's chastised by the father
[1:09:27] amen the holy spirit will tell the truth
[1:09:29] on you he won't let you get away with
[1:09:31] thinking that you're okay when you're
[1:09:33] not
[1:09:34] I mean that's how you know when you're
[1:09:35] sitting on the truth is that it doesn't
[1:09:37] leave you where you are amen it's always
[1:09:39] moving you forward it's always taking
[1:09:41] you away from the world and closer to
[1:09:43] the word of God every single time amen
[1:09:45] that's life to us
[1:09:47] listen if we go out of a service and we
[1:09:49] say that didn't impact me then we've got
[1:09:51] a problem
[1:09:52] because he never leaves us in the same
[1:09:54] place brother Brown said if you're
[1:09:56] you're never standing still you're
[1:09:57] either going forward or you're
[1:09:59] backsliding there is no standing still
[1:10:01] so if you come out of a service you come
[1:10:03] out of a day and you say I didn't go
[1:10:04] forward and I didn't go backward then
[1:10:06] you're lying to yourself amen you got to
[1:10:08] go see whether you actually made up some
[1:10:09] ground or whether you lost some ground
[1:10:11] for that day amen
[1:10:14] John 6 63 says it is the spirit that
[1:10:17] quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing
[1:10:19] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:10:22] spirit and they are life amen this has
[1:10:25] to be life to us this word has to be
[1:10:27] life to us it's not just something
[1:10:29] that's outside of us but it's a life
[1:10:30] that's inside of us amen and it's
[1:10:32] pushing out it's pressing out it's
[1:10:34] flowing out like that Fountain of Life
[1:10:35] that we sing about amen we're still
[1:10:38] talking about a speaking bride in all of
[1:10:39] this and we hear that phrase speak the
[1:10:41] word and so often it's a rallying cry
[1:10:43] for believers you go to special meetings
[1:10:45] and they're they're saying Speak the
[1:10:47] word speak the word and we ought to
[1:10:48] speak the word amen but you will find
[1:10:51] that what we believe speaking the word
[1:10:52] is and what it actually is are usually
[1:10:54] two very different things amen amen and
[1:10:57] we'll get into that over the next couple
[1:10:58] of services but the problem is is that
[1:11:00] we speak the word and then it doesn't
[1:11:02] happen and we're disappointed or we're
[1:11:03] frustrated or we're hurt or we're
[1:11:05] offended or we're left wondering and
[1:11:07] we're down-hearted because it's supposed
[1:11:09] to come to pass we say I spoke the word
[1:11:11] I spoke the word and nothing happened
[1:11:14] but as we look at what that's going to
[1:11:16] mean we understand that the word is the
[1:11:19] expression of the thoughts and purpose
[1:11:21] of God
[1:11:22] it doesn't mean just say what the Bible
[1:11:24] says as we read last service sorry
[1:11:26] brother Bram says the bride knows what
[1:11:28] to do with the word right it's not just
[1:11:30] blindly repeating quotes and repeating
[1:11:33] scriptures as if that's suddenly going
[1:11:34] to do it but you've got to catch the
[1:11:36] mind of God and the will and purpose of
[1:11:37] God in your life so that when you speak
[1:11:40] the word you're not speaking just the
[1:11:42] word but you're catching the mind and
[1:11:44] the thought of God for the situation and
[1:11:46] that's what speaking the word is is that
[1:11:48] you're speaking his words that he's
[1:11:49] given you not just the random selection
[1:11:51] of words that you picked out of the
[1:11:52] Bible that morning
[1:11:54] amen does that make sense we want to
[1:11:56] speak it with inspiration which comes by
[1:11:58] Revelation which gives us faith that
[1:12:00] produces what we speak in the first
[1:12:01] place amen because it's from him it's
[1:12:03] not ours it's not our mind it's not us
[1:12:06] choosing to to step away from pain or
[1:12:08] discomfort but it's us saying Lord what
[1:12:10] do you want for me in this situation and
[1:12:12] you'll stay there as long as he wants
[1:12:13] you to stay there and then when it's
[1:12:15] time to be done with it guess what
[1:12:16] you'll speak the word and it'll move
[1:12:18] amen but we've got to be willing to stay
[1:12:20] the course until he gives us the
[1:12:22] inspiration to move on from it
[1:12:23] we open with the scripture last service
[1:12:25] in the service before in second
[1:12:27] Corinthians it says we having the same
[1:12:29] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[1:12:31] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:12:33] spoken we also believe and therefore
[1:12:36] speak and I want to point out three
[1:12:38] things here that this requires one thing
[1:12:40] a spirit and it requires a spirit of
[1:12:43] Faith amen and that can only be the Holy
[1:12:45] Spirit when it comes to the word of God
[1:12:47] Amen you have to have a spirit of Faith
[1:12:49] which is the holy spirit we have to
[1:12:51] believe
[1:12:52] what he says and we have to speak what
[1:12:55] he says amen amen and then you have to
[1:12:56] have the right Spirit you have to
[1:12:58] believe what the spirit gives to you and
[1:12:59] you have to speak what the spirit gives
[1:13:01] to you and there are different levels of
[1:13:03] this and there's different applications
[1:13:04] of it and I want to start with the most
[1:13:06] basic of that and that is to recognize
[1:13:08] the word in the first place if I could
[1:13:10] put it that way amen
[1:13:12] so in mark one it says there came a
[1:13:15] leper to him Jesus beseeching him and
[1:13:18] kneeling down to him and saying unto him
[1:13:19] if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
[1:13:23] and Jesus moved with compassion put
[1:13:26] forth his hand and touched him and saith
[1:13:28] unto him I will be thou clean
[1:13:32] and as soon as he had spoken immediately
[1:13:35] the leprosy departed from him and he was
[1:13:38] cleansed
[1:13:40] now I want to ask you something was that
[1:13:42] leper full of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:45] no the Holy Spirit wasn't yet given was
[1:13:47] it was that leper a sinner
[1:13:51] in our probability yes he was a Jew but
[1:13:55] yet nonethelessly sinner amen was that
[1:13:58] leper you know a key member of his
[1:14:00] church
[1:14:02] not as far as they know he would have
[1:14:03] been an outcast from everybody amen this
[1:14:06] is a nobody that has nothing to offer
[1:14:09] and then he doesn't come to Jesus on the
[1:14:11] basis of who he is
[1:14:14] all he says is if you want to you can
[1:14:17] heal me
[1:14:19] so he's coming to Jesus not on the basis
[1:14:21] of who the leper is but he's coming on
[1:14:23] the basis of who he believes Jesus is
[1:14:25] why because he's read his Bible he
[1:14:27] remembers from when he's a boy when
[1:14:29] they're used to preach Psalms 103 and
[1:14:31] they would say bless the Lord who
[1:14:33] healeth all thy diseases and when he
[1:14:36] recognizes the Lord has come when the
[1:14:38] word is in his presence then he says
[1:14:40] that means that healing has to be
[1:14:41] available to me amen that he will
[1:14:44] remember Moses words in Exodus 15 that
[1:14:46] said I am the Lord that healeth thee
[1:14:49] amen and he saw the Lord standing before
[1:14:51] him he recognized the word made flesh
[1:14:54] and he says if that's the word made
[1:14:56] flesh if that is truly the Son of God
[1:14:58] then that means healing has to be
[1:14:59] available amen and all I've got to do is
[1:15:01] go up and ask him amen he's not sitting
[1:15:04] there saying I'm a great person I'm a
[1:15:07] faithful believer I've served you all my
[1:15:09] life and my family's in order and no no
[1:15:11] no he says if you want to you can heal
[1:15:14] me amen you can make me clean he doesn't
[1:15:17] have a big discussion about how hurt
[1:15:19] he's been and how her life has been
[1:15:21] because God has not moved by our
[1:15:23] emotions but he's moved by faith and
[1:15:25] revelation of who and what he is amen
[1:15:27] and that's the basis that this leper
[1:15:29] comes to him amen a sinful man nothing
[1:15:32] special comes to him and says if you
[1:15:34] want to you can heal me amen
[1:15:37] and what did Jesus say
[1:15:38] I will
[1:15:40] I want to heal you
[1:15:43] and he says what be thou clean and
[1:15:45] immediately immediately the leprosy left
[1:15:48] him amen
[1:15:50] so often as believers
[1:15:52] we come to him and what are we doing
[1:15:54] we're coming to him on the basis of Who
[1:15:56] We Are
[1:15:57] and we ought to I'm not saying that's
[1:16:00] wrong but we're at the most basic level
[1:16:01] of speaking the word here and what we're
[1:16:03] really saying is we've got to recognize
[1:16:05] the word before we can ever understand
[1:16:07] who we are we've got to understand who
[1:16:09] and what he is and what he came to do
[1:16:11] and what he's able to do in our lives
[1:16:13] amen and this leper is purely coming on
[1:16:15] the basis of who Jesus is and he's
[1:16:17] saying God you can do it
[1:16:19] you can do it if you want to do it you
[1:16:21] can do it and Jesus said I'll do it I
[1:16:24] want to do it I'm going to do it amen so
[1:16:26] often we're sitting there and we're
[1:16:27] saying and we're relying on who we are
[1:16:30] rather than saying Lord
[1:16:31] this is a work of Grace
[1:16:33] and I'm not coming because I'm worthy
[1:16:36] but I'm coming because you made me
[1:16:38] worthy to approach amen you said that I
[1:16:41] am your child you said I can come but
[1:16:43] regardless just on the basis of your
[1:16:45] nature of who you are you're able to
[1:16:48] meet this need no matter what condition
[1:16:50] I am no matter how high I am no matter
[1:16:52] how Fallen I am no matter what my life
[1:16:54] looks like right now Lord in your
[1:16:56] Sovereign mercy and Grace you can do the
[1:16:59] work in my life whatever I have need of
[1:17:01] Lord you can do it because of who you
[1:17:03] are
[1:17:04] amen it's the most basic thing to say
[1:17:07] Lord this is about you anyways amen we
[1:17:10] come to him because of who he is and
[1:17:12] then he tells us who and what we are
[1:17:13] then he tells us what the benefits are
[1:17:15] he gives us the good things of God but
[1:17:17] we approach him on the basis of him
[1:17:19] calling to us of who he is and letting
[1:17:22] us know what he wants to do in our lives
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:26] Matthew 7 7 says ask
[1:17:29] and it shall be given you
[1:17:31] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:17:35] shall be opened unto you listen the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost hasn't been given yet and he's
[1:17:38] still the same ask
[1:17:41] you have not because you ask not
[1:17:43] ask why because the one that will answer
[1:17:46] is here if you'll only recognize it we
[1:17:50] don't ever heal a priests being healed
[1:17:51] back then you know why because they
[1:17:53] didn't believe who he was
[1:17:54] you're telling me no priest back then
[1:17:56] had children that needed diseases healed
[1:17:58] that there were no infirmities amongst
[1:18:00] the Priestly ranks at that time of
[1:18:01] course they were but because they
[1:18:03] couldn't recognize the word they
[1:18:04] couldn't get the benefits of the word
[1:18:06] and yet we have people walking up
[1:18:07] nobodies absolute nobodies
[1:18:11] and they come up to him and they say
[1:18:12] Lord I recognize who you are will you
[1:18:14] give me the attributes that you are
[1:18:16] that's all they're asking him to do is
[1:18:18] display his attributes
[1:18:20] Amen to fulfill the word if the word is
[1:18:22] present they're saying then Lord would
[1:18:24] you give me that portion of the word
[1:18:25] that you promised would be here
[1:18:27] verse 8 says for everyone that asketh
[1:18:29] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:18:32] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:18:34] opened for what man is there of you whom
[1:18:36] if his son has spread will he give him a
[1:18:38] stone
[1:18:39] or if you ask a fish will he give him a
[1:18:41] serpent if ye then being evil know how
[1:18:44] to give good gifts unto your children
[1:18:46] how much more shall your father which is
[1:18:48] in heaven good good give good things to
[1:18:51] them that ask him
[1:18:53] Jesus healed a leper that had enough
[1:18:55] courage and Faith to come up and ask him
[1:18:58] and that's all it took that's all it
[1:19:00] took to ask him
[1:19:02] to say Lord I recognize who you are will
[1:19:06] you touch me and he says I will be thou
[1:19:08] clean amen
[1:19:10] then Jesus comes back and he says listen
[1:19:13] how do you treat your children when they
[1:19:14] come to ask you for something if you
[1:19:16] have the means to supply what they're
[1:19:18] asking for how many of you hold back
[1:19:21] that's where a fish do you give him a
[1:19:22] serpent if they're hungry for bread do
[1:19:24] you give them a rock no none of us do we
[1:19:26] give them whatever we have that can meet
[1:19:28] the need and he says look if you doing
[1:19:30] that being evil in your base nature he
[1:19:32] says how much more a God who is good a
[1:19:34] God who is great A God who is who is
[1:19:36] merciful a God who is gracious how much
[1:19:38] more is he going to do that and give the
[1:19:40] good things to those that ask him amen
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] later on in John 16 he says hitherto
[1:19:46] have you asked nothing in my name
[1:19:48] in my name now he's saying there's a
[1:19:51] difference he says ask and you shall
[1:19:53] receive that your joy may be half full
[1:20:00] sometimes we stop at the halfway mark
[1:20:03] promise is not halfway the promise is
[1:20:06] not enough joy to just get you out of
[1:20:07] your bed in the morning the promise is
[1:20:09] not just to get you through your day it
[1:20:11] says that your joy may be full
[1:20:14] amen if it's not full it's not because
[1:20:16] he won't do it it's because you're not
[1:20:17] asking
[1:20:18] that you're not staying there that
[1:20:20] you're not trusting enough for him to
[1:20:21] give you the fullness that he promised
[1:20:23] of your joy amen
[1:20:26] but half full not part way he can do the
[1:20:28] full thing he can give you the full meal
[1:20:30] deal
[1:20:30] if you'll ask him amen
[1:20:32] I want to jump to a second story and I
[1:20:34] love this because it shows the
[1:20:35] Simplicity of faith brother Brandon
[1:20:38] would talk about this story so many
[1:20:39] times and it's in mark five it says
[1:20:41] behold there came one of the rulers of
[1:20:43] the synagogue Jairus by name and when he
[1:20:45] saw him he fell at his feet and besought
[1:20:48] him greatly saying my little daughter
[1:20:50] lieth at the point of death I pray thee
[1:20:52] come and lay thy hands on her that she
[1:20:54] may be healed and she shall live
[1:20:57] and Jesus went with him and much people
[1:21:00] followed him and thronged him
[1:21:01] now this is not we're not talking about
[1:21:03] Jairus now but I want you to catch
[1:21:05] something because brother Aaron Oglesby
[1:21:07] when he was here in in the summer he
[1:21:08] talked to me about this and he pointed
[1:21:10] out that Jesus is headed to Jairus house
[1:21:13] okay Jesus is on a mission Jesus is on
[1:21:15] the road he's moving he's not standing
[1:21:17] around he's not looking to do a prayer
[1:21:18] line he's not looking to to sit and have
[1:21:20] a conversation with everybody but he's
[1:21:23] looking to go to Jairus house to heal
[1:21:25] his daughter okay he's got a purpose
[1:21:27] he's got a plan he's on the Move amen
[1:21:29] he's striding down the road and as he's
[1:21:31] going there a crowd
[1:21:33] surrounds him
[1:21:35] but it jumped out of me as Aaron was
[1:21:37] talking to me about these things because
[1:21:39] it's so often the way it is with us is
[1:21:41] that we look around the service or we
[1:21:43] look at the needs in here and we're
[1:21:44] focused on you know brother so-and-so or
[1:21:47] sister so-and-so has a great need and so
[1:21:49] we're putting everything into there and
[1:21:50] we say that is the need for the service
[1:21:53] that is the need for the day that is the
[1:21:55] name we're going to focus on and we
[1:21:57] leave it at that
[1:21:58] amen so-and-so needs to be saved
[1:22:00] so-and-so needs to be filled with the
[1:22:01] Holy Ghost we need healing we need this
[1:22:03] we need that and we put everything into
[1:22:05] them we say and as soon as anything
[1:22:07] starts to happen in the service we say
[1:22:09] well that's for them
[1:22:10] and that's all we do is we focus on them
[1:22:14] that's not the way it has to be amen
[1:22:16] God's not limited to just the one great
[1:22:18] need in our congregation amen he's not
[1:22:21] limited just because one person has such
[1:22:23] a a great desire for him but this is
[1:22:25] something that all of us can tap into
[1:22:27] amen that he's here for every single one
[1:22:29] that's here amen it doesn't matter how
[1:22:30] big or small it is in comparison to the
[1:22:33] need that maybe you're thinking about
[1:22:34] you know we think so and so needs a real
[1:22:36] experience so they need to repent or
[1:22:38] they need to get baptized and that's
[1:22:39] greater than my need listen there is no
[1:22:42] big or small need
[1:22:43] right if you're his child then your
[1:22:45] needs matter to you I remember my wife
[1:22:47] was talking to me about this in the past
[1:22:49] week and she said when I was so young
[1:22:51] even before a teenager I would talk to
[1:22:53] God and I would ask him for little
[1:22:54] things and he would give them to me
[1:22:56] every time
[1:22:58] it doesn't matter the greatness or the
[1:22:59] smallness of it if it matters to you and
[1:23:02] you're sincere I believe it matters to
[1:23:03] him as well amen so don't limit him and
[1:23:07] don't limit yourself when he's in there
[1:23:08] when he's in your presence amen when
[1:23:10] you're around him when you know that
[1:23:11] he's in the building when you know that
[1:23:13] he's in the room don't just say well
[1:23:14] that's for somebody else let it be for
[1:23:16] you too because what what Watch What
[1:23:18] Happens here because of the people
[1:23:19] throwing around actually listen to this
[1:23:22] before we go there Luke 12. amen it says
[1:23:24] there are not five sparrows sold for two
[1:23:26] farthings and not one of them is
[1:23:27] forgotten before God the little tiny
[1:23:30] birds sparrows don't matter much in the
[1:23:32] world there's a bazillion of them you
[1:23:34] could kill a million today and it
[1:23:36] wouldn't even make a dent on the
[1:23:37] population they're everywhere he says
[1:23:39] every one of them
[1:23:40] won't be forgotten he says but even the
[1:23:43] very hairs of your head are all numbered
[1:23:45] now for some of us that's not many
[1:23:48] but he says no matter what all the hairs
[1:23:50] of your head are numbered
[1:23:52] right fear not there for ye are more
[1:23:55] value than many sparrows I mean don't be
[1:23:57] afraid to call on his name amen and
[1:24:00] don't stop because somebody else you
[1:24:01] feel has a greater need than you do amen
[1:24:03] don't ever let somebody's need stop you
[1:24:05] from approaching the Throne of God
[1:24:07] don't ever let them don't ever let that
[1:24:10] somehow overwhelm you to the point where
[1:24:11] you leave your needs unspoken when he's
[1:24:13] in the building and he's doing great
[1:24:14] things among us amen moral a part of his
[1:24:16] bride it's not just their moments It's
[1:24:18] Our Moment amen it's for all who will
[1:24:20] come it's all who are here he doesn't
[1:24:22] come in the building just for the one
[1:24:23] but he comes in for every single one
[1:24:25] that has a need
[1:24:26] but look what happens now he's on his
[1:24:28] road to Jairus house to heal his
[1:24:30] daughter and listen it says that a
[1:24:33] certain woman which had an issue of
[1:24:35] blood 12 years
[1:24:37] now listen she's had it 12 years she
[1:24:38] could have gone 12 years in a day you'd
[1:24:40] think right because he's on his way to
[1:24:42] heal a girl that's about to die that's a
[1:24:44] little more important maybe we would say
[1:24:46] near death is probably more important
[1:24:48] than a condition that hasn't killed her
[1:24:49] yet
[1:24:50] but yet she has no problem approaching
[1:24:53] Jesus it says she had suffered many
[1:24:55] things of many Physicians and had spent
[1:24:58] all that she had and was nothing
[1:24:59] bettered but rather grew worse
[1:25:03] now we're talking about her but let me
[1:25:05] take it to your life because there's
[1:25:06] many of us are dealing with things and
[1:25:08] we've had situations in our life and
[1:25:10] we've suffered many things and we
[1:25:12] continue to suffer many things despite
[1:25:14] many people trying to help us amen
[1:25:16] despite being to many doctors being
[1:25:18] under many Ministries going to many
[1:25:19] churches we've had 17 ministers pray for
[1:25:22] us we've tried books we've tried diets
[1:25:24] we've tried programs we've tried this
[1:25:26] we've tried that and nothing has helped
[1:25:28] us and in fact maybe we're worse than we
[1:25:30] started out
[1:25:33] does that stop her from approaching
[1:25:35] Jesus
[1:25:37] sometimes the problem is that we've been
[1:25:39] through it all and we haven't been to
[1:25:40] him yet
[1:25:41] we've been through every mediator we can
[1:25:43] think of we've been through every access
[1:25:45] point we can think of but it's always
[1:25:47] been through somebody rather than
[1:25:48] directly to him
[1:25:50] amen you've done everything you can you
[1:25:53] put your faith and trust in so many
[1:25:54] things and you've said none of it has
[1:25:56] worked and I'm worse than when I started
[1:25:58] I'm hoped it's hopeless there's no point
[1:26:00] to me even looking for it believing for
[1:26:02] it I've done everything I can and
[1:26:04] nothing's happened
[1:26:06] that's this woman
[1:26:10] verse 27.
[1:26:12] when she had heard of Jesus
[1:26:16] now when she heard a Brother John
[1:26:18] not when she heard of the disciples not
[1:26:20] when she heard of brother Gerald not
[1:26:21] when she heard a brother Branham when
[1:26:23] she heard of Jesus
[1:26:26] what did she do
[1:26:27] she came in the press behind him and she
[1:26:30] touched His Garment
[1:26:32] for she said if I may touch but his
[1:26:35] clothes
[1:26:36] I shall be whole
[1:26:38] this wasn't something she just thought
[1:26:40] scripture says she said if I can but
[1:26:43] touch his clothes
[1:26:44] I will be made whole what did she do she
[1:26:47] said what she was thinking she
[1:26:49] recognized the word striding down that
[1:26:51] road to jairus's house and she said if I
[1:26:53] can get a hold of the word made flesh
[1:26:55] it'll have an effect on me it'll do what
[1:26:58] it is supposed to do amen
[1:27:01] she said I don't need to have a
[1:27:03] conversation
[1:27:04] don't need to tell him my great need all
[1:27:06] I need to do is touch him
[1:27:09] and any of us might have said to her
[1:27:11] don't slow him down he's got a bigger
[1:27:13] need than yours she said I don't need to
[1:27:15] slow him down I just need to touch him
[1:27:17] as he's going by my wife has told the
[1:27:19] story many times to to different ones
[1:27:21] and I I'm sure I'm okay to say tonight
[1:27:23] we were in Texas and they're they're
[1:27:25] they they are called a prayer line and
[1:27:27] she was in the prayer line behind
[1:27:28] another sister and that sister was was
[1:27:31] being prayed for and they were laying
[1:27:32] hands on her and just uh just it was
[1:27:35] like a wind just swept through right up
[1:27:38] there on that that platform
[1:27:40] and that woman in front of her had a
[1:27:42] great need and that woman's need was met
[1:27:43] but as that breeze passed through which
[1:27:46] was the angel the presence of God in
[1:27:47] that very building my wife got exactly
[1:27:50] what she needed right then and she
[1:27:51] walked up to the minister and he asked
[1:27:53] her what she needed prayer for and she
[1:27:54] said I don't
[1:27:56] why because in the presence of the word
[1:27:59] she was healed without ever having to
[1:28:01] touch
[1:28:02] amen just the presence of the Angel of
[1:28:05] the Lord there healed her instantly gave
[1:28:07] her what she was looking for met her
[1:28:09] need without her ever having to be laid
[1:28:11] on by with hands from the preacher amen
[1:28:14] listen to this woman
[1:28:16] she said if I may but touch his clothes
[1:28:18] I'll be made whole
[1:28:20] verse 29 says and straightway the
[1:28:23] Fountain of her blood was dried up and
[1:28:25] she felt in her body that she was healed
[1:28:27] of that plague
[1:28:29] I want you to catch something here
[1:28:31] because in verse 30 he says and Jesus
[1:28:34] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:28:36] virtue had gone out of him turned him
[1:28:38] about in the press and said who touched
[1:28:40] my clothes
[1:28:41] and his disciples said unto him thou
[1:28:43] seeest the multitude throng in thee and
[1:28:45] say a thou who touched me they said
[1:28:47] everybody's around you everybody's
[1:28:49] touching you what do you mean who
[1:28:51] touched me
[1:28:52] sometimes we're in service and then and
[1:28:54] they're they're screaming and they're
[1:28:56] shouting and there's dancing and there's
[1:28:57] praising and there's crying and we're
[1:28:59] looking around and we're saying
[1:29:00] everybody's touching Jesus
[1:29:03] how can I ever get through maybe they
[1:29:05] are maybe they aren't
[1:29:08] amen the rain falls on the just and the
[1:29:09] unjust but you'll see that Jesus knows
[1:29:12] when somebody touches him with faith
[1:29:13] rather than just touches him amen
[1:29:15] there's a difference to him so don't let
[1:29:18] the fact that other people are louder
[1:29:19] that other people are more expressive
[1:29:21] that other people seem to be getting
[1:29:22] something more than you are getting hold
[1:29:24] you back because all you got to do is
[1:29:26] touch him in the way that brings you
[1:29:27] what you need amen whatever your faith
[1:29:30] says you need to do say Lord that's all
[1:29:31] I need today I'll approach you in my way
[1:29:34] Lord and I believe you'll respond in the
[1:29:36] faith that I have for you you amen she
[1:29:39] didn't need him to lay hands she didn't
[1:29:40] need to hear a word she said if I can
[1:29:43] just touch him that'll do the work
[1:29:46] what is it the word made flesh
[1:29:49] would have the effect that she needed in
[1:29:51] her life
[1:29:52] amen
[1:29:53] but the woman fearing and trembling he
[1:29:56] looked around about to see who had done
[1:29:57] this thing
[1:29:59] sorry yes verse 32 and he looked around
[1:30:02] about to see her that had done this
[1:30:03] thing but the woman fearing and
[1:30:05] trembling knowing what was done in her
[1:30:08] already a finished work came and fell
[1:30:11] down before him and told him all the
[1:30:13] truth she gives him a testimony now
[1:30:16] she tells him why she came what she said
[1:30:19] in her heart and then she says I'm
[1:30:20] Healed and he said unto her daughter thy
[1:30:24] faith
[1:30:25] thy faith hath made the whole go in
[1:30:28] peace and behold of thy plague
[1:30:31] listen
[1:30:34] what's what faith did she have
[1:30:36] was it the faith of Jesus
[1:30:39] he said thy faith
[1:30:42] he said you decided what was going to
[1:30:44] have the effect you decided the way this
[1:30:47] was going you knew who I was and so you
[1:30:49] decided the path it was going to take
[1:30:51] and as soon as you touch me your faith
[1:30:52] made you whole
[1:30:54] who's power hers no her faith his power
[1:30:58] amen she recognized the word expressed
[1:31:01] in front of her and said that word in
[1:31:03] flesh has all the power I need if I can
[1:31:06] but touch him with faith it'll have the
[1:31:08] effect that I'm looking for amen didn't
[1:31:10] matter that she'd interrupted him
[1:31:13] didn't slow him down a bit didn't keep
[1:31:15] him from healing Jairus daughter did it
[1:31:18] but she touched him on the way and he
[1:31:20] was willing to stop and acknowledge that
[1:31:22] and say you're good to go don't ever
[1:31:24] have to worry about it Go in peace amen
[1:31:27] behold of thy plague and it ever
[1:31:29] bothered her again
[1:31:31] what was it she recognized Isaiah 61
[1:31:33] that he came to heal the brokenhearted
[1:31:35] to set the captives free to break them
[1:31:37] out of prison she'd been in a prison for
[1:31:39] 12 years with no hope of ever breaking
[1:31:41] out of that disease in her life amen
[1:31:44] but what on the basis of who Jesus was
[1:31:47] not her worthiness
[1:31:49] not who she was related to not whose
[1:31:51] Ministry she sat under
[1:31:53] she said just because I know who he is
[1:31:56] if I can but touch him that's all I need
[1:31:58] to do and it'll be a finished work
[1:32:02] this is the lowest level there is and
[1:32:04] it's recognizing who he is
[1:32:07] sometimes I think we're trying to do it
[1:32:09] up here and we just have to do it down
[1:32:10] here
[1:32:12] you know
[1:32:12] because well we've read a message that
[1:32:14] that shows us a higher way a greater way
[1:32:17] and it is a greater way
[1:32:19] but it requires sometimes more faith
[1:32:21] than we have and so sometimes our faith
[1:32:23] has to come back to who he is rather
[1:32:25] than pretending that we've got all the
[1:32:26] faith to recognize who we are sometimes
[1:32:28] amen we don't always have it we don't
[1:32:31] always recognize who we are we don't
[1:32:32] always have the faith in who we are to
[1:32:34] come and lay claim but we can always go
[1:32:36] in the faith of who he is if we have a
[1:32:38] true revelation of what the word is amen
[1:32:41] I'm going to take one more as we start
[1:32:42] to close here this is Matthew 8 and it
[1:32:45] says and when Jesus was entered into
[1:32:46] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:32:48] centurion beseeching him
[1:32:50] now this one will make you stop and
[1:32:52] think about it a bit because the other
[1:32:54] ones were Jews there are of his lineage
[1:32:57] you know they were people of the faith
[1:32:59] they were the Seed of Abraham by the
[1:33:00] blood
[1:33:03] now he's got an occupier coming in
[1:33:05] now he's got a man with the authority of
[1:33:07] Rome behind him now he's got a man that
[1:33:10] controls
[1:33:11] part of that City in the name of a pagan
[1:33:13] emperor and now he comes up and he's
[1:33:16] asking for a favor
[1:33:19] what will we do
[1:33:21] because we look at that Centurion and
[1:33:23] say you're definitely not worthy
[1:33:26] you're an oppressor of my people you're
[1:33:27] an occupier in a land that's not yours
[1:33:30] you're holding them back amen you you
[1:33:32] force them to carry your stuff you steal
[1:33:34] from them you do things you ought not to
[1:33:36] do to them as a conqueror
[1:33:38] and yet this man comes up and it says he
[1:33:40] came beseeching begging for Jesus to
[1:33:43] help him
[1:33:44] if you look in the other versions of
[1:33:46] this in the Scripture it says that first
[1:33:47] he sends out the church Elders to talk
[1:33:49] to Jesus
[1:33:50] so this is a man with some character
[1:33:53] he was well thought of by the Jews
[1:33:55] because they came to Jesus and said he's
[1:33:56] a good guy I'm paraphrasing that's not
[1:33:58] in the scripture
[1:34:00] but they said this is a good man
[1:34:03] he's he's one that that they would say
[1:34:04] would be worthy of your time that he's
[1:34:07] been kind to us he's been good to us
[1:34:08] amen but yet he's still an occupier he's
[1:34:11] a pagan as far as we know he's a Roman
[1:34:13] but yet look at the approach he has here
[1:34:15] as he comes in and he doesn't come in
[1:34:16] with a sword he doesn't come in with all
[1:34:18] a hundred of us men behind him and grab
[1:34:21] up Jesus and say come in and heal my
[1:34:22] servant or else but he comes in
[1:34:24] beseeching he comes in pleading amen
[1:34:26] he's asking he comes in humility is what
[1:34:29] he does
[1:34:30] amen a soldier a man in command comes in
[1:34:33] in humility and that's what gets him
[1:34:35] into what he needs from God Amen that's
[1:34:38] the key brother Brown said humility is
[1:34:40] power with God
[1:34:41] and then we're going to read some quotes
[1:34:43] on it brother bam says you know people
[1:34:44] want power and really they don't know
[1:34:46] what power is
[1:34:48] see they don't really know what goes
[1:34:50] with it the Way Up Is Down
[1:34:52] always
[1:34:53] if you want Power see how humble you can
[1:34:56] get
[1:34:57] just get away from all your worldly
[1:34:59] thinking and humble yourself before God
[1:35:01] and then you've got more power than the
[1:35:03] man that runs all over the building and
[1:35:04] makes a big lot of noise
[1:35:07] see because you have been able to
[1:35:10] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[1:35:13] Christ you see to humble yourself before
[1:35:15] him he says that's real power you show
[1:35:18] me a church that's humble real humble
[1:35:21] not an arrogancy a church just a sweet
[1:35:24] Humble Church and I'll show you a church
[1:35:26] that has the favor and power of God in
[1:35:29] it amen that's right that's the thing it
[1:35:31] takes humility humbling ourselves before
[1:35:34] God letting God just work through us he
[1:35:36] says you don't have to make a lot of
[1:35:39] noise
[1:35:40] it amazes me when I'm listening to the
[1:35:41] message of the hour and brother
[1:35:43] branham's there and he's going through
[1:35:45] prayer lines I was listening to One in
[1:35:46] in hum or in um
[1:35:48] presuming and he he prays for about 45
[1:35:51] minutes and you know what he's not
[1:35:53] shouting it down he's not lifting it up
[1:35:56] he's not screaming
[1:35:58] he's just calmly praying time and time
[1:36:02] and time again
[1:36:03] why because he knew who he was he knew
[1:36:06] what his commission was and he knew that
[1:36:08] God was there to back him up
[1:36:09] he didn't have to yell it out you didn't
[1:36:12] have to shout it out in fact we don't
[1:36:14] really see that in the scriptures
[1:36:16] we don't see them yelling and shouting
[1:36:17] to cast things out they look at it and
[1:36:19] they rebuke it and they say get out and
[1:36:20] it gets out just like that whether it's
[1:36:23] sickness whether it's demons whatever we
[1:36:24] want to talk about that simple word of
[1:36:26] authority doesn't have to scream and
[1:36:27] shout listen when our boss comes and
[1:36:29] tells us to do something does he have to
[1:36:31] scream and shout
[1:36:32] shouldn't have to
[1:36:34] why because he knows who he is or she is
[1:36:37] as the case may be amen same thing with
[1:36:39] Jesus
[1:36:40] and same thing with a real Christian
[1:36:43] Bill Graham says we find today that the
[1:36:44] church yet teaching its power and
[1:36:47] teaching the signs to follow the
[1:36:49] believer yet we find them puffed out big
[1:36:51] me little you
[1:36:53] and that it isn't like the early church
[1:36:55] you see they were humble and kind to one
[1:36:58] another and sweet understanding
[1:37:01] and it's so much different today and I
[1:37:03] wonder if a lot of this isn't hasn't
[1:37:05] sidetracked us from the real kernel of
[1:37:07] the message that we want to Humble
[1:37:09] ourselves he says the more humbler you
[1:37:12] can be the better God will use you hey
[1:37:16] man can you imagine if that Centurion
[1:37:17] walked up with a hundred of his soldiers
[1:37:19] and said you come or else what would
[1:37:21] Jesus have done
[1:37:22] laughed
[1:37:24] he did probably just ignored him
[1:37:26] right why Jesus didn't respond to that
[1:37:28] sort of thing he didn't flare up
[1:37:31] didn't need to but I guarantee you that
[1:37:33] guy's servant wouldn't have been healed
[1:37:34] because he came with a sword in his hand
[1:37:35] and tried to force Jesus to do it amen
[1:37:37] but why didn't he come that way
[1:37:40] because his faith was that Jesus was a
[1:37:42] part of the Supernatural and he may not
[1:37:44] have understood who and what he was but
[1:37:46] he believed that that man had power and
[1:37:48] he believed that that man had Authority
[1:37:49] and so he came to him asking because he
[1:37:52] himself didn't have that Authority he
[1:37:54] could command menk but he couldn't
[1:37:55] command diseases
[1:37:56] but he believed that Jesus had that
[1:37:58] Authority that he needed Matthew 8 says
[1:38:00] in verse 6 says insane so he came
[1:38:02] beseeching he's he's begging Jesus he
[1:38:04] says Lord Lord
[1:38:07] I was reading in my devotions this
[1:38:09] morning where it's talking about Jesus
[1:38:10] and Judas and when Judas comes to betray
[1:38:13] Jesus what does he call him
[1:38:15] master
[1:38:17] and in the in the footnote there it said
[1:38:20] that Judas never called Jesus Lord in
[1:38:23] Scripture
[1:38:26] why didn't recognize who he was and yet
[1:38:30] a a pagan Centurion comes to him and
[1:38:32] calls him Lord
[1:38:33] amen that tells you what he believed
[1:38:35] Jesus was he believed that he was more
[1:38:37] than a man that's for sure
[1:38:38] amen amen he says Lord my servant lieth
[1:38:41] at home sick of the palsy grievously
[1:38:43] tormented and Jesus saith unto him I
[1:38:45] will come and heal him
[1:38:47] it's so simple
[1:38:49] ask and you'll receive in humility Jesus
[1:38:53] says I'll come and heal him can you
[1:38:55] imagine if they had Twitter that day
[1:38:57] Jesus agree agrees to heal the servant
[1:39:00] of the oppressor right it it'll lit up
[1:39:03] Twitter it'll lit up Instagram and
[1:39:05] Facebook they'd have jumped all over him
[1:39:07] for helping the Centurion
[1:39:09] because he was an occupier that wasn't
[1:39:10] supposed to be there right I thought he
[1:39:12] was supposed to free us and now he's
[1:39:13] going to help them out what kind of
[1:39:15] Messiah is this
[1:39:17] says the Centurion answered and said
[1:39:19] Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest
[1:39:22] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:39:24] only and my servant shall be healed
[1:39:26] we've talked about speak the word I want
[1:39:28] you to catch something before Jesus can
[1:39:30] speak the word the Centurion has to open
[1:39:32] the door
[1:39:33] he has to open the door for the
[1:39:35] supernatural doesn't he says look you
[1:39:37] don't have to come to my house
[1:39:39] why he said I'm not worthy he knew it
[1:39:41] could cause trouble for Jesus he didn't
[1:39:42] want to cause trouble with Jesus and his
[1:39:44] own people by going into what a Roman's
[1:39:47] house he says my house isn't clean it's
[1:39:49] not worthy it's not sanctified
[1:39:51] I'm not serving the god that you serve
[1:39:55] he says you don't don't come into my
[1:39:57] house
[1:39:58] I'm not worthy the house is not suited
[1:40:00] for you
[1:40:01] he says but what speak the word only in
[1:40:04] my servant shall be healed
[1:40:07] that's an amazing thing when he has as
[1:40:09] much consideration for that man as he
[1:40:10] does for his own servant where he says
[1:40:12] listen I don't want to cause trouble
[1:40:14] just say it and it'll happen I believe
[1:40:17] you
[1:40:18] brother Brahm says I like the attitude
[1:40:20] of this Centurion tonight that we've
[1:40:21] just read of he was a man that felt
[1:40:24] unworthy
[1:40:27] don't let unworthiness hold you back
[1:40:30] we're all unworthy
[1:40:32] scripture says Thou Art Worthy
[1:40:35] Amen to take the buck and loose the
[1:40:37] seals that are there on
[1:40:39] he says as long as you're feeling
[1:40:41] Unworthy of the blessing you're asking
[1:40:42] you're pretty apt to get it but when you
[1:40:45] get to a place where you think God just
[1:40:47] owes it to you that's when you're
[1:40:49] mistaken
[1:40:50] we're in debt to God not God in debt to
[1:40:52] us we're indebted to God and this Roman
[1:40:54] Italian whatever he was he said Lord I'm
[1:40:57] not worthy that you come under my roof
[1:40:58] and neither thought I thought I worthy
[1:41:01] to come to face you because remember he
[1:41:02] sent the elders first he didn't even
[1:41:04] consider himself worthy to even ask
[1:41:07] but when Jesus came close he said whoa I
[1:41:09] got to go keep him from coming to my
[1:41:10] house that's not going to be good for
[1:41:11] him
[1:41:12] in other words I send your church to
[1:41:14] meet you and to ask this question but I
[1:41:17] have faith I know that you're a man
[1:41:18] under Authority for I'm under Authority
[1:41:20] you don't have to come down to my house
[1:41:21] to put your hands on my servant you
[1:41:23] don't have to come here and say any
[1:41:25] prayer he says notice now be sure to get
[1:41:28] this he said I'm a man under Authority
[1:41:30] also and if I say to this man you go do
[1:41:32] it he will do it now if I say to this
[1:41:34] man you come here he'll come I'm under
[1:41:36] Authority and them who are under me has
[1:41:38] to obey me and he knew that was the son
[1:41:41] of God and that every sickness and every
[1:41:43] demon was under him
[1:41:45] sometimes we're sitting here and we
[1:41:47] doubt that it's under us go to the one
[1:41:49] that you know it's under then amen if
[1:41:51] you don't have faith in who you are go
[1:41:52] to the one that you have faith in that
[1:41:54] does heaven
[1:41:55] scripture says it's under our feet
[1:41:56] everything's under our feet amen but
[1:41:59] he's the head go to the head if you're
[1:42:00] not trusting your part amen because
[1:42:02] they're definitely under his feet
[1:42:04] he says and all he had to do is just
[1:42:06] speak the word not pray just speak the
[1:42:09] word that's all and it will be done
[1:42:11] because every demon would have to obey
[1:42:13] him do you believe that tonight he says
[1:42:16] every demon will obey God it has to
[1:42:18] everything obeys God
[1:42:20] but he closes out he says and it will
[1:42:22] obey you if you have faith
[1:42:28] we continue the Centurion says for I'm a
[1:42:30] man under Authority having soldiers
[1:42:31] under me and I say to this man go and he
[1:42:33] goeth into another come and he cometh
[1:42:35] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[1:42:37] it now when Jesus heard it he marveled
[1:42:39] and said to them that followed verily I
[1:42:42] say unto you I have not found so great
[1:42:45] faith no not in Israel
[1:42:48] Prophet God would say this is the
[1:42:49] perfect expression of Faith to the
[1:42:51] Gentile bride
[1:42:52] he says because the Jews required a
[1:42:54] laying out of hands he says but the
[1:42:55] Gentiles said speak the word
[1:42:58] but remember to speak the word was to
[1:42:59] Jesus not to the Centurion
[1:43:02] the Centurion just say didn't say let me
[1:43:04] speak and he said Lord you speak it and
[1:43:06] that's when I know what's going to
[1:43:07] happen but this is the perfect
[1:43:08] expression of faith in The Believer
[1:43:11] but yet we have Mark 16 these different
[1:43:13] ones that say if they lay hands on the
[1:43:14] sick they shall recover why because
[1:43:16] there's Faith to cover it no matter what
[1:43:17] there's Grace there's a way for
[1:43:19] everything that we need you don't have
[1:43:20] to always have high Faith you just have
[1:43:22] to come believing in whatever way that
[1:43:24] you want to go to God and he'll meet
[1:43:25] your need as long as it's according to
[1:43:27] the word amen
[1:43:28] he says I have not found Faith so great
[1:43:30] no not in Israel and I say unto you that
[1:43:32] many shall come from the East and West
[1:43:34] and shall sit down with Abraham and
[1:43:35] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:43:38] but the children of the Kingdom shall be
[1:43:40] cast out into outer Darkness there shall
[1:43:42] be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:43:44] and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy
[1:43:47] way and as thou Hast what believed
[1:43:50] so be it done unto thee and his servant
[1:43:53] was healed in the self-same hour
[1:43:56] as thou Hast believed
[1:43:58] wasn't all in his head was it because he
[1:44:00] said just speak the word only
[1:44:03] yeah and he'll be okay what he said he
[1:44:05] expressed what he believed Jesus was
[1:44:07] capable of doing and Jesus said you're
[1:44:09] right I can't and I will and then he did
[1:44:12] it and it happened exactly the way he
[1:44:14] wanted it to happen amen why he said I'm
[1:44:17] unworthy
[1:44:18] I'm unworthy
[1:44:20] he was unworthy I'm unworthy you're
[1:44:22] unworthy don't rest on your on your
[1:44:24] worthiness
[1:44:25] amen you're not always going to feel
[1:44:27] worthy when you have needs amen
[1:44:29] sometimes when we're feeling the least
[1:44:31] Worthy is when we have the greatest need
[1:44:33] isn't it
[1:44:34] whether it's in our spirit whether it's
[1:44:36] in our emotions in our relationships
[1:44:37] when things just don't seem to be going
[1:44:39] right and we sit there and we feel
[1:44:41] unworthy
[1:44:42] and yet that's when we need him the
[1:44:43] greatest
[1:44:45] listen if it didn't stop a centurion
[1:44:46] don't let it stop you
[1:44:48] amen amen that wasn't even a child of
[1:44:50] God as far as We Know
[1:44:52] as far as we know we don't ever hear
[1:44:53] anything of them chances are he just
[1:44:54] went on doing what he was always doing
[1:44:56] but yet God met his need how much more
[1:44:58] will he do it to a child of God that
[1:44:59] comes to him and is he going to heal the
[1:45:01] the the the the the servant of a
[1:45:03] centurion and leave your child or your
[1:45:05] family out there with no touch no
[1:45:07] Deliverance no healing no mercy no Grace
[1:45:09] no of course not he said if I'll do it
[1:45:12] if I'll take care of the sparrows then
[1:45:14] I'm certainly going to take care of my
[1:45:15] own children amen while he came that we
[1:45:17] might have life and more abundantly that
[1:45:19] our joy may be full as I said not half
[1:45:21] full full that there's a greater portion
[1:45:23] there's a greater measure if we'll only
[1:45:25] ask him for it if he'll only stay there
[1:45:27] and trust him to do it amen where his
[1:45:28] children
[1:45:29] and God expects more of us he does we
[1:45:32] know that and sometimes that's the thing
[1:45:34] that holds us back as we're sitting
[1:45:35] there we're saying but I'm not what I
[1:45:37] think I should be
[1:45:38] listen you're where God wants you to be
[1:45:41] and if you're not then he'll get you
[1:45:43] where he needs you to be so don't sit
[1:45:44] there saying I'm not wire ought to be
[1:45:46] listen he's your father he's given you
[1:45:48] the tutor of the Holy Spirit he's the
[1:45:50] one that's giving you the word he's the
[1:45:51] one that's giving you the ministry to
[1:45:52] perfect you you'll be where you need to
[1:45:54] be when you need to be it amen so don't
[1:45:57] sit there and say I'm not ready I'm not
[1:45:58] worthy and I can't go to him listen if
[1:46:01] your life is under the blood of Christ
[1:46:02] if you've repented of all things and
[1:46:04] your conscience is clear you can go to
[1:46:06] him with any need that you have today
[1:46:07] amen not on the basis of your worthiness
[1:46:10] but because you recognize who and what
[1:46:12] he is and that you're a part of his
[1:46:13] great plan that you're a part of the
[1:46:15] very word that you confess him to be
[1:46:16] amen amen
[1:46:19] Jesus said if thou can'tst believe all
[1:46:21] things are possible what brother Branham
[1:46:22] say was the theme of his ministry
[1:46:24] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:46:28] yesterday today and forever he said my
[1:46:31] Ministry is to declare him that he's
[1:46:34] here
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:36] he didn't say my Ministry is to declare
[1:46:38] you that you're worthy even though he
[1:46:41] did
[1:46:42] he says my Ministries to declare him
[1:46:43] that he's here and then what did he talk
[1:46:45] about the unrecognized presence of God
[1:46:48] amen how many walk by Jesus and never
[1:46:51] recognized who he was a good man a great
[1:46:53] man a prophet but they didn't recognize
[1:46:55] the word and flesh and they missed out
[1:46:57] on a blessing every time amen how much
[1:47:01] more are we out to be able to come to
[1:47:03] the throne of grace then
[1:47:04] amen if a leper can come if an unworthy
[1:47:07] Centurion can come then why can't a
[1:47:09] child of God come I mean if he's bid you
[1:47:11] come if he's told you to ask if he's
[1:47:13] told you to come that your joy may be
[1:47:15] full that you might have life more
[1:47:16] abundantly what would hold us back
[1:47:18] man what is it that would keep us from
[1:47:20] coming to him and asking for these
[1:47:21] things amen
[1:47:22] so much is when we're focused on Who We
[1:47:25] Are and we forget that this is about who
[1:47:28] he was who he is and that we're a part
[1:47:30] of him that we're identified with him
[1:47:32] remember he read there and maybe we
[1:47:34] didn't read it I read so many things
[1:47:36] these days I forget where I read them
[1:47:37] but brother Brown talked about he said
[1:47:39] when he was on the cross you were with
[1:47:40] the cross with him when he walked this
[1:47:41] Earth You you were with him when he was
[1:47:43] whipped on the post you were whipped
[1:47:45] with him he says you are identified with
[1:47:46] him all and your your worthiness was in
[1:47:49] him and then he took the shame and the
[1:47:51] reproach and everything on him and gave
[1:47:53] you his righteousness so that you could
[1:47:54] stand before him you're standing in
[1:47:56] front of him not because of your
[1:47:57] worthiness but because he made you
[1:47:58] worthy that he gave you his very own
[1:48:01] righteousness so that you could stand
[1:48:02] before him what the Spotless bride of
[1:48:05] Christ
[1:48:06] amen God bless you let's stand if you
[1:48:08] would this evening
[1:48:09] I want to read one more scripture just
[1:48:11] as the musicians are coming it's Hebrews
[1:48:12] 11 6 says but without faith it is
[1:48:15] impossible to please him
[1:48:17] for he that cometh to him to God Must
[1:48:20] Believe first that he is
[1:48:23] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:48:25] diligently seek him what holds us back
[1:48:28] so often is we think he's not going to
[1:48:29] answer
[1:48:30] that he's not going to listen that he's
[1:48:32] not going to hear that he's not going to
[1:48:33] give us what we have need of Jesus says
[1:48:36] you come like that it's not going to
[1:48:37] work you've got to believe that he is
[1:48:40] and then you've got to believe that he's
[1:48:41] going to reward those that diligently
[1:48:43] seek after him amen that woman you got
[1:48:45] to imagine the the woman with the issue
[1:48:46] of blood she's got a whole crowd
[1:48:48] standing around him guess what she
[1:48:50] didn't start right next to Jesus she had
[1:48:52] to fight her way through that crowd just
[1:48:54] to where she could just Touch the Hem of
[1:48:56] His Garment she had to fight her way
[1:48:58] there but she believed if she could get
[1:49:00] to him then he would meet the need amen
[1:49:01] amen how much more us you don't even
[1:49:04] have to fight we're here
[1:49:06] we're here at a time and in a place
[1:49:08] that's dedicated to his worship and to
[1:49:09] his praise you don't have to fight
[1:49:11] through anybody the only thing you've
[1:49:12] got to fight through is your own
[1:49:13] feelings about yourself your own

[1:49:16] Satan tries to cast on us every single
[1:49:18] day to hold us back from the presence of
[1:49:20] God because if he can get you looking at
[1:49:21] yourself he's got you beat every single
[1:49:23] time but if he can get you looking at
[1:49:25] the perfect sacrifice that took your
[1:49:27] place
[1:49:28] if God can get you to do that nothing's
[1:49:30] going to hold you back because he's the
[1:49:32] one that's worthy and you're going to
[1:49:33] him because the word is the one that's
[1:49:35] declared him worthy and the one that's
