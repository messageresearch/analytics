traveling mercies to them good to have sister elise with us as well god bless you amen we also have a birthday this morning and brother chad i believe is 28 29 close amen god bless you brother chad just trusting the lord's blessing on you in the coming year amen brother josh mentioned brother bob and sister brent will be traveling uh today and getting in early tonight early tomorrow morning so we want to remember them then also uh alana and david and the family arrive friday so they'll be here they'll be staying at brother joe's house and then jess and jonathan my other sister and their family they arrive uh tuesday and then we have brother aaron oglesby and sister lydia oglesby from louisiana coming in on monday brother aaron is a full-time evangelist so he'll be preaching for us the following sunday lord willing he's coming up to to vacation he's not coming up to preach it's not a planned preaching trip but he's graciously uh allowed us to book him in on sunday so uh i'll be taking the service today of course brother gerald will lord willing take the next two and then brother i'll take one and then we're sorry aaron we'll take one then i'll take one and you know we'll kind of balance it out there but anyways be in prayer for each one of them as they travel international travel as we well know at this point is a gong show so just trusting that god will get them through to us safely and with minimal issues amen amen philippians 2 and verse 5 says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved as ye als have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure how by the mind of christ and you amen when the mind is subject and led by the holy spirit we will not only want to do what he asks us to do but we will do what he wants us to do it says in verse 14 do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of law no it says holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain amen that's the prophet's reward is when people will accept his word and not just take it in their minds but take it into their lives and live it out amen god bless you you can have your seats this morning and then we're going to continue in this this little series of in his form and with his mind and we want to just kind of do a quick review with the collins family wasn't here in some different ones so i just want to do a quick review here over where we started but we we set a foundation last service for the unveiling of god we spoke about how you had jehovah god the the self-existing one there at the very beginning he was a spirit you couldn't see him you couldn't touch him you couldn't feel him and so he created what he created out of himself a light and he stepped into that light and the light itself was not god it was a form for him and then he stepped into it and so that when you saw the light you could say there is god amen now the light was not god but the light was what the the veil that god was hiding himself behind and so for us as as humans we would say wherever that light is wherever that pillar of fire is wherever that logos of god is we would say there is god that's god to us that's the only representation that's the only visible aspect of god that we have so we say that is god because we can we can make contact with that amen and he called that light what it was the son of god it was a thing that came out of god it was born out of god it was a part of god and it was the visible manifestation of god and that was the son amen now we read in colossians 1 verse 12 says giving thanks unto the father which had made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light that means he's made us what worthy he says he's made you meet he's made you remember when you look in genesis it talks about he made a help meet for the man one that is suitable he says he's made us suitable to be partakers in the inheritance of the saints and light who had delivered us from the power of darkness so we all everyone no matter if we are raised in a message family and a pastor's family whatever it is we were all in what under the power of darkness every one of us and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god and so many people will stop there but he says the firstborn of every creature the firstborn of every creation the firstborn of every child of god amen so god stepped into that body of christ he was the image of the invisible god and that is his name jesus christ and he is the son of god now brother branham just again we're doing a quick review here he says out yonder i see now all that space that all is god without form forever for eternities no beginning no ending it's all god he says before there was even air there was god the very beginning of nature of creation was god and now the bible teaches us that the logos went out of god or i might say now listen to this he says all of the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of god let's look what it looked like no one has seen the father at any time nowhere they never did and they never will but notice how he says here becoming his first body form that means if there is a first there must be a second and potentially a third and a fourth and a fifth and an eighth and a tenth and all these different things and we went through that on wednesday when we looked at the unfolding the unveiling of god and we saw him in melchizedek we saw him in the lord that talked to abraham remember he said unto him lord he called him lord he called him elohim he called him god jehovah amen and then we saw him as a fourth man in the fire and then we saw him as jesus christ in a corporal body and then we saw him as a pillar of fire that knocks all off of his horse it was all christ it was all the anointed one it was all the son of god it was all god in a different form in a different body of his own choosing and he could take any form he wants and i was reading quotes from brother and said god can take on any form he wants right he can do it whatever way he wants he can veil himself any way he wants because he's god and he can put himself into whatever he wants for a moment amen now we spoke is that that verse says of jesus christ was the firstborn among many brethren so that means he's the first of a long line of brethren he's the first of a long a long line of forms of god if we want to put it that way of p of beings that are indwelt by the very life and purpose of god amen and when jesus said in the scripture we saw that he had a lineage and he says i come from god and i go back to god and we read the quotes of brother brahm says he started as light and he went back to light because we saw him as light in the beginning and then when he knocks all off his horse he was light but in between he's all of these different forms but yet it was god in a form and then it goes back to god and then it comes god out again to another form and it goes back to god and the point is whatever is of god always comes back to god i mean that's what we want to recognize here and he has what a theophany body and each one of us has a theophany body it's a glorified body where we're meant to dwell with him forever amen that's the only place we'll be sinless and perfect in totality is when we get into our theophany bodies paul says here in ephesians 5 because he's preparing a sinless perfect bride and in ephesians he says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that he that it should be holy and without blemish so if you have any doubts about your lineage today if you have any doubts about your bloodline if you have any doubts about your worthiness read this scripture because it has nothing to do with where you come from in this natural world that we live in amen it doesn't matter who my daddy is doesn't matter who my father is doesn't matter who my pastor is none of this matters as long as i was a part of him in the beginning because he's the one that's taking care and bringing me to that place of spotless holiness and without blemish conditioning amen but in between that in between our start and our finish there's a redemptive process that's going on and it's what it's restoring us back to our eating condition amen what we have right now is not that perfect spotless thing i only have one part of me redeemed right now and that's my soul amen i have eternal life i've been sealed by the holy spirit and that's the full redemption but i still have a body that's completely blocking my my spiritual nature that is warring against me day in and day out so i'm not fully redeemed yet amen i'm looking for something more but i'm satisfied right now to have eternal life and i have the fellowship with god that i need amen amen but from there we took it to genesis and we saw how adam was first created in the image of god and he was first created in a spirit form and within that spirit form was both the male and the female natures amen so he was like god you couldn't touch him couldn't feel him couldn't see him but then what happened was he follow he was created the same as god but then he followed the same manifestation curve or the manifestation path of god if we wanted to put it that way and what happened was he stepped into a body now he stepped into something that we could see feel and touch and the prophet of god says he was put into a body that could interact with his own home right he could interact with the plants he could interact with the animals they could see him here and feel and these different things amen now the prophet said this he says now let us make man in our own image and if he made a man in his own image he made a supernatural being yes indeed he says genesis 1 28 read it and see if that isn't right and when we look at adam's lineage in luke it says which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god amen the son of god so you have right there the second among many brethren the first one was christ second one was adam his lineage in the book of luke says that he was the son of god he was the first one put in a in a human form on this earth amen so adam's original state and our original position was as a son of god amen we're not to be the way we are now and then so often we're we feel like we're natural beings having a supernatural experience but the prophet of god said we're supernatural beings having a natural experience amen and so the question is are we looking to the unseen are we looking to the supernatural or are we looking to the natural are we looking to have what are we looking to have have the focus and the energy in our life what are we looking to for overcoming power what are we looking to to resolve the things in our lives is it the natural arm or is it the supernatural alarm because if we're being restored back to our position then we ought to be seeing the supernatural effect in our lives rather than running around trying to achieve it all ourselves amen then we saw how god created a place just for adam and it was a garden called eden and it was planted just in a particular place for adam to take care of and then god had given him a purpose god had given him a place god had prepared something for adam to do and we spoke how god doesn't put us on the earth to do nothing he always has a purpose he always has a plan he always has something that we can do and only we can do so from brother mark down in the corner all the way back to brother bichel in the other corner each and every one of us has a place to be and a thing to do and a way to do it and god has prepared us and made us a body and given us a nature and given us these different things that we need to achieve what god has laid out for us amen now i want to pick up from there because if we go back to genesis 1 it kind of sets out adam's scope of work now anybody that's worked in business at some time that's that's worked with doing contracts and whatnot whenever you're applying to do work and you're putting in a bid what do they give you they give you a document called the scope of work and if they accept your bid and they say we're going to pay you money then you have to do everything that's in that scope of work and you have to do it the way they said and you have to achieve the goals they said and you've got to hit the milestones that they've said in the time that they said and if you do that then you get money and if you don't get it a lot of times you have to pay penalties or they get to take some money back from you right but god laid out a scope of work for adam and for eve if you remember and then genesis 1 it says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them now we saw that that was two different things at the beginning was a spirit form both of them there and then the second one he gave them bodies right and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now what is god doing here he's giving adam a piece of his mind and not the way that we get a piece of a mind from somebody in the world today he's saying adam here's my thoughts about this situation here's what i want you to do he's saying here's what i'm seeing play out in my mind now adam go out and do what i'm telling you to do that's my peace of mind for you that's what i've got for you adam and i'm telling you what it is so you don't have to wonder you don't have to worry am i in god's will am i not in god's will what is god's will he's saying adam here's my will now this might seem like a bit of an impossible task if it was just us because in our condition in our bodies right now we wouldn't be able to do what adam's doing but god never sets us with an impossible task amen he always gives us what we have needed he always gives us the tools he always gives us the weapons he gives us the power the authority whatever it is god never asks us to do an impossible task but i want you to break down i want to break down here this morning what god told adam because we'll see that what happened in the fall was that they got away from their task and they didn't realize some of these things and they got away from it or eve got away from it in particular now the first thing he says is be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth so in other words have children and have lots of children that was the goal for adam and eve was to replenish but we do not see anywhere in scripture where he tells them how to do it that's right he doesn't tell him how to do it but he tells them to do it and we see that perhaps that's what tripped eve up was that she was trying to have children with a way that god had told her not to do it right there was a way that seemed obvious and then there was god's way if i could put it that way and sometimes that's what we're looking and saying lord this is obvious he says yes but that's not my way i've got a way for you to do well lord i don't know how to do it but just wait i've told you how to do it so i'll make the way but don't try and do it your way because i've told you not to do it your way right but that word replenish means to fill so god was really expecting them to have a lot of children that's a lot of pressure on a woman have a lot of children but it wasn't meant to be that way and i believe the prophet said it was supposed to be spoken world children because that's what christ was was a spoken word son and then it was perfect it was sinless it was without intercourse in these different things now the second task was to subdue the earth now that word subdue means to dominate to bring into submission to subject to one's authority and rule and to tread down now that doesn't seem like something you'd have to do to a new creation but you remember the earth was it says in genesis 1 it says that the world was what without form and void and that word or that phrasing there means that it was in chaos there had been a judgment that had put on the earth and so god was now bringing things back out but this earth was not some sort of oasis it was a wasteland he had just separated the the the atmosphere he put the atmosphere up and separated the water and the land so it was potentially livable but this place was a it was just nothing everything had been destroyed everything had been covered by water there was no life on it there was no plant life nothing and so god has made everything possible there the potential's in the ground but it's still in a state of chaos when he puts adam down there amen so maybe there are all sorts of things happening maybe there was great earthquakes and natural disasters and whatnot and so he comes down and he says you've got to subdue the earth he's not he's talking about the geography he's talking about the the natural elements here he's not just talking about the animals but he's saying adam you've got to have control and you've got to control everything that's going on in this planet now yeah amen now god had done some of the work he'd separated the things out but he says look adam you've got to come in and take control because if we're looking to grow the earth then guess what you don't want these the these category five hurricanes coming and ripping up your plants as soon as they come out right you've got to give them a chance to grow and then maybe you'll let in storms from time to time to what to anchor the roots to get them strong and make them resilient but you're not going to destroy everything you're allowed to come in so adam has control over the entire earth god says you got to take it you got to take the earth by the scruff of the next sort of thing and you've got to now protect what god has asked you to grow up amen the prophet of god says this about adam he says and when god made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a lesser god jesus declared it when he said is not it written in your laws that you are god's and if they called those gods who the word of god came to which was the prophets how can you condemn me when i say i am the son of god he said see but they just couldn't understand it see now look how jesus phrased it he says they called them gods who the word of god came to and pointed to the prophets now we're not all prophets but guess what the word of god has come to each and every one of us hasn't it and then the word has to come to you as an individual in order for you to receive it and to step out in faith and accept the the blood of of calvary and and to go down and be baptized and receive the holy ghost amen so you have to receive a word and a word has to come to you and that word has to come from god if it's going to bring forth god's life in you amen but christ comes here and they're they're pointing them and saying you make yourself you're committing you know blasphemy because you make yourself a son of god and he says i'm here and i'm doing literally the works of god in front of you how can you not see this if you can call a prophet who speaks the word a god then how about one that lives the word not only just speaks it but lives and he says if you don't believe me believe the works that i do i'm doing the very works of god in front of you and you won't believe it because you're so stuck on what what you think the word means and meanwhile the word is living out in front of them amen amen but the word has come to us in the same way that it has come to him because it's called us to a place it's called us to a position it's called us to a purpose and as we step into that then we become what sons and daughters of god i mean that's all he's looking for us to do amen it didn't just come to isaiah it didn't just come to samuel it didn't just come to william branham it didn't just come to paul it didn't just come to jesus christ but there is a word come in our day to call out a people to become what the bride of jesus christ the representation the form of god on this earth right now with his mind yes sir now we're not the fullness we know we're not the fullness collectively he's poured all of himself into us but brother mark will never be the fullness of god any more than weisha will or myself or anyone else right but there'll be a portion of god and it's up to us to see that in one another amen to see the portion of god rather than the carnality that surrounds it amen brother braham says it this way he says man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given those great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell and adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters whatever it was everything obeyed adam now that's the beginning of man that's what god gave him power over everything on earth but you see where he said adam failed he says the power that was given him to make himself that's where he fell he never got around to that and then eve tried to take over and that's where she messed up he says but man was put here with a dominion over the earth he had everything under his control and what adam lost jesus proved that he had restored he stopped nature he raised the dead he done everything and the world is groaning today the bible says for the manifestation of the sons plural more of them more than william branham more than jesus christ amen it is a multitude of the sons and daughters of god for god to get his people again or his children again in realities to make things real he says and it stumbles the people wow where are we standing today if the prophet has come and showed us what it looks like to be an adopted son and daughter son of god where are we to be standing today amen the prophet of god said the church is what living below her privileges and when you ran when she what when the true church recognizes who she is the rapture will go so all we're looking to do now is recognize who we are and you know how you recognize who you are fellowship with him that's the only way you're ever going to do it that's the only way you're ever going to know who you are is if you listen to him more than anything else and anyone else amen if you sit under the preaching of the word if you're reading your bible if you're praying if you're giving more time to that voice than any other voice that's in this generation then you're going to start to realize who and what you are but if you start to listen to other voices if you start to listen to a religious voice a serpent voice then you're not going to recognize who you are because he's going to pull you away into trying to make it happen yourself amen listen we're not called to rearrange the geography of the planet and control the elements in the way that that adam was god may call us to do that at some point god may call us to do that at some point but we're here to do one thing and what is that is to destroy the effects of satan's kingdom in our life i mean that's what he's looking to do is restore us back to where what satan is as what effectively blocked and unable to affect us as he was in the very beginning without him that's what he's looking for amen and first john 3 8 it says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so we are what sons and daughters of god so what are we supposed to do when we're manifested destroy the works of the devil in our lives in our family's lives we're supposed to be what taking back what god had what the devil had taken from us amen we're supposed to be reading the title d we're supposed to be stepping onto our property we're supposed to be pushing him out of our house by what the power of the holy spirit taking the word on its lips and moving it out amen amen now i want to read you a scripture from the old testament but don't look at this as an old testament scripture and you'll see why we don't look at it that way amen because we're stepping into a land that we've been promised amen we were in a promised land amen that was the first church age they were in the promised land they were in one accord they were all in unity the holy spirit was moving amongst men they were moving perfectly there were no flaws there were no failures they were just doing exactly what the holy spirit said and then as they started to do what let men take control and the holy spirit got pushed out then they stepped into denomination but we're being restored back to that condition but we're moving beyond it amen brother brahm says we do not have the pentecostal message because we're going beyond the original pentecost we're going all the way back to eternity with what we have now but we're being restored to that place of perfect unity is what we're talking about they left their first love and we're being restored back to what the faith of the original pentecostal fathers which was what a perfect love with him but this is in deuteronomy 30 and it says in the lord thy god will bring thee into a land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do the good and multiply thee above thy fathers in other words he'll take you further than he took your father's he'll go further he'll bring more than they had and that's where we're at isn't it because nobody ever has taken a rapture as a group you've had one here and one there but you never had a whole group a whole united body go and take a rapture before it says and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart i've thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest what live live by what the whole word of god you won't go in and out you won't go back and forth you won't be up and down but you'll be stable and you'll be in it all the time you'll get in and you'll stay in and you'll be fruitful in that air in that place amen you'll stay with it why because it won't just be with you but it'll be in you scripture says even to the end of the age amen is that not us sir perfectly because this remember the jews are circumcision of the flesh but moses is saying here this is he's going to circumcise your heart so yes there is a promise to the jews there's 144 000 that are going to get that but this circumcision of the heart that's for the gentiles that's a gentile thing primarily and it goes to the jews at the very end and paul says it in colossians 2 he says for in him dwelleth in him christ jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in other words a man can't do this listen william branham can't circumcise you brother gerald can't circumcise you i can't circumcise you this is a circumcision that happens on the inward part of you and it takes god to do it amen it's no man involved inside of it in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead so deuteronomy 30 points us to a circumcision that has nothing to do with the jews it's pointed to a holy ghost circumcision amen now if we go back to deuteronomy it says and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee you'll see that when he calls 144 000 out there's judgment on everybody else isn't there amen but there's judgment on the rest of the world right now too amen the gentile world is being judged it says and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord i will send thee elijah the prophet to what turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen amen amen and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day what is it they'll live it they won't just go to the temple once a year or for the feast or whatever but they'll live it every day amen they'll live in his commandments because his will is their will his purpose is their purpose and his life is their life amen and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord shall it will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul for this commandment which i command thee this day is not hid him from thee neither is it far off now listen to this what we're in the fullness of times we're at the end of the gentile age at the end of the gentile dispensation he says this thing i'm talking about it's not far away now listen this was after they've been this is this is a time looking past when they take the land and then they'd be booted out he says it's not far away this is six thousand years five thousand years in the future and he says it's not far but looking at the gentile time now we look at this and we say it's here it's not far off is it and he says it's not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it so we don't have to go up to get it he says neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it so it's not on another continent we don't need to know go get another ministry or anything everything we have need of he's given us right here it says we don't have to go up an angel has already descended the mighty angel has descended he's brought it down it's not hid him from us now it's open to us what he wants us to do and it says here but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart what that you can preach a good sermon that you can win an argument that thou mayest do it that you can live it that you can have it come out of you as a life spring as a well that people can see that god is in you and he has an effect on you amen that it's him living it's not i that liveth but it's christ that live within me that time is not far off but it's nigh us it's here right now amen it's restoring time adam was the son of god walking on the earth and what god what he did then jesus did when he came back the prophet god said to us what did he do he had a mandate he had a purpose he had a clear scope of work he had a direction from god and that's what we're looking for each and every one of us the greatest thing we need i believe is clear purpose for each and every one of our lives if you know what god wants you to do then you can move on in confidence and satan can't touch you it's when you doubt it's when you don't know it's when you're uncertain and we'll get into that in a little bit it's when you're uncertain that saving has an end in there because he tries and gets you doing something now that's slightly off the word somebody told me the other day they said the prophet of god said if you fire a bullet a little bit off in the beginning by the time you get to the end it's way off all satan's doing is looking to open up a little gap and five years down the road you'll be so far off and wonder how you got there it's because he got you off the word just that little bit amen the third task that god gave them was to have dominion over the animals and every living thing in other words there was no being no form that was of a higher position than adam nothing came above adam on this earth there is no animal no matter how big you know they say the the polar bears the apex predators the biggest bear nothing can kill a polar bear nothing can touch a polar bear listen the polar bears answered that to adam in that condition polar bear didn't have nothing on him didn't matter how big strong an elephant didn't matter nothing could touch at him in that condition he was the apex predator but he wasn't a predator because he ruled by love and then he ruled by love back then he didn't you know that word to take dominion says that you put it under and you dominate and you rule over it but you rule by love because that's how god has always done today man he had the mind of god he had the nature of god that's why he couldn't be fooled by the serpent he was the firstborn amongst what the humanity and so he comes down and he's got that perfect mind of god satan can't touch it and he's ruling the exact same way that god did and that is by love firmly but by love and then always with with a good intention behind it and then david wrote of us and he said what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visites him david's saying why what does god even deal with us why does he even talk to us why do we even have this relationship with them he says for thou has made him a little lower than the angels but has crowned him with glory and honor thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and thou has put all things under his feet that's your position today church that's your position in christ and that's where god created us to be that's the top of the food chain on this earth and there's nothing that ought to be able to stand before us amen the atoms the the animals didn't tell adam what to do adam told the animals what to do amen the wind didn't didn't have control over adam adam had control over the wind right adam was the the dominating form of life in this entire world amen like i said he ruled by love he wasn't there to abuse or mishandle the animals but if an animal had any inclination to go after adam it was going to pay a price right he wasn't going to allow that brother brahm said it this way he says and when he made man in his own image he had rule over the beast he led the beasts around then like the holy spirit is supposed to lead the church today that's right so remember we're talking about in his form and with his mind so if adam led them around like the holy spirit then we ought to be led around in the same way amen that the holy spirit is supposed to be leading us everyone and so when christ came as a redeemer then you must you must understand that he didn't just redeem our sin sick souls amen that's what i have right now but he came to redeem us back to our position to our inheritance and to our property as well because full redemption when you look at what boaz did with ruth amen he didn't just redeem her person but what did he redeem he redeemed all of her land back and with her land came her posit her position as well amen so we would stop him we'd say well i'm satisfied that he saved my soul but he didn't come to save our soul he came to restore us back to our original inheritance he came to restore us back to our original position into our original place so don't stop there and say well he's given me my soul that's all that matters no he's got so much more for you if you'll just let him open it up to you amen amen at calvary we started on a path that takes us back to our original position and there's nothing that can touch you or harm you on this earth as we've said in the last few services unless god lets you god has put a hedge of protection about you and he only lets things through to train you and to help you grow and mature that's the only reason otherwise satan has no ability to get into you unless you do one thing and what's that get out of the word amen you get out of the word he has full access to you but god still won't let you die god there's nothing he can do god still can protect you because you're his child he's only going to let you go so far scripture says that that it's your you're chastised when you get out of line that's what he does he'll chastise you to get you back in under the word sometimes he'll let satan do the chastising for him doesn't he he lets satan get a hold of you so that you'll realize hey i'm out of his word i got to get back but he'll always bring you back right the son and daughter of god will always be brought back but if you get out that's the only place that satan has full access to you potentially right amen but if you're in the will of god and under the authority god then nothing's supposed to stand before you nothing that's what he said to joshua right nothing will stand before you as long as you're doing what i've told you to do amen that's why i said last service that anyone preaching that we men the fathers the husbands or ministers redeem our families to our or our children is off the word because guess what i'm still in the process of redemption i'm not fully redeemed yet right my soul is redeemed but my body's not redeemed you know how i know that because i'm in a battle every single day in my fully redeemed position i'm not in that amen the earth isn't even fully redeemed yet and that's my position that's my that's my property as well so the earth's not redeemed my body's not redeemed the only thing that's redeemed is my soul so how can i go around redeeming people if i'm not fully redeemed i can't do it i'm still waiting for the full redemption amen jesus said i won't lose a single one that's been put into my hands i i won't lose a single one of them but we're looking to him for redemption not to ourselves amen no matter how good our pastor is no matter how good our father is how full of the holy ghost there they can't redeem us listen look at the very end this is revelations five okay it says and they sung a new song saying who's worthy thou thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for who was slain thou past tense and hast past tense redeemed past tense air us to god by the blood by thy blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation so every person that is redeemed is redeemed by one person and one thing and that is jesus christ and by his blood and blood alone and it doesn't matter if you come from africa if you come from newfoundland if you come from the united states or you come from timbuktu each and every one of us no matter our background is redeemed by one man and that is jesus christ alone amen i don't see myself in revelations 5 9. you know where i see myself revelations 10 8. once he opens the book that's the redemption me reading the title deed is not redeeming that's just me taking what he gave me now he redeemed me now i give it now i'm taking what he said was mine that's the only part that a pastor or a father or a mother or anybody plays in redemption is that we take what he has redeemed and we say i'll have that thank you lord praise the lord i'll take the blessings amen i'll take my position i'll take that baptism of the holy spirit i'll take the leadership of the holy spirit in my life and i'll do what i'll destroy the works of the devil that's what we do you know the only thing the scripture tells us to redeem the time redeem your time because that's what he's given you is he's given you a time on earth and he's given you a body to do his work redeem the time do what he asked you to do amen listen to be a redeemer you've got to know who's first deemed you know it means the deemed to be counted worthy or a part of and listen we can look and we can see especially in the things that have happened over the last 10 or 15 years there's people we thought were deemed and they served the lord for 20 or 30 or 40 years and then they walked away so how do i know who's in and who's out then we saw others that didn't do anything for 20 or 30 40 years and then they came in and they were beautifully saved and they're serving god today hey maybe all the way to their grave i've got to know who's deemed in order to redeem but i don't know who's in and who's out so how can i be a redeemer i could be trying to redeem somebody that's the son of satan and i could be putting out somebody that's a child of god why because in my in my very limited understanding i don't have a clue who's who which is why we treat everyone the same we treat everyone as if they're potentially a son or a daughter of god amen the requirement for redemption is that you're willing able and a kinsmen and guess what i can be willing and i can be a kinsman potentially but you know what i'm not able i can't do it no man was found worthy to open the book amen neither in heaven below the earth on earth nothing and everybody cried because of it so why would we put ourselves in that position this isn't in this church but it's running through some ranks that's why i'm saying it so if you hear it don't believe it amen listen the scripture says that not only they but ourselves which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body we're still waiting for full redemption so how can i be a redeemer i'm not even fully redeemed myself boaz couldn't redeem something if he wasn't already fully redeemed if he didn't have what he needed he couldn't go help somebody else that's right if if he didn't have property or money then how could he redeem somebody that lacked it you got to have what they need in order to redeem them but we don't have it we're still waiting for the fullness of our redemption amen if i'm your redeemer i ought to be able to restore you completely and i can't i can't even restore myself much less you it's a work of him not of ours i said the only thing we're called to redeem when you look in the scriptures especially the new testament the only thing paul says redeem your time amen you know what we don't do that very well even half the time so don't get me started trying to redeem you for some reason amen brother brown said this all things are possible to them that believe we've got the untapped resources of god at our hands to display god we are sons and daughters of god when god made man he made him a god he gave him a dominion over the earth but his fallen estate dropped that but what they lost by adam it was restored by christ and all we are in now is a time right we're in a time of being restored back he's redeemed us but he hasn't taken full possession yet that's it and guess what we haven't taken full possession either it's there potentially potentially there's nothing that we can't do today because what the price has been paid right seals have been open the book is open the word is fully revealed to us all we need to do is what to do and how to do it amen and that's going to be an individual relationship to each and every one of us amen so god had given adam and eve three tasks god put a guiding principle around the kingdom and it was the key to their stain and their place in their position amen they could stay in that perfect eden for eternity if they listened to what he said in genesis 2 god says this and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now you'll see here if you look quickly at 18 i won't read it just yet but god said this to adam eve was not yet created in body form he said it to adam so the original command was was given to adam by god directly now we don't know maybe what god shared it with eve when she was put into a body later you know when they were walking in the cool of the evening each night and these different things and i'm sure adam shared it with her because she knew she knew god had said it but he adam was the one to hear it directly from god for the very first time and then after that it says in the lord god said it's not good that the man should be alone i will make of him and help meet for him amen now i i always think a little bit about what they thought about this because you've got to realize that in perfect love there's no fear like we preached on recently right there's no fear so god says the day you eat there after you'll surely die and they're probably saying what is dying because die is an end die is a separation from god it's an end of fellowship and they can't even comprehend that because perfect love casts that out there's not even a comprehension of what this means to die they can't even grasp the idea of not having god in their life so in a way it's an empty threat to them because they don't comprehend it but yet god has said it and however something bad can exist in perfect love they understood don't do this because something's going to happen that you won't like right something's going to happen that you don't like and we know that adam took that because he couldn't be corrupted by the serpent and brother brahm says it many times the serpent couldn't get to adam as a direct son of god as a part of the original creation he couldn't get to adam so he had to go after eve right why because adam had a direct line to god he heard it from god he knew his purpose he knew his place and adam knew that he was in a position of dominion that's the first thing that eve messed up on was she started letting something that was under her dominion speak to her as an equal listen if a pair came up to me and said did god really say you can't eat the fruit of that tree what would i say go back to eating birdseed that wasn't for you it was for me so what do you care and yet people will come up to us and they'll challenge us on what we believe and they'll say you don't really believe that a woman shouldn't cut her hair and you don't really think that god means in this day and age that you have to wear dresses you sisters and your brothers that you shouldn't go around and have all these worldly hairstyles and are you serious do you think that's what god really cares about god looks at the heart man why why would you why would you take on these laws to yourself what is it it's not for them i'm not saying they're under our dominion but i'm saying they don't have a nature in them like we do they don't have a call in their life they don't have a sea gene of god and so they're speaking from total ignorance i saw somebody post something the other day in a a a person i know commented on it and they said that god had absolutely uh put abortion in the bible as something that was okay and they put down scriptures that had nothing to do with it and they completely misinterpreted why because they don't have a clue what the scriptures mean they probably went to some site by another unbeliever that looked up things in the bible and said this is what it means and then they copied it and they put it down and now they believe that god thinks abortion is okay because what somebody that has no relationship with god went into the bible and misinterpreted something right so if a parent comes up to me and starts trying to talk about the word i'm not going to say much to the parent am i i'm going to say parrot go back to the bird cage it's not for you but yet a serpent comes to eve a serpent that is under her dominion that is under her foot that is not on an equal plane comes up and starts trying to discuss the word with her and what does she do she listens she doesn't take dominion over it she says let's engage in a conversation right now listen we're trying to have the mind of christ and adam and eve were given it but it only got corrupted and eve and i'm not picking on the women because guess what each and every one of us fits into this because we are the woman type we are the bride of christ so men and women both included are are here amen the men didn't do anything you know we're not anything great and the woman are horrible right we're all in a fallen condition okay but listen what the prophet of god says watch the corruption of the woman's mind he says in the beginning it started off like this it's the way we've got it right today and it hasn't changed a bit adam was a believer satan was an unbeliever he did not believe the word so he got eve who was not sure whether it was right or not see satan the unbeliever god said the day you eat thereof the day you die satan said that's not right see and he didn't believe it and adam did believe it so he worked on the one that was in between she just couldn't tell she wasn't convinced one way or another now i want you to recognize something because apparently she never discussed this with adam right she got out from what her place with her husband he had unified her and adam right she didn't even have a name there she was adam same as he was adam that was one unity and she got away from her unity and started having fellowship with something that was outside of her species and was outside of her nature right and guess what when god came down in the evening she never said hey god got this weird conversation happening with that serpent guy what do i do what did she do she started hiding her relationship from her husband and her god you think god didn't know of course he knew right but adam apparently didn't know and she hid what she was doing from her what her god if we have to hide it it's wrong it's very simple if i have to hide something i'm doing for my wife guess what it ain't right i don't care what i can say about it or what i can do about it or how harmless i say it is if i can't share that with my spouse it's wrong flat out had a man say one time is his wife went to take his phone and and uh and he said no you can't look at that and he said to another person that i know he says right and the other person said no she definitely can look at your phone she's your wife there shouldn't be anything on there that she couldn't see he says no no it's my phone guess what there was something he was hiding from his wife on that phone guaranteed because why else would you care right half the time with black i'll say will you pick that up or can you find this or whatever you know we don't care why we all have the same passwords there's nothing hidden why because we're not trying to hide there's nothing going on that the other person can't know about but we see here the first thing she did was she hid the conversation from her husband right so satan focuses on those that he perceives as weak now listen he's going to try everyone not one of us is going to get away from satan probing to try and get us to have the conversation right but once you have the conversation he knows there's a weakness there and then he'll start going he'll start trying to continue with that in the garden of eden satan come along and said to eve he said you should take the fruit of the tree she said but the lord said not he says oh now surely you'll not die see he knowed as long as people stayed fortified he says this is what we're supposed to stay fortified by is the word now i want to stop here and say something because last service i read a quote where brother brown said we're all individuals we're all made different we shouldn't try and take anybody's place do you remember that but then he says one thing he says but we're all guarded by the word so with all of the differences we have in here race color language gender skills strengths weaknesses he says but we're all guarded by the word in other words we're all supposed to be guarded by the word and we're all supposed to stay in the word regardless of what we have as a strength or a weakness so just because you're not weak in an area doesn't mean you should go out and dabble right you want if the word says don't do it you don't do it no matter how strong you are right you want to stay under the word you want to stay guarded by the word amen don't think that something doesn't apply to you just because you're strong because guess what you get out from under the word you'll never stand you'll never stand because there's no protection out there you're going to fall back to what the arm of flesh and the arm of flesh will always fail you right listen always god when god provides he provides the best do you believe that this morning do you believe he's given you the best so will you use it will you stay there will you stay there then if you believe it's the best then will you stay there and will you use only what he gives you when god provided a way to fortify his church he provided the best when he gave adam and eve in the garden of eden what he gave them was his word you stay behind this word and you're safe but if you get from out of it the day you eat thereof is the day you die he says god has never changed his strategy and what do we see today we see people changing strategy and they add in what psychology and they add in politics and they add in influence and they add in money and they add in this and that and the other thing what have they done they've changed the word of god into what something without power because you can't give it everything you're trying to pull back to yourself he says and satan so god never changed his strategy and satan has never changed his how he got into adam and eve he gets them today why by trying to reason it out now it's reasonable that god would not oh god has said said satan but surely a holy god won't do this brother brahm says surely he will why because he said he would god doesn't god is not a man that he should lie the scripture says right there's no shadow or variableness of turning right he does not change he doesn't do things one and make sure that your testimony matches the words that you were trying to convince them with amen but after two times he says just walk away because what you're just going to keep more judgment on them right that's all you're going to do and you're going to cause more disagreement so he says just do it remember what he said to the disciples he says if you go to a town and they don't accept you what do you do or you go to a home he says you walk out you wipe the dust from that home off your off your feet and you walk and you don't look back why there wasn't anything there to receive it guess what the the the children of god are always in the minority we're not going to have a big church we're not going to have massive groups none of these things remember brother branham talked about billy graham he says they go there and you get ten thousand you come back and you might have ten right that's the world right that's what we're looking at these days amen but eve got into trouble when she started conversing with a bean that was under her dominion amen that was not at an equal playing field with her that was not of the same lineage or nature that was not of the same bloodline amen she started to have that conversation and what drew her to having that conversation curiosity wonder how do i make this happen i'm supposed to be fruitful and multiplying and it ain't happening this guy's telling me a way to do it i'm interested stick with the word that's what she was supposed to do amen listen have you got friends or acquaintances and they want to challenge your belief of the word of god what do you do once or twice and then you walk away amen remember we covered that in the services before that if if they don't if they can't take the the brief amount that you do and that's all it's supposed to be your personal testimony you can cover some basics i believe every believer should be able to say repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and receive the holy ghost we ought to be able to tell somebody how to get saved beyond that brother brahm says what do you do you point him to a minister of the gospel he says because it's hard enough for them to keep it straight much less you and guess what if somebody really wants the truth they'll go talk to a minister right but if they want to win an argument they won't because you're good for an argument the minister won't handle that he'll say listen you want to argue go ahead i'll i'll answer your questions but i'm not here to argue with you and neither are we supposed to do the same thing amen second corinthians 6 says be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness listen when that serpent first started talking to eve she should have said whoa this is not a conversation that i should be having this is not a place i should be this is not a person i should be around and she should have just walked away what the prophet of god say when satan knocks at your door what don't even open the door and if he approaches you outside of your home what do you do walk away just walk away don't even start the conversation she didn't do it and what communion had light with darkness that includes marriage obviously that's the first thing we look at this but it includes friendship and fellowship right somebody that has the right spirit that maybe hasn't come as far as you they're gonna be okay for a while right because they're sir maybe they're searching for more they're seeking for more but somebody that has made up their mind you're never going to get anywhere with them and guess what you're going to get dragged down they're not going to be lifted up why because it takes the holy spirit to lift somebody up right but it doesn't take the holy spirit to drag somebody down right and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement had the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god had said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord god almighty the prophet preached that sermon god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen a total separation he says if one word got us out nothing less than the full word will bring us back amen he's looking for people that will stay there amen don't fellowship with unbelief occasionally occasional is going to hurt you it's not going to help them don't fellowship you can meet with people listen we just spend time with family down in california most of them unbelievers guess what that's okay you've got to be able to to deal with that but you don't fellowship you don't create friendships with unbelief why because if they don't accept your testimony and your word up front then guess what the one that's coming down is you they're not coming up right that's what paul says listen you can do it for a short amount but then walk away because it's not going to do them any good and it's definitely not going to do you right you don't have to challenge yourself with facing up to unbelief satan will do that right for you satan will bring unbelief to your door you don't have to go looking for satan for that sort of a thing amen eve lost eternal life dominion and fellowship with god as soon as she got out from under that word and acted on that unbelief because remember what brother brown said sin is he says unbelief he says the act is just a symptom of the unbelief that you had in the first place and she disbelieved and then that caused her to act and it pulled her out from her position amen listen paul said it to this way and he's talking now to us the gentiles he says for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband he's engaged us to one husband christ that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ you know what that word chaste means means it hasn't played around with other men hasn't flirted around with other men hasn't dabbled with other men hasn't tried other relationships before we come to this he says what she stayed clean and true to him all the way through that's why we don't dabble in those things he says but i fear lest by any means as a serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety that where beguile is it implies seduction charming into deception so it's not going to be obvious what's being offered up front when you when you see you know when they talk about seduction when it when a man or a woman cheats on their spouse or something like that it is never obvious up front what they're looking for and a lot of times what they're looking for and what they get are two very different things they're seduced into thinking that something's going to be supplied or offered and what they get in the end is used right because that's what a seducer does is he uses you by offering you what you think you want but he thinks you think you're he's going to give you what you want but you don't get that you get what he wants and that's never good for you right i fear by lest any means as a serpent beguiled or seduced eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ the word simple the word is simple the scripture says in isaiah 35 and then highway shall be there and away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall now pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not air therein listen it's not rocket science it's not rocket science hattie wright wasn't a rocket scientist but she said that ain't nothing but the truth and she got the salvation of her two sons and then it's not rocket science but it is a heart that looks at that and says that applies to me now here's the thing and i'm going to give a personal negative testimony here in a moment we accept the word simplicity when it's easy or when it agrees with our situation humanly speaking when it's easy or when it agrees with our situation we love to stand behind the word and we love to take the word and say yes i'm standing there but the minute it starts to hit our wallets it starts to hit our careers it starts to hit our families it starts to hit our finances then what do we do we start to sit there and we start to wrangle it to see if we can find a way to make it somehow easier for us or fit our our situation or fit the decision that we want to make is that just me or is okay i'm going to tell you a story when we were in california we had to rent a vehicle to go to mexico okay now through a very long story that i'm not going to share but suffice to say we weren't planning to do it and it was a huge unexpected expense it was over twelve hundred dollars for us to rent this this this vehicle to go down there now the beautiful thing was this is that i had personal insurance through my vehicle insurance and then i had double coverage because my credit card gives me coverage as well so i had double insurance on this vehicle so that i wouldn't have to pay the insurance coverage fees which can be fairly high so we walk in there we've already made the reservation we walk in and right on the wall is the word for avis and it says if you take this vehicle into mexico which is what we were going to do you must buy our special insurance for mexican travel now that's black and white isn't it that's black and white there's there's no there's no uh you know optional ways to get out of that it says if you're going to take this to mexico you have to get our special insurance for mexico okay does anybody disagree that there's any black that there's any any way of getting around that if you take this vehicle and you take it to mexico you got to buy our insurance but you know what i sat there and tried 17 ways past sunday to make that say if you have double coverage you don't have to pay 60 for insurance a day that's what i did because i'm thinking in my head there's no damage to them if i lose the vehicle because i've got double coverage on it if it gets damaged i've got double coverage no matter what happens to that vehicle i've got it covered so it shouldn't matter whether or not i get their insurance but guess what the minute i took their vehicle i was agreeing to their terms right so what does that mean i got to get their insurance doesn't it and guess what i walked away without getting their insurance and everybody's faith and brother jonathan fell but before i got that vehicle i walked right back down and said i'm sorry i'm going to mexico i should have told you i need coverage for a week and that cost me an extra 400 bucks so our rental cost was almost 1700 that we hadn't planned you think i wanted to spend that money but guess what the holy spirit won't let a child of god do something like that now what was it i was trying to wrangle in my mind because i didn't want to have to spend an additional 400 odd dollars on something that i was already spending too much money for what was i doing i was trying to make that word turn into what i wanted it to mean and what did i say it'll never hurt them they'll never know right i was trying to make it work for me not for them but as soon as i took that vehicle i was saying i'm i'm going to abide by your rules for this vehicle so i was bound to do it and i did it by god's grace and i asked him to forgive me for even walking away the first time because i should have said it up front but we're sitting there and i'm stewing because it's late and they've been long and dead to death and then even more money and i'm like are you kidding me what and i let the situation overcome me to where i said their word doesn't apply to me and i was wrong i was wrong but we do the same thing and let me tell you this the minute you sit in your mind and you try and wrangle with what the word says i'll tell you right now you're wrong because the word brings rest and it brings clarity and if you got to sit there and wrangle is this right or wrong what did brother braham say if there's a question don't don't try and argue yourself into saying that the word allows me to do it he says if there's any question don't you have brothers right in and say brother branham can i do this or can i do that he says if you're asking then don't because something in you if you've got the holy ghost is saying don't do it so don't even try and find a way through just stay away from it amen amen amen that's my testimony for the week don't be like don't be like me in that situation right right don't try and wrangle the word to suit your situation amen what is it a christian is held accountable to the word in every aspect of their life a true son a true daughter of god is going to be held accountable and i don't know if something would have happened maybe if i'd have taken that vehicle down there under my insurance maybe nothing would have happened and all i would have to do deal with is is a conscience that would have bothered me the whole time and i wouldn't have enjoyed a single day and that would have been my payment right that might have been my price but maybe it would have got stolen or wrecked and something would have happened and i would have been denied coverage and all of a sudden i got to buy a 50 000 suv right i wasn't willing to do that because god chastises his sons when they get out of line i'd rather pay the money than get chastised i'd rather do it the first time next time maybe amen listen we read this quote we started this quote and i wanted to finish it earlier he says see we are surrounded by the word the word is in you god in you around you wherever you go it's the word the word keep him always before you remember be conscious of him everywhere listen i knew what i was supposed to do in that situation i was conscious of what i was supposed to do and what did i do i ignored it don't do that he says be conscious of him always around you now when adam and eve walk like that there was no death the man or the woman that walks like that now there is no death to them they've got eternal life when you're surrounded and kept by the word it's the only place of refuge we have it's the only place we know we're safe is when we're in the word because if you're in the word then nothing can come against it nothing can stand before it amen what you've lost christ is redeemed back to us amen we don't have it all now but he's redeemed it and he's restoring us back to it he's restoring it back to us even as we could say it amen we have eternal life and we have fellowship with him guess what there is no barrier between god and i know you know the only barrier this this flesh that's the only barrier but it doesn't have to stop me just means i might have to fight through not i might i do right i have to fight through i've got to put the time in i've got to put the effort in i've got to get past the distractions i've got to redeem my time but that's the only thing that holds me back from fellowship is this stinking flesh right here right because the soul has a clear connection because it's the same thing that his is right so holy spirit gives us a clear direction between those amen brother brown says notice he separated even adam and she fell adam went with her now adam was not deceived eve was deceived but adam the first adam was god's son also and he went out because of the love of eve to try to bring her back because he loved her christ did the same thing to redeem her back what the bride amen what to redeem her back to the word what caused the fall the word disbelieving the word disbelieving all the word and christ come now listen to this christ come that he might become one of us his life in us to continue the word amen oh you're saying brother jonathan who didn't stop with but with jesus didn't stop with paul it didn't stop with the apostles didn't stop with brother branham absolutely not he says he came down and came one of us with his life in us to continue the word the unveiling of the word the manifestation of the word the revealing of the word all the way through to eternity we said last time brother branham said it in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today forever he takes us back to hebrews 13 8. and he ties in what that the word was with us and the word was in us and then he says he's in us again today and hebrews 13 7 says what look at the men around you and if they have the life of christ then follow them if they have the life of what jesus christ is saying yesterday today forever that was the qualifications of the ministry to have a life like christ's we ought to have the same thing today amen the prophet of god pointed us away back to the restoration of our minds to the form of god in a bride as eve was in the form of adam right it's the same thing he says and she can be the bride of christ you can be the bride of christ not you can be you are the bride of christ and remember she being a part of a man the bible said nevertheless i suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp any authority but be in silence for adam was first form and then eve and adam was not deceived but the byproduct was deceived notwithstanding she shall be saved as she continues in holiness and sobriety and in childbearing and all such because then she becomes a part of this man now we could easily get offended by that as women today if we're looking at our natural husbands but brother branham says that was a type of christ and the bride and the bride is saved what if she is united with a man and continues in holiness and sobriety and childbearing and such in other words if she takes the life of her husband inside of her and it produces something that is visible to the rest of the world if she continues in it not just once not just one day not just one week not just one year of faithfulness but if she continues in her relationship with the word of life then she's saved amen he says why didn't god kill sarah sitting right there denying and lying right in the face of god sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk and he said why did sarah laugh back there in the back behind him in the tent he had never seen her saying this how can these things be she said well i never said it oh my tell god that he's a liar to his face but he couldn't take her why she's a part of abraham amen he couldn't hurt her without hurting abraham so what's he saying he's saying church sometimes we call him a liar to his face sometimes we say how can it be in this flesh how can it be in my family how can it be in this fallen condition and he says you ought to be judged you ought to be killed for your unbelief but because you're a part of christ because you continue in your relationship with christ because you're true to him he can't kill you because you are a part of him and if he killed you he'd be killing him he says he can't do it because there's a uniting time amen and there's a uniting sign and what is it it's the life of christ within you amen what was it now he's pointing to the bride's position in their place placed by type and saying that he can't kill the one that's tied to the man that's sinless to the one that believes if she's tied to him he can't touch her because she's a part of him there's a unity there and then there's a oneness there that can't be broken amen the reason she can't be judged the reason she can't be destroyed is because she's a part of him amen now the secret to that is you always were you weren't outside and brought in it you always were you were taken out and now you're bringing back in but you always were a part of him amen you want the mind of christ there's an easy way for you get the life of god in you and then stay behind the word amen amen i've been listening to you must be born again and brother branham said this is what we're dealing with in the message i believe is he says you can take a creed and say i believe a creed i believe a man i believe william branham and i believe what he said he says that is not the new birth he says you can even apply the word and that's not the new birth because why the pharisees applied the word every day of their life their lives were untouchable concerning the law that's what paul said concerning the law i was perfect but he wasn't perfect he just thought he was perfect but concerning the law visibly on the outside he said not even applying the word is it he says the new birth is an experience with god individually so you can sit here and apply the word you can apply the message you can believe it all day long and he says that's not it and he's preaching it why because he says we've turned it into so many different things he said i could go to every church and they tell me a different thing about what the new birth is he says i'm going to tell you what the new birth is and he starts out by saying it's on experience with god not just with god but it's an experience of god in you amen amen amen that's it what did brahms say he said keep the word in front of you keep the word behind you keep the word around you keep the word in front of you keep it inside of you that's it that's the new birth the word inside of you we are the word made flesh today that is what the scriptures say that's what the song says amen that's what we're looking at he says keep the word in front of you all the time look at this he says now we remember that by this holy spirit we are brought into the body of christ and free from the judgment of god this is from the message abraham is seated after him we cannot come into judgment after you are in christ because christ took the judgment for you he stood in the place just like adam now adam was not deceived deceived he knowed exactly what he was doing but eve was deceived and she thought that what she was doing was right that's the sad thing about it was she thought that what she was doing was right it was the opposite of what god said but he had so twisted her mind to where she thought she was doing the right thing satan gave her about 95 pure gospel but that other five percent was enough to throw that off he said so we've got to be not just part gospel we've got to be full gospel we've got to have the entire word for the antichrist is a part gospel preacher we know that and his works are part gospel amen the antichrist spirit is what religious it has political aspects it has economic aspects but its main appearance is absolutely religious and it is what to take the power of god out of the word and replace it with men's dogmas and ideas and influence amen it tries to bring all sorts of things into religion and we see it in the world today everybody's preaching on everything except the word nobody's preaching the word and the power of the word all they're doing is preaching what politics is bringing out that's where we're at where all we're preaching over the pulpit is is the latest political divisions in the countries right that's not the gospel it's nothing to do with the gospel jesus jesus didn't get tied up in any of it in fact he gave him answers opposite of what most of them would have said what they say the soldiers uh we don't get paid very much what should we do he says be happy with your wages well us jews if a roman asks us we got to walk with him a while a mile what do we do he says walk two officers if they take my coat what do i do give him my cloak holes give him your claw castle he always went opposite with what conventional you know theory was for that day or or righting wrongs or making you know all these different things he said i'm not here to do this i'm not here to free this i'm not here to to change this i'm here to change you i'm here to restore you back to eden not to fix your political systems amen what is it the simplicity of the gospel is what paul pointed us to i like simple and i like black and white i'm a black and white personality as most of you know amen but i know when i'm getting off the word when i do what i start arguing with myself and i start trying to twist those things amen the good news is this you want the gospel the good news is this you come from god you're going to god he has a purpose for you and all he's asking you to do is let go and let him have his way amen that's it that's the gospel for the for the for the bride of this age he's got a plan he's got a purpose you're a part of him and all he's asking you to do is let him in so he can use you empty yourself out let him in and he'll take care of the rest that's the gospel for this day that's how simple it is let go and let god have his way amen god bless you let's stand together this morning amen thank you jesus i'm thankful for this message i'll tell you not the one i just preached i'm thankful for the message that we can go to to give us clarity in these things you know because it can get so twisted these days with the things that are out there like i said the politics of today you can get caught up in the rights and the wrongs and the do's and the don'ts and the ifs and the ifs watson buts right i was talking to some of some of my my extended family down there and they're asking questions and i would say that's a that's an unfair question it says you're asking me to answer and that's you're not giving me the right answer you're asking me to make a choice between two things that are neither one correct i said i'll tell you what i believe but i can't give you the answer you're looking for why because as a believer they don't have our solutions they don't have a word answer for anything what they've got is a left and a right and guess what neither one of those is the word guess what the middle is not the word some of the some word answers are right on the right side some word answers are on the left side and some of them are right in the middle of where they believe right now so we don't get into that amen you know what the answer is the answer is not by forcing people to not have abortions the answer is not by forcing people because all that's doing is pointing them to a law but we're pointing them to what a changed life what paul said such were some for some of you guess what the the answer to homosexuality is not don't be a homosexual let's get in love with christ and let him deliver you from that amen whether it's lying whether it's cheating whether it's stealing whatever it is our conversations our way of life the way we do things the answer is get into christ it is not stop doing it because you'll just stop doing it for a while and then you'll fall right back into the ditch again but if you can get into christ a life lived a life changed then guess what you've got the answer that we're looking for that's why that's why we preach a gospel we don't preach against something we preach for something which is come to christ and let him change you we're not even supposed to come into church change people that's how we get hypocrites when we try and change ourselves to make ourselves worthy but when we can come to him and say i need you i was reading a quote where brother braham says as soon as adam and eve as soon as they sinned he says they should have been running crying out to god saying lord lord we've messed up we've sinned we did it and you told us not to he says but what did they do they hid and they made a false religion to cover themselves and he had to go looking for them i want to be the one that screams lord i made a mistake lord i didn't pay for the insurance the way i should have be running straight to him and saying lord will you change me help me to do better next time and help me to be a reflection of you in this life amen amen amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord we face an uphill battle in these bodies that we've been given lord in our carnal minds lord in the desires of our flesh lord we're always at war with it the lord paul told us that we're supposed to keep it under submission lord that by the power of your word and by the indwelling holy spirit we're supposed to keep it under us lord that we're supposed to keep it under control lord and i believe that only comes through a relationship with you they're not just a one-time event a one-time baptism lord a one-time infilling but lord it's a daily a weekly lord dwelling with you and spending time with you and lord we see what happens when we get away from you we see what happened with eve lord when she lord isolated herself from her husband and from the fellowship of god and didn't open herself up lord and lord we pray that we wouldn't get to that place lord but that everything we do and say will be open before you lord that where we get off the path we come back quickly and say lord help me not to do it again lord for we want to be lights in this evil age lord we don't want to be hidden under a bushel lord but we want to be up on a hilltop lord people can see the light and be drawn to it lord would you grant us grace and favor lord give us strength for the battle lord give us humility for ourselves and for each other lord that we would lay ourselves before your word lord and ask it to have its way in us lord just bless your people now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask him amen amen can we sing that song touch your people once again i don't have the number i'm sorry touch you do we know that do we know the verse okay do we know the verse i know it's some of us do
