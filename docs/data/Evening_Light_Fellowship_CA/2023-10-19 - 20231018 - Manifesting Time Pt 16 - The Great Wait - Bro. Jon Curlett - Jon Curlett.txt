Christ Lord but we know we're in a battle Lord we know we're in a time of trying and testing Lord we know we're in a place where everything is arrayed against us Lord but your word has declared Lord that we are the Overcomer of the age but Lord Lord we need you in our life Lord we need you in every aspect Lord every door open Lord every access granted Lord that you would come in and fill our lives with your word Lord that your Holy Spirit would drive out every bit of Darkness Lord every bit of fear Lord every bit of unrest Lord that your your your peace and your presence would just be so satisfying to us Lord that we'd have no desire for anything else Lord we're praying Lord that you would satisfy us once again this evening Lord by the feeding of your word Lord speak to your people encourage us strengthen us Lord instruct us correct us where we need it Lord get us in alignment Lord get us into position Lord give us a hunger and a desire and a thirst Lord beyond what we've ever had Lord that we would call on your name that we'd be an expectation Lord for the moving of the holy spirit in our lives and situations Lord God lord would you just grant it tonight we pray Lord asking your grace for those that aren't here Lord the many needs Lord Jesus we pray your grace to each one in your your name we're asking it amen amen God bless you each one turn if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 amen God bless you it's good to be here tonight and good to have sister Moren and brother Mark back and they came and a bunch of people left amen but we're glad to have each one that could make it I know Raphael is sick tonight and so pray for him and sister Priscilla of course without brother Joe there it's always tough with a with a sick child so praying Grace and I spoke to the mighty Hunters today and they haven't uh been able to harvest anything but they did see one moose so uh they chased her and I guess my only question is did you chase her or did you chase her with a bullet because the bullet's the only thing that's going to work in those situations but anyways they're they finally saw an animal after some pretty bad weather the last few days so just keep them in prayer and I think brother Bob mentioned sister Erica Parker as well which is brother Donnie Reagan's daughter that passed away and she had two 18-year-old girls and two 16-year-old girls and then of course a husband as well so we want to remember that family in prayer and I mean honestly at 18 and 16 that's Grace that they got that far she's had a a troubled life she's had a lot of health issues through her life and and whatnot but uh just praying God to be with them amen that's a that's a tough thing to bury your child so we pray God will just Comfort them and be very real amen he's a he's a very present help in a ton time of trouble he's a comforter and uh and this is when they're really going to need it amen second Peter 1 very familiar scripture given we've been reading it every service verse four says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing again the series on manifesting time and I want to take take a title of the great weight amen the great weight not weig g HT but W AIT T the great weight and we're speaking on this great attribute of patience and as I was studying on this I kind of thought of the great race we run as Believers and it is a race Paul said we're running a race and yet this race has a lot of walking and it has a lot of standing still and it has a lot of waiting as well amen so I thought that as I just take that title of the great weight because so often we're racing but we're not racing ahead but rather it's a distance it's an endurance event and that's really where patience comes into it brother Brandon would start off in the Statue of a perfect man and he would say then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you've got faith it worketh patience the Bible said he says now that's the next thing is going to build this stature and then he says you know God has got real material in his building and brother Bron would say time and time again he talk about that Blackbird that was taking peacock feathers and putting it in and he says that's not going to ever work as soon as you put it in any sort of wind as soon as you try and fly as soon as you try and replicate what a peacock is it'll fall off because it's not a part of you and he's saying here God's got real material in his building you know I spent a lot of time of course as an engineer with materials and you'll find out that there's a specification that's required for every design and to make sure they get the right material they test it and there's a quality assurance and there's a there's a package that comes with every piece of material to prove that that material is exactly that's as good or better than what you asked for and God's doing the same thing with this building is that he's building us into something that's using real materials you know if you ever have replaced a part you know I work on my car sometimes and if you've ever taken a part that's broken and it'll last you 100 or 150,000 km and then because we want to save money we go and we buy a cheap part that's a half the price of the original part and we stick it in the car and it breaks after 20,000 km you know why cuz it's not built to the original specification it's not the real deal if they didn't put the care into it that the original designer did and so the part fails even sooner than the original does why because it doesn't have the real material they didn't know what they had to put into it and it's the same thing with God God's not going to let us sit there and just say we are it or we've got it God's going to prove the material that's in the building of the Tabernacle that he wants to inhabit in our lives he says see how short we are brother and sister see where we're at we have glories we have shouts and things because we've got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things the glories the shouts and things he says but we fall and we slide off with it see he can't build his church brother B would say time and time not just in this message but in many others he says you can't fake your Christianity you can't fake it you can you can ex you can try and present it and you can try and testify of it and you can try and talk it and you can try and walk it but when the rubber meets the road when the hard times come then the fake and the make believer always fall apart they always do because there's nothing real to hold up they're not built of the right stuff amen and the scripture tells us that the trials of this life are more precious to us than gold because they prove who God is and they prove who we are at the same time and we get to see what he's doing in our life and we get to see that we've actually got what we believe we've got you know we've got a life full of Faith Like brother BR would say we've got all this Faith but until that faith is tested is it really Faith how do we know what we believe until our faith is put to the test test and brother BR would tie the trying of our faith to patience and he would tie to that scripture now that word patience means endurance steadfastness constancy perseverance the ability to remain without changing regardless of circumstance and we know that this whole thing that we're talking about these the statue of a perfect man is a building process and we start on the foundation of faith and we have virtue and knowledge and Temperance like we spoke on last service but now we come to patience and brother BR would say this patience is not just built on but it's tied to something you have before so if you don't and say it's faith and if you don't have faith you can't have patience without the faith then the patience isn't going to work so how do we know we've got patience in this Earthly Tabernacle James would say this he says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations this is going to be one of those Services we love but I'm looking for the day where I can have joy in the trial rather than after the trial because so often what happens is we come to the end and God comes through and we finally see the big picture and then we shout and we praise and we have our Hallelujah moment James says we're supposed to be doing that in the midst of the trial why because you're a child of God and God works all things for your good so when you're in the middle of it it's doing something to you it's preparing that material it's making you to the specification that God wants you to be and you can rejoice because you're going to come out better than you went in you'll come out purer than you went in you'll come out stronger than you went in you'll come out more fit for service than you went in and you can Rejoice because he's building you up now sometimes he's got to take you out he's got to strip those impurities out he's got to put you through a process a purifying process that makes you more qualified than before but James says we're supposed to be in joy in the midst of the trial what an attitude that ought to be as a believer that when we're going through we can say praise the Lord he's working on me he says knowing this this is why we're joyful he says that the Trine of your PA Faith worketh patience that word worketh means it brings out or it produces or approves patience so the trying of your faith produces patience but what happens with that patience he says but let patience have her perfect work oh there's a perfect affection that comes with patience it does the whole thing it doesn't let you out unfinished it doesn't let you out before the process has had its full effect it says let patience have our perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I want to be to the place where I want nothing where he has given me everything that I need for this journey through life that means I've got to have patience and then I've got to let patience do its work let it have its effect patience is built on faith and James would tie the trying and testing of your faith to producing and then proving patience that tells me that if I try to go through a trial without faith I'll never have patience because Faith produces patience but if I just try and say oh yeah I've got patience but I don't have faith that God has called me to go through it then I'm going to fall short every single time but I've got to know that sons of God are led by the spirit of God and that if he's led me into it then there's going to be patience to take me all the way through there's a faith behind it amen otherwise I'm going to get overwhelmed I'm going to get run over I'm just going to get flattened by the situation and I'll be sitting there on the sideline saying I thought I was a Believer no I've got to have a revelation of who I am and I've got to have a revelation that I'm in the will of God brother Braham says we need more Revelation what Revelation that it's for our good Revelation that he's in the situation let's take it to a couple examples that brother Brown would preach on he would say in Hebrews he'd reference this he says for when God made promised to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself sh saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and then so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise now there's a trend we're going to see in scripture God gives the promise you endure and then you get the promise promise there's a gap between what he says and when he does it so I you know I hate not hate but I apologize maybe for bringing up Abraham in so many of these things because Abraham makes us groan every time we preach on him because everything took long for Abraham 25 years to get the core promise that God had promised him and he never got to see the fullness he got to see the start but he didn't get to see the Finish we look at Joseph and Joseph goes through years and years and years of trial before the vision comes to pass and I don't want to make you think that everything takes a long time like that not everything takes decades but God does have a gap between the start and the finish and the Gap is the trial of our faith and the trial of our faith produces patience to get us to the end that's what we're talking about you know I I'm so happy today I'm not in University I'm so happy that I've I've passed all my professional exams I'm so happy of that last day I wrote that last 8 Hour exam in Texas and then I walked out knowing that I had in all probability passed and I would never never have to write another test in this life but before I did that test I had six years of engineering school and as I was going through that you write a lot of tests and you're you're you're you're poorest Church mice you're driving an old rusty Volkswagen Golf you you're you're scrimping by on everything and you look around and you can see people that don't give that that that that sacrifice and they're going and they're going and getting jobs and they're going on vacations and they're buying homes and they're buying vehicles and they don't have to scrimp and save and you say why is it they get that and I'm stuck doing this but I've made the choice to go through the trial because there's something at the end that I consider to be worth more than what they've got without going through that trial so I go had to go through all those things and it was what to get me to a place where I am today whereby God's grace we can live on a single income income my wife doesn't have to work where I've got good job prospects that's the grace of God don't get me wrong I'm not putting anything on myself but I'm pointing to the trial and the patience that I had to go through while seeing others prosper in the way that they chose while I stayed poor what trusting that the riches and the reward would catch up in the end and it would be as good or better than what they have received I did it with purpose and we've got to look at our Christian walk the same way that we're going to choose to stay with the word and it's going to test us and it's going to try us but we're doing it because we know that there's a reward at the end there's a benefit and what is it it's it's a perfect character of Christ and me it's the very Life of Christ that's going through us but I had to see that that that the endurance of the testing was going to end at some point to know because if somebody told me to be an engineer you have to go the rest of your life and testing I would have said that's not worth it the stress isn't worth it but I knew if I put in my six years and then a year or two after that then it would all be done and I could relax more or less and just cruise through my career with the same basic stresses of everyone else but the testing would really be over but that was me having to prove that I could go through it but God does it a different way because God says I've called you and I've chosen you and he gives us a word that lets us see the guarantee of the end before we ever go through the test and man we get to you remember that old Cathedral Song they'd sing I've read the back of the book and we win we've read the book and we won not we will win we've already won it's a finished work but there's a trial in between that's going to have patience involved in us and we've got to stay the course because we've read the book and we believed it enough to let it change our lives to live our lives according to it amen his patience will take us through to the end but it's one thing to read it it's another to believe it enough to let it have an effect in your life brother B would say this he's talking about patience now he says patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God he says if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign but he was still believing he was patient with God Abraham had a special kind of patience because every year he could see his body deteriorating he could see himself getting older he could see Sarah getting older and more frail and get to the point where she's 89 and he's 99 and still there's no change that's a special kind of patience that he had but he was still believing the prophet of God says but now if we take it over to Noah which is the second example brother Brown takes Noah's building an ark for 120 years and Noah's patience is first in his commission it does he believe that God met him that God spoke to him and that he heard the literal voice of God and that God gave him a plan so for 120 years Noah's tested will you stay with it even though people are making fun of you you're losing friends maybe you're losing family you're you're you're ridiculed by so many people you're on the evening news on a regular basis will you stay true to it but watch brother brandham takes it now even further because he says Noah had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy this world with rain and Noah preached 120 years yet plenty of patience and not even Dew fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years but he was patient he was patient for 127 years he says and then God tries your patience God knows how to tighten the screws what's he doing he's making real material and then he's proven it's the real deal cuz having tested for Noah for 120 years now he tests him all over again he he says that's right God tries them after he told Noah now he said Noah I want you to go ahead get in the ark I'm going to run the animals in there and I want you to get in I want you to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them he says what was the first sign Noah got in the ark there's got to come a day where it's not just words but our life is on the line our kids are on the line our careers are on the line our finances are on the line well Whole Hog in right fully committed see while he was building it he could walk away but God said you get in and then I'll shut the door and there ain't no getting out after that you got to stay with the word you're going to live or die by your decision to get into that Ark and he had to stay in that Ark and listen we see the ridicule that he went through he says there wasn't no rain Noah got ready got the rain coat on and everything so he could look out once in a a while he got ready but the next day he says I believe he might have told his family and his daughter-in-laws and all them said oh my tomorrow you're going to see something you ain't never seen because all over the skies they're going to be black and thunder and lightning is going to take place God's big sword is going to zip through the sky he's going to condemn these bunch of Sinners that's turned us down for this 120 years you just watch and see next day instead of a black cow here come the sun coming up just like it always did he's trying the patience Noah looked out said hey there ain't no Cloud but Noah he had patience said if it didn't come today it'll be here tomorrow why cuz God said so when did he tell you that Noah 120 years ago I've come this far so I'm just waiting here he says see that see after a while what don't throw away all that you've done with a knee-jerk reaction oh I did it all and now he's disappointed me again I'm using air quotes he's disappointed me again he didn't come through again listen you spent 120 years you spent your whole life believing and you let one little thing knock you off and you wasted all of that Faith you wasted all of that patience you wasted all of that testifying you wasted all of that confession why CU you feel God let you down no no no he says Noah waited the fourth day passed no rain it's all right it's going to happen I can hear Mrs Noah come around say Dad are you sure he says don't talk like that he had patience cuz he had Faith he had virtue he had knowledge that God was right he had Temperance he didn't fly loose and say well I don't know what it's all about I lost all my popularity out there no no no people don't care for me no more I'll go out there and start all over New again no no he had patience God promised God will do it God will do it cuz God said so what a place to stand what a place to stand the door's closed you think it's done it's ready to go and then nothing happens for seven days he says now when you get that way add it but if you ain't got it that way don't try and add it it won't work it won't work on healing it won't work on nothing else see it's got to blend in with the same material it's vulcanized to for those that weren't heard vulcanization is when you take a rubber rubber and you put it on rubber but instead of just doing a cold patch or you just put some some adhesive there you put it under heat and pressure and when you apply that it melts that rubber in until it becomes one with the original and you can't separate the two he says that's right got to add to it patience with God's promise Noah believed it and he had patience with God 120 years notice how Noah had Faith to obey he had virtue to keep him going he had strength to produce the ark then he had knowledge that God was going to do something because God came down and said Now's the Time and then he had patience to wait until God's knowledge came to pass in his life but now Moses brother BR would jump over to Moses and we'll see the exact same pattern here he says Moses had patience with God yes sir he said Moses I've heard the Cry of my people I've seen their Affliction I'm coming down to deliver them and I'm going to send you down and the little contrast there between him and God and God showed him his glory he's talking about the little event there at the burning bush so Moses said here I go when he had once seen the glory of God you see he had Faith now watch the SE sequence now God started him with faith and he built him up from there why cuz without faith you'll never have patience you'll have good intentions you'll have all this motivation you'll have your Hallelujah moment but without faith you won't have enough to go all the way through to the end why because Faith's the foundation he starts them with faith and he builds them up to patience now he got down there to Egypt he come out there and said the Lord God said let my people go Pharaoh I want you to know this I've come as a representative of God you must obey me Pharaoh said obey do you know who I am I'm Pharaoh obey you as slave he said yes you'll obey me or perish you'll either do one you want to he says why he knew what he is talking about how God had proved it on the back side of the desert one-on-one he proved himself to Moses and he said Moses go out and do this in front of them and it'll take you out take this staff and take the sign in the hand and these different things and go out and I'll prove who you are and I'll prove who I am Moses had a commission and he has to go down there and he talked to God he had Faith he knew where he was he says he had a commission he was down there he says he knew what he was talking about he talked to God he had Faith he knew where he was at you want me to obey you get out of here Moses said I'll show you and Pharaoh says show me a sign he threw a stick down and it turned into a serpent why Pharaoh said that cheap magician trick come down here a minute come here you Janice and jam throw your sticks down they threw them down and they turned into a serpent he said now you cheap thing you come down here to me an Egyptian a pharaoh of Egypt Egypt you come down here with some of your cheap cheap magician tricks some of your hoaxes he said well we can do the same thing you do we we're we're looking for change in our lives we're looking for the Supernatural and we're always going to face naysayers and we're always going to face copycats and we're always going to face people that say we can produce the same thing you do and guess what in many cases they can for a while for a while I I remember and I won't mention names but just some people I know that that the husband was was struggling in his role and this isn't a Believer by the way and and they were having marital issues and what not he went to a psychologist or a psychiatrist and they got him all straightened out but didn't save his first marriage but now he's working on a second one and we'll see how that one turns out but they'll give you those results they they'll take you to to to alcoholic synonymous the they'll run you through the 10 or 12 steps or many it is and try and get you to the place where you think you're not not an alcoholic but without a new birth without a nature change you're going to keep running back and that's eventually what happens Romans 5:3 says this and not only so but we Glory we rejoice in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience it says and patience Works experience if you're patient and God ansers you'll be better able to be patient the next time God will build us up remember I was talking about the squirrels with brother brandom the first time the squirrel that he called out it came out in the right away right where he said and the second one did but the third one he had to wait and then the next day the first one took a while the second one really took a while and the third one didn't show up till the very very end and God had to challenge him on it God was building him up in that patience building him up to trust what God was doing with him to bring him to that it says now patience it it works experience it develops experience and experience develops hope cuz once God has answered you one time you'll believe the next time and you'll be able to hold hold on longer and longer and longer and that experience turns into hope which is expectation that today is the day that's what hope is and hope is if it's not today it'll be tomorrow and if it's not tomorrow it'll be the next day and the Hope keeps going because what you've got experience that God answers prayer am but we Face naysayers and it's amazing today how people think that we're crazy and they do think we're crazy but yet we look at how they've been managing the world for 6,000 years and we see the fruit of it and yet we're crazy for wanting something different it it's kind of amazing because we can literally see the result of their choices we can see the result of their religion and what does it look like death and destruction and we say we want no part of it and they say you're crazy but Moses now he's in the line of duty he's got a direct commission and yet he goes and he does exactly what God tells him to do and Janice and jamre produce the exact same signs and wonders as Moses did how disappointed could Moses have felt how betrayed could he have felt God I did something that was Supernatural and then they did the exact same thing he has a right carnally speaking to be disappointed but Moses wasn't disappointed Moses wasn't worried Moses wasn't afraid Moses just stood still that's all Moses did was he stood still why cuz he had done what God told him to do that's the only requirement that we're supposed to have is do what God tells us to do it's up to him to produce the results it's up to him to back up his word that's all Moses just had to stand there listen Ecclesiastes 78 says this it says better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof in other words you have greater proof at the end of what something was than at the beginning David versus Goliath the beginning looked like it was in Goliath's favor and yet David's the last one standing when it's all said and done why the end is the proof not the beginning and then he comes and he says and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit now being patient with God is better than being proud of what God's done you know we can get lifted up when God does something for us sometimes we can we can get caught up in gifts we can get caught up in blessings we can get caught up in provision and think it's something about us but that's not what's going to hold us because Pride elevates me patience elevates God cuz patience says this is all God's doing Pride says it was because of me so it's better to be patient in spirit than the proud in spirit so listen to this brother BR continue he says now what about Moses he didn't say Oh Mr Pharaoh I'm sorry sir I'll be your slave no sir he stood still amen stay right there God said just no doubt in his heart hold your peace and I'll show you something when you've done exactly what he said do seems like it went wrong it went wrong my kids have left my relationship's crumbling I've lost my job there ain't money in the bank seems Seems like something went wrong he says stand still and be patient Moses said you know what when I laid on that Foundation there was patience laid on there so I'll just wait and see what God will do having done all to stand stand what's he doing saying stay with the word and let God do his part your part's to do it his part's to back it up he says there are the old serpents were crawling around blowing hissing at one another and he says the first thing you know Moses serpent went gulp gulp Gulp and gulped them all down he had patience remember brother Ram says what do we have to do have patience with God what have patience to give God a chance to prove he's God and to prove that he's in the situation Amen to show that his workings different than the workings of the world so often what we want is God to match the world we want God's response to match the way the world would respond no he's God he'll do it his way amen give God a chance to to give the victory G give God the chance to show himself mightier and stronger but let him do it in his way in his time just stand still and see the salvation of God Psalm 40 says this I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and he heard My Cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit sometimes we think Faith keeps us out of pits no God leads you down the road and sometimes you're going to fall into hard times and it'll look like a pit but Faith doesn't keep us out of pits Faith gives us patience to wait on God to get us out of the pits to stick with the word and let it do its purpose amen so whether we're on a pit in a pit or on a mountain we ought to be able to have the same attitude we ought to have the same approach with God he said he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the myy clay now New Finland we got a lot of rock and not necessarily a ton of mud unless you go in the bogs but you go out in the bogs and you get into the real mud what happens is you're walking along and you'll put that foot down and it'll go down in the mud and you go to move your foot and you can't move your foot you can't get your boot out you can't get your foot out and you know what we always have to do we have to sacrifice the boot to get the foot out or else somebody has to come in and get us out you can get this is the myy clay we're talking about you're so stuck you can't get yourself out and we go into situations by ourselves what is it we're stuck and we can't get out we can't redeem ourselves we can't rescue ourselves reforming won't do it a mindset change won't do it God has to come in and he's got to get us out of our own nature he's got to get us out of our own way we need an external help here he says he took me out of the myy clay and he set my feet upon a rock and established my goings he brought them to new land right set him on a rock he says and he ha put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and trust in the Lord you stick with the word and watch God take you out that gives courage to the brother or sister that's next to you to say hey he does it God rescues God provides God heals God delivers God does all of these things cuz I seen him get you out of a place that nobody gets out of I've seen him deliver in ways that I've never seen anybody delivered I've seen them heal in ways I've never seen him heal it gives faith and it gives patience to the person next to us brother BR would talk about getting down to the wire and he's he talks about the three Hebrew children and they've had their big conversation before the king and they said we won't bow you know we believe God can do it but even if he doesn't we're not going to change that beautiful scene three teenage boys standing up to a King he says they started walking up the ramp one looked at another one and said it's all right all right they got patience he says went one step God wasn't there two steps he wasn't there three steps four steps five steps just kept on going still he wasn't there God how come you're letting me go this close to the fire I've stood for you I've stood for you I've stood for you and you're still not here walking towards the fire but as they were getting closer and closer to the fire what was happening to the guards and tormentors they were dying and as they're getting closer and closer to the fire there's nothing happening to them but all around them people are dying was the scripture say that a thousand will fall at thy right hand and 10,000 by thy side but it shall shall not come nigh unto thee sometimes he lets you get close to the edge just to prove that he's got you in the palm of his hand and I imagine I preached on this before I know maybe not here but certainly back in BC that I'm sure that something started to rise up as they're getting closer and closer to that fire and they start to see the guards dropping big Burly muscular powerful warriors hardened men versus some some tiny little skinny teenagers and the war Warriors are dropping from the Heat and the young men are walking over and it's not having an effect on them I imagine they had a bit of a Hallelujah moment honestly but even as their soldiers that were guarding them and pushing them along died they kept walking you ever notied that they kept walking with no one to push them in they kept walking because they've been told to walk and brother Ram says they stepped right off into the fiery furnace they had patience he says but he was there he was there all along he was there all along he says and see there was just enough fire hit them to burn their latches off their hands and their feet and then when they hit the bottom of the pit he was there see they had patience and in the midst of that trial they were so comfortable that they were able to walk around with the Son of God and not come out until the king told them to what were they proving he's still God he doesn't always take us out of the trial but he'll keep us safe in the trial I love when Moses said that the Red Sea said stand still and see the salvation of God and in the time of Trials we ought to have an expectation that God is moving you know the kids have been watching that that Narnia series you know and you know what they say as lands on the Move Well church we are at the end of the end God is moving he's moved in a powerful way he's sent us Malachi 4 he's proved himself by signs and wonders he's proved himself by the opening of the word we're in the time when God is moving in a way he's never moved before but yet there's trials and there's tests and it seems like things are going and they don't happen and but I'll tell you after they went through these three Hebrew children went through this experience I'll tell you they couldn't you couldn't put the fear of anything into them they've been through the fire and it didn't hurt them what are you going to what are you going to do say I'm going to kill you you tried it and all you did was killed your own people no fear in them let me tell you when God takes the fear out Satan has no hold because Satan operates under fear and when you realize that he's got you in the palm of your hand that nothing nothing can touch you unless he allows it that'll take the fear out you won't worry about your health you won't worry about your finances you won't worry about your marriage you won't worry about your kids you won't worry about your church you won't worry about your ministry you won't worry about your family you won't worry because he's got you in the palm of your hand perfect love casts out fear and on patience is on the route to perfect love you get the Holy Ghost that takes out all fear we'll see how that happens amen but it takes patience patience on top of Faith to take you to a place of perfect love where you recognize that his Banner Over Me Is Love he operates under love and that kicks out all the fear because no no matter what's happening you know it's for my good and it's going to be turned to my good remember Hebrews 10 says this cast not away therefore your confidence where's your confidence today what have you placed your confidence on where are you resting today he says don't Cast Away your confidence which had great recompense of reward great compensation in another way this kind of confidence has great pay God pays well we're all looking for good paying jobs he says God pays well for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise remember here's the trend God gives the promise you have patience you do the will you have patience and then God gives you the promise he says for yet a little while now this is God's little while this isn't our little while this is God's little while and I know sometimes God's little while is a really long time but it's yet a while there's a time declared for it it says and he shall come and he that shall come will come and he will not t now the just shall live by faith but if many any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him he says but we are not of them who draw back into predition why we left predition we left the place of the Damned we left the place of the lost we've come out of it there's nothing left for us what we're in even if it's bad is way way better than everything we've left behind there's nothing for us back there we don't draw back he says but we are of them that believe to the saving of the Soul that's the thing that matters God bless you Roy I didn't even see you come in amen it's good to see you but now he comes and he he moves on to the Pentecostal people he says now how about the Pentecostal people he's talking about the the the the day of Pentecost the you know when the the disciples and the the ones went up on the on the top of the temple he says as long as they got the commission wait until you're endued with power how long they didn't have no answer to that question how long will it be they just got the answer wait until he didn't say it was going to be 10 days he didn't say it was going to be a day an hour nothing he just said wait and they went up there and they said all right boys maybe 15 minutes from now the holy spirit's going to be on us and we're going to have our ministry 15 minutes pass nobody one day pass no 2 3 4 5 6 7 some of them might have said hey don't you think we got it already no no no no you better come on out boys the devil said you know you've already got what you want go on start your ministry they said no no no we ain't got it yet cuz he said there will come and what would take place in the last days with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest that I said see Isaiah 28:19 said this is it why we'll know when it comes and there they waited 9 days nine days I talked about it before they're nervous cuz their disciple of Jesus people are looking for him they want to put him in prison they want to persecute him 120 people in an upper room in the temple sweaty tired cramped nine days nothing happens he says and then on the 10th day we were there how often we miss the blessing because we wait a while but not all the way we go 90% And then we stop and we take a hike on that last 10% and we missed the blessing of God that we were waiting all that time for we put in so much effort and then we walk away sometimes in church we put in all this effort and there's a tremendous anointing in the building and a tremendous present and what do we do we walk out and sometimes the greatest blessing is in staying behind sometimes we put all that prayer in we put in all that time and then we make the decision on our own rather than waiting on God we put all the effort in stick with it God's moving he said now they had patience to wait now if you got that kind of patience after God gives you a promise and you see it in the Bible it's mine then wait what's he saying when you get a personal revelation that God's speaking to you hold on to it we need Revelation that our name goes in this book that when he talks about the bride of Christ that our name goes in the book when he talks about the believer it's it's our name that goes there when he talks about the Overcomer it's our name that goes in there when he talks about a Christian our name goes in there and when he does every attribute and every blessing belongs to us but we got to see that it's not just for brother Mark and sister Moren it's not for Rebecca just for Rebecca and Lydia but it's for me and it's for you and so we can read it and say it is mine it is mine we sing that song it is mine mine blessed be his name he has given peace perfect peace it this treasure is mine it's not just yours it's M I've got to see it for me not just for you I've got to have faith for myself he says then if you've got that kind of patience added to your faith and see how high you're getting now you're getting way up here now I was studying this and I just sometimes you get down into roads and you don't know why you're there and I got down this road and I just felt to bring it as it was a blessing to me as I was reading it and I felt it would be a blessing to the church tonight so just a bit of a change in Direction here we'll go to to Luke 15 this is Jesus and this is the parable of the prodal son remember and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living the son said I don't want to wait till you die I want your blessings now I want my part of what you've worked so hard for now and I want to leave it says and not many days I know this is a parable but let's pretend they're real for the for for this this little portion there one of the greatest disappointment of their lives happens when that boy tells them I want to take your money and run you ever notice how Satan Works fast they they have a bomb that gets dropped into their beautiful Christian home and fast is the way Satan works that guy just wants to get out of there it says and after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with rius living brother BR pick up the story he says now I noticed his father weary walking up and down and the next day when it came time for the boy to leave I can see him pack his little suitcase and get out there and see him go around and say so long folks and start off mother say just a moment honey before you go let's have prayer one more time kneel down on the floor I can see the old mother and dad with their arms around one another praying to God say God we've raised him and took him this far can we at least say that he says he's gone out from the way from us now wandering please father take care of him and I can hear him just Restless while they're praying they didn't want to hear them prayers of mother and dad no more he had other things on his mind he says that's the reason sometimes we're impatient we just can't wait a few minutes can't pray and can't wait for a prayer but there'll come a time friends you'll have all eternity to think about it he says pray now be ready now to meet your master consider this situation the parents are just grieving they're absolutely gutted this son maybe been showing all the signs of being a wonderful believing son and then he just comes in and says I've had enough I'm leaving I want to take whatever I can and I want to go and he splinters the family but notice a Praying family real Believers amen not again these aren't real people but in the story we we often look at the nature of the son and we see the work of God but I want you to see the nature of the parents behind this as well cuz brother takes and he flips it in a wonderful way we go back to the scriptures and it says now when he had spent all listen everyone hits the end of the road everyone hits the end of the line at some point and we can look at our children or we can look at relatives or family pick whoever it is in your life this morning and we see them and we believe they're making wrong decisions or they're living the wrong way they're walking away from what they've been raised and taught is right listen if they're God's child they're going to hit the end of the road sometime they're going to hit the end of the line and it may not be pretty but if they're a child of God they've got to hit the end of the line at some point cuz that children of of the devil they just get to keep going but children of God hit the end of the line he says but when he had spent all he he' taken every blessing every benefit every good bit that his parents had given him he says then there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and when you get in need you see a real change in people and they'll either turn to evil even more or they'll turn back remember scripture says raise up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he'll not depart from it J doesn't say in the middle he doesn't sometimes we have some departures in the middle but he'll come back around he says and he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country he gone completely out of his country he wasn't on home he wasn't in the Home Country anymore he' left his inheritance completely behind he says and and he sent him into his fields to to feed swine sent him out to feed the pigs and he says and he would have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him he's living off pig food he's living off corn husk he's fighting in the mud to survive with the pigs what a life from from a son from a wealthy family with a a good Farm a good ranch with good believing parents and he's in the mud church sometimes God's got to get us in the mud to let us realize something's not right what is it God was getting his attention brother BR he he continues this story he says one night I see a Restless Mother and Dad begin to speak about their boy hear the mother say I'm just so Restless dad I don't know what to do I just keep thinking about our boy wonder where he's at wonder if he's got something to eat I hear dad say well we've always been taught that all things work together for good to them that love God he said let's pray I can see them get down on the floor and begin to praying about that little Johnny I can hear and pray oh God take care of our boy wherever he is whatever state he's in take care of him father and send him home then brother R comes around he says where's he at he's down in the Hog Pen going to the Hog Pen hopeless situation he's lost he's he he's filthy he's worn out he's homeless he's the drgs of society he's messed up he's filthy he's dirty but that doesn't matter what matters is that a prayer of faith has been prayed and there's a patience that's holding the ones that prayed it amen we focus so much on the child but let's look at the parents behind that son it says and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bread enough and Des spare and I perish with hunger and in other words even those that serve my dad even his employees have food and I'm a son and I don't have that even servants get more than I've got he said I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him father I'm your son no no no no because when you come to yourself there's a repentance that comes with it you realize I got off track he said father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants we jump back to the story and he says the angel of God come to him and said boy wake up talked to him and said oh what about you just get back home to them' then the son says think of my father that has all the wealth that he has and all the things he's given to me and here I am laying here dying of hunger laying in a Hog Pen eating the Bible said he came to himself that's an act of God because without God we are completely hidden by this Beast nature we are completely hidden by the carnality that we have we're a slave to our baser instincts and this boy had ruined his life by his baser instincts he'd used up everything everything good we're lost and capable of rescuing ourselves from this this hopelessness that we have in this carnal body but catch this next thought no because sometime so often we put ourselves in the parents' place and oh we're the praying parents we're the the praying family members and God's going to you know but but watch the prophet of God changes because our attitude is so often one of forgetfulness of who we are even as children of God he says that's what the church needs to do today is come to the El and realize who is your father for sometimes we act as though we have no Heavenly Father for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church he's saying let's us remind ourselves who our father is even as we're looking to our prodical children even as we're looking to those that are lost in the world don't forget your father has good things for you and he'll give you the souls that are needful he says what he's given us the all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church Divine Healing salvation freedom from worry or anything it all belongs to the church Jesus died and we inherit all that God has through him we are Heirs of the Kingdom we're rich remember brother R would say the church is living under its privileges why because we forget who our father is we forget that we have a place to go we have a storehouse to draw from we have a a source of blessing that is waiting for us and all we're doing in this this time is trying to remember trying to be reminded of Who We Are by what our father God's come down and he's trying to remind us who he is and how we fit into it we don't have to eat brother saying here we don't have to eat the slop of the world we don't have to be worried when times get tough we don't have to be down when we get sick we don't have to to to get into despair when things aren't going our way why because God's waiting there with every provision remember Paul said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he didn't say we we'd always have a big house and a nice car but he says I've never seen them needing he always meets the need brother Matt would talk he's told me and I know this is is common knowledge that when he was off work for over a year he came through that year with virtually no hit financially because people were helping him and he was getting checks in the mail with nobody's name on it just people sending him money to help him and support him and and things just working out what was it God showing him I am Jehovah Gyra even in the time of trial yet meet your need brother saying wake yourself up come to yourself when you seem like it's despair is coming over you realize you've got a good good father that's got everything that we have need of amen he says and he arose and came to his father he remembered his family heritage he remembered what the family had it says and when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him there's the patient father in expectation with Faith and Hope today's the day and you know what eventually today was the day and there came the son coming back and he was ready to see him a far way off he says then I noticed down there again I can see the father get real Restless get up and pull his coat and walk out through the gate a moonlet night look down across the path wondering where is his boy he says I can hear him I can hear the son say I'll arise and go to my father now here he comes crawling it's not always an easy road back notice the son's got to return the father doesn't leave cuz the father's standing on the word the son's got to come back to the word he's got to crawl back he's coming repentant remember he's coming in humility he's not strutting up saying oh yeah I'm his son he's no no no he's coming back with the right attitude he says I'll arise and come to my father here he comes crawling and I can see Dad and mother sitting out in the room and here he comes the rising of the sun across the fields shoes off his feet clothes tattered and torn staggering home and I can hear his mother say there he comes dad and he dad say That's my boy oh even in his horrible condition beat up and bruised and hagger and and completely hungry that's still my boy and he welcomed him back into the house we look at that that son but what about the attributes of the father he's so full of faith that he's looking for that son every day and he's not just looking nearby but he's looking off in the distance and everything that breaks the Horizon there he's thinking that could be my son today he's in expectation why because the trying of your faith produces patience and patience produces an expectation of hope that it's going to happen today Amen brother Brian would turn a corner after this and he says now he says we should have patience with one another see we get so much impatient with one another we think we got to be like Moses Moses had patience he says we think we got to be like Moses Moses had patience with the people even one time when that rebellious bunch of people had such impatience they caused Moses to do something was wrong but yet when it come to a showdown God got sick of their actions and he said separate yourselves Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them and start a new and Moses threw himself in the breach and said God don't do it he says what is it patience with the people that was rebelling against him he says I wonder if we could do that he says if you don't don't come to that stature of the dwelling place of the Living God if you haven't got patience with one another I was reading in Matthew in devotions this morning where Jesus says you got to realize we're not here to judge each other this is a self-judging gospel we can discern a situation and we ought to be able to judge a situation whether it's right or wrong but don't you judge that person this is not what we do here I can dis agree with what somebody's doing without judging them I'm judging the action not the person Paul the Apostle when he was Sol and he was persecuting the church if we judged him he would have been B out but God says he's a chosen vessel he's a chosen vessel to spread the gospel and all it took was one moment in the presence of God and he turned 180 degrees and he went out and started preaching that Jesus is the Messiah Jesus is the Christ and then God took him all the way to the Gentiles we don't judge the person but we ought to have discernment for the situation by the word of God but in Matthew remember Jesus said he says why why do you look at your brother and you see the Splinter that's in his eye you see the little flaw he says and you've got a wooden beam stuck through yours why because we didn't examine ourselves in the word first before we went looking for something in our brother or sister and we get frustrated because they keep doing something over and over again not knowing that many times we're doing something just like it in a different area of our life and other people are showing us way more grace than we show for that brother or sister self-examination is where the word starts always always always but as we start to close I want to pull it down into our day because we're in this final age we're in the the final time of the working with the Gentiles we know time is wrapping up and we know a tribulation is coming and before a tribulation comes we know the Bride of Jesus Christ has taken up but it's been written about for thousands of years we've got 6,000 years and more of scripture that's been written and being written and yet it hasn't happened yet you know we've got people in this church I look at brother Gerald back there maybe 60 years of believing that Christ is going to return brother Gerald has it happened yet we're still here we're still here you know what we've seen people that believed to be healed they didn't get healed we believed that people we have people that believed that a Rapture was going to happen and they've died without ever seen it but yet so much has happened to tell us we're in Rapture season we're in Resurrection season it's not that nothing has happened we've got to see the signs of the times remember Jesus said you can look at the sky and you can tell what the weather's going to be like but you can't look at the what's happening around you and tell what's happening by the word we know what's happening by the word we've received a Malachi 4 Prophet that has told us and has placed Us in the scripture it's been going home time for a while now but it's still going home time the fact that it's been going on for a while doesn't make it any less of the time now habac would talk about this he says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables write it out he says that he may run that readeth it when you hear the word it has an effect always it has an effect he says that he may run that read it that it will cause him it'll put him into action he says for the vision is yet for an appointed time so habac write it now but it's for a future event it's a future event for a future time he says but at the end it shall speak the the vision will come to pass and it won't lie though it t wait for it he says though it waits you wait don't get impatient don't walk away he says for because it will surely come it won't T it'll T until it doesn't it'll wait until it doesn't wait it's going to happen he says behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith brother R would say this he says I believe that all these things have a time of lingering of waiting but it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right and everything is in order remember BR he he had that vision of that girl that was going to be healed and and in the vision he saw the way the room was and when he got to the house the Hat wasn't in the right place CU it was supposed to be hung up somewhere and when he got there he saw the Hat was not where it was supposed to be but seeing that vision of the event that's about to happen the Temptation is for him to go take that hat and put it it to where it was supposed to be but he says I can't do that he showed me that so that when it happened I'd know that I was in the vision and I could go pray but until the Hat was moved over there it couldn't happen and so brother Bram had to sit there and be patient until somebody without any of him him saying a single word went there and put the Hat over on the coat rack and then he could go and he could do what God told him to do he couldn't Force the situation he says many times we get impatient like a child we get great anticipation and many times we jump way ahead and that just hinders the work until the work gets caught up see we must just move reverently have a purpose in heart that God if he would desire to use us in such and such but wait till he makes the opening cuz he has to go ahead of us he says remember going David going to battle that night he was weary about the fight and he laid under those mulberry trees until he heard the Lord and the rumbling of the leaves going before him God God said David don't start the battle until you hear the rustling in the mberry trees okay when's the last time that happened has that ever happened no but God said here's the sign you can start fighting when the mberry trees start to rustle and when they did David went out and he won a great Victory but he had to wait David was the king he' been promised Victory but he had to wait for the timing of God he said then he went with courage because he knew that had gone before him he says if we'd only do that Brethren knowing the battle must come every child of God has to be tested every child of God has to be tried he says otherwise we're bastards he says knowing the battle must come but we must wait till we see the hand of God going before us to make a way we have so much truth we have so much knowledge of the word we we understand where we're at and I think sometimes the hardest thing to do is to sit back back and wait on God to make it happen we we I mean we're going to be preaching on adoption we're going to we're preaching on the manifestation of the sons of God we're talking about signs and wonders we're talking about all of these things that are happening at this end time and you think I've got to do it no you have to follow God as he does it as he leads you as he guides you in these things God's got a timing for it and that patience is the thing that holds us steady until he says go rather than we say go we want to be ready our job is to be ready his job is to tell us when to go he says many men go out impatient but listen he says believing that the time is near that's not bad he says you try to do something within yourself he says wait upon the Lord patience is virtue if you can have if you can have patience it's virtue they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength not they that try to get ahead of the Lord they that try to tell the Lord Lord I know you want me to do this and glory to God I he says don't do that he says wait upon the Lord but then you have the other side and Hebrews 10 gives us a full list of all these wonderful Heroes of The Faith from Abraham and Noah and and David and all these different ones and they believed and then the scripture says they died having not received the promise like I said we know people we look at sister Erica Parker and she dies having believed that God is her healer having believe that she's a that it's a god of the supernatural they've seen many Supernatural things in her father's own Ministry in her own church and yet God answers or really they'd say God maybe somebody would say God didn't answer God didn't heal her no God answered God said I want you with me she had lived a troubled life I guarantee you she's happier today than she was yesterday guarantee it but in our disappointment sometimes we say we see people that have believed believed and yet here they are and they're at the end of it and they still haven't received it that has nothing to do with it but we got to keep Faith through that we've got to have patience through those things but watch how the prophet takes this thought on waiting of God waiting on God and he says God's waiting too he says we find God come this far waiting for the church too he said she she'll she'll be a bride she'll be a church that's spotless without wrinkle she'll be washed in the blood of the the lamb she'll be dressed in the Garment of the word she'll be dressed in his righteousness but where is she today is she exactly the way that he said it yet no but he says God's waiting too he says and she will be there but it'll be there God's what sent forth his word and he's waiting patiently for his word to do the work God's not concerned if he's not concerned Why should we he said says don't you worry he promised it he's waited all this time for a he says we've waited all this time for a resurrection there'll be one don't worry God promised it but he's the only one can call it he says he'll call and I'll answer him said job amen if the musicians would come I want to read one scripture and one more quote as we close Psalms 47 says this I had fainted in other words I would have fainted I'd have had no virtue no strength unless I have believed so I'd have had no strength unless I had Faith to see to have the knowledge of the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living what in the here and now he says wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord last quote we can all stand together if we would he says put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing in other words let God be the one that takes the next step and then you follow then scripture says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path unless the word goes Christ is the word unless Christ goes first we're in darkness he says let him go first you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so and it's going to happen see keep him before you that's right always putting him before you remembering it was he that promised he said it wasn't me that promised it wasn't the Pastor that promised it wasn't some other minister that promised it wasn't some priest or Pope it wasn't no man of the Earth but it was God that made the promise and God is able to keep everything he promised all right he says if you got that kind of Faith to know God promised it say brother brandom I'm sick I need healing awful bad he says accept it it's a gift given to you yes sir if thou can't believe well you say I do believe let me ask you are you believing for something this evening he says then forget it that's all it's all over it's already done it's finished work we've read the back of the book we win we go through trials in life and you know sometimes we're in for the Long Haul because it took us a long ways to get into the pit and sometimes God says I'm going to let it take just as long to get you out so that you never want to go in again you take a side road you get off of the word of God you get disobedient you turn away from his will you don't do what you ought to do or you do what you ought not to do and you get off to the side and it takes you a year or two to get down there you know what sometimes God will take a year or two to get you back just so that you remember the pain and the difficulty of that decision so that next time you'll catch yourself way earlier and say I don't want to go through that again sometimes God makes us wait just because he's got to get other things in remember we talked about the big picture before and we can look through things with blinders and all we can see is is oursel but not realizing that we're part of a much greater work we're part of a much greater body and God's working in the entire situation to bring out his glory amen sometimes we need that experience of waiting for an answer to have that knowledge that God always answers always whether it takes a day whether it takes a week whether it takes a year whether it takes a decade whether it takes 25 years like it did for Abraham God always answers and he's building us up in that patience amen and then sometimes God's just getting things in position and that's it he's got a time for it like in habac there's a time for the vision to be fulfilled and all you got to do is wait for that time so that when it comes you're ready to go ready to leave ready to move ready to speak ready to act and all that patience is doing is letting you show that you're trusting God that you're trusting his leadership his provision his way of doing things and then God steps in and listen when God steps in it is almost always immediate he's been setting up for a long time God's the ultimate chess player he can set up a Move That You Don't See coming and then at the last end it's just that one move and you realize game over and what you don't realize is the game was over before it started because he knew everything was going to happen and he worked it all out and all you did was you just saw that last piece that gave you the victory but he had the victory all along he knew every move see God cheats he knows the end from the beginning God doesn't get surprised God doesn't get caught aware you know S I won't say oh he's he's sleeping Samuel had a bit of a a moment today where he was inconsolable and he was in his room and and I went in there to try and talk him down off the ledge and that wasn't working and so he he hid himself under his blanket and so what I did was I flopped flat on the ground so he couldn't see me couldn't see me and all of a sudden the crying stopped cuz he looked out to see if I was still there trying to console him and I wasn't so he's like huh and it flumed him for a bit so after about you know a minute or so Benny started to cry again but he was still under his blanket so I reached out and I tweaked his toe and then I flopped flat again you've never seen a baby stopped crying so quick he didn't know who was in the room he thought he was in a supernatural experience he had no it went dead silent it went dead silent I share this with my family after about 15 seconds cuz I didn't want him to be too freaked out I set up and I went Bo and he jumped from a seating position I was there all along and you know what he started to laugh and all of a sudden he was okay but I was there all along and he was so distraught and then something happens and he can't put it in into perspective he's like I know something touched me I know I had an experience I know I did I I I didn't imagine it but he couldn't see any evidence of anything in the room but I was there all along and then I and then when I stopped laughing I popped up and I let him know it was just me all along and I was here all along it's the way God is sometimes he just reaches in just you're like who touched me where' that come from been here all this time son been here all along daughter I know you didn't see me like those three Hebrew children no you didn't feel me no you didn't hear me but I was here all along I'm just letting you know I'm in the situation just have patience just trust me and I'll bring you through to the other side amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord grant us patience to trust you Lord let us build it on Faith Lord that takes you at your word Lord and when we come to those times of trial Lord when it seems like nothing's going our way Lord let us know that that's just something that it seems Lord but the reality is you're working on our behalf Lord you're proving us Lord that we've got the real material to build us into a Dwelling Place of God Lord that you're bringing out that nature of God that you put in Us by a seed Lord I pray you give us strength Lord I pray you help us to keep your word our your word before us Lord let you always go before us Lord not to get ahead of the plan Lord even knowing the plan Lord you took 40 years to beat it out of Moses Lord I pray that we'd lose that idea of us being able to do it ourselves Lord but if we could trust your leading Lord of your Holy Spirit Lord if we can find our place and position in the word Lord we know that patience will hold us until you move on the scene Lord I pray you give us patience not just with you but for each other Lord we're all human Lord we're all in this battle together Lord and we struggle in so many different ways but Lord I pray that we'd lift up feeble hands Lord that we'd hold each other up in prayer Lord in bonds of Love Lord that we' let nothing come between us Lord Jesus Lord that you would just be a Unity here that Satan
