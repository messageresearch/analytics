[55:09] that brought us together as brothers a
[55:12] man we thank God for the grace of God in
[55:16] our brother Michael's wife chose life a
[55:18] man and the grace of God in our lives
[55:22] the grace of God in our brother John's
[55:25] life a man it's amazing
[55:27] I've leave it His grace that proving
[55:32] that not just to us but to those in
[55:35] India grace of God to those in in Africa
[55:38] the grace of God to those around the
[55:41] world there's some thoughts so I want to
[55:43] share with you eventually on grace
[55:46] because it's certain things that have
[55:49] struck me concerning grace that I have
[55:52] seen not just in the New Testament but
[55:54] in the Old Testament concerning the
[55:56] grace of God a man so brother sister
[56:00] listen let's humble ourselves to the
[56:03] grace of God let's appreciate the grace
[56:05] of God we're here tonight because of
[56:07] grace
[56:08] we're here in fellowship with our
[56:10] brother Joshua here we're in fellowship
[56:12] with our brother Rachel and our brother
[56:15] John it's the grace of God a man were in
[56:18] fellowship again as well and we
[56:20] mentioned this with our brother Alec and
[56:23] it's the grace of God a man since
[56:26] there's been many many many years since
[56:30] I first had fellowship with him many
[56:32] many years since I last that fellowship
[56:34] with him but God brought us together
[56:36] again amen
[56:38] oh praise the name of the Lord
[56:41] see God see what God's doing he's
[56:43] bringing his bride together and his the
[56:45] caller calling of the bride through the
[56:47] ministry that he sent to
[56:49] in these last days he-man see again
[56:52] everything is according to God's plan
[56:54] and God's purpose and God's pattern as I
[56:59] mentioned I believe in the last service
[57:00] here that most do not consider the
[57:03] planned purpose and pattern that is
[57:06] revealed in the world no no they just
[57:08] think this is God's Bible and this is
[57:10] god's 'you know word and and god said
[57:12] this and god did this and so on but they
[57:14] don't recognize the plan and many don't
[57:17] recognize the pattern that god is using
[57:19] and they don't they don't realize that
[57:21] that he's got a purpose a man because
[57:25] you know for you for years maybe that i
[57:27] was raised to believe you know that god
[57:30] did this and god did that but then you
[57:32] know the devil k the devil come in and
[57:34] then trick gone well there's no tricking
[57:37] of god no indeed hey man you don't
[57:41] surprise god with anything got to
[57:43] surprise us but but we don't surprise
[57:46] him and god surprised the devil but the
[57:49] devil won't surprise god he made a God
[57:51] knew that when he created the devil he
[57:54] knew what was going to happen he knew
[57:56] what he was going to do and God God /
[57:58] it's the permissive will of God hey
[58:01] there's a perfect will and there's a
[58:03] permissive will amen
[58:05] so we want the perfect will of God and
[58:07] down through the ages god of course the
[58:09] elect of god the sons and daughters of
[58:11] god they get they get the revelation of
[58:14] the perfect will of God
[58:15] for their age amen and they walk in it a
[58:19] man they hung with themselves to it as
[58:21] we since you don't just come into the
[58:24] light you walk in the light you don't
[58:26] just get into the spirit you walk in the
[58:28] spirit
[58:28] he made by the grace of God so we thank
[58:31] God for he made the revelation of his
[58:34] plan we thank God for bringing and
[58:37] bringing into the the purpose to our
[58:39] attention amen and then the way that God
[58:42] is doing it a man the pattern brother
[58:45] sister that's why we recognize God in
[58:48] that age got in God in this age and what
[58:51] God's going to do tomorrow
[58:52] amen because we recognize the planned
[58:55] purpose and pattern
[58:57] so thank God somewhere in the pattern of
[59:00] God some when the plan of God was this
[59:04] his will for our brother Alec to be here
[59:07] tonight with his will for her brother
[59:09] Joshua to be here and his will for
[59:12] brother Faisal to be here and our
[59:15] brother John a man we would never dream
[59:18] of this may be fifty years ago we would
[59:21] think maybe that before all of this
[59:23] could happen that the bride be gone in
[59:26] the rapture but God is God is bringing
[59:28] the bride e to the progression of the
[59:31] rapture amen until it reaches the climax
[59:34] just think he man and God is bringing
[59:37] assaulted with his red yellow black her
[59:40] white makes no difference in the in
[59:43] God's eyes it's his CSEC it's his sons
[59:47] and daughters and he see all just
[59:49] approved the body of Christ to prove it
[59:53] he's bringing us all together he's
[59:55] sending some over there but he's
[59:57] bringing says though some in Africa
[59:59] India China and and different parts of
[1:00:03] the world bringing them here they made a
[1:00:05] million that's God why because the bride
[1:00:08] is going to be made up of all all of
[1:00:11] these different creations of God so we
[1:00:15] thank God for our brothers and sisters
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:19] it's been our it's been a man it's been
[1:00:21] the grace of God amen so we pray the
[1:00:24] grace of God to our brother John as he
[1:00:26] comes to give his testimony tonight hey

[1:00:32] has given him when it comes to playing
[1:00:34] the guitar or the piano and singing and
[1:00:39] writing hymns a man god bless him say
[1:00:44] it's been a blessing to us God reveal
[1:00:46] himself in this way a man through our
[1:00:50] brother John

[1:07:55] may Allah bless you are we hoping our
[1:07:59] Bible we can read just one of us they
[1:08:03] take revelation 12 verse 11 and they
[1:08:16] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:08:19] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:08:23] they loved not their life
[1:08:26] untii unto death may God had some
[1:08:31] blessings on his words we can have our
[1:08:34] city thank you so much pastor for giving
[1:08:41] me this privilege to stand here again
[1:08:44] and God bless you was the pure great man
[1:08:49] I know I am saying that because the zone
[1:08:54] as I wrote last time was based on his
[1:08:57] preachings was based on how he was
[1:09:02] showing us the grace of the Lord from
[1:09:05] time to eternity he brought us back
[1:09:08] it was built in Korea so first you are
[1:09:11] very source of inspiration for me and
[1:09:14] God also bless you for for everything
[1:09:17] that you have done for me going just to
[1:09:23] have some something here about my
[1:09:25] testimony and about surprise last last
[1:09:29] Wednesday when the person told me about
[1:09:33] giving a testimony whose wow this was
[1:09:37] strange to me but before that something
[1:09:44] came up
[1:09:45] two weeks ago I dream about myself
[1:09:49] standing on a certain place like this
[1:09:52] and I do you know like what was that
[1:09:56] exactly
[1:09:57] and last time when you first told me
[1:09:59] about giving our testimonials
[1:10:02] Wow this is surprise for me but God
[1:10:05] showed me standing in front of a church
[1:10:08] for the first time
[1:10:11] okay I'm just going to to have some
[1:10:15] something throughout my life and and we
[1:10:19] may sage how I believe that bowing in a
[1:10:23] message family and how we used to see
[1:10:27] things as a kid first thing I would like
[1:10:31] to talk about just the testimony how
[1:10:34] powerful is a testimony because in the
[1:10:38] revelation the Bible say they hope I
[1:10:40] came him by the blood of the Lamb and
[1:10:43] every reward of their testimony so I was
[1:10:48] just reading about okay a testimony how
[1:10:51] powerful it is how can I test money or
[1:10:55] fight a devil because the Bible say they
[1:10:58] overcame him so I was reading too much
[1:11:02] about that last week and just to find
[1:11:05] out why testimony is powerful also I
[1:11:11] found out in the Psalms of David sums
[1:11:16] 11 9 that he was saying that I will also
[1:11:22] speak of your testimony before kings and
[1:11:26] I will not be ashamed I was well now we
[1:11:30] are testimony and be ashamed so why that
[1:11:34] and I was reading a Bible if I found out
[1:11:37] where Paul say don't be ashamed of the
[1:11:41] testimony of our Lord so I was nothing
[1:11:44] okay a testimony and be a shame why
[1:11:46] people should be ashamed of the
[1:11:48] testimony
[1:11:49] whatever must walk in a certain way you
[1:11:52] have to be a shame of giving out why God
[1:11:55] has done for you because he knew a
[1:11:58] testimony is a part of to overcome him
[1:12:03] that it's written in our Bible here in
[1:12:07] Revelation 12 they who became him by the
[1:12:10] blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[1:12:12] their testimony
[1:12:13] so from dinner
[1:12:15] for here as for the first time that
[1:12:17] testimony is powerful for a Christian
[1:12:20] even if it it it's some changes too
[1:12:24] small but is a testimony like Devi
[1:12:28] before he goes out and fight eight giant
[1:12:32] you had so many testimony in your
[1:12:35] brochure God had me in fighting I don't
[1:12:38] know a lie on or something like that
[1:12:40] it was having that with him he was like
[1:12:44] a train having away God's our testimony
[1:12:48] is like having wagons you have a train
[1:12:51] and you have so many testimony is like
[1:12:53] wagons once you first the devil you
[1:12:57] fight now you say no when I will seek
[1:13:01] God hit me when I was hungry he gave me
[1:13:04] food when I was doing this God did
[1:13:06] something for me those are like our our
[1:13:10] our welcomes that we have now is a
[1:13:12] become part of our faith now firmly we
[1:13:16] can fight it therefore I mean so I was
[1:13:19] just reading about that and why the
[1:13:22] devil doesn't like the tune of guy give
[1:13:27] the testimony because he know the world
[1:13:31] what testimony is to overcome him when
[1:13:36] you are testifying about God the devil
[1:13:39] don't like that you know because he knew
[1:13:44] something will happen by testifying what
[1:13:48] God has done for you in your life is
[1:13:51] like display how the devil was attacking
[1:13:54] you this big hall hall is tastic you
[1:13:58] know Hollis his movement strategy you
[1:14:01] are displaying that to her people
[1:14:02] and they therefore don't like that and
[1:14:06] Jesus also say something
[1:14:08] before I start my testimony say whoever
[1:14:14] therefore shall confess me before men we
[1:14:18] confess him before my father in heaven
[1:14:20] so I was okay now for God to confess
[1:14:24] hearts before for Jesus to confess her
[1:14:28] before
[1:14:29] God we must confess him before men and
[1:14:32] kings
[1:14:33] we must this Phi who his dance firmly no
[1:14:37] God will dispose of us he will convince
[1:14:40] us that this to turn stood up for me he
[1:14:44] he kept us standing for me where he was
[1:14:47] on the world when he was at charge or
[1:14:49] somewhere else that's why I came also to
[1:14:51] confess him before my lord
[1:14:54] hello I like that so that's why from
[1:14:58] dieting like artists when it's so
[1:15:00] powerful for a Christian and every of
[1:15:03] style that we are facing become our
[1:15:06] testimony we cannot be sick in God he
[1:15:10] has is a great testimony you had cancer
[1:15:14] and God here is a testimony you're
[1:15:17] having this strawberry God gave you
[1:15:19] science and and gave you solution is a
[1:15:21] testimony here we all stuck that we face
[1:15:24] today we become a testimony we need to
[1:15:27] put that in our wagons and next time
[1:15:29] when we will face the devil will not be
[1:15:32] afraid anymore because we knew God did
[1:15:35] something for us in the past
[1:15:36] it has become part of our experience I
[1:15:40] mean so my testimony I was thinking what
[1:15:45] am I going to start what am I going to
[1:15:47] start I was born you know in a message
[1:15:51] you know I don't know exactly but I
[1:15:56] found out something I will just say that
[1:16:02] in three options there is a world
[1:16:05] computation I had a world computation
[1:16:08] also a doctrine of computation and God's
[1:16:12] experience those I don't know if I can
[1:16:16] say that my this money but those are
[1:16:18] where God brought like God lead me to
[1:16:23] out from the world computation I was
[1:16:26] born a message you know family men said
[1:16:29] we have random Jesus Christ yeah you
[1:16:31] know we were born a message you know
[1:16:34] that was something good but in a house
[1:16:38] what was auras first yeah if you
[1:16:43] Oh God in my heart was there but the
[1:16:47] thing that was coming first was the fear
[1:16:49] of the parents now yeah that was the
[1:16:53] fasting the first thing you are fearing
[1:16:57] if gods that see who's doing this or if
[1:17:02] that seems you like doing such things he
[1:17:06] will be mad at you
[1:17:07] those are the things that we grab that
[1:17:11] you know in a house of the message the
[1:17:13] finger was there but was not first in my
[1:17:18] life
[1:17:18] what was coming first was my parents you
[1:17:22] know they are serving God a my father is
[1:17:25] a pastor so I don't have to do this I
[1:17:27] drafted yeah and God also was there but
[1:17:30] it was not when I I went out of my
[1:17:34] parents house now the view of God came
[1:17:37] first and if you of my apartment was was
[1:17:41] not anymore there he was out there my
[1:17:44] father was not there my opponent were
[1:17:47] there I was alone now I was studying
[1:17:51] having a leadership now and if you of
[1:17:56] God came fast anyhow I remember growing
[1:18:02] up and my dad was 10 years you know as
[1:18:06] we don't watch TV you know so yeah we
[1:18:08] don't wish to be a new professor we
[1:18:10] don't watch TV yeah but now when you're
[1:18:13] outside your parents on order now you
[1:18:17] must defend while your parent was
[1:18:19] telling you why we don't watch TV that
[1:18:24] was the world computation I had so many
[1:18:29] things why you guys don't drink you know
[1:18:31] us you know we know we don't drink
[1:18:33] because he's icy now someone will come
[1:18:35] and say okay he's had seen how you call
[1:18:38] Jesus turn our water to wine so you and
[1:18:41] you are telling me he's a sin so tell me
[1:18:43] how do the reward computation out of my
[1:18:47] parents house that was something that I
[1:18:52] was now facing it like every day
[1:18:56] with friends why doing this is bad why
[1:18:59] doing this is bad why doing this is bad
[1:19:02] god is love so why you can't go out and
[1:19:05] take a girlfriend you know god is love
[1:19:08] you know those are the things now you
[1:19:14] have to face against the world I had so
[1:19:19] many things and now I was a porno I was
[1:19:21] defending myself but I was no daddy
[1:19:23] enough strong to defend myself
[1:19:25] I was support to go back in reading the
[1:19:29] Bible to build up a faith where I was
[1:19:33] still alone to create a few of God in my
[1:19:38] heart not a few of parents or a few of
[1:19:42] brothers or sisters as a sort of a
[1:19:44] person or to create a fear of God now I
[1:19:47] cannot do this because I'm fearing God
[1:19:50] and you've ever say who's fearing God we
[1:19:53] have wisdom
[1:19:54] those are the things I was facing and
[1:19:59] they were a lot also they are they are
[1:20:04] things here I wrote down just I can
[1:20:08] remember and living amongst sinners and
[1:20:17] you know sometimes you are doing you are
[1:20:20] discussing about the Bible and they they
[1:20:24] don't want to believe the Bible but they
[1:20:28] just want to believe you I was like why
[1:20:31] you you just want to believe me but not
[1:20:33] not a but not you know the Bible has so
[1:20:36] many thoughts inside you know so many
[1:20:39] mistakes I say okay if it's a like so
[1:20:42] many mystic but it's God's Word and
[1:20:45] except the Bible I cannot be like I not
[1:20:50] a book in my life it's a no no no Joel
[1:20:53] but we believe you because your way of
[1:20:55] living is a it's just quite strange you
[1:20:58] know you don't drink you don't do that
[1:21:01] but yeah it's also good you know to not
[1:21:04] drink you know just taking water
[1:21:08] so I was having those kind of frame
[1:21:10] because I'm not stay away from them you
[1:21:13] know we used to go in same school and
[1:21:14] living outs so there were just my
[1:21:18] neighbors all the time and I was now
[1:21:20] studying defending the Word of God
[1:21:25] without my parent beside me without my
[1:21:29] brother and my sisters I was starting
[1:21:31] defend God's Word I were not supposed to
[1:21:34] get something by a boy and surely but in
[1:21:38] the beginning it was not like that I was
[1:21:41] trying to defend myself and I rest the
[1:21:46] case no okay tell us why God turn hi
[1:21:50] Warren
[1:21:51] to uh to a wine you see you're just
[1:21:55] listen yes II know you know it's a sin
[1:21:57] okay okay is that situations why why
[1:22:01] stop doing this is a sin well stop doing
[1:22:04] that is a sin so now after going through
[1:22:07] the Word of God I was having a way of
[1:22:11] defending his world
[1:22:12] I was now standing on the Word of God
[1:22:15] like Peter say like we don't have to be
[1:22:21] afraid of of confessing our faith we
[1:22:26] don't have to be afraid of that
[1:22:28] yeah we don't have to be afraid of that
[1:22:31] whatever the case we need to confess our
[1:22:33] faith by confessing our face because the
[1:22:37] devil knows by confessing you are
[1:22:41] creating in Sutton's people's mind when
[1:22:45] it arrived like in a time where they are
[1:22:48] drinking your so thing cannot also drink
[1:22:52] but now they are telling you John is a
[1:22:54] Christian menorah
[1:22:55] you know John cannot drink and it's a
[1:22:58] mizuhara no I can also drink you know
[1:23:00] those are the kind of thing that was
[1:23:02] happy you know we like you creatine in
[1:23:05] people's mind that you are a man of God
[1:23:09] without
[1:23:10] hypocracy you create that it's going to
[1:23:14] help you I because in doing sometimes
[1:23:17] things that they want to do and you want
[1:23:21] to pass fit
[1:23:22] they're gonna tell you that hey John but
[1:23:24] you you don't drink you know you know
[1:23:27] you know you don't do this oh yeah yeah
[1:23:30] I don't do this yeah you know it's good
[1:23:33] by confessing our faith and that was the
[1:23:38] world competition it was something out
[1:23:41] of my parent home I was supposed to face
[1:23:45] that I was supposed to to be a faith I
[1:23:49] was supposed to go to the readings
[1:23:52] I was supposed to defame the message I
[1:23:56] was supposed to defend Vera Branagh and
[1:24:00] and Terry
[1:24:01] damn that we have a prophet now in every
[1:24:06] day it was not that easy but after you
[1:24:09] you build that that that faith if you
[1:24:13] are if you are standing upon that state
[1:24:17] you will not be shaking anymore you can
[1:24:21] start defending are the Word of God show
[1:24:23] you them this show them that I remember
[1:24:26] in high school I remember ah no that was
[1:24:29] a in secretary school yet someone was
[1:24:33] asking okay so you are saying that God
[1:24:39] seen as a prophet but we know you know
[1:24:41] the time of the prophets in the Bible as
[1:24:44] person oh no even Paul was a prophet you
[1:24:49] know that no you said no Sunni day
[1:24:54] Malachi for show need a look 17:30 show
[1:25:00] you them how God still doing things as
[1:25:03] his promise because God say hey God can
[1:25:07] never do anything without sending a
[1:25:11] prophet God can ever do that God without
[1:25:15] a man he cannot do anything
[1:25:17] he need a man for him to walk through it
[1:25:20] as jesus for him to work through does
[1:25:23] were a Clara body to walk through the
[1:25:26] body and at this time now we must have a
[1:25:30] prophet before message from God I would
[1:25:33] all starting explain it to them
[1:25:35] like step by step by step step by step
[1:25:39] some was sustained okay now we have many
[1:25:42] profit John you know that as yeah and
[1:25:45] you've ever said so that Ravi in a
[1:25:48] certain time we we have so many fast
[1:25:50] profit as we have a fast
[1:25:53] ten dollars we also have original ten
[1:25:56] dollars so it doesn't mean that God
[1:25:59] doesn't have his profit among the first
[1:26:01] profits I was all starting showing them
[1:26:05] because the way the world see
[1:26:08] Christianity is now something funny
[1:26:12] something funny oh we have so many false
[1:26:15] prophets false preachers just running
[1:26:19] after money and you also a Christian now
[1:26:23] you must tell them that yeah we know
[1:26:26] that but in those kind of stuff God has
[1:26:29] Alec are chosen people inside so I was
[1:26:35] trying to explain to them over and over
[1:26:39] and over and I I praise God because God
[1:26:43] helped me out to convert eight the world
[1:26:48] out of my parents house and it was not
[1:26:52] that easy things
[1:26:53] it was hard up and down waiter but still
[1:26:57] standing on the Word of God and God will
[1:27:00] never never let you down God will never
[1:27:04] never let you down
[1:27:08] also there is something I doubt you know
[1:27:12] computation now now when you are in a
[1:27:15] message the devil so is there any
[1:27:18] message coming out fast doctrines now
[1:27:23] that was hard very hard because they are
[1:27:27] telling you go back and read that in a
[1:27:29] certain message you will see that go
[1:27:31] back and read this you see this
[1:27:33] now what was happening was you must know
[1:27:39] face first doctrine out of your parents
[1:27:43] house away from your your childhood
[1:27:47] charge
[1:27:49] away now you must face them you must
[1:27:54] face how to defend know how to to to
[1:27:59] create a standing against polygamy
[1:28:02] you must not create that you must define
[1:28:07] that saying that is not in God's Word
[1:28:10] that was not something easy in the
[1:28:14] message no no you know the Bible say
[1:28:17] like you know
[1:28:19] Davy if he was having so many wife you
[1:28:21] know now you have to create a standing
[1:28:25] in a tall tree now that was not
[1:28:29] something easy also facing a lot of dead
[1:28:31] tree in with our brothers discussing
[1:28:35] reading the Bible searching in some tree
[1:28:38] that was the time where I I knew now my
[1:28:43] standing on this message now I knew that
[1:28:46] even in this message we have swear
[1:28:50] people who are caught out there are so
[1:28:52] many even in this message but only few
[1:28:54] that are chosen to hit in a broad age
[1:28:57] some there may be in a loud addition age
[1:29:01] carry the Bible Petrey day goes by that
[1:29:04] we are preaching but only chosen go we
[1:29:08] go in a bread age I was now starting
[1:29:12] first in it we see that carry them know
[1:29:17] in the beginning it was not like that in
[1:29:22] a beginning it was not like that those
[1:29:24] three came out after the fall of RA and
[1:29:30] Eve but in the beginning it's not like
[1:29:33] that and you ever say even the professor
[1:29:35] that we are going back as it was in the
[1:29:38] beginning so why you want to create a
[1:29:41] stand after the beginning you create a
[1:29:44] doctrine where you just want to stay
[1:29:47] there I said no the Bible say like what
[1:29:53] was written a man who's supposed to get
[1:29:55] marry for one wife Kosmos why do you
[1:29:58] ever say that was the only murder that
[1:30:01] God
[1:30:02] or Nurik yeah cut only only that Mirage
[1:30:07] where Adam and Eve so that was in the
[1:30:12] beginning no sin were there now you are
[1:30:16] telling me that now is not a see is part
[1:30:21] of the world I was not trying to face to
[1:30:23] defend the Word of God not by myself but
[1:30:27] by God's grace by God's grace my parents
[1:30:31] are waiting for me
[1:30:32] you know just away you just alone if you
[1:30:36] by body message you have to define it
[1:30:40] also there are some people who who say
[1:30:46] that we are already in a million you
[1:30:47] like we already in a million you we are
[1:30:52] already like in heaven I was like people
[1:30:57] say we already like in heaven so many
[1:31:01] things even those who used to say what a
[1:31:04] phenom is God now those that you want
[1:31:09] you should get get away from them why
[1:31:14] because they have a seat a serpent seed
[1:31:18] inside them after like having a
[1:31:22] conversation okay I remember I had a
[1:31:25] friend a friend of mine she was in a in
[1:31:28] Paris you know she was also born message
[1:31:31] she read in Paris operate in Como change
[1:31:37] religion they started out believing in
[1:31:40] the Prophet being their God so now they
[1:31:44] were sending the quotation to their
[1:31:47] daughter you know in France no take this
[1:31:49] read and understand take this video and
[1:31:51] this so now that's kind of manuals have
[1:31:55] you know travel you would know my
[1:31:59] parents they are just sending me things
[1:32:01] here you know some quotations you know
[1:32:05] and telling me that something strange
[1:32:08] you know and I if you remember one
[1:32:12] question also
[1:32:14] she gave me that where it's rotating
[1:32:18] that as God has changed his name to the
[1:32:21] ages it was a question that was asked to
[1:32:25] do the perfect I remember like don't
[1:32:28] need a disposition as God as change his
[1:32:31] name and the professor yeah God has
[1:32:34] changed his name but all those name was
[1:32:37] referred to one single name the Lord
[1:32:40] Jesus Christ so now that part was not
[1:32:44] sent to their daughter just a question
[1:32:46] does God as change his name do need a
[1:32:51] disposition and the answer was yes God
[1:32:53] has chain name and that spot was
[1:32:55] referred to them no now God is happy and
[1:32:58] a name calling the Prophet but down
[1:33:02] which don't wear the professor all those
[1:33:05] name which of a jury and with your
[1:33:08] father vanished he was referred to one
[1:33:11] person the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:14] now you have to bring that out explain
[1:33:17] to someone but very slowly because that
[1:33:21] plane also fell in that's Daughtry why
[1:33:26] because it was something from the parrot
[1:33:28] and I don't know if she could be that
[1:33:32] strong to to stand against something
[1:33:35] that came out in your house that was
[1:33:38] something hard but if you have a stand
[1:33:41] on God if you have your faith on the
[1:33:44] Word of God wherever where any daughter
[1:33:47] he comes out you must check that with
[1:33:49] the world with the Bible so those are
[1:33:54] like the Daughtry in competition I faced
[1:33:58] and I read a lot a lot that period end
[1:34:00] is knowing that period I wrote I read a
[1:34:05] lot of the messages and
[1:34:07] I found out know God is working to the
[1:34:11] Prophet with our honor also know their
[1:34:15] part for the experience now those know
[1:34:20] was a time I guess that was 2000 16 or
[1:34:24] 15 I guess that was 16
[1:34:27] I was praying too much not too much just
[1:34:32] praying a lot I was praying a lot in a
[1:34:35] certain way that I was so consecrate to
[1:34:39] God
[1:34:39] very very consecrated to God and I was
[1:34:44] like having so many dreams happening
[1:34:48] like every day
[1:34:50] he's were like something you know
[1:34:51] strange and it's a mechanic's normal for
[1:34:54] me so that was just God like he wanted
[1:35:00] to relive to reveal himself to me and I
[1:35:05] went out read about how the Prophet was
[1:35:08] doing about the vision on it and I found
[1:35:11] out God can show a dream first of all -
[1:35:16] oh no secondly to show his is mighty you
[1:35:22] know his greatness to you and totally
[1:35:25] just to show you maybe someone else just
[1:35:28] to warm someone else so those are the
[1:35:30] type of of dreams that I had during that
[1:35:35] time and it was something like strange
[1:35:37] for me and like the Prophet was saying
[1:35:40] that a dream from God was not surprised
[1:35:44] like to be ten minutes something like
[1:35:47] one second or two second but you you you
[1:35:50] get the full meaning that was a few
[1:35:53] strange after read from the Prophet in I
[1:35:56] had a dream just for two second and I
[1:36:01] remember every single step in that dream
[1:36:03] so those are the things that's happened
[1:36:06] to me I can call as God experienced the
[1:36:10] first dream I dream I dream first of all
[1:36:15] in my dream that was I don't know June
[1:36:19] 2016 and I was in a class if our friends
[1:36:24] and our lecturer who was supposed to who
[1:36:28] passed two by two so it got me in a
[1:36:33] dream I was me with a late no John you
[1:36:36] still referred a lady you to to to to to
[1:36:39] that's what just a dreaming
[1:36:41] and also a place where we used to go and
[1:36:44] do our laboratory staff of you know
[1:36:47] coding it and stuff like that then after
[1:36:52] 2 or 3 days in that class with the same
[1:36:55] lecture it was now something I have to
[1:37:00] wait now to to be like he will know to
[1:37:03] me and after just after the lesson yes
[1:37:10] or no I'm going to group you to to to I
[1:37:13] was ok here we are
[1:37:15] so let me wait and see if my dream come
[1:37:18] true and then he got me with a man I was
[1:37:23] that dream was just like that - Dennis -
[1:37:26] no no no no no John go with that lady I
[1:37:29] will be I was like wow wow this is a
[1:37:34] major me that's again and it was
[1:37:36] something happening in reality now just
[1:37:40] showing you just got water to show you
[1:37:43] how great he hates how great he can do
[1:37:46] things to you and it's also one dream
[1:37:49] that that gum was warning me about
[1:37:52] something about something you know in a
[1:37:56] school we used to send up our computer
[1:37:58] before you go in and out so it was
[1:38:03] something like you know so lazy to
[1:38:05] grandson I carry your computer it's
[1:38:07] yours and I was not signing something I
[1:38:10] was just I go back I was just coming out
[1:38:13] going and I hope God was seeing me and
[1:38:17] God didn't like that I had a dream now
[1:38:22] where someone from the security guard
[1:38:25] catching hey John did you sign your
[1:38:29] computer you know in that dream I felt
[1:38:31] affairs so horrible afraid so a shame of
[1:38:35] me my gosh I should have signed my
[1:38:38] computer but I didn't so you would know
[1:38:40] what challenge
[1:38:40] then one day also I will just do the
[1:38:44] same thing the next day same thing and
[1:38:46] one day the same guy from the security
[1:38:50] guard got me John
[1:38:53] see your signature here did you say your
[1:38:55] computer I feel so bad
[1:38:58] God warned me but I didn't want to
[1:39:01] listen and I was cautious no you shall
[1:39:04] son you computer here is no as I was in
[1:39:07] my first by the same way I fell
[1:39:10] imagine so that was paying me up like
[1:39:13] God can sure things just to warn you
[1:39:16] just to warn you to know doing that oh
[1:39:19] oh this will happen and I didn't like
[1:39:25] her for that way of my dream so from
[1:39:28] there I was now standing careful of what
[1:39:31] I was dreaming now
[1:39:33] I was now taking care of every single
[1:39:36] thing because like in a Bible say in
[1:39:40] Joette 228 no God will pour out his
[1:39:44] Spirit upon the young man upon the hard
[1:39:48] path on the we have vision they were
[1:39:51] Satan dreams and and those things those
[1:39:54] thing must come out like they must
[1:39:57] happening like now why because we need
[1:40:00] to go in a certain age in a bread age
[1:40:04] where we need to habitat pool and what
[1:40:07] is the third pole now is having our
[1:40:09] testimony happening living a testimony
[1:40:11] now I remember is a brother from France
[1:40:14] a friend of mine saw he was having some
[1:40:18] some bad situation he didn't have cash
[1:40:21] to to pay his rent and stuff and after
[1:40:26] church he went up to his past I guess
[1:40:30] not to just to pray for him okay if I
[1:40:34] just pray for him that were went home
[1:40:37] and it was pretty pretty pretty good I
[1:40:41] just need to get out of this situation I
[1:40:44] just want to get out of this situation
[1:40:45] and if you like some other store you not
[1:40:50] to get a half log and write the rates
[1:40:53] and put on his table
[1:40:55] they were just did a trench in an empty
[1:40:59] envelope and put out on his table he
[1:41:02] were about to sleep in the morning he
[1:41:05] will cut in front gosh
[1:41:07] some cash in that envelope can you
[1:41:10] imagine it's something that was like
[1:41:15] it's it has happened I was not seen oh
[1:41:19] god it's working now the third pole is
[1:41:23] starting working instead of us it just
[1:41:25] want us to get ready now to do something
[1:41:28] to say something I was wow wow really
[1:41:34] yeah he took some cash in that empty
[1:41:38] envelope he just wrote a range and you
[1:41:40] saw 900 euros something like that I was
[1:41:45] WOW God is working now we are close to
[1:41:49] to do something we are close to the
[1:41:52] rapture no they are certainty does must
[1:41:54] happen we must now get ready to to have
[1:41:59] that faith that we will bring us to do
[1:42:02] the the miracles the third port we have
[1:42:08] to do this before the rapture and the
[1:42:12] only time we can do it see when we are
[1:42:14] life now that's the only time it can do
[1:42:17] this
[1:42:18] does the only term that God can help us
[1:42:21] to to like to have something that we
[1:42:25] will share with brothers who went before
[1:42:27] us we cannot just go in heaven and
[1:42:30] having a fee to share no we need to
[1:42:34] share something with the angel telling
[1:42:37] them how God was working with you
[1:42:39] I remember her knock will have a great
[1:42:42] testimony say how he was working with
[1:42:45] God and God took him in heaven he we
[1:42:48] testified we also need to test fighter
[1:42:52] what God is doing in our life every day
[1:42:56] is a testimony for a Christian if you
[1:42:59] have never even have a book of writing
[1:43:01] at this minute buy a book right so you
[1:43:04] can remember and and see how blessed
[1:43:07] singer is how great God is
[1:43:10] we must have something to testify in
[1:43:13] heaven
[1:43:14] testify here before men not just in
[1:43:18] church even at work in school
[1:43:20] we must destroy that this ferret and
[1:43:25] that's the only way we can overcome the
[1:43:28] devil he doesn't like you this funny
[1:43:31] goes word because he knew he will be
[1:43:34] defeated by that word Amen that's why he
[1:43:40] creates something in our schooling being
[1:43:44] a shame of this fine because he knew
[1:43:46] that that's what Paul says something I
[1:43:49] will not be ashamed even they will say I
[1:43:51] will not be ashamed this is not by
[1:43:55] mistake they say that because there is
[1:43:57] something close to a testimony called
[1:44:00] being ashamed like you must be shy to
[1:44:02] not say what God did to you now the
[1:44:05] devil will be happy okay he cannot say
[1:44:07] that is you know he is a shame you know
[1:44:10] it no you can't say that that's the
[1:44:13] devil but once you open all your mouth
[1:44:15] and you say something God's Word through
[1:44:18] your testimony the devil is defeated
[1:44:21] he's defeated also there is a dream I
[1:44:27] dreamed that was just in school I
[1:44:32] remember I was supposed to see someone
[1:44:35] and he might dream that person was
[1:44:39] wearing a white shirt and I was supposed
[1:44:45] to go to talk to him about something and
[1:44:47] he also suffered supposed to reply to me
[1:44:50] something
[1:44:52] that was where I dreams actually now I
[1:44:55] was waiting for that day to go ahead and
[1:44:57] see that person I was waiting the day I

[1:46:03] for solo then I saw him I approached him
[1:46:07] he told me the exact thing he's saying
[1:46:10] in my dream so that was the things that
[1:46:14] God will show you me in the past God was
[1:46:20] showing me this thing it was rough
[1:46:23] dreams happening it was something
[1:46:25] strange to me I was supposed like like

[1:46:43] guy came and asked for his computer
[1:46:45] I was just the quiet you know it was
[1:46:50] something beautiful and strange if you
[1:46:53] are experiencing something we've got God
[1:46:56] will reveal himself to you why God was
[1:46:59] he really accept me because I was so
[1:47:01] consecrated to him I was even going like
[1:47:04] on a brush with my guitar just singing a
[1:47:07] praying
[1:47:07] go away from my place singing a praying
[1:47:10] in a broach singing a brain I went home
[1:47:14] just another atmosphere God atmosphere
[1:47:18] tapes playing everything was just good
[1:47:22] that time and it was something that I
[1:47:26] will never never forget and I remember
[1:47:29] this song that I was singing every day
[1:47:33] with those away it's upon the Lord shall
[1:47:35] renew their strength the ceremony we
[1:47:38] like a hero I was think that every day
[1:47:41] because I want a god to relieve like to
[1:47:45] reveal himself to me
[1:47:47] I was ready to have a personal
[1:47:49] experience we've got not something for
[1:47:53] my parents not something from outside
[1:47:55] but something personal something partial
[1:47:59] where you can stand
[1:48:00] no one will shake you that yeah no one
[1:48:04] will show you that something can happen
[1:48:06] here I don't know I keep taking just
[1:48:10] play if one we see but for you is a
[1:48:14] personal testimony right but all of us
[1:48:18] we saw the guitar playing itself but to
[1:48:20] you it's something personal you can
[1:48:23] stand if any what you saw what you
[1:48:26] believe
[1:48:27] not know you know is that this me well
[1:48:29] all of us we saw that note to you is
[1:48:32] passion
[1:48:33] God what do you special it's not
[1:48:36] something you know all of us wish to
[1:48:39] believe this you know no to you is
[1:48:41] something direct it's personal to you
[1:48:44] that's how God's Word it just it has to
[1:48:49] become such a personal to in a certain
[1:48:51] way even if the devil come you must say
[1:48:55] it because you believe God did something
[1:48:58] to you not thinking but you knew that
[1:49:02] God we also defend the next obstacle in
[1:49:05] your life and it has to become another
[1:49:08] testimony you put out in your train like
[1:49:11] I've said before it is like a wagon you
[1:49:15] are driving with now if you can't stop
[1:49:18] you know because your word of your
[1:49:21] testimony is so powerful also there is
[1:49:24] something here
[1:49:26] just some going close they also
[1:49:32] something here
[1:49:34] we had a fellowship when I was in school
[1:49:39] in a university with our brothers from
[1:49:43] you know Jessie in a message we need to
[1:49:45] like we used to listen to the Prophet
[1:49:48] it's Friday it's Friday we must have a
[1:49:53] place I don't know someone's house we
[1:49:55] play the Prophet this you know we sang

[1:50:11] world like on Friday weekend they must
[1:50:15] go out having parties I was on Friday
[1:50:18] was a blessing day where we can play
[1:50:21] music sing listen to the Prophet having
[1:50:26] great time it's also the only way to to
[1:50:29] to fight the devil when you are so near
[1:50:32] by good people who can lead you also
[1:50:35] true God
[1:50:35] that's where now I started like a
[1:50:39] writing songs singing praying going up

[1:50:58] even only twice one was 10 here and when
[1:51:02] I was playing if you're dancing only
[1:51:04] twice but now when my father I dunno you
[1:51:07] are seeing how you can repeat ah how you
[1:51:11] know they never knew me in that way
[1:51:15] God Himself to me in a strange way
[1:51:19] now when they heard me like pitching in
[1:51:23] school if some friends is preaching
[1:51:27] because great how did he know anything
[1:51:31] about who I will become but God knew
[1:51:34] that and he put me in a certain position
[1:51:37] on world we have to defend God's Word
[1:51:40] where I need to stand against the fast
[1:51:44] dog train that was not so easy someone
[1:51:47] within your reach in this cottage in
[1:51:50] this quotation didn't understand I was

[1:52:23] he's God no working here is God's
[1:52:27] presence here is the same yesterday and
[1:52:29] forever now you have to defend that you
[1:52:33] must now be careful against all the
[1:52:37] doctrines that that's the thing
[1:52:40] happening in Africa we have so many many
[1:52:43] doctrines but only few people stay know
[1:52:46] God's Word
[1:52:47] I remember my father when he came in
[1:52:49] Kenya last year he was telling me son
[1:52:52] you know what we are in a broad gauge
[1:52:57] age we are on a brandade if you are

[1:53:11] somewhere else we are not where we used
[1:53:14] to be like missing here God still moves
[1:53:19] to the edges from Paul to William
[1:53:23] brother God is moving now from wheeler
[1:53:26] Burnham is up to the rapture God we
[1:53:29] still moving we're gonna just stop
[1:53:31] somewhere no we cannot stop girls move
[1:53:35] it was Timmy you know now we are on a
[1:53:39] brad hitch and our soul is already
[1:53:43] ruptured I was okay like now it's yeah
[1:53:47] you say I since the foundation we were
[1:53:51] sealed before the foundation our so was
[1:53:54] robbed before the foundation we are just
[1:53:57] like in a mood where God is watching you
[1:54:00] what he did God is just watching us you
[1:54:04] know moving like what we are doing now
[1:54:07] it has happened no time ago before the
[1:54:09] foundation and God knew it he said no
[1:54:12] son we are on abroad 8 now and when I
[1:54:16] came here the process of switching that
[1:54:19] and last week was watching a preaching
[1:54:26] from someone
[1:54:27] Kenya he was saying that we are not
[1:54:30] blood a choice you know
[1:54:31] now some people they are you know now
[1:54:34] they are they became too close to the
[1:54:36] truth now they are now starting
[1:54:39] preaching that everywhere we are now
[1:54:41] brat eh yeah God has his people
[1:54:44] everywhere now we are connected through
[1:54:47] the spirit of god I've never knew that
[1:54:49] but uh our posture here we preach that
[1:54:54] one day I would never do that I came in
[1:54:56] and he said I was well that's true and I
[1:54:59] would some or some way pastor was
[1:55:03] preaching that we are on abroad hate
[1:55:05] soon we are going to get raptured
[1:55:07] see now yeah something is happening but
[1:55:10] there are some people does this sleepy
[1:55:13] there's this sleeping in the world
[1:55:17] sleeping and fighting I get that they
[1:55:20] don't change or stuff but God's Word is
[1:55:23] moving and the rapture will be something
[1:55:27] like nothing will happen like in a war
[1:55:31] you know it's just been no more just
[1:55:34] normal thing no me and the church will
[1:55:37] still be hoping people we still go to
[1:55:40] church career a viable preachy also the
[1:55:45] gospel but rapture has already take
[1:55:48] place that was all I passed through
[1:55:54] through through my life and he brought
[1:55:58] me in a certain place where I cannot be
[1:56:00] shaken anymore you cannot be shaking
[1:56:04] anymore and you you you cannot get blind
[1:56:07] anymore because you have your promises
[1:56:10] here no one we will tell you something
[1:56:14] out of this Bible if there is something
[1:56:17] out of this bubble so it's not kind of a
[1:56:19] chemical for the Bible put that away
[1:56:22] those are not the connecting I I face I
[1:56:26] was studying facing them now telling the
[1:56:31] truth about a message leave another
[1:56:34] message standing on a message now
[1:56:37] preaching to them
[1:56:40] them what they're doing is a scene yeah
[1:56:43] and those are the thing I face on my
[1:56:47] life and I remember one day also I was
[1:56:52] not screeching you know because we we
[1:56:55] wish to have a place where I used to
[1:56:59] exhort so many times in school I was
[1:57:03] calling them we will make so many
[1:57:05] religion it was having that's heart of
[1:57:11] tell them the truth
[1:57:13] today they what they are doing is known
[1:57:15] the truth being a Catholic will not save
[1:57:18] you being a producer will not save you
[1:57:20] is God who save now you must know God's
[1:57:24] path pathway now you must know know
[1:57:28] God's pathway now you would be Bible say
[1:57:31] God has never done anything without
[1:57:33] saying something to the Prophet I will
[1:57:37] study them now we must find out who's
[1:57:39] the Prophet now who is the prophet
[1:57:42] listen no we know the Prophet program
[1:57:45] you know he was a great teacher but I

[1:58:13] them you move don't stay there for see
[1:58:16] them to see them no just say one word
[1:58:19] and move and that one will be taken to
[1:58:22] the judgment yes

[1:58:27] is a heart like what as heart before a
[1:58:30] car if someone came and and like on a
[1:58:33] judgment throne and that person has has
[1:58:38] never heard God's word God cannot judge
[1:58:40] him he will be judged based on what
[1:58:44] God's Word that's why there they must
[1:58:47] hear this word everywhere

[2:03:38] could comment on all that brother Weiser
[2:03:40] said we think it would take me another
[2:03:43] couple of hours and I don't think we
[2:03:47] would need that right now
[2:03:48] or want it serviced are that not at
[2:03:56] seven but did you say that we take God
[2:04:02] for our brothers testimony of the grace
[2:04:05] of God it is Grace every one of us if we
[2:04:09] ever get up and testify we testify of
[2:04:11] grace a man is not me is not you is
[2:04:15] thinking that we're we're smart or
[2:04:17] anything like that no no it's the grace
[2:04:20] of God what I know I know by grace what
[2:04:24] I can do I do by the grace of God amen
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:28] the life you live you you you live by
[2:04:30] the grace of God because there's our
[2:04:32] brother brought it we do it we do have
[2:04:34] an enemy and that's the devil now and
[2:04:37] he's there and I would like to comment
[2:04:41] on some some of the things I've rather
[2:04:43] mentioned first of all I as our brother
[2:04:47] was standing here I said is this brother
[2:04:49] John and because I said who is it and I
[2:04:57] don't know if this other Saints here
[2:04:59] knew it or not but he looks like brother
[2:05:04] Macondo Sun died
[2:05:07] you know I see my eyes them as soon died
[2:05:12] I said where's John - so they of course
[2:05:17] hakuna tai-kun dies from africa - but
[2:05:21] not put not from kenya not from congo so
[2:05:25] we thank the Lord for our brothers
[2:05:27] testimony of grace brother and it was as
[2:05:31] the finish dear tonight it was
[2:05:34] fulfilling his dream that he had that he
[2:05:37] dreamed that he was standing in a pulpit
[2:05:39] and he wasn't sure exactly what pulpit
[2:05:42] it was but then he ends up in this
[2:05:45] pulpit right here so this the grace of
[2:05:47] God not necessarily warning our brother
[2:05:52] but just informing our brother what was
[2:05:56] to come and now God fulfilled it and and
[2:06:01] he made some thoughts there and I made
[2:06:04] these notes regarding we overcome Satan
[2:06:07] or there was tremendous the scripture
[2:06:10] that he read it was it was a blessing
[2:06:13] and he read revelation 11 or 12 rather
[2:06:20] and verse 11 but just let me read just
[2:06:23] as verses before that and it says and
[2:06:26] there was war in heaven a man thank God
[2:06:30] for our brothers testimony bringing us
[2:06:32] back to the word and bringing us back to
[2:06:35] what God is doing as done and what God
[2:06:37] is doing amen and there was a war in
[2:06:41] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[2:06:44] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[2:06:46] and his angels brothers he that they had
[2:06:51] they got a war there we got a war here
[2:06:53] amen just understand don't don't think
[2:06:58] because you're a Christian that you're
[2:06:59] that you don't have anything to do with
[2:07:01] the devil he's going to be on your heels
[2:07:03] a lot more a man now that now that
[2:07:06] you're you're going in a different
[2:07:08] direction a man and it says and the
[2:07:12] dragon fought and his angels and
[2:07:14] prevailed not neither was their place
[2:07:17] found any more in heaven and the Great
[2:07:20] Dragon was cast
[2:07:21] out that all serpent a man thank God for
[2:07:26] the victory that our brother John got
[2:07:28] over the enemy because they were Satan
[2:07:31] Satan was there to try to influence his
[2:07:33] life as it was there to influence your
[2:07:35] life and mine a man but God gives the
[2:07:39] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:41] we've really got to come into that
[2:07:44] relationship with Christ we got to come
[2:07:47] into that experience a man where Jesus
[2:07:50] becomes the lord of our lives a man and
[2:07:53] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[2:07:56] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[2:07:59] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[2:08:02] out into the earth and his angels were
[2:08:04] cast out with him and it says and I
[2:08:07] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[2:08:10] is come salvation and strength and the
[2:08:14] Kingdom of our God and the power of his
[2:08:17] Christ amen grace in our Lord Jesus
[2:08:23] Christ the god brother God at grace God
[2:08:28] has Grace and it's all revealed through
[2:08:31] the Lord Jesus Christ amen if he's a
[2:08:34] testimony God was made flesh in Jesus to
[2:08:38] testify of his grace to manifest His
[2:08:41] grace to reveal His grace in you and in
[2:08:44] me amen
[2:08:45] now has come salvation and strength and
[2:08:48] the Kingdom of our God and the power of
[2:08:51] is Christ for the accuser of our
[2:08:56] brethren is cast down which accused them
[2:08:59] before our God day and night Alleluia
[2:09:03] we got the victory through our Lord
[2:09:05] Jesus Christ over the devil amen praise
[2:09:09] the Lord and they overcame him this was
[2:09:12] the verse that our brother read and they
[2:09:14] overcame him that I want you to notice
[2:09:16] this praise the Lord
[2:09:19] just let it be a revelation of hearts
[2:09:22] brother a reality and they overcame him
[2:09:25] by the blood of the Lamb don't stop
[2:09:29] there it's right don't stop there as I
[2:09:33] said they say say with my great
[2:09:35] were saved don't stop there but many do
[2:09:40] they say we're saved by grace weird no
[2:09:43] no we're saved by grace through faith a
[2:09:46] mayor so it's not just grace grace
[2:09:49] brings us a faith of Revelation and were
[2:09:52] challenged to believe it or not to
[2:09:55] believe it a man God wants us to believe
[2:09:58] it the devil is there to make us not
[2:10:00] believe it but it's by grace through
[2:10:03] faith and notice right here this verse
[2:10:05] 11 again that our brother John
[2:10:07] highlighted and they overcame him by the
[2:10:10] blood of the Lamb that's all no a man it
[2:10:16] goes further than that and by the word
[2:10:20] of their testimony hallelujah you got a
[2:10:24] you got a testimony of faith in the
[2:10:27] finished work of Calvary you got a
[2:10:29] testimony of faith in the Lord Jesus
[2:10:32] Christ that he is our Lord is our Savior
[2:10:36] a man again as I said before I was
[2:10:40] testifying to a Pentecostal brother and
[2:10:42] I said listen I said they want to know
[2:10:46] Jesus as their Savior but they don't
[2:10:48] want to miss their Lord always I never
[2:10:50] heard that before
[2:10:51] but he said that's right and that's the
[2:10:54] truth they'll acknowledge what Jesus is
[2:10:56] my Savior Jesus is my Savior but give
[2:10:58] them the word as I as our brother was
[2:11:01] challenged they even in his testimony to
[2:11:03] give the witness to others a man it was
[2:11:06] challenging them to to see if he was
[2:11:08] going to be Lord of their lives he was
[2:11:11] becoming Lord of our brother John's life
[2:11:13] a man not just to believe but now to now
[2:11:17] to let him control then let him em add
[2:11:20] the leadership in his life the control
[2:11:22] in his life the lordship of his life by
[2:11:25] the grace of God a man this is our
[2:11:27] brothers testimony being the son of a
[2:11:30] pastor and so on you're going from from
[2:11:33] just just you know just intellectually
[2:11:36] believing this intellectually
[2:11:37] identifying with the message and they'll
[2:11:39] actually identifying with Jesus and the
[2:11:42] word - to a personal relationship with
[2:11:45] Jesus a personal relationship with the
[2:11:47] word to worry because
[2:11:49] not just your savior he's your Lord a
[2:11:51] man is not now just believing now all
[2:11:55] Jesus did this for me thank you Jesus
[2:11:57] and go on no no now you accept them as
[2:12:00] your Lord and Savior a man not just as
[2:12:04] your Savior but come on does it easy
[2:12:07] your Lord are you doing what you do
[2:12:10] today
[2:12:10] and what you do we'll do tomorrow and
[2:12:13] it's not you but it's Christ in you a
[2:12:15] man it your your going forth in a life
[2:12:19] that's that's revealing the lordship of
[2:12:21] God a man that is Christ in you the hope
[2:12:25] of glory
[2:12:26] it's Christ in control it's crazy eating
[2:12:29] you
[2:12:30] it's Christ and in control of what you
[2:12:33] do what you do when you do where you do
[2:12:37] it this is this is good I noticed this
[2:12:41] one after our brother read it I said
[2:12:43] Lord I said it's not just the blood of
[2:12:45] the Lamb but it is the word of their
[2:12:47] testimony a man and what is the word of
[2:12:51] the testimony it's a confession of your
[2:12:53] faith
[2:12:54] it's an acknowledgment of faith praise
[2:12:57] the Lord because without faith you
[2:13:00] really wouldn't have a real testimony a
[2:13:02] man but if you got faith you got a real
[2:13:05] testimony amen
[2:13:07] I've saved by the grace of God through
[2:13:10] our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:13:13] this believe it this confess it this
[2:13:16] quote and live it I like he brought that
[2:13:19] out too it's walking in it it's not
[2:13:23] coming into the light it's walking in
[2:13:25] the light a man as I said not getting in
[2:13:28] the spirit is walking in the spirit by
[2:13:31] the grace of God many King as the
[2:13:33] prophet of God who warned us he said you
[2:13:35] can you can have the anointing on you 24
[2:13:37] hours a day said go to hell that's right
[2:13:40] but he see if is not in your heart
[2:13:42] it's got to be in your heart in your
[2:13:44] soul the Lord of your life a man and
[2:13:47] this is our brothers testimony is is God
[2:13:50] dealing with our brother to bring him to
[2:13:52] that place where Christ becomes the Lord
[2:13:55] of his life
[2:13:56] amen as a witness to his fat his family
[2:14:00] his friends and his
[2:14:01] neighbors praise the Lord and it says by
[2:14:07] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[2:14:09] their testimony and they loved not their
[2:14:13] lives unto death praise the Lord
[2:14:17] so they laid down their lives and they
[2:14:20] died to themselves is not dying just
[2:14:22] naturally but as duh is dying to
[2:14:24] yourself spiritually amen
[2:14:27] so it's not you that lives this Christ
[2:14:29] that liveth in you it's not brother John

[2:14:45] God brother
[2:14:47] so we overcome Satan by the blood of the
[2:14:50] Lamb and by the word of your testimony
[2:14:53] because you're going to test it your
[2:14:55] testimony is faith in God faith in the
[2:14:59] finished work of Calvary get thee behind
[2:15:02] me Satan a man for I I have I have power
[2:15:06] over all the power of the enemy Jesus
[2:15:09] gave his power over all the power of the
[2:15:11] devil
[2:15:12] a man god help us to have that faith
[2:15:15] that testimony and brother our brother
[2:15:19] brought out concerning his you know just
[2:15:22] his parents especially as as the son of
[2:15:27] a pastor and so on he's just going along
[2:15:31] with your parents and brother with
[2:15:33] sometimes you can fight but God would
[2:15:34] find that you were compromised but he
[2:15:38] went from the fear of his parents to the
[2:15:40] fear of God I trust you cut that a man
[2:15:45] so it wasn't just well I'm all right
[2:15:48] because my daddy is a pastor I'm all
[2:15:51] white all right because because I met a
[2:15:53] Christian family no you got to have a
[2:15:55] Christian experience a man and God we're
[2:15:59] dealing with our brother John and he
[2:16:01] brought our brother John to that place
[2:16:03] hallelujah
[2:16:04] and that's why he has the testimony that
[2:16:06] he had tonight
[2:16:07] hallelujah thank God I was raised in a
[2:16:12] Christian home oh yeah we
[2:16:15] as if is a big family nine children but
[2:16:20] I tell you this every Sunday we were in
[2:16:23] church we went to church Sunday morning
[2:16:25] we come home at our dinner we went to
[2:16:28] went back for Sunday school in the
[2:16:30] afternoon then we come back and at our
[2:16:32] suburb and went to church again for
[2:16:35] Sunday night
[2:16:35] amen and brother as I said the services
[2:16:40] were and went on to eleven twelve
[2:16:41] o'clock at night what yeah that was that
[2:16:45] was the old-fashioned Salvation Army and
[2:16:47] was even the old-fashioned Pentecost oh
[2:16:50] yeah
[2:16:50] praise the Lord to get into the spirit
[2:16:52] and and you that's one thing you didn't
[2:16:55] notice with the clock of course they
[2:16:58] never had clocks in a church back then
[2:17:00] no no no we were out of time and into
[2:17:04] eternity by the grace of God yeah and we
[2:17:08] sing and praise the Lord and they get up
[2:17:10] around the altar oh yeah if maybe
[2:17:13] sinners would come up and then then
[2:17:15] you'll find Christians coming up and
[2:17:16] standing around the altar singing right
[2:17:18] over there hands raised praise the Lord
[2:17:20] hallelujah saying same thing and of
[2:17:23] course sometimes whether it's our
[2:17:25] salvation army or Pentecost they would
[2:17:27] have those Jericho marches in the church
[2:17:29] yeah elevational off they never jury
[2:17:33] film artistic and they sing in the SA
[2:17:35] and march around the building oh yeah
[2:17:38] because they would go down the seats on
[2:17:41] the end there go back to go to enter the
[2:17:43] vestibule or the porch and they come in
[2:17:45] on the other side keep on going singing
[2:17:47] and praising the Lord oh yeah
[2:17:49] experience that in Hindi are the old
[2:17:52] fashioned Salvation Army and in
[2:17:54] Pentecost brother we come under the fear
[2:17:57] of God and the love of God by the grace
[2:18:00] of God through Christ
[2:18:01] everybody just it you you it's just the
[2:18:04] anointing of the Holy Ghost in you and
[2:18:06] you want to praise the Lord
[2:18:07] yeah but now we know that the Holy Ghost
[2:18:10] the Spirit is leaving it smooth it's
[2:18:14] moving away in more and more and more
[2:18:16] from the world but brother that's the
[2:18:19] rapture that is as our brother John
[2:18:22] broto concerning the rapture and the
[2:18:24] bride age because the anointing this
[2:18:28] the anointing is has moved away from the
[2:18:30] church ages and now it's in the bride to
[2:18:32] get them right out of here by grace god
[2:18:35] help us brother amen
[2:18:38] so our brother went from as it were just
[2:18:41] a fear of his parents and just going by
[2:18:44] what they wanted him to do tell he
[2:18:46] entered into an experience with God and
[2:18:48] now it wasn't what his parents was
[2:18:50] telling him it was what God was telling
[2:18:53] him he was following the leadership of
[2:18:55] the Holy Ghost in his heart and soul
[2:18:58] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[2:18:59] and our brother I I thought I said lord
[2:19:04] I see he's not testifying he's preacher
[2:19:09] yes
[2:19:10] Alleluia a man so and the grace of God
[2:19:15] to help us to good and he said confess
[2:19:17] your faith by the life you live that's
[2:19:20] true it's not just going to taught you
[2:19:23] can talk to people but what about living
[2:19:25] it go to live it because they can hear
[2:19:30] you say one thing and becae you live
[2:19:31] another so the grace of God that that
[2:19:35] we're going to go and live our testimony
[2:19:37] we're going to walk the talk by the
[2:19:40] grace of God amen
[2:19:44] and I like what he brought out
[2:19:46] concerning God created man and God works
[2:19:51] through me that's good
[2:19:53] amen that's that's a revelation as the
[2:19:58] tested us of absolutely amazing isn't it
[2:20:01] it's a revelation all right yeah because
[2:20:04] God God created man and then ever since
[2:20:06] he created man God's been working
[2:20:08] through me
[2:20:09] amen thank God for that and he also
[2:20:14] brought Oh concerning the devil
[2:20:16] identifying with the message well
[2:20:18] there's a scripture that I was going to
[2:20:22] read and I didn't but I will and it's in
[2:20:27] Ezekiel chapter 17 and it concerns two
[2:20:32] Eagles there's the there's the godly
[2:20:37] eagle and there's the devil's eagle
[2:20:40] a male there's the true eagle and
[2:20:43] there's a false one a male one is going
[2:20:47] to be a blessing to us and the other one
[2:20:50] accursed so we better make sure that we
[2:20:54] have focused on God's Eagle a man
[2:20:58] because Ezekiel is speaking about the
[2:21:01] planning of this of the plenty of that
[2:21:03] and his and his towards God's Eagle and
[2:21:07] it is to grow up and grow up and grow up
[2:21:10] to this to this eagle but it says it
[2:21:13] turned to the other eagle and it
[2:21:17] withered and died it's amazing all we we
[2:21:26] we thank God for oh yeah the revelation
[2:21:30] of Eagles Eagles Eagles there's a
[2:21:32] there's a radial and is it just a wrong
[2:21:35] eagle that's the truth so brother
[2:21:38] god help us he's my prayer turn with me
[2:21:44] to Ezekiel chapter 17
[2:21:57] and with exec you're 17 and verse one
[2:22:10] appreciate what our brother emphasized
[2:22:13] concerning God bringing us into the
[2:22:14] bride age and that's the age of the
[2:22:21] spoken word brother bound preach the
[2:22:25] message called why cry speak speak the
[2:22:29] word it's not you and your parents it's
[2:22:41] not you and your friends it's not you
[2:22:43] and other believers it's you and Jesus
[2:22:46] it comes down to that personal
[2:22:49] relationship with him and that brings
[2:22:52] you into a right relationship with your
[2:22:58] parents a right relationship with your
[2:23:01] friends a right relationship with other
[2:23:04] believers but you've got to start with
[2:23:07] Jesus amen and that's what God was
[2:23:10] dealing with in our brother John's life
[2:23:12] amen
[2:23:13] to bring him into that personal
[2:23:15] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:23:17] in Ezekiel chapter 17 he speaks of the
[2:23:21] parable of the great eagle and the word
[2:23:24] of the Lord came unto me saying son of
[2:23:27] man put forth a riddle and speak a
[2:23:31] parable unto the house of Israel and say
[2:23:35] thus saith the Lord God a great Eagle
[2:23:38] with great wings long winged full of
[2:23:44] feathers which had divers colors came
[2:23:48] unto Lebanon and took the highest branch
[2:23:51] of the cedar and he cropped off the top
[2:23:55] of his young twigs and carried it into a
[2:23:58] land of traffic and he said it in a city
[2:24:01] of merchants and he took also of the
[2:24:04] seed of the land and planted it in a
[2:24:07] fruitful
[2:24:08] he planted he placed it by great waters
[2:24:11] and said it as the willow tree and it
[2:24:15] grew and became a spreading vine of low
[2:24:19] stature whose branches turned toward him
[2:24:23] turned toward the great eagle and the
[2:24:27] roots thereof were under him so it
[2:24:29] became a vine and brought forth branches
[2:24:33] and shot forth Springs a man it was
[2:24:39] bringing forth what God intended for it
[2:24:44] to bring forth but verse seven says
[2:24:49] there was also another great eel with
[2:24:56] great wings and many feathers and be old
[2:24:59] his vine did bender roots to ward him
[2:25:03] and shot for their branches toward him
[2:25:07] that he might water it by the force of
[2:25:10] her plantation it was planted in a good
[2:25:15] soil by great waters that it might bring
[2:25:17] forth branches that it might bear fruit
[2:25:19] that it might be a goodly vine say
[2:25:24] though the Slayer of the Lord God shall
[2:25:27] it prosper because it changed its
[2:25:30] direction shall he not pull up the roots
[2:25:35] thereof and cut off the fruit thereof
[2:25:38] that it wither it shall wither in all
[2:25:43] the leaves of her spring even without
[2:25:46] great power so many people to pluck it
[2:25:49] up by the roots there all may be all
[2:25:53] being planet shall it prosper shall it
[2:25:56] not utterly wither when the east wind
[2:26:00] touches it it shall wither in the
[2:26:04] furrows where it grew we better make
[2:26:07] sure that we're facing the great Eagle
[2:26:09] of God a man not the devil we want God
[2:26:16] and God is looking for what we're
[2:26:17] looking for us to grow and mature and
[2:26:20] bring forth the bright
[2:26:21] bring forth the leaves and bring forth
[2:26:24] the fruit there are remain and this this
[2:26:27] is also confirmed by the by the parables
[2:26:30] that Jesus brought forth a man in
[2:26:33] Matthew 13 he brings four parables that
[2:26:36] type every church age amen and he talks
[2:26:40] about the planning of this and the
[2:26:42] plenty of that and he said and one
[2:26:46] brought forth note and they didn't bring
[2:26:48] forth no fruit why because it was
[2:26:52] plucked up it was changed and there are
[2:26:55] stairs believers today that are not
[2:26:57] bringing forth the fruit of the bright
[2:26:58] the the seed of the bride they're not
[2:27:06] bringing forth they did the likeness of
[2:27:08] the bride why because they're under
[2:27:11] under a false anointing see that brother
[2:27:14] God's in the word God's in the message
[2:27:16] but the Devils there too brother
[2:27:19] God was in the Garden of Eden but so was
[2:27:21] the devil amen all down true the man has
[2:27:25] had to deal with with with the Lord and
[2:27:28] he's also had to deal with the devil and
[2:27:30] it's been by the permissive will of God
[2:27:33] God has permitted it for a reason
[2:27:35] to bring out the true seed and the false
[2:27:37] seed they mean I trust by the grace of
[2:27:40] God that even in this assembly there's
[2:27:43] there's God and there's the devil amen
[2:27:46] oh yeah the first as the prophet of God
[2:27:48] has said and others have said the first
[2:27:50] one in church is the devil oh yeah
[2:27:53] he's here to distract us he's here to -
[2:27:56] it to interpret the word to us but God
[2:27:58] let let us let us recognize the devil
[2:28:01] rebuke him plead the blood against blood
[2:28:03] of Jesus against the devil amen let's
[2:28:07] stay with the Lord so we're going to
[2:28:08] have the right revelation of the word by
[2:28:11] the grace of God amen
[2:28:13] so I pray the grace of God that our
[2:28:15] brother John's testimony was a blessing
[2:28:17] to us a man and encouragement to us a
[2:28:20] man that that we have we we've been
[2:28:23] we've learned something God has taught
[2:28:25] us amen to be on our guard by the grace
[2:28:29] of God amen so brother
[2:28:33] our brothers on his guard even though
[2:28:36] he's the son of a pastor that makes no
[2:28:38] difference you could and like it like a
[2:28:40] lot of those like those here today that
[2:28:44] were so-called
[2:28:45] born in the message but was the message
[2:28:48] born in you
[2:28:51] there's many born in the message raised
[2:28:54] in the message but you have to add to
[2:28:56] the experience of the message being born
[2:28:58] in you is you got to let it have control
[2:29:02] to bring you to the new birth and that's
[2:29:04] why God had to do with our brother John
[2:29:06] because he was maybe born in the message
[2:29:09] born in in in under the ministry of a
[2:29:12] pastor and so on but he had he had to
[2:29:16] come to the place where the message had
[2:29:18] to be born in him and he had to be born
[2:29:20] by the Word of God amen and be and go
[2:29:25] forth him and bring forth email
[2:29:27] yeah grow up produce branches produce
[2:29:31] leaves but then you got to go on and
[2:29:33] produce fruit you got to bring forth the
[2:29:36] fruit of the Spirit the fruit of the
[2:29:39] revealed word for this hour and for this
[2:29:42] age amen
[2:29:44] God's God God's grace to us Lord bless
[2:29:47] you amen this make sure again we're
[2:29:52] under the right eagle in the message the
[2:30:00] indictment 1963 July the prophet of God
[2:30:08] says see what this nation is done that's
[2:30:11] what this people has done that's what
[2:30:14] these churches has done he said they
[2:30:16] have turned it down and they have
[2:30:20] crucified the message they have
[2:30:23] crucified the truth to the people and
[2:30:25] how did they do Jesus they put him to
[2:30:29] shame yeah they put Jesus to shame yeah
[2:30:39] they stripped his clothes off him on the
[2:30:43] cross he was naked they stripped his
[2:30:48] clothes off him and they hung him upon a
[2:30:50] cross and nailed him up there
[2:30:53] the prince of life and he said the same
[2:30:55] thing they've done today with their
[2:30:58] Creed's they'd done the same thing
[2:31:01] they've stripped the things and he said
[2:31:03] the goodness and the clothing of the
[2:31:05] gospel by trying to place it somewhere
[2:31:07] else and they've owned him on a cross
[2:31:09] and he said what did they do
[2:31:13] he said today he said man he said walk
[2:31:16] ignorant Lee and they don't know that's
[2:31:19] the truth they think it's some kind of
[2:31:21] ism and he said they don't dig down deep
[2:31:25] enough he said to get into the spirit of
[2:31:28] Revelation a man God's grace that we are
[2:31:33] into the Spirit of the revelation of
[2:31:35] what our brother John was ministering on
[2:31:37] and has said they don't pray enough they
[2:31:41] don't call upon God he know a man our
[2:31:45] brother was talking about it that he he
[2:31:49] was praying a lot a man but the prophet
[2:31:52] of God said in this hour that they don't
[2:31:54] pray enough and they don't call upon God
[2:31:57] enough and he said they just lately take
[2:31:59] it oh well I believe it's God sure the
[2:32:03] devil believes the same thing the devil
[2:32:06] believes it more than some people claim
[2:32:08] to believe it and he said the devil
[2:32:11] believes it and trembles but he said
[2:32:13] people just believe it and go on but he
[2:32:17] said the devil trembles knowing his
[2:32:19] judgment is coming amen that's why the
[2:32:23] enemy has against the true believers
[2:32:25] amen yet they're taking they're staying
[2:32:28] our brother John bought that out -
[2:32:30] taking their stand for the truth for the
[2:32:32] Word of God a man because the devil
[2:32:35] knows you're going to judge him amen and
[2:32:41] the people just believe it today so they
[2:32:44] go on but the devil trembles knowing his
[2:32:47] judgment is coming and the people
[2:32:49] believe it and don't pay no attention to
[2:32:52] the judgment
[2:32:53] that is coming god Elvis is my prayer
[2:32:58] grace brother sister that we're going to
[2:33:02] keep the right attitude and the right
[2:33:04] spirit and we're going to keep diggin
[2:33:06] into the word amen
[2:33:08] I believe our brother Visal testimony
[2:33:13] our brother John's testimony is helping
[2:33:15] us to dig more more into the truth of
[2:33:18] what God has done and what God is doing
[2:33:21] it this is the end it is the end of all
[2:33:26] things and really truly honestly we have
[2:33:31] gone out of the church ages into the
[2:33:35] bright age we are brothers sister I pray
[2:33:38] that we're not going to miss it as our
[2:33:41] brother was emphasizing we're not going
[2:33:44] to miss the revelation of the rapture
[2:33:48] don't let this the the things of this
[2:33:51] world and of this of your natural life
[2:33:55] get up get us away from the revelation
[2:33:57] of the rapture what God is doing in us
[2:34:02] by his word a man but the world today
[2:34:08] most today and even a lot of believers
[2:34:10] today are so caught up with the natural
[2:34:12] things of life that they're they're not
[2:34:15] as conscious as they should be of the
[2:34:17] spiritual right rather I pray that grace
[2:34:23] by grace we're looking to the
[2:34:25] resurrection in the rapture every day
[2:34:28] that every day were conscious this is
[2:34:31] the end that every day
[2:34:33] I trust that way that we're going to be
[2:34:36] praying Lord don't leave me behind
[2:34:38] we don't want as brother John warned
[2:34:41] again we don't want to be among those
[2:34:43] that that will be looking for a rapture
[2:34:46] and it's past where the scripture says
[2:34:50] it's already happened and you didn't
[2:34:52] know it didn't know it it's because they
[2:34:56] ignored it but God brother has already
[2:34:59] confirmed us through the opening of the
[2:35:02] word through what he has done in these
[2:35:03] last days
[2:35:04] it's a confirmation of the end
[2:35:06] it's a confirmation of the bride age
[2:35:08] it's a confirmation that the rapture is
[2:35:11] on amen
[2:35:14] oh yeah the redemption of our souls was
[2:35:18] already in progress in the Ministry of
[2:35:21] Jesus oh yeah
[2:35:23] so now the redemption of our bodies is
[2:35:27] already in progress
[2:35:28] amen sure the Ministry of Christ and the
[2:35:32] bride god help us that we're not going
[2:35:34] to ignore it and just oh just that's it
[2:35:38] that's just God it's just a prophet it's
[2:35:40] just wooden Branum brother that's all
[2:35:42] past that's history but we got to get
[2:35:47] into the present tense revelation on
[2:35:50] what God is doing Amen god bless you
