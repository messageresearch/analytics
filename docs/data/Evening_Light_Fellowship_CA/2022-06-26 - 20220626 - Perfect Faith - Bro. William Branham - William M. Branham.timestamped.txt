[50:06] [Music]
[50:14] praise the lord amen
[50:18] [Music]
[50:21] praise the lord
[50:23] amen
[50:25] we're going to have a message by the
[50:26] prophet and
[50:28] i thought i had the information here
[50:30] written down for a brother
[50:32] brother
[50:33] oh
[50:34] advisor here
[50:36] okay
[50:38] just to see now exactly
[50:40] oh my
[50:42] oh yes here it is
[50:44] the message is uh
[50:46] perfect faith
[50:48] amen and brother adam preached it in
[50:50] 1963 august the 25th
[50:53] and it'll be less than an hour of the
[50:55] portions that we're going to hear and
[50:57] we're praying the grace of god to be
[50:59] with us the grace of god be with those
[51:01] that are not with us amen and trusting
[51:03] that
[51:04] even though it's
[51:06] they're they're not here i trust by
[51:07] grace because it is on a sunday i trust
[51:10] that their spirit is is with us amen by
[51:13] the grace of god
[51:14] and no matter where you go oh my praise
[51:17] the lord brother ramsey one time if he
[51:20] went to a city and he said there was no
[51:22] message church there he always said he'd
[51:24] go look for the the pentecostal church
[51:27] oh yeah he said i i'll go to the
[51:29] pentecost church he said why to worship
[51:32] the lord
[51:33] amen so i pray the grace of god that our
[51:35] brothers and sisters wherever they are
[51:37] they'll stay mindful of the lord
[51:39] amen they'll stay mindful that that
[51:42] maybe millions around the world will be
[51:44] worshipping them today amen
[51:46] lord so i pray the grace of god that
[51:48] will worship him in the hearing of the
[51:50] word the going further the word because
[51:52] faith comes by hearing
[51:54] amen hearing the word
[51:56] by the grace of god and again it's the
[51:58] faith that pleases god so i trust that
[52:01] we're going to hear the word
[52:02] hear the revelation hear thus sayeth the
[52:04] lord and here it is written amen and
[52:08] again this again as i said the republic
[52:10] god brought this message in his own
[52:12] tabernacle in the branham tabernacle in
[52:14] jeffersonville
[52:16] august 1963
[52:18] and of course it is one of the
[52:21] message that believers highlight
[52:23] oh yes there's there's a number of
[52:24] messages that we go through and
[52:27] especially if the prophet preached it in
[52:28] jeffersonville we put some emphasis on
[52:31] it because if he had the more liberty
[52:33] and the more freedom to preach whatever
[52:35] the lord laid on his heart when he was
[52:37] in jeffersonville amen so so pay close
[52:41] attention to the word amen and to what
[52:43] he's saying god is requiring it of us
[52:47] oh yes
[52:48] so brother sister we're going to answer
[52:50] for what he's preaching
[52:52] answer for what he has preached and
[52:55] brother and what he's preaching here in
[52:56] benham tabernacle
[52:58] and it's a tremendous message and for me
[53:00] at least anyhow because i've been
[53:02] through this message a number of times
[53:04] and as i've said before
[53:07] i said if you can see the message
[53:09] oh
[53:10] it's green it's orange it's yellow
[53:13] and it's uh underlined with the with the
[53:15] pen
[53:16] that's the different times i went
[53:18] through this message
[53:20] and one time basically the first time
[53:22] maybe i underlined it with pen
[53:24] and maybe the first time i ever read the
[53:26] message
[53:27] some years ago and then when another
[53:29] time it went through oh yeah and i
[53:31] highlighted certain things with yellow
[53:33] certain things with orange certain
[53:35] things with green and so on amen why
[53:37] because oh every time we go through it
[53:39] we we
[53:41] we catch certain things we never caught
[53:43] before
[53:44] amen so let's be on our guard the
[53:46] stoners don't assume oh it's just
[53:48] another message by william branham
[53:50] it's another message all right but it's
[53:52] another message by the prophet
[53:55] oh yes and brother there's there's
[53:57] messages that god ordained him to
[53:59] minister and to preach and especially in
[54:02] jeffersonville amen in his own in his
[54:05] own assembly
[54:06] and i think this is one of the most
[54:08] important messages that the prophet has
[54:10] highlighted
[54:11] perfect faith so i pray the grace of god
[54:15] challenge our faith
[54:17] do you have perfect faith amen oh faith
[54:21] is a revelation so we got the perfect
[54:23] revelation
[54:24] you better you better have it
[54:26] in your heart
[54:28] not in your head
[54:29] oh we got the perfect revelation of the
[54:31] word god said this god said that yes
[54:34] but is it really faith
[54:36] that you believe faith is that we
[54:38] believe amen so brother we believe thus
[54:41] saith the lord we believe it is written
[54:45] by the grace of god and the prophet of
[54:48] god in another message he said speak the
[54:50] word and he said why cry he said speak
[54:54] amen why i'll tell you this if the devil
[54:57] is going to listen to anything he'll
[54:59] listen to the word
[55:00] oh yeah
[55:02] he is one if there's anything that he
[55:03] fears it's the word of god amen so i
[55:07] trust by the grace of god well i pray
[55:08] grace that we got more faith than the
[55:10] devil god
[55:12] he's come to a great wrath as i said the
[55:14] other night he knowing his time is short
[55:18] how did you know that he knows that by
[55:19] the word
[55:20] you know that by the revelation of of of
[55:22] god
[55:23] through the ages and so on so brother
[55:26] what out we to know
[55:28] amen
[55:29] satan is there and oh yeah
[55:31] and only that he's got great wrath he's
[55:34] angry but he's also fearful
[55:36] so i pray lord
[55:38] that we have the fear of the lord that
[55:39] we're going to pay attention to the word
[55:41] the devil fears god and he pays
[55:43] attention to the word
[55:44] oh he knows
[55:46] he knows that god never said this and
[55:47] he's oh
[55:49] he might do it and he may not do it he
[55:50] knows god's going to do it
[55:52] oh yeah because he knows the word will
[55:54] never fail praise the lord
[55:57] so i trust by grace that we believe the
[55:59] word that we're going to keep feeding on
[56:02] the word by the grace of god amen so
[56:05] lord bless us
[56:06] and let's sing only believe all things
[56:09] are possible only believe as we go to
[56:12] the word and to give
[56:14] this to our brother oh our sister or
[56:18] sister

[56:22] you know when to start the message where
[56:23] to start it rather and where to stop it

[1:03:09] perfect faith
[1:03:15] by the grace of god
[1:03:20] to turn to mark saint mark 11th chapter
[1:03:24] of saint martin
[1:03:26] and we're going to begin to read about
[1:03:29] the the 22nd
[1:03:32] verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark
[1:03:36] and many of you know this scripture it's
[1:03:38] very familiar
[1:03:40] it was a scripture i was thinking on
[1:03:43] uh brother russell when those when he
[1:03:45] spoke to me and said about those
[1:03:47] squirrels
[1:03:48] and they that was just the very
[1:03:50] scripture i was thinking of it's always
[1:03:52] been a puzzle he said if ye say
[1:03:56] not if i say if you say
[1:04:00] now let us read
[1:04:02] jesus answering
[1:04:03] said unto them have faith in god
[1:04:07] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:04:10] shall say unto this mountain
[1:04:12] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:04:15] the sea
[1:04:16] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:04:20] but shall believe that those saints
[1:04:22] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:04:26] shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:30] therefore i say unto you
[1:04:32] what things forever you desire
[1:04:35] when you pray believe that ye receive
[1:04:39] them and you shall have them
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:44] when you stand please forgive
[1:04:47] if you have all against any
[1:04:49] that your father also
[1:04:52] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:04:54] may forgive you your trespass
[1:04:57] but if you do not forgive
[1:04:59] neither will your
[1:05:01] father which is in heaven forgive your
[1:05:04] trespasses
[1:05:06] now
[1:05:08] faith is based on
[1:05:10] forgiveness now
[1:05:13] and then as we said this morning trying
[1:05:16] to get the church into the place to
[1:05:18] where we could
[1:05:19] really see
[1:05:20] apostolic times moving among us that's
[1:05:24] what we all hunger
[1:05:26] and it's just laying right at the door
[1:05:27] yeah we see it
[1:05:29] but we want to see more of it
[1:05:32] we wanted such a flow that it it'll be a
[1:05:34] help to us to flow out to others
[1:05:38] remember
[1:05:39] jesus as we had in the lesson this
[1:05:41] morning he never used his power for
[1:05:43] himself
[1:05:45] he used it for others
[1:05:47] that's what it was set for and you think
[1:05:50] sometimes why would a man
[1:05:53] that was so full of power like him would
[1:05:56] have ever be sick yes sir
[1:06:00] i've read and some books somewhere where
[1:06:03] when he raised up that boy for the
[1:06:05] widow's son from nan
[1:06:07] i believe that prince the house of david
[1:06:09] that he stepped on a rock and thrown
[1:06:11] with a headache
[1:06:13] he bore our infirmities bear means to
[1:06:16] pack
[1:06:21] like we have he had sickness he had
[1:06:24] temptations he had trouble he had
[1:06:26] flusteration just as we have because he
[1:06:29] had to be the right kind of a mediator
[1:06:32] so he had to be partakers the husband
[1:06:34] and of the fruit before you even know
[1:06:37] the woman has to well and many things
[1:06:39] see if we look right into the scripture
[1:06:42] now i want to say that i believe every
[1:06:44] scripture never been up to this room
[1:06:47] thus critics today that don't want to
[1:06:49] believe that
[1:06:51] a critic once said that when jesus
[1:06:54] sent those disciples to where that cult
[1:06:56] was high
[1:06:58] or two ways met that he pre-arranged
[1:07:00] that
[1:07:01] for where that quote was time
[1:07:04] see they don't understand that god
[1:07:06] rearranges
[1:07:08] god
[1:07:09] told me other day was brother down here
[1:07:12] that i would shake his hand on the
[1:07:14] street again
[1:07:15] that's very strange i wasn't here that
[1:07:17] morning
[1:07:18] but two minutes longer or a minute
[1:07:21] longer i have not met him on the street
[1:07:22] but i stepped off the car just in time
[1:07:25] to shake his hands when he was coming in
[1:07:26] on the street he didn't know
[1:07:30] he had his glasses off he couldn't see
[1:07:31] me when he heard my voice he started
[1:07:33] crying
[1:07:34] what was it usually he doesn't do that
[1:07:36] but it was the answer to what was told
[1:07:38] him up there under the oxygen he would
[1:07:40] do it i said you were also set in the
[1:07:43] church again
[1:07:45] his heart's desire was having chicago
[1:07:47] meeting he wanted to come to that
[1:07:50] meeting his heart was part
[1:07:52] i sent him a telegram and greetings for
[1:07:53] us the children told him was praying
[1:07:55] that he could get well right quick
[1:07:58] and a loving brother who visited him
[1:08:00] said
[1:08:01] that you he just wanted to come so bad
[1:08:04] but here he says tonight
[1:08:06] see that was not
[1:08:08] pre-arranged the same god arranges he
[1:08:12] makes everything work perfectly on the
[1:08:14] dollar amen a critic once said
[1:08:17] that no wonder jesus could take five
[1:08:19] loaves and feed five thousand said the
[1:08:22] loaves were bigger in that day and he
[1:08:24] just cut each soap to feed a thousand
[1:08:27] i'll give you to understand a little boy
[1:08:29] had it in his lunch
[1:08:34] a little child packed
[1:08:36] five bowls of bread that could feed five
[1:08:38] thousand people
[1:08:40] then what about the twelve basketballs
[1:08:42] taking up action
[1:08:44] oh they just
[1:08:46] that's just critics that's awesome that
[1:08:48] doesn't change god's word
[1:08:50] it's just the same thing moves on now
[1:08:54] we want to speak now upon faith and a
[1:08:57] different type of faith perfect faith
[1:09:01] that's a great thing
[1:09:03] now a faith we're told in the bible
[1:09:07] faith cometh by hearing
[1:09:10] now you cannot be saved without faith
[1:09:14] and faith is something that you have to
[1:09:16] believe is there
[1:09:18] that really nothing else will detect
[1:09:20] there but faith
[1:09:22] now
[1:09:23] i'm trying to
[1:09:25] bring faith to you so that you can be
[1:09:27] ready for this prayer line in the next
[1:09:29] few minutes
[1:09:31] now
[1:09:32] faith he that cometh to god must believe
[1:09:36] that he is
[1:09:38] and it's impossible to to please god
[1:09:41] without faith
[1:09:43] you cannot please
[1:09:45] and if you say you believe god you have
[1:09:47] never seen him
[1:09:48] see
[1:09:49] so then you've got to believe it by
[1:09:51] faith and if you could sin it would be
[1:09:53] no more faith
[1:09:55] the anything that the census declares is
[1:09:57] no more faith it's a scientific fact see
[1:10:01] it's not no more faith but you have to
[1:10:03] accept him by faith
[1:10:05] and he that cometh to god
[1:10:08] must believe god and faith comes by
[1:10:11] hearing the word of god amen
[1:10:15] you must first believe this is god's
[1:10:18] word
[1:10:20] and you must come to
[1:10:23] god by the word amen see
[1:10:26] just take the word what it says and
[1:10:29] that's right
[1:10:30] everything else contrary to it is not
[1:10:32] right
[1:10:34] abraham had to believe just what that
[1:10:36] boss told him
[1:10:38] and when he was 100 years old 25 years
[1:10:41] later he was stronger believe that he
[1:10:43] was 25 years ago when it was given to
[1:10:45] him
[1:10:47] he believed it
[1:10:48] and he staggered not at the promise
[1:10:51] of god through unbelief but was strong
[1:10:54] giving praise to god knowing
[1:10:57] that he was able to perform what he
[1:11:00] promised
[1:11:01] that's why everyone must be that way you
[1:11:03] must come with an unfailing faith
[1:11:07] believing that god made the promise
[1:11:10] but now you have to be in a position to
[1:11:12] have that faith and that's what we're
[1:11:13] going to talk about
[1:11:14] to receive that faith
[1:11:17] in hebrews the book of hebrews 11th
[1:11:19] chapter we are told that faith is
[1:11:23] the substance of things hoped far
[1:11:26] now here's where many people
[1:11:28] fail to receive
[1:11:31] their healing or what they're asking for
[1:11:33] because they take faith to be something
[1:11:37] that it is not
[1:11:39] see they don't believe it
[1:11:41] it's um
[1:11:42] it's not a
[1:11:45] imagination
[1:11:46] it is a actual substance
[1:11:52] now listen closely
[1:11:55] it is not what you imagine
[1:11:58] it's just as real to you as any sense of
[1:12:01] your body will declare anything else
[1:12:03] it's just as real as my eyes says this
[1:12:07] is a piece of paper
[1:12:09] it's just as real as to say that that
[1:12:11] that is a lie
[1:12:14] it's just as real as the that i feel my
[1:12:16] coat
[1:12:18] it's just as real as the
[1:12:20] as i hear that baby talking uh there or
[1:12:24] making this noise see it's just that
[1:12:26] real it's music playing
[1:12:28] it's just as real as i taste anything in
[1:12:30] my mouth
[1:12:32] it is that real only you can't show it
[1:12:35] to somebody else
[1:12:37] you have our own
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] it's yours
[1:12:42] faith is the substance amen see it's not
[1:12:47] just a myth so many people come out
[1:12:49] these are real deep lessons
[1:12:53] and i'll catch the top of it and then
[1:12:55] you dig down in it
[1:12:57] notice
[1:12:58] it is something that you possess
[1:13:02] not imagination
[1:13:04] if you really have it
[1:13:07] it's just as real to you as any other
[1:13:10] thing that could be it's just as real as
[1:13:13] as you know that that you're riding your
[1:13:15] automobile it's just as real as you know
[1:13:18] that you're studying in the church
[1:13:20] it's just as real as you hear my boy
[1:13:23] it is a substance
[1:13:25] not an imagination not an emotion
[1:13:28] but something that you have
[1:13:31] and it comes to you by hearing the word
[1:13:34] of god in that only
[1:13:36] amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:13:39] the word of god
[1:13:41] that puts it back
[1:13:43] so where
[1:13:44] your faith in is not in some individual
[1:13:48] it's not in a man it's not an
[1:13:50] organization it's not in a group of
[1:13:52] people it's in god because god is the
[1:13:55] word amen
[1:13:57] your faith is in god they promised by
[1:14:01] hearing the word of god
[1:14:04] then when god by his word not what
[1:14:07] somebody else did somebody else did
[1:14:10] but by what god's word said
[1:14:13] he said let every man's words be alive
[1:14:16] and mine be true amen
[1:14:18] now you see somebody else do something
[1:14:22] by a word act of god or promise of god
[1:14:26] and many of them say i can do that too
[1:14:28] it's an imagination
[1:14:31] and when they do you find them rigged up
[1:14:33] out there somewhere yes
[1:14:35] it's got to be a substance
[1:14:38] now that is potentially a faith that is
[1:14:42] something that would bring you to a
[1:14:44] faith
[1:14:45] it's potentially like if you ask me for
[1:14:48] an oak tree and i'll give you an acorn
[1:14:51] potato you have an oak tree but it
[1:14:53] hasn't produced itself yet but when it
[1:14:55] really brings itself out it is an oak
[1:14:58] tree
[1:14:59] and when you imagine that god does this
[1:15:02] but when it's revealed to you it's a
[1:15:04] faith thing
[1:15:05] perfect faith that cannot fail
[1:15:09] yeah that's the reason those visions are
[1:15:11] so
[1:15:12] so tremendous to me
[1:15:14] because it's been proved right every
[1:15:16] time
[1:15:17] see
[1:15:18] and i know that he promised that and he
[1:15:21] promised in his word and here he comes
[1:15:22] and promises for this day therefore you
[1:15:25] know where you're standing when he says
[1:15:27] so
[1:15:28] that gives me a faith because he never
[1:15:31] does nothing contrary to his written
[1:15:33] word
[1:15:34] see and if it was contrary to the word i
[1:15:36] couldn't have faith in it
[1:15:38] brings it right back again to the word
[1:15:40] see faith in hearing the word of god you
[1:15:43] must share the word god's word is that
[1:15:46] all sufficient word that's all you have
[1:15:49] need of is this word
[1:15:50] now faith being the substance and in
[1:15:53] there we find out in hebrews what faith
[1:15:57] was and what those did who had faith
[1:16:01] see there's many times that people have
[1:16:03] faith today and tomorrow they haven't
[1:16:05] got it the next day there's something
[1:16:07] and something else but when god wants
[1:16:09] anchors
[1:16:10] and you see us there's nothing ever
[1:16:12] going to make you move from it
[1:16:15] you're just poking
[1:16:16] reaching pursuing and pursuing this
[1:16:19] adventure without authority you're just
[1:16:21] trying this and trying this and go to
[1:16:23] this one and run here and run there you
[1:16:25] haven't got the faith yet
[1:16:27] but when
[1:16:28] that is what we call things
[1:16:31] excuse me i want you to thank you
[1:16:34] i i want you to get this now we the
[1:16:38] church has got to lift itself in the
[1:16:40] power of god
[1:16:41] how we're too close to the end now
[1:16:44] and i believe the church is in condition
[1:16:47] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:16:49] things and rub some of this make-believe
[1:16:52] out
[1:16:53] get into something real
[1:16:55] see it's got to be something that you
[1:16:58] know
[1:17:00] if you say um uh brother branham uh
[1:17:04] that isn't the line
[1:17:06] yet i'll know it's a lie
[1:17:09] how do you know it's right i'm looking
[1:17:12] at it
[1:17:13] well how do you know what you could be
[1:17:14] wrong my side has always declared to me
[1:17:17] that that was life
[1:17:19] see
[1:17:19] and that's the reason i believe those
[1:17:21] visions because it's always declared to
[1:17:23] me the truth that comes from the word
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:27] then if he says it that settles it
[1:17:29] now when it's declared like that there's
[1:17:31] no more guesswork
[1:17:32] it's going to be
[1:17:34] then you hear it just pass the law see
[1:17:37] because
[1:17:38] it's beyond the human thinking it's up
[1:17:41] into the realm of the large
[1:17:43] but you're standing here just as divine
[1:17:46] just as a branch producing the fruit
[1:17:49] that's in the vine
[1:17:50] see god uses now and man only
[1:17:53] god doesn't use machinery god doesn't
[1:17:55] use groups to man god doesn't use
[1:17:57] organization god uses individuals
[1:18:00] always
[1:18:02] now faith
[1:18:03] is the substance and by we understand
[1:18:06] all those things are done it's not a
[1:18:09] it's not a imagination it is a substance
[1:18:13] especially
[1:18:14] perfect faith that's what i'm talking
[1:18:16] all tonight getting to perfect faith
[1:18:19] it is not an imagination
[1:18:21] now other just people can say well i got
[1:18:23] all faith oh i sure have or are you
[1:18:26] standing here for us you can see
[1:18:28] see your your very actions prove that
[1:18:31] you haven't got what you're talking
[1:18:33] about
[1:18:34] see
[1:18:35] if you have faith in where you're
[1:18:36] standing for airlines
[1:18:38] what do you do these things for see if
[1:18:40] you had perfect faith you'd look right
[1:18:43] straight to god and believe it and walk
[1:18:44] away and you would you would have no
[1:18:47] need of coming into a crowd
[1:18:49] you'd have no need of these things
[1:18:51] because your faith has done made it so
[1:18:54] and i see
[1:18:56] what would be the use for me saying i
[1:18:57] got to put a shirt on
[1:19:00] i got a shirt on
[1:19:02] how do you know you got a shirt
[1:19:04] or i see it feel it and i know it's
[1:19:07] there well that's just how real that
[1:19:10] when perfect faith takes the whole
[1:19:13] you don't need no more great god already
[1:19:15] done you know hallelujah how do you do
[1:19:18] it faith tells me so hey man that's it
[1:19:21] see do you get it now one of these
[1:19:23] that's perfect faith not always i'm
[1:19:26] venturing out well i'll go the bible
[1:19:29] stick hold the elders let them know i
[1:19:30] want to pray over i know i'll go and you
[1:19:33] say well i'm going to be healed you're
[1:19:34] making yourself don't watch how you're
[1:19:36] going to make yourself just it's worked
[1:19:38] out
[1:19:39] then when he passed you you say
[1:19:41] oh i still don't feel see there he was
[1:19:45] you didn't have faith
[1:19:47] your genuine faithful do it right there
[1:19:49] your your 29 faith will make it so
[1:19:52] surreal to you that
[1:19:53] look at the other woman with the blood
[1:19:55] issue she said if i can only touch the
[1:19:57] border of his garment i'll be made well
[1:19:59] and as soon as she did it she said she
[1:20:02] felt within herself that her blood
[1:20:04] issues stopped and
[1:20:07] she actually believed it
[1:20:10] and when she touched it the through that
[1:20:13] stopped it stopped jesus turned and said
[1:20:16] who touched me
[1:20:18] that's perfect faith
[1:20:20] and that same perfect faith tonight will
[1:20:23] touch jesus christ just as it did then
[1:20:26] a woman come with a perfect faith for
[1:20:28] that time
[1:20:30] now
[1:20:31] now we see
[1:20:33] at first the disciples didn't have this
[1:20:36] perfect faith
[1:20:38] they didn't have it
[1:20:39] because they had christ walking with him
[1:20:43] but then afterwards christ was in that
[1:20:45] amen and so you see
[1:20:48] it's hard then to have this perfect
[1:20:50] faith
[1:20:52] without the holy spirit
[1:20:54] it has to bring it
[1:20:56] it does now you say the disciples didn't
[1:20:58] have perfect faith no
[1:21:00] or they had an epileptic child there
[1:21:03] that they were trying to cast this devil
[1:21:05] and they couldn't do it
[1:21:07] and the father seen jesus coming and he
[1:21:10] said we have brought my son
[1:21:12] to your disciples and they could not
[1:21:15] cure him
[1:21:18] and afterwards the disciples asked jesus
[1:21:21] saying why could not we cure him and
[1:21:24] jesus says because of the lack of faith
[1:21:28] and of your unbelief
[1:21:30] that's right because of your unbelief
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:34] i remember
[1:21:35] they had this house
[1:21:38] jesus had given them power
[1:21:40] the healer was sick to raise the dead
[1:21:42] and cast out devils just a few days
[1:21:44] before that yeah
[1:21:46] they had the power
[1:21:48] but not the faith
[1:21:50] to use the power
[1:21:52] now there's the brand tabernacle there's
[1:21:54] the church the bride today
[1:21:56] the holy spirit is shared with the power
[1:21:59] amen but you haven't got that faith and
[1:22:02] movement
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:05] see what it means
[1:22:10] to move it
[1:22:11] here i got a shell that i hand loaded i
[1:22:14] know what it'll do by ballistic like the
[1:22:16] word
[1:22:17] but i've got to fire the gun
[1:22:20] the fire has to get to the powder the
[1:22:23] powder's got the power but it's got to
[1:22:24] have the fire to light off
[1:22:27] and the same thing that powers in the
[1:22:29] shell
[1:22:30] but it needs
[1:22:31] bait to charge it
[1:22:34] and throw it out
[1:22:36] that's what it takes
[1:22:38] the perfect faith to ignite the power of
[1:22:42] the holy spirit which we have now since
[1:22:44] he's come upon us amen faith to ignite
[1:22:48] to see great things
[1:22:51] the faith something that presents it to
[1:22:54] you for the heart full of joy you walk
[1:22:57] into the stick room knowing exactly what
[1:22:58] you're going to say
[1:23:02] something's already been revealed and
[1:23:04] you know it
[1:23:05] when you walk in in the name of jesus
[1:23:07] christ rise up from there
[1:23:09] say up the law
[1:23:11] here you are that's a perfect faith
[1:23:13] if there's these 10 million people
[1:23:16] centered it wouldn't happen you know
[1:23:17] what's going to happen anyhow
[1:23:18] because you know it
[1:23:20] is going to happen regardless what
[1:23:23] anybody else says you're the ones got
[1:23:24] the faith
[1:23:26] could you imagine joshua
[1:23:29] he called the elders of israel together
[1:23:31] and said uh
[1:23:32] brethren we are the servants of the lord
[1:23:35] i would like for you to say uh ask the
[1:23:38] lord if it'd be all right if uh if he'd
[1:23:40] give us a little more sunlight see and
[1:23:43] hold his son
[1:23:45] no
[1:23:46] he has need of it and without prayer
[1:23:49] without anything he had need of it and
[1:23:52] he just commanded the son
[1:23:55] he said stand there amen
[1:23:58] i have need
[1:24:00] and i'm in the service of the lord
[1:24:02] and he sent me over here to do this job
[1:24:06] and i'm doing the best i don't know how
[1:24:08] and the enemy is routed
[1:24:10] and they're out in here if i let the sun
[1:24:11] go down they'll get together and cause
[1:24:13] me more trouble so stand still
[1:24:17] hang there
[1:24:19] hey man
[1:24:20] for 24 hours
[1:24:24] now if the world's turning it holds it
[1:24:26] up and the sun stays in the place and it
[1:24:28] don't run what happened then
[1:24:31] that's right
[1:24:32] now you make yourself a infidel
[1:24:35] if you say
[1:24:36] this and then if you don't you shouldn't
[1:24:38] full of science because they said the
[1:24:39] world stop and drop
[1:24:41] so now
[1:24:42] if you say god's word's not right then
[1:24:44] you're there for them
[1:24:45] yeah
[1:24:47] but it happened that's the main game
[1:24:49] i don't know the mechanics of it but it
[1:24:51] happened
[1:24:52] i don't know the mechanics of the holy
[1:24:54] ghost but i know it fell on me
[1:24:56] i can't tell the mechanics of it but i
[1:24:58] know the blessings of it
[1:25:00] that's all i i don't know about is the
[1:25:02] blessing of the holy ghost and it's
[1:25:04] mechanics keywords so much is secret
[1:25:07] this boy cannot be healed because the
[1:25:09] disciples had power jesus gave down
[1:25:11] power to heal all manner of sickness to
[1:25:14] cast out devils the cleanse the lepers
[1:25:16] and to raise the dead
[1:25:19] he gave that power
[1:25:21] but they didn't have faith to operate
[1:25:23] the power that they had and then they
[1:25:25] questioned jesus and said well now why
[1:25:27] couldn't we do it now remember they had
[1:25:30] the word
[1:25:32] and the word was flesh then
[1:25:35] and the word told them i give you power
[1:25:38] heaven amen
[1:25:42] i give you power
[1:25:44] and they had the power
[1:25:46] but they didn't have faith to operate
[1:25:48] the word that was in that
[1:25:51] amen see what i mean yeah
[1:25:53] but
[1:25:54] jesus had it
[1:25:57] he was the word and he had faith that
[1:26:00] what he said would happen
[1:26:02] and man he said oh bring in here
[1:26:06] how long will the suffering
[1:26:09] he had faith with his power
[1:26:12] how did he
[1:26:14] he said i can do nothing in myself
[1:26:18] wow he relied upon
[1:26:22] what he was
[1:26:24] he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:26:26] word
[1:26:27] and he had faith in god
[1:26:30] who made him the word
[1:26:32] he was god the word
[1:26:34] and it was in him and that giving faith
[1:26:36] because he understood his position
[1:26:40] he knowed what he was because the
[1:26:42] scripture had said he was this
[1:26:45] and here the scripture tied in to prove
[1:26:47] that he was exactly what the scripture
[1:26:49] said he would be and he knew
[1:26:51] what he was
[1:26:53] therefore he relied upon what god had
[1:26:57] made him amen
[1:26:59] and if he did that
[1:27:01] then can't we rely on what god made us
[1:27:03] as believers
[1:27:05] these signs shall follow in that belief
[1:27:10] he had faith
[1:27:12] and what he was
[1:27:14] and if you are a believer you have faith
[1:27:16] in what you are you are a believer
[1:27:20] and if you've got faith in god the bible
[1:27:22] says over here you know if our uh
[1:27:26] if our hearts condemn us
[1:27:28] then we can have faith
[1:27:30] but if our hearts don't condemn us then
[1:27:32] we have faith right we have confidence
[1:27:34] towards god if you want to read that
[1:27:36] found saint john 3 21. i got the
[1:27:38] scripture written down there my moment
[1:27:42] then i mean first john 3 21. uh notice
[1:27:45] if our hearts condemn us not
[1:27:48] then we have confidence towards god but
[1:27:50] as long as you're doing things that's
[1:27:52] wrong you can't have confidence towards
[1:27:54] god
[1:27:55] so you see you can you automatically
[1:27:57] know that you're wrong you are not going
[1:28:00] to touch yourself like you're a sinner
[1:28:03] by knowing that you're wrong
[1:28:05] but when your heart don't condemn you
[1:28:07] and you know you are a believer and
[1:28:09] there's nothing between you and god you
[1:28:11] can ask what you will and know that it
[1:28:13] will be given
[1:28:14] because it's the word that's given to
[1:28:16] you just like it was to those disciples
[1:28:18] now the only thing you have to do then
[1:28:20] is have faith in what you are
[1:28:24] and have faith in what the word says you
[1:28:26] are
[1:28:27] and jesus had faith in the word of god
[1:28:30] that said what he was it is written of
[1:28:32] me
[1:28:33] didn't david and the psalms and the
[1:28:35] prophets and all of them speak of him i
[1:28:37] have the bread of life that come from
[1:28:39] god out of heaven
[1:28:40] amen i am the tree of life from the
[1:28:44] garden of eden
[1:28:45] i am all these things i am there i am
[1:28:49] and he knew that a perfect faith that he
[1:28:51] was the anointed messiah that the spirit
[1:28:54] of god was upon him
[1:28:56] he said now i myself do nothing but it's
[1:28:59] my faith in god
[1:29:01] and god presenting the word made
[1:29:03] manifest
[1:29:04] and when the word of god comes in you
[1:29:06] it's made manifest
[1:29:07] or you are a believer see and a believer
[1:29:11] is the faith of god that moves in you
[1:29:14] you like that
[1:29:15] i like when you all right
[1:29:17] before the how to what faith really is
[1:29:21] knowing who he wants
[1:29:23] without a shadow doubt he knew he was
[1:29:26] the son of god
[1:29:28] he knew it
[1:29:30] for the word
[1:29:32] identified
[1:29:33] the word of god identified who he was
[1:29:38] he said if i do not the worst of my
[1:29:39] father then don't believe me
[1:29:41] but if i don't do them works don't
[1:29:43] believe me but if i do then believe the
[1:29:45] worst
[1:29:46] for they are the manifested word prompt
[1:29:49] amen or if you just wake up to that a
[1:29:52] minute
[1:29:53] you see
[1:29:55] the word itself identify
[1:29:57] who you are
[1:29:59] and he said who can condemn this to you
[1:30:02] know what who can show me that my life
[1:30:05] and my words don't fulfill exactly what
[1:30:08] messiah should do
[1:30:11] nobody could say nothing
[1:30:13] for he was and he had faith to believe
[1:30:15] that whatever he said it would happen
[1:30:18] then he turned around and said the works
[1:30:19] that i do show you also a little while
[1:30:22] the world says no more yet you shall
[1:30:24] because i'll be with you even in you
[1:30:26] take those thought what you shall say
[1:30:28] for it's not you to speak it's that
[1:30:30] father that dwells in you he's one
[1:30:32] doesn't speaking it's not me it's the
[1:30:34] father the dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:30:37] word
[1:30:39] see what i mean
[1:30:40] now the identification
[1:30:42] of a scripture christian these words
[1:30:46] said jesus
[1:30:47] these signs shall follow them that
[1:30:50] belief
[1:30:51] now how can you call yourself a believer
[1:30:54] of people and deny
[1:30:56] those words
[1:30:57] how can you call yourself a believer and
[1:31:00] deny any of this woman
[1:31:02] amen you can't do it you're not a
[1:31:04] believer therefore signs can't follow
[1:31:07] because you just accept what you want to
[1:31:09] believe and let the rest of it you want
[1:31:11] don't believe it
[1:31:12] but you've got to take the whole thing
[1:31:14] and believe amen and when you truly
[1:31:16] believe not make believe but really
[1:31:17] believe then these signs follow them
[1:31:19] they believe
[1:31:21] oh
[1:31:21] could you compare christians today with
[1:31:23] them christians of long ago
[1:31:25] how their disciples walk in the power of
[1:31:27] the spirit moved by the holy ghost to go
[1:31:30] just a prisoner as i preached on the
[1:31:32] other night a prisoner to the word and
[1:31:33] will of god he couldn't even move until
[1:31:36] god moved him
[1:31:37] would you like to see a church rise like
[1:31:39] that
[1:31:41] it's going to be
[1:31:52] identifies
[1:31:53] himself what he was and the same word
[1:31:56] identifies us
[1:31:59] if a man loves me he keeps my
[1:32:02] commandments
[1:32:03] and if he says he loves me keeps not my
[1:32:05] commandments that's all of me
[1:32:07] he's alive amen the truth's not even
[1:32:09] anything
[1:32:10] you say well i don't believe well then
[1:32:12] that you're just not a believer that's
[1:32:13] all if the bible said so that makes it
[1:32:16] right amen
[1:32:19] what the bible says is the truth notice
[1:32:23] or he said to us if he abide me in my
[1:32:26] wording you think john 15
[1:32:28] you have you abide me see
[1:32:30] and faith in him
[1:32:32] give by me and my word abides in you
[1:32:36] then you
[1:32:37] ask what you will
[1:32:40] now see he knew who he was
[1:32:43] therefore he had faith
[1:32:45] faith could produce when he knows what
[1:32:46] he was now if he abides me and my word
[1:32:49] in you then you know who you are
[1:32:51] yeah amen
[1:32:53] that's what you will he'll be given to
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:56] wouldn't that be a wonderful night if
[1:32:57] everybody come in that prayer line and
[1:32:58] say i am a christian
[1:33:00] i have no condemnation
[1:33:02] i i know that my heart condemned or not
[1:33:05] something tells me that tonight's the
[1:33:07] end of my suffering
[1:33:09] you're going here with something no
[1:33:11] matter how much you come in emotion how
[1:33:13] much you do it won't work until that
[1:33:16] perfect faith has manifested and
[1:33:18] identified itself in you as the
[1:33:19] substance about when it's there then
[1:33:22] nothing's going to shake you from it
[1:33:23] if if you had cancer
[1:33:26] and the doctor told you yesterday that
[1:33:28] you'd be dead before monday morning all
[1:33:30] your heart your respiration is gone the
[1:33:32] cancers eat you up your bloodstream
[1:33:34] become completely cancer whatever it is
[1:33:36] and something comes with this substance
[1:33:39] of this genuine faith perfect faith was
[1:33:42] made of substance in you you're laughing
[1:33:43] at doctor's face
[1:33:45] you'd be like over eyes you when he
[1:33:46] walked up and down before the idols and
[1:33:48] said what you call a little louder maybe
[1:33:50] it's pursuing
[1:33:52] he knew what he was going to do because
[1:33:54] god had told him what was going to
[1:33:55] happen
[1:33:56] he said that's the god that answers the
[1:33:58] fire be god they say we'll take that
[1:34:00] proposition and they poured water upon
[1:34:03] the altars and they they've cut
[1:34:04] themselves they've done everything and
[1:34:06] called old bailout bail answers elijah
[1:34:08] is just as calm as he could be
[1:34:10] he said
[1:34:11] call aloud
[1:34:13] that said maybe he's pursuing maybe
[1:34:14] maybe on a basis maybe it's just
[1:34:16] something
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:28] lord god of abraham isaac and his israel
[1:34:31] never called him his name jacob
[1:34:33] scheister he called him israel prince
[1:34:36] with god
[1:34:37] lord god of abraham isaac and of that
[1:34:41] prince jacob

[1:34:44] servant and i've done this not in my
[1:34:47] desire not at my makeup but at your
[1:34:51] command i have did this
[1:34:53] your will you told me what to do
[1:34:56] you showed me these things to be here

[1:35:00] altar i've done all these things
[1:35:02] according to your commands i'll never be
[1:35:04] known and when he said that fire fell
[1:35:06] from the heavens amen he was just as
[1:35:09] confident as gonna fall because he had
[1:35:11] the substance
[1:35:12] why the word said so
[1:35:15] now this same bible is the same god's
[1:35:19] word
[1:35:20] and when you can receive the substance
[1:35:22] that's perfect faith substance that this
[1:35:25] promise that god made is yours
[1:35:29] how do you feel brother bryan when you

[1:35:32] different languages and things are you
[1:35:34] afraid no sir
[1:35:36] no sir he says
[1:35:39] i've never been afraid yet because he
[1:35:41] told me
[1:35:43] and i believe that it's true amen
[1:35:46] if he told me tonight to go to the
[1:35:48] presidential graveyard and raise up
[1:35:49] george washington tomorrow morning i'll
[1:35:51] invite the whole world come see it done
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:09] that day brother ran there dead
[1:36:11] been laying there for a half hour mashed
[1:36:13] up blood running out of eyes nose and
[1:36:15] ears his little legs broke up and his
[1:36:18] little stopping
[1:36:19] his feet out to the end of the stockings
[1:36:21] his shoes gone
[1:36:23] i written i thought that ought to be
[1:36:24] that boy
[1:36:26] i said hey let's look in the back of
[1:36:28] that bible brother lord we got brother
[1:36:30] lindsay when we look back there and it
[1:36:31] shall come surpass saith the lord
[1:36:34] oh my
[1:36:36] there will be a land worth a lot of
[1:36:38] evergreen growing rocks will be left
[1:36:40] together a little boy with a crock hair
[1:36:43] cut little panty waist buttons up here
[1:36:46] and his feet your stock is pulled up
[1:36:48] high you'll have brown eyes they'll be
[1:36:50] turned back you'll be killed in an
[1:36:51] automobile accident but you lay your
[1:36:54] hands up on him and he'll come back to
[1:36:55] life
[1:36:56] that was right on there daily
[1:37:01] just waiting the word
[1:37:04] i said this boy isn't alive in a couple
[1:37:05] of minutes now that i'm a false prophet
[1:37:07] run me out of finland but if he israel
[1:37:10] hold on your faces and repent amen
[1:37:13] i said death you can't hold him i'm
[1:37:15] calling for his hand according to the
[1:37:17] word of god in the name of jesus christ
[1:37:22] oh god faith took a hold god said so
[1:37:26] there it is
[1:37:27] now that's that's god speaking in this
[1:37:30] day through vision
[1:37:32] yeah but this if that vision was
[1:37:35] contrary to this that would be wrong
[1:37:38] this is more than division
[1:37:40] if any vision is contrary to the word
[1:37:42] leave it alone
[1:37:44] of god god don't contradict his own word
[1:37:46] so if this word tells you something and
[1:37:48] you can have the same confidence then
[1:37:50] what's gonna happen
[1:37:51] there's nothing
[1:37:53] if it says they shall lay hands upon the
[1:37:55] sick and they shall recover a brother if
[1:37:58] faith that perfect faith got a hold of
[1:38:00] that you when you pass by this prayer
[1:38:02] line you'll be jumping and shouting when
[1:38:04] you're left here it's over
[1:38:05] and it's over it's all over it's
[1:38:07] finished
[1:38:08] if you had a request in your heart
[1:38:10] believe that when that prayer was made
[1:38:12] for that it was going to be answered
[1:38:13] there isn't nothing is that's what's
[1:38:15] going to happen
[1:38:16] like the woman with the blood issue
[1:38:19] jesus had perfect faith he had it and he
[1:38:22] come because he was the word and you
[1:38:24] become the word
[1:38:26] you become the word as you receive the
[1:38:28] word if in my words and you
[1:38:31] my words which this word abides in you
[1:38:33] then ask what you will it'll be done for
[1:38:34] you
[1:38:35] see if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:38:38] and don't doubt but believe that what
[1:38:39] you've said
[1:38:40] then you shall have what you said when
[1:38:42] you pray believe that you receive what
[1:38:44] you ask for and you shall have it it
[1:38:46] will be given to you
[1:38:47] time space nothing else will ever change
[1:38:50] if you know what's done
[1:38:51] it's already it's already over it now
[1:38:53] what
[1:38:55] now and he said to us if you guide me in
[1:38:58] my word and you think john here you can
[1:39:00] ask what you will they'll be done
[1:39:02] then
[1:39:03] recognize
[1:39:04] your position in the scripture as a
[1:39:07] believer
[1:39:08] see
[1:39:09] you've got to recognize your position as
[1:39:11] he recognized his position
[1:39:15] is not it written that christ shall come
[1:39:18] and what all christ would do he said to
[1:39:20] the obese and then that morning isn't it
[1:39:22] written in the scriptures that they'll
[1:39:24] have to
[1:39:25] that
[1:39:26] he must suffer and then be killed and
[1:39:29] raised the third day he said why are you
[1:39:31] so slow of understanding
[1:39:34] they thought my this man speaks a little
[1:39:35] differently mother man come to find out
[1:39:38] when they got into the end it was him
[1:39:40] neither her eyes was withholding from
[1:39:42] him see they know that he kept laying to
[1:39:44] that scripture and they know it was him
[1:39:47] now you must believe what you asked for
[1:39:50] if you are a believer recognize yourself
[1:39:52] as a believer recognize that these
[1:39:54] things are for you if there's
[1:39:55] condensation in your life straighten
[1:39:56] that first amendment amen see if you've
[1:39:59] got condemnation you're uh or you might
[1:40:01] have oral robertson
[1:40:03] and a dozen more people who have faith
[1:40:05] to come here and pray over you and jump
[1:40:07] up and down and pull on you by the
[1:40:09] gallons it you know it won't move
[1:40:12] i'm not trying
[1:40:14] what falls off from aurora's meetings
[1:40:16] then i'll catch him in the prayer line
[1:40:18] you're here to say he was prayed for
[1:40:20] before a man with dark hair kind of big
[1:40:23] fella big jaws
[1:40:25] or roberts
[1:40:26] and that was at a certain city called
[1:40:28] certain certainty yes that's right see
[1:40:31] he was prayed for by such and such a man
[1:40:33] see that again but your years your
[1:40:35] troubles
[1:40:36] go make that thing right
[1:40:40] go out there and confess that sin to
[1:40:42] your husband to your wife don't do this
[1:40:45] thing
[1:40:46] it'll never do you any good no matter
[1:40:47] who you're praying for so they make that
[1:40:49] right
[1:40:50] condemnations in your heart and god will
[1:40:52] not come into that heart condemn
[1:40:55] god don't dwell in that you've got to
[1:40:57] make it right then when you do you must
[1:40:59] have faith if everything's right you
[1:41:01] must have faith and believe it don't be
[1:41:04] afraid
[1:41:05] in the book of job that said here job
[1:41:08] fear
[1:41:09] and what he feared it actually happened
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:13] what brought it is fear
[1:41:16] that's what made it happen his faith
[1:41:19] would have kept him from us
[1:41:20] but his fear brought him brother to him
[1:41:23] he was scared it was going to happen and
[1:41:25] it did happen
[1:41:27] now if he knows it wouldn't happen it
[1:41:28] wouldn't happen
[1:41:30] you know what i mean if you're afraid
[1:41:32] when you come to the prayer line maybe i
[1:41:34] just haven't got the faith sufficient
[1:41:35] it'll never happen don't worry
[1:41:38] but if you know what's going to happen
[1:41:39] it'll happen
[1:41:41] see it's a substance or something job
[1:41:43] had a fear that these things have come
[1:41:45] up on him and they did
[1:41:46] if you have a fear that your disease is
[1:41:48] going to leave you or won't leave it it
[1:41:50] won't if you have a faith that it will
[1:41:52] you ask any medical doctor the first
[1:41:55] thing he'll try to get you to do is have
[1:41:56] confidence in the medicine he's given
[1:41:59] if you haven't got no confidence in it
[1:42:01] you better leave it alone right
[1:42:04] sure
[1:42:05] what is it that's it's faith it doesn't
[1:42:07] heal amen
[1:42:09] his faith
[1:42:10] all the time
[1:42:11] peter
[1:42:12] he was doing all right so he got scared
[1:42:16] the word told him he could walk on the
[1:42:17] water
[1:42:19] he's scared first his daughter was a
[1:42:20] ghost
[1:42:22] and he said lord if it did you bit me
[1:42:24] comfy on the water he said come on no
[1:42:27] that's just the same as james 5 14. then
[1:42:30] in march 16th the same god said
[1:42:33] to come on
[1:42:34] and so it started walking down all right
[1:42:37] got in and out of the ship started
[1:42:38] walking off there's a storm on you know
[1:42:40] great white cap waves bigger
[1:42:42] these hills around here a foam breaking
[1:42:45] on top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet
[1:42:47] foam white caps breaking that was a
[1:42:50] terrific thing for him to ask if it be
[1:42:52] you large see it looks like a they look
[1:42:54] like a shadow or a spirit
[1:42:56] he said if it's you fit me come to me on
[1:42:58] the water jesus said come on
[1:43:01] and he stepped down since the lord i
[1:43:03] just want but when he got his eyes on
[1:43:05] the wave
[1:43:06] he got scared
[1:43:07] what time in his mind first thing
[1:43:10] he was going to walk because the word
[1:43:12] said for me to walk
[1:43:14] and the next thing he looked at is um
[1:43:16] well he looked at his symptoms
[1:43:19] looked out there and seen how big that
[1:43:21] way he was and he got scared and when he
[1:43:23] did down he went
[1:43:26] see
[1:43:26] why do you fear it happened
[1:43:28] why do you believe him
[1:43:30] when he believed he could walk you off
[1:43:32] when he believed got scared in his
[1:43:34] belief then his substance left him
[1:43:37] see
[1:43:38] he still professed his face but he
[1:43:40] didn't have the substance
[1:43:43] right on top of that white captain what
[1:43:44] do i don't tell you
[1:43:46] if he had this perfect face
[1:43:48] anybody didn't have it
[1:43:50] he thought he did he did it first he's
[1:43:52] willing to venture right out why the
[1:43:54] lord told me to do it it's got to happen
[1:43:56] so he just stepped right down the board
[1:43:58] they saw him yeah man
[1:44:00] he never thought about the the
[1:44:02] the ways how contrary there was he never
[1:44:05] got that in his mind
[1:44:06] and when you get to thinking well now
[1:44:08] wait you know i've been sick so long
[1:44:11] stop you're just not going to go back to
[1:44:12] the vote
[1:44:15] but when you quit thinking about that
[1:44:18] abraham considered is not his own body
[1:44:21] nowadays
[1:44:23] neither the dead is the stanford
[1:44:26] he didn't think about that he didn't
[1:44:27] consider it
[1:44:28] it wasn't even brought into
[1:44:30] understanding he didn't even consider it
[1:44:32] all
[1:44:33] he just considered what god said
[1:44:35] and he went on
[1:44:37] as long as peter did that he was
[1:44:39] but jesus lived in a world
[1:44:42] that no one knowed about
[1:44:44] he was an odd person
[1:44:47] he lives in a world of perfect faith in
[1:44:50] the perfect god in which you are
[1:44:52] if we live in a perfect faith of a
[1:44:56] christian what we are
[1:44:57] we're very mystic to the world
[1:45:00] yeah
[1:45:00] the people wouldn't understand you just
[1:45:02] walk in the spirit
[1:45:04] what the spirit said you would do
[1:45:06] what it forbid you not do
[1:45:08] then the people get to say
[1:45:10] there will be a mystic person to them
[1:45:15] that's the way it is all believers there
[1:45:17] are mystics that people don't understand
[1:45:19] because they live in a world to
[1:45:21] themselves
[1:45:22] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:45:24] could touch
[1:45:25] the disciples couldn't understand when
[1:45:27] he spoke to them they say this and they
[1:45:29] say well
[1:45:30] if you talk and riddles
[1:45:32] we don't understand this how can this be
[1:45:34] see it wasn't in the world that he lived
[1:45:37] in
[1:45:38] they couldn't understand it nobody could
[1:45:40] understand him and
[1:45:42] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:45:45] by faith on each substance base he is
[1:45:49] isolated from the entire world and
[1:45:51] becomes a new creature in christ
[1:45:54] there now you're getting into bride
[1:45:56] material
[1:45:58] hey
[1:45:59] you're getting into raption condition
[1:46:01] now
[1:46:02] that means for each one of us americans
[1:46:05] not just the pastors
[1:46:07] deacons trustees that means for the
[1:46:08] laity every individual walks in a world
[1:46:13] god alone
[1:46:14] your baptized into this kingdom
[1:46:17] and there's nobody in there but you and
[1:46:19] god
[1:46:20] he gives the orders and you pack them
[1:46:22] out
[1:46:23] whatever he says is not a shadow of
[1:46:24] doubt nowhere you walk right on the lord
[1:46:27] says this there's nobody in the world
[1:46:29] can talk you out of it you say hold on
[1:46:31] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:46:35] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[1:46:38] faith never failed
[1:46:40] yes
[1:46:42] he was a mystic to them
[1:46:44] with his perfect faith and so is it now
[1:46:46] with those who have perfect faith are
[1:46:48] mystic to others
[1:46:50] we are taught
[1:46:51] to resist the devil and he will flee
[1:46:53] from
[1:46:55] now to resist just just simply turn down
[1:47:00] just resisting that is just walk away
[1:47:02] from him
[1:47:03] god said a certain thing no matter what
[1:47:04] he's trying to tell you you don't even
[1:47:06] listen to him
[1:47:07] yeah your ears are against anything else
[1:47:09] but what the spirits say
[1:47:11] he that has an ear that listens
[1:47:14] see what the spirit says unto the
[1:47:16] churches the ones got the listening post
[1:47:18] that catches what the spirit says to the
[1:47:20] churches see what satan says well now
[1:47:23] this camp that don't have nothing well
[1:47:24] if you teach that the denomination
[1:47:26] that's going to have nothing to do with
[1:47:27] it it goes right on just a thing
[1:47:29] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:47:32] spirit says to the churches
[1:47:35] you know when the bible's always
[1:47:36] confronting us to him that has faith
[1:47:39] that he that has an ear to hear let him
[1:47:41] hear
[1:47:43] he that has with the lady counselor
[1:47:45] numbers of the beast all these different
[1:47:47] things he that
[1:47:49] let him tell it to the rest of them that
[1:47:51] they might have
[1:47:52] and that's about faith we're talking
[1:47:54] about now faith that you've got to have
[1:47:56] that perfect faith
[1:47:58] that faith that says yes
[1:48:01] there's nothing to say no
[1:48:03] when god says yes
[1:48:04] see but he says yes yes yes
[1:48:07] nothing else can ever take it from me
[1:48:09] with his perfect faith he was very
[1:48:11] strange and the devil didn't stay around
[1:48:14] him very long we got it lester this
[1:48:16] morning when he come with that great big
[1:48:19] a fluffle of intellectual conception he
[1:48:22] fluffled up against jesus said when he
[1:48:24] kindly found out he hit a ten thousand
[1:48:26] vote wine
[1:48:27] and brought him right back again
[1:48:29] yes sir he said it is written man shall
[1:48:32] not live by bread alone
[1:48:35] you are shocked
[1:48:36] become a little softer the next time one
[1:48:38] said are you a great man you
[1:48:40] yourself up here to be somebody to get
[1:48:42] behind me
[1:48:43] oh my what he meant now shall not tempt
[1:48:46] the lord thy god
[1:48:48] see he proved himself on to satan that
[1:48:52] he was the lord god amen or it is
[1:48:55] written thou shall not tempt now if
[1:48:57] satan didn't know that that was the lord
[1:48:59] god he said wait a minute you're not
[1:49:00] that person but he knows better than to
[1:49:02] the benefit
[1:49:03] do you know what ground to stand on
[1:49:06] he says thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:49:08] thy god
[1:49:09] and that's who he was amen and satan
[1:49:11] knows better than to say that because
[1:49:13] jesus works and already proved that he
[1:49:15] was
[1:49:16] the lord thy god notice
[1:49:18] now
[1:49:19] another
[1:49:21] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:49:23] circumstances
[1:49:25] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:49:28] no matter what it is
[1:49:30] it masters it
[1:49:32] and i just watch when you believe
[1:49:34] anything do anything and you've got
[1:49:36] faith in what you're doing no matter
[1:49:37] what the circumstances that don't have
[1:49:39] one thing to do with it
[1:49:41] it masters that circumstance
[1:49:43] if it's in a room of sickness
[1:49:46] and a large reveal that this certain
[1:49:47] thing is going to happen you just speak
[1:49:49] it and belong
[1:49:50] oh it does that just don't ask any
[1:49:52] questions it's already over just keep
[1:49:54] going
[1:49:55] it masters all circumstances amen well
[1:49:57] if you do this uh sword sword sort of
[1:50:00] that thing that already got it mastered
[1:50:03] faith please that god will work it out i
[1:50:04] don't know how to do it but to do it
[1:50:06] anyhow
[1:50:07] it masters all circumstances and faith
[1:50:10] and love is relation
[1:50:13] because you can't have faith unless
[1:50:15] you've got love because your faith is in
[1:50:18] a god who is the very essence of love
[1:50:21] yeah
[1:50:21] faith and love works together you're
[1:50:24] just like a young couple you take a
[1:50:26] young man young woman and they fall in
[1:50:29] love with one another and as they go
[1:50:31] along and begin to know one another more
[1:50:33] their hearts just begin to beat is one
[1:50:35] see they're
[1:50:37] yet they're not husband wife but their
[1:50:39] love binds them together and they have
[1:50:41] confidence in one another
[1:50:42] now if they really love one another
[1:50:44] really love
[1:50:46] and you know that this girl loves you
[1:50:49] and
[1:50:50] and she knows that you love her you've
[1:50:52] got confidence faith in one another
[1:50:55] right
[1:50:55] you got faith in one if you didn't you
[1:50:58] better not marry me
[1:51:00] notice you gotta have faith and you
[1:51:01] separate them about one extreme south
[1:51:04] one extreme north they still that love
[1:51:06] beachbody no matter where they're at
[1:51:08] they're just as true to one another as
[1:51:09] they can be because they love one
[1:51:12] another
[1:51:13] and if you love the law
[1:51:15] it's not trying to dodge hell
[1:51:18] but you love the law
[1:51:20] then you have faith in god
[1:51:23] if you love him
[1:51:25] like a a young girl just happened here
[1:51:27] in louisville not all
[1:51:29] a woman
[1:51:30] she was uh she's been a christian for
[1:51:32] many years but her husband had just fell
[1:51:34] in love she fell over this man he had
[1:51:37] been a christian a couple years
[1:51:38] and so they got married they loved and
[1:51:41] had confidence in one another and they
[1:51:43] got married and so the woman said to the
[1:51:46] man says hubby
[1:51:48] it must be hard on you you're just a
[1:51:50] young christian you've had so much to go
[1:51:51] through with drinking what it was said
[1:51:53] you've had so much to go through with
[1:51:54] and said i know you're about to be
[1:51:56] tempted awfully hard and said i want you
[1:51:59] to know one thing now
[1:52:00] now if you happen to fall if you happen
[1:52:03] to to fall into temptation and as
[1:52:06] overcome don't stay away from home
[1:52:08] you come on back you come right here
[1:52:10] because i'm gonna be right here waiting
[1:52:12] for you
[1:52:13] and i'm gonna help you praise you again
[1:52:15] until you get victory i'm going to stay

[1:52:20] married you
[1:52:22] because i loved you
[1:52:25] no matter what you are i still love you
[1:52:28] you know after that he was eating his
[1:52:30] lunch with the fellows down in the
[1:52:31] boring room he was telling them about so
[1:52:33] now how could a man ever do anything
[1:52:35] wrong when somebody knows you like me
[1:52:37] there you are how how could you trespass
[1:52:40] that confidence
[1:52:42] and when we were sinners
[1:52:45] alienated without god in the world and
[1:52:48] that muck of mothers have talked about
[1:52:50] this morning

[1:52:55] god sought you you never saw god
[1:52:59] no man can come to me except the father
[1:53:00] draws you first
[1:53:02] and god came down in that luck what you
[1:53:05] were
[1:53:07] and sought you out
[1:53:09] and brought you out
[1:53:12] about the creator of perfect love
[1:53:16] look what you are
[1:53:18] and look what you are
[1:53:20] what did that

[1:53:43] loved you when he was unlovable but he
[1:53:45] changed you yeah it's like the colored
[1:53:47] sister said that time in her testimony
[1:53:49] she said i'm not what i ought to be
[1:53:53] and i'm not what i want to be and then
[1:53:56] i'm not what i used to be she knows
[1:53:58] she'd come somewhere
[1:54:00] something happened
[1:54:01] and
[1:54:02] that's the way it is
[1:54:04] if god when i was an alien from him so
[1:54:07] well because he stood down to get me and
[1:54:09] pick me up that gives me confidence that
[1:54:12] he wants to use me
[1:54:14] he's got a purpose in doing it
[1:54:17] he's seen something in me
[1:54:19] he sees something in you he had a reason
[1:54:22] to save you look at the people don't
[1:54:24] save today

[1:56:34] when satan tempts us
[1:56:35] we are
[1:56:37] to resist him in a perfect faith in a
[1:56:40] perfect word like jesus did the word of
[1:56:42] god is perfect we'll have perfect faith
[1:56:45] in this perfect word and resist faith i
[1:56:47] will hurry just as quickly as you can
[1:56:49] but
[1:56:50] his faith
[1:56:52] is in his word
[1:56:55] conquer
[1:56:56] we can conquer anything both death
[1:56:59] health and the grace we know that god is
[1:57:02] god that perfect faith in god's perfect
[1:57:05] word he conquered everything that he
[1:57:07] come in contact with
[1:57:09] death cannot even stand in his presence
[1:57:12] sickness cannot stand in his presence
[1:57:14] flowing from him is like rivers of
[1:57:16] virtue going out constantly
[1:57:18] virtue going from his garments these
[1:57:20] people laid in his shadow step put their
[1:57:22] finger on his garments on the tv
[1:57:24] when that woman down there then
[1:57:26] everybody wanted to touch his garment
[1:57:27] because they seen that there was virtue
[1:57:30] going from the conflict though like
[1:57:32] rivers
[1:57:33] there he was walking walking in a world
[1:57:36] with a perfect face faith
[1:57:37] because he was the word
[1:57:40] and now if he abides me through him he
[1:57:43] brought the word to you
[1:57:45] and my words abide in you then walk in
[1:57:47] the same kind of way
[1:57:49] virtues flowing from him the rivers of
[1:57:52] god's fountains of blessings destroying
[1:57:54] out to the people see what i mean
[1:57:56] and you're not bluffing it you're not
[1:57:59] imagining it it's actually taking place
[1:58:02] and you see it
[1:58:03] if you just imagine that don't do any
[1:58:05] good but if it's really there it really
[1:58:07] happened now notice see by
[1:58:10] when he stood and he said if you destroy
[1:58:12] this body this temple
[1:58:14] i'll raise it up again in three days
[1:58:17] why he was just as satisfied he'd do
[1:58:20] that because the scripture said that he
[1:58:23] won't do it the messiah i'll not leave
[1:58:26] his soul in hell now i suffered my holy
[1:58:28] one to see corruption
[1:58:29] a prophet
[1:58:30] who the word comes to has said that
[1:58:33] would happen and he knows he was that
[1:58:35] person yeah
[1:58:37] and when though jesus himself
[1:58:40] said the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:58:42] sick
[1:58:43] or they shall lay hands over sick and
[1:58:44] they shall recover
[1:58:46] if he would have the same perfect
[1:58:49] confidence
[1:58:50] that my hands are they know me i shall
[1:58:53] recover
[1:58:54] ever because he said so he said you
[1:58:57] destroy this body
[1:58:58] and i'll raise it up because he know he
[1:59:00] was messiah i'm not suffering my holy
[1:59:03] one to see corruption he knew that he
[1:59:04] was the only one
[1:59:06] neither only he saw in hell he hit him
[1:59:08] he knowed he'd do it
[1:59:11] he had confidence
[1:59:13] that he was that uncomfortable death in
[1:59:15] hell
[1:59:17] said destroy it if you wish to
[1:59:19] i'll raise it back again in three days
[1:59:21] oh my i have power to lay my life down
[1:59:24] or i have power to take it up again
[1:59:27] he knows who he was
[1:59:29] you're a christian you have rights to
[1:59:31] any redemptive blessing that jesus died
[1:59:33] for you
[1:59:34] it's all yours it's already paid for
[1:59:37] you just have to believe it
[1:59:38] not imagine it but believe it
[1:59:41] and know that it's yours and you can be
[1:59:43] deceptive oh that's a conquering faith
[1:59:46] no
[1:59:47] uh
[1:59:49] do you do it what happened before he
[1:59:52] could predict that it would happen
[1:59:54] because he knowed it would happen and
[1:59:55] whatever he predicted come to pass now
[1:59:58] watch
[1:59:58] whatever he says god honored what he
[2:00:01] said
[2:00:03] think of that
[2:00:04] whatever jesus said god brought it to
[2:00:07] pass
[2:00:09] so you know his words were god's word
[2:00:12] now look that same scripture comes right
[2:00:15] back into us again if he stayed to this
[2:00:19] mountain
[2:00:23] oh my
[2:00:24] i just let that focus on the list
[2:00:26] because we're going to have a prayer
[2:00:29] but this missed the congregation to pray
[2:00:30] for this thing
[2:00:32] the ones that want to have to go look
[2:00:36] he knew
[2:00:38] that he pleased god he knew that there
[2:00:41] was nothing on his life god had already
[2:00:43] testified this is my beloved son in whom
[2:00:45] i'm well pleased you're him
[2:00:50] this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased
[2:00:52] to dwell in at the day of his baptism
[2:00:54] i'm pleased to make my abode in here
[2:00:57] there's no condemnation to him at all
[2:00:59] now when the same god comes to you
[2:01:02] as pleased to dwell in you please to
[2:01:04] honor your word what your decision is
[2:01:07] what was joshua's decision stand still
[2:01:10] son and it stood there amen
[2:01:13] amen
[2:01:14] sure
[2:01:15] what was moses decision how did he stick
[2:01:18] over the river like that and call for
[2:01:20] its opening open see whatever you ask
[2:01:23] and if you stay to this mountain be
[2:01:25] moved and don't doubt
[2:01:27] see in your heart but believe that what
[2:01:29] you've said will come to pass you can
[2:01:31] have what you say
[2:01:34] that put you back in the word
[2:01:36] now that's not skim milk
[2:01:40] it puts you back i know it's going to
[2:01:42] jump shot over top of you
[2:01:44] because you can't answer
[2:01:46] but real genuine face catches that right
[2:01:49] now
[2:01:50] i've seen it friends there's this bible
[2:01:52] laying open before me i've seen it
[2:01:54] happen
[2:01:55] and i know it's the truth
[2:01:58] i know god in heaven or that i might not
[2:02:00] live through to finish this message
[2:02:02] but i know that it happened i've seen it
[2:02:05] myself i'm a witness of that word being
[2:02:08] fulfilled and i know it is the truth
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:12] stand
[2:02:12] and stand there and see the creator
[2:02:15] bring a living creature into existence
[2:02:17] right in presence of your eyes
[2:02:20] you shake your head in one and then look
[2:02:22] around and see him bring another one
[2:02:24] just exactly like it
[2:02:26] because you said so
[2:02:28] and turn over here
[2:02:30] and say there will be another one there
[2:02:31] and look and there it is
[2:02:33] yeah
[2:02:35] now that's the truth
[2:02:39] oh
[2:02:40] where should we be
[2:02:43] there's perfect faith
[2:02:47] no vision
[2:02:49] just speak the word
[2:02:52] never saw the squirrels
[2:02:54] he just said
[2:02:56] the scripture what it was
[2:02:58] and speaking
[2:03:00] and don't doubt it
[2:03:02] but what you say it will be there
[2:03:06] and uh took god at his word and it was
[2:03:09] bad
[2:03:11] am i right
[2:03:12] that's just as powerful as friends as
[2:03:15] your pastor
[2:03:16] that's just as powerful as it was when
[2:03:18] joshua stopped the sun amen because the
[2:03:21] sun was already there the elements was
[2:03:23] moving and he stopped the movement but
[2:03:25] then he brought something there
[2:03:41] after i've been planted in the grain
[2:03:43] oh my god
[2:03:45] there it is my faith looks up to thee
[2:03:48] thou lamb of calvary amen
[2:03:50] if you say and don't doubt but believe
[2:03:52] that what you said you shall have what
[2:03:54] you said he
[2:03:57] believed as it happened
[2:03:59] david in the psalm spoke of him
[2:04:02] and with it
[2:04:04] he took his power and he ministered to
[2:04:07] others not only did he keep it to
[2:04:09] himself but he ministered to others by
[2:04:12] also
[2:04:13] saved others even to the uttermost and
[2:04:16] he can do the same thing now and promise
[2:04:18] the same faith to the believers in his
[2:04:22] word in john
[2:04:24] john 14 12. he said so mark 16 and also
[2:04:28] in mark 11 23 we just read now why
[2:04:31] now
[2:04:32] he
[2:04:33] has
[2:04:34] appeared to us in the same form that he
[2:04:38] did to them in the old testament
[2:04:41] and in the same as it is in the new
[2:04:43] testament
[2:04:45] and assured by the same word the same
[2:04:48] christ
[2:04:50] and i declare to you that christ is the
[2:04:53] holy ghost
[2:04:55] the word christ means the anointed one
[2:04:59] just the person that's anointed that is
[2:05:02] the crown
[2:05:03] the anointed one how many knows that's
[2:05:06] true that's good
[2:05:07] the anointing one there would be a man
[2:05:09] that would be anointed
[2:05:11] anointed with what the bible said in
[2:05:14] acts 2 that jesus of nazareth a man
[2:05:16] approved of god anointed with the holy
[2:05:19] ghost went about us and done great works
[2:05:21] tonight
[2:05:22] and god manifested through that he was
[2:05:26] in this man
[2:05:27] and now we become anointed
[2:05:31] with that same spirit
[2:05:34] anointed
[2:05:35] messiah
[2:05:37] messiahs of the last days
[2:05:40] to shine forth the resurrection of jesus
[2:05:43] christ
[2:05:44] to show that he is not dead
[2:05:47] but in the form of the holy ghost he's
[2:05:49] in his people
[2:05:51] moving among his bride
[2:05:54] with a love affair to her
[2:05:56] pouring out into her himself they are
[2:05:59] becoming one already
[2:06:03] and the same sign
[2:06:05] promised by the same god in the same
[2:06:08] word is making this same manifestation
[2:06:13] there's nothing left for us to do but
[2:06:15] believe it
[2:06:16] i believe it is a substance amen and
[2:06:18] that creates a perfect faith amen just
[2:06:21] think how how numb we are
[2:06:24] just think of that just a minute
[2:06:26] now let's see has he done all things
[2:06:29] well has he ever told us anything about
[2:06:32] what happened just exactly the way he
[2:06:34] said
[2:06:35] hasn't he performed and has a great
[2:06:38] pillar of fire been among us and done
[2:06:40] just exactly like he promised to do
[2:06:43] haven't we seen it have side statement
[2:06:45] haven't been predicted what would happen
[2:06:47] go right there and have it even in the
[2:06:49] papers and magazines pack it right back
[2:06:51] and show it once told you months before
[2:06:52] it happens
[2:06:54] has it done just exactly the way he did
[2:06:56] in the old testament in the new
[2:06:57] testament
[2:06:58] just exactly the same one amen
[2:07:01] the same holy spirit comes as desire and
[2:07:05] the word of god which is quicker and
[2:07:07] sharper than a two-day sword a discerner
[2:07:09] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:07:12] isn't that right
[2:07:13] is that the same god how about singing
[2:07:16] wrong it's not a stranger off somewhere
[2:07:18] else each year
