your word once again Lord as we dig in deep tonight Lord I pray that you would help us to understand Lord to have Clarity of Mind of who you are and what you're doing Lord that we could see ourselves in your word Lord to not just place it on somebody else or even on you Lord but that we could find our place in your word and that we could rest our souls on it Lord and let it draw us up and turn us into Lord creatures of Eternity out of this time that we live in Lord I pray for your grace now Lord settle us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you will to John chapter 14 John chapter 14 14 amen God bless you good to see sister Jean again amen good to see you amen John chapter 14 this is the opening scripture that we had from last service and and we'll be here for a little bit uh certainly this is Jesus up at the Last Supper and he's talking to the disciples and he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also so at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing this series on the Holy Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost and I want to take another uh service on this thought of the indwelling god and I found myself at an impass this week as I was studying because I was moving further and further and we want to understand how God can live with us and live in us and we want to understand who he is and all of these different things and I'd intentionally kind of steered away from godhead because it is a it's a deep topic it's a heavy topic and and I didn't just was trying to kind of ease through it but I found myself at a place here where I couldn't and so we've got to go into godhead and I want to start that tonight and just help us set a foundation for next service or three perhaps as the Lord would lead uh to get us on this understanding because if we can't understand who God is and who the holy spirit is and what it was and what it's doing and these different things then we'll kind of get our part mixed up and we don't see ourselves even how we can be in Christ and Christ be in us as he was talking about in our opening scripture amen but Christ is our example of how we're supposed to be unified with God if we want to understand how we are supposed to be as Believers then we ought to be able to look at Christ and see that and and and Christ was expressing this to his disciples and expressing to to them how that it was supposed to work and he says at that day he says when you come into this Oneness that I'm talking about he says at that day you shall know not by knowledge not by theology but you'll know by experience it'll be a reality in your life that I am in my father and you are in me and I'm in you it's going to be a personal experience he's talking about because he's talking to them and we think that well by Revelation by by theology maybe they would know but they had no clue what he was talking about but he says there's coming a day and it was on the day of Pentecost he says when you'll understand how this works you'll understand how God can be in me how I can be in him and how you can be in me and yet I can be in you and how this Works in unity and if we jump ahead even in that that that book of John to to John 17 and now he's in the Garden of Gethsemane and he's praying and he says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth he says neither pray I for these alone so he's not just praying for his disciples he says but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so everyone that's going to be converted after by the disciples by the Gospel of Jesus Christ he he says what I'm talking about here is for every single one of them it's not just for the disciples it's not just for that day it's not just for the the first church age under Paul and these different things amen but everything that he's talking about is for the ages to come as well and every single believer that's coming after this and what is coming after he says that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou has sent me now the world believes in a trinity and here we have a trinity and it's father son and us but there's supposed to be a holy ghost fitted in there somewhere as well and so Jesus is praying here and he's saying I want them Lord I'm praying that they will be the same as you and I are so the Oneness that Christ had with god with Christ had with the father is the same thing that we're supposed to have with both of them both of them not just one of them both of them it's supposed to be the same thing so this Oneness is described as God in Christ and yet Christ is in God and that sounds like a paradox it sounds like a physical impossibility how can you be in somebody and yet they be in you you'd have to fold yourself in up inside out but basically be the only way to do it but Christ is saying the Believers coming after me they have to be exactly as we are I'm in them and they're in me and I'm in you and you're in me and then now he continues and he says the glory which thou gavest me have I given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect and one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me and has loved me them as thou Hast loved me now Jesus is clarifying he says now I'm going to be in them and you'll be in me and they'll be perfectly in Oneness like we are and he says father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am in other words there's now a restoration there's a Redemption coming that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me he says for thou lovest me when when I was born in a manger no he says Thou lovest me before the foundation of the world so that kind of talk leaves people scratching their heads really and it's a tough scripture for the Trinity because you have to do a bunch of mental gymnastics and I'm pretty sure you have to break a bunch of scriptural laws to make all these things fit one inside the other and be three separate and yet three one and one and the other and then simultaneously outside of it it's very difficult to make that happen because if you have two separate persons and you put one inside the other then how does the one that's inside the other suddenly become the one that's outside of the other it's very difficult to do those things but as we start to go through this tonight I did want to publicly thank brother Jason dears for this because his his help in my study and he's helped me many times through the years because he's very exhaustive when he goes into something and he digs into the depths of the scripture to really bring the truth of it and so much of what I have here tonight comes directly from him uh certainly in part and his study and his research and he quotes the Trinity and I've got to be able to present the Trinity to you so that you can understand what we really believe because so often I even with believers they don't understand how we differ from the Trinity so this is the the the generally accepted phrase of the Trinity it says the doctrine of the Trinity means that there is one God who eternally exists as three distinct persons he says the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit stated differently God is one in essence and three in person so that means god is one in in his attributes and nature but he is three in persons he says these definitions Express three crucial truths the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct persons so as soon as you get a person you have a personality you have a will you have a nature you have a mind then it says each person is fully God and then he says there is only one God so you have three persons that are each fully God and then they say that there is only one God now that to me makes no sense whatsoever you can't have three fully God people and then say there is one God you can say that they agree in one but you can't say they are one because they they say they are three distinct persons they put their them in three distinct bodies they can be three different places all these different things and so what you have here is what they call a social Trinity meaning three persons in total agreement with one another and and there's there was a a theologian by the name of lamp he was an Anglican priest he wrote a book called God is Spirit he says the Trinity as a Unity of human persons in a social the Trinity as a Unity of human persons in a social Trinity in which three persons in the full iological sense of persons are bound together in mutual love so they have three different minds but they're Bound by mutual love it said it implies the existence of three Divine Consciousness consciousnesses three mindsets three Minds three persons he says in other words three Gods Gods plural three separate Gods amen they are all claim to be fully God so we believe and they believe that God is omnipotent all powerful and if you have three that are simultaneously all powerful then guess what none of them is powerful they cancel each other out none has the advantage over the other none can say I am all powerful because they have two other persons that have the same power they do so it's a contradictory statement in what they believe in these different things it's an impossibility but if there isn't three persons then the question is well how do we we have Jesus Christ a man with a human body the Son of God now you remember when the Trinity if I just scroll back here they say that he is God the father he is God the son and he is God the Holy Spirit three Gods but when we come to scripture you do not ever find it saying God the son it is nowhere in scripture what do they say the Son of God they do not say God the son they say the Son of God they say the spirit of God they do not say God the spirit they say the spirit of God and so this the the very definitions what you get into is is if you're talking to a trinitarians they say is who is God the Father who is God the son who is God the Holy Ghost the first thing you have to say is that the scripture does not say there is God the son what it does say is there is the Son of God that is not the same thing you don't you can't make him God the way that they do but they made up those phrases it does not say God the Holy Spirit it says God is Holy it says God is a spirit it does not say God the Holy Spirit it says the spirit of God Amen so we have to understand that and if we you when we're talking of Jesus Christ specifically the scripture calls him son of David Son of God and Son of Man it never says God the son ever in scripture you cannot find a place in scripture where it says that it is what they add into it they imply it they make it into something that's not there and so you can't fight the trinitarian doctrine with trinitarian phrases you've got to say the word doesn't say that you got to be able to back away from their way of saying it but if we want to know who Christ is because that's the one that they always get messed up on usually we can come to an agreement on the Holy Spirit and and God the father that's that's something that seems to make some sense and we'll cover it in a bit but when it comes to Christ that's the one that always throws the wrench into the spokes is because they say that's a person that's a man that's a body how can you not make him a separate person but we'll go into that as we go but we want to see who Jesus Christ is and that relates to us so when we look at who Christ is now he's talking to the woman at the well remember and we're trying to understand who God is and Jesus says unto her woman believe me the hour comes when you shall neither in this mountain or yet at Jerusalem worship the father he says we ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him He says God is a spirit and they that worship Him who the spirit the father he's been talking about the father all along he says they must worship Him in spirit and in truth so who's Jesus talking about he's talking about God he is talking about the father amen he's the source and or origin of all life and what are the attributes of God he is a father he is a spirit and he is one that's the attributes of God he is God alone he's the one we worship we're not to worship anybody else but God remember what what what Moses said in Deuteronomy he says here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord he says and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might that means you can't add a second God in there there's only one and you've got to worship Him amen you can't add another one uh God of anyone's choosing or making it has to be God Alone that we love and worship but let's take both wings of the scripture because you can't preach it all out of the old and you can't preach it all out of the new they all blend in together because it's all one revealing of God is what we'll see so let's go so we've used the Old Testament here o Israel the Lord our God is one God one Lord now watch what Ephesians 4 says it says there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism see if you look in scriptures you can come up with two baptisms you can come up with in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and then you can go into acts 238 and he says in the name of Jesus Christ that is not two baptisms that is one baptism one is the revealing of what he meant in the first place and that is that we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that is the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost we'll get into that as we go through much much later not in this service today then he says there is one one God and Father of all he does not say one God the father he says one God and Father who is above all father is an attribute it is not a person son is not a person it is an attribute is I am a father I am a son I am a husband I am a pastor I'm a preacher I'm an employee that is just a description it's a title it is not a person it's saying what I am more than anything amen one God and Father of all now listen to this who is above all who is through all and in you all so we understand God and we know that the nature of God is that he is omnipresent Amen in other words God can dwell everywhere at once God can be everywhere at once that is the nature of God Amen he can divide himself up he can dwell in believers and yet we do not have thousands of God because he dwells in you and I that's not the way it works amen he's not thousands of God he is one God and one Spirit one body God can be in heaven and God can be in Earth simultaneously God can be outside of time and God can be inside of time simultaneously amen God's able to be above us through us and in us all at the same time now one way to sort of understanding it's not a perfect example but it is certainly an example is you take air we can't see it it's kind of like a spirit to us and we'll get into the nature of a spirit in a little bit amen air is everywhere practically speaking outside of a vacuum there's no air in a vacuum but we're not again we're speaking practically here so air can be in something this desk did you know is mostly Air at an atomic level there are more holes in this than there are solid points so there is air there is space there is all of these things in there and yet I can take this bottle and I can fill it full of air and air is in that bottle and yet I have not really diminished the air outside of it it is in it is above and it is through the whole thing air is everywhere and God is the same thing amen what makes God able to do this is that his attribute is that he is a spirit his his very it's not even a being a spirit is not a being like we would understand it physicality in that amen it's not just a spirit but rather it's the spirit and God is everywhere he's with us he's in us and through us and that is the ability and attribute of God is that he is everywhere he is able to be everywhere now brother Brown would say he's everywhere by omniscience that he understands and knows all things but when we understand that that God is a spirit is that he is not bound physically the way that we are he's not bound the way we are and that's why we can say he can be everywhere it's not that he is or he works that way but he is not bounded by the physical limitations that we understand amen and he's not diminished by division he's not diminished by you know we get one more person that's filled with the Holy Ghost God does not lose a little bit of himself he has not diminished in power or understanding or ability or any of these things amen he's not made less powerful by working through us none of these things affect God Amen he is God and he stands alone and he has all of this great power a and he's an eternal being that isn't bounded by the laws that we have in this world Amen and Paul makes no mistake here he says it is God our Father that lives through us and in US amen that's who it who it says he says he is our God he is our father he doesn't say he's God the father he says he is God and Father that's his nature that's that's what he he he is amen but I looked at that word through and that really jumped out of me when I looked at this because it has a peculiar meaning we can understand very quickly God above us God in heaven uh you know holy Untouchable and it's the invisible God the source of life and light and all these things and then he says now he is in us all and we can understand that by the Holy Spirit even but he says he is now he is through us and that word through means an extension or act or motion occurring in a particular place so in other words God just isn't in us and around us but God is acting and moving through us and using us on a day byday basis amen and and if you look in the scriptures where this word through is used it come it's most used commonly commonly when it says the word of God came to the prophets and really what it says is the word word of God came through the prophets that they received something and that word flowed through them not just in word but in deed as well so in other words the actions of God are not just spoken but they are lived they are produced by his power and might through US amen that's where that idea of a tangible God like we finished with on last service comes from it is not just God in us but it is God working through us that's the idea of it amen and it's not me doing it and it's not you doing it it's Christ in us that's doing it it's the Holy Spirit acting in us and we'll get more into that deeply as we move through this service tonight and further down the road but Jesus would be warning his disciples about the difficulties they would face ahead we're talking about God above us through us and in Us and how they'd be excommunicated and put in prison and beaten and brought before the rulers he says but when they deliver you up take no thought for how or what you shall speak he says for it will be given you in that same hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father it does not say God the Father it does not say God the spirit it says the spirit of your father which speaketh in you amen what is the spirit of our father it is the holy spirit it is God it's one and the same thing and Jesus is making it abundantly clear that you cannot separate these things it's all one God working in us and through US amen and that Spirit of Truth would come as we read last service and it's God himself indwelling those Apostles and it's no less the same for us today it's God himself in us we're not just a dwelling place but we're a place we're a body we're a temple that is actively in service by God working through us it's the indwelling god working through our human flesh through all of these things that we have and it's not just through ministers it's not just through men it's not just through educated people it is through all that receive the baptism of the holy spirit in their soul amen hallelujah that's how great God is today is that from the youngest the smallest one here to the oldest and the greatest here God can live and move and work in us and he is not held back by the our lack or our humility or or our our failures or faults or any of those things that's what God's trying to do amen so we see that God is a father and God is a spirit and we start to look now at the other attributes of God we come to Leviticus and he says speak now unto the congregation of the children of Israel and say unto them ye shall be holy for I the Lord your God am Holy so I am a spirit I am Holy it doesn't take a whole lot of Revelation to put that together and say God is a holy spirit God is the holy spirit scripture says God is a spirit God is holy God is the holy spirit it's not God the holy spirit it's God is the holy spirit that's that's him that is his nature that is his attributes God is Holy and no one else is except he declares it holy everything else is not God and therefore it cannot be holy We Are Holy because he says we Are Holy it's by the blood of Christ that we do that amen so we come in here that God is holy God is a spirit God is the holy spirit amen but then the question arises okay we've satisfied that I don't feel that's a difficult one to go through but now we come to Christ and we say but hold on a second that's a man that's a person that was born that's human flesh it might have been sinless but it's still a person with a mind and all of these different things amen so but if we want to see who Christ is we have to start at his origin and most people go straight to the manger and say that is his origin but that is not what the scripture says is the origin of Christ amen he was not he did not come into existence the first when he was born in the stable through Mary's body that was not the start of the Son of God that is not what the scripture says we read this literally during communion on Sunday but I'll read it again to make it clear Jesus is saying he says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from Mary no that he was come from God and went to God Amen so Jesus didn't come from Mary Jesus came from God by his own admission Jesus said remember that he was in the father and that he was returning after his death burial and resurrection and Ascension back to what he was in the father that was what he was going to do so the man the physical body of Jesus on this Earth was not the starting place for the son of God that's not the starting place for Christ amen that's just another expression of Christ but is not the start of it Christ did not begin on this Earth Christ was in existence long before he was ever manifested in flesh if we go to Colossians 1 now Paul says giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now that sounds an awful lot like two persons but let's keep reading he says' in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is what the son is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so let's start with the first bit we'll go with the image and then we'll go with the firstborn he says the image of the invisible God that is the Son of God that is Jesus Christ what is he he is the image an image would be a picture an image would be the the mirror that shows the person you can't see you know if you take a mirror and put it on the corner and angle it just right you can have somebody standing in a hallway and you can't see them but you can look at that mirror and you can see that person Christ would be like the mirror of God in that sense that he is the visible image of what you cannot see God is a spirit we'll see this in a in a second Spirits are invisible to us so God in this Earthly realm unless he would open our eyes unless he would open our understanding somehow unless he would reveal himself in some way he cannot be seen by our technology by our five natural senses we cannot touch taste feel see hear him none of those things except he would move in some way in those physical Realms so God as a spirit is completely invisible to US unless he chooses to reveal himself okay now we go to John 1118 and he says no man hath seen God at any time no one's ever seen God what God the spirit God in his original Elohim form nobody's seen him he says the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him that word decare means he has revealed him he's unfolded him he's narrated him he's explained him he's shown him so you go to the Amplified now and I kind of did a a mix of a couple different versions here it says no one has ever seen God the only begotten son who is close to the father's side has made him seen and understood so Jesus Christ is what he is the image he is the revealing the revelation of God to us amen he's the visible God to us if we want to put it that way he's the explanation he's the understanding of who and what God is Jesus Christ is God made visible to us that's where we are amen God Jesus Christ is God made understandable in the only way that we could ever really understand him amen so that we could start to comprehend him but every time God is made visible to us that is Christ that's Christ Okay so we've got to understand now that God is outside of this this Dimension he does he's not limited by it he can come into it and he can go out of it but he is not limited by our Dimension and our Dimension is limited by time space and matter a spirit is is Ageless it does not die it can be destroyed but it does not die so it's outside of time space it has no being in the way that we do naturally and there's no matter to it so it is not affected God is not affected by this realm that we are in amen and look at it this way it's kind of like if we look at the internet so if I go if I'm on the internet and I go to Facebook Facebook is a dimension it's a virtual Dimension and there I create a a Facebook profile named Jonathan klette and I can go in there and I can put pictures of myself and stories and I can share things and I can do all these things and if somebody's living in Facebook the only Jonathan klette they can see there is what I put in that profile right that is the visible Jonathan klette who exists completely outside of the the internet Dimension my reality is not the internet but I can put myself into the reality of the internet and yet never change I'm not diminished in any way so I can exist there that profile is me in the Facebook Dimension so Christ is literally if we want to put this into Facebook Christ is God in our Dimension he's the expression of God he's he he he's the thing that shows him there amen but it doesn't limit God nor does it change God in his supernatural abilities amen God's a spirit and he is outside of that Facebook Dimension outside of our Dimension but he's working with us through Christ through his profile through his explanation his visible image within time space and matter if I could put it that way does that make sense so Christ is God being revealed in our dimension in our in a way that our five senses can contact and our mind and these different things Christ is God be being revealed in a dimension that God can step into but that God also exists outside of are we okay this is a lot I know it's heavy and I'm trying to go slow and easy here and kind of reinforce for it as we go so we come now and he says he's the image of the invisible God the firstborn this is speaking now of Christ he is the firstborn of every creature you can't have a son that always was the son by definition comes after and from a father so you cannot have an eternal son you can have an everlasting son that lives forever but you can't have an eternal one because by definition a son comes from a father am amen so he says the Son of God Christ is the firstborn of every creature he was the first creation the first thing made the first of anything in this realm that we are in on this Earth amen now we have an issue when we take God and God was first of all because God existed God was not created God existed and we we were talking about this before church we can't wrap our hands around something that doesn't have a start because we are creatures of time in these bodies so everybody has a start and so for something to exist outside of time to never have a start we can't even explain that and God never chose to show us how that we're we're not able to to understand it maybe we'll understand it on the other side but God was not created he was not made he just was he was the self-existing one amen and we can't understand it and so we won't try and understand it all we do is we accept it as the attribute of God that he was in fact when he comes now to Moses remember what he says I am he's just there and he's there in the future he's there in the past he always was he always will be there is no destroying him amen but now we're not talking about God we're talking about the Son of God we're talking about Christ and it says he's the firstborn the first creation and that seems to make him an obvious separation from God we'd think but we have to see what that looked like in the scripture because otherwise we we we start to go with this idea of God the son rather than the son of God and that's where we get into all sorts of problems so let's continue in Colossians and then we'll go back to to Genesis to see the origin of the Son of God it says the Son of God was the first creation and then let's see what it says that Son of God did it says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers it says all things were created by Him and for him who the Son of God Christ okay so I want us to build on the foundation of the word here to see this it says that the Son of God created everything and everything that was created was created for him it was created by Him it belongs to him it's his It All Belongs to Christ okay we're talking about this world that's what we're looking at in the the things around it now we go to Psalm 24 it says the Earth is whose the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein then we come to acts 236 and Peter says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both what Lord and Christ Lord and Christ so it says the Earth is the Lords it says it was created by the Son of God so who created all these things because time and time again we see in the New Testament that they refer to Christ as Lord and he says even as we read in communion ye say well for so I am he is Lord amen that is a title that is a position amen and we're going to try and we can't separate now Psalms from acts and say well that was a different Lord and now there's another Lord no it's all Christ It All Belongs to him the name of the son of God is Jesus Christ but the fullness of his Revelation is that he is Lord Jesus Christ amen we'll see it as we go it's it says now as we continue in Colossians it says and he is before all things and by him all things consist so it says he came first and it's by him alone that everything that's in this world that goes on in this world it's held together it functions how he's the one that maintains life it's all the work of Christ it's all the work of the Son of God it says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning so the church period Then he says who is the beginning who Christ the first form from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now it says in him should all fullness dwell and that's a key phrase because if you're looking in the Trinity we have this Paradox we mentioned where it says that they were all powerful and yet now we have it says that everything's in one all the fullness is in one so so if they're equally powerful equal in strength they're not all powerful now he says Paul says the Son of God is the dwelling place for the fullness of God he's where all of God is as it relates to us amen he's everything that God is he has all of God that in him that can be placed in a being knowing God isn't limited but yet everything that can be placed inside of of a being is placed in Christ amen so the scripture says he is the firstborn the Christ is the first creation and if that is true then we ought to be able to go back to the very beginning and see him amen the scripture can't lie and so what we see in Colossians we ought to be able to go directly back to Genesis and see at the very beginning and we can so if we go to Genesis 1 it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period not as we see it today it was it was just a lump it had water on it mostly it was covered by water there is no real light there was no life it was just chaos it was just something sitting there okay amen and from this point until the end of verse 2 and three we have no idea what that timeline is it could be a day it could be an hour or it could be billions of years we don't know scripture doesn't say and it really doesn't matter to us CU it it's not the beginning that's not the beginning the beginning is verse three really verse end of verse two and then start of verse three it says the Earth was without form and void there was nothing there and darkness was upon the face of the deep so the whole the the entire world system the entire world was in darkness there was no light at all total darkness he says and that now what happens the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now who is the spirit of God it's the holy spirit amen it's God himself it's God our Father and he's moving across the Earth and what is he doing he's trying to produce life cuz it's just void it's Darkness there's nothing there now let's use the continuity of scripture here Paul said that the Son of God was the firstborn of every creature so he was the first thing that God created within this Earthly dimension of time space and matter okay he was the start of it all now watch how this looks because we have to see the continuity of scripture otherwise we miss the Simplicity of how God's revealing himself and verse three says and God said let there be light and there was light he said and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness now there's a separation there of light and darkness we see that as the nature of light today we see that as the the the properties of light is that you can't have light and darkness simultaneously but that is literally a cre a a work of God that that's how it works that you can't blend light and darkness that's that's what God did that's how he defined light is that there can't be any darkness in it they're incompatible you can't be in light and darkness simultaneously you can't have it you can't say your light and then have a shadow or have a dark spot in you you can't do it it's impossible now God called the light day and the Darkness he called night so when he separated it now he had a definition for what that looks like he says in the evening and the morning were the first day now people think well that's where he created the Sun the moon and the stars but if you go down in your Bible those were not created as light until Genesis 1:4 14 and 19 which is the fourth day the first day the first creative act of God is to create a light that is not the Sun the moon and the stars so what is this light what is this light we have to be able to see what this is we have to know what Genesis 1:3 is and he says let there be light and there was light now if we go back to 1 John 1 it says then this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all what did Genesis 1:3 says or 1:4 it says that God divided the light from the darkness there is no darkness in God Amen he is all light the light was divided from the darkness God is light he says and if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth why because those are divided you can't be in both simultaneously now James comes along and he says every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning in other words God is pure light today we can have impure light we don't really tend to know what pure light is I'm going to talk about it in a minute what it looks like but we have lights that flicker these lights are flickering you can't tell that but they're flickering they're not perfect because the the current that's flowing through them is not necessarily simultaneous and so there's little blinks in there and if you could you can you can see it if you take a very fast shutter speed with your camera you'll see that there is no light at times in these lights it looks like it's always there but it's not there is a shadow there is a variableness in these lights but God is not that way it's perfect light he is perfect light amen there's nothing that's dark about him there's no Shadows there and then we come so we're going through the scriptures now then we come to the very end amen we come down to the New Jerusalem it says the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and what the lamb is the light thereof now I want you to notice something who is the Lamb that is we we cannot debate who that is he is Christ Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God Amen what did John say Behold the Lamb of God he died as the lamb he's a lamb slain before the foundation of the world Amen and in the new heavens and the new Earth when we go back to our original conditions and inheritance is what is it that we walk into we walk into a city with perfect light all over again it's the original light it's the source of light now I was I was showing something to my wife here the other day and when you look at the 12 gemstones that make up the New Jerusalem when you put them so all of those stones have a certain amount of light or color okay but when you put them through pure light and they have to filter light to get it purely when you put pure light on those gems they light up completely they have light and colors that they never had before it takes pure light to reveal the beauty that's within them but if you take a diamond for instance and put it under pure light you know what it does it goes black it has its own light and it's a type of the world as it is because the things that we value have nothing in the presence of God and the humble things the little things in the presence of him they just just they just explode into color and it's a reflection of him rather than the beauty that we have ourselves unless you're in his presence those Jewels have no great Beauty comparable to a diamond if we were to choose Beauty we'd say go with diamonds they're rare they sparkle they have the but in that light if the city was made out of diamonds it would be black sisters diamonds are not a woman's best friend I've got a Doctrine for it now this is where it starts but in that light it's perfect and everything comes into these great colors the scripture says the glory of God did lighten it the scripture didn't say there is no sun moon there it says it's not needed it's not needed amen says there's NE no need for them because the lamb Christ himself is the light of it all now let's take it all the way back through the scriptures we go back to John 18 it says then spake Jesus unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of what life this is not just light for the sake of light but it's light for the sake of life amen Jesus in preview of where we're going with this whole series said in Matthew 5 ye are the light of the world but here he says I am the light of the world but there's coming a day where there's a transferral of the very thing that made him light into us that makes us the light of the world but looking backwards he was the original light he wasn't just the light of that day he was the light all along that brought forth life in Genesis now Christ is coming down to the end of his time on Earth as the Lamb of God to be sacrificed and he's talking of glory and watch how he says this now we can see who the light is at the end of The Plan of Redemption but remember which was is what shall be what it was in the beginning is what it will be at the end there's no there's no big reveal here it always was the same thing amen watch what Jesus says now and we're going back to the Garden of Gethsemane he says and now oh Father glorify thou me what with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was see he was pointing forward when he says he's pointing forward now and he's saying Lord make me what I was before so he's pointing forward but he's showing what he was in the beginning and that's the basis for what Christ is is what he was in the beginning is what he's going to always be at the end and we can look in Revelation 21 which we read and we see what that glory is he says what thine own self the glory of Christ is God indwelling him wrapped in light and that entire being is Christ the original lamb that's who he is amen the glory that Jesus had before the world as we know it is the person of God within a body that's the glory that's our Glory our glory is the presence of God within us there's nothing in this flesh that we should Glory but it's Christ in us that we would glory in that's what brother Bram says now he says when God way back before there was a star in heaven before there was even light in the skies God was there God dwelling he says all that great space of Eternity to Eternity God was setting back in eternity he says then out of God came the logos which we would say it like a little sacred light that moved out of that Darkness or out of that eternal he says as a child playing before the father's house and in his infinite mind he had the scene of what would be at the end from the beginning that he was then so what you see at the end is what he was in the beginning amen there's no new revelation here it's always it always was amen so what was at the beginning is what will be at the end so there's a lamb that's a light at the end which means it had to be a lamb that was a light at the beginning that's what Jesus was saying amen there's a lamb SL came from the foundation of the world and that's the original light now notice what he says there he says that logos out of God came the logos and he says that logos is a light and he says he doesn't say it is a child playing before God it is like it he's trying to draw a similar to what we would have in our life today where a a child would come from the father amen but when we look at Genesis 1 what happened is God the Eternal Spirits dwelling alone with himself it's just him and it's his attributes and ideas and he is everywhere and he's the unchanging God okay so this is my this is my drawing of God now I'm no brother Mark but we're going to do this as best we can so I've drawn a boundary around the edge and I've made it kind of nebulous because everything on this page if we were going to say is God he's not limited by that boundary but I've just made it there to show that everything on this page is going to be him and we see there that he's a spirit he's invisible he's shapeless he's boundless he's Eternal he's Supernatural he's holy and within God are all these things we have all the thoughts of God we have the attributes of God we have the plans of God we have the children of God we're in this picture Church we're there we're there there's all the expressions of God the purpose of God everything that God is is right there but that's all it is it's just there it's in him but it's not expressed in any way okay but now within God what happens is things start to happen within him amen and what it it is is it's his thoughts it's his plans and his ideas as they relate to us as they relate to this world and that's a portion of God okay it's not all of God but it's our portion of God the things that relate to us amen it's all from God but it's not all that God is and we call this the word and we have a written portion we have a written record of what that was right here this is what God was thinking right here and this is what you and I were right here this is the plan all of these different things the attributes of God it's all written here but it was in his mind it was in his thinking before all of these things amen it's all of God that relates to us as we needed to go through this life and return back to God it's called the word amen we can't absorb everything of God because we are uh we're we're in a natural body with a natural mind we're limited am me we bypassed our theophany and so we can't absorb all these things but God has now dwelling within him he has a portion he has a thought he has a plan he has children and we call that the word the scripture calls it the word not me that's what the scripture calls it amen now what happens is God has all of this there and then what happens is God spoke and what did he say he said let there be light and so out of him now comes the the word that was a thought now it is the spoken word okay that's the spoken word that comes out of him he says let there be light and what happen the thoughts the Expressions the plans of God went out of him not out of him because he's everywhere but rather they went forth would be the way to put it okay so they went forth from God it didn't separate itself from him but rather it came out of him and it was put into action by the spoken word okay that's what God's doing so what happens after that spoken word Goes Forth is what light because what he thought of first was light so he's producing the word but the first thing that he produces is light and when God thought and spoke by the word then it became reality so logos went out of God the word went out of God that's what logos is it's just the word the word went out of God and it came into existence and what was that light what was that logos it was light it was what we would call the pillar of fire okay so what is it the the logos the the light is what it's the what living manifestation of the word it's the reality of the word it's God living in and through his word that's all it is okay God didn't just make this light to to look at he made it for a purpose and so what did God do God didn't just let the light sit there but it was a created Supernatural light and it's a place where the invisible spirit of God Elohim now the self-existing one could step into and dwell and so God steps in into that Pillar of Fire amen and that light now becomes God visible that's the son right there the Son of God it's a body it's a being created for God to dwell in see we look at at this idea and this is I think the the great problem with the Trinity is they keep looking at persons as if God has to always be a person no he just needs a body to work through he just needs an expression it's him over and over and over again in whichever way he chooses amen so the light was not God himself but when God stepped into it then that light was all God it was not all of God but it was all God it was 100% so my DNA is 50% Lanny klet 50% Sandy klet okay so I'm not all dad and I'm not all mom but when this light came forth it was by the word and the word is a part of God and so that light is 100% DNA of God if we want to put it that way it source is all God so the light is perfectly God there's no other thing mixed into it it's all God but it's not all that God is if I could put it that way amen that light becomes God to us amen what was it it was Christ it was the anointed one The Dwelling Place of God that's all Christ means is the anointed one and the word Christ indicates the presence of God in a body that's it and like I said we can't look at the body as if it is a body of a person but rather whatever God steps into becomes him and that's the way it is amen it's a body of light in this case because that was an attribute that God tied to himself and so there you have God invisible form you have God living and dwelling in his own word amen it's not only a person but then we now we come back to John 1:1 and we can start to understand now how this works because John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and then it says the word was with God and then it says the Word was God and that is three separate events three separate Expressions if we want to put it so if we go back to our diagram now we look on the left side in the beginning was the word what is it it's the thoughts and and the attributes of God and it was with God it was a part of him not expressed but it was there and then by the spoken word it's expressed out of his mouth and then it's manif ested into reality and now the Word was God because God steps into it it's with him and now God steps into it and that becomes God to us it's not all of God but God steps into it the fullness of God steps into that amen so it's all God but it's not all of God as I've said before so he spoke that word and it left him and it becomes light and now God pours himself into that light and he can dwell there and he can be there and that light was all of God he's a spirit everywhere the time so it's not that God lost or changed himself but God said this is how I'm going to reveal myself and interact with my creation now so God poured all of the attributes that he is into that there's no variance there's no difference between what's in that light and who God is everything that God is the nature of God he poured into there amen and it's for this season and time this blip and Eternity and God said this is for me this is my portion to work in and that's the expression of God the light on its own is not God but as soon as God steps into it God now that's the god that's revealed to us that's the way it works amen it's all God it's just not all of him but it's him that's that's the difficulty for for people to understand is that something can be God and yet not be all of him it's the only thing he can do there he's just fitting himself in a vessel that we can sort of understand but he's everywhere amen the invisible God always remains the invisible God but he's putting himself into something and what he's doing he's a spirit he's life he's omnipotent he's omniscient he's omnipresent and all that Arrow represents there's not something that leaves God but rather it's the expressing of God and it comes out of himself in order to be manifested okay it becomes the embodiment of God it becomes a theophany is what the scripture calls it amen it's a supernatural body and brother Bradon would say that God God's body it can be a light it can be the angel of the Lord it can be MDC it can be a whirlwind it can be a burning bush it can be a pillar of fire it can be a pillar of cloud all of these things is is God being expressed in a body and those bodies can speak right the pillar of fire can speak the burning bush could speak there came a voice out of the wind all of these things can speak God is not limited to a a body of a human he is whatever he dwells in that is God that can work inside of it amen so that logos that light there that that that expression of the word the manifestation of the word is the same substance as God is if it had DNA it would be the exact same DNA as God it's only when we come to Jesus that we get to see physical DNA if we wanted to put it that way amen but it's the same life life essence of as God is amen and so it's that part of God that came out just before the creation of this world as it is today that's John 1:1 and this is the whole whole picture of John 1:1 the word was with God the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God because the start of the beginning is the thought and the expression of God in his mind soon as he starts to think that then that's when time starts to tick and then from that thinking there comes a speaking and from the speaking comes the reality and that's the beginning is as soon as we come into reality there's time started amen there's a clock that's ticking and what is it it's God creating All Things by the word amen that's what he's doing brother bramin says this now he says I can see him speak to this world hanging there as an icicle whatever it was way way away and he moved it over here I see this little like go out that that logos that Pillar of Fire he says now we got two now the father and out of the father come the light the sun he says and I can see that light moving over here and it pulled the Earth over near the sun to dry it off and he began to raise the water up and separated the land the Earth from the water and so forth and then he be to create and he made the fishes of the sea the vegetable life he put the cattle on the hill and it all looked good to him who did Christ that light the Sun the s o n the s o n but now brother Braham says this he says now we got two there he says in you Oneness Brethren many of you get off the wrong track when you try to think of God as one like your finger is one he says he can't be his own father he can't be but he is God he says God is Jehovah the spirit Christ was the house that he dwelt in so the fact is that this logos this word is simply God expressing himself visibly within our Dimension so first it was in God then it comes out of God and now it is with God Amen but it does not become less of God it is God from start to finish it is all from God Amen so you can't see God because he's a spirit but now God becomes visible so is that logos really God sure but it's an expression of him and that's why it was with him amen it's not it is two but it is not two persons that's the problem is when you start to make personalities now you have Wills Natures desires thoughts and opinions and all these different things it is not two persons it is a body and it is god with his body amen God dwelling in his body amen that's why it's with him it's God in his body so whenever you see the scripture like we read in Colossians one that God created everything through Jesus Christ it means he created All Things by and through his spoken word the word itself became a manifestation and then out of that word flowed the rest of the word amen so while the logos the word that Pillar of Fire it's numerically distinct brother BR would say we got two now amen he says he's not one like your finger is one it's not a distinct personality from God it's not a different personality from the invisible God it's a super superatural but visible extension of God himself amen that pillar fire could talk it could act it could move it could touch it was a supernatural body with God in it working and moving God showing himself amen and what does that word do it continues the creation work the plan of God by the word of God you look at at that diagram and you can see two but it's not two like we think cuz it's all encapsulated in what God is amen God isn't one like we think because he's that Spirit he's Unbound he's limited like the air we talked about he he he isn't limited that way he can be around you and in you at the same time you can have air within you and outside of you and all through these things and and in a compressor or whatever and it doesn't change the fact that there's air everywhere but we can't see it but yet it's there but now you put it in something and you can squeeze it there's air in this I can squeeze it and I can only go so far why because there's air inside of it if that was God we'd say there's God inside of it cuz I can feel I can't see him but I can feel how he's resisting the motion here amen amen so God has an expression and a manifestation and that's the logos that's the word so everything we see of God is that logos it's that word and God wanted to reveal himself and so out of him came that logos that body it's the theophonic then clearly God is not bound by us so why is he Bound by Christ we'll get into what that fullness means cuz I think some of you are thinking that well he said the fullness but we'll talk about what that fullness is man but this light this fire and this is where we're going to go and we're almost done this evening amen it's it was God and what was he doing brother bran would say he's putting on a mask when you say he's putting on a body that's what trips people up because they keep thinking Body Mind personality these things like like Jesus Christ was on this Earth but it's God just putting on a first mask and what is this first mask it's God above us you'll never see brother Bram say it's God the father in that sense and God the son he doesn't use those terms because it's it's trinitarian terms but he says it's God above us God With Us and God in us and you'll see that it's what we read it says God is above us God is through us and God is in US amen it's it's God revealing himself and the first mask of God is the pillar of Fire it's the word logos it's a it's a it's a fiery being it's a light and we know this fire we know what this light is we know what this fire is it's clearly identified through scriptures and we'll we'll start that next service Lord willing but we can even understand it as we look at ourselves amen we are a body we are a soul and we are a spirit we're one person but we have an expression of three things amen I have an expression through my soul I have an expression through my spirit or my mind then I have an expression through my body and there's different senses that go with with all of those different things so I am one and yet there's three things going on in me at the same time none of them is different from me it's all a part of me but there's a different expression each time amen so we're not one like our finger is one we've got a lot going on inside of that finger if we were to put it that way and God's not like our finger brother Jason said it this way he says God is the unfolding God and I thought that was a beautiful way to put it you know the scripture says and Jesus warned them in Matthew 24 he says there'll be false christs that say Christ is here and Christ is there he says don't believe them you know why because there's going to be real christs and they don't have to say go here and go there they're going to say he's right here it's not that there won't be christs it's that the real ones don't have to point you elsewhere forth they'll be able to say he's in my heart he's living in me showing the world that he's alive and well amen but if we go to John 1 as we just start to close here he says what in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God he says the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made by who Christ we read it in Colossians 1 Christ's identification is the word that's how we identify him amen and we see that the word means the expression of the thoughts and intentions of God it's the anointed one it's the manifestation it's the expression it's the visible image it's the the reality of God in him who in him in the word in Christ was life why cuz life follows light and you couldn't have life unless you had light and as soon as that light is created we start to see Life come with it he says now and that life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not what did Genesis 1:4 say light and darkness were divided Darkness could not overcome light light winds Darkness cannot stay in the presence of light amen God bless you let's stand this evening with teaching I don't want to go too long that's for sure and we'll carry on what this light is and and the revealing of Christ as we go through this this this short portion of this series amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I can feel so inadequate at times when we get into some of these things but Lord I pray that there's a Clarity here that comes from your word Lord that as we go through this Lord that it would lock in these these scriptural truths Lord that have been revealed to us us Lord in this last age Lord like they were in the first Lord and I pray that you'd help us to see not just who you are and who you were Lord but that we could clearly identify you in our own lives Lord that we could see how it is that you can be God and you can be around and through and yet in US each and every one Lord that we could live a life that's Christ in us the hope of glory Lord and that we could come through it all Lord that we we'd be able to express your word just as Christ did on this Earth as well we pray Lord I pray you bless your people Lord be with us this night we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen it's Jesus I really want to see 10:07 do we know this one if we
