[49:39] philippians 2 and verse 5 says let this
[49:41] mind be in you which was also in christ
[49:43] jesus who being in the form of god
[49:45] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[49:47] god but made himself of no reputation
[49:50] and took upon him the form of a servant
[49:52] and was made in the likeness of man and
[49:55] being found in fashion as a man he
[49:57] humbled himself
[49:58] and became obedient unto death even the
[50:01] death of the cross wherefore god also
[50:04] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[50:06] name which is above
[50:08] every name that at the name of jesus
[50:11] every knee should bow of things in
[50:13] heaven and things in earth and things
[50:15] under the earth and that every tongue
[50:17] should confess that jesus christ is lord
[50:19] to the glory of god the father
[50:22] wherefore my beloved as ye als have
[50:24] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[50:27] but now much more in my absence work out
[50:29] your own salvation with fear and
[50:32] trembling
[50:33] for it is god which worketh in you both
[50:36] to will and to do of his good pleasure
[50:39] how
[50:40] by the mind of christ and you amen when
[50:43] the mind is subject and led by the holy
[50:44] spirit we will not only want to do what
[50:46] he asks us to do but we will do what he
[50:49] wants us to do
[50:50] it says in verse 14 do all things
[50:52] without murmurings and disputings that
[50:55] ye may be blameless and harmless
[50:58] the sons of god without rebuke in the
[51:01] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[51:04] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[51:06] world
[51:07] holding forth the word of law
[51:11] no it says holding forth the word of
[51:14] life that i may rejoice in the day of
[51:17] christ that i have not run in vain
[51:20] neither labored in vain amen that's the
[51:22] prophet's reward is when people will
[51:23] accept his word and not just take it in
[51:26] their minds but take it into their lives
[51:28] and live it out amen god bless you you
[51:29] can have your seats this morning and
[51:31] then we're going to continue in this
[51:33] this little series of in his form and
[51:35] with his mind and we want to just kind
[51:38] of do a quick review with the collins
[51:40] family wasn't here in some different
[51:41] ones so i just want to do a quick review
[51:43] here over where we started but we we set
[51:45] a foundation last service for the
[51:47] unveiling of god we spoke about how you
[51:49] had jehovah god the the self-existing
[51:52] one there at the very beginning he was a
[51:54] spirit you couldn't see him you couldn't
[51:55] touch him you couldn't feel him and so
[51:57] he created what he created out of
[51:59] himself a light and he stepped into that
[52:01] light and the light itself was not god
[52:03] it was a form for him and then he
[52:05] stepped into it and so that when you saw
[52:08] the light you could say there is god
[52:10] amen now the light was not god but the
[52:12] light was what the the veil that god was
[52:14] hiding himself behind and so for us as
[52:17] as humans we would say wherever that
[52:19] light is wherever that pillar of fire is
[52:21] wherever that logos of god is we would
[52:22] say there is god that's god to us that's
[52:25] the only representation that's the only
[52:27] visible aspect of god that we have so we
[52:29] say that is god because we can we can
[52:31] make contact with that amen and he
[52:33] called that light what it was the son of
[52:35] god it was a thing that came out of god
[52:37] it was born out of god it was a part of
[52:39] god and it was the visible manifestation
[52:41] of god and that was the son amen now we
[52:44] read in colossians 1
[52:46] verse 12 says giving thanks unto the
[52:48] father which had made us meet to be
[52:50] partakers of the inheritance of the
[52:53] saints in light that means he's made us
[52:55] what worthy
[52:56] he says he's made you meet he's made you
[52:58] remember when you look in genesis it
[53:01] talks about he made a help meet for the
[53:03] man one that is suitable he says he's
[53:05] made us suitable to be partakers in the
[53:07] inheritance of the saints and light who
[53:09] had delivered us from the power of
[53:11] darkness so we all everyone no matter if
[53:14] we are raised in a message family and a
[53:15] pastor's family whatever it is we were
[53:18] all in what under the power of darkness
[53:20] every one of us and had translated us
[53:23] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[53:26] we have redemption through his blood
[53:28] even the forgiveness of sins who is the
[53:30] image of the invisible god and so many
[53:33] people will stop there but he says the
[53:35] firstborn of every creature the
[53:37] firstborn of every creation the
[53:39] firstborn of every child of god amen so
[53:42] god stepped into that body of christ he
[53:44] was the image of the invisible god and
[53:46] that is his name jesus christ and he is
[53:48] the son of god now brother branham just
[53:51] again we're doing a quick review here he
[53:52] says out yonder i see now all that space
[53:56] that all is god without form forever for
[53:59] eternities no beginning no ending it's
[54:01] all god
[54:03] he says before there was even air there
[54:05] was god the very beginning of nature of
[54:08] creation was god and now the bible
[54:10] teaches us that the logos went out of
[54:12] god or i might say now listen to this he
[54:15] says
[54:16] all of the god becoming his first body
[54:20] form when the logos went out of god
[54:24] let's look what it looked like no one
[54:25] has seen the father at any time nowhere
[54:28] they never did and they never will
[54:30] but notice how he says here becoming his
[54:33] first body form
[54:35] that means if there is a first there
[54:37] must be a second and potentially a third
[54:39] and a fourth and a fifth and an eighth
[54:40] and a tenth and all these different
[54:42] things and we went through that on
[54:43] wednesday when we looked at the
[54:44] unfolding the unveiling of god and we
[54:46] saw him in melchizedek we saw him in the
[54:49] lord that talked to abraham remember he
[54:51] said unto him lord he called him lord he
[54:52] called him elohim he called him god
[54:55] jehovah amen and then we saw him as a
[54:57] fourth man in the fire and then we saw
[54:59] him as jesus christ in a corporal body
[55:01] and then we saw him as a pillar of fire
[55:03] that knocks all off of his horse it was
[55:05] all christ it was all the anointed one
[55:07] it was all the son of god it was all god
[55:09] in a different form in a different body
[55:12] of his own choosing and he could take
[55:14] any form he wants and i was reading
[55:16] quotes from brother and said god can
[55:17] take on any form he wants
[55:19] right he can do it whatever way he wants
[55:21] he can veil himself any way he wants
[55:23] because he's god and he can put himself
[55:25] into whatever he wants for a moment amen
[55:28] now we spoke is that that verse says of
[55:30] jesus christ was the firstborn among
[55:32] many brethren so that means he's the
[55:34] first of a long line of brethren he's
[55:36] the first of a long a long line of forms
[55:39] of god if we want to put it that way of
[55:41] p of beings that are indwelt by the very
[55:44] life and purpose of god amen and when
[55:46] jesus said in the scripture we saw that
[55:48] he had a lineage and he says i come from
[55:50] god and i go back to god and we read the
[55:53] quotes of brother brahm says he started
[55:54] as light and he went back to light
[55:56] because we saw him as light in the
[55:57] beginning and then when he knocks all
[55:59] off his horse he was light but in
[56:00] between he's all of these different
[56:02] forms but yet it was god in a form and
[56:04] then it goes back to god and then it
[56:06] comes god out again to another form and
[56:08] it goes back to god and the point is
[56:10] whatever is of god always comes back to
[56:12] god i mean that's what we want to
[56:13] recognize here and he has what a
[56:15] theophany body and each one of us has a
[56:17] theophany body it's a glorified body
[56:19] where we're meant to dwell with him
[56:21] forever
[56:22] amen
[56:23] that's the only place we'll be sinless
[56:24] and perfect in totality is when we get
[56:26] into our theophany bodies paul says here
[56:29] in
[56:29] ephesians 5 because he's preparing a
[56:31] sinless perfect bride and in ephesians
[56:33] he says husbands love your wives even as
[56:35] christ also loved the church and gave
[56:38] himself for it that he might sanctify
[56:40] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[56:42] by the word that he might present it to
[56:44] himself a glorious church not having
[56:47] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[56:49] that he
[56:50] that it should be holy and without
[56:52] blemish so if you have any doubts about
[56:55] your lineage today if you have any
[56:56] doubts about your bloodline if you have
[56:58] any doubts about your worthiness read
[56:59] this scripture because it has nothing to
[57:01] do with where you come from in this
[57:03] natural world that we live in amen it
[57:05] doesn't matter who my daddy is doesn't
[57:06] matter who my father is doesn't matter
[57:08] who my pastor is none of this matters as
[57:10] long as i was a part of him in the
[57:12] beginning because he's the one that's
[57:13] taking care and bringing me to that
[57:15] place of spotless holiness and without
[57:18] blemish conditioning amen
[57:20] but in between that in between our start
[57:22] and our finish there's a redemptive
[57:24] process that's going on and it's what
[57:26] it's restoring us back to our eating
[57:28] condition amen
[57:29] what we have right now is not that
[57:31] perfect spotless thing i only have one
[57:33] part of me redeemed right now and that's
[57:34] my soul amen i have eternal life i've
[57:36] been sealed by the holy spirit and
[57:38] that's the full redemption but i still
[57:39] have a body that's completely blocking
[57:42] my my spiritual nature that is warring
[57:44] against me day in and day out so i'm not
[57:46] fully redeemed yet amen i'm looking for
[57:48] something more but i'm satisfied right
[57:50] now to have eternal life and i have the
[57:52] fellowship with god that i need amen
[57:54] amen
[57:55] but from there we took it to genesis and
[57:57] we saw how adam was first created in the
[57:59] image of god and he was first created in
[58:01] a spirit form and within that spirit
[58:02] form was both the male and the female
[58:04] natures amen so he was like god you
[58:06] couldn't touch him couldn't feel him
[58:08] couldn't see him but then what happened
[58:10] was he follow he was created the same as
[58:12] god but then he followed the same
[58:14] manifestation curve or the manifestation
[58:16] path of god if we wanted to put it that
[58:18] way and what happened was he stepped
[58:19] into a body now he stepped into
[58:21] something that we could see feel and
[58:22] touch and the prophet of god says he was
[58:24] put into a body that could interact with
[58:27] his own home
[58:28] right he could interact with the plants
[58:30] he could interact with the animals they
[58:31] could see him here and feel and these
[58:33] different things
[58:34] amen now the prophet said this he says
[58:36] now let us make man in our own image and
[58:39] if he made a man in his own image he
[58:41] made a supernatural being yes indeed he
[58:44] says genesis 1 28 read it and see if
[58:46] that isn't right and when we look at
[58:48] adam's lineage in luke it says which was
[58:50] the son of enos which was the son of
[58:52] seth which was the son of adam which was
[58:55] the son of
[58:57] god
[58:58] amen the son of god so you have right
[59:00] there the second among many brethren the
[59:02] first one was christ second one was adam
[59:04] his lineage
[59:05] in the book of luke says that he was the
[59:08] son of god
[59:09] he was the first one put in a in a human
[59:11] form on this earth amen so adam's
[59:13] original state and our original position
[59:16] was as a son of god amen we're not to be
[59:18] the way we are now and then so often
[59:20] we're we feel like we're natural beings
[59:22] having a supernatural experience but the
[59:24] prophet of god said we're supernatural
[59:26] beings having a natural experience amen
[59:29] and so the question is are we looking to
[59:31] the unseen are we looking to the
[59:32] supernatural or are we looking to the
[59:34] natural are we looking to have what are
[59:36] we looking to have
[59:38] have the focus and the energy in our
[59:39] life what are we looking to for
[59:41] overcoming power what are we looking to
[59:43] to resolve the things in our lives is it
[59:45] the natural arm or is it the
[59:46] supernatural alarm because if we're
[59:48] being restored back to our position then
[59:50] we ought to be seeing the supernatural
[59:52] effect in our lives rather than running
[59:53] around trying to achieve it all
[59:54] ourselves
[59:56] amen
[59:58] then we saw how god created a place just
[1:00:00] for adam and it was a garden called eden
[1:00:02] and it was planted just in a particular
[1:00:04] place for adam to take care of and then
[1:00:07] god had given him a purpose god had
[1:00:08] given him a place god had prepared
[1:00:10] something for adam to do and we spoke
[1:00:12] how god doesn't put us on the earth to
[1:00:14] do nothing he always has a purpose he
[1:00:16] always has a plan he always has
[1:00:17] something that we can do and only we can
[1:00:20] do so from brother mark down in the
[1:00:22] corner all the way back to brother
[1:00:23] bichel in the other corner each and
[1:00:25] every one of us has a place to be and a
[1:00:27] thing to do and a way to do it and god
[1:00:30] has prepared us and made us a body and
[1:00:32] given us a nature and given us these
[1:00:34] different things that we need to achieve
[1:00:35] what god has laid out for us amen
[1:00:38] now i want to pick up from there because
[1:00:39] if we go back to genesis 1 it kind of
[1:00:41] sets out adam's scope of work now
[1:00:43] anybody that's worked in business at
[1:00:45] some time that's that's worked with
[1:00:46] doing contracts and whatnot whenever
[1:00:48] you're applying to do work and you're
[1:00:49] putting in a bid what do they give you
[1:00:51] they give you a document called the
[1:00:52] scope of work and if they accept your
[1:00:54] bid and they say we're going to pay you
[1:00:55] money then you have to do everything
[1:00:57] that's in that scope of work and you
[1:00:58] have to do it the way they said and you
[1:01:00] have to achieve the goals they said and
[1:01:01] you've got to hit the milestones that
[1:01:02] they've said in the time that they said
[1:01:04] and if you do that then you get money
[1:01:06] and if you don't get it a lot of times
[1:01:07] you have to pay penalties or they get to
[1:01:09] take some money back from you right but
[1:01:11] god laid out a scope of work for adam
[1:01:13] and for eve if you remember and then
[1:01:14] genesis 1 it says so god created man in
[1:01:17] his own image in the image of god
[1:01:19] created he him male and female created
[1:01:22] he them now we saw that that was two
[1:01:23] different things at the beginning was a
[1:01:24] spirit form both of them there and then
[1:01:26] the second one he gave them bodies right
[1:01:28] and god blessed them and god said unto
[1:01:30] them be fruitful and multiply
[1:01:34] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[1:01:36] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:01:38] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:01:40] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:01:42] earth
[1:01:43] now
[1:01:44] what is god doing here
[1:01:45] he's giving adam a piece of his mind and
[1:01:47] not the way that we get a piece of a
[1:01:49] mind from somebody in the world today
[1:01:50] he's saying adam here's my thoughts
[1:01:53] about this situation here's what i want
[1:01:55] you to do he's saying here's what i'm
[1:01:57] seeing play out in my mind now adam go
[1:01:59] out and do what i'm telling you to do
[1:02:01] that's my peace of mind for you that's
[1:02:03] what i've got for you adam and i'm
[1:02:05] telling you what it is so you don't have
[1:02:06] to wonder you don't have to worry am i
[1:02:09] in god's will am i not in god's will
[1:02:10] what is god's will he's saying adam
[1:02:12] here's my will
[1:02:14] now this might seem like a bit of an
[1:02:16] impossible task if it was just us
[1:02:18] because in our condition in our bodies
[1:02:20] right now we wouldn't be able to do what
[1:02:21] adam's doing
[1:02:23] but god never sets us with an impossible
[1:02:25] task amen he always gives us what we
[1:02:27] have needed he always gives us the tools
[1:02:29] he always gives us the weapons he gives
[1:02:30] us the power the authority whatever it
[1:02:32] is god never asks us to do an impossible
[1:02:34] task
[1:02:35] but i want you to break down i want to
[1:02:37] break down here this morning what god
[1:02:38] told adam because we'll see that what
[1:02:40] happened in the fall was that they got
[1:02:42] away from their task and they didn't
[1:02:43] realize some of these things and they
[1:02:45] got away from it or eve got away from it
[1:02:47] in particular
[1:02:48] now the first thing he says is be
[1:02:49] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:02:51] earth so in other words have children
[1:02:53] and have lots of children
[1:02:55] that was the goal for adam and eve was
[1:02:57] to replenish but we do not see anywhere
[1:02:59] in scripture where he tells them how to
[1:03:00] do it that's right he doesn't tell him
[1:03:03] how to do it but he tells them to do it
[1:03:04] and we see that perhaps that's what
[1:03:06] tripped eve up was that she was trying
[1:03:07] to have children with a way that god had
[1:03:10] told her not to do it right there was a
[1:03:12] way that seemed obvious and then there
[1:03:13] was god's way if i could put it that way
[1:03:16] and sometimes that's what we're looking
[1:03:17] and saying lord this is obvious he says
[1:03:18] yes but that's not my way
[1:03:20] i've got a way for you to do well lord i
[1:03:22] don't know how to do it but just wait
[1:03:24] i've told you how to do it so i'll make
[1:03:25] the way but don't try and do it your way
[1:03:26] because i've told you not to do it your
[1:03:28] way
[1:03:29] right
[1:03:30] but that word replenish means to fill so
[1:03:32] god was really expecting them to have a
[1:03:33] lot of children that's a lot of pressure
[1:03:35] on a woman have a lot of children
[1:03:38] but it wasn't meant to be that way and i
[1:03:39] believe the prophet said it was supposed
[1:03:40] to be spoken world children because
[1:03:42] that's what christ was was a spoken word
[1:03:44] son and then it was perfect it was
[1:03:45] sinless it was without intercourse in
[1:03:47] these different things
[1:03:49] now the second task was to subdue the
[1:03:51] earth now that word subdue means to
[1:03:53] dominate to bring into submission to
[1:03:56] subject to one's authority and rule and
[1:03:58] to tread down now that doesn't seem like
[1:04:00] something you'd have to do to a new
[1:04:02] creation but you remember the earth was
[1:04:04] it says in genesis 1 it says that the
[1:04:06] world was what
[1:04:08] without form and void and that word or
[1:04:10] that phrasing there means that it was in
[1:04:12] chaos there had been a judgment that had
[1:04:14] put on the earth and so god was now
[1:04:16] bringing things back out but this earth
[1:04:18] was not some sort of oasis
[1:04:20] it was a wasteland he had just separated
[1:04:22] the the the atmosphere he put the
[1:04:24] atmosphere up and separated the water
[1:04:26] and the land so it was potentially
[1:04:28] livable but this place was a it was just
[1:04:31] nothing everything had been destroyed
[1:04:32] everything had been covered by water
[1:04:33] there was no life on it there was no
[1:04:35] plant life nothing and so god has made
[1:04:37] everything possible there the
[1:04:39] potential's in the ground but it's still
[1:04:41] in a state of chaos when he puts adam
[1:04:43] down there
[1:04:44] amen so maybe there are all sorts of
[1:04:46] things happening maybe there was great
[1:04:47] earthquakes and natural disasters and
[1:04:49] whatnot and so he comes down and he says
[1:04:51] you've got to subdue the earth he's not
[1:04:54] he's talking about the geography he's
[1:04:56] talking about the the natural elements
[1:04:57] here he's not just talking about the
[1:04:59] animals but he's saying adam you've got
[1:05:01] to have control and you've got to
[1:05:02] control everything that's going on in
[1:05:04] this planet now yeah amen now god had
[1:05:06] done some of the work he'd separated the
[1:05:08] things out but he says look adam you've
[1:05:10] got to come in and take control because
[1:05:11] if we're looking to grow the earth then
[1:05:13] guess what you don't want these the
[1:05:14] these category five hurricanes coming
[1:05:16] and ripping up your plants as soon as
[1:05:18] they come out right you've got to give
[1:05:19] them a chance to grow and then maybe
[1:05:21] you'll let in storms from time to time
[1:05:22] to what to anchor the roots to get them
[1:05:24] strong and make them resilient but
[1:05:26] you're not going to destroy everything
[1:05:27] you're allowed to come in so adam has
[1:05:29] control over the entire earth god says
[1:05:31] you got to take it you got to take the
[1:05:32] earth by the scruff of the next sort of
[1:05:34] thing and you've got to now protect what
[1:05:36] god has asked you to grow up
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:39] the prophet of god says this about adam
[1:05:41] he says and when god made man in his own
[1:05:44] image he put him on the earth as a
[1:05:45] lesser god jesus declared it when he
[1:05:48] said is not it written in your laws that
[1:05:50] you are god's and if they called those
[1:05:52] gods who the word of god came to which
[1:05:54] was the prophets how can you condemn me
[1:05:56] when i say i am the son of god he said
[1:05:59] see but they just couldn't understand it
[1:06:01] see
[1:06:02] now look how jesus phrased it he says
[1:06:04] they called them gods who the word of
[1:06:05] god came to and pointed to the prophets
[1:06:08] now we're not all prophets but guess
[1:06:10] what the word of god has come to each
[1:06:11] and every one of us hasn't it and then
[1:06:13] the word has to come to you as an
[1:06:14] individual in order for you to receive
[1:06:16] it and to step out in faith and accept
[1:06:18] the the blood of
[1:06:20] of calvary and and to go down and be
[1:06:22] baptized and receive the holy ghost amen
[1:06:26] so you have to receive a word and a word
[1:06:28] has to come to you and that word has to
[1:06:29] come from god if it's going to bring
[1:06:30] forth god's life in you amen but christ
[1:06:33] comes here and they're they're pointing
[1:06:34] them and saying you make yourself
[1:06:37] you're committing
[1:06:38] you know blasphemy because you make
[1:06:39] yourself a son of god and he says i'm
[1:06:41] here and i'm doing literally the works
[1:06:43] of god in front of you how can you not
[1:06:45] see this if you can call a prophet who
[1:06:47] speaks the word
[1:06:49] a god then how about one that lives the
[1:06:51] word not only just speaks it but lives
[1:06:53] and he says if you don't believe me
[1:06:54] believe the works that i do i'm doing
[1:06:56] the very works of god in front of you
[1:06:58] and you won't believe it because you're
[1:06:59] so stuck on what
[1:07:01] what you think the word means
[1:07:03] and meanwhile the word is living out in
[1:07:05] front of them amen
[1:07:06] amen but the word has come to us in the
[1:07:08] same way that it has come to him because
[1:07:09] it's called us to a place it's called us
[1:07:11] to a position it's called us to a
[1:07:13] purpose and as we step into that then we
[1:07:15] become what sons and daughters of god i
[1:07:18] mean that's all he's looking for us to
[1:07:19] do amen it didn't just come to isaiah it
[1:07:21] didn't just come to samuel it didn't
[1:07:23] just come to william branham it didn't
[1:07:24] just come to paul it didn't just come to
[1:07:26] jesus christ but there is a word come in
[1:07:28] our day to call out a people to become
[1:07:30] what the bride of jesus christ the
[1:07:32] representation the form of god on this
[1:07:35] earth right now with his mind yes sir
[1:07:38] now we're not the fullness we know we're
[1:07:40] not the fullness collectively he's
[1:07:41] poured all of himself into us but
[1:07:43] brother mark will never be the fullness
[1:07:44] of god any more than weisha will or
[1:07:46] myself or anyone else right but there'll
[1:07:48] be a portion of god and it's up to us to
[1:07:50] see that in one another amen to see the
[1:07:52] portion of god rather than the carnality
[1:07:54] that surrounds it amen
[1:07:58] brother braham says it this way he says
[1:08:00] man was made as a secondary god on earth
[1:08:03] he was given the power to control all
[1:08:05] things all elements of the earth that
[1:08:08] was adam adam was given those great
[1:08:10] powers but then the power
[1:08:12] that he was given to make himself
[1:08:14] is where he fell and adam could speak to
[1:08:17] the winds and it would stop
[1:08:19] he could speak to the trees and they
[1:08:20] would obey him he could speak to the
[1:08:23] wildlife it would obey him he could
[1:08:24] speak to the waters whatever it was
[1:08:26] everything obeyed adam now that's the
[1:08:28] beginning of man that's what god gave
[1:08:30] him power over everything on earth but
[1:08:33] you see where he said adam failed he
[1:08:34] says the power that was given him to
[1:08:36] make himself that's where he fell
[1:08:38] he never got around to that and then eve
[1:08:40] tried to take over and that's where she
[1:08:41] messed up
[1:08:43] he says but man was put here with a
[1:08:45] dominion over the earth he had
[1:08:47] everything under his control and what
[1:08:49] adam lost jesus proved that he had
[1:08:51] restored he stopped nature he raised the
[1:08:54] dead he done everything and the world is
[1:08:57] groaning today the bible says for the
[1:08:58] manifestation of the sons plural more of
[1:09:02] them more than william branham more than
[1:09:04] jesus christ amen it is a multitude of
[1:09:07] the sons and daughters of god
[1:09:09] for god to get his people again or his
[1:09:12] children again in realities to make
[1:09:16] things real he says and it stumbles the
[1:09:18] people wow
[1:09:20] where are we standing today
[1:09:22] if the prophet has come and showed us
[1:09:24] what it looks like to be an adopted son
[1:09:26] and daughter son of god where are we to
[1:09:28] be standing today amen the prophet of
[1:09:30] god said the church is what living below
[1:09:33] her privileges
[1:09:34] and when you ran when she what when the
[1:09:37] true church recognizes who she is the
[1:09:39] rapture will go so all we're looking to
[1:09:42] do now is recognize who we are and you
[1:09:44] know how you recognize who you are
[1:09:46] fellowship with him
[1:09:49] that's the only way you're ever going to
[1:09:50] do it that's the only way you're ever
[1:09:52] going to know who you are is if you
[1:09:53] listen to him more than anything else
[1:09:54] and anyone else amen if you sit under
[1:09:56] the preaching of the word if you're
[1:09:58] reading your bible if you're praying if
[1:09:59] you're giving more time to that voice
[1:10:01] than any other voice that's in this
[1:10:03] generation then you're going to start to
[1:10:05] realize who and what you are but if you
[1:10:07] start to listen to other voices if you
[1:10:08] start to listen to a religious voice a
[1:10:10] serpent voice then you're not going to
[1:10:12] recognize who you are because he's going
[1:10:13] to pull you away into trying to make it
[1:10:15] happen yourself
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:18] listen we're not called to rearrange the
[1:10:20] geography of the planet and control the
[1:10:21] elements in the way that that adam was
[1:10:25] god may call us to do that at some point
[1:10:27] god may call us to do that at some point
[1:10:29] but we're here to do one thing and what
[1:10:31] is that
[1:10:32] is to destroy the effects of satan's
[1:10:33] kingdom in our life
[1:10:35] i mean that's what he's looking to do is
[1:10:36] restore us back to where what satan is
[1:10:39] as what effectively blocked and unable
[1:10:42] to affect us as he was in the very
[1:10:43] beginning without him
[1:10:45] that's what he's looking for amen
[1:10:47] and first john 3 8 it says he that
[1:10:49] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:10:52] devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:10:54] this purpose the son of god was
[1:10:56] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:10:59] works of the devil
[1:11:02] so we are what sons and daughters of god
[1:11:04] so what are we supposed to do when we're
[1:11:06] manifested destroy the works of the
[1:11:08] devil in our lives in our family's lives
[1:11:10] we're supposed to be what taking back
[1:11:13] what god had what the devil had taken
[1:11:15] from us amen we're supposed to be
[1:11:17] reading the title d we're supposed to be
[1:11:18] stepping onto our property we're
[1:11:20] supposed to be pushing him out of our
[1:11:22] house by what the power of the holy
[1:11:24] spirit taking the word on its lips and
[1:11:26] moving it out amen amen
[1:11:28] now i want to read you a scripture from
[1:11:30] the old testament but don't look at this
[1:11:32] as an old testament scripture and you'll
[1:11:33] see why we don't look at it that way
[1:11:35] amen because we're stepping into a land
[1:11:37] that we've been promised amen we were in
[1:11:39] a promised land amen that was the first
[1:11:41] church age they were in the promised
[1:11:42] land they were in one accord they were
[1:11:44] all in unity the holy spirit was moving
[1:11:46] amongst men they were moving perfectly
[1:11:48] there were no flaws there were no
[1:11:50] failures they were just doing exactly
[1:11:52] what the holy spirit said and then as
[1:11:53] they started to do what let men take
[1:11:55] control and the holy spirit got pushed
[1:11:57] out then they stepped into denomination
[1:11:59] but we're being restored back to that
[1:12:01] condition but we're moving beyond it
[1:12:03] amen brother brahm says we do not have
[1:12:05] the pentecostal message because we're
[1:12:06] going beyond the original pentecost
[1:12:08] we're going all the way back to eternity
[1:12:10] with what we have now but we're being
[1:12:11] restored to that place of perfect unity
[1:12:14] is what we're talking about they left
[1:12:15] their first love and we're being
[1:12:16] restored back to what the faith of the
[1:12:18] original pentecostal fathers which was
[1:12:20] what a perfect love with him
[1:12:22] but this is in deuteronomy 30 and it
[1:12:24] says in the lord thy god will bring thee
[1:12:26] into a land which thy fathers possessed
[1:12:29] and thou shalt possess it
[1:12:31] and he will do the good and multiply
[1:12:33] thee above thy fathers in other words
[1:12:35] he'll take you further than he took your
[1:12:37] father's
[1:12:38] he'll go further he'll bring more than
[1:12:40] they had
[1:12:41] and that's where we're at isn't it
[1:12:43] because nobody ever has taken a rapture
[1:12:45] as a group you've had one here and one
[1:12:47] there but you never had a whole group a
[1:12:48] whole united body go and take a rapture
[1:12:51] before
[1:12:52] it says and the lord thy god will
[1:12:53] circumcise thine heart
[1:12:56] and the heart i've thy seed to love the
[1:12:58] lord thy god with all thy heart and with
[1:13:01] all thy soul that thou mayest what live
[1:13:05] live by what the whole word of god you
[1:13:07] won't go in and out you won't go back
[1:13:08] and forth you won't be up and down but
[1:13:10] you'll be stable and you'll be in it all
[1:13:12] the time you'll get in and you'll stay
[1:13:14] in and you'll be fruitful in that air in
[1:13:16] that place amen you'll stay with it why
[1:13:18] because it won't just be with you but
[1:13:20] it'll be in you scripture says even to
[1:13:22] the end of the age amen is that not us
[1:13:24] sir perfectly because this remember the
[1:13:26] jews are circumcision of the flesh but
[1:13:29] moses is saying here this is he's going
[1:13:30] to circumcise your heart
[1:13:33] so yes there is a promise to the jews
[1:13:34] there's 144 000 that are going to get
[1:13:36] that but this circumcision of the heart
[1:13:38] that's for the gentiles that's a gentile
[1:13:40] thing primarily and it goes to the jews
[1:13:42] at the very end and paul says it in
[1:13:44] colossians 2 he says for in him dwelleth
[1:13:46] in him christ jesus dwelleth all the
[1:13:48] fullness of the godhead bodily and ye
[1:13:50] are complete in him which is the head of
[1:13:52] all principality and power in whom also
[1:13:55] ye are circumcised with the circumcision
[1:13:58] made without hands in other words a man
[1:14:01] can't do this
[1:14:03] listen william branham can't circumcise
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:07] brother gerald can't circumcise you i
[1:14:08] can't circumcise you this is a
[1:14:10] circumcision that happens on the inward
[1:14:12] part of you and it takes god to do it
[1:14:14] amen it's no man involved inside of it
[1:14:17] in putting off the body of the sins of
[1:14:19] the flesh by the circumcision of christ
[1:14:21] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[1:14:24] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:14:26] of the operation of god who hath raised
[1:14:28] him from the dead so deuteronomy 30
[1:14:31] points us to a circumcision that has
[1:14:32] nothing to do with the jews it's pointed
[1:14:34] to a holy ghost circumcision amen
[1:14:37] now if we go back to deuteronomy it says
[1:14:40] and the lord thy god will put all these
[1:14:42] curses upon thine enemies and on them
[1:14:44] that hate thee which persecuted thee
[1:14:46] you'll see that when he calls 144 000
[1:14:48] out there's judgment on everybody else
[1:14:50] isn't there
[1:14:51] amen but there's judgment on the rest of
[1:14:53] the world right now too
[1:14:54] amen the gentile world is being judged
[1:14:57] it says and thou shalt return and obey
[1:15:00] the voice of the lord
[1:15:02] i will send thee elijah the prophet
[1:15:05] to what turn the hearts of the children
[1:15:08] back to the fathers amen amen amen and
[1:15:12] thou shalt return and obey the voice of
[1:15:14] the lord and do all his commandments
[1:15:16] which i command thee this day
[1:15:19] what is it they'll live it
[1:15:21] they won't just go to the temple once a
[1:15:23] year or for the feast or whatever but
[1:15:25] they'll live it every day amen they'll
[1:15:26] live in his commandments because his
[1:15:28] will is their will his purpose is their
[1:15:30] purpose and his life is their life amen
[1:15:33] and the lord thy god will make thee
[1:15:35] plenteous in every work of thine hand in
[1:15:38] the fruit of thy body and in the fruit
[1:15:40] of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy
[1:15:41] land for good for the lord shall it will
[1:15:44] again rejoice over thee for good as he
[1:15:47] rejoiced over thy fathers
[1:15:49] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
[1:15:51] the lord thy god to keep his
[1:15:53] commandments and his statutes which are
[1:15:55] written in this book of the law and if
[1:15:57] thou turn unto the lord thy god with all
[1:15:59] thine heart and with all thy soul
[1:16:02] for this commandment which i command
[1:16:04] thee this day is not hid him from thee
[1:16:07] neither is it far off
[1:16:08] now listen to this what we're in the
[1:16:10] fullness of times we're at the end of
[1:16:12] the gentile age at the end of the
[1:16:13] gentile dispensation he says this thing
[1:16:15] i'm talking about it's not far away
[1:16:18] now listen this was after they've been
[1:16:19] this is this is a time looking past when
[1:16:22] they take the land and then they'd be
[1:16:23] booted out he says it's not far away
[1:16:25] this is six thousand years five thousand
[1:16:27] years in the future and he says it's not
[1:16:28] far
[1:16:29] but looking at the gentile time now we
[1:16:31] look at this and we say it's here it's
[1:16:34] not far off is it and he says it's not
[1:16:36] in heaven
[1:16:37] that thou should say who shall go up for
[1:16:39] us to heaven and bring it unto us that
[1:16:40] we may hear it and do it so we don't
[1:16:42] have to go up to get it
[1:16:45] he says neither is it beyond the sea
[1:16:46] that thou should say who shall go over
[1:16:49] the sea for us and bring it unto us that
[1:16:50] we may hear it and do it so it's not on
[1:16:52] another continent we don't need to know
[1:16:53] go get another ministry or anything
[1:16:55] everything we have need of he's given us
[1:16:57] right here it says
[1:16:59] we don't have to go up
[1:17:01] an angel has already descended the
[1:17:03] mighty angel has descended he's brought
[1:17:05] it down it's not hid him from us now
[1:17:07] it's open to us what he wants us to do
[1:17:10] and it says here but the word is very
[1:17:13] nigh unto thee
[1:17:14] in thy mouth and in thy heart what that
[1:17:18] you can preach a good sermon
[1:17:20] that you can win an argument
[1:17:22] that thou mayest do it
[1:17:25] that you can live it that you can have
[1:17:27] it come out of you as a life spring as a
[1:17:29] well that people can see that god is in
[1:17:32] you and he has an effect on you amen
[1:17:34] that it's him living it's not i that
[1:17:36] liveth but it's christ that live within
[1:17:38] me that time is not far off but it's
[1:17:41] nigh us it's here right now amen it's
[1:17:43] restoring time
[1:17:46] adam was the son of god walking on the
[1:17:48] earth and what god what he did then
[1:17:50] jesus did when he came back the prophet
[1:17:52] god said to us
[1:17:53] what did he do he had a mandate he had a
[1:17:55] purpose he had a clear scope of work he
[1:17:57] had a direction from god
[1:18:00] and that's what we're looking for each
[1:18:01] and every one of us
[1:18:02] the greatest thing we need i believe is
[1:18:04] clear purpose for each and every one of
[1:18:06] our lives if you know what god wants you
[1:18:08] to do then you can move on in confidence
[1:18:10] and satan can't touch you it's when you
[1:18:12] doubt it's when you don't know it's when
[1:18:13] you're uncertain and we'll get into that
[1:18:15] in a little bit it's when you're
[1:18:16] uncertain that saving has an end in
[1:18:18] there because he tries and gets you
[1:18:19] doing something now that's slightly off
[1:18:21] the word
[1:18:23] somebody told me the other day they said
[1:18:24] the prophet of god said if you fire a
[1:18:26] bullet a little bit off in the beginning
[1:18:27] by the time you get to the end it's way
[1:18:29] off
[1:18:30] all satan's doing is looking to open up
[1:18:32] a little gap
[1:18:33] and five years down the road you'll be
[1:18:34] so far off and wonder how you got there
[1:18:36] it's because he got you off the word
[1:18:37] just that little bit amen
[1:18:41] the third task that god gave them was to
[1:18:43] have dominion over the animals and every
[1:18:45] living thing in other words there was no
[1:18:48] being no form that was of a higher
[1:18:50] position than adam
[1:18:51] nothing came above adam on this earth
[1:18:53] there is no animal no matter how big you
[1:18:55] know they say the the polar bears the
[1:18:57] apex predators the biggest bear nothing
[1:18:59] can kill a polar bear nothing can touch
[1:19:01] a polar bear listen the polar bears
[1:19:03] answered that to adam in that condition
[1:19:05] polar bear didn't have nothing on him
[1:19:06] didn't matter how big strong an elephant
[1:19:08] didn't matter nothing could touch at him
[1:19:10] in that condition he was the apex
[1:19:12] predator but he wasn't a predator
[1:19:14] because he ruled by love and then he
[1:19:15] ruled by love back then he didn't you
[1:19:17] know that word to take dominion says
[1:19:19] that you put it under and you dominate
[1:19:20] and you rule over it but you rule by
[1:19:22] love because that's how god has always
[1:19:24] done today man he had the mind of god he
[1:19:26] had the nature of god that's why he
[1:19:27] couldn't be fooled by the serpent he was
[1:19:29] the firstborn amongst what the humanity
[1:19:31] and so he comes down and he's got that
[1:19:33] perfect mind of god satan can't touch it
[1:19:36] and he's ruling the exact same way that
[1:19:37] god did and that is by love firmly
[1:19:40] but by love
[1:19:42] and then always with with a good
[1:19:43] intention behind it
[1:19:45] and then david wrote of us
[1:19:47] and he said what is man that thou art
[1:19:49] mindful of him
[1:19:50] and the son of man that thou visites him
[1:19:53] david's saying why what does god even
[1:19:55] deal with us
[1:19:57] why does he even talk to us why do we
[1:19:59] even have this relationship with them he
[1:20:01] says for thou has made him a little
[1:20:03] lower than the angels
[1:20:05] but has crowned him with glory and honor
[1:20:07] thou madest him to have dominion over
[1:20:10] the works of thy hands and thou has put
[1:20:12] all things under his feet
[1:20:16] that's your position today church that's
[1:20:18] your position in christ and that's where
[1:20:20] god created us to be that's the top of
[1:20:22] the food chain on this earth and there's
[1:20:24] nothing that ought to be able to stand
[1:20:26] before us
[1:20:27] amen the atoms the the animals didn't
[1:20:29] tell adam what to do
[1:20:32] adam told the animals what to do
[1:20:34] amen the wind didn't didn't have control
[1:20:36] over adam adam had control over the wind
[1:20:38] right adam was the the dominating form
[1:20:42] of life in this entire world amen like i
[1:20:45] said he ruled by love he wasn't there to
[1:20:46] abuse or mishandle the animals but if an
[1:20:48] animal had any inclination to go after
[1:20:50] adam it was going to pay a price
[1:20:52] right he wasn't going to allow that
[1:20:55] brother brahm said it this way he says
[1:20:56] and when he made man in his own image he
[1:20:58] had rule over the beast he led the
[1:21:00] beasts around then like the holy spirit
[1:21:03] is supposed to lead the church today
[1:21:06] that's right
[1:21:09] so remember we're talking about in his
[1:21:10] form and with his mind
[1:21:12] so if adam led them around like the holy
[1:21:15] spirit
[1:21:16] then we ought to be led around in the
[1:21:17] same way amen that the holy spirit is
[1:21:20] supposed to be leading us everyone and
[1:21:22] so when christ came as a redeemer then
[1:21:24] you must you must understand that he
[1:21:26] didn't just redeem our sin sick souls
[1:21:28] amen that's what i have right now but he
[1:21:30] came to redeem us back to our position
[1:21:33] to our inheritance and to our property
[1:21:35] as well because full redemption when you
[1:21:37] look at
[1:21:38] what boaz did with
[1:21:40] ruth amen he didn't just redeem her
[1:21:42] person
[1:21:43] but what did he redeem he redeemed all
[1:21:45] of her land back and with her land came
[1:21:47] her posit her position as well amen so
[1:21:50] we would stop him we'd say well i'm
[1:21:51] satisfied that he saved my soul
[1:21:54] but he didn't come to save our soul he
[1:21:55] came to restore us back to our original
[1:21:57] inheritance he came to restore us back
[1:21:59] to our original position into our
[1:22:00] original place so don't stop there and
[1:22:02] say well he's given me my soul that's
[1:22:04] all that matters no he's got so much
[1:22:06] more for you if you'll just let him open
[1:22:08] it up to you amen amen at calvary we
[1:22:11] started on a path that takes us back to
[1:22:12] our original position and there's
[1:22:14] nothing that can touch you or harm you
[1:22:16] on this earth as we've said in the last
[1:22:17] few services unless god lets you
[1:22:19] god has put a hedge of protection about
[1:22:21] you and he only lets things through to
[1:22:23] train you and to help you grow and
[1:22:25] mature that's the only reason otherwise
[1:22:27] satan has no ability to get into you
[1:22:29] unless you do one thing and what's that
[1:22:31] get out of the word amen you get out of
[1:22:33] the word he has full access to you
[1:22:36] but god still won't let you die
[1:22:38] god there's nothing he can do god still
[1:22:40] can protect you because you're his child
[1:22:42] he's only going to let you go so far
[1:22:44] scripture says that that it's your
[1:22:45] you're chastised when you get out of
[1:22:47] line that's what he does he'll chastise
[1:22:48] you to get you back in under the word
[1:22:50] sometimes he'll let satan do the
[1:22:51] chastising for him doesn't he he lets
[1:22:53] satan get a hold of you so that you'll
[1:22:55] realize hey i'm out of his word i got to
[1:22:56] get back but he'll always bring you back
[1:22:59] right the son and daughter of god will
[1:23:01] always be brought back but if you get
[1:23:02] out that's the only place that satan has
[1:23:04] full access to you potentially right
[1:23:06] amen but if you're in the will of god
[1:23:08] and under the authority god then
[1:23:09] nothing's supposed to stand before you
[1:23:11] nothing that's what he said to joshua
[1:23:13] right
[1:23:14] nothing will stand before you
[1:23:16] as long as you're doing what i've told
[1:23:17] you to do
[1:23:18] amen that's why i said last service that
[1:23:21] anyone preaching that we men the fathers
[1:23:24] the husbands or ministers redeem our
[1:23:25] families to our or our children is off
[1:23:27] the word
[1:23:28] because guess what i'm still in the
[1:23:30] process of redemption i'm not fully
[1:23:32] redeemed yet right my soul is redeemed
[1:23:35] but my body's not redeemed you know how
[1:23:36] i know that because i'm in a battle
[1:23:38] every single day in my fully redeemed
[1:23:40] position i'm not in that amen the earth
[1:23:42] isn't even fully redeemed yet and that's
[1:23:44] my position that's my that's my property
[1:23:46] as well so the earth's not redeemed my
[1:23:48] body's not redeemed the only thing
[1:23:49] that's redeemed is my soul so how can i
[1:23:51] go around redeeming people if i'm not
[1:23:53] fully redeemed i can't do it i'm still
[1:23:55] waiting for the full redemption amen
[1:23:57] jesus said i won't lose a single one
[1:23:59] that's been put into my hands i i won't
[1:24:01] lose a single one of them but we're
[1:24:03] looking to him for redemption not to
[1:24:05] ourselves amen no matter how good our
[1:24:06] pastor is no matter how good our father
[1:24:08] is how full of the holy ghost there they
[1:24:10] can't redeem us
[1:24:11] listen look at the very end this is
[1:24:13] revelations five okay it says and they
[1:24:15] sung a new song saying who's worthy
[1:24:18] thou
[1:24:19] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:24:22] open the seals thereof for who was slain
[1:24:25] thou
[1:24:26] past tense
[1:24:27] and hast past tense redeemed past tense
[1:24:32] air us to god by the blood by thy blood
[1:24:35] out of every kindred tongue people and
[1:24:37] nation so every person that is redeemed
[1:24:40] is redeemed by one person and one thing
[1:24:42] and that is jesus christ and by his
[1:24:43] blood and blood alone and it doesn't
[1:24:45] matter if you come from africa if you
[1:24:47] come from newfoundland if you come from
[1:24:49] the united states or you come from
[1:24:50] timbuktu each and every one of us no
[1:24:53] matter our background is redeemed by one
[1:24:54] man and that is jesus christ alone amen
[1:24:58] i don't see myself in revelations 5 9.
[1:25:00] you know where i see myself revelations
[1:25:03] 10 8.
[1:25:04] once he opens the book that's the
[1:25:06] redemption me reading the title deed is
[1:25:09] not redeeming that's just me taking what
[1:25:11] he gave me now he redeemed me now i give
[1:25:13] it now i'm taking what he said was mine
[1:25:16] that's the only part that a pastor or a
[1:25:18] father or a mother or anybody plays in
[1:25:19] redemption is that we take what he has
[1:25:22] redeemed and we say i'll have that thank
[1:25:24] you lord praise the lord i'll take the
[1:25:25] blessings amen i'll take my position
[1:25:27] i'll take that baptism of the holy
[1:25:29] spirit i'll take the leadership of the
[1:25:31] holy spirit in my life and i'll do what
[1:25:33] i'll destroy the works of the devil
[1:25:34] that's what we do you know the only
[1:25:36] thing the scripture tells us to redeem
[1:25:39] the time
[1:25:40] redeem your time because that's what
[1:25:42] he's given you is he's given you a time
[1:25:44] on earth and he's given you a body to do
[1:25:45] his work redeem the time do what he
[1:25:47] asked you to do amen
[1:25:49] listen to be a redeemer you've got to
[1:25:51] know who's first deemed
[1:25:53] you know it means the deemed to be
[1:25:54] counted worthy or a part of and listen
[1:25:57] we can look and we can see especially in
[1:25:58] the things that have happened over the
[1:25:59] last 10 or 15 years there's people we
[1:26:02] thought were deemed
[1:26:03] and they served the lord for 20 or 30 or
[1:26:05] 40 years and then they walked away
[1:26:08] so how do i know who's in and who's out
[1:26:10] then we saw others that didn't do
[1:26:11] anything for 20 or 30 40 years and then
[1:26:13] they came in and they were beautifully
[1:26:15] saved and they're serving god today hey
[1:26:17] maybe all the way to their grave
[1:26:19] i've got to know who's deemed in order
[1:26:20] to redeem but i don't know who's in and
[1:26:23] who's out so how can i be a redeemer i
[1:26:25] could be trying to redeem somebody
[1:26:26] that's the son of satan
[1:26:28] and i could be putting out somebody
[1:26:29] that's a child of god why because in my
[1:26:32] in my very limited understanding i don't
[1:26:34] have a clue who's who which is why we
[1:26:36] treat everyone the same we treat
[1:26:38] everyone as if they're potentially a son
[1:26:40] or a daughter of god amen
[1:26:42] the requirement for redemption is that
[1:26:43] you're willing
[1:26:45] able and a kinsmen
[1:26:47] and guess what i can be willing and i
[1:26:49] can be a kinsman potentially but you
[1:26:51] know what i'm not
[1:26:52] able
[1:26:54] i can't do it no man was found worthy to
[1:26:56] open the book
[1:26:58] amen neither in heaven below the earth
[1:27:00] on earth nothing and everybody cried
[1:27:02] because of it so why would we put
[1:27:03] ourselves in that position
[1:27:05] this isn't in this church but it's
[1:27:07] running through some ranks that's why
[1:27:08] i'm saying it so if you hear it don't
[1:27:09] believe it amen
[1:27:11] listen the scripture says that not only
[1:27:13] they but ourselves which have the first
[1:27:15] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:27:17] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:27:20] adoption to with the redemption of our
[1:27:22] body we're still waiting for full
[1:27:24] redemption so how can i be a redeemer
[1:27:26] i'm not even fully redeemed myself
[1:27:28] boaz couldn't redeem something if he
[1:27:29] wasn't already fully redeemed if he
[1:27:31] didn't have what he needed he couldn't
[1:27:32] go help somebody else that's right
[1:27:35] if if he didn't have property or money
[1:27:37] then how could he redeem somebody that
[1:27:38] lacked it you got to have what they need
[1:27:40] in order to redeem them
[1:27:42] but we don't have it we're still waiting
[1:27:43] for the fullness of our redemption amen
[1:27:46] if i'm your redeemer i ought to be able
[1:27:47] to restore you completely and i can't i
[1:27:50] can't even restore myself much less you
[1:27:52] it's a work of him not of ours
[1:27:55] i said the only thing we're called to
[1:27:56] redeem when you look in the scriptures
[1:27:58] especially the new testament the only
[1:27:59] thing paul says redeem your time amen
[1:28:02] you know what we don't do that very well
[1:28:03] even half the time
[1:28:05] so don't get me started trying to redeem
[1:28:07] you for some reason amen
[1:28:10] brother brown said this
[1:28:11] all things are possible to them that
[1:28:13] believe
[1:28:14] we've got the untapped resources of god
[1:28:18] at our hands to display god we are sons
[1:28:22] and daughters of god
[1:28:24] when god made man he made him a god he
[1:28:26] gave him a dominion over the earth but
[1:28:28] his fallen estate dropped that but what
[1:28:31] they lost by adam it was restored by
[1:28:35] christ and all we are in now is a time
[1:28:38] right we're in a time of being restored
[1:28:40] back he's redeemed us but he hasn't
[1:28:43] taken full possession yet that's it and
[1:28:45] guess what we haven't taken full
[1:28:46] possession either it's there potentially
[1:28:48] potentially there's nothing that we
[1:28:49] can't do today because what the price
[1:28:51] has been paid
[1:28:52] right seals have been open the book is
[1:28:54] open the word is fully revealed to us
[1:28:56] all we need to do is what to do and how
[1:28:57] to do it amen and that's going to be an
[1:28:59] individual relationship to each and
[1:29:01] every one of us amen
[1:29:03] so god had given adam and eve three
[1:29:04] tasks god put a guiding principle around
[1:29:06] the kingdom and it was the key to their
[1:29:08] stain and their place in their position
[1:29:10] amen they could stay in that perfect
[1:29:11] eden for eternity if they listened to
[1:29:14] what he said
[1:29:15] in genesis 2
[1:29:17] god says this and the lord god commanded
[1:29:19] the man saying of every tree of the
[1:29:20] garden thou mayest freely eat but of the
[1:29:23] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:29:24] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[1:29:26] that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[1:29:28] surely die
[1:29:30] now you'll see here if you look quickly
[1:29:32] at 18 i won't read it just yet but god
[1:29:34] said this to adam
[1:29:36] eve was not yet created in body form
[1:29:39] he said it to adam so the original
[1:29:41] command was was given to adam by god
[1:29:43] directly
[1:29:44] now we don't know maybe what god shared
[1:29:46] it with eve when she was put into a body
[1:29:48] later you know when they were walking in
[1:29:50] the cool of the evening each night and
[1:29:51] these different things and i'm sure adam
[1:29:53] shared it with her because she knew she
[1:29:55] knew god had said it
[1:29:56] but he adam was the one to hear it
[1:29:58] directly from god for the very first
[1:30:00] time and then after that it says in the
[1:30:01] lord god said it's not good that the man
[1:30:03] should be alone i will make of him and
[1:30:05] help meet for him amen
[1:30:08] now i i always think a little bit about
[1:30:10] what they thought about this because
[1:30:11] you've got to realize that in perfect
[1:30:13] love there's no fear like we preached on
[1:30:14] recently right there's no fear so god
[1:30:16] says the day you eat there after you'll
[1:30:18] surely die and they're probably saying
[1:30:20] what is dying
[1:30:22] because die is an end die is a
[1:30:23] separation from god it's an end of
[1:30:25] fellowship and they can't even
[1:30:26] comprehend that because perfect love
[1:30:28] casts that out there's not even a
[1:30:29] comprehension of what this means to die
[1:30:32] they can't even grasp the idea of not
[1:30:34] having god in their life so in a way
[1:30:37] it's an empty threat to them because
[1:30:38] they don't comprehend it but yet god has
[1:30:41] said it and however something bad can
[1:30:43] exist in perfect love they understood
[1:30:45] don't do this because something's going
[1:30:47] to happen that you won't like
[1:30:49] right something's going to happen that
[1:30:51] you don't like
[1:30:52] and we know that adam took that because
[1:30:54] he couldn't be corrupted by the serpent
[1:30:55] and brother brahm says it many times the
[1:30:57] serpent couldn't get to adam
[1:30:59] as a direct son of god as a part of the
[1:31:01] original creation he couldn't get to
[1:31:02] adam so he had to go after eve right
[1:31:05] why because adam had a direct line to
[1:31:08] god he heard it from god he knew his
[1:31:10] purpose he knew his place and adam knew
[1:31:12] that he was in a position of dominion
[1:31:15] that's the first thing that eve messed
[1:31:16] up on was she started letting something
[1:31:18] that was under her dominion speak to her
[1:31:21] as an equal
[1:31:23] listen if a pair came up to me and said
[1:31:25] did god really say you can't eat the
[1:31:26] fruit of that tree what would i say
[1:31:28] go back to eating birdseed
[1:31:30] that wasn't for you it was for me so
[1:31:33] what do you care
[1:31:35] and yet people will come up to us and
[1:31:36] they'll challenge us on what we believe
[1:31:38] and they'll say you don't really believe
[1:31:39] that a woman shouldn't cut her hair and
[1:31:41] you don't really think that god means in
[1:31:43] this day and age that you have to wear
[1:31:44] dresses you sisters
[1:31:46] and your brothers that you shouldn't go
[1:31:48] around and have all these worldly
[1:31:49] hairstyles and
[1:31:51] are you serious do you think that's what
[1:31:52] god really cares about god looks at the
[1:31:54] heart man why why would you why would
[1:31:56] you take on these laws to yourself
[1:31:58] what is it
[1:32:00] it's not for them
[1:32:01] i'm not saying they're under our
[1:32:02] dominion but i'm saying they don't have
[1:32:04] a nature in them like we do they don't
[1:32:06] have a call in their life they don't
[1:32:08] have a sea gene of god and so they're
[1:32:10] speaking from total ignorance i saw
[1:32:12] somebody post something the other day in
[1:32:13] a a
[1:32:15] a person i know commented on it and they
[1:32:17] said that god had absolutely uh put
[1:32:19] abortion in the bible as something that
[1:32:20] was okay
[1:32:22] and they put down scriptures that had
[1:32:23] nothing to do with it and they
[1:32:24] completely misinterpreted why because
[1:32:26] they don't have a clue what the
[1:32:27] scriptures mean they probably went to
[1:32:28] some site by another unbeliever that
[1:32:30] looked up things in the bible and said
[1:32:31] this is what it means and then they
[1:32:32] copied it and they put it down and now
[1:32:34] they believe that god thinks abortion is
[1:32:35] okay
[1:32:37] because what somebody that has no
[1:32:38] relationship with god went into the
[1:32:39] bible and misinterpreted something right
[1:32:42] so if a parent comes up to me and starts
[1:32:43] trying to talk about the word i'm not
[1:32:44] going to say much to the parent am i i'm
[1:32:46] going to say parrot go back to the bird
[1:32:47] cage it's not for you but yet a serpent
[1:32:50] comes to eve
[1:32:51] a serpent that is under her dominion
[1:32:54] that is under her foot that is not on an
[1:32:57] equal plane comes up and starts trying
[1:32:58] to discuss the word with her
[1:33:00] and what does she do
[1:33:02] she listens
[1:33:03] she doesn't take dominion over it
[1:33:06] she says
[1:33:07] let's engage in a conversation
[1:33:09] right
[1:33:10] now listen we're trying to have the mind
[1:33:12] of christ and adam and eve were given it
[1:33:14] but it only got corrupted and eve and
[1:33:16] i'm not picking on the women because
[1:33:17] guess what each and every one of us fits
[1:33:19] into this because we are the woman type
[1:33:21] we are the bride of christ so men and
[1:33:23] women both included are are here amen
[1:33:26] the men didn't do anything you know
[1:33:27] we're not anything great and the woman
[1:33:28] are horrible right we're all in a fallen
[1:33:31] condition
[1:33:32] okay
[1:33:34] but listen what the prophet of god says
[1:33:36] watch the corruption of the woman's mind
[1:33:38] he says in the beginning it started off
[1:33:40] like this it's the way we've got it
[1:33:41] right today and it hasn't changed a bit
[1:33:44] adam was a believer
[1:33:46] satan was an unbeliever he did not
[1:33:48] believe the word so he got eve who was
[1:33:51] not sure whether it was right or not
[1:33:55] see satan the unbeliever god said the
[1:33:57] day you eat thereof the day you die
[1:33:59] satan said that's not right see and he
[1:34:01] didn't believe it and adam did believe
[1:34:03] it so he worked on the one that was in
[1:34:06] between
[1:34:07] she just couldn't tell
[1:34:09] she wasn't convinced one way or another
[1:34:11] now i want you to recognize something
[1:34:13] because apparently she never discussed
[1:34:15] this with adam
[1:34:18] right she got out
[1:34:20] from what
[1:34:22] her place with her husband he had
[1:34:24] unified her and adam
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:27] she didn't even have a name there she
[1:34:28] was adam same as he was adam that was
[1:34:31] one unity and she got away from her
[1:34:33] unity and started having fellowship with
[1:34:36] something that was outside of her
[1:34:37] species and was outside of her nature
[1:34:40] right
[1:34:41] and guess what when god came down in the
[1:34:43] evening she never said hey god got this
[1:34:46] weird conversation happening with that
[1:34:48] serpent guy
[1:34:49] what do i do
[1:34:51] what did she do she started hiding her
[1:34:53] relationship from her husband and her
[1:34:56] god you think god didn't know of course
[1:34:58] he knew
[1:34:59] right but adam apparently didn't know
[1:35:02] and she hid what she was doing from her
[1:35:05] what
[1:35:06] her god
[1:35:09] if we have to hide it it's wrong
[1:35:11] it's very simple if i have to hide
[1:35:13] something i'm doing for my wife guess
[1:35:15] what it ain't right
[1:35:17] i don't care what i can say about it or
[1:35:18] what i can do about it or how harmless i
[1:35:20] say it is if i can't share that with my
[1:35:22] spouse it's wrong
[1:35:23] flat out
[1:35:24] had a man say one time is his wife went
[1:35:26] to take his phone and and uh and he said
[1:35:29] no you can't look at that
[1:35:31] and he said to another person that i
[1:35:32] know he says right
[1:35:34] and the other person said no she
[1:35:36] definitely can look at your phone she's
[1:35:38] your wife there shouldn't be anything on
[1:35:39] there that she couldn't see he says no
[1:35:41] no it's my phone guess what there was
[1:35:43] something he was hiding from his wife on
[1:35:45] that phone
[1:35:46] guaranteed because why else would you
[1:35:47] care
[1:35:48] right half the time with black i'll say
[1:35:50] will you pick that up or can you find
[1:35:51] this or whatever you know we don't care
[1:35:53] why we all have the same passwords
[1:35:55] there's nothing hidden why because we're
[1:35:57] not trying to hide there's nothing going
[1:35:58] on that the other person can't know
[1:35:59] about but we see here the first thing
[1:36:01] she did was she hid the conversation
[1:36:03] from her husband
[1:36:06] right
[1:36:07] so satan focuses on those that he
[1:36:09] perceives as weak now listen he's going
[1:36:10] to try everyone
[1:36:12] not one of us is going to get away from
[1:36:13] satan probing to try and get us to have
[1:36:15] the conversation right
[1:36:16] but once you have the conversation he
[1:36:18] knows there's a weakness there and then
[1:36:19] he'll start going he'll start trying to
[1:36:21] continue with that
[1:36:22] in the garden of eden satan come along
[1:36:24] and said to eve he said you should take
[1:36:26] the fruit of the tree she said but the
[1:36:28] lord said not he says oh now surely
[1:36:30] you'll not die see he knowed as long as
[1:36:32] people stayed fortified he says this is
[1:36:35] what we're supposed to stay fortified by
[1:36:37] is the word
[1:36:38] now i want to stop here and say
[1:36:40] something because last service i read a
[1:36:41] quote where brother brown said we're all
[1:36:43] individuals we're all made different we
[1:36:46] shouldn't try and take anybody's place
[1:36:47] do you remember that
[1:36:49] but then he says one thing he says but
[1:36:51] we're all guarded by the word
[1:36:54] so with all of the differences we have
[1:36:56] in here
[1:36:57] race color language gender skills
[1:37:00] strengths weaknesses he says but we're
[1:37:03] all guarded by the word in other words
[1:37:04] we're all supposed to be guarded by the
[1:37:06] word and we're all supposed to stay in
[1:37:08] the word regardless of what we have as a
[1:37:10] strength or a weakness so just because
[1:37:12] you're not weak in an area doesn't mean
[1:37:14] you should go out and dabble
[1:37:16] right you want if the word says don't do
[1:37:17] it you don't do it no matter how strong
[1:37:19] you are
[1:37:20] right you want to stay under the word
[1:37:22] you want to stay guarded by the word
[1:37:24] amen don't think that something doesn't
[1:37:25] apply to you just because you're strong
[1:37:28] because guess what you get out from
[1:37:29] under the word you'll never stand you'll
[1:37:31] never stand because there's no
[1:37:33] protection out there you're going to
[1:37:34] fall back to what the arm of flesh and
[1:37:36] the arm of flesh will always fail you
[1:37:38] right
[1:37:39] listen
[1:37:40] always god when god provides he provides
[1:37:43] the best do you believe that this
[1:37:45] morning do you believe he's given you
[1:37:47] the best
[1:37:48] so will you use it will you stay there
[1:37:51] will you stay there then if you believe
[1:37:53] it's the best then will you stay there
[1:37:55] and will you use only what he gives you
[1:37:57] when god provided a way to fortify his
[1:37:59] church he provided the best when he gave
[1:38:01] adam and eve in the garden of eden what
[1:38:03] he gave them was his word you stay
[1:38:05] behind this word and you're safe but if
[1:38:07] you get from out of it the day you eat
[1:38:10] thereof is the day you die he says god
[1:38:12] has never changed his strategy
[1:38:15] and what do we see today we see people
[1:38:17] changing strategy and they add in what
[1:38:19] psychology and they add in politics and
[1:38:21] they add in influence and they add in
[1:38:23] money and they add in this and that and
[1:38:25] the other thing what have they done
[1:38:27] they've changed the word of god into
[1:38:28] what something without power because you
[1:38:31] can't give it everything
[1:38:32] you're trying to pull back to yourself
[1:38:34] he says and satan so god never changed
[1:38:36] his strategy and satan has never changed
[1:38:38] his how he got into adam and eve he gets
[1:38:41] them today why by trying to reason it
[1:38:44] out now it's reasonable that god would
[1:38:46] not oh god has said said satan but
[1:38:49] surely a holy god won't do this brother
[1:38:51] brahm says surely he will
[1:38:54] why because he said he would god doesn't
[1:38:58] god is not a man that he should lie the
[1:39:00] scripture says
[1:39:01] right there's no shadow or variableness
[1:39:03] of turning right he does not change he
[1:39:05] doesn't do things one and make sure that
[1:39:07] your testimony matches the words that
[1:39:09] you were trying to convince them with
[1:39:10] amen but after two times he says just
[1:39:13] walk away
[1:39:14] because what you're just going to keep
[1:39:15] more judgment on them
[1:39:16] right that's all you're going to do and
[1:39:18] you're going to cause more disagreement
[1:39:20] so he says just do it remember what he
[1:39:21] said to the disciples he says if you go
[1:39:23] to a town and they don't accept you what
[1:39:25] do you do or you go to a home he says
[1:39:26] you walk out you wipe the dust from that
[1:39:28] home off your off your feet and you walk
[1:39:30] and you don't look back
[1:39:32] why there wasn't anything there to
[1:39:33] receive it
[1:39:34] guess what the the the children of god
[1:39:36] are always in the minority we're not
[1:39:38] going to have a big church we're not
[1:39:39] going to have massive groups none of
[1:39:41] these things remember brother branham
[1:39:42] talked about billy graham he says they
[1:39:44] go there and you get ten thousand you
[1:39:45] come back and you might have ten
[1:39:47] right that's the world right
[1:39:50] that's what we're looking at these days
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:53] but eve got into trouble when she
[1:39:55] started conversing with a bean that was
[1:39:56] under her dominion
[1:39:58] amen
[1:39:59] that was not at an equal playing field
[1:40:01] with her that was not of the same
[1:40:03] lineage or nature that was not of the
[1:40:04] same bloodline amen she started to have
[1:40:06] that conversation and what drew her to
[1:40:08] having that conversation
[1:40:11] curiosity
[1:40:13] wonder
[1:40:14] how do i make this happen
[1:40:16] i'm supposed to be fruitful and
[1:40:18] multiplying and it ain't happening
[1:40:20] this guy's telling me a way to do it
[1:40:22] i'm interested
[1:40:24] stick with the word
[1:40:26] that's what she was supposed to do amen
[1:40:28] listen have you got friends or
[1:40:29] acquaintances and they want to challenge
[1:40:30] your belief of the word of god what do
[1:40:31] you do
[1:40:33] once or twice and then you walk away
[1:40:36] amen remember we covered that in the
[1:40:37] services before that if if they don't if
[1:40:40] they can't take the the brief amount
[1:40:43] that you do and that's all it's supposed
[1:40:44] to be your personal testimony you can
[1:40:47] cover some basics i believe every
[1:40:49] believer should be able to say
[1:40:50] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:40:52] christ and receive the holy ghost we
[1:40:54] ought to be able to tell somebody how to
[1:40:55] get saved beyond that brother brahm says
[1:40:57] what do you do you point him to a
[1:40:58] minister of the gospel he says because
[1:41:00] it's hard enough for them to keep it
[1:41:01] straight much less you and guess what if
[1:41:03] somebody really wants the truth they'll
[1:41:04] go talk to a minister
[1:41:06] right but if they want to win an
[1:41:07] argument they won't
[1:41:09] because you're good for an argument the
[1:41:11] minister won't handle that he'll say
[1:41:13] listen you want to argue go ahead i'll
[1:41:14] i'll answer your questions but i'm not
[1:41:16] here to argue with you and neither are
[1:41:17] we supposed to do the same thing amen
[1:41:21] second corinthians 6 says be ye not
[1:41:23] unequally yoked together with
[1:41:24] unbelievers for what fellowship has
[1:41:27] righteousness with unrighteousness
[1:41:28] listen when that serpent first started
[1:41:30] talking to eve she should have said whoa
[1:41:32] this is not a conversation that i should
[1:41:35] be having
[1:41:36] this is not a place i should be this is
[1:41:38] not a person i should be around and she
[1:41:40] should have just walked away what the
[1:41:42] prophet of god say when satan knocks at
[1:41:44] your door
[1:41:45] what don't even open the door
[1:41:47] and if he approaches you outside of your
[1:41:49] home what do you do walk away
[1:41:51] just walk away don't even start the
[1:41:53] conversation she didn't do it
[1:41:55] and what communion had light with
[1:41:57] darkness
[1:41:59] that includes marriage obviously that's
[1:42:00] the first thing we look at this but it
[1:42:02] includes friendship and fellowship
[1:42:04] right
[1:42:04] somebody that has the right spirit that
[1:42:06] maybe hasn't come as far as you they're
[1:42:08] gonna be okay for a while
[1:42:10] right because they're sir maybe they're
[1:42:11] searching for more they're seeking for
[1:42:13] more but somebody that has made up their
[1:42:14] mind you're never going to get anywhere
[1:42:16] with them and guess what you're going to
[1:42:18] get dragged down they're not going to be
[1:42:19] lifted up
[1:42:21] why because it takes the holy spirit to
[1:42:22] lift somebody up
[1:42:24] right but it doesn't take the holy
[1:42:25] spirit to drag somebody down
[1:42:26] right
[1:42:29] and what concord hath christ with belial
[1:42:32] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:42:34] an infidel
[1:42:35] and what agreement had the temple of god
[1:42:37] with idols for ye are the temple of the
[1:42:39] living god as god had said i will dwell
[1:42:42] in them and walk in them and i will be
[1:42:44] their god and they shall be my people
[1:42:47] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:42:49] be separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:42:52] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[1:42:54] and will be a father unto you and you
[1:42:56] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:42:58] lord god almighty the prophet preached
[1:43:01] that sermon god's word calls for a total
[1:43:03] separation from unbelief amen a total
[1:43:06] separation he says if one word got us
[1:43:08] out nothing less than the full word will
[1:43:10] bring us back amen he's looking for
[1:43:12] people that will stay there amen don't
[1:43:14] fellowship with unbelief occasionally
[1:43:17] occasional is going to hurt you it's not
[1:43:19] going to help them don't fellowship
[1:43:21] you can meet with people listen we just
[1:43:23] spend time with family down in
[1:43:24] california most of them unbelievers
[1:43:26] guess what that's okay you've got to be
[1:43:28] able to to deal with that but you don't
[1:43:30] fellowship you don't create friendships
[1:43:32] with unbelief why
[1:43:33] because if they don't accept your
[1:43:35] testimony and your word up front
[1:43:37] then guess what the one that's coming
[1:43:38] down is you they're not coming up right
[1:43:40] that's what paul says listen you can do
[1:43:42] it for a short amount but then walk away
[1:43:44] because it's not going to do them any
[1:43:45] good and it's definitely not going to do
[1:43:46] you right you don't have to challenge
[1:43:48] yourself with facing up to unbelief
[1:43:50] satan will do that right for you satan
[1:43:52] will bring unbelief to your door you
[1:43:53] don't have to go looking for satan for
[1:43:54] that sort of a thing amen
[1:43:56] eve lost eternal life dominion and
[1:43:58] fellowship with god as soon as she got
[1:44:00] out from under that word and acted on
[1:44:02] that unbelief because remember what
[1:44:03] brother brown said sin is he says
[1:44:05] unbelief he says the act is just a
[1:44:06] symptom of the unbelief that you had in
[1:44:08] the first place and she disbelieved and
[1:44:10] then that caused her to act and it
[1:44:11] pulled her out from her position amen
[1:44:14] listen paul said it to this way and he's
[1:44:15] talking now to us
[1:44:17] the gentiles he says for i am jealous
[1:44:19] over you with godly jealousy for i have
[1:44:22] espoused you to one husband
[1:44:24] he's engaged us to one husband christ
[1:44:27] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:44:29] virgin to christ you know what that word
[1:44:30] chaste means means it hasn't played
[1:44:32] around with other men hasn't flirted
[1:44:34] around with other men hasn't dabbled
[1:44:36] with other men hasn't tried other
[1:44:38] relationships before we come to this he
[1:44:40] says what she stayed clean and true to
[1:44:42] him all the way through
[1:44:44] that's why we don't dabble in those
[1:44:45] things
[1:44:46] he says but i fear
[1:44:48] lest by any means as a serpent beguiled
[1:44:51] eve through his subtlety that where
[1:44:53] beguile is it implies seduction
[1:44:56] charming into deception
[1:44:59] so it's not going to be obvious what's
[1:45:00] being offered up front
[1:45:02] when you when you see you know when they
[1:45:04] talk about seduction when it when a man
[1:45:06] or a woman cheats on their spouse or
[1:45:07] something like that it is never obvious
[1:45:09] up front what they're looking for and a
[1:45:11] lot of times what they're looking for
[1:45:13] and what they get are two very different
[1:45:14] things
[1:45:15] they're seduced into thinking that
[1:45:16] something's going to be supplied or
[1:45:18] offered and what they get in the end is
[1:45:19] used
[1:45:21] right because that's what a seducer does
[1:45:23] is he uses you by offering you what you
[1:45:25] think you want
[1:45:26] but he thinks you think you're he's
[1:45:28] going to give you what you want but you
[1:45:29] don't get that you get what he wants
[1:45:32] and that's never good for you
[1:45:34] right
[1:45:35] i fear by lest any means as a serpent
[1:45:37] beguiled or seduced eve through his
[1:45:39] subtlety so your mind should be
[1:45:41] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:45:44] christ
[1:45:45] the word simple
[1:45:47] the word is simple the scripture says in
[1:45:48] isaiah 35 and then highway shall be
[1:45:51] there and away and it shall be called
[1:45:53] the way of holiness the unclean shall
[1:45:55] now pass over it but it shall be for
[1:45:57] those the wayfaring men though fools
[1:46:00] shall not air therein listen it's not
[1:46:02] rocket science
[1:46:04] it's not rocket science hattie wright
[1:46:06] wasn't a rocket scientist
[1:46:08] but she said that ain't nothing but the
[1:46:10] truth and she got the salvation of her
[1:46:12] two sons
[1:46:13] and then it's not rocket science but it
[1:46:15] is a heart that looks at that and says
[1:46:17] that applies to me
[1:46:19] now here's the thing
[1:46:21] and i'm going to give a personal
[1:46:22] negative testimony here in a moment we
[1:46:24] accept the word simplicity when it's
[1:46:26] easy
[1:46:27] or when it agrees with our situation
[1:46:31] humanly speaking
[1:46:33] when it's easy or when it agrees with
[1:46:35] our situation we love to stand behind
[1:46:37] the word and we love to take the word
[1:46:38] and say yes i'm standing there
[1:46:40] but the minute
[1:46:42] it starts to hit our wallets it starts
[1:46:44] to hit our careers it starts to hit our
[1:46:46] families it starts to hit our finances
[1:46:48] then what do we do we start to sit there
[1:46:50] and we start to wrangle it to see if we
[1:46:51] can find a way to make it somehow easier
[1:46:53] for us or fit our
[1:46:55] our situation or fit the decision that
[1:46:58] we want to make
[1:47:00] is that just me or is
[1:47:02] okay i'm going to tell you a story when
[1:47:03] we were in california we had to rent a
[1:47:05] vehicle to go to mexico
[1:47:07] okay now through a very long story that
[1:47:09] i'm not going to share but suffice to
[1:47:10] say we weren't planning to do it
[1:47:13] and it was a huge unexpected expense it
[1:47:14] was over twelve hundred dollars for us
[1:47:16] to rent this this this vehicle to go
[1:47:18] down there now the beautiful thing was
[1:47:19] this is that i had personal insurance
[1:47:22] through my vehicle insurance and then i
[1:47:24] had double coverage because my credit
[1:47:26] card gives me coverage as well so i had
[1:47:28] double insurance on this vehicle so that
[1:47:30] i wouldn't have to pay the insurance
[1:47:31] coverage fees which can be fairly high
[1:47:34] so we walk in there we've already made
[1:47:35] the reservation we walk in and right on
[1:47:38] the wall is the word for avis
[1:47:41] and it says
[1:47:42] if you take this vehicle into mexico
[1:47:46] which is what we were going to do
[1:47:48] you must buy our special insurance for
[1:47:50] mexican travel
[1:47:52] now that's black and white isn't it
[1:47:54] that's black and white there's there's
[1:47:55] no there's no uh you know optional ways
[1:47:58] to get out of that it says if you're
[1:48:00] going to take this to mexico
[1:48:02] you have to get our special insurance
[1:48:03] for mexico
[1:48:05] okay
[1:48:05] does anybody disagree that there's any
[1:48:07] black that there's any any way of
[1:48:09] getting around that if you take this
[1:48:10] vehicle and you take it to mexico you
[1:48:12] got to buy our insurance
[1:48:13] but you know what i sat there and tried
[1:48:16] 17 ways past sunday to make that say
[1:48:19] if you have double coverage you don't
[1:48:21] have to pay 60 for insurance a day
[1:48:25] that's what i did
[1:48:26] because i'm thinking in my head there's
[1:48:28] no damage to them if i lose the vehicle
[1:48:30] because i've got double coverage on it
[1:48:31] if it gets damaged i've got double
[1:48:33] coverage no matter what happens to that
[1:48:35] vehicle i've got it covered so it
[1:48:36] shouldn't matter whether or not i get
[1:48:38] their insurance
[1:48:39] but guess what the minute i took their
[1:48:41] vehicle i was agreeing to their terms
[1:48:44] right so what does that mean i got to
[1:48:47] get their insurance doesn't it
[1:48:49] and guess what i walked away without
[1:48:51] getting their insurance
[1:48:53] and everybody's faith and brother
[1:48:54] jonathan fell
[1:48:56] but before i got that vehicle i walked
[1:48:58] right back down and said i'm sorry i'm
[1:49:00] going to mexico i should have told you i
[1:49:03] need coverage for a week and that cost
[1:49:04] me an extra 400 bucks
[1:49:06] so our rental cost was almost 1700 that
[1:49:08] we hadn't planned you think i wanted to
[1:49:10] spend that money
[1:49:11] but guess what the holy spirit won't let
[1:49:13] a child of god do something like that
[1:49:16] now what was it i was trying to wrangle
[1:49:18] in my mind because i didn't want to have
[1:49:20] to spend an additional 400 odd dollars
[1:49:23] on something that i was already spending
[1:49:25] too much money for what was i doing i
[1:49:27] was trying to make that word turn into
[1:49:29] what i wanted it to mean and what did i
[1:49:31] say it'll never hurt them they'll never
[1:49:33] know
[1:49:34] right
[1:49:35] i was trying to make it work for me not
[1:49:37] for them
[1:49:39] but as soon as i took that vehicle i was
[1:49:41] saying i'm i'm going to abide by your
[1:49:42] rules for this vehicle so i was bound to
[1:49:44] do it and i did it
[1:49:46] by god's grace and i asked him to
[1:49:47] forgive me for even walking away the
[1:49:48] first time because i should have said it
[1:49:49] up front
[1:49:51] but we're sitting there and i'm stewing
[1:49:52] because it's late and they've been long
[1:49:53] and dead to death and then even more
[1:49:55] money and i'm like are you kidding me
[1:49:57] what and i let the situation overcome me
[1:49:59] to where i said their word doesn't apply
[1:50:01] to me
[1:50:02] and i was wrong
[1:50:04] i was wrong but we do the same thing and
[1:50:06] let me tell you this the minute you sit
[1:50:08] in your mind and you try and wrangle
[1:50:10] with what the word says i'll tell you
[1:50:11] right now you're wrong
[1:50:13] because the word brings rest
[1:50:15] and it brings clarity and if you got to
[1:50:18] sit there and wrangle is this right or
[1:50:19] wrong what did brother braham say if
[1:50:20] there's a question
[1:50:23] don't
[1:50:24] don't try and argue yourself into saying
[1:50:27] that the word allows me to do it he says
[1:50:28] if there's any question don't you have
[1:50:30] brothers right in and say brother
[1:50:31] branham can i do this or can i do that
[1:50:32] he says if you're asking then don't
[1:50:35] because something in you if you've got
[1:50:37] the holy ghost is saying don't do it so
[1:50:39] don't even try and find a way through
[1:50:41] just stay away from it amen amen
[1:50:43] amen that's my testimony for the week
[1:50:45] don't be like don't be like me in that
[1:50:47] situation right
[1:50:49] right don't try and wrangle the word to
[1:50:51] suit your situation amen
[1:50:54] what is it a christian is held
[1:50:55] accountable to the word in every aspect
[1:50:57] of their life a true son a true daughter
[1:50:59] of god is going to be held accountable
[1:51:01] and i don't know if something would have
[1:51:02] happened maybe if i'd have taken that
[1:51:03] vehicle down there under my insurance
[1:51:05] maybe nothing would have happened and
[1:51:06] all i would have to do deal with is is a
[1:51:08] conscience that would have bothered me
[1:51:09] the whole time and i wouldn't have
[1:51:10] enjoyed a single day and that would have
[1:51:12] been my payment
[1:51:13] right that might have been my price
[1:51:16] but maybe it would have got stolen or
[1:51:18] wrecked
[1:51:19] and something would have happened and i
[1:51:20] would have been denied coverage and all
[1:51:22] of a sudden i got to buy a 50 000 suv
[1:51:25] right
[1:51:26] i wasn't willing to do that because god
[1:51:28] chastises his sons when they get out of
[1:51:31] line
[1:51:32] i'd rather pay the money than get
[1:51:33] chastised
[1:51:35] i'd rather do it the first time next
[1:51:36] time maybe amen
[1:51:38] listen we read this quote we started
[1:51:40] this quote and i wanted to finish it
[1:51:41] earlier
[1:51:42] he says see we are surrounded by the
[1:51:45] word
[1:51:46] the word is in you god in you around you
[1:51:49] wherever you go it's the word the word
[1:51:52] keep him always before you
[1:51:54] remember be conscious of him
[1:51:57] everywhere
[1:51:59] listen i knew what i was supposed to do
[1:52:00] in that situation i was conscious
[1:52:03] of what i was supposed to do and what
[1:52:04] did i do i ignored it
[1:52:07] don't do that
[1:52:08] he says be conscious of him always
[1:52:11] around you
[1:52:12] now when adam and eve walk like that
[1:52:14] there was no death
[1:52:16] the man or the woman that walks like
[1:52:18] that now there is no death to them
[1:52:21] they've got eternal life when you're
[1:52:23] surrounded and kept by the word
[1:52:28] it's the only place of refuge we have
[1:52:30] it's the only place we know we're safe
[1:52:32] is when we're in the word
[1:52:34] because if you're in the word then
[1:52:35] nothing can come against it nothing can
[1:52:37] stand before it amen
[1:52:38] what you've lost christ is redeemed back
[1:52:40] to us amen we don't have it all now but
[1:52:43] he's redeemed it and he's restoring us
[1:52:45] back to it he's restoring it back to us
[1:52:47] even as we could say it amen we have
[1:52:49] eternal life and we have fellowship with
[1:52:51] him guess what there is no barrier
[1:52:52] between god and i know you know the only
[1:52:54] barrier
[1:52:55] this
[1:52:56] this flesh that's the only barrier but
[1:52:59] it doesn't have to stop me
[1:53:01] just means i might have to fight through
[1:53:03] not i might i do right i have to fight
[1:53:05] through i've got to put the time in i've
[1:53:06] got to put the effort in i've got to get
[1:53:08] past the distractions i've got to redeem
[1:53:10] my time but that's the only thing that
[1:53:12] holds me back from fellowship is this
[1:53:13] stinking flesh right here
[1:53:14] right because the soul has a clear
[1:53:16] connection
[1:53:17] because it's the same thing that his is
[1:53:19] right so holy spirit gives us a clear
[1:53:21] direction between those amen
[1:53:23] brother brown says notice he separated
[1:53:25] even adam and she fell
[1:53:27] adam went with her now adam was not
[1:53:30] deceived eve was deceived but adam the
[1:53:32] first adam was god's son also and he
[1:53:34] went out because of the love of eve to
[1:53:37] try to bring her back because he loved
[1:53:38] her christ did the same thing to redeem
[1:53:41] her back
[1:53:42] what the bride amen
[1:53:45] what to
[1:53:46] redeem her back to the word what caused
[1:53:49] the fall the word disbelieving the word
[1:53:52] disbelieving all the word
[1:53:54] and christ come now listen to this
[1:53:57] christ come that he might become one of
[1:53:59] us
[1:53:59] his life in us to continue the word amen
[1:54:04] oh you're saying brother jonathan who
[1:54:06] didn't stop with but with jesus didn't
[1:54:08] stop with paul it didn't stop with the
[1:54:10] apostles didn't stop with brother
[1:54:12] branham absolutely not he says he came
[1:54:14] down and came one of us with his life in
[1:54:17] us to continue the word the unveiling of
[1:54:21] the word the manifestation of the word
[1:54:23] the revealing of the word all the way
[1:54:25] through to eternity we said last time
[1:54:27] brother branham said it
[1:54:29] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:54:30] was with god the word was god and the
[1:54:32] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:54:35] the same yesterday today forever he
[1:54:37] takes us back to hebrews 13 8.
[1:54:39] and he ties in what that the word was
[1:54:41] with us and the word was in us and then
[1:54:43] he says he's in us again today
[1:54:45] and hebrews 13 7 says what look at the
[1:54:47] men around you and if they have the life
[1:54:49] of christ then follow them
[1:54:52] if they have the life of what jesus
[1:54:54] christ is saying yesterday today forever
[1:54:56] that was the qualifications of the
[1:54:57] ministry to have a life like christ's
[1:55:00] we ought to have the same thing today
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:04] the prophet of god pointed us away back
[1:55:05] to the restoration of our minds to the
[1:55:07] form of god in a bride as eve was in the
[1:55:10] form of adam
[1:55:12] right it's the same thing he says and
[1:55:13] she can be the bride of christ
[1:55:16] you can be the bride of christ not you
[1:55:17] can be you are the bride of christ and
[1:55:20] remember she being a part of a man the
[1:55:22] bible said nevertheless i suffer not a
[1:55:25] woman to teach or to usurp any authority
[1:55:27] but be in silence for adam was first
[1:55:29] form and then eve and adam was not
[1:55:31] deceived but the byproduct was deceived
[1:55:33] notwithstanding she shall be saved as
[1:55:35] she continues in holiness and sobriety
[1:55:38] and in childbearing and all such because
[1:55:40] then she becomes a part of this man
[1:55:44] now we could easily get offended by that
[1:55:46] as women today
[1:55:48] if we're looking at our natural husbands
[1:55:50] but brother branham says that was a type
[1:55:53] of christ and the bride and the bride is
[1:55:55] saved what if she is united with a man
[1:55:59] and continues in holiness and sobriety
[1:56:01] and childbearing and such in other words
[1:56:03] if she takes the life of her husband
[1:56:05] inside of her and it produces something
[1:56:08] that is visible to the rest of the world
[1:56:10] if she continues in it not just once not
[1:56:13] just one day not just one week not just
[1:56:15] one year of faithfulness but if she
[1:56:16] continues in her relationship with the
[1:56:19] word of life then she's saved amen
[1:56:23] he says why didn't god kill sarah
[1:56:26] sitting right there denying and lying
[1:56:28] right in the face of god sitting there
[1:56:30] as a mortal man eating flesh eating
[1:56:31] bread drinking milk and he said why did
[1:56:33] sarah laugh back there in the back
[1:56:35] behind him in the tent he had never seen
[1:56:37] her saying this how can these things be
[1:56:40] she said well i never said it oh my
[1:56:43] tell god that he's a liar to his face
[1:56:46] but he couldn't take her why she's a
[1:56:49] part of abraham amen he couldn't hurt
[1:56:51] her without hurting abraham
[1:56:54] so what's he saying he's saying church
[1:56:57] sometimes we call him a liar to his face
[1:56:59] sometimes we say how can it be in this
[1:57:01] flesh
[1:57:02] how can it be in my family how can it be
[1:57:05] in this fallen condition
[1:57:07] and he says you ought to be judged you
[1:57:09] ought to be killed for your unbelief but
[1:57:11] because you're a part of christ because
[1:57:13] you continue in your relationship with
[1:57:15] christ because you're true to him he
[1:57:17] can't kill you because you are a part of
[1:57:19] him and if he killed you he'd be killing
[1:57:21] him he says he can't do it because
[1:57:23] there's a uniting time amen and there's
[1:57:25] a uniting sign and what is it it's the
[1:57:27] life of christ within you
[1:57:29] amen
[1:57:30] what was it now he's pointing to the
[1:57:31] bride's position in their place placed
[1:57:33] by type and saying that he can't kill
[1:57:35] the one that's tied to the man that's
[1:57:36] sinless
[1:57:37] to the one that believes if she's tied
[1:57:39] to him he can't touch her because she's
[1:57:41] a part of him there's a unity there and
[1:57:43] then there's a oneness there that can't
[1:57:44] be broken amen the reason she can't be
[1:57:46] judged the reason she can't be destroyed
[1:57:48] is because she's a part of him
[1:57:50] amen now the secret to that is you
[1:57:53] always were
[1:57:55] you weren't outside and brought in it
[1:57:56] you always were you were taken out and
[1:57:58] now you're bringing back in but you
[1:57:59] always were a part of him amen
[1:58:02] you want the mind of christ
[1:58:04] there's an easy way for you get the life
[1:58:06] of god in you and then stay behind the
[1:58:08] word amen amen i've been listening to
[1:58:10] you must be born again and brother
[1:58:12] branham said
[1:58:13] this is what we're dealing with in the
[1:58:15] message i believe is he says you can
[1:58:16] take a creed and say i believe a creed
[1:58:19] i believe a man
[1:58:21] i believe william branham and i believe
[1:58:23] what he said
[1:58:24] he says that is not the new birth he
[1:58:26] says you can even apply the word
[1:58:29] and that's not the new birth
[1:58:32] because why the pharisees applied the
[1:58:33] word every day of their life their lives
[1:58:35] were untouchable concerning the law
[1:58:38] that's what paul said
[1:58:39] concerning the law i was perfect
[1:58:42] but he wasn't perfect he just thought he
[1:58:44] was perfect but concerning the law
[1:58:45] visibly on the outside
[1:58:47] he said not even applying the word is it
[1:58:49] he says the new birth is an experience
[1:58:51] with god individually
[1:58:55] so you can sit here and apply the word
[1:58:56] you can apply the message you can
[1:58:57] believe it all day long and he says
[1:58:59] that's not it
[1:59:00] and he's preaching it why because he
[1:59:01] says we've turned it into so many
[1:59:03] different things he said i could go to
[1:59:04] every church and they tell me a
[1:59:05] different thing about what the new birth
[1:59:07] is he says i'm going to tell you what
[1:59:08] the new birth is and he starts out by
[1:59:09] saying it's on experience with god not
[1:59:12] just with god but it's an experience of
[1:59:14] god in you
[1:59:16] amen amen amen
[1:59:18] that's it what did brahms say he said
[1:59:20] keep the word in front of you keep the
[1:59:22] word behind you keep the word around you
[1:59:24] keep the word in front of you keep it
[1:59:26] inside of you
[1:59:27] that's it that's the new birth the word
[1:59:30] inside of you
[1:59:31] we are the word made flesh today that is
[1:59:32] what the scriptures say that's what the
[1:59:34] song says amen that's what we're looking
[1:59:36] at he says keep the word in front of you
[1:59:38] all the time
[1:59:39] look at this he says now we remember
[1:59:41] that by this holy spirit we are brought
[1:59:43] into the body of christ and free from
[1:59:45] the judgment of god
[1:59:47] this is from the message abraham is
[1:59:49] seated after him
[1:59:50] we cannot come into judgment after you
[1:59:52] are in christ because christ took the
[1:59:54] judgment for you he stood in the place
[1:59:57] just like adam
[1:59:58] now adam was not deceived deceived he
[2:00:00] knowed exactly what he was doing but eve
[2:00:02] was deceived and she thought that what
[2:00:04] she was doing was right
[2:00:06] that's the sad thing about it was she
[2:00:07] thought that what she was doing was
[2:00:08] right it was the opposite of what god
[2:00:10] said but he had so twisted her mind to
[2:00:12] where she thought she was doing the
[2:00:13] right thing
[2:00:14] satan gave her about 95 pure gospel
[2:00:18] but that other five percent was enough
[2:00:19] to throw that off he said so we've got
[2:00:22] to be not just part gospel
[2:00:24] we've got to be full gospel
[2:00:26] we've got to have the entire word for
[2:00:29] the antichrist is a part gospel
[2:00:32] preacher
[2:00:34] we know that and his works are part
[2:00:37] gospel amen the antichrist spirit is
[2:00:39] what religious
[2:00:41] it has political aspects it has economic
[2:00:43] aspects but its main appearance is
[2:00:45] absolutely religious and it is what to
[2:00:47] take the power of god out of the word
[2:00:48] and replace it with men's dogmas and
[2:00:50] ideas and influence amen it tries to
[2:00:52] bring all sorts of things into religion
[2:00:54] and we see it in the world today
[2:00:55] everybody's preaching on everything
[2:00:57] except the word
[2:00:58] nobody's preaching the word and the
[2:00:59] power of the word all they're doing is
[2:01:00] preaching what politics is bringing out
[2:01:02] that's where we're at where all we're
[2:01:04] preaching over the pulpit is is the
[2:01:06] latest political divisions in the
[2:01:07] countries
[2:01:08] right that's not the gospel
[2:01:10] it's nothing to do with the gospel jesus
[2:01:12] jesus didn't get tied up in any of it
[2:01:15] in fact he gave him answers opposite of
[2:01:16] what most of them would have said
[2:01:18] what they say the soldiers uh we don't
[2:01:20] get paid very much what should we do he
[2:01:21] says be happy with your wages
[2:01:23] well us jews if a roman asks us we got
[2:01:26] to walk with him a while a mile what do
[2:01:27] we do he says walk two
[2:01:29] officers if they take my coat what do i
[2:01:30] do give him my cloak holes give him your
[2:01:32] claw castle he always went opposite with
[2:01:34] what conventional you know theory was
[2:01:36] for that day or or righting wrongs or
[2:01:38] making you know all these different
[2:01:39] things
[2:01:40] he said i'm not here to do this i'm not
[2:01:42] here to free this i'm not here to to
[2:01:43] change this i'm here to change you i'm
[2:01:45] here to restore you back to eden not to
[2:01:47] fix your political systems amen
[2:01:50] what is it the simplicity of the gospel
[2:01:51] is what paul pointed us to
[2:01:53] i like simple and i like black and white
[2:01:55] i'm a black and white personality as
[2:01:57] most of you know amen but i know when
[2:01:59] i'm getting off the word when i do what
[2:02:01] i start arguing with myself
[2:02:03] and i start trying to twist those things
[2:02:05] amen
[2:02:06] the good news is this you want the
[2:02:08] gospel the good news is this
[2:02:10] you come from god
[2:02:12] you're going to god
[2:02:13] he has a purpose for you and all he's
[2:02:15] asking you to do
[2:02:17] is let go and let him have his way amen
[2:02:19] that's it that's the gospel for the for
[2:02:21] the for the bride of this age he's got a
[2:02:23] plan he's got a purpose you're a part of
[2:02:24] him and all he's asking you to do is let
[2:02:26] him in so he can use you
[2:02:28] empty yourself out
[2:02:30] let him in
[2:02:31] and he'll take care of the rest that's
[2:02:32] the gospel for this day that's how
[2:02:34] simple it is
[2:02:35] let go and let god have his way
[2:02:37] amen god bless you let's stand together
[2:02:39] this morning
[2:02:40] amen
[2:02:43] thank you jesus
[2:02:45] i'm thankful for this message i'll tell
[2:02:46] you
[2:02:47] not the one i just preached
[2:02:49] i'm thankful for the message that we can
[2:02:51] go to to give us clarity in these things
[2:02:53] you know
[2:02:55] because it can get so twisted these days
[2:02:56] with the things that are out there like
[2:02:57] i said the politics of today you can get
[2:02:59] caught up in the rights and the wrongs
[2:03:01] and the do's and the don'ts and the ifs
[2:03:02] and the ifs watson buts right
[2:03:05] i was talking to some of some of my
[2:03:07] my extended family down there and
[2:03:09] they're asking questions and i would say
[2:03:11] that's a that's an unfair question it
[2:03:13] says you're asking me to answer and
[2:03:14] that's you're not giving me the right
[2:03:15] answer you're asking me to make a choice
[2:03:17] between two things that are neither one
[2:03:19] correct i said i'll tell you what i
[2:03:20] believe but i can't give you the answer
[2:03:22] you're looking for why because as a
[2:03:23] believer they don't have our solutions
[2:03:25] they don't have a word answer for
[2:03:27] anything what they've got is a left and
[2:03:28] a right
[2:03:29] and guess what neither one of those is
[2:03:31] the word guess what the middle is not
[2:03:33] the word some of the some word answers
[2:03:35] are right
[2:03:35] on the right side some word answers are
[2:03:37] on the left side
[2:03:38] and some of them are right in the middle
[2:03:39] of where they believe right now so we
[2:03:41] don't get into that amen you know what
[2:03:43] the answer is the answer is not by
[2:03:45] forcing people to not have abortions
[2:03:48] the answer is not by forcing people
[2:03:50] because all that's doing is pointing
[2:03:51] them to a law
[2:03:52] but we're pointing them to what a
[2:03:54] changed life
[2:03:55] what paul said such were some for some
[2:03:57] of you
[2:03:59] guess what the the answer to
[2:04:00] homosexuality is not don't be a
[2:04:01] homosexual let's get in love with christ
[2:04:03] and let him deliver you from that amen
[2:04:06] whether it's lying whether it's cheating
[2:04:07] whether it's stealing whatever it is our
[2:04:09] conversations our way of life the way we
[2:04:11] do things the answer is get into christ
[2:04:13] it is not stop doing it because you'll
[2:04:15] just stop doing it for a while and then
[2:04:16] you'll fall right back into the ditch
[2:04:18] again but if you can get into christ a
[2:04:20] life lived a life changed then guess
[2:04:22] what you've got the answer that we're
[2:04:23] looking for
[2:04:24] that's why that's why we preach a gospel
[2:04:26] we don't preach against something we
[2:04:28] preach for something which is come to
[2:04:30] christ and let him change you we're not
[2:04:31] even supposed to come into church change
[2:04:33] people
[2:04:34] that's how we get hypocrites
[2:04:36] when we try and change ourselves to make
[2:04:37] ourselves worthy but when we can come to
[2:04:38] him and say i need you i was reading a
[2:04:40] quote where brother braham says as soon
[2:04:42] as adam and eve as soon as they sinned
[2:04:44] he says they should have been running
[2:04:45] crying out to god saying lord lord we've
[2:04:48] messed up we've sinned we did it and you
[2:04:51] told us not to he says but what did they
[2:04:53] do they hid and they made a false
[2:04:55] religion to cover themselves and he had
[2:04:57] to go looking for them
[2:04:59] i want to be the one that screams lord i
[2:05:00] made a mistake
[2:05:02] lord i didn't pay for the insurance the
[2:05:03] way i should have
[2:05:05] be running straight to him and saying
[2:05:06] lord will you change me help me to do
[2:05:08] better next time and help me to be a
[2:05:10] reflection of you in this life amen amen
[2:05:13] amen let's bow our heads together
[2:05:16] heavenly father
[2:05:18] lord we face an uphill battle in these
[2:05:20] bodies that we've been given
[2:05:23] lord in our carnal minds lord in the
[2:05:25] desires of our flesh
[2:05:27] lord we're always at war with it
[2:05:30] the lord paul told us that we're
[2:05:31] supposed to keep it under submission
[2:05:33] lord that by the power of your word and
[2:05:35] by the indwelling holy spirit we're
[2:05:37] supposed to keep it under us lord that
[2:05:38] we're supposed to keep it
[2:05:40] under control lord and i believe that
[2:05:42] only comes through a relationship with
[2:05:43] you
[2:05:44] they're not just a one-time event a
[2:05:46] one-time baptism lord a one-time
[2:05:47] infilling but lord it's a daily a weekly
[2:05:50] lord dwelling with you and spending time
[2:05:52] with you and lord we see what happens
[2:05:55] when we get away from you we see what
[2:05:56] happened with eve lord when she lord
[2:05:58] isolated herself from her husband and
[2:06:00] from the fellowship of god and didn't
[2:06:02] open herself up lord
[2:06:03] and lord we pray that we wouldn't get to
[2:06:05] that place lord but that everything we
[2:06:06] do and say will be open before you lord
[2:06:09] that where we get off the path we come
[2:06:10] back quickly and say lord help me not to
[2:06:12] do it again
[2:06:13] lord for we want to be lights in this
[2:06:15] evil age
[2:06:16] lord we don't want to be hidden under a
[2:06:18] bushel lord but we want to be up on a
[2:06:19] hilltop lord people can see the light
[2:06:21] and be drawn to it
[2:06:23] lord would you grant us grace and favor
[2:06:25] lord give us strength for the battle
[2:06:27] lord give us humility for ourselves and
[2:06:29] for each other lord that we would lay
[2:06:31] ourselves before your word lord and ask
[2:06:33] it to have its way in us
