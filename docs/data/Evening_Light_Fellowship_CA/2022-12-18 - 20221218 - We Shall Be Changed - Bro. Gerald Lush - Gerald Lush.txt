praise the name of the Lord trusting that you believe what you're singing amen don't sing a lie sing the truth by the grace of God that there's never been a day like this day to me never been a day like this day to you Amen brother that's right we can go down through the ages to all these seven Church ages but there's never been an age like this one amen because this is the this is the end of it all this is the coming of the Lord this is the resurrection this is the rapture amen praise the Lord all that God promised God's bringing to to a closure amen so let's believe and brother that's that's what God's looking for somebody that believes Believers thou this brother I tell you it's a challenge he challenged Martha concerning Lazarus in the grave oh she said I know he'll rise again oh yes to her it was beyond where we are now but Jesus said I am the resurrection Jesus was was getting her to believe it now not down not down 2 000 years no no not a few years out but now he said why he said I am the resurrection or what the resurrection is not there no he said I am that Resurrection was right there with her amen and now the resurrection Is With Us by the grace of almighty God Amen concerning what God has done brother he what did he reveal he revealed the resurrection there was a number of times when even yes even in the ministry of William Brenham brother the dead was raised but even animals were raised oh yeah it was absolutely amazing to show what to show to the world that this is the hour of the resurrection and the Rapture praise the Lord not just raise this one or raise that one or heal this one or heal that one oh brother is to raise the Dead brother brother if they're going to come forth we're going to go for it by the grace of God brother if their dead in Christ will rise but those that are living for Christ amen and brother you know for the dead in Christ to rise we have to be here with that faith again let me remind you the prophet of God said he said God is waiting on us waiting on us or are we waiting on God no God's waiting on us to come to that faith for the resurrection and he said the dead in Christ are waiting on us amazing well for for the resurrection so brother sister oh brother so and so over there in that graveyard that's it no he's right there waiting for you Amen to what for to bring to give that faith and he'll step

for it we're hungry for it we're thirsting for it we want to get out of here amen because the world is what the prophet said is come to pass that prophecy is fulfilled that the world would go insane and we're living in an insane world brother I trust again don't let that Spirit get on you no no brother the world will consider us insane no they're insane the carers consider us insane because why because we're looking for the resurrection we're looking for the Rapture we're expecting a change Amen to get out of here not living for this oh we're gonna oh can't wait for tomorrow to come can't wait for this to happen can't wait oh Lord we want to do this we want that brother if there's anything the bride wants to do is to go into rapture amen I trust by grace that the devil is not deceiving us to think oh we want to do this we want to do that in this world in in the in on this Earth in this body no no we want to get out of this and into a glorified body by the grace of God and you've got to that's why God's waiting on us he's waiting us to come to that place where we want to go and we want to be resurrected we want to experience the change and be raptured amen look up your Redemption draws night God help us to believe it not to believe in something or tomorrow or the next day or next year or just a few years down the road or there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a Rapture there's not going to be it's it's going on now that's what we're that's what brings us here amen that's that's brother of the life we're living is a life that's looking up a life that's moving on to Eternity by the grace of God Amen not just to focus on oh Lord you blessed us yesterday you bless us today you will bless us tomorrow but the blessings we're looking for may be like Luther or

a while and he said oh maybe he used time but it will be in eternity and he said it'll be this this amount of like if it's in time we'll be this amount of time fellowshipping and then after that he said well oh look up there's Jesus and we're going to rise to meet him by the grace of God Amen god brother help us to have that Faith Brothers not just to believe in this Doctrine or that Doctrine that's good amen but brother that's moving us on to a greater Revelation amen I believe this this Doctrine I believe that Revelation that Revelation Amen brother let's put them all together and see what we believe now amen Brothers oh yeah praise the Lord that we believe what what God did in the first poll of William branham's Ministry the second pool of William Brown's Ministry do we believe the third poll amen do we believe that the word is made flesh amen the word Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart brother just wasn't just a man going forward with him with a gift of healing and laying his hands on the sick and they were healed and doing this and doing that no brother was the word in flesh Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart it was the word amen revealed in the mystery of God to give us resurrection and rapturing Faith get out of here amen by the grace of God who how many and who in the world would want to stay here in this world we want to stay in the in this Dimension we want to get into Glory considering what God what we have experienced considering what we are experiencing Amen in our souls amen if you're born again brother and you're a new creature in Christ oh there's there's something on the inside of the inside and brother it's ungreen it is thirsting and it is calling for eternity and brother we just we just want to get out of here amen so brother sister down Through the Ages when God gave the Saints this Revelation that Revelation that Revelation and brother thousands and millions of them laid down their lives for that Revelation lay down their lives for that word well what about the word brother that God has given us now to go from time to Eternity amen brother to get out of the get out of this this body and into a glorified body to be changed in a moment and in the drink Lemonade by the grace of God Amen so brother let's believe for our healing but let's believe for the rep for the change Hallelujah not just to Healing the body of sickness brother but let's let's believe for the healing of the body so that we're not subject to time no more or death but eternal life amen by the grace of God amen First Corinthians chapter 15 and beginning to read at verse 51. and he said behold I show you a mystery thank God for the revelation of the Mysteries under the revelation of the Zeals and he said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump amen and again what is that last Trump that last Trump is the message of the hour Amen to share with you again for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel amen and with the Trump of God Amen the Lord shall descend from the heaven with thee with the Trump of God and it is a message amen of the revealed word to give us the revelation of resurrection and right stream Faith praise the Lord amen and brother when he eat his sins from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God what's going to happen the dead in Christ they're going to rise first amen it's the hour of the Resurrection amen it's the hour of the Rapture the dead in Christ he said what will shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain amen shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen concerning what God has done and what God is doing it's for the Rapture it's for the resurrection is to get us out of here and it's to get us into glorified bodies by the grace of almighty God and he said Comfort one another with these words amen so God help us to believe what God has done why God did it amen and what brother what you're doing for you and me what effect is the word having on you and me what effect did the word Avon remember Martin Luther What affected the word of on John Wesley and the and the and the Pentecostals amen what effect is it having on you and me brother the Revelation that God gave them they lived their lives for it Amen brother they just focused on like Luther's focused on justification justification and then on down to sanctification the gifts of the Spirit The Bachelor of the Holy Ghost Amen brother and and the closer we're getting to the end and the greater revelation of God the more the Believers were look we're looking up looking for the resurrection looking for the Rapture amen not just oh praise the Lord thank you Lord for justification thank you for sanctification thank you for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit brother that's to get you to move on brother the thing of it is that you know there's a third or fourth generation that move that came up and what do they do instead of moving on they just settle down into what they started with oh yeah justification became a denomination sanctification became a denomination amen the gifts of the Spirit The Bachelor of the Holy Ghost and just a denomination amen and brother there's many around the even so-called message today so-called believing for the resurrection Rapture but they're just denominated we're just waiting for the we're waiting for the resurrection no God's waiting on you because God has come and he has given us the revelation of the Resurrection The revelation of the Rapture through the prophetic Ministry of William Branham amen so let's not just see William Brown let's see Jesus as the prophet of God say when he come to the pulpit now he said I got to get myself out of the way he said because I can't do this I can't do it why you want to you want to get Let Jesus take control brother Let Jesus take control of your life for the easy if you want to be if you want to be part of the Resurrection you want to be part of the Rapture he's got to have control amen amen so you're focusing on the spiritual not the not the religious and not the natural but spiritual amen Sons and Daughters of God by the grace of God so again he said I show you a mystery but the mystery's been revealed and we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen and it says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump amen for the trumpet shall sound as he said in Thessalonians Thessalonians amen and the dead in Christ shall rise first praise the Lord so brother sister what is it oh the the trumpet has sounded the dead in Christ are coming forth amen yes then we which Our Lives remain as you and me right now we're going to be cut out together with them to meet the Lord in the air amen let's see and believe what God is doing amen oh when he did this he did this what was he doing amen God help us to believe in the present tense revelation of God amen for the trumpet shall sound and the dead and cry and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen let's believe for the change brother we thank God for justification for sanctification we thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit but brother are we believing now for the change that's not just keep looking back for this and keep focusing on that and keep focusing on that just keep focusing on let's focus on change focus on the resurrection focus on the Rapture by the grace of God for verse 53 he said this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality amen that's what we're looking for that's what we're believing for so when this corruptable shall I put on incorruption and this Mortal should have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen God help us to believe amen that what God has done what God is doing amen is to give us the victory over death hell and the grave oh death where is thy sting and oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's believe and let's give God the thanks for the victory that brother God has revealed to us in these last days the resurrection and the rapture and he said therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen God bless his words you may be seated and turn with me to let's see Luke chapter 18. we'll read the scriptures and get into some thoughts and some quotes of the prophet Luke chapter 18. thank God for the word amen brother for many many many years the man's been oh yeah he's been reading the word he said the Bible has had this he had that amen but now brother we're living in the in the Fulfillment of the word brother there's the alpha but now we come to the Omega the end there's a beginning there's an end so I pray Grace brother sister that we got the revelation of the end amen that we're not looking for more for this to happen for this to happen for that to go on not another age another age no no believing that we have come to the end of the age for the bride of Christ amen but you got to believe it I pray Grace we believe it amen so in Luke chapter 18. and verse 7. and he said and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them having to deal the bride the elect of God having to deal with sin and unbelief yes and then it's to a certain extent religion amen for two thousand years Grace that we're going to stand for the truth and brother all down through in every age where God has revealed the word man has stood for the truth and then man has paid the price oh yeah so many million have been killed because they took their stand for the truth of God brother let's lay down our lives for the truth amen see sorry and shall not God avenge his own elect yes which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them that's why we've been crying unto the Lord day and night even so come Lord Jesus the resurrection Lord the rapture calling on the Lord amen and he said I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall e find faith on the Earth and it's amazing that the brother that did this version of the scriptures he understood what that Faith was he said it's a belief in the whole body of revealed truth amen that when the son of man comes will he find that faith on the Earth amen do I have that Faith do you have that faith that you believe in the whole body of revealed truth amen and this is what our brother highlighted in this in this translation of the scriptures almost 100 years ago amazing praise the lord well we believe that oh yes this was William Branham God did this God did that but brother God revealed this even to our brother back here a hundred years ago so he said but when he comes will he find faith on the earth and what is the faith he's going to he's going to be looking for the revelation of the whole body of revealed truth because in the last days the truth is going to be revealed amen that there is a revelation that that will bring them on from one age to another but finally in the last stage there's going to be a revelation of the truth for the resurrection and for the Rapture amen they believe for justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit Amen brother that was the that give them the faith to believe give them the faith to trust God give them the faith to lay down their lives and and believing for the resurrection believing for the Rapture amen but then there's to come a generation amen that's not going to lay down their lives and come back in the resurrection Rapture amen they're going to bring they're going to bring those that are gone on they're going to bring them forth amen they're going to call them out of the grape as Jesus did why because as as it was in the in the in the first coming of the Lord in our Lord Jesus Christ so it is in Mrs Jesus Christ he was than he is the Resurrection The Rapture now that same Resurrection same Rapture is made flesh in the bride Amen brother he came with that Revelation amen he came to reveal amen the the word of God the Resurrection The Rapture amen and now he has come in the last days again amen and he's revealed as the resurrection and Rapture amen they needed it then the the the yes the Redeemer Amen to redeem us spiritually amen he laid down his light he picked it up again amen and now in the last days to redeem us physically amen generations and generations laid down their lives but now we're going to pick it up again amen and go in the resurrection and in the Rapture amen the dead in Christ shall rise first and oh than we which are alive remain we oh we say well it's going to be Jesus it's gonna be Jesus but it's Christ in you amen and brothers depending on you he's waiting on you that's why prophet of God said that he's waiting on us amen for the resurrection let's not wait on oh I'm waiting on you Jesus with the resurrection sorry I've already did it Jesus already did it done it amen he come down he came and laid down his life and he brought it back again and then he came back on the day of Pentecost and shared that life with his with his elect with his seat and through the Bachelor of the Holy Ghost he's been sharing that he that that resurrection and Rapture with us amen I Define him the last days he's sharing it with us now amen praise the name of the Lord what poor it is for us to look up amen it's not just to move on from one age to another but brother comes to the final age where you've got to look up amen but oh yes brother whatever God did in every age just move on move on move on and they were being pointed on to what God had done what God was doing amen oh I'm going to do this I'm going to do that Amen to finally come in the last days well do we do we move on here no where are you going to move God's already done this he did this he did this he did that oh oh so there's only one thing to do now let's look up for the resurrection look up for the Rapture amen because because we were Justified Sanctified and and filled with the Holy Ghost and experience the gifts amen and now it's going on to eternal life Amen brother what God did on the inside is doing on the outside as I said he redeemed us spiritually now he's redeeming us physically amen I'm in here believing in physical Redemption the change of the body a body like Ganda is glorious Body by the grace of God Amen but the thing of it is when he when he come will he finds this faith on the earth do you have the faith that he's looking for do you have the faith that's believing for the change not just it not just the inside but the belief for the change outside that's tremendous most are believing for the change on the in their souls but there's a bride that's believing for the changing in their body amen I have been changed and I and I'm being changed and I will be changed amen by the grace of God hallelujah so God help us brother to have the end time faith for the resurrection and the rapture the end time faith brother is not just to say I I believe God or I was a sinner but now I'm saved no brother sister it goes beyond that from Sinners to Saints and Saints to the bride of Christ amen to the to not just being changed inside now we're going to be changed outside amen just think that God what God started on the inside now he's going to bring it to Perfection on the outside amen when he started in our souls and brother he moves on and moves on in our spirits and then from the spirit you're going to move on into your flesh to change the body amen by the grace of God this is absolutely amazing thank God for the revelation of the word we're in the the messenger that came brother he explained what God did he explained what God was doing and why he did it amen oh this is absolutely amazing concerning Redemption concerning salvation concerning the resurrection concerning the Rapture Amen brother all down Through the Ages they believe God did this God did this God did that and there all thou Through the Ages they were looking for the resurrection they were looking for the Rapture amen oh yes there's going to be the resurrect there's going to be a Rapture until finally in these last days there was a mess a messenger with a message amen we're in East where we're in God revealed to us the resurrection and the Rapture and the focus was on the resurrection and the Rapture amen and it wasn't just on all like justification or sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost and oh yeah the gifts of the Spirit oh no the focus was on the change oh yeah we've been Justified Sanctified and if we're all Justified as the word god revealed it in our souls in our in our spirit and on it now he's God's dealing with our flesh amen praise the name of the Lord Brother so brother what he started on the inside you Justified you're Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost amen so brother let's believe for the change amen because the word in flesh the word was made flesh in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and he redeemed us amen well in the beginning that same word was made flesh now in the bride Mrs Jesus Christ to redeem us physically Amen to take us out of time and into eternity Amen to get into a glorified body to get into a new Heaven and a new Earth amen oh brother how many really truly believe it let go let God have his way amen listen don't focus on this whole world no focus on the World to come amen let's not put all wealth but there's two still too many focusing on on the Natural Things of this whole life no brother sister just live it one day at a time amen by the grace of God Amen you're not going to try to build this and build that I want to I want to get this I want to get that I want to oh yes I want to be a success brother we we want to be to succeed spiritually amen you could succeed naturally financially in all those ways and yet not succeed spiritually Lord Brother I'll how rich are you spiritually we focus on the natural how many are focusing on the spiritual you know brothers and sisters are just bitter to better to be poor in this world and rich in the world to come amen and Brethren there's others that maybe that we have met down Through The Years brother that maybe they were poor in this world but they're rich in the world to come amen so I pray the grace of God brother that we we are entering into that Faith wherein we're building up riches in the world to come we're getting more rich in the world to come by the grace of almighty God Amen turn with me to Matthew and see chapter 24. don't get focused on natural things let's get focused on spiritual amen we're not living for natural things we're living for Spiritual amen but still there's too many so-called Believers that are putting too much emphasis on the Natural Things of life and they want to do this they want to do that they want to succeed here succeed there no amen maybe leave this impression with here and leave that impression somewhere else Amen brother we got to impress God amen and what the only thing that impresses God is your faith amen so I pray the grace of God that we got the faith that pleases God by grace to imagine chapter 24 and verse 1. and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the Temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down amen and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and Jesus answered and said take heed that no man deceive you amen for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many amen that's well that's again the reason why he said when the son of man comes will he find faith on the Earth amen because there's going to be so much deception for many shall come in my name in his name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear wars and rumors of wars and see that ye be not troubled amen for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for a nation shall rise against Nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places amen all these are the beginning of Sorrows how bad is the world going to get don't pray O Lord heal this stop this Lord change this make the world better no no brother according to the prophecy it's going to get worse amen that's why we're looking for a new Heaven and a new Earth amen and he said all these are the beginning of Sorrows and then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be aided of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another amazing and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold amen but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved God help us Amen to be in the spirit and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come the gospel has been preached around the world brother sister don't think there was a time when I was maybe looking around and concerning what was going on religiously around the world and I was saying Lord Oh The Gospel needs to be preached there the gospel needs to be preached there and so on but now brother concerning considering the technology of the world we're in brother it's the gospel have been preached around the world definitely when it comes to the television radio now the technology of computers and so on and not only that I guess some of you may have it there in your hand you know just a computer in your hand oh yeah and you can talk to anybody and around the world or you can go and see what was going on around the world Amen this is absolutely amazing oh brother and the father of God thought it was amazing for to be going to listen to people going around the world that he saw and they were listening to listening to the message and they just Jesus had a certain thing in their hand amen that technology wasn't available when the father of God was here but God showed it to him by a vision oh yeah amen when he said when he saw this oh yeah and it was in a certain country and they were they were and it was the message on this in this technology and they were listening to the message and it's around the world amen and even brother sister concerning what we have done and believing that God did choose us for a reason because it was I could start with brother Mark there and it was the church here and the Believers here the brothers and sisters here that basically started the message around the world you did oh yeah because we went online and and we put the message online we were this and this and this much of it and it was about two years or more before anyone else went online we were the first online with the message of the hour amen and I know that even Believers in Jeffersonville recognize that Believers in other parts of the world recognize that amen that God God uses for that purpose for that reason amen so brother the message has gone around the world and we've and I've had I've had it emails as it were from practically around the world as a result of the of the technology that we put on computers and they're oh yes it's absolutely amazing and I don't know I surely wouldn't have the time to to go and explain all what we've experienced and all that we have heard and Khan made contact with in the well since 1995 when our brother Mark was suggesting putting message that message on the internet I remember our brother taking me into his basement there and showing the computer and he and he searched for the name William Branham and there was nothing all he found was he found the name Branham but I think it was a a sports figure football or something or base or you have something like that and football player and that was Branham but there was nothing but William Branham nothing but the message online so and the brother did say he said brother would you like to put the message online I said well I said you let me know how much it'll cut costs and I said I'll I'll decide and he checked it and I said okay we'll put it online and so we went online 1995 I believe yeah and it was two years later before certain other individuals would go online we were the first so to God be the glory brother the message has gone around the world amen because as it is written here in the scripture amen because then then the end is going to come why because it's been around the world amen so brother get ready look up our Redemption draweth nigh it's finished well I think well we got to do this well if we evangelize this and evangelize that with the prophet of God brother in 1963 in December when he when he had finished the the revelation of the seals and he finished other other mysteries on the seals because even after the seals in April 63 brother Brown went and preached other Mysteries and they said now he said this is another revelation of this on the seals oh yeah and he preached this mystery another revelation of the seals unto finally brother at the end of 1963 he said now he said here I go he said back into evangelism yeah back into evangelism why because why because what God had ordained and predestinated for him to do he had done amen and now his ministry was to change it was it was basically finished and he said oh he said you're going to notice the difference he said you you'll wonder about this and wonder about that and so on I got that quote here somewhere and we'll I don't know he did say to the church the bride he said the Rapture is a revelation amen and he said it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture amen so we're going to be focusing on the revelation of the Rapture so I pray God help us amen but again there's other Revelations there where the prophet of God said he was he was going to move away from this move away from that he wasn't going to put the answers on this and this now he said I'm going back into evangelism that was in 1963 and basically it was December 63 that he that he said he would go back into evangelism see I'm not sure so we'll see later but let me give you this quote right here again was in the message perfect faith and he said this is coming to that third pool of his ministry 1963 and he said now he said listen he said I'm working out something and he said it's taking this charge of faith and it's going right back to begin and come in and he said see to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you have never noticed it that way before so is he raising your faith is God raising our faith in a bracket that we have never noticed it before God help us he said not not a faith he said but perfect faith amen that's right perfect faith amen you got faith that's good but do you have perfect faith you may have a perfect faith in believing for justification but you have the perfect faith that believes Alpha and Omega beginning and the end amen there are those that have a perfect Faith to believe this to believe that to believe that but do you have the perfect Faith to believe what God has done what God is doing what God will do amen the Alpha and the Omega not just the perfect faith of the alpha but you have the perfect faith of the Alpha and Omega amen do you have the perfect faith of the beginning and the end God help us amen that we know that God did this and God did that and now he's doing this it's the plan of God amen so he said listen watch he said it is not a faith it is a perfect faith he said built up in here and he said watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word amen which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart it wasn't William Brenham it was the word the word in flesh amen deserting the thoughts and intents of the heart and he said what and he said we are coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this perfection what for he said in order for the rapture God help us brother's not focusing on the Rapture is focusing on the Perfection of the revelation in your heart in your soul in your life amen he said that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith and the ministry of the word is to because faith comes by hearing the word and the ministry as to preach and Minister the word to increase our faith in the rapture to increase our faith in the resurrection not yesterday today oh he did this 2000 years ago he laid down his life he picked it up again and resurrected it amen that's right what about now God help us and got out the ministry it's like I said when I was visiting some brethren and they put on their internet and put on a message preacher and he would preaching Lord I said he's not called to preach no I felt that that particular Minister that particular preacher and he's on the internet and no doubt there's many many thousands are listening to him and I said Lord I said sure he's not called to preach I see I said I don't even sense that there in in in in in in what he's preaching and now he's preaching I said that's he doesn't have the the spirit of that prayer of a Preacher a pastor ah Lord I said please don't let the people be deceived but yet many are deceived and are listening to that preacher and then I went on and but they put out another preacher and somebody had mentioned to me about that preacher you hear this one here that one I said I wouldn't I heard it I said no oh Lord I wasn't doubting a call to preach but what he was preaching I said it's not giving us resurrection and rapturing faith I said that's not really the message of the hour I said God have mercy on us brother when you leave when you hear a preacher you better make sure it's the word that you need make sure it's the word that God is ordained for us to have in these last days amen and brother what God has ordained for this hour is to give us resurrection and rapturing faith is to get us out of time and into eternity let's focus on Amen this focus on eternity let's focus on getting out of time but yet there are those are just they're satisfied with this ministry or they're going to preach oh they preach this they preach that and brother you can preach on what's going on out there in the world but let's preach on what's going on in the bright let's focus on what's going on in the bride as one Minister that somebody was showing me and and getting me to listen to and he was focusing on what's going on that there going on there going on there oh it's then it's the end yep focused on the bride what's going on in the bride and then you determine whether it's going on in your life brother is your life reflecting what God's doing to get the bride into the resurrection and into the rapture amen brother if God's waiting on us for the resurrection of rapture does do you have the faith for the resurrection do you have faith for the rapture that even the dead in Christ are waiting on us and waiting on you we better focus on it amen make sure that the preaching of the word is bringing us to Resurrection and rapturing faith amen he said we're coming now to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture what is it what kind of perfection oh live a perfect life no you better go and live perfect faith of what God is doing what God has done amen but what God is doing and that God can use you if there's something else he got to do Grace it is for the rapture and he said that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith and he said I'm looking for it it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God Amen so brother is God shaking you down spiritually shaking you yeah when it comes to the word so that you're focusing more and more and more on the resurrection you're focusing more and more on the rapture Amen brother whatever God did we could see it in the scriptures God moved in such a way as to get to get his seed focusing on what he was doing not to say well I believe this Lord and then they they move on and do this and do that no no they had to focus on it and they would reflect it it's like it's like Cain and Abel praise the Lord brother they both had a revelation of that they needed Redemption but Abel had the right revelation to sacrifice and remember they both sacrifice and Cain sacrificed as I said before we say it again Cain's sacrifice was excellent how do you know that well it says that Abel offered them more excellent and you can get Believers that are offering wonderful oh yeah good sacrifices as Believers oh yeah he's a Believer she's a Believer yeah but is it the more excellent sacrifice it caused Abel his life and if you're offering the more excellent sacrifice it's going to cost you your life when it comes to with family friends Neighbors yeah you'll be cut off look what they did to Jesus look what they did to the to the disciples now God help us are we are we willing to lay our lives down as Peter did is and not only just when they went to crucify Peter oh I'll tell you this Peter said pump me don't Don't crucify me the way you did it you did him he said I'm not worthy what not worthy no he said I'm not worthy he said turn me upside down They Crucified him on a cross but they put his feet up and his head down that's the way he wanted to lay his life down because he felt he wasn't worthy to lay his life down like Jesus did on the cross normally no he said turn me upside down God help us what was Peter into perfect faith perfect day for him to want to do it that way his faith had to be perfect oh Peter God bless you you know and brother the father said we're waiting to come to this perfect faith for the Rapture and he said we've got to come to perfect faith for the rapture yes he said it means that oh yeah I was going to emphasize some of this eventually but I said no I won't do it maybe I'll take another message in another some more services to put the emphasis on William Branham you look at Cain and Abel look what happened to Abel you look all the way down through and and and you and this this one and that one they were religious but not spiritual one was spiritual and look at the price that they had to pay to take their stand spiritually for the Lord and I wanted to spend some time to show you what was going on in William's Ministry because he also said that he said he that he he had to lay aside everything now he said I'm going to quit this and quit that now he said I'm just going to go back into evangelism and so on and that he also was indicating too that he that he wouldn't that they were going to miss him because he felt that he wouldn't he wouldn't stay it much longer and he didn't shortly after he mentioned those things God took him off the scene you mean to say William bam change this ministry like that yes he changed his ministry he was focusing on this focusing on that until finally at the end of 1963. he changed it two years later God took him home and just think when he celebrated his his birthday 56th birthday I believe it was in 1965. oh yes it's on the tape there and he said see amazing he said I see my end coming at 56 years old he did yeah and with that same year that God took him home he knew he was going brother he said we're coming to perfection perfect faith for the rapture and he said we have to come to this in order for the rapture we got to focus on the rapture what God's done and what God's doing and what God's going to do for the rapture focus on it are you really looking for the rapture do you really want to go in the Rapture are you really hungry and thirsty for the rapture God help us or you just satisfied to be religious most are just satisfied to be religious I'm religious I'll do this I'll do that no no he said that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith raptured not rapturing raptured because the the prophet of God is the fact that the Rapture is already on is going on now he said I trust that we're experiencing the Rapture that we've been caught up what do you mean being caught up how do you know that well if you're being caught up the world and the things of the world around you is having less and less effect on you yeah you're getting more and more and more interested in the resurrection more interested in the Rapture monster in the Lord amen amen oh yeah a new Heaven new Earth because I said you you're not of this world and as I said if you if as like a newfoundlander maybe like I said the other night going going to a a certain place in in the world and after after you're there a while oh you want to get back home why because that's what you're used to oh get back home oh I feel good now I'm home oh yeah so brother it's the same thing with the seed of God the bride of Christ we want to get home that's why we're not satisfied here in this old world no we want to get home God help us amen and that's why in the word of God we know that the only way home is the resurrection and the rapture he said that's what's holding it away right now and waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith raptured and I said I'm looking for it and it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen and then he said don't you love him he said think right now he said already be going to work in your body of your healing because that he promised it would happen and he said did you catch what I was saying tonight have you got the riddle of it he said if you say to this mountain don't doubt but he said believe that what you have said he said I'm your brother he said standing as your brother an intercessor and he said I'm trying to my best to hold you before God and I'm standing here right before the white throne point my finger to that Bloody sacrifice and speaking through its name his name that it's done amen brother grace of God to give us rapturing faith and grace of God to live the life that's going out of time into eternity amen he said to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her and it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture brother we got it now it is a revelation for the Revelation is faith and you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you and he said something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham amen amen amen many other quotes we'll leave it amen grace of God to us listen Saints an end time faith that God has been working on to give us through the revealed word not a personal faith or personal belief in God but a belief in the whole body of revealed truth that is the perfect faith and end time faith that God's looking for believeth thou this the climax of that Revelation for the elect is the resurrection and Rapture amen to climax of all that God has done Through the Ages is the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen because God give them the faith to do what he required in in each age Amen in justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts of the Spirit but now amen should the prophetic Ministry and the revealed word amen he's given us the faith not to go to another church age to get out of the ages and get into Glory amen brother all down through they've moved on to another age they moved on to another age and another age amen and God was doing this and God was doing that they were moving on looking forward to finally the last generation is looking up because what God is doing brother is not get us looked forward look up amen we're not going through the door look up by the grace of God so again please the climax of that revelation thank you in these last days the mysteries of God is the resurrection and the rapture it's the climax yeah not many professing Christians or message Believers are being caught up in the faith day and night Martin Luther was rejoicing in the faith in the revealed truth of being justified in our Lord Jesus Christ day and night John Wesley was rejoicing in the faith amen the revealed truth of being Sanctified in our Lord Jesus Christ and yes day and night the Pentecostals were rejoicing in the faith the revealed truth the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen but now morning noon and night the bride is getting into the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen God gave them the faith that they needed and they focused on it and they moved on to another age and they focused on it and another age but the bride of Christ is not moving to another age you know the bride of Christ is moving to Eternity amen do you think about the hour that we are living are you thinking about the resurrection are you thinking about the Rapture could happen any minute the whole body of revealed truth in this age is a sign that the resurrection and Rapture is about to climax Grace that we're not going to be left behind too late the prophet said there's going to be a generation that's going to be here too late and they're going to see this and you'll see that we're going on out there in the world and they'll say oh I thought there was to be a resurrection to your rapture where is it and he said the voice came to him and said it's already happened and you didn't and you didn't know it god Elvis please don't miss it please don't get religious oh yeah and focus just on the doctrine so yeah the the mystery of God's revealed and I believe it and so on yes but are you believing the faith that it's ordained to give you to get out of time and into eternity it's ordained all that God has done in this hour and this age in the re in the mysteries of God is to give us rapturing faith please are you getting more and more into the revelation of the rapture are you getting more and more into the revelation of the Resurrection what do you think of when you drive by a cemetery God help us I pray God we're not looking for the Saints there they're not there if they are seed of God during the dimension with you you're right that's the prophet said they're right there he said they're not 12 feet from you at any any given time yeah so don't worry about the graveyard it's like I said there's a a picture that I saw one time in a certain book and I I did pass it on to somebody else it was a religious book and it was a picture a painting of the Resurrection and in the resurrection there was any like a cemetery and you saw the Dead coming out of the graves and going out oh yes there was Grandma and Grandpa they were old and there was a a a a child just a young child and a baby and they were they were being raptured and resurrected and they were going up up in in the painting I said well I said that brother never had the revelation because I said that baby is not going to be out there there's no infant of days neither an old man does not fulfill his days amen because that the the infant is going to be young and the old man comes back to you to his to his young days and so on praise the Lord that that will be the resurrection that'll be the Rapture one of your grandma and grandpa comes back to you if if they they're going to be in the resurrection of the Rapture brother my grandma and grandpa they won't be like they were when we laid them in their coffins no no gray or ball headed and aged and wrinkled and so on no will not need by any means they're going to be young it's like the young sister one time that had the vision of going from time to Eternity and when she got over and she got over to that other dimension she saw this young man and she looked at him and he said you don't know me she said no who are you oh she said I was he said I was your brother he said when we were on Earth he said I was your brother but he was just a young young boy and here he was the young man in eternity well she said oh yes he said that's me and he said this is what I am here he said in eternity praise the Lord please let's be in the spirit brother if you're not in the spirit here when you go on to Eternity you won't be in the in the right Spirit there amen if we're going to recognize what God has done what God's doing here brother we got we'll recognize what God has done doing in eternity let's be on our guard for the glory of God amen Allah to finish with this in again Matthew 24. I'll read the scriptures that I got listed here from Matthew 24 again and verse 1 and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple or the buildings and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left ear one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he set upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us When shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take he that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for a nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places and these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be aided of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many of be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another yes indeed and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen God help us to endure and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come and as I said it has been preached in all the world where it's finished but again we think it's just a matter of days or whatever when the Bible says one day with the Lord has a thousand years a thousand years is one day amen so it's been two days since since Calvary oh yeah two thousand years says Jesus came and laid down his life and picked it up again it's about two days well what about the third day we're into the third day that's right so I pray Grace the three is the perfection amen it says when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let them which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house forget it I wonder how many of us are willing to let go I forget all that we possess yeah all your worldly positions what about your vehicles your money your house your furniture don't put no emphasis on it here thank God you got it and move on by grace unfortunately there's so many that they feel so bad about having to leave all that but if you're a bride leave it burn it amen he said let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let them which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever known nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lawyers Christ are there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect God have mercy on us amen that will not be deceived but stay with the truth stay with the word by the grace of God amen we'll have to leave it maybe stop there and continue on Wednesday he said when a man lives by faith and when a man walks by faith substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now he says you're getting into a bright material you're getting into a rapturing condition amen the grace of God be with us God bless you let's stand praise the Lord amen let's turn to number one seven no sorry yeah it's four zero
