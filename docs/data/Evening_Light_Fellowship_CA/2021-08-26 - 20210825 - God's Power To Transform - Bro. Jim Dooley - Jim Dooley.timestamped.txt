[34:20] if there's anything he's looking for in
[34:22] your life is your will
[34:24] amen your way turned over to him
[34:27] not my will thine be done
[34:29] praise the lord so god bless us
[34:32] amen and we certainly welcome again our
[34:35] brother jonathan and brother joseph's
[34:37] family back from the trip that they took
[34:40] amen we missed him
[34:42] amen so we're thankful that the lord has
[34:44] brought him back amen and
[34:46] trust him with a blessing
[34:48] amen and also appreciate the fact of the
[34:52] the saints that our brother jonathan and
[34:54] his family visited
[34:56] amen while he was across the island and
[34:59] there's there is quite a few saints
[35:01] there
[35:02] uh and factors i'm not sure exactly
[35:04] maybe 17 or 18 out there that are
[35:06] supporting supporting the ministry and
[35:08] the assembly here
[35:10] so we pray the grace of god bless them
[35:12] amen and let us by grace keep them in
[35:16] prayer amen so the lord bless us and
[35:19] again we want to
[35:21] uh
[35:22] to eventually just turn everything over
[35:24] to our brother dooley amen we thank the
[35:27] lord for bringing our brother to
[35:29] newfoundland amen we thank the lord for
[35:32] giving our brother the opportunity to
[35:34] minister to the word to us
[35:36] amen and again we know again it's not
[35:39] not totally in this is control it's god
[35:42] in control
[35:43] praise the lord
[35:44] not exactly that the brother wants to do
[35:46] it but the problem of god said if you
[35:48] want to do it he said you're not called
[35:49] to do it
[35:51] amen because i i've maybe over the years
[35:54] met a lot of people felt oh they they
[35:56] were called they're called their call to
[35:58] the ministry and i said and they wanted
[36:00] to do it they wanted the attention they
[36:02] wanted the preeminence i said lord
[36:04] they're not called and that's the truth
[36:07] so again we pray the grace of god to be
[36:09] with our brother dooley amen as he comes
[36:12] to minister the word
[36:13] praise the lord and again not exactly oh
[36:16] well
[36:17] he he mentioned that maybe there's
[36:19] somebody else could minister
[36:21] oh yeah maybe there is
[36:23] but he didn't want to minister as it
[36:24] well maybe he's called to minister
[36:27] amen to us
[36:29] he was a blessing and he can and he will
[36:31] be a blessing and again again it's not
[36:34] it's not him it's the lord
[36:36] amen and against the same thing whether
[36:39] i trust by grace whether whether it's
[36:41] our brother jonathan or brother mark or
[36:43] whoever our brother's earl whoever's
[36:45] ministering amen
[36:47] that i trust that it's not them that is
[36:50] the holy ghost in them
[36:51] it is god in control
[36:54] amen
[36:55] turn yourself over to the lord amen just
[36:58] knowing this lord without you i can do
[37:01] nothing
[37:02] but with you all things are possible
[37:04] by the grace of god
[37:07] amen so be in prayer for our brother and
[37:10] a brother i just want to say again we
[37:11] appreciate
[37:12] your fellowship we appreciate your
[37:14] presence we appreciate the ministry that
[37:16] god's been giving through you
[37:18] and again he doesn't feel like he's
[37:20] called to minister as a as a preacher
[37:22] evangelist pastor or apostle
[37:26] a man but again even as a deacon
[37:29] sometimes god does
[37:30] bless deacons with with the ability to
[37:33] exhort
[37:34] amen or bless believers with the with
[37:37] the
[37:38] with the blessing and the anointing to
[37:39] exhort the brothers and sisters in the
[37:41] faith amen
[37:43] so we thank god
[37:45] for again for the anointing in our
[37:47] brother
[37:48] dooley amen brother
[37:50] take our blessings back to the saints
[37:53] by the grace of god we appreciate it so
[37:56] lord bless us let's stand and let's
[37:58] listen only believe all things are
[38:00] possible only believe amen and we'll
[38:03] turn it to our brother
[38:04] they just think
[38:06] again that only believe where it came
[38:08] from why it was written
[38:10] written for the prophet
[38:12] preceding the the ministry of the word
[38:14] amen so praise the lord to god be the
[38:17] glory so be in prayer
[38:19] for the minister of the word going forth
[38:21] through our brother and be in prayer for
[38:23] the receiving of the word in your soul
[38:26] amen that you're going to receive the
[38:28] word
[38:28] amen by the grace of god not just the
[38:31] letter of it in your head and the power
[38:33] of god he knew
[38:35] there there were many that were
[38:36] listening to the prophet but they only
[38:38] got it in their heads but they never got
[38:40] it in their souls amen so i trust the
[38:43] word will go beyond your mind down into
[38:46] your spirit and beyond your spirit into
[38:48] your soul by the grace of god amen don't
[38:51] don't let it because why because if if
[38:54] he is in control of your soul if you are
[38:56] truly born again and amen he is in
[39:00] the throne of your life
[39:03] he's controlling your life but he's not
[39:05] going to do it from your head he's not
[39:07] doing it from your spirit he's doing it
[39:09] from your soul
[39:10] amen by the grace of god
[39:12] because out of the soul comes the new
[39:14] nature of the born-again creature amen
[39:17] controlling your spirit and through the
[39:20] spirit controlling
[39:22] the the senses of our of our flesh amen
[39:26] hallelujah brother we're born naturally
[39:29] we go forth naturally reflecting mom and
[39:32] dad and grandpa and grandma and so on
[39:35] reflecting other relatives but if we're
[39:38] born again
[39:39] brother he comes in he takes control of

[45:30] verses of scripture while we're standing
[45:33] romans chapter 12
[45:38] verses 1 and 2.
[45:46] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[45:48] mercies of god
[45:50] that you present your bodies a living
[45:53] sacrifice
[45:54] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[45:58] reasonable service
[46:00] and be not conformed to this world
[46:04] but be transformed
[46:06] by the renewing of your mind
[46:09] that ye may prove what is that good and
[46:12] acceptable and perfect will of god
[46:16] praise the lord amen
[46:20] you may be seated
[46:22] may the lord have his blessings
[46:24] amen
[46:28] god's power to transform
[46:36] we can say
[46:37] we can say amen because
[46:41] we've
[46:43] we've had that experience in our life
[46:46] amen where our lives have been
[46:48] transformed
[46:50] amen our minds have been
[46:53] changed they've been renewed
[46:56] amen
[46:58] we're thankful tonight
[47:00] amen
[47:05] god's power to transform is the message
[47:07] we're reading from first start here
[47:12] he said
[47:14] after the scripture was writ was read he
[47:16] says it's an old familiar text
[47:19] that many of your pastors
[47:22] has uh used down through your time it's
[47:25] been used since it was written
[47:28] but yet one thing about the word of god
[47:31] it never grows old it never grows old
[47:35] because it's god
[47:37] it never grows old though every
[47:39] generation
[47:42] through every generation now for pretty
[47:45] near about 2 800 years or better this
[47:48] word of god has been read by man priests
[47:52] and so forth
[47:53] and never does it grow old
[47:56] he says i've been reading it myself for
[47:58] some 35 years
[48:00] and each time i read it i find something
[48:02] new
[48:03] amen because it's eternal brothers and
[48:05] sisters it's eternal
[48:07] god's word rain
[48:12] it says that i looked over the first
[48:14] time i find something new that i looked
[48:16] over the first time
[48:17] because it is inspired it is god in
[48:20] letter form see it's the attributes of
[48:23] god speaking forth
[48:26] speaking for and is placed on paper
[48:29] right many times man well a man wrote
[48:32] the bible the bible says itself that god
[48:35] wrote the bible it is the word of god
[48:38] and it can never fail jesus said heaven
[48:40] and earth
[48:42] will
[48:43] will fail pass away but my word shall
[48:46] never fail and it cannot fail
[48:48] and being god because it's part of him
[48:52] amen because there is no failure
[48:54] there is no failure there is no thought
[48:57] of failure there is no thought of change
[49:00] amen in god what god said in the
[49:03] beginning he will say in the end or in
[49:06] the middle wherever it may be his word
[49:09] never changes
[49:10] amen praise the lord see hallelujah
[49:15] and he says it can never fail
[49:19] it can never fail heaven and earth will
[49:22] pass away but my word shall never fail
[49:24] and it cannot fail and being god because
[49:27] it's part of him
[49:28] and then you being a son and daughter
[49:30] you are part of it see
[49:33] and that makes you a part of him
[49:35] i mean a part of god
[49:38] amen and we read it there and
[49:40] we mentioned the scripture in john 1 and
[49:43] a couple sundays ago when i was here in
[49:45] the beginning was the word
[49:47] and the word was god the word was with
[49:49] god and the word was god and that word
[49:51] was made manifest
[49:54] to us amen
[49:57] so uh god was manifested
[50:02] to us excuse me
[50:05] and he says you being a son or daughter
[50:07] you are part of it so that makes you
[50:10] part of him amen so that's why we we why
[50:14] we come to fellowship together around
[50:17] the word of god
[50:19] amen
[50:20] it's not church entity it's not any of
[50:23] these things brothers and sisters it's
[50:24] the word of god
[50:26] that brings
[50:28] the fruit amen amen
[50:33] he said let this mind be in you
[50:36] that was in christ
[50:38] amen who thought it
[50:40] not robbery to be equal with god but
[50:43] made himself of no reputation
[50:46] and took upon him the servant
[50:50] excuse me
[51:01] he says the word transformed
[51:05] something that has changed see
[51:08] made different
[51:10] that's what it was its character has
[51:13] been changed in it and we know that our
[51:16] characters
[51:17] our character has been changed
[51:20] amen we're not what we used to be
[51:23] right
[51:24] we don't think what we used to think
[51:27] we don't do what we used to do
[51:30] amen the desires
[51:34] that we used to have in our flesh
[51:37] we don't have those desires we're not in
[51:39] bondage to those desires anymore
[51:42] you may think of all the things that
[51:44] whenever went on in
[51:46] in
[51:47] in the world before we knew knew christ
[51:49] but there's no desire that desire is
[51:52] gone
[51:54] amen
[51:56] we have a new desire which is for the
[51:58] word of god
[52:00] see
[52:01] and he said this word transformed
[52:05] it says something that's changed it's to
[52:08] be changed transformed made different
[52:10] than what it was
[52:12] it's been its character and everything
[52:14] has been changed in it see
[52:17] to transform and i think this morning in
[52:19] genesis 1 he says the world was without
[52:22] form
[52:24] so we're talking about being transformed
[52:27] he said the world was without form and
[52:29] it was void
[52:30] and darkness was upon the face of the
[52:32] earth
[52:33] [Music]
[52:40] nothing but a complete chaos he says and
[52:43] when this world was in that condition
[52:45] the spirit of god moved upon
[52:48] the face of the water
[52:50] amen no different than what happened
[52:53] with you and i personally brothers and
[52:55] sisters
[52:56] we were in chaos whether we were in
[52:58] religion or in the bar
[53:01] don't much matter
[53:03] right it doesn't much matter
[53:06] right chaos but the spirit of god
[53:09] moved upon us
[53:12] the spirit of god came by our way one
[53:14] time
[53:16] right
[53:17] we realized
[53:19] right that we're not the son and
[53:21] or daughter of i'm not the son of jim
[53:24] dooley anymore i'm just i'm the son of
[53:26] god now
[53:30] amen
[53:31] praise the lord
[53:33] see
[53:42] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[53:44] water and the entire picture was changed
[53:48] from a total chaos to a garden of eden
[53:50] condition
[53:52] talking about the world he says that is
[53:54] transforming power of god
[53:57] that can take something that's nothing
[53:59] and make something wonderful out of it
[54:02] god's transforming power
[54:05] amen god's transforming power brothers
[54:07] and sisters we have to give merit to
[54:09] god's transforming power in our lives
[54:13] god wants to be worshipped
[54:15] amen god wants to be worshiped there's
[54:18] no better
[54:19] way to worship god than to honor his
[54:21] word
[54:26] you have your own
[54:28] you have your own time in your own
[54:29] prayer clauses where you or you make
[54:31] contact with your
[54:33] your savior
[54:36] amen
[54:37] but the word of god
[54:39] the word of god is is uh
[54:42] is just so important to us
[54:46] you know
[54:47] we we have to have that word of god in
[54:50] our lives
[54:52] that is transforming power of god that
[54:54] can take something that's nothing and
[54:57] make something wonderful out of it
[54:59] amen he can take a was not and and make
[55:02] it a make it something
[55:05] he can take your life and he can take my
[55:07] life and he can change us
[55:09] in the inner man amen and that seed when
[55:12] it comes alive
[55:14] in us that seed that was there before
[55:16] the foundation of the world was ever
[55:18] laid
[55:19] amen that seed was gone was there and
[55:22] god watered that seed and that seed
[55:25] which has everything in it
[55:27] amen whether it's an oak tree
[55:30] or a spruce tree or whatever kind of a
[55:32] tree whether it's a human being what the
[55:35] god seed is in it
[55:37] god's seed is in it and that life that's
[55:39] in that seed will bring forth that
[55:42] majestic
[55:44] design that god so
[55:46] desired to have in that tree or that
[55:49] person
[55:51] see
[55:53] and we understand by the reading of
[55:54] scripture he says
[55:56] he says
[55:57] that god was 6 000 years in making this
[56:00] preparation for this eden
[56:02] now he might not have been that long but
[56:05] just presuming and taking it from the
[56:07] scriptures where it said one day with
[56:10] god is a thousand years on earth
[56:12] that it is god
[56:14] if god should count time
[56:17] and say it was 6 000 years he had it
[56:21] he had been making the earth and he had
[56:23] planted upon the earth all good seed
[56:27] see there was just everything was
[56:29] perfect
[56:37] he says but if we would just notice for
[56:40] a moment before we get
[56:42] into our text here that moses saw the
[56:44] vision
[56:46] see and god spoke to him
[56:48] god spoke to moses face to face lift to
[56:51] ear
[56:52] now he never spoke to any other man like
[56:55] that
[56:56] as he did moses see moses was was a
[56:59] great one of the greatest of all the
[57:01] prophets he was the type of a type of
[57:03] christ and now god can speak he says god
[57:07] can speak he spoke to moses and i i know
[57:10] and i was reading back in genesis
[57:13] you know where that account
[57:16] of moses
[57:18] when he was walking along the trail
[57:20] there
[57:21] and and
[57:24] and he saw the burning bush
[57:28] right
[57:29] moses saw the burning bush
[57:32] and he and he looked at it
[57:35] god was in the burning bush
[57:38] and his servant was here looking at the
[57:40] burning bush
[57:44] and moses the bible tells us in genesis
[57:48] pardon me i think
[57:50] exodus
[57:52] three
[57:54] uh
[57:55] that moses turned aside
[58:00] to see that phenomena
[58:02] of the burning bush that wasn't consumed
[58:06] see and it was then
[58:08] that god spoke to moses
[58:12] and told him don't come any closer
[58:15] you know take your shoes off your feet
[58:17] for the ground you're standing on this
[58:18] holy ground
[58:20] right and i think you know
[58:24] the jews if you if you read the book of
[58:26] acts the jews
[58:28] in berea
[58:30] they said the bible says that they were
[58:32] more noble
[58:33] than the jews of thessalonica and now
[58:36] when they heard this revealed word for
[58:38] their day
[58:40] they took and studied the scrolls they
[58:42] studied everything to see what's this
[58:44] word all about
[58:47] amen
[58:48] just like brother mark he come into
[58:50] contact with a newspaper i believe back
[58:52] in 1979
[58:53] was there someplace back there sometime
[58:55] back there you know and something
[58:58] attracted his attention
[59:00] to that
[59:02] right something attracted his attention
[59:04] something there was something burning he
[59:07] had to get to the bottom of it
[59:09] see and the bottom of it was the
[59:11] revealed word of god for this hour
[59:14] right and look at the fruits of that you
[59:18] know when you turn aside
[59:20] or when i turn aside
[59:22] and we and we and we look to see what
[59:25] god is doing in our day brothers and
[59:27] sisters what he has revealed to us
[59:31] the price that he paid for yours and my
[59:33] salvation the price that he paid that
[59:35] you and i
[59:36] today
[59:38] can stand here
[59:39] and sit here and we can enjoy the
[59:41] wonderful word of god
[59:43] that's been given to us through the
[59:45] mouth of his vindicated prophet
[59:47] in our day
[59:52] praise god
[59:55] he said
[59:58] see
[1:00:02] god can speak he has a voice
[1:00:04] he says it's been heard
[1:00:06] god can speak and god can write god
[1:00:08] wrote the ten commandments with his own
[1:00:10] finger
[1:00:11] he wrote it on the walls of babylon once
[1:00:14] many many tackle
[1:00:16] you you herpson i believe this says
[1:00:19] the art weighed into balance and found
[1:00:21] wanting
[1:00:22] to nebuchadnezzar
[1:00:23] you know
[1:00:25] god wants to get our attention brothers
[1:00:27] and sisters
[1:00:28] there's nothing
[1:00:30] out of his reach if he wants to get our
[1:00:32] attention or if he wants to get
[1:00:34] somebody's attention what he'll do
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:44] he said
[1:00:45] there is no other
[1:00:48] he said he wrote it on the walls of
[1:00:50] babylon once with his finger he
[1:00:52] he stooped down and wrote in the sand
[1:00:54] one time with his finger
[1:00:56] god can speak god can read and god can
[1:00:59] write he says
[1:01:01] god is the fountain of all grace and
[1:01:03] power
[1:01:04] and of all
[1:01:06] excuse me
[1:01:07] and of all divine wisdom is in god
[1:01:11] so therefore knowing that he is the only
[1:01:13] creator there is
[1:01:15] pardon me there is no other creator but
[1:01:18] god
[1:01:19] satan cannot create see he only perverts
[1:01:22] what's been created but god god is the
[1:01:25] only creator
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] hallelujah
[1:01:31] amen amen he created you
[1:01:34] he created me
[1:01:37] amen when uh when the earth
[1:01:41] when the earth
[1:01:42] was
[1:01:44] without form and void
[1:01:46] and darkness upon the face of the earth
[1:01:49] you know
[1:01:50] all the seeds
[1:01:52] that were ever went into the ground
[1:01:55] that was ever going to be manifested to
[1:01:57] the glory of god
[1:01:59] god knew all those seeds god planted all
[1:02:02] those seeds by his spoken word
[1:02:05] every last one
[1:02:11] see we find that
[1:02:13] there is pardon me therefore he created
[1:02:15] by his word he sent his word
[1:02:18] so all the seeds that he had placed upon
[1:02:21] the earth he formed those seeds by his
[1:02:24] own word
[1:02:25] for there was
[1:02:26] no nothing else for to to make the seed
[1:02:29] out of see he had placed them and they
[1:02:32] were beneath the water water he just
[1:02:35] said let there be this and let there be
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:38] now we find many times it looks like
[1:02:40] that bible repeating itself or something
[1:02:42] and so on he says
[1:02:44] in genesis we find that god created man
[1:02:46] in his own image in the image of god
[1:02:49] created he him male and female created
[1:02:52] he them
[1:02:53] and then he goes on and many things
[1:02:55] happened upon the earth
[1:02:58] and he says then we come to find out
[1:03:01] that there was no man to till the soil
[1:03:06] no man to till the soil
[1:03:09] then god created man out of the dust of
[1:03:11] the earth
[1:03:12] that was a different man he says and he
[1:03:15] breathes the spirit of life into him and
[1:03:17] he became a living soul
[1:03:19] he said the first man was in the image
[1:03:21] of god which is spirit
[1:03:24] john 4 says god is a spirit and dead and
[1:03:27] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:03:28] and in truth but god is a spirit and the
[1:03:31] first man that he created was spirit man
[1:03:34] see
[1:03:35] and he was in the image and in the
[1:03:37] likeness of god
[1:03:38] and then he put this man in flesh
[1:03:41] and man fell so then god came down
[1:03:44] and became in the image of man
[1:03:48] that he might redeem that fallen man
[1:03:51] god came down
[1:03:53] see
[1:03:54] he says that's the real gospel story to
[1:03:57] my in my opinion
[1:03:59] to my opinion you know
[1:04:01] and all that all the time when god
[1:04:05] the seven days that god was
[1:04:09] making everything to his liking
[1:04:12] all that going on
[1:04:15] and on on the seventh day
[1:04:18] he was all done
[1:04:20] and then god's rested and it was good in
[1:04:22] his sight
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:25] it was good in his sight
[1:04:27] you know and
[1:04:29] before sin ever came into the world
[1:04:31] brothers and sisters
[1:04:33] he had adam there
[1:04:35] he had adam's
[1:04:36] beautiful little wife
[1:04:38] there
[1:04:39] in the garden
[1:04:41] and every day god came by
[1:04:43] in the cool of the evening and they had
[1:04:45] fellowship
[1:04:46] and they had perfect fellowship
[1:04:50] because there was no sin in the garden
[1:04:52] at the time
[1:04:55] there was no sin just think of it i
[1:04:56] don't know how many years that condition
[1:04:58] went on for
[1:05:01] maybe nobody knows that i don't know but
[1:05:03] you know for however many years
[1:05:06] god had that perfect
[1:05:11] event happening
[1:05:13] every day where he came down in the cool
[1:05:15] of the evening and he fellowship with
[1:05:17] adam and eve
[1:05:18] and he fellowship with all his
[1:05:20] creation amen amen
[1:05:24] what got lost a lot got lost

[1:05:30] death came
[1:05:32] after sin came in the garden
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:44] now god in 6 000 years had planted all
[1:05:47] these wonderful seeds
[1:05:49] or he had spoke his word
[1:05:51] it shall be this way this tree shall be
[1:05:53] this this shall be everything was
[1:05:56] perfect it was just good and he
[1:05:58] commanded each one of those seeds that
[1:06:01] they would be
[1:06:03] they would transform themselves into the
[1:06:05] plant of which kind of life that was the
[1:06:07] word of god had spoken in them should be
[1:06:10] see
[1:06:11] it was an if it was an oak tree or or to
[1:06:14] bring forth of an oak it was a palm tree
[1:06:16] was to bring forth a palm
[1:06:18] he says
[1:06:19] because the great creator had just sent
[1:06:23] forth his word
[1:06:26] he had sent forth his word
[1:06:29] see
[1:06:30] and the word seed was there
[1:06:32] before the real seed was ever formed
[1:06:36] the word seed
[1:06:38] was there before the real the
[1:06:42] before the real seed was ever formed and
[1:06:44] the word formed the seed see he made the
[1:06:48] world out of things that does not appear
[1:06:51] see he made the world
[1:06:53] by his word god spoke everything into
[1:06:58] existence amen and being god the creator
[1:07:01] speaking all things into existence it

[1:08:48] headquarters and and a church has a
[1:08:50] headquarters and god has a headquarters

[1:09:35] you who were sometimes
[1:09:37] darkness
[1:09:38] we were sometimes darkness
[1:09:40] we were sometimes in chaos
[1:09:44] we were sometimes void of understanding
[1:09:47] we were void of anything that was good
[1:09:50] but god one day
[1:09:54] you know
[1:09:55] we we wonder how can god save us sinner
[1:09:58] we we think the wrong way sometimes
[1:10:01] god came to save sinners
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:07] greet saul in the book of acts
[1:10:09] you know
[1:10:11] high up on his horror high horse
[1:10:13] down the road charge saul right the
[1:10:17] pharisee of the pharisees the most
[1:10:19] zealous of them all
[1:10:21] but a fall in the dust and the pillar of
[1:10:25] fire
[1:10:26] made him humble as can be
[1:10:29] we can warn out god turned them about
[1:10:32] and set him in christ to stay hallelujah
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:37] that's what he did to us
[1:10:39] amen that's right
[1:10:41] amen praise the lord that's what he did
[1:10:43] to us
[1:10:45] and you're not here for a moment
[1:10:48] you're not here for a while
[1:10:50] you're here for eternity
[1:10:54] eternity
[1:10:56] soon eternity will unfold
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:01] the dead in christ shall rise first and
[1:11:04] we which are alive and remain
[1:11:07] shall be caught up together to meet him
[1:11:10] in the air amen
[1:11:12] hallelujah
[1:11:23] god made him a
[1:11:24] helpmate out of his own body perhaps a
[1:11:27] rib over his heart he says
[1:11:30] so she would be close to him
[1:11:33] and made him a helpmate
[1:11:37] he says it really wasn't his wife as yet
[1:11:40] no more than it was man as yet he had
[1:11:42] just spoke it
[1:11:44] and there is where the trouble comes see
[1:11:46] satan found her before adam did
[1:11:48] so it was just his word he had spoken
[1:11:53] he said i don't want to spend too much
[1:11:55] time on it but some of you might get
[1:11:57] confused especially some of the people
[1:12:00] out of the south seem to find such a
[1:12:02] little confusing out of the message that
[1:12:04] i have from god today
[1:12:06] to the people of that about uh serpent
[1:12:08] seat see and i'm going to go home the
[1:12:11] lord willing one of these days to
[1:12:12] jeffersonville i want to
[1:12:14] want to
[1:12:16] better make about a six-hour message and
[1:12:19] straighten that all out
[1:12:21] i don't think he ever got around to
[1:12:22] doing that
[1:12:25] but it's all there it's all in the
[1:12:26] church ages it's all in the seals it's
[1:12:29] all been revealed it just wasn't put
[1:12:31] into a
[1:12:32] one
[1:12:34] sermon you know brother branham
[1:12:37] in december
[1:12:41] 1965
[1:12:43] which is when he went off the scene
[1:12:46] he's still out there
[1:12:47] on the field
[1:12:49] with the full gospel businessmen
[1:12:52] go into all the world
[1:12:55] and preach the gospel
[1:12:58] jesus went wherever he was invited
[1:13:02] even into simon's house
[1:13:08] think about it
[1:13:10] that prophet of god
[1:13:13] sitting in the back room
[1:13:16] and preachers out at the pulpit saying
[1:13:18] brother branham can come tonight
[1:13:25] and there he is right there
[1:13:34] he was a humble man
[1:13:42] he went he went through the fiery
[1:13:44] furnace
[1:13:46] like everyone else has to go
[1:13:50] test and tried
[1:13:51] god's people
[1:13:53] will always be tested and tried
[1:13:56] we don't ever have to worry about that
[1:13:58] it's going to happen
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:05] see
[1:14:11] thank you
[1:14:15] he says if somebody would come to
[1:14:18] to me
[1:14:20] something contrary
[1:14:22] with something contrary i would kind of
[1:14:24] misunderstand it maybe myself
[1:14:27] i wouldn't want to criticize what anyone
[1:14:30] else says
[1:14:31] see we're not to criticize each other
[1:14:34] i'm not guilty of doing that he says i
[1:14:36] thank the lord i have criticized sin and
[1:14:39] unbelief
[1:14:40] but no individual person see
[1:14:43] i don't
[1:14:46] it says we are brothers and sisters
[1:14:47] striving we are coming down
[1:14:50] to where sister florence came
[1:14:52] yesterday morning say she passed away
[1:14:55] we all got to come that way and it's not
[1:14:58] it's not my purpose to
[1:15:00] to try to criticize a brother or sister
[1:15:03] that wouldn't agree with you see
[1:15:06] no it's be far from me to do that he
[1:15:09] says i don't think you'll ever find a
[1:15:11] tape that i ever called anybody's name
[1:15:13] on which i have felt that many times
[1:15:16] the person may be wrong but that's
[1:15:18] between them and god
[1:15:20] but what is wrong is the way of sin and
[1:15:22] misunderstanding
[1:15:25] sometimes is not even sin it's just a
[1:15:27] misunderstanding of people
[1:15:30] sometimes it's not sin it's just a
[1:15:32] misunderstanding of people
[1:15:34] and i think each of us has a right to
[1:15:36] express ourselves to our understanding
[1:15:41] now this great creator had placed his
[1:15:43] created son
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:46] now adam was his first created son
[1:15:49] jesus was his only begotten son
[1:15:52] see
[1:15:53] he was begotten by a woman but adam was
[1:15:56] right straight from the hand of god in
[1:15:58] the creation
[1:16:00] now the headquarters with his son and
[1:16:02] his son's bride overall
[1:16:04] it looks so perfect
[1:16:06] there was a man ahead of it all
[1:16:09] his own son and his bride
[1:16:12] and every seed
[1:16:14] s-e-e-d was perfect the palms the oaks
[1:16:18] the grass the birds the animals and
[1:16:20] everything
[1:16:21] was in perfect order with the
[1:16:23] commandment of god
[1:16:25] don't change your nature
[1:16:27] he says bring forth of its kind see it
[1:16:30] doesn't change in nature bring forth of
[1:16:31] his kind every seed see
[1:16:34] oak don't you never be perverted into a
[1:16:36] pawpaw tree see
[1:16:39] palm don't you ever be perverted into
[1:16:42] something else but every seed after his
[1:16:45] kind
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:48] and that's what god doesn't want us to
[1:16:49] do he's made us
[1:16:51] his sons and daughters
[1:16:53] right and he's brought his word to us
[1:16:57] through the scriptures through the
[1:16:58] revealing of the son of man the son of
[1:17:01] man in our day
[1:17:03] he's brought that all forward that we
[1:17:05] can walk in the light as he is in the
[1:17:08] light amen because he is the light of
[1:17:10] the world
[1:17:11] and the light of the world
[1:17:13] my brothers and sisters
[1:17:16] is the message of the hour
[1:17:18] for us
[1:17:20] right it may not be somebody else's
[1:17:24] but it's ours
[1:17:27] we were called for this yes
[1:17:32] we were called to fulfill
[1:17:34] this role
[1:17:46] and he said he had spoken his word his
[1:17:48] great creating power had formed those
[1:17:51] things that came up
[1:17:56] and even the man and the woman
[1:17:59] and they were head because they were
[1:18:02] super to all the other races and he put
[1:18:04] them also
[1:18:06] under a care of the same thing that he
[1:18:08] put trees
[1:18:10] animals and so forth
[1:18:12] his word
[1:18:15] his word everything was under his word
[1:18:18] see
[1:18:19] that must never
[1:18:21] never by no means
[1:18:24] break that word
[1:18:26] they must never
[1:18:28] must never
[1:18:29] never break that word they must stay
[1:18:31] there
[1:18:32] don't never take anything from it or add
[1:18:35] anything to it see you must live by that
[1:18:38] word
[1:18:39] by this word
[1:18:40] and as long as this creation would have
[1:18:43] existed like that
[1:18:45] he says as long as this creation in the
[1:18:48] perfect eden in the perfect garden is as
[1:18:50] long as it would have existed like that
[1:18:53] sister chakarian would have
[1:18:56] wouldn't have had to have went this
[1:18:58] morning as long as it would have stayed
[1:19:00] that way god's great economy
[1:19:03] is what we believe that we're headed
[1:19:05] back to
[1:19:06] see we're going back to that spot
[1:19:10] we're going back to that spot that place
[1:19:14] he says where
[1:19:16] he says that seventh morning when god
[1:19:18] looked upon it all and he said it's good
[1:19:22] i am pleased with it yes
[1:19:24] i am glad i did it and it's all
[1:19:27] now under control
[1:19:29] and i have put trust in my son
[1:19:32] and his wife that they will
[1:19:37] and make them head of it all
[1:19:39] of it all that they will watch over it
[1:19:41] all that it's all right that everything
[1:19:42] will bring forth of its kind
[1:19:45] now he has the power to do that god then
[1:19:47] said
[1:19:48] well if it's all good and it can't be
[1:19:50] anything else because
[1:19:52] it's my own desire
[1:19:55] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:19:58] it's my own desire it's the way i want
[1:20:00] it
[1:20:01] and i have spoken that way and my words
[1:20:04] has brought it just exactly the way i
[1:20:06] wanted it
[1:20:08] and there it is
[1:20:09] it's all good so the bible said god
[1:20:12] rested the seventh day
[1:20:14] from all of his work
[1:20:17] set back i wrote down sat back
[1:20:20] and admired
[1:20:22] what the word what his word had produced
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] you know it's not
[1:20:29] it wouldn't be proud
[1:20:31] or it wouldn't be boastful
[1:20:34] it wouldn't be those things if you would
[1:20:35] take a look at yourself in the mirror
[1:20:39] i mean there's lots of reasons for
[1:20:41] looking in the mirror
[1:20:43] sometimes we don't want to look in the
[1:20:44] mirror but if we can look into the
[1:20:47] mirror of god's word
[1:20:49] amen and see and realize and appreciate
[1:20:53] what god has done in our lives brothers
[1:20:56] and sisters
[1:20:57] the world that we live in
[1:20:59] if you were to compare that to the world
[1:21:01] that we live in
[1:21:03] i went and visited my family they live
[1:21:06] in a totally different world than a
[1:21:07] world i live in amen
[1:21:10] although we're on the same earth but
[1:21:12] we're in a different world
[1:21:16] totally different
[1:21:25] he says and everything under control to
[1:21:27] bring forth of its kind
[1:21:30] now remember
[1:21:31] to bring
[1:21:32] to bring when he put the seed in the
[1:21:35] earth
[1:21:36] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:21:38] power of life within it
[1:21:41] see to transform it
[1:21:43] from a seed to a plant
[1:21:47] it's amazing
[1:21:49] you know that little small seed
[1:21:52] and you plant it
[1:21:53] and then you next summer and you see a
[1:21:56] little
[1:21:58] small tree
[1:22:00] this big coming out here
[1:22:03] and then
[1:22:04] five years later if you're in bc
[1:22:07] well it's probably the height of the
[1:22:08] pulpit
[1:22:10] you know
[1:22:12] depending on what
[1:22:14] you know vegetation is there for it and
[1:22:16] what minerals are in the ground
[1:22:18] but they grow
[1:22:20] and and everything that was in that seed
[1:22:23] everything that was in that seed the
[1:22:24] life that was in that seed is that great
[1:22:27] big oak tree
[1:22:28] from that one little seed
[1:22:31] wow
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:43] we are the word made flesh today
[1:22:47] this is what the scripture says
[1:22:50] our names are seen
[1:22:52] redeemed
[1:22:54] i don't know the whole song
[1:22:56] i'd need music to sing that
[1:22:59] redeemed and perfect
[1:23:02] without sin
[1:23:04] yes we are anointed
[1:23:07] and inspired
[1:23:10] the original seed
[1:23:12] the original word
[1:23:14] is what i believe
[1:23:16] the original life
[1:23:20] the original life
[1:23:23] amen not the new life
[1:23:26] the original life
[1:23:28] that produced a new life
[1:23:29] the original seed that produced a new
[1:23:32] life how's that
[1:23:38] he said everything under control to
[1:23:40] bring forth of its kind
[1:23:42] i read some of that already
[1:23:46] he says when he put the seed in the
[1:23:48] earth the seed can only come forth with
[1:23:51] the power of life within it to transform
[1:23:53] it from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[1:23:55] was
[1:23:56] his transforming power
[1:24:00] his transforming power
[1:24:02] now god put the seed in there with
[1:24:04] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:24:07] it would be
[1:24:09] as long as it stayed in its right
[1:24:10] category
[1:24:12] see it would be just exactly what god
[1:24:14] said it would be
[1:24:16] it had to be that way
[1:24:19] because he had made it that way
[1:24:21] and made a channel
[1:24:23] that anything that stays in his channel
[1:24:26] in his channel
[1:24:28] see in his line of word
[1:24:31] it will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:24:35] his word said it would do
[1:24:37] cannot move from there
[1:24:39] see it's channeled just exactly right
[1:24:43] so with everything in the trust in his
[1:24:45] own son
[1:24:46] that it would be that way then god said
[1:24:49] it's all good amen amen
[1:24:52] it's all good amen
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] we tell our wives
[1:25:00] we have a
[1:25:02] your wife serve you that perfect meal
[1:25:05] oh it's so good honey
[1:25:07] it's so good i got to go back and get
[1:25:09] seconds
[1:25:11] and sometimes i got to go back and get
[1:25:12] thirds
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:16] and that's all right
[1:25:18] she feels good when i go get thirds
[1:25:23] and i feel
[1:25:24] good and then i go take a nap
[1:25:28] after thirds
[1:25:32] praise god
[1:25:34] he said
[1:25:39] it's channeled just exactly right so
[1:25:41] with everything in the trust in his own
[1:25:43] son that it would be that way then god
[1:25:46] said it's all good
[1:25:48] so i'll just rest and each one of those
[1:25:51] seeds has power in itself to transform
[1:25:54] itself into the species that i desire it
[1:25:57] to be
[1:25:59] see that's what it must be because i
[1:26:02] have given every seed
[1:26:04] transforming power to make out of itself
[1:26:07] in its potentials now to make it of
[1:26:09] itself exactly what i want it to be
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:15] some are deacons
[1:26:18] some are preachers
[1:26:20] some are pastors some are prophets
[1:26:23] some are congregation
[1:26:26] some are helpers
[1:26:32] but all god's
[1:26:34] seed with different gifts
[1:26:39] god has never changed just the same
[1:26:41] today as he was then
[1:26:43] god is determined to do something he'll
[1:26:46] do it nothing is going to stop him he'll
[1:26:48] do it
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:51] god has never changed i just read that
[1:26:54] now after all it
[1:26:56] after it's all so well and set in order
[1:26:58] god feel sure that this would be all
[1:27:00] right
[1:27:01] and then when he did then came the enemy
[1:27:05] god gave power to transform
[1:27:07] and i'm going and he says i'm going to
[1:27:10] call this fellow with power
[1:27:12] uh
[1:27:13] he had power to deform not transform but
[1:27:16] to deform now anything's deformed is
[1:27:19] taken away from its original state
[1:27:22] there is something that's gone wrong
[1:27:24] with it
[1:27:26] the way of the world today because of
[1:27:28] that
[1:27:30] see and we're still in the image of god
[1:27:34] but some are so deformed as sons of god
[1:27:38] that walk contrary to his word
[1:27:41] and
[1:27:42] and in the way
[1:27:44] that he had us and provided for us to
[1:27:46] walk see
[1:27:48] setting something the world twists us
[1:27:51] out of the way
[1:27:52] pulls us close to it
[1:27:54] and away from that straight narrow strip
[1:27:57] that he planted us in to be sons and
[1:27:59] daughters of god
[1:28:01] sin has done this evil thing to the sons
[1:28:03] and daughters of god
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:07] amen so
[1:28:09] he said the deformer i know this seems
[1:28:12] to be rather strange to speak it this
[1:28:14] way to deform but that's what he was
[1:28:18] he deformed or perverted perverted means
[1:28:21] to be changed over and made something
[1:28:23] different and deform is the same thing
[1:28:26] that that has been brought over and
[1:28:28] deformed and made in another way
[1:28:31] yet it's still the same seed but it's
[1:28:33] deformed see
[1:28:35] back there a page or so back he was
[1:28:36] talking about the corn that grew up
[1:28:38] amongst the twisters and so on
[1:28:40] and how it got deformed see but it was
[1:28:43] still corn but it was deformed corn
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:47] and we're not we're not deformed
[1:28:50] we're we're the the
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] the seed that's planted on the good
[1:28:56] ground
[1:28:57] brought bring forth much fruit amen
[1:29:01] in its season
[1:29:02] that's what we want to be
[1:29:14] and he goes on here and i'm skipping
[1:29:16] some pages here
[1:29:18] some some paragraphs
[1:29:21] he says now it's hard to say this it's
[1:29:24] very hard
[1:29:25] because
[1:29:26] speaking to people who feel the same way
[1:29:28] i do and the way i have
[1:29:31] been for so many years but since the
[1:29:33] opening of those seven seals
[1:29:36] of them angels just behind the mountain
[1:29:38] yonder
[1:29:39] this has become a new book
[1:29:42] it's the things that's been hid
[1:29:45] is being revealed as god promised in
[1:29:48] revelation 10.
[1:29:50] see
[1:29:51] he would do it
[1:29:52] and we are the privileged people that
[1:29:55] god has chosen of the earth
[1:29:57] that we might see
[1:29:59] and understand these things
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:05] might see and understand these things
[1:30:07] where would we be
[1:30:09] i mean
[1:30:11] we would be so confused
[1:30:13] we'd be like that
[1:30:15] bouncing ball in the bingo thing you
[1:30:16] know what i mean where all those balls
[1:30:18] are bouncing up and down
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:22] unless god
[1:30:26] did something for us
[1:30:29] bring bring the word back
[1:30:33] to the faith of the apostles what they
[1:30:35] had back then
[1:30:37] unless god restored us back brothers and
[1:30:39] sisters we were toast
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:52] praise jesus
[1:30:55] we are the privileged people that god
[1:30:57] has chosen of the earth that we might
[1:30:59] see and understand these things
[1:31:02] which is not some mythical fleshly mind
[1:31:05] of a person trying to make it up it's
[1:31:07] the word of god made manifest
[1:31:10] proving that is right
[1:31:12] proven not by science but by god that is
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:19] god as i have said before in the message
[1:31:22] god doesn't need anyone to interpret his
[1:31:24] word he is his own
[1:31:26] interpreter he says says it'll happen
[1:31:30] and it'll happen
[1:31:33] he confirms it that interprets it
[1:31:44] praise god
[1:31:58] i'm just going to stop
[1:32:00] there
[1:32:08] god bless you
[1:32:16] we can sing a little choruses there

[1:39:47] jonathan and maybe our brother mark
[1:39:50] and for the journal
[1:39:52] to minister amen but we thank the lord
[1:39:55] for the word
[1:39:57] brother i tell you that this again to
[1:39:59] many
[1:40:00] this is just a bible
[1:40:02] but to the bride it's the word
[1:40:05] hallelujah well they think well yeah god
[1:40:07] ordained them to write this god ordained
[1:40:09] to write that and so on to a lot of them
[1:40:11] it's just history it's a history book
[1:40:14] but for us it's not
[1:40:16] it is the revelation of god his his plan
[1:40:19] his purpose and his pattern oh my this
[1:40:23] is why that we're here tonight and and
[1:40:25] and well the believers are getting fewer
[1:40:28] and fewer and fewer and that's why that
[1:40:30] that jesus said when the son of man
[1:40:31] comes will he find faith on the earth
[1:40:34] why because the faith comes by the by
[1:40:37] the word
[1:40:38] but to them it's just a a bible and the
[1:40:41] bible is just a history book
[1:40:43] well that's that's the truth they think
[1:40:45] it's a history of what god did
[1:40:47] in genesis and on down you know
[1:40:50] the old testament and the new testament
[1:40:52] it's just god did this god did that and
[1:40:54] god said this and god said that but they
[1:40:57] they
[1:40:58] they they failed to recognize and
[1:40:59] realize wow it's the god that did it
[1:41:02] there it's the same god that's that's
[1:41:04] that's revealing it here amen praise the
[1:41:07] lord oh brother just think that this
[1:41:10] that we come from eternity
[1:41:12] and it goes back to eternity praise the
[1:41:14] lord our brother was bringing it out to
[1:41:16] but
[1:41:18] we were with god in the beginning amen
[1:41:21] we come from god in the beginning we
[1:41:23] come from eternity and brother by the
[1:41:25] grace of god by the word of god we're
[1:41:28] going back to eternity hallelujah and
[1:41:30] many just don't recognize it or they
[1:41:33] recognize oh well you know jesus did
[1:41:35] this and we're saved so we just we
[1:41:38] believe what the bible said well but
[1:41:40] again it's just the bible
[1:41:42] it's just a religious book but not the
[1:41:44] word of god and brother again oh well i
[1:41:47] got faith my brother without this you
[1:41:49] can't have faith
[1:41:51] no faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[1:41:53] word
[1:41:54] amen and without that faith it's
[1:41:56] impossible to please him
[1:41:58] oh brother it's got to be according to
[1:42:00] the the will of god
[1:42:02] and the purpose of god amen again as i
[1:42:05] said
[1:42:06] that god challenged cain
[1:42:08] and and
[1:42:10] because why cain he had faith because
[1:42:14] look look at the sacrifice here he
[1:42:16] offered
[1:42:16] oh my maybe it may be a greater
[1:42:19] sacrifice than most of us would you know
[1:42:21] when it comes to what cain offered oh my
[1:42:24] he had a large sacrifice and not only
[1:42:27] that it looked nice
[1:42:29] but but abel as i said abel oh
[1:42:33] hey what did he have he had a sacrifice
[1:42:35] and what it was his heartbeat it was it
[1:42:37] was a dead lamb
[1:42:39] you killed the lamb abel what'd you do
[1:42:41] that for
[1:42:42] you know just
[1:42:44] and again as i said about uh solomon
[1:42:47] i preached it here a number of years ago
[1:42:48] and and i remember that all of the
[1:42:50] corettes were there and i know that
[1:42:53] brother lanny was there
[1:42:54] uh our brother jonathan's father and and
[1:42:57] he had two or three
[1:42:59] visitors with him
[1:43:00] and i was preaching and i was talking
[1:43:02] about solomon and now he rebuilt the
[1:43:04] temple and he redid this redid that and
[1:43:07] i and he and he had this many thousand
[1:43:10] lambs
[1:43:11] this many thousand sacrifices and this
[1:43:13] many for this and for that and i said
[1:43:16] well when i read it i said thank the
[1:43:18] lord i said that there was what was that
[1:43:20] group
[1:43:22] greenpeace i said thank the lord i said
[1:43:24] greenpeace wasn't there
[1:43:25] i said because i said solomon wouldn't
[1:43:28] wouldn't be able to do what he did
[1:43:30] i said they would they wouldn't want
[1:43:31] solomon to kill all those thousands of
[1:43:33] lambs all those thousands of sheep and
[1:43:35] all this and all that not by any means
[1:43:37] because they're the greenpeace with even
[1:43:39] we're doing what they're out there
[1:43:40] trying to
[1:43:42] trying to stop the fishery don't do this
[1:43:44] don't do that and and the seals and all
[1:43:46] of that oh
[1:43:48] brother what would they do
[1:43:50] if they were back here of the old
[1:43:52] testament
[1:43:53] whether
[1:43:54] they they would be legalists
[1:43:56] but certainly they wouldn't they would
[1:43:57] go with the word
[1:43:59] amen and and that struck the her brother
[1:44:02] lanny and the two or three visitors that
[1:44:05] he had with him and and they
[1:44:07] they never heard that before when it
[1:44:08] comes to the word amen oh yeah but i
[1:44:12] don't think they'll ever forget it and
[1:44:13] again it's like i said too i preached it
[1:44:16] years ago and i and i talked about i
[1:44:18] said cain's church versus the abel's
[1:44:20] church
[1:44:21] and i said which church would you go to
[1:44:24] i said most would go to cain's church
[1:44:26] i said because that's what they do i
[1:44:28] said on thanksgiving day
[1:44:30] you know i said oh they'll lay
[1:44:32] everything on the altar lay this on the
[1:44:34] altar thank god for this thank god for
[1:44:36] that
[1:44:37] but brother
[1:44:38] what about god's altar
[1:44:41] not yours but god's amen and brother
[1:44:45] as abel the bloody lamb
[1:44:47] right cain didn't like it
[1:44:49] but again brother i tell you this god
[1:44:52] came down and laid down his life and
[1:44:54] shed his blood
[1:44:55] amen we've got to preach the same thing
[1:44:57] by the grace of god
[1:44:59] amen
