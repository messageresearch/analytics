[38:04] something special
[38:08] to [music] reveal his majesty.
[38:14] So I know [singing]
[38:15] if I [music]
[38:17] give him control
[38:21] He'll be born in [music and singing] me.
[38:25] Let your
[38:28] word [music]
[38:30] be [singing] born
[38:33] in the ve of my heart.
[38:40] Let [music]
[38:40] it live in me.
[38:44] Let [singing] it start.
[38:47] [music]
[38:50] Live inside [singing]
[38:52] this [music]
[38:53] house of clay
[38:56] and mold [singing] it every
[39:00] day. Yes, Lord.
[39:03] Let your word be [singing] born [music]
[39:08] in the manger
[39:10] [music]
[39:11] of my heart.
[39:18] Amen.
[39:20] Outwardly
[39:22] I'm nothing.
[39:25] Not much to behold. [music]
[39:31] our life [singing]
[39:33] be a place hallelujah
[39:37] &gt;&gt; for his word to unfold let's stand
[39:43] but if [music and singing] I just yield
[39:45] this vessel
[39:49] just [singing and music] let him have
[39:51] his way
[39:55] from glory unto [singing] glory [music]
[40:00] he'll Change me day by day. [music]
[40:07] Lay
[40:08] on.
[40:10] Hallelujah.
[40:12] [music] Be born
[40:15] in the [singing] angel of my [music]
[40:18] heart. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; And live in me.
[40:26] Let [singing] it die.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:32] &gt;&gt; live inside [singing]
[40:33] this house of pain [music]
[40:38] and mold it in every [singing and music]
[40:41] day. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:48] [music]
[40:49] In the manger.
[40:54] Amen. Sing that again. Let your word,
[40:58] let your [singing]
[41:01] word [music]
[41:04] be born
[41:07] in the manger [music]
[41:08] of [singing]
[41:09] my heart.
[41:13] Let it
[41:18] [music]
[41:24] &gt;&gt; live inside [music] this house of faith
[41:30] and hold it every day.
[41:35] [music]
[41:36] Let your word be born [singing]
[41:41] in the [music] manger
[41:45] of
[41:46] my [singing]
[41:48] heart.
[41:52] Lord Jesus,
[41:54] Lord, I want to thank you for your grace
[41:55] this morning. Lord, I want to thank you
[41:58] for this song service, Lord, for this
[41:59] people that's gathered. Lord, I want to
[42:02] thank you, Lord, that we've got
[42:03] something in our hearts to worship and
[42:05] praise you [music] about, Lord, that
[42:07] there's something on the inside, Lord,
[42:08] that wants to express, Lord, our
[42:10] thanksgiving [music] to you, Lord. Thank
[42:13] you for all that you are. Thank you for
[42:14] all that you've done. Thank you for your
[42:17] promises, Lord, that we can rest upon
[42:18] this morning, Lord. Thank you that we
[42:21] have a word that will change us, that'll
[42:23] draw us back to you, that'll restore us,
[42:25] that'll redeem us, heavenly father.
[42:28] Lord, we're in a special place this
[42:30] morning, Lord, that we can receive your
[42:31] word, Lord, and that it'll produce
[42:33] itself in our lives. [music] So, Lord,
[42:35] we're asking you once again, Lord, that
[42:38] the Holy Ghost would take the service,
[42:43] Lord, that you would minister to the
[42:45] [music] sheep of your flock,
[42:48] Lord. That your bride would leave these
[42:51] doors, this building this morning, Lord,
[42:54] changed a little bit more into your
[42:55] likeness, [music] heavenly father. Lord,
[42:58] help us to willingly lay down those
[42:59] things that hold us back. Lord, those
[43:02] things we're trying to control, those
[43:03] things we're trying to resolve.
[43:06] Lord, let us step freely, Lord, into the
[43:08] hands of your grace, your mercy, your
[43:10] your provision.
[43:12] Lord, let us recognize you are our all
[43:14] and all this morning. We pray, heavenly
[43:16] father. Lord, we're trusting you.
[43:18] [music] We commit all these things into
[43:19] your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we
[43:21] pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn
[43:24] if you would to Psalms [snorts] chapter
[43:27] 105. Psalms 105 this morning. It's good
[43:29] to be back and then from my trip to
[43:31] Calgary. Certainly came back tired, but
[43:34] by God's grace, I've gotten on the time
[43:35] zone pretty quickly. I've had good
[43:37] sleep, so that's helping me recover
[43:39] quickly. And then appreciate Brother
[43:41] Mark and Brother Garfield taking the
[43:42] services. I got good reports from both
[43:45] of them. I was able to listen to Brother
[43:46] Mark's live even as I was flying on
[43:49] Sunday. Unfortunately, Brother Garfield
[43:51] started when I was at work and I didn't
[43:52] get home till almost 11:00 our time. So,
[43:54] I've only had a chance to listen to a
[43:56] bit of it. But I again, good reports and
[43:58] and people following up with me. So, God
[44:00] bless you both for doing that. Certainly
[44:02] appreciate it. Amen. I enjoyed the song
[44:05] service this morning is very good,
[44:06] Sister Nikki. That's a wonderful
[44:07] special. One of my favorite songs. Amen.
[44:09] To stand justified knowing you don't
[44:11] deserve it. Knowing what you've done and
[44:15] yet standing justified. Amen. What a
[44:18] wonderful thought. Amen. I certainly
[44:20] appreciate that. Uh just remember as
[44:22] brother Joe sent out a email this
[44:24] morning, we'll have communion on Sunday,
[44:26] November 23. That's two weeks out from
[44:29] now. Also remember we've got the
[44:30] Christmas program December 7th and each
[44:32] family has been asked to participate by
[44:35] song or by by playing something or
[44:37] reciting something, a spiritual dance
[44:40] perhaps, whatever the Lord lays on your
[44:41] heart. But remember that and you can
[44:43] talk to the different musicians. Uh
[44:46] preferably not all for Sister Priscil if
[44:48] you remember, but we've got Lydia here
[44:50] and Selena and Levi and brother Paul
[44:54] perhaps and these different ones. So
[44:55] spread it around if we could and that'll
[44:57] be a wonderful time. Amen. And then
[44:59] we've got Jamaica, uh the saints in
[45:01] Jamaica. We want to remember those. I've
[45:03] been in contact with some brothers about
[45:04] that over the last couple of weeks. And
[45:06] so we're going to take up an offering
[45:08] for them over the next week or two. I'll
[45:10] be working with brother Mark to to
[45:11] arrange and brother Garfield to arrange
[45:13] us to send some money over there to
[45:15] help. They are in desperate need for
[45:16] sure. And we're gathered here in this
[45:18] big beautiful building with a solid roof
[45:20] and heat and air conditioning and
[45:22] they're working in buildings that have
[45:24] had the roofs torn off and they've just
[45:25] got a tarp over them today while they
[45:27] have service and equipment that's been
[45:29] damaged or destroyed and these different
[45:30] things. Amen. We can we can certainly
[45:33] support them in some way. So, we'll pray
[45:35] that the Lord will put something on your
[45:37] heart to give to them and we'll we'll
[45:39] send out a formal announcement and then
[45:40] brother Mark and myself and brother
[45:41] Garfield will be managing that as well.
[45:44] Amen. Psalms chapter 105, [snorts]
[45:48] it says, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord.
[45:51] Call upon his name. Make known his deeds
[45:53] among the people. Sing unto him. Sing
[45:56] songs unto him. Talk ye of all his
[45:58] wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy
[46:01] name. Let the heart of them rejoice that
[46:03] seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his
[46:05] strength. Seek his face ever more.
[46:08] Remember his marvelous works that he
[46:10] hath done. His wonders and the judgments
[46:12] of his mouth. Oh ye seed of Abraham his
[46:14] servant. Ye children of Jacob his
[46:17] chosen. He is the Lord our God. His
[46:20] judgments are in all the earth. He hath
[46:22] remembered his covenant forever. The
[46:24] word which he commanded to a thousand
[46:27] generations. Amen. God bless you. You
[46:29] can have your seats this morning. And
[46:31] I'm excited to be back this morning. and
[46:33] excited to be back in the house of the
[46:34] Lord. It's It's funny how that works.
[46:36] Sometimes you just can't hardly wait for
[46:38] your break and then you get the break
[46:39] and you just can't hardly wait to get
[46:40] out of your break and back into the
[46:42] saddle. Amen. I believe that's the
[46:43] calling of God that does that is is is
[46:46] yours just there's always something
[46:47] that's pushing and and pulling sometimes
[46:49] to get you there. But I've had this
[46:51] service on my heart for quite some time.
[46:52] We're not starting a new series. This is
[46:54] a standalone service. And I want to take
[46:56] a title this morning of the day of your
[46:59] word. Amen. The day of your word. And we
[47:01] open with this beautiful Psalm of David
[47:03] where he's talking and he's saying,
[47:04] "Give thanks and glorify the Lord and
[47:07] seek his face and seek his strength and
[47:10] bless his name and and let your heart
[47:12] rejoice in the uh when you seek the Lord
[47:14] in these different things." And God has
[47:16] given us a portion, amen, that we're
[47:18] supposed to do. God's given us a work
[47:20] that's supposed to do and we're supposed
[47:22] to be seeking him. We're supposed to be
[47:23] worshiping him. We're supposed to be
[47:25] praising him. We're supposed to be
[47:26] glorifying him. Everything that our life
[47:28] is is supposed to reflect our Lord and
[47:31] our Savior. Amen. And we've got
[47:32] something to do. Amen. Is to magnify
[47:34] Jesus Christ through our words, through
[47:36] our life, through our deeds, through our
[47:38] families, through our work, whatever it
[47:40] may be. But I want to focus on that last
[47:42] bit that we finish with in verse number
[47:44] seven this morning as we continue
[47:46] through. And we'll be preaching out of
[47:47] this the entire morning. And he says,
[47:49] "He is the Lord our God." Amen. His
[47:53] judgments are in all the earth. He has
[47:55] remembered his covenant forever, the
[47:58] word which he commanded to a thousand
[48:00] generations. And we look at this and in
[48:02] verse nine it's going to say that
[48:04] covenant he made with Abraham. But
[48:05] church, you got to see this is with the
[48:07] family of God. This is with the faith
[48:10] seed of Abraham, the royal seed of
[48:11] Abraham. We are we are a part of this
[48:14] covenant, not by bloodline, but we are
[48:16] covenant by a faith seed, a faith gene
[48:18] inside of us that God placed there
[48:20] before the foundation of the world that
[48:22] we could hear the word. We could
[48:24] identify with the word. We could believe
[48:26] the word. We could receive the word. And
[48:28] we could have the word expressed inside
[48:29] of our lives. That's what we are this
[48:31] morning. Amen. We are Abraham's children
[48:33] by faith, not by bloodline. He says,
[48:35] "Which covenant he made with Abraham and
[48:38] his oath unto Isaac, and confirmed the
[48:40] same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel
[48:43] for an everlasting covenant, saying,
[48:46] "Unto thee will I give the land of
[48:48] Canaan the lot of your inheritance."
[48:50] church. That's quite something to
[48:52] promise to somebody who's old and has no
[48:54] children. I want you to think about the
[48:56] start of this covenant. This promise
[48:58] that he gave. Amen. That he was going to
[49:01] give them a land and it was just him and
[49:03] Sarah. Lord, we don't need a land.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; What we really need is a son. We could
[49:08] use a maybe a couple dozen children,
[49:11] Lord, but we have none. Doesn't matter.
[49:13] You're going to need a land. You're
[49:14] going to have so many. You're going to
[49:15] need a land. And I'm promising you the
[49:17] land. Lord, how you going to get us
[49:18] there? Don't worry about it. I've given
[49:20] you a land. You're going to have need of
[49:22] this land. He said, "When they were but
[49:24] a few men in number, yay, very few and
[49:26] strangers in it." God keeps repeating
[49:29] his promise to a people that have no
[49:30] apparent need for what he's promising
[49:32] yet. Can you consider that the land of
[49:34] Israel today, you can you can fly across
[49:36] it in a fighter jet in 45 seconds one
[49:39] way and a minute and a half or two
[49:40] minutes in the other. Tiny little piece
[49:42] of land, but it's for them. He says,
[49:44] "You're going to need a place to live,
[49:46] and I've given you a place." Why does he
[49:48] keep repeating it, church? Because his
[49:50] word never changes. His word never
[49:52] changes. He says, "When they went from
[49:54] one nation to another, from one kingdom
[49:56] to another people, he suffered. He
[49:58] allowed no man to do them wrong. Yay, he
[50:01] reproved kings for their sakes." Saying,
[50:04] "Touch not mine anointed and do my
[50:06] prophets no harm." Remember Abraham goes
[50:08] into the land of Aimilec and he says to
[50:10] Sarah, "Say that you're my sister."
[50:13] Which was true because she was his
[50:14] halfsister. But what he was scared of
[50:16] was the king would see his old wife that
[50:20] had had a body change and would desire
[50:22] her for his wife. So he said, "Tell him
[50:23] you're my sister so that he doesn't kill
[50:25] me." And Aimilec sees her. And it's told
[50:29] him it's his sister. So he feels it's
[50:30] safe to take Sarah to be wife. And the
[50:33] Lord comes to him and he says, "You're a
[50:34] dead man." He says, "Lord, why? I'm a
[50:36] righteous man. You know me. I haven't
[50:37] done anything wrong." He says, "You're
[50:39] you've taken another man's wife to be
[50:41] your wife." He said, Lord, he told me he
[50:43] was his sister. He says, "It doesn't
[50:44] matter. Go and get him to pray for you,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; church. He suffered no man to do them
[50:51] wrong. He reproved kings for their
[50:53] sakes. Aimilec has done nothing wrong,
[50:55] but he has to go to a child of God and
[50:58] apologize for taking something without
[51:00] realizing what he was doing." And when
[51:02] Abraham prayed for him, God spared him
[51:05] and his family. That's the privilege of
[51:07] being a child of God, church. He'll keep
[51:09] you.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; He'll discipline you. He'll chastise
[51:12] you, but he will keep you. Nothing can
[51:14] touch you unless he allows it.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, church, we look at this and
[51:18] if we were to take the the family of
[51:20] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob going down,
[51:23] I would say under this condition, they
[51:25] were in a revival. They're going from
[51:28] place to place. Wherever they go, they
[51:30] have children upon children. Their
[51:31] flocks and their herds are growing.
[51:33] Nobody can stand against them. Nobody
[51:35] can touch them. Nothing can conquer
[51:37] them.
[51:39] They're in a perfect place. Everything
[51:41] their hand touches is blessed. Amen.
[51:44] But I want you to see how God works
[51:47] because God in all of this is setting
[51:49] the stage to fulfill his covenant. Okay?
[51:53] Now, I want to take us back to that
[51:54] original covenant just so we can so see
[51:56] the good the the the full picture
[51:58] because so often what we do when God
[52:00] promises something us is we focus on the
[52:03] promise and we forget the conditions
[52:05] around the promise. We forget the
[52:07] circumstances around what he's promising
[52:09] us to do. Amen. So many times when we
[52:11] look at what God's promising, it's
[52:13] surrounded by hardship. It's surrounded
[52:15] by persecution. It's surrounded by
[52:17] sickness. It's surrounded by darkness.
[52:19] It's surrounded by despair. It's
[52:21] surrounded by bondage. It's surrounded
[52:23] by things that are trying to get our
[52:25] eyes off of the word of God. But that's
[52:28] what makes God God is out of all of
[52:30] that, he can produce something good. Out
[52:32] of all of that, he can produce his word.
[52:34] Out of all of that, he can fulfill his
[52:36] promise when it looks like he can't do
[52:38] anything.
[52:39] Look at what he said to Abraham. He said
[52:41] unto him, I am the Lord thy God. I am
[52:44] the Lord that brought thee out of the
[52:45] Caldes to give thee this land to inherit
[52:48] it. Verse 13. And he said unto Abraham,
[52:51] know of assurityity. In other words,
[52:53] have no doubt about what I'm about to
[52:55] say, that thy seed shall be a stranger
[52:58] in a land that is not theirs, and shall
[53:01] serve them, and they shall afflict them
[53:03] 400 years. and also that nation whom
[53:07] they shall serve will I judge and
[53:09] afterward shall they come out with great
[53:11] substance. Church, we can look at the
[53:13] promises of God and we love them and we
[53:16] believe them and we want to receive
[53:17] them. But look at the background of this
[53:19] great promise of God. The covenant to
[53:22] Israel is surrounded by hardship. It's
[53:25] surrounded by bondage. It's surrounded
[53:27] by slavery. Can you imagine a good God
[53:29] saying to you that you are going to be
[53:31] born into slavery and you will die into
[53:34] slavery as children of the promise?
[53:37] Church, we would doubt if we're children
[53:39] of God. We're doubt if we're children of
[53:41] his love. We're doubt that that we are
[53:43] the children of his good nature because
[53:44] it seems like everything that he's put
[53:46] on them, you're born into and you die in
[53:49] slavery.
[53:51] There were generations after generations
[53:53] of Israelites born in Egypt that died in
[53:55] slavery having never received the
[53:57] promise of God. Church, let me put it
[53:59] this way. Some of us have to be sick so
[54:01] that we can see that he's a healer. Some
[54:03] of us have to be lost so that we can be
[54:05] found. Some of us have to have our
[54:07] hearts broken so that he can bind them
[54:09] up again. Some of us have to fail so
[54:12] that he can restore.
[54:14] Some of us have to walk away so that he
[54:16] can pull us back. Some of us, our
[54:18] promises are surrounded by hardship, by
[54:21] failures, by despair.
[54:24] But that doesn't mean God's not in it.
[54:27] Amen. It doesn't mean that God's not in
[54:29] of it. Some of us have to fall so he can
[54:31] say, "I'll lift you up." Every word has
[54:34] to be fulfilled. Amen. Church, we've got
[54:36] to stop looking at the circumstances of
[54:38] our life and see the big picture. See
[54:41] what God's trying to do. See God's
[54:43] purpose in all of it. Because we'll see
[54:45] as we go through this that God has a
[54:47] plan. God has a purpose in everything
[54:50] that we go through. In everything that
[54:52] we go through. Amen. And God has a
[54:54] people that will walk through these
[54:55] things in victory because they will not
[54:58] let the circumstances change who they
[55:00] are. They will not be allowed to change
[55:02] what they believe. They will not be
[55:04] allowed to change what they say. Why?
[55:06] Because there's something inside of them
[55:08] that is producing the word of promise.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's got
[55:13] a people that'll stand no matter what.
[55:16] And I believe this morning, it's you.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; It's me. Amen. It's not somebody out
[55:21] there. It's not for some great ministry
[55:22] or some great church. But it's simple
[55:24] people that'll take the word of God.
[55:26] They'll keep it in their mind. They'll
[55:28] keep it on their lips and they'll say,
[55:29] "Here I stand.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I won't move.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I won't move."
[55:34] But I want you to see what God says in
[55:37] this Psalms 105 here because he's
[55:39] talking about this beautiful promise of
[55:41] the people of Israel. But watch what he
[55:44] does now in verse 16. It says,
[55:46] "Moreover,
[55:48] he called
[55:50] for a famine upon the land. He broke the
[55:54] whole staff of bread." God took the
[55:56] children of Israel and he put them in a
[55:59] time of hardship. He took everything
[56:01] that he had blessed them with and he
[56:02] started to pull back.
[56:04] It says he broke the staff of bread.
[56:06] Bread was considered the lifeline. If
[56:08] you had bread and water, you could
[56:10] survive forever. And God started pulling
[56:13] it back. God did this church to where
[56:16] they could not provide for themselves.
[56:20] And catch this. He sent a man before
[56:24] them, even Joseph who was sold for a
[56:27] servant. Let me stop here. Look at what
[56:29] he says. He sent
[56:33] church. Do you realize what that means?
[56:36] When you go into hard circumstances,
[56:39] you're one cent.
[56:44] David can say this because David's got
[56:46] 2020 hindsight. David has seen the whole
[56:50] thing play out. And so David can look
[56:52] back and say, "He sent."
[56:55] He didn't say, "It happened this way or
[56:57] bad luck struck Joseph." He said, "He
[57:00] sent." God sent. Amen. Before them, even
[57:04] Joseph, Amen, church. But look at this.
[57:07] Through the the this life of Joseph
[57:09] through his eyes, the circumstances he
[57:10] went through, the hardship, the
[57:12] disappointment, the pain, the suffering,
[57:13] the offenses. And Joseph never did
[57:16] anything to deserve what happened to
[57:18] him. [snorts]
[57:21] Are you listening this morning? Joseph
[57:24] didn't backslide.
[57:26] Joseph didn't fornicate. Joseph didn't
[57:28] try and take matters into his own hands.
[57:30] He didn't disobey. in blaspheme. Joseph
[57:33] lived a perfect life.
[57:37] And here's the result. Whose feet they
[57:40] hurt with feathers and he was laid in
[57:43] iron. Joseph was perfect in his actions,
[57:47] perfect in his life. And yet the
[57:48] scripture says that God allowed him, God
[57:51] sent him into slavery. God sent his feet
[57:53] to be put into fedters. God sent him to
[57:56] be falsely accu accused. God sent him to
[57:58] be put in prison. God sent him to a
[58:01] place that seemed hopeless. And that was
[58:03] the tender hand of Jehovah for Joseph
[58:06] and his family.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; But watch this verse. And this is the
[58:15] genesis of this service this morning.
[58:18] Until the time that his word came,
[58:23] the word of the Lord tried him.
[58:26] Remember, Joseph had a word from God.
[58:29] Joseph at the age of 17, he has a dream
[58:31] from God where he is standing up and his
[58:34] brothers and his parents all bowed down
[58:37] before him. He has a prophetic decree
[58:39] over his life that he will rule and
[58:42] reign over his family. Amen. Even before
[58:44] his parents died, the Bible tells us
[58:46] that Joseph was 17 years old when he was
[58:49] sold into slavery. In other words, he
[58:51] was the age of my son Jonathan, if you
[58:52] want to put it into context this
[58:54] morning. and his brothers loved him so
[58:56] much that they sold him for 20 shekels
[58:58] of silver. I looked it up. They say
[59:00] that's that the value of the silver
[59:02] would be about 200 bucks today.
[59:06] So then they tore up his coat, [snorts]
[59:09] covered it in blood, and they brought it
[59:11] back to his father and they said, "We
[59:12] found this. We don't know if it's
[59:14] Joseph's coat or not." And they let him
[59:15] draw his own conclusion that Joseph had
[59:18] been killed by a wild animal. Church,
[59:20] but I want you to take yourself and put
[59:21] yourself in Joseph's place tonight.
[59:23] Maybe you feel like you're in Joseph's
[59:24] place. Amen.
[59:27] Joseph has his devotions every morning.
[59:30] He prays with and communes with the one
[59:32] true God. He sacrifices the way that
[59:34] he's supposed to. He lives a clean life.
[59:36] He's a prophet of God. He's ordained to
[59:38] a special gift in his life. Even at the
[59:41] early age of 17, he's a godly teenager,
[59:45] blameless in his life.
[59:50] At the age of 17, he has this dream of
[59:53] everyone bowing down before him. And
[59:55] that's quite a prophecy to have in your
[59:56] life at the age of 17. Can you imagine
[59:59] if Jonathan had a dream like that? That
[1:00:00] he was perhaps going to be prime
[1:00:02] minister of all Canada.
[1:00:05] And knowing that it was going to happen,
[1:00:07] he would be saying every day, "Lord, how
[1:00:09] blessed am I." Maybe not so much these
[1:00:12] days
[1:00:14] because it's such a mess. But can you
[1:00:16] imagine a young man in our church having
[1:00:18] a prophecy over him that everyone will
[1:00:20] bow down before you? You'll have power
[1:00:22] and authority over everyone that's
[1:00:24] around you. We would think, "Boy, God
[1:00:27] sure loves me. God sure thinks something
[1:00:30] of me."
[1:00:35] The scripture says that that that day
[1:00:37] when that would happen is the day of his
[1:00:38] word, the time of his word. But until
[1:00:41] the day of the promise being fulfilled
[1:00:43] would come,
[1:00:45] what has to happen? The word of the Lord
[1:00:49] tried him. The word of the Lord tried
[1:00:52] him. Amen. It says until the time that
[1:00:54] his word came. And then it puts the coal
[1:00:56] in there. And you got to watch in
[1:00:57] scripture because God does everything
[1:00:59] perfectly.
[1:01:01] There's a time allocated for the day of
[1:01:03] your word. The time of your word. But
[1:01:06] between that and everything else,
[1:01:08] there's a gap. And what is it? It's the
[1:01:11] time of the Lord. The word of the Lord
[1:01:14] that tries you.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:18] [snorts] If I could put it this way, the
[1:01:20] word of the Lord tried Joseph a long
[1:01:22] time so that the word of Joseph could
[1:01:24] happen. Amen. Listen to how the prophet
[1:01:27] of God says this now. He says, "Joseph
[1:01:30] was an elected son. He was a perfect
[1:01:34] type of Jesus Christ. He was born a
[1:01:37] prophet and he could see visions. And
[1:01:39] when he was yet a little boy, he saw a
[1:01:41] vision of himself sitting on a throne
[1:01:42] and his brothers bowing to him. He says,
[1:01:44] "And watch." He felt like he was a great
[1:01:47] guy.
[1:01:50] Church, nothing wrong with thinking
[1:01:51] you're a great guy. And by church, we
[1:01:54] ought to be able to say, "The Lord is
[1:01:55] pleased with my life." We ought to be
[1:01:57] able to do that. Amen. But remember,
[1:01:59] where you are today is not where you
[1:02:01] want to be tomorrow. God's always trying
[1:02:03] to grow us. God's always trying to take
[1:02:05] us to a higher level. God has a plan for
[1:02:07] your life. God has a word for your life
[1:02:09] and his goal is to get you there. Just
[1:02:12] because you're good today doesn't mean
[1:02:13] you're good for tomorrow. The trials of
[1:02:15] tomorrow, the tests of tomorrow are
[1:02:17] going to be higher than today. So, we
[1:02:18] got to keep growing. Amen. Imagine if
[1:02:20] you will, Joseph daily and he's
[1:02:22] worshiping and he's praising and he's
[1:02:24] having his devotions and he's living a
[1:02:26] life worthy of a gospel and then one day
[1:02:28] his father sends him out to check on his
[1:02:30] brothers because they're feeding their
[1:02:32] sheep out near another place. And in a
[1:02:34] moment, his life changes. One minute
[1:02:37] he's walking and talking, comes up to
[1:02:40] his brethren. They take him, throw him
[1:02:42] in a pit, and throw up rip his jacket
[1:02:44] off of him. It's a dry well. And they
[1:02:46] throw him in there. And a few hours
[1:02:48] later, not only that, they've taken him
[1:02:50] and they sold him to distant relatives.
[1:02:53] And now he's on a on a on a slave train
[1:02:56] all the way to where he knows what. And
[1:02:58] so day after day, he's trudging through
[1:03:01] rock and sand and blistering heat, no
[1:03:04] hope, tied behind a camel, not knowing
[1:03:07] where he's going to go. Church, this is
[1:03:10] what God sent looks like. Sometimes
[1:03:15] God sends him away from his cozy
[1:03:17] fellowship, his family, his his
[1:03:19] structured life, his blessed condition,
[1:03:21] and he sends him to a foreign land, not
[1:03:24] as a free man, but now as a slave. Amen.
[1:03:26] How do you think Joseph was praying all
[1:03:28] the way to Egypt?
[1:03:31] Joseph no doubt was saying,"Lord, what
[1:03:33] is going on? I've served you faithfully.
[1:03:36] I've lived a blameless life. I've done
[1:03:37] everything I know to do to please you,
[1:03:40] and now I'm on the road to who knows
[1:03:42] where, and I'm a slave. My own distant
[1:03:45] relatives, the Israelites, remember, are
[1:03:46] are part of his family. They bound me
[1:03:48] up." Lord, deliver your servant. Deliver
[1:03:51] your son. Supernaturally break my bonds,
[1:03:54] Lord.
[1:03:56] Lord, help me. Deliver me.
[1:04:00] Lord, I've got a word that I'm supposed
[1:04:02] to fulfill.
[1:04:04] Lord, you promised me that I was going
[1:04:06] to have power and authority. Break this
[1:04:08] out of my life.
[1:04:13] Isn't that what we'd be praying? Isn't
[1:04:15] that what we pray?
[1:04:17] Of course it is. And there's nothing
[1:04:20] wrong with praying it. You ought to pray
[1:04:22] it. We've got a God that's a deliverer.
[1:04:24] We've got a do God that's a provider, a
[1:04:26] healer, and all these different things.
[1:04:28] We ought to believe and pray, but you
[1:04:30] have to understand there's two words
[1:04:31] working.
[1:04:33] And God's got to get you where you need
[1:04:34] to be before you can receive what he has
[1:04:36] for you. Joseph's bought and he's taken
[1:04:40] to Egypt and he's bought and he's placed
[1:04:41] in the house of Potterer. He's a captain
[1:04:43] of the guard of Pharaoh. And the
[1:04:45] scripture says that the Lord was with
[1:04:47] Joseph and he was a prosperous man. Even
[1:04:50] in his slavery, Joseph was blessed. a
[1:04:52] church. Can you imagine the paradox? I'm
[1:04:55] a blessed slave. Anybody here want to be
[1:04:57] a blessed slave?
[1:04:59] I'm not interested in being a blessed
[1:05:01] slave. Yet, aren't we all blessed
[1:05:03] slaves? Cuz we're all living in a slave
[1:05:06] to this flesh condition, bound to what?
[1:05:08] We're born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[1:05:10] and only the soul has been redeemed. But
[1:05:13] everything else is fighting against us
[1:05:15] and trying to bind us. But in that
[1:05:18] condition, yet the Lord can bless us.
[1:05:20] Let the Lord can use us. Yet the Lord
[1:05:22] can show that he is with us day by day.
[1:05:25] And the scripture says that Joseph found
[1:05:27] grace in the eyes of Piper.
[1:05:30] And Piper put Joseph over control of all
[1:05:33] his physical goods, all of his
[1:05:34] possessions. And the God and the
[1:05:36] scripture says that God blessed Piper
[1:05:38] for Joseph's sake.
[1:05:41] Church, now that's a good that's a
[1:05:43] better life, but it's not a good life.
[1:05:46] A blessed slave is still a slave.
[1:05:50] He was not in his original condition.
[1:05:52] He's still living below his privileges.
[1:05:54] Amen. But as the the chief slave, as the
[1:05:57] the head of Potterer's household, no
[1:05:59] doubt he had freedom to walk around. And
[1:06:01] no doubt Piper allowed him to wear nicer
[1:06:03] clothes and bathe regularly because he
[1:06:05] would represent Piper. So he had the
[1:06:07] best that you life that you could live
[1:06:09] as a slave. But he was still a slave. No
[1:06:11] fellowship, no family.
[1:06:14] Had to learn a new language. Everything
[1:06:16] was strange to him. Everything was hard
[1:06:18] to him. Not great, but certainly not
[1:06:20] bad. Amen. And then one day, Piper's
[1:06:23] wife tries to seduce Joseph, and she
[1:06:25] tries to get him to sleep with her, and
[1:06:27] Joseph refuses her point blank. And I've
[1:06:29] said this before, but I like to say I
[1:06:30] like Joseph's response. He used his feet
[1:06:33] for discernment. Amen. He didn't stand
[1:06:36] around to argue with her, to tell her
[1:06:37] about how big of a a believer he was and
[1:06:39] that God wouldn't be pleased with it. He
[1:06:41] said, "I can't do it. Your master has
[1:06:42] put me over his house, but not over you.
[1:06:44] I'm out of here." And he ran away from
[1:06:46] her. Brothers, sisters, if you're in a
[1:06:49] time of temptation, don't stick around.
[1:06:51] Leave immediately. The scripture says he
[1:06:54] fled and got him out. That's what you
[1:06:57] need to do. Get out. Lay it down. Walk
[1:07:00] away.
[1:07:04] Use your feet for discernment.
[1:07:07] Turn it off.
[1:07:09] Whatever it might be. Amen. [snorts] Get
[1:07:12] out of the situation early. Otherwise,
[1:07:14] Satan's offer gets more and more
[1:07:16] tempting the longer you stay there.
[1:07:20] Joseph walks away, runs away. Thank you,
[1:07:23] Lord, for delivering me. And what does
[1:07:25] God do?
[1:07:27] God allows him to be falsely accused and
[1:07:29] convicted of raping Piper's wife and
[1:07:31] sends him to prison.
[1:07:33] And Joseph said, "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:07:37] Did he?
[1:07:39] Can you imagine?
[1:07:41] The social justice warriors would no
[1:07:43] doubt be out.
[1:07:45] Can you imagine the prayers that Joseph
[1:07:48] was saying, but God allowed it? God sent
[1:07:53] him to prison.
[1:07:55] Church, this is not happen stance. It's
[1:07:57] not bad luck. This is the perfect will
[1:07:59] of God for Joseph's life.
[1:08:02] He says, "What did God have to do?" He
[1:08:06] did the same thing he did to the rest of
[1:08:08] them. Because Moses was a deliverer,
[1:08:10] Paul was a deliverer. how Joseph was a
[1:08:12] deliverer. He saved his people from the
[1:08:13] famine. What did God have to do to him?
[1:08:17] He says, "Put him in prison." He put him
[1:08:20] right straight in the prison. Remember,
[1:08:22] he was sold by his brethren to an
[1:08:23] Egyptian. They sold him to Piper. And
[1:08:25] Piper gave him a little bit of liberty.
[1:08:28] And the first thing you know, that was
[1:08:31] taken from him. There he sat in the
[1:08:34] prison crying, crying and crying. He
[1:08:36] says God had to strip it. Church, what
[1:08:39] would we be praying now if we were in
[1:08:41] Joseph's life and in his shoes, in his
[1:08:43] condition? Amen. We'd be crying out,
[1:08:44] "God, listen. I don't understand this.
[1:08:47] You made me a slave, but in my slavery,
[1:08:49] I've been faithful. I haven't abused my
[1:08:51] privileges. I didn't take advantage of
[1:08:52] everything. I didn't try and escape. I
[1:08:54] didn't do anything to to to shame you,
[1:08:58] Lord. I've lived my life as clean as I
[1:09:00] can. I've done everything I can to to to
[1:09:03] make my master succeed. And out of this,
[1:09:05] I'm in prison.
[1:09:10] done nothing to deserve jail, done
[1:09:12] nothing to deserve to live with
[1:09:14] criminals. Church, wouldn't we be crying
[1:09:16] out for justice, deliverance, salvation,
[1:09:19] supernatural intervention?
[1:09:22] Absolutely, church. Those are our
[1:09:25] promises. But remember, there's a word
[1:09:27] of the Lord that overshadows the word
[1:09:29] for you and I. There's a bigger picture
[1:09:32] that's happening. Amen. And I believe
[1:09:34] one thing, church. Joseph's a prophet.
[1:09:36] And I'd like to say Joseph had a
[1:09:38] different attitude.
[1:09:40] And I believe the scripture bears that
[1:09:42] out because he believes the word of God.
[1:09:44] And that's what keeps him on the
[1:09:45] straight and narrow. That's what keeps
[1:09:47] him going day by day. He says, "Now
[1:09:49] notice, but all the time I believe in
[1:09:51] that prison, he could remember that the
[1:09:53] vision said he was going to sit on a
[1:09:55] throne and his brothers were going to
[1:09:57] bow to him because he knew that his gift
[1:09:59] came from God." Notice he could.
[1:10:03] You choose what you're going to dwell
[1:10:04] on, church.
[1:10:06] You choose what you're going to dwell
[1:10:07] on. He could dwell on the prison cell or
[1:10:09] he could dwell on the word of God. The
[1:10:12] choice is his choice is yours. He says
[1:10:15] if we could only keep that in our mind
[1:10:18] and according to the word of God that in
[1:10:20] these last days he's going to have a
[1:10:22] church. He's going to have a people. And
[1:10:24] these things that he promised, he's
[1:10:27] going to do them. He said he said that
[1:10:30] he would. And we're living in the time
[1:10:31] we're there. He's just trying to get us
[1:10:33] to be real prisoners now. Locked in with
[1:10:37] him. He says, "You've heard that old
[1:10:39] song you sing, shut in with God. I want
[1:10:42] to be shut in with God." Being shut in
[1:10:44] with God, nothing else. And you only
[1:10:46] move when God says move. You only do as
[1:10:49] God says do. See, then you're shut in
[1:10:51] with God. See, so often we're saying,
[1:10:53] "God, get me out." And God say, "No, get
[1:10:55] in. Get in with me. Get shut in with me.
[1:10:58] Get tied in with me. And then you can go
[1:11:00] free." Cuz if I set you free now, you
[1:11:03] won't do what you're supposed to do.
[1:11:06] But get closer to me. Get closer to me.
[1:11:09] Stay with me a little while. He says,
[1:11:11] "Now you remember he was thinking he
[1:11:13] also became a total failure to himself.
[1:11:17] All that he knew, all that he understood
[1:11:19] and everything, he became a total
[1:11:21] failure." See, you got to understand
[1:11:22] this. We can have the promise in the
[1:11:25] word of God, but God is the one that
[1:11:27] will declare it. God is the one that
[1:11:29] determines how it comes to pass. The
[1:11:31] prophet of God taught us God interprets
[1:11:33] his word how? By bringing it to pass.
[1:11:38] Joseph knew he had a word promise.
[1:11:41] Joseph understood differently than God.
[1:11:45] Joseph no doubt assumed he was just
[1:11:47] going to because he was a good guy get
[1:11:49] elevated up. His brothers were
[1:11:50] scoundrels. We know his brothers were no
[1:11:52] goods,
[1:11:54] weren't they? Go look at what some of
[1:11:56] his brothers did. Some of them had their
[1:11:57] names removed from the book.
[1:12:01] They had no land. God took it away, gave
[1:12:03] it to Ephraim and Manasseh.
[1:12:06] Joseph's brothers were scoundrels.
[1:12:08] Joseph by his good nature and good
[1:12:10] living was more worthy to receive
[1:12:12] authority than they were. And no doubt
[1:12:14] he was banking on that.
[1:12:17] All that he knew, all that he
[1:12:19] understood. But he became a total
[1:12:20] failure. It didn't work. He was put in a
[1:12:22] situation to where nobody would listen
[1:12:24] to him. He was a prisoner. See, he was
[1:12:26] put into a situation that unbelievers
[1:12:28] would not believe. Do you see what I
[1:12:30] mean? His ministry was of no effect. The
[1:12:32] people turned their head. They wouldn't
[1:12:33] pay attention to him in prison. What
[1:12:35] good would his ministry do? He might
[1:12:37] stand to the prison bars and preach to
[1:12:39] them. They'd walk on down the street.
[1:12:41] See, but he became a prisoner. And God
[1:12:44] kept him a prisoner until the wheel
[1:12:46] rolled up, right? He said, "Here is my
[1:12:49] man." He says, "Glory, total failure."
[1:12:53] Total
[1:12:54] failure, church. Are you feeling bound
[1:12:56] today? Are you feeling like you're
[1:12:59] working and you're working and nothing's
[1:13:01] happening? That you're doing everything
[1:13:02] you can do and yet the results aren't
[1:13:04] there? That you have prayed, you have
[1:13:07] believed, you have acted, you have
[1:13:09] moved, you have stood still, whatever
[1:13:11] you feel that you're supposed to do, and
[1:13:13] yet nothing has changed.
[1:13:15] Welcome to Joseph's life.
[1:13:18] Welcome to Joseph's life. Amen. The
[1:13:20] prophet of God says in that condition,
[1:13:22] he says, "Glory, total failure."
[1:13:26] Why? Because the word of the Lord is
[1:13:29] trying him. That's what's going on.
[1:13:31] Amen. That word try, it says the word of
[1:13:34] the Lord tried him. It means it refined,
[1:13:36] it purged, it purified, it tested. So in
[1:13:40] other words, the word of the Lord was
[1:13:42] working on Joseph to get him to the
[1:13:44] point where he was suitable to receive
[1:13:46] the day of his visitation, the time of
[1:13:49] his word. Amen. God put Joseph through
[1:13:52] 13 years of hell. Church, Joseph didn't
[1:13:55] have ups and downs. Joseph had downs and
[1:13:57] downs. It just kept getting worse.
[1:14:01] as an ordained son of God, as God's
[1:14:04] prophet, as God's redeemer for that
[1:14:06] time, if I could put it that way.
[1:14:08] Joseph's life kept going down, down,
[1:14:11] down.
[1:14:13] What a life.
[1:14:15] What a life. Kept getting worse. Even
[1:14:18] with the blessings of God, he still
[1:14:20] stayed a slave and then dropped down
[1:14:22] into a prisoner. Amen. He kept going
[1:14:24] further and further into hardship, into
[1:14:26] rejection, into despair. Perhaps we'd
[1:14:29] say today, things just kept spiraling
[1:14:31] downwards. Talk about forsaken, church.
[1:14:34] If he wanted to feel forsaken, he had
[1:14:36] every right to do it. The situation
[1:14:38] certainly supported it. He could have
[1:14:40] claimed he was forsaken. He could have
[1:14:41] blamed God. He could have turned away
[1:14:43] and done those things.
[1:14:45] But he elected not to do those things.
[1:14:48] He chose his thoughts. He chose his
[1:14:51] attitude. He chose his response. And we
[1:14:53] have the same thing today when it comes
[1:14:55] down to the hard times is Lord, I'm
[1:14:57] going to think about what you said and
[1:14:59] I'm going to trust your process.
[1:15:01] Joseph didn't think about his
[1:15:03] circumstances. He just kept on
[1:15:06] believing.
[1:15:08] Amen. The scripture says that even in
[1:15:10] prison, the Lord showed him mercy and
[1:15:12] gave him favor with the keeper of the
[1:15:15] prisons, with the prison warden. And so,
[1:15:17] Joseph still had a measure of authority
[1:15:19] and freedom. And God blessed whatever
[1:15:21] Joseph did. And you'll notice in
[1:15:22] Joseph's life that no matter where he
[1:15:25] went, he always had power and authority.
[1:15:28] Did you notice that? As a slave, he got
[1:15:30] power and authority. As a prisoner, he
[1:15:32] got power and authority. Amen. It was in
[1:15:34] measure, but it was always there. He had
[1:15:37] access to money. He had opportunity to
[1:15:38] use it, you know, to his benefit. In
[1:15:40] Piper's house, he managed all the
[1:15:42] finances of his house. In theory, Joseph
[1:15:45] could have siphoned off some money to
[1:15:47] buy his freedom, to buy away out of
[1:15:49] Egypt, but he never did. He always held
[1:15:52] his character.
[1:15:54] He always did it to the best of his
[1:15:56] ability with honor. Amen. And he did
[1:15:59] everything for the benefit of his
[1:16:00] master. He didn't use it for his own
[1:16:02] advantage. And then in prison, the Bible
[1:16:04] says he ran the entire prison while he
[1:16:06] was there. The keeper of the prison, the
[1:16:08] warden, gave everything into Joseph's
[1:16:09] hands. And Joseph ran the whole prison.
[1:16:12] That guy had the easiest job in the
[1:16:13] world for a couple of years because
[1:16:16] Joseph ran everything. and he just sat
[1:16:17] back and everything Joseph did, God
[1:16:19] blessed it. In prison, can you imagine
[1:16:23] church? Prisons in those days are not
[1:16:24] like today.
[1:16:26] Today, they have three square meals,
[1:16:28] they have a uh uh, you know, air
[1:16:31] conditioning, they have heating, they
[1:16:32] have proper clothes, they get to bathe
[1:16:34] every day, they have a TV there, they
[1:16:36] have exercise equipment, they have all
[1:16:37] these things. Back then, they didn't
[1:16:39] have it. It was stinking dark holes
[1:16:43] with sloppy food if you got any. Not a
[1:16:46] fun time. But even in prison, Joseph
[1:16:49] remains faithful and he's responsive to
[1:16:51] God when God moves. And remember what
[1:16:53] happened is the chief butler and the
[1:16:55] chief baker from Pharaoh's court came to
[1:16:57] him. They said, "Hey, we've got these
[1:16:58] dreams." And Joseph goes and God gives
[1:17:00] him his answers for them. And he goes,
[1:17:04] [laughter] excuse me, [snorts]
[1:17:06] and he tells the the chief baker, he
[1:17:08] says, "Listen," or he tells the chief
[1:17:10] butler, he says, "Your dream is in three
[1:17:12] days you're going to go back and
[1:17:13] Pharaoh's going to restore you back to
[1:17:15] favor." Then the chief baker tells him
[1:17:17] his story. And he says, "You're going to
[1:17:18] lose your head. You're going to go in
[1:17:19] three days and say, and Pharaoh's going
[1:17:21] to chop your head off, and you're going
[1:17:22] to die." And he says to the chief
[1:17:24] butler, he says, "When you go to
[1:17:26] Pharaoh, remember me.
[1:17:29] remember me, Lord. When he goes, let him
[1:17:33] remember me. And what does he do,
[1:17:35] church? For two years, he forgets.
[1:17:39] And yet, Joseph is never resentful.
[1:17:43] Joseph never turns his back on God.
[1:17:45] Joseph never curses the day he was born.
[1:17:50] Joseph stays faithful.
[1:17:52] Church, you say, "I've done everything I
[1:17:54] can do. What more can I do?" Stay
[1:17:55] faithful. Just keep walking. Just keep
[1:18:00] pressing forward in it. Amen.
[1:18:02] Joseph has this great promise in his
[1:18:04] life and yet his circumstances are so
[1:18:06] contrary to everything he ever thought
[1:18:09] that would help bring it about. Amen.
[1:18:12] Brother Bram says it this way.
[1:18:15] The church needs tonight not a soft
[1:18:18] hybrid something soft and flabby like
[1:18:20] the church is just make a confession, be
[1:18:22] baptized and you're a Christian. He says
[1:18:23] to be a Christian is selfdenial.
[1:18:27] Deny yourself, take up your cross,
[1:18:30] follow me daily. See, we think that it's
[1:18:32] so easy sometimes. I've committed myself
[1:18:36] to him. Therefore, he's going to take
[1:18:38] care of me. He is. But he said, you got
[1:18:41] to take up your cross daily. Daily.
[1:18:44] There's a burden to bear. There's a
[1:18:45] hardship to bear every day. I don't care
[1:18:47] who's in this room. Can't we testify to
[1:18:49] it? There's a cross to bear daily. Amen.
[1:18:52] Me and Sister Brenda, thank you, Sister
[1:18:53] Brenda, for that. Every day there's a
[1:18:56] cross to bear. He says, "Today it's so
[1:18:59] soft and people call themselves
[1:19:00] Christians when it used to mean death to
[1:19:02] confess Christ and you had to depend on
[1:19:05] him daily for everything you had need
[1:19:09] of." My wife was talking to me about the
[1:19:11] service that Brother Garfield preached
[1:19:12] on Wednesday night and how much she
[1:19:14] appreciated what he said about seeking
[1:19:17] eternal seeking spiritual experiences
[1:19:20] rather than earthly experiences. Because
[1:19:22] what's going to get us out of here is
[1:19:24] not God providing for our our our house
[1:19:27] payments and our car payments and our
[1:19:29] utilities and our food. And that's all
[1:19:32] good and he's promised to take care of
[1:19:34] it. But it's a kingdom experience we're
[1:19:36] looking for. Amen. It's a heavenly
[1:19:38] experience. It's a supernatural
[1:19:39] experience that we're looking for. And
[1:19:41] if we can look to him for that, he'll
[1:19:43] take care of everything else. But so
[1:19:45] often what we're doing is we're taking
[1:19:47] care of everything else. And then we
[1:19:48] look to him for something and what's
[1:19:50] left almost nothing because we burnt
[1:19:53] ourselves out trying to take care of
[1:19:54] ourselves.
[1:19:57] But church,
[1:19:59] what I love about this scripture says
[1:20:04] until
[1:20:06] the time of his word came.
[1:20:09] But one day, hallelujah, the time of his
[1:20:12] word came. The time of his word came and
[1:20:15] Joseph stepped into a new reality. Amen.
[1:20:18] There came a day where the trying and
[1:20:20] the praying and the waiting and the
[1:20:22] trusting finally came into fruition.
[1:20:25] Amen. I'm here to tell you today,
[1:20:27] church, there's a time for your word to
[1:20:29] be fulfilled.
[1:20:31] There's a time ordained for your word to
[1:20:34] be fulfilled. There's coming a day where
[1:20:36] God's going to say, "He's finished.
[1:20:39] She's done. He's ready. She's good to
[1:20:42] go. Let's get out of here." And there'll
[1:20:45] be a time of your word. Amen. It's time
[1:20:47] to take her out of her downs and outs.
[1:20:49] And it's time to take her up into the
[1:20:51] supernatural. It's time to lift him up
[1:20:53] beyond what he's been seeing, beyond
[1:20:55] what he's been thinking. And look what
[1:20:57] it says. David says, "The king sent and
[1:20:59] loosed him, even the ruler of the
[1:21:01] people, and let him go free and made him
[1:21:03] lord of his house and ruler of all his
[1:21:05] substance to bind his princes at his
[1:21:08] pleasure and teach his senators wisdom."
[1:21:11] I want to step into Joseph's shoes one
[1:21:13] more time. Now, remember, he's a child
[1:21:15] of God. He's the elect seed. He's an
[1:21:17] ordained prophet. He's chosen of God.
[1:21:19] He's sent of God, and he's living in
[1:21:21] prison. But one day he gets a summons.
[1:21:23] One day a royal envoy comes and he says
[1:21:26] to Joseph, "The king requires your
[1:21:29] presence." And Joseph walks out of that
[1:21:32] prison, not knowing that's the last time
[1:21:35] he'll ever step in that prison again.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Church, you don't know the day. You
[1:21:40] don't know the hour. But when it
[1:21:42] happens, you'll know what's going on.
[1:21:44] When it comes forth in your life, you'll
[1:21:46] say, "It's here. The time is here."
[1:21:49] Church, the scripture says, "No man
[1:21:51] knows the day for the hour, but we'll
[1:21:53] hear the call. We don't know when it
[1:21:55] will happen, but we'll feel the pull and
[1:21:57] something will say, "This is it. This is
[1:22:00] it." Amen. Joseph did not know that that
[1:22:03] was the last day he would ever spend in
[1:22:05] prison when he walked out. [snorts]
[1:22:08] Church, one day we're going to take our
[1:22:10] last steps in this prison, and we'll be
[1:22:13] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[1:22:14] an eye, and our temporary healing will
[1:22:16] be a permanent healing. Our temporary uh
[1:22:20] uh deliverance will be a permanent
[1:22:21] deliverance. Our temporary fellowship
[1:22:23] will become a permanent fellowship.
[1:22:26] The imperfect will translate into the
[1:22:29] perfect.
[1:22:31] One last movement and then it'll just be
[1:22:33] divi divine love. Divine love. Perfect
[1:22:36] love. The prophet of God said. Amen.
[1:22:40] He says finally God came to him in his
[1:22:43] prison and he used the gift that he had
[1:22:45] given him to get him out of there.
[1:22:47] That's right. He brought him from his
[1:22:48] prison. What did he do? He said as soon
[1:22:51] as he brought him from his prison, he
[1:22:54] was given power by the king, his king
[1:22:56] that he sat on the side of that he was
[1:22:58] under. He was brought from the prison
[1:23:00] house and given power whatever he said
[1:23:02] had to happen. He says in his prison,
[1:23:06] now here's the key. In his prison, he
[1:23:09] constantly remembered he was born for a
[1:23:13] purpose. He was going to sit by a king.
[1:23:17] All the rest of them were going to bow a
[1:23:18] knee to him. His vision told him so. But
[1:23:21] before his vision should could be
[1:23:24] completely fulfilled, he had to become a
[1:23:27] prisoner. And then he became a ruler.
[1:23:30] And when he came from his prison house
[1:23:32] and became a prisoner of the word of
[1:23:34] God, that he could only say what God put
[1:23:36] his mouth to say, then God moved through
[1:23:40] him.
[1:23:42] Church, there's two words at work and
[1:23:44] it's one in the same word. There's the
[1:23:46] word of the Lord and it has a great
[1:23:49] purpose and it's to bring you to the
[1:23:51] time of your word.
[1:23:53] Amen. The word of the Lord is preparing
[1:23:56] you, purging you, trying you, purifying
[1:23:59] you, so that when the day of your word
[1:24:01] comes, you'll be ready for it. You'll be
[1:24:04] ready for it. Listen to what Paul would
[1:24:06] say. He says, "Seeing wherefore, seeing
[1:24:09] that also we also are compassed about
[1:24:11] with so great a cloud of witnesses, let
[1:24:13] us set aside every weight, and the sin
[1:24:18] which does so easily beset us, and let
[1:24:20] us run how
[1:24:23] with patience, the race that is set
[1:24:26] before us,
[1:24:29] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:24:32] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[1:24:34] that was set before him endured the
[1:24:36] cross, despising the shame, and is sat
[1:24:38] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:24:40] God. For consider him that endured such
[1:24:43] contradiction of sinners against
[1:24:46] himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in
[1:24:49] your minds." Paul's saying here, listen,
[1:24:51] look at how Jesus lived and acted and
[1:24:54] reacted relative to his circumstances
[1:24:58] and then consider your lives and live
[1:25:00] the way that he lived. Copy him and get
[1:25:03] his results.
[1:25:05] I love this church because our God came
[1:25:08] down. He [snorts] did not stay in the
[1:25:10] portals of glory in his majesty and say,
[1:25:13] "All these people,
[1:25:15] why do they struggle so? Why do they
[1:25:18] fall so often? Why do they fail so
[1:25:20] often? Why is their faith so weak?" No,
[1:25:22] he came down himself into flesh so that
[1:25:25] he could experience everything that you
[1:25:27] and I experience. So that he could have
[1:25:30] an understanding of what we go through.
[1:25:32] And Christ, he came down in the form of
[1:25:34] Jesus Christ and he experienced and he
[1:25:37] overcame
[1:25:39] everything that you and I face. Amen.
[1:25:42] We're going to dwell on this a little
[1:25:44] more when we start this other series,
[1:25:46] Lord willing, next Sunday. But I want to
[1:25:48] say it this way, church. He knows and he
[1:25:50] understands where you are today. He
[1:25:54] understands what you're going through.
[1:25:55] He knew what it was to suffer hardship
[1:25:58] as a believer, to suffer rejection, to
[1:26:01] be misunderstood, to be falsely accused,
[1:26:03] to be burdened down with a daily weight,
[1:26:06] to be bombarded with things, to know
[1:26:09] pain and rejection. He knew temptation.
[1:26:12] Young people, he knew temptation. He
[1:26:15] knew what it was like
[1:26:17] to believe the best in people and be
[1:26:21] disappointed time and time again.
[1:26:26] But through it all, church, he overcame.
[1:26:29] And we overcome the same way he overcame
[1:26:32] by the spirit of the living God inside
[1:26:35] of us, keeping us tight to his word.
[1:26:39] That's how we do it. Amen. [snorts]
[1:26:41] The scripture says here that Jesus is
[1:26:44] the author and the finisher of our
[1:26:46] faith. That word author means this. See,
[1:26:48] we look at it as the writer, but what it
[1:26:51] means is the pioneer, the founder, the
[1:26:54] captain, the one who leads the way by
[1:26:58] example.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in other words, he doesn't
[1:27:02] just tell us what to do, he shows us
[1:27:04] what to do. He showed us what to do.
[1:27:07] Amen. Church, you know, the greatest way
[1:27:09] to teach your children is not to say it,
[1:27:12] it's to do it. Because children copy
[1:27:14] what you do, not what you say. And so,
[1:27:16] Christ was no different. He came and he
[1:27:18] showed us how to overcome. He showed us
[1:27:20] how to endure. He showed us how to come
[1:27:23] to the time of our word
[1:27:26] with patience,
[1:27:28] despising the hardship, meaning making
[1:27:31] it of no consideration because there's a
[1:27:33] joy that's waiting and that's what he
[1:27:35] valued most.
[1:27:37] It says he's the finisher. That word
[1:27:39] means the perfector, the one that
[1:27:42] completes the process to produce the
[1:27:44] expected results. Can you say praise the
[1:27:47] Lord this morning? He shows us what to
[1:27:50] do and then he puts us through the
[1:27:53] process to bring us to an expected end.
[1:27:57] He's got it all in control. He's got it
[1:27:59] all in his hands, church. Amen. He He's
[1:28:02] the one that's guiding and controlling
[1:28:04] all situations to bring us into his
[1:28:06] perfection, into his acceptance, into
[1:28:09] his very presence as sons and daughters
[1:28:11] of God, justified, accepted before him.
[1:28:14] That's what he's trying to do. Why are
[1:28:16] we worried? Why are we doubting? Why are
[1:28:20] we concerned?
[1:28:22] [snorts] We struggle so many times,
[1:28:24] church, when things get out of control.
[1:28:27] When things seem out of control, when
[1:28:28] we've done all we can and it's still
[1:28:30] going to hell in a hand basket. That's
[1:28:34] when we pull back. We're like, "Whoa,
[1:28:35] where's God? What did I do to deserve
[1:28:37] this? I prayed. I've got faith."
[1:28:40] That has nothing to do with it. God's
[1:28:43] got a plan. God has a word of the Lord
[1:28:48] to bring you to the time of your word.
[1:28:51] Amen. We can do everything right,
[1:28:53] church, that doesn't stop hard times. We
[1:28:57] can live by faith. That doesn't stop
[1:28:59] sickness. We can raise our kids
[1:29:03] to the best of our abilities, and that
[1:29:05] doesn't mean they're all going to come
[1:29:06] the way we want them to come.
[1:29:09] We can work hard every day and still get
[1:29:11] laid off.
[1:29:13] We can do everything right and that
[1:29:16] doesn't mean we walk or live in a bed of
[1:29:20] ease.
[1:29:22] Why? Because there's a word of the Lord
[1:29:24] that's preparing us.
[1:29:28] There's a word of the Lord that's
[1:29:29] preparing us. Church, we've got to be
[1:29:31] able to praise God no matter what.
[1:29:34] When you come to church on Sunday
[1:29:36] morning, I don't care how your week is,
[1:29:38] if you'll lift up your hands and you'll
[1:29:39] worship him. See, praise is about what
[1:29:42] he's done. Worship is about who he is.
[1:29:45] And the thing is, if you can worship him
[1:29:47] when you have nothing to praise about,
[1:29:49] it seems it'll change the atmosphere
[1:29:51] around you. It'll change your mind.
[1:29:53] It'll change the the very nature of your
[1:29:55] being. When you can say, "You're God. I
[1:29:58] love you. I trust you. I believe you.
[1:30:02] I'm sticking with you. Give me strength
[1:30:04] to keep on going." Amen. [snorts]
[1:30:09] I want you to see the end result of
[1:30:11] Joseph's life because so often what
[1:30:13] happens is we miss what God's doing
[1:30:15] because we're so busy trying to define
[1:30:16] what he's supposed to do in our lives.
[1:30:21] Remember Joseph's brothers come to him
[1:30:23] multiple times and he tricks them and
[1:30:25] hides their money back in their bags and
[1:30:26] then he hides his cup and accuses them
[1:30:28] of stealing them. And it's all Joseph
[1:30:30] manipulating the situation to spend time
[1:30:32] with them,
[1:30:34] trying to get him to come over. And so
[1:30:36] finally, Joseph's there and he's going
[1:30:37] to reveal himself. And he says, "And
[1:30:39] Joseph said unto his brethren, come near
[1:30:41] to me, I pray you." And they came near.
[1:30:43] And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother,
[1:30:44] whom you sold into Egypt."
[1:30:47] Now, I want you to catch verse 5. Now,
[1:30:50] therefore, be not grieved nor angry with
[1:30:53] yourselves that you sold me hither.
[1:30:56] Church, Joseph is comforting his
[1:30:58] brothers. They're the ones that threw
[1:31:01] him in a pit, sold him into slavery,
[1:31:03] deceived his father, gave him 13 years
[1:31:06] of hell. And Joseph's saying, "Don't
[1:31:09] worry about it. Don't be mad. Don't be
[1:31:11] grieved about it." He's comforting those
[1:31:13] that persecuted him. And what does he
[1:31:16] say? For God did send me before you to
[1:31:20] do what? Preserve life.
[1:31:24] He says, "For these two years had the
[1:31:25] famine been in the land, and yet there
[1:31:27] are five years in the which there shall
[1:31:29] neither be earring nor harvest. And God
[1:31:31] sent me."
[1:31:34] Hallelujah. God sent me before you to
[1:31:38] preserve you a posterity and the earth
[1:31:41] and to save your lives by a great
[1:31:43] deliverance. Look at Joseph's
[1:31:44] revelation. His prophetic vision was not
[1:31:48] about him. His prophetic vision was
[1:31:51] about them. It was about preservation of
[1:31:54] life. It was about service. It was about
[1:31:56] doing the right thing for his family,
[1:31:59] about preserving them so God could give
[1:32:01] them a land 400 years later.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? He's comforting and
[1:32:08] forgiving those that put him in this
[1:32:11] position, the hardships they put him
[1:32:13] through, because he says God was in it.
[1:32:17] God was in it. God's purpose was to
[1:32:19] preserve life. It was not to elevate
[1:32:21] Joseph. That was just a necessity to
[1:32:23] produce life and preserve life. So what
[1:32:26] is it church? Joseph now has character
[1:32:29] to match his revelation.
[1:32:32] See so often we think we've got the
[1:32:34] revelation but we don't have the
[1:32:35] character to produce what we believe in.
[1:32:38] And Joseph perhaps if he'd have been
[1:32:40] given this at 17 or 18 or 19 early years
[1:32:44] into his hardship, you know what he'd
[1:32:45] have done? Put him into prison. Let them
[1:32:48] go through what I went through. I don't
[1:32:50] know. I don't know what he would have
[1:32:51] done in his youth. But all I know is the
[1:32:54] word of the Lord produced the day where
[1:32:57] the word of Joseph produced the right
[1:32:59] thing. That when he's put into position,
[1:33:02] he says the right thing, he does the
[1:33:04] right thing, he has the right attitude,
[1:33:06] he produces Christ.
[1:33:09] Amen. Are you hearing me this morning?
[1:33:12] What is he trying to do? Produce himself
[1:33:14] in you. That's all that matters. because
[1:33:18] he's coming back for a bride without
[1:33:20] spot or wrinkle. He's coming back for
[1:33:22] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.
[1:33:26] Verse eight, he says, "So now it was not
[1:33:29] you that sent me hither, but God."
[1:33:38] Look at your own life. I think of
[1:33:40] brother Garfield sitting here, Brother
[1:33:42] Philly back there.
[1:33:44] God has pulled you away
[1:33:49] from a great ministry, a great church
[1:33:51] family, from family, from believers,
[1:33:54] from culture.
[1:33:56] Not easy, is it? Not easy, is it,
[1:34:01] Sister Brenda, Sister Moren, God has
[1:34:04] pulled you
[1:34:06] away from your family.
[1:34:10] But let me tell you this. He hasn't
[1:34:12] pulled you. He sent you
[1:34:16] to preserve life. You have no idea.
[1:34:21] You have no idea, Sister Brenda. On the
[1:34:24] day of judgment,
[1:34:28] what you could stand for.
[1:34:31] and all that you have endured,
[1:34:34] all that you have faced,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; everything you've dealt with was for one
[1:34:39] purpose, to preserve life.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Because the bride is about mercy, not
[1:34:46] about judgment. But she's got to come to
[1:34:49] a place of character where she says,
[1:34:52] "Not only do I forgive it you forgive
[1:34:54] you, let me comfort you.
[1:34:58] He's been my comfort. Let me be yours.
[1:35:01] Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] I've had hard things done to me in my
[1:35:07] life, unfair things said and done.
[1:35:11] But you know what? God's been in it.
[1:35:15] And with that per if we could only look
[1:35:17] forward with the same faith we have
[1:35:20] looking backward to realize he's got it
[1:35:22] all in control.
[1:35:25] Even my mistakes and failures, he's got
[1:35:28] it all in control. Amen. [snorts]
[1:35:31] So now it was not you that sent me
[1:35:33] hither, but God. And he hath made me a
[1:35:35] father to Pharaoh and lord of all his
[1:35:38] house, and a ruler throughout all the
[1:35:41] land of Egypt. Joseph now has this great
[1:35:43] revelation of what this was all about.
[1:35:47] Provision, preservation of life,
[1:35:50] redemption, forgiveness. And Joseph's
[1:35:52] own testimony is it was God all along.
[1:35:55] You had nothing to do with it. Yes, God
[1:35:57] used you. God used your jealous nature.
[1:36:00] God used your broken nature, but he used
[1:36:03] it. He used it, not you. It wasn't you.
[1:36:07] It was God that's doing it. And he's not
[1:36:08] bitter about it.
[1:36:10] Catch that. Joseph is not bitter about
[1:36:13] 13 years of slavery. He's not resentful.
[1:36:17] He's not harsh.
[1:36:19] He's not like, "Guys,
[1:36:22] there is going to be a price to pay."
[1:36:26] On that day, brothers,
[1:36:29] no.
[1:36:31] Comforts them. God was in it. Church, do
[1:36:35] you see the kind of character he's
[1:36:36] looking for? God help us. God help us.
[1:36:39] Amen. Joseph was grateful that God
[1:36:44] deemed him worthy to go through this
[1:36:47] process to come out the other side to
[1:36:50] perfect his plan for his people.
[1:36:53] Grateful. Grateful for 13 years of
[1:36:56] slavery and prison. And he forgave his
[1:36:59] brothers because he saw the hand of God
[1:37:00] in it. [snorts]
[1:37:02] You listen to brother Ron Spencer talk
[1:37:04] about his life in these past almost six
[1:37:06] years or so. And if you remember some of
[1:37:08] what he's told, and these are public
[1:37:09] statements. I'm not sharing anything
[1:37:10] that he he shared privately privately
[1:37:12] with me or anything. [snorts] But
[1:37:14] remember what he said. He said him and
[1:37:17] his brother his son Andrew were praying
[1:37:18] in the room and and the presence of God
[1:37:20] came in and he said, "If you'll trust
[1:37:22] me, I'll use you like never before."
[1:37:27] Now, where would our mind go if God came
[1:37:29] to us and said something like that?
[1:37:32] some great new ministry, some great new
[1:37:34] gift, some great new sign, something to
[1:37:37] elevate
[1:37:39] me.
[1:37:42] That's where our minds would go. And he
[1:37:44] wondered about it. What is this going to
[1:37:45] look like? And a few months later, what
[1:37:48] does God do? Gives him stage four brain
[1:37:52] and lung cancer.
[1:37:55] God sent him.
[1:37:58] God sent him. And what has it been ever
[1:38:01] since, church? It has been a man
[1:38:05] preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:38:09] with stage four cancer.
[1:38:12] 30 pills every morning.
[1:38:15] Treatment after treatment, surgery after
[1:38:18] surgery. But through it all, he has
[1:38:20] inspired faith. Through his ministry,
[1:38:23] others have been healed.
[1:38:26] He has obtained partial healing.
[1:38:30] supernaturally. Remember, his eye was
[1:38:31] preserved. God has preserved him, but
[1:38:35] God has not taken away the
[1:38:36] circumstances. Remember what I said, the
[1:38:38] privilege of God is to keep you,
[1:38:42] not keep you back from anything that
[1:38:44] would harm, anything that would hurt,
[1:38:46] anything that would damage. No, no, no.
[1:38:48] The hardship has got to come.
[1:38:51] And he has a greater testimony today
[1:38:53] than he's ever had. Because through it
[1:38:56] all, what has he been? Faithful.
[1:39:00] Faithful. Faithful. Faithful.
[1:39:04] See the difference between our
[1:39:05] interpretation and God's? Because our
[1:39:07] interpretation is me and God's
[1:39:10] interpretation is the body of Christ.
[1:39:13] We're here to serve. Ministers. We're
[1:39:15] here to serve. Elders in the church.
[1:39:17] We're here to serve. Officers of the
[1:39:19] church. We're here to serve. Mothers and
[1:39:21] fathers, we're here to serve. It's not
[1:39:23] about me. It's about him. It's about the
[1:39:25] body of Christ. [snorts] Amen. In
[1:39:28] sickness and in weakness. Brother Ron
[1:39:31] has preached this gospel to great
[1:39:32] effect.
[1:39:35] But remember, God interprets his word by
[1:39:37] bringing it to pass. Nobody here is
[1:39:39] volunteering for that.
[1:39:45] Job would say it this way. But he
[1:39:47] knoweth the way I take. And when he had
[1:39:50] tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
[1:39:56] Let's bring it down to our lives if we
[1:39:58] can as we start to close this morning.
[1:40:00] Peter would say this. Blessed be the God
[1:40:02] and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:40:04] which according to his abundant mercy,
[1:40:06] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[1:40:08] hope, a living hope, by the resurrection
[1:40:11] of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
[1:40:13] inheritance
[1:40:16] incorruptible,
[1:40:18] and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
[1:40:20] reserved in heaven for you. In other
[1:40:22] words, it's something eternal that
[1:40:24] awaits us, not something natural.
[1:40:27] Amen. Don't look to temporary things.
[1:40:31] Like brother Garfield was talking about,
[1:40:33] look to the eternal. Look to the
[1:40:36] spiritual events, not to the natural.
[1:40:38] Amen. These things we have. Listen, we
[1:40:41] have a natural inheritance here. God's
[1:40:44] provision is for us. That's our
[1:40:45] inheritance here. His healing is for us,
[1:40:48] his deliverance, his leadership, all
[1:40:49] these different things. Those are why
[1:40:51] we're here. But that is not our
[1:40:52] inheritance. This is all going to go.
[1:40:54] But there's something eternal waiting
[1:40:55] for us in the heavens that will never
[1:40:57] fade away.
[1:40:58] Listen to this. Verse 5, who are kept
[1:41:01] how?
[1:41:04] By my great Germanic discipline,
[1:41:07] by tradition,
[1:41:09] by force of nature, because my parents
[1:41:12] make me. Because if I don't, then
[1:41:15] somebody will think I'm not a believer.
[1:41:16] No. Who are kept by the power of God
[1:41:20] through faith unto salvation, ready to
[1:41:24] be revealed in the last time. Church,
[1:41:26] what we've experienced here, as great as
[1:41:28] it is, is not the whole deal. We haven't
[1:41:31] experienced the fullness of salvation.
[1:41:33] There's a greater salvation that's
[1:41:34] coming. There's a greater joy. There's a
[1:41:37] greater healing. There's a greater love.
[1:41:39] There's a greater rest. And what is it?
[1:41:40] It's an eternal love. It's an eternal
[1:41:42] joy. It's an eternal rest. Everything
[1:41:45] here is temporary. But there is a
[1:41:47] greater salvation that's coming for us.
[1:41:50] Amen. And it's ready to be revealed
[1:41:52] when? Now.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. That's
[1:41:55] the time of our word is that greater
[1:41:58] salvation being revealed. Amen. There's
[1:42:00] a greater sanctification coming.
[1:42:05] He says, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice?"
[1:42:07] Rejoicing in what? This great salvation
[1:42:10] that's coming, the power of God through
[1:42:12] faith in our lives, wherein ye greatly
[1:42:15] rejoice, though now for a season, if
[1:42:18] need be. Who determines the need,
[1:42:21] church? This guy? No, because I will
[1:42:26] never do something that I don't want to
[1:42:29] do by choice. I'm not going to do it.
[1:42:33] So, the need is determined by him. I can
[1:42:36] know the need and refuse the remedy. But
[1:42:39] a child of God, God says, "No, we're
[1:42:40] going to get this fixed. We're going to
[1:42:42] get this taken care of. We're going to
[1:42:45] resolve it. We're going to finish it."
[1:42:47] He says, "If need be, ye are in
[1:42:50] heaviness through manifold temptations.
[1:42:53] You're carrying a great burden through
[1:42:55] many trials is what he's saying there,
[1:42:57] church. What's our attitude? Here's our
[1:42:59] This is our life. This is our time. This
[1:43:02] is our day. This greater salvation ready
[1:43:04] to be revealed. The power of God through
[1:43:06] faith working in our lives. He says,
[1:43:08] "Wherein ye greatly rejoice."
[1:43:11] We ought to be rejoicing in the word
[1:43:14] that's for us, even when the word of the
[1:43:17] Lord tries us. That's what we're
[1:43:19] supposed to be doing. That's the
[1:43:21] challenge this morning. Even when we are
[1:43:23] in when he says we need heaviness, we
[1:43:27] need burdens, we need hardship, we need
[1:43:29] persecution, we need rejection, we need
[1:43:31] misunderstanding, we need sickness,
[1:43:34] we need
[1:43:37] can we still say, praise the Lord. Lord,
[1:43:39] I love you. Lord, I trust you. Lord, I
[1:43:42] believe in you. Lord, I'm going to stay
[1:43:44] faithful no matter what happens. He says
[1:43:48] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:43:51] more precious than of gold that
[1:43:53] perisheth though it be tried with fire.
[1:43:56] The only way to purify gold is with
[1:43:58] heat.
[1:44:00] And what does it do? It makes all the
[1:44:01] impurities rise to the surface so that
[1:44:03] they can scoop it off. None of us wants
[1:44:05] to see our impurities come to the
[1:44:07] surface, do we?
[1:44:09] Nobody.
[1:44:11] I don't want anybody to see those things
[1:44:14] that I try and keep hidden. But guess
[1:44:16] what? In the fire, all the impurities
[1:44:20] come out. And we say, "Where did that
[1:44:22] come from?" Lord, take that away
[1:44:26] that you could be reflected in my life.
[1:44:29] Cuz that's me. That's not you. That's
[1:44:32] what Joseph went through 13 years of
[1:44:33] hardship for. To get Joseph out of the
[1:44:35] equation so Christ could come through.
[1:44:38] [snorts]
[1:44:39] What does the trial of our faith
[1:44:40] produce?
[1:44:42] Gold. Tried in the fire. What does gold
[1:44:43] always represent? character. And it's
[1:44:46] the character of Christ. Amen. Character
[1:44:49] to match the position. Character to
[1:44:51] match the revelation. Character to match
[1:44:53] the gift. Character to match the
[1:44:54] calling. Character to match the power
[1:44:56] and authority that he's given you. What
[1:44:58] does it take? The working of the word of
[1:45:00] the Lord. That's what he's doing. The
[1:45:04] trying of the word of the Lord. Paul
[1:45:06] would say this in Ephesians. He says,
[1:45:07] "For we are his workmanship."
[1:45:11] In other words, he's doing a work.
[1:45:14] See, we're so busy trying to control and
[1:45:16] he's so busy trying to refine. And the
[1:45:18] two would go like this
[1:45:21] because he's trying to get us into a
[1:45:22] resurrection and a rapture and we're
[1:45:24] trying to put bread on the table, a car
[1:45:26] on the driveway, a roof over our head,
[1:45:27] clothes on our backs
[1:45:30] and maybe a little bit of fun and
[1:45:31] entertainment. And God's saying, "No, I
[1:45:34] need a bride."
[1:45:36] God saying, "I need a bride." We are his
[1:45:37] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:45:40] good works. Listen, the word of Joseph
[1:45:44] was that he would preserve life. That
[1:45:46] was his good works.
[1:45:48] But look at what it took in workmanship
[1:45:51] to get him there.
[1:45:54] Jesus took 33 years to come to adoption.
[1:46:01] Why? It's a process of time.
[1:46:04] It's a workmanship.
[1:46:07] We are created in Christ Jesus under
[1:46:08] good works which God hath before
[1:46:10] ordained. In other words, God has
[1:46:12] prepared a path for us to walk that we
[1:46:15] should walk in them. Brother would say
[1:46:17] this way. He says God is looking for
[1:46:19] character from men and women who can
[1:46:22] conduct themselves as sons and daughters
[1:46:25] of the king regardless of circumstance,
[1:46:28] regardless of hardship, regardless of
[1:46:31] what seems his silence, his lack of
[1:46:33] movement.
[1:46:35] Because remember church, when God moves,
[1:46:37] he really moves.
[1:46:40] And so often there are so many things
[1:46:42] going on in the background preparing.
[1:46:44] And all that happens is God reaches down
[1:46:46] and he presses a button and everything
[1:46:49] goes away
[1:46:50] in a moment. You say, "Where did that
[1:46:53] come from?" He was there all the time.
[1:46:56] He was working all the time, but he's
[1:46:58] waiting for you to catch up to his plan.
[1:47:00] That's all that's going on. He says God
[1:47:02] is looking for character for men and
[1:47:04] women who can conduct themselves as sons
[1:47:06] and daughters of the king. He says God
[1:47:08] have mercy on us that we will do it
[1:47:12] and he will and he does. Now I want to
[1:47:15] close with one scripture here that was
[1:47:18] really the where this whole service came
[1:47:21] from. I read it in my devotions many
[1:47:23] months ago and it blessed me to no end
[1:47:25] and the Lord just put a message in my
[1:47:26] heart this message this morning. But I
[1:47:29] want before I read this I want to tell
[1:47:30] you this. I want you to see your God
[1:47:32] this morning. I want you to see your
[1:47:35] savior. I want to see your lord. I want
[1:47:37] you to see his power. But I also want
[1:47:40] you to see his ways.
[1:47:42] And we've talked about his ways. Let me
[1:47:44] show you his power. It's a very obscure
[1:47:46] scripture. Habacook chapter 3 says, "God
[1:47:50] came from Teeman and the holy one from
[1:47:53] Mount Perin. Sila. His glory covered the
[1:47:57] heavens and the earth was full of his
[1:48:00] praise.
[1:48:02] And his brightness was as the light. He
[1:48:05] had horns coming out of his hands and
[1:48:08] and there was a hiding. There was the
[1:48:11] hiding of his power. Before him went the
[1:48:14] pestilence and burning coals went forth
[1:48:18] at his feet.
[1:48:21] This is a God of power.
[1:48:24] This is a God of victory.
[1:48:26] This is a God that changes
[1:48:28] circumstances. But I want to focus on
[1:48:30] verse verse six. It says, "He stood."
[1:48:36] Parents,
[1:48:38] do you ever have those moments where the
[1:48:40] kids are doing something and you've been
[1:48:41] sitting for a while
[1:48:44] and then you stand?
[1:48:47] What happens
[1:48:49] when you stand up? When they've been
[1:48:50] misbehaving, they've been talking.
[1:48:52] They've been fighting. They've been
[1:48:53] whatever. When dad stands up, what
[1:48:55] happens?
[1:48:57] Everyone gets quiet.
[1:49:00] Uh-oh.
[1:49:04] He stood and measured the earth
[1:49:09] and drove aunderder the nations. It the
[1:49:12] that phrase drove us under means he
[1:49:14] startled the nations. In other words, he
[1:49:18] took them by surprise.
[1:49:20] They thought they were secure. They
[1:49:22] thought they were established. But he
[1:49:24] stood and he startled the nations. He
[1:49:26] scattered them aunderder. And the
[1:49:28] everlasting mountains, the forever
[1:49:31] mountains were scattered.
[1:49:33] The perpetual, the ancient, the
[1:49:36] longstanding, the old hills did bow. He
[1:49:40] says his ways are everlasting.
[1:49:44] The constant enemies that harassed, that
[1:49:48] persecuted, that enslaved, that
[1:49:51] tortured, that bothered,
[1:49:54] scattered in a moment because he stood
[1:49:58] and came their way.
[1:50:01] Look at this. The everlasting mountains,
[1:50:04] the forever problems. Can I put it this
[1:50:07] way? The things that nobody has yet
[1:50:11] beat.
[1:50:13] The things that have bothered you all
[1:50:15] your life.
[1:50:17] The habits, the natures,
[1:50:21] the tryings, the sickness, the mind
[1:50:24] games,
[1:50:26] the offenses,
[1:50:28] the hardships.
[1:50:30] He says they scattered.
[1:50:34] Who's seen a mountain scatter here?
[1:50:38] Get ready.
[1:50:40] Get ready. Because when he moves,
[1:50:43] mountains scatter. When he moves, things
[1:50:46] that could not be changed change.
[1:50:50] Things that nobody could heal, he heals.
[1:50:54] Family that nobody could save, he saves.
[1:50:59] Natures that no one could get along
[1:51:02] with, he changes.
[1:51:06] That's the God that you're serving this
[1:51:07] morning.
[1:51:08] He says the perpetual hills,
[1:51:13] the things that are always in front of
[1:51:15] you when you look out your mo your house
[1:51:18] every morning. When I was in Calgary, it
[1:51:19] was so beautiful. There was two days
[1:51:21] there where we could just see the
[1:51:22] mountains so clearly.
[1:51:25] What's ever going to remove the Rocky
[1:51:26] Mountains, church?
[1:51:29] We would say nothing can move them.
[1:51:32] 10,000 ft of rock.
[1:51:35] Cold, hard, forbidding.
[1:51:39] We could take all the equipment in the
[1:51:40] earth and work for a millennia and not
[1:51:42] move those mountains.
[1:51:46] He moves it in a day. He moves it in a
[1:51:49] moment. Those things that are always in
[1:51:51] front of you, always standing, always
[1:51:54] taunting, always bothering,
[1:51:57] always holding you back.
[1:52:00] He says they'll bow. Why? Because his
[1:52:03] ways are everlasting.
[1:52:05] Look at Joseph. Joseph's a slave for 13
[1:52:08] years. A prisoner.
[1:52:10] It differs on on the studies of it. Some
[1:52:13] believe that as early as a year into his
[1:52:14] slavery, he was in prison. 12 years of
[1:52:17] prison. Can you talk about a perpetual
[1:52:19] hill, an everlasting mountain, slavery,
[1:52:23] and now jail time? Never getting out,
[1:52:25] church. You're never getting out for
[1:52:26] raping a captain of the guard's wife.
[1:52:29] Never going to happen.
[1:52:31] And yet one day a messenger came and he
[1:52:34] walked out never to go to jail again,
[1:52:37] never to be a slave again. That's the
[1:52:39] kind of God we serve. One day God
[1:52:42] visited him in prison. One day God
[1:52:44] showed his hand. One day God stood and
[1:52:49] in that moment Joseph walked in to the
[1:52:53] time of his word.
[1:52:55] Hallelujah. Those ancient hills of
[1:52:59] slavery and injustice and false
[1:53:01] accusations bowed down before Joseph.
[1:53:06] Family problems bowed down before
[1:53:08] Joseph. Famine bowed before Joseph.
[1:53:13] Why? Because he endured the trying of
[1:53:16] the word of the Lord. [snorts]
[1:53:19] Let me put it this way, church. You know
[1:53:21] the Bible says you're a mountain.
[1:53:24] There are a lot of mountains.
[1:53:26] Satan has raised a lot of mountains.
[1:53:29] The kingdoms of this world have raised a
[1:53:31] lot of mountains in our lives. But guess
[1:53:33] what? There's only one mountain that
[1:53:35] will stand when this is all said and
[1:53:38] done. It'll stand the test of time.
[1:53:40] Every other mountain will bow before
[1:53:41] your God.
[1:53:44] Psalms 32, he says, "For the Lord had
[1:53:47] chosen Zion. He had desired it for his
[1:53:50] habitation. This is my rest forever.
[1:53:54] Here will I dwell.
[1:53:56] For who has desired it?
[1:53:59] I have.
[1:54:01] Your God desires you as his dwelling
[1:54:04] place. He says he will rest with you
[1:54:08] forever. Psalms 125 says, "They that
[1:54:10] trust in the Lord shall be as Mount
[1:54:12] Zion, which
[1:54:16] may not,
[1:54:18] should not,
[1:54:20] cannot,
[1:54:21] which cannot be removed, but abideth
[1:54:26] forever."
[1:54:28] And behold, I, John, saw the city of New
[1:54:31] Jerusalem coming down as a bride adorned
[1:54:34] out of heaven.
[1:54:36] Church, that's the day of your word when
[1:54:39] you come down. Bone of his bone, flesh
[1:54:41] of his flesh, dressed in his
[1:54:42] righteousness for all to see. That's the
[1:54:45] mountain that will never be removed.
[1:54:47] Everything else destroyed.
[1:54:50] One mountain comes down and they bow
[1:54:52] before us.
[1:54:54] One quote as we close. You say, "I've
[1:54:57] had so many trials. I've just been
[1:55:00] dragged from pillar to post." He said,
[1:55:02] "Haven't I just told you that that's
[1:55:04] God?" because he trusted you. You won't
[1:55:08] fail him, will you? He says, "You might
[1:55:09] have fallen. You might have made a
[1:55:11] mistake, but you won't fail him now,
[1:55:13] will you? You'll rise up again like a
[1:55:17] real soldier, grip the sword, and come
[1:55:20] forward again." Amen. God bless you.
[1:55:23] Let's stand together.
[1:55:27] Amen. Anybody feeling like the word of
[1:55:30] the Lord is trying them these days?
[1:55:32] I should get a resounding amen out of
[1:55:34] that. Amen.
[1:55:37] Something's trying us. I trust it's the
[1:55:40] word of the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:42] Anybody got some mountains that won't
[1:55:44] move?
[1:55:47] Two.
[1:55:49] Anybody got some mountains that don't
[1:55:51] move? Where we pray and we pray. We
[1:55:54] trust and we trust. We believe and we
[1:55:56] believe. We try and we try
[1:55:59] and the mountain stands there taunting
[1:56:01] us. You can't go over, you can't go
[1:56:04] under. You can't go through.
[1:56:08] The word of the Lord is trying you. But
[1:56:11] know this, there's coming a time of your
[1:56:14] word when God stands and he says he's
[1:56:19] ready.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; She's ready.
[1:56:22] The work is done.
[1:56:24] Now the work is about to start. and he
[1:56:27] steps into our life. He steps into our
[1:56:29] situation. And all of a sudden, we see
[1:56:31] the salvation that we've been looking
[1:56:32] for. We see the healing we've been
[1:56:34] looking for. We see the deliverance
[1:56:35] we've been looking for. We see the
[1:56:36] fellowship we've been looking for. We
[1:56:38] see the provision we've been looking
[1:56:39] for. We get the answer we've been
[1:56:42] looking for. But you'll notice this, it
[1:56:44] always comes his way. And what we
[1:56:46] thought it was is not always what we'll
[1:56:48] be, but we'll get the answer that we've
[1:56:50] been looking for. Amen.
[1:56:53] God's got to get you ready for his
[1:56:54] glory.
[1:56:57] See, in all of this, Joseph knew, "I
[1:57:00] can't do anything." He was a total
[1:57:01] failure. But when can when it came down
[1:57:04] to the end of it, he saw God was in it.
[1:57:07] And so, the glory went to God, not
[1:57:08] himself.
[1:57:11] And from that moment on, you couldn't
[1:57:13] move Joseph. When Joseph came to a
[1:57:15] revelation that God's got it all in in
[1:57:17] his control, that God's the one that
[1:57:19] takes away favor and God's the one that
[1:57:21] gives favor, that God's the one that
[1:57:23] takes away position and satisfaction and
[1:57:24] all these things and puts me into these
[1:57:26] hard places. When he came to a
[1:57:28] realization that there was a purpose in
[1:57:29] it all, you couldn't stop him. And I'm
[1:57:32] trying to get you to understand this
[1:57:33] morning while you're in the situation,
[1:57:36] God's got it in control. There's a word
[1:57:39] of the Lord that's trying to bring you
[1:57:41] to the time of your word.
[1:57:44] Amen. Let's close our eyes if we would.
[1:57:50] God's trying to get you to a place
[1:57:53] where it's just you and him.
[1:57:57] So, I want to ask you this morning, if
[1:57:59] you've got a mountain,
[1:58:02] if you've got a perpetual mountain, an
[1:58:04] ancient mountain, a long-standing
[1:58:06] mountain that can't move, you think I
[1:58:09] want you to raise your hands to him this
[1:58:11] morning.
[1:58:13] You say, "Lord,
[1:58:16] I'm in a trial.
[1:58:18] I'm in a test.
[1:58:21] But Lord, all I'm asking you to do is
[1:58:23] keep me focused on you. Lord, get me
[1:58:28] close to you
[1:58:31] so I can come to the day of your
[1:58:34] visitation,
[1:58:35] ready to receive your promise." Amen.
[1:58:38] Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[1:58:42] Lord, how thankful we are,
[1:58:45] Lord, that we've got a message. We've
[1:58:46] got a word that shows us, Lord, the
[1:58:49] beginning to the end.
[1:58:51] But Lord, so many times in these
[1:58:53] hardships and trials, Lord, our eyes get
[1:58:56] focused on our five senses, the things
[1:58:58] that we sense around us, the things we
[1:59:00] see and touch and hear, Lord, and Satan
[1:59:03] goes to working and he builds a mountain
[1:59:05] in front of us, heavenly father. But
[1:59:07] Lord, you're a mountain moving God.
[1:59:10] Lord, you're a jailbusting God. You're a
[1:59:12] chain-breaking God. Lord, you're a
[1:59:15] mountain scattering deity.
[1:59:18] And so, Lord, I'm asking your grace for
[1:59:19] your people this morning. Lord, you see
[1:59:21] the many hands raised this morning.
[1:59:24] Lord, we're in a battle. Every day is a
[1:59:26] battle, heavenly father. Lord, I pray
[1:59:28] you give us faith. Give us power through
[1:59:31] faith, Lord, to stand the test. Lord,
[1:59:34] your prophet said to overcome was to
[1:59:35] recognize Satan in every one of his
[1:59:37] tricks and to know that greater is he
[1:59:40] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:59:42] world. Lord, may these mountains go
[1:59:45] before us. Lord, may these enemies
[1:59:47] scatter. Lord, these tormentors, these
[1:59:50] harassers that come after us day by day,
[1:59:52] Lord, may they bow in your presence
[1:59:53] before your word. Lord, I pray you help
[1:59:56] us to surrender to the trying fire.
[1:59:59] Lord, that character could come forth
[2:00:00] this morning, Lord. Lord, we want
[2:00:02] victory. You want character. Lord, I
[2:00:06] pray you help us to receive what you
[2:00:07] have for us by your way in your time,
[2:00:10] heavenly father. Lord, bless your
[2:00:12] people. Each hand that's raised, Lord
[2:00:14] God, it's an expression of faith. They
[2:00:15] defy gravity this morning, Lord, to
[2:00:18] express their need, Lord. And I'm
[2:00:20] trusting to express their faith, Lord,
[2:00:21] as they've heard your message this
[2:00:23] morning. Lord, bless your people, we
[2:00:25] ask, Lord, those that aren't here this
[2:00:27] morning, those that are traveling, those
[2:00:28] that are sick, those that are away.
[2:00:30] Lord, we pray your mercy and grace in
[2:00:32] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[2:00:39] Through the fire again. 1272.
[2:00:52] So many times I've questioned
[2:00:55] certain circumstances.
[2:00:59] the things that I could not understand.
[2:01:06] Many times in trials,
[2:01:10] weakness blurs my vision
[2:01:13] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[2:01:20] But it's I am [singing] reminded [music]
[2:01:23] that I've never been forsaken.
[2:01:27] I've never had to stand one test alone.
[2:01:32] [music]
[2:01:33] And then I look at all the victories the
[2:01:38] spirit [music]
[2:01:38] rises up in [singing] me. And it's
[2:01:41] through the fire my weakness [music] is
[2:01:44] made strong.
[2:01:49] He never [music]
[2:01:50] promised that the cross would not get
[2:01:53] heavy [music]
[2:01:55] and the hill would [singing] not be hard
[2:01:58] to climb.
[2:02:02] And he [music] never offered
[2:02:06] our victories without fighting.
[2:02:08] [singing]
[2:02:08] But [music] he said help would always
[2:02:11] come in time.
[2:02:16] So just [music] remember when you're
[2:02:18] standing
[2:02:19] in the valley [singing]
[2:02:21] of decision
[2:02:23] and the adversary [music] says give in.
[2:02:29] Just hold on.
[2:02:33] [music] My God will show up
[2:02:36] and he will [music] take you through the
[2:02:40] fire again.
[2:02:45] So many times I've [music and singing]
[2:02:47] questioned
[2:02:49] certain circumstances,
[2:02:52] things [music]
[2:02:53] that I could not understand.
[2:02:59] And many times in trials,
[2:03:03] weakness blurs [singing] my vision
[2:03:05] [music]
[2:03:06] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[2:03:11] [music]
[2:03:13] But it's [singing] then I am reminded
[2:03:16] that I've never [music] been forsaken.
[2:03:20] I've never had to stand one [singing]
[2:03:23] test the Lord.
[2:03:27] And as I look at all my victories, the
[2:03:31] spirit [music and singing]
[2:03:32] rises up in me. And it's through the
[2:03:36] fire my weakness [music] is made strong.
[2:03:42] He [singing] never promised [music]
[2:03:45] that the cross would not get heavy, that
[2:03:49] the hill would [singing] not [music] be
[2:03:51] hard to climb.
[2:03:57] He [singing and music] never offered
[2:04:00] victories without fighting. But he said
[2:04:04] help would [singing] always [music] come
[2:04:06] in time.
[2:04:10] So just remember [music and singing]
[2:04:11] when you're standing in the valley of
[2:04:16] decision [singing]
[2:04:17] and the adversary [music] says give in.
[2:04:23] Just hold on.
[2:04:27] [music] Our Lord will show up
[2:04:31] and he will take you [music and singing]
[2:04:33] through the fire again.
[2:04:39] And I [music] know within myself
[2:04:42] [singing]
[2:04:42] that I would surely perish. But if I
[2:04:46] trust the hand of God, he'll shield
[2:04:50] [music] the flames again and again.
[2:04:56] He never promised [music]
[2:04:58] that the cross would not get heavy, that
[2:05:02] the hill would [singing] not be hard to
[2:05:06] climb.
[2:05:14] [music]
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Help would [singing] always come in
[2:05:20] time.
[2:05:23] So friends [music] remember when you're
[2:05:25] standing [singing]
[2:05:27] in the valley of decision [music]
[2:05:30] and the adversary says give in.
[2:05:35] [singing and music]
[2:05:36] Just hold on.
[2:05:40] [music] Our Lord will [singing] show up
[2:05:44] and he will take you [music] through the
[2:05:47] fire again.
[2:05:53] In everything give him thanks. 975
[2:05:59] In
[2:06:02] everything
[2:06:06] give him thanks.
[2:06:10] Give [singing] him thanks. [music]
[2:06:12] Different song.
[2:06:15] In
[2:06:18] everything [singing and music]
[2:06:21] give him thanks.
[2:06:24] [music]
[2:06:28] For in the [singing] good times,
[2:06:32] praise his name. [music]
