[38:38] him back and good to see them
[38:40] back as well amen god bless you amen
[38:42] thank you for your prayers for my dad
[38:44] i certainly appreciated that prayer
[38:46] today brother david i
[38:47] spoke with him yesterday and he'd put in
[38:49] nine hours on a skid steer so
[38:51] for you those of you that don't know
[38:52] that's like a it's kind of like a
[38:55] forklift for farm use you know it's got
[38:56] a bucket or a blade on it or that sort
[38:58] of thing
[38:59] so he's he's back in the saddle he did
[39:01] 16 000 steps i think yesterday
[39:03] or the day before so he's he's putting
[39:05] in time on it he's throwing tires around
[39:07] and things so
[39:08] he's certainly on the mend he does have
[39:09] a uh a surgery
[39:11] for one other small thing coming up in a
[39:13] couple weeks but that should just be a
[39:15] day's surgery he'll be in and out
[39:17] certainly within 24 hours lord willing
[39:19] so certainly appreciate that
[39:21] trusting the lord is continuing to work
[39:23] there's some things that my brother
[39:24] shared with us that
[39:25] certainly show there's a difference of
[39:27] of heart there
[39:29] but uh we don't just want to be
[39:30] temporary usually when you have a
[39:32] near-death experience
[39:33] what happens is that you you're you're
[39:36] real close to god and you're thinking
[39:37] deep spiritual things and then you pull
[39:39] away as the
[39:40] shock and the terror of it wears off
[39:42] amen but we want god to do a complete
[39:44] work in his life
[39:45] and then also uh you know never reigns
[39:48] but a poor's blanca's dad was taken to
[39:50] the hospital
[39:50] uh just a couple days ago with some
[39:52] issues with his heart
[39:54] so i believe he went back home today
[39:57] yesterday um but he's got kind of an
[40:00] irregular
[40:00] beat there that's uh causing some
[40:02] fluctuation in the blood pressure
[40:04] and it's causing clots in his in his
[40:06] system so we just want to hold him up
[40:08] before the lord in prayer amen just
[40:10] before we go to the word let's bow our
[40:11] heads
[40:13] lord god heavenly father we ask your
[40:16] grace for this service once again lord
[40:18] amen lord we've all gathered human flesh
[40:21] has gathered lord but without your
[40:22] spirit present lord it's all in vain
[40:24] and so we pray lord you anoint the
[40:26] speaker and the here
[40:27] lord that your spirit would just have
[40:29] free reign in each one of us lord god to
[40:31] encourage us strengthen us draw us
[40:33] closer to you
[40:34] lord burn out more of this world and
[40:36] fill it with your word lord we pray
[40:38] lord just touch your people again we ask
[40:40] lord have your way
[40:41] and your will and your purpose in this
[40:43] service we ask in jesus christ's name
[40:45] amen amen god bless you joshua 10 verse
[40:48] 1
[40:49] it says and it came to pass when adam
[40:51] isaac king of jerusalem
[40:53] had heard how joshua had taken ai and
[40:55] had utterly destroyed it
[40:56] as he had done to jericho and her king
[40:58] so he had done to ai and her king
[41:00] and how the inhabitants of gide gibeon
[41:02] had made peace with israel and were
[41:03] among them
[41:04] that they fear greatly because gibeon
[41:06] was a great city
[41:07] as one of the royal cities and because
[41:09] it was greater than a.i
[41:10] and all the men thereof were mighty
[41:15] wherefore adam isaac king of jerusalem
[41:17] sent a hoam king of hebron
[41:19] and unto pyram king of jarimath and unto
[41:21] jephiah king of lakish and under deborah
[41:23] king of eglon saying
[41:25] look at this isn't working up here just
[41:26] so you know come up unto me
[41:28] and help me that we might smite gibeon
[41:30] for it hath made peace with joshua and
[41:32] with the children of israel
[41:34] therefore the five kings of the amorites
[41:35] the king of jerusalem the king of hebron
[41:37] the king of jamath the king of lakish
[41:39] the king of eglon
[41:40] gathered themselves together and went up
[41:42] they and all their hosts
[41:43] and encamped before gibeon and made war
[41:46] against it
[41:47] and the men of gideon sent unto joshua
[41:49] to the camp to gilgal saying slack not
[41:51] thine hand from thy servants
[41:53] come up to us quickly and save us and
[41:55] help us for
[41:56] all the kings of the amorites that dwell
[41:58] in the mountains are gathered
[41:59] together against us so joshua ascended
[42:02] from gilgal he
[42:03] and all the people of war with him and
[42:05] all the mighty men
[42:06] of valor amen may god bless the reading
[42:09] of his word you may be seated
[42:11] amen we want to continue on our series
[42:13] on the overcomers and i want to take a
[42:15] title tonight of in the line of duty
[42:18] amen in the line of duty and
[42:19] as we set a foundation i always like to
[42:21] do a quick recap to
[42:23] to show how we got where we are and we
[42:24] saw the supernatural crossing of jordan
[42:27] where they were led by the word they
[42:28] were led by the the ark of the covenant
[42:30] with the priests bearing it on their
[42:31] shoulders in obedience to god
[42:33] amen and we know that this was a type of
[42:35] the infilling of the holy spirit
[42:37] and right after that they went to gilgal
[42:38] and that's where all the men were
[42:39] circumcised because they hadn't been
[42:41] circumcised in all the years that they
[42:42] were walking in the desert amen and
[42:45] that's again a confirmation of the type
[42:46] of receiving
[42:47] the holy spirit paul said that our
[42:49] circumcision was the holy spirit and it
[42:50] was the circumcising
[42:51] of our heart amen then after that we saw
[42:54] the supernatural destruction of jericho
[42:56] without siege weapons or tunnels or
[42:58] trickery
[42:58] or or great leadership necessarily but
[43:01] again it was with the word leading the
[43:02] way
[43:03] in full obedience to god and the walls
[43:05] tumbled down and as we spoke before
[43:07] the walls tumbling down is what gave
[43:08] them access to the city because it
[43:10] created a perfect ramp up and over
[43:12] the dirt and the earth that they had
[43:14] built into their walls
[43:15] but we know that in that time aiken
[43:17] sinned and he took the gold and the
[43:18] silver and the babylonian garment and
[43:20] hid it
[43:21] and then we saw the failure of joshua's
[43:23] leadership because he presumed to go to
[43:24] ai
[43:25] and do it the way that the the spies had
[43:27] told him to take it with just a you know
[43:29] 3 000 men
[43:30] instead of seeking the lord and when he
[43:32] did that the lord didn't have a chance
[43:33] to say hey you can't go out because
[43:34] there's sin in the camp
[43:36] so they went out and they lost a few men
[43:38] then they came back and the sin of
[43:40] of akin was revealed and it was cleansed
[43:42] him and his family were destroyed all of
[43:44] his stuff was destroyed outside the camp
[43:46] and then from there we saw the resulting
[43:48] destruction of a.i where god says you
[43:49] don't take just a few you take everybody
[43:51] and you go and you wipe them out and
[43:53] here's the plan that i have for you they
[43:54] went and they did it and ai was
[43:56] completely destroyed
[43:57] and then after that we saw the fear come
[43:59] into the hearts of the gibeonites and
[44:00] they
[44:01] pretended to be from a far country and
[44:02] said we want to create an alliance with
[44:04] you
[44:04] and joshua and the princess said okay
[44:07] we're going to do it and the scripture
[44:08] says they didn't seek god nor the urim
[44:09] thumb
[44:10] amen they went outside they did not seek
[44:12] god they did not ask god what they were
[44:13] supposed to do
[44:14] and in doing so they completely
[44:16] disobeyed the word of god as we read in
[44:18] deuteronomy where he had told moses make
[44:19] no alliance with anyone
[44:21] doesn't matter if they're from your
[44:22] country from your area or not you don't
[44:24] ally with them
[44:25] you set yourselves apart and you set
[44:26] yourself as a people to me don't get
[44:28] tied into worldly things
[44:29] stay away from it and i'll give you
[44:31] everything that you have need of amen
[44:34] and we see now that the truth with the
[44:35] gibeonites has caused a problem for
[44:37] israel because now instead of facing one
[44:39] kingdom
[44:40] they say the gibeonites were a great
[44:41] city it was a royal city
[44:43] and we're going to join together now
[44:45] we're going to band together so because
[44:46] of
[44:46] aitkin's uh you know his failure earlier
[44:49] and then now we have joshua makes
[44:51] another failure
[44:52] with the line with the gibby knights now
[44:54] joshua gets himself in a pickle
[44:55] because he's got five against one now
[44:57] he's got five kingdoms instead of one
[44:59] but one thing i love about this is that
[45:00] each and every one of those kings is a
[45:02] part of the amorite kingdom
[45:03] amen and we know that what they were
[45:05] supposed to do was go when the cup of
[45:06] the amorites was full
[45:07] and then god was going to bring full
[45:09] justice on the amorites so these are
[45:10] part
[45:11] of a condemned people these are part of
[45:13] a judge people they have a prophetic
[45:15] word that's against them
[45:16] and then god says joshua it's up to you
[45:18] to handle this situation now
[45:20] amen i want you to catch something that
[45:22] even though joshua had gotten them in a
[45:24] pickle god's grace was still there to
[45:25] get them out of it amen
[45:26] god's not going to be stopped by our
[45:28] little fumbles by our big fumbles by our
[45:30] big mistakes even amen but rather he'll
[45:33] take them and he'll turn them into a
[45:34] situation to what
[45:35] demonstrate again his power his glory
[45:37] his majesty
[45:38] that he is above and so far higher than
[45:41] anything we could ever ask or think of
[45:42] him amen
[45:43] that he can take the poorest of
[45:45] situations the ways we
[45:46] we just mess things up in life so much
[45:49] and he can take that and he can turn it
[45:50] into a work for his glory
[45:52] and he can magnify himself in front of
[45:53] not only you but in front of those that
[45:55] are around you amen
[45:56] it's not just one on one now it's five
[45:58] kingdoms against one and god
[46:00] says all right we're gonna have a
[46:01] situation here and i'm gonna take care
[46:02] of it
[46:03] but what brought this around was joshua
[46:05] and the princes that had done what they
[46:06] thought best
[46:07] amen they listened to their carnal
[46:09] thinking they listened to the way of man
[46:11] they thought this would be a good idea
[46:12] it never hurts to have some friends
[46:14] god said you're not here to make friends
[46:16] you're here to take the country
[46:17] and then brother branham had this to say
[46:19] he said after being commissioned
[46:21] he failed his commission by trying to do
[46:23] it in the way that he thought was best
[46:26] therefore it teaches us again that we
[46:27] can't take what we think is best
[46:29] or what man thinks is best we've got to
[46:32] take the way that god has said his best
[46:34] therefore to follow the word of the lord
[46:36] is always the best
[46:38] take the way god said amen stay with the
[46:41] word every single time and satan just
[46:43] wanted to get that one word in with eve
[46:45] and ever since then he's just trying to
[46:46] inject one word to get you off
[46:48] of what god has said to do amen if he
[46:50] can get you to just vary by a
[46:52] just the end of a degree just the barest
[46:54] of a degree
[46:55] you'll be off track when the when time
[46:57] comes for the bride to go away man
[46:59] you've got to stay completely with the
[47:01] word amen
[47:02] but we saw as before that after the the
[47:05] issue at a.i
[47:06] and after the gibeonites that joshua
[47:08] never failed to lead them according to
[47:10] the word of the lord
[47:10] there was never a failure in joshua's
[47:12] leadership after that amen
[47:15] and so joshua now comes to this
[47:16] situation and he knows that he has full
[47:19] confidence he should have full
[47:20] confidence in who he is and what he is
[47:21] because there's no sin in the camp
[47:23] he has sought the lord right and he says
[47:25] lord what do you want me to do in this
[47:27] situation
[47:28] he doesn't just presume on anything he
[47:29] comes back he steps back he says god
[47:31] what is your plan for this we read in
[47:33] verse 8 here it says and the lord said
[47:35] unto joshua
[47:36] fear them not for i have delivered them
[47:38] into thine hand
[47:39] there shall not a man of them stand
[47:41] before thee amen look at god's word
[47:43] first thing he says
[47:44] fear them not amen don't worry about it
[47:46] don't have doubt
[47:48] don't sit back and consider the
[47:49] situation he says fear them not
[47:51] even if you haven't seen them you have
[47:53] perhaps an idea of what that army looks
[47:55] like you know that they might have
[47:56] horses and chariots and trained men and
[47:58] giants
[47:58] doesn't matter what you've heard doesn't
[48:00] matter what you see he says fear
[48:02] them not why because i have delivered
[48:04] them into your hand
[48:06] amen he puts it into joshua's hand he
[48:08] doesn't put it into somebody else's
[48:09] and he doesn't say this is for the army
[48:11] he says joshua i have delivered them
[48:13] into your hand
[48:14] personally amen this is your victory
[48:16] that you're going to win
[48:17] you will lead them i am commissioning
[48:19] you to destroy them and i have delivered
[48:21] this enemy
[48:22] into your hand amen when you read that
[48:25] scripture don't think joshua's hand
[48:27] amen think vicial shaw's hand hey man
[48:29] think priscilla coffee's hands think
[48:31] brenda coffee's hand and then think
[48:33] josh columbo's handy man if you serve
[48:35] the save god and you're in the same
[48:36] promise then you ought to have the same
[48:38] result
[48:38] so you can put the exact thing that he
[48:40] said to joshua into your name amen you
[48:42] can write your name into the title and
[48:43] say
[48:44] i'm going to have them delivered into my
[48:45] hand because i have confirmed that he
[48:47] has commissioned me to do what i am
[48:49] doing here today
[48:50] amen i have sought him out and he has
[48:51] told me what to do and
[48:53] on that basis i don't have to fear
[48:55] because he has given into my hand
[48:56] everything that stands before me today
[48:58] amen
[48:59] amen if you serve the same god receive
[49:01] the same message that joshua did
[49:03] what is it fear not for i have delivered
[49:05] them into your
[49:06] hand amen the enemy is delivered to you
[49:08] and you are anointed and commissioned
[49:11] anointed and commissioned to do whatever
[49:14] it takes to destroy them amen
[49:17] brother braham said anything that was
[49:18] included in the atonement is the
[49:20] personal
[49:21] property of every believer when a man
[49:23] gets saved or a woman
[49:25] boy or girl god gives them a checkbook
[49:28] as
[49:28] it was with jesus name at the bottom of
[49:30] every check for
[49:31] anything redemptive blessing that jesus
[49:33] died for
[49:34] it's your personal property don't be
[49:37] afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven
[49:39] will recognize it jesus said whatsoever
[49:42] things you desire when you pray believe
[49:44] you receive it
[49:45] whatever you ask the father in my name
[49:46] that will i do the unlimited
[49:49] unsearchable riches of jesus christ in
[49:51] that promise amen
[49:52] listen to that the unlimited
[49:54] unsearchable reaches that means you
[49:56] cannot
[49:56] run it you cannot take too much of it
[49:58] you cannot overdraft it
[49:59] you can't think something that's too
[50:01] great for god for you to do amen
[50:03] he says now but before you could do it
[50:05] now god does that then he sends people
[50:07] into the church
[50:08] such as preachers teachers evangelists
[50:10] gifts of healing
[50:11] don't mean the man now can heal you it
[50:13] means that he has faith in what he's
[50:15] talking about
[50:16] and proves it by the bible after that
[50:18] there's prophets that sears all these
[50:20] gifts are without repentance
[50:21] office gifts are sent by god for
[50:23] ordained of god
[50:24] and they're sent into the church they're
[50:26] born in you them traits are born in you
[50:28] when you come into this world
[50:30] you just find your position go on with
[50:33] christ
[50:34] and all those things are in the kingdom
[50:35] of god and it's all for the perfecting
[50:37] of the church and to bring it together
[50:40] amen so we're not just talking about
[50:41] promises now he says now we're talking
[50:43] about commissions
[50:44] right that's what he's talking about we
[50:45] don't want to look at the pro the bible
[50:47] is just general promises
[50:48] this is the title deed for us amen
[50:51] everything in there that you can place
[50:52] in the word for your day belongs to you
[50:54] but he's talking about now stepping into
[50:56] a commission as to something
[50:57] to do for the kingdom of god amen to
[50:59] stand in your place to find your
[51:01] position and on that basis
[51:02] you start using the word now as a weapon
[51:04] to take down anything that would stand
[51:06] in front of you
[51:07] why you're an overcomer that's what
[51:08] we're preaching on is an overcoming
[51:10] series
[51:10] and so if you're an overcomer that means
[51:12] there must be a battle and there must be
[51:14] a victory
[51:14] amen and how are you going to defeat him
[51:16] you're going to defeat him by the word
[51:17] of god and faith in that word of god
[51:19] every single time amen brother braham
[51:22] says oh it's glorious
[51:24] to find your position amen we all say
[51:26] amen but then he says and no one can do
[51:28] anything unless you know properly
[51:30] what you're doing and how do you know
[51:31] properly what you're doing you know when
[51:33] god has confirmed to you
[51:34] this is what i've called you to be this
[51:36] is what i've called you to do and that
[51:37] can only come down on your knees
[51:39] i mean that can only come with a
[51:40] conversation with god on a regular basis
[51:42] lord what would you have your servant to
[51:44] do amen what would you have your
[51:46] daughter to do what would you have your
[51:47] son to do
[51:48] amen in the place that you have put me
[51:50] what do you want me to do for you today
[51:53] amen brother baby says he was god
[51:56] infinite he knowed how it would be he
[51:58] had in his great heart how he would
[51:59] bring all this about
[52:01] and then if he foreknew the church for
[52:02] new christ foreknew the plan and set it
[52:04] all in order
[52:05] and the world turning around and you
[52:07] being dead to yourself dead in christ
[52:09] and alive after you're dead to yourself
[52:11] alive in christ
[52:12] god's working all things together for
[52:15] the good to them that love him
[52:16] and how can you lose amen you just can't
[52:20] lose there's no way of losing
[52:22] why because his plan does not include
[52:24] failure his plan does not include loss
[52:26] his plan includes victory and overcoming
[52:28] amen
[52:29] the church could just really find that
[52:31] out if you could just positionally find
[52:33] your place in christ and all these other
[52:35] things would just fade away
[52:36] like a shadow everyone that cometh to
[52:39] god that's true must have listen to this
[52:41] now
[52:41] must have the shadows the temptations
[52:43] and fears and so forth
[52:45] but just don't get i'll tore up about it
[52:47] what's a little suffering for a little
[52:49] while knowing that the glory of god
[52:51] will be revealed in the last days when
[52:53] jesus comes when we'll be made like unto
[52:56] him
[52:57] amen he's just working everything
[52:59] together he says
[53:00] did you know maybe if you were sick or
[53:02] something happened to you
[53:04] that god might have had to do that just
[53:05] to bring you a little closer to him
[53:08] amen we find that god takes us through a
[53:10] child when god brings victory in our
[53:11] life when god doesn't work and us that's
[53:13] when we're closest is when god is doing
[53:15] the work
[53:15] amen we don't get close to god when
[53:17] we're going through the ease of life
[53:18] amen when the cars never break down
[53:20] when we have the house we want when our
[53:22] health is perfect when we have her at
[53:23] the perfect weight
[53:24] our kids are all saved amen that's not
[53:27] when we're closest to god we're closest
[53:28] to god when he's putting us through
[53:30] something that causes us to rely on him
[53:32] that causes us to seek him amen that
[53:34] causes us to go before his face and say
[53:36] god i need you in a way i've never had
[53:38] you before
[53:38] will you step on the scene amen so let
[53:41] me put it this way as brother braham
[53:43] says
[53:43] maybe your commission is to defeat a
[53:45] certain disease but god's going to have
[53:46] a purpose in that nonetheless
[53:48] then that what is that it is to draw you
[53:50] closer to him amen your commission is to
[53:52] defeat the enemy
[53:53] but the purpose is that god will be made
[53:55] more real in your life amen
[53:58] what you're called to do is tied to the
[53:59] effect that it has on you god doesn't
[54:01] do things for a whim or for no reason
[54:03] but he'll put something in front of you
[54:05] and it's going to draw you closer to him
[54:06] amen
[54:07] amen you have to be able to put yourself
[54:10] into the word of god because as i said
[54:11] that's our title deed amen that's where
[54:14] we are written in
[54:15] that's where our inheritance is that's
[54:16] where we find our identity
[54:18] is in the title deed amen that's how we
[54:20] know what we own
[54:21] that's how we know that we have the
[54:22] right to go claim something that's how
[54:24] we know we have a right to fight for
[54:26] something
[54:26] amen is when we look in the title deed
[54:28] and my name is written in there
[54:29] that's why i said if you're in the same
[54:31] place as joshua put your
[54:32] receive the same message amen write it
[54:34] in write your name in there where
[54:36] joshua's name is write your name in
[54:37] where abraham's name is write your name
[54:39] in
[54:39] where that woman that touched jesus
[54:40] garment is write your name in there
[54:42] why because that's your title deed as
[54:44] much as it is there's amen
[54:45] god didn't write the bible for the
[54:47] unbeliever he wrote it for the believer
[54:49] and it speaks to her in a way it doesn't
[54:50] anybody else because she sees herself in
[54:52] it
[54:52] and then she identifies her purpose and
[54:54] his plan in her life
[54:56] and so on that basis she's able to
[54:57] accept the word of god as it is
[54:59] revealed to her amen amen you've got to
[55:02] have confidence that god has called you
[55:04] and placed you
[55:05] and when you have that confidence now
[55:06] you can start to put the word on your
[55:08] lips
[55:08] you can take it in your heart you can
[55:10] write it on on a piece of paper and slap
[55:12] it on your
[55:12] your fridge amen and read it every day
[55:14] knowing that he's going to bring the
[55:16] past what he's promised on what you've
[55:17] written amen
[55:18] brother braham says now talk about
[55:20] perseverance he moses walked right up
[55:22] into the face of pharaoh and said let
[55:24] them go
[55:25] why he'd talk face to face with god
[55:27] until he had his commission
[55:29] until he had his commission i think if
[55:31] minister brethren today would just not
[55:33] take it from an intellectual standpoint
[55:35] but would find them a place on the
[55:37] backside of the desert on those sacred
[55:38] sands where satan
[55:40] cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief
[55:42] and stay there until a message comes
[55:44] from god
[55:45] and positionally places you in the
[55:46] ministry then all the devils of torment
[55:49] could not shake you from it
[55:50] you know you're called now he's talking
[55:52] about ministers here and you can't fake
[55:54] it amen
[55:55] you can't fake it as a minister you've
[55:56] got to have what you say you have
[55:58] but that doesn't mean that every
[55:59] believer gets off if they're not a
[56:00] minister amen you've got to have what
[56:02] you say you have
[56:03] you've got to know in whom you have
[56:04] believed amen and our faith
[56:06] are in our trusting that he is faithful
[56:08] to finish that which he started in you
[56:10] he says brother branham says that he
[56:12] says i think each christian ought to do
[56:14] that
[56:14] before you come out and confess the holy
[56:16] ghost confess you have the baptism there
[56:18] ought to be such a personal contact with
[56:20] god
[56:21] until all the intellectuals in the world
[56:22] couldn't explain it from you
[56:24] you know you've been there you've had
[56:27] the witness you know it's so
[56:28] amen i can say i know it's so but can
[56:30] you say you know it so
[56:32] young men young sisters young brothers
[56:34] amen can you say i know that i have been
[56:36] in his presence and he has confirmed to
[56:38] me that he has filled me with his spirit
[56:40] that's what he says don't go out and
[56:42] pretend it make sure you've been there
[56:44] you've got to get a personal contact
[56:45] with god
[56:46] that says that i have the holy ghost
[56:48] you've been there you've had the witness
[56:50] you know it's so he says that's a
[56:52] requirement jesus told the disciples
[56:54] you wait you know the intellectual part
[56:56] we know the intellectual part we've had
[56:58] the message for 60 years almost
[57:00] right it's been done for almost 60 years
[57:03] we've had the intellectual part he says
[57:05] you know the word but you wait up there
[57:07] at the city of jerusalem until you're
[57:08] endued with power from on high
[57:10] he says then they knew oh my amen
[57:13] amen that's where we have to place
[57:15] ourselves then they knew
[57:17] you've got to know that you've got what
[57:18] you think you've got
[57:20] amen and then god will confirm it amen
[57:24] amen let's go back to the promise of
[57:26] joshua fear not
[57:28] right they're given into your hand and
[57:31] then he said there shall not
[57:33] a man of them stand before thee so not
[57:35] just given into your hand not just
[57:36] delivered into your hand but he says not
[57:38] a single one of them
[57:39] is going to stand before you when this
[57:40] is all done now to stand before somebody
[57:43] means to be able to repel them to keep
[57:44] them off
[57:45] amen if you can stand up to somebody if
[57:47] a man comes up to me and he stands up to
[57:49] me
[57:49] it means that he gets in my face and i
[57:50] can't get him away right he says no
[57:52] one's going to be able to come
[57:54] up and hold you back joshua nobody's
[57:56] going to be able to keep you from
[57:56] pressing the battle
[57:57] no one's going to keep you from killing
[57:59] them he says
[58:01] what not a single one of them will be
[58:03] able to stand before you the last time
[58:04] they saw this was at the red sea
[58:06] when god said look on them because
[58:08] you'll never see them again after today
[58:10] and then he takes them back and says the
[58:11] same thing that happened there under the
[58:13] waters
[58:13] is going to happen under your sword
[58:15] today amen not a single one of them will
[58:17] be left there won't be a doubt
[58:18] there won't be a fear there won't be a
[58:19] shred of evidence that they were ever
[58:21] here except a bunch of dead bodies
[58:23] laying on the ground to prove that you
[58:24] and god are working together to defeat
[58:26] them amen amen
[58:28] they will be so completely destroyed
[58:29] that they will never again have an
[58:31] influence on you
[58:33] i mean that's a that's the kind of
[58:34] victory we want is it where there is no
[58:36] more influence after they have been
[58:37] killed amen there's not even a memory
[58:39] that holds us back but we move ahead in
[58:41] what the justified nature of a true
[58:43] believer of christ that says
[58:44] under the blood there is no sin that can
[58:46] be remembered amen
[58:47] there's nothing that can hold us back
[58:50] but the braham says in adoption number
[58:51] four he says
[58:52] after i referenced this last week but i
[58:54] want to put it in here
[58:55] he says after the church takes its
[58:57] position we're called to the adoptions
[58:58] of son
[58:59] by the holy spirit and each man takes
[59:01] his position
[59:02] what god called him to do and stand at
[59:05] the end of the road going after the lost
[59:07] amen our goal is to what preach the
[59:09] gospel into every nation
[59:11] now sometimes our nation is just our
[59:12] neighborhood right
[59:14] we're not all called to go out but we're
[59:16] all called to preach the gospel
[59:18] amen with our life with our testimony
[59:20] with our words with our dresses with our
[59:22] hair
[59:22] with our clothing with our habits amen
[59:25] with the way we go to church twice a
[59:27] week
[59:28] come what hell or high water right we go
[59:30] to church
[59:31] especially in newfoundland right
[59:35] what is it they see a living testimony
[59:37] there and then preach the gospel in
[59:38] demons and brother braham says
[59:39] you stand at the end of the road going
[59:41] after the lost you're looking for the
[59:43] last one because when the last one comes
[59:44] in we get to go out
[59:46] amen so sometimes the last one is a
[59:47] member of our family sometimes it might
[59:49] be a neighbor sometimes it might be
[59:51] somebody at our school
[59:52] at our work we don't know amen so we're
[59:54] preaching the gospel every day we're
[59:55] around
[59:57] but this is what i've referenced last
[59:58] time but he said first paul takes all
[1:00:00] the scare out of it
[1:00:01] amen there's supposed to be no fear in a
[1:00:03] believer's life
[1:00:04] amen he says so now if you're called if
[1:00:07] you're not just worked up in your mind
[1:00:09] by some kind of theology
[1:00:10] if you're really born of the spirit then
[1:00:12] god predestinated you before the
[1:00:14] foundation of the world
[1:00:15] put your name on the lamb's book of life
[1:00:17] and now we come together to sit in
[1:00:19] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:00:21] a holy people a holy nation of peculiar
[1:00:25] people
[1:00:25] we've got to be able to be peculiar and
[1:00:27] be comfortable with being peculiar amen
[1:00:29] we've got to be able to have people look
[1:00:31] at us and say you're weird and say
[1:00:32] absolutely i am so glad that i am weird
[1:00:36] compared to you amen without insulting
[1:00:39] them of course
[1:00:41] a royal priesthood offering spiritual
[1:00:43] sacrifices unto god that is the fruit
[1:00:46] of our lips giving praise to his name so
[1:00:48] joshua has fear not i've delivered them
[1:00:50] all into your hands and no man shall
[1:00:52] stand before thee
[1:00:53] and then joshua has no concerns now god
[1:00:55] has told him the order of battle he's
[1:00:56] told him he's going to win
[1:00:57] no one's going to stand before them
[1:00:59] they're all going to be dead
[1:01:00] no concerns can you imagine having a
[1:01:02] conversation with god that said today
[1:01:04] everyone that comes against you is going
[1:01:06] to fall down amen every sickness that
[1:01:08] comes against you every demon every
[1:01:09] oppression
[1:01:10] every issue that's going to come up
[1:01:12] you're going to respond perfectly
[1:01:13] according to the word
[1:01:14] and it will leave
[1:01:17] it's there it's there
[1:01:20] show me in the scripture where ali
[1:01:22] offered us was that anything but victory
[1:01:25] right he hasn't ever offered us failure
[1:01:26] he's offered us victory every single
[1:01:28] time
[1:01:28] so no matter what you face every day
[1:01:30] write your name in like joshua's there
[1:01:31] and say there is nothing that's going to
[1:01:33] stand before me today
[1:01:34] by the grace of god according to the
[1:01:36] word of god but you've got to be where
[1:01:38] joshua is and there's no sin in the camp
[1:01:39] and you've talked to god lately
[1:01:41] amen and you know what he wants you to
[1:01:42] do amen he has his marching
[1:01:45] orders and on those orders he gets a
[1:01:46] guaranteed victory from god
[1:01:49] abraham says now if we can find our
[1:01:50] position and know that it's god's word
[1:01:52] that has promised it
[1:01:54] that's the reason joshua and caleb had
[1:01:56] no fear that they could not take the
[1:01:57] promised land
[1:01:58] because all the rest of the other nine
[1:02:00] came back of the ten and said we can't
[1:02:01] do it
[1:02:02] why those cities walled high and we look
[1:02:04] like grasshoppers upside the people
[1:02:06] they're so big and they're armed and
[1:02:07] said we just can't do it
[1:02:09] see they were looking at the sense of
[1:02:11] reasoning
[1:02:12] you can't look at the sense of reasoning
[1:02:14] you've got to look at the promise of god
[1:02:16] now god has already sent his angel and
[1:02:18] the angel was in the camp moving on
[1:02:20] amen what is it the pillar of fire above
[1:02:22] them had come down as a captain of the
[1:02:24] host an angelic being it was christ
[1:02:26] himself
[1:02:26] and joshua recognized who that was and
[1:02:28] that angel was moving
[1:02:29] that angel was giving orders amen and
[1:02:32] the revelation of god
[1:02:34] had brought the word of god manifested
[1:02:37] hold that for next service
[1:02:38] the revelation of god had brought the
[1:02:40] word of god manifested
[1:02:41] and now they were ready to push into the
[1:02:44] promised land
[1:02:45] what was the revelation the revelation
[1:02:47] was it's time to take the land
[1:02:49] and what was the manifestation taking
[1:02:51] the land amen it wasn't god now it was
[1:02:53] people
[1:02:54] with god behind them amen that's what
[1:02:56] we're supposed to do take the revelation
[1:02:58] you're the bride you're without spot
[1:03:00] you're without wrinkle you're supposed
[1:03:01] to go on a rapture
[1:03:02] and what do we do now we go on a rapture
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] he says therefore joshua and caleb knew
[1:03:09] all promises were to them
[1:03:10] for god had promised he was going to
[1:03:12] give them a land
[1:03:13] what has god promised you amen let's
[1:03:17] again not leave it to joshua and caleb
[1:03:18] what has god promised you
[1:03:20] amen if you're putting your name in
[1:03:22] there you know he's given it to you
[1:03:24] so you should have the same confidence
[1:03:25] as joshua and caleb did amen
[1:03:28] and then they waited all this time so
[1:03:30] they knew he was going to give them the
[1:03:31] land
[1:03:31] and then they had to wait what 40 years
[1:03:33] for everybody that was faithless to die
[1:03:35] out
[1:03:36] then now it's the time he says and they
[1:03:38] waited all this time and then after a
[1:03:39] while the holy ghost came down to moses
[1:03:41] a pillar of fire formed over them and
[1:03:43] they followed it and here it was
[1:03:45] right up at the promised land now ready
[1:03:47] to push over
[1:03:48] so he could believe it because god's
[1:03:50] promises are unfailing
[1:03:52] they are the truth amen joshua has a
[1:03:55] clear mandate he has a clear commission
[1:03:57] he knows where to go
[1:03:58] he knows who he's supposed to beat up on
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:01] nothing is left unshown to joshua joshua
[1:04:03] has a very clear direction here there's
[1:04:05] no doubt in his mind
[1:04:06] who he's fighting right there's no doubt
[1:04:09] is who's the enemy and who's the friend
[1:04:11] amen but joshua's task remember his
[1:04:14] leadership was in finding what the
[1:04:15] leadership of god
[1:04:16] that's what he had to do the the trial
[1:04:18] for joshua was not to move forward it
[1:04:20] was to find the leadership and then move
[1:04:22] forward
[1:04:22] because otherwise you move forward under
[1:04:24] what presumption and that's what gets
[1:04:26] people killed every single time
[1:04:27] joshua's leadership we read it in the
[1:04:29] quotes where brother brown said that it
[1:04:30] was on his knees
[1:04:32] before that angel before that captain of
[1:04:34] the host was where he found his position
[1:04:36] and that was his position then after
[1:04:38] that he could start to lead them amen
[1:04:40] amen your position as a father is not to
[1:04:42] lead
[1:04:43] the family your position as a father is
[1:04:45] to do what
[1:04:46] find the will of god and take that to
[1:04:48] your family and lead them by it amen
[1:04:50] your position amen brother gerald's
[1:04:52] position as pastor is not to lead the
[1:04:53] church
[1:04:54] his position is to what find the
[1:04:56] leadership of the holy spirit and bring
[1:04:58] that to the church
[1:04:59] to lead them by that amen amen the song
[1:05:02] leader when he comes up is to be what
[1:05:04] led by the holy spirit not sing there's
[1:05:06] the songs that he likes amen but rather
[1:05:08] under inspiration to bring what the holy
[1:05:10] spirit has for the church for that
[1:05:12] service amen
[1:05:13] and be able to both create a song list
[1:05:15] under inspiration
[1:05:16] and move away from it from inspiration
[1:05:18] isn't that right brother bob
[1:05:20] what is my what is my requirement as a
[1:05:22] minister
[1:05:23] my requirement is to study and pray
[1:05:26] that's what the apostles did that's why
[1:05:27] they brought deacons in the first place
[1:05:28] was to give them time to study and pray
[1:05:30] as a minister what i'm supposed to do is
[1:05:32] study and pray and make myself available
[1:05:34] to god
[1:05:35] amen and then it's up to him to lead me
[1:05:37] to inspire me
[1:05:38] to give me what he have to i'm talking
[1:05:39] about me now because i know me i'm not
[1:05:41] trying to make me into something big
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] i'm talking about what i know right my
[1:05:45] position is to do what my responsibility
[1:05:47] is make myself available for him to use
[1:05:50] right find the will of god and then in
[1:05:52] faith come and bring that to the people
[1:05:54] my responsibility is not to discern the
[1:05:56] needs of the people
[1:05:58] the word does that the word is a
[1:06:00] discerner the thoughts and intents of
[1:06:01] the heart
[1:06:01] now if it's channeled through me then
[1:06:03] everyone might say that's john that's
[1:06:04] not john i don't have a clue
[1:06:06] i don't have a clue amen i can say that
[1:06:08] the majority of time i don't have a clue
[1:06:10] if something's going on
[1:06:11] in terms of something like that but it
[1:06:12] happens amen and you know god's moving
[1:06:15] because i don't have a clue about it
[1:06:17] why because it's the word that's going
[1:06:18] forth now and all i've done is i've done
[1:06:20] my part and that is
[1:06:21] set myself aside study and pray and he
[1:06:24] said i'll take care of the rest
[1:06:25] right i've got to keep the sin out of my
[1:06:27] life amen i got to keep myself quiet
[1:06:29] before god
[1:06:30] and then i've got to keep my life
[1:06:31] sanctified but if all that's done then
[1:06:34] it's still got to be a work of him
[1:06:35] i can do all of that and get up here and
[1:06:36] it's a pointless exercise amen it's got
[1:06:38] to be him now using me
[1:06:40] and i've got to step here in confidence
[1:06:42] that he is using me amen that it is his
[1:06:44] will
[1:06:45] for me to be here doing and saying what
[1:06:47] i'm saying here tonight
[1:06:48] and not just tonight but every service
[1:06:49] that i preach amen
[1:06:51] amen my requirement is to be led and be
[1:06:53] obedient to that
[1:06:54] leading that's all i can do amen our
[1:06:57] position is not to go find a battle
[1:07:00] sometimes you'll see people and all
[1:07:01] they're doing is they're looking for a
[1:07:02] fight every day
[1:07:04] guess what that's not what we're called
[1:07:05] to do we're not called to fight a battle
[1:07:07] men are not we're not called to go find
[1:07:09] a trial or to go find trouble amen
[1:07:11] our position is to find the will of god
[1:07:13] and walk confidently in it
[1:07:14] and then whatever comes our way we can
[1:07:16] be confident that he has
[1:07:17] our back amen that we can speak the word
[1:07:19] that we can move forward in faith
[1:07:21] that we can trust that no matter how bad
[1:07:23] it looks it doesn't matter
[1:07:24] because i have found the will of god for
[1:07:26] my life i'm walking in the will of god
[1:07:28] for my life and therefore he is with me
[1:07:30] and he's working this out for my good no
[1:07:31] matter how bad it might be
[1:07:33] amen and then no matter how good it is
[1:07:35] sometimes we look at something good and
[1:07:36] we say
[1:07:36] oh that means something bad's coming no
[1:07:39] it doesn't
[1:07:40] sometimes we rob ourselves a blessing
[1:07:42] because we think if something's good
[1:07:43] then we must be doing something bad
[1:07:45] no sometimes we're on the mountain
[1:07:46] sometimes we're down in the valley amen
[1:07:48] sometimes god's blessing us in ways that
[1:07:50] really help us in our flesh
[1:07:51] you know sometimes there's lots of money
[1:07:53] in the bank sometimes the cars aren't
[1:07:54] breaking down
[1:07:55] sometimes the house doesn't need repair
[1:07:56] sometimes everybody's healthy and
[1:07:57] everybody's safe
[1:07:59] and sometimes they're not right god
[1:08:01] gives us valley experiences and he gives
[1:08:03] us mountaintop experiences amen
[1:08:06] amen we have to be sure that we found
[1:08:09] his will and we're walking in it and
[1:08:10] then everything else just falls right
[1:08:11] into place behind it
[1:08:13] look at joshua now so joshua has his
[1:08:15] commission so joshua therefore
[1:08:17] came on to them suddenly and went up
[1:08:19] from gilgal all night
[1:08:20] so joshua makes a forced march at night
[1:08:22] to catch him by surprise
[1:08:23] it says and the lord discomforted them
[1:08:25] before israel and slew them with the
[1:08:26] great slaughter at gibeon
[1:08:28] and chased them all along the way that
[1:08:30] goeth up to beth horon
[1:08:32] and smote them at asaka and unto macada
[1:08:35] and it came to pass as they fled from
[1:08:36] before israel and were in the going down
[1:08:38] to beth horon
[1:08:39] that the lord cast down great stones
[1:08:41] from heaven upon them
[1:08:42] unto asaka and they died and there were
[1:08:45] more which died with hailstones than
[1:08:46] they whom the children of israel slew
[1:08:48] with the sword
[1:08:49] have you ever been in a situation and
[1:08:51] you're fighting and you're fighting and
[1:08:52] you're fighting
[1:08:54] and you know you're not getting anywhere
[1:08:55] and then all of a sudden there's a
[1:08:56] breakthrough
[1:08:58] what is it it's god saying hey i'm with
[1:09:00] you
[1:09:01] amen it's god letting you know hey i'm
[1:09:03] by your side i've called you for this
[1:09:05] i see you struggling here i see you
[1:09:07] doing your best but this is a
[1:09:08] supernatural battle and you need
[1:09:09] supernatural help
[1:09:10] so guess what the supernatural is here
[1:09:12] to help you amen you walk into a
[1:09:14] situation you know it's going to take
[1:09:15] more patience it's going to take more
[1:09:17] grace than you think you have
[1:09:18] and all of a sudden you've got exactly
[1:09:20] what you need for that situation amen
[1:09:22] where you can respond to a person in a
[1:09:23] way that you didn't think you ever could
[1:09:25] why because god is there to help you
[1:09:26] through that battle that trial
[1:09:28] because you're seeking him amen because
[1:09:29] you're looking for his purpose in the
[1:09:31] situation amen
[1:09:32] you've seen it with finances i'm sure as
[1:09:35] a poor student many times blank and i
[1:09:36] would literally get down to 10 cents in
[1:09:38] the bank account
[1:09:39] with an overdraft about to come in the
[1:09:40] next day and you pray and guess what
[1:09:42] brother bob hands you a
[1:09:43] a letter because they were still getting
[1:09:45] our mail at the time it's a 110 dollar
[1:09:47] check
[1:09:47] a reef a rebate that we didn't know
[1:09:49] about you know god is always looking out
[1:09:51] for us and then we do everything we can
[1:09:53] and then what happens is he comes right
[1:09:54] over top of it and just does so much
[1:09:56] more than we could ever ask or think
[1:09:57] just to show i'm god amen and i'm not
[1:10:00] just god but i'm your god
[1:10:02] amen and you're my child amen and that's
[1:10:04] why you're seeing something that nobody
[1:10:06] else gets to see
[1:10:07] that's why the world doesn't have this
[1:10:08] sort of thing is because they're not my
[1:10:09] children but you are
[1:10:10] you're walking in my will and i'm going
[1:10:12] to magnify the effect of whatever you do
[1:10:14] amen amen god's grace to us
[1:10:18] amen look at these hailstones coming
[1:10:20] down and
[1:10:21] it says that there were more killed by
[1:10:23] the hailstones than were killed by
[1:10:24] joshuas and the israelite swords
[1:10:27] amen but i want you to notice there are
[1:10:28] no friendly fire incidents with these
[1:10:30] hail storms what's friendly fire
[1:10:32] that's when you get knocked down by your
[1:10:33] own soldiers isn't it amen
[1:10:35] god has a way of sending this one down
[1:10:37] that it doesn't kill any of the
[1:10:38] israelites running around killing the
[1:10:40] amorites
[1:10:41] but it only kills amorites i mean i want
[1:10:43] to say if you're fighting for the lord
[1:10:45] you're not killing your brothers and
[1:10:46] sisters amen
[1:10:47] you're not stabbing them in the back
[1:10:48] you're not talking badly about them but
[1:10:50] rather you're supporting them in the
[1:10:51] fight aren't you
[1:10:52] amen you're not killing another brother
[1:10:54] and sister doing the work of god
[1:10:56] amen that's up to god to deal with them
[1:10:58] it's not up to us to deal with them amen
[1:11:00] you know what's the hardest part about
[1:11:01] being a part of a group of believers
[1:11:03] it's not pointing out the faults because
[1:11:04] satan can do that really well
[1:11:06] and then you're only as good as satan if
[1:11:08] you can point out the faults but it's
[1:11:09] being able to restore somebody in a
[1:11:10] spirit of humility and meekness
[1:11:12] because what that is is that requires
[1:11:14] the christ in you not in them
[1:11:16] amen and we we duck away from that so
[1:11:18] often it's so easy to put that other
[1:11:19] person down
[1:11:20] rather than push ourselves down and
[1:11:22] humble ourselves with them so that we
[1:11:24] can raise them up in a spirit of
[1:11:25] meekness and restore them to where they
[1:11:26] were before they ever fell amen
[1:11:28] that's why we we shy away from it so
[1:11:30] often is because it requires more of us
[1:11:31] than it does of them
[1:11:33] amen because when you're gracious to
[1:11:34] somebody it doesn't take much for them
[1:11:36] to respond to it
[1:11:37] amen but you've got to come into that
[1:11:38] gracious atmosphere man you've got to
[1:11:39] come to that place
[1:11:40] where you've been refreshed remember
[1:11:42] that daily refreshing we talked about
[1:11:44] where you've got something to offer to
[1:11:45] that person now
[1:11:46] and then so instead of looking down on
[1:11:48] them you're down there and you're
[1:11:48] helping to lift them all up again amen
[1:11:51] it says that he the lord discomforted
[1:11:53] them before israel that means he
[1:11:54] disturbed he distracted them they didn't
[1:11:56] know what was going on
[1:11:57] they got people stabbing them throwing
[1:11:59] spears shooting arrows and now
[1:12:00] hailstones are coming down from heaven
[1:12:01] and killing them
[1:12:02] they have no idea what's going on and
[1:12:03] they're just there's chaos everywhere
[1:12:05] and so they can't form any sort of a
[1:12:07] battle plan they can't fight the
[1:12:08] israelites
[1:12:09] right god's fighting for them but look
[1:12:10] at this even after all of this it still
[1:12:13] isn't enough
[1:12:14] when we're looking at this battle it's
[1:12:15] five kingdoms against one and it's still
[1:12:18] not enough because joshua has to do more
[1:12:20] amen the sun starts to go down and
[1:12:21] joshua says it's not enough
[1:12:23] god you've helped us but we need more
[1:12:25] that's an incredible thing to say god
[1:12:27] you helped us but we need more
[1:12:29] but that's what joshua says here listen
[1:12:30] to this and then spake joshua to the
[1:12:33] lord in the day when the lord delivered
[1:12:35] up the amorites before the children of
[1:12:36] israel
[1:12:37] and he said in the sight of israel so
[1:12:39] this is in public this is not in his
[1:12:40] prayer closet
[1:12:41] he didn't just throw up a quick field
[1:12:44] tent there and go inside and say i've
[1:12:45] got to talk to the lord he stood in the
[1:12:47] site of israel
[1:12:48] and he said this he said son
[1:12:51] stand thou still upon gibeon and thou
[1:12:54] moon in the valley of agilent
[1:12:56] he spoke to the heavens in the sight of
[1:12:58] israel in faith
[1:13:00] that is incredible that is incredible
[1:13:03] in full sight of everybody amen if they
[1:13:05] don't listen he's going to look like a
[1:13:06] fool
[1:13:07] but he stands there and he speaks it and
[1:13:10] the sun stood still and the moon stayed
[1:13:14] until the people had avenged themselves
[1:13:17] upon their enemies
[1:13:18] is not this written in the book of
[1:13:19] jasher so the sun stood still in the
[1:13:21] midst of heaven and hastened not to go
[1:13:23] down
[1:13:24] about a whole day
[1:13:28] and there was no day like that before it
[1:13:31] or
[1:13:32] after it that the lord hearkened unto
[1:13:34] the voice of a man
[1:13:35] for the lord fought for israel
[1:13:38] the lord fought for israel but joshua
[1:13:40] had to speak yes
[1:13:42] god was there amen god had helped him
[1:13:46] but he needed a bit more and god said no
[1:13:48] problem
[1:13:50] and joshua returned in all israel with
[1:13:52] him unto
[1:13:53] the camp of gilgal it says there was
[1:13:55] never a day before and there's never
[1:13:56] been a day since that god obeyed the
[1:13:58] voice of man like that
[1:13:59] amen never going to happen again so
[1:14:01] don't try
[1:14:03] amen why did god do it
[1:14:06] why did god do it why did god leave
[1:14:08] something undone so joshua had to speak
[1:14:11] and then why did he listen to him in
[1:14:13] such a great way god's infinite he knows
[1:14:15] things
[1:14:16] but i can imagine if you put a team of
[1:14:17] engineers and said how are we going to
[1:14:18] keep the solar system in place and not
[1:14:20] fall apart if we stop everything for a
[1:14:22] minute
[1:14:23] for a day it'd take us the rest of our
[1:14:26] lifetimes to figure out the calculations
[1:14:27] to see how this could happen
[1:14:29] but god by the spoken word could stop it
[1:14:31] in an instant
[1:14:32] and hold it in place without nature
[1:14:34] going into chaos because his children
[1:14:36] had need of it amen
[1:14:37] listen to what the prophet said he says
[1:14:39] joshua wanting time
[1:14:41] he stopped the sun with his own word and
[1:14:43] it didn't shine
[1:14:44] and the sun didn't go down for 24 hours
[1:14:46] the bible said there never was a man
[1:14:48] before that or after
[1:14:49] that had ever commanded the sun to stand
[1:14:51] still that god listened to the voice of
[1:14:52] a man
[1:14:53] why he says see he had the enemy all
[1:14:56] routed that means they were running
[1:14:58] but was his commission to route them
[1:15:01] no see they were just they were routed
[1:15:03] all out
[1:15:04] everywhere he says he had
[1:15:07] to hunt them down and kill them he takes
[1:15:09] them back to his commission what is it
[1:15:11] no man shall stand before you i've
[1:15:12] delivered all of them into your hands
[1:15:14] so he says he had not he wanted to
[1:15:17] he had that was his commission to hunt
[1:15:20] them down and kill him
[1:15:21] that's all there was to it because that
[1:15:24] was his commission amen joshua spoke
[1:15:27] because he had a commission to speak
[1:15:29] and god answered because he had given
[1:15:32] joshua the commission
[1:15:34] and he knowed if it ever come night time
[1:15:36] they'd have a time to mobilize
[1:15:38] again and get together and he'd lose
[1:15:39] more men so he said i need time i need
[1:15:42] light
[1:15:42] sun stand still amen oh god god listened
[1:15:45] to a man's word and stopped the sun
[1:15:48] it stayed in its place same place for 24
[1:15:50] hours till he fought weeded out every
[1:15:52] one of the enemy and brought them down
[1:15:54] they couldn't they didn't give them a
[1:15:57] time to get mobilized again
[1:15:58] he kept moving on so why did god do it
[1:16:02] he did it because he had commissioned
[1:16:04] joshua and joshua said look
[1:16:06] god this is what i need to get the job
[1:16:08] done you told me what to do
[1:16:10] you've helped us but we need more so i
[1:16:12] need the sun to stand still and the moon
[1:16:13] to stop still i need another day's light
[1:16:15] to finish the job that you gave me
[1:16:16] let's finish it here today you told me
[1:16:19] they wouldn't stand
[1:16:20] they're running but we got to kill them
[1:16:21] all because you told me that as well
[1:16:23] so he said i need the sun and the moon
[1:16:24] to stand still and he spoke and god
[1:16:26] obeyed
[1:16:26] amen amen
[1:16:30] brother branham says greater was he that
[1:16:31] was in joshua than the son
[1:16:35] amen greater than he is he that is in
[1:16:37] you than he that's in the sun
[1:16:40] amen amen amen and joshua
[1:16:44] was a man sin born like you and i yes
[1:16:48] so no excuses here right our faults our
[1:16:51] failures
[1:16:52] our shortcomings has nothing to do with
[1:16:55] it
[1:16:55] same thing joshua was amen and greater
[1:16:58] was he that was in joshua and in the sun
[1:17:00] that was running by the commandment of
[1:17:01] god
[1:17:02] god commanded that sun to shine and turn
[1:17:04] itself around and it's covered in
[1:17:06] control by the laws of god but greater
[1:17:07] was he that was in joshua than the laws
[1:17:09] of god were
[1:17:10] because the creator himself was in
[1:17:12] joshua when joshua looked up to the son
[1:17:14] and said
[1:17:15] you stand there where you're at and moon
[1:17:18] you hang there where you're at
[1:17:19] till i finish this battle and then it
[1:17:22] was he said it was god speaking through
[1:17:23] joshua it wasn't just a man now
[1:17:25] it was god speaking and then we see that
[1:17:27] quote when you speak the word for your
[1:17:29] day what is it it's deity speaking
[1:17:31] that's what he's saying here joshua was
[1:17:33] deity in this moment that was god
[1:17:34] speaking through a man
[1:17:36] he says and the moon and the son of adam
[1:17:38] for he that was in joshua was greater
[1:17:40] than the sun and the moon he that was in
[1:17:43] joshua amen we spoke last service about
[1:17:45] grieving the holy spirit
[1:17:47] we spoke what happens when we let anger
[1:17:49] and bitterness and offenses and past
[1:17:51] problems and issues dominate our lives
[1:17:53] and then it pushes the holy spirit away
[1:17:56] you can't do this sort of thing when
[1:17:57] that's around
[1:17:58] you and then you can't do that when
[1:17:59] you've got those things circling around
[1:18:01] when you've got issues and unresolved
[1:18:02] problems
[1:18:03] and then when you've got bitterness and
[1:18:05] anger amen
[1:18:07] none of these things are going to allow
[1:18:09] you to speak the word amen that's for
[1:18:10] sure
[1:18:11] and then joshua knew that his life was
[1:18:13] clean he knew that there was nothing to
[1:18:14] hold him back
[1:18:15] there was no barrier between him and god
[1:18:17] and he was able to speak those words
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] amen it's not that you've lost your
[1:18:21] place amen you're still a believer
[1:18:23] you're still a child of god but when you
[1:18:24] grieve the holy spirit it makes it
[1:18:26] ineffective
[1:18:27] and then god just can't come near to you
[1:18:29] and then his presence can't be loosed in
[1:18:31] the way that
[1:18:31] that we need him to amen amen remember
[1:18:35] as we talked about
[1:18:36] when we've renewed ourselves daily in
[1:18:37] that loving grace amen when forgiveness
[1:18:39] is coming out of our lips
[1:18:41] amen with mercy when we're humble amen
[1:18:44] when we're seeking the will of god
[1:18:45] that's when these sorts of things happen
[1:18:47] is when we're
[1:18:47] laying ourselves before god and saying
[1:18:49] god what do you want me to do
[1:18:51] amen lord what's your plan for me what's
[1:18:53] your purpose for me
[1:18:54] where do you want me to be what do you
[1:18:56] want me to do with my life with my gifts
[1:18:59] amen there's no barriers with joshua
[1:19:02] joshua the lord had told him you're good
[1:19:03] to go bud and he went
[1:19:06] and he went and he went until he
[1:19:07] finished the job in it
[1:19:10] pray for my voice amen
[1:19:13] braham says this as long as you are in
[1:19:15] the line of duty
[1:19:18] and what's the line of duty he says
[1:19:20] keeping god's
[1:19:21] word amen doing just what he told you to
[1:19:24] do
[1:19:25] marching by the orders of god you've got
[1:19:27] a right to say to that mountain
[1:19:29] be moved read again keeping god's word
[1:19:33] doing just what he told you to do
[1:19:35] marching by the orders of god you've got
[1:19:36] a right to say to that mountain be mood
[1:19:39] god keeps his word so if you're keeping
[1:19:41] his word then he's going to keep his as
[1:19:43] well
[1:19:43] amen that's the way it works when you're
[1:19:45] in his word then he can keep it really
[1:19:47] easily can't he
[1:19:48] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:19:50] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:19:51] that what you've said will come to pass
[1:19:53] you can have that what you have said
[1:19:55] jesus said that in saint mark 11 22
[1:19:58] that's the truth
[1:19:59] i know that's the truth it's god's word
[1:20:01] and that proves that it's the truth
[1:20:02] we're just afraid sometimes we get to a
[1:20:06] place we're afraid he won't keep that
[1:20:08] word
[1:20:09] he will keep that word he said he would
[1:20:13] do it
[1:20:14] he says now we find that's true he
[1:20:16] proved it i believe that's why moses had
[1:20:18] them write a book of remembrance
[1:20:20] we do well sometimes to write down the
[1:20:22] things that god has done in our lives
[1:20:23] so that when the the discouragement
[1:20:25] comes up and when we start wondering and
[1:20:27] questioning things
[1:20:27] we can look back and say look what the
[1:20:29] lord has done amen and not to somebody
[1:20:31] else only but to me
[1:20:32] and to my family and then to those i
[1:20:34] love and those that i'm close to
[1:20:36] not just in some power church or power
[1:20:38] ministry but right here in our midst
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:41] amen so the challenge to do is
[1:20:45] therefore for us is to do what
[1:20:49] find ourselves in the line of duty ask
[1:20:52] yourself am i in the line of duty
[1:20:55] the challenge to find our position to
[1:20:57] know completely and assuredly that we
[1:20:58] are in the will of god
[1:21:00] and when you've got that then anything
[1:21:02] is possible
[1:21:04] right anything is possible but you've
[1:21:07] got to find your place
[1:21:08] amen we'll jump back to ephesians to see
[1:21:11] what paul talks about before we close
[1:21:13] this out amen
[1:21:14] ephesians chapter 3. if you want to turn
[1:21:16] i've got it here
[1:21:23] ephesians 3
[1:21:26] hang with me i'm in ephesians 3 verse 1
[1:21:28] says for this cause i
[1:21:30] paul the prisoner of christ for you
[1:21:31] gentiles
[1:21:33] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[1:21:35] the grace of god which is given to me
[1:21:37] to you word how that by revelation he
[1:21:40] may known unto me the mystery
[1:21:42] as i wrote before in a few words whereby
[1:21:44] when ye read
[1:21:45] when you read ye may understand my
[1:21:48] knowledge in the mystery of christ
[1:21:49] man we covered this before and our
[1:21:50] portion of the mystery of christ is the
[1:21:52] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:21:54] what was joshua doing that day he was a
[1:21:56] manifestation of the son of god wasn't
[1:21:58] it sons of god not the son of god
[1:22:00] i guess it was in a way but sons of god
[1:22:02] he was what acting as a child of god
[1:22:05] in his god-given position amen so our
[1:22:08] part of this is not just to understand
[1:22:10] it but to have a reality of it amen and
[1:22:12] this is what paul's talking about
[1:22:13] ephesians is all about
[1:22:14] the manifestation of the sons of god and
[1:22:15] how it looks and what god's doing to
[1:22:17] bring it about
[1:22:18] verse 5 says which in other ages was not
[1:22:20] made known unto the sons of men
[1:22:21] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[1:22:23] apostles and prophets by the spirit
[1:22:25] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[1:22:27] and of the same body and partakers of
[1:22:29] his promise in christ by the gospel
[1:22:31] whereof i was made a minister according
[1:22:33] to the gift of the grace of god given
[1:22:35] unto me by the effectual working of his
[1:22:37] power we talked about effectual working
[1:22:39] name and it means it's effective
[1:22:42] unto me who am less than the least of
[1:22:44] all saints is this grace given
[1:22:46] that i should preach among the gentiles
[1:22:48] the unsearchable riches of christ
[1:22:52] and to make all men see what is the
[1:22:54] fellowship of the mystery
[1:22:55] which from the beginning of the world
[1:22:56] had been hidden god who created all
[1:22:58] things by jesus christ
[1:23:00] to the intent so there's a purpose that
[1:23:02] now unto the principalities and powers
[1:23:04] in heavenly places might be known by the
[1:23:06] church
[1:23:07] the manifold wisdom of god according to
[1:23:09] the eternal purpose which he purposed
[1:23:12] in christ jesus our lord i mean this is
[1:23:14] not something he came up with on a whim
[1:23:16] just recently you know after the jews
[1:23:18] turned him down he didn't say well now
[1:23:19] i'm going to go to the gentiles no it
[1:23:21] was an eternal purpose
[1:23:22] amen this is something that he
[1:23:24] foreordained a long time ago
[1:23:26] now watch what this eternal purpose
[1:23:28] looks like it says in whom we have
[1:23:30] boldness
[1:23:31] and access with confidence by the faith
[1:23:33] of him
[1:23:34] now it's one thing to have boldness we
[1:23:36] got a lot of bold people in the world
[1:23:38] a lot of people asking for things
[1:23:39] expecting things amen that's bold
[1:23:42] but he says you don't just get boldness
[1:23:43] with this now you get access
[1:23:45] i mean you get to come before the one
[1:23:47] that can give you what you're asking
[1:23:49] amen like esther right if anybody else
[1:23:52] if anybody came in the king could say
[1:23:55] off with her head or he could extend the
[1:23:56] scepter but when esther came in she
[1:23:58] always got the scepter why
[1:24:00] because she was invited amen he wanted
[1:24:02] her to be around him
[1:24:03] and then she was his wife and so anytime
[1:24:06] she came in he extended that scepter
[1:24:08] and it's the same thing for us is that
[1:24:10] we don't just have boldness now because
[1:24:11] boldness will get you killed
[1:24:13] right you step into the king's presence
[1:24:15] back in esther's day and without him
[1:24:17] wanting you there then you died
[1:24:19] amen but paul says no i didn't you have
[1:24:21] boldness in this but i've given you
[1:24:22] access as well christ has given you
[1:24:24] access to him
[1:24:25] to what the unsearchable riches that we
[1:24:27] just spoke about amen
[1:24:29] wherefore i desire that you faint not in
[1:24:31] my tribulations for you which is your
[1:24:33] glory
[1:24:34] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[1:24:36] father of our lord jesus christ of whom
[1:24:38] the whole heaven
[1:24:39] whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:24:40] named that he would grant you
[1:24:43] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:24:46] be strengthened
[1:24:47] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:24:49] man
[1:24:50] amen our strength is supposed to be
[1:24:52] inward before it ever comes outward
[1:24:54] amen when you're strengthened in the
[1:24:55] inner man when you are sealed with the
[1:24:57] holy spirit
[1:24:58] that's what it says to be strengthened
[1:24:59] with might by his spirit
[1:25:01] this is not an outward working this is
[1:25:03] an inward working that has an outward
[1:25:04] effect
[1:25:05] amen that christ may dwell in your
[1:25:08] hearts by faith
[1:25:09] that's where our strength is faith of
[1:25:12] the holy spirit that's dwelling inside
[1:25:13] of us
[1:25:14] and it has this effect what is it that
[1:25:16] ye being rooted
[1:25:18] and grounded in love may be able to
[1:25:19] comprehend
[1:25:21] with all saints what is the breadth and
[1:25:23] length and depth and height
[1:25:25] now comprehend means to understand but
[1:25:27] it does not just just mean to understand
[1:25:29] intellectually but this is a
[1:25:30] comprehension that comes by a reality by
[1:25:32] an experience
[1:25:33] of what he's talking about amen the holy
[1:25:36] spirit is not just an esoteric thing you
[1:25:38] know we talk about and it's this
[1:25:39] intellectual thing but it is power
[1:25:41] and demonstration in your life amen
[1:25:44] there is a strength that comes with this
[1:25:45] it is not just
[1:25:46] a conversation it is not just doctrine
[1:25:48] it is not just i know the message and i
[1:25:50] believe god sent a prophet
[1:25:51] but it is an experience that causes us
[1:25:54] to understand by reality
[1:25:56] what is the breadth and length and depth
[1:25:58] and height
[1:25:59] and to know the love of christ which
[1:26:01] passes knowledge
[1:26:03] that ye might be filled with all the
[1:26:04] fullness of god it surpasses
[1:26:07] knowledge is what he's saying there that
[1:26:09] it goes beyond just knowing it
[1:26:11] by an intellectual conception as brother
[1:26:13] branham says so often
[1:26:14] and now to come into the reality of the
[1:26:16] love of christ through the holy spirit
[1:26:18] in your life
[1:26:19] amen now unto him that is able to do
[1:26:23] exceeding abundantly above
[1:26:27] what a line exceedingly
[1:26:30] abundantly so exceedingly means way more
[1:26:33] than you think
[1:26:34] and abundantly is way more than you need
[1:26:36] and above means higher than anything
[1:26:38] that you can put before him
[1:26:39] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:26:43] ask or think according to the power that
[1:26:46] worketh in us
[1:26:48] unto him be glory in the church by
[1:26:50] christ jesus
[1:26:51] throughout all ages the world without
[1:26:53] end amen
[1:26:55] he says we give glory to the one that is
[1:26:57] able is he able
[1:26:59] amen is there any lack of power is there
[1:27:01] any lack of willing god
[1:27:03] is there any lack of intent is there any
[1:27:04] lack of desire in him to do that which
[1:27:06] is exceedingly
[1:27:07] abundantly above which we could ask or
[1:27:09] think paul says there isn't
[1:27:12] right there's no lack on god's part so
[1:27:14] it's only up to you how high can you
[1:27:16] think
[1:27:16] how magnificent can you make your
[1:27:18] request
[1:27:20] god says i'm still higher and above that
[1:27:22] i'll do it beyond what you can ever ask
[1:27:25] or think amen
[1:27:26] he is both able and willing to do
[1:27:28] exceedingly abundantly above
[1:27:30] all that we can ask or think paul says
[1:27:32] so you can imagine
[1:27:33] something within the confines of the
[1:27:35] word that god can't do
[1:27:37] better than you think he can do it
[1:27:39] that's what he's saying the greatest
[1:27:41] dream or vision or anticipation you
[1:27:44] could ever come up with of something
[1:27:45] that
[1:27:46] god wants to do for you he says god will
[1:27:48] do even higher than that
[1:27:49] you can't even comprehend how far god
[1:27:52] can and will go
[1:27:53] to bless his children within the
[1:27:54] confines of his word amen
[1:27:57] but notice here he doesn't say this is
[1:27:59] something outside of us and that's half
[1:28:01] the problem
[1:28:01] is he doesn't say it is the power that
[1:28:03] worketh
[1:28:05] on you he said it is in the power that
[1:28:08] worketh
[1:28:08] in us there is something within you that
[1:28:11] triggers this there is something within
[1:28:12] you that draws this
[1:28:14] there's something within you that is
[1:28:15] able to do what you're asking amen
[1:28:18] we're supposed to pray to the god that
[1:28:20] is within
[1:28:21] us amen we sometimes think he's out here
[1:28:24] and we've got to pull him in
[1:28:25] he's right here amen if you've got the
[1:28:27] holy spirit he's walking with you every
[1:28:29] single day
[1:28:30] and you don't have to pull him down amen
[1:28:33] you know what brother brahm talks about
[1:28:34] david and he says david didn't have to
[1:28:36] get prayed up david was prayed up
[1:28:38] let me tell you today for the believer
[1:28:40] in the new testament
[1:28:41] you don't have to bring the holy ghost
[1:28:43] down the holy ghost is with you all the
[1:28:45] time amen
[1:28:46] why because you're a child of god and
[1:28:48] god is with you everywhere you go
[1:28:50] now the effect of it like we said you
[1:28:51] can you grieve and push them away
[1:28:53] but if you are walking the way you're
[1:28:54] supposed to be walking you're under that
[1:28:56] shed blood
[1:28:57] then he is with you and in you every
[1:28:59] single day
[1:29:00] no matter where you go or what you do
[1:29:02] amen amen
[1:29:03] there's a force greater inside of us
[1:29:05] that is greater than anything you could
[1:29:07] ever imagine
[1:29:08] amen it is driven by love that's what he
[1:29:11] says here
[1:29:11] the love of christ that is driven by
[1:29:13] love and it is operated by faith
[1:29:15] amen and it is experienced by the true
[1:29:18] believer
[1:29:18] amen you say i have a need brother
[1:29:20] jonathan if you can think it he can meet
[1:29:22] it
[1:29:23] amen if you can imagine it make it as
[1:29:26] big as you want
[1:29:27] he can still meet it make it worse than
[1:29:29] it is and he'll still exceed it
[1:29:31] that's what he's saying here exceedingly
[1:29:33] abundantly above
[1:29:34] what you could ever ask or think the
[1:29:36] only question is are you in the line of
[1:29:38] duty
[1:29:39] that's what he said are you in the line
[1:29:40] of duty if you're in the line of duty
[1:29:41] then speak the word
[1:29:43] it's that simple are you in the line of
[1:29:45] duty are you where you're supposed to be
[1:29:46] are you doing what you're called to do
[1:29:48] amen
[1:29:49] amen i want to ask you this so how can
[1:29:51] you be in the line of duty if you're not
[1:29:53] at your post of duty
[1:29:55] what did brother brown say the post of
[1:29:56] duty was you look up post of duty and
[1:29:59] every
[1:29:59] single time as far as i could tell
[1:30:01] brother brahm says the post of duty is
[1:30:03] to be there when the church doors
[1:30:05] open amen okay i'm obviously preaching
[1:30:08] to the choir
[1:30:10] amen but there's lots of people
[1:30:11] listening to this
[1:30:13] if you are not at a post of duty then
[1:30:16] how can you be in the line of duty
[1:30:18] amen unless you're called to be out
[1:30:19] there preaching you've got to have a
[1:30:21] post of duty you've got a local church a
[1:30:22] local body that you need to be
[1:30:24] supporting amen
[1:30:25] now we're not talking about people that
[1:30:26] are bound by health issues and things
[1:30:28] like that
[1:30:28] remember we're talking about you i have
[1:30:30] a capability to go and support a local
[1:30:32] body
[1:30:32] you need to be doing it and if you can't
[1:30:34] do it where you are go someplace where
[1:30:35] you can
[1:30:36] amen that's hard but it's true amen and
[1:30:39] that's the prophet of god said that go
[1:30:40] look it up in your
[1:30:41] in your search tools and look up post of
[1:30:43] duty and every single time he says your
[1:30:45] post of duty
[1:30:46] is to be there when the church door is
[1:30:47] open you've got to have a local body
[1:30:49] that you're supporting
[1:30:50] not just with your ties and offerings
[1:30:51] but with your presence
[1:30:53] right coming through the doors raising
[1:30:56] your voice raising your hand
[1:30:58] right encouraging others being a part of
[1:31:00] the local body amen
[1:31:02] i read a story i read a story where
[1:31:05] brother branham is talking about
[1:31:07] a guard in the civil war and he was on
[1:31:10] general grant side he was on the
[1:31:11] northern side
[1:31:12] and he was kind of twitter painted and
[1:31:15] he was a century and he was on duty
[1:31:17] and what happened was he was he was
[1:31:19] supposed to be on picket duty
[1:31:21] and he walked away to pick some flowers
[1:31:23] for his sweetheart brother branham said
[1:31:25] and what happened was a spy got through
[1:31:27] the line where he was supposed to be
[1:31:29] realized that grant's army was half the
[1:31:30] size of the rebel army
[1:31:32] and so he got back over and they charged
[1:31:34] and they they destroyed grant's army
[1:31:35] there they pushed him back
[1:31:37] and brother bradham said they shot that
[1:31:39] man within an hour
[1:31:40] why listen to this but the gerald's been
[1:31:43] saying
[1:31:44] this this is in my notes before he ever
[1:31:45] said it and then i think god's trying to
[1:31:47] tell us something
[1:31:48] he says it wasn't he's speaking of the
[1:31:50] century now
[1:31:52] they didn't have a problem with him
[1:31:53] picking flowers it says it wasn't what
[1:31:55] he'd done
[1:31:56] it was the things he didn't do amen he
[1:31:59] didn't stand to his post of duty
[1:32:01] he didn't guard the post like he was
[1:32:03] supposed to and he spoiled
[1:32:05] the whole thing and that responsibility
[1:32:08] lies tonight at the life tabernacle and
[1:32:09] other tabernacles and churches in
[1:32:11] shreveport louisiana
[1:32:12] it ain't what you're doing then it is
[1:32:14] what you're failing to do
[1:32:16] he says let's do something about it
[1:32:18] let's dig with all our hearts
[1:32:20] that when that day of judgment comes we
[1:32:22] can say god i did the very best i could
[1:32:24] and you know i did
[1:32:26] amen when we know what we can do that's
[1:32:28] all
[1:32:29] that's expected nobody begrudged the
[1:32:32] young man
[1:32:33] a chance to get some flowers for his
[1:32:35] sweetheart
[1:32:36] but he caused a defeat by leaving his
[1:32:39] post of duty
[1:32:41] he says it wasn't what he did that was
[1:32:42] the problem is what he didn't do which
[1:32:44] was stay at his post of duty amen
[1:32:47] amen paul's saying if you're at the post
[1:32:49] of duty you're in the line of duty then
[1:32:50] the power that works in you is at your
[1:32:52] disposal
[1:32:53] and god will back it up every single
[1:32:54] time amen let's do it look at a few
[1:32:57] examples as we start to close here this
[1:32:58] evening
[1:33:00] he says and now here was moses that went
[1:33:01] down within his own intellectual affair
[1:33:04] or intellectual achievement to try to
[1:33:05] under a military force bring out israel
[1:33:07] and he failed to do it same way it works
[1:33:10] for all of us
[1:33:11] under your own intellectual conception
[1:33:12] it never works and you'll fail to do it
[1:33:14] and then you'll finally go to god but
[1:33:17] just a word from god on the backside of
[1:33:19] the desert
[1:33:20] boiled the whole thing up again what
[1:33:22] happened to moses
[1:33:23] he got his glasses focused god's only
[1:33:26] purpose wasn't to marry this beautiful
[1:33:28] ethiopian colored girl back there
[1:33:30] and to settle down and have children and
[1:33:31] raise his father-in-law sheep
[1:33:33] but his mission was to deliver the
[1:33:35] children of god out from under that
[1:33:36] bondage
[1:33:37] that's what his his that was his
[1:33:39] commission that's what he was born for
[1:33:42] doesn't mean you can't have a family but
[1:33:45] he says that wasn't his commission
[1:33:47] his commission was as a deliverer and
[1:33:50] each one of us is born for something
[1:33:52] we just wasn't put here for nothing that
[1:33:54] mountain
[1:33:55] never happened out there just to be that
[1:33:58] tree was put there for a purpose he says
[1:34:00] you always talk about the fig tree that
[1:34:02] he spoke to and he says the mountain
[1:34:03] that you got to speak to he says that
[1:34:04] mountain wasn't put there
[1:34:05] just to be a mountain he says
[1:34:08] everything is for a purpose it's got to
[1:34:11] serve and we are here for a purpose
[1:34:13] maybe it's to testify to one person
[1:34:15] and get them saved and out of that might
[1:34:18] come a preacher that will send a million
[1:34:20] souls to christ one person is worth a
[1:34:23] thousand worlds a million worlds
[1:34:25] amen one soul if you bring one soul to
[1:34:27] christ amen that's worth more than
[1:34:29] anything else amen
[1:34:30] so we've got something to do and guess
[1:34:32] what a believer can't say well i'm just
[1:34:35] a husband or i'm just a wife or just a
[1:34:38] mother or just a father or just a
[1:34:39] janitor
[1:34:40] amen there are no just in the body
[1:34:43] amen because if god has called you to do
[1:34:45] it he's called you to be a supernatural
[1:34:47] whatever it is that you're talking about
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:49] a supernatural father a supernatural
[1:34:51] mother a supernatural preacher a
[1:34:53] supernatural janitor a supernatural this
[1:34:55] or that
[1:34:56] why because you're an overcomer and
[1:34:58] you're supposed to be different you're
[1:35:00] supposed to be better than anyone else
[1:35:01] out there when it comes to these things
[1:35:02] amen
[1:35:03] not as the world would would measure it
[1:35:06] but as god would measure it amen
[1:35:07] amen so you're not just that it's like i
[1:35:10] said before if you're married your first
[1:35:12] ministry is to what your wife and kids
[1:35:16] and then if you're a wife then it's to
[1:35:17] your husband and kids if you're a
[1:35:18] husband it's to your wife and kids
[1:35:20] that's your first ministry amen and
[1:35:23] within there brother branham has pointed
[1:35:24] to he says
[1:35:25] it's a powerful thing now he says there
[1:35:27] might be one man that gets one person
[1:35:28] who gets saved and that's a
[1:35:30] preacher that saves a million souls but
[1:35:31] watch what he says about moses mom
[1:35:33] he says remember when moses was a little
[1:35:35] boy it was a mother who gave him his
[1:35:36] instruction
[1:35:37] it was a godly mother who took little
[1:35:39] moses on her knee and said moses
[1:35:41] and taught him all he was her teacher or
[1:35:43] she was his teacher rather under pharaoh
[1:35:45] and said now
[1:35:46] those things they said moses someday
[1:35:48] you're going to deliver the children of
[1:35:49] israel
[1:35:50] and you're the boy that's called keep
[1:35:52] yourself pure and unspotted from the
[1:35:54] world for you're the one
[1:35:55] you're the one remember we're talking
[1:35:56] about overcomers and in the line of duty
[1:35:58] and we're talking about mothers now okay
[1:36:02] pay close attention mothers no other
[1:36:04] place do we know
[1:36:06] where he ever went to any seminary any
[1:36:09] teaching it all that he ever got
[1:36:11] he says his mother is the only one he
[1:36:14] stayed right in pharaoh's palace which
[1:36:15] was a heathen but his mother taught him
[1:36:17] he said that's a real mother she taught
[1:36:19] him the precepts of the lord
[1:36:21] she taught him how he must be holy she
[1:36:23] told him how and what he must live
[1:36:25] and how what god must do or would do for
[1:36:27] him and it stuck with moses all the days
[1:36:29] of his life
[1:36:31] he didn't just go out and try and be a
[1:36:32] deliverer on his own amen
[1:36:34] it was an intellectual conception but
[1:36:36] somebody had fed him this and he says it
[1:36:38] was his mother
[1:36:39] and any good true loyal mother that'll
[1:36:42] take her little babies
[1:36:43] instead of sending them to picture shows
[1:36:45] and dances and so forth like that
[1:36:47] and she'll put them on her lap and teach
[1:36:49] them about the lord jesus christ
[1:36:51] what's he saying one man amen your
[1:36:53] mother's
[1:36:54] what did he say you could raise a
[1:36:56] preacher it doesn't have to be a
[1:36:58] preacher though
[1:36:59] it could be a man that goes to work
[1:37:00] every day of his life and lives a
[1:37:02] testimony
[1:37:03] and maybe brings one of his co-workers
[1:37:04] in amen every soul is invaluable
[1:37:08] amen it's not whether we bring in a
[1:37:09] million but we want to bring something
[1:37:10] don't we
[1:37:11] amen that's a jewel in our crown for him
[1:37:14] amen so now mothers which is what we're
[1:37:17] speaking about when something comes
[1:37:18] against you in the line of duty what is
[1:37:19] it that holds the line
[1:37:22] right when something comes up against
[1:37:23] you in your day with your children
[1:37:25] maybe in your day with your husband when
[1:37:27] something's pushing in
[1:37:28] what is it that holds the line and says
[1:37:30] whoa whoa whoa
[1:37:32] what are you doing here what is it that
[1:37:35] rises up within you is there a power
[1:37:37] within you that steps up and says hey
[1:37:40] how'd you get in here this isn't your
[1:37:43] property
[1:37:45] or do we step back amen and is it
[1:37:47] despair or anger or depression that
[1:37:49] starts to work its way inward
[1:37:51] is that what rises up within us when
[1:37:52] these things happen amen
[1:37:54] amen when the kids just won't settle
[1:37:56] down when the baby won't go to sleep
[1:37:58] what is it that rises up it is is it the
[1:38:00] power within us or is it that despair
[1:38:02] that says here we go again
[1:38:05] amen amen or have you continually
[1:38:07] renewed yourself as we spoke about in
[1:38:09] the word of god
[1:38:10] and so what comes up automatically is
[1:38:12] something that says
[1:38:14] this isn't the way it has to be i mean
[1:38:17] this isn't the way it was meant to be we
[1:38:19] still have trials we read earlier
[1:38:21] and shadows and difficulties
[1:38:25] but what is it that's going to push him
[1:38:26] out is not depression
[1:38:28] what is going to push it up is is not
[1:38:30] just
[1:38:31] okay well here we go again that's not
[1:38:32] going to do it that's going to invite it
[1:38:34] to come in a little further and a little
[1:38:35] deeper amen
[1:38:37] amen you're a daughter of the king amen
[1:38:40] your husband has authorized you in your
[1:38:42] home
[1:38:42] to do whatever it is that you need to
[1:38:44] keep it a place of peace and rest while
[1:38:46] he's gone to work
[1:38:47] so you get to speak with your husband's
[1:38:49] authority
[1:38:50] which is under god's authority to any
[1:38:53] situation that comes into your home
[1:38:55] amen and listen it doesn't have to be
[1:38:58] some big thing
[1:39:01] when jesus defeated satan he only used
[1:39:03] the word and brother brahm says he did
[1:39:04] that
[1:39:05] so that the weakest christian could
[1:39:07] understand
[1:39:08] that they could defeat god they could
[1:39:10] defeat satan amen
[1:39:12] brother brother mark shared something
[1:39:13] with me from brother lonnie jenkins
[1:39:15] where he said
[1:39:15] we don't just rebuke satan but we rebuke
[1:39:18] him by the word of god
[1:39:19] amen because the word is our authority
[1:39:22] and so when jesus did it
[1:39:23] he said get thee behind me satan for
[1:39:26] it is written amen for it is written
[1:39:29] for it is written and he went right to
[1:39:32] the word and said
[1:39:32] what word give me i have authority
[1:39:35] through the word and i'm going to let
[1:39:36] that push satan back amen
[1:39:38] so when satan comes in you take that
[1:39:39] word and you just put it right in front
[1:39:40] of him and say satan
[1:39:42] get out of here because what greater is
[1:39:44] he that is in me
[1:39:45] than you amen the fruit of the spirit is
[1:39:49] love
[1:39:49] joy peace patience kindness goodness
[1:39:52] these different things i mean and you
[1:39:53] take that word and you push it
[1:39:55] and you push it and you push it and all
[1:39:57] of a sudden satan says
[1:39:58] i don't like it so much around here it's
[1:40:00] a little spiritual it's a little holy
[1:40:03] feels a little too joyous for me in this
[1:40:05] house i think i'll go try somebody else
[1:40:07] i'm going to go for easier pray man
[1:40:10] your house is your domain sisters your
[1:40:12] husband has made that your domain
[1:40:14] and you have the right to push anything
[1:40:16] out that comes in it amen
[1:40:17] but you've got to feed yourself in a way
[1:40:19] that will help you to do that every
[1:40:20] single time amen
[1:40:22] you're in a commissioned position you're
[1:40:24] in a commissioned position i think
[1:40:25] sometimes our sisters
[1:40:26] they don't realize what they've been
[1:40:28] given and then brother brown called you
[1:40:30] guys the fifth gospel you mothers
[1:40:32] fifth gospel he never called us that
[1:40:34] amen
[1:40:36] listen you're in the bride position
[1:40:40] everything we're talking about today is
[1:40:41] the bright position well guess who's the
[1:40:42] bride
[1:40:43] the sisters so if you have if we have a
[1:40:47] a a duty if we have a commission if we
[1:40:49] have a right as the bride of christ and
[1:40:51] as your
[1:40:51] as the bride of your husband you have
[1:40:53] the exact same rights
[1:40:55] in your home amen amen
[1:40:58] listen to this fathers you have the same
[1:41:01] authority obviously
[1:41:03] but fathers make sure you didn't let in
[1:41:04] what she's trying to kick out
[1:41:06] and then cause the buck stops with you
[1:41:08] so if there's something that you're
[1:41:09] dealing with make sure that you haven't
[1:41:11] let it in and then your wife's got to
[1:41:12] deal with taking it out again every
[1:41:13] single day man
[1:41:16] he says lebron says i can see shamgar
[1:41:20] standing there he looks out
[1:41:22] oh my his righteous indignation began to
[1:41:24] come upon him
[1:41:26] he got a little fight in him that's what
[1:41:28] you got to get is a little fight
[1:41:29] a little backbone take that wishbone out
[1:41:32] and put a backbone in that's right
[1:41:34] i think old buddy robinson his testimony
[1:41:37] said lord give me that backbone like a
[1:41:39] solog
[1:41:39] give me plenty of knowledge in the gable
[1:41:41] end of my soul and let me bite the devil
[1:41:43] as long as i got a tooth in my mouth and
[1:41:45] then gum him till i die
[1:41:47] what's that that's a never give up
[1:41:48] attitude never stop fighting
[1:41:50] never stop pushing never let satan have
[1:41:52] a moment of rest in your presence
[1:41:55] that's right that's the way to do it
[1:41:56] brother get some spunk about it
[1:41:58] stand up and claim your god-given
[1:42:00] privileges god promised you healing it's
[1:42:02] yours if you're too weak and jellyfish
[1:42:04] to take it you'll die
[1:42:06] you want to stand and say it's right and
[1:42:08] then stand he says hallelujah
[1:42:10] little old sham guard got his righteous
[1:42:12] indignation up
[1:42:14] we're allowed to have righteous
[1:42:15] indignation friends amen when we see the
[1:42:17] word saying one thing in our life saying
[1:42:19] another we have a right to say
[1:42:22] no enough amen enough
[1:42:26] he looked around he couldn't find
[1:42:28] nothing
[1:42:29] he wasn't a warrior why he's looking for
[1:42:31] a weapon they'd taken all the weapons
[1:42:34] he says but what was in his hand
[1:42:37] do you remember somebody else that got
[1:42:39] asked what's in your hand
[1:42:41] who's moses god said what's that in your
[1:42:44] hand he said a stick
[1:42:47] that became god's stick of judgment
[1:42:49] friends
[1:42:50] whatever you're holding in his presence
[1:42:52] he'll allow you to use on a
[1:42:53] on an enemy every single time he
[1:42:55] couldn't find nothing but an ox code he
[1:42:57] says you know what an ox goat is
[1:42:59] goat is it's an old stick that's got a
[1:43:01] big old brass lump on it
[1:43:03] they push the dirt off the plow and
[1:43:05] sometimes punch the cattle through the
[1:43:06] gate with it
[1:43:07] that's all he had but brother he was
[1:43:09] sick and tired of the philistines coming
[1:43:11] and taking what he had
[1:43:13] now we're talking about philistines that
[1:43:15] have spears that have swords that have
[1:43:17] shields that have metal armor
[1:43:18] that have helmets and he's got an ox
[1:43:22] gold
[1:43:22] piece what about yay long with a blunt
[1:43:25] end
[1:43:26] a blunt end not even a sharp end a blunt
[1:43:28] end
[1:43:30] he says he got enough though he had
[1:43:32] enough he says oh my aren't you tired
[1:43:35] mother
[1:43:36] aren't you sisters sick and tired of the
[1:43:37] devil telling me that i can't walk

[1:43:42] god bless your heart
[1:43:43] all things are possible to them that
[1:43:45] believe that's it
[1:43:46] shamgar said i'm sick and tired of it
[1:43:48] i'm not a warrior the odds are against
[1:43:50] me but no matter how much odds is
[1:43:52] against you

[1:43:56] said there's one thing i know i am
[1:43:57] circumcised i am an israelite
[1:43:59] that is an uncircumcised philistine i
[1:44:02] know that i'm right

[1:44:25] through the window
[1:44:26] and challenged 600 philistines and stood
[1:44:29] there and beat their heads in

[1:44:51] god-given privilege and beat

[1:45:19] don't have what it takes
[1:45:21] listen are you called to be who and what
[1:45:23] you are
[1:45:26] are you called to be who and what you
[1:45:28] are if you could say yes by the word of
[1:45:30] god
[1:45:31] then he says take that faith and he will
[1:45:33] back up
[1:45:34] amen he says beat his head in with it
[1:45:37] amen we all have a position to fill
[1:45:39] not in the church in terms of a deacon
[1:45:41] trustee pastor minister these things but
[1:45:43] we all have a position we all have a
[1:45:45] gift
[1:45:45] to supply the body with something every
[1:45:47] single one of us there is not one single
[1:45:49] person here old
[1:45:50] or young male or female that doesn't
[1:45:52] have a purpose for being here today
[1:45:54] not a single one and if you are standing
[1:45:56] in that whether you are a typically a
[1:45:58] mom at home
[1:45:59] or whether you are the pastor standing
[1:46:00] behind the hope but on a regular basis
[1:46:02] there's no difference when you know
[1:46:04] you're doing what he's told you to do
[1:46:05] then he says have that faith
[1:46:07] he'll back up or you'll beat his head in
[1:46:09] amen amen
[1:46:11] listen to this samson never cried to god
[1:46:15] he used his anointed gift he know that
[1:46:18] he was sent for the job he knowed he was
[1:46:20] born for that
[1:46:20] he knowed he was anointed with a gift
[1:46:22] and he beat down a thousand philistines
[1:46:24] he didn't cry to god god ordained him
[1:46:27] and vindicated that he was
[1:46:29] by the other things he had done he was a
[1:46:31] vindicated
[1:46:32] anointed servant of god to destroy the
[1:46:34] philistines
[1:46:35] and he did it it's that simple he was
[1:46:38] anointed to do it so he did it
[1:46:40] no matter what the circumstances was he
[1:46:42] did it he
[1:46:44] never asked nothing
[1:46:47] he that was his job can we get a
[1:46:51] revelation that we don't have to
[1:46:52] ask to do what god has told us to do
[1:46:57] you don't have to say lord am i able to
[1:46:59] beat the devil's head in today
[1:47:01] lord am i able to beat depression today
[1:47:03] lord am i able to beat this disease lord
[1:47:04] am i able to beat this
[1:47:05] situation lord am i do i have to ask to
[1:47:08] put money in the bank
[1:47:09] no lord i need it lord you told me to do
[1:47:12] it i'm doing it
[1:47:13] samson didn't ask he just did it because
[1:47:16] he was commissioned to do it
[1:47:18] amen he never asked nothing why that was
[1:47:20] his job
[1:47:21] that god was dealing through him he
[1:47:23] picked up that mule bone and got
[1:47:26] to beating philistines
[1:47:29] he never asked nothing you know why he
[1:47:30] didn't have to ask scripture says the
[1:47:33] spirit of god dropped mightily
[1:47:35] on samson how many times can you say the
[1:47:39] spirit of god has dropped mightily on
[1:47:40] you
[1:47:41] it happens doesn't it and you know
[1:47:44] exactly what's supposed to happen
[1:47:46] and you know exactly what you're
[1:47:47] supposed to do and the question is will
[1:47:49] you do it
[1:47:50] amen if you've got the holy spirit you
[1:47:52] know what it's like to have god drop
[1:47:54] down in a room
[1:47:55] and you know what's happening amen
[1:47:57] doesn't happen all the time
[1:47:58] and i believe the closer we get to the
[1:47:59] end the more we're going to experience
[1:48:00] it because we've got to be closer to him
[1:48:02] than we are to the world amen we've got
[1:48:04] to have that
[1:48:04] that clarity of relationship with him
[1:48:07] right
[1:48:08] so this is something i'm not preaching
[1:48:09] as if i've got this folks
[1:48:11] but i'm saying this is the standard i
[1:48:14] mean this is where we're looking
[1:48:15] this is what we're praying for this is
[1:48:17] what we're expecting in our lives amen
[1:48:19] is to have that closeness of
[1:48:20] relationship to where he speaks and we
[1:48:22] make the move
[1:48:22] and we don't have to hesitate or wonder
[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:26] amen like i said before there's no
[1:48:28] bluffing satan you've got to have what
[1:48:29] you say you have
[1:48:30] but when you start moving he starts
[1:48:32] moving amen
[1:48:34] because god's pushing them back amen
[1:48:37] they're on your territory and god has
[1:48:39] said
[1:48:40] none of them can stand before you
[1:48:43] listen to this jesus spoke and the blind
[1:48:45] saw the lame walk the deaf heard
[1:48:47] the devil screamed and come out the dead
[1:48:49] was raised up and everything why
[1:48:51] he didn't pray through he was anointed
[1:48:54] the messiah
[1:48:55] he was that messiah he knew he was he
[1:48:58] knew his position he know what he was
[1:49:00] sent to do he know that the father had
[1:49:02] identified him to be the messiah to the
[1:49:03] believer
[1:49:04] and when he met that believer with faith
[1:49:06] he just spoke the word
[1:49:07] devil scattered yes sir speak don't cry
[1:49:10] speak amen this is from the message why
[1:49:13] christ speak he says and he knew his
[1:49:15] god-given rights
[1:49:16] but we don't i would say intellectually
[1:49:21] we know them
[1:49:22] but remember we've got to know them by
[1:49:24] revelation because revelation is what
[1:49:25] makes the word manifest
[1:49:29] he knew what he was we don't this is
[1:49:32] 1963 after the seals
[1:49:34] okay he knew his god-given rights but we
[1:49:38] don't he knew what he was
[1:49:39] we don't he says moses had forgotten
[1:49:42] samson understood others understood
[1:49:45] joshua understood moses forgot
[1:49:47] god had to call his attention to it he
[1:49:49] said why are you crying to me i sent you
[1:49:51] to do the job speak and go on to your
[1:49:53] objective
[1:49:54] i told you you'd come to this mountain
[1:49:55] take them children lead them on
[1:49:57] just speak i don't care what's in your
[1:49:59] way move it out of the way
[1:50:01] i give you authority to do it you spoke
[1:50:05] in flies
[1:50:06] and fleas and creation and things like
[1:50:08] that now what are you hollering to me
[1:50:10] about
[1:50:10] why are you coming to me hollering these
[1:50:12] things just speak and watch a move
[1:50:14] that's all
[1:50:15] he says oh my oh how i love it god
[1:50:18] had honored everything he said
[1:50:21] and he was called for the job so why did
[1:50:23] he have to say
[1:50:24] what must i do there was a need
[1:50:29] there was a need not a lust of the eyes
[1:50:32] not a lust of the flesh
[1:50:33] not a thought of his own conceiving but
[1:50:35] there was a need
[1:50:37] in the line of duty amen there was a
[1:50:40] need it was just up to him to speak for
[1:50:42] it
[1:50:42] god wanted moses to put that gift of
[1:50:45] faith
[1:50:46] that he had given him to work god had
[1:50:49] vindicated it it was the truth
[1:50:51] and god wanted moses one of the people
[1:50:53] to see
[1:50:54] that he was with moses can you imagine
[1:50:57] yourself doing better
[1:50:59] can you imagine yourself with more
[1:51:00] patience with more grace with more
[1:51:01] humility with more strength
[1:51:03] with more discernment all these
[1:51:04] different things amen
[1:51:07] can you imagine it god's willing to give
[1:51:09] it to you
[1:51:11] when there is a need amen god doesn't
[1:51:14] just dump things there for no good
[1:51:16] reason he doesn't just fill you up so
[1:51:17] that you can walk around with a proud
[1:51:19] look
[1:51:20] amen but when the need comes then what
[1:51:22] happens is the spirit that worketh in
[1:51:23] you rises up to match that
[1:51:25] and it says exceedingly abundantly above
[1:51:27] it overpowers it over reaches whatever
[1:51:30] is standing in front of you amen
[1:51:32] so when you look at your situation you
[1:51:34] have to say what is the need
[1:51:36] that's what he said that's what he said
[1:51:37] about moses here he says what
[1:51:39] there was a need what's your need
[1:51:44] then he said speak amen he says and what
[1:51:48] god vindicated it amen god wanted moses
[1:51:51] to put
[1:51:51] that gift of faith that he had given him
[1:51:53] to work
[1:51:55] same thing for the bride he's given each
[1:51:57] one of us a measure of faith
[1:51:59] not all the same it'd be nice if it was
[1:52:02] all the same
[1:52:03] but we're going to get into it a bit
[1:52:04] later about what he says about those
[1:52:06] gifts and why they're given amen but
[1:52:07] each one of us is given a measure of
[1:52:08] faith and he says
[1:52:09] use that gift of faith and i guarantee
[1:52:12] this he will give you the measure of
[1:52:13] faith required to make
[1:52:15] it happen according to his word if he
[1:52:17] has told you to do something if he has
[1:52:19] promised something he'll give you the
[1:52:20] faith to take it
[1:52:21] amen amen i look at shamgar what did he
[1:52:25] have to use
[1:52:26] the only thing he had was an ox goat
[1:52:28] what do you have to use
[1:52:30] i don't mean to poke what do you have to
[1:52:32] use
[1:52:34] amen some of our sisters especially have
[1:52:37] a gift of singing
[1:52:38] guess what your weapon is probably going
[1:52:40] to be singing
[1:52:42] amen worship amen when satan comes in
[1:52:44] like a roaring lion what are you going
[1:52:46] to do you're going to raise up with what
[1:52:47] a song a praise amen the same anointing
[1:52:51] that comes on you here is going to be on
[1:52:53] you back home amen the same gift is
[1:52:54] there the same spirits there
[1:52:55] it has the same effect amen amen i love
[1:52:59] it when i go in a house and what i see
[1:53:00] is scriptures
[1:53:02] written and posted on the fridge you
[1:53:04] know why because something spoke to you
[1:53:05] about that and said
[1:53:06] this is for me and you put it up there
[1:53:09] and guess what when satan comes into the
[1:53:10] house and starts talking
[1:53:12] you don't have to go very far you just
[1:53:13] have to walk right over to that fridge
[1:53:15] and start reading that out amen and say
[1:53:19] satan get out of here and you start
[1:53:20] reading that scripture amen and what
[1:53:22] happens he can't stand there
[1:53:24] he can't stay in the presence of the
[1:53:25] word for long drives them nuts
[1:53:26] especially when it's spoken by a
[1:53:28] faithful heart
[1:53:28] amen filled with the holy ghost and
[1:53:30] expecting him to move on amen
[1:53:32] make it easy on yourself take what you
[1:53:34] have at hand but make sure you got
[1:53:35] something at hand
[1:53:36] amen sometimes i think we wanted to to
[1:53:39] have this great gift
[1:53:40] to somehow somehow do something to take
[1:53:42] it out
[1:53:44] listen if shamgar can use an ox gold you
[1:53:45] can use anything
[1:53:47] he's going up against armored soldiers
[1:53:48] and he beats him with something that
[1:53:49] shouldn't even be a weapon
[1:53:51] right take what god has given you if
[1:53:53] moses can use a stick
[1:53:55] you can use whatever he gives you amen
[1:53:57] paul and silas use this song
[1:54:00] right there they're fully chained up in
[1:54:03] prisoners chains with bleeding stripes
[1:54:05] paul and silas sang that night
[1:54:07] and in their pain or pray that night and
[1:54:08] in their pain began to sing
[1:54:10] their chains were loosed and they were
[1:54:11] free right they praised and worshiped
[1:54:14] and that was a weapon to what
[1:54:15] bring them into freedom i meant samson
[1:54:18] used a dry
[1:54:19] brittle donkey skull should have broken
[1:54:22] on the first hit on a brass helmet
[1:54:24] and yet he killed a thousand philistines
[1:54:26] with it he took was that what was it was
[1:54:28] it handy man
[1:54:29] david used a sling against an armored
[1:54:32] warrior
[1:54:33] but it was what it was something he was
[1:54:35] familiar with it was something that he'd
[1:54:37] used before amen
[1:54:39] that's what you've got to be you've got
[1:54:40] to be familiar with what god's going to
[1:54:42] use
[1:54:43] amen it might not look like much but if
[1:54:44] you're familiar with it god can do some
[1:54:46] tremendous damage on the enemy amen
[1:54:48] he'll push him back if you'll take it
[1:54:51] there was moses he's continuing on he
[1:54:53] says abraham seed and when he did he
[1:54:54] came to the gate in a line of duty
[1:54:56] he came to the gate of the red sea after
[1:54:58] teaching the people of israel of the
[1:54:59] promised land that god had promised
[1:55:01] he was god's prophet he had been
[1:55:03] manifested before the people as god's
[1:55:05] prophet
[1:55:06] god created by him god did all kinds of
[1:55:08] signs and wonders by him
[1:55:09] and he stayed just exactly with god's
[1:55:11] word because he sought god first
[1:55:13] that's the key because he sought god
[1:55:15] first he didn't seek man and he didn't
[1:55:16] seek himself but he sucked god
[1:55:19] and he knew his position he knew he was
[1:55:21] born for that age
[1:55:22] to manifest the word of god at that time
[1:55:25] if you get nothing else out of this then
[1:55:27] pick that one he was born
[1:55:29] for that age to manifest the word of god
[1:55:30] at that time that's the same thing it's
[1:55:32] got to be for you and i
[1:55:33] that you are born to manifest the word
[1:55:35] for this age
[1:55:36] and then right in the line of duty he
[1:55:38] come up against something that he know
[1:55:40] not what to do
[1:55:41] and that was the red sea well what
[1:55:43] happened the seed of abraham was
[1:55:44] promised to possess the enemy's gates
[1:55:46] so when the red sea became a gate that
[1:55:48] he couldn't come through
[1:55:49] god moved upon the scene and took the
[1:55:51] gate and went away with it and moses
[1:55:53] walked across on the sea
[1:55:55] on dry land his seed possessed the gate
[1:55:58] amen
[1:55:58] amen again it comes back to you've got
[1:56:01] to know who you are
[1:56:02] and what your place is it says moses
[1:56:04] knew his position
[1:56:05] and knew he was born to manifest the
[1:56:07] word for his age you've got to believe
[1:56:08] that what you're talking about
[1:56:09] that what you're dealing with is going
[1:56:10] to require a manifested word situation
[1:56:13] amen
[1:56:15] amen you will question your rights you
[1:56:18] over question your pers your personal
[1:56:20] property if you don't know
[1:56:21] that you're on something that belongs to
[1:56:23] you if you see satan on something you're
[1:56:25] not sure that's your property you're not
[1:56:26] going to fight the same way
[1:56:28] but if you know if you know and you know
[1:56:31] and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:56:32] that that belongs to you you will fight
[1:56:34] until you can't fight anymore and guess
[1:56:36] what he's going to give up before you do
[1:56:39] where god says it why you're an
[1:56:40] overcomer satan's not an overcomer
[1:56:43] you're the overcomer amen you've got to
[1:56:45] be settled on your calling and position
[1:56:47] why because otherwise
[1:56:48] what does uncertainty point to doubt
[1:56:50] uncertainty points to doubt uncertainly
[1:56:52] points to gray areas
[1:56:54] and certainly points to a question that
[1:56:55] hasn't been answered to your
[1:56:56] satisfaction and so you back away and
[1:56:58] say maybe this wasn't really mine
[1:57:00] my mistake i was going to step back and
[1:57:02] let you have it
[1:57:04] no but if you know that you've got a
[1:57:06] title deed to that
[1:57:08] doesn't matter what he says your name's
[1:57:10] on the title deed and you say sorry but
[1:57:11] title deed says this is mine i'm going
[1:57:13] to fight for it
[1:57:16] as we start to close brother braham says
[1:57:18] now i want you to notice
[1:57:19] when a man hears the voice of god
[1:57:22] personally
[1:57:23] here's the word of god now you can hear
[1:57:25] it you say well god has to come to meet
[1:57:27] me
[1:57:27] yes sir i could sit here and preach till
[1:57:29] i fail dead in the pulpit 10 20 30 50
[1:57:32] years from now
[1:57:33] you never hear it until god reveals the
[1:57:35] word to you
[1:57:37] you can sit right in your seat you don't
[1:57:38] have to be by a burning bush
[1:57:40] maybe you're closer than you think you
[1:57:42] are just sit there
[1:57:44] and let god speak to you in the word
[1:57:48] amen you have to be in the prophet's
[1:57:50] presence for this to happen
[1:57:51] you just have to be in the presence of
[1:57:52] god amen and then you have to be in the
[1:57:54] presence of the holy spirit moving
[1:57:56] through his word
[1:57:57] he says i don't care how old you are
[1:57:59] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:58:01] that's great if you're old and that's
[1:58:02] great if you're young it's great if
[1:58:03] you're in between
[1:58:04] amen there's no limit here the day that
[1:58:07] god could get you quiet enough to speak
[1:58:09] to you
[1:58:10] and you can hear his word that's the day
[1:58:13] he's talking to you
[1:58:14] no matter your age today is a day of
[1:58:17] talking
[1:58:18] this is an age where everybody has
[1:58:20] something to say
[1:58:21] and they won't shut up social media
[1:58:25] is rife with this amen
[1:58:29] everybody's got an opinion and they feel
[1:58:30] we all need to know it
[1:58:32] and everyone is right and therefore
[1:58:35] everybody's wrong
[1:58:36] you think about it everybody's right
[1:58:38] then everybody's wrong because they
[1:58:39] don't agree with each other
[1:58:41] amen but he says the day that god can
[1:58:43] get you quiet enough to speak to you
[1:58:45] and you can hear his word that's the day
[1:58:48] he's talking to you no matter your age
[1:58:50] but when god talks to a man and has got
[1:58:52] the voice of god in him and the word of
[1:58:54] god in him
[1:58:55] he said if you abide in me john 15 if
[1:58:58] you abide in me and my words in you
[1:58:59] you can ask what you will and it'll be
[1:59:01] done to you see there's nothing
[1:59:03] uncertain it shall be done that's right
[1:59:06] nothing uncertain amen let's get quiet
[1:59:09] before god
[1:59:11] amen let's get quiet before god and say
[1:59:12] lord what would you have to say i've
[1:59:14] talked a lot
[1:59:16] i've thought a lot studied a lot read a
[1:59:19] lot
[1:59:20] listened to a lot of services lord but
[1:59:22] what do you want me
[1:59:23] to do what's your purpose what's your
[1:59:25] plan for me
[1:59:26] amen amen as we close
[1:59:30] brother braham says this this is a
[1:59:32] closing up and why christ speak he says
[1:59:33] oh it anoints us
[1:59:35] when we see that we're living in the
[1:59:36] last days to find out that all these
[1:59:38] signs that we see taking place
[1:59:40] that spoke of in the scripture would
[1:59:41] take place in the last days
[1:59:43] all the way from heaven to political
[1:59:45] powers to the nature of the people and
[1:59:47] the demoralization of the world
[1:59:49] and among the women and how they would
[1:59:50] do in the last days how the men would do
[1:59:52] and how the churches would do how the
[1:59:54] nations would do and how god would do
[1:59:57] and we see it all laying right here on
[1:59:58] us this is 1963. imagine what it is in
[2:00:00] 2021 by comparison
[2:00:02] you talk about sodom and gomorrah it is
[2:00:05] i i gotta think we're past
[2:00:08] i gotta think we're past at this point
[2:00:09] amen but he says it's political
[2:00:11] it signs in the heaven it's the nature
[2:00:13] of the people demoralization
[2:00:15] and then he says women and then he says
[2:00:16] also men
[2:00:18] because that's where we're at is it's
[2:00:19] men and women that are both messed up
[2:00:21] right it's not just the loss of the
[2:00:22] morality of the women now the men have
[2:00:24] gone to
[2:00:25] equally bad if not worse right the whole
[2:00:28] thing
[2:00:28] but he says it anoints us when we see
[2:00:32] this happening
[2:00:33] because what that means that our time is
[2:00:35] here
[2:00:37] right because that's when the son of man
[2:00:39] is supposed to be revealed
[2:00:41] and he already was revealed but that
[2:00:42] means after that the only thing left
[2:00:44] is a resurrection and a rapture amen now
[2:00:47] listen to this
[2:00:48] he says oh it anoints our faith
[2:00:52] does it anoint your faith when you read
[2:00:54] the news
[2:00:55] when you see the latest travesty the the
[2:00:58] insanity the immorality
[2:01:00] does it anoint our faith or does it drag
[2:01:02] us down and say
[2:01:03] oh yet more to deal with
[2:01:07] brother brahm says speaking to believers
[2:01:09] it anoints our faith
[2:01:10] he says it moves us out in great cycles
[2:01:13] to what
[2:01:14] what what great cycles does it move us
[2:01:16] out into he says see
[2:01:18] it separates us from the other things of
[2:01:20] the world see no matter how little we
[2:01:23] are
[2:01:23] how much a minority we are how much
[2:01:25] we're laughed at made fun of it doesn't
[2:01:27] make a bit of difference that's all
[2:01:29] we see it there's something within us we
[2:01:32] were predestinated to see this hour
[2:01:34] and there is nothing going to stop us
[2:01:37] from seeing it why that great cycle of
[2:01:39] what
[2:01:40] resurrection is coming around again amen
[2:01:43] two thousand years ago and it's coming
[2:01:44] again
[2:01:45] again and he says our faith is anointed
[2:01:47] to lift us up into the great cycle yet
[2:01:49] again
[2:01:50] he says amen here god has spoke it it's
[2:01:53] already happened we see it
[2:01:54] oh how we thank god for this oh then
[2:01:58] it brings out your faith when we see
[2:02:00] these things
[2:02:01] happening here amen god bless you
[2:02:04] you'll stand and the musicians would
[2:02:06] come amen do you want faith
[2:02:10] how many want faith i want more faith
[2:02:13] i want way more faith than i have
[2:02:18] did brother brown say find your position
[2:02:21] be sure that you're called to be where
[2:02:23] you are
[2:02:24] doing what you are when you are
[2:02:28] and when you can do that you're in the
[2:02:30] line of duty
[2:02:31] he says and the word will back you up
[2:02:32] every single time amen
[2:02:35] find your place make sure it's the right
[2:02:37] time doing the right thing
[2:02:38] he says in the word we'll back you up
[2:02:40] every time amen if you're in that word
[2:02:42] victory is yours
[2:02:44] we're supposed to be manifesting the
[2:02:45] word that's what we're called to do the
[2:02:46] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[2:02:48] of god is to manifest the word for their
[2:02:50] day
[2:02:50] amen and that means that as he's
[2:02:52] appointed you as he's called you as he's
[2:02:53] commissioned you
[2:02:54] when you can find that and stand in it
[2:02:56] then god is going to come back
[2:02:57] time and time again abundantly
[2:02:59] exceedingly abundantly above what we
[2:03:01] could ask or think
[2:03:02] amen to meet the need and to meet the
[2:03:04] challenge for our day
[2:03:05] amen god bless you let's just bow our
[2:03:07] heads
[2:03:10] oh god i'm thankful for your grace or to
[2:03:13] help my voice to push through on this
[2:03:15] service
[2:03:16] lord we're thankful for the tremendous
[2:03:18] challenge that we've seen here
[2:03:21] and lord we speak not as if we have
[2:03:22] attained
[2:03:24] lord we've seen your grace we've seen
[2:03:26] you're moving we've seen your power in
[2:03:27] our midst
[2:03:28] amen but lord we desire a greater
[2:03:31] lord a greater walk lord a greater
[2:03:34] surrender
[2:03:36] lord so that when the need arises lord
[2:03:38] we're confident that we're where we need
[2:03:40] to be
[2:03:41] amen and lord it is not by any great
[2:03:43] thing that we do or say
[2:03:45] lord but it's only under that shed blood
[2:03:46] that we can have that confidence
[2:03:48] the lord we pray lord that as your
[2:03:49] prophet said that it would anoint our
[2:03:51] faith and cause us to come further away
[2:03:53] from the things of the world
[2:03:54] lord that that word will become so so
[2:03:57] common and ingrained to us lord that
[2:03:58] it's the only thing that can come out of
[2:04:00] our lips that can come out of our lives
[2:04:02] lord that can be expressed in our
[2:04:03] actions lord we pray your holy spirit to
[2:04:06] just anoint your people
[2:04:08] lord give us strength for battle lord
[2:04:10] encourage us lord help us to recognize
[2:04:12] that this battle is not of men
[2:04:14] lord but it's a spiritual battle fought
[2:04:15] by spiritual people with spiritual
[2:04:17] weapons
[2:04:18] and lord we've got a supernatural god
[2:04:20] that's there to defeat every enemy
[2:04:21] behind that's ahead of us lord lord
[2:04:24] help us to find our place lord help us
[2:04:26] to rest in it
