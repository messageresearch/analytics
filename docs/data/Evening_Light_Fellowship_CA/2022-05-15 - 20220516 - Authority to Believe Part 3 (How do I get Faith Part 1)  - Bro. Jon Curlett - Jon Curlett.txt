forgive us we ask lord for we love you and we want to serve you amen minister lord this morning [Music] jesus name we ask amen amen thank you musicians amen if you'll turn the scriptures to second peter chapter one i flip that around sorry this morning second peter chapter one in the scriptures amen certainly seems like people came to have church this morning amen it's good to be joyful amen we ought to be joyful people we have a lot to be joyful for abraham said we ought to be the happiest people in the world amen and i believe we are this morning but it's certainly lord it helps the minister when he comes in and everybody's just in there and they're pulling and they're worshiping and there's a unity and and and we're all here for the same purpose amen and it's not to listen to me and then it's not to listen to me but it's to hear the word of god this morning certainly in anticipation for the special meetings just add one thing we will have brother joe speaking on wednesday night as well so we'll have four services with brother joe um so certainly keep him in prayer and and sister jessica's wife as they travel that all things would just go well but uh just hold things on your heart the beauty of a visiting minister is he knows nothing i don't talk to visiting ministers like i said about anything that i might see or perceive in the church but we let the holy spirit just have free reign in our lives so amen if you have a need if you look at you're looking for a change whatever it might be if you're looking for more of god if you're looking for healing if you're looking for deliverance whatever it might be just hold these things on your heart come expecting and trust god to minister to your life amen amen second peter chapter 1 and verse 1 says simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ now notice who's receiving this message it's those that have the same precious faith peter says and it's the same faith of the apostles and they've received it in a particular way and it's through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ verse 2 says grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us a few things many things no it says all things all things that pertain to two things life and godliness what that means is everything that you have need of he has given you through jesus christ amen through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust catch that exceeding great and precious promises this is not some limp promise this is not a half dying plant that he's given you as a gift but he's giving you something that is great and exceeding what that means is it is more than you realize right sometimes we think well it's a lot but exceeding means that you think it's this much and it's this much more than actually what you're thinking it's beyond what we can ask or think is really what he's saying everything we have need of and then some is what he has prepared for us and given to us in these precious promises amen and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and the patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you okay there's a condition now for if these things be in you and abound so not just a little bit but they're in you and they're growing they're increasing inside of you they shall make you that you shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen you can have your seats this morning god bless the reading of his word amen we want to continue this morning on our our little mini series on authority to believe and i want to take a a a little portion here called how do i get faith amen now last service we covered fairly extensively what faith is and i think maybe some of us realize it's a bit more than what we thought because it it looks beyond just the idea of faith but it looks to god and it looks to the love of god and it looks to the will of god and and these many different things but once we know what it is we want to know how do i get it now i want to say up front that this is a bit of a trick question you say how do i get faith well we know it's a revelation of the will of god and it's tied to these different things but we look at faith kind of as something like you'd have in a cup of water and i want to get more faith so i want to take what's in the cup and i want to pour it into my life but we'll see as we go here that it's not about having more or less because remember we spoke that brother brahm said when god gives you the holy spirit he gives you everything that you have need of to take you off of this earth amen so the faith of christ the very faith of god is within us as believers when we receive the holy spirit paul talked about he said the life that i now live i live by the faith of jesus christ so the faith that he has is no different than the faith we have and it is this like precious faith that peter is talking about it's all the same faith and the question is not how much do you have it's how much will you give it free reign in your life how much will you allow to have an effect in your life because you'll see as we get into it today we have hindrances and we have these little sins that easily beset us little unbeliefs little attitudes and these different things that hold us back so the question is not how do i get it so much as how do i let it have an effect in my life and faith all it is what we're talking about we say well well i went from from not having faith to having faith because i went from not being able to be healed to be healed and i got more faith no what you went was was a place of your faith being ineffective to your faith being effective the faith was always there you just had to get it to a place where it could actually do what it was supposed to do but it was always there within you and i i think that's a consolation to the believer because what it means is you don't have to do something to get it you already have it you just have to let it work inside of you is really what we're talking about amen so so faith moves you from the i don't believe to the i believe side all it's doing is it's shifting you from i'm not too sure about this to i know very sure that this is for me and this is what god has given me amen so we'll see that faith is actually more like a seed than it is a cup of water you don't just pour it in but it's something that you allow to grow and have effect in your life and move into every aspect of your life because it has potential it's not just a little bit here and a little bit there but it's something that has potential and it's growing to something and and we'll see as certainly not maybe in this service but in other services where jesus likens the word of god to what a seed because it has everything it has need of inside of it but it's growing and maturing inside the believer amen now i wanted to start in this scripture in ii peter because i'm speaking to believers this morning amen we're not going to talk to the unbelievers this morning we have believers sitting here amen are we believers this morning then let's focus on what he said about the believers let's not focus on what this one might do or what that one might do or or what what if you're halfway in if you're an unbeliever but let's look at it from a position of like precious faith as peter put put it because there are some nuances to faith there are some nuances to faith and you'll see that you have the roman centurion in scripture and guess what he's not a believer in the sense of he is not a man that gave his life to the one true god but yet he came in faith he asked and he received but jesus never asked anything more of him he said this is what i want and he said okay i'll come lay hands on him and he said no no don't do that just say the word and he'll be okay and jesus said wow i haven't seen faith like this in all of israel but jesus didn't say do you believe in god or he didn't say have you been baptized according to the baptism of john or will you be my disciple he just said you believe i'll give you what you ask for but you'll see he goes to other people and he asks something of them and brother branham when he had people coming through the prayer line he would treat believers different than unbelievers now i spent quite some time just in the office this morning looking through it because i was listening to another uh a couple messages this week where he has people come through the prayer line and he he goes and he's he's talking to him he says now you're not a christian you're not a believer and what does he do he says will you accept christ as your savior they'll say yes and then he says then in jesus christ's name i give you your healing or i pronounce you healed or your cancer is gone are these different things but when the believer comes through what does he do before anybody comes up he says if you have unconfessed sin in your life get it under the blood because he says in that presence every sin will be revealed and i was listening to to a testimony the other day and one of his his business managers one of his campaign managers said i never saw it fail up there but that if unconfessed sin came up he said you've got to make that right you can't come through the line you can't get your healing you can't have faith for healing even unless you've got your life lined up with the word and your sins are under the blood amen now it doesn't mean that a believer can't have any promise in the bible but it means that if you need a promise you've got to line up with the word and that means you have to be repented it means your sins have to be under the blood it means that your life has to be made right according to the scripture before god will even allow your faith to take a hold of the word the same way that it should amen there's something that he requires of us we are a church we are the called out people and he has a different standard for us than everybody else amen so we don't just walk around doing things willy-nilly and then come in and say god i'm here for your promises no he has an expectation of his sons and daughters and that's that they live by the faith of jesus christ so their life shall be reflecting that and unless if it doesn't he says you've got to make it right before i'm going to deal with you in this sort of thing amen you're going to have a barrier between you right now brother banham if you remember this story i'm going to read a quote here for in a second where remember he had that woman come up and she cheated on her husband and she had a very bad disease and and he said he pulled her aside says now you can't i can't pray for you because you've got unconfessed sin and you've got to do this you know and and she says well i i already i already confessed it to god and this is what brother branham says he says i said it wasn't god you sinned against it was your husband and if you'd have been a single woman it'd have been different he says if you're a single woman you went you you you know you had relations with a man he says you just confess that to god because you don't have any obligation to anyone else he says but you sinned against your marriage vow she said well brother so-and-so told me and i said sister that doesn't have anything to do with it that's unconfessed sin and they could pour oil on your head till they got a gallon on there they could stomp and kick and snort and run across the platform and scream and holler they could have a good old gospel jubilee but he says it wouldn't make a lick of difference he says that devil will stay right there he's got a right to and as long as he's got a right to stay there he will hold his ground in other words the devil ain't going to move if you've got unconfessed sin in your life because he doesn't have to he has a place of holding there he's got a fortress there in that unconfessed sin that darkness is where he will hide amen because it's unconfessed sin i've said i've done all she said i just can't do it i said now sister you come here and god in his mercy has revealed what your trouble is go make that right with your husband and you'll get well if you don't then i've done all i can she said i just can't do it she said it'll break up my home i said all right i just was god's servant i've done what god did me to boot to do so he says i've done my part the holy spirit's here it has revealed your trouble but it is also revealed you've got a problem in your life that you have to deal with and until you deal with it you cannot move on with healing you can't do it now the grace to this woman was when she goes to walk away and brother branham catches a vision he says your husband is such and such and he was with us so and so and he says your husband cheated on a woman the way you cheated with the man and she said then i can go confess now because he's done the same thing i did makes it easier for me what she means is it's not going to break up my home because he did the same thing i did if we can just forgive each other we can move on but he didn't say that to the prostitute amen all he said was will you accept christ as your savior yes then he says then i'll give then then i'll pray for you and god will heal you he didn't follow up with him after but he does say if you're not sincere if you don't go and do that it'll come back on you right so there is a standard there is a requirement for those to come that know christ to come in under the shed blood amen you've got to have everything under the blood you've got to be a prepared vessel amen brother branham says this he says here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the son of god and yet we find the church in an anemic condition we ought to be great strong mighty warriors of faith that would shake a nation god gives it to us we would just receive it so there's little things upon us that holds us back from running now we're talking about how do i get faith or how do i let faith have have reign in my life let's lay aside all those little weights now because we're looking to the author and finisher of our faith jesus christ who has made man on earth and dwelt among us and was made sin that through his righteousness we might be forgiven of our sins and when we see that it ought to attract the attention of every man and woman to lay aside every little skeptic talk oh i love that he says lay aside every weight and the little unbelief that does so easily beside us some little something come up and we say well i never heard of that before search it out in the scripture if it's in the bible stay with it amen so what's he saying he's talking to sons and daughters and he's saying what let's cast off every little sin that easily besets us every little unbelief every little twig every little he calls it that little skeptic talk right it's an attitude sometimes i speaking to myself that little cynical attitude that little skeptical attitude that would say that's not god doing that not just that's not god that person's not healed but it can be that's not god speaking over the pulpit that's not such and such no you put it into what the realm of flesh and it's god i was listening to brother branham the other day where he said a man was in his meetings and he wrote him a 20-yard page letter just ripping the hide off of him and saying that basically brother brown was wrong and the brother brahm says my dear brother he says first off i forgive you because he says you just called the holy what the holy spirit was doing of the devil and he says i forgive you and i pray that god will forgive you in your ignorance he said this a man had been preaching for 30 40 50 years whatever it was he said i forgive you and i pray that god will do it because why he took the working of the holy spirit he said that's a man and it's wrong and it wasn't it was the messenger of the age god working in a body yet again right right walking amongst us doing the exact same work and he said that is not of god it's the same thing they did to jesus he said i pray that he forgives you amen but he says what these little things because what a lot of little hindrances add up to one big hindrance and then sometimes we're saying well that doesn't really matter but when you get a bunch of little doesn't really matter added together it makes up one big thing that does matter and it'll stop up that flu amen and so faith can't flow through it as a flu flue it's like a chimney you know it's a something that smoke's supposed to flow out of and if you don't have that opened up then it clogs it up and all of a sudden it puts the fire out amen now the reason that we started in second peter this morning is because believers have a foundation of faith and then we're talking about faith how do i get it how do i let it have a free reign in my life and that's the starting place because the foundation of every believer is faith in jesus christ amen and that first faith that we have is for our salvation as we talked about last service and then from there it moves on to that amen but you can't believe anything unless you have faith faith is literally the definition of true belief right if you don't have faith you don't believe and you won't act on these different things and and the jesus will put it this way he says in matthew 23 says heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away you've got to have faith in something and i'm pointing you to where jesus says my words won't pass away you have to have faith in something that won't pass away otherwise your faith will pass away along with the thing that does pass away if you put it in a man that man passes away then all of a sudden then your faith is gone you put it in a church you put it in a one-time experience outside of the new birth you put it in your worship your ability to shout praise whatever it might be if that's where your faith is it's going to fail every time but jesus says my words will never pass away so you have a sure foundation right there then paul would come along and say so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god how do i get faith here's your main scripture faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god now brother branham explains he says first faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god then the believer hears it recognizes it and acts on it that's a true sign of faith hear it recognize it and then you act on it the carnal man will hear it the sound of it but never act on it amen here means to understand look at is something this is look at is looking at something but to see it is to understand it and except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of god remember laying another foundation this morning faith is not based upon a myth and a pump something that well just says go do this or that guess what you're going to have what i would call unctions in your life to go do this or go do that and that does not make it god guess what there's people all over the world have things that tell them go do this and go do that that doesn't make it god that just makes it an influence that's trying to get them to do something he says on the words of some men but faith takes his eternal resting place upon the word of the lord upon god's word which is the bible and everything without faith is sin unbelief is absolutely sin everything that's not of faith is not of god wow everything that's not of faith is not of god you must believe and the only way you can have faith is first see what god said about it and then believe his word that's true that's the only way you can do it so go looking if you have if you're looking for faith go looking in the word of god that's always the first place it's the only place to start amen he said i was certainly packed away while standing there listening to brother depletis bring that message on the apostle peter being able to walk on the water something he never did before and we can do just just do many things we never did before if we'll just listen to his word and take his word for it he never made a promise but what he will stand behind amen last he says now expectations it has to be built upon something that's got a faith behind it because if you're expecting something it's because something's been promised or some way like that so if you want to have real expectations it must be built upon thus saith the lord that's where the soul rests amen is on thus saith the lord now that's the word of god for the believer it's the word of god now god can send a prophet or he can send a prophecy or these different things i would say thus saith the lord but day to day our thus saith the lord is this this amen not the messages this is thus saith the lord because what did the messages do come to point us back to this amen so why are we only listening to messages and not reading our bibles why do we quote brother branham more than we quote the scripture we're out of balance i would say he's pointing us back to the faith of this so we need to get back into this amen not putting him aside by any means i use quotes i use quotes quotes quotes quotes quotes not point down but i'm saying those quotes ought to be quickening this we're not looking for the quickening power of the quotes we're looking for the quickening power of the word that the quotes point us to amen because that's where the life is is in the word amen but brother brahm says our faith for the believer is on one resting place alone and that is thus saith the lord which is the word of god that is the word of god now the word of god is not bound to this like i said we can have somebody raise up in church under the inspiration of the holy spirit and say thus saith the lord give a prophecy and it will be that and if they are truly anointed and it comes to pass and that's thus saith the lord we can have that but our day-to-day thus saith the lord is the word of god amen amen so i don't understand then when people go looking for what the word doesn't say they're looking for loopholes because it doesn't make sense to look for loopholes because your faith is built on something and if you're looking for a loophole your faith is built on nothing how can you have faith if you're looking for a loophole there's nothing to base it on they're saying well the word doesn't say i can't do it but the word says there's a bunch of stuff you can and should do so focus on what it says you can and should do don't look for the loophole because you can't have faith in a loophole you can only have faith on the solid word of god so focus on what god said he gave us his word to do something so don't go looking for what he didn't say because there's no faith in it right go for where the faith is and that's in what he said amen focus on what he gave not on on what he didn't give listen the way brother brown says he says now we believe can god do god can do things that's not written in this word we believe that because we've seen it guess what i saw a testimony this morning from brother tim pruitt's church where that uh one of the little girls in their church fell down she broke her arm and her arm was like this like this and then like this like an s shape a bad bad break and she fell down and and they took her to the hospital and the surgeon said we're gonna have to do some major surgery here we're going to put multiple pins in what not and they prayed for her and they took her back at the appointed time to go in there and they said let's do another x-ray and when they looked in everything had gone back into alignment they said all she needs is a cast amen what is it god didn't put that in the scripture you can't go to the scripture and say we're god aligned bones that were so completely badly broken that somebody would have to get pins and surgery but the prayer of faith caused it to happen amen amen but we're looking to put our faith on what he said and what he said is i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases amen and that's where we look is not in the specifics but in the generality of that sort of thing he says but we like to stay just with what he has written then we know we're sure if you just stay with what he's written in his word that's where i want to stay amen this is more than enough that's more than enough we don't need to add to it and we certainly don't need to take away from it this is more than enough it was more than enough for the apostles it's more than enough for us amen he said his word is always the truth it's always the truth his believing children believe for it and cry for it until his word is vindicated and his word is always his will if you want to know what the will of god is find it in the bible it's god's word anything contrary to it is perverted and don't get into that hybrid condition what god said that's the truth amen so as we said before the first time you see this kind of faith is when you what except jesus christ as your savior by acts 2 38 amen repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you receive the gift of the holy spirit and the reason that's critical is because everything you do after that is based on that same faith and we'll get into here where brother braham says it's the same faith the same faith that saves you is the faith that heals you is the faith that delivers you is the faith that provides for you and all of these different things it starts on the faith that when you accepted christ as your savior and you moved on in faith to the full baptism of the holy spirit and then it just starts to grow and mature inside of you amen why why is that critical because that's the first place where you take god at his word that's right acts 2 38 is the first place where you take god at his word as a person personally amen acts 2 38 so everything comes off of acts 2 38 and guess what if you look in the scriptures they didn't do anything until they had the same experience of acts 2 38. so their experience built off the exact same thing they repented they believed they got the baptism of the holy spirit then afterwards you can move on to isaiah 53 where by his stripes we are healed and all of these different things but it's got to start with that acts 2 38. amen but it's accepting the promise it's accepting the promise by faith that when you step towards him he's going to step towards you and he's going to give you the promise of the holy spirit in your life he says now to these that are open-hearted to god's word by faith i plant the seed i plant it in the name of jesus christ in faith in god but lord jesus i committed to you now water it send the spirit upon it lord that germatized word there that you're the same great god to heal the same great god to save the same great god and resurrection you are god may i produce a crop a bride for the lord jesus a sanctified womb of the heart to receive the word he says granted lord i commend them to you to pick from here lord if possible everyone your bride in the name of jesus christ amen it's all the same god it's the same god that's healing he says what you're the great god to heal the great god to save the great god and resurrection you are god he says it's all the same god and then he comes and he says it's the same faith he says it's in the same atonement that the finished work was completed at calvary by our blessed lord and it's your personal faith in the finished work of christ at calvary that brings both salvation and healing he says it's your personal faith not meaning it's the faith that you built up but it's the faith that you have your personal faith the faith that god has given you as we said it's not of faith or works that any man should boast but it's by what faith through grace that we have it but he says you have a personal level of faith and that's given to you and it's no different for your salvation than it is for your healing it's just applied differently that's in as in it's applied to a different portion of the word but all you're doing is accepting the same word of god amen but then brother branham would would say he gently admonished the church because he'd say you ought to have more faith than you have you ought to be further along than you are but he gently admonished and watch how he does is this because he'd always point to god's provision amen amen we aren't what we ought to be many times and he says but god has made a provision for when you fail or when you fall short he says no man could save you no matter how much he'd pray for you you're only saved by faith no man can heal you you're only healed by faith now you ought to read the word and not even have to have a preacher just stand there and read the word and believe it he says that's how simple it ought to be he says but god is love and he sends preachers around he anoints preachers and they preach the word they see it on the word and they preach the baptism of the spirit being born again and you believe it accept it and get born again is that right he says you ought to be able to get that just by reading the bible but he says no but god is love so he sends you love gifts and it sees men he says now you ought to believe divine healing but if you don't believe divine healing then god sends ministers around preaching divine healing you accept it believe it and you get healed now since those works has been going on for many years god in his mercy has done something else for us which is send his angel from glory to manifest to his people the prophetic gift of god which can only bring faith up into the level to where you can be healed or accept your healing from jesus christ amen ephesians says that he gave gifts to men so the men themselves have gifts as a spirit but the men themselves are gifts to the church that's what he's saying is he's saying god loves you so much he gives gifted men to you to help raise your faith to do what accept the word and act on it amen right so when brother joe gets up here that's a gift of god to us when brother joe comes that's a gift of god to us when brother ed hammond reister comes that's a gift of god to us whatever minister it would be stand behind the pulpit that's god's gift to us to get us to do one thing raise our faith to the place where we would walk in the word of god willingly accept it and act on it and be an expectation for receiving today man so i say all that because like i said he's in gently admonishing us you ought to just believe it but he says you don't so then god sends you love gifts and it's these men with gifts and ministries to get you to raise up your faith so i want to take that and say don't dwell on failure i mean don't dwell on where you've had maybe more more zeal than wisdom or where you've moved without the will of god and maybe fallen short it's like we read that story last service or the surfs before about the mama eagle and she brings the little eaglets up and she drops them off and says fly and none of them fly but what does she do she catches them she takes them up high so that when they're falling they don't hit the ground swoops down catches them brings them up and says try again what is it they're developing wings of faith amen so just because you failed the first time or just because you feel you're failing now doesn't mean you're not an eagle don't expect to fly like mama eagle the first time right you've got to grow you've got to grow and so you've got to come up to the place where your wings can just set themselves right and you know how to flap them you know how to catch the wind and these different things but they just sit there and you know why they fail because they're trying to do it all themselves you watch them right what does mama do she's not even moving just one or two flaps i was listening to that story where brother brahm talks about you know he's he's up in the mountains and a storm comes in he's under a tree and he's got that little little chipmunk chattering in his ear and he says i thought it was chattering at me but then i saw this great eagle in there and it kind of ducked down in under the storm he says but then it came out and the the chipmunk was chattering at it and he said that eagle just after a while got sick of it and he just went two flaps of his wings he says and then he caught the wind and he was gone right how much effort did he put in one two boom gone and then he just caught that wind and he said he just sort out over the trees that's what the eagle does right you're just getting those flaps to get off the ground for a second and then once you get up into the air the air does all the work that's all it is you're trying to do too much and you got to learn to rest and let that what the winds of faith carry you as we sing amen amen don't get discouraged because you didn't fly like your mama the first time amen you're still an eagle amen but the point that matters is your faith in god that's what matters is that you tried to fly that you you took god at his word and you stepped out on it now the other thing is just because you're not flying now doesn't mean you're not going to fly before you hit the ground sometimes you're sitting there you're saying i'm doing this and nothing's happening but maybe as you go it'll settle out and all of a sudden you'll start to fly and soar right don't look at the current condition don't look at the current circumstances don't look at your current level just keep flapping and saying lord i'm trusting you to catch me if i don't have it amen he's never failed us he's not here to to watch us i heard a brother say the other day he's not standing there with steel toe booze ready to stomp us into into the ground you know when we fail no he's not that he's just there to carry us up again say try again son try again daughter amen what i'm telling you is you're already built to fly you're an eagle that's why brother brown keeps going eels you're built to fly so guess what you're gonna fly and maybe not today maybe tomorrow maybe next month maybe next year but you're going to fly in the situation that you need to fly in amen amen we're not we're not revised creatures remember we're new creatures in him and win that new creation we are built to do everything that this word calls us to do amen glory he says now there's a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose we're talking about your your faith we're talking about being born an eagle he says it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets god a man can never be the same if ever he meets god face to face it will change him in spite of anything you can do about it a man can never be the same after he once meets god now that's the truth now notice he says he can't help it no matter what you try no matter what i try if it's sister justine and she goes into the presence of god guess what sister justine can't stop from changing and i can't stop sister justine from changing why because she has met a living god and she will change whether she wants to or not is what he's saying now we have a desire to change because he's given us that desire he meant but the change happens whether she wants it or not or whether she realizes it or not right the eagle just eats and eats and eats and then it grows and it becomes the fully mature eagle they don't always realize how big they're getting they don't realize the strength they're gaining until all of a sudden the situation comes up right and all of a sudden they've got what they need for it amen but brother braham says the new birth gives you a purpose and that purpose is to solely glorify and praise god we are here for the glory of his praise and we'll read that in a moment amen wow we all have that same thing your faith ought to give praise and glory to god not yourself right but to give glory and praise to god now that's going to differ whether you're a man or a woman whether you're married whether you're married whether you're a minister whether you're a member of the lady it's going to differ from person to person how we do it but it is all for the glory and the praise of god amen but that initial faith we have that's the start of it and it's funny because we say healing wow that takes a lot of faith let me talk to you about the faith that it takes to believe that you're a son and daughter of god because what you believe when you accept christ as your savior you go down under the water in baptism by faith in jesus name and raise up what you're saying is i i have no sin i cannot be condemned i have eternal life i'm going to rule and reign with jesus christ and i'm a new creature and all you did was went down in the water and came up you had faith that that going down in the water represented a complete and total creational change for you and then you say but it's hard to believe for healing you just believe that you're going to rule and reign with christ that's the faith that you have when you go down in the waters that you're going to rule and reign with christ that you have eternal life then nothing can change you from the end that god has put for you and then you say but i can't believe him for my toothache to get healed for my headache to go away for whatever it might be you're the faith that you have to accept salvation is far greater than anything that you could have for healing the difference is that you can't see what's going on inside of you but you have faith for it but you look in the you know i can feel the headache that i have before i get up to preach right you can you can feel the arthritis in your limbs right you can maybe see the cancer or the goiter on your neck the way brother brown prayed for so many of them you can see it and that's what hinders your faith is that you've got something here that says it's it's there but your faith to start is so much greater because you believe it's going to take you all the way to the heavenlies amen when you lose do you lose your salvation when you make a mistake do you think you do when you get a revelation of justification you will never forg you will never think you've lost your salvation because you're justified in christ and and the the revelation of justification is not that it's as if you didn't do it it is you never did it in the first place so it doesn't matter what you do it's all under the blood of christ and you're standing there in his righteousness not your own so guess what the true believer never thinks that they have lost their salvation because they've done something they ought not to but yet when our when our sickness doesn't go away as quickly as we want or it comes back we say well i didn't get my healing if we acted that way towards our salvation we'd be of all men most miserable wouldn't we but he says what don't look to those things amen we're not looking to that but we're looking to what the word says happened when we accepted by faith our salvation the same thing for healing no matter what the symptoms say it has nothing to do with the word keep moving on as if it was your salvation don't look at the way you're acting don't look at the way your body's acting but look at the promise of god amen the symptom doesn't change the promise or the confession amen we're looking to the author and finisher of our faith amen now ephesians 2 says and you have he quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins you were dead amen you aren't any longer you were living for yourself and you were dead and now you're dead to yourself and living amen it's a paradox he said wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh in the children of disobedience is this in your past it ought to be what children of disobedience amen we're leading up to something here but paul is saying this is the old you it better be the old you because you can't come into what i'm talking about if this is still you you cannot be a child of disobedience right you've been quickened you've been made alive something's changed we've got a visitor here i can only see him i think amen among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ and by grace our ye are saved and hath raised us together present tense raised us together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that's what happened when you were quickened by the holy spirit was that you were raised in the heavenly places with christ jesus that's right now i don't care what you look like i don't care what your life looks like if you have the holy spirit you've been quickened in christ jesus and you are sitting now in heavenly places amen that's where you stand right now he says what that in the ages to come so you're sitting up here but he says in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus are you ready for some exceeding riches in jesus christ's grace he says what for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk with them i want you to see there that before faith existed grace abounded amen amen you're here because grace abounded not because faith was there grace brought the faith that brings you to this place amen i want you to see that before you ever made a move god had already brought you to the end before ever you have made a decision god had decided for you where you were going to be amen i want you to see that you've been created for a good purpose and it is for what good works good works is what god has made us for now brother gerald has said this many times there's none good but god right what does he say are you good there's none good but god that's his his little phrase that he uses right you've been created under good works what are good works godly works right works according to the word of god you've been built for one thing and that's to manifest the word of god amen how do i get faith look for something in the word to manifest that'll be quicken to you amen when god called you and it ends and you answered it started you on a journey that will take you all the way to glory and between then and that there and now is going to be a manifestation of the word of god in your life there has to be because the word brings forth the word the holy spirit quickens the word inside of you it's got to come through amen the very fact that you seek after the things of god that you look to the promises of god is a testimony of the grace of god in your life that's put something in you to call for it in the first place amen now brother branham he's speaking of a plant that dies and goes to goes into the ground and rises up in the spring he says god had that little germ of life hid somewhere so he could live again because it's in god's will now that's you that's the seed in you from him right he said unless the corner we die and go into the ground it cannot rise again unless he died we couldn't come up but he died and he rose again but that life goes into what these dead bodies of ours and it has to be quickened by the holy spirit amen but he says god had that little germ of life hid somewhere so he could live again because it's in god's will it's god's plan god put it here for a purpose and it doesn't fuss or stew it doesn't fuss or stew about what other plants are doing or what other plants think about what it's doing it's just doing what it's supposed to do it just serves a purpose that god put in here for and it will just do the same serve the purpose that god put us here for he says not to just to mean we got to do our daily work and that's all right we got to do this that or the other but he put us here to be sons and daughters of god to glorify him and to praise him like the little flower now it's odd because we come up to this faith requirement then we say it's something i've got to do what makes us think that this is suddenly our thing to do it's something i i think believers have put on themselves that i've got to get faith no you have the faith of jesus christ living in you by the holy spirit so you don't have to go get it you just have to get things out of the way of it and even that often will take a working of god but you can absolutely have control over what things are happening in your life how you're spending your time how you're feeding yourself in these different things amen but the very faith to accept christ is a gift from god you don't work it up you had it because god gave it to you so when you look at faith it's no different you have it because god gives it to you and all you're doing is trying to get the things out of the way that would hinder it that's why the ministry comes as they're trying to get you out of those little things that's why an evangelist comes in and stirs up the waters to get the junk out why so that your faith can rise up that's often what it is so often when an evangelist comes what happens is they first deal with what the sin in the camp and then they move to the gift of healing or the gift of faith in these different things right they're getting you cleaned up so that you can accept the word of god so that you're in a condition to accept these things right but when he fills you with the holy spirit then what is that is that something you've earned acts 2 38 says it is the gift of the holy spirit so your faith is a grace is a grace gift right to accept him and then the holy spirit which is the very faith of jesus christ is a promise gift so why are we sitting there saying i've got to raise up my faith i've got to do this i've got to do that jesus never does tell us to do that he just says believe amen right he just says believe you've got the faith in you you just got to let it work get out all of the unbelief is all that we're looking for amen it's unmerited this is all unmerited yeah that's right so don't start trying to make yourself meritus to receive faith now brother bam says a man or woman gets desperate with god they show they're serious then god respects it but that's you getting what setting things aside so that you can receive from god that's how you show you're serious that's not what gives you faith that's what gives god a channel to raise up the faith that you have in your life in the first place amen but this is not because we deserve it it's because he decided we're going to do it and see because he decided we're going to be what we are amen everything from this that we do is the grace is the grace of god and it's a gift of god in our lives amen and what does it do it tells me that i'm qualified approved and certified to receive the promises of god that's what the holy spirit is that's a seal on me that says that i'm what eligible not just eligible but i'm certified to my destination amen right and it's no different from each and every one of you if you have the holy spirit that certifies you to be able to walk into the bank of heaven and say i have need of something and they say where's your sign where's your seal right here here you go it's that simple that's all we're talking about philippians 1 6 says being confident of this very thing that we he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ so if you think you started it you're already a failure amen if you think you did it you're already a failure because why you haven't recognized that it's christ in christ alone that's doing the work why because no man can come to god except god draws him first no woman doesn't matter anybody that comes to god they're coming because god has drawn them first amen the starter guarantees the finish amen alpha guarantees omega the author guarantees the finish of the story amen the first guarantees the last we have no part in this it's all his working in our life amen but now that you have the new birth when you have the new birth now god starts to work inside of you and he starts to build your faith to move beyond just salvation but he's moving you into greater and bigger things he's growing you out he's expanding you up amen amen what's he doing he's making this personal to you personal to you not just words over a pulpit not just words through a message book but he's making it personal to you so that what you can see the manifestation of god in your life brother brown puts it this way he says now we find in this little tree it pushes out when it grows it pushes out and when you're born into the kingdom of god just a little baby in christ everything you have need of in this life's journey is in you when you receive the holy spirit oh then what do you do what do you have to do is drink and drink and keep on drinking how do i get faith brother john how do i get my faith to grow how do i get my faith to expand drink drink keep on drinking what were you drinking when you started keep drinking that the word not just acts 2 38 but keep drinking the word keep feeding on the word keep sucking it in brother brahma he said another thing how does a tree grow he says it takes in more than it has need of it's not just looking for life sustaining it's looking for growth so it's got to suck in more than it has need of and that's what pushes these things out he says don't just stop when you join church and are baptized just keep drinking until you have faith for this faith for that faith for this and push out until all the manifestations of the holy spirit is living in the church he says there's got to be a reality of a new in the new birth being filled being born again and filled with the spirit and knowing the presence of god is here and seeing him carrying out his word and his promise just as he did jesus said if i be lifted up from the earth i'll draw all men unto me he says in the holy spirit is god and the holy ghost is god and god is the word the holy ghost is this word made fully manifested it's not just words on a page it's fully manifested in your life amen it's going to start with brother mark and it's going to move to sister maureen it's going to over the brother ellie brother joshua david and go through the entire church what is it each one of us is manifesting our portion of the word fully fully not partially but fully amen amen it says the holy ghost is the thing that brings us promised word to life so you say do i have faith do you have the holy ghost yes therefore you have faith you have the potential for everything that you have need of in this life when you get the holy ghost brother graham said amen the scripture says in hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must do two things must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you've got to know god is real okay you've got to know that god is real paul says you've got to believe that he is in other words you've got to know that when you pray somebody is hearing you're not just praying into the ether you're praying to a specific person you can tell when somebody's praying to a god they know have you ever noticed that it's not a big flowery praise usually it's not a big flowery prayer it's not what is it they're talking to a person we talk different to people than we talk to what make things known you know to to look a certain way but when you talk to god it's very specific it's very personal amen because it's a it's a i say a man but that's how we look at it but there's a person that's there listening to those words we speak very differently when we're talking to a person amen you've got to know that he's real to you amen you got to know that you're that somebody's hearing what you say and he's acting on it that's what he says you got to believe that he is amen we preached on that sermon of my god you've got to know that he is your god but paul doesn't stop there he says you've got to believe that he is and you've got to believe that he's a rewarder of those that really really really really really really really really really really seek after him diligently day in day out minute by minute you're looking for god in your life you're looking for the promises of god in your life you have a need you're looking for him you're coming to him you're talking to him amen it does you no good to believe he's real if you don't act on it amen if he's real then he's going to have real effect isn't he he's going to have something there and paul says you've got to have unwavering dedication to seeking god can't just believe he is but you've got to have unwavering dedication to seek after him because why you believe that what you seek for you're going to get amen what you're going to get is an answer not you're going to get what you asked for you're going to get an answer because sometimes you ask and god says no there's a quote maybe i'll bring in another service brother basically says he says i've never seen him fulfill not fulfill a promise unless he tells me why he what why he can't do it first he says sometimes he says no but he lets me know why but otherwise he says every time i've seen god fulfill his promises in his word jesus said this to the disciples he said ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receive it does everyone exclude anybody in this church if you're a believer you're included in every one everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knock it that shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son has spread will he give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him this is kind of the first kind of faith i don't want to go too deep in it but this is receiving faith that jesus is talking about because we have receiving faith we have acting faith it's two different things because you have faith to do things you have faith to receive things and he's saying you've got to have a receiving faith first and that's what we do when we go to him in in in faith and we we're baptizing as we're receiving we're saying lord we're doing we're looking to your promise amen we're going to receive the gift of the holy spirit and you act on it amen but this is a faith that comes from seeking asking and knocking and he says this is like a child that goes to his father amen now anybody that has children knows if a child knows that you have what he wants he's going to ask and he's going to expect to get it isn't he right if they know that you got a bag of cheesies in the cupboard and they want a bag of cheesies they're going to go say can i have the bag of cheesies and they're gonna keep asking until you either give it to them or firmly say no aren't they he says it's no different he says ask as if a son was going to his dad and say dad can have some bread he says when you go to when a boy goes to his dad and says dad can have something to eat he doesn't give him a rock he gives him something to eat right so he says go ask your father the same way because if you being evil in carnal base nature will do that than what what god who is actually good do for those that come and ask him right amen what if a chair if a child believes a parent is capable of meeting the need they'll ask and even if they're not sure they'll ask that's the childlike faith that's the receiving faith that we're looking for amen and jesus told the disciples to be like children and asking keep asking until you get it if you know it's available keep asking until you get it amen listen to this he's talking about jacob here and he says you know jacob and he wrestles with god he says the main thing was that jacob he had dreams and visions and so forth but this was one time he could lay his hand on something and say it's gone remember he's in bethel and he's laying down and he's he sees a ladder going up to heaven and angel's coming up and down that was not what anchored jacob and we preached on this before that was not what anchored jacob seeing great visions and dreams and being caught into the presence of god in these different things that's not what settled jacob what settled jacob was when he laid a hand on god and he was changed forever more and not to his nest his natural benefit i'll remind you he walked with a limp the rest of his life but brother brahm says he was able to hold on to it until the blessing came oh if we could do that if we could find a spot to where we could see god whether it's in his word wherever it is and recognize it's god and hold on to it until the blessing comes wrestle it out with god god promised to do it god said if we'd seek we'd find ask and it shall be given knock it'll be open then he says every word is true now receiving faith is what we're talking about it's not the same as the other types of faith it comes from the same place but it acts differently amen it's the one where you're asking and god's giving right other faith is where god's telling you in your doing that's a completely different faith and that comes by commission amen but there is a faith where you're asking in god's giving it's expecting but it can't do anything it's got to wait for god to give it to you but it's in expectation this is a faith that is an expectation and it's in peace and rest until it gets it amen i listened to a sermon a long time ago with brother noel johnson he says i've come to the place where he says i bring my need to god i let him know what it is and then i just walk away and trust that he's going to meet the need that's the kind of faith we're looking for isn't it where you just say lord as your child i'm coming with the need here it is and i'm just going to go away now i'm trusting you to meet the need because if you have a genuine need if your child has a genuine need how many of us won't meet it if your brother's sister has a need that you can meet how many of us won't do it god forgive us if we don't amen if we've got something that will meet the need then we ought to give the need amen each and every one of us amen whether it's helping brother vice in his house or whether his brother chad moving what do we do we don't sit back at home and say well he can do it himself we do we get in there we do it i'm saying to them this is part of our christian walk is to help the local believers amen not just by words and prayers but to go in and actually put our bodies on the line do these things to help people out in that amen but the thing is this brother noel johnson didn't say i trust you to do it in my time timing is all god's ours is to ask it's up to him to give to us amen how to meet the need that's his to choose because god in his sovereignty knows what's best because god's sitting there and he's got to balance our spiritual needs with our natural needs and if all we do is pray for our spirit our natural needs then we're not going to grow spiritually but god says no no no you've got to grow as a child you've got to grow as a son or daughter of god so i'm going to put you through what's called a trial of your faith sometimes so that you can grow spiritually before you can grow naturally paul said i would that you would be in health and prosper even as your soul does prosper god cares about our soul this body's going to be left behind our houses our cars our careers everything's going to be left behind god cares not a wit about that in the big scheme of things amen what he cares about is his soul being matured and growing in christ amen so god's balancing that that up and so god will use those natural needs to help us grow spiritually and then he'll come and meet the natural need amen but scripture says i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bread he's going to meet the basics but there's times where he says he'll have to put you flat on your back to get you to where he needs you to be so you'll look up to him amen you look at plants growing out i'm not a i'm not a i have a i don't have a green thumb that's for sure i don't do anything with plants but those that do know that if you only raise plants in greenhouses they're not the strongest plant you can start them there you protect them to grow but then you got to get them out into nature so they can have some resilience otherwise they can't fight disease they can't fight bad weather and what is it they don't have any strength in them because they've got the perfect growing conditions they have a life of luxury and ease when it comes to plants they don't have to dig deep because why you're putting in everything they need every day every week whatever it is you give them the perfect growing conditions but guess what god doesn't give us perfect growing conditions his perfect growing conditions are trials of what our faith amen trials and temptations is what the scripture says and we read that quote where brother bram says that's god's grace to you because he knows you can go through it and you'll come out stronger on the other side of it amen amen we don't get to choose how we just get to express the need and god gets to come back with his answer to it he says now the thing of it is god gives it sometimes in the way that we're not expecting it but god always keeps his word there's no way for god to tell you anything and lie about it and remain god he cannot he must keep his word forever it's the truth and when the bible says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that is the truth i may not have enough faith to make all these things that he done live again but i'd never stand in the road of somebody that has faith enough to do it i would be thanking god for that faith but just the same every promise that he made is absolutely true now you say the prophet of god was limited in his faith well when you understand that faith is a revelation of the will of god guess what it may not have been god's faith for brother branham to do everything that's why he didn't have faith for it was because it wasn't a revelation of god's will for him so that means that brother ellie could do something that brother branham couldn't if god revealed to him that it was brother ellis to do so could sister brenda so could sister maureen so could sister lily so could sister betty so could brother chad if god reveals you to do something it has nothing to do if anybody else has done it before if he's revealed it to you it's yours to do and god will give you the faith to do it amen but it's this struggle and it's the strength that shapes us and provides the character that we need you look at these kids that grow up in a life of of ease and luxury and they're all over the place you know on uh you know instagram and all these different things and they go and they're blowing some of them tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars i lived in vancouver and you see these 18 19 21 year old kids rolling around in a lamborghini gallardo that cost 250 000 right i guarantee you that the majority of those kids don't have character because they've had nothing to actually test them they just have everything given given given given to them and that's why they go through and they blow through a red light at 190 kilometers an hour and kill somebody's because they've had nothing to actually temper their character and then it's just it's the trial that that gives us that character that we need watch the way that jesus puts it in john he says a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the word into the world so catch that hard times precede joint happiness and wonderful things right and catch this nugget that it's not all fun and games he's he's literally saying that the christian life is similar to a pregnancy it starts with fun and games it slowly transitions to discomfort and then it goes into serious pain and anguish and then after that you get the fullness of joy that comes from the purpose of what started it in the first place but there's a there's a difficult time in the beginning or in the middle and then when it comes to the end when you're sitting there and you have in your hands that little boy that little girl then all of the anguish goes away now i can't speak to that only the mothers can't but my wife has said that you know you hold on to him for a little bit and you're willing to go through it all over again you know with a bit of rest and sleep hopefully but you're willing to go through it all over again because that bundle of joy is just sitting there and you're just like wow it was totally worth all that pain right he says your life as a christian is the exact same thing as a pregnancy he says and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice in your joy no man taketh from you he says i'm going and you guys are going to be really unhappy about it but there's going to come something that makes it all better again and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto you have asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full so he's giving the disciples a direction he says ask that your joy may be full your joy may be full he's got a direction here he's got a purpose for asking and it's that god wants us to have complete joy god wants us to experience the good things that he promised not the good things we want but the good things that he's promised amen there's a difference if you have the holy spirit hopefully your desires have changed to where you're asking for the right things but not always because we're in this carnal flesh and we're fighting day in and day out but god wants us to have this taste of joy day in and day out in our lives now john 15 says herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples so god is glorified when we bear much fruit not a bit not just a little bit you don't want to be that that little tree that just has one or two little little apples or little berries on it you want to have what a full crop there he says as the father had loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments and you you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you he's telling you how to keep the joy of god and he says what got to bear much fruit you've got to dwell with the father right he says and that your joy might be full he says if my joy remains in you then your joy will stay full that's how you get your joy full as you keep the joy of god inside of you that's what he's pointing to you can't have human joy that'll never work that's called happiness amen but what is that joy if we go back to first peter it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope that's a living hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time there's a salvation that's got to be revealed when now this is the last time there's a what a special salvation that's going to be revealed in our age and what is it it's a resurrection and a rapture it says wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations so he says look you're looking for this this faith that's going to be this this salvation that's going to be revealed at the last time but right now you're in heaviness because you're going through manifold temptations you're going through a lot of different trials but there's something being revealed in all of this and he says what that what the trial of your faith faith has to be tried faith has to be tried else it's not faith that the trial of your faith be much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love now listen to this it says in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory we're talking about the fullness of joy here and he says and and paul points us back here to what faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so he says though you don't see him you're believing amen that's faith is the evidence of things not seen he says you have faith and you're looking to him and you have joy in him even though you can't see him right what we rejoice before we see because we have faith and belief we read that last time remember he says if you know that you've got the money for the bread you can rejoice as if you have the bread he's saying even though you don't see the bread you can rejoice because you've got what it takes to get the bread in the first place amen so what's the end result of all this rejoicing it says what receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so what is it that brings that fullness of joy to the believer what makes you shout and sing and prays in the service before and after the preaching of the word it's what your faith your belief that god is working in your life amen why would you praise a god that has no effect on you why would you praise a god that has never had an effect on you it makes no sense but you praise him because of what he's done what he's doing believing and looking unto the thing that he's going to do what by his word amen what is it and so our faith has been declared when we go and we put ourselves under the water and we're baptizing these different things but between all of that and the and the the fullness of our joy we're given an earnest we're given a down payment to take us through amen what's a down payment it's a taste of more to come right and what does he do he gives us a the earnest of our salvation is what the holy ghost and then we have what the earnest of our resurrection and rapture is one thing and brother brown says it's one thing divine healing and then he says healing is what the earnest of your resurrection and rapture that's proof that there's something and more of it to come amen we receive their holy spirit as the earnest of our full salvation because we're only impartial salvation remember he says there's a salvation that's going to be revealed at the end time and it's what the salvation of our bodies not just our souls right everything now is caught up and we're back to our eaten condition he says so now jesus was god's manifestation of his own being on earth unfolding himself into a human being to take away sin and make a way for sickness to be healed and if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection of the dead for it's the earnest of your resurrection amen now we're talking to believers now i'm focused on believers because that's who's here and that's what we are amen but god gives believers that down payment to show that the promises are going to be fully expressed in the future he gives you a taste of it now so you know that there's there's the fullness of it of more to come amen so if you believe there's more to come there is more to come right if you desire more to come there is more to come if you have a if you're seeking for more to come there's more to come because there is only a desire for what exists god only puts a desire in you for more of what he's going to give you amen i said it before it and i said that you're what you're thirsting and hungry for is god showing you what's coming your way that's actually a quote from our pastor i had it written in my notes from many many years ago right what you're hungry and thirsting for today if it's according to the word is showing you what god is preparing to bring your way that's a wonderful thing whether it's for healing whether it's for deliverance whether it's a closer relationship with him whether it's for certain blessings or needs in your life if you're hungry and thirsty after it according to the word that means god's going to bring it your way amen [Music] matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled right so what you're hungry and thirsting for shows what's coming your way and jesus says you're blessed if you're going to hunger and thirst for righteousness now the first thing you say is what's righteousness what is righteousness because our righteousness is as filthy rags so you can't hunger after that you don't want to hunger after that you want to hunger after god's righteousness amen so jesus is talking to john you remember and he says it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness so what is that he said all god's word must be he he's talking like jesus and john are having a conversation here he says he's talking to john he says all god's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it's becoming to us it's behooving it's becoming it's like us for if we are the true witnesses of god today john we are the lights of this age and if we are the lights of this age there is so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us hallelujah says it's up to us to see all that all god's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his righteousness his word so it says blessed are those which hunger and thirst after his word for his day her day you're hungry and thirsting for what the word that's written for you to manifest to come forward into your life amen in other words he said john you know who i am i'm the high priest that's true john and i have need to be baptized of thee but we've got to fulfill all righteousness and i have need to be baptized of thee now to fulfill the word of god because all the word has got to be fulfilled what are you seeking are you seeking the word to be fulfilled or are you seeking your own lusts and desires to be fulfilled if you're going to have faith like god wants us to have faith to express faith it's got to be in what the word to be fulfilled in our life he says him we are the lights of the day and it's up to us to fulfill all of this so if jesus was there saying that then what are we to be saying today because he said later and we've covered this before he says ye are the light of the world and if it's what it can't be up on a hill and then hidden with a bushel he says you've got to be a light you've got to be the fulfillment of the word he says and i know that your righteousness and your desire is to fulfill the word it's becoming to us we are the lights so if we're hungry and thirsty after righteousness we're hungry and thirsting for god's word to be manifested and fulfilled through us amen that's god's righteousness that's god's state what is righteousness it's being right but it's not enough to say i believe it's right you've got to be right and then you've got to express the right you've got to express the word of god and that's what righteousness is is the expression of god it's light god's life inside of you pushing out god's will in god's word in your life that's what you're looking for you're seeking god let your word come out and let mine stay quiet even better not just stay quiet get out you know so i don't have to deal with the thoughts and the the isms and the attitudes and all these different things amen why because we've got to be the light of the world the world will never see christ until he comes back in judgment all they see is us and then we go meet him in the air they never see christ in that in that corporal body in a way that they might possibly understand or recognize until he comes back with ten thousands by thousands of his saints amen listen to this he says now how are we planted were planted in christ jesus now i believe just in my estimation of him he's the inexhaustible fountain of life that you cannot exhaust his goodness remember we're talking about what hungering and thirsting for righteousness he says some people think oh i hate to call on god so much that's what he wants you to do you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joys might be full but you've got to have your joy focused on the right thing and which is what the word of god coming out of your life not joyful because forgive me brother chad because you have a new house or because you have a new car or you have a rewarding career or you have an amazing spouse but your joy is full because what the word of god is living and improving itself in your life that's what we're looking for and we thank god for all the uh all the other stuff we're thankful that we have a house we're thankful we have cars we're thankful we have money in the bank that we have health in our bodies but our joy is full when we see the word coming through our lives and we see god expressing himself through us and we know we couldn't do it amen he says that's what god wants ask big things but watch the big things brother branham asks for he doesn't say i'm asking god for a million times a million dollars he didn't say i'm asking god for great health he didn't say i'm asking god for a great ministry he didn't ask for great fame and fortune he said i'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting i'm asking that every sick person that enters the door will go out of here well i'm believing it i'm believing that till we go there won't be another gathering together but it'll be a revival here satan's kept me out of here long enough and i believe the hour is here for a real sweeping revival in every church and around the country he's believing for what the word to go forth and have an effect that's what we ought to be praying for lord let your word have an effect in me in my brother in my sister and then let me act on it and let me help them and let me encourage them he didn't ask anything for himself he asked everything for the kingdom of god and for those that have a need in the kingdom of god that's how our joy is full uh my wife shared something with me the other a little while back and i think it was something along the lines of if you don't have joy or happiness do something for somebody else do something for somebody else and you'll see it fills up that love tank a little bit you know giving actually helps you not just the other person amen amen i didn't go home you know full of energy last night brother chad we put in a long day some of us guess what but i was satisfied when i laid my head on the pillow that night why because i went out and i helped somebody i was looking out for brother chad i wasn't feeling the best but i went out and i helped because brother chad needed help that's what we do that's what we do brother branham here he's saying i'm not asking for myself i'm asking for the kingdom of god i'm looking for the my joy to be fulfilled in what god having an effect in the people around us amen more of god that's what he's asking for more of god in you but that starts when i'm looking for that it's got to start with what less of me amen more god means less of me it's got to be there's only so much capacity in jonathan corlett and if i want more god or i want more faith then unbelief and jonathan corlett have to get out right to let more of it fill up that's all we're looking for we're just looking to give god more room inside of us that's how we're doing when brother braham says lift your level of faith all he's saying is you've only got so much in here go up here so that this falls out of the out of the vessel right get the junk out because that's what's holding you back till faith can co-opt and boom all of a sudden the word explodes out of your life amen what is it you want to recreate a relationship you know what i had to do and i had to get a when i wanted a closer relationship with god get out of love with myself drop the ego drop the facade and say lord i have need of you because guess what if you want more him that means that there's too much of you somewhere in your life and you got to stop looking at yourself and saying i'm as good as i think i am amen amen he is the one that's good none of us are good amen amen i'm not trying to be hard on you because i'm preaching to myself and i'm speaking from experience and i'm saying you can't get anywhere with god if you say i need him but you can actually express where you need him you got to look in the mirror god's word and say i am short i am short and i need you to raise me up to the level of the word amen it's a lot easier if we just have an one honest conversation with god will get you so far just sit there and say lord i am sick and tired of this i'm sick and tired of feeling this way looking this way whatever it might be i'm sick and tired of it and i need your grace to come in and change the situation in my life amen otherwise what remember we talked about religious spirits last time i was talking to somebody afterwards and and i i feel i didn't quite give it the full summary and here it is you know what a religious spirit is concerned about two things what the outside looked like and what other people are doing you know what the holy spirit is concerned with what the inside looks like and what i'm doing so guess what if i've got a religious spirit all i'm going to look at is brother bob and how people perceive me i've got the holy spirit that all i'm going to be doing is looking at me in the mirror of god's word and i'm going to be looking for my attitude and my spirit inside of me to be right regardless of what the outside expresses amen because guess what the only person that knows my attitude inside is me guess what it ain't always pretty it ain't always pretty when i talk about skeptical and cynical that's something jonathan corlett has dealt with all of his life right so what i've got to get that and i've got to take to god and say that is not helping me it's hindering me will you take it away and guess you know what feeds it when i feed on the right things and when i feed on the wrong things guess what cynicism comes up you get prickly these different things right but if i feed it right it'll go away because god i'm giving god something to work with that's what i'm doing amen remember brother says you just gotta drink drink drink drink from what caused you to grow in the first place keep drinking that and it'll do the work in you amen otherwise you know what it is jesus called the pharisees white and sepulchers he says you are perfect on the outside you're whitewashed you're clean everything looks great but he says inside is just rotting corpses right that's what a religious spirit does to us it makes us look good but we're horrible on the inside amen but for the faithful believer all they care about is one thing let the word be born and grow and express itself in my life and that's all i care about that is all i care about ephesians 1 says this having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us acceptable in the beloved so there's nothing in here that reflects my gifts my talents my my my carnality my body my looks my anything nothing here it says we are what it is the good pleasure of his will that's doing this and what we're doing is to the praise of the glory of his grace everything i'm doing not to point back to the grace of god not to jonathan corlett everything ought to point back to the grace of god in our lives amen amen so if you say you have faith it ought to bring praise and glory to god and his grace amen that's where it will point to every time because it's not your faith it's the faith that god gave you in the first place amen if you want faith let me put it this way if you want faith look for something that'll bring praise and glory to god amen right because that's what the faith is for it's to bring praise and glory to god not to yourself amen brother braham says there's many promises in here that my faith is not strong enough to produce it that's a man that did the works of jesus christ and he says there's still things in here that i can't do but i'll never stand in somebody else's way who have faith enough to do it i may not never shout down a wall like joshua or i might never not never take an evening walk like enoch did and go home with him without dying i may not be able to do that but i'll never stand in somebody else's way that's got faith enough to do it that's one thing yes sir now catch this he says as long as you're trying to do something to help people and glorify god coming from this bible he says what there's a word basis for it i'm thanking god for the old time holy spirit salvation and the power of god returning back to the church again amen amen we're working to answer that question how do i get faith or how do i get more faith or how do i let it work in my life and i want to end with just a couple of quotes here as we close it down he said after jesus rose from the dead his words were constantly fear not that's what the trouble with the church today is scared to death you're going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in christ you can't fail you've got everlasting life all demons in hell can't shake you you got everlasting life jesus said so so don't be scared of failure you say well i'm afraid i'll get fanatic i don't think we have that problem here because what we're faithful we are fanatics right brother brother bob we go to mass twice a week right as his neighbors say he's a fanatic he's a fanatic guess what our sisters with their beautiful hair and their long flowing dresses they're fanatics we give 10 plus of our money every month to the unseen god to pay for fallen men to get up here and preach the word to us okay we're fanatics already if you don't think you are you already are right brother chad we shot him praise don't we brother chad's a fanatic brother ellie you are definitely a fanatic amen brother gerald 100 infinite we're fanatics half of us have lost family relations because we're such fanatics amen so i don't believe we're worried about fanatics but he says what a fanatic that what will take god and step out on his word keep going in your fanaticism can i tell you to do that keep being fanatical about the promises of the word of god i want to be a fanatical person amen we have these sports teams and people are fans that means they're fanatical about it can you imagine being caught up in a team so badly that you get up there and scream and shout and holler and hoot and dance and yet you serve the very living eternal god and we can't shoot we can shoot shout and holler and dance amen we're fanatical we ought to be fanatical about these things he says but what i'd rather have a little fanaticism than to sit still and do nothing i sure would like a lump on a like a bump on a log in the bottom of the sea sit there and do nothing rotting away man so how do you let faith work in you he says what cast out fear don't worry don't fret don't dwell on the circumstances he says ask that your joy may be full sometimes our problem is we won't even ask we're so scared he won't do it that we don't even ask he says ask that your joy may be full he says when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that god says in his word is for you to do so each of us has a thing to do and guess what it's not going to look the same for sister priscilla as it is for sister maureen it's not going to look the same for brother josh as it is for brother chad but as god points to the word your thing to do then do it and be fanatical about it be fanatical about doing what god has called you to do amen but make sure it's based on the word of god that's what he keeps pointing us back to he says in everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it wow that's right that's right and and all this time you certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit that tells you who put that desire in you is that is your desire bringing out the fruit of the spirit or is it bringing out what frustration anger disappointment all these things amen you gotta look for the fruit of the spirit to come out of what you're getting while you're holding on to the promise waiting for god to come out of you amen amen a believer is known by what believing faith holding on to the promises of god whether it's abraham for 25 years and yet died have he not received the city for which he searched he got the promise of the son but he didn't get to see you know multiply by multiply to to the sands of the sea but he still believed and he acted on today man that's what a believer is known by acting on the promises of god amen doesn't mean that you have to always sit and yell and cry and shout no there's a rest that comes with these different things amen you don't have to lay on your bed till god brings it and then you can move forward in faith believing that he's he's what he's heard your cry the master has heard your cry amen and what even if he comes on the fourth day and it's way too late and corruption's already set in you know whether it's looking to our kids that need salvation whether it's looking for healing in our body whether it's
