[39:38] before the foundation of the world.
[39:40] Lord, before we could do right or wrong,
[39:42] before we could accept or reject, Lord,
[39:44] you wrote us into victory. Lord, we are
[39:46] so thankful this evening to be in this
[39:48] place of privilege, Lord, that we can
[39:50] count ourselves among the chosen, the
[39:52] elect, the ordained under eternal life.
[39:55] But Lord, we've got to walk through this
[39:57] valley of time. We've got to walk
[39:58] through this veil of flesh for a while.
[40:00] And Lord, that's where we need your
[40:02] faith to make this word into sight. And
[40:04] so Lord, we're asking you to lift our
[40:06] faith this evening, Lord. That as we
[40:08] read your word, Lord, that you would
[40:09] just come in and inhabit it, Lord. That
[40:11] you would just raise us a little higher
[40:13] this evening, Lord. that you would
[40:14] quicken us a little more. Lord, draw us
[40:16] away from this world and settle us in
[40:18] your word this night. We pray. Lord,
[40:21] bless us each one we ask. Lord, speak to
[40:23] your people. We pray. In Jesus Christ's
[40:25] name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[40:29] you this evening. Amen. What a beautiful
[40:31] day it's been. Amen. It's a good time to
[40:33] come in and and listen to the word and
[40:35] just spend time in the presence of God.
[40:38] Amen. But I've certainly been enjoying
[40:39] the warmer weather and the sunshine.
[40:41] Amen. It's good to see my brother,
[40:42] Brother Nate, and my sister-in-law,
[40:44] Sister Melissa, here. Amen. God bless
[40:46] you. Good to see you in the service. And
[40:48] then we've got Brother Lloyd and Sister
[40:49] May I see at the back. It's been many
[40:50] years since I've seen them, but God
[40:52] bless you. It's good to see you here as
[40:54] well tonight. Want to thank brother Chad
[40:56] and the Clintar family for working on
[40:58] the lawns. And you can see he's doing
[41:00] some work on the pavement and the curbs
[41:02] and these things. And sure appreciate
[41:04] that, Brother Chad. All the hard work
[41:06] you put into making things look good.
[41:08] Amen. It's a body. It's a body. We've
[41:10] all got things we contribute and and I
[41:12] sure appreciate it when people just do
[41:14] it. You don't have to ask them. You
[41:15] don't have to push them. They just do
[41:17] it. So, I appreciate Brother Chad and
[41:18] the family and his business taking care
[41:20] of that. Amen. Familiar scripture we've
[41:23] been preaching from here for a while now
[41:24] in 1 John 4:18 says, "There is no fear
[41:27] in love, but perfect love casteth out
[41:29] fear because fear had torment. He that
[41:32] fearth is not made perfect in love. And
[41:35] we love him because he first loved us."
[41:38] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[41:40] seats this evening. We're continuing our
[41:42] series on the token life, on the life of
[41:43] the Holy Spirit in us. And again, this
[41:46] thought of no room for fear. And maybe
[41:48] this is the last service on this. I
[41:49] don't know. But really, we're preaching
[41:51] on the perfect love portion today. And
[41:53] last service we spoke on Romans 8:28
[41:56] where it says that all things work
[41:57] together for good to them that love God
[42:00] and to them who are the called according
[42:02] to his purpose. Amen. It's for the ones
[42:04] that God called, not just the ones that
[42:06] say they love him. That's one of the
[42:08] greatest deceptions today is you got a
[42:10] lot of people saying they love him, they
[42:11] serve him, they're about his will. But
[42:13] this is for those who are called of him.
[42:14] It's for the ordained. It's for the
[42:16] elect. Amen. And it's that elective love
[42:18] of God that holds us. It's that elective
[42:20] love that anchors us, that strengthens
[42:22] us, that assures us. Because as I was
[42:24] saying even in my prayer that it is not
[42:26] me that chose him, but it's him that
[42:28] chose me. And all we did was we
[42:30] responded to the call of God in our
[42:31] life. That's all we can claim this
[42:33] evening. Amen. And it's not going to be
[42:35] our feelings that hold us. It's not
[42:36] going to be visions. It's not going to
[42:38] be gifts. Scripture says all those
[42:39] things will pass away. They'll fail.
[42:41] They'll fall away. But there'll be one
[42:43] thing that holds us. And that's the love
[42:44] of God. And it'll be because he shed it
[42:46] abroad in our hearts by his spirit. As
[42:48] we read last service. Amen. It's not
[42:50] what we see. There's going to be times
[42:52] where we can't see. There's times,
[42:54] remember, when even the prophet's
[42:56] vision, remember when the the the
[42:58] Shounomite woman went and he and she's
[43:00] riding towards him and he says, "God has
[43:03] hid this thing from me. Nobody gets to
[43:05] see everything. This is a walk of faith,
[43:07] not a walk of sight. Amen. And so, we've
[43:09] got to be able to to rest in something
[43:11] beyond what we can see or sense with
[43:14] these five senses. Amen. Our security is
[43:16] in one thing. Paul said this to Timothy.
[43:18] He says, "Nevertheless, the foundation
[43:21] of God standth assure, having this seal,
[43:24] the Lord knoweth them that are his."
[43:27] Amen. The Lord knoweth them that are
[43:29] his. Jesus said it this way. He said,
[43:30] "You've not chosen me, but I have chosen
[43:34] you and ordained you." That word
[43:37] ordained means I have established or
[43:39] appointed. So, it means that God has set
[43:42] something in stone because it's through
[43:45] his word. Amen. There's something that
[43:47] cannot be changed about you and I. And
[43:49] watch what he says. He says, "I've
[43:50] chosen you that can't be changed. And
[43:53] then I've ordained you for one thing."
[43:55] He says, "That you should go forth and
[43:58] bring forth fruit. Now, there's two
[44:01] kinds of fruit. There's eternal and
[44:04] there's temporal. And he tells us your
[44:06] fruit. He says, "I've ordained you that
[44:08] you should bring forth fruit, but it's
[44:10] fruit that should remain." He says that
[44:12] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[44:14] in my name, he may give it to you. Amen.
[44:18] He's given us something. He's ordained
[44:19] us to something that won't fail, that
[44:21] won't rot, that won't stop. Amen. It's
[44:24] something that's tied to him. It's from
[44:26] him. And there therefore, it can never
[44:28] fail. Amen. God chose us in Christ
[44:31] before the foundation of the world. As
[44:33] Eve came out of Adam, so we were in
[44:35] Christ before the foundation of the
[44:37] world. And therefore, he has called us.
[44:39] He has chosen us. He has taken us out of
[44:42] his side. And now we're produced today
[44:44] to be his exact flesh today in this
[44:46] earth. That's what he's called us to
[44:48] today. Amen. This is not my work. This
[44:50] is his work. This is not my call. It's
[44:52] his call. I'm just responding to
[44:54] something that he did already. Brother
[44:57] Brian would say this. He says, "Our
[44:58] foundation stands sure." God laid in
[45:01] Zion the
[45:02] cornerstone. There we are. He says, "We
[45:05] can't slip. We can't slide. We can't
[45:08] move. Then we come into the door through
[45:10] Christ put on here." He says, "Oh, we
[45:13] may have our ups and downs
[45:16] along. We may have our ups and downs
[45:18] along." That's true enough. Sicknesses
[45:21] and troubles. He says, "But remember,
[45:23] there's a great company of angels all
[45:26] along the road to bear thee up at any
[45:29] time." He says, "Taking you up when you
[45:33] fall." Oh, I'm never going to fall,
[45:34] Brother John. No, you're going to fall.
[45:36] But that's why he has a mighty cloud of
[45:38] angels of witnesses around you to lift
[45:41] you up when you fall. That's why we need
[45:43] them is because we're going to fall.
[45:45] We're going to stub our toe. We're going
[45:47] to get off the path. But he's got
[45:49] somebody there to bring us back to his
[45:51] word.
[45:52] always. Amen. We need these things. He
[45:54] says, "Oh yes, he's there. He promised
[45:56] it and he had to make a way of it." But
[45:59] a man would say, "The Christian has not
[46:02] one worry in the world." Do we have
[46:05] worries this evening? Sure we do. But we
[46:09] ought not to. We ought not to. He says
[46:12] they should be the most free, the
[46:14] happiest people in all the world. He
[46:16] says, "You can't lose." Man, I like
[46:19] that. I'll take the You can't lose.
[46:21] Listen, we're about to start the Stanley
[46:23] Cup tonight. For those of you that don't
[46:24] know, the greatest hockey league in the
[46:26] world, the championship for this for for
[46:28] the for all the bananas is tonight. Can
[46:31] you imagine going in knowing you can't
[46:33] lose?
[46:35] How would you play if you get down three
[46:39] games to nothing in a best of seven
[46:41] series and you know you can't lose? How
[46:43] are you going into game four? We've been
[46:45] made more than conquerors. church,
[46:47] you're on the winning side this evening.
[46:50] That's why we have these ups and downs,
[46:52] but we trying to get our perspective to
[46:54] look in the big picture. You can't lose.
[46:57] You've already won. You're just walking
[46:59] through the veil of tears and flesh and
[47:02] hardship and five senses of this flesh.
[47:04] But you can't lose. It doesn't matter
[47:06] what you feel. Doesn't matter what you
[47:08] see. Doesn't matter what you can't see.
[47:10] You can't lose. And he says, "And all
[47:13] things work together for good to them
[47:15] that love God." So, how can we
[47:17] lose? Oh, you catch that. I didn't
[47:21] underline it. He says, "What? That all
[47:24] things work for good." Oh, it doesn't
[47:26] feel good, Brother John. It doesn't look
[47:27] good. I lost money. I lost family. I
[47:29] lost friends. I lost influence. I lost
[47:32] opportunity. You think you lost, but all
[47:34] things work together for good. You
[47:36] cannot lose. You cannot lose. He says,
[47:38] "There's just nothing to lose, is there?
[47:40] We're just anchored away in Jesus
[47:42] Christ, going home to glory, having a
[47:45] good time while we're going along, God
[47:48] providing everything for us. See, when
[47:51] we can step back into the eternal
[47:53] viewpoint, that's when faith can rise
[47:55] up. Amen. We talked about this last time
[47:57] that Satan is a master of turning mole
[48:00] hills into mountains. He takes every
[48:02] bump, every interruption, every uh
[48:05] failed plan, every failed believer,
[48:07] every drop that hits us, and he we just
[48:10] think, "Oh, it's such a big deal." And
[48:11] he magnifies it in our lives. Amen. And
[48:14] he's trying to get us to look right here
[48:16] and now to keep our eyes from looking at
[48:18] eternity. To look where we came from, to
[48:21] look where we're going and say, "Listen,
[48:23] this matters not. I can't lose." That's
[48:26] what God's trying to get us to do.
[48:28] Satan's trying to get us to look at
[48:29] circumstances, to see what our five
[48:31] senses declare, to see what other people
[48:34] are doing, to see what other people are
[48:35] saying. And God's just trying to say,
[48:37] "Look to my promises, and don't worry
[48:39] about the rest." That's what he's trying
[48:41] to get us to do. And so, we come into
[48:43] this idea of perfect love. And this idea
[48:46] of perfect love is so elusive to us
[48:48] because we're surrounded by things that
[48:50] cause fear. Fear is all about the five
[48:53] inner senses and the five outer senses.
[48:55] See, fear takes what we can see, feel,
[48:57] hear, taste, touch and then it runs it
[49:00] through these five inner senses of
[49:02] memory and conscience and all these
[49:03] different things and it comes up with a
[49:05] picture and it is a completely
[49:08] fabricated
[49:10] picture. But see, we think it's rooted
[49:12] in reality. But remember, Brother Bram
[49:14] says there's angels around that you
[49:16] can't see. There's powers around that
[49:18] you can't see. There's things going on
[49:20] that you can't see. Daniel is there and
[49:22] he's praying week after week and he's
[49:25] saying, "God, where are you? God, where
[49:27] are you?" And the angel comes out and
[49:28] says, "I was on the way since you
[49:30] started speaking. I was on the way." But
[49:32] things were held up. Why? Because
[49:34] there's battles going on around us.
[49:36] There's influences that are fighting.
[49:38] But it doesn't mean nothing's happening.
[49:40] It just means you haven't seen the end
[49:41] result yet. That's what he's trying to
[49:44] get us to see in these things. Amen.
[49:46] Fear is all about this dimension, but
[49:48] perfect love surrounds all of this. See,
[49:50] you're surrounded by perfect love.
[49:52] You're wrapped in the love of God. And
[49:54] everything that's inside that can't win
[49:56] the victory because you're surrounded in
[49:57] perfect love. That is the dominating
[49:59] force in our life is the love of God.
[50:02] Amen. We love him because he first loved
[50:04] us. That elective love that holds us day
[50:07] in and day out. Amen. So what does it
[50:09] take? It takes faith. It takes a
[50:10] revelation to see perfect love in
[50:12] situations that seem like it's only
[50:14] fear.
[50:16] Remember, we read last service how fear
[50:18] came first in Genesis by believing a lie
[50:21] of Satan. And we spoke how fear is not
[50:24] of God. Fear is never of God. We're
[50:26] talking about that fear that keeps you
[50:27] out of church, that keeps you from
[50:29] praying, that keeps you from repenting,
[50:30] that keeps you from fellowship. That
[50:31] ain't of God. If you're scared of that,
[50:34] that's Satan all the way. That has
[50:36] nothing to do with God. Amen. But that
[50:38] fear took Adam and Eve out of the
[50:40] presence of God, and it brought them to
[50:41] shame, and it caused them to hide
[50:43] themselves from his presence.
[50:45] And in every situation, that's what
[50:47] Satan's trying to do. Keep us out of the
[50:49] presence of God. He doesn't want you
[50:51] there. He doesn't want you there. And
[50:53] so, what does he do? He tries to get you
[50:56] to believe what he tells
[50:57] you. Curiously enough, that's exactly
[51:00] what God's trying to do. God's trying to
[51:02] get you to believe what he tells you by
[51:03] his word. And Satan's there to try and
[51:05] get you to believe what he says. That is
[51:08] 99% what God says half the time. It's so
[51:12] close. It's so close. just to twist you
[51:14] a little bit so that the word loses its
[51:16] power. Amen. But if he if we we've got
[51:19] to make a
[51:20] decision, we've got to make a decision.
[51:22] What am I going to look at tonight? What
[51:24] am I going to dwell on? Am I going to
[51:26] dwell on the
[51:28] past? If you're going to dwell on the
[51:30] past, make sure you go far enough back.
[51:33] Come on now. Make sure you go back to
[51:36] before you did right or wrong when he
[51:37] chose you. Don't look at what you did
[51:39] yesterday. Look what God did before you
[51:41] did what you did yesterday. And if
[51:43] you're looking tomorrow at your faults
[51:45] and failures that are no doubt going to
[51:47] happen, look beyond that through the
[51:49] blood of Jesus Christ and see that you
[51:51] are already with him in heavenly places.
[51:54] Amen. Look where God takes you, not
[51:56] where Satan points you at this evening.
[51:58] Amen. But if fear gets a hold, look
[52:01] out. Fear is powerful. Let's not pretend
[52:04] otherwise. Love is more powerful, but
[52:07] fear is right behind it. Brother Brown
[52:10] would say this. He says after through
[52:11] the services of this week trying to show
[52:14] people that there's no need of being
[52:15] scared, he says the worst thing the
[52:17] devil can put upon you is fear. He says
[52:20] if you even had a cancer and didn't fear
[52:22] and believe God would heal you, he says
[52:24] you wouldn't be in too bad a shape. God
[52:26] will take care of that. If you were
[52:27] sick, whatever it is, if you didn't
[52:29] fear, he says so fear is one of the
[52:31] worst things get that Satan can place
[52:34] upon the person. Why is he saying that?
[52:36] It's because fear pushes away faith.
[52:40] Remember what we said? It can't exist at
[52:43] the same time. It's like hot and cold.
[52:45] You can't be hot and cold at the same
[52:46] time. You can be one and then the other,
[52:48] but you can't be hot and cold
[52:49] simultaneously. And you can't have fear
[52:51] and have faith simultaneously. You can't
[52:54] be in perfect love and have fear at the
[52:55] same time. You just can't be there.
[52:57] Amen. Fear opposes faith. Now, we can
[53:01] act
[53:02] confident, but when somebody calls your
[53:04] bluff, when you're only acting
[53:05] confident, what happens? You back down.
[53:08] And we find out that I was just acting
[53:10] confident. I wasn't truly confident
[53:12] because I backed away at the critical
[53:13] moment. Brother Bam says, "Fear is worse
[53:15] than what you have in the first
[53:17] place." Why? Because fear is up
[53:21] here. Now, those of you that have ever
[53:25] looked
[53:26] at the way that fear
[53:29] works, fear feeds the rest of your body.
[53:34] And so when you're scared, let's say
[53:36] you've got a disease, let's say you got
[53:38] cancer or something like that, fear will
[53:40] feed that situation. It'll feed that
[53:43] issue. It'll feed that sickness. Amen.
[53:46] It strengthens the problem. That's what
[53:47] fear does. And what happens? You say,
[53:51] "Sister Brandon, I'm not picking on you
[53:52] tonight. Cancer is what brother Brandon
[53:54] brought up. So I'm going to use cancer."
[53:55] He says, "Now, if you have faith that
[53:58] God will heal you, he says, it's not
[53:59] that big deal about that cancer. God
[54:00] will take care of it. But what happens
[54:02] if you're scared of that
[54:03] cancer? What happens is you start to
[54:06] fear. And at with fear comes worry,
[54:08] comes anxiety. And then pretty soon
[54:10] you're not sleeping very well. And when
[54:12] you're not sleeping very well, then your
[54:14] body starts to what? Break down. Pretty
[54:16] soon your immune system starts to break
[54:18] down. And what happens? Your fear starts
[54:20] to literally manifest in your flesh
[54:22] because that disease starts to get
[54:24] stronger rather than get weaker. Whereas
[54:27] faith would do what? Faith would say,
[54:30] "He's the Lord that heals all my
[54:31] diseases. By his stripes, I am healed
[54:34] and you start you sleep well and you eat
[54:37] well and there's a peace and arrest and
[54:39] so your body just is working right
[54:41] along. Nothing rises up and then God can
[54:43] come behind and heal it. That fear
[54:45] literally manifests itself." Amen. What
[54:48] was a mental conception becomes a
[54:50] physical reality, a physical
[54:52] manifestation in your body. Brother B
[54:54] will point to this scripture in Job
[54:55] where he says, "For the thing which I
[54:57] greatly feared is come upon me and that
[54:59] which I was afraid of is come upon me."
[55:01] He says, "I was not in safety, neither
[55:03] had I rest, neither was I quiet, yet
[55:05] trouble came." If you look at the
[55:06] amplified, it says, uh, even though I
[55:08] was safe, I wasn't truly safe. And even
[55:11] though I was at rest, I wasn't truly at
[55:12] rest. And even though I was quiet, I
[55:14] wasn't truly quiet. Why? There was
[55:16] something working on the inside. And it
[55:18] produced what he was talking about.
[55:20] Brother Ram says in the book of Job, it
[55:21] says here that Job feared and what he
[55:23] feared it actually happened. What
[55:25] brought it? His fear. That's what made
[55:27] it happen. His faith would have kept him
[55:29] from it, but his fear brought him to it.
[55:32] Amen. Fear does this. Says you can come
[55:35] in. Faith says get
[55:38] out. Very simple. He says he was scared
[55:41] it was going to happen and it did
[55:43] happen. He says now if he knew it
[55:45] wouldn't happen, it wouldn't happen. So
[55:47] fear is believing something bad's going
[55:49] to happen. Faith is believing that
[55:51] something good is going to happen. He
[55:53] says if you're afraid when you come by
[55:55] the prayer line, maybe I just haven't
[55:57] got the faith sufficient. He says it'll
[55:59] never happen. Don't worry. See, but if
[56:01] you just know it's going to happen,
[56:03] it'll happen. See, it's a substance of
[56:05] something. We could say it this way that
[56:07] fear is just a negative
[56:09] faith. It's a negative faith. It's
[56:12] believing in the wrong thing, but it's a
[56:13] faith of sorts. It's just not according
[56:15] to the word. He says, "Job had a fear
[56:17] that these things would come upon him,
[56:19] and they did. And if you have a fear
[56:21] that your disease won't leave you, it
[56:22] won't." He says, "But if you have a
[56:24] faith that it will." See, we can sit
[56:26] around all day and we can get worried
[56:28] and anxious and we can wonder and we can
[56:30] look things up and we can look at what
[56:32] happened to other people and we can
[56:33] dwell and we can dwell and we can dwell
[56:35] and what do we do? We we we stir up a
[56:37] storm in our life. You know, I know
[56:39] people that have taken a simple little
[56:41] thing and they went on Google and by the
[56:44] time they were done, they had three days
[56:45] to live up here. Up here. Now, we laugh
[56:49] and smile and I'm glad we do. But don't
[56:52] we do that
[56:53] sometime? Situations at work, situations
[56:56] in our finances, situations in our
[56:58] churches, situations in our families,
[57:00] situations in our marriages, in our
[57:02] bodies, all these things. And what do we
[57:04] do? We think what if? What if? What if?
[57:06] And the what if almost never goes to
[57:08] what if God's word is
[57:10] true because that's Satan's job. He's
[57:13] good at what he does. It's breaking us
[57:14] down so we won't look at the word of
[57:16] God. Amen. And so you get people that
[57:19] take a little lump on their arm and they
[57:22] turn it into stage 12 lymph cancer and
[57:26] they've got a week to live and the next
[57:29] day it's gone. But for a day they're
[57:32] they're they're absolutely uh convinced
[57:34] they're going to die. Why? because they
[57:36] spend so much time looking at what it
[57:38] could be rather than at the word that
[57:40] says it doesn't matter. I am the Lord
[57:41] that health all thy diseases. You know,
[57:44] I mentioned a few services ago that
[57:46] after having dealt with my eye issue for
[57:49] 6 months, I was finally booked for
[57:50] surgery and I was just so happy. It was
[57:53] just so big and lumpy. But I knew that
[57:55] things were going to get better, you
[57:56] know, and I finally might get back to
[57:58] looking normal and get back to not
[58:00] having to wear glasses all the time, be
[58:01] able to play ice hockey and wear
[58:04] sunglasses, you know, just in case the
[58:06] sun came out. And I was in a rejoicing
[58:08] mood. I was in a rejoicing mood. And you
[58:10] know what Satan did? Satan tried to rain
[58:12] on my parade. Absolutely did. So for
[58:15] those 10 days between my my booking be
[58:18] made and the actual surgery go Satan was
[58:20] going after me. He was saying, "Look,
[58:22] you looked, you see these people that
[58:24] have to go get cosmetic surgery
[58:25] afterwards because their eyelid doesn't
[58:27] go back to its original shape. You're
[58:29] going to have a droopy eyelid. You're
[58:31] going to get reinfected. It may not go
[58:33] the way you want. You may have to get
[58:34] two surgeries on it." And what's he
[58:35] doing? He's trying to rain on my parade.
[58:37] He's trying to take away my joy that
[58:39] this trial is coming to an end. And he's
[58:41] working. And he's working. And he's
[58:43] working. And you know what I said,
[58:44] church? I had to listen to my own
[58:46] preaching. I had to say, "I am the
[58:48] Lord." I had to quote what he said. I am
[58:51] the Lord that health all thy diseases. I
[58:54] have to say that church. I don't get to
[58:56] preach up here and then you guys have to
[58:58] do it. I've got to put this into action.
[59:00] I've got to fight the same battles that
[59:01] you do. Amen. And so why why is Satan
[59:05] digging in so hard? Because he knows
[59:07] that if he can get you to doubt, then
[59:09] he's got a door to walk through and he
[59:12] can start to magnify things. Amen. When
[59:14] we he destroys our faith through fear,
[59:16] then we start to get weak. And then he
[59:18] moves into our life. He moves into our
[59:19] head space and pretty soon we don't know
[59:21] which way is up or down.
[59:24] But church, I wanted to flip the script
[59:25] on him. I want to flip the script on him
[59:28] tonight. How do you flip the script? I
[59:30] want it so that he gets weaker and I get
[59:33] stronger. That's what I want. You know
[59:35] how you make Satan weaker, church? You
[59:38] testify. You testify. You repeat the
[59:40] word back to him. That's the way that
[59:43] Satan gets weaker. Amen. You know what I
[59:45] said to him? And I shared this with some
[59:47] of you. my eye the day before I went to
[59:49] the doctor started to
[59:50] drain. And when I went into him the next
[59:53] day to the surgeon to look at it, he
[59:55] said, "Now that is big." He says, "I
[59:57] don't know if I'm going to be able to do
[1:00:00] that through the the standard way of
[1:00:01] doing surgery." He says, "I might have
[1:00:02] to go into the front, which leads to
[1:00:04] scars. It doesn't heal as quickly. These
[1:00:05] different things, it's not as
[1:00:06] protected." I said, "Well, it's starting
[1:00:08] to drain." He said, "Good." He says,
[1:00:10] "Maybe by the time you get to surgery,
[1:00:12] it'll be small enough where I can do
[1:00:13] it." And guess what, church? I latched
[1:00:15] on to that and I told Satan, I said,
[1:00:16] "See, God's already making way for me to
[1:00:19] get a total healing." I spoke of the
[1:00:21] things that were good. Rather than
[1:00:23] focusing on the surgeon, say, "Now, I
[1:00:25] might have to do it the hard way and you
[1:00:26] might have scars and a more difficult
[1:00:28] healing." I said, "No, no, no. God's
[1:00:30] already moving."
[1:00:32] That's the way we've got to go. We got
[1:00:33] to take what agrees with the word and
[1:00:35] throw everything else away.
[1:00:38] Amen, church. We got to get to the place
[1:00:40] where we can testify before we see.
[1:00:44] before we have before the work's done,
[1:00:46] we've got to be able to go in and say,
[1:00:48] "Listen, it's already done. He's my
[1:00:51] healer. Before I'm ever healed, he's my
[1:00:53] healer." Amen. And I said, "God's moving
[1:00:56] and I'm trusting him." Then I come out
[1:00:57] of surgery, and I said this before came
[1:00:59] out of surgery and my wife looked at me
[1:01:01] in
[1:01:02] horror because yes, the the the big lump
[1:01:05] was gone, but there was blood streaming
[1:01:07] down my face, bloody tears. My eyelid
[1:01:10] was all stretched out and droopy. I
[1:01:11] didn't have a whole lot of control. It
[1:01:13] was still very numb. Felt like I'd had
[1:01:14] needles jammed in my eyeballs from
[1:01:16] having these bright surgery lights in my
[1:01:18] eyes the whole time. You can't close
[1:01:20] them. Everything's just stretched and
[1:01:22] pulled. It's like having birth through
[1:01:24] my eye
[1:01:25] socket. Didn't feel very
[1:01:28] good, you know. But I went in trusting
[1:01:32] that as God had given me grace to get
[1:01:34] that surgery like that. He didn't give
[1:01:36] me surgery like that so he could just
[1:01:38] let me lay on a bed for another six
[1:01:40] months saying woe is
[1:01:43] me. Amen. Church, every trial has to
[1:01:46] come to an end. And I went insane. My
[1:01:48] end's here. My end's here. That's what
[1:01:51] we're supposed to do. We're supposed to
[1:01:53] testify, "My end is on its way." Amen.
[1:01:57] But you come out and it doesn't look
[1:01:58] like it. But remember, I focused on the
[1:02:01] positive and and the surgeon said it
[1:02:03] went better than expected. He says, "As
[1:02:04] best I can tell, I got everything out of
[1:02:06] it." Praise the Lord. But what I didn't
[1:02:09] tell you, because it's a negative
[1:02:10] testimony, he says, "Now I'm worried
[1:02:12] about how swollen it is." He says, "I'll
[1:02:14] set up an appointment. We may have to go
[1:02:16] in a second time." I didn't repeat that.
[1:02:20] I said, "It went better than
[1:02:22] expected." Cuz that's what faith says.
[1:02:25] That's what the word says is, "I am the
[1:02:27] Lord that health thy diseases." Amen.
[1:02:29] Let's let our testimony match what the
[1:02:31] word says. and only
[1:02:34] that. And guess what? It's going back
[1:02:36] and back and back. First day
[1:02:39] miserable, swollen, couldn't move it
[1:02:41] around, lumpy, everything. Day two, I
[1:02:45] worked for three hours. Day three, I was
[1:02:48] back to work completely.
[1:02:49] Church, by day four, I could see this
[1:02:52] thing's almost done. And so now it's
[1:02:55] just little tiny bits that it has to go
[1:02:56] that back in. What is it? You've got to
[1:03:00] dwell on what the word tells you about
[1:03:02] your situation. Amen. Our mindset
[1:03:05] through this has to be, "Thank you,
[1:03:06] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[1:03:09] Jesus. Oh, there's still an enemy
[1:03:11] there." Doesn't matter. Thank you,
[1:03:13] Jesus. We killed half of them. There's
[1:03:15] still a third. It doesn't matter. The
[1:03:16] enem is on the run. The situation is
[1:03:18] being changed. Thank you, Jesus. We
[1:03:21] don't have a total deliverance. Doesn't
[1:03:22] matter. Thank you, Jesus. When he gives
[1:03:24] us victory, he gives us total victory.
[1:03:26] That's what we are expecting for. Amen.
[1:03:28] Listen, Abraham called those things that
[1:03:30] were as though they were not. And the
[1:03:32] scripture says, "And he considered not
[1:03:34] his dead body." That's what we got to
[1:03:37] do. That's not just That's not just
[1:03:40] playing mind games, church. We've got to
[1:03:42] focus on exactly what the word says and
[1:03:44] push everything else away and say, "I
[1:03:46] believe God." And act on it that way.
[1:03:48] Amen. I'm still thanking God. I'm so
[1:03:51] happy that in theory I could put a set
[1:03:53] of contact lenses
[1:03:54] in. I appreciate it.
[1:03:57] There's an end to every trial. Sometimes
[1:04:00] all he's waiting for is you to say,
[1:04:01] "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus."
[1:04:05] Amen. Paul and Silas sitting in the in
[1:04:07] in the prison cell. What did they sue?
[1:04:09] They started praising Jesus.
[1:04:12] And pretty soon, what happened? Chains
[1:04:15] broke. Sometimes all he's looking for is
[1:04:18] the right attitude towards him, towards
[1:04:20] his word. So all he wants is you to get
[1:04:22] the right attitude in that miserable,
[1:04:24] lumpy eyed, whatever that might be
[1:04:26] situation.
[1:04:27] Amen. I'll tell you this. I fought that
[1:04:30] because it grinds you down. It wears you
[1:04:32] down. You just say, "Lord, when is the
[1:04:34] end coming?" And that's only six months.
[1:04:37] Some of you have been dealing with
[1:04:38] things for a
[1:04:40] lifetime. Let me tell you, the end's
[1:04:42] coming.
[1:04:43] If nothing else, you got a new body on
[1:04:45] the way. Amen. Praise the
[1:04:49] Lord. Paul said this way. This is from
[1:04:51] the Amplified Bible. He says, "Do not
[1:04:52] fret or have any anxiety
[1:04:56] about
[1:04:58] anything." He says, "But in every
[1:05:02] circumstance and in everything in prayer
[1:05:05] and petition," in other words,
[1:05:07] intentionally ask, he says, "With
[1:05:10] thanksgiving, continue to make your
[1:05:13] wants known to God." Notice, we are to
[1:05:15] be without anxiety, no worry. And in
[1:05:18] prayer, we are supposed to do it with
[1:05:19] thanksgiving. What? thanking God that
[1:05:22] the answer is on the way. Even though we
[1:05:24] see nothing before the money's in the
[1:05:27] bank, before the body's healed, before
[1:05:28] the situation's resolved, we thank the
[1:05:31] Lord. We pray with thanksgiving. He said
[1:05:35] in Colossians, he says, "Let the peace
[1:05:36] of God rule in your hearts to the which
[1:05:39] also ye are called in one body, and be
[1:05:42] ye thankful." Church, if we could come
[1:05:45] to the place where we are as thankful
[1:05:46] before it happened as after, I'll tell
[1:05:49] you what, we'd have some victory here
[1:05:50] tonight. To thank the Lord that we know
[1:05:53] it's working for our good. That he's
[1:05:55] working in our life. He's working in our
[1:05:57] bodies. He's working in our situations
[1:05:59] to bring us to that expected end.
[1:06:01] Because when you can thank him when
[1:06:02] nothing is showing any difference,
[1:06:04] that's when faith has conquered fear.
[1:06:06] That's when you know you're resting
[1:06:07] under the umbrella of his love. Amen.
[1:06:09] And that's when Satan has no place to
[1:06:11] work. Because when you don't disbelieve,
[1:06:12] then fear can't come in and he's kicked
[1:06:14] out of the situation. That's what takes
[1:06:16] him out
[1:06:17] completely. But what is it that brings
[1:06:19] that faith, that testimony, that
[1:06:21] courage, that focus on the right things?
[1:06:24] It's knowing you're under the umbrella
[1:06:26] of God's perfect
[1:06:27] love. Remember what Paul said last time.
[1:06:30] He says, "The love of God is shed abroad
[1:06:31] in your hearts by one thing, the Holy
[1:06:35] Spirit." It's not a feeling, though
[1:06:38] feeling comes with it. non- emotion
[1:06:40] though emotion may come with it but it
[1:06:42] is that assurance that you have received
[1:06:44] his spirit that settles you down through
[1:06:45] all of these things that's his love is
[1:06:47] when he puts himself inside of you amen
[1:06:50] what happens then perfect love casts out
[1:06:52] fear and what comes behind that faith
[1:06:55] because there's a void now where fear
[1:06:56] was something's got to fill it and what
[1:06:58] is it what comes in after it comes in
[1:06:59] with faith brother says it this way he
[1:07:01] says what is the law of God he says is
[1:07:04] love and perfect love casts out fear
[1:07:06] love and faith are the same thing see
[1:07:08] love. Perfect love casts out all fear
[1:07:11] which gives faith. So faith fills up the
[1:07:14] void that fear left. Amen. We've got to
[1:07:16] have something to fill
[1:07:17] us. If we got an opening in our life,
[1:07:20] something's going to come fill it. Fill
[1:07:21] it with God. Fill it with faith. Fill it
[1:07:23] with love. Fill it with the good things
[1:07:25] of God. Amen. But how does that perfect
[1:07:27] love cast out fear? And what does that
[1:07:29] look like in our daily lives? That's
[1:07:31] what I want to talk a little about for
[1:07:32] the rest of this service. Amen. Now,
[1:07:35] remember that the root of fear is one
[1:07:36] thing. It's rooted in possibility, not
[1:07:39] in the word of God. It's rooted in what
[1:07:42] your mind can come up with, your senses
[1:07:44] can come up with the picture they can
[1:07:46] paint out of what you see in the
[1:07:48] natural. Fear comes from believing a
[1:07:51] lie. Amen. And what was the first lie
[1:07:52] that Satan told
[1:07:56] humanity? First lie Satan told was God's
[1:07:58] word is not true. That's what he said to
[1:08:01] Eve. She says, he said, "Are you allowed
[1:08:03] to eat of every tree in the garden?" She
[1:08:05] says, "Yes, but this one tree we're not
[1:08:06] allowed because we will surely die." And
[1:08:08] he says, "Thou shalt not surely die."
[1:08:11] What was he saying? He was saying,
[1:08:12] "God's word isn't true." And he
[1:08:14] convinced
[1:08:15] Eve that his word was not true. He got
[1:08:17] her to disbelieve when she disbelieved
[1:08:20] and she acted on her disbelief. And we
[1:08:21] know where that led. Amen. But fear
[1:08:23] originates from one thing, and that's
[1:08:25] the statement that God's word isn't true
[1:08:27] and then you believe it.
[1:08:30] But I'll tell you this, it's very rare
[1:08:32] for Satan to come up and say, "God's
[1:08:35] word isn't true." So, he turns it into
[1:08:37] other
[1:08:38] statements. I don't know about you, I've
[1:08:40] never heard Satan tell me, "God's word
[1:08:42] isn't true." Just that bluntly. But what
[1:08:44] does he say? He says, "The promises of
[1:08:47] God aren't for
[1:08:49] you." That's his way of saying it's true
[1:08:52] for everyone else, but not you.
[1:08:54] See, it's it's
[1:08:56] 99.99999% true because it's true for
[1:08:58] everyone else except you. He says the
[1:09:01] scripture doesn't mean what you think it
[1:09:03] means. He says that was for another day,
[1:09:06] but it doesn't apply today. Look at the
[1:09:09] cessationists. That was for the
[1:09:10] apostles, but it's not for you. Or it'll
[1:09:13] say, well, it's for the ministry. It's
[1:09:15] for the men. It's for the
[1:09:18] adults. See, these are all ways to say
[1:09:20] the word isn't true for you. See, he's
[1:09:23] trying to take the personal out of the
[1:09:24] word in your life. If he can leave it
[1:09:26] for everybody else, he's got you
[1:09:28] conquered. Absolutely. You're you're
[1:09:30] completely powerless. Amen. Or he will
[1:09:32] come with this doozy. He'll say, "You
[1:09:34] know how you're living. You don't
[1:09:36] deserve
[1:09:37] it." Sure. Satan's a master. He's had
[1:09:41] thousands of years to to prepare for our
[1:09:43] our battle
[1:09:44] today. Brother Bram says this. He says,
[1:09:47] "Oh, we say we have faith. We have
[1:09:49] love." He says, "But if we had love,
[1:09:51] we'd have faith, for perfect love
[1:09:52] casteth out fear." He says, "And when
[1:09:54] fear is gone, faith is perfect." And he
[1:09:57] says these words. He says, "You're
[1:09:59] scared. He won't keep his word." He
[1:10:02] says, "But I believe that he does." Why?
[1:10:05] You don't believe it's for you. You
[1:10:06] don't believe it's true. Maybe not in so
[1:10:08] many words, but your actions tell you
[1:10:10] what you really believe about the word
[1:10:12] of God. So, Satan's there to try and
[1:10:14] keep you from believing his word. And he
[1:10:16] does this through two major attacks. The
[1:10:18] first is that he attacks the
[1:10:20] word. He attacks the word. Amen. He'll
[1:10:22] convince you it isn't re real. It isn't
[1:10:24] true by logic or reason or some form of
[1:10:27] uh evidence. Amen. This is the way he
[1:10:30] goes after
[1:10:31] intellectuals. I've told some of you
[1:10:33] about that the friend of mine that's
[1:10:34] come to church a few times and you know
[1:10:36] after the seventh service he said he
[1:10:38] said you know John you're you're a man
[1:10:40] of science and education. He says and
[1:10:42] this book is mostly unproven. He says,
[1:10:44] "How in the world do you stand there and
[1:10:46] preach it like that?" I said, "Because
[1:10:48] for me, it's proven." I said, "For you,
[1:10:51] it's not." I said, "But let me repeat
[1:10:53] back to you what you've been telling me
[1:10:54] every time you come to church these
[1:10:55] seven times." You said, "Every time I
[1:10:57] come in there, you're preaching into my
[1:10:59] life." I said, "You just told me that
[1:11:01] the word discerns the thoughts and
[1:11:03] intents of your heart, and that's what
[1:11:04] it says it would
[1:11:06] do." I said, "So, you're testifying to
[1:11:08] me that this word is true. You just
[1:11:10] didn't know it." I said, 'But I believe
[1:11:13] it because it's been made a reality in
[1:11:15] my life. I met the person that wrote it.
[1:11:18] Amen. I've got a life that has been
[1:11:19] changed since this word came alive in my
[1:11:21] life. So, it's not unproven to me. It's
[1:11:24] proven. There's still things yet to be
[1:11:26] proven, but what I've accepted, it's
[1:11:29] been proven in my life. And I thank God
[1:11:31] for that. Amen. God never said, "We
[1:11:33] believe by evidence." He says, "You'll
[1:11:34] believe by faith." It doesn't mean there
[1:11:37] isn't evidence, but the evidence will
[1:11:39] never convince you. Listen, Israel
[1:11:41] walked around for a long time with the
[1:11:43] pillar of fire, the pillar of cloud,
[1:11:45] mana, shoes that didn't wear out,
[1:11:47] clothes that didn't wear out, enemies
[1:11:48] that they defeated despite having no
[1:11:50] major, no real army, and that never
[1:11:52] convinced them. And in the end, only two
[1:11:54] went in. Evidence won't work. It takes a
[1:11:56] personal revelation of Christ in your
[1:11:58] life. That's the only thing that'll do
[1:12:00] it. Amen. But Satan Satan knows how to
[1:12:03] how to play on these things. He attacks
[1:12:05] the word. He gives us timelines. See, it
[1:12:07] hasn't happened yet. Therefore, it's not
[1:12:09] true. He'll point to people that have
[1:12:11] failed, fellow believers, professing
[1:12:13] believers, amen, so-called Christians.
[1:12:15] He'll throw unanswered prayers at us and
[1:12:17] say, "See, the word doesn't work." But
[1:12:19] see, Satan is bound by time. He knows
[1:12:22] this time is short. There's a time
[1:12:25] coming where he knows it's real short,
[1:12:27] but he knows the end is coming. And so,
[1:12:29] he likes to bind us up in time. God's
[1:12:32] trying to pull us out and say, "Hey,
[1:12:33] this is an eternal work. Don't worry
[1:12:35] about what's happening here."
[1:12:37] And if he can't attack the word, if
[1:12:39] that's not successful, then he attacks
[1:12:41] you and he convinces you that it's not
[1:12:43] for you. Amen. He doesn't challenge his
[1:12:45] truth, but he challenges you and he
[1:12:47] compares you to the word and says the
[1:12:49] two don't match, therefore it's not for
[1:12:50] you. He say you don't qualify to have
[1:12:53] the word in your life this way. You know
[1:12:55] the things you do. You know the things
[1:12:57] you say. You know the things you're
[1:12:58] struggling with. Doesn't belong to
[1:13:01] you. That works real well on people with
[1:13:04] low
[1:13:05] self-esteem. That works real well on
[1:13:07] people that aren't very stable. Amen.
[1:13:10] That works real uh well on people that
[1:13:12] are very
[1:13:13] emotional because what? The ups and
[1:13:16] downs. Satan hits them on the downs. You
[1:13:18] know, Satan never hits you on the ups. I
[1:13:20] don't know if you've noticed this. Satan
[1:13:21] doesn't work when you're on the highs.
[1:13:23] He gets you when you're in the downs.
[1:13:25] Cuz he knows the highs. He's not going
[1:13:26] to get anywhere. But on the downs, he
[1:13:28] starts focusing on you. Amen. And it
[1:13:30] works really, really well when we've
[1:13:32] messed up really, really bad.
[1:13:36] like
[1:13:37] Samson, church, Samson could have prayed
[1:13:40] many years before he actually did. But
[1:13:43] he didn't. Why? He'd messed up real bad.
[1:13:47] You talk about low self-esteem. Gideon
[1:13:49] Gideon had a self-esteem problems. It
[1:13:51] took miracle after miracle to get Gideon
[1:13:53] to see God's chosen me, right? Because
[1:13:56] what? He didn't believe that he was
[1:13:57] meant to match up to what God was doing
[1:13:59] by his word.
[1:14:03] Satan tries to tell us we've crossed the
[1:14:06] line between mercy and
[1:14:09] grace. Church, let me tell you this. As
[1:14:11] long as the bride is here, there's grace
[1:14:13] available. I don't care who you are.
[1:14:16] Church, I preached on it before. That
[1:14:18] thief on the cross had spent a lifetime
[1:14:21] of bad
[1:14:22] decisions. Finally paid his just due.
[1:14:26] And a couple hours before he died, the
[1:14:29] grace of God reached down to him because
[1:14:31] he was a child of
[1:14:37] God. He spent the least amount of time
[1:14:39] in paradise of anybody there. He was the
[1:14:42] last one to die to go in. Max two days
[1:14:44] and he's out. He's resurrected with the
[1:14:46] New Testament
[1:14:48] saints. It's funny. I there's a a man I
[1:14:51] think his name is Aleister Beg. He's a
[1:14:52] he's a well-known Christian in the
[1:14:53] world. I think it was he that preached a
[1:14:56] service on it's called the man in the
[1:14:58] middle. He says, "And when that thief
[1:15:00] went up to the gates of glory, they
[1:15:01] looked and they said, "We have no record
[1:15:03] of your Christian walk." He says, "All I
[1:15:05] can tell you, all I can tell you is the
[1:15:08] man in the middle said I could go."
[1:15:12] The only good thing he did was he
[1:15:14] rebuked his fellow thief and murderer
[1:15:16] and said, "We've done wrong and we
[1:15:18] deserve it." He doesn't. That's the only
[1:15:20] thing he ever did. And yet there he
[1:15:22] stands in paradise, a child of God. A
[1:15:26] failure most of his
[1:15:29] life, virtually his entire life, church.
[1:15:32] But when given the opportunity, he stood
[1:15:35] for the word.
[1:15:38] That's what grace looks like. He said
[1:15:41] the right thing one time and it was
[1:15:44] eternal life to
[1:15:45] him. Church, I don't control grace. You
[1:15:49] don't control grace. We give up way
[1:15:51] before God gives up. Amen. Look at Saul,
[1:15:56] the
[1:15:57] persecutor. We gave I guarantee you the
[1:16:00] church gave him up a long time
[1:16:02] ago. All God saw was Paul the apostle,
[1:16:05] the prophet to the first church age.
[1:16:08] Look at Jacob the
[1:16:10] shyer. Time and time again, Jacob proved
[1:16:13] who he was. No
[1:16:16] good. But what? In a moment, God got him
[1:16:19] desperate enough and he broke him and he
[1:16:22] turned him into a prince having power
[1:16:23] with God,
[1:16:24] Israel. Amen.
[1:16:28] That woman at the well. You talk about a
[1:16:31] shameful woman, a broken life, five
[1:16:34] divorces, now living common law,
[1:16:36] compounding the
[1:16:38] problem. And she walks away
[1:16:42] testifying.
[1:16:43] Testifying her shame gone. Life
[1:16:47] situations nothing
[1:16:49] mattered. Why? Grace. Grace reached
[1:16:53] down. I must needs go by Samaria. That's
[1:16:57] it, church. Don't let grace be defined
[1:17:00] by what you
[1:17:02] say,
[1:17:06] right? Amen. Grace is it's it's
[1:17:11] unmmerited favor. That's what we have to
[1:17:13] remember. It isn't
[1:17:15] deserving. So therefore, it can work in
[1:17:18] anybody's
[1:17:20] life. Some of us think we're a little
[1:17:22] more deserving than others. We're all
[1:17:24] undeserving.
[1:17:26] Amen. It's grace that brings us there.
[1:17:28] It's up to God to determine how far that
[1:17:30] grace will go. And let me tell you, you
[1:17:32] look in the word, you see people that
[1:17:33] were way beyond what anybody thought
[1:17:35] they could do. And the grace of God
[1:17:37] reached down and plucked them
[1:17:39] out. He's my chosen vessel. He's my
[1:17:43] chosen
[1:17:44] vessel. Amen. Satan's attack is to try
[1:17:47] and get you to the place where you're
[1:17:48] scared that God won't keep his word.
[1:17:51] Whether you doubt it's true, whether you
[1:17:53] doubt it's for you, it doesn't matter.
[1:17:54] His weapon is doubt. It's unbelief to
[1:17:56] produce fear. And that's a battle of our
[1:17:58] mind. We know this. It's the greatest
[1:18:00] battle ever fought. Amen. And you can't
[1:18:02] defeat the mind with the mind. Doesn't
[1:18:04] work that way. Amen. You need a
[1:18:06] revelation in your soul to defeat what
[1:18:08] is happening in Satan in your mind. Paul
[1:18:10] would say this. He says, "For though we
[1:18:12] walk in the flesh, we do not war after
[1:18:14] the flesh. For the weapons of our
[1:18:16] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:18:18] through God." Mighty through whom? God.
[1:18:22] Ain't me going to win it. Not the
[1:18:24] strength of this hand that's going to
[1:18:25] hold it. Mighty through God to the
[1:18:28] pulling down of strongholds, casting
[1:18:30] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:18:33] that exaltth itself against the
[1:18:35] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:18:38] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:18:40] of Christ. What was the obedience of
[1:18:42] Christ? It is written. It is written. It
[1:18:44] is written. Amen. The word was subject
[1:18:47] to the word. Amen. He made himself
[1:18:49] subject to it because that's what he
[1:18:50] was. And if we come from him, we are the
[1:18:53] word made flesh, the same as he is. And
[1:18:55] so we must subject ourselves to the same
[1:18:56] thing. Paul says, "Casting down
[1:18:58] imaginations," that means casting down
[1:19:00] thoughts and ideas. That tells us where
[1:19:03] our battle is. It's in our mind. Amen.
[1:19:05] That's the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:19:06] Brother Bram told us. Now, Brother
[1:19:08] Brandham, this is in I think the message
[1:19:10] greatest battle ever fought. Yes. He
[1:19:12] He's speaking about Satan tempting
[1:19:14] Jesus. Now, listen to this. He says
[1:19:16] Jesus was the word of God and he Satan
[1:19:19] attacked the word in the beginning was
[1:19:21] the word. The word was with God. The
[1:19:22] word was God and the word was made flesh
[1:19:24] and dwelt among us. He said Jesus was
[1:19:27] the word. And what did he do? He cut him
[1:19:30] to ribbons. He says so with the word he
[1:19:32] cut Satan on his wild attack. He flew in
[1:19:35] there like a bunch of stormtroopers flew
[1:19:37] in on Jesus. The word like that. Isn't
[1:19:40] that the way it happens? See what
[1:19:42] happens is you see one person, one
[1:19:44] thought, one idea, but what happens is
[1:19:46] there's a barrage that comes behind it.
[1:19:48] You listen to that one, what happens
[1:19:50] behind is a bunch of others. I was
[1:19:52] talking to my dad uh today and uh and uh
[1:19:56] I was saying, you know, the the thing I
[1:19:58] was looking out my window downstairs.
[1:19:59] And I said, "The most the most resilient
[1:20:02] and powerful thing on this world is a
[1:20:05] dandelion because I just mowed the lawn
[1:20:08] yesterday and I look outside and they're
[1:20:10] grown three inches since yesterday."
[1:20:12] Well, they didn't really grow three
[1:20:13] inches. What they did was they they
[1:20:15] what? They ducked the blade. The blade
[1:20:17] hit them, but they got that sliminess to
[1:20:19] them where it just goes over and they
[1:20:20] spring up. And where yesterday there was
[1:20:23] none, today there are
[1:20:25] thousands. What is it? They come in like
[1:20:28] a storm of paratroopers of
[1:20:29] stormtroopers. They just what? They just
[1:20:31] come
[1:20:32] in and there went the lawn lawn. If
[1:20:37] you've seen my front lawn, you know it's
[1:20:38] a lawn. It's not an actual lawn like
[1:20:40] brother Mark would have or brother Bob.
[1:20:42] And then it's mostly clover and dust.
[1:20:45] But now it's clover and dust and mostly
[1:20:48] dandelions. But that's how he comes in.
[1:20:50] He comes in and where there was
[1:20:52] one, now there are many. And it it just
[1:20:56] feels like you're overwhelmed
[1:20:59] sometimes,
[1:21:01] right? He says, "What?" Jesus took that
[1:21:04] word and sliced him to pieces. He says,
[1:21:07] "Hallelujah. Sure." He sliced him to
[1:21:08] pieces. Defeated him with the word. He
[1:21:11] said, "See Satan's attack." His attack
[1:21:14] is what? Disbelieve God's word. That's
[1:21:16] his attack. There, can you see the
[1:21:18] greatest battle was ever fought? There
[1:21:20] are only two forces, Satan and God. And
[1:21:22] what is Satan's weapon against you? is
[1:21:25] to try to get you to disbelieve your
[1:21:29] weapon. He says he disarms you. If he
[1:21:32] can get you to disbelieve your weapon is
[1:21:35] equivalent, if he gets you to believe
[1:21:36] that your weapon is not strong enough,
[1:21:39] he has disarmed you. In other words, if
[1:21:41] he can make you think that you brought a
[1:21:42] knife to a gunfight, he
[1:21:47] wins. He says he's disarmed you when he
[1:21:49] gets you to disbelieve that weapon. When
[1:21:51] you lay that down, that finishes your
[1:21:53] fight. You're done. He says, "Hold that
[1:21:55] weapon. Don't you lay it down." But Paul
[1:21:58] told us to cast down imaginations. How
[1:22:01] do we cast down
[1:22:02] imaginations? We can't cast it down with
[1:22:05] this natural mind. We've got to take on
[1:22:06] a new mind. The mind of Christ that
[1:22:09] takes the word and says, "It is written.
[1:22:11] It is written. It is written." And that
[1:22:13] comes from a revelation in your heart,
[1:22:15] not from just listening to what the
[1:22:16] preacher said. It's got to sink down
[1:22:18] into your soul. Amen. It's got to come
[1:22:20] from a revelation that you are sealed to
[1:22:23] the day of your full redemption. That
[1:22:25] you come from God. That you are going
[1:22:27] back to God. That you are engraved in
[1:22:29] the palms of his hands. That he can't
[1:22:30] lose you. That you belong to him. That
[1:22:33] you do not belong to Satan. And
[1:22:34] therefore, Satan has no
[1:22:36] right to set up
[1:22:39] shop. That's it. The revelation has to
[1:22:43] come from your position in Christ as a
[1:22:45] son, as a daughter of God. Amen. And
[1:22:47] when you have a revelation in you of
[1:22:49] Christ, the hope of glory, it settles
[1:22:52] you down. Amen. And that's when you know
[1:22:54] that he loves you and you love him and
[1:22:56] faith rises from that.
[1:22:59] Church, Moses was taught that he was a
[1:23:01] deliverer all of his life. But it took a
[1:23:03] personal revelation by a personal
[1:23:05] experience with a burning bush with the
[1:23:08] I am that everyone had been telling him
[1:23:11] about. That's what it took. Young
[1:23:14] people, you got to know you're a child
[1:23:15] of God. Not cuz mommy tells you, not cuz
[1:23:18] daddy tells you, not cuz the preacher
[1:23:19] tells you, not cuz the pastor tells you,
[1:23:22] but because you have a experience with a
[1:23:25] living Christ that has changed your
[1:23:26] life. Cuz there's going to be one day
[1:23:28] when daddy's not here, mommy's not here,
[1:23:30] the pastor's not here, the ministry is
[1:23:32] not here, and you got to stand on your
[1:23:33] own two feet and say, "I am a child of
[1:23:35] God." And Satan, you have no right here.
[1:23:39] You've got to leave. When you can look
[1:23:42] at what you used to
[1:23:43] be and you look at where you are today
[1:23:46] and it matches up with the word, you can
[1:23:47] say, "He loves me. He loves me enough to
[1:23:50] not leave me in my condition." Amen.
[1:23:52] Amen. That that famous saying, "I'm not
[1:23:54] what I used to be. I'm not what I ought
[1:23:56] to be." No. Want to be, but thank
[1:24:00] God. However it goes. I'm not what I
[1:24:03] used to be. I'm not what
[1:24:08] I There you go. what brother Bob said,
[1:24:11] you take the mic. I mess it up every
[1:24:13] time I try this. I I just I need not do
[1:24:15] it anymore.
[1:24:17] Amen. Amen. But when you know that
[1:24:20] almighty God loves you, he loves you
[1:24:22] enough to come down and put himself
[1:24:23] inside of you. Clean up your life. Amen.
[1:24:26] Change your desires, make you walk
[1:24:29] according to his word. That ought to
[1:24:30] give you confidence. He loves me. Amen.
[1:24:32] Because I'll tell you, everybody else is
[1:24:34] trying to bend you to what? What's good
[1:24:36] for them? He's bending you to what's
[1:24:38] good for you by his word.
[1:24:42] Amen. When you know he loves you, then
[1:24:45] you can have faith in his word. And more
[1:24:47] to the point, you can have faith that
[1:24:48] his word is for
[1:24:51] you. See, faith has to become personal.
[1:24:54] When we read the great faith chapter of
[1:24:56] Hebrews 11, Abraham's faith was not for
[1:24:58] everybody else. Abraham's faith was for
[1:24:59] Abraham. It meant he had to keep himself
[1:25:02] in the word by his faith. It makes it
[1:25:05] personal. The faith that we're talking
[1:25:06] about, the perfect love, makes these
[1:25:08] things personal. Amen. Not some great
[1:25:10] sign or wonder, not some vision, not
[1:25:11] some dream, but it is a personal
[1:25:13] experience with God that he has filled
[1:25:15] you with his love by his spirit. Brother
[1:25:18] Bram says it this way. Everybody
[1:25:20] wouldn't have gifts. Jesus brought it
[1:25:22] down to a place where those who do not
[1:25:24] have
[1:25:25] gifts, that do not have very much faith,
[1:25:28] could just say, "It is written." He
[1:25:31] says, "There it is." And then stand
[1:25:33] right on that. Jesus said that the word
[1:25:35] of God is a seed that a swer swed and
[1:25:38] every word of God, every promise of God
[1:25:40] will bring forth of its kind. But what
[1:25:42] do you have to do? You have to sew it.
[1:25:45] You have to speak it. Don't just think
[1:25:47] it.
[1:25:49] Amen. It is only a thought. It is when a
[1:25:52] word is spoken that it has power. A
[1:25:55] thought is spoken, it becomes word. You
[1:25:58] got to speak to your situation. You got
[1:26:01] to speak to your flesh. Speak
[1:26:04] it. You're going to feel funny the first
[1:26:06] time you do it if you haven't done it.
[1:26:09] But you got to speak to your
[1:26:10] mountain. Notice Jesus didn't say think
[1:26:13] to your mountain. He said speak to your
[1:26:16] mountain. Speak. There's power in the
[1:26:19] spoken word when it comes in alignment
[1:26:21] with the actual word of God. He says,
[1:26:24] listen, not everyone's going to have
[1:26:27] gifts. There's a gift of faith. Not
[1:26:30] everyone's going to have that kind of a
[1:26:31] gift. Not everyone has a gift of
[1:26:33] healing, tongues, dreams,
[1:26:35] interpretation, all these things. Those
[1:26:37] are faith boosters many times. We ain't
[1:26:39] all going to have that. But he says he
[1:26:42] what he brought us to even those of us
[1:26:44] that have that don't have very much
[1:26:45] faith could say it is written and so the
[1:26:48] word by our voice and it'll produce what
[1:26:51] it said. Church, you may be the weakest
[1:26:54] Christian. Feel like you're the weakest
[1:26:55] Christian here this evening. That has
[1:26:58] not one thing to do with it. The power
[1:27:00] is not of you. The power is in the word.
[1:27:02] All you got to do is take it and put it
[1:27:04] on your lips. Amen. You might not feel
[1:27:06] like you're much of a
[1:27:08] winner, much of a fighter. But let me
[1:27:10] tell you, when he wrote your name into
[1:27:12] the Lamb's Book of Life, that's when you
[1:27:14] became a winner. You became the elite.
[1:27:18] One in a million. That's what you
[1:27:20] became. Amen. When your name was written
[1:27:22] in the Lamb's Book of Life, you are the
[1:27:24] most You are part of the most elite
[1:27:25] group that has ever walked the face of
[1:27:27] this earth. You look around today,
[1:27:30] people that are elite because of their
[1:27:32] athleticism. You look at Conor McDavid
[1:27:34] going to play for the Stanley Cup
[1:27:35] tonight. Wow. Phenomenal player. But
[1:27:39] guess what? There's a day where he's not
[1:27:41] going to have any speed. He's not going
[1:27:43] to have any hands. Hands meaning stick
[1:27:45] handling, shooting. What? He's going to
[1:27:46] get old. The
[1:27:49] glory is going to fade.
[1:27:52] people that are known for their great
[1:27:54] beauty, beautiful body, muscles,
[1:27:56] whatever it is,
[1:28:00] intellect, all these things, it fades,
[1:28:03] goes away, and they will fall out of the
[1:28:06] elite because it wasn't lasting. They
[1:28:09] themselves will lose purpose, so many of
[1:28:11] them, because they're no longer what
[1:28:12] made them
[1:28:14] important. But what you have inside of
[1:28:16] you will make you more and more rather
[1:28:18] than less and less because it's taking
[1:28:20] you to a greater than what you are
[1:28:22] today. It's taking in a greater
[1:28:24] satisfaction. Amen. But when you're the
[1:28:27] chosen of God, your looks don't matter.
[1:28:29] Praise the Lord. Droopy, lumpy eye or
[1:28:32] not, doesn't
[1:28:33] matter. Your job doesn't matter. How
[1:28:35] much money you have or don't have in the
[1:28:37] bank, what kind of vehicle you drive,
[1:28:38] how big your house
[1:28:41] is, how much you weigh, doesn't matter.
[1:28:45] Has nothing to do with it. What matters
[1:28:46] is that your name is written in the
[1:28:48] Lamb's Book of Life. It's the only thing
[1:28:49] that counts. Amen. Why? Cuz you've
[1:28:52] already made it. You're already
[1:28:54] guaranteed and you're just walking
[1:28:56] through. As I've quoted brother brother
[1:28:58] Hank Snow so many times, he says,
[1:28:59] "Listen, the video's already been shot.
[1:29:01] You just got to play the movie. You just
[1:29:03] got to walk through the script. That's
[1:29:05] all that's left to us." Amen. You're
[1:29:07] already perfected in Christ. You're
[1:29:08] already seated in heavenly places.
[1:29:10] Eternally speaking, you're already a
[1:29:12] finished work. You're just in this
[1:29:14] little dip of time. And you come out of
[1:29:17] that and it'll be as if it never
[1:29:18] happened. Every tear wiped away, no
[1:29:21] scars, nothing. Perfect
[1:29:24] rest. How do we get to that place,
[1:29:27] church? There's only one way. Take God
[1:29:31] at his
[1:29:33] word. Literally, that's all. It's almost
[1:29:36] all we ought to preach. Take God at his
[1:29:38] word. Because that's all you see
[1:29:39] throughout the Bible is take God at his
[1:29:42] word. When he tells you to do something,
[1:29:44] do it. When he says he'll do it, trust
[1:29:45] him. Act on it. And that's it. and just
[1:29:48] go forward. Take on at his word. Amen.
[1:29:51] Feed on the word of God. Hear
[1:29:53] it. Sing
[1:29:55] it. Read
[1:29:57] it. Listen to
[1:30:00] it. Repeat it
[1:30:03] back. You got to feed on it. It's the
[1:30:06] only way faith comes. It's the only way
[1:30:08] the reality comes is you got to become
[1:30:10] one with the word. We've got to get
[1:30:11] serious with it. That's for sure.
[1:30:14] Brother says it this way. He says, "And
[1:30:16] therefore," he says, "we don't look at
[1:30:17] what we see. We look at those things we
[1:30:19] do not see, but what God says in the
[1:30:21] heart." He says, "If we could pay
[1:30:23] attention to those things, how much more
[1:30:25] by divine healing, if God made the
[1:30:27] promise and it anchors in the heart,
[1:30:29] well, what good do we need
[1:30:30] intellectuality anymore?" He says, "I
[1:30:32] don't look at my affliction. I don't
[1:30:33] look at my symptoms. I look at what God
[1:30:35] said about it because after all, he is
[1:30:37] the boss and the supreme boss." He says,
[1:30:40] "Now, if you try and bluff it, it won't
[1:30:42] work. If you try and reason it in your
[1:30:44] mind, say, "Yes, God's word is right. I
[1:30:46] believe that. I believe it will come to
[1:30:47] pass. I think that." He says, "Now, if
[1:30:49] that's intellectually, you might as well
[1:30:51] just stop thinking it." But he says,
[1:30:53] "Until something comes down on the
[1:30:55] inside of you that just says it so, and
[1:30:57] that's all there is to it, there's not
[1:31:00] enough demons out of torment could ever
[1:31:01] shake it from you. There's something on
[1:31:03] the inside called the heart, and that's
[1:31:05] where real faith find its resting
[1:31:06] place." He says, "Intellectuals will try
[1:31:09] to reason about it." Now, let's just be
[1:31:11] reasonable. He says, "But faith has no
[1:31:16] reasoning." He says, "It just says one
[1:31:18] thing, and that's God's word is right."
[1:31:21] He says, "Oh, there's where the soul
[1:31:23] sets its feet and rests eternally right
[1:31:26] there, for God said so." He says, "Not a
[1:31:28] bluff, but knowing it." I think too
[1:31:31] often we know it
[1:31:33] intellectually. Why? Because we can
[1:31:35] repeat it back.
[1:31:40] If we can't repeat it, it makes me
[1:31:42] wonder if we even are a part of
[1:31:44] it. Church, we need to have a word
[1:31:46] reason for the decisions we make, the
[1:31:49] way we're living the life, the way we're
[1:31:51] spending our time, the way we're
[1:31:52] spending our money, the way we're
[1:31:54] offering our gifts and abilities. We
[1:31:56] ought to be able to go right back to the
[1:31:57] word and say, "This is why I'm doing
[1:31:59] what I'm doing
[1:32:01] today." We ought to be able to do that.
[1:32:03] Because if we don't, what are we doing?
[1:32:06] We're resting on how we feel about
[1:32:07] things and resting on the fact that
[1:32:09] we're a Christian and therefore our
[1:32:11] feelings are
[1:32:14] correct. It ain't. They're
[1:32:17] not. They're not. Your feelings may or
[1:32:20] may not be correct. You need to take
[1:32:22] your life back to the word and say,
[1:32:23] "This is why I'm doing what I'm doing."
[1:32:26] Amen.
[1:32:28] My sister Alena talks about her healing
[1:32:30] from stage four
[1:32:32] cancer and she said I had to feed on the
[1:32:35] word day and night. She said I put
[1:32:40] everything else out of my life. Why?
[1:32:44] Life got serious and so she got more
[1:32:48] serious. Listen, she's a wonderful
[1:32:51] Christian, Holy Ghostfilled woman, no
[1:32:54] doubt about it in my life. But she got
[1:32:56] more serious and she says, "I'll only
[1:32:59] feed on the thing that gives me faith
[1:33:01] and I'll put everything else
[1:33:03] aside."
[1:33:05] Amen. In her sickness, in her hardship,
[1:33:08] she turned completely to the word. And
[1:33:10] that word brought faith to her and made
[1:33:13] the word personal to her. Amen. She
[1:33:18] said, "I had to believe that it was by
[1:33:20] his stripes Atlanta butts is
[1:33:23] healed, not everyone else. It had to be
[1:33:26] a personal revelation to her. Jesus
[1:33:28] said, "We don't live by bread, by food
[1:33:31] alone." He says, "But we live by every
[1:33:33] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:33:35] God." We live by the word. It's our
[1:33:38] life. It's our sustaining portion. It's
[1:33:39] our
[1:33:40] satisfaction. He says it this way. He
[1:33:42] says, "That's the way it is with divine
[1:33:43] healing. When you see the working of the
[1:33:45] Holy Spirit, the word laid on and the
[1:33:47] Holy Spirit anointing that word and
[1:33:49] proving it that he is here in our midst
[1:33:51] to vindicate himself and to give you the
[1:33:53] promise." He says, "Then you accept your
[1:33:54] healing. If there's sin in your life,
[1:33:57] get it out. If there's condemnation, get
[1:34:00] it out. If there's doubt, get it out."
[1:34:04] What? How much? How extreme do we get,
[1:34:07] brother John? Brother Bram says, "Until
[1:34:10] you can see perfectly that it's God's
[1:34:13] will, it's God's plan, and you're
[1:34:16] included in that." and then say sickness
[1:34:20] in the name of Jesus Christ get away
[1:34:22] from me. You got to come to the place
[1:34:25] where you know it's not just true, it's
[1:34:26] true for you. It's true for me. It's
[1:34:29] personal. It's
[1:34:31] real. Question is, will we get that
[1:34:34] serious? Will we get that
[1:34:36] extreme? Let me tell you, church, it's
[1:34:38] going to take extreme Christianity to
[1:34:40] get us out of here where it's the word
[1:34:43] and nothing else. He says, remember, you
[1:34:46] might not feel any better for a week,
[1:34:49] but as soon as you said that word,
[1:34:51] something happened. God has to keep his
[1:34:53] word. That sickness shakes and he begins
[1:34:55] to turn loose. He'll go if you'll just
[1:34:57] believe it. Don't doubt. Like Peter
[1:34:59] walking on the water, he said, "Why did
[1:35:01] you doubt? Oh, ye of little faith." He
[1:35:03] says, "Just because he was sinking, that
[1:35:06] had nothing to do with it." He could
[1:35:09] have kept
[1:35:10] walking. The fact that he was sinking
[1:35:12] did not mean he was going to sink all
[1:35:14] the
[1:35:15] way. But he got his eyes on the
[1:35:17] situation instead of what Jesus told him
[1:35:19] to do.
[1:35:21] He could have stepped back up on that
[1:35:22] water if he just turned back to Christ.
[1:35:25] But he didn't. Jesus had to come grab
[1:35:27] him. He said Christ had commanded him
[1:35:30] and his word was enough. He says that's
[1:35:32] the way we should think it too. Let me
[1:35:36] ask you this. What word is keeping you
[1:35:37] alive
[1:35:39] today? What is the word that you've read
[1:35:42] that you've heard since we had service
[1:35:44] on
[1:35:45] Sunday that's keeping you alive?
[1:35:48] I hope you have more than what I gave
[1:35:50] you. Or I hope you're at least chewing
[1:35:52] on what we gave you. That's okay as
[1:35:54] well. But we've got to have something to
[1:35:57] live by. We've got to have something to
[1:35:58] breathe by. Amen. Listen, uh Instagram
[1:36:01] reels and and Facebook stories ain't
[1:36:03] going to keep you alive. Movies won't
[1:36:06] keep you alive. Other books won't keep
[1:36:08] you alive. Your job won't keep you
[1:36:10] alive. School won't keep you alive.
[1:36:13] It takes the word to keep a believer
[1:36:15] alive and strong and victorious. That's
[1:36:18] the only thing that'll work. Amen.
[1:36:20] Profitable business won't do it,
[1:36:22] brothers. You got to have Christ in your
[1:36:24] life daily feeding you by his word.
[1:36:27] That's the only thing that keeps us in
[1:36:28] his line and in his will. Amen. Why?
[1:36:31] Because otherwise we end up feeding at
[1:36:33] the wrong table and then we wonder why
[1:36:34] our Christian life suffers and why our
[1:36:36] faith is weak. It's because we've been
[1:36:38] feeding on the wrong thing or not
[1:36:42] feeding at all as the case may be. But
[1:36:45] when we've been feeding on that bread of
[1:36:47] life, when we've been focused on staying
[1:36:49] in the line of duty and our kingdom
[1:36:50] purpose about the father's business,
[1:36:52] amen, there's a confidence that comes
[1:36:55] with our day-to-day walk. There's a
[1:36:57] confidence that comes with what we're
[1:36:59] doing. Amen. Why? Because God backs up
[1:37:01] his word. He's not here to back me up.
[1:37:03] He's here to back up his word. And so, I
[1:37:04] have to find his word and stay in it.
[1:37:07] That's when I can have confidence.
[1:37:09] Amen. Brother Ram says that a man that
[1:37:11] walks in love walks in life and perfect
[1:37:14] love casts out fear. He says, "Then if
[1:37:16] you can take him at his word and not
[1:37:18] fear a bit about it, say,"Lord, I love
[1:37:20] you. I know you're going to answer
[1:37:23] because you promised me you would, and I
[1:37:25] just know you're going to do it." See,
[1:37:27] he says it takes away fear. What? If
[1:37:30] you're walking in his will, you can have
[1:37:32] perfect faith that he's going to step
[1:37:34] into your situation.
[1:37:37] So the prayer should not be Lord take it
[1:37:39] away. The question should be Lord am I
[1:37:42] in your
[1:37:43] will. Am I in the line of
[1:37:46] duty? Because remember we're ordained to
[1:37:48] good works. We're here for purpose.
[1:37:51] We're here to produce fruit that lasts.
[1:37:54] What fruit are we producing and is it
[1:37:56] lasting? That'll tell us where we're at.
[1:37:58] Remember how brother Brandham talked
[1:38:00] about he's talk you know we're talking
[1:38:02] about this idea a man that walks in love
[1:38:04] walks in life and there's no fear in it.
[1:38:06] Remember how he talked he was in his
[1:38:07] backyard he had his shirt off hot day
[1:38:10] and he was running around the yard just
[1:38:12] mowing as fast as he could mow and he
[1:38:14] knocked the fence where the hornets nest
[1:38:15] was and they came out
[1:38:19] mad. Amen. And brother Brandham said in
[1:38:22] that moment he says a love came down
[1:38:24] over me and what did he do church? Thus
[1:38:28] sayeth the Lord, you horrible hornets.
[1:38:30] Go. No. He says, "A love came over me
[1:38:35] and
[1:38:36] he
[1:38:39] apologized."
[1:38:41] Apologized. Amen. He explained to them
[1:38:45] why he was in a hurry. He was in a hurry
[1:38:47] because people were coming to be prayed
[1:38:49] for and he had so little time in his
[1:38:51] life to get stuff done. And he was just
[1:38:53] zipping around with his lawn mower. And
[1:38:55] he said, "Now I'm doing this because I'm
[1:38:57] about the Lord's
[1:38:59] business." He says, "And he says, I've
[1:39:01] got no shirt on." He says, "These things
[1:39:03] are huge. One of one of them, one sting
[1:39:05] will put a man in a hospital, right?"
[1:39:09] And what did he do? Raise his hand. I am
[1:39:11] the mighty prophet of the seventh church
[1:39:14] age. No, he
[1:39:16] apologized. What was it? It wasn't
[1:39:19] brother Brandham's love. Wasn't brother
[1:39:21] Bram's authority. It was perfect love
[1:39:24] came down. Amen. Not authoritarian love.
[1:39:29] His authority went to one thing.
[1:39:32] Settling them down and putting them back
[1:39:35] in their condition where they were at
[1:39:37] rest. It was not
[1:39:40] demanding. It was not waving his fist at
[1:39:43] them. There's not thunderbolts and
[1:39:46] lightning. It was perfect love. He
[1:39:49] didn't bind them. He loved them. Big
[1:39:53] difference. At the end of that story, he
[1:39:56] says, "What is it?" He says, "Love
[1:39:57] conquers all things. Love the Lord with
[1:39:59] all your heart, with all your soul, with
[1:40:02] all your mind, with all your strength."
[1:40:04] He says, "And faith will accompany that
[1:40:06] love." What kind of faith? Faith to do
[1:40:09] the right thing to get the right
[1:40:13] results. He wasn't there to lord his
[1:40:16] power over those hornets. They were just
[1:40:19] doing what hornets do. church. We walk
[1:40:21] around this earth and guess what? People
[1:40:22] do what people are going to do. You've
[1:40:25] got to bind them by love, not by just
[1:40:26] this
[1:40:27] authority. That's the way that God
[1:40:29] works. Amen. Then he would tell her that
[1:40:31] story. Now, he's talking about perfect
[1:40:33] love. He talks about that story where he
[1:40:36] stepped into the field where the bull
[1:40:37] had killed a man before. This was a
[1:40:39] killer bull. And once again, he's on the
[1:40:41] Lord's business. What happened was he
[1:40:43] forgot about the bull and he stepped
[1:40:44] into the field and he was halfway
[1:40:46] through. Can't get to safety and he sees
[1:40:48] the bull. But what's he doing? He's
[1:40:50] headed over to pray for somebody and he
[1:40:52] took a
[1:40:53] shortcut. And so he steps in, but he's
[1:40:55] on the Lord's business. He says, "And I
[1:40:57] thought that animal," he says, "Oh, I'm
[1:41:00] so sorry that I disturbed you." I said,
[1:41:02] "I don't want you to kill me. I'm the
[1:41:04] servant of God, and I'm on my road to
[1:41:06] pray for some sick people, and I forgot
[1:41:08] about those signs." He said, "I was
[1:41:09] talking to him just as I am now." Not
[1:41:12] this big, bold, loud, demanding. He
[1:41:16] says, 'I was talking to him just like
[1:41:18] I'm talking to you now. He says, there
[1:41:20] was something another that had happened.
[1:41:22] I wasn't scared of him. I was no more
[1:41:24] afraid of that bull than I would be my
[1:41:26] brother. But he says that's where the
[1:41:28] churches, you're always scared, it's not
[1:41:31] going to happen. He says that's the
[1:41:33] reason it doesn't happen. Love casts out
[1:41:36] fear. And when you have love, fear is
[1:41:38] gone. But as long as you have fear, love
[1:41:41] cannot operate. Amen. So when we
[1:41:43] question God, what are we doing? for
[1:41:45] questioning his love because as we read
[1:41:47] last sermon, his love is that all things
[1:41:49] work together for good. And if we
[1:41:52] disbelieve him, we disbelieve his love
[1:41:56] and we forget or we doubt he loves us.
[1:41:58] All of a sudden, we step out from under
[1:42:00] his protection, his benefits, and all of
[1:42:02] a sudden we're left naked. And what am I
[1:42:05] going to
[1:42:06] do? He says, when the bull made his
[1:42:08] charge to come to me, he came within
[1:42:10] about 10 ft. Then he stopped and threw
[1:42:12] his front feet out and he looked so
[1:42:14] depleted as he looked this way and that
[1:42:16] and he turned and went right back around
[1:42:18] and laid down over there where he got up
[1:42:20] at. He says, "And I walked across the
[1:42:22] field, went out of the pasture." He just
[1:42:25] laid there and looked at me. He says it
[1:42:27] was love that took that fear away and
[1:42:29] God saw me through. He says, "Now after
[1:42:32] I got out of the pasture and that left
[1:42:33] me, then I just shook like a leaf. But
[1:42:36] while I was in the presence of him, that
[1:42:38] fear had left." What adrenaline hits the
[1:42:43] reality? I almost lost my life. But you
[1:42:46] notice brother Brandham didn't sit there
[1:42:48] screaming internally, "God, why did you
[1:42:50] put me in this situation? God, why am I
[1:42:53] about to die? You called me to pray for
[1:42:55] this person and then you put me in
[1:42:59] danger." He never prayed
[1:43:01] that. No. Why
[1:43:06] me? Funny. I was talking to somebody
[1:43:08] after service last after last service
[1:43:10] and they said, you know, a certain thing
[1:43:12] happened and I said, why
[1:43:15] me? The answer came back, well, who else
[1:43:17] would you have me put it
[1:43:21] on? Right? I'm not going to say, Lord,
[1:43:24] don't give it to me. Give it to my
[1:43:25] brother Matt over
[1:43:28] there. Lord, give it to some
[1:43:31] unbeliever. Because really, we wouldn't
[1:43:33] do that. I don't think I don't think
[1:43:34] we'd ever say, "Lord, take my suffering
[1:43:35] and give it to somebody
[1:43:37] else. He gives us what we're able to
[1:43:41] handle." As we read last service, it's
[1:43:43] his grace. You found favor when he puts
[1:43:45] you in those situations. Amen. Brother
[1:43:48] Brandham didn't sit there and say, "God,
[1:43:50] why
[1:43:51] me?" He didn't jump out with this bold,
[1:43:54] authoritarian, loud shout to the bull.
[1:43:58] He said, "Something came over
[1:44:00] me." And what did he do? He
[1:44:03] apologized and he said, "But I've got to
[1:44:06] continue my
[1:44:07] way." He says, "Isn't that bold
[1:44:09] charged?" And then he went and laid
[1:44:11] down. I love how he says he looks so
[1:44:12] depleted. He didn't know what happened.
[1:44:15] Church, what happened there? Authority?
[1:44:17] No. Perfect love. What did he do,
[1:44:19] church? He restored the bull to his
[1:44:22] undisturbed
[1:44:24] condition. Brother Brham didn't take
[1:44:26] authority over him. He gave him grace to
[1:44:28] go back to what he was before. Brother
[1:44:29] Brandham knocked him out of his revery.
[1:44:32] That's what perfect love will do. It'll
[1:44:34] set them back to the way they were.
[1:44:37] Amen. He wasn't trying to dominate that
[1:44:39] killer bull. Amen. He was setting that
[1:44:43] bull free from its own
[1:44:45] instincts. You think about that. You
[1:44:48] talk about power to control
[1:44:50] nature, not to make it do what you want,
[1:44:53] but to put it back to the peace it was
[1:44:55] supposed to have in the first place.
[1:44:57] That's what perfect love did.
[1:44:59] But it brings us back to the question,
[1:45:01] am I walking in the will of God? That's
[1:45:04] where you'll find so much of this comes
[1:45:06] down is, am I walking in the will of
[1:45:08] God? Am I living according to his plan,
[1:45:10] his purpose? Is my time being spent in
[1:45:12] his service? Is my money being spent in
[1:45:14] his service? Am I walking in the
[1:45:16] fullness of what God wants for me? And
[1:45:18] if we can say we are, we can walk in
[1:45:20] assurance of the faith that is supposed
[1:45:22] to come with us, walking in his
[1:45:24] will. When situations arise, we can
[1:45:27] stand and say, "Lord, I'm in your will.
[1:45:29] I'm doing what you've led me to do. I'm
[1:45:31] standing on your word." And then we can
[1:45:33] just walk forward trusting him to open
[1:45:36] up the doors, knock down the walls,
[1:45:37] remove the barriers, whatever it may
[1:45:40] be. Mothers, you're faithfully in the
[1:45:43] line of duty day in and day out. And let
[1:45:45] me tell you, you can stand there and
[1:45:47] raise the standard of the word in your
[1:45:49] house. You can do it. You don't have to
[1:45:52] wait for a husband to come home. You
[1:45:54] have to wait for a visitor, a minister
[1:45:56] to come your way. Amen. You can raise it
[1:45:58] over your health issues. You can raise
[1:45:59] it over your children issues. You can
[1:46:01] raise it over your school issues. You
[1:46:02] can raise it over your marital
[1:46:04] issues. You can raise it over the head
[1:46:06] games that Satan likes to play with you
[1:46:08] day in and day out. You got power to do
[1:46:10] that. Amen. Why? Because you're in the
[1:46:12] line of duty. You're right where he told
[1:46:15] you to be. You're right where he told
[1:46:17] you to be. And you can say, "Satan, you
[1:46:19] have no right
[1:46:20] here. There's a standard." Brother Bram
[1:46:23] says, what does he do? He says, what is
[1:46:24] raising the standard? He says, it's
[1:46:26] pouring in more of the Holy
[1:46:28] Spirit, more of God to push out that
[1:46:30] faith or push out that fear. Amen. You
[1:46:33] don't have to be a man. You don't have
[1:46:34] to be a minister. You can raise that
[1:46:36] yourself. Brother Ram says it this way.
[1:46:38] We're almost done. Inside of you is a
[1:46:40] spirit. It's another man. The outside of
[1:46:42] you is one man. The inside of you is
[1:46:44] another. So, the inside of you is the
[1:46:46] supernatural. The outside of you is the
[1:46:49] physical. See, and this being if you are
[1:46:51] spirit led by God, you become a
[1:46:54] messenger of God or an
[1:46:57] angel. He ain't talking just about
[1:46:59] himself, church. He's talking about you.
[1:47:01] He says, if you are spiritled, you
[1:47:05] become a messenger or an angel of God.
[1:47:07] God's messenger, God's angel is the very
[1:47:09] same word. You can't separate it. He
[1:47:11] says, "And which has the greatest
[1:47:12] authority? An angel from heaven or an
[1:47:15] angel at the pulpit?" Which has it? He
[1:47:18] says, "The angel at the pulpit, Paul
[1:47:20] said, 'If an angel from heaven comes and
[1:47:21] preaches any other gospel to you than
[1:47:23] that which I've already preached, let
[1:47:24] him be accursed." So the ana the angel
[1:47:27] anointed with the Holy Spirit and the
[1:47:30] word stands next to
[1:47:35] God. You say he's talking about
[1:47:37] himself. You say he's talking about the
[1:47:40] five-fold ministry. Uh-uh. He's talking
[1:47:42] about
[1:47:43] you. Listen to this. He says, "All power
[1:47:46] in heavens and earth is given to my
[1:47:48] hand. Go and I'll go with you. Whatever
[1:47:50] you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven.
[1:47:52] Whatever you loose on earth, I'll loose
[1:47:53] in heaven." He says, "Oh, if who?" The
[1:47:57] great holy church only realized its
[1:48:00] power to do these things. But there's so
[1:48:03] much doubt and fear and trembling
[1:48:04] wondering if it will. Could it happen?
[1:48:07] He says, "As long as that exists, the
[1:48:08] church can never stand upright." He's
[1:48:10] trying to get you to see your position,
[1:48:12] your authority. He said, "And when every
[1:48:15] talk of fear has
[1:48:18] vanished, when you stop talking about
[1:48:21] the
[1:48:22] whatifs and you start talking about the
[1:48:24] what will be by the word, he says, and
[1:48:27] the Holy Spirit is completely in control
[1:48:29] of the church." He says,
[1:48:31] "Then all fears are gone and that church
[1:48:34] has the power." See why? They have
[1:48:37] everything that heaven owns behind them.
[1:48:40] They're ambassadors of the throne.
[1:48:42] Absolutely. He says an ambassador of
[1:48:45] Christ has the authority and everything
[1:48:47] that Christ owns belongs to that
[1:48:49] ambassador. You look at uh these
[1:48:51] ambassadors that Donald Trump has been
[1:48:52] sending
[1:48:53] out. You talk about a hard job. You're
[1:48:57] going and you're delivering a message
[1:48:58] that nobody wants to hear. But what do
[1:49:01] they do? They don't bring their own
[1:49:02] message. They bring the message they've
[1:49:04] been given. And when they deliver that
[1:49:06] message, all of the authority of the
[1:49:07] United States is behind them. He says,
[1:49:10] "When you're speaking what he tells you
[1:49:12] to speak, when you're doing what he
[1:49:13] tells you to do, you become an
[1:49:15] ambassador of heaven and every power of
[1:49:19] heaven is behind you."
[1:49:21] Then he says, "And he said, go ye into
[1:49:25] all the world. You are my witnesses
[1:49:27] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you."
[1:49:30] He says, "What is a witness? It's an
[1:49:32] ambassador. It's to come and witness
[1:49:34] something. The whole powers of heaven
[1:49:36] are right in your hands." He says, "Oh,
[1:49:39] why do we set and the church is barren
[1:49:41] and we set dormant? Is it because we
[1:49:44] don't recognize these
[1:49:47] things?" Let's stand if we
[1:49:50] would. Let me close with one
[1:49:53] thought. Why do we
[1:49:55] doubt? Why do we
[1:49:57] fear? Why do we
[1:49:59] worry? It's because we either don't
[1:50:01] realize our position or Satan gets us to
[1:50:05] forget our position. Amen.
[1:50:08] We forget we're here with purpose. We're
[1:50:09] forget we're here to do and be a
[1:50:12] witness. We're supposed to be witnesses
[1:50:15] to everybody. Brother Bram says when
[1:50:17] you're spiritled and you're on his
[1:50:19] business, you become a witness. He says,
[1:50:21] "And a witness is an
[1:50:23] ambassador and you have all the
[1:50:25] authority of the kingdom behind you."
[1:50:28] Amen. We forget that God has put us here
[1:50:31] to do something.
[1:50:34] I think we forget sometimes because
[1:50:36] sometimes we're just not doing it. We're
[1:50:38] not doing what he tells us to
[1:50:40] do. We literally are doing our own
[1:50:42] thing. We're going our own way. We're
[1:50:44] focused on our own things. And so we
[1:50:46] can't have confidence because we're not
[1:50:47] doing what he wants us to do. But other
[1:50:49] times, we're forgetting that what we're
[1:50:51] doing is exactly what he wants us to do.
[1:50:54] And the thing is this, a Christian life,
[1:50:56] remember what Paul equates us to. He
[1:50:58] equates us to two things. Soldiers and
[1:50:59] athletes. And if you notice, no two
[1:51:02] things about them is they do the same
[1:51:03] thing day in and day out. And sometimes
[1:51:06] we forget that this mundane life that we
[1:51:09] live is exactly the witness that we're
[1:51:11] supposed to be giving. And we forget
[1:51:14] that just because we're living life, we
[1:51:16] think, well, that's just life. No, that
[1:51:18] is your god orained purpose day in and
[1:51:21] day out. Brothers, what do we do? We get
[1:51:24] up in the morning. We eat our breakfast.
[1:51:26] We go out the door. We work. We come
[1:51:28] home. We play with our kids. We eat
[1:51:30] supper. We read devotions. We sleep. And
[1:51:33] we rinse and
[1:51:34] repeat. You say, "How is that an
[1:51:36] ambassador?" Because you're
[1:51:39] spiritled. Where you go, what you say,
[1:51:43] what you don't say, how you lead your
[1:51:46] family, the priorities you set,
[1:51:49] everybody's looking at you. You don't
[1:51:51] realize it. Everybody's looking at that
[1:51:53] stable Christian walk that we're
[1:51:55] supposed to be living. We're
[1:51:56] ambassadors. And there's all of the
[1:51:58] authority of heaven behind us when we're
[1:52:00] doing those simple things. See, we just
[1:52:02] call it the Christian life, but we're
[1:52:04] ambassadors from heaven. And he's behind
[1:52:07] us to what? To prove himself through us
[1:52:09] day in and day out. Mothers, you wake
[1:52:12] up, you make breakfast, dress the kids,
[1:52:16] send them to school, teach them school,
[1:52:19] occasionally take a shower, and do your
[1:52:21] hair if you're lucky.
[1:52:24] Everyone comes home, make meals, clean
[1:52:26] up, maybe get a bit of a break, go to
[1:52:29] sleep, rinse and repeat. That's just
[1:52:32] life. No, that's your
[1:52:34] ambassadorship. Everyone's looking at
[1:52:36] you. You don't realize it. Everyone's
[1:52:39] looking at you and they see the
[1:52:40] difference between your life and their
[1:52:41] life, and they wonder, "What is it?"
[1:52:43] It's because you're ambassadors from
[1:52:44] another kingdom. And when Satan comes in
[1:52:47] and tries to interrupt those things, you
[1:52:49] got a right to say, "I'm in the father's
[1:52:51] business."
[1:52:52] You don't have a right to be here. I
[1:52:55] didn't invite you in and you can speak
[1:52:57] to that mountain or the molehill,
[1:53:00] whatever it might be. Young people, you
[1:53:03] go around, you go to
[1:53:05] school, you hang out with friends, you
[1:53:07] ride your bikes, you play your sports,
[1:53:09] you go play instruments. People are
[1:53:11] watching you. They watch your respect
[1:53:14] for authority and your respect for
[1:53:15] property. They watch what you say and
[1:53:17] what you do. And let me tell you, you're
[1:53:19] going to face situations where you got
[1:53:21] to be able to stand up and say, "Not
[1:53:23] me. That ain't a part of my life." And
[1:53:25] Satan's going to try and push his way
[1:53:27] in. And what happens? Fear's going to
[1:53:29] rise up. You're going to have to say,
[1:53:32] "Hey, I'm a child of
[1:53:34] God. I'm an ambassador from heaven. I'm
[1:53:37] a witness of a living Jesus Christ." And
[1:53:40] you got to be able to stand up and say,
[1:53:41] "Not today, Satan. And not tomorrow if
[1:53:43] you're looking for there either. I'm a
[1:53:46] bloodb born again child of God. you're
[1:53:48] not allowed to be here. And man, it's
[1:53:51] time we stop thinking, I'm just living
[1:53:53] life. We're not. We're living
[1:53:56] Christ. The word's being made flesh. And
[1:54:00] those simple, mundane, day-to-day tasks
[1:54:03] are a witness to this world that we've
[1:54:05] passed from death unto life. We've just
[1:54:08] become so used to it. I say, "Praise the
[1:54:11] Lord. We're used to it." But let's not
[1:54:13] forget that we are ambassadors for
[1:54:16] heaven in all of these little things
[1:54:17] that we do.
[1:54:18] Amen. Remember what we read in Psalms
[1:54:20] 103 last service. Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:54:23] soul, forget not all his benefits. Who
[1:54:27] forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[1:54:28] healthth all thy diseases, who redeemth
[1:54:31] thy life from destruction, and who
[1:54:32] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[1:54:34] tender mercies, who satisfyth thy mouth
[1:54:37] with good things, so that thy youth is
[1:54:41] renewed like the eagles. Amen. God bless
[1:54:44] you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:54:49] Father, how wonderful it is, Lord, to
[1:54:53] know that we are your children. We are
[1:54:56] your bride. We are your church. Lord, we
[1:54:59] are the temple of the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[1:55:02] we are the word made flesh today. But
[1:55:05] Lord, we know we've got an enemy. We've
[1:55:07] got an adversary that's trying to keep
[1:55:09] our eyes off of these things, Lord. He's
[1:55:11] trying to stifle that revelation, Lord.
[1:55:14] He's trying to keep us from acting on
[1:55:15] what you've revealed to us, Lord. And he
[1:55:18] does it through doubt, which brings
[1:55:21] fear. But Lord, we know you're with us.
[1:55:24] You're in us, Lord. We know what your
[1:55:26] word says that you're bringing us to
[1:55:28] that expected end, Lord, of a body
[1:55:30] change, Lord. That we'll come to a place
[1:55:32] where you wipe every tear from our eye,
[1:55:35] Lord, where we'll have a total
[1:55:36] deliverance, a total victory, Lord, in
[1:55:39] that great moment as we meet you in the
[1:55:41] air, Lord. But between now and then,
[1:55:44] Lord, we've got a road to walk, Lord.
[1:55:47] And I believe you've ordained us to walk
[1:55:48] in victory, to walk in peace, to walk in
[1:55:52] rest, Lord. David said, "Yay, though I
[1:55:54] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:55:56] death, I will fear no evil, Lord. I pray
[1:55:58] you raise up a spirit of faith in us
[1:56:00] this evening, Lord, that we would rest
[1:56:02] assured in what you've said about us,
[1:56:05] Lord. And if there's any doubt that
[1:56:06] we're a child of God, Lord, may we
[1:56:08] settle it here
[1:56:09] tonight, Lord. We need your spirit more
[1:56:11] and more, Lord. We need a fresh baptism
[1:56:14] of your spirit in our lives are
[1:56:16] refreshing. Lord, we need something
[1:56:18] that'll keep us alive day in and day out
[1:56:20] when the sun gets hot. Lord, when the
[1:56:22] water
[1:56:23] fails, Lord, something that'll keep us
[1:56:25] through those dry
[1:56:27] times. Lord, I pray you'd just help us
[1:56:29] this evening. Lord, let us look to you.
[1:56:31] Let us confess your word, Lord. Give us,
[1:56:33] Lord, a testimony that we can lay hold
[1:56:35] of. A word that keeps us alive day by
[1:56:37] day, Lord. Not just service to service,
[1:56:40] message to message, Lord, but a
[1:56:41] dayby-day feeding of the bread of life,
[1:56:44] Lord, that keeps us walking in your will
[1:56:46] and in your way, each one. Lord, bless
[1:56:48] us now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:56:51] we ask it.
[1:56:56] Amen. Power of your love. 797.
[1:57:04] Lord, I come to
[1:57:07] you. Oh, let my heart be
[1:57:12] changed,
[1:57:15] renewed, flowing from the
[1:57:19] grace that I
[1:57:22] found
[1:57:24] in
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:31] you. Lord, I come to
[1:57:35] know the weaknesses I
[1:57:40] see in
[1:57:42] me will be stripped
[1:57:48] away by the power of your love.
[1:57:57] Hold me
[1:57:59] close and let your love
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:11] sur
[1:58:12] here and draw me to your
[1:58:16] [Laughter]
[1:58:20] side. And
[1:58:24] as I wait,
[1:58:27] I'll rise up like the
[1:58:33] eagle and I will soar with you. Your
[1:58:37] spirit leads me on by the power of your
[1:58:45] love. And Lord, unveil my eyes.
[1:58:51] Let me see you
[1:58:54] face to
[1:58:56] face with the knowledge of your
[1:59:01] love as you
[1:59:04] live in
[1:59:12] me. And Lord, renew my
[1:59:16] mind as your will unfolds.
[1:59:21] In my
[1:59:22] life, in living every
[1:59:29] day by the power of your
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:34] love,
[1:59:37] hold me
[1:59:39] close and let your light
[1:59:44] surround me.
[1:59:48] Oh,
[1:59:50] bring me
[1:59:52] near and draw me to your
[2:00:00] side. And
[2:00:03] as I
[2:00:05] wake, I'll rise up like
[2:00:10] the
[2:00:12] eagle and I will soar with you.
[2:00:16] Your spirit leads me on by the power of
[2:00:21] your
[2:00:25] love. And Lord, I come to
[2:00:29] you. Let my heart be
[2:00:33] changed,
[2:00:36] renewed, flowing from the
[2:00:40] grace that I
[2:00:43] found in you.
[2:00:48] Hallelujah.
[2:00:52] And Lord, I come to
[2:00:55] know the weaknesses I
[2:00:59] see in
[2:01:02] me will be stripped away
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:09] by the power of your love.
[2:01:14] Oh,
[2:01:16] hold me
[2:01:18] close and let your love
[2:01:24] surround me.
[2:01:29] Bring
[2:01:33] me to your side.
[2:01:41] And
[2:01:42] as I wake,
[2:01:46] I'll rise up like the
[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:51] eagle and I will soar with you. Your
[2:01:56] spirit leads me on by the power of your
[2:02:01] love.
[2:02:04] So
[2:02:06] hold me
[2:02:08] close and let your love
[2:02:13] surround me.
[2:02:23] Draw me to your
[2:02:25] [Music]
[2:02:29] side. And
[2:02:32] as I
[2:02:34] wake, I'll rise up like the
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:41] eagle and I will soar with you. Your
[2:02:46] spirit leads me on by the power of your
[2:02:53] love. Amen. I like how we read what Paul
[2:02:56] said. He said, "When you pray, give
[2:02:58] thanks."
[2:02:59] says, "Be thankful."
[2:03:03] Amen.
[2:03:04] Testify to your
[2:03:08] situation. If you've laid hold of a
[2:03:11] promise, testify of what you've laid
[2:03:14] hold of. Amen. Say, "It is
[2:03:18] well. God is good. His word is true. And
[2:03:22] I'm a part of it. It's for me. It's not
[2:03:25] just for my brother or my sister that
[2:03:27] got healed, that got delivered, that got
[2:03:28] saved, that got filled with the Holy
[2:03:29] Ghost, but it's for me. It's mine. Amen.
[2:03:32] It belongs to me. We're going to sing
[2:03:35] that song, The Goodness of God,
[2:03:37] 1254. And let's praise him. Amen. Let's
[2:03:40] thank him. Amen. Let's testify of his
[2:03:43] goodness. Listen, if he's done something
[2:03:45] for you, it means he's going to do
[2:03:47] something for you. He didn't start to
[2:03:49] stop. Amen. That's the way God works.
[2:03:52] Once he gets moving, there's no
[2:03:54] stopping. And all he's asking us to do
[2:03:56] is believe he's moving no matter what.
[2:03:58] Amen. And it comes from a spirit of
[2:04:00] praise. The Israelites walked into
[2:04:03] battle with praise and worship on their
[2:04:05] lips. And it was testifying to a victory
[2:04:07] they did not see, but they believed was
[2:04:09] coming their way. Amen. That's how we
[2:04:12] get the victory. We testify of the truth
[2:04:15] of God, of the goodness of God. We look
[2:04:17] at a book of remembrance and we say,
[2:04:18] "God, you've done it before. You're
[2:04:20] going to do it again." and we walk
[2:04:22] forward in faith. Amen. Let's sing this
[2:04:26] together. I love you,
[2:04:32] Lord, for your mercy never fails
[2:04:38] me. And all my
[2:04:41] days I've been held in your hands. Thank
[2:04:46] you, Lord.
[2:04:48] From the moment that I wake
[2:04:52] up until I lay my
[2:04:56] head. Oh, I will sing of the
[2:05:01] goodness of God.
[2:05:08] And all my life.
[2:05:12] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:16] And all my life you have been so so
[2:05:24] good with every breath that I am
[2:05:30] able. Oh, I will sing of the
[2:05:35] goodness of God.
[2:05:40] I love your voice
[2:05:45] and you have led me through the
[2:05:49] fire in darkest
[2:05:53] nights. You are close like no
[2:05:58] other. I've known you as a
[2:06:03] father. I've known you as a friend.
[2:06:08] And I have lived in the
[2:06:12] goodness of God.
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:19] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:06:26] Yes, Lord. And all my life you have been
[2:06:31] so so good.
[2:06:36] With every breath that I am
[2:06:41] able, oh I will sing of the
[2:06:47] goodness of
[2:06:50] God. I love you,
[2:06:55] Lord. For your mercy never fails me.
[2:07:01] And all my
[2:07:03] days I've been held in your
[2:07:09] hands. From the moment that I wake
[2:07:14] up until I lay my
[2:07:18] head. Oh, I will sing of the
[2:07:23] goodness of
[2:07:28] God. And all my life you have been
[2:07:33] faithful.
[2:07:38] And all my life you have been so so
[2:07:45] good. With every breath that I am
[2:07:51] able. Oh, I will sing of the
[2:07:56] goodness of God.
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:04] felt led here today while I listen to
[2:08:06] the service just to come and share a
[2:08:08] little
[2:08:10] testimony. Uh last four or five years
[2:08:13] I've been dealing with a a skin
[2:08:14] irritation that's been really bothering
[2:08:17] me near the end of the day gets really
[2:08:19] bad
[2:08:20] and it affects how how much I move. I
[2:08:24] couldn't play much sports with my kids.
[2:08:27] It just became pretty irritated. I
[2:08:29] didn't tell many people about it. It's
[2:08:31] came on slowly
[2:08:33] and human thinking is I'll just deal
[2:08:35] with
[2:08:36] it. But after a while, you get tired of
[2:08:38] it. And you know, you get tired of the
[2:08:39] devil beating you
[2:08:41] down. So the last few months, I really
[2:08:44] been putting a lot of prayer into this.
[2:08:46] And it was just a little over two weeks
[2:08:48] ago before I two days before the special
[2:08:50] meetings, I was driving home talking to
[2:08:52] my wife and I said, "I'm just waiting
[2:08:54] for the Lord to heal
[2:08:58] me." And through the
[2:09:01] uh through the special meetings there,
[2:09:03] you know, I came forward and prayed and
[2:09:04] that was the thing I got prayed for, one
[2:09:06] of
[2:09:06] them. And by God's grace, every single
[2:09:09] day since then, my skin condition has
[2:09:12] been getting better.
[2:09:14] Normally by now it's affecting me. I
[2:09:17] don't feel a thing.
[2:09:20] I didn't just hear him tonight. You
[2:09:21] know, we got to testify to get your
[2:09:22] complete to finalize it. I couldn't
[2:09:26] shake it. It don't matter the time
[2:09:28] frame. God's all we'll step in when it's
[2:09:30] needed. And I just felt to share that.
[2:09:33] Thank
[2:09:35] you. Amen.
[2:09:38] And prisoners chains. Do we know that
[2:09:39] one?
[2:09:41] It's 928.
[2:09:47] in prisoners
[2:09:50] chains with
[2:09:52] bleeding stripes.
[2:09:57] Paul and
[2:10:01] Silus prayed that
[2:10:05] night and in their
[2:10:09] pain began to
[2:10:14] sing. Their chains were
[2:10:18] loosed and they were free.
[2:10:24] I bless your
[2:10:27] name. I bless your
[2:10:32] name. I give you
[2:10:37] honor. Give you
[2:10:40] praise. You are the
[2:10:45] life, the truth, the way.
[2:10:50] I bless your
[2:10:54] name. I bless your
[2:10:58] name. Some midnight
[2:11:03] hour. If you should
[2:11:07] find you're in a
[2:11:12] prison of your
[2:11:15] mind and reach out and pray.
[2:11:21] defy those
[2:11:24] chains and they will
[2:11:28] fall in Jesus
[2:11:32] name. And I bless your
[2:11:37] name. I bless your
[2:11:41] name. I give you honor.
[2:11:47] Give you
[2:11:50] praise. You are the
[2:11:54] life, the truth, the
[2:11:58] way. I bless your
[2:12:02] name. I bless your name.
[2:12:07] and some midnight
[2:12:11] hour. If you should
[2:12:15] find you're in a
[2:12:20] prison in your
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:24] mind. Reach out in faith.
[2:12:29] defy those
[2:12:32] chains and they will
[2:12:37] fall in Jesus
[2:12:41] name. And I bless your
[2:12:45] name. I bless your
[2:12:49] name. I give you
[2:12:54] honor. Give you praise.
[2:12:59] You are the
[2:13:02] light, the truth, the
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:07] way. I bless your
[2:13:11] name. I bless your name.
[2:13:17] Amen. We're going to close in a word of
[2:13:19] prayer. Brother Grant, I'm going to ask
[2:13:20] you to come and close. We're going to
[2:13:22] sing Our God is tremendous before we go.
[2:13:25] 12:55. Amen. And I want to go out with a
[2:13:27] word of praise on my lips. Amen. I don't
[2:13:30] want to go out with a sour face or mind
[2:13:33] that's overcome by doubt and fear. Amen.
[2:13:35] But I want to talk about the good things
[2:13:37] of God. Amen. We need to talk about it.
[2:13:39] It lifts our spirits. Gets us in a right
[2:13:41] attitude and atmosphere. Amen. Let's
[2:13:44] sing this just before we go and brother
[2:13:45] Grant will
[2:13:47] close. When I'm in need, I call on the
[2:13:52] Lord and he hears me. Yes, he helps me.
[2:13:57] He is
[2:13:59] faithful and true. Won't forget his
[2:14:05] own. My
[2:14:08] companion, my best friend, the only true
[2:14:12] God. There's no one greater or wonderful
[2:14:17] Savior. Jesus, the lion of Judah.

[2:14:26] never failth. He'll go through the fire
[2:14:30] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is
[2:14:34] almighty. And he sent his
[2:14:37] angels to guide

[2:18:20] Hallelujah. Thank you
[2:18:23] Lord. Oh God such love that you have
[2:18:26] demonstrated Lord.
[2:18:29] Lord God, love, oh God, that will go
[2:18:32] beyond the
[2:18:33] boundaries to save, oh
[2:18:36] God, and to show God, Lord God, your
[2:18:40] willingness to save your children, oh
[2:18:42] God, and to reconcile us back to
[2:18:46] yourself, oh God, we are humble this
[2:18:48] evening.
[2:18:51] Hallelujah. To see God that Lord, no
[2:18:54] matter where we are, Lord, you you'll
[2:18:57] find us, Lord. And
[2:18:59] Lord God, you searched, Lord God. Lord,
[2:19:02] of the scripture said, Lord, you left
[2:19:04] the splenders of heaven, Lord God,
[2:19:06] knowing your destiny. Lord, it was to
[2:19:09] die, Lord God, to bring us back to
[2:19:12] yourself. Lord God, we're grateful, Lord
[2:19:15] God, that you are willing, Lord God, to
[2:19:17] to bring us back, Lord God. And we see,
[2:19:20] we felt that love, Lord. And we we know,
[2:19:23] God, it's real. It's real, Lord God. And
[2:19:27] so God, it gave us such a reassurance,
[2:19:29] Lord God, that if you're willing to give
[2:19:32] everything, Lord God, to reconcile us,
[2:19:34] Lord God, much more than our sicknesses,
[2:19:38] much more than our failures, much more
[2:19:40] than our defeat, oh God, stands the
[2:19:44] perfect love of God. And so God, the
[2:19:47] greatest we can do this evening, Lord
[2:19:49] God, is to trust you, Lord, and believe,
[2:19:52] Lord God, that what you promise, Lord
[2:19:54] God, we are more than able to bring it
[2:19:56] to pass. And so this evening, Lord God,
[2:19:58] as we humble our hearts, Lord God, we we
[2:20:01] just want to lift for you, Lord. We we
[2:20:03] just want to be a vessel for you. We
[2:20:05] just want to be a witness for you, Lord
[2:20:06] God. Hallelujah. Lord, we want our lives
[2:20:09] to be, Lord God, such a testimony that
[2:20:12] someone can see the the love of God
[2:20:15] radiating through our lives, Lord.
[2:20:17] Hallelujah. Lives being a living
[2:20:19] testimony, Lord. And and so God, the
[2:20:21] greatest we can do, God, is to
[2:20:23] surrender, Lord God. And Lord God,
[2:20:26] hallelujah, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:20:30] Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord, we surrender
[2:20:33] now to you, Lord. Lord as a writer said
[2:20:36] all to Jesus I surrender all to him I
[2:20:40] freely give oh God we give you ourself
[2:20:43] Lord God we give ourselves away to you
[2:20:46] now Lord oh God that you will come Lord
[2:20:49] may you bless us Lord God Lord God in
[2:20:51] this journey of time Lord God as we Lord
[2:20:54] God as we travel there are so many
[2:20:56] instances of failure there's so many
[2:20:58] instances oh God where we feel oh God
[2:21:01] that we cannot make it but but Lord God
[2:21:03] when we turn the pages, Lord, and we
[2:21:06] look, Lord, in the perfect world. And
[2:21:08] and Lord, we are reassured by your
[2:21:10] presence, Lord God, that Lord, you never
[2:21:13] leave us. You never forsake us. Lord
[2:21:15] God, when we're going through the trials
[2:21:18] of time, and it seems overwhelmed, Lord
[2:21:20] God, oh hallelujah, your Holy Spirit,
[2:21:23] come and whisper the words of love, oh
[2:21:26] God, that just still love us, Lord. Uh
[2:21:29] Lord God, and you still care for us. Uh
[2:21:31] and so God, here we are. Not because we
[2:21:34] are worthy. Not because we are good. Uh
[2:21:36] oh God, but because Lord God, we
[2:21:38] recognize your love. And in our heart,
[2:21:41] Lord God, we believe, hallelujah, Lord
[2:21:43] God, that we are called for this. We are
[2:21:45] called for this journey. We are called
[2:21:47] as overcomers. Uh and Lord God, another
[2:21:50] scripture declares we're more than
[2:21:51] conqueror this evening, Lord. May you
