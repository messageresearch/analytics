be christ that projected lord in this service tonight we pray in your name we ask it amen and amen and thank you musicians certainly appreciate their sacrifice coming in and not a lot of support here in the song leader and these different ones so i always appreciate it always appreciate when brother when brother paul can do some picking instead of just strumming it's always says it's a beautiful thing on those slow songs you know really enjoy that and man if you'll turn the scriptures tonight to first john chapter one very familiar scripture again uh just want to clarify one thing brother darin carr hasn't had surgery yet it's going to happen but he's waiting on a slot so he asks us to be in prayer for not only that for when he has a surgery but also that he would get the surgery because he needs it matt i'm getting a bit of feedback here i don't know if that can be adjusted at all but uh remember that and then i spoke with brother ron spencer as well this week and nothing i say here is is not public knowledge but uh he's been having a real battle there when he spoke he preached this last sunday but the sunday before he wasn't able to make it through the service he stopped about 15 minutes in just completely out of strength so i reached out to him this week to see how he was he did preach this sunday for about 35 minutes so he's better and as he says boo devil he's there to show whose side he's on and what he believes but he says it's been a real struggle on his body his energy levels are very low because he's going through constant chemo so he's on another 12 week round of treatments again so definitely asks and appreciates the prayers of the saints amen amen in our scriptures first john chapter 1 says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things we write unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth it doesn't say have not it says we do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us now he's not saying here that we are sinners he says he's speaking of before you came to christ he says if we have no sin you'll never come to repentance you'll never come to that place and then we're in a sinful condition before we ever accept christ and people that say i have no need of repentance i haven't done anything wrong those are the ones that are absolutely lost because they can't even come to a place of repentance but for the believer there is no sin in us and we've covered that in previous services where where uh the prophetoss he says when the seed of god is in you then how can you be a sinner because you are of god and there's no sin in god therefore there's no sin in you it's just planted in a sinful body amen so he's not saying you're that that that we are sinners here he's saying that you have to recognize that you were in a sinful condition and that you're going to be fighting that day in and day out amen that your perfection is not in your body your perfection is in your soul because that's where god resides verse 9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us and many came to redeem us and how come he has to redeem us if there's no sin here to separate us from him amen you can have your seats this evening amen again certainly good to have uh our amen corner back with samuel here and i see that brother matt coffey's younger uh brother is here or something because that can't be brother matt with a clean face amen so anyways good to see him i'm sure he's uh he's done that for work purposes not because it makes him look more handsome so anyways uh this evening i'm going to start another uh a short series and uh i was just dwelling on some things in the scripture that we read dropped into my heart and i went to just some thoughts were coming so i started putting them into the computer and that and when i went to put it in i found a file that had this exact name from 2017 and i've been doing some some uh proofreading for brother mark on the lonnie jenkins commentary and whatnot and there was a couple things that jumped out at me in there and i just thrown them into a file really quickly and left it there and hadn't picked it up in four years almost or three and a half years four years i guess now at this point so anyways this is it this is we're not actually going to get to what we what i had in there but it kind of just sparked some of this so this evening we want to speak on walking in the light amen and as with all of the preaching i do we don't just want to just teach and give us a foundation but we want to make it personal we want to look at ourselves in the light and in the mirror of the word and and we want to move on from there amen we don't just want to sit here and know that things are right but we want to be in the rightness amen we want to be right we don't just want to know right amen this is something that has to be applied every day we have a daily walk with god and we want to grow with him in the things that he's showing us amen we don't want to stand still standing still is brother brown says you're never standing still he says you're always going backwards or forwards now sometimes you're only moving forward a little bit and sometimes you're only moving backwards a little a little bit but he says you're never standing still when it comes to your position in christ he's always growing you or else you're backsliding that's a tough thing to think sometimes and it's a it's a good thing for us to ask though at the end of the day is did i move forward or did i slide back today where did i end up compared to where i was yesterday amen but we definitely don't want to be standing still brother bram says this just to kind of fire us up a bit he says no matter what stage of the battle you're in if you backed up and said i'm afraid of divine healing i'm afraid of this that or the other i'm afraid about the baptism of the holy spirit speak and go forward no retreat don't come back there's nothing to back up to amen having left behind those things that are behind us what do we do we press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling amen he said god is always go forward if it is in the line of duty the line of his word go on and move on well say i know someone went into fanaticism but that wasn't you see your duty is to go forward until god gets through with you you just keep moving forward and as long as we're here as long as we haven't gone into rapture god's still working on us god's still growing us god's still strengthening us god's still changing us god's still sanctifying us he's doing all these things it's a constant work until we go in that rapture so according to what the prophet says theirs we should always be moving forward amen never backward the only time you move backwards when you've left him right you've got to come back to where he was that's the only time you go back but that's why he says if you're in the line of duty the line of his word always press forward and then always push the battle so for speaking on walking in the light the first thing we have to lock down is what is light amen if we want to walk in the light there's a lot of people walking in the light of of today that they would think you know with the different thoughts and the different isms and and the way that society is going these days a lot of people believe they are enlightened and every age has thought they were enlightened i'm sure the cavemen thought they were enlightened you know when they first struck fire and the wheel first was created in these different things and they thought they were very enlightened and today we certainly think that we're enlightened don't we but we want to make sure that we're walking in the light that this scripture is talking about and so we have to nail down what is that light so let's go to the scriptures first first john 1 verse 5 and this is what we just read it says this then is the message which we have heard of him of christ and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all so that scripture says that god is light but if we go to psalms 119 105 it says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my past so now we have god is light then we have the word of god is light and so that gives us a little fuller viewpoint and then john 1 very familiar scripture probably my favorite scripture it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was it in the beginning with god all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life that was in him was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it enough means the darkness did not overcome it so now we've got a word in the beginning and then we've got the word is god and then the word is a light to my path and then it says the word was made flesh in christ and so christ is life and now the life of christ is the light of men so we have light equals god equals word equals christ equals life equals light of men that's a lot of different things for light to be if you were to say today what is light they'd say well whatever's coming out of this light bulb or that light bulb or a different light bulb that's light or whatever is coming out of the sun or these different things that's light but when we look in the word we see that life is manifested in many different ways and then there's not just a single flashlight a scriptural flashlight that shows light amen it comes in different ways because why light is an expression of god and we even when we look at god we have god the father god the son god the holy spirit those are expressions of god it's ways that god shows and reveals himself or ways that he acts but they are all one and the same god so when we look at light if light is the same thing as god then we know that light is going to also have different expressions or manifestations amen the very first thing god did was what he created light the very first creative act was light it wasn't to bring these this into existence or that into existence it was light and light doesn't have it's not solid it's not tangible light is one of the strangest things i won't go into it it just came to me but light acts like a wave and light acts like a particle and it's the only thing in the world that does those things it can bend it can turn it can be affected by gravity and yet it's an amazing thing its properties are very strange in the in the physical world amen but the very first thing that god did as a creative act as we see in scripture was light it was the pillar of fire amen brother branham says this he says let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of the space where there's nothing he's going back to genesis 1 1 and 2 and 3. he says let's make it a little white light like a mystic light like a halo and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father amen a son cannot be an original it cannot be an original has to be created amen it has to come from something and brother brahm says god gave birth to himself and that he made himself a body to step into because he's a spirit he gave himself something to be seen and manifested in and he says that was the son and he called that christ right he called that he called that the son of god amen and that's what was in the beginning that was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was god and then out of god came the logos a part of god that went out of god so again we have all these descriptions we've got the light of god equals equals the word equals christ equals life equals the light of men and we want to make sure that we don't miss where that light is in each and every manifestation amen because if you look through the scripture you'll see that people got tripped up a lot of times because they didn't recognize god in its in his time and place brother brahm goes as far as to say noah was god's light right and all these different ones were god's light but there's not like i said a god flashlight that you can identify that's a flashlight that's identified in the scripture that means that's god's that's the light of the day it's not that simple unfortunately amen so god doesn't change and the light of god doesn't change but how and where that light is manifested is what changes and that's what you've got to be if you're going to walk in the light you've got to see where is god's light today amen so the light changes in that it goes from this one to this one or this way or that way or this person or this ministry or these different things and every time you've got to be able to catch the the light as it turns a corner and goes another way as it steps into another vessel as it steps into another message as it steps into another ministry you've got to be able to grasp those things so watch how this works and this is just a very simple example of this but we could see it all through the light all through the scripture amen so this is jesus talking about john he says ye sent unto john and he bear witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from men but these things i say that ye might be saved speaking of john he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light so he's speaking to his own disciples he says look john was a john was a light he isn't a light now but he was a light and while he was a light you were happy for that time to rejoice in his light okay that phrase a burning and a shining light says that means that he was a continuously burning lamp that projected light and the key point there is that you can't just have the light you've got to project the light what did jesus say you what man that that has a candle and puts it under a bushel right you don't have it and then hide it right and god doesn't do that he doesn't give you light so that you can hide it but if you have it you have to project it that's the requirement if you're going to have the light of god is it's got to be projected amen it's no good if it's not showing outside of the vessel we're not looking for an inner light we're looking for a light that goes through to the outside amen so john's life john's ministry was a beacon to the people right you had all these priests you had the sadducees and the pharisees and they're going day in and day out and they're bringing the law to the people and they're bringing the law to the people and the people aren't getting anything out of it right nothing's happening it's a dead formal cold religion and then john walks out of the the wilderness and he's yelling prepare ye the way of the lord and he's yelling at the priests and the sadducees and he's saying you you vipers and you this and you that what's he doing he's saying something big is about to happen and he's shining a light in there in the darkness of the dead denominationalism that was going on there and he's saying you got to recognize guys something big is about to happen messiah is on his way he may even be here now i don't know he says but he is coming and i'm here to prepare the way for him i'm not worthy to even undo his shoelace but he's coming listen up the time is now so he has a message and the light is in john's message right then amen and then the people had to catch that if they stuck with the pharisees and sadducees they couldn't move on but if they get out onto john's message now all of a sudden they've got a chance to walk in the light i mean they've got a chance for god to do something with them but john's only got a forerunner's message he's not the light but he has light in him he's the light of god for his day the anointing of god is on john john has the holy spirit the scripture says right john has the holy spirit on him he's a forerunner of what's coming and he's preaching now something's coming and you better catch a hold of it but jesus says after the fact john was a light but he's no longer a night anymore what does jesus say after this right john chapter one the next day so this is speaking of john it says the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water john had no idea jesus was the messiah until this very moment and their cousins right their cousins and he has no idea that this is a messiah but as soon as jesus comes in john identifies him and how does he do it he says and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him so he said the holy spirit comes down and it sits on that man and that's how i know that he's the son of god and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water which was god himself the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he says behold the lamb of god now watch what happens here now and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus so jesus testifying of john says john was a light but john's light went out why because the anointing now goes from john to somebody else the thing that john is prophesying about the thing that john is warning about has now come so john's message is over john has no message so we look here in verse 37 says this two disciples heard them speak and they follow jesus that seems a little bit cold doesn't it oh they've been with john for years and they've been his disciples and they've served him they followed him faithfully and they've gone through the trials and tribulations and john says behold the lamb of god and they leave him but that's what a believer does is that when they recognize the fulfillment of the ministry then they follow the fulfillment they don't stay with the ministry amen they're moving with the light of god as the light of god moves they're walking in the light they're not just saying i recognize john they're saying i recognize the the fulfillment of john's message and on that basis i'm going to keep moving on from john and john doesn't worry about it he says what i must decrease and he must increase why because his message has now been fulfilled what god had said was going to happen has happened john doesn't have a message anymore and he basically just goes around antagonizing people until his head gets cut off why i must decrease and he's got to increase because the light is moving on the anointing is now on somebody else amen and jesus acknowledges that he says he was a bright and shining light but he isn't anymore the lights moved on to who where does it go jesus said john 8 12 then spake jesus unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so jesus said the light was with john john was the light but now i'm the light the light is with me it was with him you had to hear him to see me but as soon as you saw me you had to move to me because this is where the light is now and if you stick with me you won't walk in darkness but if you stuck with john even though you recognize john's ministry you be in darkness now because you haven't made the step change that god is is moving in the word amen but there's an effect that happens with this amen it says there he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he didn't say that about john's ministry john's ministry didn't have this effect it didn't disperse darkness but what it did do is point to something else that was coming there was a light there that revealed something that was coming it was a prophetic light showing what's going to come but if you walked in john's ministry that didn't have the light of life in it it was just bringing you to the place of light of life amen it was pointing you to something but it wasn't that thing right john's way gave me gave john's message gave way for a message that would remove your sin that would eliminate its effect over you john says i'm i'm baptizing you unto repentance but he says here's one that's going to baptize you what with the holy ghost john's just trying to get the people's hearts ready but he says there's someone's coming that's going to change your life right not just clean you up a little bit but this is one that's going to change you eternally amen and now the words what what happens to the light the light now goes from words in a man's mouth to flesh and that's what people miss every time is they miss it from going off the page of the scripture or off the spoken word of the minister the prophet or the whatever it might be and now becoming flesh that's the shift that everybody misses they can read it in the word they can hear it over the pulpit but they can't put it in a person that's where we fail every single time amen so now the light so just think about this this is going to maybe be a bit of an obvious thing but if the people have recognized john's message and they all they did was they kept playing john's tapes what good would it have done them they didn't have tapes they didn't have you know i know this but if all they had done is kept playing john's sermons in the river jordan day in and day out and day in and day out if they recognize john as a prophet minister as a prophet messenger and they kept playing his tapes but they didn't recognize it when jesus came then what good would it have done them amen amen does that make sense because why that's where a message church is going to fail every time amen is they're going to say god sent a prophet but they haven't realized the light has moved on from the prophet amen the message is still right but the light didn't stay in that message it's now moved from words on a page to a people amen amen and that's what jesus is talking about so he says look i've got the light but then jesus says there's going to be a shifting now because i'm going to leave the light that you've recognized the light that you accept is going to leave so what's what's going to happen now where's the light going to go matthew 5 it says ye are the salt of the earth and if the salt have lost his savior wherewith shall it be salted it's thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid remember what we said if you've got the light inside of you it has to be visible it's no good to have it inside but it's not seen on the outside the purpose of light is to show things and then we read that scripture in ephesians that which maketh manifest his light the thing that reveals is light light has a purpose and is not to be hidden amen is to be used so it says ye are the light of the world so this is all this is only in matthew 5. this is early in jesus ministry and he says you are the light of the world but he just said he was the light of the world but now he's saying ye are neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick they elevate it right and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so jesus comes to the point now and he's speaking prophetically here right jesus is speaking prophetically he says i'm the light but ye are the light now if you looked at them after jesus left they were not the light not initially were they because jesus dies peter denies him in the courtyard before he ever gets crucified they're scattered all over the place they're hiding in the rooms until he comes out and then even after jesus is resurrected and and ascends in these things they're still hiding in an upper room right there is no shining of a light there is no city on a hill experience here what is it the light is is not in their hands yet but yet jesus says you are the light he's prophesying that there's going to come a time where this light is going to go for me and it's going to shift onto you and you guys are going to take my place on this earth so they're up there and they're all huddled in the upstairs right they're hiding from the authorities they're hiding from the priests it doesn't look very much like the light is coming out does it but then they have the pentecostal experience where the baptism of the holy ghost happens for the first time on a group of people and peter comes out and within the first hour he converts 3 000 people that's what a city on a hill looks like that's what a candle that's been pulled out from under the bushel looks like is when the light is lit by the power of god then there's nothing that's going to hold it back and all of a sudden you see peter makes a dramatic shift now from hiding upstairs to going out and speaking boldly and remember the the priest came to them and they tried to hold them back they said we're going to put you in jail you can't preach about jesus and what they do they walked right out the door and they started preaching about jesus there was no holding them back when that light had come to fulfillment and the prophecy that jesus speaks of here had become a reality amen jesus christ the man was gone but now he had a new body and it was called the church amen the elect the called out ones and there was where the light was now so again you recognize jesus as the messiah but you don't you've got to make the corner and say all right that was light but now where's the light because again you could sit there and you could pray jesus tape all day long but the light had moved into a prophet called paul and now he comes and he starts to set the church in order he starts to correct the mistakes he starts to set them on a foundation a perfect love for the next seven church ages and if all you did was sat there and listened to jesus's words you're gonna have a problem because now jesus is speaking through a prophet right you had to keep moving you can't stand there and wait on jesus's words you can't play jesus messages over and over because jesus is speaking again and he's speaking through a prophet now named paul and the disciples in these different things amen so if every the easy criteria for asking if you're walking the light is are you pointing backwards or are you pointing to here or are you pointing forward because if you're pointing back you're not walking in the light you've got to be pointing to today and it's got to be leading you into tomorrow amen that's how you know if you're walking in the light like i said that's where message churches fail so often is that they're pointing back to a day where the prophet was the only thing that god was moving in right and he was having healings and this and that and the other thing and so when all what they're doing is all they're doing is they're playing a tape what are they doing they're saying god's still back there god's not here anymore god's not moving in ministry right the very the very thing that the prophet said the bride has a five-fold ministry amen that that is the bride's ministry the very prophet that said it they don't hear that and so they play a tape over and over again and what are they saying the holy ghost no longer moves on men the holy ghost no longer moves on women in that way that it stopped when that prophet died in 1965 and the word of god is not being opened or expressed anymore you just have to listen to those tapes what happened they haven't made the corner they haven't turned the corner because it had to come off of those message tapes they had to come off of those message books and show us the light of the word and make it jump off the page so that it could be revealed in us each one amen what don't get stuck at william branham you can't get stuck at he was it you got to go on on to the where the light says you are it right the lights moved on and where is it it's in a bride of christ now amen amen the message is still true this is how rumors get started right john said brother branham is obsolete no no i'm saying the message is true right jesus words were true but you have to take all that jesus said otherwise you wouldn't recognize paul coming otherwise you wouldn't recognize the baptism of the holy spirit you wouldn't recognize the pentecostal experience jesus told us all those things and then it happened and then you had a prophet comes he says all these things are going to happen he points us back he restores paul's message and he tells us these are all the things that are going to happen for the bride so why are we looking at william branham he came for a bride he came to prepare a bride he came to bring a bride to introduce her to jesus christ and if we're sitting here talking about william branham all day long then what's happened we've missed the light of jesus christ that's in our mid statement that's working and drawing a bride to himself amen why because the message is never words it's always a person it's always got to be a person the message is always going to be a person the word has always got to be a person that was the point of all this was to make it a reality in our lives not just leave it as dead words on a page amen and it has to keep moving because what does the scripture say that that life that life light life was the light of men a life right it's got to be living it's got to be moving it's got to be breathing it's constantly going forward and that's why it says walk in the light it doesn't say stand in the light says you got to walk in the light because it's continually growing continually drawing us up to christ amen but paul doesn't just leave it at the apostles because that's what's so easy to say as well the pentecostal thing and this is what brother branham dealt with in his day wasn't it they said divine healing was only for that day and the power of god was only for the apostles brother braham says no sir why because paul didn't say that paul didn't say it was only for the apostles it was for everyone i mean the baptism of the holy ghost if you've got the holy ghost and i've got the holy ghost then there's no difference now there's gifts and callings and we know that men have great gifts of healing and faith and these different things discernment and whatnot that's different but every single one of us has the same god within us and every one of us has the same option the same authority the same power to cast satan out to heal to change situations all of these things amen it's all within the bride this is paul talking about us now he says but ye brethren are not in darkness now this is to the thessalonians that's not just men that's a bunch of people this is to a church he says you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not a we we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober amen so the elect church the bride of christ are children of light we come from god we come from god light right and therefore we are light what we are is what our father is right so for children of light we ought to be from a father of light amen guess what there's a scripture that says that james chapter 1 says do not air my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from who the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning means there's no change there's no darkness there's nothing that that flickers with the light of god right there's not this pulsing thing you know like a campfire or something or you know as a battery wears out on a flashlight and it starts to dim and then flicker and these different things with god it's just solid light all the time and it's never changing of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be the kind of first fruits of his creatures and then so paul or james is saying look every good and perfect gift comes from above and it's from the father of lights but who's he talking about he's talking about children of light he says it's coming from the father of lights amen none good as brother joel says except god himself so he says anything good you have in your life which is something that is of god must come from god and god only gives you things that he's going to use amen that's something for him to use amen and any kind of gift is going to be anything from god is something that projects the life and the love of god right that's it's got to project god a gift of god is going to project god because it's going to have a supernatural it's going to have a scriptural it's going to have a heavenly purpose it's not just for earthly good amen now brother brandon preaches this ceremony called there's a man here that can turn on the light and most of us have probably read it or heard it at some point and brother branham's in there and he's talking he's telling this story you remember how they went into a cave and they were so deep into the cave that the only way that you could see in there was if they had the lights turned on and while they're in the middle of the tour of the cave the lights go out and nobody has a flashlight nobody has a candle nobody has anything and everyone's screaming and yelling and they're upset and they're scared and somebody says don't worry i know a man that can turn on the lights right and so when we read when we read that message when we hear that message we start to think that it's about taking away fear and taking away worry and these different things and that but there's a lot more in that sermon if you start to dig into it and i'm going to just use this as a bit of an example because we're talking about children of light here and brother brahms starts to show a little bit of what he's really trying to get at here because he's going to do a prayer line right and he's going to be praying for the sick and he's trying to build up the faith of the people but remember this is not a message just for the people of that day this is a message for a bride that's going to be coming and listening to this and they're going to be catching the deeper meaning behind this listen to these quotes as we go through he's here he says now the hour has come for this word to be vindicated he sends the light now this is what he says the light is the word made manifest like he did in the beginning he sends the word and it proves itself there's light and he always separates the same is now as eternal little lights in the beginning notice that little phrase there he says eternal little lights in the beginning who's that that's me and you right the sons of god shouting for joy before the foundations of the world he's talking now about a people he's not talking about turning on your faith he's not talking about turning on your healing only he's talking about turning on the eternal lights from the beginning now right it's time for those little lights he's talking about those little eternal lights to get turned on how by the power of god in their life this is what a messenger is bringing in this age is he's bringing the power of god back to its full restoration in a way that'll make you the light not just him the light amen right how do you separate light from darkness how do you separate light from darkness you turn the light on don't you how do you turn a light on if we have these light bulbs here let's say that's a child of god okay the light bulb's the child of god it has the potential for light but how do you actually get it to give light you got to turn it on don't you you got to put some source of energy to it right you've got to turn on the switch and once it's on now we've got light in the old days they had a candle you had to have a source of light to turn the light on right you had to light the candle you had to get a flame started and then once it was started it wouldn't go out but you still had to have that source and he's saying here this is about that this is about turning on those little eternal lights that were with god in the beginning he continues he says there is a man present don't get scared no matter what they say i've seen it come to the spot where i didn't know where to move next but he is always present the never failing presence he is always there he can turn on the light yes sir he's just waiting seeing what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to yes sir he says there's a man here can turn on the lights now this is what he's talking about turning on the lights from there are those who said in the regions of the shadow of death some of them now watch this some of them under cancer some of them under the death of denomination some of them under creed's death some of them under traditional death and all them kinds of death and they have seen a great light the man that flashed the lights then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light that same god yesterday today and forever he is present today right here now don't get scared he can turn on the lights so there's people there that are there for healing but he's saying this is not just about healing this is about getting you out of the darkness that you've been drawn into through denominationalism through dead traditions and these different things he's saying you need your light turned on and there's a man here that can do it and he's not just here to heal your bodies he's here to heal your souls right he's here to turn the light on that was there before the foundation of the world and he's just waiting to see what will you do amen he's preached the word amen the light for our day is shining but now he's talking about turning on the lights plural the light of the word is coming but he says let it light your light you are the lights let it light you up now let the power of god let the word of god have the effect on you that it's wanting to do but i'm saying there's a god here that can light you on fire there's a god here that can fill you with the holy ghost there's a god here that can make you just the way he saw you in the beginning amen there's a god here that can take you from a sinner to a saint there's a god here that can take you from sick to well there's a god here that can take you and make you his life for this day right it's not just about sickness it's not just about the difficulties we face he's wanting to make us his light for this day he's saying accept the light so you can be the light accept the words that i'm saying except the position that i'm laying before you accept what i'm laying in front of you and let god do a work in you that you'll never see if you stay where you are you've got to step into this light and then you've got to start walking in today man don't hold back don't resist he's saying trust god and let him do the work in you that he wants to do he says this to be a christian means to be christ-like today how many people that call themselves christians if you said are you christ-like they'd be able to say yeah that's me because most of them it's just formal right i go to church i'm identified with the bible in some form or fashion i am a christian but if you said are you christ-like in every facet they'd probably not be able to say that amen they'd hem and ha they'd put it for another day they'd say that's not required today things have changed amen but there's no variable this there's no shadow of turning in the light that we're talking about it doesn't change he says no go go no place you wouldn't want to be if christ would come remember the service the other day where i said if christ was coming tomorrow what would you change how many of us did it how many of us did what dropped into our heart after that service or during that service and said lord i won't do that i'll put that away i'll put that friend away i'll put that situation away so brother i'm saying here he's saying dude don't go any place you wouldn't want to be if christ would come say nothing you wouldn't want to be saying when christ comes ouch amen if you some of the things we say if christ were to come down right at that moment what would we be thinking is that a rapture ready thought doing nothing that you wouldn't want to be doing when christ comes that's a that's a great metric to go by isn't it what am i doing if christ came right now what would he think what would he say think nothing so we've moved from doing now to thinking even think nothing you wouldn't want to be thinking when christ comes keep your one motive your heart centered on calvary amen walk in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen the father of lights is trying to turn on the lights for this age and he sent a prophet to do it amen that prophet's message is still here amen to open the word to us to quicken us to show us the things that are meant for us but brother bram says he's waiting to see what you're gonna do with it amen but one thing as i pointed out with peter once he turns on that light it'll never go up that's the beautiful thing is once you give in once you give him that opportunity when you sincerely come to him and say lord i'm going to let you turn on my light he'll turn it on and it'll never go out peter never walked back peter vacillated a lot amen he walked on the water and he sank in the water and he was out there drawing a sword and chopping off ears and proclaiming that he'd never leave christ and then denying him you know a couple days later but once he got his fire once he got his fire lit it never went out after that aim and it didn't matter what they did to him didn't matter what they tried to do to him what they threatened him with he never stopped until he gave his very life for christ amen and he said i won't even be crucified the way he was i'm going to go upside down that's a man that's confident where he's going amen to accept a death like that amen he never deserted it why not why didn't he do it brother braham says it this way he says i ask the question a christian as in what is a christian he says that's christ in you so it's not just christ like now he says a christian is when christ is in you and if christ is in you then the word is in you and then if the word is in you when the light is shining how are you going to walk out of it see that's the question that's what's in now the light the evening light's shining the bride tree is blooming like i said once that fire's lit it never goes out right once he's done a work he doesn't ever pull it back doesn't ever put it out he's always going to be there am i dim at times we'll talk about that a little bit later it might get dim at times things might be surrounding it a bit trying to block it out trying to hide it from view but the fire will never go out the light never goes out amen and then we read in the opening scripture about how god is light and i want to go back to that just for this last half of the sermon here amen because we want to make it we want it this is where we really want to get personal with it so this is first john 5 1 5 it says this then is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all amen there's no variables variableness or shadow of turning if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth doesn't say we know not the truth it says we do not the truth amen knowing it and not doing it it's not going to get you very far is it amen so the first effect of the light of god in your life is that there won't be darkness there all right there's total separation from darkness why what is darkness darkness is not created by itself you cannot get a dark light you can get a flashlight but you can't get a dark light darkness is defined by the absence of light if light is not there then you have darkness but if light is there by definition darkness cannot be there amen that's what he's saying is look you can't say you're in the light and have darkness at the same time it's like saying i'm sweet and sour at the same time it's like saying i have salty water and fresh water at the same time scripture says that can't happen can't get salty water and sweet water from the same fountain amen and then so spiritually speaking darkness is the absence of god right because it says god is light so spiritually speaking if god is in your life there can't be darkness there can't be sin there can't be unbelief there can't be these different things and like brother brahm said just a second ago he said a believer can't get out of the light because the light is in them right but now what's satan going to try and do because if he can't put out the light then what's he got to try and do cover it right he's going to try and put up barriers he's going to try and put up blockades he's going to try and put up walls and roofs and these different things over that light in your life so that that can't be seen and then he's got a great access weight to it as we've covered before because he's got a body that is completely unredeemable right and he's got a mind and he's got a spirit that he can work through to try and attack us so what he's trying to do is build up blockages in there he's trying to put things on us that will hold up our testimony and then he's trying to put things in our way that will keep us from expressing the purity of the word of god amen but to counteract that what happens because i want to be careful here because you can look at this and you can say well brother i've got a bad habit in my life does that mean i don't have the holy spirit no not at all has nothing to do with it in fact but what happens is as satan is trying to walk through and build these things up around you the holy spirit is going around trying to knock them down amen so we have all these different doors in our life and the holy spirit once you get it starts walking around in your life and it's got a flashlight and it's knocking on the door and then it's going in it's shining around saying what do we have inside here right that's what's happening in there and the question is is there a lock on the door are you on the inside holding it as tight as you can because you don't want the holy spirit to see what's in there or are you going to let it in and say absolutely come in here and yeah there's some things in here i don't want you to see but it's better that we get rid of this now rather than deal with the effects later satan's trying to get you to keep the door shut the holy spirit say no no let's go in here let's shine the light let's see what's really going on in this portion of your life amen that's the battle that's going to be happening there so you say i've got a bad habit yes have you let the holy spirit in there and let him have a look let him have it let him have some time to deal with it rather than just buried under and say i have no sin as the scripture says right i don't have any problems i don't have any issues right that's a hypocrite right it's not a hypocrite to say lord i have faults and failures it's a hypocrite to say i don't but paul says look if you're stuck in unbelief if your life doesn't reflect the life of christ you don't have the holy ghost it's literally that simple he says look you can't have light and darkness at the same time and if when i look at your life i see darkness not light then there's a problem right you can't say you have the holy ghost here you don't have the life and the light of god in you yet there's got to be a separation of that darkness in that light and it only comes by the light how do you separate it right god in the beginning separated the light from the darkness and that's again what god is doing he says that's what he did in the beginning and that's what he's doing now god separates light from dark in the beginning he said let there be light now remember there can be no light outside of the word of god the very sun out there is the word of god vindicated there was gross darkness upon the earth fog and mist upon the earth and god said let there be light now what if no light came then it wouldn't do them no good to speak but when he said let there be light and light came into existence vindicating that his word was right that light we live by today now he's speaking of the natural sun here because we live by the natural sunlight on the earth right all botany life is it well almost all of it requires light sun goes out we have what eight eleven minutes before we die i think is the way it works it takes that long for the light and the heat to get here then you lose the residual heat of the earth and then we all just become big popsicles so we live by the light of the sun but now he makes the transition he says and the only light we can have today in the church is god vindicating his light in this generation amen it's not just words he says it's vindicating so there's a reality that has to come god at the beginning separated the light from the darkness he has always done that what does he do he presses that by the coming light he presses the darkness to the other side of the earth if you've ever seen a satellite video of the earth as the sun is rotating around the as the earth is rotating around the sun you'll see what happens is as the earth rotates that light pushes the darkness further and further and further and it just goes around around the world why because the light as earth turns that light is chasing darkness all the way around he says it's the same thing the light of the word is in there and it's going to chase darkness all the way all in and out of your life and there's going to be a chasing going on why to push it out because the light's got to have preeminence and then the light's got to dominate in your life he says and that's exactly what's coming to pass now it's just before day the morning star has come out to hail the day coming and the holy spirit is showing its light it's coming at a time when the dark light and darkness will have to be separated one from the other now listen to this he says the church and its order will take the order of the day and christ and his light word promise will go in the rapture that's the total separation of light and darkness right he's saying listen you've been on the earth long enough bride of mine now it's time for the light to come up here because total darkness now is going to come down on the earth right that's the only thing that's left for them to do it's a day today is the dawn of a new day for many who are looking for his coming so he says there's got to be a separation of light and darkness but what we see today is people that are trying to blend light and darkness right when you look at a denominational christian then what are they trying to do they're trying to take part of the word and part of the world and they're trying to put it together and make it work and it can't work that way amen you can't have both those things simultaneously and it produces a true light something's got to give something's got to something's got to give way to the other amen you can't have a little bit of god in your life it's got to be all god amen it's a it's a life or death situation it's an all or nothing amen said this in first corinthians he says know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump now we're not all bread makers here but my wife is a bread maker and when you put leaven in right if you put yeast in you don't have to put very much in do you you put in just a little bit and then it spreads through the whole thing because yeast are crazy little boogers and they just grow and grow and grow and they spread out throughout that whole thing don't they a little bit of leaven a little bit of yeast goes a long ways right he says once you get it in there the whole thing's tainted or if you want it it's a good thing right obviously for for bread but you can put in a little and then say well it's just a little now no he says it grows it magnifies itself and it ruins the whole thing or it fills out the whole thing purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a lu a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us well we might think well they have some of the words so isn't that light in their life right they accepted a little bit here and they accept a little bit there isn't that light it's not what the scripture says it's not what the prophet taught us amen to reject the light of god is to accept the blindfold of satan and all you're doing is you're saying they've got a couple pinpricks through there that let light through and somehow that means that they've got sight they don't they've got enough to just blind them amen that's the only thing they've got there amen they become immune to the word of god but the brahm said any man who rejects the light receives the same thing that they did become midnight blackness to them the same light that was made a light for the children of israel to walk by blinded the eyes of pharaoh and his army and the same holy ghost gospel that you call nonsense that'll carry the church to glory but it darkens the eyes of the modern theologian tonight amen blinds them to what god is doing the same holy ghost in power that resurrected jesus christ that's in this building tonight blinds the eyes of the modern day preacher and his church we've been reading brother branham's life story for years now i feel like and it's amazing how many people would come into those meetings and they'd say that's not god and they'd see person after person walk away healed healed healed healed they'd see the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart and him i mean you didn't even have to stand by him he'd turn his back and do all these things and discern it and they'd look at it and they'd say that is not god it's like what are you doing like literally it's like jesus said look if you can't believe my words believe my works what are you doing look at what i'm doing you say you've got everything and you can't do anything and you're saying i have nothing and yet i'm doing everything there's a problem here there's a paradox in your argument right and he says here the same holy ghost said resurrected jesus christ that's in this building tonight blinds the eyes of the modern day preacher and his church and that's the thing that's blinded them has given light since the resurrection of jesus in the day of pentecost god will do it can you explain it no i can't explain it i can't explain the way god does things i mean i can't even explain the gift that's inside of me why do i i couldn't even try and fathom some of the things god does amen the the perfection and the sovereignty of god to move in our lives and to change things to set things up it boggles me it blows my mind how god can do things amen and when i see a ministry like william branham's and somebody comes behind that says that he's off the word listen something's wrong there something's wrong something's wrong god will do it can you explain it but if you don't accept light it'll become darkness to you and i think it's because we're trying to explain it sometimes that we turn it away we can't explain it and so we say that's not for me it'll become darkness to you you'll criticize it that's what's happened isn't it they couldn't explain it so they'll criticize it they'll call it holy roller and you might as well have a millstone hanged at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea he says you blasphemed the holy ghost and there's no forgiveness god help us god help each one we've seen what's happened you know in this day with believe the sign and these different ones there's a minister sat at my table in edmonton and i see now he's putting videos on youtube about why he's left the message this is a very well-known man his grandmother was i believe healed miraculously in brother branham's services him and his father have been ministers for decades after decades since brother brahm left and he's just walked away he blasphemed the holy ghost amen it's a scary thing to do brother braham says there is no forgiveness look every man that rejects light goes blind and walks in darkness because you don't accept the light amen god sends ministers that preach the gospel he sends signs and wonders among men to vindicate it to be the truth and men reject it there's nothing left but darkness for you he says walk in the light while the light is shining my brother receive the light christ is the light he's come to bring light to you it's not just to shine it but it's to bring it to you so that you can be the same thing but those who rejected light receive darkness and every man and woman tonight who rejects light walks in darkness not knowing where he's going he's staggering along pretty good popular with the people but i wonder how he stands in the presence of god right rich and increased with goods and think you have need of nothing he says you're poor miserable blind wretched naked and know it not that's what they're doing they're saying we've got it we've got it we've got it and he's saying you don't have anything but you think you do right you think you do i mean like i said the gospel of jesus is an all or nothing proposition you can't walk half in and half out can't step in step out step in step out amen as we've read in the scriptures you have to choose life right choose life that you might live stay in it amen we have to go all the way and stay in it and eat it and drink it and feed on it and speak it and live it and then until what it becomes a daily reality in every single one of our lives amen once god has opened the word to you once he's revealed his requirement to you this is what this message did right it showed god's requirement show god what and and then from that point what does god do he holds us responsible for it once he has said it we're held responsible for it and it's that simple he lays it in your lap that's what brother gerald has said so many times he says i'm going to lay it in the people's lap so brother braham said i'll lay it in their lap and it's up to you what you do with it but now i'm not responsible i've given it to you now it's your responsibility for what you do to it amen and if you obey it it's life and it's light right and if you disobey what is it it's death if you're a believer it's not death it's pain or it's death in this sense and let me put it this way it's separation from god and you know what happens is you go into your prayer closet and you've got a steel roof right and your prayers are going up and they're bouncing off and god doesn't hear it right you're separated from the fellowship of god and we're not going to touch on fellowship tonight this is going to be at least a two-part series okay we're not going to go in there tonight but what happens is you're separated from god in that you lose the fellowship don't lose your soul right your eternal destination has not changed but you lose the fellowship because you're not walking the light you're not obeying what he's told you to do right and so your prayers are hitting the ceiling they're bouncing right back to you and you're sitting there saying what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong and he's saying look i told you what to do just do it all right amen we tend to think of darkness as you know oh i'm doing something i shouldn't do or this you know i i'm around people i shouldn't or i've got this habit or i've got this situation but that's not always what darkness is sometimes it's when god says come here do this or do that and we don't do it then we're going into darkness because we're disobeying what he's asked us to do right it's not all bad we don't want to look at this as a you know as the light has always been a thing that's bad because oh it's showing me all the negative side of me and the things that he needs to work on and that's not all it at all i mean god's trying to lead us he's trying to guide us he's trying to bring us through this life and he's saying walk with me and there's going to be some tough things that i'm going to bring out here but there's going to be some amazing things that i'm going to bring out as well because light doesn't just show the bad it shows the good it shows the word of god it shows you your position in the word of god and so if you can listen to both if you can handle both of those sides then you're going to do pretty well amen if you can take not the criticism because he's not criticizing us for being weak for being you know for having sinner elements or for having an unredeemable body in these different things what he holds us accountable for is when we won't do anything about it when we won't give him access to do something about it he's not mad at us because we're we're in sinful flesh he gets angry when we don't allow him to do something about it amen amen this is jesus he says remember the words that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they also they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me now listen to this he says if i had not come and spoke unto them they had not sinned but now they have no cloak for their sin he's the light he didn't come to judge jesus said i came to save he came to say but if you turned him down it turned into judgment and what he's speaking of is he's speaking of the sadducees and the pharisees men in general but especially those priests he says look they were fine until i came and exposed them for what they were and they didn't change and now they have no cloak for their skin it's for their sin there's nothing now to hide them from the eyes of the people the people can see what they really were and they're going to keep seeing what they are because i've hidden them and now there's no ignorance right god winked at ignorance but now the lights come it showed you what you are it showed you where the weaknesses are it showed you where the problems are and now it's up to you if you're going to handle it or not and they couldn't handle it amen and they put them to death but he says until that point they'd have gotten away with it and they did get away with it right because they were under the law and as long as they kept doing the law then they were okay as long as they kept sacrificing that lamb and these different things they were okay but when the lamb of god comes and shows them that the light of god is moving on and they reject it they're out all right he says and now you've got no covering you can't put a jacket on now you can't put your clothes on and hide the fact that you're a sinner i've completely exposed you for who and what you are and until you come to this light you'll continue to be that way you'll be you'll be open for everyone to see it's the emperor has no clothes all over again right right brother braham says this he says i was preaching one time in a methodist church and i said smoking cigarettes is not a sin committing adultery is not a sin taking the lord's name is not sin it was too much for one sister she raised up and said pray tell me reverend branham what is sin i said unbelief you do those things because you do not believe that's exactly now listen to this he says the reason you refuse to walk in the light of the word is because you disbelieve the word he says and that makes you an unbeliever amen now this sounds all very dark very sobering but like i said it's not all dark and sobering when we're talking about the light a lot of it can be judgment but guess what he's not here to judge a bride this is our time of judgment it's true right this is when the bride is tried and tested and it's proven what's in her right but now it moves on because we're going to judge the saints right and that's only because we're here as light shining for him we are the witness that judges the people of our age amen and guess what i'm not going to judge the people that were in the 1600s that wasn't my age i'm going to judge the people in the 2000s and you know and and these different things why because that's my age that's when i was my witness right there's got to be a reality of god in me and it's going to be because i believe that word and i've accepted it and it's going to because i let that light have a complete work inside of me i've let god's word into every part of my life amen hey we're children of lights we're children of light and we come from a father of lights that's a good thing right we're not children of darkness we're not children of sin we're not we're not a child of hell so this light is going to be a good thing in our life but it's not always going to feel good is it if you're a christian and you've been filled with the holy ghost you know this is not an easy walk this is not a difficult this is a difficult walk in that it's going to test and it's going to try your courage it's going to test your patience in ways that you have never it's going to test your love right all in ways that you never expected that it was going to why that's the difficulty of the light is as it's going to bring out the darkness but it's going to drive it out amen it's going to press it out of your life and what's left is going to be a good thing ephesians 5 tells us all about it says but ye were sometimes darkness we were right but now ye are light in the lord then he says walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord so look at this if god is dropping things into your life and you're responding to them the right way and you are quick to hear and obey it has a beautiful effect on you and paul says here he says the fruit of the spirit is what all goodness all righteousness all truth where in your life in your job in your marriage in your home in your relationships in your church in your ministries all of this is what the light is doing in your life because it's pushing out darkness and it's bringing the fruit of the spirit out and replacing the things that were so jumbled up and so messed up before amen right because god proves his word by bringing it to pass and if you'll let the word come in then the word is going to bring forth what it said it was going to do and then it's not coming to judge you it's coming to cleanse you and then we're cleansed by the washing of water by the word so it's going to have a good effect it's just that not all washing feels so good who's that comedian i heard this very briefly the other day on the radio remember there was that christian community talked about that that homeless man was or something that was a bit different and and god was working on him he used this man to really develop this man's character he was all dirty and everything he had the guy and and you know he did little bits with them he had him over for supper and these different things and whatnot and then god said take him to disneyland with his family and so he did i think his name was norman anyways he talks about one day he said norman how about we give you a bath and he said you know we got norman in the bath you know and he said we started to put the water on and you know we poured the water on it got very dirty we let it out we put another one in more and more he says and then i put some shampoo in his hair i started to rub around and normally he says and pretty soon i realized that his hair was not brown it was white it had just never been washed you know in such a long long time what norman wasn't too sure about the bath but once norman got into the bath and started seeing the effect of the bath pretty soon norman was okay with the bath right why he just needed somebody to sit there and give him a little bit of time develop a bit of trust with him and then get him to the place where he could clean up his life a little bit you know this man wasn't all there right he was a little bit simple in these different things but he says pretty soon i saw and then the white hair started to come up you know and all of a sudden norman gets out he doesn't recognize himself in the mirror because he looks so different what is it the washing of water right and it's no different for us you know we're pretty stinky we're pretty dirty in some places in our life and just because we've come to christ and accepted him does not mean that we're clean as in literally clean the blood of jesus is what covers us but there's a cleansing of the washing of water and that's the thing that we've got to submit to and sometimes it's not always a gentle rubbing on your scalp is it sometimes you got to take the pressure washer out because you got stuff that's gummed up and so hard and crusty in your life that he's really got to get at it amen right he's got a chip at it and he's really got a knock at it and we've got to be able to sit there and take that but the ideal situation is the guy going hmm while you rub your scalp right let it in easy don't let it get to the point where he's got to get in there and start knocking it off amen what it's showing you who you are norman didn't realize what he was until that guy really started showing him hey you're actually a normal person you know you've got real qualities inside of you you can be clean these different things and the light of the word is doing the exact same thing in our lives a minute showing us who you are showing you what you're made for showing you what your purpose is amen the light of the word today is calling us to be overcomers so it's going to show us in an overcoming light that's what we're going to be walking in day in and day out day in and day out and it's going to be what putting every satanic pressure and influence under our feet because it can't stand in the light of the word it's going to be pushing the darkness out and all that's going to be left is the light of the word and that's going to give you the faith that you need to get out of here amen first john 5 verse 4 says for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith brother braham said this no matter how little if you're a little wash woman that could be all of our sisters staying home washing our clothes and cleaning up the house and these different things okay put yourself in there or if you're just a brother that doesn't know his abcs don't make any difference who you are you are in christ triumphed over all things and your authority is over every demon and every power that the devil has you're in christ triumph and then how are you going to realize that unless you're walking with him every day amen because if you start standing and looking around then you start to get a little worried right but if you keep walking if you keep putting one foot in front of the other you don't have too much time to take in your surroundings because you're too busy staying with him and looking at what he's showing you and looking what he's showing you and then when he's showing you those things and something steps in front of you and then you remember in in pilgrim's progress right and christian's going there and there's the two lions standing there and they're they're trying to get at him and they're blocking the path and he's scared to go past until he recognizes that if he just stays right in the middle then he'll be fine and he walks through and the claws of the lines are just inches away from him but he's in the path and when the light is there to show him that there's a pathway through he keeps walking and those lines can't touch him amen it's the same thing here when you're walking in the word when you're walking with god daily when your prayer life is good when you're reading the word when you're listening to the messages when you're dwelling on the good things of god then what happens is it starts to show you a light through everything that you're going through and starts to show you that satan has no no hold on you right he can't touch you he can't block you he can't hold you back he can't trip you up it's going to keep exposing him time in and time out and it's going to start exposing you in a good way showing you that god is with you god is in you god's got your back and god's going to carry you through amen amen it's a walk it's not a christian stand still it's a christian walk and we've got to keep moving we've got to keep pressing the battle amen our lives are continuously being sanctified you know if there's one thing i've recognized you know i'm 41 years old and there's still sanctification going on because as god presses in other things have to give way because i only have so much time in my life i only have so much capacity to handle things in my life and so if i've got anything in there and god needs my time god needs my energy god needs my strength god needs my focus something else has to suffer so he's got to take something out and it's not that what i had was wrong it's that it's just taking up place that god needs in my life and so that's what sanctification is is it's not always taking out the bad things that's what initially it is right he's taking out the bad habits the bad friendships and these different things but then it moves into taking out the things that are holding back him having a greater effect in your life and that's where i see he's working more on me these days is because by now i should be pretty done with the bad stuff you know i would think but he's got lots to do to start chipping away those little things that are taking up the time sucking the time out of my life sucking the energy out of my life bringing a focus that is on things that are not of god amen amen we're not going to be ready for the rapture if we stand on our laurels and say i've repented i've been baptized and i've got the holy ghost and then we stand around waiting for christ to come take us home that's not the bride he's called for amen but the brahman said this israel had to keep journeying they were called out but he says they had to keep journeying when they stopped they backslid they had to keep moving every night they built a new fire every night just kept moving on and that's what we've got to do what luther had was fine that was for luther's day what wesley had was fine that was wesley's day what the holiness had that was fine that was their day we're living in another day and now we're moving on and there will be a day after us it'll come just the same but let's walk in the light while the light is here amen we're called to be a witness we're called to be a light to a wicked an adulterous nation and it's only going to happen if we're walking with him and day in and day out and then we're going to close with this brother bram says this he says the hour is here i listen when he says the hour is here because if the hour was here in 1964 the hour is done in 2021. we are so close amen the hour is here if i could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father said to me what day would you want to live i would say now right now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom oh the real church of the living god ought to be on fire burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them not just spoken over them we rejoice in the speaking of the word but he says no no no what you want is you are going to be on fire with the light of the gospel being vindicated among you in your life not just my life in all of our lives amen being vindicated why or how with god expressing his word day in and day out in your life amen giving you victory giving you strength giving you courage giving you the right motive and objective giving you love joy peace patience all the fruits of the spirit and signs and wonders following amen we want god's power moving in our midst in our lives amen when we lay hands on somebody when we pray for situations our expectation is god is going to move because it's a finished work if his word has said that he does it then we believe that it is a finished work and all we're doing is waiting for him to choose his time amen we want every single aspect of it amen i don't want to sit up here and and preach wonderful doctrine and beautiful sermons if we can even get me to that place but i want the power and demonstration of the holy ghost in the word that's going over this pulpit discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart healing the sick amen bringing out satan kicking him out of the people in this church him and we want that in every one of our lives as as priests of the house for our us us as husbands and fathers we should be able to do that in our very own homes amen we don't have to be a minister to do that we are each one called to do that amen the real church of the living god ought to be on fire burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them rise and shine for the light has come to you the light of this day isaiah was the light of his day noah was the light of his day why he had the word manifested say how did noah have the word manifested he said this is what's going to happen and then he made preparation so that it wouldn't take him down that's the word manifested is that it's preparing you to get out from under the judgment that's coming if you don't accept the light that you're speaking of and the gospel the bible words for this day is the light of the day he says what a glorious time that we are living and many musicians can come if they want amen he says what a glorious time that we are living but we have to be in the light it's not a glorious day if you're an unbeliever it's not a glorious day if you don't have the holy ghost it's not a glorious day if god's not moving and working in your life amen but as long as we welcome the light of god in our lives as long as that faith is being built up as long as he's cleaning us out as long as he's changing us as long as he's growing us then we have confidence him and then we can look up then we can say if he's going to come tomorrow i know he's going to take me because he's been working on me all this time and then i'm not sitting back i'm not relaxing you know we don't have sailing ships anymore but they said you know a ship doesn't sail on yesterday's wind and man i'm not sitting here relying on an experience i had yesterday i'm relying on the experience i have today and tomorrow and the next day and the next day and that's when we can look up with confidence and say this is the greatest day to be here because i know that he's working in me and i know he's going to finish it amen amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord your word has been a challenge for me bored and studying and ministering tonight but lord we're trusting or that these words will not just sit or that they would not go out and come back lord unfulfilled but lord we're trusting that your word will have the effect in our lives lord that it will draw us closer to you that it will keep us by your side lord that we'll push away everything lord will set off lord we'll put away every sin that sets a that weighs us down lord every besetting sin will push it aside lord
