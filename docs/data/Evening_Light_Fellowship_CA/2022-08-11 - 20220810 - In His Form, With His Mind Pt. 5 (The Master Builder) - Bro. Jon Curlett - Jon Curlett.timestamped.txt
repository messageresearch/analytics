[49:10] jesus christ's name we pray amen amen
[49:13] thank you musicians
[49:15] if you turn the scriptures to john
[49:16] chapter 14
[49:19] in john chapter 14
[49:23] and good to be back in the house of the
[49:25] lord this evening
[49:29] i'm not sure who ordered the rain but i
[49:30] think we needed it
[49:32] i never thought i'd say that in
[49:33] newfoundland that we needed the rain but
[49:36] i think we did so
[49:37] i'm grateful for it amen john chapter 14
[49:40] let's start at verse 12.
[49:42] it says verily verily i say unto you he
[49:45] that believeth on me the works that i do
[49:48] shall he do also and greater works than
[49:50] these shall he do because i go unto my
[49:53] father and we see here that jesus is
[49:55] pointing to a continuation of his works
[49:57] and the true believers amen that it's
[49:59] not just something that started and
[50:00] ended with him but he's going to
[50:02] continue to do those things through
[50:04] another group of people verse 13 says
[50:06] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[50:08] that will i do that the father may be
[50:10] glorified in the son
[50:12] if you shall ask anything in my name i
[50:14] will do it
[50:16] what a statement
[50:18] what a promise if you ask anything in my
[50:20] name i will do it
[50:22] and then he says if you love me keep my
[50:24] commandments and i will pray the father
[50:28] and he will give you another comforter
[50:31] that he may abide with you forever
[50:33] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[50:35] cannot receive
[50:37] because it seeth him not
[50:39] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[50:42] he dwelleth with you
[50:44] and shall be in you
[50:46] there he says dwelleth that means
[50:48] there's someone present
[50:50] and then he says shall be in the future
[50:52] he's saying what you have here with you
[50:54] today is what's going to be with you in
[50:56] the future it's the same christ in a
[50:58] different form
[50:59] amen he says i will not leave you
[51:01] comfortless can i get a just a move on
[51:03] the the slide there it's not really
[51:04] working back here thank you
[51:06] it says i will not leave you comfortless
[51:10] i will come to you it's hard to see a
[51:12] trinity in these scriptures isn't it
[51:14] yet a little while and the world seeth
[51:15] me no more but ye see me and because i
[51:18] live ye shall live also
[51:21] at that day you shall know that i am in
[51:23] my father
[51:25] and ye and me
[51:26] and i in you
[51:28] what day it's the day that he said in
[51:30] verse 19 the day that where he lives you
[51:33] live also
[51:34] and you see him he that hath my
[51:37] commandments and keepeth them he it is
[51:39] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[51:41] shall be loved of my father and i will
[51:43] love him and will manifest myself to him
[51:47] judas saith unto him not iscariot lord
[51:49] how is it that thou will manifest
[51:51] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[51:54] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[51:57] man love me
[51:58] he will keep my words
[52:00] and my father will love him and we will
[52:02] come into him and make our abode with
[52:06] him and then god bless you you can have
[52:07] your seats this evening
[52:10] god bless the reading of his word and
[52:11] we're going to get into our back to our
[52:13] our series in just a moment but before
[52:16] we do we have a uh
[52:18] an announcement to make so i got a
[52:20] message this afternoon
[52:22] and brother ellie wants to announce his
[52:24] engagement to sister rachel and bikay
[52:28] from montreal canada
[52:30] so he's been courting her since
[52:32] september of last year
[52:34] and they just uh got their engagement um
[52:37] it happened in as you can see in front
[52:39] of the eiffel tower in the city of love
[52:41] paris france and so they will be getting
[52:44] married september of next year and again
[52:47] in montreal canada so um i guess if
[52:50] anyone's wanting to go to the wedding
[52:51] this is the one to go to it's certainly
[52:52] a lot closer and a lot easier but he
[52:54] asked me to announce that to the church
[52:56] so he's going to spend a week when he
[52:57] comes back from paris
[52:59] in there
[53:00] just i guess making some arrangements
[53:02] and whatnot and then he'll be back again
[53:04] so he wanted me to announce that to the
[53:05] church he wanted me to thank brother
[53:06] gerald in particular because he says
[53:08] brother gerald tells him that he's been
[53:10] praying for him to find a great wife for
[53:12] many years so he's he's attributing all
[53:14] of this to brother gerald or at least a
[53:15] great deal of it to brother gerald so if
[53:18] anybody's looking to get married talk to
[53:20] brother gerald apparently his prayers
[53:22] work so anyways we certainly want to ask
[53:24] god's blessing to brother ellie and
[53:26] sister rachel i i like how they have
[53:28] rochelle and rachel for people like
[53:30] brother mark who can keep names straight
[53:31] so well
[53:32] so i'm sure we'll see many many fumbles
[53:34] with this as we move forward but uh and
[53:36] then god bless brother ellie and sister
[53:38] rachel
[53:39] amen we're gonna as i said continue with
[53:41] our series on in his form with his mind
[53:43] and i want to take a subtitle this
[53:45] evening of the master builder and we're
[53:47] starting to see now as we've read in our
[53:49] scripture that we're making the
[53:50] transition now from jesus christ in that
[53:53] in that fullness of the godhead bodily
[53:54] in that one body and he's talking about
[53:56] a time now where he's going to step into
[53:58] a multi-member body where he's going to
[54:00] do a continuation of his works where
[54:02] it's going to be in many people and he
[54:04] says they're going to see in you the
[54:05] very same things that they see in me and
[54:07] i'm going to be with you and i'm going
[54:08] to love you and you're going to keep my
[54:09] commandments and it's going to be this
[54:11] this great big wonderful building that
[54:13] i'm going to build amen and he calls it
[54:15] a church amen and we know that word
[54:17] church called means the called out ones
[54:20] and we've got a lot of different
[54:22] meanings for the word church these days
[54:23] certainly but jesus had a very
[54:25] particular meaning and unfortunately in
[54:27] most places that that word church has
[54:29] lost its meaning certainly the original
[54:31] meaning that that jesus had and if we go
[54:33] back to matthew 16
[54:35] he says in matthew 16 verse 15
[54:38] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[54:41] that i am
[54:42] and simon peter
[54:44] simon peter answered and said thou art
[54:46] the christ the son of the living god and
[54:48] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[54:50] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[54:53] blood had not revealed it unto thee but
[54:56] my father which is in heaven so he's
[54:57] saying it doesn't matter who you've been
[54:59] talking to who you've been
[55:00] fellowshipping with who your pastor is
[55:02] who the great ministries you've been
[55:03] around peter the great priest you've
[55:05] heard that is not who's revealed this to
[55:07] you this has come directly from the
[55:09] father in heaven and he says and i say
[55:11] also unto thee that thou art peter and
[55:14] upon this rock i will build my church
[55:16] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[55:18] against it this is where the word church
[55:20] is coming from originally and it's it's
[55:22] coming from jesus definition and it's a
[55:24] building or it's a body that he's going
[55:26] to build that's the definition of church
[55:28] and he's playing a little word game here
[55:30] because that word peter if you go back
[55:31] to the original language it means petra
[55:33] which is the word for rock and so he's
[55:35] playing he's playing a little game of
[55:37] words here and he's saying i'm going to
[55:39] build it on
[55:40] on this rock peter i'm going to build it
[55:42] on the rock rock or little rock and so
[55:45] we see the catholic church took this and
[55:47] they ran with it and they said that he
[55:48] was going to build the church on peter
[55:50] and they say that peter was the first
[55:52] pope and and he's the foundation of the
[55:54] of the catholic church and the true
[55:55] church of god and all these different
[55:56] things but that's not what jesus is
[55:58] talking about
[56:00] watch what happens here in verse 19
[56:02] because he says and i will give unto
[56:04] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[56:06] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[56:08] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[56:10] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[56:11] loosed in heaven
[56:12] then charged to his disciples that they
[56:14] should tell no man that he was jesus the
[56:16] christ it's amazing here that he says
[56:18] don't tell everybody the greatest
[56:20] revelation that you're going to need to
[56:21] have to be a member of this church
[56:25] why because just telling them isn't
[56:26] going to make it
[56:28] telling them isn't going to do it how
[56:29] often do we tell people about god how
[56:31] often do we tell people about the
[56:32] message of the hour and it doesn't do
[56:34] anything for them why because it's not
[56:35] quick unto them it's not a revelation to
[56:37] them and jesus says this is for a group
[56:39] right now this is for an elect group
[56:41] that's going to hear this message and
[56:42] then later you're going to take that
[56:43] message and because of what happens to
[56:46] you it's going to have an effect on the
[56:47] hearer
[56:48] amen there's a time and there's a season
[56:50] for people to understand who i am and
[56:52] it's not now so he's saying keep this to
[56:54] yourself
[56:55] because it wouldn't have done any good
[56:56] if he went around telling amen but he's
[56:58] telling peter he says look it's not an
[56:59] intellectual idea you can share
[57:02] i can't go share these things with
[57:03] everybody i can't convince somebody into
[57:06] the building of the church of god
[57:08] it's not going to happen you can
[57:10] certainly share things but that's not
[57:11] what's going to make it happen it's
[57:12] going to have to be a revelation from
[57:14] above and he says you wouldn't have even
[57:16] been able to voice this if god didn't
[57:17] put it in your heart to say it
[57:19] that's how great that revelation is is
[57:21] that there's nothing that he could have
[57:22] pulled it from from a past experience
[57:24] from a past sermon or anything else that
[57:26] would have given him this revelation but
[57:28] he says god came down and put that in
[57:30] your heart peter and that's why you're
[57:31] able to speak those words out of your
[57:32] mouth when i ask you about that i love
[57:35] that because now jesus he says there's a
[57:37] revelation here but with it comes
[57:39] something else
[57:40] because he says peter what's going to
[57:42] come with this revelation with the truth
[57:43] of this revelation is that you're going
[57:45] to get the keys to the kingdom
[57:47] now peter has an idea in his head of
[57:49] that jesus is the christ but he doesn't
[57:51] have an idea of what it means in the
[57:53] fullness of jesus the christ because the
[57:55] christ is what the anointed one and so
[57:58] peter he has this idea of jesus the
[57:59] christ being the anointed one that's
[58:01] standing in front of him but there's a
[58:03] greater revelation that's going to come
[58:05] to him of what it means to be the christ
[58:07] because we see how that anointing is
[58:08] going to pass from jesus down to a group
[58:11] of believers and that's where peter's
[58:12] going to start to see the fullness of
[58:14] what it means to be the christ the
[58:15] anointed one and he's going to see
[58:16] himself in that picture amen he's given
[58:19] the keys to the kingdom here jesus says
[58:21] and he's still unsaved remember he said
[58:23] to peter he says when thou art converted
[58:25] strengthened thy brothers
[58:27] he's not even converted he's he has a
[58:29] revelation from god and yet he's not
[58:31] even converted he still doesn't have
[58:32] power he still doesn't have the means to
[58:34] live the life that he's supposed to live
[58:36] amen but jesus is saying this revelation
[58:38] peter that you've got it's going to take
[58:40] you someplace special and you don't even
[58:41] have a clue about that
[58:43] peter doesn't even know what a church is
[58:45] right then he has no idea what that's
[58:47] going to look like because all they know
[58:48] would be solomon's great temple perhaps
[58:50] or something like that a great building
[58:52] of of god's design and god's preference
[58:54] that's that's meant for god to dwell in
[58:56] but there's going to be a changing now
[58:57] there's a transition from a temple where
[59:00] men worship to a temple where god lives
[59:02] and that's what peter's got to be
[59:04] looking forward to but he has no clue
[59:05] about it
[59:06] you know today when it when it comes to
[59:08] this idea of a church we say we're going
[59:09] to church
[59:10] and what we really mean is we're going
[59:12] to a building that's called a church
[59:14] but that's not the church that jesus was
[59:16] talking about him and we're going to
[59:18] have a service and we're going to have
[59:19] singing and we're going to have praise
[59:20] and worship and shouting and maybe
[59:22] dancing and laying out of hands and
[59:24] preaching of the word but that's not
[59:25] church
[59:27] that's us attending a service that's
[59:29] dedicated to god amen in the
[59:30] denominational world today they'll have
[59:32] you join their church
[59:35] right and they'll have you write your
[59:36] name on a book or or they'll just have
[59:38] you you know in some way signify that
[59:40] you're a member of that church and to
[59:42] them what is a church a church is a
[59:43] group of like-minded people and the trap
[59:46] we can get caught into is that we have a
[59:48] group of like-minded people here
[59:51] that is not what makes us a church
[59:54] because it's by one spirit you're born
[59:55] into this church amen it is not
[59:57] like-minded in the sense that you
[59:59] believe and i believe him and everything
[1:00:01] we say lines up with each other but it's
[1:00:03] because we have a certain mindset that
[1:00:06] is from christ that makes us one and
[1:00:07] that only comes through the living of
[1:00:09] the spirit within our lives amen so
[1:00:11] like-minded people is not good enough
[1:00:12] there's been a ton of like-minded people
[1:00:14] i've spent my life around in church and
[1:00:16] outside of church in certain areas and
[1:00:18] guess what that's not what makes us a
[1:00:19] member of the church of christ
[1:00:21] amen it's got to be something deeper
[1:00:22] it's got to be something greater than
[1:00:24] that but the church started with what
[1:00:26] christ said here and he says i'm going
[1:00:27] to build a church so it's going to be
[1:00:29] something that's of his building and
[1:00:30] it's not of our building
[1:00:32] now it's funny because we we talk about
[1:00:34] all these definitions of church but i
[1:00:35] think the greatest revelation of church
[1:00:38] is found in my young son samuel
[1:00:40] because he knows exactly what church is
[1:00:44] because what happened the last time that
[1:00:45] brother jared was preaching he stepped
[1:00:47] out of the office and samuel pointed to
[1:00:49] him and he said church
[1:00:52] and then he saw brother mark outside and
[1:00:54] he said church
[1:00:56] and he saw brother bob and he says
[1:00:58] church and he sees this one and that one
[1:01:00] and he says church
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:02] now he doesn't really know i'm playing
[1:01:04] around a little bit but that's what
[1:01:06] church is
[1:01:07] it is a church of it is a group of
[1:01:09] people that have the same spirit inside
[1:01:10] of them amen that they have a life
[1:01:12] inside of them that's the building that
[1:01:13] god is preparing in all these things
[1:01:15] it's a group of called out people that
[1:01:17] have dedicated their lives to the
[1:01:19] service of god and to the obedience of
[1:01:21] his word
[1:01:22] amen not just to obey it but to manifest
[1:01:25] the very thing that it says about them
[1:01:26] amen they are identified with it and
[1:01:28] they're identified in it it's not just a
[1:01:30] religion it's not just a covering it's
[1:01:32] not just a creed it's not just a
[1:01:34] lifestyle but it is life itself inside
[1:01:36] of them amen so that's why you can't say
[1:01:39] if you don't attend our church you're
[1:01:41] not going in a rapture how many have
[1:01:42] heard that doctrine before you see it
[1:01:45] certainly in the ones that pull away and
[1:01:46] they get pulled into the thunders
[1:01:48] movement or the two souls movement or
[1:01:49] the deity movement or parousia and all
[1:01:52] these things and they'll say if you
[1:01:53] don't go to our church if you don't sit
[1:01:55] under our pastor then you're not going
[1:01:56] in the rapture
[1:01:58] well jesus said he was going to pull him
[1:01:59] out of every tongue and out of every
[1:02:01] nation and out of every tribe every land
[1:02:03] every color
[1:02:05] so unless you have one of everybody in
[1:02:07] your church then it doesn't meet the
[1:02:08] criteria for the true church of jesus
[1:02:09] christ amen
[1:02:11] so when somebody says if you're not
[1:02:12] sitting under my pastor you're not going
[1:02:13] to make it then you say that's a lie
[1:02:15] from hell
[1:02:16] because that's not the way it works it's
[1:02:17] because it's a building of his calling
[1:02:19] and it's a building of his making and
[1:02:21] it's by his spirit not by the working of
[1:02:23] men that he's going to do it necessarily
[1:02:25] now he's got men working and he's got
[1:02:27] women working that's not not what we're
[1:02:28] talking about but the point is is that
[1:02:30] it's not dependent on one ministry amen
[1:02:32] it's dependent on the holy spirit inside
[1:02:34] of you quickening that seed that's going
[1:02:36] to bring you up in the in the last days
[1:02:37] or take you in a rapture amen
[1:02:40] brother brown we'll put it this way he
[1:02:41] says the anointing is a person
[1:02:45] that's why peter didn't quite get it
[1:02:47] even though he said thou art the christ
[1:02:48] the son of the living god he recognized
[1:02:50] it there but he didn't recognize it in
[1:02:52] the way it was going to come the word
[1:02:54] christ means anointed one see the
[1:02:56] anointed one then moses was christ in
[1:02:59] his days here you're seeing christ is
[1:03:01] the mystery of god revealed moses was
[1:03:03] christ in his days he was the anointed
[1:03:05] one jeremiah was christ in his days with
[1:03:08] a portion of the word for that day
[1:03:10] but when jesus came he came as the
[1:03:12] redeemer anointed one and that was both
[1:03:15] moses and all that was in moses and all
[1:03:17] the word and all the godhead bodily was
[1:03:19] in him that's the reason the whole
[1:03:21] temple veil was rent and the mercy seat
[1:03:24] come in perfect view because he was the
[1:03:26] anointed one
[1:03:27] notice now he says the veil in human
[1:03:30] flesh the promised word to this age must
[1:03:34] also be veiled
[1:03:36] notice though
[1:03:37] sin-loving church members and sinners
[1:03:40] cannot see it because of the human veil
[1:03:42] so brother brown says look there's going
[1:03:43] to be a same veiling and unveiling of
[1:03:46] the word in this age
[1:03:48] no different than it was with christ in
[1:03:50] that the word has to be veiled and it's
[1:03:52] going to be unveiled but he says look
[1:03:54] not everybody's going to recognize
[1:03:55] what's going to happen here now the
[1:03:57] first one he says is going to miss it he
[1:03:59] talks about sinners and that's the
[1:04:01] obvious one we say of course the sinners
[1:04:02] aren't going to recognize if they
[1:04:03] recognized it then they come in and
[1:04:05] they'd be a part of it
[1:04:07] but the one that we've got to look at
[1:04:08] here is he says the sin loving church
[1:04:10] members
[1:04:11] because these are what we've heard in
[1:04:12] the that tape and uh three kinds of
[1:04:15] believers these are what the pretended
[1:04:17] brothers and sisters these are the
[1:04:19] make-believers these are the people that
[1:04:20] live the lifestyle but they don't have
[1:04:22] the life inside of them and he says
[1:04:24] they're going to completely miss the
[1:04:26] veiling and the unveiling of the word in
[1:04:28] their age why because they won't be a
[1:04:29] part of it and if you're not a part of
[1:04:31] it chances are you're not even going to
[1:04:32] recognize it or see it you might see it
[1:04:34] after we're all gone out of here but
[1:04:36] when you really need to see it you'll
[1:04:37] miss it completely they missed it with
[1:04:39] the prophet of god
[1:04:41] right they missed it with them by the
[1:04:42] end they said you're off on your
[1:04:43] doctrine we love the gifts we love the
[1:04:45] signs but you're off on your doctrine
[1:04:46] and they put them out of their church
[1:04:48] and what was it they were putting christ
[1:04:50] out of the church why it was the word
[1:04:52] coming to them it was the anointed one
[1:04:54] that was coming to them bringing with
[1:04:56] them a message that would take them out
[1:04:58] of laodicea and they kicked him out and
[1:04:59] so he's standing on the outside trying
[1:05:01] to knock in there there's only one voice
[1:05:03] to this age and it is a prophetic voice
[1:05:05] to the angel of the church of laodicea
[1:05:07] right there's only one voice every one
[1:05:09] of us even myself and brother joe we are
[1:05:11] not a different voice we're the same
[1:05:13] voice saying the same thing we're doing
[1:05:15] the exact same thing that he said
[1:05:16] because why we heeded what he said we
[1:05:18] heard what he said and now we're
[1:05:19] repeating it to everyone else that will
[1:05:21] give us a chance and let us hear let
[1:05:23] them hear it amen
[1:05:25] but that doesn't mean that he was only
[1:05:26] talking about himself he was talking
[1:05:28] about himself in this this is 1964
[1:05:31] halfway through the year he's talking
[1:05:32] about himself here but he's also talking
[1:05:34] about a bride amen it's not a new
[1:05:36] doctrine for the prophet in 1964 this is
[1:05:38] not something he started talking about
[1:05:40] after the opening of the seals this has
[1:05:42] been consistent through his entire uh
[1:05:44] ministry and we look all the way back in
[1:05:46] 1956 he's doing discernment in front of
[1:05:49] the people and he's showing god in a man
[1:05:52] it was a wave offering it was a chief
[1:05:53] offering it was a a presentation of what
[1:05:56] was coming of the manifestation of the
[1:05:57] sons and daughters of god and he's about
[1:05:59] to do that in front of the people now it
[1:06:01] wasn't the fullness but it was god in a
[1:06:03] man we've got to be able to see that
[1:06:05] because if you can't see it in him you
[1:06:06] won't see it in you amen
[1:06:09] you may not have the same gift as
[1:06:10] brother brown the same calling but it's
[1:06:11] got to be no different in terms of the
[1:06:13] god that's inside of you and he says
[1:06:15] here then if he's raised from the dead
[1:06:17] he's no more in a corporal body but he's
[1:06:20] in our body 1956
[1:06:23] all that was in god he poured into
[1:06:25] christ and all that was in christ he
[1:06:26] poured into the church see so it's just
[1:06:30] a continuation
[1:06:32] so when you stop and say it was only the
[1:06:34] prophet there is no continuation
[1:06:37] because he's dead
[1:06:39] in terms of this world he's dead
[1:06:41] he says in that day you'll know that i'm
[1:06:43] the father and the fathers of me and i
[1:06:44] and you see all together the holy spirit
[1:06:48] working among his people so he's saying
[1:06:50] it's not just a prophet but this is a
[1:06:52] group of people this is a church this is
[1:06:54] a group of called out ones and i believe
[1:06:56] it's one of the greatest followings we
[1:06:58] have around the message today is that
[1:07:00] people put the anointing of christ on
[1:07:02] brother branham and they won't put it on
[1:07:03] themselves
[1:07:05] they'll say that was for the prophet
[1:07:07] that was exclusive to the prophet and
[1:07:09] they won't put that anointing on
[1:07:10] themselves gifts absolutely i don't
[1:07:13] believe we'll ever see a gift like
[1:07:14] brother branham had ever again why
[1:07:15] because he was the angel of the age he
[1:07:17] had to be something special amen but
[1:07:19] that doesn't mean that the anointing of
[1:07:21] the christ doesn't come on each and
[1:07:22] every one of us because jesus said i'm
[1:07:24] going to be with you and i'm going to be
[1:07:25] even in you
[1:07:27] right i'm going to be a comfort to you
[1:07:28] i'm going to be life within you i'm
[1:07:30] going to be all of these things and so
[1:07:32] we sit there and we put it all in that
[1:07:33] prophet and we say we're going to just
[1:07:35] sit here and listen and he's going to be
[1:07:36] the main
[1:07:38] but he's saying no no no this is for all
[1:07:40] of us this is a feast for all of us to
[1:07:43] feed from amen the word doesn't just
[1:07:45] come to me but it's got to come out for
[1:07:47] me and it's got to go into you and it's
[1:07:48] got to come out of you in the same way
[1:07:50] that it's come to me and then it's a
[1:07:51] multi-member body and you saw you've got
[1:07:53] a group of thousands maybe hundreds of
[1:07:55] thousands of people today and they've
[1:07:57] got that prophet up here and they'll
[1:07:58] never get up there because they say he's
[1:07:59] different than the rest of us and in the
[1:08:01] body of christ he's no different than
[1:08:03] the rest of us he is a manifested son of
[1:08:05] god and we're just looking to come to
[1:08:06] the same level amen manifested sons and
[1:08:08] daughters of god how many times in the
[1:08:10] service did the prophet he you know he
[1:08:12] go through the prayer lines and and then
[1:08:14] he the people's faith would come up and
[1:08:16] he'd say now you lay hands on that one
[1:08:17] next to you and you do it and you do it
[1:08:20] he'd say this is what it's all about
[1:08:23] it's not about me it's about you it's
[1:08:24] about getting you to your place in
[1:08:26] christ recognizing who and what you are
[1:08:29] remember that that sister was out there
[1:08:31] and she she gave her prayer card to
[1:08:33] somebody else and then she went and she
[1:08:34] goes and she prays for a woman and she
[1:08:36] gets healed and then that woman comes up
[1:08:38] and brother bram says you're already
[1:08:39] healed and that sister out there prayed
[1:08:41] and then i believe don't quote me i
[1:08:43] believe he says now sister you gave up
[1:08:44] your prayer card here's your need and he
[1:08:46] he said jesus christ heals you as well
[1:08:48] but he says that woman when she prayed
[1:08:50] out there for you in the congregation
[1:08:52] you were healed at that moment
[1:08:54] right he says i don't need to pray for
[1:08:56] you anymore
[1:08:58] what is it
[1:08:59] your faith has made you well jesus said
[1:09:02] i didn't do anything half the time he
[1:09:03] said your faith does it your faith did
[1:09:05] and he said her faith did it i didn't
[1:09:07] you don't need anything for me she's
[1:09:08] done the work already
[1:09:10] listen to this 1962 before the opening
[1:09:12] of the seals he says let me ask you
[1:09:13] something do you believe with all your
[1:09:16] heart jesus said these signs shall
[1:09:18] follow them that believe how many
[1:09:20] believes
[1:09:22] then lay your hands on one another if
[1:09:24] you're a believer you're as much a child
[1:09:27] of his
[1:09:28] you're as much his child as i am
[1:09:32] so he's saying the limitation is not on
[1:09:34] on who and what you are the limitation
[1:09:36] is do you believe who you are
[1:09:38] he says you're no different than i when
[1:09:40] it comes to the throne of god to the
[1:09:42] throne of mercy to to a pool of healing
[1:09:44] whatever you might want to call it he
[1:09:46] says you're no different than i when it
[1:09:47] comes to these matters you can do the
[1:09:49] same things i can do
[1:09:51] he says what is it it's a vindication
[1:09:53] that he's here he says oh can't we come
[1:09:55] in sincerity now after his word and
[1:09:58] after his presence
[1:10:02] what's he saying
[1:10:04] don't sell yourself short
[1:10:06] i'm just a wife i'm just a mother
[1:10:09] i'm just a dad at home i'm just a worker
[1:10:11] i'm just a young person he says listen
[1:10:14] if you're a child of god that's been
[1:10:15] filled with the spirit there's no
[1:10:16] difference between you and me
[1:10:19] amen you say brother john you can put
[1:10:21] yourself at the level as the prophet of
[1:10:23] god he said i could
[1:10:25] the word says i can so the only question
[1:10:27] is like he said do you believe it
[1:10:30] that's what he's challenging the people
[1:10:31] will you believe that you're in the same
[1:10:33] position that i am
[1:10:35] now you may not be as mature yet
[1:10:37] god may not be able to use you the same
[1:10:39] yet but when it comes to the redemptive
[1:10:40] gifts that he got for us at calvary and
[1:10:42] when we look at the gifts of the holy
[1:10:44] spirit and these things there is no
[1:10:45] limitation
[1:10:46] if you're a son you're a daughter of god
[1:10:47] then everything's available to you
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:51] brother brown would say this he'd say
[1:10:53] this morning was more of the sermon type
[1:10:56] placing the foundation upon the deity of
[1:10:58] the revelation god being revealed in
[1:11:00] christ how many believes it god was
[1:11:03] revealed in christ jehovah was revealed
[1:11:05] in christ he says now where's god to be
[1:11:07] revealed
[1:11:08] in his church with his people in us
[1:11:12] the same spirit the same works the same
[1:11:16] manifestation the same love the same
[1:11:18] forgiveness the same long-suffering
[1:11:21] gentleness patience peace mercy all that
[1:11:23] was in christ is in the church he says
[1:11:26] now remember keep this in mind all that
[1:11:28] god was he poured into christ he was the
[1:11:31] fullness of the godhead bodily and all
[1:11:33] that christ was he poured into the
[1:11:34] church god above us god with us and god
[1:11:38] in us the triunity of god god manifested
[1:11:41] in three different manners father son
[1:11:43] and holy spirit now notice here he
[1:11:45] doesn't cherry pick with signs and
[1:11:47] wonders because that's what people will
[1:11:48] do they'll say you'll know you're a
[1:11:50] child of god when the signs and wonders
[1:11:51] are there
[1:11:53] but brother branham's not saying that
[1:11:54] because the scripture doesn't says these
[1:11:56] signs shall lead
[1:11:57] it says these signs shall follow
[1:12:00] so what leads what leads is what he says
[1:12:02] here the life longsuffering patience and
[1:12:05] mercy and grace and all these different
[1:12:06] things he says you've got to have a life
[1:12:08] change first before he can start using
[1:12:11] you
[1:12:11] so he changes you and then he uses you
[1:12:14] and we flipped it now to you say i won't
[1:12:16] believe that i'm a son or a daughter of
[1:12:18] god until i'm laying hands on the sick
[1:12:19] and they're being made well
[1:12:21] that's what follows
[1:12:22] and that may be 10 or 15 or 20 years
[1:12:24] down the road that may be 50 years down
[1:12:25] the road for you but that doesn't make
[1:12:27] you any less a child of god
[1:12:29] but has your life been changed and does
[1:12:31] it reflect the word that's more what
[1:12:32] he's concerned about is have you had the
[1:12:34] change of the holy spirit and dwelling
[1:12:36] inside of you amen
[1:12:38] if you keep going to 1962 and he's
[1:12:40] talking about why christ is living in us
[1:12:42] and working in us and he says all that
[1:12:43] christ was he poured into the church
[1:12:46] what is it
[1:12:47] anointed one con to continue his work
[1:12:51] that his word might live
[1:12:53] constantly
[1:12:55] because he's never dead
[1:12:58] right if you have eternal life inside of
[1:13:00] you then the same kind of life that
[1:13:01] jesus lived is supposed to be living in
[1:13:03] you and he says that's the purpose for
[1:13:05] all of this is
[1:13:06] so that god's word can live constantly
[1:13:10] not just be preached not just be taught
[1:13:12] but it's a life lived remember that
[1:13:15] quote where it says lived voices
[1:13:17] thundering out
[1:13:19] that's what he's looking for his lives
[1:13:21] lived according to the word lives lived
[1:13:23] by the word lives that are the word
[1:13:25] that's what we're that's what we're
[1:13:27] looking for above all else it says he
[1:13:29] lived by the word of the father man
[1:13:31] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:13:33] every word that proceeds from the mouth
[1:13:34] of god and the church doesn't live by
[1:13:37] bread alone but by the word of christ
[1:13:39] and the holy spirit comes in and takes
[1:13:41] the word of christ and makes it a living
[1:13:44] action today
[1:13:46] and then he says these signs shall
[1:13:48] follow them that believe
[1:13:50] signs do have to follow
[1:13:52] it's a dead church if there's no signs
[1:13:54] it's a dead church if there's no wonders
[1:13:56] you can have births but that burst got
[1:13:57] to bring you to a place of maturity and
[1:13:58] those signs and wonders have to follow
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:01] but he's saying the life's got to be
[1:14:02] lived the living word and then it has an
[1:14:05] effect on others as well and then what's
[1:14:07] god's purpose that his word might live
[1:14:09] constantly that's our heritage
[1:14:11] that's what we look back in the book of
[1:14:13] acts amen that's our heritage because
[1:14:15] we're being pointed back to the faith of
[1:14:16] those same people and our heritage is
[1:14:18] that the word lives to us the same word
[1:14:20] that it did through jesus christ amen
[1:14:23] what can hinder us
[1:14:24] what hinders us as we ask in the last
[1:14:26] service what is it that holds us back
[1:14:28] from that
[1:14:30] what's worth it
[1:14:31] what's worth the hindrances that we deal
[1:14:33] with day in and day out and are they of
[1:14:34] our own allowing
[1:14:36] amen are they of our own choosing or has
[1:14:38] satan gotten one over on us amen the
[1:14:40] worst is when we allow it in and our
[1:14:43] time and our energy is put into things
[1:14:44] that have nothing to do with god and the
[1:14:46] kingdom of god and then we sit there and
[1:14:47] we say why aren't these things following
[1:14:49] us because we've allowed the hindrances
[1:14:51] in that are keeping us from stepping
[1:14:52] into a greater relationship with god
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:56] now i want to step back a little bit in
[1:14:58] into matthew 16 because i want to just
[1:15:00] anchor a couple things as we start to
[1:15:01] move forward and in matthew 16 18 it
[1:15:04] says and i also say unto thee thou art
[1:15:06] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[1:15:09] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:15:11] prevail against it now i mentioned i
[1:15:14] want to hit on this portion about upon
[1:15:16] this rock again we said the catholic
[1:15:18] church says that christ was going to
[1:15:19] build the church and peter was the first
[1:15:21] pope and he's the foundation well guess
[1:15:23] what peter is not the foundation amen no
[1:15:26] other foundation can be laid other than
[1:15:27] christ and then paul tells us later
[1:15:29] we're going to read it in a little bit
[1:15:31] but we see that even peter had to be
[1:15:32] corrected
[1:15:34] and a foundation has to be perfect
[1:15:36] a foundation have to be perfect if
[1:15:38] there's cracks in it if there's flaws in
[1:15:39] it then it's no foundation so peter
[1:15:41] himself couldn't be it the funny thing
[1:15:43] is who corrected peter it was paul
[1:15:46] so if you were going to pick anyone to
[1:15:47] be a pope it should be paul
[1:15:49] because he corrected the pope so if you
[1:15:52] correct the pope i don't think he's the
[1:15:53] pope
[1:15:54] right
[1:15:55] paul was the highest order in the church
[1:15:57] back then
[1:15:58] right he went in he had to he had to
[1:15:59] correct peter so peter couldn't be the
[1:16:02] foundation i mean that's blown
[1:16:03] completely out of the water
[1:16:05] but what was jesus meaning when he said
[1:16:06] i'll build my my church upon this rock
[1:16:11] did peter could peter couldn't even
[1:16:13] understand what he was talking about let
[1:16:14] me just put it that way brother bram
[1:16:16] says he said blessed art thou simon bar
[1:16:18] jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:16:20] revealed this to you he says you never
[1:16:21] learned it in some school of theology
[1:16:24] you never learned it in any other way
[1:16:26] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:16:27] revealed it to you and upon this rock
[1:16:29] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:16:31] hell can't prevail against it you know
[1:16:33] how you've got it
[1:16:35] hell can't prevail against it what that
[1:16:36] means is hell can't overcome it hell
[1:16:38] can't change your position hell can't
[1:16:40] change your mindset hell can't change
[1:16:42] your approach hell can't change you
[1:16:44] because you're anchored to something
[1:16:46] that is immovable and unchangeable amen
[1:16:48] when you can't be shaken that's how you
[1:16:50] know you're on a firm foundation that's
[1:16:52] how you know when you're on this
[1:16:53] foundation until it's settled in your
[1:16:55] life you're always going to have issues
[1:16:58] what does he say it is he says it's
[1:16:59] spiritual revealed truth of jesus christ
[1:17:02] now people will go left on this they'll
[1:17:03] say it's the seven seals they'll say
[1:17:04] it's godhead it's water baptism it's
[1:17:06] serpent seed it's marriage and divorce
[1:17:08] and all these things they'll say that's
[1:17:10] that's what he's talking about here no
[1:17:12] no no
[1:17:13] that's not what he's talking about here
[1:17:14] because remember we're talking about a
[1:17:15] foundation amen he says if you're just
[1:17:17] all worked up and emotional that won't
[1:17:19] work either
[1:17:20] you can go to youth camps you can go to
[1:17:22] special meetings every day of your life
[1:17:24] that's not going to do it
[1:17:26] it'll feel great
[1:17:28] but that's not going to settle you he
[1:17:30] says it's got to be a direct witness
[1:17:34] that means it's got to be firsthand to
[1:17:35] you not somebody told you not somebody
[1:17:38] made you not somebody shared with you
[1:17:40] but it's got to be yours and yours alone
[1:17:43] it's got to be a direct witness that god
[1:17:45] himself by election has called you and
[1:17:50] revealed christ to you
[1:17:52] so mama doesn't do it and daddy doesn't
[1:17:54] do it and brother gerald doesn't do it
[1:17:56] and the five-fold ministry doesn't do it
[1:17:58] it's christ and christ alone that
[1:18:00] reveals himself to you and he lets you
[1:18:02] know you're one of mine amen and it's
[1:18:04] not by your choosing but it's by my
[1:18:07] choosing remember he says he that god
[1:18:09] himself by election has called you
[1:18:13] so you didn't have anything to do with
[1:18:14] this in the first place he elected you
[1:18:17] he chose you he cut you out of that
[1:18:18] piece of cloth and said this is a part
[1:18:20] of my bride this is my bride right here
[1:18:24] and they didn't choose themselves he
[1:18:25] chose you
[1:18:26] because if you ever think that you had a
[1:18:28] part in it then you can also be
[1:18:30] you can also be convinced
[1:18:32] out of it
[1:18:33] because if you can say i had a part in
[1:18:35] then you can say i have a part to take
[1:18:36] myself out but if you recognize that you
[1:18:38] always were and you always will be no
[1:18:40] matter your condition then that's going
[1:18:43] to be something that anchors you amen
[1:18:45] nothing's going to move you when you
[1:18:46] realize that he's the one that called
[1:18:48] you he's the one that's holding you and
[1:18:50] he's the one that's guaranteed you all
[1:18:51] the way to the end
[1:18:52] that this started way before you ever
[1:18:54] came into this world right back in the
[1:18:57] mind of god in eternity and it doesn't
[1:18:59] finish until you go all the way back to
[1:19:01] eternity again and in between you're
[1:19:03] going to be involved in that you're
[1:19:04] going to make some decisions
[1:19:05] you're going to make it easier you're
[1:19:06] going to make it hard but from the start
[1:19:08] to the finish it was him and it's him
[1:19:10] all the way through and it's just grace
[1:19:11] that keeps you moving in between
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:17] but what you've got to do is this part
[1:19:18] where he says you've got to have a
[1:19:20] direct witness that he's called you and
[1:19:22] he's revealed christ to you
[1:19:24] you've got to do that with what the
[1:19:25] scripture says that you've got to work
[1:19:27] out your own salvation with fear and
[1:19:28] trembling you got to be sure that he's
[1:19:31] called you
[1:19:32] you got to be sure that he has filled
[1:19:34] you with the holy spirit you've got to
[1:19:36] be sure that you were in his mind before
[1:19:38] the world began and when you're sure
[1:19:41] and guess what sometimes that does take
[1:19:42] a lot of fear and trembling it takes
[1:19:44] tears it takes time down on your knees
[1:19:46] it takes time with god saying lord i
[1:19:48] need a confirmation lord i need an
[1:19:50] affirmation lord i need proof in my life
[1:19:52] that you're with me
[1:19:54] and that takes what fear and trembling
[1:19:56] that's going before god you got to be
[1:19:57] honest with god you got to be honest and
[1:19:59] say i'm not sure
[1:20:01] now don't let satan use it as a wedge to
[1:20:03] drive into your life but you say god i'm
[1:20:05] looking for you to be real to me and
[1:20:07] guess what if you do that he'll make
[1:20:09] himself real to you amen absolutely he
[1:20:11] will i can say it from a young man of 17
[1:20:13] years old all the way to almost my 43rd
[1:20:15] year now when you go to god and you ask
[1:20:17] for more of him or
[1:20:18] or for him to do more in your life he'll
[1:20:21] always do it
[1:20:22] he just doesn't always do it the way you
[1:20:24] think he will
[1:20:26] let me add that in there for the younger
[1:20:27] people especially amen
[1:20:29] but i can't do that for you i'm not a
[1:20:32] good enough preacher to do that for you
[1:20:34] nobody is
[1:20:36] it doesn't matter if we had brother ron
[1:20:37] spencer brother donnie reagan and
[1:20:38] brother tim pruitt up here
[1:20:39] simultaneously they can't do that for
[1:20:41] you you have to have it settled in your
[1:20:44] own heart amen brethren says he says
[1:20:46] some people come to church just for the
[1:20:48] emotional part
[1:20:50] some people come to church just to sing
[1:20:53] some people come to church just to enjoy
[1:20:55] the good singing that's all right
[1:20:57] i love good singing i love a special
[1:21:00] i love a special where they're like me
[1:21:02] they cry and then they get better as
[1:21:03] they go
[1:21:05] that's me that's why i don't sing
[1:21:06] specials it's not because i have a bad
[1:21:08] voice it's because i cry
[1:21:10] right i love good singing
[1:21:12] he says some people come to church and
[1:21:14] join church just to hide their meanness
[1:21:18] i don't know if i've ever met that one
[1:21:19] but
[1:21:21] make themselves a little better name in
[1:21:22] the neighborhood that one i've
[1:21:23] definitely met
[1:21:26] some come to church sincerely but don't
[1:21:28] never have a touch from god
[1:21:31] that's a horrible place to be
[1:21:34] but when god calls a man he says no man
[1:21:37] can come to me except my father draws
[1:21:38] him first and all that comes i will give
[1:21:40] him everlasting life and raise him up at
[1:21:42] the last day he says oh i hope you see
[1:21:44] it
[1:21:45] brother it's the work of the holy spirit
[1:21:48] revealing to the individual
[1:21:50] not upon some emotion
[1:21:52] that's why we don't try and get our
[1:21:53] young people to shout
[1:21:56] but we like it when they shout but we
[1:21:58] don't try and get them to shout
[1:22:00] not upon something you should do or
[1:22:02] shouldn't do or this that or the other
[1:22:04] all those things are all right the moves
[1:22:06] and works and shouting and dancing and
[1:22:08] speaking in tongues all those things are
[1:22:10] all right we don't quench that
[1:22:13] but it's never going to be a proof
[1:22:16] he says but the first thing it has to be
[1:22:18] a spiritual revelation that god has
[1:22:21] given the individual that jesus christ
[1:22:23] is the son of god
[1:22:25] calling
[1:22:26] not just something back there not just a
[1:22:28] man that gave his life for you on the
[1:22:30] cross but he's here today calling
[1:22:33] that's what you've got to be satisfied
[1:22:34] with that's right he says without that
[1:22:37] brother you're only impersonating you're
[1:22:40] only pretending
[1:22:42] but i understand the seven seals
[1:22:45] i know the godhead
[1:22:46] i know the truth of water baptism and
[1:22:48] all these different things
[1:22:50] you can't start with doctrine
[1:22:53] that's something that comes up from the
[1:22:54] foundation but he says you've got to
[1:22:56] start with a personal experience here
[1:22:58] where you know that he's called you and
[1:22:59] that he's alive and well today and that
[1:23:01] he wants you to give your life
[1:23:04] remember those old we probably don't
[1:23:06] maybe as as canadians we don't see it
[1:23:08] that much but they used to have those
[1:23:09] those uh posters during the world wars
[1:23:11] and it was uncle sam remember and he had
[1:23:12] the the finger and he says i want you
[1:23:16] it was for the war draft right and the
[1:23:18] soldiers guess what you've got to
[1:23:20] recognize that god's doing the same
[1:23:21] thing and he's saying i want you
[1:23:24] you personally not you generally but you
[1:23:27] personally and you hear that voice and
[1:23:29] you feel that call to you amen
[1:23:32] what i'm trying to get to is that he's
[1:23:33] the one that builds the church and it
[1:23:35] starts with his call and it starts with
[1:23:37] his work not yours amen and so if it's
[1:23:40] his to start with
[1:23:43] when can you ever add anything to it
[1:23:46] because everything we do
[1:23:48] is going to be tested and tried
[1:23:51] scripture talks about in revelation that
[1:23:53] every man's work is going to be tried by
[1:23:54] what fire
[1:23:56] and the only thing that'll last is
[1:23:58] something that's done in his name with
[1:23:59] his will
[1:24:00] that's the only thing that's left so
[1:24:02] guess what you may be doing things but
[1:24:04] it's got to be god working through you
[1:24:06] and leading and guiding you for anything
[1:24:08] that's built on this foundation to stand
[1:24:10] so if you don't get him at the beginning
[1:24:12] and you start with doctrine and you
[1:24:13] start with good works and all these
[1:24:14] different things then you're going to be
[1:24:16] hopelessly doomed
[1:24:17] because it's just straw and stubble it's
[1:24:19] just things that you're pulling from
[1:24:20] life and experience and things you've
[1:24:21] heard over the pulpit to try and build
[1:24:23] up a life build yourself into a church
[1:24:25] that god can inhabit
[1:24:26] no he's saying i want to build the
[1:24:28] church i want to do this so let me start
[1:24:30] at the ground floor and i'll build you
[1:24:32] up into something that's worth talking
[1:24:33] about amen
[1:24:34] and that means every aspect not just
[1:24:36] coming to church not just giving your
[1:24:38] heart to the lord but as you grow and as
[1:24:39] you mature in your careers and your
[1:24:41] marriages and your ministries and your
[1:24:43] works and your gifts and all these
[1:24:45] things it's all got to be brought
[1:24:46] subject to that leadership and that call
[1:24:48] because unless he's doing it it's all
[1:24:50] going to fade away anyways amen
[1:24:52] we see an example of this i know i've
[1:24:54] spoken about it but part of this jumped
[1:24:56] out to me while i was studying here in
[1:24:58] acts 1 and remember they're in the
[1:24:59] they're in the upper room and they're
[1:25:00] waiting for power from god
[1:25:02] right the holy ghost hadn't fallen and
[1:25:04] then peter mr keys to the kingdom
[1:25:06] decides that he's going to take you know
[1:25:08] make make use of this spare time that
[1:25:10] they have up there since they've been
[1:25:11] waiting so long and in acts 1 he says in
[1:25:14] those days peter stood up in the midst
[1:25:15] of the disciples and said the number of
[1:25:17] names together were about 120
[1:25:20] men and brethren this scripture must
[1:25:21] needs be fulfilled which the holy ghost
[1:25:23] by the mouth of david spoke before
[1:25:25] concerning judas which was guide to them
[1:25:27] that took jesus for he was numbered with
[1:25:29] us and had obtained part of this
[1:25:31] ministry now this man purchased the
[1:25:33] field with the reward of iniquity and
[1:25:35] falling headlong he burst asunder in the
[1:25:37] midst and all his bowels gushed out
[1:25:39] and it was known unto all the dwellers
[1:25:40] at jerusalem in so much as that field is
[1:25:42] called in their proper tongue
[1:25:45] that is to say the field of blood for it
[1:25:47] is written in the book of psalms let his
[1:25:49] habitation be desolate and let no man
[1:25:51] dwell therein and his bishopric let
[1:25:53] another take now i want you to catch
[1:25:56] here in verse 19 and 20 that peter has
[1:25:59] the word
[1:26:00] for what he's about to do
[1:26:03] he's got a scripture he's gone in he's
[1:26:05] identified something that he believes
[1:26:06] applies to the situation
[1:26:08] and he says listen we've got to fulfill
[1:26:10] the word
[1:26:11] that's what he's saying here
[1:26:13] he's saying we've got to fulfill the
[1:26:14] word we've lost one of the 12. we know
[1:26:16] they're supposed to be 12.
[1:26:19] so we've got to come up with a 12th
[1:26:23] and he's preaching to the people and
[1:26:24] guess what he hasn't been endued with
[1:26:25] power from on high yet he hasn't stepped
[1:26:28] into he's stepping into the role without
[1:26:30] the commission
[1:26:32] being truly there because he doesn't
[1:26:33] have the holy spirit yet he hasn't been
[1:26:34] endued with power but he's got the word
[1:26:36] he thinks according to his own
[1:26:38] interpretation so he stands up and he
[1:26:39] tries to take charge to bring what the
[1:26:42] creation of a church that's what he's
[1:26:44] doing he's saying the church is supposed
[1:26:46] to have 12 let's get the
[1:26:48] 12th this is the start of a denomination
[1:26:54] right peter the rock
[1:26:57] the man with the keys to the kingdom is
[1:26:58] trying to start a denomination here and
[1:27:00] he doesn't even realize it because what
[1:27:01] he's doing by the thought and choice of
[1:27:04] men
[1:27:05] something that god was going to do
[1:27:06] himself
[1:27:07] amen that's a scary thing to think about
[1:27:10] that a man of the caliber of peter and
[1:27:12] the call and ministry of peter would
[1:27:14] make such a mistake as this and what's
[1:27:15] he doing he's trying to put a man in of
[1:27:17] his choosing and their choosing not of
[1:27:19] god's
[1:27:21] it says wherefore of these men which
[1:27:23] have company with us all the time that
[1:27:24] the lord jesus went in and among us
[1:27:27] beginning from the baptism of john unto
[1:27:29] that same day that he was taken up from
[1:27:31] us must one be ordained to be a witness
[1:27:33] with us of his resurrection so he says
[1:27:34] let's pick somebody that's with been
[1:27:36] with us from the very beginning from the
[1:27:38] ministry of john all the way through
[1:27:39] until jesus was resurrected and we saw
[1:27:41] him and then we saw his ascension he
[1:27:43] says we've got to get somebody that has
[1:27:44] a proof of his resurrection with their
[1:27:46] own eyes
[1:27:48] now we'd say that's a great criteria
[1:27:51] that's about as good as you want is
[1:27:52] somebody that's been faithful and true
[1:27:54] and has seen it all has been part of the
[1:27:56] signs and wonders part of the gifts has
[1:27:58] heard jesus has been faithful through
[1:28:00] all of the trials and testing
[1:28:02] that's a great choice peter
[1:28:06] but who did god pick
[1:28:08] god picked a man named saul
[1:28:10] who was a persecutor of the church
[1:28:14] and guess what
[1:28:15] paul had to have a proof of the
[1:28:16] resurrection did you know that
[1:28:18] peter's criteria is good it's just
[1:28:20] applied to the wrong man because because
[1:28:22] paul having never seen
[1:28:25] jesus in a resurrected form
[1:28:27] still had proof of his resurrection
[1:28:29] because the proof of his resurrection
[1:28:30] was in a light that knocked him off of
[1:28:32] his horse on the road to damascus
[1:28:34] right they had to have somebody in there
[1:28:36] that knew that christ was alive even
[1:28:38] though they'd never seen him come out of
[1:28:39] the grave
[1:28:40] why because that was a prophet to then
[1:28:42] age that was going to go and he was
[1:28:43] going to go all over the area there and
[1:28:45] he was going to say he's alive and well
[1:28:46] because i've met him and i've talked to
[1:28:48] him and this is the effect he had on me
[1:28:50] and this is what he's done in my life
[1:28:52] peter and them they all had the physical
[1:28:54] they had the eyesight they had the
[1:28:56] memories of it all paul didn't have that
[1:28:58] paul had a supernatural experience with
[1:29:00] a risen christ that even they couldn't
[1:29:01] comprehend
[1:29:03] because they were tied to their natural
[1:29:04] paul was tied to a supernatural
[1:29:06] experience that proved that god was
[1:29:08] still alive and well amen it says and
[1:29:10] they appointed two joseph called
[1:29:12] barcelous who was surnamed justice and
[1:29:14] matthias and they prayed and said thou
[1:29:16] lord which knows the hearts of all men
[1:29:18] shall whether of these two thou has
[1:29:20] shone chosen they're praying to god
[1:29:22] they're saying god we're inviting you
[1:29:23] into the decision
[1:29:25] but god never told him to do this
[1:29:27] god never said go replace
[1:29:30] judas
[1:29:31] god said look go wait being deal with
[1:29:33] power and then go preach the gospel
[1:29:35] nowhere did he tell him to go pick a
[1:29:36] 12th disciple but they said it's in the
[1:29:38] word and it's got to be manifested it's
[1:29:40] got to happen so we're going to take
[1:29:41] care of it
[1:29:42] wasn't there place to do it
[1:29:45] that he may take a part of this ministry
[1:29:47] an apostleship from which judas by
[1:29:49] transgression fell that he might go to
[1:29:51] his own place
[1:29:52] this was a very spiritual event
[1:29:54] they had the word they were praying
[1:29:56] they're asking god into the situation
[1:29:58] they were giving god the decision
[1:30:00] it says and they gave forth their lots
[1:30:02] and the lot fell upon mathias and he was
[1:30:04] numbered with the 11 disciples and we
[1:30:06] never hear a thing about him afterwards
[1:30:09] he was a tremendous believer
[1:30:10] he was a tremendous man i believe but we
[1:30:13] don't hear a single thing about matthias
[1:30:14] after this why because he wasn't god's
[1:30:16] choice
[1:30:17] this was a man trying to build a church
[1:30:21] of his own ways and of his own thinking
[1:30:23] and as good as they were i don't think
[1:30:24] any one of us could fault peter in his
[1:30:26] approach
[1:30:27] pick a man of the right caliber has the
[1:30:29] right experience
[1:30:31] that's been with us all the way along
[1:30:33] and then let's pray to god about it and
[1:30:35] let him make the choice
[1:30:37] and yet god wasn't in it at all
[1:30:39] but they would have believed right there
[1:30:41] that he was
[1:30:42] right sincere remember
[1:30:45] sincere but until you've had the
[1:30:46] experience you don't even know what
[1:30:47] you're doing
[1:30:49] right
[1:30:50] but look at paul's approach because he
[1:30:52] was the true twelfth disciple
[1:30:54] he's got a part in setting up the church
[1:30:55] too but look how he goes about it
[1:30:57] first corinthians 3 it says who then is
[1:30:59] paul and who is apollos but ministers
[1:31:02] whom he believed even as the lord gave
[1:31:04] to every man
[1:31:06] i have planted apollos watered but god
[1:31:09] gave the increase amen you can put all
[1:31:12] the materials there you can put
[1:31:13] everything there that is going to make
[1:31:14] the church of god but it says unless god
[1:31:16] gives the increase nothing's going to
[1:31:17] happen
[1:31:18] it's dead
[1:31:20] the ministry could stand in this pulpit
[1:31:21] and preach to you all day long but
[1:31:23] unless god increases it unless god
[1:31:25] quickens it to your heart it's not going
[1:31:26] to do you a world of good
[1:31:28] it says so then neither is he that
[1:31:30] planteth anything
[1:31:32] so he's not noteworthy he's not
[1:31:34] effective and he's not life-giving
[1:31:37] the planters paul the prophet of the age
[1:31:40] is not noteworthy effective or
[1:31:41] life-giving
[1:31:43] he's no good is what he's saying he says
[1:31:45] neither he that watereth but god that
[1:31:48] giveth the increase what's he saying you
[1:31:50] can do everything you want but in the
[1:31:51] true church of god unless god is behind
[1:31:53] it it's not going to amount to anything
[1:31:55] there's no life going to come out of it
[1:31:57] now he that planteth and he that
[1:31:58] watereth are one there's no big eyes and
[1:32:01] little use is what he's saying and every
[1:32:03] man shall receive his own reward
[1:32:04] according to his own labor that's where
[1:32:06] you take it back to revelation where he
[1:32:07] says now every man is going to come up
[1:32:09] and his works are going to be tried and
[1:32:11] he says and if he's done the right thing
[1:32:12] it'll stand but if it doesn't then it's
[1:32:15] going to be destroyed but he says the
[1:32:16] man's soul will still be saved
[1:32:18] so he's saying build on the right thing
[1:32:20] and that means god's got to be a part of
[1:32:21] it from the very beginning he says for
[1:32:23] we are laborers together with god
[1:32:27] so we're working he says but ye
[1:32:30] the church of god he says you
[1:32:33] are god's husbandry you are god's
[1:32:35] building
[1:32:37] so it's not brother gerald's church it's
[1:32:38] not brother donnie reagan's church
[1:32:42] what is it it's god's building
[1:32:44] and guess what not everybody that's in
[1:32:46] this building necessarily is in the
[1:32:47] building
[1:32:48] of god
[1:32:49] we believe we want to believe everyone
[1:32:51] that's here is a true believer
[1:32:52] but god will determine that but not
[1:32:54] everyone that comes in says lord lord
[1:32:56] not everyone that comes in and says
[1:32:57] evening like fellowship not everyone
[1:32:59] that says brother jail brother gerald is
[1:33:00] necessarily going to be a believer
[1:33:02] but he says what you're god's husbandry
[1:33:04] god's the one that's taking care of it
[1:33:06] god has you in the palm of his hand and
[1:33:08] all we're doing is working with him
[1:33:09] according to what he tells us to do
[1:33:12] he says according to the grace of god
[1:33:14] which is given unto me as a wise master
[1:33:17] builder i have laid the foundation and
[1:33:20] another built it there upon but let
[1:33:22] every man take heed how he buildeth
[1:33:24] their upon
[1:33:25] what was that foundation
[1:33:27] christ
[1:33:28] it's always christ paul always points to
[1:33:30] christ i believe the greatest thing that
[1:33:31] happened to paul was that he realized he
[1:33:32] was nothing when he got knocked off the
[1:33:34] horse he realized all of my knowledge
[1:33:36] all of my training all of my schooling
[1:33:39] all of my reputation all of it is
[1:33:41] nothing
[1:33:42] he says i counted but dong i counted by
[1:33:44] poop
[1:33:46] i think it's okay to say that over the
[1:33:47] pulpit if it's in the scriptures right
[1:33:49] that's what his count that's what he
[1:33:50] accounted for that it's it's less than
[1:33:52] dirt
[1:33:53] that's what he said everything i bring
[1:33:55] to the table is less than dirt but he
[1:33:58] makes something out of whatever i can
[1:33:59] give him amen
[1:34:01] and he says it's grace
[1:34:03] of god that's given to him immense grace
[1:34:04] from start to finish
[1:34:06] for other foundation can no man lay than
[1:34:08] that which is laid which is jesus christ
[1:34:12] why am i saying this i'm saying it
[1:34:14] because you can't as an individual come
[1:34:16] into this and start doing things of your
[1:34:18] own will and of your own way
[1:34:21] the new birth
[1:34:22] when you look at a a baby
[1:34:24] and it's newly born what does a baby add
[1:34:26] to itself
[1:34:28] what does it do to itself
[1:34:29] how does it make itself all it does is
[1:34:32] it eats
[1:34:33] it eats and it sleeps and it eats and it
[1:34:35] sleeps and as a newborn baby in christ
[1:34:38] that's the only thing you're going to be
[1:34:39] able to do is eat and eat and eat and
[1:34:41] it's going to grow you and it's going to
[1:34:42] grow and it's going to grow you and
[1:34:43] guess what if he doesn't feed you then
[1:34:46] you can't grow
[1:34:47] you've got to feed on the right things
[1:34:48] to be a healthy baby and to grow up to
[1:34:50] be strong and and all these different
[1:34:52] things get your immune system built up
[1:34:54] and and whatnot right the only thing as
[1:34:56] a newborn babe you can do is eat
[1:34:58] so how are you going to start building
[1:34:59] things up you're you're newly born in
[1:35:00] christ and then you want to go out and
[1:35:01] save the world and do this and do that
[1:35:03] no
[1:35:04] there's a quote we're going to get to in
[1:35:05] a couple of services where brother
[1:35:06] brahms says that that you can't come out
[1:35:08] and just all of a sudden be everything
[1:35:09] for god
[1:35:11] you've got to give everything but you
[1:35:12] can't be everything because he's got to
[1:35:14] grow you up and mature he says it's a
[1:35:15] process that's going to bring you to a
[1:35:17] place where god can use you amen
[1:35:19] the only thing that we can do is foster
[1:35:21] the right environment
[1:35:22] the right atmosphere right we can make
[1:35:24] it easy for god or we can make it hard
[1:35:26] for god that's based on the things we do
[1:35:28] the people we hang around with and the
[1:35:30] food we eat
[1:35:31] meaning the things that we spend our
[1:35:33] time on right that's how we're eating
[1:35:35] that's how we're going to do it we can
[1:35:36] make it easy for him and we can make it
[1:35:38] easy for ourselves we can make it hard
[1:35:40] for him and then it's way harder on
[1:35:41] herself because it's not hard for god
[1:35:43] it's all the same to him
[1:35:44] god doesn't there's no such thing as
[1:35:46] hard for god everything's easy
[1:35:49] but for us it's hard amen amen
[1:35:53] so the question is if you can't make it
[1:35:55] happen why are you worrying
[1:35:57] about when it's not happening
[1:35:59] sometimes we think i ought to be further
[1:36:01] along
[1:36:02] sometimes we think why is it taking so
[1:36:04] long
[1:36:05] and we sit there and we worry and we
[1:36:07] wonder and we fret and maybe we look at
[1:36:09] somebody else and say well she's so much
[1:36:10] further ahead than me here he's so much
[1:36:12] further ahead right brother paul
[1:36:17] i i say that i'm not teasing brother
[1:36:18] paul i said if i was where brother paul
[1:36:20] was when i was at his age i'd be further
[1:36:21] ahead today
[1:36:22] i do believe this and this is to
[1:36:24] encourage young people i believe you're
[1:36:25] further ahead than most of us were at
[1:36:27] your ages
[1:36:28] because the word has grown the word has
[1:36:30] matured the ministry has matured your
[1:36:32] parents have matured so guess what
[1:36:34] you're getting to start from a higher
[1:36:35] starting point than everyone else did
[1:36:37] and so what you're accelerating quick
[1:36:39] more quickly i've been talking to
[1:36:41] ministers and they say the younger
[1:36:42] ministers are way ahead of where we were
[1:36:44] at their ages these days why because god
[1:36:46] is moving things more quickly and he's
[1:36:48] opened up more so that if you're if
[1:36:50] you're even halfway open to god and
[1:36:52] you're even before you get saved he can
[1:36:54] start to build things and get you ready
[1:36:56] for things and the minute that he comes
[1:36:58] into your life it's just like a rocket
[1:36:59] hits and all of a sudden you can start
[1:37:01] taking off and moving faster and faster
[1:37:03] and faster ahead
[1:37:05] amen i wasn't teasing brother paul i've
[1:37:07] told him this before to his face and i'm
[1:37:08] serious i believe that these young
[1:37:10] people are further ahead than we
[1:37:11] probably were at their ages that's just
[1:37:13] that i'll speak for myself
[1:37:16] okay maybe some of you were more
[1:37:17] spiritual than me when you were 17 18 20
[1:37:19] 25 27 these different things but they're
[1:37:22] further ahead and i look at the very
[1:37:23] young ministers and guess what they are
[1:37:26] really moving quickly
[1:37:28] what sincere hearts
[1:37:30] listen god's wrapping things up
[1:37:32] he's wrapping things up so that means
[1:37:34] that there's something there's 11th hour
[1:37:36] workers
[1:37:37] right there there's young babes in
[1:37:38] christ that have to mature very quickly
[1:37:40] and i believe he's doing that and it's
[1:37:41] under the preaching of the word and it's
[1:37:43] under hearts that are sincere and
[1:37:45] they're open to him and they're not open
[1:37:46] to anything else amen they're being
[1:37:49] raised in homes they're being raised
[1:37:50] with parents that are keeping those
[1:37:51] things out hopefully and it guards them
[1:37:54] from it so that when god comes in
[1:37:55] there's even less to hold them back by
[1:37:57] his grace amen
[1:37:59] young people i think you're moving
[1:38:00] quickly keep moving
[1:38:02] and then keep keep feeding on the right
[1:38:04] things keep praying keep seeking god
[1:38:07] keep seeking more of god i'm so proud of
[1:38:09] the young people here i think it's
[1:38:11] amazing that we have three generations
[1:38:12] here already
[1:38:14] it's amazing and it's god's grace to us
[1:38:17] but keep pressing don't rest on our
[1:38:19] laurels amen
[1:38:21] don't rest cause brother john said you
[1:38:22] were amazing brother paul
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:26] amen brother paul loves it when i
[1:38:27] mention him over the pulpit
[1:38:31] listen to this
[1:38:33] we're talking about paul amen and god
[1:38:34] had to train paul didn't he had to take
[1:38:36] him out on the back side of a desert for
[1:38:38] three three and a half years i think
[1:38:41] brother brahm says we've said we've read
[1:38:42] this quote many times but it bears
[1:38:44] repeating he says god can train a man
[1:38:46] take him a hundred years for 30 minutes
[1:38:48] of work
[1:38:49] god knows how to train
[1:38:54] what the schools have put in moses 40
[1:38:56] years it's taken 40 years to get it out
[1:38:59] but one time
[1:39:01] one time in the presence of the
[1:39:03] anointing one time in the presence of
[1:39:06] the burning bush he'd know more about
[1:39:08] god than he had learned in books in the
[1:39:10] 80 years of his life
[1:39:12] being raised in a spiritual home by
[1:39:15] people that knew that he was a deliverer
[1:39:17] that told him about his future that told
[1:39:19] him about the promise of god in his life
[1:39:21] in one minute one moment in the presence
[1:39:24] of that anointing in the burning bush he
[1:39:26] knew more about him than everything that
[1:39:27] he'd heard for 80 years
[1:39:31] that's how you know you've met god
[1:39:33] it's when you say i knew nothing until
[1:39:35] now amen
[1:39:37] he says god trains his men
[1:39:40] one
[1:39:41] then anoints them
[1:39:44] you know what happens today
[1:39:45] ministers people i think they're
[1:39:47] ministers that say i'm anointed
[1:39:49] where's your training
[1:39:51] because he's got to train you first and
[1:39:52] then he'll anoint you for it
[1:39:54] i've seen it in my own life three and a
[1:39:56] half years in the backside of the desert
[1:39:58] what training me before he could reuse
[1:40:00] me truly effectively i believe
[1:40:03] trains you then he anoints you gives
[1:40:06] them experience takes them through the
[1:40:08] rigid training down through the sands of
[1:40:10] burning punishment trying and testing
[1:40:13] and we all said i just want more and
[1:40:15] more of that
[1:40:16] no we don't that's what he's doing
[1:40:18] though
[1:40:19] not only does he do that to his prophets
[1:40:22] but he does it to his children
[1:40:25] so everybody's going to deal with this
[1:40:26] young and old men and female
[1:40:28] everybody's got to go through this
[1:40:30] every son that cometh to god must be
[1:40:32] chastened and tried tested by his word
[1:40:34] see why when the pinch comes
[1:40:37] the strong time when it faces death
[1:40:41] now it could be death of your career it
[1:40:43] could be death of your marriage it could
[1:40:45] be death of relationship it could be
[1:40:47] death of the church you're attending it
[1:40:49] can be death in a lot of different ways
[1:40:51] it can be death to your finances it
[1:40:53] could be death to your health
[1:40:55] death to the peace that you have the
[1:40:57] stability you have
[1:41:00] he says when it faces death are you able
[1:41:02] to stand there on the word of god and
[1:41:06] say god said so that settles it
[1:41:09] that's why he's training you that's why
[1:41:11] he's putting you through the system you
[1:41:13] know today we've got athletes that are
[1:41:14] faster stronger bigger meaner
[1:41:18] than they've ever been
[1:41:20] breaking records that if you compare
[1:41:22] even 50 years ago to what athletes could
[1:41:24] do in terms of speed and strength and
[1:41:26] and feats of endurance and whatnot today
[1:41:29] between technology and training
[1:41:31] it's not even close it's not even close
[1:41:33] you got men running a a two minute or a
[1:41:36] two hour marathon
[1:41:38] used to be two hours and 45 minutes
[1:41:39] three hours to run a marathon they'll
[1:41:41] run it sub two hours now
[1:41:43] with the right technology and with the
[1:41:45] right training
[1:41:46] the speed of our hockey players the
[1:41:49] power of our baseball players the size
[1:41:51] of our football players 13 000 calories
[1:41:53] a day they eat during training camp
[1:41:55] swimmers
[1:41:57] swimmers with backs this wide so
[1:42:00] developed because they've got trainers
[1:42:01] that'll take them through there so that
[1:42:02] when the trial comes
[1:42:04] they can perform like nobody's ever
[1:42:06] performed before michael phelps more
[1:42:08] gold medals than any other male swimmer
[1:42:10] and he does it over four four olympics i
[1:42:12] think
[1:42:13] 16 years he's done it and gold gold gold
[1:42:15] gold gold why tremendous training
[1:42:17] tremendous technology and guess what if
[1:42:19] they're doing that in the natural what's
[1:42:20] god doing in the spiritual amen we've
[1:42:22] said it before if satan's preparing his
[1:42:24] bride god's preparing his and guess what
[1:42:26] his is always going to defeat satan's
[1:42:29] amen
[1:42:31] but what is it
[1:42:33] it's not always an easy road is it
[1:42:36] if it's easy it's because you've got a
[1:42:37] break in your training not because the
[1:42:38] training's over
[1:42:41] as brother joe so lovingly told me when
[1:42:43] i moved here he says enjoy your
[1:42:44] relaxation because there's a that light
[1:42:47] at the end of the tunnel there that's a
[1:42:49] truck
[1:42:50] coming your way
[1:42:51] and i love how he cares for me so
[1:42:54] to take away all joy and peace in the
[1:42:56] moment
[1:42:57] because something is coming my way and
[1:42:58] he's right
[1:43:00] he's right
[1:43:02] and so trials come and testing's come
[1:43:03] and god keeps moving and god keeps
[1:43:05] working why because nothing grows on the
[1:43:07] top of the mountain it's a great time
[1:43:09] it's a great place there's lots of peace
[1:43:10] there's lots of rest not many people on
[1:43:12] top of the mountain are there
[1:43:14] but you don't do anything up there
[1:43:16] and then god what does he do he he gives
[1:43:18] you a little kick in the hind quarters
[1:43:20] and he says let's go down let's go
[1:43:22] through another valley we've got some
[1:43:23] more training to do right we got to
[1:43:25] battle again then we'll get you to
[1:43:27] another victory we'll give you a little
[1:43:28] breath then we'll keep going up and down
[1:43:30] and up and down until one day we just go
[1:43:32] right on out of here amen that'll be the
[1:43:34] final victory that we go through amen
[1:43:38] if life's difficult
[1:43:40] that's probably the best way for you to
[1:43:42] know that god's with you
[1:43:45] by that meaning that
[1:43:46] you're being matured
[1:43:49] you're being challenged
[1:43:50] you're having to stretch
[1:43:52] you're having to trust the word of god
[1:43:54] more than you ever did before
[1:43:56] not only that but that you're looking
[1:43:57] into your life
[1:43:59] you know sometimes i i sit there and
[1:44:03] i don't know why i pray it quite frankly
[1:44:05] because i know what comes with it but
[1:44:07] you pray to god for things that you know
[1:44:08] you need and you know when you pray for
[1:44:11] it what's coming down the road and it's
[1:44:12] a truck
[1:44:14] right it's not a light at the end of the
[1:44:15] tunnel it's a truck moving your way at
[1:44:16] 60 miles an hour
[1:44:18] it's like you you know the brother says
[1:44:21] i've heard many people say don't pray
[1:44:23] for patience
[1:44:26] because what's going to come your way is
[1:44:27] things that try your patience and you're
[1:44:28] saying i need patience and you're giving
[1:44:30] me things that take it away no he's
[1:44:32] training you
[1:44:33] right so you ask for love you ask for
[1:44:35] mercy ask for grace guess what you're
[1:44:36] going to sin
[1:44:37] people that you don't want to be
[1:44:38] merciful and people that you don't feel
[1:44:40] gracious towards that's right right but
[1:44:42] guess what if you need it and as you're
[1:44:44] growing into roles as you're going into
[1:44:46] ministries as you're growing into
[1:44:47] marriages and these different things as
[1:44:49] you're growing in your jobs
[1:44:51] you need more of certain attributes and
[1:44:53] so you say god i need more
[1:44:55] look out because he's gonna train you in
[1:44:57] it he doesn't just drop it into your
[1:44:59] soul that's not the way he works he
[1:45:01] trains it into you he gives you an
[1:45:02] opportunity to grow and mature into what
[1:45:04] you're asking for amen
[1:45:09] second corinthians 6 paul says be not
[1:45:11] unequally yoked together with
[1:45:13] unbelievers
[1:45:14] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:45:16] with unrighteousness and what communion
[1:45:17] had light with darkness
[1:45:20] and what concord hath christ with belial
[1:45:22] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:45:23] an infidel and what agreement had the
[1:45:26] temple of god with idols for ye are the
[1:45:28] temple of the living god
[1:45:30] as god has said i will dwell in them and
[1:45:32] walk in them and i will be their god and
[1:45:35] they shall be my people
[1:45:37] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:45:40] be ye separate saith the lord and touch
[1:45:42] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[1:45:45] you what's he doing he's calling out a
[1:45:47] church and he's separating them and he's
[1:45:48] saying don't even be associated
[1:45:51] with anything that's considered evil
[1:45:53] touch not the unclean thing don't even
[1:45:55] set your mind towards it don't set your
[1:45:57] eyes towards it don't give it your time
[1:45:59] don't give it your energy
[1:46:01] so that's the easy answer for many
[1:46:03] things we question our lives you say
[1:46:04] should i do it or should i not do it is
[1:46:06] it an unclean thing
[1:46:08] is it associated with unclean things
[1:46:11] sometimes the thing you're looking at
[1:46:12] may not in and of itself be but the
[1:46:14] association it has the thing it leads to
[1:46:16] the thing that is most often tied to
[1:46:17] that is definitely not clean and so you
[1:46:20] just say you know what i'm not even
[1:46:21] going to take the one step towards it
[1:46:23] i'm just going to stay in the middle i'm
[1:46:24] going to stay in that highway of
[1:46:25] holiness amen
[1:46:27] what is he saying don't get tied up with
[1:46:29] satan's eden and listen whether it's
[1:46:31] politics whether it's sports whether
[1:46:32] it's social media and social justice
[1:46:34] it's all satan's eden and that's why we
[1:46:36] do any of those things in very very
[1:46:39] light moderation
[1:46:41] and then you can know about it that's
[1:46:42] about it but to be involved with it it's
[1:46:45] a total waste of your time at satan's
[1:46:46] trap every time
[1:46:48] why because it's all unclean
[1:46:50] it's all unclean
[1:46:52] he says and we'll be a father unto you
[1:46:54] and you shall be my sons and daughters
[1:46:56] saith the lord almighty
[1:46:59] so this is
[1:47:00] right after his resurrection he's
[1:47:02] talking to them in luke 24 49 he says
[1:47:04] behold
[1:47:05] i will send the promise of my father
[1:47:06] upon you but tarry ye in the city
[1:47:09] jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:47:11] from on high he's saying separate
[1:47:13] yourselves and wait
[1:47:16] paul says separate yourselves christ
[1:47:18] says separate yourselves terry here
[1:47:20] don't spread yourselves out stay tight
[1:47:22] with each other and wait and if we go
[1:47:24] look in acts 1 we see a bit of a an
[1:47:27] opening of this and it says paul's
[1:47:28] talking he says the former treaties have
[1:47:30] i made out theophilus of all that jesus
[1:47:32] both began both to do and teach until
[1:47:35] the day in which he was taken up after
[1:47:37] that through the holy ghost had given
[1:47:40] commandments unto the apostles whom he
[1:47:42] had chosen so notice he spoke before he
[1:47:44] was taken up and then he says he
[1:47:46] continued speaking by the holy ghost to
[1:47:47] the apostles after he was taken up the
[1:47:50] voice never left the anointed one never
[1:47:52] stopped talking but paul says look he
[1:47:54] kept going and he kept talking even
[1:47:56] after he left this earth and the
[1:47:57] apostles are witnesses of that very
[1:47:59] thing amen amen that's why we don't stop
[1:48:01] when the prophet left
[1:48:03] because the holy ghost didn't die and
[1:48:05] the holy ghost definitely didn't leave
[1:48:07] so he's got to be speaking to somebody
[1:48:08] and he's speaking to a five-fold
[1:48:10] ministry for the ministry of the word
[1:48:12] but he's speaking to the bride of christ
[1:48:13] for their day-to-day lives each and
[1:48:14] every day that they'll stay close to him
[1:48:16] if you'll open your ears he'll speak to
[1:48:18] you
[1:48:19] it's really that simple amen
[1:48:21] it never stops till we go on a rapture
[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:25] and then after that we'll hear him what
[1:48:26] we'll see him face to face it'll it'll
[1:48:28] be exactly as it was back in eden he
[1:48:30] says to whom also he showed himself
[1:48:32] alive after his passion by many
[1:48:35] infallible proofs being seen of them 40
[1:48:37] days and speaking of the things
[1:48:39] pertaining to the kingdom of god i often
[1:48:41] wonder what jesus said in those 40 days
[1:48:43] because again still they had no clue
[1:48:44] what was coming their way all this talk
[1:48:46] of the comforter and and i'm going to
[1:48:48] come among you and i'm going to be with
[1:48:49] you and i'm going to manifest myself and
[1:48:51] you and all these things and he's
[1:48:53] telling them of things to come but i
[1:48:54] don't think they ever really grasped it
[1:48:55] until after the fact
[1:48:57] because they still hadn't had that
[1:48:59] foundation set yet
[1:49:01] he says and being assembled together
[1:49:02] with them commanded them that they
[1:49:04] should not depart from jerusalem so they
[1:49:07] came together that's why i said he told
[1:49:08] them not to separate or he separated
[1:49:10] them out they came together assembled
[1:49:13] them together and then he says stay here
[1:49:17] he says and wait for the promise of the
[1:49:19] father which saith he ye have heard of
[1:49:22] me
[1:49:23] for john truly baptized with water but
[1:49:25] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:49:28] not many days hence
[1:49:30] i find it amazing that they have healed
[1:49:33] the sick
[1:49:34] they cast out demons they have a
[1:49:36] revelation from the father and he says
[1:49:39] that you still haven't received power
[1:49:42] because so many for us if we were doing
[1:49:44] those works we'd say i've definitely got
[1:49:45] it
[1:49:47] if we cast out demons if we walked up
[1:49:49] and we healed a blind person a lame
[1:49:50] person if we cast out a cancer we'd say
[1:49:53] whoa i definitely got something and we'd
[1:49:55] say that's it i'm done i've reached the
[1:49:57] pinnacle of christianity
[1:49:59] and he says no no no when you've
[1:50:01] received power
[1:50:04] so they didn't have any power then he
[1:50:05] said
[1:50:06] not the power that he was looking for
[1:50:07] them to have
[1:50:09] what is it that's a trap of satan when
[1:50:10] he says when you do this and you do that
[1:50:12] that's when you're a real believer
[1:50:14] you've got to have a life changed the
[1:50:16] actions you do doesn't matter
[1:50:18] it doesn't matter at all
[1:50:20] we look there in matthew 7.
[1:50:22] sorry it says it shall receive ye shall
[1:50:24] receive power after that the holy ghost
[1:50:25] has come upon you and ye shall be
[1:50:27] witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and
[1:50:29] in all judea and in samaria and unto the
[1:50:32] uttermost part of the earth
[1:50:34] but we say well if you have those powers
[1:50:36] to cast out demons and these different
[1:50:38] things listen god honors faith
[1:50:40] you can go to a benny hinn meeting and
[1:50:42] get healed if you've got faith
[1:50:45] my mother knows people that have had
[1:50:46] that happen
[1:50:48] there are real miracles in benny hinn's
[1:50:49] campaigns
[1:50:51] is that man a true son of god
[1:50:54] not based on his doctrine he's not not
[1:50:56] based on his works he's not he's chasing
[1:50:57] monies chasing popularity and these
[1:50:59] things but that doesn't mean that god
[1:51:00] doesn't honor faith
[1:51:01] and there's people go in there and he
[1:51:03] preaches the word and people believe the
[1:51:04] word and god honors it regardless of
[1:51:06] what that man looks like
[1:51:09] matthew 7 says not everyone that sayeth
[1:51:11] unto me lord lord shall enter the
[1:51:13] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:51:14] will of my father which is in heaven so
[1:51:16] the will of god is the key to your
[1:51:18] entire life
[1:51:20] now he's not going to lose a one of you
[1:51:23] remember brother braham says he says you
[1:51:24] know if you're a child of god and you
[1:51:26] won't obey him what does he do he takes
[1:51:27] you
[1:51:28] right
[1:51:29] but if you're going to stay here then
[1:51:30] you're going to do the will of god
[1:51:33] or else
[1:51:34] and he'll give you opportunity he'll
[1:51:35] give you opportunity and if you don't do
[1:51:37] it then he takes you away but the key
[1:51:38] here is to do the will of the father the
[1:51:40] key is not to go around doing
[1:51:41] willy-nilly all the signs and wonders
[1:51:43] because jesus didn't even do that
[1:51:44] as much as jesus did he only did certain
[1:51:47] things at certain times
[1:51:49] now many will say to me in that day lord
[1:51:51] lord have not we prophesied in thy name
[1:51:54] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:51:56] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:51:58] they did
[1:51:59] and they do
[1:52:01] you can see it today
[1:52:03] pentecostal churches they still have
[1:52:04] plenty of miracles to go around
[1:52:07] they still do it it's still there
[1:52:10] he says then will i profess to them i
[1:52:13] never knew you
[1:52:14] depart from me ye that work iniquity now
[1:52:16] we've said this before there was no
[1:52:17] internet intimate relationship that word
[1:52:19] no there means an intimacy like a
[1:52:22] husband knowing his wife amen he says
[1:52:24] that was never there i told you what to
[1:52:26] do and you didn't do it so out you go
[1:52:28] you can't come in but he never denied
[1:52:30] that they had the works
[1:52:33] never denied they did it in his name
[1:52:34] never denied that they were real but he
[1:52:36] says i didn't know you and on that basis
[1:52:38] you can't come in
[1:52:40] he says therefore whosoever here at
[1:52:42] these sayings of mine and do with them i
[1:52:45] will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:52:47] built his house upon a rock now we're
[1:52:48] talking about building we're talking
[1:52:50] about christ building a church the
[1:52:51] called up ones so listen to this it says
[1:52:53] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:52:56] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:52:57] that house and it fell not for it was
[1:53:00] founded upon a rock now i want you to
[1:53:02] notice that a house that is built on
[1:53:03] christ doesn't keep the storms from
[1:53:06] coming
[1:53:07] it doesn't keep the bad weather it
[1:53:08] doesn't keep the trials it doesn't keep
[1:53:10] your strength from being tested
[1:53:12] but it means you'll stand
[1:53:14] that's what matters is will you stand
[1:53:16] it's not what comes your way it's will
[1:53:17] you stand despite what comes your way
[1:53:19] and he says if you build it the way
[1:53:21] you're supposed to build it it'll take
[1:53:22] everything that comes its way
[1:53:25] he says and everyone that heareth these
[1:53:26] saints of mine and doeth them not shall
[1:53:28] be likened unto a foolish man which
[1:53:30] built his house upon the sand and the
[1:53:32] rain descended and the floods came and
[1:53:34] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:53:35] and it fell and great was the fall of it
[1:53:38] what does sand do when water goes over
[1:53:40] it you ever stand at the beach i know
[1:53:42] our kids have done it i've done it
[1:53:44] you take and you build up a sand castle
[1:53:47] and then when the wave comes in what
[1:53:49] happens to the sand castle does it fall
[1:53:50] from the top
[1:53:52] no it washes out at the bottom doesn't
[1:53:54] it and as that wave goes it just washes
[1:53:56] washes washes and it literally will
[1:53:58] flatten that area after a couple waves
[1:54:00] and you don't even know that the castle
[1:54:01] was ever there it just takes it out from
[1:54:03] the bottom just removes it straight from
[1:54:05] its foundation because the foundation
[1:54:06] isn't solid or sure
[1:54:08] now put it on a block of concrete
[1:54:10] and let the waves hit against the
[1:54:11] concrete what does it matter
[1:54:14] it's going to stay there for as long as
[1:54:15] you're ever going to be alive
[1:54:16] right as long as it's built higher than
[1:54:18] the waves then you're going to be okay
[1:54:20] why because the concrete doesn't wear
[1:54:21] away like sand does but santa roads the
[1:54:23] minute water touches it and just slides
[1:54:25] away and the whole thing just drops down
[1:54:26] and becomes shapeless and goes back to
[1:54:28] its old self amen
[1:54:30] how many ministries have we seen do this
[1:54:33] we've seen it what was that what was
[1:54:34] that brother the great teacher uh ravi
[1:54:36] zacharias
[1:54:37] you know a great a great minister when
[1:54:39] it came to the explanation of the gospel
[1:54:41] and dealing with the world and their
[1:54:42] questions
[1:54:44] and then he what he dies and they find
[1:54:47] out that all along he's been something
[1:54:48] that he wasn't supposed to be
[1:54:51] we've seen it within the message we've
[1:54:52] seen it with the brothers that left him
[1:54:54] great ministries that have been there
[1:54:55] for 20 30 years perhaps
[1:54:58] and what happened when the storms of
[1:55:00] life came
[1:55:01] when doctrines came
[1:55:03] discrepancies came
[1:55:05] they said
[1:55:06] this ain't me they walked away i've seen
[1:55:09] it in my family i've seen it in my
[1:55:10] friends they men men and women alike and
[1:55:11] they fall away
[1:55:13] both within the message and outside of
[1:55:14] the message why because they didn't
[1:55:16] build on something sure they were built
[1:55:18] on an experience they were built on a
[1:55:19] second hand a third-hand experience they
[1:55:21] were built on knowing the doctrines and
[1:55:23] believing the doctrines were true and
[1:55:24] they never had a revelation of christ to
[1:55:26] them
[1:55:27] amen they didn't seek out their
[1:55:28] salvation with fear and trembling they
[1:55:30] assumed
[1:55:31] born in the message raised in the
[1:55:33] message i'm going in a rapture it's not
[1:55:35] going to take us there amen
[1:55:38] now what do they do they claim to have
[1:55:39] found the truth
[1:55:41] you know what's amazing is their truth
[1:55:42] looks exactly like the worlds
[1:55:44] and it has the exact same fruits and yet
[1:55:46] they think they've found the truth and
[1:55:48] nobody else has it and they've got to
[1:55:49] share it with everybody else and they
[1:55:50] have the exact same fruits i've seen it
[1:55:52] in my own family seen it with my own
[1:55:53] friends amen all the way down to drugs
[1:55:55] alcohol infidelity alternate lifestyles
[1:55:58] homosexuality completely denying the
[1:55:59] existence of god and they think they
[1:56:01] found truth
[1:56:03] they left with a spiritual attitude they
[1:56:05] left with a religious attitude and now
[1:56:06] what do they have nothing
[1:56:08] absolutely nothing they're devoid of god
[1:56:10] in every measurable way amen
[1:56:13] they're giving over to themselves that's
[1:56:14] what's going to happen you know that
[1:56:15] amen
[1:56:16] they're not free
[1:56:18] they're just not seeing anything good
[1:56:19] and they're bound to a new master and
[1:56:20] they don't even realize it
[1:56:22] that's the trap of satan as he says
[1:56:24] you're free
[1:56:25] and all he's doing is he's putting on
[1:56:27] one chain and one manacle after another
[1:56:30] and pretty soon you look down and you're
[1:56:32] like that crow and you're tied to a
[1:56:33] stake and you're going around and around
[1:56:34] and around you never realized it
[1:56:38] psalms 127 says accept the lord build
[1:56:41] the house they labor in vain that build
[1:56:44] it
[1:56:44] except the lord keep the city the
[1:56:47] watchman wakeeth but in vain amen
[1:56:50] brother braham says who has the answer
[1:56:52] the watchman that's on the wall has the
[1:56:54] answer watchman what of the night and
[1:56:57] the holy spirit is that watchman who is
[1:56:59] making ready the people and giving
[1:57:00] warnings from god
[1:57:02] he has been said as a watchman we see
[1:57:04] the sick being healed blinded eyes
[1:57:05] coming open deaf ears unstopped cripples
[1:57:08] walking the lame leaping like a heart
[1:57:10] fulfilling the what is it it's the
[1:57:12] coming of the lord pressing on
[1:57:15] says the very miracles that were in his
[1:57:17] ministry were a sign of the coming of
[1:57:19] the lord pressing down and into the
[1:57:21] people
[1:57:22] he says in these things and these
[1:57:24] warnings and the people continually
[1:57:26] press right on through to their beer
[1:57:27] parties until their times of folly and
[1:57:29] they frolic and they dance and they eat
[1:57:32] and they drink and they marry and
[1:57:33] they're given in marriage just as god
[1:57:34] said it would be no way of stopping them
[1:57:37] he says then if you notice in this great
[1:57:39] church age according to revelation 3 at
[1:57:41] this age now was the one who was given
[1:57:43] the morning star just before the coming
[1:57:45] watch how scriptural isaiah was when he
[1:57:47] said watchmen what of the night he said
[1:57:50] the morning cometh and the night also
[1:57:53] there's two things happening there's
[1:57:54] light coming and there's darkness coming
[1:57:56] simultaneously
[1:57:57] that's why you have a time where it's
[1:57:59] neither light nor dark because it's a
[1:58:01] blending of events where one is coming
[1:58:03] into the light and the other one is
[1:58:04] going all the way into darkness
[1:58:06] he says what the morning comes but the
[1:58:08] night comes just before the morning what
[1:58:11] was it anyone knows that just before the
[1:58:13] break of day just at the hours of the
[1:58:15] approaching of the day it turns darker
[1:58:18] than it ever was it's going to be light
[1:58:20] for us
[1:58:21] what's it going to be for the world
[1:58:23] they won't even see that light they just
[1:58:25] go on into darkness we're the last light
[1:58:28] to the last stage
[1:58:29] and really we're out here we're outside
[1:58:32] of the age completely and all they can
[1:58:33] see is a flicker of light out there
[1:58:34] that's the only light they're going to
[1:58:36] see in that darkness and then when we go
[1:58:38] it goes out
[1:58:39] and all you guys are 144 000 jews that
[1:58:41] get sealed with the holy ghost and ain't
[1:58:43] nobody gonna accept them
[1:58:45] they haven't been accepted today they'll
[1:58:46] never be accepted then
[1:58:49] he says oh my friends listen to thus
[1:58:52] saith the lord if you consider me to be
[1:58:55] a servant it's just before the break of
[1:58:58] day
[1:58:59] that's why this horrible gloom is over
[1:59:01] the earth it's just before the coming of
[1:59:03] the lord jesus there's no more hope left
[1:59:06] in nothing but his coming that's why
[1:59:08] we're not trying to fix our country
[1:59:10] that's why we're not trying to fix our
[1:59:11] economy that's why we're not trying to
[1:59:13] fix our people that's why we're not
[1:59:14] trying to fix our politics that's why
[1:59:16] we're not getting involved in any of it
[1:59:18] why there's no fixing it right
[1:59:21] it's dead it's gone the the logs on the
[1:59:24] skids that ain't coming back brother
[1:59:25] branham says it's done it's cooked it's
[1:59:27] burnt
[1:59:29] there's no more there's there's no more
[1:59:30] opportunity to fix it they gave it up in
[1:59:32] what 56 i think
[1:59:34] it was done
[1:59:36] it's done you can't bring it back
[1:59:38] so don't try and bring it back and don't
[1:59:40] get worked up about it never coming back
[1:59:42] because it ain't coming back the
[1:59:44] scripture says so the prophet told us so
[1:59:46] don't worry about it let it go he says
[1:59:48] nations are against nations and they
[1:59:50] fooled through god's laboratory until
[1:59:52] they got the power to blow one another
[1:59:53] into atomic ashes and they are wicked
[1:59:56] and they are unreligious and they're
[1:59:58] unchrist-like
[1:59:59] amen what a condemnation for this world
[2:00:03] and the only motive they have an object
[2:00:05] is to destroy and they are inspired by
[2:00:08] the destroying angel that was sent from
[2:00:10] heaven to inspire these men what an
[2:00:12] anointing a destroying spirit
[2:00:16] and you see it they're destroying
[2:00:17] themself
[2:00:19] they're destroying this world everything
[2:00:21] they do brings destruction because their
[2:00:22] anointing is
[2:00:24] destructive how are you going to get
[2:00:26] along with that
[2:00:28] how are you going to fix an anointing
[2:00:31] there's only two
[2:00:32] and he says the age has a destructive
[2:00:34] anointing on it
[2:00:36] he says let me say in the name of the
[2:00:38] lord jesus the holy spirit is sent as a
[2:00:41] watchman on the tower and the people cry
[2:00:43] what of the night
[2:00:45] how long is this going to go on for how
[2:00:48] long do we have to deal with it watchmen
[2:00:50] why is life so difficult
[2:00:53] why is the devil being so mean to me
[2:00:56] why am i struggling why am i fighting so
[2:00:58] much more than i used to
[2:01:00] he says are you weary of this life
[2:01:02] are you weary of sin are you weary of
[2:01:05] funeral processions and sickness and
[2:01:07] ungodliness on every hand has the night
[2:01:10] been long and weary
[2:01:12] what of the night watchmen he said the
[2:01:15] morning cometh
[2:01:16] he says see the comfort
[2:01:19] there's something coming that's going to
[2:01:21] bring you comfort
[2:01:23] there's going to be something that
[2:01:24] brings a light
[2:01:26] but you got to go through the darkness
[2:01:27] to get there
[2:01:29] but you got to trust that watchman that
[2:01:30] says there's light coming there's
[2:01:32] comfort coming there's a dawn that's
[2:01:34] coming that's going to bring you out of
[2:01:35] this darkness
[2:01:38] but you're going to have to wait for
[2:01:39] that
[2:01:40] the prophet of god says he's talking of
[2:01:42] a watchman the prophet is saying the
[2:01:44] holy spirit is warning us
[2:01:47] showing us signs
[2:01:48] listen we see signs all around us
[2:01:51] it wasn't just back then we seen
[2:01:53] you look at the prophecies of brother
[2:01:55] branham those seven visions and whatnot
[2:01:57] what's left
[2:02:00] nothing
[2:02:01] nothing's left
[2:02:03] everything that was to come before the
[2:02:04] the going away of the bride everything's
[2:02:06] happened as far as i know
[2:02:10] every sign the sign of what
[2:02:13] sodom and gomorrah
[2:02:16] right
[2:02:17] not just allowed but protected and
[2:02:19] endorsed by our governments
[2:02:22] right that's here as as much as you
[2:02:23] could ever imagine it
[2:02:25] but on the flip side we've seen the
[2:02:26] messiah sign that was the same sign of
[2:02:28] solomon gomorrah wasn't it you see light
[2:02:30] and you see darkness
[2:02:31] question is which one are you drawn to
[2:02:33] which one are you going with which one
[2:02:34] are you traveling with because why the
[2:02:36] light is outside the age now that's
[2:02:38] right
[2:02:40] it's been out there and it's what it's
[2:02:41] talking to the lord
[2:02:43] shall i hide from abraham what i'm going
[2:02:45] to do
[2:02:46] no
[2:02:47] so he tells him and he does the same
[2:02:48] thing to us he shows us everything
[2:02:50] that's happening tells us what's going
[2:02:51] on so that what we don't get worried
[2:02:53] about it and we don't get caught up into
[2:02:55] it the only thing we're trying to do is
[2:02:56] get our loved ones out
[2:02:58] that's the only thing that we're
[2:02:59] concerned with in that group
[2:03:01] get the loved ones out get the last seat
[2:03:03] out so we can all get out of here amen
[2:03:05] so then the light can come in its
[2:03:06] fullness amen
[2:03:08] when we read that scripture he says
[2:03:10] accept the lord build the house they
[2:03:11] labor in vain that build it he says
[2:03:13] unless the lord keep it the watchman
[2:03:15] riseth in vain what's he saying is you
[2:03:17] build something
[2:03:19] of your own making the lord didn't build
[2:03:21] it and the lord can't keep it which
[2:03:23] means no matter what watchmen you put up
[2:03:24] there whether it's a secure job whether
[2:03:26] it's your financial advisor whether it's
[2:03:28] your your great friends or your
[2:03:30] alliances with ministries and whatnot
[2:03:32] none of that is going to keep you
[2:03:33] through this
[2:03:34] the only thing that's going to keep you
[2:03:36] is if the lord builds it and he puts the
[2:03:37] watchman of the holy spirit into your
[2:03:39] life so that you can see what's coming
[2:03:41] down that path and you can get ready for
[2:03:42] it not because you see it but because
[2:03:44] you believe the watchman that tells you
[2:03:47] the watchman always had the greatest
[2:03:49] eyesight
[2:03:50] they don't put blind people up there for
[2:03:51] watchmen
[2:03:52] they don't put dumb people up there for
[2:03:54] watchmen they put people up there that
[2:03:56] can see and recognize what's coming
[2:03:57] their way and what did he say the holy
[2:03:59] spirit was going to do show us things to
[2:04:01] come
[2:04:02] so he's showing us what's coming
[2:04:04] not just the bad so we're warned but
[2:04:07] he's telling us there's good that's
[2:04:08] coming along with this as well keep
[2:04:10] going keep fighting stick with your
[2:04:11] training
[2:04:13] there's a battle coming stick with your
[2:04:15] training but there's a victory coming if
[2:04:17] you'll go through with it amen
[2:04:19] we don't necessarily see it all but we
[2:04:21] ask god and he sends us a prophet and he
[2:04:23] sends us dreams and he sends us
[2:04:25] scriptures to open our eyes to what's
[2:04:26] going on around us
[2:04:28] there's nothing hid i don't believe from
[2:04:29] the bride these days
[2:04:30] we see what's going around you see
[2:04:32] ministers diving in you see the lady
[2:04:33] diving into it and they'll go and
[2:04:34] they'll say look at what is happening
[2:04:36] over here and they'll tie right back to
[2:04:37] what the prophet said in the quote and
[2:04:39] you'll see it exactly the way he said it
[2:04:40] was going to happen
[2:04:41] what is it there's nothing hidden from
[2:04:43] us anymore it's an open book which means
[2:04:45] that god's come down and he's giving us
[2:04:46] every single thing that we need to get
[2:04:48] out of here and be aware of what's going
[2:04:50] on amen
[2:04:53] it's always darkest he said before the
[2:04:55] light breaks over the horizon it's not
[2:04:56] just gloomy it's pitch black
[2:05:00] it's pitch black there's that contrast
[2:05:01] and then the light breaks over and
[2:05:02] you're like wow
[2:05:04] it really was dark there was a lot of
[2:05:06] things around me i couldn't see before
[2:05:08] now
[2:05:09] but now i can see it in that lighting
[2:05:11] man
[2:05:11] he says what hold on morning's coming
[2:05:13] the comfort's coming the comforter is
[2:05:15] coming
[2:05:16] i mean i'm wrapping this up in a little
[2:05:18] package as we start to close in john 14
[2:05:20] i'll take it back to the original
[2:05:21] scripture he says and i will pray the
[2:05:23] father and he shall give you another
[2:05:24] comforter that he may be that he may
[2:05:26] abide with you forever even the spirit
[2:05:28] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[2:05:31] because it seeth him not
[2:05:33] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[2:05:36] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[2:05:38] amen i will not leave you comfortless i
[2:05:41] will come to you yet a little while in
[2:05:43] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[2:05:46] because i live you shall live also at
[2:05:49] that day you shall know that i am in my
[2:05:50] father and ye and me
[2:05:52] and i and you he says what the day the
[2:05:54] comforter comes the day i come back to
[2:05:56] you he says that's the day you're gonna
[2:05:58] know that i was in the father and you're
[2:06:00] in me and i'm in you
[2:06:02] that was the promise of how he was going
[2:06:04] to build the whole church the true
[2:06:05] church
[2:06:06] of god he was going to do it by the
[2:06:08] indwelling presence of himself amen
[2:06:11] inside a body of believers tabernacling
[2:06:12] the holy spirit in a way that had never
[2:06:14] been experienced before
[2:06:17] now we see that happen in acts chapter 2
[2:06:18] it says and when the day of pentecost
[2:06:20] was fully come they were all with one
[2:06:22] accord in one place that means they were
[2:06:24] in the same place with the same purpose
[2:06:27] sometimes we're in the same place but
[2:06:29] with different purposes
[2:06:31] that's not what does it we've got to
[2:06:32] come in here with the same purpose
[2:06:34] when you can get the people in unity
[2:06:36] nothing can stop them from hearing from
[2:06:38] god i firmly believe that listen if they
[2:06:40] could do it at the if god had to come
[2:06:42] down and destroy babel because he says
[2:06:43] look these people are so unified that
[2:06:45] we're not going to be able to stop them
[2:06:47] that's the language he used if
[2:06:49] unbelievers combining together and
[2:06:51] unified in one idea could could cause
[2:06:54] god to say whoa
[2:06:56] what ought to happen when believers come
[2:06:58] in under a unity amen
[2:07:00] because what we're going to be unified
[2:07:01] with his mind with his purpose and
[2:07:03] that's what brings god on the scene is
[2:07:04] when we're all pulling for the same
[2:07:05] thing two or three ask in my name if you
[2:07:08] agree
[2:07:09] on one thing imagine if we have 20 or 30
[2:07:11] agreeing in his name on the exact same
[2:07:12] thing what would happen in those
[2:07:14] situations
[2:07:16] he says and suddenly there came a sound
[2:07:18] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[2:07:20] and it filled all the house where they
[2:07:22] were sitting
[2:07:23] and there appeared unto them cloven
[2:07:25] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[2:07:27] each of them and they were all filled
[2:07:29] with the holy ghost and began to speak
[2:07:31] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[2:07:33] them utterance 120 people in the top
[2:07:35] floor of a house sweating it out praying
[2:07:38] waiting in god from full obedience for
[2:07:40] ten straight days
[2:07:43] they'd seen christ ascend they'd gone
[2:07:45] over his words time and time again i'm
[2:07:47] sure he'd preached to them for 40 days
[2:07:49] and i imagine they're sitting there
[2:07:50] saying this is what he said and do you
[2:07:52] remember what he said here remember how
[2:07:53] he put it this way and that way and
[2:07:56] they're reminding each other of all the
[2:07:57] things that he said and promised and all
[2:07:59] the things he told them to do amen
[2:08:01] i'm sure they wondered what it was going
[2:08:03] to be like
[2:08:04] what's this power going to feel like
[2:08:07] you know what i'll bet they had some
[2:08:08] praising moments i'll bet they had some
[2:08:10] some great song services in there as
[2:08:12] they tried to keep their morale up and
[2:08:14] and tried to create an atmosphere
[2:08:16] and maybe they started doing some
[2:08:17] dancing and singing i don't know
[2:08:20] maybe they had a great moment
[2:08:22] and they said this is it
[2:08:24] because they didn't know what it was
[2:08:26] they didn't know what it was going to
[2:08:27] look like maybe they got themselves
[2:08:28] worked up
[2:08:29] maybe they got themselves worked down
[2:08:32] maybe they're like it's been nine days
[2:08:35] and 23 hours and 59 minutes and nothing
[2:08:38] has happened
[2:08:40] maybe they got down i don't know
[2:08:42] scripture says they stayed in unity
[2:08:43] though they stayed there with one
[2:08:45] purpose
[2:08:46] i'm curious about their morale maybe
[2:08:48] they wondered if anything was going to
[2:08:50] happen at all at that point
[2:08:51] but the scripture says
[2:08:53] suddenly
[2:08:56] that means without warning in a moment
[2:08:58] of time
[2:09:00] as far as we know based on that there
[2:09:02] was no build up there was no you know
[2:09:04] sometimes you're in special services and
[2:09:06] and things kind of start to move up and
[2:09:08] that you start to feel a presence and it
[2:09:10] starts to get heavier and heavier and
[2:09:12] heavier
[2:09:13] it's not always
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:16] sometimes it builds up to something
[2:09:17] doesn't it
[2:09:18] that's not what happened here scripture
[2:09:20] says suddenly
[2:09:22] yeah
[2:09:24] god came out
[2:09:26] god fulfilled his word
[2:09:27] suddenly
[2:09:28] they were filled with the holy ghost
[2:09:30] amen nine hours 23 minutes 23 hours 59
[2:09:36] minutes and 59 seconds of nothing
[2:09:38] happening and in one second the word
[2:09:40] went from nothing to everything
[2:09:43] and they knew what it meant to be filled
[2:09:44] with power
[2:09:46] peter knew what it meant to have the
[2:09:48] revelation of jesus christ
[2:09:51] peter knew what it meant to have a
[2:09:52] commission and know what to do with it
[2:09:54] peter knew what it meant to have the
[2:09:55] keys of the kingdom and know how to use
[2:09:56] them
[2:09:57] in one second
[2:09:59] he went from nothing he went from a
[2:10:01] potential child of god to a manifested
[2:10:04] son of god just like that
[2:10:07] in one moment praise the lord so many
[2:10:09] times we're looking we're saying
[2:10:10] nothing's happening
[2:10:12] or nothing's happened i prayed and i
[2:10:14] prayed and prayed like daniel
[2:10:16] daniel waited three weeks the angel said
[2:10:18] i heard you on the first day but i ran
[2:10:20] into some trouble and i had to fight my
[2:10:22] way to get to you
[2:10:24] right
[2:10:27] it's not always quick
[2:10:30] joshua had to march for six days and not
[2:10:33] a single stone fell off of jericho
[2:10:35] then he had to go around seven times on
[2:10:37] the seventh day
[2:10:39] and then in one moment those walls fell
[2:10:42] david had to wait 7 15 years to get a
[2:10:45] portion of israel as king
[2:10:47] and then he had to wait another seven
[2:10:49] years to get the rest of it
[2:10:50] 22 years for david to become a king and
[2:10:53] in that entire time all it looked like
[2:10:54] was he was getting further and further
[2:10:56] away from the road
[2:10:58] from the throne and about to lose his
[2:10:59] life every day for david looked like he
[2:11:01] was going to die
[2:11:03] under the promises of god
[2:11:05] abraham
[2:11:06] 25 years of getting old 24 years and
[2:11:10] three months of getting old and getting
[2:11:12] old and getting old to the point where
[2:11:13] he and his wife were incapable of
[2:11:16] having children in any way
[2:11:19] nothing happening
[2:11:20] and then in one moment
[2:11:23] everything changed
[2:11:25] what was it a visitation from the lord
[2:11:29] amen now is the day that's what he said
[2:11:32] now is the time
[2:11:34] in the time of the month that it's
[2:11:35] supposed to happen
[2:11:37] you're gonna conceive and then you're
[2:11:38] gonna have a baby
[2:11:40] and guess what sarah was still looking
[2:11:41] wrinkled and old
[2:11:43] and abraham had lost all zest
[2:11:46] there's nothing there
[2:11:47] but in a moment
[2:11:49] suddenly
[2:11:50] everything changed and god fulfilled his
[2:11:53] work
[2:12:00] so many times it looks like we're going
[2:12:01] backwards because nothing's happening
[2:12:05] i want to encourage you to keep pressing
[2:12:06] amen
[2:12:08] because so often it's suddenly
[2:12:12] nothing's happening nothing's moving
[2:12:15] nothing's going the way we wanted it to
[2:12:17] go
[2:12:18] our faith was high it's ebbing lower and
[2:12:20] lower
[2:12:21] body's not changing health's not
[2:12:23] changing finances aren't changing
[2:12:25] relationships not changing
[2:12:27] ministry is not getting any better
[2:12:30] all you're looking for is one moment in
[2:12:32] his presence
[2:12:33] all you're looking for is one visitation
[2:12:36] all you're looking for is god's timing
[2:12:38] it's all you're looking for is god's
[2:12:40] timing and all of this
[2:12:42] right it's all he's looking for if
[2:12:44] you'll stand there remember when the
[2:12:45] crunch comes
[2:12:47] when the death moment comes remember
[2:12:48] when death comes your way
[2:12:50] and tries to kill your faith tries to
[2:12:51] kill your commitment
[2:12:53] that's when you've got to be able to
[2:12:54] stand there and say what what brother
[2:12:55] branham said
[2:12:56] his word says it and i believe it
[2:12:59] that's what they had to do for 10 days
[2:13:01] of hot sweaty days and nights with 120
[2:13:04] people in an upper room
[2:13:06] stay there until suddenly happened
[2:13:09] amen
[2:13:10] amen
[2:13:11] listen
[2:13:12] god doesn't just trickle in
[2:13:16] where do you see in scripture where god
[2:13:17] gives and dribs and drabs
[2:13:20] that's never the promise is it
[2:13:22] god pours in
[2:13:24] and then he overflows and he tamps down
[2:13:26] he presses it and he shakes it together
[2:13:28] until you can't even contain it
[2:13:30] that's what it looked like on the day of
[2:13:31] pentecost
[2:13:32] it wasn't something that they said oh
[2:13:34] yeah that's about right i can handle
[2:13:36] this
[2:13:37] when god touches you you can't handle it
[2:13:40] it overcomes you
[2:13:41] it overflows you you have no choice in
[2:13:45] it because it's all him that's right so
[2:13:47] many times what he's doing in the
[2:13:48] waiting is he's getting you out of the
[2:13:50] equation
[2:13:51] so that when you know when it happens it
[2:13:53] was all him and it had nothing to do
[2:13:56] with you amen he exceeds expectations
[2:13:58] doesn't he can you say he's exceeded
[2:14:00] expectations in your life amen so often
[2:14:04] it was because he did it in his time not
[2:14:06] in yours and he did it his way not your
[2:14:08] way you know what i do believe we're
[2:14:09] going to tap in and i believe we're
[2:14:11] tapping into the way god does things as
[2:14:13] we learn and grow
[2:14:15] and you start to recognize points and
[2:14:16] you start to recognize junctions and you
[2:14:18] say this is the start of his move this
[2:14:20] is the start of his work this is the
[2:14:22] start of a miracle this is the start of
[2:14:23] a healing this is the start of a
[2:14:24] deliverance and you start to catch those
[2:14:26] moments by faith and i believe that's
[2:14:28] the holy spirit quickening us to those
[2:14:30] things but so often the real fruit of it
[2:14:32] isn't seen till days and months and
[2:14:33] weeks and years sometimes down the road
[2:14:36] when you see that coming but you
[2:14:37] recognize hey something's going on and
[2:14:39] your faith rises up and says i'll hold
[2:14:41] on to that until it comes all the way
[2:14:42] throughout amen
[2:14:44] if we'd stand together
[2:14:46] i mean god's timing is perfect
[2:14:52] scripture says though we tarry wait
[2:14:54] because eventually he's not going to
[2:14:56] tarry when he comes he comes quickly
[2:14:59] amen
[2:15:01] keep moving
[2:15:02] keep believing
[2:15:04] keep pressing keep feeding
[2:15:06] keep separating amen that's what he
[2:15:08] wants us to do let's just bow our heads
[2:15:10] together heavenly father
[2:15:14] lord we can rest that this is a work of
[2:15:16] yours
[2:15:18] lord that we have a portion of your
[2:15:20] church here today

[2:15:31] spirit of god in living vessels lord

[2:15:40] evening

[2:16:23] them this evening and over the coming
[2:16:25] days and weeks lord that they would see
[2:16:27] lord themselves in the mirror of the
[2:16:28] word and see themselves as victorious
