will anointing brother in this hour amen especially in the light of a revelation I want to share with you just before we really get the message a man brother we need to know what God has done what God is doing and a man and not just to have their what he's doing here he's doing he knew they met the grace of God turn with me to the book of numbers chapter 14 a man and remind that you can get a copy of this calendar as you wish it and the voice of God has sent I think was neon copies of this calendar and just to show you the January month see this is January so you can get a copy calendar on your on your way out amen and again it saw it on advertised on the on the voice of God cortines homepage amen I was thinking about ordering some copies but I didn't realize that brother Joseph already 20 copies in the mail a man I think is around 20 H or and so there be there's there's a lot there for all of us man God blesses and in numbers for Dean pay attention to the word because it comes by hearing the word amen but have the faith that God wants us to have understanding that God wants us to have a man and again that will bring out shortly because earnings people say I believe the message but again as the father of God you believe it in your head because you don't believe it in your heart amen so again this list I press whether it's of God that we're not going to believe it intellectually we're going to believe it spiritually God has revealed it to us in our source amen there are many of their believing it intellectually but again they're not bitter spiritually they say I believe the message and they go to what they want to do and oh yeah they try to justify themselves they're gonna do what they whatever is right in their own eyes they'll do this do that oh yeah but I be the message amen but that's that's as far as it goes we're brother when it comes to what others require he's looking for the word manifested in your flesh amen and now that I believe it in my head but brother let go go forth and show show them all go forth and reflected to the world as Jesus did a man and brother that was again remember again that was the that was the bridegroom and now he's in the bride a man and again he's gonna he's gonna live Dame life take the same stand and same testimony a man gonna stay with the word amen he stayed with the word for that day 2,000 years ago now in you he's going to stay with the word of this day amen so the grace of God with us and here's a lesson here in numbers chapter 14 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night they had come but imitated to go into the promise they were rejoicing with with God God Gabriel with what God did to bring them out but they weren't they weren't really into what God wanted them to do to go in and possess the land amen so god help us and as says they lifted up their voice right and the people went that night but they were seeking the will of God and it said all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them but God that we had died in the land of Egypt a man mister don't give that spirit don't get that anointing on you a may the God that brought us out is going to take us in but we got to be willing pay the price amen and it says they would want to die in the land of Egypt or would God we had died a wilderness here in the wilderness we're going in a brother we don't want to die here we want me to the resurrection of rapture by the grace of God and we and again there's a price that they had pay is a price we have the bet by the grace of God and he's there he's there a man - out of ride paid that price and he said before and the Lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not for us to return into each it's coming to that place we would feel worthless better for us to go back to this denomination or that denomination no hi Priya grace of God that we got revelation that's what this encouraging stuff press on I saw don't look back look forward a man and the trouble is true they are looking back the grace of gummy with us and they said one to another let us take a captain and let us return into Egypt wheezing they're gonna make them their own Egypt Egyptian bondage a mate and there are those that are making their own denominational bondage a man they're following the preacher of that preacher another ature and it's just a denominational Smith a man and they said let us make a captain and let our return into either and then Moses and Aaron fill on their faces before all the Assembly of the cognate realm of Israel and Joshua this nun and Caleb that on a Jew who met which were of they that searched the land rent their clothes oh yeah they forbade because the Israelites and that attitude and a spirit they didn't want worn they want to go back a man they want to just settle down to there and settle into that but Josh when Kayla want to go and finish and fight the that was going to take him into the Promised Land a man oh yeah they believe that the others believe they were Jews believed under the under the message of Moses and so on but they they believe her to come out but didn't believe you in a man a brother that's the thing that we're going to base with a rover we're going to challenge with his lies there are we gonna but we believe that God brought us out do we believe that is going to take is here and brother not going to ears amen and I share with you a quote in just a moment that you know what's going on and what odd is doing and I pray God in the name of Jesus we're going to let on that God at his way we don't want to back to this or fall into that spirit come under that anointing come under the influence of that denominational spirit don't mean going to go back there but you're going to that spirit as the Jews it did indeed only are the end Alumnus oh yeah they they would they were they were blessed as far as they were concerned by Joshua and Caleb why because Joshua and Caleb had the revelation in the Ark of the promised land they had the revelation in the heart gods are going to give it to you a man didn't matter to them who was in it dinner then what they had to do how sad to fight a man they're going to get land a man and just think because of their staying you right here that the trouble of Israel gonna kill them Hey the trouble is Rwanda Israel lived raised up stones and stoned stone Joshua stone Caleb some Moses what yeah they were geo juice gonna stone them why because they did they they'd the heat to go in a man though but the others only at the faith them out following Moses s writers have followed william branham those have followed this and this sign and that sign aimed but then the bride got into the word amen and now there's god's not read the prophet not responsible it's the blood responsible a man no he was a little area he made the part of god was one do it is wondering about that until finally the angel come down and says brother and said lay it in their lap and he shouldn't leave it and he said you cool off you're not going you're not going to answer for that he's are you bleeding in their lap doing that for a man so the same thing with the word today in the measure day that issue so laid in the lap of the papal a man so the men every one answer for it the people are going to answer for it that's all we gotta do something it's between you god amen so the lease of god brother that we're glad the Ananya of joshua and caleb not the trail of israel that want to go back Egypt amen tribunal under car the invoice of the hub of an Egyptian spirit no no we want the influence of the of the Word of God a man God's influence and that was on Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of James the land and says they rent their clothes because they felt so bad and because of the undies they felt so bad because of the attitude of those people and they spake on to all the many of the children of Israel saying the language we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land and all they agree with that yeah but look look who's in there again came to but God said he be with us got it every every place of footer for the that full your foot just ready to give it to you a man that God would give to turn them over and give them the tree brother he got the victory in Egypt should get the victory in the promised land amen and again verse 10 and ice maker on all the company of the troll Israel saying that land which we true to search it it's an exceeding good land and brother with many hours plenty of says wonderful and he said have the Lord laid in us then he will bring us into this land and put us and he said a land which fluid the milk honey only rib em not ye against the Lord people don't know and understand are not rebuilding in this ministry that ministry that or this rebel in that revelation to rebelling it's God the God is giving us this relish in that revelation he wants us to put us on that revelation man so he said only rebel nonny against the Lord neither hear ye the people of the land that's right for they are brave or us their defenses departed from them and Lord is with us fear them not and concerning what's going on the world today in Australia the plane crash and other killings that are going on in world brother thought Elvis who are not going to be afraid our faith is in God that was going on in the world our faith is in God a man and it says but all the congregation bade stone them stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this book provoke me and how long will it be here they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them it will smite them with the peasants and disinherit them and will make of the greater nation and mightier then day today God blesses words or may be seated amen this take that word and think the message and apply it to our lives a man which writer we are are we under the anointing of the Jews that wanted to go back to Egypt are we only annoying of the Jews in in the Willis or are we under the unity of Caleb and Joshua a mayor that really want to win that we really want to get out of here and into eternity maybe we didn't want to go into glory knowing and knowing that whatever the life's whatever the cost God is going to provide it a man that is going to give us the strength we need God him to give us the encouragement we need a man so in there there are those that are that our brother that are fearful a man I'll tell you this more and more to get fearful that's the absolute truth because why they leaned for this they're looking for that but whether we got to look at what God wants us to look for and we got to do it the way that God wants us to do it amen we got experienced it the way that God was just to experience it a man is like the quote leader in the message Christ in his own word August 19 and 65 and that they came to this place then how much war and we experienced if they have a brother experience at back van and I put a pile of gone and to understand what was going on spiritually and brother have much much more is going on now that was going on there amen so the grace of God brother that that weren't going to be discouraged by what we're experiencing a mayor and God is going to a lot of us to come to pass a man it's going to excel in our faith he's challenging us do you really believe what I have done a man and do you really believe I am doing a man is until you rejoice in coming out of domination or Bunch but are you are your rejoicing going into the Promised Land in May of the glorified bought praise the name of the Lord and brother let's see if I can find that yes a saying in this message it is on page 40 and he should have fame minister he said said a while ago and he said brother Branham if I could just have the joy of the Lord in my heart because amen he fell he was be vinod he was following God following our leadership but wasn't experiencing the anointing that he used to experience it wasn't he wasn't in the land it wasn't in the ending the church anyway no matter where he went he couldn't he couldn't find that joy of the Lord and the partners on what the part of God said all brothers either getting to the message and you get the joy of the Lord now Oh see it's more serious and yeah and he give it gives us a challenge to me it is a chance to go in and possess the land a man and his shirts and the public guard said this to the brother and he said son he was asking where's the joy and he says son he said the revival is over amen and this was August 1965 and he says see now he said the stabilisers has been put on the ship amen it's not like a use of an end it's going with the leaves in it and everything and all we have Berets Lord hallelujah may know we're faced with a with a greater challenge amen and he says see the stabilisers is put on the ship and he said great fearful waves are earlier before us that's why we're feeling the when he filled a man considering what is what prophecies were going to fulfill in this hour and in this age you and I are witness what they never witnessed a man because God had already known this through the Ministry of a prophet he's sure but it was ejected a man he was turned down and listened see the prophet of God was given these two signs and what for he's to get a people to believe God is looking for looking for in you and in me it is our faith that we believe what God is doing a man is not just good to be able to believe what God has done can you believe we believe what God was doing in their day now us to believe what God is doing in her day a may because this all 50 years since the goal of the Prophet a man and so he said the son he said you do when it comes to this joy you delivered it in your heart you know feel it and to son the revival is over and the stabilisers has been put on the ship and the graves are out here before us but we know just beyond the way under we're nearing the show amen but we're seeing the surgeon of the ailment but at the same time we have the revelation of what God is doing in taking us a time in into eternity we have the relation of what God is doing and care in bringing us into a resurrection and a wrap through faith brother this Mendes well this is not Luthor and his justification I see our sanctification and the Pentecostals and the bathroom of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit whether we're going beyond it to the resurrection and the rapture amen look and look what that relation did to them in their day and there are what is this revelation to us a man they that relation controlled him a man and and his ruling revival the ministry by with a Pentecost revival in other labels but what in a bright revival brother is not going to be like their Wesley or Pentecost no no no my bro sister garland although the revivals God was bringing forth and say well you believe this you believe oh yeah I believe praise the Lord and they worship God and they praise the Lord oh my what a time that they're having in Luther's age in Wesley's in the Pentecostal a a man but now when the time is right having because our brother is not is not just really rejoicing in the revelation of negation not just choice in the revelation of sanctification or the baptism of the holy gold or the gifts of the Spirit amen brother God is requiring more lost than he required of them a man God reclaimer as he required moral josh trank allah did every cueto the others day to believe a may by Jordan Caleb Billy a man and ones God brought the solution a may God was looking for that faith Joshua to Memphis his faith had to exercise their faith a man to afford to go up to the border of the promised land and get ready to in the possess it man sir brother God is looking for us to go Leon Luther Wesley and the Dacascos right up to the border of the promised land of the resurrection and the rapture amen amen it's not just believing praise God hallelujah Lord I thank you for this relation I thank you for that revelation that revelry yeah but what the revelation that he's required of you what a revelation you dare to acknowledge the revelation he want you to accept the responsibility of it amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother the god loser went on and preached justification Amen he believed it oh I'm justified of you are you are you sure yes I'm justified ain't man the Bible says that Jesus were justified in Jesus amen we're sanctified in Jesus we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Jesus and the gifts of the Spirit we have access to all these things but that's good pray Lord amen but now hallelujah now there's a greater revelation now God looking for now oh he got he got all the rest but what is he looking for now in the capstone any man in the capstone of divine love look what a duty in the word in flesh in Jesus what's it doing in the word in flesh in the bright Amen hallelujah brother hallelujah not to do this and go on no no in this light but it's to do this and get out of here old brother God is requesting something tremendous as he did concerning Joshua and Caleb and the trill of Israel but again look look yeah it was only two out of so many million yeah only two hundred so many million there that was what wanted to go in and possess the land amen only two it has so many men of the children of Israel they came out of Egypt that really had the revelation of the Promised Land the revelation that God wanted them to go in and possess it but you know again we're living in a generation that like that generation that came out of Egypt the God do this God do that God do this Lord I want you to do this North Sea they didn't want to go in to fight the battle no no Oh God look what you did in Egypt do it to con the Lord you just destroy them no God wanted you to go in what is it now it's your faith amen this was God Amen you taught me the grace of God that was the grace of God that ever Israel out of Egypt any man what was God a God was fulfilling his word it was a promise that he had made to Moses and he and he solicited Sherman are going to be forwarded on her jeers in a strange land and they're gonna be slaves and so on but he said I'm gonna deliver them I'm gonna bring them out a man and brother I tell you this all mine when they were in Egypt when they were slaves they were in bondage they were under trouble under stress and brother the Bible says they were praying and praying Oh Lord you said Oh Lord you said you know you do this do that ain't man and yeah and God said I remembered my promise and I've come down to deliver them amen but a man they were there to welcome that but they weren't there to go in further hey but the God did that see it's like it's like in this hour in this age to the Ministry of will they braid them as they watch through the Ministry of Moses brother what Moses had to do with a better way to do what we do better than that if Moses had to do and what was that get the people to believe a man and they believed to come out but they didn't believe they William a man so as the same thing in this hour of this age we believe that come out of denomination but how many are believing to go into the Promised Land and they are believing to go into the resurrection and the rapture amen oh yeah they believe the message but let's let let's act on the message let's go to live demand let the message be flesh in you amen by the grace of God let the message control you they've become a prisoner to the message become a prisoner to the word ain't no Joshua and Caleb I became prisoners in Egypt they were prisoners in the wilderness they were prisoners to go in and possess the Promised Land anybody they weren't going to they weren't going to be influenced way by anything else but the word there were go the influenced way to the else but the servant of God Moses amen they stayed with the word they stayed with the message they stayed with the messenger a man and the God took the messenger off the scene ain't mayor that's right Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a man again the evidence of what God did God is doing a name that God took the messenger of the sea took Moses into the mountain a mannington and called him into glory amen and he said Joshua and Caleb on do with the leadership into the Promised Land ah there was another generation that rose up to go in and possess the promised land by the grace of God but just saying as he did so he has done today he took the messenger off the scene but he leaves us with the message and the responsibility what for to possess the promise for this hour and whether you faced gone Belarus a had gone way beyond what why were they possess in other ages amen they did what God wanted to do now are we doing what God wants us to do amen and it's not just say I believed No and stay in the wilderness no no God with the message with the revelation comes the responsibility to act on it and get out I think I act are they possessed well what are we looking for we're looking for a new glory play body and we're looking for a resurrection we're looking for a rapture amen amen so the grace of God be with us in this era door brother we're seeing it we really look listen there's not that surely we see and especially brother God is going to let us stay the public God say what for because we're going to be tried amen as Jesus right we're going to try a man and brother oh my I pray Lord that we're not taking these things for granted and we're not thinking these things lately concerning what's going on in Australia concern either that plane crashed and concerning the other things are going on in the world and the crown around the world ain't bad no brother don't take it lightly it is the sign of the end of all things it is the saying that of the treatment of God coming down on the earth it's a sign of the fire of God falling on the earth amen brother it shows what it shows it truly it been the case that Satan is the god of this world and brother we want to get out of here amen wait because we got a revelation of the promise where gossiped is going to create a new heaven and a new earth for we don't want to stay in this one we want to get out of here what in the world would you want to stay here for what do you want to stay here another day for it but I'll tell you this there are many many many believers that are so caught up with everyday living and so cut out where there were the natural things of late that it did that the spiritual doesn't have preeminence there are more prisoners to the natural things of life than they are to the spiritual and that is the absolute truth and oh my my mind let go let God have his wings not what you want to do what does God want you to do because he is getting us ready to get out of here he's getting all my the resurrections right there the rapture is right here hey man what do you mean what is it it's right here in the revealed Word it's right here in the message of the hour Amen so we are we are entering into the reality direction the reality of the rapture I tell you this if Luther had anything and he had a rap salute tremendous reality of justification you couldn't convince Luther that he wasn't justified no know whence God quicken it and to him and reveal it to him in his heart there's no way no way he was justified and he went and he praised the Lord hallelujah hey man amen he wasn't justified by his works he's justified by his faith amen same way Wesley no wonder Wesley went out and preached five times a day oh yeah he'd get up in the morning go pray and pray for a couple of hours that he go and he gotta go preach they go a priest and they go preach and I gotta say they would go to the mines and your preach to those that came out they preach to those that were going in amen and then he went in priests again my brother what an anointing what a revival and brother day if the anointing and the revival do that to him and did did what it did to the Pentecostals because I was part of that over fifty years ago eight million and I knew what it was right it's certainly not like it now a man because after they this last week when we come in contact with with a couple of Pentecostal brethren and it's amazing and they're not just you know nobody there they're in there in tremendous positions you mean what they're doing and so on and like I say we went into the into Costco and and all of a sudden I went over and found sister Baden she was talking to this brother and at first I thought I thought he might have been this he might have been bad but I discovered oh he's the Pentecostal brother and our conversation went to the word a man but again you get the you get the justification or even from here that Pentecost is not what it was no no everything is changing he recognized that that we're living in a changing world and everything else was changing a man and again is just later on we met another individual a man not not in what I wasn't it was in paradise we met him and yeah anyway and we discovered Oh your Pentecost oh yes penny Kahn was surprised but again all of our conversations ended up on the word a man and not the word of yesterday but the word of today anybody well recognizing that it's not like it used to be and brother have there seen that I must have all right way to say it by the grace of Almighty God hey man sir brother God is requiring the both of us amen so it's a Pentecost I cannot be in the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit and they were prophesy and they were speaking in times they were doing this and doing that amen but of course it's all gone now that anointing is not there like it used to be and again when we come to the word and the message of the hour there was praise there was worship hallelujah thank you lord thank you thank you thank you for the message thank you for bringing us out of denominationalism a million and above the public God referred to it as Egyptian denominationalism amen there was any in Egypt so we were also in a spiritual Egypt in nomination ilysm amen so he brought us out so we are not controlled by a church were controlled by God we're controlled by Jesus amen brother Han but now what about going in for brother thank God for all of that what he's done down here but I'll tell you what are this is all tremendous thank God for the revelation but now brother you know what that points us to point us to what God is looking for in you and me our responsibility any man and brother is not looking back and see what God did here there there are some routes down through the ages we believe it we say God for but Lord let me go let me go let go and let God have his way to do what you want to do now amen so I get caught up with that revelation okay and I just caught up with uncaught into it and he said me amen I mean it and as the probably Gaza you can be in the message with the message not in you and he was brother brown was seeing that as he come near the end of his ministry there's a lot in this message but I tell you there's not many got the jinda know if the measures in there the message controls them if the messages in there they are prisoners to the word hey man if the message in there they are prisoners to the word prisoners are the message of the error their lives are going to be governed by the word the lives are controlled by the message amen you're going to go there and live as believers you're going to live as sons and daughters of God they're going to go there and live as Jesus a man and you're not caught up with this old war you caught up with the spiritual under fighting brother Jesus or mine there are many things they said they didn't understand many things that he did they didn't understand why is he acting like this why is he doing this ain't man he was moving on to the fulfillment of the word for his day how do you a man brother and another moved on Wednesday and the Pentecost has moved on for their day amen but but then all of a sudden the Spirit begins to leave he wasn't doing that no more why because all all the all that he had prophesied and and to do in that hour it was done that's right Pentecostal revival they say was the most tremendous revival because it went around the world because this revival just went here that Ray Bobby just went there and so on but then God brought down to Pentecost revived that went around the world a man the power the anointing of the Holy Ghost and baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit and brother what about then the crowning of the Pentecostal message as I said the probably garden in 1965 did say my ministry is the crowning of the vet acosta amen because why because there were those they're going on now men are going on there were those that were that believe that the Pentecostal message was going to go on to the resurrection of rapture and it did but they didn't believe it when God said the messenger to give them the message that would give them the revelation they needed for the resurrection and rapture David turned it down amen because amen to enter any become one with it they would had to line up with the word loyola the will of God brother they would come to that place that Jesus came to not my will time be done amen so have we come to that place after 40 years were for the Saints fair and of course less for the younger ones area trying to serve God in the revealed Word old brothers sister are we prisoners to the message hey man and we come to that place that Jesus came to and is it just absolute truth can you really say that I've come to that place brother where Jesus came to not my will anymore your will be done anybody what do you mean not my wheels I wheel well well Lord for what purpose am I here for what purpose had you brought me to this word to this message Lord whatever the purpose of my life let it be done and the purpose of his life was to die the prayers of his life was to lay it down and pick it up again amen but been pick it up he had to suffer he was going to suffer this he knew more than what we knew really what he was going to suffer either he saw what lay ahead he knew more than what the disciples knew oh yeah then cuz even Peter wanted to stop it and again let's say thank the Lord you know that God to chose Peter amazing we wouldn't do it I'll tell you this I I got I got no ton of sermon back there somewhere and I said who would you choose to be your pastor and I said oh no they wouldn't choose that one or he preached too long he had too much to say or they wouldn't choose Peter no not by any means cuz he was this said he had this had this so on oh yeah oh there was a diet I had a whole big list of all those in the Bible of why they wouldn't have that one to be a pastor as they certainly wouldn't have Jeremiah no way no not by any means brother God have mercy on us amen so brother we want the Holy Ghost to be our pastor amen because as God is working in the church for the perfecting of the Saints brother oh my lord come on judge yourself by word of God is God making it flesh in you really Pentecost Milton lived it and they lived their message they lived the revelation they talked he did they spoke in tongues he they spoke about the gifts of the Spirit and when they did this they did that oh praise God hallelujah amen amen yeah yeah that reflected in their lives every day oh yeah we knew who saw someone going up the street maybe older Pentecostal oh yeah and we met so many to talk to or your petty cost oh yeah it was in them it weighs just controlled their thoughts their motives their objectives everything so are you under his control are you as prisoner now so you're going to not mind will Lord I'm going to do your will amen and I tell you the will of God now I tell you is going to be contrary to that to your own will well it's good I want you to do hey where does God want you to do it how does God want you to do it amen well he got a challenging every one of us now as believers the true believers what for he wants to hear what Jesus said not my will time be done amen because it's going from your natural life to a spiritual revelation Amen so that God controls you amen the revelation concerning the resurrection rapture controls us we are prisoners to the revelation of the resurrection we are closer to the revelation of the rapture yeah as I said blue there was a prisoner to that justification the Pentecostals were prisoners to what God was doing in there and through their not now but they were now the bride is a prisoner to the revelation of what God is doing always is what God is doing not what he will do and there's too many so-called believers are thinking the rapture is what God is going to do no he's doing it he's bailing oh no God God's gonna you know one of Jeff or we get to the resurrection for we getting the rapture you know we're going to have a wonderful time we already had it it's coming out now the challenge is going in amen amen oh we came out it was wonderful yes back there her mother or fifty years ago we came out of denominationalism and into the word into the measure they are aloha praise the Lord hallelujah hey man you know as I said Oh way everybody was in the church shouting and praising the Lord and then I remember brother bill like it's like I said brother Billy it's father and gone on many years now because even brother bill has gone on but I remember sitting in the church in Mishra Falls and we're having communion watching and our brother be like his father was there with his with his socks in his aim and he was shaking his socks and he was going around the altar and he was praising the Lord amen because God had brought us out but brother now we're here for God to take us him but there's a generation that came out there's a generation that goes in a man and I said the prophet of God again in one of these measures he said he said I know it's not striking the way it should because it wasn't the time and he says Easter's not striking me the way it should he said not seen it the way I should a man well what is the way we should see it to give us resurrection in rapture in pay hey man there's a coming out but there's a going in brother grace of God we were prisoners to the word there brought us out now let us be prisoners to the words of taken as he a man will continue under his leadership and under his control by the grace of God and he said really me to say it again he said the son of man was actually revealed potentially just for a few moments there and just before Sodom was burned and as it was in the days of Noah a man whether we go on back to well what happened oh no one no it didn't type you and me know what types those they go to the tribulation the Great Tribulation well who types you and me Enoch Amen piadina walk with God so are you walking with God yeah are you walking with God amen so that God's in control you're following God's leadership amen this is a tremendous challenge brother to our faith we started this way and he ain't coming out but now do we as our fate continuing to take us in amen is our faith maturity is a faith growing by the grace of God taking us in brother most are still caught up with this old world the natural things of life not the spiritual what are you living for well I'm them for this I got to do this I gotta do that and waiting been administered your spiritual revelation should control the law that comes first amen by the grace of God and he says the son of man was revealed potentially just for a few moments there just before Sodom was burned the Son of man was there revealed himself to move to Moses yeah god help us now he said that man was Elohim that was God and Jesus is God and God has revealed potentially right there for a few moments he said to talk to Abraham not Moses Abraham in the investigation judgment and he said the son of man was revealed Elohim and he said the son of man le he was really was revealed just a few minutes for the very next morning she was burned and he said before the Sun could come up again so there can't be no organization left neither can there be any further advancement than was going right now for shield burn before the day breaks the game brother get ready it's going to get worse and worse and worse so bad that all yell that the whole world is surrender to the Antichrist oh yeah it's gonna get so bad so desperate they feel anyone that steps up like that oh yeah we'll we'll give them the control yes we need it we need it why because they're so fearful what's going on and what is happening around in Australia it's amazing and again what's happening in that plane crash just thing it wasn't just an ordinary plane crash they were blown out a missile struck that plane for so many to die that as they did they had to be something strike it not just a plane crashing down yeah why because the only way they're going to identify their dead is DNA testing oh yeah because everything everything was so demolished God had mercy my heart goes out to the families yes but I pray that their hearts will go to the Lord amen as I'm serious it was they were blown out of the air so brother sister you don't know what's going to happen you just trusting the Lord when you take an airplane flight you're just trusting God amen by the grace of God amen and he said listen neither can there be any further advancement of what's going on right now and she'll burn before the day breaks again the revival is over across the nation he said there ain't going to be no more revivals he said big sweeping revival this nation he said will never receive it he said you might have intellectual gathering but he said not as I mean a spiritual revival and he said we've seen all of it and I hope you're catching I'm saving it in such a way that I hope you get it he said it's over this is serious grace brother you got hope you got an encouragement you got piece you got rest I trust us in the revelation of the resurrection because that's our only hope the resurrection and the rapture oh it's Jesus what he is he said I am the resurrection amen you want to get into Jesus get into the resurrection if you're in Christ you're in the resurrection you're English you're in the rapture hallelujah because the reservoir the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air just think that's what we are looking for the reality of in flesh glorified flesh glorified bodies he may praise the Lord remember as one brother was challenging me one time but starting the kind of bodies were going into he was at you as a pastor and he believed were going in two bodies you know like this body right here but to be young young no I said not exactly I said here this body is the life of this bodies in the blood of it but ice when we get the glory I said the life of that body is is the word amen oh no we said we're going to go into with a flesh and blood no I said brother I said when Jesus rose from the dead he went to the disciples he didn't say don't look at me he said for flesh and blood as no don't don't have this no he's a flesh and bone I see never said blood I said he shed the blood for you and me and I said he sent the life of the blood back to you and me hey man so our brother I said were going into a body like his glorious body flesh and bone but not blood no but by any means any man because his life the life the Spirit of God will be the life of that body amen listen we come from eternity we're going back to eternity how many really believe that he's not here to save the devil's children he's here to say this and he knows who they are that's why Jesus said all the father's giving me will come to me and I will lose none yeah thank God for that part for that promise amen brother we believe that God gave us to Jesus that's why we're here that's why we're believing what we're baby that's why we're standing the way we stand and taking our stand for what we take amen well cause look we're reflecting jesus essa' jesus acted that's how Jesus reacted so Jesus talked yeah and so Jesus responded and you're doing the same thing that was Jesus 2,000 years ago now is Jesus in the bright God Elvis amen he said that I he said they're even spiritually valuable and so on and he should have Minister said to me a while ago brother Benham if I could just have the joy of the Lord in my heart and I said son the revival is over now he said the stabilisers had been put on the ship great fearful waves out here he said before us but we know just beyond that way be under we are nearing the shore and he said just stay stable Amen because I tell you the anointing is not in the world like it used to be and that's what that brother was sensing the Spirit of God was was pulling away and why it's because there there was fewer and fewer and fewer that wanted him fewer fewer they had the anointing yeah and that's why you you felt that loneliness and if the believer is anything is lonely for God not only for Jesus lonely for the for the blessing lonely for more of the anointing not just kidding say well I believe the masses praise the Lord look what he did look what he did yeah what I'm going to say praise the Lord look what he done look what he's doing you got to get into the present tense revelation but too many are I meant too many messy churches they're just caught up with past tense revelation past tense what God has done how many are caught up with what God is doing how many got the anointing of the rapture in their hearts do you not need the resurrection in their souls that's Christ in you and you go forth again how many believers do you meet that that are more like Jesus put more emphasis on the word more instance on the spiritual part of your life how many is it you can I say that your Jesus oh yeah can I say oh yes Christ in that brother Christ in that sister my look at their lives look at their spirits look at their I had a seat you know does not their mom and dad or their grandma or grandpa that's Jesus hey man sister that's Jesus in that brother who's Jesus in that sister Oh Mon they're certainly not like mom and dad they were one time but when they're born again oh you're like you're you're like your heavenly mother and father a man praise the name of the Lord I don't know you it's just like God you know anyone that when Jesus was with the disciples and so on and and they come to him and said oh Jesus your mother and bring your brothers want to see you you see what your mother and your brothers he said who is my mother you learned my brother and he turned to those that were hearing the word he said this is my mother and my brothers hey man who is your issue really or your mother and your father and your brothers and sisters oh there's someone throw stones no no natural no no no if you're born again your emphasis is not under natural your emphasis is more and more on the spiritual a man and you're so caught up with your spiritual family and that that it will bring your it will cause your your natural family to be jealous oh yeah I think you're insane yeah they're jealous because why well you just say hello to us anybody you're just doing this you do that and then you gone on down there you're going on down there too to stay with them why because they're my brothers and sisters in Christ and we are bound eternally we have a greater and a greater and a greater union than the natural by the grace of Almighty God amen what brother that proves that you're a prisoner you're not a prisoner to the natural things you're a prisoner to the spiritual as Paul was a prisoner to the spiritual revelation of Jesus not the natural revelation of Jesus spiritual revelation of Jesus a man a world I pray God make us more and more prisoners to this message to the revealed word more more pleasures to what God is doing not what he's done there are those who are prisoners to what then but there's a few this prisoner to what he's doing and the father God warned us there's gonna be very very few living Saints go in the rapture if they're not being caught up now with the revealed word cut up morning noon and night a man controlled by it there you're just living different than anybody else if you're not caught up that way then you're not going to get caught up in the change of the body but if you're caught up spiritually and all your thoughts are spiritual your motives are spiritual your actions and reactions are spiritual oh my all I want to do is Lord I want you to be in it I want your leadership a man I want your blessings Lord a man like I said even when I worked out there in the in in in the world and worked at this work that I did it with the Lord so yes like I said there were times when when I worked there and they were doing issues came up and I would say Lord I need your help please Lord I need your leadership I need your strength and I need your wisdom amen yeah and it's like like I said when a personal the number of people that sort of complimented me you know they said mr. loss for Geraldo do this this I said well I said that's the Lord I wanted to give the glory to him that's the Lord amen that's giving me that wisdom it's the Lord that's helping me a man and like I said one time when they were when they were looking for certain things before before they would open the store at the time there was a large department store and and they wanted they couldn't find it and they thought I wasn't looking for it mr. Jarrell what are you doing well I said I'm waiting on the Lord I said we'll find it I said we'll get it oh that's talking they went on and so I found it yeah the Lord led me to it after I witnessed give the glory to Jesus brother is exactly again as our brother Joseph did in his interview some years ago concerning his work amen that he wouldn't do taking this advertisement that every time this and something else no because of his Christian faith I want to testimony to the world hey man that's right I got a raise that up and he's gonna judge many by it oh he will so brothers sister I pray God's grace that brother that got to be able to take your life and judge the world by it take your attitude and your spirit your anointing judge the world by him and say listen this was it right here I was in fleshing this but this gentleman I was in fleshing that brother this sister right there that's my son and daughter Grace so are you a prisoner to the revealed word stay humble stay in the word stay with God and no matter how you feel what anything else stay rutted the word he said let it be let it stay stable you keep your balance in the word it is God in you yes if it's God in you is God hidden and revealed in simplicity but it's gonna be the simple gospel life the several Holy Ghost life as it was in Jesus so it seen you along with the power in the anointing that he had he could have had a greater and greater and a greater ministry in the eyes of man all he had to do was go do this go do that go to this and just not not not to take the stand for this not to say this not to say that but Jesus took his stand for the word anybody oh he did this he did that he knew how to do this he knew how to do that he could do practically anything he is this there's a song I have constantly playing over my computer there he says he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free but he died for you and and that's the truth oh well they crucify him yeah but he that was according to the predestinated plan God that was the predestinated will of God what for because the yet to redeem us back or for by sinless blood we were born in sin he was born without seen and so he laid down he's gonna lay down his life to redeem us back the letter yes said the man not in the other the thundered over the balusters the sons and daughters of God a man you're redeemed which was a blood of Christ a session how many how many have taken it really serious concerning what Jesus has done brother as I said a lot of those paintings are not right because even though even in Gethsemane he said as it were great drops of blood yeah when I come when it comes to his sweat sweat that's a great word great drops of blood oh yeah that's a you type of stress and the pressure for the whole world including you and me look what he's suffered for you and me Oh what he just did that because of sin in the beginning no he did it to redeem us back probably God said he could have waked the whole thing off and started again but he wanted to reveal himself to his sons and daughters and further I trust that we're seeing the revelation of God loved him with all your heart why because of what he did and even some of the pictures of him on the cross some that's not right I say he said I said he he was covered with blood but on the cross there's only a little bit of blood here a little bit of blood there yeah no in reality he lit out all of his blood went down to the earth amen to thank her do you have the evidence that you were born again evidence that you're redeemed if you do it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul I'm on the son and daughter of God I got the life of God I got the Spirit of God in me you got the life and Spirit of God in you and it controls you you become a prisoner to the word and what brings us into the prison of the reveal word the baptism of the holy ghost walk in the light as he is in the light amen a fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin see he didn't didn't start with the blood he started with the life in the light he said we walk in the light as he is in the light oh we got fellowship with one another as brothers and sisters in Christ we are oh we're a family yeah he said the fellowship over there and now all you're in that body in that body you're redeemed in the body of Christ amen just a blood of and use your and the blood of Christ cleanses us from all on righteousness all past present future amen so brother again are you a prisoner to the word grace stay stable yes and he said when you see all these great big clouds around us and storms coming atomic bombs everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word when we see brother what's going on again in Australia and what did that plane crash again like we said the grace of God to family but again it's gonna get worse I can tell you right now be on your guard the world is going to get worse and worse and worse but but the public God did say you're staying and you're experiencing these things because God wants to manifest your faith wants to try you and it'll it'll bring out your nature or if there's anything that's being manifested now it's the nature of believers why are they focusing on natural spiritual and too many are caught up with the natural and not with the spiritual and again let me says read read it again you see all these great big clouds around us storms are coming atomic bombs and everything else talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word God said it would be here and will crest every one of them and we'll go straight over the top of them waves and he said they can't sink us they can't drown us he said you put us in the grave and we'll come out again it is the grace of God amen why because we're in the evening light of the revealed Word by the grace of God amen so brother are we just agreeing intellectually with the word or are we applying it to our lives confirming the revelation is the word made flesh in us amen the message not this it's you yeah hey man okay God takes it out of this oh yeah it goes from this well just brings us here and when you come here it it comes in us Christ in us the hope of glory amen by the grace of Almighty God so lord help us to be any brother if we're really prisoner yeah we're brought we're brought from this into this and this into into our hearts and souls not intellectually not the letter of the word but the spirit of the word by the grace of God amen brother the revival Oh certain things I can't say but I trust were a confirmation of the bright revival what what part of that revival are you reflecting to your family friends and neighbors or just this doctrine that doctrine and all we believe William Branham in our heads no more to it than that it goes beyond that brother when it comes to the they were first of all reflecting modes but they certainly wouldn't have nothing to do with a reflect just one Caleb and their faith so God took Moses off the scene so now Moses was gone now they were faced and challenged to believe what Joshua and Caleb were saying but what were you going to do pick up stones and stone them that's right and in any true servant of God today the ldls try to stone oh yeah stoner with this don't so with that stone rather stay with the word thank God for the word thank God for a ministry there or here or somewhere else over there thank God for that brother that's going to stay with the word and encourage the people to stay with the word God let me I'll have to finish with this there's another scripture but we will leave it to Wednesday the Lord willing I've shared it with you before share with you again Oh God make us prisoners you want to be a prisoner uh-huh oh I was I was a prisoner in denomination feel like God set me free no he took you out of that and brought you into the word and you become a prisoner to the word oh yeah probably God highlights that in in the message Paul a prisoner why he said Paul he see was beginning to see himself not just as a prisoner in that natural prison but a prisoner to the word spiritually God have mercy God make us prisoners you want to become a prisoner well I'm already prisoner good amen if you're a prisoner you're gonna follow the the leadership of the one to whom you're a prisoner and he said from our own selfish ambitions yeah dude most of the world and most of believers are caught up with selfish ambitions they want to do this they want to do that not what you want to do was God want you to do as I said people are not living for God like they used to they're really not living for the message like they used to intellectually but not spiritually he said Lord prisoners from our own selfish ambitions from our own judgments and our better way of thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and I think that was a great statement that Paul made that I I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen I pray God's grace that we are prisoners to Christ amen considering what we're seeing in the world today and were and we know the world's getting worse and worse and worse and knowing that the public god said many many years ago grace he said a certain country concerning America he said that country he said they got a they got a bomb or something like that he said with our name on it we're gonna get ready to shoot it to America and destroy America brother we're not going to escape it no definitely not we're right there north of America so we're part of America too so it's going to destroy an umbrella I tell you this o the world that influenced that plane crashed the world that's influencing that that's influenced by the the fire in Australia and other things going on in the world brother get ready because as I said I told you before that all of this going on this going on I said one day yes it's gonna be on our doorstep and it is it's getting closer and closer to our doorstep we better be a prisoner Jesus so when all these things pass and come to pass again and again and again there were gonna be set free into eternity by the grace of God again there are very few believers that are prisoners to the word prisoners to the message prisoners to the revelation of sanctification and the if you're a prisoner to that revelation you're living for a day in day out morning noon and night you're looking for the resurrection in the rapture how many times have I look Gon's and looked out the window and what the Lord what's it going to be like Lord the new heaven new earth there be none of this said Lord all this would be gone thank you Lord it's gonna be wonderful thank you Jesus know what I'm looking for it I'm calling for it Lord then new heaven and new earth brother the resurrection of rapture is going to take us into glory for a season for a time before God makes the new heaven a new earth grace as talking to those breath brethren a couple of those brothers one of those said they said do you believe in heaven yes I said I believe in him that's right it's a place that God's gonna take us well he's well he's destroyed the earth while he's bringing this to pass and that to pass he's gonna take us off but then he'll bring us back when it's all redone and it's a new heaven a new earth as a part of Gaza do throw into the Sun so that it's burned and yesterday won't be one thing left representing seen No thank God we're going into a new avenue where where we won't have nothing in our bodies representing sin we hope there be no thoughts we want when I have no thoughts have seen will be back home by the grace of God hallelujah but again I says I said and you're gonna have something to do and if God can trust you here your trust you there amen God has given you a responsibility here to see if you you can you can handle that responsibility as a son and daughter of God he's bringing out the nature of his of his sons and daughters his nature in you amen oh you're faithful here in your distance oh I can I can make you a ruler there you me and my throne praise the Lord listen just to ask you to continue to remember those associated or affected by the Australia fires they're believers in Australia grace of God - and again those affected by the plane crash and other things that are going on in the earth there's a lot more going on than what we realized so the grace of God helped us and also to ask you to remember our brother George Smith in prayer he's in Brazil I was in contact with him by email I think that either last night or night before and he was on his way on a nine-hour trip he saw him on a nine hour trip brothers head to Brazil and I told what was like here wasted thank you glad I'm not there and I knew that's why he wouldn't want to come here during the winter amen especially this winter so I'll be in contact with him to set a time for his visit with us and also I'm waiting to hear from our brother Andre ahead and there's also another brother at being central in late May and hopefully be here in early June and that's a Andrew Glover we
