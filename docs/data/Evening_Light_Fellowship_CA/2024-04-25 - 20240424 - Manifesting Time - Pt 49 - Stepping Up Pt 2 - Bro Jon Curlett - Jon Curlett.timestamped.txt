[36:47] you're in it Lord would you just take
[36:49] control of this building Lord the people

[37:07] your word let us see ourselves in your
[37:09] word Lord and let us step into it
[37:11] tonight by Grace and Faith we ask in
[37:14] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
[37:18] God bless you turn if we would to First
[37:20] John chapter 5 1 John chapter
[37:24] 5 amen a couple missing I know brother
[37:26] Bob and sister Bren have gone to kill
[37:28] Mory for arrest so we trust that God
[37:31] blesses them gives them a break and I
[37:33] forgot but I think brother Joe is also
[37:35] traveling away for business or something
[37:37] so we trust God's grace to be with him
[37:40] amen sure enjoyed that song service
[37:42] brother Josh it was just
[37:44] perfect as I said just trusting that the
[37:46] Lord is leading us this evening amen 1
[37:50] John 5 verse 14 says this it says and
[37:53] this is the confidence that we have in
[37:55] him that if we ask anything according to
[37:58] his will he heareth us and if we know
[38:02] that he hear us whatsoever we ask we
[38:05] know that we have the petitions that we
[38:07] desired of him amen God bless you you
[38:10] can have your seats we're continuing
[38:12] again in our series on manifesting time
[38:14] I want to take a second service on this
[38:16] thought of stepping up and we ended last
[38:18] service with a quote where brother br's
[38:20] talking about how we can be so yielded
[38:23] to the holy spirit that God would
[38:24] identify himself with that person and I
[38:26] want to start there just so we can pick
[38:28] up and roll right into the the next
[38:30] portion of this this series tonight
[38:32] brother brah says he's speaking of
[38:34] Christ and he's saying just think that a
[38:36] person so yielded until God identified
[38:39] himself in there in that body and him
[38:42] and God became one Jesus said I am my
[38:46] father are one my father dwelleth in me
[38:48] I do that always which pleases the
[38:50] father he says what if the Christian
[38:52] today could have a testimony like that
[38:55] you would be a masterpiece right here on
[38:57] on the street then he says these simple
[38:59] words he says if you're a washwoman out
[39:01] there behind the washtub you still be a
[39:04] masterpiece to God when you can say I do
[39:07] that always which pleases God he says
[39:11] and the whole world can see the work of
[39:13] Jesus Christ reflecting in you and I
[39:16] love this because so often when we
[39:17] preach we focus on the brothers they're
[39:19] the heads of the homes they're the
[39:20] leaders in the church they're the ones
[39:22] that God has ordained in the five-fold
[39:24] ministry and these things but we're
[39:26] going to dwell on the sisters tonight
[39:27] tonight amen so brothers let's hold in
[39:29] there let's let's let's pray and let's
[39:31] let's enter in and work with our sisters
[39:34] here but as I said the brothers so often
[39:36] get the focal point but you'll see here
[39:38] that the sisters have a great part to
[39:40] play amen and I I know I was talking to
[39:42] a brother not too long ago and he said
[39:44] some of the most powerful people I know
[39:46] in the bride of Christ are women they're
[39:49] just not publicly known by these things
[39:51] but he said the manifestation of the
[39:53] spirit the the gifts that God has placed
[39:55] in the body he says many of them are in
[39:56] women and it's faithful women that are
[39:59] just sitting under proper headship amen
[40:02] and they find their place in these
[40:03] things and we opened up with this
[40:05] scripture in 1 John chapter 5 and there
[40:07] John says if we ask anything according
[40:09] to God's will he hears us the key will
[40:13] see when it comes to adoption is that we
[40:15] are in his will we're not just in the
[40:17] position that he's placed Us in but
[40:19] within that position we're there because
[40:21] we can find the will of God and we're
[40:23] not going to focus on that that's going
[40:24] to be a focus for another service in the
[40:26] future Lord willing about how do we find
[40:28] the will of God but I want you to see
[40:30] that when you seek God's will and you
[40:33] find it then you can ask with confidence
[40:35] because when you found his will now his
[40:37] word is behind it his power is behind it
[40:40] his authority is behind it his promise
[40:42] is fully behind it because when you seek
[40:44] his will it's not just the object or
[40:46] it's not just the action but it's the
[40:48] timing it's the motive it's the
[40:49] objective it's all these things that
[40:51] need to feed in and when we can find
[40:53] ourselves in that place then God will
[40:55] answer our prayers because we've stepped
[40:56] into his perfect will so I want to say
[40:59] tonight we're not going to talk about
[41:00] finding his will but I want to say Seek
[41:02] the will of God above all else seek the
[41:04] will of God and say Lord what would you
[41:06] have to me to do where would you have me
[41:08] to be how would you want me to act in
[41:10] this situation and when we do that then
[41:12] our every need is supplied amen God's
[41:14] behind us and everything but I want us
[41:16] to start tonight on an example here
[41:18] because when we come into adoption we
[41:20] believe that the promises of God are
[41:22] their Force we believe that the
[41:23] blessings of the Kingdom of Heaven are
[41:25] their Force we're stepping into full
[41:27] Authority with God's word behind us and
[41:29] so many times that means we've got to
[41:31] take the word as his word anden we've
[41:33] got to take it personally we've got to
[41:35] step into the promises we've got to step
[41:37] into what God has told us to do and
[41:39] we've got to believe it's for us amen
[41:41] we've got to believe that it's mine it's
[41:42] not just yours but it's mine amen and so
[41:45] if we're children of God and we're
[41:46] living under the word of God that means
[41:48] we ought to be able to claim the
[41:50] promises of the word for us but how we
[41:52] claim things is often what's tied to our
[41:54] real maturity and we're speaking about
[41:56] stepping up we're talking about coming
[41:58] into a place of adoption of thinking and
[42:00] acting the way that adopted Sons and
[42:02] Daughters do so I want to start with a
[42:04] with a promise here and then we're going
[42:06] to go into an example of somebody
[42:07] finding their place in that promise and
[42:10] in Deuteronomy 7 it says this and this
[42:12] is Mos is speaking he says know
[42:14] therefore that the Lord thy God he is
[42:18] God that alone ought to make us stop
[42:20] sometimes and say let's let him be God
[42:23] Amen let's not step on his toes he says
[42:25] he is God he's the faith God which
[42:28] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them
[42:30] that love him and keep his Commandments
[42:33] to a thousand Generations you love him
[42:36] and you do what his word says He says
[42:37] he'll keep his commandment no matter
[42:39] what his Covenant with you in verse 11
[42:41] he says Thou shalt therefore keep the
[42:43] Commandments and the statutes and the
[42:45] judgments which I command thee this day
[42:47] to do them wherefore it shall come to
[42:50] pass if ye hearken to these judgments
[42:52] and keep and do them that the Lord thy
[42:55] God shall keep unto thee the Covenant
[42:57] and the mercy which he swear unto thy
[42:59] fathers he says he'll do everything he's
[43:01] done for those in the past if you'll do
[43:02] what those in the past did God never
[43:04] changes if you step into your his word
[43:07] the way others have he'll do for you
[43:08] what he's done for others we we sing
[43:10] that song it is no secret what God can
[43:12] do what he's done for others he'll do
[43:14] for you but you've got to meet him where
[43:16] they met him amen and that's under the
[43:18] the presence of his word but I want you
[43:21] to catch this now in verse 13 He says
[43:23] and he will love thee and he will bless
[43:26] thee and he he will multiply thee he
[43:28] will also bless the fruit of thy womb
[43:31] and the fruit of thy land thy corn and
[43:33] thy wine and thine oil the increase of
[43:36] thy kind that's your
[43:38] cattle he says in the flocks of thy
[43:40] sheep in the lamb which he swear under
[43:42] thy fathers to give thee God says I'll
[43:44] bless everything you touch and
[43:47] everything you have if you'll just stay
[43:48] with my word amen what a wonderful place
[43:51] if we can find ourselves there today if
[43:53] that's what he would offer under the law
[43:55] how much more would he offer it under
[43:56] grace
[43:58] but I want you to catch this verse 14 it
[43:59] says Thou shalt be blessed above all
[44:02] people and there shall not be that means
[44:07] in no circumstances will anyone male or
[44:11] female be Barren among you or among your
[44:13] cattle God promised the children of
[44:15] Israel Israel if you'll stay with my
[44:17] word if you'll stay with my Commandments
[44:19] if you'll keep the ordinances that I've
[44:21] told you to keep he says I'll bless
[44:23] everything including I'll give you
[44:25] children
[44:27] that was a great sign of wealth amongst
[44:29] the children of Israel was that he would
[44:31] bless them and multiply them because
[44:32] remember the the promise that he gave
[44:35] Abraham was that he would multiply him
[44:36] greatly and so when they had children it
[44:38] was the literal fulfillment of what God
[44:40] had promised to do in Abraham it was the
[44:42] great Covenant that Abraham had told
[44:44] them to do and it was a part of their
[44:46] blessing anden now I want us to see
[44:49] because if we're in our position in
[44:50] Christ then every promise in the book
[44:52] belongs to us can we say Amen that to
[44:54] that this evening if I'm in my place
[44:56] then every promise will be will it won't
[44:58] be held back for me but I want us to see
[45:00] something amen we're going to see what
[45:02] happens and come up a little higher when
[45:04] it comes to the promises of God and and
[45:06] maybe step up in our understanding and
[45:08] maturity tonight we're going to go to a
[45:10] very familiar story here and it's the
[45:12] story of Hannah now we've just read in
[45:14] Deuteronomy 7:14 where he says there
[45:16] won't be a single one that's Barren
[45:18] amongst you now is that the promise of
[45:21] God or is it not it's his promise right
[45:24] nobody is going to be Barren then we go
[45:26] to 1st Samuel 1:1 it says there was a
[45:29] certain
[45:30] man of ramth Zim of Mount Ephraim and
[45:34] his name was Ela the son of jeroham the
[45:36] son of elu the son of toou the son of
[45:38] zof an
[45:40] ephrathite that's a
[45:42] mouthful he says and he had two wives
[45:45] and the name of one was Hannah and the
[45:47] name of the other was panina and panina
[45:50] had children but Hannah had no children
[45:54] now in the in the in the Old Testament
[45:56] times being childless was considered a
[45:58] reflection of a woman's spirituality and
[46:01] if she did not have children it meant
[46:03] that God had forsaken her because she
[46:06] was disobedient or had a secret sin
[46:08] somewhere why because God had promised
[46:10] that you're going to have children and
[46:12] now here we see a woman that has no
[46:16] children and the other wife has children
[46:19] and now people are looking down on
[46:21] Hannah Hannah doesn't have the promise
[46:24] Hannah is not blessed of God Hannah must
[46:26] be be doing something wrong I wonder
[46:29] what's going on in Hannah's life she
[46:30] always seems so good why is God not
[46:33] blessing
[46:34] her how often must she have asked God to
[46:37] give her a child to take away her
[46:40] reproach she's sitting now under the
[46:42] reproach of not having the word in her
[46:44] life God promised it and she doesn't
[46:47] have it God promised it she doesn't have
[46:49] it and no matter how much she asked no
[46:51] matter how much she goes to God
[46:52] nothing's
[46:53] happening Hannah is living under the
[46:56] reproach of living under the promises of
[46:58] the
[46:59] word she has nothing of what God
[47:02] promised from Deuteronomy 7:14 it's not
[47:05] in her life verse three says and this
[47:08] man went up out of his City yearly to
[47:10] worship and to sacrific unto the Lord of
[47:13] host in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli
[47:15] hne and Phineas the priests of the Lord
[47:18] were there and when the time was that
[47:20] elaa offered he gave to panina his wife
[47:23] and to all her sons and her daughters
[47:25] portions
[47:26] so ELCA when he goes there he gives them
[47:29] a portion of the offering he says but
[47:32] unto unto Hannah he gave a worthy
[47:35] portion that word worthy means double he
[47:38] gave her double what he gave anybody
[47:40] else he tried to make up for her
[47:42] situation by favoring her he tried to
[47:45] make her feel good about not having the
[47:47] word promise it says for he loved Hannah
[47:51] but catch this now it
[47:54] says the Lord had had shut up her womb
[47:59] God has
[48:02] promised you won't be
[48:04] Barren and then God make her
[48:08] Barren how does this
[48:10] work how does this work how is this fair
[48:14] church we're stepping up tonight a
[48:15] little bit God says I'm going to give it
[48:18] to you and then god holds her back there
[48:20] is nothing wrong with Hannah's body
[48:23] nothing wrong with Hannah's body but God
[48:26] has held back children from Hannah God's
[48:30] putting her through disappointment God's
[48:31] putting her through scorn he's putting
[48:33] her through persecution he's bringing
[48:35] her down in the eyes of the people that
[48:37] are around her he's making her life
[48:40] miserable
[48:42] amen Church where do our minds go in
[48:45] tough
[48:46] situations so often we go immediately to
[48:49] this is Satan's
[48:50] work and yet the scripture says the Lord
[48:54] had shut up her womb
[48:56] see we've got to be able to check
[48:58] ourselves and sayl where am I is it me
[49:02] Lord cuz if it's not me then we ought to
[49:05] be able to have faith that there's a
[49:06] greater thing going on than just what we
[49:08] think it is amen we're talking about
[49:10] stepping up we're talking about coming
[49:11] up higher and watch what happens in
[49:14] verse six and her adversary this is
[49:17] panina the other wife also provoked her
[49:19] SAR for to make her fret make her worry
[49:24] make her wonder why am I like this why
[49:27] is she blessed and I'm not why does she
[49:28] have the word promise and why don't I
[49:31] that is never the working of the holy
[49:33] spirit is to make you wonder and fret
[49:35] the Holy Spirit brings faith it brings
[49:37] rest it brings trust it brings
[49:39] confidence in the word of God this is
[49:41] not God that's giving her an adversary
[49:43] now this is Satan that's giving her an
[49:45] adversary to try and keep her focused on
[49:48] the situation through the wrong
[49:50] eyes it says because to make her fret
[49:53] because the Lord had shut up her womb in
[49:56] other words the other wife is saying God
[50:00] has cursed you you're out of God's
[50:02] blessing you're out of God's will you're
[50:05] not a real believer you're weak in the
[50:08] faith God hasn't shown you any
[50:11] favor Hannah had to Bear the reproach of
[50:14] not having the word promised in her
[50:16] body verse seven how long does this go
[50:20] on and as he did so year by year church
[50:24] God knows how to work on us God knows
[50:27] how to work on us year after year after
[50:30] year Hannah takes reproach Hannah takes
[50:34] persecution it says when she went up to
[50:37] the house of the Lord so she provoked
[50:39] her therefore she wept and did not eat
[50:41] see that was supposed to be a time of
[50:43] Thanksgiving That was supposed to be a
[50:45] time of Praise a time of appreciation
[50:48] and this woman is rubbing Hannah's face
[50:49] in the fact that she's not blessed she's
[50:52] not blessed in the way that Hannah wants
[50:53] to be blessed above all other ways
[50:56] now watch elaa typical
[50:59] husband then said alaa her husband to
[51:02] her Hannah why weepest thou and why
[51:05] eatest thou
[51:06] not and why is thy heart grieved am not
[51:09] I better to thee than 10 Sons am I not
[51:15] enough
[51:17] Church it ain't always about the
[51:20] spouse it's not always about the
[51:22] situation Hannah had a cry in her heart
[51:26] she had a desire for the word to be
[51:28] produced in her body she had a desire
[51:31] for God to give her the promise that he
[51:34] had made all those years ago and nothing
[51:37] could quench it nothing could quench the
[51:40] cry in her heart everything in her body
[51:43] everything in her mind everything in her
[51:45] spirit was screaming out I need a child
[51:48] I own a child I have a child I there's a
[51:51] promise for me and I'm not going to let
[51:53] go until I get it but it ain't easy
[51:56] because she's never getting the desire
[51:58] of her heart year after year after year
[52:02] years after years year by year the
[52:04] scripture says she goes back and no
[52:07] promise no promise no
[52:10] promise church if God puts it in your
[52:12] heart stay there if he puts it in his
[52:16] word and then he puts his word in your
[52:18] heart stay there and trust that he's
[52:20] going to work it out but will we hold on
[52:23] till we get it will we hold on and say
[52:26] say Lord I trust you and I believe you
[52:28] we're talking about stepping up
[52:31] now now catch this they go and they go
[52:34] year after year after year but
[52:36] eventually there comes a year where
[52:37] God's timing steps into it says in verse
[52:40] 9 so Hannah rose up after they had eaten
[52:43] in Shiloh and after they had drunk now
[52:45] Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the
[52:47] post of the Temple of the Lord and she
[52:50] was in bitterness of soul and prayed
[52:53] unto the Lord and wept so Hanah is not
[52:55] in a great State of Mind here Church
[52:57] she's not feeling it the only thing
[53:00] she's got here is
[53:03] bitterness and she's there and she's
[53:05] crying out to
[53:09] God she's got a word desire she's got a
[53:12] Godly desire and bitterness has crept in
[53:15] because God has not answered her
[53:18] prayers we pray and we pray and we pray
[53:23] and we wait and we wait and we wait
[53:26] and nothing
[53:28] happens and we say God where are
[53:32] you what's going on I'm in my place I'm
[53:36] faithful you know my heart I've sought
[53:38] you there's nothing in my life what's
[53:40] going
[53:41] on but I want you to see even in her
[53:44] pain and bitterness she never stopped
[53:46] seeking God that's one thing you can say
[53:48] about Hannah she never stopped talking
[53:50] to
[53:51] God see so often we want to hold it
[53:55] in listen listen God gave us
[53:58] emotions God gave us feelings he knows
[54:01] how we feel whether we tell him or not
[54:03] he knows what's going on in our mind
[54:05] it's okay to let them know how you're
[54:07] feeling it's not okay to stay there
[54:09] though but it's okay amen let's not
[54:12] seeking him because we're bitter let's
[54:14] not seek him let's not stop seeking him
[54:16] because he hasn't given us the answer
[54:17] we've sought for even if it's his word
[54:20] promised yet let's not stop seeking him
[54:23] amen Even in our disappointment Even in
[54:25] our conf confusion so many times Lord
[54:28] what is it is it something I've done no
[54:30] son no daughter it's okay keep
[54:33] pressing listen in verse 11 she says and
[54:35] she vowed a vow Church God's got a way
[54:39] of bringing us around to exactly where
[54:42] he wants us because remember what
[54:43] adoption is adoption is about your
[54:46] heavenly position and purpose and God's
[54:50] got a work that he's trying to do
[54:51] through each and every one of us and
[54:53] he's got to get us to a place where
[54:55] we'll step into our
[54:57] purpose and once we do that the
[54:59] floodgates of Heaven
[55:01] open says she vowed a vow and she said
[55:04] oh lord of hosts if thou wil indeed look
[55:06] on the Affliction of thine handmade and
[55:09] remember me and not forget thine
[55:11] handmaid but will give unto thine
[55:12] handmade a
[55:14] Manchild not just a child she wants a
[55:17] son she says then will I give him unto
[55:20] the Lord all the days of his life and
[55:23] there shall no razor come upon his hand
[55:25] what did Hannah do do she finally said
[55:27] the right thing Church in her bitterness
[55:30] in her disappointment in her desperation
[55:33] she said Lord I'll give my blessing back
[55:36] to you I want to be a mother and your
[55:39] word promises me children but what I'll
[55:41] do is I'll give you the first fruits the
[55:44] first thing you give me I'll give it
[55:45] back to you for your service if it's a
[55:47] son I want a son I'll give you a son and
[55:50] I'll dedicate him from the day he's born
[55:52] to your service she put him under a
[55:54] Nazarite vow
[55:57] she says I'll take my blessing and I'll
[55:59] give it right back to
[56:02] you verse 12 says and it came to pass as
[56:06] she continued praying before the Lord
[56:08] that Eli marked her mouth he noticed her
[56:10] mouth it says now Hannah she spake in
[56:13] her heart only her lips moved but her
[56:15] voice was not heard she was just
[56:17] mouthing the words therefore Eli thought
[56:20] she had been drunken and Eli said to her
[56:22] how long wil thou be drunken put away
[56:25] thy wine from thee and Han answered and
[56:27] said no my Lord I'm a woman of a
[56:29] sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither
[56:32] wine nor strong drink but I poured out
[56:34] my soul before the
[56:36] Lord don't hold back from pouring out
[56:38] before God how many times do we get in
[56:42] situations and what we do is we
[56:44] spiritualize our holding
[56:46] back half the time all God wants is a
[56:49] honest conversation from your heart
[56:52] that's all he's looking for church is
[56:54] you to say I don't
[56:56] understand I don't know I don't I can't
[56:59] even comprehend what's going on
[57:02] here church I know by experience there's
[57:06] things we pray about and it doesn't
[57:09] happen but we have a word promise we can
[57:13] go chapter and verse and say you said it
[57:16] but we don't have
[57:18] it it's okay to say we don't have it but
[57:22] let's not say I won't ever get it
[57:24] because your word says I'm going to get
[57:26] it so I'm here to remind you of the
[57:28] promise and that I'm here as your son
[57:31] I'm here as your daughter saying this is
[57:32] mine and I'm here to let you know I'm
[57:35] expecting you to back your word up if
[57:37] I'm in your position then I'm expecting
[57:39] you to back this word up
[57:42] amen oh we swallow it so many times let
[57:46] it out pour it out say God I don't
[57:52] understand Lord I'm right where you told
[57:54] me to be I followed you as best I know
[57:58] how what's going on why am I left
[58:01] hanging
[58:04] here let him know you're bitter let him
[58:07] know you're at the end of your rope let
[58:09] him know you got nothing left in the
[58:12] tank that's a great place to let him be
[58:15] God when we're at the complete end of
[58:18] our rope
[58:19] amen but whatever you've got you give it
[58:22] to him and say Lord I need you but if
[58:26] you give it to me I'll give it right
[58:27] back to you I'll put it into your
[58:31] service Hannah says count not thine hand
[58:33] made for a daughter of bile for out of
[58:36] the abundance of my complaint and grief
[58:39] have I spoken hitherto the the Amplified
[58:42] says for out of my great complaint and
[58:44] bitter provocation I have been speaking
[58:46] in other words she's saying God has let
[58:49] me down and I'm here and I'm sharing him
[58:52] how that's affected
[58:54] me like I said so often we spiritualize
[58:56] it I'm German we we we swallow our
[58:59] emotions no matter what we
[59:01] feel God never asked us to do
[59:05] it but we don't dwell in it we don't let
[59:08] ourselves hang out in those things but
[59:11] there's nothing wrong with letting God
[59:13] know I don't know what's going on I'm
[59:15] disappointed I'm
[59:16] hurt I'm feeling offended I did my part
[59:19] and you're letting me
[59:21] down but just remember he's God he knows
[59:25] all things he sees all
[59:28] things watch Eli's answer he says then
[59:31] Eli answered and said go in
[59:33] peace and the god of Israel Grant thee
[59:36] thy petition that thou Hast asked of him
[59:39] and she said let thine handmade find
[59:42] Grace in thy sight so the woman went her
[59:45] way and did eat and her countenance was
[59:48] no more
[59:49] sad she took the man of God at his word
[59:54] and church Hannah's attitude changed now
[59:58] it didn't change when she gets a baby it
[1:00:00] changed right then she took God at his
[1:00:03] word then she took that priest that high
[1:00:05] priest as the mouthpiece of God and she
[1:00:07] said I believe it I'm accepting it and
[1:00:10] she went and she ate and it says her
[1:00:12] countenance is no more set she wasn't
[1:00:14] she wasn't down in the mouth she wasn't
[1:00:15] an eore
[1:00:16] anymore it says and they rose up in the
[1:00:19] morning early and worship before the
[1:00:20] Lord and returned and came to their
[1:00:22] house in RMA and elaa knew Hannah his
[1:00:26] wife and the Lord remembered her it says
[1:00:29] wherefore it came to pass that when the
[1:00:32] time was come after Hannah had conceived
[1:00:34] that she bear a son and called his name
[1:00:36] Samuel saying because I have asked him
[1:00:40] of the Lord in verse 16 and 17 says it
[1:00:44] went her way you know what hand his
[1:00:46] victory that she needed was over herself
[1:00:49] that's the first thing that God had to
[1:00:51] deal with Hanah on was her attitude and
[1:00:53] as soon as he got her attitude right
[1:00:57] then he could give her the promise
[1:00:59] because her attitude now allowed her to
[1:01:01] give God what he needed out of
[1:01:04] her Hannah would be given a son and the
[1:01:07] baby's name was
[1:01:09] Samuel why did she name him that she
[1:01:12] named him after her Victory she named
[1:01:14] him after her experience Samuel means
[1:01:17] God has heard and she says because I
[1:01:19] have asked the right way God has heard
[1:01:22] because I kept asking God has heard
[1:01:25] because I went to God God has heard
[1:01:29] anden she went to the right place she
[1:01:30] said the right thing she reminded him of
[1:01:32] the right thing and when her attitude
[1:01:35] came in alignment God gave her the
[1:01:37] promise because she stepped into his
[1:01:38] perfect word church when God hears us
[1:01:41] victory's coming Victory is coming when
[1:01:43] God hears us because God never moves
[1:01:45] without purpose and without effect we
[1:01:48] notice El canaa had two wives here he
[1:01:50] had Hannah and he had panina but I want
[1:01:52] you to draw your attention to something
[1:01:54] panina crw used through
[1:01:58] life panina never had any issues panina
[1:02:01] had Sons panina had daughters panina had
[1:02:05] a husband that paid her attention she
[1:02:07] had every blessing of the
[1:02:08] word without any
[1:02:11] work but you know what panina did with
[1:02:13] her blessings she used them to persecute
[1:02:16] somebody
[1:02:18] else God couldn't use
[1:02:21] panina panina was horrible under the
[1:02:23] blessings of God can you imagine what
[1:02:25] would happened if she was the one that
[1:02:27] was
[1:02:27] under Hannah's curse so to
[1:02:33] speak God didn't choose panina the one
[1:02:36] that had it all to produce a prophit he
[1:02:39] chose
[1:02:40] Hannah because through it all Hannah
[1:02:43] kept coming back to God Hannah was a
[1:02:46] daughter of God Hannah was a real
[1:02:49] believer even in her bitterness even in
[1:02:51] her pain even in her suffering in her
[1:02:53] persecution she kept coming back to God
[1:02:55] Hannah in all of those things never
[1:02:57] stopped going to church she never
[1:02:59] stopped listening to the priesthood she
[1:03:01] never C stopped praying to God she never
[1:03:03] pulled back from her relationship she
[1:03:05] kept going back to him every single time
[1:03:08] even in her pain even in her suffering
[1:03:10] there was an eternal difference between
[1:03:12] Hannah and panina they weren't Cut From
[1:03:14] the Same Cloth they weren't brought from
[1:03:16] the same Source if you want to put it
[1:03:18] that way Hannah's everything that
[1:03:20] happened drove her to God and all panina
[1:03:23] did was
[1:03:24] persecute even under those blessings of
[1:03:27] God shows that within the framework of
[1:03:29] Believers there's those that are and
[1:03:31] there's those those that pretend they
[1:03:33] are Paul talks about it in Romans 9 he
[1:03:36] says he's speaking of the Jews he says
[1:03:38] who are Israelites to whom pertaineth
[1:03:39] the adoption the glory the covenants the
[1:03:42] giving of the law and the service of God
[1:03:44] and the promises the people of Israel
[1:03:46] had all the promises of God he says
[1:03:48] whose are the fathers and of whom is
[1:03:50] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[1:03:52] over all God bless forever amen Jews
[1:03:55] have the natural bloodline of Christ if
[1:03:56] we want to we know that's not true but
[1:03:58] carnally speaking that's the way it
[1:04:00] looks he says not as though the word of
[1:04:03] God had taken none effect for they are
[1:04:05] not all Israel which are of Israel
[1:04:08] Paul's saying not everyone that's in the
[1:04:10] chosen group is the chosen
[1:04:13] people they're named amongst the
[1:04:15] Israelites but not every Israelite was a
[1:04:17] child of God we know that from their
[1:04:20] time in the desert only two came out of
[1:04:22] the 2 million two one in a million I was
[1:04:26] a true Son of God the rest died by the
[1:04:28] wayside because they weren't a part of
[1:04:30] him in the first place not all who call
[1:04:32] themselves Believers are believers not
[1:04:33] everyone who says there's a Christian is
[1:04:35] a Christian not everyone who says they
[1:04:36] have the Holy Ghost has the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] amen but there are those that are born
[1:04:42] for a purpose there are those that are
[1:04:44] produced because God ordained them to be
[1:04:47] in that thing John 1 says this but as
[1:04:50] many as received him to them gave he
[1:04:52] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:04:54] them that believe on his name you can
[1:04:56] only believe on his name if he ordained
[1:04:58] you as his son or daughter if you come
[1:05:01] from him in verse 13 says which were
[1:05:03] born every one of us is born every
[1:05:06] person in this world is born but there's
[1:05:08] some that are born of blood that some
[1:05:10] that are born of the will of the Flesh
[1:05:12] and of the will of man but Paul says
[1:05:14] that's not us he says which were born
[1:05:17] not of blood nor of the will of the
[1:05:19] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[1:05:22] we are born of the will of God God chose
[1:05:24] Hannah he ordained her her adopted
[1:05:27] position was to produce a prophet that
[1:05:30] would be ordained and given to the
[1:05:32] service of God from his very Birth by
[1:05:35] her choice by her
[1:05:39] will God didn't force her into it she
[1:05:42] did it of her own free will her adoptive
[1:05:45] position was to ask God for a son the
[1:05:47] right way with the right
[1:05:50] reason that's the only thing God needed
[1:05:52] out of Hannah her entire life was to
[1:05:54] Bear Samuel
[1:05:56] that's it that was all God wanted to do
[1:06:00] what did she do Church she found his
[1:06:02] purpose in her
[1:06:05] need see so often we're focused on the
[1:06:07] need God says how about you look for the
[1:06:09] purpose in this and as soon as she finds
[1:06:12] God's purpose she steps in and her
[1:06:14] request becomes his will and God gives
[1:06:17] her the desires of her heart what was
[1:06:19] she doing Church she was stepping up she
[1:06:22] was coming into a higher plane a higher
[1:06:24] understanding she was stepping up into
[1:06:26] God's thoughts of her life and
[1:06:29] situation let me put it this
[1:06:32] way the reproach in Hannah's life was
[1:06:36] God's
[1:06:38] favor can you understand that look at
[1:06:42] Joseph the reproach that Joseph bore was
[1:06:45] the favor of God to raise him to the
[1:06:47] right hand of pharaoh and to save the
[1:06:50] very people that persecuted him in the
[1:06:51] first
[1:06:53] place for all we know Samuel made all
[1:06:55] the difference in their kids' lives
[1:06:57] after that Samuel was a prophet he led
[1:06:59] the he led the people of Israel
[1:07:00] Faithfully never made a foot never made
[1:07:02] a step wrong as far as we know Samuel
[1:07:04] never did anything wrong he wasn't
[1:07:06] perfect we know that because he was
[1:07:07] human but in his leadership Samuel was
[1:07:10] perfect he was perfect that was the gift
[1:07:13] that Hannah gave to Israel when she
[1:07:14] stepped into her position that was the
[1:07:16] edifying portion of Hannah where she
[1:07:18] brought a prophet and she dedicated him
[1:07:20] from the day he was born to the service
[1:07:21] of the Lord and she let nothing get in
[1:07:23] there to to get him dirty or mess up his
[1:07:25] life life for these different
[1:07:27] things Hannah's
[1:07:29] reproach was God's favor to
[1:07:33] her can we see that in our lives
[1:07:38] sometimes I've had things taken away
[1:07:40] from me that I thought I should have
[1:07:42] been able to keep I've gone through
[1:07:45] health issues I've gone through money
[1:07:46] issues I've gone through church issues
[1:07:47] I've gone through Ministry issues I've
[1:07:49] gone through people issues I've gone
[1:07:51] through work
[1:07:52] issues and you say that ought to be mine
[1:07:57] no God's got a
[1:07:59] purpose Above All God's got a purpose
[1:08:03] amen and that's what he's trying to do
[1:08:05] as adopted Sons and Daughters is to
[1:08:06] bring us fully into that purpose and
[1:08:08] start looking at things the way God
[1:08:10] looks through it and to seek after his
[1:08:11] will and his way and his sight and these
[1:08:14] different things Hannah wanted the child
[1:08:16] to remove her reproach to stop the
[1:08:18] persecution to shut panina up once and
[1:08:21] for all to show the rest of the of the
[1:08:24] community that was a good woman a
[1:08:26] spiritual woman a Godly woman she wanted
[1:08:29] it for
[1:08:30] herself but when she turned her desire
[1:08:33] loose and said God I'll give it to you
[1:08:35] that's when God could finally start
[1:08:37] working with
[1:08:38] Hannah Hannah wasn't allowed to just be
[1:08:40] a mom Church she had to be a mom of a
[1:08:43] prophet she couldn't be like the other
[1:08:45] moms she couldn't be like panina she
[1:08:47] couldn't be like the other ladies at
[1:08:49] church she had to be a special kind of
[1:08:51] mom a mom that would hold her children
[1:08:53] apart from everything in the world that
[1:08:55] first child had to be perfect perfectly
[1:08:58] raised and God needed a woman like
[1:09:00] Hannah to do it and so he put her under
[1:09:03] reproach until she come to the place to
[1:09:05] get into his perfect
[1:09:07] will we read this quote last time but
[1:09:09] let's put it into context
[1:09:11] now he says but if each one of you in
[1:09:14] here has not now has not been
[1:09:16] positionally placed you might be nothing
[1:09:18] but a housewife you might be nothing but
[1:09:20] a Hannah this morning this evening he
[1:09:22] says well you say brother brandom I
[1:09:24] never done a thing in my life I'm not a
[1:09:25] preacher well maybe God brought you here
[1:09:28] to raise a family of children and out of
[1:09:30] that family of children may come another
[1:09:32] family of children that'll be a preacher
[1:09:34] that'll send a million souls to Christ
[1:09:36] he says you had to be here you're here
[1:09:40] for a purpose he says did you know that
[1:09:43] see we don't see that far down the road
[1:09:46] God sees all things but but God's trying
[1:09:49] to pour out his blessings on us but he's
[1:09:52] trying to help us find his purpose in
[1:09:53] his Blessing he's trying to help us see
[1:09:56] there's more to Blessings than just
[1:09:58] giving them to you they're meant they're
[1:10:01] given with purpose they're given as a
[1:10:04] testimony they're there to show the hand
[1:10:06] of God in your life they're there to
[1:10:08] differentiate the sons of God from the
[1:10:09] sons of this world from the daughters of
[1:10:12] this world from the daughters of God and
[1:10:14] sometimes that means that reproach has
[1:10:16] to come first that hard times have to
[1:10:18] come first before the promise comes in
[1:10:20] our life we want Power what are we going
[1:10:22] to do with it we want to write big
[1:10:24] chanks from the checks from the bank of
[1:10:26] Heaven who's going to benefit what's our
[1:10:29] motive what's our objective brother Ram
[1:10:31] says you want healing what are you going
[1:10:32] to do with your healing do you just want
[1:10:34] healing to be healed or do you want
[1:10:36] healing to glorify God to put your
[1:10:38] health into his into his purpose into
[1:10:41] his benefit for the kingdom in these
[1:10:42] different things our desire as adopted
[1:10:45] Sons and Daughters of God is always to
[1:10:47] glorify the father that's it and we
[1:10:50] don't even enter into those things it's
[1:10:53] not about us it's always about him
[1:10:55] brother B puts it this way he says the
[1:10:57] only way that God can preach the gospel
[1:11:00] today is through that lump of clay he
[1:11:03] says and that's why he's keeping you
[1:11:06] here he says now that's why you sick
[1:11:09] people have a right to come to Christ
[1:11:11] and say Lord Jesus if you'll only heal
[1:11:13] me now I'll go I may not be a preacher
[1:11:17] but I'll talk about it I'll do
[1:11:19] everything I can you are the vine I'm
[1:11:22] one of the branches he says now the vine
[1:11:24] doesn't bear fruit the branches bears
[1:11:26] fruit not the vine the branch the vine
[1:11:29] only puts energy into it see we want the
[1:11:32] power of the Holy Spirit we want
[1:11:34] everything in God's kingdom behind us
[1:11:36] but to do what produce
[1:11:39] fruit that's the work of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:41] that's the evidence is to produce fruit
[1:11:43] and fruit is not for the sake of the
[1:11:44] tree it's for the sake of those that are
[1:11:46] around the tree as we've talked about
[1:11:48] before he says the gospel can be
[1:11:51] preached by Christ how if you'll open up
[1:11:54] yourself
[1:11:56] and be a branch that'll bear forth fruit
[1:11:59] he says others can see Christ in you by
[1:12:01] your testimony by your life and the way
[1:12:04] you live he is the energy but you're the
[1:12:07] picture show you're the walking Bible
[1:12:10] see what happens so often is we look at
[1:12:13] God's word and we know God's word is his
[1:12:15] will but we want to turn God's word into
[1:12:18] our will rather than what turn God's
[1:12:21] word into his will by submitting
[1:12:23] ourselves to it we want all the benefit
[1:12:26] without the
[1:12:29] purpose see that's immature thinking
[1:12:31] that's childish thinking it's for me no
[1:12:35] it's for him it's always for him it's
[1:12:37] always for the Kingdom Purpose amen if
[1:12:39] we want to use it for our benefit then
[1:12:41] we forget that the word of God is given
[1:12:43] with purpose always cuz it goes out to
[1:12:46] do something and that something is a
[1:12:48] purpose it comes back after a while
[1:12:50] having produced those things if we can
[1:12:53] get ourselves into his purpose not ours
[1:12:55] that's when the real power comes cuz
[1:12:57] then we're just stepping perfectly into
[1:12:58] his path amen that's when we can have
[1:13:00] faith that's when we can have
[1:13:02] expectation that's when we can have hope
[1:13:03] is when we say Lord I know I'm in your
[1:13:05] will we've read that quote before where
[1:13:07] brother Brandon was asked are you ever
[1:13:09] scared on that on that
[1:13:10] platform I don't know what you do what I
[1:13:13] do if somebody walked up with somebody
[1:13:14] in a wheelchair with full expectation of
[1:13:17] them being healed I can't heal them I
[1:13:20] don't know if I've got faith enough to
[1:13:21] heal somebody in a in a wheelchair I
[1:13:24] don't imagine I do yet but if God told
[1:13:28] me that today somebody's going to come
[1:13:30] up in a wheelchair and if you'll lay
[1:13:32] hands on them they'll be heal guess what
[1:13:34] I'll have the faith then brother Braham
[1:13:36] says every time if he's told me to be
[1:13:38] there I have no fear I trust him because
[1:13:41] I'm in his will in his plan I was
[1:13:44] reading and and maybe we'll share this
[1:13:45] at a different time because it it plays
[1:13:47] into another portion of adoption brother
[1:13:49] B would talk about other ministers and
[1:13:51] he says they've got their their
[1:13:53] campaigns booked for years ahead of time
[1:13:56] he says I don't know where I'm going to
[1:13:58] be
[1:14:00] tomorrow cuz
[1:14:02] what he's not saying they're not led by
[1:14:04] the Holy Ghost but he says my Ministry
[1:14:07] is instant in season I've got to be able
[1:14:10] to go when he goes remember when he he's
[1:14:12] he's supposed to go to his plane and the
[1:14:14] Holy Spirit leads him away from the
[1:14:15] plane and he ends up going and praying
[1:14:17] for that boy that had a venial disease
[1:14:19] and the the mother was was out by the
[1:14:21] the fence leaning over it and he walks
[1:14:23] by she says howdy Parson and he gets
[1:14:25] past her and then something clicks and
[1:14:26] he says how do you know I'm a person
[1:14:29] I've been praying to the Lord this
[1:14:30] morning and God took him away from his
[1:14:33] airplane made him think that he missed
[1:14:35] it to go pray for a Praying woman's
[1:14:38] son that's the kind of leadership he had
[1:14:41] so he says I may be planned to be
[1:14:43] somewhere next week and I may not make
[1:14:44] it because the Holy Spirit leads
[1:14:47] me it's about stepping into his
[1:14:50] will and that's what produces the
[1:14:53] reality of God Sisters You Are called to
[1:14:55] produce the reality of God by raising
[1:14:57] your children in the admonition of
[1:14:59] nurture of the Lord that is your place
[1:15:01] that is your position that God has put
[1:15:03] you in you're not just wives and mothers
[1:15:06] panina was just a wife and a mother
[1:15:08] you're called to be a Hannah you're
[1:15:10] called to be there with real
[1:15:12] purpose that the desires that God has
[1:15:15] placed in your heart for your children
[1:15:17] from his
[1:15:18] word that's an adopted position for you
[1:15:20] to lay hold of to step into and say this
[1:15:23] is mine Lord you've told me what to be
[1:15:26] you've told me what your bride's
[1:15:27] supposed to be and I'm raising a portion
[1:15:29] of your bride he's given little Souls
[1:15:31] into your hands dads don't get the time
[1:15:34] with them that mothers do brother bandam
[1:15:36] called you the Fifth
[1:15:38] Gospel that's how great your lives are
[1:15:40] the impact that you have and God has
[1:15:43] chosen you personally specifically for
[1:15:47] your family for your husband and for the
[1:15:50] children that are there David got a
[1:15:52] revelation of being made perfectly
[1:15:55] do you know that David got a revelation
[1:15:57] that he was built for the task we see it
[1:15:59] in Psalms 139 because David learned to
[1:16:02] rely on God's choosing of him rather
[1:16:04] than his sight of what he looked like
[1:16:05] and how he thought he could fulfill it
[1:16:07] David wasn't caught up in his abilities
[1:16:09] David was caught up in God called me and
[1:16:11] anointed me and that's what makes the
[1:16:12] difference but po but but David would
[1:16:15] say this in Psalms 139 he says I will
[1:16:17] praise
[1:16:19] thee can we praise him this
[1:16:22] evening why can David praise him for for
[1:16:25] I am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:16:30] made that word fearfully means
[1:16:33] specifically David said I am
[1:16:35] specifically you know what wonderfully
[1:16:37] made means
[1:16:40] awesome I literally looked it up in the
[1:16:42] office and it means awesome but it's not
[1:16:45] awesome in the way of this world it's
[1:16:47] awesome in that it is a reflection of
[1:16:49] the work and the power of
[1:16:53] God Church you are awesome tonight but
[1:16:57] not awesome the way this world looks at
[1:16:59] it you are awesome because God has built
[1:17:01] you with him inside of
[1:17:04] you David said I can praise him because
[1:17:07] he built me with a portion of him that's
[1:17:11] what he's saying and he built me
[1:17:12] specifically for my life that's ahead of
[1:17:14] me he says marvelous are thy works you
[1:17:17] did a good job
[1:17:22] God that's what he's saying David saying
[1:17:25] God you built me
[1:17:27] right and you know what Satan tries to
[1:17:30] do you're built
[1:17:32] wrong you can't do it look at
[1:17:35] you look at
[1:17:37] you comparative spirituality like we
[1:17:40] talked about they're better therefore I
[1:17:43] can't he says and that my soul knoweth
[1:17:46] right well my substance was not hid from
[1:17:48] thee he says the way I'm built it wasn't
[1:17:50] hit from you he says when I was made in
[1:17:52] secret and curiously wrought in the the
[1:17:54] lowest parts of the earth you know what
[1:17:56] that curiously rot means it's it's
[1:17:59] talking about the blending and adding of
[1:18:02] colors together to produce a particular
[1:18:06] shade in other words some intelligence
[1:18:09] has to come and just blend everything
[1:18:12] together to produce exactly what was in
[1:18:14] their mind that's what David said God
[1:18:17] did with
[1:18:18] him he says Thine Eyes did see my
[1:18:20] substance yet being imperfect before the
[1:18:22] work was done he says and in thy book
[1:18:26] all my members were written which in
[1:18:28] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:18:31] there was none of them in other words he
[1:18:32] says all our life was written before we
[1:18:34] were born the way I was built the way
[1:18:36] you built me the purpose the UPS the
[1:18:39] Downs the victories the overcoming it
[1:18:41] was all built in and pre-planned he says
[1:18:45] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[1:18:47] me oh God how great is the sum of them
[1:18:50] the sum of them see we tend to look at
[1:18:52] things at specific moments it's a high
[1:18:55] it's a low it's a good it's a bad but
[1:18:58] but David says the whole sum of it he
[1:19:00] says that's a wonderful thing when I can
[1:19:02] see the full picture you know what
[1:19:04] David's saying he's saying when God
[1:19:06] picks he picks the best when God builds
[1:19:09] he builds the best he build you exactly
[1:19:11] as is needed to do it and then what do
[1:19:14] we do we sit back and we say I'm not
[1:19:16] smart enough I'm not good enough I can't
[1:19:19] do it I'm not as good as those next to
[1:19:21] me not smart enough not driven enough
[1:19:23] not disciplined enough
[1:19:27] what do we do what are we saying we're
[1:19:30] saying God you picked wrong God you
[1:19:33] built me
[1:19:35] wrong have we had those moments where we
[1:19:38] say this ain't a good idea I've talked
[1:19:41] about it in Ministry for myself God this
[1:19:43] ain't a good idea I don't agree I think
[1:19:47] this will not end well and I'd rather
[1:19:48] not
[1:19:49] learn I'd rather not go through the
[1:19:51] public embarrassment of failing
[1:19:57] listen church we can do all things
[1:19:58] through Christ which strengthens us Paul
[1:20:00] said it's Christ in me that makes me
[1:20:03] anything that I have that's good
[1:20:04] today but on the flip side what does
[1:20:06] Satan do see God says you're the best
[1:20:09] and we say no we're not God says I made
[1:20:12] you exactly the way that you're needed
[1:20:13] and we
[1:20:15] say and then what does Satan do he comes
[1:20:17] behind he reinforces
[1:20:19] that right Satan beats us up on our
[1:20:22] temper
[1:20:25] our weight our lack of discipline our
[1:20:28] dirty
[1:20:29] house the simple cooking beans and
[1:20:32] weenies macaroni weeners chicken noodle
[1:20:36] soup every day and he says you're not a
[1:20:39] mother you're not a good mother you're
[1:20:41] not a good wife you can't do this you
[1:20:43] can't do
[1:20:44] that you know what you ought to say
[1:20:48] sisters Satan what does it say about you
[1:20:51] that God picked a little weakling like
[1:20:53] me to kick you out of this house
[1:20:56] to have overcoming power inside of this
[1:20:58] home by the authority of the headship of
[1:21:00] my husband under Christ to take you and
[1:21:03] kick you out of this house anytime I
[1:21:04] want
[1:21:07] to women when you can sit there and say
[1:21:10] God has wonderfully made me God has
[1:21:14] specifically built me to destroy the
[1:21:17] works of Satan inside this home it'll
[1:21:19] change our attitudes
[1:21:21] forever when when we get up every
[1:21:23] morning when you get up every morning
[1:21:25] and you say I'm built to destroy the
[1:21:29] works of Satan in this home that's when
[1:21:32] you start stepping into your adoptive
[1:21:34] position because that's your first order
[1:21:37] is the family that God gives you and the
[1:21:39] home that your husband provides for
[1:21:42] you you're not here because you loved
[1:21:45] your husband because he chose you and
[1:21:47] you said yes you don't have kids because
[1:21:49] you have a loving relationship you have
[1:21:50] them because God ordained them and he
[1:21:52] ordained you to help raise them
[1:21:55] you know what's funny Satan likes to
[1:21:57] beat us
[1:21:59] up when we moved to Mount Pearl from
[1:22:02] killbride and we moved into a bit of a
[1:22:05] rougher area there near the the the low
[1:22:07] income housing and whatnot and we went
[1:22:09] up and they wanted to play against us in
[1:22:11] different sports and I've said before
[1:22:13] the first time we played them in
[1:22:14] baseball it was just me and Nathan and
[1:22:17] Matt and Adam four of us and we took on
[1:22:19] the whole neighborhood and we beat them
[1:22:20] 20 to nothing I think in two innings
[1:22:22] then the next game we beat them 20 to1
[1:22:24] or 19 nothing something like that in in
[1:22:26] three
[1:22:27] Innings and so then they went to
[1:22:29] basketball and we beat them in
[1:22:30] basketball then they went to hockey and
[1:22:31] that was even worse and we were
[1:22:33] dominating the neighborhood but then
[1:22:35] we'd be playing on a Wednesday night and
[1:22:38] and we'd say well we've got to go now
[1:22:40] where you going we're going to church so
[1:22:43] they started calling us Church
[1:22:45] boys Satan calls us a lot of names but
[1:22:49] you know what I've said and I know I've
[1:22:50] said this before I said you'll notice
[1:22:52] that the church boys keep beating you
[1:22:54] maybe you need to go to
[1:22:56] church Satan keeps pushing your butt and
[1:22:58] say Satan whatever you say I am I'm
[1:23:01] still beating you and remind him that
[1:23:04] he's the loser in this one you've got
[1:23:07] the Victory and he's under your
[1:23:10] foot he's under you because you're a
[1:23:12] part of the body of Christ and it says
[1:23:14] everything is under him he has no place
[1:23:17] to stand in your presence he's just
[1:23:19] bluffing you to make you think you're
[1:23:20] less than he is and you're more than
[1:23:22] conquerors through Christ
[1:23:25] but I want you to see Hannah's
[1:23:27] finish I want you to see how Hannah
[1:23:29] treated this cuz cuz Hannah went year
[1:23:31] upon year upon year without an answer to
[1:23:33] her prayer and then she finally gets
[1:23:35] that answer and she gives it back to God
[1:23:37] and she gives it to God without holding
[1:23:40] back without bitterness she gives it she
[1:23:43] gives Samuel right back to God but I
[1:23:45] want you to see what God does in 1st
[1:23:47] Samuel 2 it says and the Lord visited
[1:23:49] Hannah so that she conceived and bare
[1:23:52] three sons and two daughters daughters
[1:23:55] says and the child Samuel grew before
[1:23:57] the
[1:23:57] Lord what was Hannah's desire for CH for
[1:24:00] a child what did God give her he gave
[1:24:03] her five what's five
[1:24:07] Grace Grace it was God's grace to Hannah
[1:24:10] she gave away everything she had no
[1:24:13] promise of a second child but she gave
[1:24:15] the only child she had back to him and
[1:24:17] God came back and he gave her grace upon
[1:24:19] Grace upon Grace upon Grace five
[1:24:21] children he filled her quiver filled her
[1:24:24] quiver and she got to enjoy the full
[1:24:26] benefits of the promise of the word of
[1:24:27] God now because what she gave the first
[1:24:31] fruits she gave the glory to God she
[1:24:34] gave the child to
[1:24:36] God church God knows how to bless us God
[1:24:40] knows how to answer a prayer the way we
[1:24:42] could never even
[1:24:44] imagine listen to this brother Bram said
[1:24:46] this I thought this was a beautiful
[1:24:47] quote brother Andrew Glover shared this
[1:24:49] the other day he said now Joshua when he
[1:24:52] come to the end of the trail through the
[1:24:53] wilderness he needed a bridge to cross
[1:24:55] over Jordan into the promised land he
[1:24:58] needed a bridge he says but God's
[1:25:01] provided way was a power not a bridge he
[1:25:04] sent a power and he held the river back
[1:25:06] and he walked across on dry land that
[1:25:08] was God's provided way not a bridge he
[1:25:11] had a better engineer so he just sent
[1:25:13] him power and pushed the water back
[1:25:16] until he walked over on dry
[1:25:19] land can you imagine Joshua and he's
[1:25:23] praying for a bridge
[1:25:27] and if all he is looking for is a bridge
[1:25:30] he's going to be
[1:25:31] disappointed but what does Joshua do
[1:25:34] Joshua comes up to the water because God
[1:25:36] says on the third day you're going to go
[1:25:38] over and then cross
[1:25:39] over and Joshua only has to obey and God
[1:25:43] makes the way that's all he had to do
[1:25:46] listen to this he says Daniel for the
[1:25:47] cause of God was thrown into a lion's
[1:25:49] den he needed a fence but God sent an
[1:25:52] angel what a difference that was God's
[1:25:54] provided way he needed a fence but God
[1:25:57] gave him an angel and what a better
[1:25:59] fence it was he says he always gives you
[1:26:02] better than you ask for always he says
[1:26:06] he needed a fence but God sent him an
[1:26:08] angel the Hebrew children they needed
[1:26:10] some water to put out that fire he says
[1:26:13] but God sent them the fourth man that's
[1:26:16] all they needed he untied their hands
[1:26:18] and talk with them they walked out
[1:26:20] without the smell of fire on them they
[1:26:22] needed water and he sent the fourth man
[1:26:25] what's he saying he's saying sometimes
[1:26:27] the limitation on God is what we're
[1:26:29] trying to put him in a box about we're
[1:26:31] saying Lord and we're praying and we're
[1:26:33] praying and we're praying and we're
[1:26:35] directing God and God's saying if you'll
[1:26:37] just let go I'll give you more than you
[1:26:39] could ever ask for we're saying I want
[1:26:42] this and he's trying to pour out a
[1:26:44] bigger blessing and we're limiting
[1:26:45] ourselves by our little peanut
[1:26:49] brains can you imagine if Joshua was
[1:26:52] praying for that bridge and he never got
[1:26:54] it it but he didn't pray for a bridge he
[1:26:57] prayed for leadership and he followed
[1:26:58] God's leadership and God made a way
[1:27:00] through that's why we need to seek the
[1:27:02] will of God above all else then our
[1:27:04] prayer will get
[1:27:05] right then the answer of God comes amen
[1:27:08] if Joshua is praying for a bridge he's
[1:27:10] got the goal right to get into Canaan to
[1:27:13] cross over Jordan but the path is wrong
[1:27:15] the the way of doing it wrong seek
[1:27:18] leadership not giving God his answer we
[1:27:21] can't put God in that box Paul said this
[1:27:24] in
[1:27:26] Ephesians he says that Christ May dwell
[1:27:28] in your hearts by faith this is a the
[1:27:31] Walk of the Believers by faith always
[1:27:34] but he says that ye been rooted and
[1:27:36] grounded in love this is a love
[1:27:39] relationship first and foremost if you
[1:27:41] don't know that he loves you and if you
[1:27:43] don't love him it's not going to work
[1:27:45] you've got to love him back and with
[1:27:47] that love comes trust and with that love
[1:27:49] will come Faith as well
[1:27:51] then he says that you may what be able
[1:27:54] to
[1:27:55] comprehend now that word comprehend us
[1:27:57] means understand but in the original it
[1:28:01] doesn't mean that it says that you may
[1:28:02] be able to obtain that you may be able
[1:28:05] to lay hold of that you may be able to
[1:28:08] experience with All Saints what is the
[1:28:11] breadth the length the depth and the
[1:28:15] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:28:17] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:28:20] filled with all the fullness of God
[1:28:24] God's wanting to pour more into you than
[1:28:26] you even realize God's wanting to do
[1:28:28] more in our lives than we could ever
[1:28:30] expect or imagine Paul says it now unto
[1:28:33] him that is able to do exceedingly
[1:28:36] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:28:38] think according to the power that
[1:28:40] worketh in us he says you've been given
[1:28:42] something the holy spirit inside of you
[1:28:44] can bless you more than you could ask or
[1:28:46] think you know what that tells me if I
[1:28:48] can get my thinking and my asking out of
[1:28:50] the way God can probably do more than I
[1:28:52] ever expected
[1:28:55] sometimes all we have to do is say Lord
[1:28:58] here's the need and I'm trusting you it
[1:29:01] is
[1:29:02] amazing I hope to share a testimony with
[1:29:04] you in the next 12 to 18 months of one
[1:29:08] prayer with a simple
[1:29:12] answer something I literally just prayed
[1:29:15] about
[1:29:16] yesterday and I hope to see it happen in
[1:29:20] the very near future not telling God how
[1:29:22] to do it not trying to make it happen
[1:29:24] not trying to manipulate and move things
[1:29:26] around play the chessboard but just say
[1:29:29] Lord here's the need I'm putting it in
[1:29:32] your
[1:29:33] hands I want to give that testimony and
[1:29:35] I'm believing I
[1:29:37] will I'm
[1:29:39] excited I'm excited because when we can
[1:29:42] free ourselves from our own little
[1:29:44] minds and say God you're God God I'm
[1:29:48] going to let you be you and I'm going to
[1:29:51] be me
[1:29:54] he says according to the power that
[1:29:56] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[1:29:58] Church of Christ by Christ Jesus
[1:30:00] throughout all ages the World Without
[1:30:02] End
[1:30:05] Amen don't raise your hands to this
[1:30:08] question but how many in here have been
[1:30:11] praying for something for a long time
[1:30:14] and you haven't got it and you can say
[1:30:17] brother John I've
[1:30:18] got chapter and verse book chapter verse
[1:30:24] and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed
[1:30:28] and I don't have
[1:30:29] it I believe there's many in here have
[1:30:32] it I believe there's many in here that
[1:30:34] are doing it but hold that on your heart
[1:30:37] as we move forward this is the last
[1:30:38] portion that we want to talk about this
[1:30:40] this evening but hold tight to your
[1:30:43] promise hold tight to your promise cuz
[1:30:46] he'll never fail if you've got it in his
[1:30:49] word he'll never fail amen no matter
[1:30:51] what you can see no matter what you
[1:30:52] don't see I I read this the other day I
[1:30:54] think brother Jason Watkin said it he
[1:30:56] said faith can move mountains sometimes
[1:30:58] one Pebble at a
[1:31:01] time and the thing is we'll never notice
[1:31:03] the
[1:31:04] pebble we'll never notice it but it's
[1:31:07] moving
[1:31:08] nonetheless and as we've been preaching
[1:31:10] on here this evening sometimes the
[1:31:11] mountain that needs to be moved is our
[1:31:13] will and our perspective that's all
[1:31:16] sometimes the battle is in here it's not
[1:31:17] out there and God's just trying to get
[1:31:19] us to step up into how things are
[1:31:21] supposed to go sometimes we just need to
[1:31:23] sit sit back not sometimes every time we
[1:31:26] need to sit back and say God the promise
[1:31:28] is yours the word is yours the power is
[1:31:31] yours I'm just going to rest in what you
[1:31:33] said I'm just going to take you at your
[1:31:37] word and I'm not going to back
[1:31:39] away I'm not going to pull it back I'm
[1:31:42] not going to set it aside but I'm going
[1:31:44] to say this belongs to me and I'm going
[1:31:46] to trust you to do it I'm going to trust
[1:31:48] you to do
[1:31:49] it Paul said this this is one of the
[1:31:51] most beautiful scriptures I believe it
[1:31:54] says for the scripture saith whosoever
[1:31:57] believeth on him shall not be
[1:31:59] ashamed whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:32:01] not be ashamed that word ashamed means
[1:32:03] disappointed whoever believes on him
[1:32:05] will not be disappointed Whoever has
[1:32:08] faith in the promises of God won't be
[1:32:09] left
[1:32:11] disappointed just don't put your faith
[1:32:14] and God in a box say God I've got faith
[1:32:17] in you and I'm going to let you do the
[1:32:19] work amen
[1:32:24] we had a moment before church where my
[1:32:26] youngest I told him to get ready and I
[1:32:29] said put your shoes
[1:32:31] on and so I got his shoes down for him I
[1:32:34] gave him the means of getting himself
[1:32:36] ready and I said put your shoes on and
[1:32:38] he said okay and he started to put his
[1:32:41] shoes on he started to put on the left
[1:32:44] one
[1:32:45] first and he he struggled with it for a
[1:32:47] bit and then he said Daddy I can't put
[1:32:50] my shoes on and you know what I said yes
[1:32:53] you can
[1:32:55] cuz I knew he could and you know what he
[1:32:59] had faith that I was right even though
[1:33:01] he didn't think he could do it and he
[1:33:03] bent down and sure enough within 15
[1:33:05] seconds he had that shoe
[1:33:07] on so you would think having done it
[1:33:10] once he'd believe it for the second one
[1:33:12] but you know what happened he started
[1:33:13] the second one and then he said Daddy I
[1:33:15] can't get my shoe on I said yes you can
[1:33:18] keep trying and you know what happened
[1:33:20] he kept trying and 15 seconds later he
[1:33:23] had both shoes
[1:33:26] on what did he have to do he had to have
[1:33:29] faith that Daddy was right so that he
[1:33:32] could get his shoes on I wasn't going to
[1:33:35] go down and put on I've seen him put his
[1:33:36] shoes on I know he can put his shoes on
[1:33:39] but he didn't have faith in himself but
[1:33:42] when daddy said yes you can it
[1:33:44] reinvigorated him to try again and sure
[1:33:47] enough all of a sudden he had it
[1:33:49] remember brother Brandon would say he
[1:33:51] he'd have people coming up and and and
[1:33:53] he said they'd have all Faith they
[1:33:55] thought they'd have all faith and they
[1:33:56] didn't have any and then he said
[1:33:57] somebody would come up and he'd say you
[1:33:58] didn't realize you had that much Faith
[1:34:01] you didn't realize you had that much
[1:34:02] Faith but you had to have somebody
[1:34:04] re-energize you they had to just come
[1:34:06] into the presence of of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:08] they just had to come in a presence of
[1:34:10] somebody that said no you can do it and
[1:34:13] then they'd step up and they do things
[1:34:14] that they didn't believe they could
[1:34:16] which was what believe to receive their
[1:34:20] healing that's what God's trying to do
[1:34:23] saying you you can do it have faith keep
[1:34:27] with it and Watch What
[1:34:31] Happens Hebrews
[1:34:33] 10 what happens after we believe Paul
[1:34:37] says cast not there away therefore your
[1:34:39] confidence which had great recompense of
[1:34:42] reward the a Amplified sayso not
[1:34:44] therefore fling away your Fearless
[1:34:46] confidence you know we enter into
[1:34:48] decision sometimes we enter by faith
[1:34:50] into the promises of God and it's under
[1:34:52] the anointing of the word maybe the the
[1:34:54] the presence of the holy spirit is is so
[1:34:57] powerful the unctions there and what do
[1:34:59] we do with great Fearless confidence we
[1:35:02] step forward and we claim it do we not
[1:35:06] we do of course we do we're Believers he
[1:35:09] says don't throw that
[1:35:11] away he says don't fling away your
[1:35:14] Fearless confidence for it carries a
[1:35:16] great and glorious compensation of
[1:35:18] reward but after you have the Fearless
[1:35:21] confidence he says you have need of
[1:35:24] patience because what God doesn't always
[1:35:27] answer right
[1:35:29] then he says that after you have done
[1:35:32] the will of God you might receive the
[1:35:35] promise there is often a gap between
[1:35:37] your doing and your
[1:35:40] receiving Fearless confidence starts us
[1:35:44] patience takes us to the end and it's
[1:35:48] Faith he says for yet a little while and
[1:35:52] he that shall come will come come and
[1:35:54] will not t now the just shall live by
[1:35:59] faith the Justified shall live by faith
[1:36:03] he says but if any man draw back my soul
[1:36:05] shall have no pleasure in him he says
[1:36:08] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:36:09] into predition but of them that believe
[1:36:12] to the saving of the
[1:36:15] soul I think one of the hardest things
[1:36:18] for a Believer to do is to pray and by
[1:36:21] faith accept the word of God and then
[1:36:23] wait
[1:36:24] and wait with patience and wait with
[1:36:26] rest in a trusting heart it's one of the
[1:36:30] hardest things to do when nothing is
[1:36:32] moving and you've done all you can what
[1:36:34] does the scripture say having done all
[1:36:36] to stand
[1:36:39] stand stand stand hold fast stick with
[1:36:44] it we see or hear the word of God and we
[1:36:47] jump at it and something strikes our
[1:36:49] heart and we say that's for me and we
[1:36:51] claim it and then what happens
[1:36:54] nothing nothing and more nothing and
[1:36:58] sometimes it goes on for minutes days
[1:37:02] weeks years there's things that I've
[1:37:05] prayed about for literally
[1:37:09] decades and still hasn't happened yet
[1:37:12] but I've got a promise for
[1:37:16] it where's my
[1:37:20] Faith Church look around and tell me
[1:37:22] it's not the truth we've we've got kids
[1:37:24] that aren't serving the lord we've got
[1:37:26] families that are torn apart we've got
[1:37:28] relationships that have been severed
[1:37:29] we've got healing that hasn't
[1:37:34] come we've got issues that haven't been
[1:37:38] resolved we've got hurts pains offenses
[1:37:41] all sorts of things and we can pray and
[1:37:43] we can lay up before God and lay up
[1:37:45] before God and our faithful prayer our
[1:37:47] expectations there and then what do we
[1:37:49] do that's what Paul's saying check and
[1:37:51] see what you're doing cuz sometimes in
[1:37:53] our flesh what do we do we lay it down
[1:37:56] and we say what we make an excuse and we
[1:37:59] say it wasn't for
[1:38:02] me you don't find excuses in this
[1:38:06] word God doesn't give
[1:38:09] excuses God's word doesn't change and he
[1:38:12] never backs away from his word but you
[1:38:14] know what we do we back away because it
[1:38:16] doesn't happen in our timing or in the
[1:38:18] way we thought it was
[1:38:24] what Hannah needed first was a change in
[1:38:26] her attitude before she could ever have
[1:38:27] that child and sometimes God's got to do
[1:38:30] something in here before he can do
[1:38:32] something in this or in our families or
[1:38:34] in our relationships or whatever these
[1:38:35] things are you I'm reminded of brother
[1:38:37] brandham brother brandham sent literally
[1:38:40] with a gift of Divine Healing to the
[1:38:43] entire world and he suffers with stomach
[1:38:46] trouble until the last two months of his
[1:38:48] life and he goes year after year decade
[1:38:51] after decade preaching Ing and and
[1:38:55] restoring healing and hold bodies to
[1:38:57] people to thousands hundreds of
[1:39:00] thousands maybe millions of people in
[1:39:01] his entire Ministry and he never
[1:39:04] received his healing until two months
[1:39:05] before he
[1:39:08] died but you know what he never backed
[1:39:12] down he never gave an
[1:39:14] excuse he never said it's not for
[1:39:18] me he just what stayed faithful to his
[1:39:22] calling
[1:39:24] and he prayed for people and they' get
[1:39:26] healed and he'd never get healed and he
[1:39:27] prayed for people and they get healed
[1:39:29] and he never got healed and he never got
[1:39:31] bitter he wondered but he never got
[1:39:34] bitter and he never tried to make an
[1:39:36] excuse for himself and he never tried to
[1:39:37] make an excuse for God he laid it in
[1:39:40] God's hands and he stayed faithful and
[1:39:42] he trusted God to take him through the
[1:39:44] pain and suffering to give him the
[1:39:46] victory in the
[1:39:48] end God made a God made a way through
[1:39:51] and to me it's a wonderful testimony of
[1:39:52] how we can bear what seems to be a
[1:39:55] reproach without giving up on our
[1:39:57] testimony without pulling back in these
[1:39:59] things I want to take one more example
[1:40:02] tonight before we
[1:40:05] close we're going to talk to the
[1:40:07] singles specifically the single sisters
[1:40:09] but it applies to all of us Acts chapter
[1:40:12] 9 says there was a woman there was at
[1:40:14] japa a certain disciple named
[1:40:17] Tabitha which by interpretation is
[1:40:20] called Dorcas and this woman was full of
[1:40:22] good works and alms Deeds which she did
[1:40:25] she was like a an early Mother
[1:40:28] Teresa except she was a child of
[1:40:33] God she wasn't in the Catholic church
[1:40:35] she was in the original Catholic Church
[1:40:37] she was a real angel of
[1:40:39] Mercy a Florence Nightingale maybe says
[1:40:42] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:40:44] she was sick and died she went through
[1:40:46] pain and suffering without deserving it
[1:40:49] and then she
[1:40:51] died good woman given everything she can
[1:40:55] to the service of the Lord it says whom
[1:40:57] when they had washed they laid her in an
[1:40:59] upper chamber and for as much as L was
[1:41:01] night of japa and the disciples had
[1:41:03] heard that Peter was there they sent
[1:41:04] unto him two men Desiring that he would
[1:41:06] not delay to come to them it says then
[1:41:09] Peter arose and went with
[1:41:11] them and when he was come they brought
[1:41:13] him into the upper chamber and all the
[1:41:15] widows stood by him weeping and showing
[1:41:17] the coats and garments which Dorcas made
[1:41:20] while she was with them church I want us
[1:41:22] to see now what an adoptive position
[1:41:24] sometimes look like she her you know
[1:41:26] because we talked about it's not always
[1:41:28] so
[1:41:29] spiritual there's roles within the body
[1:41:32] of Christ that aren't going to look
[1:41:34] spiritual to the outset and here we see
[1:41:36] one what Tabitha's Ministry was to was
[1:41:40] to make clothes for poor people she had
[1:41:43] an Outreach
[1:41:44] Ministry that was completely
[1:41:47] natural helping people stay warm helping
[1:41:50] people stay clothed that was her
[1:41:52] Ministry that was her position in the
[1:41:54] body of Christ was to be Outreach in
[1:41:56] that way and this before the foundation
[1:41:58] of the world was her position this is
[1:42:00] what God had ordained for her to do and
[1:42:02] she gave everything she had to that role
[1:42:04] and then God made her allowed her to be
[1:42:06] sick and then God allowed her life to be
[1:42:08] taken she dies doing exactly what God
[1:42:11] had told her to
[1:42:15] do she's presenting Christ in the way
[1:42:18] that she knows best that God has laid on
[1:42:20] her heart matching her abilities to the
[1:42:22] ministry and she's giving to all these
[1:42:23] people and when she dies all of them
[1:42:25] gather around and they're showing them
[1:42:27] look how good she was look what she did
[1:42:29] for us look at the difference she made
[1:42:31] we need her and because they needed her
[1:42:34] still they said bring
[1:42:36] Peter sometimes that's what we need as
[1:42:38] Believers that say we still got a need
[1:42:40] here let's step into the Gap
[1:42:43] here it says but Peter put them all
[1:42:46] forth and kneel down and prayed and
[1:42:48] turned him to the body and said Tabitha
[1:42:50] arise and she opened her eyes and when
[1:42:53] she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her
[1:42:55] his hand and lifted her up and when he
[1:42:57] had called the Saints and widows
[1:42:59] presented her alive and it was known
[1:43:02] throughout all of japa and many believed
[1:43:04] in the Lord church I'm trying to show
[1:43:06] you the power of being in your ordained
[1:43:08] position she was she was completely
[1:43:12] committed to the work of Christ in her
[1:43:14] life that ought to give us Faith this
[1:43:16] evening because Tabitha if you want to
[1:43:18] hear it this evening had a right to be
[1:43:20] resurrected the power of God was there
[1:43:23] to resurrect her because her work was
[1:43:25] not yet done and what did God do God had
[1:43:29] Believers there to believe and he had an
[1:43:31] apostle there with a gift to raise her
[1:43:33] an apostle with the authority to go
[1:43:35] before God and say God is it your will
[1:43:37] and if God says yes to have faith to
[1:43:38] raise that woman from the dead it wasn't
[1:43:41] happenstance that Peter just happened to
[1:43:42] be close by God had ordained these
[1:43:45] circumstances for his adopted daughter
[1:43:48] to let her continue in the work and in
[1:43:50] doing so she brought people to Christ
[1:43:54] her death and Resurrection brought
[1:43:57] people to
[1:43:58] Christ now we would sit back from that
[1:44:01] and say God why did you have to put her
[1:44:03] through
[1:44:04] suffering couldn't you have just struck
[1:44:06] her dead so she didn't have to suffer at
[1:44:08] least just let it be quick let it be
[1:44:10] merciful Let It Be painless but she had
[1:44:12] to go through pain and suffering despite
[1:44:15] being completely in her position why so
[1:44:17] that God could give her a testimony that
[1:44:19] was greater than her
[1:44:21] Works God was taking her way higher than
[1:44:25] anything she'd ever do on this Earth
[1:44:27] with a simple testimony that this is my
[1:44:30] daughter this is my child and nothing
[1:44:33] can hold her until I'm ready to let it
[1:44:36] touch her there's nothing that comes
[1:44:38] into our lives but God allows it now if
[1:44:41] we get out of his will we get out of his
[1:44:44] path that's going to be on us but
[1:44:46] nothing can stop us I'll read a quote
[1:44:49] later not tonight but in another service
[1:44:50] brother Braham says demons can do
[1:44:52] nothing to you except God God allows it
[1:44:54] because he holds Us in the palm of his
[1:44:56] hands God sent Peter all that way God
[1:44:58] timed it perfectly so that taba could
[1:45:00] have a resurrection testimony to go
[1:45:03] along with her adopted position is
[1:45:06] working with the the widows and the poor
[1:45:07] and these different
[1:45:09] things brother Bram says this he says
[1:45:12] it's those crucial hours that press us
[1:45:14] onto those sacred Sands it was in the
[1:45:17] Bible remember now no matter how great
[1:45:19] the distress is Satan cannot take your
[1:45:22] life until God God has finished with you
[1:45:24] nor can he hold you back nor can he keep
[1:45:27] you from achieving it he says there is
[1:45:29] nothing can happen to you unless God
[1:45:31] permits it there's no evil can come
[1:45:33] unless God permits it and it's for your
[1:45:36] good that he is working that he says
[1:45:38] let's think church we can look at our
[1:45:40] health we can look at our wealth we can
[1:45:41] look at our children our Ministries God
[1:45:44] can attack us or Satan can attack us and
[1:45:47] God himself has to allow it and if he
[1:45:50] does allow it it is temporary until
[1:45:53] God's done with us Satan can't lay hold
[1:45:55] on and hold something that belongs to
[1:45:57] God he says there when the floods came
[1:45:59] to destroy the world it could not
[1:46:01] destroy Noah Noah could not be destroyed
[1:46:03] because God had a work for him to do one
[1:46:06] day down in a great Nation Under a great
[1:46:08] bondage there were some great Hebrew
[1:46:10] children that we know as Shadrach and
[1:46:12] meach and Abednego and it came to a
[1:46:14] place where they had to make a decision
[1:46:16] that something had to be done their
[1:46:19] faith was put to a test he says now when
[1:46:21] your faith is put to a test test then
[1:46:24] don't fail stay right with what you
[1:46:26] believe see on the test the homework
[1:46:28] doesn't count for anything but the
[1:46:29] homework has been to prepare you for the
[1:46:31] test he's saying don't fail at the test
[1:46:34] cuz that's a pass or fail
[1:46:36] thing you got to make it past the test
[1:46:40] is what matters amen everything we've
[1:46:42] learned it's all brought us up to the
[1:46:43] test and he's saying when that test
[1:46:45] comes don't fall back now God's prepared
[1:46:48] you for it he says they went to a
[1:46:51] crucial hour not only did they go to an
[1:46:53] ash sheep they went to a fiery furnace
[1:46:55] but Satan could not destroy them for
[1:46:57] God's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled and
[1:47:00] when their faith was put to a test they
[1:47:02] could go in there with this hope that I
[1:47:04] know that my redeemer liveth they could
[1:47:06] go in there with this hope here we are
[1:47:08] assured that God is able to Deliver Us
[1:47:10] from this fiery furnace but nevertheless
[1:47:13] we will not bow to this image Satan he
[1:47:15] says could not take them he could not
[1:47:17] drown Noah in the flood until the
[1:47:19] purpose of God had been finished he
[1:47:21] could not burn up the Hebrew children
[1:47:23] until the purpose of God had been
[1:47:24] finished he could not kill job with
[1:47:26] boils and troubles until the purpose of
[1:47:28] God had been finished neither could the
[1:47:30] lions eat Daniel until God's purpose had
[1:47:32] been finished neither could death in old
[1:47:34] age take Abraham until the purpose of
[1:47:37] God has been finished God has a purpose
[1:47:40] and it will not be held
[1:47:42] back he says and neither can it take you
[1:47:46] or can it take me until the purpose of
[1:47:48] God of our life is finished he says so
[1:47:52] we gather from from their consolation
[1:47:54] what that what we're going through what
[1:47:56] we're dealing with has purpose and it's
[1:47:58] not going to keep us back from God it's
[1:48:00] not going to keep us back from his will
[1:48:02] it's not going to keep us back from his
[1:48:04] blessings he says why does God let
[1:48:06] troubles come this is the great
[1:48:09] answer why do bad things happen to good
[1:48:13] people he says God harnesses trouble
[1:48:16] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[1:48:19] him and those troubles bring us into a
[1:48:22] closer fellowship with God can you
[1:48:25] imagine how Tabitha felt after all this
[1:48:27] she goes through sickness she dies she's
[1:48:29] raised from the dead what confidence
[1:48:31] that ought to have given her that God is
[1:48:33] with her that she pleased God that she
[1:48:35] had a purpose in these things if God
[1:48:37] will do that for a woman that makes
[1:48:39] clothes for poor people what will he do
[1:48:41] to you sisters that are raising children
[1:48:43] that are elect of God what can hold us
[1:48:46] back from his purpose what can hold us
[1:48:47] back from achieving what he's laid in
[1:48:49] front of us to
[1:48:50] do what won't God do for
[1:48:53] you what won't God do for you if you're
[1:48:56] in his will and in his
[1:49:00] purpose what won't he do when you claim
[1:49:02] salvation for your children what won't
[1:49:04] you do when you claim leadership for how
[1:49:06] to raise each one they're all different
[1:49:08] we know that we don't raise any one of
[1:49:10] our kids the exact same way we need
[1:49:13] leadership we need guidance and we go to
[1:49:15] him and will he turn us down no he won't
[1:49:18] he will give us what we have need
[1:49:21] of that little woman she's probably just
[1:49:24] a a little single sister no husband no
[1:49:26] children just being faithful to her
[1:49:29] calling and God used that little woman
[1:49:30] to put a beating on Satan and show that
[1:49:34] the keys of death Hell In The Grave had
[1:49:35] no power over a child of his unless he
[1:49:37] allowed
[1:49:38] it can you imagine the service they had
[1:49:42] after
[1:49:45] that listen Abraham got a they got a new
[1:49:48] body and they got a child from a body
[1:49:50] that couldn't produce a body but we're
[1:49:52] talking the power of the Resurrection
[1:49:54] we're talking about the power of the
[1:49:55] Holy Ghost demonstrated in the greatest
[1:49:57] way possible to raise somebody from the
[1:50:02] dead where's our
[1:50:05] worship how we ought to be able to
[1:50:07] worship church when he gave you the Holy
[1:50:10] Ghost it was his sign that nothing can
[1:50:12] ever hold you
[1:50:13] back does he care does he care it seems
[1:50:18] so often that he doesn't care why
[1:50:20] because he doesn't do it in our timing
[1:50:23] or he doesn't do it in our
[1:50:25] way and sometimes it's moving right
[1:50:27] along and often times we may even miss
[1:50:29] his answer because we're too busy
[1:50:31] looking for
[1:50:32] ours we have to trust his choosing we
[1:50:35] have to trust his timing his planning
[1:50:37] his placing and we have to trust him
[1:50:38] when he holds things back I said earlier
[1:50:41] that that that that I I prayed for
[1:50:43] things and I'm still praying for things
[1:50:45] that he hasn't answered yet and I have
[1:50:47] to trust that he's got a reason for it
[1:50:49] I've got to trust that he's got a reason
[1:50:51] for it when things don't don't go the
[1:50:53] way that I
[1:50:54] think I think Hannah is a great example
[1:50:56] and I want to finish with her as we
[1:50:58] start to
[1:50:59] close if we look at Hannah's final words
[1:51:02] we see her attitude we see her worship
[1:51:04] we see her praise we see her mindset
[1:51:06] after she's gone through this she's gone
[1:51:07] through years who knows how many years
[1:51:09] maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe 20 years of
[1:51:12] persecution of of being apparently out
[1:51:14] of the favor of God but we see Santa
[1:51:17] step up here we really do and in 1st
[1:51:20] Samuel 2 I'm going to read it out of the
[1:51:21] Amplified
[1:51:23] this evening as we start to close it
[1:51:24] says Hannah prayed and said my heart
[1:51:27] exalts and triumphs in the Lord my
[1:51:29] strength is lifted up who in who the
[1:51:32] Lord my mouth is no longer silence for
[1:51:35] it is opened wide over my enemies
[1:51:37] because I rejoice in your salvation she
[1:51:39] is not praising herself she is praising
[1:51:42] him she can't stop talking about Look
[1:51:44] What the Lord Has Done in my life look
[1:51:46] what he did after all this time I
[1:51:48] thought I was out I thought I was out of
[1:51:50] his favor I thought i' made a mistake
[1:51:52] sake I thought he wasn't there but Look
[1:51:54] What the Lord Has Done in my
[1:51:56] life she says there is none holy like
[1:51:59] the Lord there's none beside you there
[1:52:01] is no Rock like our God she can't stop
[1:52:04] talking about him now she was full of
[1:52:06] bitterness before then he changes her
[1:52:09] attitude and now all she has is worship
[1:52:11] she says talk no more so very proudly
[1:52:14] let not arrogance go forth from your
[1:52:16] mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge
[1:52:18] and by him actions are
[1:52:20] weight oh you judged me you judge me you
[1:52:23] all judge me but look what the Lord says
[1:52:25] about me look how the Lord looks upon me
[1:52:28] church he understands Us in ways nobody
[1:52:31] else ever will and the things we do and
[1:52:34] sometimes we've got to stand and we've
[1:52:35] got to stand by our decisions we've got
[1:52:37] to stand by our leadership and people
[1:52:39] say what's going on why are you doing it
[1:52:42] that way stand there and Trust his
[1:52:45] leading he says let not arrogance go
[1:52:48] forth from your mouth for the Lord is a
[1:52:50] god of knowledge and by him action are
[1:52:52] way God proves all things he says the
[1:52:55] bows of the mighty are broken and those
[1:52:58] who stumbled are garded with strength
[1:53:00] the ones that had it all he says they've
[1:53:02] got no she says they have no power and
[1:53:04] the ones who stumbled they're GED
[1:53:06] they're bound
[1:53:07] up with
[1:53:10] strength those who were full have hired
[1:53:12] themselves out for bread those who had
[1:53:14] it all have to work just to get
[1:53:15] something to eat he says but those who
[1:53:18] were hungry have ceased to hunger the
[1:53:20] barren has borne seven but she who has
[1:53:22] many children languishes and is forlorn
[1:53:26] poor
[1:53:28] panina he says the Lord she said the
[1:53:30] Lord slays and makes alive he brings
[1:53:33] down to the ground and raises up the
[1:53:35] Lord makes poor and makes rich he brings
[1:53:37] low and he lifts up he raises up the
[1:53:40] poor Out of the Dust and lifts up the
[1:53:42] needy from the ash sheep to make them
[1:53:44] sit with Nobles and inherit the Throne
[1:53:47] of Glory for The Pillars of the Earth
[1:53:50] are the Lords and he has set the world
[1:53:52] upon upon them he will guard the feet of
[1:53:54] his Godly ones but the wicked shall be
[1:53:57] silenced and perished in darkness for by
[1:54:00] strength shall no man Prevail it's not
[1:54:02] going to be me gets me over this Finish
[1:54:04] Line church it's not going to be you
[1:54:05] gets you over there not your discipline
[1:54:07] not your good abilities not your good
[1:54:09] intentions not your church attendance
[1:54:11] these are all good things but it's by
[1:54:13] God's grace and his strength alone that
[1:54:15] we're going to get there he she says the
[1:54:17] adversaries of the Lord shall be broken
[1:54:19] to Pieces against them will he thunder
[1:54:22] in Heaven the Lord will judge all people
[1:54:24] to the ends of the Earth and he will
[1:54:26] give strength to his King and exalt the
[1:54:29] power of His
[1:54:32] anointed has he held back from you this
[1:54:34] evening
[1:54:37] church let me tell you he's got a plan
[1:54:39] in it all he's got a plan to bring a
[1:54:42] testimony he's got a plan to bring
[1:54:44] praise he's got a plan to bring Victory
[1:54:46] he's got a plan to raise you up out of
[1:54:48] the hash
[1:54:49] Heap and help you sit and inherit a
[1:54:51] throne of Glory
[1:54:56] Glory there's been times where I
[1:54:59] prayed and you get to the point where
[1:55:01] you
[1:55:03] cry I've
[1:55:05] cried been
[1:55:07] flustered even pull back at
[1:55:11] times you know why because I forgot that
[1:55:14] he's God and I'm not and it's that
[1:55:18] simple I've forgotten that there's a
[1:55:20] place for him and there's a place for
[1:55:22] for me and his is up here and mine is
[1:55:26] down here and if he calls me up it'll be
[1:55:29] by his grace and mercy to let me see if
[1:55:31] only for a moment what he's trying to do
[1:55:34] but in the meantime I've had to learn
[1:55:36] how to
[1:55:37] trust CU everything I see is so limited
[1:55:40] I am so limited by my own abilities by
[1:55:42] the the natural senses we have by
[1:55:45] discernment we think we have these
[1:55:46] different things and I've had to learn
[1:55:48] to trust him in his provision and in his
[1:55:49] timing and if he holds back it's for my
[1:55:52] good and if he gives it's for my good
[1:55:54] there's times I said before he's taken
[1:55:55] away things I thought that were so good
[1:55:57] for me and in the end it wasn't and it
[1:56:00] was for my good that he took it
[1:56:02] away things I thought were bad and he he
[1:56:05] kept them in my life church it's not my
[1:56:07] thinking it's not yours about them being
[1:56:08] good or bad that makes them that way
[1:56:10] it's the end result that'll show what's
[1:56:11] good or bad in our lives the Harvest
[1:56:13] will prove it out amen but God's been in
[1:56:16] it all along and I'll tell you I've had
[1:56:18] a I look at my life and I look at
[1:56:20] decisions and I look at things that come
[1:56:22] and gone
[1:56:24] and in the middle of it sometimes you
[1:56:27] wonder sometimes you wonder is it me or
[1:56:30] is it
[1:56:30] him and is he there or is he
[1:56:34] not but when it's all said and done and
[1:56:37] you let the Harvest come out you see God
[1:56:40] was in
[1:56:41] it and when you had to wait and when you
[1:56:43] had to pray and when you had to get
[1:56:45] closer and closer to him and you had to
[1:56:46] trust and you had to lay down your will
[1:56:48] and you had to lay down your desires and
[1:56:50] lay down your timing and lay down your
[1:56:52] need to understand everything that's
[1:56:54] when God tends to move is when we just
[1:56:57] get ourselves down and say Lord I'm
[1:56:58] going to let you be
[1:57:00] God I'm going to close with this as the
[1:57:02] musicians could
[1:57:04] come last scripture Psalm 8411 says for
[1:57:07] the Lord God is a sun and shield you
[1:57:11] know sometimes we need the sunshine we
[1:57:13] know all about this in New Finland don't
[1:57:14] we let's stand together we know about
[1:57:16] needing the sunshine you know I think
[1:57:18] we've had three days of sun in the last
[1:57:20] five or seven
[1:57:22] and you go outside and you're just like
[1:57:25] a because we've longed for this this
[1:57:29] shining
[1:57:30] orb to be obvious and clearly presented
[1:57:33] to us to just feel the warmth of that
[1:57:35] sun and he says the Lord God is a son
[1:57:39] but sometimes he's a shield sometimes
[1:57:41] he's a shade sometimes he's a protection
[1:57:43] sometimes we need to get in the sun we
[1:57:45] need to get out of our little basement
[1:57:47] you know I work from home most of the
[1:57:48] time I'm down in my basement and
[1:57:50] sometimes you just need to get outside
[1:57:52] and walk around a bit and it changes
[1:57:54] your attitude and sometimes that's what
[1:57:56] he is to us is he gets us out and he
[1:57:58] puts some life into us he invigorates us
[1:58:01] but sometimes he's a shield sometimes we
[1:58:03] need to pull back and just take a break
[1:58:06] go to Kil
[1:58:08] Mory just say no once or
[1:58:11] twice and say Lord I'm just I need a
[1:58:13] break Lord give me a rest under the
[1:58:16] promise of your word where I'm not
[1:58:18] trying I'm not pushing I'm not I'm not
[1:58:20] driving but I'm just resting and I'm
[1:58:23] trusting you to make it happen he says
[1:58:26] the Lord God is a son and a shield the
[1:58:28] Lord will give Grace and Glory no good
[1:58:32] thing will he withhold from them that
[1:58:36] walk
[1:58:38] uprightly not
[1:58:40] self-righteously uprightly where you say
[1:58:43] Lord I want to live by your word and I'm
[1:58:45] doing the best I can you do that he says
[1:58:48] there's nothing good that he'll withhold
[1:58:50] from you if he's holding it back for now
[1:58:53] it's for our good and when he pours it
[1:58:55] out it'll be for our good as well amen
[1:58:58] God knows exactly what we need God knows
[1:59:01] exactly what's good for us when we need
[1:59:03] it to produce his word perfectly in our
[1:59:04] lives we read that scripture that said
[1:59:07] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:59:10] ashamed let's bow our heads each
[1:59:15] one are you feeling disappointed this
[1:59:19] evening something you've laid before him
[1:59:23] and it seems like no answers come you've
[1:59:26] had all Faith given all
[1:59:29] testimony laid your life on the line
[1:59:31] laid your health on the line laid your
[1:59:33] job on the line laid your family on the
[1:59:35] line whatever it is it seems like he has
[1:59:38] an
[1:59:39] answered just a struggle after a
[1:59:41] struggle after a struggle after a
[1:59:47] struggle he cares
[1:59:49] church he cares
[1:59:53] all he's asking you to do is trust
[1:59:57] him Heavenly
[2:00:03] Father Lord you see our
[2:00:06] hearts you see our
[2:00:09] burdens Lord you see the
[2:00:12] ache not just in our heart but in our
[2:00:15] souls Lord when we see the needs around
[2:00:18] us Lord in our own lives in our own
[2:00:21] bodies in our own
[2:00:22] relationships Lord in our own children
[2:00:24] in this very Church Lord in our loved
[2:00:27] ones maybe with
[2:00:29] co-workers Lord and we look at your word
[2:00:32] and we apply it to the
[2:00:34] situation Lord but it doesn't always
[2:00:36] happen exactly as we think it
[2:00:39] will Lord and there's things I've been
[2:00:41] praying for for a long
[2:00:43] time lord there's things that people in
[2:00:46] this church have been holding to for
[2:00:48] days months years decades even

[2:01:06] keep talking to
[2:01:07] you Lord let our hope and expectation
[2:01:10] rise I pray Lord let it not dim but when
[2:01:14] it gets dim Lord may we come into that
[2:01:15] sunlight that you said you'd be Lord
[2:01:18] when it seems like it's bearing down on
[2:01:20] us too hard Lord may you be that Shield
[2:01:22] that we've just read about Lord but may
[2:01:24] we above all these things seek your
[2:01:26] presence Lord seek your perfect will
[2:01:30] Lord and find ourselves in it Lord and
[2:01:33] having found your will Lord let us rest
[2:01:35] in it let us hold fast Lord let us trust
