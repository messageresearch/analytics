[Applause] [Music] a mad trust for singing the revelation of what we're doing we're coming to him because we need him amen we need him every hour we need him every second amen it's not a moment but we need him and especially in this our brother we consider the scripture we consider the prophecy that Christ Himself spoke of this day this age old brother I tell you it's just it's just so I like in your heart and mind our need for his presence our need for his anointing on the inside of the inside and when he said and I've mentioned that many times and he said he said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved because there's going so deceiving the love of many wax cold and not completely gone but it's cold a man and he said to me and he said deceiving that beam to see and he went on went on he said it's gone it's gonna be so bad he said I don't shorten time to be no flesh saved that's pretty bad a man is getting worse and worse and worse so thank God brother for for his presence think offer his anointing thank God for his promise that he's gonna shorten time for the elects sake a man so I trust by the grace of God that were getting closer and closer and closer to the resurrection rapture a man than it was when the truly when the Prophet was here a man so he's gone on for a I said over fifty years but we trust by the grace of God not much longer and we'll be gone I trust will be gone not here to miss it but will be gone by the grace of God we need you every hour praise the Lord so the Lord bless you and praying the grace of God to be with our brother vice-chair as he comes up to do part two of his testimony amen and it was good to what he brought out on Sunday concerning what was going on in India and it helped us to better understand you know the situation in India and not only are our brothers circumstances and what he endured and what he experienced but what believers are enduring there now and what believers are dealing with now in India a man so brother considering what our brother said on Sunday the spray for the brothers and sisters in India a man and the grace of God be with them and again we're praying the grace of God be with him to stay in line with the word and not to not to as I know that some AB done unfortunately that they have they have really gotten into fanaticism message some went certain message believers when we pray the grace of God to deliver him a man because that's the spirit of the devil and brother and it is not it not this teaching or this teaching that the Prophet taught himself that's going to bring reproach on the message sometimes it's what those believers so-called believers are teaching it's what those so-called believers are doing and how they do it what they say and how they say it'll bring reproach on the word so we pray the grace of God to the believers in India amen so let's just be in prayer for them but don't don't just say well there that's believers in me in India they're doing fine no no they're being tested brother and our brother by so I'm sure is aware of it and he knows what we're what I'm referring to amen so the grace of God and and I've been in contact a number of times with with the voice of God representative in India so we pray the grace of God to him because it's not his faith is being challenged but again is his determination to hold things you know steady to hold things in the middle of the road a man it's a challenge to our brothers we pray the grace of God to that brother of the voice of God in India and I said not maybe a few years ago that our brother the Lord took our brother's wife home that was a that was a real heart for the brother to deal with a man so we breathe pray grace to our brother the Lord continue to sustain him amen so we want to eventually turn it to our brother Michael amen and to bring into more and more understanding to us concerning what God did in getting him out of India and I said to put laughs a man out of one India to another one a man so again you know God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform for me it is it is mysterious for God to do this in Newfoundland for God to do that and new for life and not only that you know after all that we've done by the grace of God through the homepages and the the ministry that we've sent overseas and the pamphlets and the booklets and the pictures and everything and yet when I remember when I went to went into a certain place in the States there through three years ago and met number believers were you from Newfoundland where's that they didn't know where they didn't know where new tonight was a man but the Lord has somebody there to who to inform them of where it was somebody else may be overheard they said don't know where Newfoundland is no didn't know a number of people but again others knew and again it's not because of they were familiar with geography and the maps and all of that but again what God has been doing in Newfoundland amen so we give God the glory brother amen give God the glory and will not take that glory to ourselves you know because again that this is known around the world that's known around the world but we give the glory to God we did it for him amen the glory of what he had and what Gloria what doing amen so to God be the glory and so thank God for bringing our mother vital all the way from India and to Newfoundland and to give us the testimony that he gave us on Sunday to give us a greater understanding of what what get the individuals in India are dealing with a man what he dealt with and yet in at all God brought them to the truth by the grace of God and again God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and it is a wonder definitely a wonder why God did this and why God did that so the Lord blessed our brother when he comes to give us his testimony and I'll just say that I heard for brother brother John Kadesh in Ottawa and being prayer for him he is looking for another church somewhere in order in Ottawa he did attend one on Sunday but he's looking for another one so we pray the grace of God to give him the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and because our brother can pour out a right spirit a right attitude message anointing by the grace of God so we thank the Lord for the for the inflow this Assembly has been on our brother amen and may it continue with him and also he also informed me that he did hear our brother voice will give his testimony on Sunday and he said he enjoyed it it was a blessing so that's good god bless our brother John a man and granting the leadership of the Holy Ghost brought by the great and also there's no more information about the Fulcher we're still waiting on more information regarding about the fortune we leave it with the Lord and committed compact what our brother in in god James amen as I said I wrote I will always remember my fellowship with brother Folger amen and a good spirit a right attitude it's good I appreciate he was he was quite what trying to call it humorous and I remember one time when he came here to do for lion and that's 1985 I believe ready for and they were delayed in Ontario and for finally they did get a flight and I said well I said well that's good you went there at the right you know you went and got that flight wonderful I said and well he said if I if I didn't go over there when I did he said I would have missed it no I said you would I said that was that was the leadership of the Holy Ghost God did God cost you to do that amen he was he was he was wound up because he had missed a first flight and he thought he would miss the second one I said no brother I said that was the Lord and sister function was there yes she's your brother I agree with you a man a man so we have nice fellowship with our brother Fulcher and of course he ministered for us here as well and it was in Empire Avenue Church and I remember that we did have a certain brother here ministry at the time too and we had four or five against preachers in the full end of its audience and the one brother city was only going to be certain two-minute allowance amount of time and so he went on and on and on and on well he got her he got a reminder and it was brother fortune well the Folger spoke up the little know how much time he had left amen amen so thank God for our brother that had such a spirit and such an attitude a man and believers were welcome I'm sure in brother vultures assembly so god bless him and God bless the assembly and god bless our brother Barry and sister for our sister Becky rather as they deal with the issue right now that maybe our brother Fulcher is getting closer to home amen by the grace of God amen so Lord and liquidus but this being prayer that God would be with them amen also to remind you that on Friday our brother vice will be going to Ontario he's going to Ontario and there's a couple of friends there that he wanted to meet and fellowship with and so we pray the grace of God to bless him amen any spirit in his soul that he'll be a living witness a living testimony amen to his friends so bless you turn with me to Matthew chapter 13 Matthew 13 hi not short of our brother read it from here yes on Sunday and what I was thinking about when they went our brother read it of course I've got notes here in my Bible too and concerning the the parables and and with seven parables but it's represents the seven church ages amen and we're going to read the mystery of the seventh age in Matthew 13 and verse 47 thank God rather for the word thank God for the understanding of the word this is tremendous praise the name of the Lord brother again like I said this is just a religious book to a lot of people it's just a Bible or you know that's God's Bible that's God's book but they have so little understanding of the planned purpose and pattern they know this in the Bible they know that's in the Bible and but they wonder what they're lacking is understanding amen they might have wisdom but since we've got wisdom get understanding you know you got you know this you know this you know this and it's in the Bible but do you understand it what what it what is the plan what is the what part is it in the plan what part is it in the purpose of God and the pattern of God most don't don't recognize it but I thank God but I really do thank God for the message of the hour through a prophet that I lights us regarding the plan of God and pattern of God and the purpose of God amen and that's why that's why we have the understanding that we have from Genesis to Revelation to the God be the glory and brother again in Matthew chapter 13 to most is just parables but and God diggy the Jesus is comparing the kingdom of God this way or this way or that way yeah but it represents prophecy down through seven ages and in verse 47 concerning the seventh mystery and he said again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the band away this is the our living a separation a man and it says so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from the just among the just God's gonna totally separate a man is elect onto himself sever severing the wicked from among them and shall cast them into the furnace of fire and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto them and he understood a man all these things praise the Lord for understanding and they say unto Him yay Lord and then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed under the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old and that's what God brought forth out of the treasure in these last days the mystery of the seven seals a man the seven full mystery of God to reveal to the bride to give the bride the resurrection and the rapturing faith by the grace of God a man thank God for the revelation of the parables thank God for the understanding of the parables not just stories not just a little lesson here a little lesson there no it's revelation of the mystery of God his revelation of the plan of God the purpose of God and the pattern of God to God be the glory amen we're going to turn to our brother vice show this stand and saying only believe all things are possible only believe to God be the glory amen [Music] only Bailey oh oh Ranger possible only be Lee only be hallelujah Oh Oh Ranger possible only Jesus is here Jesus [Music] Jesus Jesus hallelujah race alert lorry all things are possible [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] Hey [Music] just had a record of prayer dear God thank you Lord for bringing us here Lord thank you Lord for the anointing that you have given us Lord we welcome your presence Lord and Lord we pray for through this testimony Lord glorify your name Lord use this law to your glory Lord Lord I pray Lord help me Lord help me to get out of your way Lord and help me help help me Lord to let you have your way with me lord I pray for your grace Lord I pray for help your strength Lord be with us Lord in Jesus name sir it's really good what brother Gerald mentioned like about the believers in India like it's it's like here also believers are like facing persecution it's not nothing different it's just the nature of persecution here it's like as a whole people know Christianity they know Bible they know different things about the Bible but at the same time they don't want the name of God to be mentioned whereas when you go back to India it's a different persecution like they don't know about Bible they don't know who is Jesus it's more of the religious conflict that is going on and persecution at times can be so bad like not that I believe it would be a decade or two decades ago like a missionary family was burned alive like in a village and there was recently I read an incident I mean like a year or two before like there was a pastor and there like the people in that village like they just beat him up they broke the church and then they it's just different things were done unto him and they put him on a donkey took him around the city and it was just a lot of disgraceful things were done to him and just a few examples like there are many many more things on so but it's a religious conflict it's it's more like it's a more of like a communist mentality within the religions not as a whole country alright so coming to like my testimony so lastly like close up on like you know about coming to Newfoundland so like when I keep before I came to Newfoundland I went on the internet and I searched Pentecostal church in Newfoundland that's all I knew about I didn't have like a full ideals of what what a Pentecostal church means and as I mentioned last time there were two things that came up one was the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland and second was the church where I came to and on the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland I mentioned that there were five nearly 500 Pentecostal churches in Newfoundland so like 100-person I was excited like I was like this is the place where I'm meant to be and this is it like this is my moment like I'm gonna grow like this is what I was thirsting for and if I look at the timeline like I was eight months I think yeah eight months into as a new believer and like trying like as a new believer you're really excited to grow and it's a different level of I guess and passion at that time but there was not really any maturity that had happened in me it was it was a growth phase but there was no maturity and that's when I came to Newfoundland and to God's grace like I think I landed here on Saturday and the very next day I went to the church that I saw on the link and this was my initial experience like initially like the first couple of weeks I was really good like really I'm enjoying it I like the worship and everything is going really really good but this is the testimony of like I would say what happens to a church when it tries to identify with the world that's what this testimony will be about and I just wanted to go back like to my last Sunday's testimony which this is an apology i io which is like I was not intending to like go into teaching but I just somehow went here and there but for me the biggest miracle for me it has been like coming out of the spiritual darkness and it's just the different stages of darkness that God brought me out from and that's what exactly what I wanted to bring out through my testimony which is what was that spiritual darkness and in India I've experienced the spiritual darkness in terms of religion or in terms of atheism or being an agnostic but when I came to Newfoundland here that's when I started facing like a different kind of Darkness and this is exactly like I was trying to I was really praying to God like how can I convey what what did I come through and it's like I don't I I cannot take back to people like into those days and show them what I was going through that's when he actually brought the example of the water and it's it so nicely gets into it is like this is exactly how it was like I didn't add anything today I just brought it as it is but on that day like there was like one cough was just a boiled water like I had boiled it to like an extreme extent like where I had taken out everything from it and for me that was a representation of like my time Adam at a Methodist Church and also like what I was experiencing some things in my own life when I became regimented about things when other glass had like a sugar water in it and that was like just again a delusion from an emotional gospel and the third glass had like a salted water and it all looked same but that's exactly the deceit that I came out of and now that's what I'm gonna lead who is like what that deceit looks like and then I'm just gonna bring it back why again I use the example of water in it yeah so like when I came here like I came to a Pentecostal church and that church had been he for like now almost I believe like 40 or 50 years it has been here and it had like a very great like like a social standing very great name and it could theoretically you cannot find anything wrong about it like you try to look into the doctrines that they have listed on their website or everything that they stand for there is nothing wrong into it it will all go and meet the Bible but it's exactly where the deceit is going to be before I go into like some of the symptoms that I like came through at the church like I first go into how much I started getting involved with the church so this is something that I knew when I was in India that as a Christians we are meant to serve but at the same time I didn't have God's leadership on like what it means to serve I had my own understanding what I need to do as I serve and I was reading I was trying to read a lot trying to understand about different types like you know just different aspects of Christianity and I just wanted to serve that that's I really in my heart but at the same time when God's will is taken out of serving it really creates a big chaos and you will never find peace like that something no matter how much I served I could never find peace and it all actually the worst part was like when I stopped doing it that's when I found peace and there was like it was it is the truth and like one thing okay I'll just when it came to serving so like when I came to church I was like I believe it was the first or second week I set up a meeting with the pastor I'm like what can I do how many areas can I get into and they said okay this is all that is going I'm like okay I'm going in each and every one of them and it's like only those things which I cannot meet according to my schedule those are the only ones that I will skip and sad part was like I didn't hear back for a while so I was like okay what's going on so I went again and I started following up like okay when can I start when can I start and the first thing that I started was with a small group Bible study that we were having like a youth group that was happening here evict and there was later on I started going to like this that's so very good actually what they're doing it happens at the Eastern held once in a month and they go and pray for the elders and they have like hold a service there third thing I got into was like what we called as the conversation cafe so in conversation cafe you have a lot of refugee immigrants coming here like from embalm Sudan Uganda it could be from a multiple different country so the whole point of conversation cafe was to help them with English and I mean I just more like helped them to get integrated into the society here the I started going to a second Bible study along with the first one and that was the most interesting one because they're the lowest average age of that group was seventy years like it was that and above and I was the lowest one after that and I actually knew like an elder couple in the church and they would have been really close to me and through them I came to that I was ready group but surprisingly by coming to that group it really opened to me the Pentecostal history of Newfoundland because they were the witnesses of that time over here and there were people who were in their 90's and they were still coming but the knew the full history of Newfoundland and the other part was like for me that was really striking the knew the history of the church I was going to because they were there with Thatcher since the foundation so they have seen that sure starting from a real Pentecostal revival and going into the complete like a charismatic worldly Church so that's why that group had been a real blessing to me then I was also doing like morning coffee like preparing for the service there were some more things that that are going on so my thought now this is my intellectual thought is like I'm gonna like I'm gonna really really grow into the world by doing everything that I was doing and so like this was the involvement with the church but at the same time I started like seeing different things at the church like I spent nearly I believe at least one and a half years at that church and that's when I like you know came back to the example of the glass less like just imagine if this sugar or like like a salted water what would happen if you drink like just one or two glasses of it you won't feel anything there's nothing that would go wrong in your body but now just imagine you're drinking it for a whole 1 and 1/2 year it will just create a full chaos in your system and also like you will feel like you're walking in a desert and you'll be thirsting for real water like where can I find real water and that's exactly what I was looking for is like where can I get any real water because I was feeling thirsty like it's a like in a literal sense I was feeling thirsty I could never feel satisfied I was just never at peace why was that like why was that sure even after trying to serve this much why I could not feel like that so just starting with the leadership of the church first of all in the leadership of the church there was system there was organization but at the same time there was no scriptural order in it it was all man-made ideas of hierarchy of like communities and there is no godly leadership even within the leaders and the leaders were also not seeking the will of God it was more like what what is what it means the government criterias how it should be managed really like it was more like trying to run an organization then trying to lead a church and what happens is that is like when they don't have the Holy Ghost leading in them and they try to run a church with their own ideas the first thing they will do is like squeeze out the spirit out of the church by itself and that's not how the church began when the when I can I started I started investigating is like has discharged in like forever when I went back and I just asked like the initial leadership of the church like when they were really filled with the Holy Ghost the choice was in a revival they actually brought a revival within Newfoundland to in Bell Island at different places but at the same time when the leadership started changing over the years and with the current leadership first of all with with all like loving grace and all they have women preachers and like they have with the women preachers they are like perfectly as worldly preachers as I can imagine and I would even say like even in the women preachers but not only that but they were even leading their own homes so like there was not even that understanding of what we say is like man is the you know the woman and Christ is the head of the man so first of all that's here's here's a direct fall out of the scriptures and in terms of makeup like I mean I I'd never like I spoken against it or anything much about it but like when I look back now I can see like why I was feeling uncomfortable the way I was feeling uncomfortable it was like it was like a painting that means they were putting on before preaching is like whatever is going on like and like it's just there was even way more like with like even like the man like I haven't spoken much on like dressing sense and all but it it was as worldly as I can imagine like I mean it was just and they're preaching now so it's that's not what that's that's that you can like that was like okay indication to me that this is very worldly now going to do like the lead the head pastor like first of all he was not at all like integrated with the people no interest at all and that was a big shock to me like I was felt like as if like somebody gave like a punch on my heart because when I was in India like that was the biggest support that I had like the church was really big but at the same time like I would always like could have a conversation with my pastor he would have time like to Italy have a were denied I knew who he is he knew who I am and here I barely ever spoke to him like in one and a half years and he knew my name but that's all and he didn't care at all is like whether anybody is interested in having a conversation or not all the counseling was also not like a scriptural counseling it was a psychological counseling and that also doesn't do any good like it's and then you have like a communications pastor who is responsible for engaging people you have a youth pastor you have a young adult pastor you have a worship pastor you have teens pastor and then you have all the leaders under them it's like it could be as hard article as I can imagine and you cannot go to the second year without speaking with the lower tier like it was it was exactly like that if I go to like anybody like a higher ok did you speak with this person like reporting to that person and then I go and speak with that person and only if need be he'll direct me to that higher authority so it's like for me there was like was a big shock like I never saw that before in my life and in some way it was a reflection of a Hindu temple too because you know were in temples also we had this hierarchy's that's about leadership and there was another thing which really like scared me about the leadership which was a fear there was a tremendous amount of fear in the leadership they were afraid of like taking a stance for the word they were really afraid of displeasing the people and I got this comments often like when I used to go and like ask them you know like why don't you preach against this or why don't you preach about that or like so this is what I was getting the feedback is like the preaching has to be according to your group of people here and it was like like again now it sounds like ok is it related discernment or is it like no it was more what they were trying to like it needs to be pleasant for the audience and it needs to be exciting and like it would be diluted up to such an extent like just what I said about the boiled water there is no nutrition left in it and all you would try to keep preaching about is like Jesus died on the cross and we got saved and it's like let's say Easter is coming then there will be a full planning there will be actual schedule of like for the next like 20 or 30 weeks like this is exactly how we are going to preach about and leading up to the Easter and how God got Rosetta it would be like diluted diluted diluted like even more diluted and as soon as Easter is over there will be a gap and then preaching for the Christmas and it's the same cycle it would keep going on again and again and I remember like this really struck me when I came actually first day here I'll never forget that image out of my head when brother Andre was here and that was my first day when I came and it was his last day of preaching here he said this you know that people keep revolving around faith grace faith grace faith grace hope they will keep going around that like and that that really struck me at that moment because that day was still going to that church and I came here and he's saying the exact same thing that I've been trying to like convince people on that it's really wrong to keep revolving around this topics again and again again and again and even they were not going in the depths of it it was like just on a such a surface level that there was no real word moving like now moving like out from the leadership like now how the congregation was like now in the congregation like there was no understanding of Bible at all and you know like we often hear this phrase like that there are three types of believers that believers make believers and non-believers and I would say like maybe like more than half of the church was filled with the make believers because I knew them outside the church too and I had spent enough time that I could see that okay this is a make belief system they were non-believers and personally no it's a very personal belief like I can deal with a non-believer but not a make believer because they don't stand for anything and it's it's a really a dry place like when it becomes like a make belief system and give some examples of like how big the make belief system was there so now you have all these ministries but now just cash they start now the purpose of any ministry is to glorify Jesus Christ and that was the exact thing that was missing from all the ministries so like when you go to like the conversation cafe it is about English I understand but at the same time don't know do it in the name of the church just just don't put it under than any under the name of Christ that you're doing it for the glory of Christ and secondly if you're doing it still there needs to be an element of Jesus in it like you can still work it out and I understand cannot do it with the King James Version but there are still different ways to do it like you have scriptural doc books like be written about the Bible at least you can use them to read out to the kids like if you want to teach them English but you need to have an element of Jesus in it taking about the Bible studies and all I never remember like my our Bible study going beyond like like Jesus Christ coming and dying for us that's where our Bible studies always stayed at and it would start like okay what is the importance of prayer what is the importance of evangelization what is the importance of reading the word and then the fifth last closing would be like okay so Jesus Christ pain he saved us again the same series we are going again and again and all these Bible studies were also now just a minute such a you church like maybe it is 15 or 20 groups are doing it and it's all being centrally governed by them by the lead leading management in the church this is exactly what the Bible study will be or this is exactly the questions that will be discussed music how can the Holy Ghost have a move it's never like a one fit for all system with when it comes to Jesus and it's exactly what they were doing with all the Bible studies is like just the same circle and that will keep going on like you have this series going in like September then you will have it again in January you will have it again in September so say there is no moving us forward like this nothing there now like now this is the church trying to identify with the world and they are they like you know it became so deceitful like exactly like this waters nice like is it a community center is it a not-for-profit organization or is it a church I don't know it I sort i started accepting later on like midway which is like it's a not-for-profit organization and we come to talk about jesus between 9:00 to 11:00 on a Sunday that's what exactly became it became for me it's like that's what it is all right III just God's move like I actually told two people that this is what exactly this church has become now and I did feel like a crazy person for a while because I was going to people like and like I'm telling them that I still remember like there was one I worked for the full night at the Irving gas station the next day morning I went to the church from church like a family invited me for lunch and I was definitely out of my mind like I was working for the full night and it's like I went to church and I'm going to a lunch and I strongly I'm like for half-hour I was like going on and on but like how this church is diluted it's like and everybody was agreeing with me but nobody was ready to do anything about it I was like and that became pretty much my whole schedule like every second or third Bible say I would be going on like how crazy it is how the Spirit has left there's no talk about the Holy Ghost there was no talk about Revelation I don't ever remember talking about the importance of Revelation this was another thing to God's grace and that's where I started looking back to predestination when I came here I always ask them when are we going to talk about the future of the rapture or like the like the Book of Revelations are we going to open it or not like we are always going back to just specific books but we never went to the Book of Revelations so it's like you're taking only half of the Bible and this is the biggest struggle because again it's not scripturally wrong it's all like theoretically it all meets the Bible but at the same time there is no Holocaust how it impacted the people like now the youth they had no understanding of Jesus at all like young adults like I would see like this was a shot like again I I know it shouldn't be a shock but when I came here and I saw like okay there is a godly like like a choir there is a godly like worshiping service happening here there is a huge like a breeder for me because there I could see like people leading on the stage and I had seen them outside the church and they could be again like as worldly as I can imagine and there they are leading the song service I'm like I'm seeing them outside the church in university they're going on a Sunday to a church that happens in a pub on Sunday nights I'm like they go there on Sundays in the evening and then they're worshiping and Sunday morning here they are leading it's like what double standards there are like so it went up to that bad extent that I later I started finding that people are in live in relationships in the church there were like like there was like someone who had child before like marriage at a very young age and there were people like you can see all these things happening inside the church because now it's again the mistake of church because they try to identify with the world so the world now entered into the church there was like even like when I went to the scriptural order like when I used to talk them what assure and all like they made it into full volunteer positions anybody can come and anybody can become a deacon anybody can become because it's all volunteer positions and you get certificates for doing all that and come when it come like coming to the service like the service became was like really like a nine to eleven service like it would be so regimented services like I could actually see on my cloth like I it went so bad like I started skipping the worshiping services like I wouldn't even go the in there I'll be outside just doing my stuff and like because like the first struggle that I started having with the worship service like it'll be a lot of like audio driven like it would be a lot of emphasis on like the technology and like adding artificial sounds to it and like how all the you know like instruments are happening you can't at times it would be even so loud that you cannot even hear what what is being sung so it's like I could easily feel that they are trying to attack my emotions but it's not anything moving in my spirit I I don't even like in India it would be a very spirit full worship service because it was never about the instruments or anything just sing and Derick I remember like crying in a worship service in a Methodist Church while in the worship service I could feel the presence of Holy Ghost like really high and here I'm in a Pentecostal church and I barely feel anything in the worship service so like there was again a chaos like it was driving me crazy so I just stopped going in there and when it comes came to the service like dude instead of like trying to be on the scriptures they would try to give all the worldly examples try to bring like jokes to it like - like explain the Scriptures I'm like have you mad like you don't play with the scriptures like you just understand the seriousness of it anyway like so like so understand under like congregation like no I I was quite involved with the church but the paradox is I didn't know anyone at the church I knew them at their face as I knew them by their names but except two people I had never had any fellowship with anyone at the church and there were people who I'd be meeting like almost every week but we barely knew each other this another shocking moment happens like the Bible study that I was going into there was a person who had been going to that Bible study for like a number of years and after I started having conversation and I started getting people to even talk with each other people started getting shots about each other oh this was in your life oh this was in your life you've been here for like a couple of years together it's like and you don't know each other you don't know even like that what's happening in each other's families like I'm not saying into the personal stuff but at least on a broad level like if anybody's family is facing difficulty like one person's father he he will he had been to prison for a different reason and nobody even knew about it it's like you don't even pray for each other you have no ideas why are you even having this Bible studies once I ran into a worse conflict in that Bible story which was like somebody actually posted a group like a discussion about like inclusion and diversity and all like this which ours grew and the biggest shocker for music that person new to scriptures like back of the hand like person could find scriptures of you name and she could find that and here she's inviting people to that roundtable discussion I just immediately went into the link because I was leading the group so it was my responsibility to make sure that I protect it by any means and I just went into the link I saw on Facebook and the first thing I see in that picture was a pride flag I'm like what's the deal here so I just wrote wrote on the group like okay with genders are you actually talking about in terms of inclusivity and diversity I just put this question I didn't want to blame so I just put the question on I get I got back the how does that matter I'm like it perfectly matters to me this is what I saw and this is what I don't want people to get into it's not gonna happen and the verse was like some people had orderly agreed to like participate in that and even recently I found like one of the person again who was related to our group I she was in she's in Ontario or somewhere Alberta and she actually went into the Pride Parade I was like how bad it can get like it's like there is no one's choice she's not taking a stand so that's what exactly this corruption was sitting inside the church there's another thing that really drove me crazy was I saw Halloween inside the church I had like pumpkins and they had decorations and they're this was their rationale when I started reaching out to people against it that it's better to have the people coming over here into the church than going out into the society that's why we try to have something in between like what is in between like that's what the exact make believer stuff is so I was like there was another discussion where's like I'm sitting here like there are eight to ten people and they're trying to debate with me that it's okay to have one or two glasses of alcohol it's okay to have beer is scriptural that little is fine and like I'm like and it went so bad that for a moment it went it makes me feel like okay maybe I'm not getting the scriptures correctly maybe it's me who is not trying to who is being too regimented about the Bible like I mean everybody saying that there they are born into Christian families they are reading Bible for years maybe it's me so like I started dance like ice I stop like okay it's trying to like fight against it or like maybe I need to go back into Bible and I I didn't identify with it where like maybe I'll go back and see what the truth is for me and the truth was still the same that it's all wrong but the same time I stopped fighting against it like because I was all exhausted by then there was nothing moving I just keep getting worse and worse and what when I reached out to the head pastor about the heroines I was like white I just wrote why the hell are celebrating Halloween inside church he didn't reply back to me I'm like anyways like is this her like there is more stuff going on like I knew about the politics that's going on in the church there was financial corruption was just I don't have any proofs against it I just knew through some people and it's like I it was going on like I just buy this elder groups and all that I was participating in that's how I started coming to know is like what's going on in the background of the church they would like try to send evangelist and all just yeah like I mean to sum it all like this this is exactly what happens when a church tries to identify with the world and just to like you like you know if I have to break it down into like two parts like so if I go back to like the sugar water so that's where I look at it as like the prosperity gospel when it's being like the sugary emotion picture about Jesus there's no understanding of what a Christian persecution means what it means to take a stand and said exactly what the church was doing I was all like that that's what I would classify it like a diluted Pentecostal Church and when I look at from the salt water so here's the example that I would give like this is this this was again like a big blow to me like really big blow there was one day they organized in the church again that time I was really excited about serving so they are like okay we are gonna go to some different schools like the McDonald tri school there were some other schools and you know we are going to clean their pain there and yes the day will be about serving I was excited I was like you know at least there is some brightness in this darkness like something at least they are trying to do so soon I come to find out that they are going to do it only for one day okay I'm like okay at least one day then again I ran into an uncomfortable situation while I was there because they asked me to interview and I was not expecting that and I denied it at the beginning but they knew I was participating in different stuff so they're convinced I got convinced said okay I'm gonna interview again my thought was they're gonna just play it in the service for the people like you know just just what happened in the ministry but later on like from people like through some professional relations they started coming back to me that you are on TV this is going to the chair like go into this shirt my friend I'm like how do you know about it then it's like that there are advertisements on the television going on okay I'm like now I get it what was all that day was about they just wanted to create some video materials and then they were running advertisements like across the year like those advertisements were not stopping and there was a whole purpose of that serving which was to advertise and like and every service they would keep showing her and that never happened again that's serving that never happened again so it was very clear what was the objective which was like was to market the church and when they started doing that there were some another parallel stuffs ika started coming to know about they actually started keeping like analytics on the church what are the church growth numbers going on how far we want to grow how much we should expand the building to accommodate more people what is the growth you're on your growth we are looking at and they even started keeping analytics on the Bible studies like have an attendance how many people are attending and what is the mixer like and like really like that's not how the holy ghost works like it's it's not possible in it's like so that's what I started viewing is like a worldly like a charismatic Pentecostal Church where it's just all about the numbers it's a community center it's no more a church now and I I remember I think brother Gerald or somebody from the visiting ministry said that when it really struck me they say that in future someday it will go that bad that they will try so much to identify with the world that they will even stop writing it as a church but they might write it as a community center and it's already happening I think when coming to Paradise I saw like a spruce community center shirt so like and Bethesda is also like now trying to take out certain things and you know try to look more as a neutral Church so like just to like sum it up on this testimonial like by the time like I said initially here I started with a real passion real you know like expectation that I'm gonna grow into a Pentecostal church it's gonna be a revival for me instead I was served like the deceitful water and at the end of the one and half year I was almost on a nervous breakdown because of all this I mean I was continuing my education finish what I need to do and I shouldn't say this but like this accept it with grace we're like this is where I started coming to understanding like there's nothing that good that any good can come out of this place like this place is like just completely gone like I have to move out of the place otherwise like my Christian life will be lost like I would I would have nothing that I can identify with like that was the level I I came to the conclusion at the end is like finish my studies and find a church somewhere and even though I remember like up to that X when I was in or I was in a more that maybe if Lord brings me back to the church in India I'm willing to accept that because at least there was some Holy Ghost movement there it was not a Pentecostal Church but there was some spirit there it is there was no corruption like there was no worldliness like I want to be debating with people like okay whether there should be Halloween or not in a church yeah so like that's that's the whole picture of like whoa that's this is the exact seed that I really wanted to plant like so in the first part of the testimony I just wanted to show like what different religions and what all like can do to us and like how meaningless they are or how flat there and today's this part of the testimony I just wanted to share like what delusion or worldliness can do to a church I saw nothing new it's all brother branham has like said about you read it in the church age book he's trying to blast it and this is the reason like I've lived it why he's criticizing it so that's that coming to our church like as I came like I mean I have testified about that often and like I still say this is like when I came here like the first day when I listened I fellowship with the like a de jure with the church to after the service and that's what I felt is like this is what I say it like okay this church is trying to go towards a book of facts I'm getting that feeling is like I nobody had mentioned to me but this is where you know that that was like God's convictions like number one I was asking God like God is it the place where you want me to be and that's where I asked God is like give me an experience that gives me a confirmation that this is where you want me to be and I was still swinging back I was going there I was coming here going there coming here so like this was my first conviction is like okay I feel the Holy Ghost moving here people really want to like consecration there is a thirst for Jesus we're not perfect but there is a thirst for Jesus I'm like people are opening the book of Revelation like that's what I was looking was like anybody gonna look towards the future the rapture and he's like okay well that's that's the main topic to talk about so I said I say there was another confirmation from his like okay keep going just so like now like when I came to the messages like so then I came the biggest initially the days I was struggle I was having was like you know I had never heard about there being any prophet this is what I was conditioned to like when I left India as I came out of all the religions is like Hinduism is centered all around like gurus and Saints and also this I fixated like since my childhood I had hammered like I'm never gonna believe on people that's never gonna happen like I'm done with this stuff from India and this is big again I was not denying or criticizing what brother Branham is preaching but it was now like my own conflict with my own selves like I have to fight with what I know and what I stood for and what helped me to come out of Hinduism or will come out of all the things and now it's like okay here's the confusions like is the message around the Bible is there is a presence of Bible or am I trying to follow brother branham am i accepting him for exactly what he's saying or what was the scriptural basis of all that so that that's what exactly I started having the struggle another struggle for me that I started facing was like I'll be honest at the starting it will it was about the baptism because now I'm trying to fight a scripture with a scripture because my struggle was here Jesus is saying like I think in Matthews that you know be baptized in the name of the son the father and the Holy Ghost and I'm like there is a scripture in the book of Acts to where it's saying be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ so I'm like here's once scripture here's another scripture so how do I choose between the scriptures and you from Bible is the Word of God how can I deny God's Word and that's where my real struggle began is like was okay all this needs more deeper exploration so but again this is one mistake I did and this is what I had to step out of which was like again I try to seek it intellectually started going into like different literature trying to find more evidence he's trying to escape again it started driving me I'm like okay I need to close this stuff Park it aside and just keep praying keep reading my Bible and keep praying and stick slowly and slowly lot started working miracles went and brother Jonah law said but when we were in Calgary like there was a miraculous trip for me like a lot of things happen on that trip like it was all like again very subtle miracles but they were big for me and when I came to like you know just just meeting with the believers and meeting I I could truly see in our church there is a passion for Bible there is a passion for Jesus and that's what our choice but you know my question was like is is the ministry as a whole focusing on that like is the message ministry as a whole going back to that and when I may met more people I met like more likely like pastors and all that was a confirmation for me that okay it's not just at our church but it says the ministry as a whole is is about the Bible and that's that that's that's you know there was enough for me then there was another like I when I got more awareness of like why am i rejecting like we're not rejecting but I'm having this struggle to even accept the message or read the message which was because I was still living in like the burns of the Indian environment and that's the exact reason why I wanted to emphasize on the environment like I did on the Sunday because that's what the burns but once I became aware of it that's when I started becoming more and more easing into the message and then scripture started opening so like the first scripture like that God really struck me with we about from the Old Testament it was not just one scripture many scriptures you can see often in Bible like God was like you know I named this place so-and-so because this place has been bad and I named this place so-and-so because this place has been fruitful then you can see like Bible and like in the Bible God giving different names for a certain purpose and that's it that was my moment that was my confirmation that that's why it's important to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ because it's not just a name it's it's way more it's what it represents it's what I'm standing for and is again like you know God has this like interesting ways to like not just scripture like it just like started making me like now not started building thoughts upon thoughts which were like you know you you see even like the human marriage but like like whenever I have witnessed a marriage like for me when I see like okay this person got married to this person I already know that this wife is standing for what the her husband represents and like even my friends like I have known them enough and I can totally see that maybe they might have some differences on certain preferences but at the same time they both have one vision they both stand for the same thing and if it's a teasin they both ugly towards that and if it's like earning career they both are moving in that same direction and that's exactly what started sending me or like if we are called out to be the bride of Jesus Christ then I have to wear the name and it's not just the name I'm wearing that day for me baptism like that that was really struck my heart was I now when we take on the name we are not just taking the name but we are taking the responsibility of the Jesus Christ that's what now we are putting on and that's what now whole our life will be over and by taking that responsibility we will be truly identified as the bride of Jesus Christ and those were my convictions that led all to baptism at the end and how often our pastor has preached about it once whether mark in the message he talked about it and the final like the final like a would say like the finishing was when like brother Jonathan came and he talked about the check and he's like you know and that that's when it all just sum it up and there was no more doubt like there was no more confusion like there was no more scope it's like it's enough for me to now move and it's it's scripture verses scripture but at the same time or brother Branham said about the niceiy and convention what happened in that how they had changed the scriptures at all it all started coming together okay this all has happened and this is the important and again like this was another thing that really struck me about baptism is like you need two more I think sister Maureen had said that is like you need two more scriptures to as two witnesses for another third scripture to stand and I could not find two more scriptures that would prove the baptism in the name of titles but when you go to like the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ you'll find at least four twenty scriptures that stand witness for it so like that that's it like there are scriptures that are vindicating that Scripture so that that's it like there was my moment like to go for the baptism and what with our shores like I mean I say I'm closing so but like to sum it up like they're like this this is just one moment in the church like there was a testimony that I gives some time event that time I shared about like how I met brother Joe and how miracles were happening in my life and how we came and how Lord was testing both of us and all that and like not like if I bring all these parallel stories together then for me it was like this is now how God's grace and God's like miracle works which is like I had no clue how I'm going I'm walking in a desert I want to break down I have no answers I have no understanding of leadership of God I'm struggling to understand how to live by the will of man here God picks me out from all this mess and I had no role to play in it I already testified it was a miracle a missed call from their guard like picks me up and brings me to the message and it's like for me like that moment like my struggles with the worship were over even those days I was struggling like okay can I find even any good spirit for songs like on online to listen to that I couldn't even find those there were like any songs that I was listening like before they were never satisfying to me I just felt so incomplete and I was like now I have so many songs that I cannot cover enough so there was that secondly it was about reaching stories like I used to go online and try to look for preachings but never anything could satisfy me now I'm just not able to catch up like just so much and even one preaching like I would have to go back and listen to or three times to get full of it and before us I didn't make a difference before when I was at the other shows like if I list don't listen it still vote and create any difference so now I'm actually sometimes I have to go back and listen like three times okay to get the full gist of it so my whole spiritual life like now was coming together like the worst shape the church even like the fellowship too and this is something that I testify like this is my testimony of being at the church I have seen enough black to see the white here and it's the way I was like not you know you know in like - like a build up like ego or anything but like today I want to say that like the way our church is like together or like trying to build as one family one body and like the way we have fellowship we need to have more of it and it's like with time like we need to grow stronger that's the only way we'll be able to stand is as one body and I've seen it outside like when that body goes like each one in their own direction it rips apart and like that was another is like finally I found people who I can identify that like they I don't have to debate with them that okay we need to live up to the Bible every Lord of it no more like yep that's everybody agrees on that so that was like a honestly for me it was like a big breeder like it was really tiring now that uh solved like from work to like I mean III told to brother Joe like this is something that I had been praying like since I came to Christ because this is was a big loophole in my life because I mean of course like when I was working before coming to Christ I was in like and sales and marketing roles so I had my worldly ways to deal with stuff so I didn't know the Christian ways I didn't know what it means to even work by faith what it means to even like this is something that I really needed Joe's help in the beginning is like how to stop worrying about your competition how to accept it in like leave it in God's hand and just just keep moving just just leave it God will deal with everything around and just just keep living by faith and that's where like I it really like that it was big for me like to just live by faith like we won't work by faith this is another thing for me is like I used to be a really aggressive an impulsive person before I can say like I would get into like physical fights but I would have verbal spats like real bad ones and I remember like at my like job in India like if I don't feel like if anybody is like trying to back out from there is like I would fire off like anything I wouldn't care who was around like we had like things like not only me but how we were all dealing with each other we had actually named that meeting room as a war room that we had a label out there it's a war room and any time those conflicts are happening go into that room fight as much as you want and come out as I it was working so like this is how God's grace is like slowly and slowly he like you know the Holy Ghost started working and like it did a liposuction on me like it took out that aggression from me and it's like now I could start moving away from my emotional realm and like try to now actually be more conscious of my own emotions and the biggest thing that I was never recognizing like at there before is like when I was operating at my emotional level even if I'm right still I will have like hurtful words to other people and I was having and now I can see when I look back but not when I was doing that so like that was God's grace like no I'm telling like all this parallel struggles I'm having here that are going in my life and through this one moment and last the same on God is like like converging it all one place one solution and he's solving all these areas and it's like I had no role like again I'll keep saying it again I had no role in it like it was all true like miscommunication how it all started so it's like and it's like I don't know it's just yeah it is weird that is the miracle for me like that's much my miracle and it also like it really helps to have the faith that God is moving in my life and he has never left me even when like I was not a Christian he was still with me and I like I really feel led to even tank the church to is like to because I know that sometimes I can I can be like my intention wouldn't be there but I could be too aggressive with my questions or I could be a bit trying to like I could be maybe I'm trying to shake phaidor like trying to shake the pillars here I could be that sometimes too negotiating on stuff and that's when like I really like Church was patient with me and like trying to give my space trying to give me my time let God move in my heart and having that trust that okay I'll I'll come to the right place at the right time where God wants me to be after my convictions and even like that that was really like and I really needed that support and having that support was a big comfort for me and one of the reason that I want to mention is like like me it will be Lord's will but like our church will have a revival and like when new people come to our church I really like you know for us to keep holding the spirit and keep welcoming them and lord help us to be patient with them and this is my closing like final closing statement which is like I come I don't remember the scripture but I do remember listening this phrase is a there will like there are low here and a low there and there are people who are waiting to be saved like I was one of them God did make a move but like I will testify that it was brother Joe Boone who shared his testimony and sent me an invitation and email to come to the church why don't you come and see for you like if it's for you and we were recently talking that he has given that invitation or to testify to to hundreds of people but at least one came and just imagine how it worked for me is like from a nervous breakdown to a fulfillment and to a bigger revelation so there might not be a hundreds out there but there will be 10 so like if we are to be the bride of Jesus Christ we have to hold the responsibility of testing testifying witnessing and it's again not gonna be a hundreds or thousands but there will be tens out there so that's my prayer I request preserved he left the water for me to go on for another three hours so I thank the Lord brother for the testimony is a testimony of grace amen the grace of God and it's some revelation concerning grace that the Lord has been dealing with me for the last few days I said O Lord I said we need I said we need to understand that I said that the purpose of grace divine love projected grace a man what for well well well number one we know is to bring our brother the way that God brought him the way that God led him you know from him from India I am not knowing that from one religion to Christianity from yah into another phase of Christianity and then to the word to the message of the Allen Amen so that was the grace of God in your life brother that was God working in you a man by the grace of God not that you deserved it we didn't deserve it none of us deserved it don't don't get that don't get that idea oh well you know well I'm not so bad what do you mean you're not so bad we're all the same the divided the Bible says God has concluded us all under sin that he might have mercy upon us all so brother there's none righteous here no when it comes to ourselves and our flesh and our now natural being none not one of us you know it's it's a our righteousness is according to our faith Amen by the grace of God and again that's grace and it's there and again it's not it really it's not my righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus that he imputed to me a man again if you do this you do this you do that if your spirit is right you ready to is right gobble imputed righteousness to you we're gonna give him the glory give him the honor not praise this brother praise that sister oh they're good they're good I've heard that so often I was everything good good you know what now are you good good what I said there's none good but one so I saw I said well you're not that one you know I said it's the one that gives us this goodness that shares His goodness with us by the grace of God well brother I prayed you give us the true real revelation of grace old grace brings me through this grace brings me to that but then your grace is ordained for another purpose than another reason oh yeah oh it's by grace through faith I'm say yeah what does Grace do Oh grace gives me faith yeah well but again when you get into that faith you still need grace hey man you don't leave grace behind you still you definitely still need it and and God has proved that through our brothers testimony a man they get the grace gave of this revelation and he walked into it but he discovered the meaning more grace Oh Lord I need more grace more grace Lord and he went on a little further and all the challenge were the challenge was that was bringing forth the need for more grace and more grace and more grace amen so let's let's respect grace this honor grace must be thankful for grace and let's be let's be praying constantly more grace lord I need more grace amen well because brother and our brother mentioned concerning thirsty only he was thirsty for something but again there yes brother God was with you amen even and even in India even even the Indian religion God was with you you know even when you were maybe even just just realized you were sinner living like a sinner and that's so on it was still God God was there because God at a time appointed for you then he was gonna he was going to bring you to this he's gonna bring you to that a man see it's it's it's thirsting God God creates that thirst what for oh well we win when you're a baby you're gonna thirst for milk that's right you and as you get older your thirst for this your thirst for that did your thirst for water then maybe you're gonna thirst for some food you know and so on by the grace of God so God where does it come from it's grace it's God that gives us that thirst what is your thirst now do you have any thirst on brother I tell you I trust my grace you do because why God God says he saw I'm going to give thirst thirst thirst thirst and so on and he said blessed are they the unger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled he may they shall be blessed and so on so oh yeah but I that's all over with their notice not because as you begin your
