[12:27] with us today of course that God would
[12:29] touch each and every one and minister to
[12:32] whatever need each one has today
[12:35] could be sickness or whatever but God
[12:40] knows there's no distance with God so he
[12:42] can just lose the holy spirit and
[12:44] minister to every need this morning if
[12:47] we believe and trust him so remember the
[12:51] Saints around the island the Bride of

[40:16] so the grace of God with us and help us
[40:19] to find us in the will of God in these
[40:21] circumstances in these situations so
[40:24] let's pray every and brother I don't
[40:28] know if he noticed it but just recently
[40:30] within the last couple of days that
[40:33] government's had been putting the
[40:35] answers on churches yeah
[40:37] certain one said they said what this
[40:39] good let him go and practice their faith
[40:43] and pray because these if there's any
[40:45] time we needed prayer it's now a man
[40:48] they should have focused on that first
[40:50] one it started they met and just even
[40:53] this morning on the radio it was a the
[40:56] preacher god bless him it was good
[41:00] Sonia's ministry and obvious word and he
[41:04] was challenging them concerning pandemic
[41:06] and coalbed 19 and he said was this he
[41:11] said of God he said to God send this for
[41:13] a reason they got a lot of this happened
[41:16] for a reason
[41:16] and so on a man we believe that there
[41:19] was a reason for almost certainly
[41:21] brothers bringing up what's in the world
[41:23] but also to bring us in any in
[41:25] Christians to bring us in believers
[41:28] your attitude your spirit oh yeah God's
[41:30] watching us and brother now wait for us
[41:34] we want just to have church have Church
[41:36] a church but now over there
[41:39] the government's are focusing on
[41:40] churches meeting getting together
[41:42] expressing their faith a man and pray
[41:45] and there and again I don't know if you
[41:47] heard it on the news last night or the
[41:49] news again this morning whatever but
[41:52] that's that's what they're calling on
[41:53] now amen
[41:54] because it's gone on so long that they
[41:57] feel it's the time for expression of our
[41:58] faith
[41:59] amen or to allow those that have faith
[42:01] to go to church allow those do that
[42:04] faith to do this and pray for us hey man
[42:06] and all due respect even to the
[42:08] President of the United States he
[42:11] highlighted it he said he said we need
[42:13] prayer he said so he said we should
[42:15] allow the churches to get together and
[42:17] he said of pray he's because we needed a
[42:19] man and so what for so that they can
[42:22] make it there can be an expression of
[42:24] faith oh yeah
[42:26] I said well praise the Lord God allowed
[42:28] it to bring out what's in them what's in
[42:31] us
[42:31] he got allowed it to bring out a
[42:32] testimony

[42:38] it's a brother that will go forth a man
[42:41] living out the faith manifesting the
[42:45] faith expressing the faith in thought in

[49:38] chapter 11 a man and praying the grace
[49:43] of God to be with us today and to help
[49:45] us was he go through the word Amen so
[49:49] that the will of God be done and that
[49:51] we'll say what he wants us to say and
[49:53] the saints of God will hear what God
[49:55] wants them to hear a man in 2nd
[49:58] Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 10 as
[50:02] the truth of Christ is in me no man
[50:06] shall stop me of this boasting in the
[50:09] regions of a Kia wherefore he said
[50:13] because I love you not
[50:14] he said God knoweth Paul's faith and
[50:18] Paul's ministry and Paul's calling was
[50:20] being challenged but he said what I do
[50:23] that I will do that I may cast off
[50:27] vocation he said from them which desire
[50:31] location he said that we're in they
[50:34] glory he said they may be found even as
[50:37] we are and he said for such because
[50:41] they're seeking to glorify themselves
[50:43] they're seeking to highlight themselves
[50:45] and he said for such are false apostles
[50:48] and they are deceitful workers a man
[50:53] transforming themselves into the
[50:56] apostles of Christ amazing and again to
[51:00] highlight the revelation concerning the
[51:03] anointing once at the end time and I
[51:05] trust by grace that we're going to get
[51:07] the right revelation of the anointing
[51:09] ones at the entire then we're going to
[51:11] believe it the way that the Bible
[51:12] teaches it we're going to believe in the
[51:14] way that God has highlighted it in these
[51:16] last days and as I say just before God
[51:19] called the Prophet home he laid this on
[51:21] his heart to share with the saints
[51:24] concerning the endtime anointed ones so
[51:27] that we're not going to be deceived by
[51:29] the false
[51:30] once and again to understand as I
[51:33] mentioned I believe on Wednesday that is
[51:35] not a false anointing no no it is a true
[51:37] anointing but they're false in their
[51:39] teaching a man so bright pray God
[51:42] brothers sister that weird that we got
[51:44] the true anointing that's good but let
[51:46] us not be false in our in our teaching
[51:48] there does not be false in what we say
[51:50] that we believe there's not be false you
[51:52] know that we're going to reflect the
[51:54] Word of God and we're going to afflict
[51:56] it exactly according to the prophecy
[51:58] according to what God has ordained for
[52:00] this hour but we are dealing with those
[52:03] that are false apostles here as as Paul
[52:07] dealt with them in the first stage we
[52:09] deal with them in these last days for
[52:12] such he said are false apostles and
[52:14] deceitful workers transforming
[52:18] themselves into the apostles of Christ
[52:22] this is amazing and it says that no
[52:25] Marvel for Satan himself is transformed
[52:29] into an angel light a man make sure that
[52:33] we're following the right light by the
[52:35] grace of God and therefore he said it is
[52:38] no great thing if his ministers also be
[52:41] transformed as ministers of
[52:43] righteousness whose end shall be
[52:46] according to their works God's grace to
[52:50] ask god bless you may be seated
[52:53] amen and it is God's permissive will
[52:57] there are those that would wonder why
[52:59] after the prophet has said what he has
[53:01] said after God has revealed to us what
[53:03] he has revealed to us in 19 and 65 why
[53:06] would God permit false Christ's why
[53:10] would God permit the false prophets and
[53:13] yet they would be experiencing his
[53:15] anointing but yet false in their
[53:17] teachings so I believe that God had a
[53:19] reason in permitting it God permitted it
[53:22] in the Garden of Eden
[53:23] God is permitting it in these last days
[53:26] in Satan's Eden a man God is permitted
[53:29] in this hour where in the Bible it's
[53:31] already expressed to us that it is the
[53:34] God Satan is the god of this evil age a
[53:37] mad so brother/sister we we need to be
[53:40] on our guard
[53:42] again let me repeat it if there's ever
[53:44] an hour that we need to make our calling
[53:46] and election sure it's this hour a man
[53:49] to know who you are to know a man that
[53:52] you are in the right word that you're
[53:54] under the right anointing by the grace
[53:56] of God but also they are under the right
[53:59] teaching because there are those are
[54:01] under or under a right anointing but as
[54:03] under a false teaching Amen that's the
[54:06] truth
[54:06] and yet God allows as God permits it for
[54:09] a reason and the proud of God brings
[54:11] this out he feels that it's very very
[54:13] important and he feels that that we
[54:16] needed in these last days and I Andy's
[54:18] friend he's right brother God God - we
[54:21] just got allowed us to go through it you
[54:24] know all other ages and God just we
[54:26] skipped over skipped over God God just
[54:28] made man God's permissive will but in
[54:31] the last stage when God is requiring a
[54:33] greater faith God gives us the greater
[54:36] revelation of false Christ's and false
[54:39] prophets a man so they've been in
[54:42] they've been with they've been I've
[54:43] really in in in the history and in in
[54:47] what God has done and what God is doing
[54:49] the false prophets have been there right
[54:52] from the beginning a man and brother not
[54:55] only when it comes to a time but also in
[54:58] eternity because it says Satan walked up
[55:01] and down in the coals of fire Satan was
[55:04] a covering chair a mayor and and the
[55:07] Bible tells us Eddie where everything
[55:09] was fine until iniquity was found in him
[55:11] until he got lifted up with pride he met
[55:14] and that's the truth praise the name of
[55:17] the lord thank you lord
[55:18] Alleluia as saying God lifted up with
[55:21] pride and he was cast out and I and
[55:23] those angels that win with him Amen they
[55:26] were cast out so brother now we know
[55:28] that that we were dealing with those
[55:30] strange spirits among believers amen
[55:33] Satan is not going to be out there just
[55:36] wandering among the unbelievers no he
[55:38] already got them he got he don't have to
[55:40] worry with that a man they're all
[55:42] they're already lost
[55:43] they're already their names and on the
[55:45] Lamb's Book of Life but where Satan is
[55:47] going to work he's going to work among
[55:48] believers a man right from the Garden of
[55:51] Eden and row well even he turned to
[55:53] yourself
[55:54] he was where
[55:54] among the angels of God in eternity a
[55:57] man he was working among the seed of God
[55:59] in the book in the in Genesis and in the
[56:02] Garden of Eden and brother the the
[56:04] Saints the Saints and the prophets have
[56:06] had to deal with those false spirits
[56:08] right from right through the new Old
[56:10] Testament right on in through the New
[56:11] Testament a man and right on down to the
[56:14] east last days a man and the prophet of
[56:16] God does bring it out a man you bring
[56:20] out concerning Moses but are you
[56:22] bringing out concerning the those that
[56:24] were impersonating Moses he'll bring out
[56:26] concerning the true prophets and those
[56:27] that were impersonating the true
[56:29] prophets a man and only that there there
[56:32] there there's evidence right here in the
[56:34] scripture that God did use some of those
[56:37] false prophets a man and God didn't own
[56:40] some of those false prophets they met
[56:42] there is there is a false prophet right
[56:44] here in the Old Testament and brother o
[56:46] mine oh yeah he would go out and he
[56:49] would say to Israel and he would say to
[56:51] this nation that nation the Lord told me
[56:54] this and he was right
[56:55] God did tell him a man but he would
[56:59] apply his own thoughts to other things
[57:00] he wouldn't go out an ant applied a word
[57:03] he wouldn't want to say now stay with
[57:04] this word stay with this word he was
[57:07] saying that the Lord said this but a man
[57:10] he was a goat not a lamb he was a goat
[57:12] not a sheep and so it said that's what
[57:15] the false prophets yay
[57:16] and God said thus saith the Lord thus
[57:19] saith the Lord but then they're put in
[57:21] their butts then they'll add this and
[57:23] they'll add that and you know they say
[57:25] oh yeah you can do this you can do that
[57:26] but God said this and so on so brother
[57:30] the false anointed ones in these last
[57:32] days is not it's not just in the last
[57:35] days they've been God has been dealing
[57:37] with them from eternity the saints of
[57:40] God have been dealing with them all the
[57:41] way down through time and now it's
[57:44] coming to a climax and you and I have to
[57:47] deal with those false anointings
[57:48] falselist spirits rather again you can
[57:51] have a true anointing but a false
[57:53] teaching oh yeah you can experience as I
[57:56] said again let me repeat it that you can
[57:58] experience the anointing of God and the
[58:00] Holy Ghost in your flesh 24 hours the
[58:02] prophecy and go to hell a mayor because
[58:05] why it's in your flesh not in your heart
[58:07] is
[58:08] your flesh govern man controlled by the
[58:10] thoughts of your mind but not by the
[58:12] revelation in the heart God is in the
[58:15] heart
[58:15] Satan is in the mind and again this is
[58:18] this is the devil's watchtower is your
[58:20] mind and God's watchtower is your soul
[58:23] if he is in your soul a man if you are
[58:27] truly mourned again
[58:28] praise the name of the Lord see listen
[58:31] in the German are we needed it is in
[58:33] this hour but I down through the ages
[58:36] people just believe all I got to do is
[58:38] believe God's prophet I believe God Lord
[58:40] forgive me and so on and move on a man
[58:43] they laid down their lives and they went
[58:45] into the dimension of the righteous and
[58:47] so on but as time moved on moved on
[58:50] moved on it was becoming more and more
[58:53] and more deceiving with these false
[58:55] prophets a man oh yeah
[58:58] we're coming were under a greater and
[59:00] greater anointing a man but yet a
[59:03] greater and a greater and I'm false
[59:05] teaching a man Jesus experienced that
[59:07] 2,000 years ago
[59:09] now mrs. Jesus Christ has experienced it
[59:11] Jesus had to deal with Judas now we're
[59:14] dealing with the Judas Terrance
[59:15] the prophet of God said pretended
[59:17] brothers amen I'm not worried about
[59:20] those out there it says what we're going
[59:23] to experience around the message amen
[59:25] let's make our calling and our election
[59:27] sure and next more than a yes make sure
[59:29] we got the anointing yes right but make
[59:31] sure that anointing is going to line us
[59:33] up with the Word of God that which is
[59:36] pleased was good there really than which
[59:37] I need right now
[59:38] what does I need to know what does I
[59:40] need to believe amen what is the faith I
[59:43] I need to have right now
[59:44] is it just a faith to believe that God
[59:46] has sent a prophet is just a faith to
[59:49] believe that God has opened the seven
[59:51] seals and the mystery of God is revealed
[59:52] brother we need to believe something
[59:54] more than that
[59:55] amen there are many that are believing
[59:58] God us and a prophet God has opened the
[1:00:00] seven seals the mystery of God is
[1:00:01] finished and so on but yet they're still
[1:00:04] going on living the same kind of a life
[1:00:06] a man but brother if we really truly got
[1:00:10] the revelation as we ought to have it
[1:00:12] and we truly got the anointing iniesta
[1:00:14] God the anointing but got a true
[1:00:16] teaching and that we're under the Word
[1:00:20] of God that is ordained
[1:00:22] predestinated to give us what God has
[1:00:25] ordained for it to do and brother
[1:00:27] brother says when it comes to the
[1:00:28] mystery when it comes to the seals when
[1:00:31] it comes to the Prophet what is it
[1:00:33] ordained to do why did God - for
[1:00:35] prophesied this and ordained this to
[1:00:38] heaven to give the bride what she needs
[1:00:41] in this hour
[1:00:42] they gave other what he needed in that
[1:00:44] day and Wesley what he needed in that
[1:00:46] day a man they didn't mean while you and
[1:00:48] I need amen
[1:00:50] you and I need what they had plus a mate
[1:00:53] and to give the Pentecostals why they
[1:00:55] needed a man but brother now is giving
[1:00:58] us that plus a man and what is the plus
[1:01:03] or God sent a prophet the mystery of God
[1:01:05] is revealed the seals are open yeah
[1:01:07] that's right but brother as it
[1:01:10] accomplished in you what God wants it to
[1:01:12] accomplish is it is it doing to us what
[1:01:15] God wants it to do is it giving us what
[1:01:18] God wants it to give a man not just the
[1:01:21] revelation of the mystery not just a
[1:01:23] revelation of the seals not just a
[1:01:25] revelation of this rather this doctrine
[1:01:28] that doctrine amai it what is all of
[1:01:30] that ordained to do it's why brother
[1:01:32] sister why did God do that because faith
[1:01:35] comes by hearing the word a man the word
[1:01:40] is there I heard the word but did we
[1:01:42] catch the faith a man that's the thing
[1:01:45] that many many have heard the word but
[1:01:47] haven't they haven't got the faith
[1:01:49] that's the truth of a man god help us
[1:01:51] brother and the prophet of God was
[1:01:53] dealing with that even before God called
[1:01:55] him home a man that's why that he went
[1:01:58] on and he ministered on the anointing
[1:01:59] once at the end time he ministered on
[1:02:01] leadership and he ministered on a man
[1:02:04] the rapture and then he ministered on
[1:02:06] perfect faith perfect faith one of the
[1:02:10] one of the last messages that he
[1:02:11] ministered on and it was perfect faith
[1:02:14] why because knowing that what God has
[1:02:16] done and what God was doing it was to
[1:02:19] give us faith that pleases God and
[1:02:21] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:02:24] God
[1:02:24] amen and we got to have that faith that
[1:02:27] God wants us to have in the day in the
[1:02:29] hour that we are living a man God Elvis
[1:02:33] brother that we are here now because
[1:02:34] gods
[1:02:35] because God has sent a prophet we're
[1:02:37] here because God through the prophet
[1:02:39] revealed the word a man and in that word
[1:02:42] is what I need in that word is what you
[1:02:45] need in that word is what God wants us
[1:02:47] to have and to get and it is rapturing
[1:02:50] faith it is to pay for the Resurrection
[1:02:53] and the pay for the rapture amen brother
[1:02:55] Jesus came with a brother hallelujah
[1:02:58] brother than any of the prophets that
[1:03:00] come on the scene and to have that
[1:03:02] revelation Jesus at it
[1:03:04] he had the revelation of the
[1:03:05] resurrection and he had the revelation
[1:03:07] of the rapture a man and and brother not
[1:03:10] only that but he had the revelation
[1:03:12] where he come from why he was here and
[1:03:14] where he was going and now he's going to
[1:03:16] get there amen
[1:03:17] praise the name of the Lord all my grace
[1:03:20] mothers not just saying I believe in God
[1:03:22] and I believe this and I believe that no
[1:03:24] you gotta believe what God wants you to
[1:03:26] believe in this late hour
[1:03:27] a man so brother sister that were not
[1:03:30] going to be deceived by the false
[1:03:32] anointed once a mate oh yeah they got an
[1:03:35] anointing they can do signs and wonders
[1:03:37] they can do this they can do that but
[1:03:39] and then then they'll take the message
[1:03:41] but then what they'll do is they'll
[1:03:43] they'll just go so far and they'll add
[1:03:45] to it or take away from it a man and
[1:03:47] there's many there's many a so-called
[1:03:49] ministry today brother again false
[1:03:52] Christ's they become false prophets a
[1:03:56] man because we're going to say yes God
[1:03:59] said but a man as it was in the Garden
[1:04:02] of Eden so it is right now and as even
[1:04:05] and Adam had to deal with that so you
[1:04:06] and I have to deal with that brother
[1:04:08] we'd be better be careful of the buts
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] so a man so they're not going to say
[1:04:14] yeah the Provost said but the robber
[1:04:16] said but no no it is thus saith the Lord
[1:04:20] it is written a man and as the prophet
[1:04:23] of God said I got to get myself out of
[1:04:25] the way and he said so he can do this
[1:04:27] I'll give my son another way so he not
[1:04:29] only not only in in the signs and the
[1:04:31] wonders but brother get himself out of
[1:04:33] the way for the going forth of the word
[1:04:35] a man and again as the ministry and
[1:04:38] brethren and as our brother prayed that
[1:04:40] the minister and the pastors and the
[1:04:42] evangelists and all the fivefold
[1:04:44] ministry they had to get themselves out
[1:04:46] of the way
[1:04:47] a man so God can say what he wants to
[1:04:49] say a man and what he wants to say is
[1:04:52] ordained to give us the faith that he
[1:04:54] wants us to have a man again going
[1:04:58] beyond the faith that God sent a prophet
[1:05:00] going beyond the faith that it is the
[1:05:03] last days going beyond the faith a man
[1:05:05] that the seals are opened a man and this
[1:05:08] God has done this God has done that
[1:05:10] brother-sister a man let's go beyond
[1:05:12] that to to what God has done it for the
[1:05:16] reason he did it a man that we can say
[1:05:19] the way God did this why God did that
[1:05:21] hey I he's doing it in me he's doing it
[1:05:23] in you a man he's producing in you he's
[1:05:27] producing it in me by the grace of God
[1:05:29] Amen because there are many even in the
[1:05:32] days of Luther brother they never got
[1:05:35] justification the way that God wanted
[1:05:37] them to get it amen and that's why that
[1:05:40] why their roles that generation they got
[1:05:42] the intellectual knowledge and
[1:05:44] revelation of justification but they
[1:05:46] never had the spiritual revelation in
[1:05:48] their souls a man and what do they do
[1:05:50] they went out and they made a
[1:05:52] denomination out of it amen oh yeah this
[1:05:55] is this is in the Bible they did they
[1:05:57] went back to the Bible and they say
[1:05:59] where the Bible says this the just shall
[1:06:01] live by faith and so on this is it right
[1:06:03] here and our founder Martin Luther was
[1:06:06] right he said this and he said that but
[1:06:09] yet for Martin Luther it wasn't a
[1:06:11] doctrine it was it was an experience
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] he experienced justification as well as
[1:06:18] the Wesley experience sanctification and
[1:06:21] the Pentecostals experienced the baptism
[1:06:23] of the Holy Ghost not just the doctrine
[1:06:26] to say I believe this and I believe that
[1:06:28] they experience it and they lived it
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:32] Martin Luther experienced join us
[1:06:33] straight to the justification and he
[1:06:35] lived it they praise the Lord
[1:06:38] and John Wesley experienced that he
[1:06:40] lived it a man and he went but it wasn't
[1:06:43] just a doctrine it was the life because
[1:06:45] anything they were looking for it was
[1:06:47] the faith that please God amen well
[1:06:50] there there this in their heads that in
[1:06:52] their heads
[1:06:52] but they were looking for an experience
[1:06:54] in their souls with God know
[1:06:57] one experience with God Wesley one
[1:06:59] experience with God the Pentecostals
[1:07:01] were looking for an experience with God
[1:07:03] a man
[1:07:04] Lloyd like Luther had and Wesley had but
[1:07:06] they wanted a greater experience with
[1:07:07] God a man the one Luther had plus but
[1:07:11] Wesley had plus what God was going to
[1:07:13] give the Pentecostals and now they
[1:07:15] that's there for you and me as well but
[1:07:17] we want that plus a man don't think
[1:07:20] you're gonna you got to do away with it
[1:07:22] not by any means because again God still
[1:07:25] requires justification sanctification
[1:07:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts
[1:07:30] of the Spirit amen praise the name of
[1:07:32] the Lord the public God's are the gifts
[1:07:34] are there there and wave any big God
[1:07:36] wants to use them they're there a man
[1:07:38] we're not gonna leave them we're not
[1:07:39] going to lay them aside not by any means
[1:07:41] we're just live we just go on in the
[1:07:44] spirit amen thank you lord i justified
[1:07:46] amen you have the experience of
[1:07:49] justification you know the experience of
[1:07:52] sanctification amen that you have the
[1:07:55] experience of the baptism of the holy
[1:07:57] ghost amen and giving you access to the
[1:08:01] gifts praise the name of the lord is
[1:08:04] between yes bringing us closer and
[1:08:06] closer and closer to God a man more in
[1:08:09] the fellowship with God more in the
[1:08:10] fellowship with with our Lord Jesus
[1:08:12] Christ
[1:08:13] a man by getting us closer and closer to
[1:08:15] the resurrection and the rapture a man
[1:08:18] so God did that God did that well what's
[1:08:20] the next thing
[1:08:21] it's resurrection and rapture amen but
[1:08:24] too many or too many areas going to
[1:08:25] Malachi for they stop there yeah they
[1:08:28] stop in Malachi for I will send you
[1:08:30] Elijah the Prophet before the coming of
[1:08:32] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:08:34] and he should turn to her the father's
[1:08:36] to the children now John went that was
[1:08:38] John the Baptist a man he turned the
[1:08:41] heart of the Jewish fathers and the Old
[1:08:44] Testament fathers to the New Testament
[1:08:46] children a man but and Jesus told him
[1:08:49] when they said well where's Elijah well
[1:08:51] he's already come and they didn't know
[1:08:54] it referring to John any any of the
[1:08:57] dreams doing what he was ordained to do
[1:08:58] to turn the hearts of those those Jewish
[1:09:01] fathers the Old Testament fathers to the
[1:09:03] New Testament children a man but he said
[1:09:06] he but he said he's going to come and he
[1:09:08] prophesied
[1:09:09] they reference the time that I had that
[1:09:12] the spirit of Elijah would come again
[1:09:14] and restore all things a man knowing
[1:09:18] that there was going to be a doing away
[1:09:20] with a lot doing away with a lot a man
[1:09:22] but God said I'll restore a million and
[1:09:27] he said this the second time that Elijah
[1:09:30] was going to come and he said he o ne
[1:09:32] and the heart say you turned the heart
[1:09:34] of the father's to the children and the
[1:09:38] last time he said the children to their
[1:09:41] fathers what is now it's the children
[1:09:44] now to turn our hearts back to the
[1:09:46] Pentecostal father's praise the name of
[1:09:49] the Lord hallelujah
[1:09:50] why because they had gotten off into
[1:09:52] coal religion and denominational
[1:09:55] religion and so on a man and oh yeah
[1:09:58] they they believe this they believe that
[1:10:00] and they added in their heads but not in
[1:10:02] their hearts amen
[1:10:04] because if you got it in your heart Amen
[1:10:06] Lutheran and it is art and those that
[1:10:08] lived in Luther's day had it in their
[1:10:10] hearts and they went on to Wesley and
[1:10:12] then they had that in their heart so
[1:10:14] they went on to the Pentecostals and
[1:10:15] they got it in their hearts ain't man
[1:10:17] and those are the ones that come right
[1:10:19] on to the message amen
[1:10:21] if you guide the baptism in your heart
[1:10:23] justification sanctification the bedroom
[1:10:25] of the Holy Ghost in your heart in your
[1:10:27] soul you'll go right on to the reprobate
[1:10:31] you'll go on to the greater revelation
[1:10:33] of the resurrection and the rapture and
[1:10:35] our hearts are turned back amen to the
[1:10:38] revelation of the word to give us the
[1:10:40] faith of the Resurrection the faith of
[1:10:43] the rapture why because 2,000 years ago
[1:10:46] Jesus and Old Testament Saints were
[1:10:48] resurrected and raptured a man praise
[1:10:52] the name of the Lord hallelujah he had
[1:10:54] that faith to lay down his life pick it
[1:10:56] up again a man and the boy got faith lay
[1:10:59] down your life pick it up again a man
[1:11:02] the resurrection and the rapture if
[1:11:04] there's anything that God is wanting us
[1:11:07] to focus on is resurrection and the
[1:11:09] rapture getting us out of here amen amen
[1:11:14] that's the closing of the Gentile
[1:11:16] dispensation and the moving of the
[1:11:18] gospel back to the Jews amen for the
[1:11:21] hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:11:23] it is the end of all things brother I
[1:11:26] pray God help us to believe that it is
[1:11:27] and not only just to believe that it is
[1:11:29] let us go to live like it is that we
[1:11:32] literally live what we believe any man
[1:11:34] and so that it's not just in our end
[1:11:36] you're gonna have it in your head but
[1:11:38] you won't live in it live like it porno
[1:11:40] there's too many believers God got all
[1:11:42] that in their head but they're not
[1:11:44] littered it's not in their hearts how do
[1:11:45] you know because they're not living it
[1:11:47] no no they're not acting like it's the
[1:11:50] end of the world
[1:11:50] and they're not many many a billion
[1:11:53] so-called believer they're not doing as
[1:11:55] Jesus told them to do and the problem
[1:11:56] does bring it out again in the message
[1:11:58] then only once at the end time and he
[1:12:01] said Jesus did this Jesus did that he
[1:12:02] said this he said that before he's no no
[1:12:05] you should look up because your
[1:12:06] Redemption draws nigh amen brother if
[1:12:09] there's anything anything when it comes
[1:12:11] to results of what God has done in
[1:12:12] Malachi 4 where God has done in
[1:12:15] Revelation 10 brother I tell you though
[1:12:17] those that are come under the revelation
[1:12:19] of those prophecies fulfilled in this
[1:12:22] hour they're the ones that's looking up
[1:12:24] amen they're not caught up with this
[1:12:26] world that not caught up with the
[1:12:27] flourishes of this world they're saying
[1:12:30] goodbye amen
[1:12:32] we're on our way amen and brother we
[1:12:35] want to we want to get out of you got
[1:12:37] the Holy Ghost you want to get out look
[1:12:39] a little Luther hungered and thirsted
[1:12:41] and crying for the revelation of jobs
[1:12:44] justification and Wesley cried for Saint
[1:12:47] a vacation and I'll tell you the baptism
[1:12:49] of the Holy Ghost the gifts amen
[1:12:51] there's a generation of Pentecostals
[1:12:53] they were crying crying crying for the
[1:12:56] moving of the Spirit of God a man and
[1:12:59] the restoration of the gifts a man so
[1:13:01] brothers sister there's going to be a
[1:13:02] generation that's going to be hungry and
[1:13:04] thirsting and cried for the rapture
[1:13:06] hungry and thirsty no crying for the
[1:13:08] resurrection not just lazy oh yeah
[1:13:12] they're due this is a lazy generation
[1:13:14] and brothers naturally and they're lazy
[1:13:17] spiritually why do you want me to do oh
[1:13:20] yeah brother like Jesus when he was in
[1:13:23] the Garden of Gethsemane and he went and
[1:13:25] did he with everyday was just laying
[1:13:27] there didn't they weren't bothered oh he
[1:13:30] will sleep on sleep on take your rest
[1:13:34] because the hour is coming in when when
[1:13:36] they when they would
[1:13:36] do it a man when they would get into the
[1:13:39] revelation gave the Holy Ghost and they
[1:13:41] would have the power of the anointing
[1:13:43] amen that Jesus had a man through that
[1:13:46] Peter when they when they went to
[1:13:47] crucify Peter further for the faith
[1:13:50] after the day of pedicle at the penny
[1:13:53] kind of the bed the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost amen and the revival a man and
[1:13:58] Peter winona and he took his stand for
[1:14:01] the truth he took a stand for the word
[1:14:02] amen praise the name of the Lord and you
[1:14:06] man Peter and then when they were there
[1:14:08] were they took him put him in prison
[1:14:09] they're going to crucify you and they
[1:14:11] did but they were a Christian five
[1:14:14] minutes they crucified Jesus Peter said
[1:14:17] don't do that he said I'm not worthy he
[1:14:20] said turn me upside down yeah so they
[1:14:24] turned him upside down on the cross and
[1:14:26] crucified Him amen why he felt he wasn't
[1:14:30] worthy but he wanted to die for the
[1:14:32] gospel see Jesus died and laid down his
[1:14:35] life but again let's understand this
[1:14:37] Jesus had a revelation of where he come
[1:14:39] from where he's but where he was going
[1:14:41] why was here how he's going to get there
[1:14:43] brother
[1:14:44] now God true the message of the earth in
[1:14:46] this hour in these last days God has
[1:14:49] given us a revelation of where we come
[1:14:51] from why we're here where we're going
[1:14:53] and how we're going to get there amen
[1:14:55] and we recognize Malachi 4 because God
[1:14:58] has through Malachi 4 give us what it's
[1:15:01] going to take to get us home amen and
[1:15:05] not only to get us not to just to give
[1:15:07] us what we need to get us home to give
[1:15:09] us the revelation that we need to what
[1:15:11] forth to get us to look up because if
[1:15:14] we're going home you gotta look up
[1:15:16] praise the Lord as I I prayed nice and
[1:15:19] Lord I said pray grace grace that Lord
[1:15:22] that will had the same attitude that you
[1:15:24] had 2,000 years ago a man because he
[1:15:27] knew that hour was coming he couldn't
[1:15:29] take it no longer how much longer he
[1:15:31] said shall I be with you I turns not
[1:15:35] many believers with that attitude and if
[1:15:38] you don't have that attitude you're not
[1:15:41] gonna know rapture you got to have that
[1:15:43] attitude in that spirit to go into
[1:15:45] rapture you got a walk to go amen
[1:15:50] that's again as their Bible of God said
[1:15:52] that's why God is waiting on us
[1:15:54] why through the revelation of the word
[1:15:56] and the going forth of the word nain in
[1:15:59] the word
[1:15:59] a man receiving the word because we
[1:16:02] sieve it in our hearts it's going to
[1:16:03] give us that desire amen
[1:16:06] the more and more we believe the message
[1:16:08] the more and more we're getting into the
[1:16:09] word amen
[1:16:10] the more and more we're going to be
[1:16:11] looking up we'll ignore what's going on
[1:16:14] in the world get thee behind me Satan in
[1:16:17] red Satan can try to get you to focus on
[1:16:19] that too why because he wants to keep
[1:16:21] you away from the rapture
[1:16:23] keep you away from the resurrection he
[1:16:25] knows his time is short
[1:16:27] amen and he knows the significance of
[1:16:30] the Resurrection in the rapture he knows
[1:16:32] that's it oh my I'm really finished when
[1:16:37] they go in the resurrection they go in
[1:16:38] the rapture I'll be really finished well
[1:16:40] I'll do this and I'll do that but he
[1:16:43] knows his time is over he knows his time
[1:16:46] is short
[1:16:47] amen so brother sister are we living
[1:16:50] with this this this revelation of what
[1:16:52] God has done why he has done it a man as
[1:16:55] God accomplished in us what are you nor
[1:16:58] deigned amen to a communist what he
[1:17:01] wanted to accomplish in us through
[1:17:03] Malachi 4 through the Ministry of
[1:17:05] William Branham amen through the signs
[1:17:08] and the wonders true they owe me the
[1:17:10] word Amen God did it that's good
[1:17:12] I believe God did I believe God did it
[1:17:14] by school yeah
[1:17:15] the devil believes he did it amen but is
[1:17:19] it accomplishing in you what are you
[1:17:21] ordained for hate to accomplish in us
[1:17:22] just to get us to believe it no no get
[1:17:25] us to receive it and live it amen
[1:17:29] so why so that what God did is
[1:17:31] controlling you the mystery the open
[1:17:35] seals is controlling you amen
[1:17:37] controlling what you think how you think
[1:17:39] what you do and how you do it amen so
[1:17:42] the brother we're not living for
[1:17:43] ourselves we're living for the Lord when
[1:17:45] I live in where ourselves were living
[1:17:47] for the resurrection to wrassle we can't
[1:17:48] get away from it
[1:17:49] Amen Jesus couldn't get away from it he
[1:17:51] was thinking about it praying about it
[1:17:53] oh my he's just looking up looking up
[1:17:56] and he oh I know I'm going to Jerusalem
[1:17:58] and the Son of Man is gonna be betrayed
[1:18:00] into the hands of sinful men old Peters
[1:18:02] no no no no no no we won't go he said
[1:18:04] get behind me Satan
[1:18:06] what why would he say that because the
[1:18:11] devil was there to try to prevent it
[1:18:13] Satan knew that what Jesus were going to
[1:18:15] accomplish in calvert at Jerusalem was
[1:18:18] going to give him a greater and a
[1:18:19] greater defeat a man knowing that it was
[1:18:23] going to it was going to give Alleluia
[1:18:25] the seed of God more and more power over
[1:18:26] the devil a man praise the name of the
[1:18:30] Lord and that's why the devil didn't
[1:18:32] want Jesus to get down there a man my
[1:18:35] brother oh my I can't good it can't get
[1:18:37] him do it now to explain all that but
[1:18:39] it's tremendous God has ordained that
[1:18:42] God predestinated this and this this and
[1:18:44] he said out of my way I gotta go to
[1:18:45] Jerusalem he knew that he knew the price
[1:18:48] you had to pay and after he had prayed
[1:18:51] and the angel came and strengthened the
[1:18:53] physical body go amen
[1:18:57] on the accuser of this and the accused
[1:18:59] with that and he could have answered but
[1:19:01] he didn't he opened not his mouth
[1:19:04] Amen why why do you say sorry because

[1:19:11] if I could call to ask the Father and he
[1:19:14] have sent me 10 legions of angels to
[1:19:16] destroy the world and set me free amen

[1:24:38] faith faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:24:42] by the word Amen praise the Lord and
[1:24:47] Brotherhood the enemy is there any to to
[1:24:50] influence God's anointed ones a mentor
[1:24:53] yeah they got the anointing but he'll
[1:24:57] influence them to give up false teaching
[1:24:59] to add to what God said
[1:25:02] yeah if God said but yes God said but
[1:25:05] brother not only the search the serpent
[1:25:07] in the Garden of Eden and not only Eve
[1:25:09] to it - to Adam a man my brother he's
[1:25:12] influencing preachers and and the laity
[1:25:16] a man oh yeah God sent a prophet God
[1:25:19] sent a prophet cause to the problem he
[1:25:20] said this and then he opposed but in are
[1:25:23] you still doing it many a preacher as
[1:25:26] said this but and and added this and
[1:25:30] that a day they'll say it this way they
[1:25:32] say it that way brother sister be
[1:25:34] careful
[1:25:34] leave it the way that it is know whether
[1:25:37] the popular God said after the Oh me of
[1:25:39] the seven seals now he said don't make
[1:25:41] it any bigger than what it is don't make
[1:25:43] it any smaller than what it is he said
[1:25:45] leave it the way it is a man but I tell
[1:25:47] you this since they're going to the
[1:25:49] Prophet they have made it bigger than
[1:25:50] what it is smaller than what it is a man
[1:25:52] they did they're not leaving it the way
[1:25:54] that he said it a man they'll say it
[1:25:56] this way they'll say it that way they'll
[1:25:58] add true it take away from it and so on
[1:26:00] brother that's called what is it they
[1:26:02] got a date there der noted with the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost to recognize that it was God not
[1:26:07] anybody the Holy Ghost to recognize
[1:26:09] there was a prophetic ministry a man it
[1:26:11] was the only the word the revelation of
[1:26:13] the mystery of God but the debt the
[1:26:14] enemy comes in to influence them in
[1:26:16] their thinking concerning what the
[1:26:18] prophet said a man the same as they
[1:26:21] there to influence many when it comes to
[1:26:23] reading the Bible yeah he's there to
[1:26:26] influence their thinking because brother
[1:26:28] instead of reading it from the heart
[1:26:30] they're reading it from their heads oh
[1:26:33] god help us they're satisfied with that
[1:26:38] kind of an experience oh yeah they feel
[1:26:41] that's all right I believe God and I
[1:26:43] believe this and I believe that so
[1:26:44] praise the Lord thank you Lord for what
[1:26:45] you did yeah
[1:26:47] what are they gonna do what are we gonna
[1:26:51] do are we gonna do what God wants us to
[1:26:54] do amen or just just stay with the
[1:26:57] letter of the word you know not get into
[1:27:00] the spiritual revelation of it that's
[1:27:02] gonna live it live itself out in you and
[1:27:04] me if God is living the word out through
[1:27:07] you and me a man living it out and it
[1:27:11] can brother sister listen
[1:27:12] oh yeah but the sisters got long here
[1:27:14] and they they got this clothes and all
[1:27:16] that and the brothers got this and the
[1:27:17] mothers got that yeah I know but the
[1:27:21] devil is impersonating yeah he got that
[1:27:24] too but the thing of it is God requires
[1:27:28] more than that or they give you that
[1:27:29] faith for that give you that faith but
[1:27:31] what about rap free faith
[1:27:32] what about resurrection faith are you
[1:27:35] focusing on that many focus on honor
[1:27:38] their hair and their clothing and and
[1:27:40] all in this and that but what about
[1:27:41] focusing on what God wants us to focus
[1:27:43] on the resurrection and the rapture
[1:27:46] again as I said they're going into this
[1:27:48] doctor and then that doctrine where they
[1:27:50] getting into the faith that pleases God
[1:27:53] God wants that gift sure well you can
[1:27:57] add that and go to hell
[1:27:59] sisters gonna have long hair and long
[1:28:01] clothes and go to hell
[1:28:02] her brother can be dressed decently and
[1:28:04] modestly err monastery and go to hell if
[1:28:07] he's not getting into the truth and
[1:28:09] manifesting the faith that God is
[1:28:11] looking for for the resurrection and the
[1:28:13] rapture if there's any were faith that
[1:28:16] Jesus had to come forth with the
[1:28:18] manifest was resurrection and rapture
[1:28:21] what lay his life down pick it up again
[1:28:24] I knowing that to rice with the truth
[1:28:27] the saints of God he will see when he
[1:28:28] laid his life down he knew where he was
[1:28:30] going
[1:28:31] yeah he had to go down and and and talk
[1:28:35] to the devil and defeat the devil to
[1:28:37] take the keys of hell and of death and
[1:28:38] he went over to the Saints they were
[1:28:40] they were in in in that place there and
[1:28:42] the Old Testament Saints that believed
[1:28:45] the Word of God in their day and come on
[1:28:47] now he opened the door let him out
[1:28:49] come on we're going and when he rose
[1:28:52] they rules and they went into the city
[1:28:54] and appeared unto many
[1:28:56] well when the dead in Christ rise now
[1:28:59] they're going to go in and appear to the
[1:29:01] bride the bride occurred about the power
[1:29:04] of God said in any one of his messages
[1:29:06] he said they're going to come to us and
[1:29:08] then he said we'll recognize him no know
[1:29:11] who they are and we'll be will go into a
[1:29:13] glory theophany body and then you do a
[1:29:15] 45 body and then he said we look up and
[1:29:18] there's Jesus and we rise to meet him
[1:29:22] and I believe somewhere he said that
[1:29:24] when we meet the Old Testament Saints or
[1:29:26] nay the New Testament Saints rather that
[1:29:28] are gone on when we need them he said
[1:29:30] we're going to have fellowship with him
[1:29:31] and I believe he mentioned somewhere
[1:29:33] that we left fellowship for around 30 we
[1:29:35] won't be in time but he said around 30
[1:29:37] or 40 days that's what will seem like in
[1:29:39] time and he said well fellowship one
[1:29:41] other in that dimension hallelujah and
[1:29:44] then he said we'll look up and there he
[1:29:47] is
[1:29:48] amen he comes down to get us into that
[1:29:51] dimension then he goes back up into the
[1:29:54] int into the body that's at the right
[1:29:56] hand of the throne of God the body that
[1:29:59] he used to redeem us in and he gets into
[1:30:01] that body again because right now as I
[1:30:05] said where is that body called Jesus
[1:30:07] it's not here it's up it's next to the
[1:30:11] throne of God there's no life in it he
[1:30:14] used that body he gave what he did he
[1:30:16] went up and raptured in that body and he
[1:30:18] put it on under the side of the throne
[1:30:21] of God amen as a token evidence that the
[1:30:25] price was paid amen and then on the day
[1:30:28] of Pentecost he came back down in the
[1:30:30] form of the Holy Ghost amen but now he's
[1:30:34] going back up again and he's going to go
[1:30:36] into that body how do you you and after
[1:30:39] the resurrection rapture he'll come down
[1:30:41] and will rise to meet him praise the
[1:30:43] Lord how did oh yeah amen
[1:30:46] this believe that Jesus is here with us
[1:30:49] and he's in us grace of God God elders
[1:30:54] to believe brothers sister let's not be
[1:30:58] deceived in the teaching that God has
[1:31:00] given us these are the false Christ's
[1:31:04] these are the false prophets
[1:31:06] he said the hair got the true genuine
[1:31:08] anointing but he said they got false
[1:31:10] teaching he said they'll go off here and
[1:31:13] go off there and brother he brings it
[1:31:15] out he down through the Old Testament
[1:31:17] and into the New Testament he brings it
[1:31:20] out Moses was the true and then they
[1:31:22] were and then there was another one
[1:31:23] under the same anointing but false
[1:31:24] teaching then he brings out this one
[1:31:26] amen and we'll we'll highlight those for
[1:31:29] you eventually
[1:31:30] a man and and he brings out this one
[1:31:33] yeah you that was that was a servant of
[1:31:35] God anointed by the God but then there
[1:31:37] was also another one right here oh yeah
[1:31:39] he was under the anointing - but his
[1:31:42] teaching was false huh he might have
[1:31:45] said the Lord said this the Lord said
[1:31:46] that but he'll permit him to go do this
[1:31:49] yeah so brother will bring that out too
[1:31:52] and again it's God it's not the devil it
[1:31:56] was God Satan Satan and influenced them
[1:31:59] in their teaching and there's many a
[1:32:01] preacher today under there under the
[1:32:03] anointing of Malachi 4 and what God has
[1:32:05] done what God is doing well the enemy is
[1:32:07] they'll go so far with the word and the
[1:32:09] message yeah
[1:32:11] but then God wants us to keep on going
[1:32:13] to the place where it will give us faith
[1:32:15] give us resurrection fade wrap through
[1:32:17] faith but the enemy is there to stop us
[1:32:20] demons they're not to put the emphasis
[1:32:22] on that a man to make you content with
[1:32:25] this world dietarily brother if God is
[1:32:28] there he's laying in the worst you're
[1:32:30] not satisfied with this world a man he's
[1:32:33] laying the word so that you're focusing
[1:32:35] on the the world to come you're focusing
[1:32:38] on the kingdom of God and brother I'll
[1:32:40] be honest I'm hungry for the king no God
[1:32:42] I want to get out of here that's the
[1:32:44] truth why in the world what I want to
[1:32:46] stay here much longer for oh well I'll
[1:32:48] do this I'll do this I'll enjoy this no
[1:32:51] but I want to get out of here into the
[1:32:54] kingdom of God with our Lord Jesus
[1:32:56] Christ how many really want to see him I
[1:32:59] really want or even do as the Prophet
[1:33:02] says go up to what climb or crawl up to
[1:33:04] his feet and put your hands on his feet
[1:33:08] how many got that revelation of Jesus
[1:33:10] how many how real is the revelation of
[1:33:15] Jesus to us a me or is he just an
[1:33:18] historical
[1:33:21] yeah oh that's an historical figure
[1:33:24] there that our brother painted Oh
[1:33:29] oh yeah the Bible talks about Jesus the
[1:33:33] Bible says this yeah he says he rose
[1:33:34] again and he ascended and so on but not
[1:33:38] knowing the plan purpose pattern of God
[1:33:41] oh my that preacher and though he was a
[1:33:45] denominational preacher this morning on
[1:33:47] the radio he was bringing out God's plan
[1:33:51] yeah why did God allow this why did God
[1:33:54] do this why is God doing that he said
[1:33:57] it's a reason yeah and I believe he knew
[1:34:01] that it was to bring up what CNES seed
[1:34:03] what city's children yeah you bring it
[1:34:07] out cuz ernie seed oh yeah
[1:34:09] he's preaching he was preaching on that
[1:34:10] but the farmer that went forth sowing
[1:34:12] seed yeah he said see if sowing this
[1:34:15] seed sowing that seed and he said this
[1:34:17] happened to that seed that happened to
[1:34:19] that that happened that seed yeah why he
[1:34:23] said because of the circumstances
[1:34:24] surrounding it and they allowed this and
[1:34:26] they allowed that you allow this and so
[1:34:28] on this is going down that's going down
[1:34:29] but he said then there's the true seed
[1:34:31] or the true seed all right but he said
[1:34:34] is he everything around it is good the
[1:34:37] soil is good the moisture is good hey
[1:34:39] man yeah he said and it's gonna break
[1:34:42] all the rest break he said but not it
[1:34:44] won't produce the fruit yeah it's a
[1:34:49] seeded producing the fruit in you amen
[1:34:53] what fruit is are producing you now I
[1:34:55] just bring you out a denomination no no
[1:34:58] is to bring forth a greater and a
[1:35:00] greater and a greater fro to take his
[1:35:02] home yeah but going back where we come
[1:35:06] from praise the Lord
[1:35:08] again the public God brings out and
[1:35:11] assured this message here another
[1:35:13] message he only had this one yeah when
[1:35:16] he was talking about the fault dr9 ones
[1:35:18] at the end time the anointed ones true
[1:35:21] nineteen's the some got the right
[1:35:25] teaching others got the false and he
[1:35:27] brings it out about the tree that a that
[1:35:30] a brother shoulder man showed him
[1:35:32] oh yeah it was a tree and it had all
[1:35:35] kinds of fruit on it and he said to the
[1:35:39] man he said what kind of a tree is that
[1:35:41] he said it's an orange tree Orange he
[1:35:45] said where did all this fruit come from
[1:35:48] your lemons there's grapefruit there was
[1:35:51] this there was that always said that's
[1:35:52] grafted in Oh grafted in yes he said but
[1:35:57] he said if it brings forth a new branch
[1:35:59] it'll bring forth oranges he said that's
[1:36:02] right he said because it's its original
[1:36:04] folks he didn't think of it is and I've
[1:36:07] drawn here on the board some long time
[1:36:09] ago and what concerning the tree of life
[1:36:12] of good and evil and and the tree of
[1:36:15] knowledge of good and evil on tree of
[1:36:16] life so brother what tree we know well
[1:36:19] God planted the tree of life amen but
[1:36:23] the enemy came in and started to graft
[1:36:25] in this graft in that graft in this but
[1:36:28] where are they getting the life they're
[1:36:32] getting the life from the tree the
[1:36:34] original tree the orange tree so the
[1:36:37] enemy grabs this see and grasped that in
[1:36:39] when it comes to down through the ages
[1:36:41] and religion and so on and in oh yeah
[1:36:44] and they're getting the life from the
[1:36:46] same way we're getting the life
[1:36:48] hallelujah I don't know it the life
[1:36:52] that's reproducing Christ in us amen
[1:36:55] it is positive giving us the faith that
[1:36:57] pleases God but but that's it like
[1:37:00] they're Doya they're getting the same
[1:37:03] life but they're producing the wrong
[1:37:06] fruit amen
[1:37:08] it's not the fruit of the original tree
[1:37:12] now I tell you if we're a part of the
[1:37:14] original tree we're going to produce the
[1:37:16] fruit of it because the Bible tells us
[1:37:19] by their fruit are they known you see
[1:37:24] there are false prophets there are true
[1:37:26] prophets false apostles true apostles
[1:37:28] and he said but they're known by their
[1:37:31] fruit amen praise the Lord I tell you
[1:37:35] brother would their same anointing I'm
[1:37:37] gonna say no any ones at the end time
[1:37:38] they got we all got the same anointing
[1:37:40] but we're bringing forth this fruit and
[1:37:42] they're bringing forth different
[1:37:45] hallelujah the Prophet was bringing it
[1:37:48] out again in the message see he said so
[1:37:52] he said what fruit are you bringing out
[1:37:53] are you bringing out the fruit well look
[1:37:56] what Luther bought it oh that's from the
[1:37:59] original tree wonderful
[1:38:02] well Wesley brother that was from the
[1:38:04] original tree but then after that the
[1:38:06] enemy began to graft in this graft in
[1:38:08] that and it looked like Luther's church
[1:38:12] look like Wesley shirt look like the
[1:38:14] Pentecostal but it's something not
[1:38:15] different not not that it's different
[1:38:17] about it yeah it was something the enemy
[1:38:20] grafted in oh yeah and it's joined life
[1:38:23] from the same tree ho glory they're
[1:38:27] drawing life for the same tree that the
[1:38:30] bride is drawing life from but they're
[1:38:32] not producing the same fruit grace to us
[1:38:36] they see turn with me to Matthew 7 oh my
[1:38:42] I almost been an hour Matthew chapter 7
[1:38:57] and verse 13 and he says enter ye in at
[1:39:08] the strait gate for wide is the gate and
[1:39:12] broad is the way that leadeth to
[1:39:15] destruction and many there be which go
[1:39:18] in thereat because Strait is the gate
[1:39:22] and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[1:39:24] life and to there be that find it
[1:39:28] beware of false prophets which come to
[1:39:34] you in sheep's clothing
[1:39:36] yea look like sheep he said but inwardly
[1:39:41] they are ravening wolves they got the
[1:39:45] spirit of a wolf not the spirit of a
[1:39:48] lamb
[1:39:48] oh yea that's their attitude and there's
[1:39:53] a lot of believers got this got the
[1:39:55] attitude of a wolf not many got the
[1:39:58] attitude of the of the Lamb of God or
[1:40:01] the spirit of a sheep they're different
[1:40:03] oh yeah why she sheep got to be led and
[1:40:09] she looks for leaders yeah but wolves
[1:40:14] they're not interested in a leader no so
[1:40:19] beware of false prophets which come to
[1:40:21] you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[1:40:24] they are ravening wolves that's their
[1:40:28] attitude spirit ye shall know them by
[1:40:33] their fruits
[1:40:35] amen see were they grafted into the tree
[1:40:40] are they part of the original tree many
[1:40:44] are grafted in and by their fruits you
[1:40:46] know well that's not bright they're
[1:40:48] grafted in but they're identified as
[1:40:52] bright they want to believe they're
[1:40:54] bright identifying with the message
[1:40:56] identifying with the revealed word oh
[1:40:58] yeah but they're not bright why by their
[1:41:01] fruits you'll know them by their spirit
[1:41:04] and their attitude you know them by
[1:41:06] their actions and reactions you know
[1:41:09] oh they don't have a simple they don't
[1:41:11] have a humble spirit like Jesus a Jesus
[1:41:16] always said he could have called ten
[1:41:17] thousand angels destroyed the world set
[1:41:19] him free well he could have called just
[1:41:21] one angel to help him he could have
[1:41:24] called this one and he could have done
[1:41:25] that to Pilate or Pharaoh or the leader
[1:41:29] or there are the Jews the read the
[1:41:32] scribes and the Pharisees no he didn't
[1:41:36] do it why because he loved you it was
[1:41:42] his love for you that he endured just
[1:41:45] thing it wasn't him wasn't it sin no he
[1:41:50] bore your sins and mine he was perfect
[1:41:54] thank God for his love he said you shall
[1:42:04] know them by their fruits
[1:42:06] well what's the fruit of the anointing
[1:42:08] of a true son of God he gonna have the
[1:42:11] true teaching of God by the Word of God
[1:42:13] to give us the faith that pleases God
[1:42:14] and if and if it's a false anointed one
[1:42:18] he got the writ he got the anointing but
[1:42:20] a false teaching that's true anointing
[1:42:21] but a false teaching you know you should
[1:42:26] know them by their fruits
[1:42:28] and he said do men gather grapes of
[1:42:30] thorns or figs of thistles even so every
[1:42:35] good tree bringeth forth good fruit but
[1:42:38] a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
[1:42:41] amen brother
[1:42:44] what fruit are we bringing forth in our
[1:42:47] day-to-day living in our attitudes in
[1:42:50] our actions in our reactions what's the
[1:42:52] fruit that you bury are we laying down
[1:42:56] our lives for one another as Jesus lay
[1:42:59] down his life for us grace to us
[1:43:04] no one is coming to policy
[1:43:07] disappointments at the judgment yeah and
[1:43:10] you'd be surprised who made it and who
[1:43:14] didn't make it now graces mine prayer
[1:43:22] but at the grace of God brother just let
[1:43:31] me come to a conclusion with some
[1:43:34] thoughts by the Prophet concerning the
[1:43:36] anointed ones at the end time no doubt I
[1:43:42] have read the book I've heard the tape
[1:43:46] I've made notes but it never struck me
[1:43:49] as it did this time again that's why
[1:43:55] that I've got so many different colors
[1:43:56] and I lighted this
[1:43:57] underlined it and then I've I light it
[1:44:00] with this color that color another color
[1:44:02] each time that I read you know and it
[1:44:06] struck me different and I said Oh Lord
[1:44:07] this is serious
[1:44:10] and it's ever a revelation that we need
[1:44:13] to deal with its The Anointed once at
[1:44:16] the end time we need this
[1:44:17] oh yeah the seven seals or the mystery
[1:44:19] of God there's the mystery of God but
[1:44:21] listen all that God wanted us to have
[1:44:23] and all that God wants to hear and know
[1:44:26] wasn't revealed when brother venom
[1:44:29] preached the seven seals or the seven
[1:44:33] church ages Orca or the seven trumpets
[1:44:37] and so on no no because even after he
[1:44:41] preached the seals he preached a certain
[1:44:43] message and he said this is another
[1:44:44] revelation on the seals
[1:44:46] I believe that brother there's a number
[1:44:50] of messages that he preached after 1963
[1:44:52] that was another revelation on the
[1:44:55] mystery of the revealed word and the
[1:44:59] anointing was at the end time is one of
[1:45:02] those revelations he didn't bring it out
[1:45:05] in the seven seals he didn't bring it
[1:45:07] out during the church ages but now
[1:45:09] nearing the end of his ministry a man
[1:45:13] he's bringing out the seriousness
[1:45:16] of false and ninety ones and now a that
[1:45:20] to deceit of false anointed ones grace
[1:45:26] and he said what could I say
[1:45:34] he said I'm feeling really definitely
[1:45:37] led to preach he said on the seven last
[1:45:42] miles in the Bible and now he says so
[1:45:46] that we won't be too long on a great
[1:45:49] lesson this morning he said I have
[1:45:51] sought the Lord he said thinking a man
[1:45:55] is not his own ideas it's God's and he
[1:46:00] said what could I say knowing that this
[1:46:03] may be our last service that we'll have
[1:46:05] her have he said why because the coming
[1:46:08] of the Lord is so close a taint how
[1:46:14] close is it now grace I pray in the name
[1:46:18] of Jesus under a false anointing that
[1:46:21] we're not going to be deceived
[1:46:25] yeah and failed to recommend yeah be
[1:46:31] deceived and why missed the rapture and
[1:46:35] will be left here to say where's the
[1:46:37] rapture oh it's already happened and you
[1:46:41] didn't know it why didn't know it we got
[1:46:47] there oh I was anointed I felt 19 with
[1:46:50] this and ninety with that yeah but you
[1:46:52] went off to a false teaching you didn't
[1:46:55] get into the true anointing that would
[1:46:57] bring you to the original the
[1:46:58] resurrection and rapture and give you a
[1:47:00] resurrection and rapture in faith they
[1:47:03] gave you faith to believe that God sent
[1:47:05] a prophet it gave you faith to believe
[1:47:07] that the seals were open and the
[1:47:09] mysteries revealed give you faith to
[1:47:11] believe this concerning the church ages
[1:47:12] but you didn't catch the revelation that
[1:47:15] the rapture was on the resurrection was
[1:47:19] already in progress
[1:47:21] oh yeah yeah I've in 65 and number of
[1:47:26] times he's highlighted the fact that the
[1:47:28] rapture is is ongoing
[1:47:30] the rapture is going on now but when is
[1:47:34] it going to come to a climax pray God
[1:47:38] that we're not going to miss it and ask
[1:47:40] where's the rapture get into the spirit
[1:47:44] stay in the spirit living the spirit
[1:47:46] walk in the spirit a man and be led by
[1:47:49] the word that the spirit the Holy Ghost
[1:47:51] is redeeming not the false anointed once
[1:47:57] he said the coming of the Lord is so
[1:48:00] close at hand he said I see that
[1:48:04] prediction made in California sure
[1:48:07] there's houses out there and places
[1:48:09] sinking at the rate of 30 inches an hour
[1:48:11] he September's cracking and breaking in
[1:48:14] we're at the end well even now in
[1:48:20] California as I said they're building
[1:48:22] walls if their houses are built near the
[1:48:25] near the ocean they're building walls
[1:48:27] with brick brick walls behind arouses
[1:48:30] why because little by little the water
[1:48:33] is coming in to the land
[1:48:37] yeah and what is it it's because that
[1:48:41] there is a crack that has gone up
[1:48:43] through California it's there they know
[1:48:49] that they know that they've known that
[1:48:51] for years and they said well it could
[1:48:54] happen now or could happen down the road
[1:48:55] scientists were saying you know they
[1:48:57] didn't know but the scientists still
[1:49:00] believe that California is going under
[1:49:02] but God through the prophet said it was
[1:49:04] going under yeah and and that crack is
[1:49:08] there I know that even even I would say
[1:49:10] once they the country a foreign country
[1:49:12] that sent over those ships and
[1:49:17] submarines and they went underneath
[1:49:19] California why because California is not
[1:49:23] like Newfoundland deer where it just
[1:49:25] goes out out into the ocean honored
[1:49:27] under the ocean
[1:49:28] no the land goes out here but when you
[1:49:30] go underneath California in a submarine
[1:49:32] you can go underneath it in the water
[1:49:36] because California is is calm
[1:49:40] so that's why it's gonna break and fall
[1:49:43] into the ocean because there's nothing
[1:49:44] there to hold it up oh yeah those
[1:49:48] submarines went in there and they were
[1:49:49] surprised to think that they could go
[1:49:51] under California in a submarine and go
[1:49:54] around and I believe brother's going to
[1:49:57] go all the way from California right on
[1:49:59] up to the other state and go on there
[1:50:02] and I believe it's going to affect even
[1:50:04] even the Vancouver British Columbia well
[1:50:07] I believe that no no way
[1:50:10] god help us he said it's sinking at a
[1:50:15] rate of 30 inches an hour and Timbers
[1:50:18] cracking and breaking in and they don't
[1:50:20] know what's doing it but we are at the
[1:50:23] end now he said I have decided and I
[1:50:27] felt led by the Holy Spirit to speak
[1:50:29] this morning on prophecy to inform us
[1:50:34] and the Holy Spirit has given to us to
[1:50:37] warn the people of the coming it's a
[1:50:41] warning so let this message be a warning
[1:50:46] to us if there's ever an hour that we're
[1:50:49] experiencing false teaching false
[1:50:51] christs and false prophecies this hour
[1:50:53] it is beyond your Girt and again let me
[1:50:59] say it again and again and again and no
[1:51:02] wonder is the Bible told us make your
[1:51:04] calling and election sure if there's
[1:51:07] that deception anyway you've got to make
[1:51:11] your calling and election sure make sure
[1:51:13] not you're just under the anointing make
[1:51:15] sure you're under the right word they're
[1:51:19] teaching what for to give you
[1:51:21] resurrection
[1:51:22] Rattray faith because that's what God
[1:51:25] wants to do amen
[1:51:28] God brought Luther under lien under the
[1:51:30] anointing amen
[1:51:32] then he gave him the faith of the
[1:51:35] justification yeah I tell you it changed
[1:51:39] Luther oh really a diocesan right from
[1:51:43] the inside of the inside he changed the
[1:51:46] burden that was there was gone oh yeah
[1:51:49] he would wondering about this one day
[1:51:51] with that it was all gone thank you lord
[1:51:53] thank you
[1:51:54] they meant and how did where did he get
[1:51:56] it as I said he did this he did that all
[1:52:00] he thought he had to do this all he had
[1:52:02] to do that to be justified you know do
[1:52:04] this for God do that for God do this
[1:52:06] forgotten so finally you know where he
[1:52:08] went into the church and the Bible was
[1:52:10] in the porch could they never read the
[1:52:13] Bible was like they do today
[1:52:14] no the Bible was in the porch of the
[1:52:17] church and he went over started reading
[1:52:19] the Bible and it's and he read
[1:52:23] concerning justification justified by
[1:52:25] Christ
[1:52:26] faith in our Lord Jesus Christ oh it
[1:52:30] struck him the Holy Ghost was there to
[1:52:34] give him the revelation and a nursery
[1:52:36] put down only or alone he wrote he wrote
[1:52:40] it on the Bible brother grace that will
[1:52:47] come back to the word a man concerning
[1:52:50] the rapture and the resurrection I show
[1:52:54] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[1:52:57] we shall all be changed and he said bear
[1:53:07] with me
[1:53:10] he said I show you a mystery we shall
[1:53:12] not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:53:14] changed
[1:53:15] talk about believers he said in a moment
[1:53:19] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:53:24] Trump that's referring to 1st
[1:53:27] Thessalonians 4:16
[1:53:29] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:53:33] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:53:36] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:53:41] hallelujah grace that God is going to
[1:53:46] make that faith as he did to Luther oh
[1:53:51] yeah it'll strike us as justification
[1:53:54] struck Luther a man as sanctification
[1:53:57] strong Wesley the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:59] Ghost the gifts of the Spirit struck the
[1:54:01] Pentecostals this is the crowning of the
[1:54:05] Pentecostal message where at the end he
[1:54:12] said I have decided I felt led by the
[1:54:14] Holy Spirit to speak this money on
[1:54:16] prophecy to kind of inform us and he
[1:54:20] said I have not informed and anything
[1:54:22] happens just casually we should know
[1:54:24] about this we should know about this and
[1:54:27] he said this Holy Spirit he said has
[1:54:30] given to it to us to warn the people of
[1:54:33] the comings the comings
[1:54:35] you know the Bible said that God will do
[1:54:38] nothing except first he shows his
[1:54:40] servants the prophets and now that jesus
[1:54:43] warned the people what would take place
[1:54:45] and now that the prophets warned the
[1:54:48] people what that would take place and it
[1:54:51] behooves us now in the great hour that
[1:54:55] we are living in he said what's going to
[1:54:59] happen in this age he says so one of
[1:55:01] these strange subjects he said that
[1:55:04] perhaps we have read many times and he
[1:55:07] said I fell upon my heart to speak to
[1:55:09] the people about it this morning and he
[1:55:12] said it's going to be a Bible teaching
[1:55:14] and like a Sunday School
[1:55:19] and he said I've got many scriptures
[1:55:21] written down here that you might be able
[1:55:23] to put these down and go home and study
[1:55:26] them and he said that we might know and
[1:55:30] be warned they might know and be warned
[1:55:34] and prepared for the hours that we're
[1:55:37] living in oh well we think all we need
[1:55:41] is the opening the seven seals all we
[1:55:44] need is over the series under Revelation
[1:55:46] 10 or the church ages no no there's more
[1:55:51] to it one thing to know what God has
[1:55:55] done another thing to know why he did it
[1:55:59] why did he do it I know you did this nor
[1:56:02] do I know you do that you did you did
[1:56:04] you did yeah but why did I do it oh well
[1:56:08] you better get back into it and find out
[1:56:09] why I did it what I'm looking for
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:18] he said that we might know and that we
[1:56:21] might be warned and prepared for the
[1:56:24] hour that we are living in and that's
[1:56:28] when the prophet of God went in and he
[1:56:30] read a scripture we recently considered
[1:56:32] number of times Matthew 24
[1:56:35] concerning there shall arise false
[1:56:38] Christ's false prophets and shall show
[1:56:41] great signs and wonders in so much that
[1:56:44] ever were possible they shall deceive
[1:56:46] the very elect what is it it is man
[1:56:50] following man not following God and
[1:56:56] there's a lot of believers following me
[1:56:58] they're following this ministry that
[1:57:00] ministry that ministry oh we love this
[1:57:03] ministry we love that man yeah you
[1:57:05] better make sure you're following Jesus
[1:57:08] amen make sure that he's revealing
[1:57:10] Christ to you and he said I believe that
[1:57:16] we are living in the end time and we are
[1:57:19] now at the end of the history of the
[1:57:20] world and there will be no use of
[1:57:23] writing it history because there won't
[1:57:26] be anybody to read it it's at the end of
[1:57:28] time and just when I do not know just
[1:57:31] how long it will be not even the angels
[1:57:33] of ever know he said they don't know
[1:57:36] that minute or hour but we have been
[1:57:38] told by the Lord Jesus that when these
[1:57:41] things that we see now begin to come to
[1:57:44] pass he's to lift up your heads for our
[1:57:47] redemption is drawing nigh
[1:57:50] what else does God have to do to get us
[1:57:53] to look up what else does God have to
[1:57:56] reveal to us to get us to focus on
[1:57:59] resurrection and rapture in faith god
[1:58:02] help us how many of us already believe
[1:58:06] in the invisible union of the heavenly
[1:58:10] bridegroom and the earthly bride not
[1:58:13] that we're not we're not going to a
[1:58:14] marriage we're going to a marriage
[1:58:16] supper we're married here by the grace
[1:58:20] of God so there's an invisible union of
[1:58:23] a heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:58:25] right how many are bringing forth the
[1:58:28] life of one
[1:58:29] with Christ how many are bringing for
[1:58:32] the life of the bridegroom not me make
[1:58:38] your calling and election sure he said
[1:58:47] listen he says your redemption is
[1:58:50] drawing nigh and he said what drawing
[1:58:53] nigh means I do not know he said it may
[1:58:57] mean as the scientist said concerning
[1:58:59] California and so on
[1:59:00] oh he said it could be a minute it could
[1:59:04] be five minutes he said they didn't know
[1:59:06] when it was going to happen but they
[1:59:08] felt it was drawing nigh
[1:59:10] it was drawing nigh then it's drawing
[1:59:13] nigh now so the god of grace be with us
[1:59:16] brother that we're not going to be
[1:59:18] deceived by false Christ's and false
[1:59:21] prophets a false teaching
[1:59:24] Amen oh yeah a true anointing but a
[1:59:27] false teaching and they can do signs and
[1:59:31] wonders oh yeah I cut theirs ministries
[1:59:33] out there preaching Trinity the
[1:59:34] Trinity's there preaching false baptisms
[1:59:37] false this false that oh yeah
[1:59:39] and have signs and wonders yeah I could
[1:59:44] highlight a number of evangelists said
[1:59:46] that I would that I was as well and
[1:59:49] certain to extent i supported and
[1:59:52] highlighted back maybe fifty years ago
[1:59:55] it's hard to believe that it's been that
[1:59:57] long since I've been in the message oh
[1:59:58] yeah
[1:59:59] and all the Adventists that Rhonda seen
[2:00:01] then with signs and wonders yet their
[2:00:04] preaching was contrary to the word but
[2:00:07] the anointing was there to do this the
[2:00:10] anointing was there to do that but false
[2:00:12] teaching of the word will we'll have to
[2:00:15] leave it there and the Lord willing see
[2:00:18] as the Lord brings us back maybe on
[2:00:20] Wednesday to continue and to bring her
[2:00:23] some thoughts concerning the false
[2:00:26] Christ's and false prophets because many
[2:00:30] many believe oh they're not real dirt
[2:00:32] they got a fall so ninety No thank God
[2:00:35] for the Prophet he says they got a true
[2:00:38] genuine anointing but a false teaching
[2:00:42] so god help us brother just thing and
[2:00:45] that's that's not out there that's
