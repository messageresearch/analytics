it's not exactly the way I would have anticipated it if somebody said I was going to preach them but I'm certainly appreciative to brother Gerald for the invitation appreciate Matt taking the time to work out the technology and kind of get us all synched up here most people don't realize how much work goes into something like this especially the first time so I'm just trusting that all will go well and we've got everything synched up if you'll turn in your scriptures this evening to revelations chapter 12 again it's just it's good to be here I I talked to brother at hammer Meister who sends his greens and I said brother head we're gonna have a meeting in the air and I don't have the new body yet but it certainly need to be able to take part in this with each one of you here tonight amen revelations chapter 12 let's just read one scripture here for revelation 12 verse 11 it says and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful Lord for the price that you paid the Lord in this night two thousand years ago you took our sins Lord you shed your blood for us and we're so thankful Lord that we have Lord that sacrifice that takes our place Lord Lord for the pain and the agony that you willingly took on yourself and Lord now as we Minister we pray that you would just touch your people Lord strengthen them for battle Lord we pray that you would just anchor something to new in our hearts we pray in your name we ask and pray amen amen god bless you is maybe a bit of an odd scripture to take for a Friday night you know Good Friday but even especially speaking to the Bride of Christ this isn't really a scripture that applies to us necessarily because we know that this is after the rapture goes up and this is when Satan is cast down and this speaks of the red dragon the old serpent that is has been standing before God and he's been accusing the Brethren before God but at this time we go up in a rapture and he's kicked down and he comes down in all of his rage and he takes his wrath out on the earth and we know that these are the Saints that didn't have the seal of the Holy Spirit and the different ones and they give their lives for the for the gospel amen but I wanted to maybe take a little nugget out of this this evening because we if there's one thing I've noticed in Scripture it's that God has a pattern in things and if he does a thing once then he does it all the way through and he doesn't change that pattern and I know brother Branham touched on this many times and he uses a scripture in many different ways according to what the bride has need of not just those tribulation scenes I want to pull a quote here from 1959 and the message what here's style Elijah where he says by the blood of the Lamb and their testimony they overcame is that right he says you overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by your testimony if we can just have faith and believe in the Lord God that he will do these things for us amen God sets a requirement and we know that it's impossible for us to meet it but we also know that God if he gives the requirement he gives the remedy and so we see here that brother Branham says you overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by your testimony amen and then he goes on into the Ephesian Church age and he says but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word I don't want you to catch that if he would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then was Satan foiled what when he lived by it not just when he talked about it not just when he believed it but when he lived by it then was Satan boil for here was one who lived by it is written and that masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's Word catch that now he's not just saying it but he's reflecting it then this manifested perfect one was given to the cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we buy him and become of him might eat of the Tree of Life and then that tree would of life would freely be given and would enable us to overcome and express the Word of God catch say he says it would be freely grib given to enable us to overcome and express the Word of God and now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant fellowship of Jesus Christ amen the constant fellowship we have continuous access to Christ there will never be no more any separation from him whither he goes his bride will go where he is his he shares with his beloved on a joint their relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him he says this is the heritage of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ amen that's out of the ephesian church age tonight so tonight I want to speak on the overcomers path amen and we know there's been six ages in the past and there's been over comers in each and every one of those ages but we're in a 7th agent and we're coming out of that seven days I'd argue we've come out of it but when this age we have an instruction we have a message we have an anointing that's going to take us into a rapture amen if we'll just hold on to what the angel for our age said amen we know this is an age where somebody is going to sit on the throne and I want to be one of those ones that sits on that throne tonight amen I want to be an overcomer in this age I don't want to be somebody that's maybe just sitting on the side they're wounded and bloody and so beat-up that they can't do anything but I want to be an overcomer that has what they I don't want to be mistaken for somebody that didn't do anything I don't want to be mistaken for somebody that didn't go into the battle somebody that's so beat up that they're of no use amen and I don't believe that's what we're called to be in this age I believe we're called to be an overcomer that can confidently walk into heaven and say I made it not just by the skin of my teeth amen but by the blood of the Lamb and by the testimony of the word that he's given to us amen I want to have victory over everything that Satan throws at us I want my wife to be an overcomer and my children to be an overcomer in these different ones amen I want Satan to say oh no not him again when God sends me down a path that gonna cause a conflict with him they men clean them but I know I'm not gonna do that in my own strength I know I'm not gonna be able to do that in my own discipline in my own thoughts and my own ideas this is something that's gonna have to be supernatural because the overcoming we're talking about here is absolutely supernatural which means we're gonna have to have a supernatural influence we're gonna have to have a supernatural anointing we're gonna have to have a supernatural life that supersedes anything that we would ever have in our own self amen so let's just start to break this down and just keep your your your page there on revelation 12:11 it says and they overcame now we know what it means to overcome I'm gonna read the quote that we all know by heart I'm sure by now but maybe for the sake of the young people that might not remember it brother Bram said this and the message how can I overcome he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he says lots of people says there's no devil it's just a thought he said now don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him amen and by His grace you are more than a match for him amen there's real overcoming when you recognize him and not just recognize what Satan's trying to do but recognize that you have the victory inside of you if you have the Holy Spirit in that Amen but I want you to notice it's not enough to recognize God in others it's so easy to say well when brother so-and-so prays then people get healed and when sister so-and-so goes into a prayer closet then things change that's not what we're looking for that's great that we can see that in somebody else but we want to see it in our own selves amen we want this to be a bride why'd overcoming its individual - each of us but the entire bride has to overcome Amen this is a personal overcoming for each and every one of us and you look at maybe David or Joshua or Elijah these different ones and you say wow those were amazing overcomers they did such tremendous things in their life but I was listening or reading what brother Jason Walken said the other day but each and every one of them pointed forward to the time where we're at now as if that is the greatest moment as if that is the time where everything would be overcome amen look what Paul wrote in the Hebrews in chapter 13 verse 39 he says speaking of all these men he says and women he says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect day men he said God having provided some better thing for us so what we see today is an opportunity for each and every one of us to live in an overcoming way with more power and more authority and more victory in their lives than anybody's experience since the first church age amen and this is the only group that will go in a rapture we know a group obviously we've had individuals that went up and Elijah in these different ones but this is the first time where we will see a group of people that will not see death amen what a tremendous time that we live in now Revelation 12:11 says and they overcame who him now we already know who this is we know that this is Satan that was cast down the the Red Dragon the accuser of the Brethren and we know that Satan's the furthest you can get from God there's nothing of God in him he is the the Anti God if you will there's no desire in him that is worth having and all he is is a jealous envious personality amen and so we know though that the human that humanity has an empty part inside of them brother BAM talked about this he says there's a little spot inside you that's meant for God and every human has and that's why they thirst for these different things and they're trying these different things to try and fulfill that but brother Branham also said only the believer can truly have God inside of them and accept Christ fully into their life they meant but I think one thing we have to step back and see and we'll get into this now for a bit is that we have a bigger him and we have a bigger her that has to be defeated in this age they men to him if you're a man of her if you're a woman if it's not obviously men so often we're looking externally for the enemy and we're looking at the world and we're looking at entertainment and we're looking at politics and we're looking at all these different things that we're facing but really what we're facing is an internal battle a man the one that we have to overcome as ourselves because when Satan attacks you he's coming at you through certain portals and channels and we know that we're still in our carnal flesh we still know that that those five outward senses and the five inner senses those are not redeemed those are not subject to to the the new birth that we get amen and so because of that we have to have those in constant battle against us it's the only way it's going to happen you have God on the inside and then everything else outside of that is not sanctified Amen it's not redeemed it can't be redeemed that's why we need a new body when we go amen so the victory we have to overcome is what the carnal man the carnal desires the carnal thinking that the carnal plans that all of these things all have to be brought into subjection Amen brother Brahim said this in the inner Vail he says and a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's like completely overcome who he says himself that's the biggest enemy you got is yourself that's the reason you can't rise up in faith he says because you got intellectuals there your intellectual part says well this or that he says it's a reasoning we want to cast down reasonings the Bible tells us men so he talks about our intellect getting in the way that the carnal mind amen that's not the mind of Christ but that's the way we think we think of impossibilities of situations amen but he says you've got to get past that and that intellect is going to be the first thing that steps up against your faith in the message how can I overcome he says the thing you have to overcome is yourself he says your idea your thinking and surrender yourself to him and now this is the beautiful part he says he overcome for you he knows the way we don't amen and that's what we have to recognize is that we're trying to make our way through life and he's the only one that's ever overcome all the way through to full victory amen and he's trying to lead us and guide us into full victory amen Paul talks about this very struggle in the book of Romans chapter 7 a man he says in verse 18 for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not Paul says I want to do good but I can't find the strength to do it for the good that I would I do not but the evil that I would not that I do so he wants to do good and he doesn't do and then he doesn't want to do evil and then he does it he says now if I do that which I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God effort there after the inward man he says inside I've got the Holy Spirit and that has the right desires but I've still got this outer man that I'm struggling with day in and day out he says but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death and they says but I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin amen but I'm so glad that Paul doesn't leave us hanging there that wretched sinful on Victorious man amen if he stopped there how unhappy we would be but now he jumps right into Chapter eight with these wonderful words and he says there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh see Paul when he was talking about that yes he's acknowledging the struggle but he says look there is a way and we can come past that that struggle is real he said but in the old man I couldn't overcome even when Paul would have been back under the law you know as a Pharisee of Pharisees he wouldn't have been able to overcome he'd be sitting there and he'd be trying to do all the little things that they did but he knew that there was still no victory in that but then he says now through Christ Jesus I have a victory that I couldn't get before and there's no way that I'm gonna fail amen he says that God has given us the victory through what Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he said for what the sin for what law could not do verse three for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen do we walk in the spirit for they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God Brit is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit amen if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he have not he is none of his and a Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you amen hallelujah Paul takes the wretchedness completely out of the situation and slides us right into that victorious mind say Amen I don't know if I mentioned my topic did I give my okay I did do I wasn't sure if I did all right we're okay amen listen to what brother Branham says in the former and latter rain he says speaking of the Spirit building Spirit led overcoming life he says the overcomer one that's overcome the world has overcome self and overcome pride I'll make him the Morningstar what does it do I'll shine him up and set him up there so that I by my incoming power will reflect my own presence in the darkness he that overcomes will I give the Morningstar that's what's the Morningstar set there for he says to reflect the sun's coming what is the Morningstar it's the sun shining against it reflecting the presence of the coming of the Sun it's the brightest thing in heaven the brightest thing in heaven ought to be today and is today the minister now it doesn't stop there with the minister he says or the Christian or the spirit filled man or that's so filled with the holy spirit till he's forsaken the world and everything and God is reflecting his life coming through him warning the world that the approaching som is at hand he says oh what an hour a man Paul is pointing us to a place where we walk in the spirit we talk in the spirit we live in the spirit we vacation in the spirit we go to our work in the spirit we pray in the spirit why so that there's a surrender life so full of the Holy Ghost so that Satan has no room to enter and then he comes in he starts looking at little cracks and chinks and trying to push his way in and the Holy Spirit or lecture says hey no room for you and here go find somebody else to to bother amen continuing revelation 12:11 it says they overcame him how by the blood of the Lamb amen and this is the starting point for every believer and I thought this was appropriate given the sacrifice that we know Christ made this evening 2000 years ago is that under the blood of the lamb is where every single believer has to start amen you never want to straight from the blood because it's proof what of your atonement it's proof that the price has been paid for your sin it's proof that Christ has taken away everything that Satan could come against you with to accuse you amen without the blood we're still condemned I heard a minister say a while ago we said the bride doesn't need the blood because she has a wedding certificate well that's well and good but amen we're still on this earth we still have a carnal body we still have senses that are not subject to the inner man we're still fighting against those amen and so we know that it has to be under the blood day in and day out and I know brother barque preached quite a bit on the blood a while ago so I won't go into that too deeply amen but I just want to say if you're out from under that blood if you say that I've got something that means I don't mean the blood while I'm still here then you're out from under the scriptures amen Ephesians 1 verse essent in whom we have redemption through his blood and the forgiveness of sins so we have redemption and forgiveness of sins through the blood according to the riches of His grace in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise so we see the blood now takes you to the Holy Spirit of promise but listen to verse 14 here it says which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession amen so this mean redemption isn't fully completed yet we're still here our bodies haven't been redeemed our souls haven't been redeemed over to that other side the blood therefore has to be in effect and is in effect until we take a body change amen so he says the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession that's us unto the praise of his glory listen to what brother Branham says and God hasn't provided way he says and that's the way it is today believer stays under the blood that's right it's the only place to stay a safety all right he said the blood cause separation between believer and unbeliever because the blood packs life the life is in the blood and the believer stays in the blood which brings him life eternal he says and now when Israel come over the land of the river of Jordan he says now trying to catch this so let's try and catch it he said when Israel crossed over into the land the promised land there was a Gentile woman that we know as Rahab the harlot and she asked for mercy and she did receive mercy she received mercy as long as she stayed under that scarlet cord and that's the only way she could have mercy it was a sign a token that was given to her he says we have a token today also and we're safe as long as we stay under our scarlet cord the blood of Jesus Christ he says as an individual not as a group an individual we must stay under that scarlet court of the blood of Jesus Christ amen that's 1963 in the message why little Bethlehem which is after the seals if it matters to anybody amen so that's the starting place for the overcomer you have to be under the blood you have to be covered in that because why that's the only way that Christ can atone for you is if you're under that bloody men the Scriptures clearly showing brother Branham hammers is time and time again that this the believer has to be the sinner has to be identified with the sacrifice they men you had to have the blood over your house you had to have the blood over your hands you had to have it over your life and all that pertained to you it had to be under that blood and they didn't just get to sacrifice that lamb and walked away they had to have that blood on them amen listen to what brother branham says in the message to Tolkien he says what a beautiful picture he says the redeemed see justice had been met and the requirement of God's holy justice had been met God said now I'll require your life he says and then when the life had sinned so whoever Cindy says I'm going to require your life he says then an innocent substitute took its place and it was a blood beast not an apple or a peach he said that absolutely ought to make the Serpent's seed so plain to everybody that it was blood and this blood which could not come out of fruit came out of an innocent substitute and the life had gone out - in his place and the blood was a symbol that the beast had died and the blood has gone out and the worshiper applying the blood over himself showed that he was identified in the redemption because he has identified himself with the sacrifice connected himself to the sacrifice and the blood stood for the token how wonderful he says what a picture it is it's a perfect type of Christ just exactly the believer today standing under the shed blood identified with the sacrifice just as perfect as it can be of how that Christ not being an animal you see the animal died the most anything innocent thing we have I suppose would be the lamb but when God wanted to identify Jesus Christ he identified him as the lamb the lamb is the most innocent and pure of all the animal body but this was the perfect lamb Christ was and then through the shed blood of this lamb the natural lamb and Egypt the blood was applied and when it was it stood for a token he said then what would the blood of this lamb capital L this lamb stand for he said see the token that we are dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice see then the lamb and the blood and the person becomes identified together the sacrifice and the believer so you are identified in your life by your sacrifice I want you to catch that you are identified in your life by your sacrifice that makes you what you are a man notice how brother Brown ties the blood and the token together and then in the in in Egypt the blood was applied to what make the death angel Passover the home but today our token is the holy spirit so it's not the is not our token today in the same way it was back then but brother Brahim ties the blood to the token it's and he says the blood covers us what and makes us clean in the eyes of God why because then he can take us on to the Holy Ghost and that's our ticket to heaven that's our token a mint that's our seal approval that God has accepted us brother Bram tied the two together why he says that blood has the life and it stands for or it represents or it points to the token which is the light so the blood has the light that points to the token which is the life that comes out of that blood he said which also includes being dead to ourselves so you have the blood which has life in it when that blood is shed the life now comes into what the the life of the Holy Spirit it's a token that we can take on ourselves that's our eternal life and then that is only given to you when you've died to yourself they meant so just as the natural blood of the lamb was an answer to the natural law now you get the supernatural blood of Jesus Christ that comes and fulfills the law and in that therefore we have what a new covenant of grace see back in the old day that lamb it didn't satisfy indefinitely I'd say it kind of kicked the sin can down the road right because the the land sacrifice in under the law was only good for one year why because it wasn't a like-for-like transaction it was a lamb taking the place of a man and that animal didn't have the choice the lamb didn't choose to give its life the lamb didn't say yes I'm the one that wants to be identified with Jonathan corlett sins for this year and I'll give my life for him no it was chosen by the man it was given not of its own free will it was forced to give its life and so what it just kicked the can down the road and so that sin can is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger think of the the pilgrims progress what does he have he has this huge backpack on his back of what all the sins of his life gathered together and it's not until he comes to the cross he said all sorts of people tell him they can take care of it it but it's not until he comes to the cross that that thing drops away amen so then what did we get we had Christ comes and he sheds his blood on the cross how willingly right he's in the garden of semmen his brother mark talked about there and he's and we sang about and he says not my will but thine be done he willingly settles into the sacrifice of his own life and he takes that agonizing death on himself willingly so that he could satisfy the same question forever because when he doesn't now it's a like-for-like transaction it's a man that's why he had to come as a man was because a man had to take the sins of all mankind and the only way he could do it was if he was perfect sinless spotless the way the natural lambs were and if he took it willingly and that was the battle in Gethsemane was would he take it willingly and he did he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done and he he humbled himself to that amen so then what happens remember brother Bram says you're not just identified by your sacrifice but you're identified with your sacrifice meaning that whatever your sacrifice had that's now yours and whatever you had is now his so when Christ dies amen his identity become sinful it becomes lost it becomes worthless it becomes unholy and unrighteous amen and that's what he takes and that's why he had to die because he had all of those sins on top of him right God couldn't accept him in his presence in that way so he dies and he takes it he's completely abandoned that's the last thing he says on the cross right aside from it is finished she says my God my God why have you forsaken me why because qog couldn't be associated with that body anymore so he died what a man sinful amen but what a glorious thought now that what he was we become so he's become us but now we become righteous and then we become his life we become his nature we become his characteristics and all of that now has identified as us so now we become Christ and he becomes us and we have this beautiful picture now where what we get to be him and now you can look at us and we should be able to look at ourselves and say I am Christ why because that's what the transaction was about was giving us who he was and taking our side back on himself they men that's why the overcoming starts with the lamb the blood of the Lamb because you can't be just identified with him you have to be identified as him you have to be identified amen as the sacrifice that was given for you it meant Galatians 2:19 says for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen Paul points us back to the cross where Christ shed his blood for us and that's the place where we receive real life brother banner or the the scripture talks about when that blood comes out and there's a separation of water and these different things what it's signifying that the life comes out of that and it's now available to every believer amen but not only that but as I talked about earlier we now have continuous access to Christ that's what happened we see the veil was torn when he dies and now we have continues access why because we're no longer simple we're no longer abandoned were no longer unrighteous and unholy but because we're identified as our sacrifice now we get to enter into his presence because he's put himself on us and we're identified as Christ himself amen so now when Satan comes knocking at our door what's he doing he's trying to say you never took he never took your place he's saying that stuff that you did maybe you did it yesterday it doesn't matter maybe you did it today and he's saying hey look at what you're doing you can't be a son of God you can't be this you can't enter in you can't do that and what do you have to do you say go point to my sacrifice go talk to Jesus Christ because he's the one that took all of that I'm not responsible for that anymore amen I've repented I've accepted the shed blood of the Lamb and because of that you're talking to the wrong person it's not identified with me anymore it's identified with him amen look what Paul says as he continues in Romans 8 because Paul gives us what an admonition here not to be identified and bound by accusations against us Romans 8 verse 31 now this is the chapter that starts out there is now therefore no condemnation this is Paul finishing up he says what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us Amen if God be for us if God has declared something nobody else can change that he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not halt not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifiable who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us Amen notice there it says it's God that justifies you don't have to answer Satan's questions you don't have to answer his accusations because you don't justify yourself it is Christ that justifies in him alone so same wants to come knocking and accusing you say listen you're talking to the wrong person because I'm not saying I'm perfect he said I'm perfect go talk to him he's the one you need to argue with amen amen there's a place of rest in that every time we mess up and we mess up every day and if we're sincere and we're repenting and that's under the blood there is no reason why we can't continue to walk in close access to God amen in close communion and close fellowship with him brother Branham said there's always been an arc in God's economy this is the message how can I overcome there's always been an arc in God's economy there was an arc in the days of Noah for the saving of his people there was an arc in the days of the law the architects timoni in the days of the law they followed the ark he says then there's a third dispensation now like Noah's time lots time and now this time there's an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither did is it the good works you do it's by one spirit amen Romans 8 verse 1 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcomes for you you're arresting amen if we can only find ourselves like that every day resting and what the finished work of Calvary amen that it's a peace that we ought to have every single day no matter how we mess up lose our temper look at things we shouldn't do say things we shouldn't little lies this that the other thing in it all we're resting on the finished work of Calvary amen not on the works the good works brother Brown says it he says it's not the good works no matter how good or how bad he says that you're in the kingdom it says by the Holy Ghost baptism why because he overcome for you and you're resting amen and the message is super he says now see we're only made of 16 elements of the earth that's you know calcium potash petroleum cosmic light and so forth God just reached down and got a handful of that stuff and go whoo and said step in here Gabriel were going down he's speaking of Abraham he said he made himself one that's right oh I'm so glad to know him like that that there might not even be one speck of me left on earth but my God who promised to raise me up in the last days can speak the cosmic light and things will come into existence if only my name's on his book amen he says wrote there by the blood of the Lamb a super sign he says aren't you happy don't you just love him with all your heart he's so good I love him with all that is in me and they says this God be manifested he says a man I believe that he's here and then he says he looks up he says something just happened man he said I seen something happen amen he says he always backs up his word if it's right he says the super son what was it it was God vindicating as prophets word to the people they meant showing them that God was recognizing that this was right and they needed to take it he's talking about this he's talking about deliverance he's talking about healing and these different things they many seen he said what just watch he said something happened right there what somebody took him at his word amen in the message look in 1963 a little bit later a little bit earlier than this sorry he says now the thing of it is is come to a place where all the stain of sin has washed away then you stand redeemed by the blood of the Lamb he says you are an atom like he was before he fell that's right now you are an atom like he was before he fell amen you are a son of God washed in the blood of God's own blood it was blood that brings forth the child it was only blood alone the blood comes from the male he said the blood comes from the man the woman she produces the egg but the man is the hemoglobin and that's from where comes the germ and in the germ is where the life lays and the life comes not by confession in some Church or some Creed or some document but the life comes when you're born-again by the blood of Jesus Christ the German he says in the works that I do shall you do also he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die there is that life of God as a son of God born by the blood of God listen to this he says the same holy spirit that wrote this Bible will focus it right back into you again what the life of God that's not it there's not a denomination or a Creed that can do that only God Himself can take ahold of the camera of your eyes and let you see what God is and what his purpose is yes sir certainly hey man I want to read that again he says the same holy spirit that wrote this Bible will focus the life of God right back into you again he says why to let you see what God is what his purpose is yes sir certainly amen so the blood is what setting you up for the Holy Spirit to come into your life to bring you back into the fullness of a son or daughter of God he says when you have that Holy Spirit he says you are a fully restored Adam and then you're back in your eating condition except for what you're still in this body amen but what is the purpose of that the blood taking you to the Holy Spirit why he says to see your kingdom purpose and what's that to express Christ and overcome in this world amen let's move on to the next portion of revelation 12:11 it says then they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony I just fell in love with this as I was reading it it challenged me it provoked me it just kind of got me all stirred up and those are good things for a believer Amen we don't want to sit here and just look around and say yeah I've got the message and I got the Holy Ghost and this and that the other thing amen we want to be challenged we want to be growing we want to be moving we want God to be shaking us and continuing up Lord amen the path to heaven amen but I'm struck here by it says they they overcame so there's a group but it says by the word singular of their testimony singular so this is a people that has the same word and they have the same testimony so this is a this is a united people under what God's Word this is people that are saying the same thing and doing the same thing but notice how this overcoming it doesn't say they had a testimony after they overcame it says they overcame by their testimony amen they didn't have a victory and then give a testimony but rather it says their testimony is what gave them the victory in the first place Amen so often we sit here and we say God give me a testimony god help me God come down and show yourself real give me something give me a testimony to share with the people but if we see here what God's saying is don't say to give the testimony after the victory give the testimony to bring the victory in your life they men so we see and we can look and we'll look at a couple examples here in scripture where the testimony is what produces the victory we're not supposed to wait till the battles over to give the testimony amen we're supposed to be testifying before the battle starts while the battles going on and then after it goes after it's done as well amen look at David's testimony before he fights Goliath and then as he goes into it First Samuel 1734 says so David's before the king he's in front of what's supposed to be a believer we know he's not but it's in front of Saul and David said to Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered the lamb out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smelled him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing that he had defied the arms of the Living God it meant so he's saying look I've already got a testimony of victory and guess what I'm gonna testify the victory as I faced this Philistine and that's that he's gonna die just the way those two did and yes he's just as impossible to kill as those are I killed those with my bare hands I'm gonna kill him with the weapons God has given me amen but why is David so confident it's because he has an experience already he's got something to go on but there's always the first time there's always the first time where you've got a step forward and take God at His Word and say I'm gonna testify that I'm he'll I'm gonna testify that I'm delivered I'm gonna testify that I am saved I'm gonna testify that my children are safe I'm gonna testify deliverance and all these different things why because God's looking for someone that will stand on his word and step forward and what walk right into it and then God back so his wording gives you the testimony that you've spoken of already amen but watch what happens now is David comes in to glide so he's told Saul he says look I've got wet everything I need God's with me I've got the weapons I need I don't need anything that you offer me but now he comes before Goliath and I want you to catch here that the enemy gets the first word and if there's one thing I've noticed the enemy usually gets the first word and why is that it's because the enemy is the one that comes after us amen we don't go around stepping on Satan's ground so to speak we're not going out into bars in these different places generally we're not putting ourselves in situations where it's his territory but he what steps onto our territory brother Branham calls him a squatter Satan's a squatter and he comes onto your territory yeah there comes in Bold As Brass cocky why trying to bluff you to make you think that he's impossible to defeat or else he's slyly hiding over there in the corner to try and ambush you amen but the enemy is the one that always comes after us we aren't going after the enemy he's the one that comes onto us he's the one that jumps onto us puts thoughts in her head tries to make us sick tries to take away our peace and joy in that we're not going to Satan to say somebody come on bud try and take my peace he's coming after each one of us and what does he do he starts talking to us he starts putting pressure on us he starts trying to get us to react amen verse 42 of that chapter and Samuel says and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistine said to David am i a dog that thou comes to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give that flesh to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field so look at that he cursed David by his gods and then he says I'm gonna kill you and feed your flesh to the birds but notice now the brides the one that has the last word here amen then David said to the Philistine now comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou has to fight so David says look I'm identifying myself with the God of Israel and guess what he's the one that's going to defeat you amen he says this day will the Lord deliver the to my hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day into the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel amen so he cursed Phyllis he cursed Goliath by his God not cursing him in the sense of you know using the name in vain but he's saying look there's a curse on you now what you said you were going to me now becomes your judgment and not only you but everyone that follows after you he says I'm not only going to give you to the birds of the air he says but I'm gonna take everybody else in the Philistine army as well he says I'm gonna kill every one of you what because that's what you said you're gonna do to us hey man we've got a 15 year old child I would call teenagers standing fearless Lee in front of the greatest warrior of that time and saying he's gonna kill him in his army a man what a testimony now watch how David follows up with this testimony though because he puts it into context to say this isn't about me in verse 47 he says and all this assembly shall know that the Lord sayeth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands amen the battle is not ours I mean this is about giving the glory the honor and the praise to the one that gives us the victory that gives us the strength that gives us the overcoming power that gives us the overcoming life inside of us and I guarantee you the minute you start talking about something as if you did it God's gonna let you take a fall but David here his only testimony is what to give credit where it's due and that's what the God of Israel amen but what a testimony that he had there and I want you to notice and I've covered this I know in a previous sermon there in Newfoundland why was David so confident David was confident because he knew the land he was on was his he knew that he had the Covenant of circumcision in his body which meant that the Lord will be with them so he's standing on his land by covenant he has the proof of the Covenant in himself and on that basis he knows that he can take on any enemy in the land that God has given him and he can defeat him amen so what a type that is for the bride that what we ought to know what our land is and we know that what Ephesians types Joshua you want to start looking at what belongs to the bride start looking in the book of Ephesians because there's plenty in there that's available to the bride I like my brother mark talked about there in the song service where he said all those promises were what given to us when he took his place on the cross when he died every single promise that he made is available to us now there's nothing held back now that the same question has been settled forever you now I would say that every attribute promise is for us today whatever Christ's will was and whatever Christ is that's available to us so not just healing and deliverance but peace and joy and love and rest and long-suffering in these different things they all belong to us and there's nothing that should keep us from taking them amen so what look at Jesus testified of his death burial and resurrection so he testified yeah I'm gonna suffer a defeat of sorts a defeat but he said what in three days I'll rise up the game will restore this back to his former glory amen and why did he do that because he knew the scripture he found himself in Scripture and he was confident that God will back it up and so he was they had no problem saying hey I'm gonna die but in three days I'll rise up again listen to what brother Branham said in the message this great warrior Joshua he said that's what we need you got to do some fighting not with your fists but with the power of God with your testimony that's how you overcome by the blood of the Lamb in your testimony tell the devil he's got no strings tied to you he says you put this disease on me but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he promised it to me amen if you've got a sound foundation in the word you know that this is the time and this is the place then you can do what stand for with your testimony and God will back it up every time but we've also seen what happens when you don't have the right kind of authority when you don't have God backing you off amen you think of the seven sons of Siva in acts 19 verse 13 says then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits by the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches if I could put that into message terms we adjure you by Jesus who brother Branham preaches or Ron Spencer preaches or temperat preaches that's not how this works and says and there were seven sons of one Siva a Jew and the chief of the priests which did so so these are higher-ups in Church these are spiritual men and they go in there and they start trying to do things the way the Apostles did but they lack the authority to do it and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded then what happened when they didn't have what they thought they had when they presumed on Authority when they thought they knew how to handle the Word of God what happened Satan exposed him God isn't there to back them up they haven't had an experience they aren't under the shed blood they didn't have the Holy Ghost these are just men trying to profit off of what they saw somebody else doing and thought that they could do the same thing because they were spiritually minded maybe they weren't spiritually minded but they were certainly in a in a position of spiritual authority as members of the priests amen amen listen to what brother Graham says about that kind of situation he says now he he's speaking of Satan now Satan don't care how much you cut up see that ain't going to bother him you can't scare him there's only one thing that will move him that's true divine faith in Christ that'll take him right now he's afraid of that that's right when you really got the blood of Christ behind you back in your faith up moving like that he will move away he recognizes it amen that's in the message expectation you have to know what the word says about you and you have to know about the word says for your day you can't go around with this testimony God has told me to build an ark and I'm gonna save humanity that's not for this day I mean we've got lots of the scripture that doesn't apply to us amen there's lots of deliverances and judgments that came in times past and people got out of it by doing certain things but today we only have one way of escape amen and that's to follow that message of Malachi 4 through to a rapture because that's the only thing that's guaranteed to give us rapturing faith Amen you have to have that defined piece of land like David did the boundaries of Israel were clear and guess what they weren't supposed to go into Philistia they weren't supposed to go over to this land and that land in these different ones they were supposed to do what stay in their land and that's where they were to be blessed they didn't have to go and try and make a big you know empire out of it the way Alexander the Great did are these different ones the Romans and whatnot No God said I've given you a land stay in the land possess the land guard the land I'll be with you as long as you stay in the land and that's what were just asked to do stay with the word for your day stick with the word for your day and I'll back it up every single time amen brother Bram said this and the message the hours come he says now that's where we missed the blessings he says we're afraid to wait on God just a little bit see he says you've heard that song only wait again I hear that whisper only wait it won't be very long even now the father's hand is pleading soon with Jesus we will sing the victory song that's right he says just wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you what's the problem is sometimes we're seeing they're saying where's the victory I'm testifying I'm testifying I believe I believe and the victory hasn't come yet but you look at when they crossed into across the river Jordan they didn't get victory over Jericho the first time they went around and around and around and around and then they went around seven times in one day and it's only then that victory came and as they went through that land the cities to just not fall bang bang bang bang one after another just you know no no problem no resistance or anything it took them 10 years to walk through that entire land and take the majority of it there was still some left over so brother Brown saying look just because you're testifying doesn't mean that God's gonna answer it right now right away now our expectation should be what God's gonna answer and hopefully soon hopefully right away but if he doesn't answer it doesn't change the fact that his word is true and he'll back it up every time I mean if you remember the story of John Ryan the blind man that went to brother Branham for prayer and he was in the prayer line brother Brown said you're healed he walked off the platform he couldn't see and the next day he still couldn't see so he comes back to brother Branham excuse me and he says what I thought you said I was healed and brother Brown said I thought you said you believed you were healed he said go and testify and you'll be you'll get your sight back and so he went for two weeks and he was selling papers on the side of the road there on the corner and telling people I'm healed of blindness I'm healed of blindness I'm healed of blindness and for two weeks he put up with what this Dick's the people sneering saying how whatever you can't see and I'm sure they're doing just like they did to Jesus you know slapping him on the face putting something what am i holding in front of you these different things and then what happens he's sitting in the barber chair and all of a sudden his eyes come open and he can see after two weeks but for two weeks he put up with what people making fun of them people saying that God wasn't real people saying he wasn't he didn't have faith that he didn't believe in these different things brother Branham says what we're afraid to wait on God just a little bit wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you amen if it's the right time the right season you have the right motive and the right objective amen your testimony is going to bring the victory but that's the struggle isn't it to try and find yourself in the right place at the right time I talked about how we have you know full access to Christ we have continuous access there's nothing that should stand between us in Christ today but how often are we taking advantage of it how often are we spending that time to stay close so that when something happens were right there we're ready to go in remember what brother Branham said about David he said he didn't have to pray up when he went to meet Goliath he was prayed up may says he was prayed up before the foundation of the world but the point is that David had that closeness with God and this is a man that was under the the blood of lambs not the blood of Christ but we have that access we have that availability we have that ability to be constantly in the presence of God amen so are we using it because it's not just enough enough to know what is the work for my day it's God what is your time what is your plan when do you want me to do this when do you want this to happen and when he wants us to move he comes on us and we're so sensitive to him then that as he does it then yes we move into it we step into that channel of inspiration you know we talk about inspiration a lot for ministers and whatnot to be found what in the mind of God to bring a certain message to the people but that inspiration or inspiration of the Holy Spirit is not just for ministry I mean that's where every single son and daughter of God that has the Holy Ghost is to do what lead them in their life to lead them into their kingdom purpose and day by day moment by moment help them to find what is the will of God thing that it takes sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and that only comes with time prayer with reading the words so that you recognize when he's moving and when he's asking you to do something he meant look at what Jesus did he walked up to the Pool of Bethesda and healed one man and there were certainly dozens maybe hundreds possibly even thousands of people there and yet he walked up and he only healed one and brother Bram said Jesus had to say a gift like what brother Bram did he said God showed him what he was supposed to do so he walked in and He healed one man and he walked right back out of there so many needs he had the power to do it all he had the authority to do it all but he didn't have the leadership to do it so he only walks in he touches the one man and walks out and I don't know why he did that maybe it's only because there was one that had faith may be only one have faith to be healed I don't know but there was a unity that he had that tied him to God's will where he would only do what the father showed him and that's what he said he said I only do that which the father shows me amen but now he says you've got to have that same thing John 15 verse 4 says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he's cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen he talks about what abiding and you don't get abiding by darting in and out of the presence of God in and out I need this I need that we only go in a time of need we only go in times of great desperation but he says what I buy continuously present with him they men we see this prosperity gospel that's so prevalent today and they talk a lot about what speaking things speaking good things into your life but how many of them talk about abiding in the presence of Christ and how many of them talk about getting into the channel of the Holy Spirit to speak they don't they just say just speak good things and they'll come into your life and guess what God gives a lot of them exactly what they asked for why because that's what the scripture says yeah ask a Miss according to what the lust of your flesh and he gives them to you half the time he gives them to you why because that's what you're gonna you know that's your focus that your that's what you're looking for and he just gives you what you want lets you fall into your own trap amen but the whole the true believer what do they want they want to be led and directed by the Holy Spirit every single day of their life they men we want God's timing we want God's purpose we've got want God's will that means we want God's job for us that means we want God's home for us that means we want God's vehicle for us God's church for us God's pasture for us cuz vacation for us God's clothes for us all of these different things and guess what that varies from person to person but regardless whatever he wants for each one of us that's what we want to do amen that doesn't come easy and you know we've been reading the supernatural series for a couple years now with the kids in the evenings and you see how many times brother branham walks into a situation and God tells him to go but God doesn't necessarily tell him how things are gonna work how long it's gonna take what's gonna transpire to make it come to pass and brother Branham in some of these situations would pray for hours and hours in healing lines especially early on in his ministry he plays pray sometimes for two or three hours for the first person up there remember he'd tell him to bring the worst one up and he'd pray for them and he'd pray and he pray and he pray and then it'd be healed now God didn't show him that that person was going to be healed that was pure faith but he had that commission from the angel go pray for the sick and the ministry that he had in these different things right so if that's what the prophets got to do imagine what its gonna be like for us it's certainly not going to be any different God's not going to give us a pass where we don't have to do what spend time before him have faith hold on to the promise keep looking to Him abiding in his presence they meant spending that time in prayer spending that time in the word so that we know when he's moving I think we've made it too difficult sometimes where we're looking for a voice from heaven or something and quite honestly I think so often at least for me two ways you'll find it you'll get a piece about something or you'll open the scripture and the answers right there for you and it jumps out at you and you know exactly what you're supposed to do we don't have to have an angel come in the room and show us these things but God can give us confidence reading is word by time and prayer to where we're settled and then we have that function to do things and I think in the times I've spoken to many of you there in the church in Newfoundland you had unction to do things and you went in prayer and you know thinking of Joe with his business in these different things and you're praying and you're praying for weeks and weeks and you don't know what to do you don't know what to do and then all of a sudden you know what to do and it works out exactly the way that you believed it would why because you spent that time with prayer you had that continous fellowship that time seeking him and then he comes through and he gives us the answer amen think about this revelation 10:1 we see that mighty angel coming down and it says and who was it we know it was Christ amen it's very clear in the scripture when you compare him to who it was in revelation 1 but what was above him when he comes down there it's a rainbow then brother Branham and the message the breech he says this is our covenant angel and what was the Covenant that he was coming down for every single promise that he had ever made for the Gentile church is going to be fulfilled now in this final age he's coming down as the covenant angel he's not standing back now and giving a little bit to this one and a little bit to that one through the ages but now he's coming back in the fullness of his power to take what the full bride the full word bride and he's coming down under a covenant what to fulfill every single promise that he is placed in the scripture for us so I ask you today what is the promise that he will not fulfill today for each and every one of us show me one thing in the word that is given to the Gentiles that he will not fulfill for each and every one of us if we will hold that word if we will testify that word into our lives amen that scripture revelation 10:1 is Christ himself coming down not sending somebody else not sending a messenger not sending Gabriel or these Michael or these different ones this is Christ himself coming down to personally fulfill the last of those promises and take his bride away amen so he's right here now he's right here now working with us for overcoming power amen for the Branham said a positive mental attitude towards the promises of God would bring them to pass in your life but remember it's not just an attitude thinking's not just enough if you go back to the original you know in Genesis it didn't say in God about light God said let there be light amen there has to be a word spoken there has to be a testimony there has to be an affirmation there has to be a confession of what you believe so it's not just enough to have the right mental attitude but what with that right mental attitude you'll start to talk about it you'll start to speak about it and that will start to develop faith in your life if you don't have it and then pretty soon that very thing is coming forth in you amen it's not enough to believe you have to confess with your mouth amen all right we're starting to close we're gonna read the last little bit of revelation 12:11 which is the death it says and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death amen here we see the effect of the blood of the Lamb in the word of the testimony on the Saints in that time on the believers of that time or the Christians at that time and what is it they didn't love their lives they died they gave up their lives for what they said they believed amen but remember brother Branham points back to this scripture not just for the Saints of the tribulation time but he says this is for every child and every son of God but of the lamb in the testimony the word of their testimony Amen so that means there has to be a death that comes for each and every one of us but we know that our death is not the natural type like they do in the tribulation right we're gonna go in a rapture we don't see death so this is a death that is different and what is it we talked about it earlier this is a debt to self this is a debt to pride this is a debt to our own carnal nature and thoughts and disciplines and these different things so I want to dig down a little bit deeper into this as we start to close MN so what is true death true death is what separation from God so that's what when they gave it up when they give it up in the tribulation it's not true death for them it's just carnal death it's they lose their life but they get you know they get eternal life on the other side and whatnot but our true death is what death the self so that we can have true life which is what true light is unity with Christ amen true life is unity with God so we're giving up all of our selves we're giving up all of our ideas and attitudes and opinions why so that we can have true life which is unity with God amen and what does that do prophet said our death puts our selves in the position for God to show himself amen what he says in this he says what was Jesus meant what was Jesus manifested for to show God then he says he was God not just to show God he says he was God he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was God he was the God of the prophets he was the prophets he was the kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose what to put God in a position to show himself amen let me drop in something here real quickly because Christ didn't think it robbery to be equal with God and why is that they take it back to the scriptures and read it in Philippians 2 verse 5 it says let this mind be in you so there's a way of thinking there's a he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal to God but listen to the effect it has it said he but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and being found in fashion as a man he showed he humbled himself and became oh I'm reading it all over again I put it in twice in my notes he humble himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so why wasn't it robbery to be equal with God because God was expressing his will and is perfect so perfectly through Christ that there was no difference between the actions of God and the actions of Christ amen there was no difference between Jesus the man if you will the body and the thoughts of God all of God was he poured into Christ and so now Christ is walking he's living his breathing and every word he says every attitude he shows every action every miracle it's what God through him so when he says he didn't it wasn't robbery for him to be equal with God why was it because you couldn't take a razor blade and separate Christ from God in terms of his actions his spirit his anointing everything about him was God and so he said I am God and he was why because God was perfectly expressed through him but look at the effect it has it doesn't make Jesus some big man some big shot that has some big ministry and drawing men to him and this and that the scripture says he humbled himself him any made himself of no reputation and he became obedient unto death that's the effect that unity with God will have on us it'll humble us it'll make us of no reputation and it'll make us obedient until every aspect of our human lives becomes obedient and dies away amen even to the point where Jesus had this slow agonizing brutal death he's whipped he was marred as no man was and he willingly gave himself to that and then he goes to the cross and hangs there with his feet in his arms nailed crown of thorns in him stabbed in his side goes through all of that why because that was the purpose of God that was the plan of God that was the will of God for him amen and what a reward he got for that and then if we continue reading there it says wherefore God had also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen what did it take though he had to go through that slow agonizing death and I'm sad to say it this way but guess what each and every one of us has what is usually a slow agonizing death because we give ourselves you know that when we give our lives over to Christ when we surrender when we first accept the you know the sacrifice and we repent in these different things we give our life to him but that's only the start this is a progressive walk we grow we mature we strengthen through our walk and that only comes through what that slow agonizing death to self and it's constant and it's day in and day out in some days he's using the whip and he's yanking stuff out of us and other days it's kind of just a slow peeling you know he's clipping the toenails so to speak taking off little things to form us and fashion us into his way but it is a slow and agonizing thing we have to be willing to go through it we have to be willing to let him go and put us through that process why so that we can say just like him we are Christ amen we are so close we are so unified that his actions and ours cannot be separated that his mind his thoughts his opinions his preferences are exactly the same as ours amen listen to what brother Branham says here in the message Christ is a mystery God revealed he's talking about the threefold purpose of the Church of Christ amen it says and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised Word of God in these last days how through the death of the believers to self they men so that he could have the preeminence he says when he gets the preeminence is the preeminence in the church the position is placed in the church jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also even more than this shall he do for I go to my father see that was his purpose that was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word him and he breaks in on him itself that he says see Jesus so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed I'm gonna read that again it's so tremendous he said Jesus so seen what seeing what he was meant to do see what God wanted to do so perfectly born for the day and that is no different for us today we are perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed amen and that's no different for us today how he sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed catch that he's wanting to reveal every promise for the last day how in the bride the same way he did in Christ now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows had left off here in the last days and by His Holy Spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals see he's expressing himself that's his purpose he's talking about today now that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation to express himself in Christ then express himself through the church and the same thing that Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them hallelujah can you just imagine so close that we become the very word that when somebody says where is the word you can say you're looking at it Amen just like that well survival where is the Ralphs revival you're looking at it it's in me Damon brother Brown continues he said thoroughly to restore the kingdom to its rightful position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them and fellowship with them he meant God's looking for a full and complete expression of himself in this church at the end time and what's it going to take death death to ourselves for the Bram said this he said notice when a man is hungry and thirsting for God God will draw nigh to the man always see he says give up surrender your will to God amen Christ was God's will and plan being living and displayed and that's exactly what he's looking for in this church amen when we take on the mind of Christ when the bride takes on the mind of Christ what does she do humbles herself is obedient makes herself of no reputation points to him gives him all the glory the honor and the credit and then what happens we get identified now we're not just identified with the sacrifice in terms of he took my place and now I have is the right to his apperture buttes but now we actually have the very life we have the very name we have everything that Christ is now what embedded into an endtime Bride amen we can say in this age and if you can't say it now you'll be able to say it by the end of all things in this age I am Christ amen I am the word Philippians 2 verse 12 says wherefore my beloved as she have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling I spoke on this last time why because you can't do it only he can do it for it is God which worketh in you both to will and do of his good pleasure I mean that's for the Bride of Christ it is God that works in you to will to make you want to do what he has for you and to do it so he'll put the right desire in you and then he'll give you the right pot he'll give you the power to do it as well he men why his good pleasure do all things without murmuring and disputing and we often think that's murmuring disputing amongst ourselves and it just jumped out at me that's not murmuring disputing amongst ourselves that's murmuring and disputing with God god I don't want to do this I don't want to go there I don't want to be stuck in that position I don't want this job I don't want this place I don't want this church I don't want to have to talk to that person I don't want to have to humble myself I don't want to have to apologize right murmuring disputing God don't make me do this and then I went read the amplified and this is I thought that and then I went let me check the amplified it said do all things without grumbling and fault-finding and complaining against God and then questioning and doubting among yourselves so don't go to God and complain and then don't go and start talking to other people about your problems and you're not happy with this and you don't want to do that and debt to debt today he says don't do it why that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation and if there's a time that there's a crooked and perverse nation it's today a man among whom he's shine as lights in the world so what's our goal then we're talking about the word of our testimony we're talking about total victory it's to be as Jesus was so United with Christ then nobody could separate the two that he doesn't separate the two more importantly it's not what others think but that Christ identifies himself with us I'm in the head of the body and all together we are one amen but victory is total surrender to yourself and total acceptance of what God has for you lay men when you die out and Christ alone lives within you amen he is Satan as sealed out because you've been so filled with the Holy Spirit that he has no access to you that try as he might and get into those five outward senses and your imagination these different things he comes in and he hits that inner man he just gets shocked every single time he backs away saying I'm gonna I'm gonna try another day I'm gonna try another time hey men I'm gonna close with this quote as an encouragement it speaks of the Warrior Christian amen the rugged soldier the experienced soldier to me it's a real anchor point for believers because in the end this comes back to lies that were believers in the first place but the bram says this Jesus might have said now in order to go back to the original God has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you the new birth your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of the Lord if you're not your hybrid in two churches denominations but when God speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit then you're back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it go to the cross to the fiery furnace to the lion's den or wherever it may be because the word of the Living God is burning in your heart and soul and all else can backslide all can turn against you and everything else but that one that won't stop one thing Amen that rugged Word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart and said you are mine amen what a rest and what a confidence we have that we are here and we believe him and believers believe it's not because we chose it not because there are anything in and of ourselves not because we decide to do it but because he said you are mine that original voice said you are mine and that's the word we've heard in this day come out of her my people you're not of them amen you are mine amen how are we gonna get it under the blood through the token of the Holy Spirit speaking and testifying of the word of God for our day amen let's just bow our heads together if we would Lord Jesus your word is so tremendous lorda just gives us such a faith such a hope such a confidence toward to read these wonderful things that you put in there Lord in such a simple Scripture Lord the Lord the depth of it board that we take on you Lord that because you took away us Lord we can have you not just a part of you Lord but every single aspect of you every attribute Lord Jesus Lord and we need it today Lord we need it to overcome ourselves or we need it to overcome this world that's around us Lord Jesus would you just help us to surrender Lord today Lord those things we've been fighting more those things we've been pushing back Lord where we've said no I want hold onto that a bit more Lord where we've held onto attitudes where we've held on to our being right or where we've held onto disputes with those around us or where we've been riled up by what's going on Lord we say just take it away Lord and give us your peace and rest Lord and help us to walk according to your purpose Lord to testify of the word that you inspire to our hearts in this last endtime age Lord bless your people give them rest the night Lord this night Lord restore them back Lord pray that you would just bless these services to the hearts of the people Lord of may you just bring us back swiftly in the personal fellowship floor where we can be around each other directly Lord guard and keep each one we pray in your
