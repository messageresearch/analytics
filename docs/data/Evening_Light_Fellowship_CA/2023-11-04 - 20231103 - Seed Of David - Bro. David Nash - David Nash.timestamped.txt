[34:39] throne I will give
[34:43] anything I will give
[34:47] everything to you
[34:51] alone amen God bless you each one that's
[34:53] gathered here on a Friday night and many
[34:57] missing not feeling well but trusting
[34:59] the Lord to be with them but we're here
[35:01] amen and we're trusting that the spirit
[35:03] of God can speak that the Holy Spirit
[35:05] can come down into our lives each one
[35:07] and we brought Brother David Nash all
[35:09] the way up from Louisiana and Texas and
[35:13] by way of South America and all these
[35:16] other places he's been so he's a
[35:17] missionary he's been doing that for well
[35:19] over 20 years preaching for much longer
[35:21] than that and we've supported Brother
[35:23] David in some of his trips and some of
[35:25] his missions and so he's here to just
[35:27] greet the people and kind of put a a
[35:30] face to a name but he's here to preach
[35:31] the word amen he's a missionary he's
[35:33] part of the fivefold ministry and so we
[35:36] want to have everything that God would
[35:37] have for us this weekend and I'm not
[35:39] going to share any stories about Brother
[35:41] David because I want to see what he's
[35:42] going to have to say tonight and over
[35:44] the next few days but I'll tell you this
[35:46] is a this is not a a novice preacher
[35:48] this is a man that by the grace of God
[35:51] has emptied out hospitals has they've
[35:53] seen tremendous signs and wonders in the
[35:55] ministry that he's brought just like the
[35:57] apostles in the book of Acts amen that's
[36:00] the way the fivefold ministry is
[36:01] supposed to be is a book of Acts
[36:03] Ministry and so I've seen that in
[36:04] brother David's life I've seen the
[36:06] humility the Simplicity with which he
[36:08] lives his life and his family and what
[36:10] God's done in their lives so we're we're
[36:13] in good hands tonight amen we've got a
[36:14] servant of God that's come here to to
[36:16] preach the word so Brother David as I
[36:18] said in the office you take your Liberty
[36:21] you can't preach long enough to Tire us
[36:23] out and you you can probably preach
[36:25] short enough to to disappoint us perhaps
[36:27] but uh you take your time and and we
[36:29] want him we just want the Lord to have
[36:31] his way amen and you know he we got in
[36:34] we got to bed about 3:00 last night and
[36:37] we woke up late and had a late breakfast
[36:39] and he's been down in his room most of
[36:41] the day so again he knows nothing about
[36:43] this church he knows nothing about the
[36:45] people and that's the way we like it
[36:47] amen cuz whatever comes over the pulpit
[36:49] then it's the Sovereign goodness and
[36:50] grace of God to speak it so let's just
[36:52] pull on the gift let's trust that he's
[36:54] going to speak to us that God's going to
[36:56] speak to us in amen it's not a man it's
[36:58] not a Ministry but it's the everpresent
[37:00] Jesus Christ in our midst he said where
[37:02] two or three are gathered in my name
[37:03] there will I be in the midst and so
[37:05] let's believe that let's trust that this
[37:07] evening let's sing that song If we would
[37:09] more of you that's that's the one I love
[37:11] for these types of things more of you we
[37:12] just said we'll give anything we'll give
[37:14] everything but it's not just the giving
[37:16] away now we've got to receive we've got
[37:18] to have something to fill that Gap that
[37:20] empty room that we open up for him so
[37:22] let's just sing this as Brother David
[37:24] would come and let's just pull and pull
[37:26] pull and Pull and feed and feed and feed
[37:29] till we can't hold
[37:31] anymore amen let's sing
[37:34] it

[40:28] God your grace poured out upon us
[40:31] through our precious Lord Jesus
[40:35] Christ God how you paid the the price
[40:39] Lord and yet it goes even beyond that
[40:41] because now it's the continuation of the
[40:44] life that you

[40:50] re resurrected tonight in every heart
[40:53] and life God that's a my prayer tonight
[40:57] resurrect Jesus Christ again that this
[41:01] dying sinful world might see Christ just
[41:04] one more time just once more in the
[41:08] lives of these

[41:12] long way but it's truly it's the grace

[41:19] so fill us tonight Lord more of you oh
[41:23] God just more of you I thank you and I
[41:26] praise you for being here I thank you
[41:28] Lord that they'd give us the offer to
[41:30] come and to stand Lord in your place in
[41:33] this Pulpit
[41:34] tonight so God take this man take every
[41:38] part of me anything Lord that's wrongful
[41:40] or sinful or whatever Lord cuz we're all
[41:43] born in sin shaped in iniquity take all
[41:46] those things away and look at us through
[41:48] the blood of Jesus Christ tonight
[41:51] perfectly totally
[41:53] sinless as you have declared in the name
[41:55] of our Lord Lord Jesus Christ of
[42:02] you thank you sister praise the Lord
[42:07] uh I uh that particular song
[42:12] I there's brother usabo was the brother
[42:15] in Nicaragua used to take us around a
[42:18] lot and that was his favorite song the
[42:19] Lord took him home a little over a year
[42:22] ago and uh I miss him he uh he I spent a
[42:26] lot of time in Nicaragua I used to go
[42:28] there a couple times a year for 3 four
[42:31] weeks at a time and he uh would always
[42:34] take me around and he said and he told
[42:35] me one time before I left he said I wish
[42:37] you'd just come and stay for two or
[42:38] three months I said why is that you
[42:41] Sabio and he said well there's a lot of
[42:43] other churches I'd like to take you to
[42:45] and I'm thinking well maybe you know I
[42:48] don't know maybe we'd already been to
[42:50] about 50 I think and so I thought well
[42:52] maybe there's you know 25 30 more I said
[42:55] well how many and he he said about
[42:57] 200 and I thought wow well we never got
[43:01] to do it but I believe he's probably
[43:04] here tonight we have that scripture to
[43:07] that we can hang on to it says we're
[43:08] encompassed about by so great a cloud of
[43:11] witnesses and don't ever think that just
[43:13] because you look small you could be
[43:15] right here in a grandstand tonight with
[43:17] thousands times thousands listening to
[43:20] the word of God so you thank the Lord
[43:22] for those things and I I don't like to
[43:25] keep you st it so let's turn to Second
[43:28] Timothy the 3rd
[43:32] Chapter and uh greetings from My Wife
[43:35] and from our little home Church there in
[43:39] Kenwick Washington they uh I'd like to
[43:43] think they're a well-taught church they
[43:46] they put up with me for about 10 or 11
[43:48] years now and they I keep saying well
[43:50] maybe I should you know and they go no
[43:53] you're not going anywhere you're the
[43:54] pastor here as long as you're here and
[43:58] uh we have a really good assistant
[44:00] pastor brother Jose uh
[44:03] Hernandez and uh he's taking care of the
[44:06] flock while we're away so do remember
[44:09] them in prayer we were mentioning in the
[44:11] car and I said well the Apostle Paul had
[44:14] 12 in Ephesus and they said it was a uh
[44:17] a mature church and I said we got 15 so
[44:20] at least we're in the same boat so
[44:23] greetings from them tonight and also
[44:26] from my wife who probably home listening
[44:28] to the message tonight so in second
[44:31] Timothy uh this third
[44:36] chapter and brother Jonathan was uh
[44:40] asking me you know about preaching he
[44:43] likes to ask different preachers how
[44:45] they they do things and I say well I I
[44:47] don't read a lot of quotes but uh
[44:51] because there's so many and you can make
[44:53] quotes say just about anything you want
[44:55] to as we've discovered in this
[44:58] message but uh I tend to preach on
[45:03] Concepts and
[45:05] so
[45:06] uh again tonight that's kind of what
[45:09] we'll be looking at and in second
[45:11] Timothy the third
[45:13] chapter we'll start there I think it's
[45:16] with the I guess they put six or 15 okay
[45:20] 15th verse says and that from a child
[45:23] that H has known the holy scriptures
[45:25] which are able to make thee wise unto
[45:27] salvation through faith which is in
[45:30] Jesus Christ all scripture is given uh
[45:34] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[45:36] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[45:40] for instruction and righteousness that
[45:42] the man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[45:45] furnished unto all good works gracious
[45:49] Heavenly Father we've read your
[45:50] scripture this evening may you add your
[45:52] blessing to the word in the name of
[45:54] Jesus Christ amen amen please be
[45:59] seated and as we think about
[46:02] this he says that all scripture is given
[46:05] by inspiration of God well we believe
[46:08] that in the word or in the beginning was
[46:11] the word the word was with God the Word
[46:13] was
[46:14] God and the concept I guess tonight if
[46:18] we would begin to look at this I've seen
[46:21] Brothers at times you know in different
[46:24] churches different places I I believe
[46:26] that we've speak spoken now in 30 maybe
[46:28] 31 countries I kind of lost track
[46:32] recently and uh all
[46:34] different you would be amazed if you saw
[46:37] some of the things or eating some of the
[46:39] foods as we talked about that we've
[46:41] eaten along the way but uh and I've seen
[46:45] Brothers sometimes almost get in
[46:47] fights over the word of God and as I'll
[46:50] sit there and listen and pray and I I
[46:52] say you know they're actually using the
[46:54] same quote same script scripture
[46:56] whatever it might be and they're
[46:58] fighting because they're looking at it
[46:59] from different angles or different uh
[47:03] Concepts I I guess in the sense that uh
[47:07] one brother he believes it's only this
[47:09] way and it can't be any other way and
[47:10] this brother he's convinced that way but
[47:13] if we take it for what it says every
[47:16] scripture uh is given by inspiration
[47:19] from God and it's profitable for and
[47:22] then he lists four different things that
[47:24] it's profitable for
[47:26] it's profitable for Doctrine for reproof
[47:31] for correction for instruction in
[47:33] righteousness so you begin to realize
[47:35] right away that each scripture has more
[47:39] than one
[47:41] application every single scripture has
[47:44] more than one application and if we
[47:46] really believe that this scripture is
[47:49] Jesus Christ that this word is Christ
[47:52] then it becomes apparent very quickly
[47:55] because as a human being if this is
[47:58] Christ in word form then a as Christ
[48:03] being the person of Jesus Christ We're
[48:06] All Made In His Image and we you're
[48:09] looking at an outside flesh that you
[48:13] know it's got its problems I've been
[48:14] nursing a wrist and all the different
[48:17] things that we go through we were
[48:18] talking this morning with the brothers
[48:19] about you know every day you get up you
[48:21] got a new pain that you didn't know was
[48:23] there and and all those kind of things
[48:26] and and and that's that outside flesh
[48:28] but inside that flesh there's a
[48:30] spirit that makes this flesh what it is
[48:33] and makes it act and do the things that
[48:36] it does and if you take that Spirit out
[48:38] then all you got it's a little pile of
[48:41] dust and you know I guess now with
[48:43] inflation it's probably worth you know
[48:45] maybe eight or 10 bucks Canadian I don't
[48:47] know exactly so it's not worth a whole
[48:49] lot if you take the spirit out of it and
[48:52] beyond that that Spirit then that makes
[48:55] this thing alive beyond that and there's
[48:58] things that we could say about this
[49:00] outside flesh well he's not very goodl
[49:01] looking his Beard's too long whatever it
[49:03] might be but beyond that then there's a
[49:06] spirit that brings us and causes us to
[49:09] live a certain life and then beyond that
[49:12] there is the soul realm if you think
[49:15] about Hebrews I think it's the 4th
[49:17] chapter about verse 12 where it says the
[49:19] word of God is sharp and quicker you
[49:22] know like a two-edged sword and it cuts
[49:24] to the Bone and the mar and the and the
[49:26] spirit and the Soul well that Soul
[49:29] that's why we have to be born again
[49:31] because of the fall this Soul came with
[49:34] a a death type
[49:37] nature and so when we get born again and
[49:40] when we receive Jesus Christ that power
[49:43] of the Resurrection comes into this body
[49:47] and it changes brother brandom said the
[49:49] soul is the nature of the
[49:51] spirit so there we begin to look at this
[49:55] and if this scripture represents Jesus
[49:58] Christ every scripture has more than one
[50:00] way we can look at it it has a a fleshly
[50:04] application Doctrine it has a fleshly
[50:07] application instruction unto
[50:09] righteousness it has a fleshly applicate
[50:13] you I mean it has these different
[50:14] applications and each one can lead us
[50:18] into an
[50:20] entirely open room a different room a
[50:22] different direction or a different
[50:26] consideration to how does this apply to
[50:30] me in the last couple of years I've
[50:32] looked at it and we' again we've been to
[50:35] a lot of places heard a lot of other
[50:37] Ministries and stuff and as I go and I
[50:40] see and I look at congregations and as
[50:43] we we were speaking a little bit earlier
[50:45] today about how some of them they're
[50:46] kind of dying they're just going away
[50:48] and you go to another church somewhere
[50:50] and it's like what in the world are they
[50:52] talking about and some of them that call
[50:55] call themselves messagers you know I'm
[50:57] going well they must have heard
[50:58] different tapes than I heard but and
[51:02] it's because that as we look at it if
[51:05] we're only looking at a single singular
[51:08] application we're going to miss the real
[51:11] nature behind it there's a place where
[51:14] brother Bram said uh that he go I don't
[51:17] think we're getting people through to
[51:19] Christ and yet they're preaching more
[51:22] word than has ever been on the planet
[51:24] since the days of
[51:25] all and we're not getting them through
[51:28] to Christ and and I when I look at it I
[51:30] think well it's not it's not just this
[51:32] outside
[51:33] book and it's not just church order as
[51:37] in you know you come in and you sit a
[51:39] certain way and you sing a certain
[51:41] number of songs and no there's a life or
[51:44] there should be a soul or a nature
[51:47] behind that that as we hear the
[51:49] preaching of the word and we hear the
[51:51] song is a wonderful song service tonight
[51:53] God bless you brother it's nice to hear
[51:56] a Holy Ghost Song service we've heard a
[51:59] few that
[52:00] I not a whole lot yeah like uh oh the
[52:04] brother down south said yeah Holy Ghost
[52:07] I'm not sure they had Casper the
[52:08] Friendly Ghost but
[52:11] uh well that's
[52:15] true and I I've been in a few of those
[52:19] but
[52:20] uh there is a life and a nature behind
[52:25] the word of
[52:27] God and if we're not getting through
[52:30] getting people through to Christ it's
[52:32] not that we're not getting them to this
[52:34] written word or even a word that moves
[52:37] maybe into their spirit that causes them
[52:39] to like for the women not to cut their
[52:41] hair or Not to Wear certain things or
[52:43] guys not to you know cheat and kill
[52:45] people or you know whatever it is
[52:47] they're if you get them just that far
[52:50] that's not
[52:51] enough because the the nature behind the
[52:55] word changes
[52:59] lives it it is the nature of Jesus
[53:02] Christ and the power of God should be
[53:05] behind
[53:07] it because God never changed his
[53:11] power as we look at uh I hate to get
[53:15] into that concept this early but uh God
[53:18] is a
[53:19] Creator if you go to the very first of
[53:22] the book it says in the beginning God
[53:24] created
[53:25] the heavens and the Earth that tells us
[53:28] immediately something about the nature
[53:30] or the soul of God it's in God to be a
[53:35] Creator that's in him that's his heart
[53:38] that's his soul that's his
[53:41] desire that's who he
[53:43] is and so if we realize that that power
[53:47] it's never
[53:48] left this Earth it's never left this
[53:53] word so that the pro problem is it's not
[53:56] with God it's we're not getting through
[53:59] to the nature of God that's in this word
[54:04] to where that nature C takes control of
[54:07] us and we allow Jesus Christ to express
[54:11] himself through his creation that he has
[54:14] put into us by the Holy Ghost through
[54:18] Jesus
[54:19] Christ it's the nature of God that he
[54:23] wants to express
[54:26] himself expressing through his
[54:29] bride you and
[54:31] I through the means of his word and his
[54:35] Spirit of the Holy Ghost that he gave to
[54:38] us we think of
[54:41] the the example where it said that uh
[54:45] when Mary the angel came to Mary and he
[54:49] tells her you know you're going to have
[54:50] this son and so forth and she asked a
[54:53] very valid question
[54:55] she saidwell uh how can these things be
[54:58] because all she ever knew all that had
[55:01] ever been taught all that she'd ever
[55:03] seen the only way you could have a child
[55:05] was woman and man come together that's
[55:08] just how it happens and she said she
[55:10] asked that how can it be that I can have
[55:15] this son and he said well the Holy Ghost
[55:16] will overshadow you and bring forth and
[55:20] he continues to give her revelation of
[55:23] what that son will be
[55:26] and you think about how the Holy Ghost
[55:30] overshadowed a
[55:33] woman and that word went into her W womb
[55:36] and she said the right thing she said be
[55:39] it unto me according to your
[55:41] word and that word came into her womb
[55:45] and created Jesus
[55:47] Christ it was the creative power of God
[55:51] by the word in that case of an angel
[55:54] that went into her womb that created
[55:57] Jesus Christ you think the Holy Ghost is
[55:59] going to create something different in
[56:01] you or
[56:04] I
[56:07] hello if the Holy Ghost created Christ
[56:10] The First Time In the Womb of a woman
[56:11] what it'll do in the womb of your
[56:14] heart now we won't all be wearing robes
[56:17] we won't have the same kind of hair as
[56:19] Jesus had and and so forth but it will
[56:22] create the nature of God in The Bride of
[56:27] Jesus
[56:28] Christ because it's the same Holy Ghost
[56:31] only now that body if I can use that
[56:34] term has moved from the natural physical
[56:38] body of Jesus Christ into a natural
[56:41] physical body we call the Bride of Jesus
[56:45] Christ that's pretty
[56:48] powerful and it's a concept when you
[56:51] know we've done a lot of Youth Camps
[56:52] along the way and I have uh Young people
[56:55] that'll come up come up and even old
[56:57] people too sometimes Oh Brother David I
[56:59] just don't know if I can make it I said
[57:02] well have you received Christ well yeah
[57:05] I said if you got the Holy Ghost well I
[57:07] I I think
[57:08] so well then what do you
[57:12] fearing because if the word of God in
[57:15] the womb of a woman created Christ
[57:17] what's it going to do in the womb of
[57:18] your heart it's going to create Jesus
[57:22] Christ what a concept
[57:25] it can't and if you go back to the
[57:27] simplest form every seed brings forth of
[57:31] its own
[57:32] kind if uh I saw the sister had a little
[57:36] garden out back and I don't I don't know
[57:38] if she planted corn or not but if she
[57:40] did if she planted corn I'm sure that
[57:44] especially in the climate up here she's
[57:45] not going to get
[57:47] pineapples it's just not going to
[57:50] happen and
[57:53] so if you plant a Christ in your heart
[57:55] what are you expecting to
[57:58] grow only Christ will grow now you might
[58:03] pour some concrete over it but like
[58:07] uh even when they pour you know a
[58:09] sidewalk or something you find out the
[58:11] thickest grass comes up around the edges
[58:14] because that seed that was buried under
[58:16] that concrete is growing to wherever it
[58:19] can find
[58:20] light and so we can make it a tougher
[58:23] struggle with some of the things we do
[58:26] but it's still going to produce Jesus
[58:28] Christ I think of Samson and you know he
[58:34] uh H there's some tremendous things we
[58:36] could look at about Samson but you know
[58:39] he did some things that kind of messed
[58:42] looks like in at least in in my mind he
[58:44] messed a few things up but when he got
[58:46] down to the end he accomplished the task
[58:49] that God sent him into the Earth to do
[58:51] said he killed more in his death than he
[58:54] did in his life life so even in his
[58:55] failure he did a better
[59:00] job because that's how God works so with
[59:04] that in mind let's go to Romans the
[59:06] first
[59:09] chapter and we'll just look at we'll
[59:12] follow this concept through the
[59:14] scripture about whatever God said he's
[59:18] going to bring it to pass he's going to
[59:20] create the
[59:21] circumstance to bring it to pass
[59:25] and in uh Romans first chapter Paul a
[59:29] servant of Jesus Christ called to be an
[59:31] apostle separated unto the gospel of God
[59:34] which he had promised a By His prophets
[59:37] in the Holy
[59:40] scriptures concerning his son Jesus
[59:42] Christ Our Lord which was made of the
[59:44] seed of David according to the Flesh and
[59:48] declared to be the Son of God with power
[59:50] according to the spirit of Holiness by
[59:53] the resurrection from the dead again
[59:56] Lord I ask just bring your blessing upon
[59:59] the word in Jesus name amen so as we
[1:00:03] consider what he's saying
[1:00:06] here he's saying that God prophesied
[1:00:08] these
[1:00:09] things he promised through His prophets
[1:00:13] and through the holy scriptures
[1:00:15] concerning his son Jesus Christ that he
[1:00:18] would be made after the seed of David
[1:00:20] according to the flesh now we know that
[1:00:23] David's flesh
[1:00:25] actually as far as natural bloodline
[1:00:28] only goes so far it comes up to Joseph
[1:00:30] because that was following that
[1:00:32] bloodline of of the tribe of Judah and
[1:00:34] he gets to Joseph and Joseph has nothing
[1:00:36] to do with the body of Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ so what's he talking about when
[1:00:42] he says that after the
[1:00:45] flesh after the flesh according to the
[1:00:48] flesh Jesus Christ came out of the seed
[1:00:51] of David so what is this seed of David
[1:00:55] that he's talking
[1:00:57] about says that he was made of the seed
[1:00:59] of David well we know that we just
[1:01:02] mentioned it that God is a Creator and
[1:01:05] that whatever he speaks as to be
[1:01:09] creation it comes forth as whatever God
[1:01:12] thought it should be I don't I don't see
[1:01:14] a light switch in here tonight but I'd
[1:01:15] like to tell people that when God said
[1:01:18] let there be light and the Bible said
[1:01:20] and there
[1:01:21] was that creation never
[1:01:25] stopped it didn't just bang here's light
[1:01:28] and that's it no the light that's in
[1:01:30] here tonight is not the same light when
[1:01:33] you were here last Sunday
[1:01:35] evening it's continuing even the light
[1:01:38] that's happening right now is not the
[1:01:41] same light that it was here when you
[1:01:42] walked in the door because the light is
[1:01:45] continuing to be created once God spoke
[1:01:49] it it's continuing it's going out it's
[1:01:52] going out it's going out out the same
[1:01:55] Sun that went down tonight will come
[1:01:58] back tomorrow but it'll be different
[1:02:00] light it will be new light created Every
[1:02:03] Morning by the word of God it's still
[1:02:06] creating
[1:02:08] light because that's what God Said and
[1:02:11] it will create light throughout eternity
[1:02:14] unless he says
[1:02:16] stop it'll never stop it will continue
[1:02:21] by the creative P the creative power of
[1:02:24] God by his
[1:02:26] word so as we look at this and and we we
[1:02:29] see this what's he talking about after
[1:02:32] the seed of David let's so let's go back
[1:02:35] and look just a little bit about the
[1:02:36] seed of
[1:02:38] David and where it kind of starts in the
[1:02:40] picture is the 1st Samuel chapter
[1:02:45] 16 and I know you're familiar with these
[1:02:49] things and I I love this first
[1:02:53] scripture and and we know that God has
[1:02:55] been dealing with Saul and and and Saul
[1:02:59] just he just didn't have it he was the
[1:03:01] People's Choice and he was essentially a
[1:03:05] good King but he had some real
[1:03:07] Kings he just had some real problems and
[1:03:11] there came a place where God said you
[1:03:13] know s Saul I'm done I'm done messing
[1:03:16] with you you weren't my choice in the
[1:03:19] first place so I'm going to make a
[1:03:22] choice so picking it up there as the has
[1:03:24] it up there and the Lord said unto
[1:03:26] Samuel how long wil thou mourn for Saul
[1:03:29] seeing I have rejected him from reigning
[1:03:32] over
[1:03:34] Israel he says fill thine horn with oil
[1:03:37] and go and I will send thee to Jesse the
[1:03:39] bethleem might and watch these words I
[1:03:44] have provided
[1:03:46] me a king among his sons who's going to
[1:03:50] be showing himself in David God
[1:03:56] God is going to be the king that lives
[1:03:59] in
[1:04:00] David David is only going to be the
[1:04:02] fleshly reaction or the fleshly
[1:04:05] manifestation of what God is going to
[1:04:08] prove himself to be as a
[1:04:15] king God is going to prove himself what
[1:04:19] he is going to be in
[1:04:22] David so he is going to provide himself
[1:04:25] in David and uh and where he even T
[1:04:29] tells him to go he tells him to go to
[1:04:33] Jesse and as you I love the the Hebrew
[1:04:38] language especially because in Hebrew
[1:04:41] each every letter has a number that's
[1:04:43] associated with it and they also have a
[1:04:46] particular meaning that goes with each
[1:04:49] letter often times and how that uh
[1:04:55] when you start to read you know from I I
[1:04:57] like to use the Hebrew dictionary a lot
[1:05:00] uh not because I I want to
[1:05:02] be you know a
[1:05:05] big uh you know a special teacher or
[1:05:08] something but because when I look at the
[1:05:11] dictionary then you see a word and it's
[1:05:13] got four letters in it and you find out
[1:05:15] it has four different meanings and you
[1:05:17] go wow how did that happen and in the
[1:05:21] word jesse there had several different
[1:05:23] meanings means to I
[1:05:25] possess and it also not just I possess
[1:05:29] but it has been substance or
[1:05:32] existence and it also means I exist I
[1:05:36] arise or I come to
[1:05:40] pass
[1:05:41] wow okay prophet of mine Samuel go down
[1:05:46] to where I come to
[1:05:48] pass go to that household go and that
[1:05:52] household where does it happen to be
[1:05:54] in
[1:05:56] Bethlehem go down to
[1:05:59] Bethlehem and and because Jesse I exist
[1:06:04] in
[1:06:06] Bethlehem and we know what that means
[1:06:08] you you've heard you know why little
[1:06:10] Bethlehem you've heard the tape it's
[1:06:12] because Bethlehem means the house of
[1:06:15] God's bread and there's actually one
[1:06:17] more letter or one more little thing in
[1:06:19] there it's the bread for the
[1:06:22] battle so it has a very special I exist
[1:06:27] go down with your horn of oil we know
[1:06:29] that represents the Holy Ghost CU I have
[1:06:32] S I send thee to I exist in the house of
[1:06:36] God's bread for the
[1:06:38] battle and that's how he's going to show
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:42] himself because he said
[1:06:45] I am going to provide me a
[1:06:50] king so we see the word of God come
[1:06:54] coming now unto to this Prophet to this
[1:06:57] prophet Samuel who had to me a special
[1:07:00] he's one I forgot I think it's in the
[1:07:01] book of Acts when it mentions the
[1:07:03] prophets Samuel was one of the ones
[1:07:06] where he started when he mentioned the
[1:07:08] prophets and it's when you think about
[1:07:12] Samuel it's Samuel God was revealed to
[1:07:16] him by the word of the Lord when God
[1:07:19] came to Samuel as a little boy he
[1:07:22] revealed himself by his
[1:07:26] word wow so he's telling this
[1:07:30] Prophet okay I reveal myself to you by
[1:07:34] my word Samuel so now you go down to
[1:07:38] where I exist in the house of my
[1:07:42] bread cuz I'm going to give him bread
[1:07:44] for the battle and I'm going to show me
[1:07:47] as the
[1:07:49] king do you understand all of a sudden
[1:07:52] there was a natural applic
[1:07:56] ation because there was a natural Samuel
[1:07:59] and there was a
[1:08:02] natural uh reaction in Samuel because
[1:08:06] Samuel's natural reaction is said how
[1:08:08] can I
[1:08:09] go CU that's how the next verse starts
[1:08:12] how can I go Saul's going to kill me
[1:08:14] that's the natural man that's the
[1:08:16] natural
[1:08:18] reaction but God tells him you go I'm
[1:08:21] going to provide me a
[1:08:22] king and we know what happens he goes
[1:08:25] down to the house of Jesse he takes the
[1:08:28] sacrifice he calls him together and
[1:08:30] tells them you know I have a job here to
[1:08:32] do and uh when they get there and all
[1:08:36] the different Sons they all line up and
[1:08:39] how that you know the first one he must
[1:08:42] have looked pretty good he was a soldier
[1:08:43] in Saul's
[1:08:45] Army you know fancy uniform whatever
[1:08:48] they used and wore and oh Samuel's like
[1:08:52] oh this is going to be easy right
[1:08:54] no that's not it so then the next one he
[1:08:57] was in Saul's Army too no no no no no no
[1:09:02] no and the natural reaction to Samuel is
[1:09:07] they have prophets have trials just like
[1:09:09] you and I and he's just gone through
[1:09:12] what he thinks all the sons are because
[1:09:13] he doesn't really know Jesse his first
[1:09:16] time there and he's like don't you got
[1:09:19] one more because he's standing there
[1:09:21] with the anointing oil and he's the end
[1:09:24] of the
[1:09:25] line you know
[1:09:29] Jesse I know God sent me here don't you
[1:09:31] have one more see that's the
[1:09:34] natural way of looking at this and
[1:09:37] spiritually he knows he's standing there
[1:09:39] in that annoying oil cuz God told him to
[1:09:43] go do this isn't there one more can you
[1:09:46] imagine just as as people the littlest
[1:09:51] boy you know the youngest one and in
[1:09:53] fact he wasn't even invited to the
[1:09:57] feast there he's the footw flunky
[1:10:01] basically and they said yeah we got one
[1:10:04] more but he's out with the
[1:10:07] Sheep go get
[1:10:10] him okay so here comes David you know
[1:10:14] killed the lion killed the
[1:10:16] bear and he comes in and here he when he
[1:10:19] gets there can you imagine those all
[1:10:21] those
[1:10:22] Brothers
[1:10:25] he smells cuz he's been with the Sheep
[1:10:27] he don't look too good
[1:10:30] and our little brother come on seriously
[1:10:34] Mr you know prophet
[1:10:36] Samuel and but that's the one God said
[1:10:39] that's the one that's the one he has
[1:10:43] something in
[1:10:44] him that can show me as a king number
[1:10:48] one he was a Shepherd Jesus Christ
[1:10:51] is the true Shepherd
[1:10:55] and he looks at this little Shepherd and
[1:10:57] he says that's the one anoint that one
[1:11:01] we know what happened he gets anointed
[1:11:04] and the Bible says that the spirit of
[1:11:06] God came on him from that day forward
[1:11:09] now just take a step into the next day
[1:11:12] they've had the feast you know the
[1:11:13] brothers are all gone doing whatever
[1:11:15] they're doing and here's David and he
[1:11:17] goes back out the next day with his
[1:11:22] staff I'm your new king
[1:11:26] guys popping him with the stick and his
[1:11:29] brothers are probably sitting back there
[1:11:31] they you know some of them are like King
[1:11:34] huh our little brother is a king and
[1:11:37] here here is his kingdom is a bunch of
[1:11:41] sheep but it was
[1:11:43] God providing himself as a king showing
[1:11:48] the shepherd and it comes into great
[1:11:51] play later on in life
[1:11:54] about David and being a
[1:11:56] shepherd and how
[1:11:58] that you know he went right back out to
[1:12:01] the sheep and he did the things that
[1:12:02] Shepherds do with the sheep and and all
[1:12:05] of those things and
[1:12:07] uh then the others they go off to battle
[1:12:10] with Saul and I I know you're familiar
[1:12:13] with the story there how that you know
[1:12:15] this the brothers and stuff they're all
[1:12:17] down there to fight the battle and oh
[1:12:19] they're big and tough right I used to
[1:12:21] think I was tough I don't feel so tough
[1:12:23] anymore more do you older fellas feel
[1:12:26] tough you do you're bet doing better
[1:12:28] than me but uh they you know and then
[1:12:32] here this Goliath gets up and they
[1:12:36] all you know they're down here like
[1:12:39] this peeking over the rocks and here
[1:12:43] comes their little brother now Jesse
[1:12:47] that's the one that I exist told David
[1:12:51] go down and feed your brothers at the
[1:12:54] Battle remember what where they lived
[1:12:57] Bethlehem the house of God spread for
[1:13:00] the
[1:13:01] battle and so here he takes this stuff
[1:13:03] down to see his brothers and Goliath
[1:13:06] comes up and you know they're all hiding
[1:13:08] and shivering in their boots as we'd say
[1:13:12] and
[1:13:14] uh David gets there and
[1:13:16] he jumps up on the Rock and goes what
[1:13:20] are you guys
[1:13:22] doing this what an uncircumcised
[1:13:26] Philistine challenging the armies of the
[1:13:28] Living God what's that in David that's
[1:13:33] God that's the King of Kings is starting
[1:13:37] to expose himself in the life of a
[1:13:41] Shepherd
[1:13:43] boy now what's he exposing well he's
[1:13:47] exposing himself to be the king over the
[1:13:49] battle and David we know what happens he
[1:13:52] goes
[1:13:54] uh and they're all going David get down
[1:13:58] you Troublemaker it says they thought he
[1:13:59] came there to make trouble get down
[1:14:02] you're going to get us all
[1:14:04] killed well
[1:14:06] no he just doesn't want that Philistine
[1:14:09] to rule over
[1:14:10] Israel and so they sent him to Saul and
[1:14:14] Saul you know said hey I admire your
[1:14:17] courage here put my armor on did you
[1:14:20] ever really think about it now Saul's a
[1:14:22] head taller than every and head and
[1:14:24] David's a head
[1:14:25] smaller I personally you don't have to
[1:14:28] accept this part I think they did it to
[1:14:30] mock
[1:14:31] him because they put the coat of mail on
[1:14:34] him and he can't
[1:14:36] move and then they put the you know the
[1:14:39] the breastplate and his arms are hanging
[1:14:42] out the sides and when they put the
[1:14:44] helmet on he can't see
[1:14:46] nothing but he was gracious enough to
[1:14:49] say we know that's nice stuff Saul but I
[1:14:51] can't use that
[1:14:53] and what he went down there with again
[1:14:56] remember this is God expressing himself
[1:15:00] through
[1:15:01] David and it said that when he went to
[1:15:04] face the Philistine we all think about
[1:15:06] the
[1:15:07] sling where did he get the leather for
[1:15:09] the
[1:15:11] sling it doesn't grow on
[1:15:14] trees he had to have made a sacrifice
[1:15:17] somewhere to get that leather in the
[1:15:19] first
[1:15:20] place and when he went to the
[1:15:23] to face him to face the
[1:15:26] Philistine he took stopped at the brook
[1:15:29] of kedron and picked up five it says
[1:15:32] smooth
[1:15:33] stones to use in that sling it only took
[1:15:36] one to kill the
[1:15:38] Philistine but you know I got this phone
[1:15:40] that's just ringing like crazy and I
[1:15:43] thought I had it all shut off but we're
[1:15:44] just going to excuse me for just a
[1:15:47] moment off off I don't need to talk to
[1:15:51] you I don't know who you are
[1:15:53] so
[1:15:55] stop
[1:15:57] sorry I thought I had it off modern
[1:16:01] technology thank you but
[1:16:04] uh so he picked up these five smooth
[1:16:08] stones and I like to use this par that
[1:16:11] particular part of the
[1:16:13] scripture because it only took one to
[1:16:15] kill the Philistine but when we're
[1:16:17] preaching Divine
[1:16:18] Healing I don't care what's your uh you
[1:16:22] know what's your problem is I I I you
[1:16:25] know I mean I care a as a
[1:16:28] man but five smooth Stones I am the god
[1:16:31] that Health all of your
[1:16:33] diseases he sent his word and healed the
[1:16:37] people Believers lay hands on the sick
[1:16:39] and they shall
[1:16:41] recover uh the prayer of faith shall
[1:16:43] save the sick and
[1:16:46] uh yeah I said I am the guy anyway
[1:16:49] there's five of them uh and how that he
[1:16:52] picked up
[1:16:54] you got five Stones friend I don't care
[1:16:56] what you if you got cancer I don't care
[1:16:58] what you call it what it is uh with his
[1:17:01] stripes you healed that's number five
[1:17:04] you got five Stones go kill that
[1:17:07] devil but you have to put it into
[1:17:10] action and the other thing that when he
[1:17:12] went to face that Philistine with he had
[1:17:14] the shepherd's
[1:17:16] staff you know what the prophet of God
[1:17:18] said that staff
[1:17:20] represented
[1:17:22] Calvary The Old Rugged
[1:17:24] Cross so he goes down with Calvary with
[1:17:29] it's Christ I mean it's God in David
[1:17:32] showing himself what he's doing to
[1:17:35] become king and so he goes and he faces
[1:17:38] him with The Old Rugged Cross and what
[1:17:41] do the stones represent a revelation
[1:17:44] because when Peter came to went to you
[1:17:47] know Jesus said Peter who do you say
[1:17:49] that I am and I like to ask that
[1:17:51] question every service of I can who do
[1:17:53] you say that he
[1:17:56] is and Peter said you're the Christ the
[1:17:59] son of the Living God and he said on
[1:18:01] this Stone I'll build on this Stone this
[1:18:04] Revelation I'll build my church for
[1:18:07] Flesh and Blood hath not Reeve this to
[1:18:09] you but my Father which is in
[1:18:13] heaven and so he goes down with the
[1:18:16] Revelation he has God in his hand and
[1:18:19] God in the
[1:18:21] sling and how that when he it says that
[1:18:24] the the stone hit the the you know
[1:18:27] Goliath in the forehead and when he fell
[1:18:30] and let's just pick it up there I think
[1:18:33] it's
[1:18:35] in in
[1:18:37] 17 in chapter 17:
[1:18:41] 50 it says and David
[1:18:44] prevailed over the Philistine with a
[1:18:47] sling and with a stone and smote the
[1:18:49] Philistine and slew him but there was no
[1:18:52] sword in the hand of
[1:18:54] David so he prevailed he overcame this
[1:19:00] Philistine with a sling and with a stone
[1:19:03] and smote him and killed him but he
[1:19:05] didn't have a sword but Watch What
[1:19:08] Happens because again this comes into
[1:19:10] play this is God showing us
[1:19:14] himself in the life or In the Flesh of
[1:19:17] David and
[1:19:19] so it said that David R man and he stood
[1:19:24] upon the Philistine and took his sword
[1:19:26] he drew it out of the sheath thereof and
[1:19:29] slew him and cut off his head therewith
[1:19:33] and when the Philistines saw their
[1:19:34] Champion was dead they
[1:19:37] fled
[1:19:38] what just
[1:19:42] happened now David's just killed this
[1:19:44] guy with the the stone and the sling and
[1:19:48] now he runs over remember this is a big
[1:19:50] guy and David's the little drink drink
[1:19:52] of water and he jumps up on him and he
[1:19:56] picks up this
[1:19:57] sword that belongs to Goliath and he
[1:20:00] slays
[1:20:01] him cuts his head off it's God showing
[1:20:07] us himself in the life and In the Flesh
[1:20:10] of David let's go to Genesis 49 and
[1:20:13] watch just what
[1:20:16] happened praise the Lord you said we
[1:20:19] could do this brother so we'll are you
[1:20:22] okay every everybody's all right if you
[1:20:23] get tired you need to go out I it's
[1:20:26] you're not you know the brother said he
[1:20:27] put new batteries and they're worth
[1:20:29] eight hours so thank you
[1:20:33] brother and so in Genesis
[1:20:37] 49:8 this is where Jacob has called all
[1:20:40] his sons together and he's beginning to
[1:20:42] to speak over
[1:20:44] them Their Blessings or in some cases
[1:20:48] curses as far as the word of the Lord
[1:20:50] concerning their tribes and he comes
[1:20:53] down to Judah in verse 8
[1:20:57] 49:8 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[1:21:01] shall praise and then there's those two
[1:21:03] little dots there's things in the
[1:21:05] message that uh brother Stan price I
[1:21:09] don't know if you know him he's down in
[1:21:11] Florida and he was talking about
[1:21:14] recently we traveled together for a
[1:21:16] little bit and he he said it really
[1:21:18] struck him one time because he was going
[1:21:21] to preach on uh Song of Solomon and he
[1:21:24] thought he could do it in about you know
[1:21:25] five or six messages right well he said
[1:21:27] a year later he finished the last one
[1:21:30] and he said it was because God told him
[1:21:32] slow down and then brought to his memory
[1:21:36] where brother Brandon was hunting with
[1:21:37] the old Indian guide and he said and the
[1:21:41] old Indian told him you know white man
[1:21:45] WTH You know lookth once walketh nine
[1:21:48] time he said the Indian look nine times
[1:21:50] walk once and he said if we slow down
[1:21:54] and really look at
[1:21:56] things those two dots you know they're
[1:21:59] all over in the scripture you know
[1:22:01] brother brandom said that represents a
[1:22:03] time frame so there's time he said in
[1:22:06] the one scripture he used in this day
[1:22:08] the scriptures fulfilled her in uh birth
[1:22:11] pains he said there was 2,000 years
[1:22:13] between those two
[1:22:17] dots
[1:22:19] now Judah Thou Art he whom thy bre and
[1:22:22] shall praise time
[1:22:25] frame thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:22:28] the ene of thine enemies time frame thy
[1:22:32] father's children shall bow down before
[1:22:35] thee what are we looking
[1:22:38] at Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall
[1:22:42] praise did they praise David when he won
[1:22:44] the battle after the battle was over
[1:22:47] they did but there's a more important
[1:22:50] verse there that he said thy hand shall
[1:22:53] be in the neck of thine enemies that's
[1:22:55] not talking about a nice
[1:22:58] massage no the neck of the enemy when
[1:23:00] you break it down it means to cut the
[1:23:02] head off because it's to sever the
[1:23:05] headship of the enemy what's the first
[1:23:08] thing David did when he jumped up on
[1:23:12] that giant and cut his head off he could
[1:23:15] have went back and pointed to Genesis 49
[1:23:18] and said this day this scripture is
[1:23:21] fulfilled because he cut the head off of
[1:23:25] the
[1:23:26] enemy but it was God showing here is the
[1:23:31] Fulfillment of a scripture one of the
[1:23:35] fulfillments of a scripture out of
[1:23:37] Genesis 49 that came as a blessing from
[1:23:40] God through the prophet Jacob that has
[1:23:43] traveled through
[1:23:47] history
[1:23:49] yes this prophecy came from forth and
[1:23:53] God from that moment on began to put all
[1:23:56] the pieces
[1:23:58] together to bring it to pass a few
[1:24:02] hundred years from the time that this
[1:24:04] prophecy is
[1:24:06] given this circumstance and this one
[1:24:09] begat this one and this brother you know
[1:24:11] he just fell in love with this one
[1:24:12] sister named
[1:24:15] Rahab she's so
[1:24:18] beautiful but what was it it was God
[1:24:22] setting the stage to bring that
[1:24:25] scripture right there to
[1:24:27] pass that he would put his hand in the
[1:24:30] neck of the
[1:24:32] enemies and then you can run it again
[1:24:35] but every has compound meaning compound
[1:24:37] Revelation brother brandom said and the
[1:24:39] father's children shall bow down before
[1:24:42] thee what is
[1:24:46] it every knee shall
[1:24:49] bow every tongue confess you see how God
[1:24:54] begins to weave it together peace by
[1:24:57] piece to fulfill this portion and
[1:25:00] sometimes you'll not just fulfill it
[1:25:02] once he'll fulfill it again and again
[1:25:06] and again just like the
[1:25:08] light he continually fulfills it by the
[1:25:12] creative power of almighty God because
[1:25:15] he is a
[1:25:19] Creator and so we
[1:25:21] see God fulfilling that boy if I get
[1:25:25] into verse 9 we got a whole another
[1:25:27] message going because it's three comings
[1:25:29] of Jesus Christ go home and read it
[1:25:33] verse
[1:25:34] 9:49 and so we look at
[1:25:39] uh David and how that he fulfills that
[1:25:44] he cut the head off of that enemy and he
[1:25:47] fulfills Genesis 49 or a piece of
[1:25:50] Genesis 49:8 and how that that's what
[1:25:54] are we talking we started with the seed
[1:25:57] of David what is the seed of David it's
[1:26:02] Christ it was the word of the Lord is
[1:26:06] the seed of
[1:26:08] David because the word came to the
[1:26:12] prophet who was sent to a certain place
[1:26:16] to a certain brother's household to
[1:26:19] anoint himself the king and so it's
[1:26:23] I don't know why my nose is running all
[1:26:24] of a
[1:26:26] sudden excuse
[1:26:28] me but uh how
[1:26:32] that it's the word of
[1:26:36] God being
[1:26:38] manifested and so here he is he has
[1:26:41] fulfilled that part of that scripture
[1:26:44] and we know then that after that his
[1:26:46] brothers praised him because you know
[1:26:48] Saul has killed his thousands David has
[1:26:50] killed his 10 thousands which Paul Saul
[1:26:53] was not happy about that of course and
[1:26:56] because he's thinks he's still the king
[1:26:58] but according to the word of the Lord he
[1:27:01] wasn't and
[1:27:04] how so we see this and we continue
[1:27:09] through the life of David and it's God
[1:27:13] revealing
[1:27:14] himself of some part of God that's going
[1:27:17] to be revealed in the scripture and it
[1:27:20] can be as that one was past
[1:27:23] tense and yet it can also be future
[1:27:26] tense because with God he created
[1:27:30] time he lives in eternity he can step in
[1:27:33] and out of it any time he wants
[1:27:37] to because he's God and
[1:27:41] so but now he's expressing himself as
[1:27:44] the king through David and how we know
[1:27:47] that David you know got chased by by
[1:27:50] Saul and Saul's armies
[1:27:53] and how that think about it the king the
[1:27:56] anointed king this Great and Mighty
[1:27:59] Warrior that killed Goliath and he's
[1:28:01] hiding in the back of a
[1:28:04] cave afraid to go anywhere just him and
[1:28:07] his one buddy and they're going looking
[1:28:09] you know peeking out of the cave going
[1:28:11] what are we going to
[1:28:13] do and you know come morning they're
[1:28:16] going to come in here and kill us all or
[1:28:18] kill us and and you know probably snuck
[1:28:21] out of the cave that night I mean I
[1:28:23] somehow they got out of there but what
[1:28:27] was
[1:28:28] it well the natural side was they had to
[1:28:32] get out of the cave because David is
[1:28:34] Anointed to be the next
[1:28:38] king but what is
[1:28:40] it it's Christ brother brand I just was
[1:28:43] listening to it the other day he said
[1:28:45] God hid
[1:28:48] himself in the Tomb by Death from
[1:28:53] Israel David is hiding himself in the
[1:28:59] rock as good as
[1:29:02] Dead from the armies of
[1:29:06] Israel think about what's going on right
[1:29:08] now
[1:29:10] friends see he was hiding
[1:29:13] himself in that cave he was fulfilling a
[1:29:17] certain part of
[1:29:19] scripture that may or
[1:29:22] that came to pass once when David was in
[1:29:25] the I mean when Christ was in the Tomb
[1:29:28] and perhaps is coming to pass again
[1:29:32] today I don't
[1:29:34] know I don't have that prophetic Vision
[1:29:37] that I can tell you but I know this that
[1:29:39] that word goes on and on and
[1:29:43] on and so there comes a certain place
[1:29:47] and I love God's sense of humor because
[1:29:50] there comes a place where David Goes
[1:29:51] Down to the one king running from Saul
[1:29:54] running for his life and he goes down to
[1:29:56] this one king and can you
[1:29:59] imagine here's the mighty Goliath
[1:30:02] killer and he goes to this King and he's
[1:30:05] asking basically for uh you know not
[1:30:09] assistance necessarily but uh for like
[1:30:14] uh help he needs a place to live because
[1:30:17] he's getting tired of running from Saul
[1:30:20] and can you imagine this King his guys
[1:30:23] are standing there looking at isn't this
[1:30:25] the one that you know they said slew the
[1:30:30] 10,000s and they're looking at their
[1:30:31] King and they're ready to draw their
[1:30:33] swords and kill this guy and here's our
[1:30:36] next King David in this case throws
[1:30:40] himself on the ground and starts Thro
[1:30:43] around like a wild man a crazy
[1:30:46] man and they're all here they're ready
[1:30:48] to kill him and now they're backing away
[1:30:50] from him did you know that country had a
[1:30:52] law that said they couldn't kill a crazy
[1:30:55] man he knew exactly what he was doing so
[1:30:59] sometimes if you're acting crazy I had a
[1:31:02] friend that worked in a sane Asylum he
[1:31:04] said the best way to subdue a crazy man
[1:31:06] is to act crazier than he
[1:31:08] is he said it really works so if y'all
[1:31:12] think I'm crazy that's
[1:31:15] good just depends on what you think
[1:31:17] crazy is but uh so here he is you know
[1:31:21] doing this action for the king but he's
[1:31:24] using it the whole time to his own
[1:31:27] benefit for the kingdom of God but there
[1:31:30] comes a certain place actually just
[1:31:32] before that before he goes down there
[1:31:35] that the strangest thing
[1:31:38] happens and we'll turn to 1st Samuel
[1:31:43] 21 because we're talking about the
[1:31:48] concept of the word of God expressing
[1:31:52] himself and in this time through the
[1:31:54] seed of
[1:31:57] David and
[1:31:59] in 1 Samuel chapter 21 we see another
[1:32:04] strange
[1:32:06] event in the life of
[1:32:09] David and in this case Jonathan and
[1:32:14] David have met for the last
[1:32:17] time
[1:32:19] and he says go in peace
[1:32:22] and they swore a covenant between
[1:32:25] them and it said that uh Jonathan went
[1:32:28] back to the city and David takes off
[1:32:30] because he's afraid Saul's going to kill
[1:32:32] him in verse in chapter 21 it says then
[1:32:36] David came to Knob to a himc the priest
[1:32:40] and a himc was afraid at the meeting of
[1:32:43] David and said unto him why art thou
[1:32:45] alone and no man with thee and David
[1:32:47] says unto him like the priest the king
[1:32:49] hath commanded me a business and has
[1:32:51] said un unto me let no man know anything
[1:32:53] of the business whereabout I send thee
[1:32:55] and what have I commanded
[1:32:57] Thee I have appointed thee or I have
[1:33:00] appointed my servants to such and such a
[1:33:03] place
[1:33:05] now either David just
[1:33:08] lied because Saul the king did not
[1:33:13] command David to go do this or there's
[1:33:17] that outside guy or on the inside
[1:33:22] God is saying the king's business hath
[1:33:24] sent me
[1:33:26] here because the king's business is to
[1:33:29] bring David to power as the
[1:33:33] king do you understand every
[1:33:36] scripture has compound meaning and
[1:33:39] compound Revelation and we look at it
[1:33:42] from the natural aspect David you liar
[1:33:46] Saul never sent you down there but from
[1:33:48] the supernatural aspect the king's
[1:33:53] business the king's business commanded
[1:33:56] him to do this and
[1:34:01] so he goes down there and we know we're
[1:34:04] familiar again with the story I assume
[1:34:06] that we are uh he asks do you have any
[1:34:10] bread and again this comes up as a
[1:34:14] future thing that's going to happen
[1:34:18] because David is asking for bread and
[1:34:21] the only bread that the priest has he he
[1:34:25] said is the shoe
[1:34:26] bread which was only for the
[1:34:30] priest to
[1:34:32] eat and and the priest you know may he
[1:34:36] said he was a little nervous that David
[1:34:37] was even there but he said here okay you
[1:34:40] can have this bread and we fast forward
[1:34:42] into the future where Jesus when the
[1:34:45] disciples are out picking the corn on
[1:34:47] the Sabbath day and the the the scribes
[1:34:50] and Pharisees they want to uh hey what's
[1:34:54] with your Apostles they're breaking the
[1:34:56] law Jesus said is not it written in your
[1:35:00] prophets that David ate the shoe bread
[1:35:03] which was unlawful for him to
[1:35:06] eat see it moving moving through time
[1:35:11] and so they give him the the shoe bread
[1:35:13] and there's there's other things we
[1:35:14] could look at with that and uh in verse
[1:35:19] 7 there was a man from Saul
[1:35:22] who saw this and
[1:35:23] eventually he took the life of that
[1:35:27] priest because that priest gave David
[1:35:31] the shoe
[1:35:32] bread
[1:35:34] but David's a
[1:35:37] prophet you believe
[1:35:39] that sure he was the Psalms are in the
[1:35:43] book David wrote A lot of
[1:35:45] them he's a prophet he
[1:35:48] is God's representative in a man of what
[1:35:53] God is going to become as the
[1:35:57] king and it says
[1:36:00] that after they've eaten and David in
[1:36:03] verse eight and David said unto the himc
[1:36:04] is there not here under thy hand a spear
[1:36:06] or a sword I have neither brought my
[1:36:08] sword nor my weapon with me because the
[1:36:10] king's business required haste he had to
[1:36:13] get on this right
[1:36:15] away because Saul wanted to kill
[1:36:19] him wow the types and Shadows
[1:36:23] Lord and the priest answers and says
[1:36:26] this when you come to church you expect
[1:36:28] him you know to get AKs or something
[1:36:31] here off the wall and you know have all
[1:36:33] these weapons to fight
[1:36:34] with but David goes to this priest and
[1:36:38] says I need a
[1:36:39] weapon I need a sword and the priest
[1:36:43] answers in verse 9 the sword of Goliath
[1:36:45] the Philistine whom th slew in the
[1:36:47] valley of elaw behold it is here wrapped
[1:36:50] in a cloth behind the ephod if thou Wilt
[1:36:52] take it take that take it for there's no
[1:36:55] other save that here and David said
[1:36:59] there's none like it give it to
[1:37:02] me give it to me now what are we
[1:37:06] recognizing here
[1:37:09] okay on the
[1:37:11] altar they would hang the ephod over the
[1:37:14] front of the alter and I assume perhaps
[1:37:19] on this one they had the uran thumb and
[1:37:21] and stuff they would hang those things
[1:37:24] there by The Altar and then the altar is
[1:37:27] behind that and he said that this
[1:37:31] sword he said is uh it's wrapped in a
[1:37:35] cloth behind the
[1:37:38] ephod and so behind the ephod there in
[1:37:41] the Altar and uh he said it's you know
[1:37:45] you you took it from Goliath anyway and
[1:37:50] he said said and so David he said it's
[1:37:53] the only one I've
[1:37:54] got and David he the high the priest
[1:37:58] hands the sword to David and it's
[1:38:03] wrapped it's all wrapped up and David
[1:38:07] has just said there's no sword like that
[1:38:09] one give it to me we
[1:38:14] know again fast forward book of Acts it
[1:38:17] says that David was a man after God's
[1:38:20] Own
[1:38:22] heart what did he just receive from the
[1:38:26] priest and the word of God is sharper
[1:38:29] than a two-edged sh
[1:38:31] sword dividing aunder from the uh the
[1:38:35] joints the marrow the spirit the
[1:38:38] soul and he said there's no sword like
[1:38:40] that sword he receives as it were the
[1:38:45] word and you
[1:38:47] say what are you talking
[1:38:50] about remember it's
[1:38:52] God revealing himself in David and he he
[1:38:57] takes that sword and begins to unravel
[1:39:01] it from that
[1:39:05] cloth what is it it's a prophecy of God
[1:39:10] down through several hundred years to
[1:39:14] there were in the same country shepherds
[1:39:17] abiding over their flocks by night and
[1:39:19] lo the angel of the Lord came upon him
[1:39:23] and said today is born in the city of
[1:39:26] Bethlehem a savior who is Christ the
[1:39:30] lord and this shall be a sign unto
[1:39:34] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[1:39:37] swaddling
[1:39:44] cloth is Christ it's Christ in David
[1:39:49] it's Christ in the altar it's Christ in
[1:39:51] the priest it's Christ in the prophecy
[1:39:55] of the
[1:39:59] sword praise the
[1:40:02] lord we mentioned
[1:40:05] that uh he said you guys aren't very
[1:40:09] loud not to worry about
[1:40:11] it and I never worry about it anyway
[1:40:14] because brother that got me started
[1:40:16] ministering years ago 197 probably 475
[1:40:22] he was a Shepherd boy from Leon
[1:40:25] Idaho and he said David CU you know as
[1:40:29] when I first started preaching you
[1:40:30] always expected you know people to jump
[1:40:32] up and down and say Amen kick the pews
[1:40:35] over
[1:40:36] and I preached a couple of times and
[1:40:39] nobody said
[1:40:40] anything and I said brother
[1:40:43] Sergeant I don't understand he said
[1:40:46] brother the Sheep never bleed when
[1:40:49] they're
[1:40:49] feeding
[1:40:51] so it's all right y'all be quiet as much
[1:40:54] as you
[1:40:55] want praise the Lord and so we see it's
[1:41:00] Christ manifesting and prophesying
[1:41:03] through
[1:41:05] David how he's going to even
[1:41:07] come as the sword the word what Mary
[1:41:12] said be it unto me according to your
[1:41:13] word and how did the word come wrapped
[1:41:17] in swaddling
[1:41:19] cloth every word points us to Jesus
[1:41:23] Christ somehow and we're talking about
[1:41:26] the seed of David and how it's traveling
[1:41:29] through history and how it's traveling
[1:41:32] in his life and through his life as he
[1:41:35] goes we know
[1:41:36] that you know eventually he fulfills the
[1:41:41] scripture I think it's in 1 Chronicles
[1:41:44] 11 that's the wrong one but it's in
[1:41:46] Chronicles 11 and 13 it said that Jew
[1:41:50] Judah and Israel came together and
[1:41:53] anointed David King over all of Israel
[1:41:58] what was the first prophecy to Samuel go
[1:42:02] anoint me a
[1:42:03] king and so David is Anointed as a king
[1:42:07] by all of
[1:42:10] Israel at the
[1:42:12] Fulfillment of the word of God through a
[1:42:16] prophet's
[1:42:17] Ministry you think he's going to leave
[1:42:19] you un anointed
[1:42:22] do we really think that God is not going
[1:42:25] to anoint this bride to bring forth
[1:42:27] Jesus
[1:42:29] Christ he can only create that which is
[1:42:33] in him I love
[1:42:35] him but there's
[1:42:38] another in this one I I've heard people
[1:42:41] say well but David
[1:42:44] Fell
[1:42:45] well it looks like it he took a wife
[1:42:49] that he shouldn't have
[1:42:52] took and I don't have the information
[1:42:55] with me about what B sheba's husband was
[1:42:59] and stuff but I believe the word the
[1:43:01] name Bas Sheba means the child of the
[1:43:06] oath God made an
[1:43:10] oath and David takes her in adultery and
[1:43:13] I'm not here to uh condone
[1:43:16] adultery but because of that adultery we
[1:43:19] know that
[1:43:21] eventually David winds up going losing
[1:43:24] his kingdom and he goes up this hill and
[1:43:27] he sits down on a certain Rock and weeps
[1:43:29] over
[1:43:32] Jerusalem as he sees his kingdom being
[1:43:35] taken away from
[1:43:36] him 600 years later Jesus Christ walked
[1:43:41] up the same Hill and we wept over
[1:43:46] Jerusalem it was Christ or God in David
[1:43:50] the the word of God in David so what
[1:43:53] just happened what sent David to that
[1:43:56] place
[1:43:59] adultery what sent Jesus Christ to that
[1:44:02] same place and you can unravel all the
[1:44:05] way back to the Garden of Eden it was
[1:44:08] adultery because under the law which was
[1:44:10] not even written says if a man seduce a
[1:44:13] woman he shall utterly she shall utterly
[1:44:16] become his wife and when the serpent
[1:44:18] took her she became his
[1:44:22] wife and when Adam took her it actually
[1:44:25] even though she was part of him it
[1:44:27] became an act of adultery it was
[1:44:30] adultery that sent Christ to that same
[1:44:35] Rock it's all Christ
[1:44:37] friends but what else there's something
[1:44:40] else in between when he was on that
[1:44:43] rock and when he took bath
[1:44:47] Sheba there's another Prophet on the
[1:44:49] scene now and he comes to David and
[1:44:52] what's he
[1:44:54] do David's the
[1:44:56] king he's got all this power he's got
[1:44:59] these armies he's got I don't know how
[1:45:01] many wives by this time and he's got all
[1:45:04] this stuff and all and he's this he has
[1:45:08] become the king over all Israel all
[1:45:11] Judah and here he's done this heinous
[1:45:16] act and and this Prophet comes to him
[1:45:20] and he tells him the story of a
[1:45:23] shepherd and David think about it his
[1:45:28] mind going back to those sheep and how
[1:45:31] important one sheep was that he risked
[1:45:35] his life to kill a
[1:45:37] lion and he risked his life to kill a
[1:45:40] bear and oh the righteous indignation
[1:45:43] begins to raise
[1:45:45] up because he knows the value if that
[1:45:49] man only had one one sheep he understood
[1:45:52] the value and he said that man should
[1:45:55] die and have you ever read it
[1:45:58] closely the very
[1:46:01] words that the serpent used to deceive
[1:46:07] Eve Thou shalt not surely die were the
[1:46:11] same words that the prophet spoke to
[1:46:14] David to Grant him the grace of
[1:46:18] God David said that man shall die he
[1:46:21] said you'll not surely die
[1:46:26] David do you talk about
[1:46:29] Grace but it's more than just sparing
[1:46:32] the life of
[1:46:33] David there's more to it because
[1:46:35] remember this is God showing himself as
[1:46:39] king
[1:46:40] Hallelujah because if a woman and a man
[1:46:44] were caught in adultery they were both
[1:46:46] supposed to be stoned and killed
[1:46:51] and that Grace that came through our
[1:46:54] David Jesus Christ stood there to spare
[1:46:59] that child of the oath who was going to
[1:47:02] bring the next king of
[1:47:05] Israel because the bride could not be
[1:47:09] stoned if the husband was not
[1:47:15] stoned nobody can get to
[1:47:18] you without going through Jesus
[1:47:22] Christ because she was spared through
[1:47:26] David we are spared through the life of
[1:47:30] Jesus
[1:47:32] Christ do we understand every
[1:47:37] scripture compound meaning compound
[1:47:39] Revelation there was a natural man a
[1:47:42] natural woman a natural adultery there
[1:47:45] was a spiritual adultery from the garden
[1:47:48] that brought a spiritual King
[1:47:50] to weep from the same place and he wept
[1:47:54] for
[1:47:55] Jerusalem and we know that
[1:47:58] Jerusalem will be
[1:48:01] redeemed yet to come so we see the god
[1:48:06] fulfilling over and over and over and
[1:48:10] creating all the circumstances and
[1:48:13] putting the people in the right spots
[1:48:16] and the right with the right words to
[1:48:19] say the right thing things to bring to
[1:48:22] pass the word of
[1:48:25] God praise the
[1:48:29] Lord and we know
[1:48:33] that eventually he was given back his
[1:48:42] kingdom and how
[1:48:45] that he retook the throne after much
[1:48:48] struggles and temptation ations trials
[1:48:52] and all of
[1:48:54] that but it was the
[1:48:56] seed of David that seed of David was the
[1:49:02] word of God that started when God told
[1:49:05] the prophet anoint me a
[1:49:10] king and through that anointing God the
[1:49:14] word of God took the life of David to
[1:49:18] show us the life of Jesus
[1:49:21] Christ over and over and over we think
[1:49:26] of David at the The Well of
[1:49:29] Bethlehem and how he just all his his
[1:49:32] desire was oh if I just if I could just
[1:49:34] have a drink from The Well of Beth of
[1:49:36] him and it was Gentiles that fought
[1:49:39] their way to the
[1:49:40] well and brought back the water and when
[1:49:43] I was younger Christian I used to really
[1:49:46] disturb me because it you know after
[1:49:48] they did all this the life the B the
[1:49:50] Bible says they laid their lives in
[1:49:53] Jeopardy to bring him that drink of
[1:49:56] water and he gets that drink of
[1:49:59] water how would you feel in the natural
[1:50:02] friend if you know maybe you got a few
[1:50:05] scars on you and you're going to hang on
[1:50:07] with a bruise for the rest of your life
[1:50:09] or whatever and and here's your king or
[1:50:12] you're soon to be king and he dumps it
[1:50:14] out on the
[1:50:18] ground it was
[1:50:21] Christ it was Christ showing that from
[1:50:24] The Well of Bethlehem comes the water
[1:50:27] and it was Christ pouring him out
[1:50:30] himself out for you and I because he
[1:50:34] said in the 22nd Psalm written by David
[1:50:38] after he had fallen into the
[1:50:41] adultery I am poured out like
[1:50:47] water God showing him himself
[1:50:51] again he poured himself out for you and
[1:50:57] I
[1:50:59] wow praise the
[1:51:02] Lord I just stand
[1:51:06] amazed over and over and over let's look
[1:51:10] at Acts chapter
[1:51:14] 13 do you love him I
[1:51:18] just
[1:51:20] wow
[1:51:34] Jesus I have 13 let's
[1:51:38] see verse 22 there we
[1:51:43] go and here
[1:51:47] is he's talking there
[1:51:52] and he starts through the you know the
[1:51:54] the things that the Lord has done there
[1:51:57] for the Jews and he comes
[1:52:01] to verse 21 acts 13 and 21 and after
[1:52:06] they desired a king and God gave unto
[1:52:09] them Saul the son of CIS a man of the
[1:52:12] tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40
[1:52:16] years and when he had removed moved him
[1:52:20] he raised up unto them David to be their
[1:52:24] King to whom also he gave testimony and
[1:52:28] said I have found David the son of Jesse
[1:52:31] a man after mine own heart which shall
[1:52:34] fulfill all my
[1:52:36] will and of this man's seed hath God
[1:52:40] according to his promise raised unto
[1:52:42] Israel a
[1:52:44] savior
[1:52:48] Jesus David
[1:52:51] desired God's
[1:52:53] heart I have found the son of Jesse the
[1:52:58] son of the man who
[1:53:02] exists whose name means existence whose
[1:53:05] name means to arise or come to
[1:53:09] pass I have found this
[1:53:14] man a man after my own heart and he
[1:53:18] shall fulfill F my
[1:53:22] will who shall fulfill the
[1:53:25] will it's that
[1:53:28] sword David received the sword and we
[1:53:32] receive the sword as it
[1:53:36] were the sword of the Lord the word of
[1:53:39] God every
[1:53:41] scripture has different strata different
[1:53:46] layers in which we can look and every
[1:53:49] scripture Prophet said after the seals
[1:53:51] every scripture somehow will point us to
[1:53:56] Jesus
[1:53:57] Christ I hope tonight you have seen
[1:54:01] Jesus Christ in this
[1:54:06] Bible because he's in every
[1:54:12] word every
[1:54:14] single
[1:54:17] word pray for us pray for me
[1:54:22] uh we could get into the Seed of Abraham
[1:54:25] tomorrow night if you'd
[1:54:27] like and
[1:54:29] uh also an interesting thing or we could
[1:54:32] look at the seed of job who also had a
[1:54:36] large
[1:54:37] part in this
[1:54:40] Bible
[1:54:42] uh we love
[1:54:45] him
[1:54:47] and it's the house of God 's bread to
[1:54:51] where we have come
[1:54:52] tonight and I hope this gives you
[1:54:55] strength for the
[1:54:57] battle I like the book of Colossians I

[1:55:02] chapter he tells them to
[1:55:04] have this book read also to the to the
[1:55:08] ladyo Le oans however you pronounce it
[1:55:11] brother Bram used to say lady
[1:55:14] oans and he said because there is let's
[1:55:18] I'll I'll let's just close with that
[1:55:19] it's in Colossians the 2
[1:55:21] chapter to help us
[1:55:30] understand when Paul is preaching these
[1:55:33] things
[1:55:36] uh is second chapter of Colossians verse
[1:55:39] one for I would that ye knew what great
[1:55:42] conflict I have for you and for them at
[1:55:46] leoda for this for as many as have not
[1:55:49] seen my face in the
[1:55:53] flesh have we seen his face in the
[1:55:58] flesh not Paul never did I've not seen
[1:56:03] the fleshly man of Jesus face to face
[1:56:06] but you know what I'm part of that
[1:56:10] Conflict for I would that ye knew what a
[1:56:13] great conflict I have for you and for
[1:56:15] them that are lisans that's us we are in
[1:56:18] a conf lict we are in a Warfare and this

[1:56:50] ministry there in just for a minute
[1:56:53] sister yes yes if it's all right and so
[1:56:56] they kind of rebuked me and I CU I used
[1:56:58] to write a lot and sing a lot and I
[1:57:01] haven't done very much in the last few
[1:57:03] years I guess
[1:57:05] circumstance uh overtook me but uh I'd
[1:57:10] like to sing a particular song let's
[1:57:11] pray first Lord
[1:57:14] Jesus truly Lord we have come to you
[1:57:16] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:57:18] this people have
[1:57:19] received you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:24] if there be anything Lord any seed or
[1:57:28] something said that have not has not
[1:57:30] pointed them to you Lord I would never
[1:57:32] do that intentionally I never want
[1:57:34] anyone to look at me I'm not worthy to
[1:57:37] even be looked at as the Gentile woman
[1:57:40] said Lord just give me the crumbs from
[1:57:42] the
[1:57:44] table she
[1:57:46] knew you called her a dog and and she
[1:57:49] said master all I wants the
[1:57:52] crumbs so Lord even if all we get is the
[1:57:55] crumbs Lord just remember the Bride of
[1:57:57] Jesus Christ tonight and there's enough
[1:58:00] power in those
[1:58:01] crumbs to Grant her healing for her
[1:58:05] daughter to Grant her a
[1:58:07] position in your word that Jesus said
[1:58:11] where have I seen such great faith so we
[1:58:16] give you this word tonight that they
[1:58:19] might take it and gather Faith around it
[1:58:21] to realize you are the Creator and you
[1:58:25] have created a life and a nature in them
[1:58:30] through your beloved Son Jesus
[1:58:33] Christ and by this word of God we give
[1:58:36] this service to you in Jesus Christ's
[1:58:39] name
[1:58:41] amen so if it's all right I

[2:25:00] savior and
[2:25:02] that the F
[2:25:05] live in
[2:25:09] me you know as he was speaking there
[2:25:12] tonight
[2:25:13] and you know he talked about Christ
[2:25:16] revealing himself and David and David
[2:25:19] was a shepherd and not a king yet it was
[2:25:22] still
[2:25:23] Christ then David goes and he kills
[2:25:25] Goliath and it's Christ again and then
[2:25:28] it's David going and running from his
[2:25:32] enemies and it's Christ
[2:25:34] again and is David getting in hard spots
[2:25:37] in life and it's Christ again and it's
[2:25:41] David guarding and helping people and
[2:25:42] they don't know he's there and it's
[2:25:44] Christ again and then he goes and asks
[2:25:46] for something something and they reject
[2:25:47] him and it's Christ again then he gets
[2:25:50] the kingdom and it's Christ and then he
[2:25:51] loses the kingdom and it's Christ and
[2:25:54] it's the ups and downs and the ins and
[2:25:56] outs and it's all Christ and we think
[2:25:58] that as the bride of Christ it's all
[2:26:00] going to be UPS it's all going to be
[2:26:02] victories but remember it's how we go
[2:26:04] through the trials that prove what's in
[2:26:06] us not just the victory but you got to
[2:26:08] go through the trial you got to go
[2:26:09] through the battle to come to the Christ
[2:26:11] that's on the other side the the great
[2:26:13] Victor the king of kings and Lord of
[2:26:15] lords so tonight don't just say well I'm
[2:26:18] down here that's Christ still that's
[2:26:21] right that's right but remember he
[2:26:22] didn't stay in the cave he didn't stay
[2:26:24] in the grave but he rose again he didn't
[2:26:27] lose his kingdom he came into his
[2:26:29] kingdom again and man it was God that
[2:26:31] lifted him set him in a place where he
[2:26:33] can never be removed so as we go through
[2:26:36] this I believe you're going to continue
[2:26:37] this I believe that's the way it's going
[2:26:38] to go we'll see but but but but
[2:26:41] understand that as he was just preaching
[2:26:43] that I thought that he thought of me the
[2:26:48] same way that he thought of Christ the
[2:26:50] same way that he thought of David the
[2:26:52] same way that he thought of Samuel and
[2:26:54] of Daniel he thought of you the same way
[2:26:57] you know I was reading in Jeremiah the
[2:26:59] other morning in devotions and he said
[2:27:00] it was like a fire in my
[2:27:03] bones you ever lay a hold of something
[2:27:06] and you don't know why it's because
[2:27:08] there's something in you to produce the
[2:27:10] word that you just read it's in you to
[2:27:12] produce the message that you just heard
[2:27:14] it's in you to produce the god that
[2:27:16] revealing himself to you that's what's
[2:27:19] going on it's not just a word it's not
[2:27:21] just a Bible it's not just a message but
[2:27:24] it is the Life of Christ coming into you
[2:27:27] and it's producing itself and whether
[2:27:29] it's a hard time whether it's a good
[2:27:31] time whether it's a mountain top or
[2:27:33] whether it's a valley experience there's
[2:27:35] something in you that's coming out and
[2:27:37] it's Christ being
[2:27:38] revealed that's what is happening in
[2:27:40] these Services that's what's happening
[2:27:42] when you read the message when you hear
[2:27:43] the message when you read your your
[2:27:45] Bible is it's Christ revealing who you
[2:27:49] are in him and he's living himself
[2:27:53] through you and you say how can this
[2:27:56] be I'm just a woman I'm just a wife I'm
[2:28:00] just a mother I'm just a husband I'm
[2:28:02] just a father I'm just a mechanic I'm
[2:28:04] just a engineer I'm just a this I'm just
[2:28:06] a that but that we ought to say as Mary
[2:28:09] did be it onto me according to your word
[2:28:12] Lord if you reveal it to me then it's
[2:28:14] for me if he reveals to you then that's
[2:28:17] because it's for you it's for it's for
[2:28:19] you to live it out amen so as we listen
[2:28:22] to this weekend it's sounds so simple
[2:28:25] Brother David that wasn't a shouting and
[2:28:28] dancing type of service but if you
[2:28:30] realize what he's talking about I could
[2:28:32] preach an hour I could preach an hour on
[2:28:35] what we just heard I could preach a
[2:28:36] weekend on this but it's his Pulpit this
[2:28:39] weekend but I'm saying there's more to
[2:28:41] this you sit there and you think about
[2:28:42] what he thought of David and the
[2:28:45] revelation of Christ through David is
[2:28:46] this the same thing he's doing today in
[2:28:48] a chosen elected bride of Jesus Christ
[2:28:52] you are the word made flesh
[2:28:54] today so when you read that scripture
[2:28:56] don't say that's not for me say why not
[2:28:59] me if I can read it and he can reveal it
[2:29:02] to me then I can live it because it's
[2:29:04] not I that live but it's Christ that
[2:29:06] lives Within Me amen amen I was
[2:29:09] wonderful that was wonderful I might
[2:29:11] have been quiet but it was wonderful
[2:29:12] because I didn't know how far he was
[2:29:14] going to go but it was a beautiful
[2:29:15] sermon Brother David God bless you for
[2:29:17] that amen let's see ourselves in the
[2:29:19] book amen this is given the scripture is
[2:29:21] given for our
[2:29:23] admonition it's for us to live it's for
[2:29:25] us to produce amen this is the only
[2:29:28] other time aside from the book of Acts
[2:29:29] that we get to live a full word amen
[2:29:32] let's not hold ourselves short let's not
[2:29:33] sell ourselves short if he said it's
[2:29:35] about us it's for us to live amen amen
[2:29:38] God bless you let's let's bow our heads

[2:29:46] catch hold of it Lord Lord not for our
[2:29:48] brother or sister not for someone in
