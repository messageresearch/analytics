[9:53] and dizziness and ask for prayer for uh
[9:57] for that and uh I mentioned about apal
[10:01] Baker right I did right
[10:04] um and the the other thing was the note
[10:06] from uh brother John sent me this note
[10:08] tonight um it's it's basically
[10:13] concerning uh the not only the Believers
[10:15] in Africa that to me is the Believers
[10:18] everywhere uh but this came from Brother
[10:20] Steven Francis and uh it it had to do
[10:24] with the basically the uh the
[10:26] covid-19 virus um they were having a
[10:29] really tough time in Africa and he said
[10:32] you know ministers have been
[10:34] dying uh with with the disease and uh
[10:37] there's a couple of message ministers
[10:40] and also he said that the um just over
[10:44] the past couple of weeks been 40 doctors
[10:46] that died from this disease and uh he
[10:49] said you know basically the system over
[10:51] there just can't handle it and to me
[10:53] when I read it uh you know and well he
[10:57] he he requested uh prayer of course and
[11:01] uh did has been in touch with the
[11:04] ministers over this way as well in North
[11:06] America and in other parts of the world
[11:08] and um you know U and all of agreed to
[11:12] go to prayer and I think that's passed
[11:14] isn't it that was last probably last
[11:16] week I think do it on a weekly basis on
[11:18] a weekly basis okay so a lot of a lot of
[11:21] Believers have been asked to or all
[11:23] believers been asked to to get together
[11:24] in prayer or or to make it a uh make it
[11:27] a matter of Prayer uh at home as well or
[11:31] wherever so I just want to remember that
[11:33] but to me when I was reading it I mean
[11:34] it's a real reality check if you look at
[11:37] if you look at you know we got it pretty
[11:39] good here and that's by the grace of God
[11:42] you know but like brother Steven said
[11:44] there is a tribulation coming and
[11:45] brother random did say that you know we
[11:47] would probably see the the ushering in
[11:49] of that tribulation which I believe is I
[11:52] believe is happening I believe it's
[11:54] start so uh you know we we ought to
[11:57] thank God every day for the grace that
[11:59] he's given us to be able to do this just
[12:00] to gather together like this you know so
[12:03] uh and for me uh this is this the most
[12:07] important thing is to be able to have uh
[12:10] a time together with the Lord so let's
[12:13] just uh remember that in prayer uh
[12:16] tonight and in Into the Future that God

[47:24] total separation from unbelief amen not
[47:27] the preacher amen but the word it's
[47:30] there right in the word Genesis the

[47:53] the false teaching of the word amen you
[47:55] don't believe that amen you stay with
[47:57] the truth but believe Jesus said this he
[48:01] now he said believest thou this amen but
[48:04] the enemy is challenging us with
[48:05] doctrines of the church doctrines of man
[48:07] this this no stay with what the Lord
[48:10] said Amen brother the word is eternal he
[48:14] haven't he haven't added to it he don't
[48:16] take away from it he but he he still
[48:18] works according to his word am but he's
[48:21] given us the warning don't add to it
[48:23] don't take from it if you do he said
[48:25] your part will be taken out of the book

[48:30] surely under under that command we we
[48:32] have no desire to add to or take away
[48:34] from the word amen we want to please the
[48:37] Lord by Grace amen so the Lord oh I

[48:44] we can and uh our brother always he
[48:47] brought it up here thank you

[48:52] because the Lord willing that we'll go
[48:54] in and uh hear not all of this message
[48:58] on God's word calls for a total
[49:00] separation from unbelief and again it's
[49:03] not man it's it's God's word god through

[51:06] into what the prophet has explained
[51:09] concerning God's
[51:12] word it calls for a total separation
[51:15] from unbelief amen not a partial
[51:18] separation a total separation amen and
[51:21] God is expressing that that command and
[51:24] that desire that he wants in US he

[51:29] the word that calls for separation amen
[51:32] so the Lord
[51:33] blesses so if you would you going to
[51:35] turn to me turn with me rather to the
[51:38] Book of Romans chapter
[51:40] 8 amen and also to ask you to keep our
[51:44] brother Ellsworth and sister Ellsworth

[55:12] me free from the law of sin and death
[55:16] praise the Lord Allelujah Hallelujah for
[55:20] what the law could not do in that it was
[55:23] weak through the flesh God sent in his

[55:29] flesh and for sin condemned sin in the
[55:34] flesh
[55:35] amen that the righteousness of the law
[55:39] might be fulfilled in US Allelujah who
[55:43] walk not after the flesh but after the
[55:46] spirit praise the Lord so we're not
[55:48] judged by the flesh we're judged by the
[55:50] spirit that's in control amen we're not
[55:54] walking after the flesh and the and many
[55:57] will condemn us and say you're you're a
[55:59] sinner you do this you do that but we
[56:01] walk after the spirit amen and we have
[56:04] that anointing and that spirit with us
[56:06] in us and around us amen it is the
[56:09] spirit of Christ in US amen the hope of
[56:12] glory but and what does it do it gives
[56:14] us a faith that we're going to get a new
[56:17] body yes amen we're in that there will
[56:20] be no nothing that the enemy should be
[56:22] able to condemn us anyhow amen cuz that
[56:25] new body is a glorified body praise the
[56:28] Lord amen in this body we're dealing
[56:30] with the with the senses of the Flesh in
[56:33] this body oh yeah the devil is there and
[56:35] he he's there to tempt us this this and
[56:37] this but we keep coming back to the word
[56:39] to get the victory amen as our lord
[56:42] Jesus did praise the Lord amen and we
[56:46] got the promise and we keep reminding
[56:47] the devil amen we're going to receive a
[56:50] glorified body like onto his glorious
[56:52] body Amen brother we're longing for it
[56:56] look looking for it hungering for it
[56:57] thirsting for it amen every and hour
[57:00] that we need it is now oh my yes sir
[57:05] considering what's going on in the world
[57:06] and around the world yes just I I I
[57:09] believe it's it's a sign of the end
[57:11] again but I don't know if you did maybe
[57:13] some of us did receive the email and uh
[57:16] I think it's from some African Brethren
[57:19] and uh asking the question concerning
[57:22] covid-19 is this do does this have
[57:25] anything to do with the end does this
[57:27] anything to do with God's judgment upon
[57:29] the Earth and it is as I have said
[57:31] before I look out and I said I can look
[57:34] around I can I see the fire of God
[57:36] falling that's what that's what I feel
[57:38] oh yeah I see this and I see that I have
[57:40] this this experience and I said oh Lord
[57:43] what's going on I said this must be the
[57:45] fire of God and judgment falling so the
[57:47] grace of God be with us amen that we're
[57:51] going to be in in the spirit not in the
[57:53] flesh not governed by the flesh but
[57:55] governed by the Holy Ghost in US
[57:58] amen why because if it's in the spirit
[58:02] that the righteousness of the law might
[58:04] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[58:08] the flesh but after the spirit for they
[58:11] that are after The Flesh do mind the
[58:14] things of the flesh but they that are
[58:16] after the spirit the things of the
[58:19] spirit and that's the word amen but to
[58:23] be carnally minded and just too many too
[58:26] many Believers that are kindly minded
[58:29] they are they're more caught up with the
[58:31] world than with the word oh yeah more
[58:34] caught up with the things of the world
[58:36] than they are with the word and the
[58:37] promise of God Amen they're looking
[58:40] forward for this do this do this do this
[58:42] it's it's it's loving the world and the
[58:44] things of the world Amen but if you're
[58:46] the elect if you're the bride of Christ
[58:49] you're not concerned with the world
[58:51] you're you're concerned with the promise
[58:52] I want to get out of here Lord amen as
[58:55] God eats it you eat it
[58:59] amen so he said to be kindly minded he
[59:02] said is death but to be spiritually
[59:05] minded is life and peace amen God grant
[59:10] us that eternal life and that peace
[59:13] because the carnal mind is enmity
[59:15] against God for it is not subject to the
[59:19] law of God neither indeed can be amen so
[59:24] then they that are in the flesh
[59:26] cannot please God Amen if you're going
[59:30] to live after the flesh the desires of
[59:31] the Flesh and and your intellectual mind
[59:34] and intellectual Faith you don't please
[59:36] God oh no you he's not interested in
[59:40] that he's interested in absolute Holy
[59:42] Ghost Faith you believe the word period
[59:45] amen you're not going to reason with God
[59:48] Amen the devil want you to reason with
[59:50] the word no no you take you it is

[1:00:08] explain that no way amen we don't need
[1:00:11] it explained it needs to be believed
[1:00:13] amen if anything that God has been
[1:00:15] endeavoring to get his seed to do down
[1:00:17] Through the Ages is believe his word
[1:00:20] period amen just but so I believe God I
[1:00:24] believe it's written I believe thus say
[1:00:25] the Lord I believe that God wants us to
[1:00:27] do this is right here in the word right
[1:00:28] here the enemy is right there to reason
[1:00:31] with it amen or to add a word to it or
[1:00:33] take a word from it amen again that's
[1:00:36] why Jesus warned us in Revelation don't
[1:00:39] add to don't take from it amen praise
[1:00:42] the Lord and that's why he prayed the
[1:00:43] grace of God be with us amen why because
[1:00:47] we need that Grace to to to give us the
[1:00:49] strength and the and the and the
[1:00:51] fullness by oh yes the courage to move
[1:00:54] on stay with the word all oh yeah the
[1:00:56] enemy is there to give you fear Amen to

[1:01:04] Ghost you got no fear that's right he
[1:01:07] takes away fear amen God help
[1:01:11] us so again he said to be Carly minded
[1:01:15] is death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:01:17] life and peace praise the Lord because
[1:01:21] the carnal mind is
[1:01:23] enemity make sure you don't have a
[1:01:24] carnal mind tonight yes to receive the
[1:01:27] word amen because that's imity against
[1:01:32] God for it is not subject to the law of
[1:01:35] God neither indeed can be so then they
[1:01:38] that are in this flesh cannot please God
[1:01:42] if you're governed by your fleshly
[1:01:44] desires and feelings you cannot please
[1:01:47] God no because why because faith without
[1:01:51] faith it's impossible to please him amen
[1:01:55] because by faith you don't you don't
[1:01:56] reason you don't it's not not
[1:01:58] intellectual it's spiritual I believe
[1:02:00] you going on
[1:02:02] Amen you don't have to understand it but
[1:02:05] do you believe it not that they would
[1:02:08] understand the resurrection but he said
[1:02:10] to Martha believest thou this when he
[1:02:11] said I am the resurrection amen that's
[1:02:15] amazing that he would challenge them
[1:02:17] with that Revelation before he had he
[1:02:20] did it amen God do we believe
[1:02:23] it for every and hour that that
[1:02:26] Believers should believe it it's us amen
[1:02:29] because as the prophet said the dead in
[1:02:31] Christ is going to appear to the living
[1:02:33] Saints first and then he said the living
[1:02:35] Saints going to be step into that
[1:02:37] Dimension and going to be changed in
[1:02:39] into a glorified body and he said that's
[1:02:41] when when we're going to look up and
[1:02:44] we're we'll all look up there he is amen
[1:02:47] coming down to receive us God help us
[1:02:50] that is more real to us than what's
[1:02:52] going on in the in in the world that
[1:02:55] it's more to real to us than what's
[1:02:56] going on in Canada or England or what's
[1:02:59] going on in the United States amen cuz
[1:03:03] if there's over a time that the United
[1:03:04] States experienced Insanity it's now
[1:03:08] amen and brother the prophet warned us
[1:03:10] that the world's going to go
[1:03:12] insane amen I trust it'll not influence
[1:03:15] you that you're you're going to be
[1:03:16] brother what is our sanity it's the word
[1:03:18] of God Amen our sanity is the word it's
[1:03:23] not what we think or what we we feel
[1:03:25] about the word but it's what God has
[1:03:26] given us concerning his word what God
[1:03:29] has revealed to us concerning his word
[1:03:32] amen that's our sanity but to the world
[1:03:36] it is it is insane no no we're staying
[1:03:39] with the word they considered Isaiah or
[1:03:42] not Isaiah Noah to be
[1:03:44] insane what preaching about a
[1:03:46] flood a
[1:03:48] flood building a big Ark oh yeah and no
[1:03:52] doubt as the prophet has said no doubt
[1:03:54] there's many of them were building their
[1:03:55] own little B
[1:03:56] but that wasn't going to save them only
[1:03:59] the ark would save them amen if they
[1:04:02] believe Noah amen just think God asked
[1:04:05] him to do something that God had not
[1:04:07] done before
[1:04:09] amen did he believe it yes he believed
[1:04:12] it amen and we know that even the
[1:04:15] serpent seed came through the came came
[1:04:17] through the the flood on the ark we
[1:04:20] won't get into that but the Bible does
[1:04:22] identify one of Noah's sons that had
[1:04:25] that serpent seat spirit amen and God
[1:04:30] cast him away from from Noah that was
[1:04:32] after the flood and so on God help us
[1:04:34] brother and sister let's
[1:04:37] believe brother if anything that pleases
[1:04:39] God and God loves it is Faith yes amen

[1:05:02] the heart not saying oh I believe this I
[1:05:05] believe that well the Devil Makes that
[1:05:07] confession that he believes it because
[1:05:09] of God's word he know what God has done
[1:05:12] amen and what God is doing Do We Believe
[1:05:17] brother we need the change yes let's
[1:05:20] make sure you're dead to Satan's
[1:05:21] influence in your
[1:05:23] mind amen grace of

[1:05:57] of God dwelleth in you now if any man
[1:06:02] have not the spirit of Christ he is none

[1:06:09] in you the body is dead because of sin
[1:06:13] but the spirit is life because of
[1:06:17] righteousness and again it's the
[1:06:19] righteousness of Christ imputed to you
[1:06:23] praise the Lord
[1:06:26] and if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:06:27] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:06:30] raised up Christ from the dead shall

[1:06:36] spirit that dwelleth in you God help us
[1:06:39] to believe
[1:06:42] amen therefore brethren we are debtors
[1:06:44] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:06:47] for if ye live after the flesh ye shall
[1:06:49] die but if ye through the spirit do
[1:06:52] mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall
[1:06:57] live and it's eternal life by the grace
[1:07:00] of God Amen if ye through the spirit the
[1:07:06] Holy Spirit do mortify and to mortify is
[1:07:09] to kill the Deeds of the body we shall
[1:07:14] live amen by grace for as many as are
[1:07:18] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:07:21] sons of God Amen thank God God bless his

[1:12:48] of your servant the prophet in Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ's name amen and amen amen God
[1:12:55] bless you may be seated and again this
[1:12:57] was January 21st
[1:13:01] 1964 and the title is God's word God's
[1:13:05] word calls for a total separation amen
[1:13:09] it it's not just the me not just the
[1:13:11] preacher not just another brother or
[1:13:12] sister but it's God in his word amen God
[1:13:16] bless
[1:13:21] you is it right for us to obey man or
[1:13:24] God when they questioned them about the
[1:13:27] experience of Pentecost now the first
[1:13:30] man separated himself the first Adam
[1:13:35] from the word to go with his wife that
[1:13:39] question whether God kept his word or
[1:13:41] not what a perfect type of the lukewarm
[1:13:45] carnal minded believer today that's
[1:13:49] still wants to cling with what the
[1:13:50] tradition says instead of taking what
[1:13:53] the word says that's it
[1:13:55] a very real type he was separated to his
[1:14:01] wife the carnal believer is separated
[1:14:04] from the word to the church amen but
[1:14:07] when the second Adam was created in the
[1:14:10] womb of a woman and came to the world he
[1:14:14] was a Nazarite to the word of God he was
[1:14:18] separated from the world to the world
[1:14:21] Amen now Hebrews the 7th chapter 26th
[1:14:24] verse tells us that
[1:14:25] that them priest continually died but
[1:14:28] this Jesus is Holy and separated from
[1:14:32] Sinners sin is unbelief there was no
[1:14:35] unbelief found in nowhere when he was
[1:14:38] here on Earth he said who can condemn me
[1:14:40] of sin amen sin is unbelief if I haven't
[1:14:44] done just what was prophesied for this
[1:14:46] age if I haven't met the requirements of
[1:14:49] what Messiah is supposed to do then
[1:14:51] don't believe me said search the
[1:14:54] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:14:56] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:15:00] testify of me tell you who he is because
[1:15:05] it had been prophesied since Eden that
[1:15:08] there would come a savior yes the
[1:15:10] prophet said he'd be born of a virgin
[1:15:13] and how that he'd be called
[1:15:15] Emmanuel and also he was a counselor the
[1:15:17] Prince of Peace Mighty God and that's
[1:15:20] what they accused him of making himself
[1:15:22] God he was God Amen he was the Prince of
[1:15:26] Peace the Mighty God and the Everlasting
[1:15:29] father there's no other father but him
[1:15:32] spiritually speaking he's the only
[1:15:34] father the father of us all and we find
[1:15:37] all believers he's the father of all who
[1:15:40] will believe his word for he was
[1:15:42] completely separated from the church
[1:15:45] from his Traditions from his mother from
[1:15:48] the world and only did that which
[1:15:51] pleased the
[1:15:52] father now he was a different person
[1:15:55] from Adam no matter what anybody
[1:15:58] questioned to him the word it was the
[1:16:00] word always first and he proved that the
[1:16:03] word was right when Satan tried to
[1:16:06] whitewash it for him and said it's
[1:16:08] written he said yes and it's also
[1:16:09] written amen he withstood Satan upon the
[1:16:13] word because that's what he was the word
[1:16:17] the Bible First John St John the first
[1:16:19] chapter said in the beginning was the
[1:16:21] word and the Word was with God and and
[1:16:25] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:16:28] flesh and dwelt Among Us he's the same
[1:16:30] yesterday today and forever it's always
[1:16:32] a connection with the spoken word of God
[1:16:37] God's promise for the day and when it
[1:16:40] comes it's so unusual the people can
[1:16:43] hardly grasp it because we're so SED
[1:16:47] into to farms and ideas of our own yes
[1:16:51] that it's hard for us to grasp what's
[1:16:53] truth amen I think much of that would
[1:16:56] apply to to Joseph in the days of of the
[1:17:01] the Mary in her maternity she she was to
[1:17:05] be mother and Joseph loved her and he he
[1:17:09] wanted to believe he was a righteous man
[1:17:13] a good man and he wanted to believe that
[1:17:16] story that Mary was telling him but
[1:17:18] still there was a question that now
[1:17:22] she's a good woman no doubt Mary Had
[1:17:24] explained to him the visit of Gabriel to
[1:17:27] her and he was a just man in the lineage
[1:17:31] of
[1:17:32] David and yet her it looked like that
[1:17:36] she was trying to use him for a
[1:17:39] shield to take off her reproach because
[1:17:43] if she was engaged to him and to be
[1:17:46] found in this condition was the same as
[1:17:48] adultery Deuteronomy tells us so and
[1:17:50] would be stoned for the ACT and it
[1:17:53] looked like that she was using him for a
[1:17:56] shield and the man a good man a just man
[1:18:00] the Bible said he was a just man but her
[1:18:04] case was so
[1:18:06] unusual that he could not grasp it he'
[1:18:11] look in her lovely face and the
[1:18:13] sincerity and honesty that she would
[1:18:15] tell her story in and no doubt but he'd
[1:18:18] go to his home or his Cartner shop say I
[1:18:22] I just can't see how she would tell me
[1:18:23] wrong but the case is so
[1:18:27] unusual if he would have only searched
[1:18:30] the scriptures that a virgin is to
[1:18:32] conceive amen see it was so unusual to
[1:18:37] him because it was out of the line of
[1:18:38] his thinking but she is exactly in the
[1:18:41] scripture and so is it today Brethren
[1:18:45] that the power of the resurrection of
[1:18:48] Jesus Christ and his promised word of
[1:18:50] this hour is so unusual good man St over
[1:18:55] it it's too
[1:18:57] unusual they say that the dead was
[1:19:00] raised up the blind see the death here
[1:19:04] the Holy Spirit discerns the thoughts
[1:19:06] foretells things that's coming to pass
[1:19:09] never fail at one time or they they
[1:19:12] can't can't grasp it it's so unusual so
[1:19:15] they they uh say well it's a telepathy
[1:19:18] or it's a evil spirit just like they did
[1:19:20] in that day the unusualness of the word
[1:19:23] of God but when when a man is born in
[1:19:26] the world for a a Believer he becomes a
[1:19:30] Nazarite when he separates himself from
[1:19:33] anything that's contrary to the word
[1:19:36] amen a total
[1:19:38] separation Jesus said I come to separate
[1:19:40] a man from his
[1:19:42] wife tear up a family and he that won't
[1:19:47] uh take up his cross and follow me is
[1:19:50] not worthy to be called mine a
[1:19:53] separation from everything
[1:19:55] anything from church from from a
[1:19:58] community from a belief or from family
[1:20:02] or anything that would stand between you
[1:20:05] and believing the entire word of God if
[1:20:09] your soul will not punctuate every
[1:20:12] promise for this hour with an amen
[1:20:15] there's something wrong somewhere you
[1:20:17] need a
[1:20:18] separation so Jesus was the word made
[1:20:23] flesh and he was completely separated
[1:20:26] from Sinners unbelievers that the word
[1:20:28] itself flowed completely and and
[1:20:32] thoroughly flew through him that he said
[1:20:34] I do nothing until I see the father do
[1:20:37] it first they asked him question him
[1:20:39] about things he said verily I say unto
[1:20:42] you the son can do nothing in himself
[1:20:44] but what he sees the father doing watch
[1:20:47] everything that he said was perfect amen
[1:20:52] just he had not to asked about it think
[1:20:54] about it it was perfect and his perfect
[1:20:58] truth always separated the truth from
[1:21:02] ARA even as I quote back again again his
[1:21:05] mother said thy father and I before
[1:21:07] those priests that should already
[1:21:09] testify it was a virgent
[1:21:11] barnon but in the moments of her grief
[1:21:14] How could a 12-year-old boy we have no
[1:21:16] record of him even being in school how
[1:21:19] could his intelligence be so great as to
[1:21:20] debate with the priest Sage learned man
[1:21:24] and why when she called that this Joseph
[1:21:28] was his father quickly the word of God
[1:21:31] he was
[1:21:32] separated he was the word and the word
[1:21:36] corrected the error know ye not that I
[1:21:39] must be about my father's Goods that was
[1:21:41] not just that little 12y old boy that
[1:21:44] was the word of God speaking through his
[1:21:47] little childish mouth to correct error
[1:21:52] separating like he did in the beginning
[1:21:54] Darkness from Life aive from the
[1:21:58] truth death from
[1:22:01] life it's a separation always the word
[1:22:05] requires total and complete separation
[1:22:08] amen regardless Jesus said let every
[1:22:10] man's word be a lie let mine be true
[1:22:13] right all down Through the Ages the same
[1:22:16] thing has happened it's a separating
[1:22:19] always he separates his people from the
[1:22:21] unbelief he did it at the beginning he
[1:22:24] does it same today each one of the
[1:22:25] prophets was separated from unbelief the
[1:22:29] reason they did that is because the word
[1:22:33] of the Lord came to
[1:22:35] them now believe a night somewhere
[1:22:38] perhaps this here Sunday or last night
[1:22:41] that I was speaking what the word sear
[1:22:44] in the Old Testament meant it meant a
[1:22:46] man a
[1:22:48] diviner a man that would tell the future
[1:22:51] events that were coming to pass and then
[1:22:54] when they come to pass exactly without
[1:22:57] failure come to pass exactly what he
[1:23:00] said then God said listen to this man or
[1:23:03] hearing fear Him for I'm with him then
[1:23:06] he had the Divine interpretation of the
[1:23:12] written word for that was his
[1:23:14] credentials of identification that he
[1:23:17] was God's prophet and the word come to
[1:23:19] him amen right now separation it's separ
[1:23:24] at Isaiah from the church World it
[1:23:28] separated Moses from the church World it
[1:23:32] separated the uh all the the great
[1:23:35] prophets to the ages from the church
[1:23:37] world because they had it separated
[1:23:40] Jesus from his Brethren it separated the
[1:23:43] apostles from the church it was at that
[1:23:46] day the Pharisees Sadducees great man
[1:23:49] holy man good man fine man humble man
[1:23:54] man that had fruit of the spirit more so
[1:23:57] than what Jesus exercised but what was
[1:23:59] his credentials that the word was with
[1:24:03] him the word promised of that day was
[1:24:06] living through him he said which one of
[1:24:07] you can condemn me of sin which one of
[1:24:10] you can say that what I have claimed
[1:24:11] hasn't happened that for he showed that
[1:24:14] he was a separated Nazarite of the Lord
[1:24:18] he was the Lord himself in flesh Abraham
[1:24:22] also he was a separated person from the
[1:24:27] world Amen when God called Abraham at 75
[1:24:30] years old separate yourself from your
[1:24:34] Kindred and from all you the unbelief
[1:24:37] and come out into a world that you've
[1:24:39] never walked in before and amongst a
[1:24:41] people that you've never known before
[1:24:43] come out and separate yourself from
[1:24:46] anybody that would be contrary to what
[1:24:48] you're believing that You' be a Nazarite
[1:24:51] unto the Lord because he was holding a
[1:24:53] promise of a son amen he had to separate
[1:24:57] from his father from his mother from his
[1:25:00] Kindred and what separated him not
[1:25:03] because he was a good man but because he
[1:25:06] believed that God was able to keep the
[1:25:10] promise he had
[1:25:11] given and when he was 25 years later and
[1:25:15] the baby had never come Sarah being 90
[1:25:18] he 100 and when the angel of the Lord
[1:25:20] visit him at Jesus referred to that
[1:25:22] would come again in the last days
[1:25:25] God in a human form sat down before him
[1:25:28] and Tau and Sarah being almost 100 years
[1:25:31] old in the tent behind him laughed
[1:25:35] because the angel said I will visit you
[1:25:38] according to the time of the promise and
[1:25:40] she said me being old and would have
[1:25:42] pleasure again with my Lord seeing he's
[1:25:44] old and this
[1:25:47] man which was God in flesh said why did
[1:25:53] Sarah laugh in the
[1:25:56] tent now she run out and tried to deny
[1:26:00] but he said yes but you did laugh
[1:26:03] because it she didn't believe it could
[1:26:05] be right now notice Jesus said that
[1:26:10] would come again amen as it was in the
[1:26:13] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:26:16] coming of the son of man amen again the
[1:26:20] spirit of God will come upon martal
[1:26:23] human flesh
[1:26:25] that man eat the meat of a calf drinking
[1:26:29] the milk from the cow eat butter and
[1:26:32] bread in human flesh and Abraham said he
[1:26:36] was
[1:26:38] Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus
[1:26:43] promised that God before his coming
[1:26:46] would be manifested in human flesh again
[1:26:50] that's the Holy Spirit he's only one God
[1:26:54] manifesting itself separating again lot
[1:26:58] from
[1:27:00] Abraham lot wanted the world God SE tore
[1:27:04] up his world and separated Abraham and
[1:27:07] lot lot being a type again of a carnal
[1:27:10] believer who didn't think these things
[1:27:12] were true he just went on down in Sodom
[1:27:14] and he didn't have the real spunk to
[1:27:16] stand out as we' call it and call what
[1:27:19] was right right and wrong wrong so he
[1:27:21] went down all these believers says we
[1:27:24] could go on for hours all these were
[1:27:27] like a bunch of change out of your
[1:27:30] pocket in God's
[1:27:32] hands you pull out a bunch of change
[1:27:35] there's pennies nickels dimes quarters
[1:27:40] half a dollars dollar all in coins now
[1:27:44] that's what the world is in God's hand
[1:27:48] there's some people that's just can have
[1:27:51] a Penny's worth of it yes and God can
[1:27:54] only use them in a penny way amen that's
[1:27:56] all they can buy don't reject them if
[1:28:00] they can't believe the real truth don't
[1:28:02] turn them down don't kick them out and
[1:28:05] say they're not in it because God uses
[1:28:07] pennies sometimes amen lot was just a
[1:28:10] penny Abraham was a silver dollar so it
[1:28:14] taken a hundred lots to make an Abraham
[1:28:17] so it take a hundred carnal Believers
[1:28:20] will never stand in the presence of a
[1:28:22] genuine Christian that separate at it
[1:28:24] from the carnal things of the world
[1:28:26] living in Christ Jesus where the word
[1:28:28] can blow through
[1:28:29] him he can only take a Penny's worth
[1:28:32] that's all he's got so you see people
[1:28:35] say I don't believe in healing I don't
[1:28:36] believe in these things just know it's a
[1:28:38] penny but just let him
[1:28:39] alone just a Penny's worth and so that's
[1:28:42] all he can buy don't stop him just let
[1:28:44] him alone remember that's just all
[1:28:46] farther he can go amen
[1:28:49] Joseph he was separated from his
[1:28:52] brethren
[1:28:54] yeah I didn't mean that hard in that way
[1:28:56] that I said it see I mean if he just
[1:28:58] well I belong to this and that's what we
[1:29:00] believe it's just a penny go ahead see
[1:29:02] just aend he say well the Lord bless you
[1:29:04] my brother see he's copper he can never
[1:29:06] be silver so just let it go ahead God
[1:29:09] can use him oh he's using it I'd rather
[1:29:11] see him down there in a church and see a
[1:29:12] barroom stand there on the corner would
[1:29:14] you sure so just let it alone God can
[1:29:16] use it anyhow maybe not very much but
[1:29:18] he'll use what he can use as much as
[1:29:20] he'll let him use that's right so that's
[1:29:22] kind of a rude way to express it
[1:29:24] anything but I well I hope you get the
[1:29:27] truth that I mean what what is meant see
[1:29:30] he can't believe in discernment and the
[1:29:31] powers of God is Promised for this days
[1:29:33] those Pharisees couldn't do it either
[1:29:35] they couldn't see Jesus being God oh no
[1:29:38] you make yourself God a man one day he
[1:29:40] was standing there at you multiplied
[1:29:41] loaves of bread and so forth for them
[1:29:44] and he said um unless you eat the the
[1:29:47] bread uh the son of man's body and drink
[1:29:49] his blood uh there's no life in you oh
[1:29:53] imagine this coner conation they walked
[1:29:54] away from him this man expects us to be
[1:29:57] a cannibal eat somebody's flesh oh
[1:29:59] that's crazy Doctors medical doctors and
[1:30:02] so forth said the man's insane that's
[1:30:04] all there is the priest is right that
[1:30:06] man is crazy give us his body to eat
[1:30:08] that's all he said see but the spiritual
[1:30:10] mind maybe they could not understand it
[1:30:13] those disciples they didn't know just
[1:30:15] exactly what it meant but they believed
[1:30:17] it anyhow because where did it come from
[1:30:20] it come from the one they know to be the
[1:30:22] Son of God I'm not be able to understand
[1:30:25] all in year but I believe it it's God's
[1:30:29] word I want to separate myself from
[1:30:31] anything it's contrary to it Tri to
[1:30:34] stand like that notice another group the
[1:30:37] 70 he' called one day he standing
[1:30:40] talking to them and he said the son of
[1:30:42] man shall Ascend up into heaven from
[1:30:45] whence he come from they said this man
[1:30:48] he's taking us to the place he was born
[1:30:50] we know his mother Mary while we know
[1:30:52] his brothers we know all and then this
[1:30:54] man's going to take a the son of man is
[1:30:57] coming going up into heaven from when he
[1:31:00] come from he come from Bethlehem how did
[1:31:02] he do that see he said it in that way
[1:31:05] see and they walked with him no more
[1:31:07] they walked away they said ah this man
[1:31:10] we know there's something wrong with him
[1:31:11] them disciples sat right there see they
[1:31:15] believed they had seen the promised word
[1:31:18] for that day Vindicated and manifested
[1:31:21] by who could create but God God himself
[1:31:24] could take bread and they know he was a
[1:31:27] Son of God whether it was in riddles or
[1:31:29] not that whether they understood it or
[1:31:31] not they walked right on anyhow because
[1:31:33] a word was Vindicated and they were
[1:31:35] separated from anything contrary to it
[1:31:38] God help us to have faith like that we
[1:31:41] believe this Bible to be the truth I may
[1:31:43] not have faith enough to make all the
[1:31:45] promises come to pass but I believe it
[1:31:47] anyhow amen I believe the hour that
[1:31:50] we're living Joseph separated from his
[1:31:53] brethren Without a Cause now what was
[1:31:57] the matter with him he was not willing
[1:31:58] to be separated it wasn't his will to
[1:32:01] separate but they separated themselves
[1:32:03] from him see from his bright shiny
[1:32:07] dollar their pennies worth couldn't
[1:32:09] stand it they know they were Patriarchs
[1:32:12] they know that Isaac was their U pardon
[1:32:14] me Jacob was their father and they know
[1:32:17] that to be true but Joseph was born he
[1:32:20] couldn't help
[1:32:21] it he was spiritual
[1:32:24] he saw Visions could interpret dreams
[1:32:27] and they were perfectly right whatever
[1:32:29] he said was the
[1:32:30] truth and his patriarch Brothers moved
[1:32:34] with envy and sold him to the
[1:32:37] Egyptians see they they separated
[1:32:40] themselves from him because they were
[1:32:43] pennies he was of a different
[1:32:46] quality so is a real believer today he's
[1:32:49] of a different
[1:32:52] quality they'll separate
[1:32:54] themselves they don't understand it
[1:32:57] Copper from
[1:32:59] Silver now we find out they move with
[1:33:02] Envy insulting why they do the same
[1:33:06] thing today amen what it really was they
[1:33:09] said they were it was for
[1:33:12] jealousy they didn't want to break down
[1:33:15] because if the quality in them were not
[1:33:18] the quality was in him and because of it
[1:33:22] they were jealous because they were
[1:33:23] pennies and he was a dollar see now if
[1:33:27] the penny say blessed be the name of the
[1:33:29] Lord my brother dollar here see I can't
[1:33:32] make the change that he does but I'll
[1:33:33] make what I can that's that we go along
[1:33:36] man God to get his program over as I
[1:33:40] preached to you Sunday the great
[1:33:41] Symphony of God's word being beat
[1:33:44] out the changes and Junctions is only
[1:33:48] God Changing Times like the the director
[1:33:51] in the symphony when we see these Chang
[1:33:53] es of Ages and changes of times look
[1:33:56] down on the sheet here and you'll find
[1:33:57] out we're supposed to be here they've
[1:34:00] got to do this there's no way for him to
[1:34:02] keep from it amen and the music to a man
[1:34:05] that doesn't understand the sympathy
[1:34:07] what is it it's a bunch of rattling no
[1:34:10] he doesn't understand it he's not even
[1:34:12] interested he's wishing I wish it shut
[1:34:14] up so I could go home he's not
[1:34:17] interested cuz he doesn't know the
[1:34:19] sympathy he doesn't know it but the
[1:34:22] composure knows the end from from the
[1:34:24] beginning see and if the director isn't
[1:34:28] In The Same Spirit of the composure he
[1:34:30] cannot act it out because it's all done
[1:34:32] by signs and if a sign don't vindicate
[1:34:35] it how's the musicians going to play
[1:34:38] it
[1:34:40] amen that's it if the trumpet gives an
[1:34:42] uncertain sound who can can who know how
[1:34:45] to prepare for war or Retreat or what
[1:34:47] doing look at the word and see where
[1:34:49] we're
[1:34:51] living then you can see Penny it's what
[1:34:53] they do
[1:34:54] but you can see those who are glistening
[1:34:56] watching and knows the word watching for
[1:34:58] these signs to happen there it is like
[1:35:01] the little woman at the well when he
[1:35:02] said go get your husband she said I have
[1:35:05] none said that's right you got five she
[1:35:07] said sir I perceive that you are a
[1:35:10] prophet we haven't had him for hundreds
[1:35:12] of years but we know the messiah's
[1:35:14] coming and he's going to be a prophet
[1:35:16] that's what he'll do he said I'm he all
[1:35:20] the sympathy beat went just exactly
[1:35:22] right from the Lord fromp to the high
[1:35:25] she ran into the City and said come see
[1:35:28] a man who's told me the things that I've
[1:35:30] done isn't this the very Messiah that we
[1:35:32] look forward to certainly see she
[1:35:35] understood what the Sheep music was in
[1:35:38] the sympathy that separates belief from
[1:35:41] unbelief faith can only not come by a
[1:35:43] church Faith comes by hearing the word
[1:35:45] of God knowing what it is now we find
[1:35:48] the same thing today many people look at
[1:35:51] gifts and closing now five more minutes
[1:35:54] people look at gifts and they think oh
[1:35:57] what a great
[1:35:59] thing and they try to impersonate gifts
[1:36:02] you can't do that that's right you just
[1:36:05] you can't make a a a penny be a dollar
[1:36:08] you can't make it be a
[1:36:10] dime see you can't make it be a nickel
[1:36:12] it's Penny amen but if you just
[1:36:14] recognize yourself as a
[1:36:17] penny go with the rest to change see God
[1:36:20] can use you we might not be able to do
[1:36:23] all there wasn't everybody when God
[1:36:25] called Israel out of Egypt every one of
[1:36:27] them didn't have to do the same thing
[1:36:28] Moses did but they believed
[1:36:31] it right they believe Moses because they
[1:36:35] know that it was a sign of the hour and
[1:36:37] had God had proved that he had his word
[1:36:40] amen they said Pharaoh's got Spears he
[1:36:43] said but Moses has his word hallelujah
[1:36:45] that's it Pharaoh's might have an army
[1:36:48] but Moses had the word because he was
[1:36:51] God's prophet and the word come to him
[1:36:53] and been Vindicated that it was the
[1:36:54] truth it was a living God who could take
[1:36:56] dust and throw it up and make fleas come
[1:36:59] man can't do that as a man that stood
[1:37:02] there and said tomorrow about this time
[1:37:04] it be such and such and it was see they
[1:37:08] know Moses had God's word no matter how
[1:37:11] many Spears and dungeons Pharaoh had and
[1:37:13] how many bricks to make Moses had the
[1:37:16] word so they started Into the Wilderness
[1:37:19] there was a man day and said Moses takes
[1:37:21] too much upon himself we're all holy
[1:37:23] people people so we all are to be able
[1:37:25] to do what Moses did and Moses said God
[1:37:27] what about this he said separate
[1:37:29] yourself get away from him and he opened
[1:37:33] up the Earth and swallowed up Dayan in
[1:37:35] his group he separated light from
[1:37:38] Darkness amen by vindicating his word
[1:37:41] he's the same God today Jesus closing I
[1:37:45] was telling you last
[1:37:47] night when I first come to here this is
[1:37:50] not personal if you think that then

[1:38:01] age and you're all witnesses that is
[1:38:02] your witness last night from the
[1:38:04] discernment on down and how to be
[1:38:05] imperson impersonating and everything

[1:38:10] a great thing would take place yes we've
[1:38:12] been watching for it for years we all
[1:38:14] know when it happened first when a
[1:38:17] creation come into existence the third
[1:38:21] time and then the fourth time last night

[1:38:40] standard against them there's man

[1:39:48] just like it only that was this is quake

[1:39:52] up there it was Birch and I walk out

[1:40:07] gospel and it's been awful dry in
[1:40:10] Colorado this year as it has been across

[1:40:14] suppose there was 200 men ahead of us or
[1:40:17] 100 man pardon me about 100 man ahead of
[1:40:19] us up above the camps and they've been
[1:40:21] shooting up there for four or five days
[1:40:23] and
[1:40:23] I'd shout a de wanted i' been hunting
[1:40:26] for years and I but I come a fog down
[1:40:30] and I didn't get to see him I couldn't
[1:40:32] find him and I'd been hunting for him
[1:40:34] that day and the next day the phone or
[1:40:37] the coming on the radio a blizzard
[1:40:39] coming could dump 20 foot of snow in
[1:40:41] these mountains overnight and so I said

[1:42:10] come in are you here brother Evans and
[1:42:12] um I don't think he's gotten here'll be

[1:42:17] his wife and I said I couldn't get my
[1:42:19] wife she's gone out to the store and I
[1:42:21] said tell her to tell brother ton stry
[1:42:23] which was the president of the chapter

[1:42:27] speaker ready because I may not be able
[1:42:29] to get out of here at all I'm with these
[1:42:31] men then what taking place the that
[1:42:34] night it didn't snow the next morning
[1:42:37] the clouds was real low and angry I said
[1:42:39] now Brethren I've HED cattle in here for
[1:42:41] years and guided the first little drop
[1:42:44] of rain take back for the camp as quick
[1:42:46] as you can call within 15 minutes I see
[1:42:48] the time you couldn't see your hand
[1:42:49] before you for two or three days at a
[1:42:51] time twisting blizzard that's 9,000 F
[1:42:53] feet right there and I said you you'll
[1:42:55] just be in a blizzard and you'll be lost
[1:42:57] and you'll die here in the mountains now
[1:42:58] we'll go out I placed each man now went
[1:43:01] up over the top I said now if I don't if
[1:43:04] don't wait for me to come in hurry just
[1:43:06] as quick as it starts the first little
[1:43:08] speck of rain Rush quickly to the campus
[1:43:10] because you won't be able to find your
[1:43:11] way back they said they would do it I
[1:43:14] climbed High coyotes hollering
[1:43:15] everywhere I knew the weather was going
[1:43:17] to change then all at once a big blast
[1:43:20] of wind come and the Sleep begin to fall
[1:43:22] and I said but I guess everybody's
[1:43:23] headed back well I stood and looked
[1:43:25] around I thought I wish I could find
[1:43:26] that deer before I go back because snow
[1:43:30] will cover him up they won't be found
[1:43:31] Immortal spring so I thought I HED so
[1:43:34] hard for that deer and the first deer I
[1:43:35] ever let get by like that since I've own
[1:43:38] this little rifle of 55 head a game with
[1:43:40] it and I thought well I I I just hate to
[1:43:42] see it get away like that and just a
[1:43:44] moment great big snow drops look like
[1:43:47] quarters just the falling everywhere and
[1:43:49] the wind started blowing and I could
[1:43:51] hardly see how to get off the top of
[1:43:52] this peak and I know to stay on this
[1:43:54] Ridge and if I went down and hit the
[1:43:55] creek I'd go down the creek to I hit a
[1:43:57] little foot bridge then I could feel my
[1:43:59] way up till I got to where the tent was
[1:44:01] that's the only way you can get out and
[1:44:02] so I thought if I ever make a move one
[1:44:04] way or the other that's all you'll never
[1:44:07] be found so you die right in there so I
[1:44:10] started back down the mountain and I got
[1:44:12] down about oh I guess 300 yards or 400
[1:44:15] from where I was now this sounds strange
[1:44:18] but I got a Bible in here before me a
[1:44:21] Heavenly Father bearing me a record
[1:44:24] amen uh almost in a run trying to get
[1:44:27] off the wind is blowing so hard up there
[1:44:29] and U I could see about 20 ft in front
[1:44:31] of me in the thickets I was in the
[1:44:34] timber and the wind blowing and twisting
[1:44:36] and the boy said stop go back where you
[1:44:39] come from I stopped I thought maybe
[1:44:43] that's just the sound of that wind I
[1:44:44] wasn't thinking about nothing like that
[1:44:46] I waited just a moment and one of the
[1:44:48] boys had fixed me a sandwich and I
[1:44:50] pulled it out and it was really a
[1:44:51] sandwich me raining sweetness it's a big
[1:44:54] lump of of bread with some meat in
[1:44:56] somewhere but I I was kind of hungry so
[1:44:58] I eat it anyhow and I stand there and I
[1:45:00] Beed the little piece of paper so
[1:45:02] animals see those things and anything in
[1:45:04] Civilization they run get away so uh
[1:45:08] stood there a little bit and I thought
[1:45:09] well I'll go on I started on and just as
[1:45:11] plain as you hear my voice something
[1:45:13] said turn and go back where you come
[1:45:17] from how could that be God telling me to
[1:45:19] walk into that death
[1:45:21] trap I stood there a minute and I
[1:45:23] thought that's the same one that said
[1:45:25] about them squirrels the same one I told
[1:45:27] you about last night about my wife just
[1:45:30] the voice just the human boys the same
[1:45:32] one told me when I was a little boy I
[1:45:33] never drink or smoke and these things
[1:45:35] would be in the last days God and me
[1:45:38] telling us the Bible over my heart what
[1:45:40] good would do me to tell you something
[1:45:41] wrong and know that I'm sending my soul
[1:45:43] to
[1:45:46] hell it's true it's unusual but it's
[1:45:51] true well I thought I know enough to
[1:45:54] obey that voice why would I he's got
[1:45:56] some reason for me to go up there maybe
[1:45:58] it's my time to go so I turned and
[1:46:01] making my way through the Wilderness
[1:46:02] until I got up to that saddle again way
[1:46:05] up maybe uh 300 yard 400 above right
[1:46:08] straight up the mountain like that again
[1:46:10] it was so thick up there then I couldn't
[1:46:11] see nothing the wind trees just laying
[1:46:13] over and twisting and I took my rifle I
[1:46:15] had on a red shirt in a red cap and I
[1:46:18] put the rifle keeping smoking up the the
[1:46:20] scope in it because bear and stuff
[1:46:22] moving them kind of time so does line
[1:46:24] and I I run into one the scope all
[1:46:26] smoked up and I just held it up like
[1:46:28] this uh not against me smoke but keep
[1:46:31] the fog out of it and the wet from the
[1:46:33] snow and I sat down under a tree I sat
[1:46:37] there I thought well why would he want
[1:46:38] me to come up here I I doubt very much I
[1:46:41] can find my way down now the getting so
[1:46:43] terrific I can see about 10 or 15 ft
[1:46:45] maybe hardly that far sometimes not over
[1:46:48] 5T and getting rougher all the time well
[1:46:51] um
[1:46:52] oh well he said come back all I know do
[1:46:54] sit here and the snow then about an inch
[1:46:56] or inch and a half maybe 2 Ines on the
[1:46:58] ground it' been about 20 30 minutes and
[1:47:01] and it's blowing so hard is blowing it
[1:47:03] away too and I sat there just a
[1:47:06] moment I Heard a Voice he said I'm the
[1:47:11] god of Heaven who created the heavens
[1:47:13] and
[1:47:14] earth I jerked off my hand
[1:47:18] C and I just sit still now listen again
[1:47:21] I thought that wasn't the wind oh
[1:47:23] blowing making noise I heard it again
[1:47:25] that I'm the one who steal the winds
[1:47:28] upon the Mighty Sea I'm the one the
[1:47:32] Creator I created squirrels in your
[1:47:35] presence I did these
[1:47:37] things I said yes Lord I believe you
[1:47:41] said stand on your feet I stood up to my
[1:47:44] feet he said I speak to the storm it'll
[1:47:47] do what you tell it to
[1:47:49] do now that is true
[1:47:53] I when I meet you at the Judgment I'll
[1:47:56] have all this to answer for
[1:47:58] amen I thought he I said
[1:48:02] St go to your place stop the sun you
[1:48:06] shine normally for 4
[1:48:09] days and no more than I said that the
[1:48:12] sleep and hail which is about to blow me
[1:48:14] down just stopped and within a moment or
[1:48:17] two the Sun was shining right down
[1:48:19] through upon me and I looked down across
[1:48:22] the mountains I see a a East Wind come
[1:48:24] the wind was coming from the West East
[1:48:27] Wind come and was coming this way I see
[1:48:29] the clouds this mysteriously where they
[1:48:30] went I don't know and I stood there a
[1:48:33] few moments tears running down through
[1:48:35] my beard them
[1:48:37] gray oh God H I don't know what to do I
[1:48:43] thought well I was I guess the brother
[1:48:45] all back in the tent and sun shining
[1:48:47] everywhere I started walking down the
[1:48:50] mountain snow all drying up that hot sun
[1:48:53] steam coming out of my shirt just a
[1:48:55] moment or two
[1:48:56] difference and I started walking down
[1:48:59] the
[1:49:00] mountain when I
[1:49:02] did I said Heard a Voice say why don't
[1:49:05] you walk with me amen I said Lord the
[1:49:08] greatest privilege I ever had I turned
[1:49:10] and started back down through the big
[1:49:12] deer Trails down through that virgent
[1:49:14] Forest I thought well I'll walk on down
[1:49:16] that way to where I always pay my salute
[1:49:18] to me my wife I was going along there
[1:49:21] some about half half hour 3/4 later snow
[1:49:24] was all dried up and gone I begin to
[1:49:27] think I wonder why she has never said
[1:49:30] anything to me about going I said I
[1:49:32] remember when I first H her up there and
[1:49:33] lift her over them logs when we were
[1:49:35] married I said no she's great I went uh
[1:49:39] Gray beard over my face black and gray
[1:49:41] mixed together I thought bill you ain't
[1:49:44] got much
[1:49:45] longer you're getting old and I started
[1:49:48] moving along and I looked up looked like
[1:49:52] I could see standing before me they at
[1:49:53] their arms out still
[1:49:56] blackheaded I help my head down I swor
[1:49:58] up a little place where some quaking ass
[1:50:00] and there's a little Crook and I lean my
[1:50:02] head against the lamb like this I stand
[1:50:05] there
[1:50:07] crying now I could hear something going
[1:50:09] Pat Pat Pat and I looked down it was a
[1:50:12] water coming from my eyes through my
[1:50:14] beard hitting on them dry leaves or
[1:50:17] about 30 minutes before there was an
[1:50:18] inch of snow and it blizzarding when I
[1:50:21] come down off the mountain 4 days later
[1:50:23] not one cloud in the sky for 4 days
[1:50:25] later I come in I said to The Filling
[1:50:27] Station man did u b pretty dry yes said
[1:50:31] you know the strangest thing was
[1:50:33] predicted a storm the other day and you
[1:50:34] know it stopped all at once and then I
[1:50:37] come on down to New Mexico line coming
[1:50:39] back to Arizona and I said to Billy my
[1:50:41] son I said let's go in here and just see
[1:50:43] if it's down this way I stopped in there
[1:50:45] on a Sunday morning got some uh and got
[1:50:48] some gasoline and the man said well I've
[1:50:50] been hunting I said yes sir any luck I
[1:50:52] said yes sir we had a fine time I said
[1:50:55] looks pretty dry he said yes it's been
[1:50:57] awful dry through here he said we was
[1:50:59] promised a big snow the other day and
[1:51:00] said you know the blizzard actually
[1:51:02] started and somehow another it quit oh
[1:51:06] my my heart I was standing out side of
[1:51:08] this tree and Clos God standing inside
[1:51:11] this tree the tears dropping from my eye
[1:51:14] I thought God just think the same God
[1:51:17] that said peace be still to the waves
[1:51:19] yes Lord and the winds obey he still the
[1:51:22] same Jesus Is Right In The W with us
[1:51:25] he's still the word the word all Nature
[1:51:29] has to obey his word for he's a creator
[1:51:32] of nature I stood there and the tears
[1:51:35] dropping off of my
[1:51:36] cheeks and for about 5 years now I've
[1:51:40] been off the field just going to
[1:51:41] churches and whatever I could you all
[1:51:44] know that and my heart's been burdened
[1:51:46] I'd go out here come to Arizona he would
[1:51:48] tell me things do it i' go do it but
[1:51:50] look like the Revival's over and I
[1:51:53] couldn't wonder what was taking place in
[1:51:55] my heart I'd repent I say Lord if I've
[1:51:57] done anything tell me I'll make it right
[1:51:58] it's burdened all time just a horrible
[1:52:01] feeling I couldn't have the victory that
[1:52:03] I wanted many great things he had done
[1:52:05] and showed what you all are witnesses
[1:52:07] coming here and telling you about it
[1:52:08] seen the papers packet and magazines and
[1:52:10] so forth about the great Supernatural
[1:52:13] things that's been seen and
[1:52:14] done but my heart was still heavy I was
[1:52:18] leaning against the bush just like this
[1:52:21] I thought the Great great God Of Heaven
[1:52:23] that warm sun shining on me not a cloud
[1:52:25] nowhere and a few moments ago you just
[1:52:28] you just contradicted the man's word
[1:52:31] nature did it how could it be done Lord
[1:52:33] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:52:35] and forever it was his word that you
[1:52:38] just had me to speak yes Father how
[1:52:41] grateful I am I heard something
[1:52:44] going and I look standing right before
[1:52:46] me was two three deer and they were
[1:52:49] looking at me now them deer been shot at
[1:52:52] much in the last week and there was
[1:52:55] hunters in there and here I was dressed
[1:52:57] in red anyone knows they're gone that
[1:52:59] quick but they were looking at me and
[1:53:01] for eating de it could been no better
[1:53:03] was a big dough two big full grown fonds
[1:53:07] I thought that's just right we need
[1:53:09] three deer something said you know uh
[1:53:12] the Lord's put them in your hands but
[1:53:14] when I was with the Full Gospel business
[1:53:16] man brother Clayton about a year before
[1:53:18] he went with us when I caught that big
[1:53:20] record fish that year for a man I killed
[1:53:23] 19 head of elk and I the sometime
[1:53:28] businessman excuse this my brother some
[1:53:30] of them are doctors and you know they
[1:53:32] can't walk and fat you know and Men s to
[1:53:35] a desk and said Billy get me one two-y
[1:53:37] old get me a Blue Cow I want a buck get
[1:53:39] me a a full rack well I just had a
[1:53:41] jubilee out there shooting getting the
[1:53:43] El and thing but the Lord told me not to
[1:53:45] do that and I promised him in that
[1:53:47] blizzard over there in Colorado not
[1:53:50] years before that I said Lord I'll lead
[1:53:52] man to the game but no more kill game
[1:53:54] for man no not this it's emergency we
[1:53:57] have to have it and if you remember boys
[1:53:59] the night before we left poor little old
[1:54:02] brother down there hadn't got a deer
[1:54:04] what's his name polymer come around and
[1:54:07] put a $10 ties in my hand he said
[1:54:09] brother Brandon this is my ties put in
[1:54:10] the church he said will you get me a
[1:54:12] deer

[1:54:20] what I can and then up there
[1:54:23] a deer and right there in front of me
[1:54:25] stood those three deer I had this rifle
[1:54:27] of mine on my
[1:54:29] shoulder i s my shoulder like that I
[1:54:31] thought they can't get away from me
[1:54:33] they're right here I too fast at the
[1:54:35] rifle I get all three of them before you
[1:54:36] can turn around see and I had the r I
[1:54:38] thought there they are right I just
[1:54:40] slipped the rifle then I Happ to think
[1:54:42] of that promise I said I can't do it I
[1:54:44] can't do it amen I said I remember one
[1:54:48] time that a man told another God has put
[1:54:51] joab in your hand or sa joab told David
[1:54:55] David said God forbid that I touch his
[1:54:57] anointed that was my promise I wouldn't
[1:54:59] do it I thought they're right top of
[1:55:01] this hill I can roll them right down
[1:55:02] there we can pick them up easy three
[1:55:03] fine deer standing there I said no I
[1:55:06] can't do it and here this coming up like
[1:55:08] that a FS two full grown male female and
[1:55:12] a mother deer and they come walking
[1:55:15] looking around great big fat
[1:55:17] fellas I stood there a little bit and I
[1:55:19] thought that's unusual for deer and me
[1:55:21] this red all night like that I thought
[1:55:23] I'll scare them I said you're in my
[1:55:26] hands you couldn't get away if you
[1:55:28] wanted to but I'm not going to hurt you
[1:55:30] gu they just looked at one another and
[1:55:32] they kept coming and they got real close
[1:55:35] to me looking at me well I set the rifle
[1:55:39] down on the ground I said mother take
[1:55:42] your babies and go on out in the
[1:55:45] woods I'm here enjoying myself in the
[1:55:47] presence of God I promised that I

[2:01:45] amen have faith in God don't
[2:01:49] doubt be of a good courage
[2:02:06] amen praise the
[2:02:09] Lord You Lord so many years ago the Lord
[2:02:13] moved on that
[2:02:15] brother interceding for the prophet but
[2:02:18] interceding for all who would hear the
[2:02:21] word
[2:02:22] interceding for all who would hear the
[2:02:24] message
[2:02:26] amen the grace of
[2:02:29] God I've experienced those
[2:02:32] things over the years not late years but
[2:02:36] early years around this message oh yeah
[2:02:39] God moved during our Cottage meetings or
[2:02:44] during a meeting maybe in Bishop
[2:02:47] Falls the power and the anointing of the
[2:02:49] Holy Ghost was in the going forth of the
[2:02:50] word and there are times when when the
[2:02:53] anointing of the Holy Ghost fell upon a
[2:02:56] brother or sister and the Lord spoke
[2:02:59] through prophecy amen it was absolutely
[2:03:04] tremendous amen as I've expressed to you
[2:03:07] and
[2:03:09] uh after I finished my first sermon as a
[2:03:12] young man that uh and again there was
[2:03:17] there might been 200 people there in the
[2:03:20] church and the Lord moved upon two
[2:03:23] brothers to bring forth a
[2:03:26] message yeah by the grace of God to
[2:03:29] confirm what I
[2:03:32] said amen and the Lord reminded them
[2:03:36] in as he the brother spoke under the
[2:03:40] anointing reminded them that it wasn't
[2:03:44] me it wasn't my word it was his it was
[2:03:49] the word of God it was the word of the
[2:03:51] Lord
[2:03:52] because many would think that it was
[2:03:54] just brother Gerald expressing his
[2:03:56] thoughts or his feelings but no and of
[2:04:00] course again knowing the the Brethren
[2:04:02] that God used I felt the confidence that
[2:04:05] it was God it wasn't just
[2:04:09] emotion no no it was the Lord it was the
[2:04:11] moving of the Holy Ghost among us as I
[2:04:15] said it was brother Burns that spoke in
[2:04:18] tongues and oh that was many many years
[2:04:22] ago and uh brother Bill agot yeah he was
[2:04:27] the one that interpreted that God used
[2:04:29] to interpret you know so it was
[2:04:32] absolutely amazing as I said I was to at
[2:04:35] the time I was standing at the back seat
[2:04:37] after I finished in the bullpit and uh I
[2:04:40] said my tears stained the floor because
[2:04:43] I just cried and cried and cried and I
[2:04:46] might have been I don't know maybe 20
[2:04:48] years old and might have been only 19 I
[2:04:51] don't know know but as I said I was
[2:04:53] asked to uh get up and
[2:04:56] Minister uh until it got dark and
[2:04:59] brother brother car CER could show the
[2:05:02] films of the Prophet that was a long
[2:05:05] ways back because to show the films he
[2:05:08] had put on a large role like this and to
[2:05:13] go through it the oldfashioned things
[2:05:15] that they would show the
[2:05:17] films and so on of course then it went
[2:05:20] down to something smaller
[2:05:23] and even now to DVDs and so on but not
[2:05:28] it wasn't like that then but I tell you
[2:05:30] oh my you talk about the changing the
[2:05:33] atmosphere
[2:05:36] oh the entire church was
[2:05:39] filled with with a with in a sense it
[2:05:42] struck everybody so
[2:05:45] hard they almost all fell down yeah so I
[2:05:49] thank the Lord for that and I thank the
[2:05:51] Lord for this that after the prophet
[2:05:55] ministered the word that God's word
[2:05:58] calls for a total separation from
[2:06:00] unbelief amen it wasn't the prophet it
[2:06:03] was the word amen and then he went in to
[2:06:07] give
[2:06:09] testimony of what God had done for him
[2:06:12] and I have read that testimony and I've
[2:06:13] heard that testimony and other other
[2:06:15] messages and so on
[2:06:18] Amen and again it wasn't William brandom
[2:06:21] it was God
[2:06:23] yeah God was separating William brandom
[2:06:27] from all unbelief amen because they were
[2:06:31] taking advantage of brother brandham in
[2:06:33] his hunting and they wanted brother Bram
[2:06:36] to do this do this do that and uh but
[2:06:39] the Lord told him it wasn't right why
[2:06:42] because he was going out and he was
[2:06:44] going to kill animals for somebody else
[2:06:46] but they would give him money they would
[2:06:48] give him offerings they would give him
[2:06:49] their tithes and cash and say uh when
[2:06:52] you go out I want you to get me a deer I
[2:06:54] want you to get me this shoot me one and
[2:06:57] the Lord corrected him and said don't
[2:06:59] you do that no more no more amen so
[2:07:04] brother and he did
[2:07:06] say again
[2:07:09] right that he felt that he was going he
[2:07:12] was going to have to go soon that he was
[2:07:15] and it
[2:07:16] was yeah I don't know where that quote
[2:07:19] was
[2:07:22] but he he knew that he would be going
[2:07:24] off off
[2:07:25] the off the scene amen he was God's
[2:07:30] prophet and that God I tell he had the
[2:07:33] first pole second pole and God told him
[2:07:37] to stop using it and he was approaching
[2:07:39] the third pole the revelation of the
[2:07:42] word and after after God was finished
[2:07:43] with the opening of the word the mystery
[2:07:45] of God brother Brown knew that he was
[2:07:48] about to be taken off the scene because
[2:07:51] he no doubt he felt that the presence of
[2:07:53] God the anointing of God he wasn't
[2:07:55] experiencing like he used to under the
[2:07:58] first second and even the third pole but
[2:08:01] he knew he knew then oh yeah because
[2:08:03] it's it's in another message somewhere
[2:08:05] where he he said he felt as if
[2:08:07] everything was gone everything was you
[2:08:09] know it was just a dead thump there was
[2:08:12] no no Revival no no emotion no no
[2:08:16] feeling nothing and he felt it's it's
[2:08:19] over with now so he he said he would be
[2:08:21] going off the scene soon and of course
[2:08:24] this was just in jul January 64 and it
[2:08:28] was in uh December 65 that the Lord took
[2:08:31] him home and he knew he had to go I pray
[2:08:35] that we'll have that
[2:08:37] Assurance of the resurrection and
[2:08:39] Rapture as he did of him going as I said
[2:08:43] if he stayed maybe he would have just
[2:08:46] started to Rapture and went on oh yeah
[2:08:49] because of the faith that he had and so
[2:08:51] on so God took him off the
[2:08:54] scene
[2:08:55] amen amen so I pray the grace of God to
[2:08:59] help us brother and believe that not
[2:09:01] just brother Gerald because of his age
[2:09:04] but I pray that the rest of us here the
[2:09:06] Believers here across the island that
[2:09:09] Lord Brother that there were we're going
[2:09:11] to go off the scene Amen in Resurrection
[2:09:15] and rapturing glory for the glory of God
[2:09:19] well brother something got to happen
[2:09:21] something's going to happen but I pray
[2:09:23] Grace that we're not going to miss it
[2:09:26] and again remember remember
[2:09:29] again a warning that the prophet gave us
[2:09:32] concerning the
[2:09:33] Rapture and he said there will be a
[2:09:35] generation and there will be those that
[2:09:36] will rise up and say I thought there was
[2:09:39] to be a Rapture because they'll see
[2:09:41] certain things being fulfilled
[2:09:43] prophecies coming to pass this is
[2:09:45] happening thus sayeth the Lord is the
[2:09:47] Bible said this the Bible said that and
[2:09:48] it happened and there's going to be some
[2:09:51] here that'll that'll realize that yes I
[2:09:53] know that's the word and this is
[2:09:55] absolutely amazing that there's so much
[2:09:58] has come to pass and that God has
[2:10:00] fulfilled so many prophecies but where
[2:10:03] is the
[2:10:04] rapture and the prophet of God said it's
[2:10:07] going to strike them in their thoughts
[2:10:11] and say it's already happened and you
[2:10:14] didn't know
[2:10:17] it Grace brother sister that we're not
[2:10:20] going to miss it
[2:10:21] Grace that we're not going to miss the
[2:10:24] Revelation and the reality of the
[2:10:28] Rapture God help us brother yeah that's
[2:10:32] God that's God God is allowing this
[2:10:34] God's allowing that because it's the end
[2:10:36] it's the end and he's going to make an
[2:10:37] End of All Things where's the Rapture
[2:10:40] Lord I pray Grace that we're not here to
[2:10:42] hear that it's already happened and you
[2:10:44] didn't know
[2:10:45] it if there's anybody knows it it's the
[2:10:48] bride of Christ oh Grace Grace Grace see
[2:10:53] listen the bridegroom when he came and
[2:10:55] he was near he was nearing the the Final
[2:10:57] Phase of his ministry in the flesh he
[2:11:00] had three poles too right and so when he
[2:11:03] was nearing the final end of his
[2:11:04] ministry in the flesh he knew this is
[2:11:07] going to happen this going to happen and
[2:11:09] Peter stood up and pet no no no we don't
[2:11:12] want you to go down to Jerusalem they're
[2:11:14] not going to let this happen to you and
[2:11:16] he said get the behind me Satan it was
[2:11:18] Satan using Peter
[2:11:21] amen so brother let's listen to God not
[2:11:26] The
[2:11:27] Devil he's there to say yth God
[2:11:30] said oh yeah he's going to quote the
[2:11:33] word yeath God said yeath the prophet
[2:11:36] said
[2:11:37] but I say unto you oh no in a sense he
[2:11:42] it'll be like oh he's making the
[2:11:44] Revelation
[2:11:45] greater H he did to Eve because he said
[2:11:49] You shall be as
[2:11:52] Gods knowing good and evil if you do
[2:11:54] this if you'll do this if you'll do this
[2:11:56] brother sister let not the devil deceive
[2:11:59] you don't let the devil change this word
[2:12:03] or the
[2:12:03] Revelation let's let it let God keep it
[2:12:07] in our hearts God in
[2:12:10] Simplicity amen praise the Lord oh this
[2:12:14] this no no God sent the prophet preached
[2:12:17] the word and again you know I know I've
[2:12:20] mentioned a number of times lately that
[2:12:23] why did God do this why did God do that
[2:12:26] and so on and the power of God let us
[2:12:27] know why he see God did this this and
[2:12:30] this he said to give us rapturing
[2:12:35] Faith yeah so
[2:12:38] brother I pray Grace help us to realize
[2:12:41] that we're at the end it's finished and
[2:12:44] the next thing that God's going to do
[2:12:46] there be no prophit only to the
[2:12:49] Jews I pray we're not going to get mixed
[2:12:52] up and it's going to the
[2:12:54] Jews because he's why the prophet has
[2:12:57] come to the Gentiles it's done it's
[2:12:58] finished I tell
[2:13:00] you there's not going to be another
[2:13:03] Prophet come on the scene to Gentiles
[2:13:05] not by any means no no because I'll tell
[2:13:09] you the Judgment the only thing I sense
[2:13:11] in in the atmosphere all around
[2:13:13] everywhere is
[2:13:14] Judgment that's all I feel whereas I
[2:13:18] know for many years around the message
[2:13:20] that I sense the power of God the
[2:13:22] anointing of God oh my the love of God
[2:13:26] you you're going to a brother or
[2:13:27] sister's home and oh the atmosphere was
[2:13:29] so different and it's different
[2:13:32] now but instead of life it's
[2:13:35] death oh yeah it's Happ it's everywhere
[2:13:39] because as I said sometimes out there on
[2:13:41] the street was the power of God the
[2:13:43] anointing of God As I said one
[2:13:46] time a certain clergy was walking down a
[2:13:49] street and he met somebody that that I
[2:13:51] don't know if they went to his church or
[2:13:53] not but they wanted prayer oh I got to
[2:13:55] come and get get you to pray for me oh
[2:13:58] and he because he had a need so what did
[2:14:00] what happened there was others there
[2:14:02] that looked out their windows in their
[2:14:04] houses and looked oh what's he
[2:14:07] doing oh he went over to the brother and
[2:14:10] he and he laid his hands on him right on
[2:14:11] the street in public and he started to
[2:14:14] pray and pray and pray for yeah because
[2:14:17] that anointing was was everywhere it was
[2:14:20] in the church out of the the church it
[2:14:21] was in in your home out of your home no
[2:14:24] matter where you went the anointing was
[2:14:25] there yeah and and praise the Lord oh
[2:14:30] yeah but now no matter where you going
[2:14:33] now you got to make the Assurance of the
[2:14:36] anointing in you because it's not going
[2:14:39] any further it's going to come down in
[2:14:42] you amen and to give you the faith that
[2:14:45] that God wants you to have in these last
[2:14:47] days CU I tell you the at atmosphere is
[2:14:51] gone it's not like it used to be so
[2:14:54] that's why again the prophet of God said
[2:14:56] that he doubt if there be be a dozen
[2:14:59] Come Out of Africa even so oh he said
[2:15:03] there's going to be so few so few he
[2:15:05] started with you know maybe 1,000 1100
[2:15:08] whatever down to a few hundred a few
[2:15:09] hundred 500 300 and then finally he said
[2:15:14] he might find a
[2:15:17] dozen God help us to love the Lord and I
[2:15:21] tell you if you love God you'll manifest
[2:15:24] it to to to your brothers and sisters in
[2:15:27] Christ oh yeah you you you'll be the
[2:15:30] love of God they want the love of God

[2:15:34] anointing you got that life on the in
[2:15:36] your heart in your soul amen praise the
[2:15:39] Lord I pray Grace Lord help us it's not
[2:15:42] out there it's not in it's not in the in
[2:15:46] the atmosphere in the church or in the
[2:15:47] atmosphere of the world there no but
[2:15:49] it's in the bride
[2:15:51] yes and that's going to Rapture the
[2:15:53] bride she's gone God help us
[2:15:59] amen bear with me
[2:16:03] uh brother Brandon mentioned those
[2:16:05] Brothers there the Martin
[2:16:07] Brothers Well I met the Martin brothers
[2:16:11] and uh brother Earl
[2:16:14] Martin I witnessed his ministry in
[2:16:18] Bishop
[2:16:19] Falls he he was he came to Bishop Falls
[2:16:22] to fellowship with us him and another
[2:16:26] brother and think might have been
[2:16:28] brother Lonnie Jenkins I'm not sure but
[2:16:31] was brother I remember Lonnie Jenkins
[2:16:33] ministered in Bishop Falls he ministered
[2:16:35] in bun and a number of other places
[2:16:37] around newf land and of course he's gone
[2:16:40] on now to be with the Lord he's waiting
[2:16:42] on us amen so and I think brother Lonnie
[2:16:46] Jin might have been the other brother
[2:16:48] that came with our brother Earl Martin
[2:16:51] yeah and our brother Earl ministered to
[2:16:53] us so we we thank the Lord for our
[2:16:56] brother's Ministry
[2:16:58] amen but brother I just want to
[2:17:01] highlight too that what the prophet
[2:17:04] preached was God's word calls for a
[2:17:08] total separation from
[2:17:10] unbelief you it wasn't William brandham
[2:17:14] it's not me it's not the preacher it's
[2:17:16] not brother Jonathan no it's God's word
[2:17:19] we're reminding you of what the word
[2:17:21] said it is written thus sayeth the Lord
[2:17:25] amen so it wasn't William bandam calling
[2:17:27] for separation no it was God God God
[2:17:31] brought William branon to a total
[2:17:32] separation from unbelief now he's going
[2:17:34] to bring you and me to that total
[2:17:36] separation from unbelief he's got to
[2:17:37] bring us to that for the Rapture amen
[2:17:41] for the
[2:17:42] resurrection because as the Resurrection
[2:17:44] the power and the anointing and the
[2:17:46] spirit of the Resurrection was in the
[2:17:47] bridegroom he said I am the resurrection
[2:17:51] but it's also in the bride and the dead
[2:17:53] in that's why the dead in Christ are
[2:17:55] waiting on
[2:17:56] us to really have faith faith faith not
[2:18:00] just coold
[2:18:02] formal you know denominational Spirit
[2:18:06] Believers no no no we're Holy Ghost
[2:18:09] Believers amen and we have amen what God
[2:18:13] is doing we have that anointing in our
[2:18:15] hearts and our souls amen or there just
[2:18:18] very little of it out there in the world
[2:18:20] but it's it's here in in in a little
[2:18:22] church here a little church somewhere
[2:18:24] else and so on and
[2:18:27] again and many preachers they felt
[2:18:29] offended sometimes because brother
[2:18:32] brandom would he would forsake going out
[2:18:36] and preaching to 3,000 and he would he
[2:18:38] would go to a a cottage meeting and he
[2:18:41] said and preach maybe to a couple of
[2:18:43] dozen people yes he said because that's
[2:18:45] where God can deal with us he said in a
[2:18:48] cottage meeting God can deal with us in
[2:18:50] a small building it's just a few people
[2:18:52] here and a few people there
[2:18:55] amen but yeah but they think oh well if
[2:18:59] it's God God will bless us and God will
[2:19:01] add to the church god'll add to the
[2:19:02] church well I tell you this when Jesus
[2:19:06] spoke the
[2:19:08] truth the the disciples many disciples
[2:19:11] walked away from him and at one time he
[2:19:14] made a statement there and they never
[2:19:16] got the revelation of it and 70
[2:19:20] disciples
[2:19:21] said who can believe this and they
[2:19:23] walked away and they went with him no
[2:19:26] more Amen brother the closer we get to
[2:19:30] the end and the and the seriousness of
[2:19:32] the message amen I I know there's going
[2:19:36] to be fewer and fewer True
[2:19:39] Believers they're going to be
[2:19:40] denominational Believers believe this
[2:19:42] message because they have a
[2:19:43] denominational Spirit yeah but there's
[2:19:47] going to be a few that'll be bride and
[2:19:49] they'll have no denominational Spirit
[2:19:51] they'll have the resurrection Spirit and
[2:19:53] the rapturing spirit God help us stay
[2:19:57] with what God is doing amen and what's
[2:20:01] he doing he's going to he's going to
[2:20:03] make bring to pass what this word is
[2:20:07] ordained to do the resurrection and the
[2:20:11] Rapture oh we want God this God that
[2:20:14] he's already done all of that now if you
[2:20:17] look into the word what he wants to do
[2:20:19] now is is to is to resurrect those that
[2:20:22] are dead in Christ amen and those that
[2:20:25] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[2:20:27] together with them to meet the Lord in
[2:20:29] the air God help us to
[2:20:32] believe
[2:20:38] Amen in the me in the message itself
[2:20:42] again to remind you of something he
[2:20:44] said he said in the Bible First John or
[2:20:49] St John Rather the first chapter chapter
[2:20:51] he said in the beginning was the word
[2:20:54] the word was with God the Word was God
[2:20:57] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[2:20:59] Us the word is made flesh in the
[2:21:02] bride are you the word in flesh amen if
[2:21:07] you are you're going to have the spirit
[2:21:09] that Jesus had you'll have the anointing
[2:21:11] that Jesus had
[2:21:13] amen and it says he is the same
[2:21:16] yesterday today and forever are you like
[2:21:20] Jesus
[2:21:22] Jesus is your attitude like Jesus
[2:21:25] attitude is your spirit like Jesus
[2:21:28] Spirit the life you live is that the
[2:21:30] life that Jesus lived is it Christ in
[2:21:33] you like the Bible says it's not me that
[2:21:35] lives it's Christ that liveth in me amen
[2:21:39] so are you living that life like Jesus
[2:21:41] would live it I tell you the closer you
[2:21:43] get to the change the more and more
[2:21:46] you're going to be like
[2:21:47] Jesus amen
[2:21:51] this but it's a
[2:21:53] challenge because there's a lot not
[2:21:56] because why they haven't surrendered and
[2:21:59] they haven't experienced the total
[2:22:01] separation that God wants oh yeah
[2:22:05] because why because you're going to be
[2:22:06] more subject to their flesh and that old
[2:22:09] nature and less and less subject to the
[2:22:11] spirit of God God help
[2:22:15] us he said sin is
[2:22:18] unbelief there was no unbelief found in
[2:22:21] him nowhere when he was here on Earth he
[2:22:24] said who can condemn me of sin sin is
[2:22:27] unbelief he couldn't condemn Jesus of
[2:22:30] unbelief and brother there's going to be
[2:22:32] a bride that you can't condemn them of
[2:22:34] unbelief because they believe
[2:22:37] God Amen that's right praise the Lord oh
[2:22:41] yeah anybody that believes God is going
[2:22:42] to be the bride amen you're going to
[2:22:45] have that Faith to take us out of time
[2:22:46] and into
[2:22:48] eternity amen so they can't condemn you
[2:22:52] of unbelief you might be guilty of this
[2:22:55] guilty of that physically you know but
[2:22:57] no they say you did this you did that oh
[2:23:00] yeah but I believe God and he's taking
[2:23:03] me on to Perfection absolute complete
[2:23:07] deliverance amen amen amen if I haven't
[2:23:11] done just what was prophesied for this
[2:23:13] age if I haven't met the requirements of
[2:23:16] what Messiah is supposed to do then
[2:23:18] don't believe me and he said this is
[2:23:21] what Jesus was
[2:23:22] saying and Jesus said search the
[2:23:25] scriptures for in them you think you
[2:23:27] have eternal life and they are they that
[2:23:29] testify of me does the scripture testify
[2:23:31] of you the life you
[2:23:34] live your spirit your attitude your
[2:23:37] motives and objectives
[2:23:42] amen he said Jesus is the same yesterday
[2:23:45] today and forever and it's always a
[2:23:47] connection with the spoken word of God
[2:23:49] God's Pro promise for the day and when
[2:23:52] it comes it's so unusual till people can
[2:23:55] hardly grasp it and that's
[2:23:59] true that the bride is
[2:24:01] being made ready for the Rapture
[2:24:04] separating from the world the things of
[2:24:06] the world more and more and more but the
[2:24:09] world doesn't recognize what God is
[2:24:10] doing in you they don't know they you're
[2:24:12] just odd you're just different yeah but
[2:24:17] we're getting out of time into eternity
[2:24:21] and he says it's so unusual till people
[2:24:23] can hardly grasp it because we're so
[2:24:26] sowed to forms and ideas of our own and
[2:24:29] he said that it's hard for us to grasp
[2:24:32] what is the truth God help us that we
[2:24:35] believe the truth the word
[2:24:43] amen he said so is it today brothers or
[2:24:46] Brethren that the power of the
[2:24:48] resurrection of Jesus Christ and his
[2:24:49] promise word of this hour is so unusual
[2:24:53] good man stumble over it it's too
[2:24:57] unusual amen but when a man is born in
[2:25:01] the world he said for a Believer he
[2:25:04] becomes a Nazarite unto the Lord when he
[2:25:08] separates himself from anything that's
[2:25:10] contrary to the word amen God help
[2:25:16] us so are you in that anointing that
[2:25:19] you're separating yourself any
[2:25:21] experiences that you have in your daily
[2:25:23] life does anything strike you so that
[2:25:25] you got to stop it and lay it aside I'm
[2:25:27] not going to do that no more forgive me
[2:25:29] Lord just help me to go on oh yeah
[2:25:32] because I tell you the closer we're
[2:25:33] getting to the Rapture and the
[2:25:34] resurrection that that we're going to
[2:25:37] recognize more and more and more that is
[2:25:39] in the eyes of God is
[2:25:41] sin and we'll be praying Lord take it
[2:25:43] away from
[2:25:44] me amen see God look looks at your heart
[2:25:49] amen amen praise the
[2:25:53] Lord so he
[2:25:56] said he said so it is today Brethren the
[2:25:59] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[2:26:01] Christ and his promised word of this
[2:26:02] hour it's so unusual good man stumble
[2:26:06] over it's too
[2:26:09] unusual he said but when a man is born
[2:26:12] and he becomes a Nazarite and he he
[2:26:15] separates himself from anything that's
[2:26:18] contrary to the word see again again
[2:26:20] total separation from unbelief a total
[2:26:23] separation and Jesus said I came and
[2:26:26] come to separate a man from his wife
[2:26:28] tear up a family and he that won't take
[2:26:32] up his cross and follow me is not worthy
[2:26:34] of me and not worthy to be called mine
[2:26:38] are we would he consider you
[2:26:42] worthy yeah and he's he's highlighting
[2:26:45] here I think it's Luke 14 brother if
[2:26:49] there's anything
[2:26:51] oh I tell you maybe it's not the people
[2:26:54] out there in the world that he that the
[2:26:55] enemy will use you to weaken your faith
[2:26:58] but rather sometimes his family and
[2:27:00] friends and neighbors the enemy will use
[2:27:02] you in your relationship with them to
[2:27:04] weaken your faith
[2:27:08] amen God's
[2:27:12] grace he said a separation from anything
[2:27:16] everything from church from a community
[2:27:19] from a belief from family or anything
[2:27:22] that would stand between you and
[2:27:24] believing the entire word of God if your
[2:27:27] soul will not punctuate every promise
[2:27:29] for this hour with an amen there is
[2:27:32] something wrong somewhere you need a
[2:27:36] separation amen amen
[2:27:41] amen and he said it's a it's a
[2:27:43] separation and he said it's always the
[2:27:46] word requires total and complete
[2:27:49] separation ation and it
[2:27:53] does so are we totally separated unto
[2:27:56] the Lord we have to be totally separated
[2:27:58] to the Lord for the Rapture that's right
[2:28:01] amen he says separation has separated
[2:28:04] Isaac or Isaiah rather it separated
[2:28:07] Isaiah from the church World it
[2:28:09] separated Moses from the church World it
[2:28:11] separated Jesus from his Brethren and
[2:28:14] they did when Jesus went back to
[2:28:16] capernum they
[2:28:17] said those that were is Step Brothers we
[2:28:21] call it all said why don't you do some
[2:28:24] Miracles here why don't you do you do
[2:28:26] signs and wonders there there there why
[2:28:28] don't you do it here he said because of
[2:28:29] your
[2:28:30] unbelief yeah they didn't they didn't
[2:28:34] believe him
[2:28:36] amazing so Jesus separated from his
[2:28:39] Brethren and it separated the apostles
[2:28:41] from the church that was at that day and
[2:28:44] the Pharisees Sadducees great man holy
[2:28:47] man good man fine man humble man he said
[2:28:50] man that had the fruit of the spirit
[2:28:52] more so than what Jesus
[2:28:55] exercised in the eyes of
[2:28:58] God they they didn't consider Jesus to
[2:29:00] have all the fruit of the spirit because
[2:29:03] some of the things Jesus preached they
[2:29:05] felt was too hard and he was condemning
[2:29:07] this condemning that no he was speaking
[2:29:09] the
[2:29:10] truth
[2:29:12] amen
[2:29:14] Grace that we'll stand and stay with the
[2:29:16] word
[2:29:23] and he said I might not be able to
[2:29:25] understand all that's in here but I
[2:29:27] believe it it's God's word I want to
[2:29:30] separate myself from anything that's
[2:29:32] contrary to the word amen I have tried
[2:29:36] to stand like
[2:29:39] that God help us to have faith like that
[2:29:43] we believe this Bible to be the truth I
[2:29:45] may not have faith enough to make all
[2:29:47] the promises come to pass but I believe
[2:29:49] it
[2:29:50] I believe the hour that we are living
[2:29:54] amen so I pray Grace that we believe the
[2:29:57] hour We're
[2:29:58] living grace
[2:30:02] amen I leave it
[2:30:05] there God's word calls for a total
[2:30:07] separation from unbelief
[2:30:10] amen so I pray Grace that we are praying
[2:30:14] amen constantly Lord bring us to that
[2:30:18] total separation so that there's nothing
[2:30:20] out there influencing influencing
[2:30:24] us Lord to bring down our relationship
[2:30:27] with you oh yeah that will make that
[2:30:31] make our relationship with Jesus less
[2:30:33] and less and less and less so Jesus got
[2:30:35] less and less influence in our lives
[2:30:38] Grace that we're going to separate from
[2:30:41] all the unbelief that the devil is
[2:30:44] trying to get to control us unbelief
[2:30:47] yeah oh well I believe the word I
[2:30:49] believe the but yeah but the devil you
[2:30:51] know God wants you to believe it this
[2:30:53] way the devil's going to try to get you
[2:30:55] to believe it that way as he did Eve in
[2:30:58] the garden oh yeah so God help me God
[2:31:02] help you God help us all to be more and
[2:31:04] more
[2:31:06] sincere Amen to give more and more of
[2:31:09] Our Lives to the control of the word the
[2:31:12] Holy Ghost again it's a challenge it's
[2:31:16] not me that lives not it's it's Jesus
