not a religious spirit but the Holy Spirit there's too many going around with religious Spirits my brother what God's looking for is the holy spirit amen it is that all that proves that it is Christ in you the home of glory and it's not me that lives is Christ that liveth in me amen amen so we pray the grace of God that all of us have come with the anointing of the holy spirit amen so that he is in control in the singing in the prayers in Amen in the going further the word in our thoughts in our meditations amen for the glory of God praise the Lord and we welcome our visitors and oh yes is it the grants that okay so the Lord bless us and we have sister Sandy here amen we're she's she's a visitor but for many many years she was just one of the regular attendants amen and it's amazing grace amen that she they were under her and her family under my Ministry for a number of years and now just think that we're going to come under the ministry of one of her sons amen our Brothers Johnson so we look forward to that and be in prayer for brother Jonathan as he comes forward with the word amen and I just want to share some thoughts with you because uh myself sister bitty just arrived back uh I believe it was yesterday from Central Newfoundland and we were we were traveling traveling traveling and we had many many many uh visitations with the different Believers in central Newfoundland and oh my it's quite it's quite a list of those that we had fellowship with while we were in central Newfoundland and we were fellowshipping with our brother and sister Ellsworth amend that because when we arrived there there was a fellowship for a lot of the Believers at a at a restaurant and our brother and sister else were there amen so we appreciate the fellowship with our brother and sister and also our brother Tom and sister Shirley snow and of course again our brother Ron and sister Shirley snow and uh they kept referring to all the Snows that are out there I said well that's all right we got a lot of coffee so I said you can have the snow on and we'll take the coffee amen so because if brother Ron and Shirley snow brother ain't can burn the snow we've been fellowship with them amen and uh and uh and others out there as well a brother uh oh my what are their names now and then we had uh brother Doug and Beverly and they were there and we had fellowship with them and a young man brother Bradley uh I think his brother Ron's grandson and sister showed his grandson and uh some years ago that I do remember sitting on the Chesterfield at brother Ron's home and he was sitting next to me he was just a teenager of course he's just a young man in his 20 early 20s now and he was just a teenager and and I remember we did talk about the Lord and and about the word of God and today amen and today he is serving the lord amen today he is worshiping the Lord amen it was tremendous and he did he said want to thank you he said Brothers for your influence and it was good just just to talk with this young brother I believe he's around 23 years old now and we pray the grace of God to continue with him as he continues in the word praise the Lord of course while we were there with the at brother Ron sister Shirley's of course young Bradley he was just a a young boy a young young teenager anybody who's a grand grandson amen so thank God for the influence amen of the of the word in his heart in his soul and in his life amen he is serving God so I pray God's grace too brother Bradley amen of course as well as well to brother Ron's sister Shirley and again just to say that we did have a fellowship with each one and uh with some of them we were invited to have a meal with them of course at brother Tom's Mr Shirley's brother Ron sister surely brother Hank sister Verna and again they're all snows amen and of course too uh we had Fellowship again because they were there in central brother Doug and sister Beverly but they're originally they're from Western Newfoundland and so they were there for a couple of days and then returned to Western Newfoundland and but we also have fellowship with brother Clarence stride and uh sister Linda I think is peckford sister Linda peckford amen and they're they're also from the same town and of course sister stride has gone on and we did appreciate the fellowship with with her as well so we pray God's God's grace to those that we visited and we want to thank you for your prayers amen because the Lord was with us and the lord gave us His blessings and the lord gave us his leadership Amen in fellowship with the Saints to God be the glory amen so just to say that I appreciate that you keep us in prayer amen we're returned and of course brother Jonathan's been Ministry and so the Lord willing may be our your pastor of your ministry on Wednesday or maybe next Sunday we'll see and I don't know how much longer sister Sandy to be here how much another 12 days oh excellent amen and God bless the other visitors that we have amen may the Lord keep you for 12 days amen amen so we'll put it all in the hands of the Lord by the grace of God Amen so we're going to stay on the listing stand and say only believe all things are possible and we'll turn to our our brother uh Jonathan for the going forth of the word and just to say again I won't preach so I was going to read a scripture but we'll leave that amen because I I'm always warned not to talk too long amen well I guess that's the nature of a Preacher amen Amen brother glad he understands amen so the Lord bless us all and pray God bless brother Jonathan the going forth of the word amen and God bless our visitors amen you're welcome to stay as long as long as you well not late not well as long as you want to stay as long as the Lord wants you to stay amen so Lord bless us amen only believe all things are possible [Music] [Music] only believe oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] because Jesus is here amen Jesus is here Jesus all things are possible because Jesus is here amen [Music] Lord I believe Lord I be amen [Music] amen Lord I believe [Music] yes amen [Music] Lord I need all things are possible Lord foreign s to the Saints here amen and also to ask you that you remember my sibling brother Clayton Lush in prayer he is in the gander hospital at this time and we did visit him and uh so we pray the grace of God to him and to his wife Joyce amen so that the Lord will give him the strength that he needs to get back home amen amen right now they are I think they're living in Gander so we pray the grace of God to be with his wife amen as he's as she endures it and it's constantly there every day with with my brother amen so the grace of God and again to keep keep one another in prayer over an hour that we need to pray at this hour every day over an age we need to to remember one another keep one another in prayer is this ours this age that we're living in now why because brother this is the hour when the Bible says that when Jesus said when he when the son of man comes will he find Faith amen because there's going to be so much unbelief in the world there's gonna be so little faith so we pray the grace of God that he's finding faith in you faith in me amen and brother that he'll get he'll increase our faith through the going forth of the word amen so keep it keep in prayer and keep in the spirit amen give Jesus control not you living let it be Jesus living in you amen for the glory of God God bless you amen now say again only believe and our brother Johnson will come [Music] oh yeah [Music] only believe oh baby [Music] all things are possible only believe let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you sent us a seventh angel with a message Gordon how many times did he tell us only believe or that if we could believe all things were possible Lord not to believe just anything Lord but if we could believe what you've said what if we believe what you promised Lord then it would come to pass in our lives and Lord we're asking for a greater Faith this morning Lord that we would step into a higher plain Lord a greater rest Lord a greater peace Lord a greater trust in you Lord that your word would have the the full preeminence in our life Lord God Lord that out of us will flow the very manifestation of the things that we read and and talk about Lord God but may not just stay in our hearts or maybe but may it come out into our lives we pray Lord for those around us to see that you are alive and well Lord grant us your grace this morning as we Minister Lord may it be you that speaks or may you set me aside completely Lord that you would touch the lives and hearts of the Believers here Lord and online Lord and anyone that might hear it later Lord we pray that your holy spirit will just reach into their hearts and souls Lord we pray Lord to give them something of Eternal value in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it [Music] amen God bless you thank you musicians man if you'll turn your scriptures to Exodus 15 and while you're you're turning there I want to do a quick update I spoke with Brother David Nash Our the missionary we've been supporting and he'd sent me some pictures over the last few days so this is him in the the center the the old white guy and uh on the left we have brother Eric and then on the right we have uh brother Eli and those are both translators that have worked with him while he's there and he told me in 19 days of travel he says I'll have done 18 services in one wedding so call it a service every day on average so certainly he's had his work cut out for me for him rather and he wanted to send some pictures of the services so this is one of the the services I believe in in the Panama area one of the churches he went to and then this is another one and if you look at the outside that is the outside of the church and then on the inside is is what they have so very simple it's not a fancy Thing by any means no air conditioning no no special Comforts or anything like that but that's where they preach amen that's what it means to go into the mission field it's certainly not about Comfort he sent me pictures I refused to put them up of his feet and what they look like after hiking through the mountains to get where they needed to go and he's covered in welts and insect bites and these different things from where he had to go you know so he says if you have any young preachers that have an itch to preach he says send them here we'll give them something to itch you know it's I said we want to encourage them Brother David not discourage them but anyways it's not it's certainly not a life of of ease or or pleasure High pay or anything but they're out there for the souls amen and then this is the the last set of services they just had this this last weekend in a couple different churches there and uh you know maybe 40 50 people not much different than what we have but uh just thankful that God's using them that the people are responding amen and that the word is hitting the mark amen Exodus chapter 15 Exodus 15 and verse 9 and this is the song of the redeemed if you look in in if you've got the uh the same Bible I do then it says there that it's Redemption completed by Blood and by power and though this is the song of the redeemed amen verse 9 says the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will devoid divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them that it's blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in The Mighty Waters who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful and Praises doing wonders thou stretched out thy right hand and the Earth swallowed them thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou Hast redeemed thou Hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning and we're going to be starting a new series this morning and this is one that's been kind of waiting in the wings for for maybe as much as as three years and I've just been dwelling on things and kind of compiling things as I've went through different things and and certainly the ministers amongst us will know that when you're studying for something sometimes you you see something you say that's so good but I don't have enough to preach on it so you stick it over in another in another page in another file and you just you just kind of stash these things over there and this is what's been been happening on the the sermon and the the series that we're gonna to start here and of course back when this was coming to me in the beginning I didn't have the opportunity to minister kind of in consecutive Services the way I do here and so I feel like the Lord has really opened up this opportunity for me and and even to show me things that I've never seen before Amanda that's where you want to preach from is not just a place of comfort but a place of newness a place of Revelation to see what God is doing in this age amen and I want to start this series on Redemption amen and it's such a huge topic because when you look at it everything that that that is the Christian walk is tied into Redemption this entire book is a book of redemption amen it's the great plan of God to bring us back to what we were and and what he intended in the beginning and so everything everything can be tied back to Redemption it'd be almost impossible to look at this Bible and not tie what you read in some form or way back to Redemption amen and we know we're in a fallen condition and then we're nowhere in a follow condition because we know that we know there's a right and we know there's a wrong and and yet we don't always do what's right and we know that that in our souls there's something that's crying out and yet our body and even our spirit at times is fighting against it and it's resisting it's so we know we're not where we ought to be and then we know we're not in that condition we're not in the original condition we're in because we're seeking something that we don't have amen and it's not money and it's not houses and it's not vehicles and it's not careers but it's something far bigger and far greater than that and what we're doing is we're seeking back to our origin amen amen the prophet said that origin is Destiny amen and what we're doing is we're reaching we're reaching forward to that which is behind us if that makes sense Amen to what we were we're reaching forward to it because we're coming back out of time and into eternity and that's the great story of redemption in the self and so I want to start this this series on Redemption I just want to take a title this morning of in the beginning because we want to understand how God works and we want to understand the laws and the principles of God when it comes to Redemption because if we don't get that right then we'll twist what Redemption looks like and it'll turn into what we see in Parenthood and marriages and all these different things today where they've twisted up what it means to truly love what it truly means to to do what's best for somebody or something amen and we then the other thing is we want to understand how God works so that we don't get in his way amen as parents we can certainly appreciate what happens when we're trying to do something and our children come and they want to help us and then what do they do they get in the way and they just keep tripping us up and they keep knocking things over and breaking things and making it worse than the way it was before you even started amen we don't want to get in God's way because it doesn't bother God God's got all the time in the world Amen he's he's residing in eternity and and he's in no rush but the only one that hurts when we get in his way is US amen we're the ones that pay the price when we get in his way because we hold him back from doing the things that he's supposed to be doing so in doing this we certainly want to get with the program amen and I started with that General scripture in Exodus and we're going to come back to it in a future service but I I just wanted to focus on this this verse 13 here because this is really the meat of redemption right here and it says Thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou Hast redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy Holiness you notice there there's a lot of thousands and thighs and there's no eyes amen and that's the great story of redemption is that it's it's not about you that's doing anything it's about somebody else and it says Thou amen amen the the whole start of this is who thou who is thou it is Jehovah God it is The Great I Am it is the Lord God it's the self-existing one that's what we're talking about when it comes to Redemption here is it's not just some some person that's just a little bit bigger a little bit better a little bit gooder somebody has a little more than we do but we're talking about The Great I Am we're talking about God the Father himself amen and he says Thou and thy mercy has led forth the people which thou Hast redeemed amen I want you to catch that there is a particular people that's going to be redeemed because we look at this situation this is right after the Red Sea and there were those that were redeemed and then there was everybody else amen and what happened to everybody else in the verses preceding that is that they died amen that the works of God destroyed them that but there was a people that came through the very same situation that went through the very same Waters and it did not destroy them but it saved them so our saving is their destruction our Mercy is their judgment amen we want to be on the mercy side we want to be counted with those that are the redeemed amen and we see here that they are redeemed brother Brown talks about an exodus he says in Exodus has to bring you out and it has to bring you in and it's the same thing for Redemption as it takes you out of a condition and it brings you into a condition it takes you out of a place and it brings you back to your original place it takes you out of your out of your walking in a strange place and it brings you home is what it does redemption brings you out of something so it can bring you into something now Psalms 107 says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever amen we're looking to his goodness we're looking to his Mercy why because when ours gives up his continues when we think that we've done enough when we think that that's as far as I need to go yet his mercy and his goodness goes above and beyond that it reaches far higher and it reaches far deeper than we as humans could ever imagine and you cannot you're never warranted you're you never deserve it this is what this is all about is his goodness and his grace is far beyond anything we could say or do that would pull us away from him he says let the redeemed of the Lord say so say so what that he is good and his Mercy endures forever whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the East and from the west and from the north and from the south amen so I want you to realize today that the redeemed are not gathered because they're perfect or beautiful or complete or amazing but they are redeemed because God is good and his Mercy endures forever amen this is the the very the the very Viewpoint of redemption is that it is not about the one receiving it but it is a reflection of the one that's giving it amen and that's what we'll see in this in the theme of redemption throughout this entire thing it is a process of Grace because Redemption is required for those that are unworthy for those that have wasted things for those that have spoiled things for those that are imperfect for those that have made wrong decisions for those that have gotten them into trouble for those that have ruined what God gave to them in the first place Redemption is for the imperfect amen so if you're sitting there and you're saying well I don't need Redemption then you're in a layout of seeing condition because that's what they said is I don't need anything I've got what I need and I'm good to go from where I am amen the beauty of redemption is that you can be in any condition as long as you don't believe you don't need it if you don't need it then you're never going to get redeemed but if you need it then you are a qualified person for Redemption amen if you are out from what you're supposed to be if you're away from your original position if you lack any portion of that which God has for you then you are a candidate for Redemption this morning coming back to this verse 13 it says Thou Hast guided them in thy strength amend the Redemption process is not done based on my strength not based on my discipline on my my ability to stay in line but rather it's a reflection of my inability to do it in somebody who is greater than all of those things amen that he's greater than my mistakes it is his strength that is going to perform the Redemption that we require he says he has guided them and thy strength unto thy holy habitation amen Redemption always takes you somewhere and we look at this scripture and it says that there is a holy habitation there's a place where God will dwell and that's where Redemption takes you is the place that God dwells amen it what it always Redemption always involves a relocation amen you can never stay where you are and say I'm redeemed because it means you're out you're to be redeemed you have to be outside of where you're supposed to be so it always involves a change it always involves a move it always enchant entails of relocation otherwise you're not in the Redemption process so if we're sitting here this morning and we're saying I'm in the process of redemption and nothing has changed in your life and you haven't made any movements then you're not in the process of redemption I'm not saying it's not available I'm saying you haven't been started in the process because if you're staying where you are then something's wrong because Redemption always moves you to something Psalms 132 says and this is the holy habitation it says for the Lord had chosen Zion he had desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it now this is Abraham's Royal seed promise because we're talking about Zion because remember for Abraham he said what I am thy shield and I am thy exceeding great portion amen Abraham's promise was not a land the promise of a lamb was to Abraham's seed but the promise to Abraham was I I am amen that's what we're looking for sorry Redemption is not a land that's why we're pilgrims and strangers here is because our promise is not a land that is here but our promise is a reunion with Christ with God the Father amen it is a reunion back to the Oneness that we had in the very beginning so this is Zion and Zion is always the elect the true church and today will be the bride of Christ amen but if you know anything about Zion Zion is a portion of Jerusalem did you know that Zion is the two easternmost Hills of Jerusalem so what you have is you have a big book and you have a portion in the book and the portion in the book is Zion and the big picture is Jerusalem put your spiritual caps on we're not going to go there this morning but it's saying that there's a place and we'll get into the scripture shortly there's a place called Jerusalem and that's where what God's chosen her but he says in the middle he says there's an elect and that's the ones that are in a special place and he calls it Mount Zion and then so Zion is a portion of Jerusalem now Isaiah 4 and we're teaching this morning he says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that our Escape of Israel it says and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion left in Zion to him that overcometh to the one that's still standing when it's all said and done that's who this is for he says and he that remaineth in Jerusalem amen so there are those that stay remember what happened in when the Jews were scattered right and they left the Homeland for those that will come back that's where they're going to get the blessing amen Israel is only truly blessed when they're in the land of Israel because that is their inheritance that's their inheritance Abraham's Royal seat their inheritance is God but then you have the natural seed and their inheritance is the land of Israel so he says those that come back to Jerusalem those that will come back to the Homeland they're going to get a blessing he says they'll be called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Israel when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion Zion needs to be cleaned up the bride needs to be cleaned up because she's out of a gentile Nation I mean she's out of all the rest of the nation she needs to be cleaned up there's no Purity in her there's no Purity in her we need the righteousness of Christ amen so she is the one that's dirty and then it says and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning so you see the Jews had to be forgiven for the crucifixion of Christ so what there is a judgment first of what it has to be purged from the blood of Christ it has to be purged from what they did there has to be a forgiveness there and remember that Paul says I can't come to you anymore now I'm going to the Gentiles you've turned it down you turned him down then you turn the message that followed he says I'm turning to them they have to be judged by Blood and what have we seen by the Jews ever since they've been judged by Blood they've been persecuted they've been destroyed they've been spread across the world they've been judged by Blood even to the millions that were killed during the during the second world war in those times right what is it they were purged by Blood and then it says by the spirit of burning the prophet of God points out he says that's when the 144 000 now come back and they receive their Messiah and they receive the same message that we have and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to restore them to the union of Christ amen so they've got to be judged for what they did and then they've got to get the same holy ghost that we do because you can't be a part of the you can't be a part of the elect unless you have the Life of Christ in you amen they've got to receive the Same Spirit it says and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the Heat and a place of refuge and a covert from the storm and from rain now we see a prophetic fulfillment to this in the Book of Revelation where John has a preview of the bride of Christ and this is in Revelation 21. John says I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea now it says a new Heaven and a new Earth but we know that the globe itself is not destroyed right it's just burned by fire we know that because it says that it was it was burned up and it says even the elements of the air burned up amen there's a total cleaning there's a total Destruction of anything that was tainted or touched by sin so everything is destroyed even the elements you know we talk about pollution in the air guess what the fire is going to burn so hot and so heavy it'll burn up the pollution there will be nothing left of sin here so when we're looking at newness here it's that the the original part is still there but everything that's touched by sin is destroyed and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a Grace voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is where with men this is the holy habitation now and he will dwell with them they shall be his people and God himself God himself shall be with him and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow no crying neither shall be any more pain for the former things are passed away Hallelujah that the former things are going to be passed away with all that's happened to us and all that's happening and all that's gone on it'll all be passed away and he sat upon the he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new he didn't say I make all new things he says I make all things new because we think of new and we think well it's it's brand new it's just come into existence it's come into creation but the word new here is pointing back that I make things the way they used to be I make them as if they've never made a mistake you didn't do it in the first place I'm bringing you back to the original way it was when Adam and Eve first walked in the garden when they had a the the cool of the evening and God walked amongst them amen he says I make all things new I restore it back I redeem it back I put it to the way it was supposed to be in the first place I make all things new I'm not not I make all new things he's what he's restoring us back he's redeeming us back to where we were supposed to be amen that's why God can wipe away all tears that's why he can wipe away all tears nothing exists to point you to the pain and the suffering and the hurts and the bad decisions and the wrong this and the horrible that everything temporal everything touched by sin is destroyed and what he does is he restores it back to the way it was supposed to be now that's a quick picture that's just a quick picture of the Redemption plan of God that's where he's taking us amen but there's a lot that had to happen because he spent four thousand years giving them the law and the law achieved absolutely nothing except it kept them to the point where Redemption could Truly Come it kicked the can down the road it didn't pay the price of sin but it paid the the interest on sin and as it built up and built up and built up then after four thousand years Christ came amen and that's when the Plan of Redemption was truly set in motion was when Christ comes down the fullness of God in sinless flesh and he gives his life for us but that's when it starts but then there's a whole Plan of Redemption because he's got Abraham's Royal seed he still has to pull in he's got the natural Seed of Abraham but he's looking for a royal seed now he's got to fulfill the prophecy of there's another I'm going to make a people out of those that weren't to people that he was going to pull in once from all these different nations and whatnot so he's got to redeem everything back and he's got a roughly 2 000 years to do it right so he starts this big plan and we see that even though they were brought under a law we see grace interwoven all throughout that amen it's a beautiful thing because I've been reading and even sharing some of these these laws and there's some really crazy laws that he gave and it was always eye for eye tooth for tooth life for life and that's all the law could give you was that you could get your revenge but it never satisfied anything it never restored anything all it did was it made the other person pay the price that they made you pay and that's not where we want to go is it no it we come into the New Testament of Grace we come into the law of Christ and he says if they smoke you on this cheek then turn and give them the other one if they take your Coke give them your cloak if they force you to walk a mile then you walk too it's a completely different way of responding to the things that people do and say to us amen and then what happens is we come into this first church age and guess what we see yet another falling away don't we now the true church never Falls away God in every age has somebody that's faithful so we have that we have a second Adam comes in Christ The Perfect Adam and we'll get into this in much much more detail later not this service but we have a second Adam comes and he does his job perfectly and what's he doing he's calling out now with second Eve he's calling back the woman and what happens is she goes into the first age and most of them fall away remember we we mentioned this in the last service in Revelation 2. he says nevertheless he's talking to the first age the Ephesian Church age nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love what did Eve do left her first love he says you've done the exact same thing Eve did remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove that Candlestick out of his place except I'll repent everything that this message has brought us is tied back to this Redemption plan and we'll get into this in great depth as we go through this amen but we see it all the way from the tine-up of loose ends all the way to the Seven Seals in the opening of the book everything in between is redemption Redemption Redemption Amen to what bring us to the place where we recognize the Redeemer even amongst us working in our very midst his very presence amen but he says here in Revelation 2 he says remember from whence Thou Art fallen in other words remember where you used to be remember what you used to have remember what you used to do remember the blessings of God remember the presence of God remember the sweetness of staying in line with the word of God he says you used to have something and you've lost it and what happened is we had a Prophet come in this age and what did he do he reminded us that we'd lost something didn't he because I've been going on for 1950 years and the church had completely forgotten almost what they used to have they didn't know that there was healing they didn't know there was Deliverance they didn't know there were signs and wonders they didn't know you could walk a life that was worthy of the Gospel it had all Fallen away in an awful way and then this messenger comes and he says it's all available to us now because we're in the last time we're in the end times we're in the times of restoration in the fullness of times the fullness of redemption comes through as well for us amen and so we've got to go even Beyond them we're coming to a Redemption that even redeems these bodies that we're in amen that gives us glorified bodies in these different things so the message if nothing else reminded us of what the first church had because he did the exact same works not only of the Apostles he did the exact same works of Christ himself which is what the apostles were doing right so he reminded us that all of these things he reminded us of what he we had fallen away from so it's shelters the first church that has to remember where you've fallen from it so last church has to remember what everyone's falling back from so that we can remember it and do the first works as Paula said and we come into the lay to see in church age in Revelation 3 and it says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent what did the prophet do what was one of the very first things that He restored baptism in the name of Jesus Christ amen baptism in the name of Jesus Christ why because if you're going to do the first works you better do them right and the first works are what repent Acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so he comes in and he preaches what godhead he preaches water baptism and then he comes along and he preaches a message called the token and says you can do those right but until you get this then you're still not into the new birth you still don't have what's required you've got to come the way they did you've got to do the first works and you have to do them right otherwise you have no place in this Kingdom amen what was it he was laying out the first Works remember he says how can you teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural things if they won't do the first works then they're never going to step into the full Redemption that God has offered so we've got to do that you raised in the message doesn't matter you still got to do the first Works you've got to repent and you've got to be baptized the right way and you've got to receive the Holy Ghost and receiving the Holy Ghost is not receiving this message receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving the person of Christ in your life and he'll Quicken every bit of truth that's in this message to you after that amen I see a lot of Zeal today but I've said it before and the prophet says in the church age book he says the Zeal of the laodicean church is to repent man we have Zeal for the signs we have Zeal for the Wonders we have Zeal for the preaching of the word we have Zeal for the the worship and the praise and these different things we want leadership and we want guidance but how many of us want to repent because repent means to recognize that I'm not where I used to be not where I used to be yesterday but where I used to be in the beginning and what is it that's holding me back what is it that's keeping me from stepping back up into the place that Christ really has ordained for his bride to be in this age amen why what's the problem the laodicean condition resist repentance that's what he tells him to do it is because they're resistant to it it's not what comes naturally to them so for the bride of Christ I'm going to guarantee you that you're going to face resistance to repent because that's the spirit of the age is not to repent to believe that you're okay and this entire world is telling people you're okay the Way You Are everything there's doing and saying today is you're okay the way you are and you know what this message you know what this Bible says you're not good the way you are and you'll never make it the way you are and you must repent and you must be born again and that's the only way you're going to be good in the End Amen like I said I've been dwelling on some of these things that I know it sounds simple now but we get into the depth of it and some of it has just never jumped out until even the last few months but it's a beautiful thing because I believe as we go through this when you get into Redemption means then you'll see Deliverance you'll see healing you'll see the infilling of the Holy Spirit and then you'll see a a complete change in lives you'll see families change guess what it'll do it'll take pressure off of you because Redemption isn't about what you do it's about what the Redeemer does and it'll take pressure off you to be something that you can't be without him anyways right it'll reduce the stress in your life because you'll be looking to the promise and you'll be looking to the Redeemer that's fulfilling it not to you who has failed every time you've tried to do it in yourself amen so these are all things that I'm looking for amen where if we can let God go let ourselves go and let God have his way let him do the work in us then we'll see so such a greater effect in US amen but before we jump into those great things we have to understand where we were first if we understand where we were then we can understand what we're supposed to come back to and so we want to go back to in the beginning because that's our point of restoration our point of restoration is not time our point is in the beginning because that's where he's taken us back is to in the beginning to me and I want to start with this law of redemption that Moses wrote Because it's a that that's the foundation for all of this is it's God putting into words what this entire Plan of Redemption looks like and we look we're going to look in Deuteronomy 7 for this and we look here and it's amazing because in Deuteronomy 7 the children of God have not yet received the land they're going into the land of promise and God is already giving them a law of redemption which means that what God sees that they're going to lose it they're walking into a land of promise and God says I see failure ahead for the children of Israel before they've even received the land I'm putting a law in place so that when they mess up they'll have an opportunity to get their inheritance back to get back the land that I'm giving them amen so in Deuteronomy 7 verse 9 says know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations so God says the problem coming is not going to be me because I do what I say I do every single time and repaireth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command thee this day to do them wherefore it shall come to pass if you hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the Lord thy God shall keep the unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he swear unto thy fathers and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee God's laying out all the blessings available to them he says he will also bless the fruit of thy womb the fruit of thy land thy corn thy wine thine oil the increase of thine kind the flocks of thy sheep in the lamb which he swear unto thy fathers to give thee Thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be Faith male nor female Barren among you or among your cattle and the Lord will take away from the all the all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all that hate thee and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee this is sounding really good I wouldn't mind being under this Covenant if Thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than I how can I dispossess them look at your own life is there something you're facing saying this is way bigger than I am read this next verse he says Thou shalt not be afraid of them but Thou shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto pharaoh and unto all Egypt the great Temptations with China I saw and the signs and the Wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out so shall the Lord thy God do unto all of the people of whom Thou Art afraid moreover the Lord that God will send the Hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee to be destroyed Thou shalt not be afraided at them for the Lord thy God is among you a mighty God and terrible and the Lord thy God will put out those Nations before thee little by little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee and the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee and thou shalt shall destroy them with the mighty destruction until they be destroyed and he shall deliver their kings unto thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under Heaven there shall be no man be able to stand before thee until thou Hast destroyed them so he's laying out the promise he's laying out the prophecy of God for when they come into Canaan amen you read a promise like that and you got to go in with some confidence you got to believe you've just come out of Egypt you've just seen God take you out with a mighty hand he's LED you up to the Red Sea parted that with his mighty hand walked you through closed it up on the Egyptians the next day he's feeding you Angel's food on the ground and every day thereafter and then he gives you this and you say what could possibly go wrong what could possibly go wrong he is every need supplied and then he says when we get there he's going to push everybody out and nobody will be able to stand before us we'll have great families we'll have great flocks great herds great crops we'll have great homes we'll have no problems no issues no sickness nothing's going to come against us in that land but you go back to the beginning says if you keep my keep my Commandments if you took God at his word as an as an Israelite then you were set for life he said to a thousand Generations thousand Generations but the law of redemption is only required if something's going to be lost and before he ever gets there he gives them all of these promises and before he ever gives it he says you're going to fall before I ever give you this land he says I know you're going to fall Deuteronomy 31 says then the Lord said unto Moses behold Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whether they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my Covenant which I made with them then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and I will forsake them and I will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall fall shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evil come upon us because our God is not among us they blame it on God they don't say because we put God out from amongst us they say because God's left us and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it to the children of Israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel for when I shall have brought them into the lamb which I swear unto their fathers with that floweth with milk and honey and they have eaten and then and filled themselves and waxed some fat so he says when I've done everything I promise to do then they'll turn onto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my Covenant and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for I know their imagination which they go about even now before I have brought them into the land which I swear so this is Deuteronomy this is just before Joshua they're just about to go in the land and he's given them the promise then he said they're not going to stick with it they're never going to get the full benefit of it the great Jehovah Jireh though he looks he sees the problem and then he always makes a way he makes a promise they fall from the promise they fall into idolatry they fall away from God and yet he still always makes a way for them amen what are you saying because remember we'll go back to it in a moment Leviticus is where he gives the law of redemption Leviticus comes way before Deuteronomy Deuteronomy is the last thing before they go into the land and yet even before he even tells them they're going to fail he puts a law there of redemption so that there's a way for them to come back to what they need to have amen look at this Psalms 103. the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous and mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him for as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pityth them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remembers that we are dust God knows the Fallen condition if Adam and Eve couldn't hold it in the beginning he knows we're not going to hold it when we're out from under that perfect place right it's The Human Condition is to fail and yet it says he remembers we're just dust right we're not what we ought to be and so every time he makes a way he makes a away amen and so when hard times fell on them and hard times can only come to Israel when they fell away from God as long as they stay with him they were fine so he made a way for when those Hard Times came when they got themselves into trouble see Israel the land of Canaan was their possession and that's what they look for remember when even even Jesus was there and the disciples are coming talking to him they said when are you going to restore the kingdom for the land of Israel for the majority of Israelites all they wanted was the Kingdom of Israel they wanted the Throne of David restored right yes it would be under Messianic rule but they wanted the land it was always about the land for them because Abraham's promise was what I'll give thy seed a land I'm going to give them a land full of milk and honey and these different things but as I pointed out earlier Abraham's Royal seed it was I am thy great portion I am thy great Shield I'm going to give you me but he says your people now your natural seed they're going to get a land and so everything about them was for the land and so God brings them into a land of promise and he says you're going to have problems here so he says I'm going to give you a law that'll let you get your land back even after you lose it he put something in there amen and the amazing thing is because in it for Israel because it's about the land guess what everybody's fighting over over there the land right nobody's looking for anything else listen I've never been to Israel but I've seen pictures it might have been Lush back then I don't know but today it really ain't Lush the the Jews have done an amazing job with it they've got the best water technology in the world everyone if they want to know how to do the best you can with water they go to the they go to the Jews they go to Israel for it they've turned a desert into a relative Oasis but it's still a desert today and yet everybody's fighting for it it's got minimal oil as far as they know minimal oil and gas these different things it can grow certain things but it's still not that great today and yet everybody's wanting to destroy it why because that is their inheritance what's Satan trying to do today he's trying to destroy our inheritance he's trying to destroy a land he's trying to keep us off the things that God has given us amen so we see the natural in Israel and then we see the spiritual in the bride and the chosen Church of Christ amen so we want to look at this law of redemption this is Leviticus 25. and he says the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine in other words you can't give away what isn't your stone in the first place he says the land is mine he says I'm letting you be caretakers for it yes you're going to have titles and you're going to have Deeds but I own I own the title deed to everything I'm giving you so he says you can't give it away forever it's not up to you you're not allowed to sign away your land see today if I wanted to sell my house when I sell my house I sell it forever but he said in Israel you're not allowed to sell it away he says there's a time limit to how far you're allow how long you're allowed to be away from your inheritance and it was the Jubilee year right it was every 50th year he says what your managers he says you're strangers and sojourners with me so in other words this is not a place where you're supposed to get super comfortable even though it's a land for you yet your pilgrims and strangers as we see in other places of the scripture right every member of every tribe of Israel was given except for a couple we know but you know what I mean the ones that received it everybody got a piece of land he says that peace is yours forever we're setting types now each and every one of us has something that's given to us we're given a piece of the Lamb we're giving a piece of the world we're giving a peace of God whatever type you want to take however you want to talk about it he says you can't give away what's yours what's given to you it's only for you to sit on it and you can give it to somebody else and let them try and work it and they may get the benefit out of it but the benefit is meant for you not for them only you are supposed to have this thing indefinitely right what is it God owns the title of deed and he gives men the right to hold it on their own but it still belongs to him and we see that and and just in a looking forward and got and when they fell in the Garden of Eden brother Brown says what Adam held the title D and then he lost it and so what did it do went back to God and we see the the the exact type right here God says listen you might have it but it really belongs to me you're just caretakers in the land that I've given you he says in in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for land so in other words there's no land that's exempt from redemption in Israel put it to your own life there's nothing in the bride of Christ that is exempt from Redemption do you know what that means today everything that is under that Redemptive Covenant belongs to us nothing's exempt your family's not exempt your job's not exempt your finances aren't exempt your walk with Christ certainly isn't exempt your church is an exempt the ministry is an exempt nothing here is exempt from the law of redemption everything can be restored by the law of redemption it's what he's saying here amen If thy brother be wax and poor and has sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold how does a man lose under a law of prosperity because he'd given him a law of prosperity he said if you follow my Commandments he says you're going to have everything you'll ever need and then some so how do you lose it what happens he gets away from serving God he gets away from the word and the law of God that's how he loses it so a brother doesn't wax poor because God's blessing him he whacks his poor because he stepped away from the things of God right and we say brother because the men held the titles in but let's talk about people the only way you get poor in the eyes of God is when you step away from the things of God right you're not poor because God makes you poor you're poor because you step away from the things that he's offered amen so the only way that you can get away from the things of God the goodness of God is if you get away from God himself that was the thing if you kept his Commandments you kept your land and all the blessings that came with it you stepped away from God and everything started to go to pieces when things start to go to Pieces sometimes we need to check up and say did I step away from God right who can get you out says under the law of redemption he says your brother or your close family can get you back you need a near Kinsmen you need somebody that's closely related to you to do this work it's not just a stranger a stranger can't walk up and redeem you it had to be a close King had to be somebody in relation to you amen what does he do let's say I fell I fall and I sell my home who's the only one that can redeem it in my family my brother Nathan right so who pays the price Nathan who gets to land me what kind of a person is going to sign on to that deal when you look at what it costs to buy a home today three four hundred thousand dollars why would anybody ever spend that kind of money on a person that keeps failing and failing and failing and deserves to be right where they are what kind of a character do you have to have to be a redeemer to put your money on the actions of somebody that got where they did by their poor actions where in all probability by human nature in the next five to ten years they're going to be right where they were in the beginning and you'll have lost your three to four hundred grand they'll have sold the house again taken and squandered the benefit of it and you paid the price and then they have they've just walked away from it as if it was nothing redeemers are special people even in those days redeemers were special people and we see it in the story of Ruth remember the the nearer Kinsman says I can't do it otherwise I'm going to ruin my own inheritance I'm going to put too much risk I'm going to take too much away from what I have and therefore I refuse to redeem it but Boaz was willing to do it amen the redeem gets the property the benefit the restoration and the other person pays the price you've got to value that person a whole lot to put that kind of money down when I start talking three or four hundred thousand dollars that's what we're talking about Redemption that's what it would look like in the natural for us today what is it He Paid a Debt he did not owe I owed a dad I could not pay I needed somebody to wash my sins away right and now I'm singing a brand new song because he paid a price and the question is what are we going to do with it what are we going to do with it amen take someone that believes you're going to stay the course because guess what if Nathan doesn't believe that I'm going to change my ways then he ain't going to redeem me is he no matter how much he might love me he's not going to redeem me if it's just going to be a waste of his money and his time and effort right he's got to have a faith that I'm going to do the right thing this time verse 26 says if a man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the over plus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return to his next possession return unto his possession so this is relating to the law of Jubilee man the Jubilee year was every 50 years so what happened is if you got into hard times then you'd sell your property and what they do is they count how many years were left until the Year of Jubilee because at the Year of Jubilee everything came back everything came back no matter what no matter how good or bad you were on the 50th year then you got everything back that was yours from from the original disbursement they had in the beginning so he says if you get the money back if by somehow you get the money to redeem your property says you go and you got to pay that guy the portion of the years that are left so if I get if I sold my land in the 40th year and there's 10 years left and that man uses it for two years and then I come back and I say I've got the money to pay you back I've got to pay him back 80 percent of what he gave me because he lost 80 percent of the time left the remaining eight years so he says you can do it yourself or you can come up with the money but how many people can come up with the money when they've lost everything they own what's the possibility of it happening about zero maybe you're lucked into it maybe you're stumbling through the desert ready to die and you fell into a gold you know a gold mine or something like that but generally speaking you can't redeem yourself because you've lost everything it takes to to produce any sort of money in your life amen it says in verse 28 but if he not be able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that have bought it unto the Year of Jubilee and in the Jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession so at the 50th year no matter what you get your property back and any improvements that were done to it you didn't get the animals and all those things that was his but the property itself the land and any improvements he'd done to it it all came back to you in the 50th year listen God always makes a way that's what the Jubilee is because when man can't do it yet God always sets a time where he does it for you amen the Jubilee man no matter if you were good bad and different if you're walking with God not walking with God he always gives you a chance to come back and step back under the blessing of God to come back to your original inheritance amen what is it God was offering you a chance to make a change because listen when it comes to the year Jubilee if you hadn't gotten it back and your family hadn't gotten it back then what was he doing God had given you a chance to see what your leadership looked like the benefits of living under your life your way of thinking or the influence of another as it may be if you didn't have your land when the land of Jubilee came that was a time to reflect and say how did I get here and what am I going to change because now I'm getting it all back and last time I had it all I wasted it how did I waste it who was I listening to what was I doing that caused me to lose it because I'm going to lose it again if I don't if I don't change the way that I'm doing things amen and it was every 50 years and guess what he said you get 70. so everybody got a chance in their lifetime that's Grace Jubilee is Grace he says that you could go free no matter what you were in whether you're in slavery in bondage your family yourself it didn't matter everything got to go free if you chose to on the Year of Jubilee and that's the grace that he built in even to this what's he saying God offers all of us a chance scripture says that God is not willing that any should perish right second Peter 3 9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance the first works what so they can step back into the plan of God and the will of God under the alignment and authority of the word of God and that's where the blessings are going to come out amen listen God's Redemption is meant for his children because he's coming to redeem abroad he's not coming to redeem everybody but he's coming to redeem a bride but he still offers a piece of the pie to everybody that is for whosoever will John 3 16 is for everyone they'll get eternal life but they won't be in the city but he still offers them a chance to come back to take the opportunity to take the Jubilee and go free not the way that the bride goes free but yet they could still have it they still had the opportunity amen and they receive it by what free moral agency listen we think we have choices the bride of Christ we don't because we're predestinated to it we're for Destiny to it he's got he won't lose any when he says he won't lose any that means that we aren't we it's not reliant on us it can't be because we lose every single time and we see it time and time to the scripture the greatest of men the greatest of women they still fail time and time again so it's not by our choice it's by his choosing and his predestination and it's his power but this is the grace of God embedded into the uh into the law that was there God always offers a reset God offers that one time get out of jail card and you know what sometimes I get out of jail card is me and you that's what people are seeing is they're seeing Christ they're seeing to get out of jail card they're seeing the Jubilee in you and they get to choose do I take it or do I turn it down so often we're looking to something outside of us but sometimes where they get out of jail card that people are looking for to take them out of where they are into something that God has at so much greater amen what is it the purpose of the reset was not to give them their land the purpose of the reset was to get them back into communion with God to get them back to where he could bless them the land wasn't the blessing God was the blessing the land was under his benefit then amen you're looking to get back to him and then he would bless the land but if you focused on all you focused on was the land then God was going to go by the wayside each and every time amen so the question is would you go with what you had in your own leadership and your own guidance would you come back and submit yourself and say Lord I'm going to come back under the preaching of the word I'm going to come back under the law because that's where the blessing really is God's Jubilee was a chance to say I messed up I'm going to take the opportunity not to come back to my land to come back to him amen you can't be in the promise and be out of your inheritance it's that simple you can't be doing the things of God and be out of your inheritance because that's what He blesses you with is within your inheritance that's where he wants you to be is in your inheritance so if you're not seeing the blessings of God by the word then you're in a problem you've got an issue because he always blesses you when you're where you're supposed to be in your inheritance amen we get our inheritance back but the grace is not there to give us the land it's to give us him again it's to bring us back to the place where he can bless us amen sometimes we think it's all about us that he does these things that he gives us these things because of who we are but he gives them to us because of who he is and we're the benefactor for it amen because remember our righteousness is as filthy rags right there's nothing good we can say or do to deserve this in fact he tells them this Deuteronomy 9 he says Hear o Israel Thou Art to pass over Jordan this day to go to possess Nations greater and mightier than thyself think of it as a good person there are gooder people there are mightier people in their flesh than many of us believers if you were to compare us before we got saved to them what they are now many of them were better than us I can say it there's people that are better than you is what he's saying cities greed and fenced up to heaven a people great and Tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou has hurt say who can stand before the children of anak understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goeth before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out it's hilarious he says it's going to go before your face and you're going to drive them out in everything we read before that was what he did wasn't them doing it he says I'm gonna do it and they're going to fall before your face and you're going to drive them out his work but it looks like it's happening by us let's not get too caught up in ourselves he says and Destroy them quickly as the Lord has said unto thee speak not thou in thine art after that the Lord thy God had cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land he says and for the but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord to drive them out from before thee not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart thus thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord thy God to drive them out from before thee and that he may perform the word which the Lord swear unto thy fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob notice now because the world looks at this and they say God's in there and he says kill the women and the children not just the men and what kind of a righteous God could do that and he says here I did it because of their wickedness they were killing their own children was that what they were doing and the cup of the amorites was full he says this is the time now to pay back what they've been doing all these hundreds of years right so he's going in there but he says I'm giving you the land but I'm judging them and I'm giving you them their land because they're under judgment not because you're so perfect not because you're so great not because you have a heart after God's Own Heart he said so don't get lifted up in yourself with these things he says this is by election not because you're good you might say well I wasn't one of those people brother John I didn't test him in the wilderness I didn't cause him you know who we were we were the ones they were driving out that's our heritage we were Canaanites we were Gentiles we are out the scripture says we are aliens from God so no matter how good we think we are unless we had the grace of God we'd be the ones that were being driven out before the Israelites time and time and time again amen he says understand therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art has stiff-necked people I Can Be Stiff necks sometimes amen sometimes Pride takes hold sometimes I think it's me that's doing things we blend just into these scriptures just fine at times we've got our own place of stiff neckedness our own place of uh of Pride our own place of refusal to bow down our own what is it sometimes refusing to acknowledge that we can't even do it that's the pride that kills us the most is when we think it's on our basis that I've got the strength I've got the discipline I've got the goods I've got the background I've got the family I've got the ministry whatever it is and we take him out of the picture completely it makes us stiff-necked and he's got to break us down so that we realize that it's him and us that does all of these things amen remember and forget not how thou provokes the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst apart out of the land of Egypt until you came into this place ye have been rebellious against the Lord also in horribly provoke the Lord to wrath so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you I hope we're not there I don't believe we are I believe under this Grace this is not the place that we want to be found amen because God's speaking to a mixed multitude they're about to go into Israel now that's about he's speaking to what happened with a mixed multitude if I can put it that way because remember they're going into into Jordan and it's supposed to be only the best of the best going in but yet it's still a mixed multitude because we see Aiken going in there and we see the different ones that mess up not too long after it amen but he's speaking to a people that what couldn't do it couldn't stay in the law even in the wilderness even without the influence of the of the the outside tribes and these different things even with the pillar of fire in their midst every night and the cloud by day they couldn't do it even with the Manna From God they couldn't do it because it wasn't in them to do it wasn't in them to do it it's Grace that it's in us to do it it's Grace that it's in us to do it amen that we can recognize the pillar of fire amen that we can feed on the word that he's given to us and that we can submit ourselves to it and let it have a working in our life and not get caught up in Pride because we think that it's something we're doing in ourselves amen what is the law of Redemption all about it's reminding us we do have a land we do have an inheritance we do have a place that's just for us and nobody else is supposed to take that place remember we read in that that last service I believe or the one before where brother Brown said nobody can take your place what does it mean to be in the body of Christ it means to get to your piece of land to get to your inheritance to get to your position and get connected into that body so that when everybody's in their place now the body can stand up with power and authority because the head comes down and the body is United together everyone in their position and God can start to work in them amen amen let's just stand together if we would the thing about the law of redemption is that it's not just about the land the the land was always to bring them back to what the god that gave them the land in the first place and we'll see that that's what this Redemption is about as we move through these things is that it's not just about the gifts it's not about the healing it's not about the Deliverance it's not about the good things of God only but it's about the person of God himself amen it's bringing us back into relationship and that's what we're going to touch in as we go into the next service amen you notice here he didn't promise that it wasn't going to be hard and say we wouldn't face opposition didn't say that we wouldn't have to labor didn't say that there wouldn't be influences out there trying to get in that we wouldn't have to keep our eyes peeled you know that we wouldn't have to set a guard about our homes but he says if you'll stay with my Commandments he says if you'll stay with what I've told you to do he says not a single one of them will conquer you no one will overcome no sickness nothing he said death can't come your way if you'll just stay with what I've told you to do amen let's bow our heads here Heavenly Father Lord we see so much interwoven in the in your word this morning Lord amen Lord we see mercy and Grace Lord we see judgment as well Lord and smack dab in the middle of it is an unworthy people Lord that can't do a thing about it without your grace in our lives Lord without the life of the Holy Spirit within us Lord we don't have a hope but Lord you've given us a spirit that makes us cry Abba Father Lord to reach out to you Lord to reach out to the one that has all the money all the authority all the power Lord that can do anything Lord that can do anything even that changes from a stiff-neck people Lord into fleshly tables of Hearts wherewith your word can be written in our lives Lord God Lord as we get into this series on Redemption Lord may you Quicken yourselves to us Lord may we see what you have Lord set aside for each and every one of us Lord and may we not just come back for the landlord but may we come back to you Lord for you are our great and exceeding portion that we seek Lord God lord you bless us now we pray in Jesus
