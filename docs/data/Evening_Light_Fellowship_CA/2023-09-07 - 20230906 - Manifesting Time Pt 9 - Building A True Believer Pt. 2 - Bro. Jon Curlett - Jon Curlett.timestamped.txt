[48:56] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and
[48:59] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[49:01] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[49:03] according as his divine power ha given
[49:06] unto us all things that pertain unto
[49:08] life and godliness through the knowledge
[49:10] of him that ha called us to glory and
[49:12] virtue whereby are given unto us
[49:14] exceeding great and precious promises
[49:17] that by these ye might be partakers of
[49:19] the divine nature having escaped the
[49:22] corruption that is in the world through
[49:23] lust and besides this giving all
[49:26] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[49:29] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[49:31] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[49:33] and to patience godliness and to
[49:35] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[49:37] brotherly kindness charity now listen to
[49:40] this verse 8 says for if these things be
[49:42] in you and abound amen there's a bounty
[49:46] there's an abounding that comes with
[49:48] this work he says they make you that you
[49:50] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[49:53] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[49:55] Christ Christ but he that lackthe things
[49:57] is blind and cannot see a far off and
[50:00] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[50:02] his old sins wherefore the rather
[50:04] Brethren give diligence to make your
[50:06] calling and election sure for if you do
[50:09] these things you shall never fall if I
[50:12] can paraphrase that he's saying this
[50:14] process works it cannot be undone and
[50:17] you will be victorious amen God bless
[50:20] you you can take your seats this evening
[50:22] God bless the reading of his word and
[50:23] we're continuing our series on
[50:24] manifesting time and I want to take a a
[50:26] second service on this idea of building
[50:28] a True Believer and we're still about to
[50:31] dive into this this message and this
[50:33] thought on Statue of a perfect man but I
[50:35] want to take this service and I just
[50:36] want to teach a little bit here and
[50:37] settle us in a bit because before we
[50:39] start going into this idea of the
[50:41] stature of a perfect man what I don't
[50:42] want is you to sit there and think I've
[50:44] got a checklist and I'm going to go
[50:46] through my life and I'm going to check
[50:47] all these things off and until I check
[50:49] it off then I can't get the Holy Ghost
[50:52] I'm not saying that's not true but I'm
[50:53] saying that it's not your checklist it's
[50:54] God's checklist list and he's the one
[50:56] that decides it's not you that decides
[50:58] amen but I don't want you to get into a
[51:00] performance-based
[51:01] Christianity or to think that somehow
[51:03] you've got to wait for something it's
[51:04] all in God's hands and God's going to be
[51:06] the one that decides these things but I
[51:08] what I definitely don't want to do is
[51:09] complicate this because when we're
[51:11] talking statue of a perfect man the
[51:13] thing that comes as the end is Charity
[51:14] which is God's love itself which is the
[51:16] Holy Ghost and so this this whole series
[51:19] on on building a True Believer the
[51:20] stature of a perfect man could really be
[51:22] entitled how to get the Holy Ghost cuz
[51:24] brother r said he remember remember he
[51:26] said in that quote he said this is the
[51:28] the Plan of Salvation this is how to
[51:30] become the dwelling place of God so
[51:32] really the statue of a perfect man is
[51:33] how you get the Holy Ghost but it's it's
[51:35] really a a broaden version of it it's
[51:38] really getting into maybe the
[51:39] nitty-gritty details of all of these
[51:41] things and so Peter here is just giving
[51:42] us half a chapter of instruction on how
[51:45] to get the Holy Ghost how to become the
[51:47] dwelling place of God and that's really
[51:48] the question we have to have it's the
[51:50] most important question you'll ever ask
[51:51] yourself how do I get the Holy Ghost and
[51:54] after that it's do I have the the Holy
[51:55] Ghost but if you don't know how to get
[51:57] it then you probably don't have it amen
[51:59] but we want to go through these things
[52:01] but remember I like I said I want I
[52:03] don't want this to be complicated and if
[52:05] we go back to what Jesus said he said
[52:06] the new birth comes by two things water
[52:08] and spirit water and spirit and so the
[52:11] simple fact is this if you will hear the
[52:12] word if you will accept the word and you
[52:15] will obey the word you'll get the Holy
[52:17] Ghost and that's as simple I think as we
[52:20] can make it and that's all Jesus said it
[52:21] comes by water and it comes by spirit
[52:23] and then on the day of Pentecost Peter
[52:25] said what he gave them the word they
[52:27] accepted the word they acted on the word
[52:29] they got the Holy Ghost and so I don't
[52:30] want to make this into some big kafuffle
[52:32] here I don't want to make it into this
[52:34] this big ordeal but but Peter's giving
[52:36] us some details in these things a and
[52:38] the prophet comes behind and maybe
[52:39] expands it even more than Peter did to
[52:42] show you this is the process that a
[52:43] child of God goes through before they
[52:45] get the Holy Ghost before they're really
[52:47] pulled into the kingdom of God Amen and
[52:49] so you can't just take a portion you
[52:52] can't take a portion of the word at any
[52:53] time but you got to take the full word
[52:54] to get the the full result I me you
[52:56] can't pick and choose and that's where
[52:58] we see Christianity Today socalled is
[53:00] that people are picking and choosing the
[53:01] portion of the word that they want and
[53:03] guess what if you take a portion of the
[53:04] word you only get a portion of the
[53:05] results and we can't get out of here
[53:07] with a portion we've got to have a full
[53:09] portion amen we've got to have an
[53:10] overflowing portion which is the word
[53:12] dwelling within us and producing himself
[53:14] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:16] brother Bron would say this in the
[53:17] message of paradox and I want you
[53:19] remember I said last service I had 36
[53:21] pages of notes 35 pages of notes and
[53:23] only two pages come from statue of a
[53:25] perfect man and that's because I want to
[53:27] show you out of the mouth of two or
[53:28] three Witnesses I don't just want to
[53:30] preach out of a single message but I
[53:31] want to preach across the depth of the
[53:33] message to show you that brother
[53:34] brandham is emphatic in the points that
[53:36] I'm about to make and and the things
[53:38] that I'm trying to Anchor in this
[53:39] evening he says this in the message of
[53:41] paradox he says I believe that every
[53:43] Born Again member of the body of Christ
[53:45] is a paradox in themselves he says
[53:48] because something happened to you that
[53:50] changed your whole being and anyone
[53:53] could look at that and know what a par
[53:55] Parx is a miracle he says unless that
[53:59] happens you cannot be a Christian now
[54:02] let me say this when you're born in the
[54:04] message there's still got to come A
[54:05] change when you get a new birth there
[54:08] has to come a new change because you're
[54:09] still a child of Disobedience and we'll
[54:11] talk about this in a bit you're still
[54:13] under the nature of a child of Wrath and
[54:15] so there has to be a change and no
[54:17] matter how good you are how obedient you
[54:19] are to your parents how Faithfully you
[54:21] attend church whatever it is there has
[54:23] to be a change when you truly become a
[54:24] Christian when you truly get the new
[54:26] birth because you can't be what you were
[54:28] you can't be what you were he says cuz
[54:31] no one can change a spirit in a man and
[54:33] give him a new birth outside of God you
[54:36] can get a spirit in you Satan's trying
[54:38] to put many spirits inside of you but he
[54:40] says nobody can give you a new birth
[54:42] except it's God and give you a new
[54:43] spirit he said cuz God Alone is the only
[54:45] one can do it and it's a miracle how
[54:48] that God can take a man's thinking his
[54:51] ways his life and everything and change
[54:54] it from what it was to what it can be
[54:58] what he can make it so every one of us
[55:00] is supposed to be a paradox it's
[55:01] supposed to be a miracle where people
[55:03] say she used to be this and now she's
[55:05] that and how did it happen it seemed
[55:07] like almost overnight it happened and
[55:09] she used to be this and now she's that
[55:10] or he was this and now he acts that way
[55:12] and what he used to do he doesn't do and
[55:13] what he didn't used to do now he does it
[55:16] what is it it's a paradox it's a it's a
[55:18] complete miracle and so as we go through
[55:20] this I'm going to take a page from
[55:21] brother Mark's uh you know way of doing
[55:24] things and I'm going to draw
[55:26] diagram and I want to draw a diagram
[55:28] because I want you to see how everything
[55:29] fits in so don't worry about catching
[55:31] everything that's here CU we're going to
[55:32] go stage by stage tonight I'm just going
[55:33] to take my time and teach this as we go
[55:35] through it but but I want you to notice
[55:37] some things on this graph as we go and
[55:39] so the first thing you have is this main
[55:41] line going through the middle and it's
[55:42] red at the start and then it goes into
[55:44] green and this is this is your your life
[55:46] and it represents time but as we look at
[55:49] this you'll see that most of those
[55:50] segments I've drawn are roughly equal I
[55:52] had to fit it within the page so some of
[55:53] them are a bit shorter but but I don't
[55:55] want you to think that the length of
[55:57] time for all of these periods of your
[55:58] life are exactly the same the length of
[56:00] the line is irrelevant in terms of the
[56:02] graph some of us are children of
[56:04] Disobedience until we're 35 40 50 60 70
[56:06] remember that woman brother brandham led
[56:08] to the Lord at 92 her her her graph of
[56:11] this would be a straight line of a child
[56:12] of Disobedience and then she basically
[56:14] went straight up into
[56:15] heaven God can do it God's Sovereign and
[56:17] that's why I don't want to complicate
[56:19] this I don't want to draw this into some
[56:21] big you know massive process and you
[56:23] think You' just got to spend 18 years or
[56:25] 25 years or 30 years before you get the
[56:27] Holy Ghost no that's not the way it is
[56:29] at all but you'll understand here that
[56:31] the length of the line is irrelevant in
[56:32] each of these portions that's going to
[56:34] be in some cases up to you and in some
[56:36] cases it's going to be up to God but
[56:38] some people are that as soon as they
[56:39] hear the word they hear it and they're
[56:41] convicted and they obey it and they
[56:42] accept it and they apply it and then
[56:44] they go and and and very quickly they'll
[56:46] get the Holy Ghost and very soon after
[56:47] that God places them and they're adopted
[56:50] Sons and Daughters of God and some of us
[56:52] are more prideful or or we don't learn
[56:54] lessons very well or we like pain or
[56:56] whatever it is we got something that we
[56:58] just like too much about this world and
[56:59] so we're dragged out in some of these
[57:01] and it takes us a long time but usually
[57:03] what happens is we finally learn the
[57:04] lesson then we move quickly into the
[57:05] next portion and then hopefully we've
[57:07] learned that lesson and so the next bits
[57:09] go a little bit quicker as we go along
[57:11] but what we have now on this graph now
[57:13] this is the graph of your life and above
[57:14] it I've put all the events or actions
[57:17] and these are key things that happen or
[57:19] are done in your life some of them are
[57:22] based on you and some of them are based
[57:23] on God so the line is what's happening
[57:26] and then if you look below that you get
[57:28] the results and that's the the effect of
[57:30] what you did above the line so you see
[57:32] there we have things like conviction
[57:33] dying out getting filled with the Holy
[57:35] Ghost adoption Rapture these different
[57:36] things those are events but the effect
[57:38] of those events is what follows in the
[57:40] line that comes after it and that's
[57:41] what's shown underneath it and then I
[57:43] have blue dots here and these are the
[57:45] pivotal moments these are these are
[57:46] Junctions in time brother Brandon would
[57:48] talk about these are conferences with
[57:50] God where you've got to make a decision
[57:52] you've got to make a decision many times
[57:54] and and based on your decision then God
[57:56] acts on it okay so that's what what
[57:59] we're looking at as we go through here
[58:01] okay so so if you look at these blue
[58:03] dots if you don't do what God wants you
[58:04] to do then what happens is you go around
[58:06] the mountain one more time you go around
[58:07] the desert one more time and he comes
[58:09] back and he lets you make that choice
[58:11] again and if you don't make it he sends
[58:12] you around the desert one more time
[58:13] until you get sick and tired of walking
[58:15] around the desert and then you do what
[58:17] he finally wants you to do and they says
[58:19] praise the Lord you say praise the Lord
[58:21] I finally figured it out and you move on
[58:22] into the next stage of your Christian
[58:24] walk but brother man would say this he
[58:26] said Lily he said consider it how it
[58:28] grows toils has to bring itself up this
[58:31] Little Pond Lily look where it come
[58:33] through dirt mck mud Muddy Waters and
[58:38] dirty Waters don't worry where you come
[58:41] from worry where you get worry where you
[58:44] get cuz that's all that really matters
[58:46] he says it pressed its way through all
[58:48] of those all of that this little germ of
[58:50] Life working itself from the bottom of
[58:52] the pond where the frogs and things are
[58:54] at and and then brings itself up through
[58:56] all of that but when it gets in the
[58:58] presence of the sun it's born that
[59:01] little sea bursts open into life it
[59:03] cannot do that until it goes through all
[59:06] that process it's got to come through
[59:09] that that's what makes it is because the
[59:12] sun itself is what's drawing it what is
[59:14] it he's talking about what the presence
[59:16] of the sun it's the atmosphere it's the
[59:17] drawing of the Holy Spirit that's
[59:19] pulling that life out of you and
[59:21] bringing you up to where you can truly
[59:22] live he says and when it gets fully
[59:25] above all the dirty Waters and muck and
[59:27] so forth then it's so happy it just
[59:30] gives its life out freely and it's a
[59:33] beautiful type when it when it gets in
[59:35] the presence of that which is drawing it
[59:37] up he says I think that's a beautiful
[59:39] type of Christian Life when something is
[59:41] drawing you out of the world until one
[59:44] day you're born right into its Presence
[59:46] by the Holy Spirit he says how beautiful
[59:49] but he says if you try to help it you
[59:51] kill it in other words he says the
[59:53] process has a purpose so don't try and
[59:55] shortcut it don't try and go around it
[59:57] don't try and but just go right through
[59:59] it just stick right through it so if we
[1:00:01] go back to this this this graph and this
[1:00:03] is how to get the Holy Ghost this is how
[1:00:04] to become the dwelling place of God this
[1:00:06] is is is what the new birth looks like
[1:00:08] and and what it does when you get it so
[1:00:10] on the lower left here we stop and we
[1:00:13] look here and we see we're we're
[1:00:14] children of Disobedience our our nature
[1:00:16] our attitude our mind our thoughts our
[1:00:19] flesh everything is contrary to God and
[1:00:21] Ephesians 2 says this wherein in times
[1:00:23] past ye walk according to the curse of
[1:00:25] this world according to the prince of
[1:00:27] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:00:30] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:00:32] that was our spirit Ephesians is our
[1:00:34] book Ephesians is our book so we are
[1:00:37] under the nature of the children of
[1:00:39] Disobedience it says among whom also we
[1:00:41] had our conversation our life in Times
[1:00:43] past and the lusts of our flesh
[1:00:45] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[1:00:47] of the mind and were by Nature the
[1:00:49] children of Wrath even as others so
[1:00:53] that's our starting place and I I don't
[1:00:54] care if you're born in a message home or
[1:00:56] if you're born to a drug dealing parent
[1:00:57] out on the street you are a child of
[1:01:00] Wrath a child of Disobedience every
[1:01:02] single one of us in your human nature in
[1:01:04] your human nature okay doesn't matter
[1:01:06] how good you look that's where you are
[1:01:08] but what happens now we see above it we
[1:01:10] see an event or an action what is it
[1:01:12] it's God rich in Mercy comes and he
[1:01:14] sends his word to us that's the only
[1:01:17] thing that God has that he can do is he
[1:01:19] can send his word to you because the
[1:01:21] scripture says he sent his word and he
[1:01:22] healed all our diseases the word does
[1:01:24] the work that's required in our lives
[1:01:27] amen and it does two things to a person
[1:01:29] it either convicts them or it condemns
[1:01:31] them now we're talking to Children Of
[1:01:34] God here tonight so for us we have this
[1:01:36] pivotal moment number one and what is it
[1:01:38] it's conviction because we're convicted
[1:01:40] by the word not condemned we hear it and
[1:01:43] what it does is we hear it and we hear
[1:01:45] the remedy not just the con condemnation
[1:01:47] in it but we say there's a way out of
[1:01:49] where I am and so what happens is that
[1:01:51] conviction leads us to do the right
[1:01:53] thing remember in
[1:01:54] chapter 2 when the Peter comes down and
[1:01:56] he starts preaching to the people there
[1:01:58] it says they were pricked in their
[1:02:00] hearts they were
[1:02:01] convicted and they said what do we do
[1:02:03] about this conviction cuz condemnation
[1:02:06] you'll just walk away conviction keeps
[1:02:08] you there and says how do I fix it and
[1:02:10] so they said what did we have to do and
[1:02:12] he says repent and be baptized for the
[1:02:14] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:02:16] the gift of the Holy Ghost and what
[1:02:19] happened is as soon as they hear that
[1:02:21] they repent they changed their ways they
[1:02:23] obey the word word and they're baptized
[1:02:26] and all of a sudden there's no more
[1:02:27] condemnation they don't have to worry
[1:02:29] about it it's all washed away brother BR
[1:02:31] would say this he says first repent of
[1:02:33] your sins your unbelief that you've
[1:02:35] disbelieved these things notice what he
[1:02:38] says your unbelief that you disbelieved
[1:02:39] these things that it was here all along
[1:02:40] and you didn't believe it you got to
[1:02:42] repent for that he says repent and then
[1:02:45] be baptized and then the guide will take
[1:02:47] you from there on see that's your duty
[1:02:50] now listen to this CU I want you to see
[1:02:51] you've got a duty and then God's got a
[1:02:53] duty he says it's your duty to repent
[1:02:57] it's your duty to be baptized but after
[1:03:00] this he says then it's the God's duty to
[1:03:02] take you from there on lead you from
[1:03:05] virtue to knowledge to Temperance to
[1:03:07] patience to Godliness to brotherly love
[1:03:09] and the Holy Ghost seals you see he says
[1:03:12] then you're a full stature of God a real
[1:03:14] man of God a real woman of God anchored
[1:03:16] away in Christ so you repent you're
[1:03:19] baptized and what happens is is what you
[1:03:21] receive the word you accept the word
[1:03:23] rather and what happens there is that
[1:03:26] you accept the finished work of Calvary
[1:03:28] and in doing so you're baptized you die
[1:03:31] to your old nature and then what happens
[1:03:33] is you get a new a new heart and a new
[1:03:35] spirit and that inclines you now towards
[1:03:38] the things of God Amen Jesus said if you
[1:03:40] go this far you're saved you have
[1:03:42] eternal life he that believeth on me
[1:03:44] he's saved and brother BR would say it
[1:03:46] over and over again it's what Jesus said
[1:03:48] doesn't mean you're a part of the Bride
[1:03:49] like I've said doesn't mean you're part
[1:03:51] of the elect but you accept the finished
[1:03:52] work of Calvary you go this far and
[1:03:55] you've got eternal life now you may have
[1:03:57] to go through a tribulation but you have
[1:03:59] eternal life we'll see you on the other
[1:04:00] side one way or the other why because
[1:04:02] you've accepted the finished work of
[1:04:04] Calvary and you've had faith in the work
[1:04:05] that he did there and you've acted upon
[1:04:07] it but now you do that and you've got a
[1:04:10] new heart and a new spirit you're saved
[1:04:12] if we could put it that way and you come
[1:04:13] to this pivotal moment number two and
[1:04:15] this is the biggest thing you'll ever do
[1:04:16] in your life church this entire series
[1:04:20] of of the Statue of a perfect man or
[1:04:22] this thought is tied to this next thing
[1:04:26] and it's that you die
[1:04:28] out and this is the hardest part of your
[1:04:31] Christian walk that you'll ever face is
[1:04:34] dying out because once you've accepted
[1:04:37] the finished work of Calvary and he
[1:04:38] gives you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:04:40] now there's got to come A Change you've
[1:04:42] turned around you're facing another way
[1:04:44] but you got to keep walking in that way
[1:04:46] you got to take the word and you've got
[1:04:48] to apply the word and you've got to let
[1:04:50] it have an effect in your life and that
[1:04:51] means you've got to die out and you'll
[1:04:53] see that as we go through this series
[1:04:55] that every single virtue that he talks
[1:04:57] about in terms of the Statue of a
[1:04:59] perfect man is tied to how much you will
[1:05:01] die out every single one of these things
[1:05:03] just comes back to this point everything
[1:05:05] comes back to dying out brother B would
[1:05:08] say it this way he says I'll say today
[1:05:10] if man will dump out all this nonsense
[1:05:13] of carrying on and impersonating
[1:05:15] Christianity and let the Holy Ghost take
[1:05:17] its place then there will be a Revival
[1:05:19] start on eth and Penn Street that will
[1:05:21] sweep the whole country he says quit the
[1:05:23] non sense get back to the word of God
[1:05:27] now listen to what he says here dump out
[1:05:29] that you might fill up you let go and
[1:05:33] God will let come you dump out God will
[1:05:36] fill in all the petty things of you got
[1:05:38] to do this you got to do that you ought
[1:05:40] to do this and you ought to do that
[1:05:41] forget it dump it out of your soul
[1:05:43] that's why I said this is not a
[1:05:44] performance-based
[1:05:46] Christianity but you die
[1:05:49] out he said you got to do this you got
[1:05:52] to do that what's he talking about
[1:05:53] legalism
[1:05:55] but he says you die out and something's
[1:05:57] going to happen that brings in the
[1:05:58] things that you need you've got to die
[1:06:01] out now listen to what he says say God
[1:06:04] let me from this day be holy thine Lord
[1:06:08] I come with a broken heart I come with a
[1:06:10] contrite spirit I love you you know I
[1:06:14] love you and I want to forget all this
[1:06:16] foolishness of all these 40-day fasts
[1:06:18] and see if I can get closer to God and
[1:06:20] all this that all the other all this
[1:06:22] nonsense he says stop it there's nothing
[1:06:24] in the world tells you to have a 40 in
[1:06:26] the word that tells you to have a 40-day
[1:06:28] fast not a thing there's nothing in the
[1:06:30] world telling you to fast less God would
[1:06:32] tell you he says if you fast you ain't
[1:06:34] going to get hungry and go all these
[1:06:35] things now he's referring to brother to
[1:06:38] to Jesus when Jesus fasted 40 days in
[1:06:40] the wilderness he wasn't hungry until he
[1:06:42] was done his
[1:06:43] fast and and brother Bam's saying that
[1:06:45] if you go on a fast and it's God that's
[1:06:47] telling you to do it you won't even be
[1:06:49] hungry throughout it what's he trying to
[1:06:51] do he's trying to break people out of a
[1:06:52] religious habit and get them into an
[1:06:54] inspired action cuz Jesus said there's
[1:06:57] some demons won't count ex come out
[1:06:58] except by prayer and fasting that tells
[1:07:00] me there's a time for fasting but you
[1:07:03] got to be inspired to do it not just
[1:07:04] have it by
[1:07:05] ritual he says as you are fasting
[1:07:08] brother you'll be joy and happy all the
[1:07:10] time he he refers to scripture says
[1:07:13] don't appear before men like Hypocrites
[1:07:15] do with a long sad face I'm on a 40-day
[1:07:17] fast my plates won't fit me anymore I've
[1:07:19] lost 30 PBS and they told me I look
[1:07:21] better after this is over he says oh
[1:07:22] nonsense it's enti ing spirits of the
[1:07:24] devil he says now watch this get up on
[1:07:27] the Altar and say Glory Glory Glory till
[1:07:29] you can hardly say anything else and say
[1:07:31] you got to speak in tongues before you
[1:07:33] get the Holy Ghost he says nonsense dump
[1:07:35] it out get that out of your system and
[1:07:38] come on the word of God he said repent
[1:07:42] every one of you be baptized in the name
[1:07:43] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:07:45] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:07:47] of the Holy Ghost if God don't keep his
[1:07:49] word he's not God Amen dump out get
[1:07:52] filled up amen W he says I love that
[1:07:55] that's his word God said so that's right
[1:07:57] and when God said it God will take care
[1:07:59] of it all right now watch he says all
[1:08:02] the preparations you make all the going
[1:08:05] to church you can do he's not saying
[1:08:08] don't do it he's saying that's not how
[1:08:10] you get
[1:08:11] it he says it's just like going down
[1:08:13] here to the car Works where they build a
[1:08:16] build big bunch of Passenger cars he's
[1:08:17] talk about trains I used to work there
[1:08:19] and they take and build these big
[1:08:20] coaches and everything they put hardwood
[1:08:22] inlaid mahogany all around and
[1:08:24] everything's so beautiful set it out
[1:08:26] there on the track and it was as dead as
[1:08:28] a doornail there set the engine no steam
[1:08:31] in it she just sat there he says what it
[1:08:33] needs today is some fire in the boiler
[1:08:36] what it needs today is some steam what
[1:08:39] it needs today the church to boil he
[1:08:42] says the hottest boiling thing there is
[1:08:44] to boil sin out of your life is
[1:08:47] love you can't love one another how you
[1:08:49] going to love God who you haven't seen
[1:08:51] love hides a multitude of sin get in
[1:08:54] love with God then you'll love one
[1:08:56] another then you'll love the church
[1:08:58] you'll love the cause you'll love
[1:09:00] everything that's Godly and you'll keep
[1:09:02] away from the things of the world that's
[1:09:04] a that's a One-Stop shop right there
[1:09:07] you'll love one another you'll love the
[1:09:09] church you'll love the cause you'll love
[1:09:10] everything that's Godly and you'll keep
[1:09:12] away from the things of the word I say
[1:09:13] God give me more love give me more love
[1:09:16] if it's going to have that effect give
[1:09:17] me more of that that's the kind of stuff
[1:09:19] I want in my life brother van would say
[1:09:21] this he'd say you reckon yourself
[1:09:24] dead then you're born of
[1:09:27] Faith you reckon yourself dead then
[1:09:30] you're born of Faith then virtue and
[1:09:32] these other things is added to you until
[1:09:34] you're a perfect living image of God
[1:09:37] like I said earlier if you die out to
[1:09:39] yourself you'll find that these virtues
[1:09:41] that Peter talks about in second Peter 1
[1:09:43] just start to develop
[1:09:45] naturally I'm not saying that it won't
[1:09:47] be in I'm not saying it's going to be
[1:09:50] enjoyable dying out ain't fun rotting
[1:09:53] isn't fun humbling isn't Fun killing
[1:09:57] Pride isn't fun cuz this entire body
[1:10:01] wants to hold on to those things but
[1:10:03] there's an inner man in there that's
[1:10:04] crying out to be reborn it's trying to
[1:10:05] be made into the image of God and so
[1:10:08] it's fighting to bring everything else
[1:10:10] under subjection amen you're letting go
[1:10:12] of so many things and when you let go
[1:10:14] what comes with that often is a feeling
[1:10:15] of helplessness and that's the hardest
[1:10:17] thing for a Believer to do is let go
[1:10:20] because what you're doing is you're
[1:10:21] giving up your rights and in Le oia
[1:10:24] rights are all that they care about and
[1:10:27] what you're saying as a Christian is I
[1:10:29] give up my rights I give up my right to
[1:10:32] be offended I give up my right to be
[1:10:34] hurt I give up my right to stand up for
[1:10:36] myself I give up my right to lash out at
[1:10:38] people I lay it all down so that
[1:10:41] Christ's love can flow through me amen
[1:10:45] amen but notice something when you do
[1:10:47] something it has an effect when you do
[1:10:50] something but when God does something it
[1:10:52] has a supernatural effect
[1:10:54] so what you do naturally God comes right
[1:10:57] behind it and he steps in he does the
[1:10:58] supernatural but you've got to let go
[1:11:00] that's your choice it's your decision
[1:11:02] it's your duty are you going to let
[1:11:04] these things go amen you notice that all
[1:11:06] the events and actions are on top of the
[1:11:08] line are based on the word and we'll see
[1:11:10] this as as we get back to this in a
[1:11:12] minute but you choose based on what
[1:11:14] faith in God's word and then the word
[1:11:16] comes right behind it and it does what
[1:11:18] you've taken Faith to act on you started
[1:11:21] with your faith God finishes it by going
[1:11:23] to work through word what's he saying
[1:11:25] you want to get the Holy Ghost first
[1:11:26] thing you got to do here is die out dump
[1:11:29] out dump out I've said this before I
[1:11:32] we've been well taught here I came in
[1:11:34] and when I got the holy ghost at the age
[1:11:36] of 17 I had lots of ideas I had lots of
[1:11:38] doctrines well taught but I had to let
[1:11:41] every single one of those things go and
[1:11:42] pull them back through the filter of a
[1:11:43] newborn Son of God you have to because
[1:11:46] let me tell you your perspective is
[1:11:48] wrong no matter how well you've been
[1:11:49] taught how good you think you are it's
[1:11:51] got to come back through the filter of
[1:11:52] the Holy Spirit cuz that's what quickens
[1:11:55] the word that's what quickens the word
[1:11:57] and so you're going to have to die out
[1:11:58] to some things you thought about in the
[1:11:59] scriptures as well things that you
[1:12:00] thought that brother Bram said or what
[1:12:02] he meant through different things but
[1:12:04] what if you'll humble yourself to the
[1:12:05] word then the word through the holy
[1:12:07] spirit will come back and turn you into
[1:12:08] a True Believer brother Brown would say
[1:12:11] this in the message hear you him he says
[1:12:12] and men today is constrained by the Holy
[1:12:14] Spirit to come and love him and serve
[1:12:18] him for he's seeking such to do that God
[1:12:21] is looking for someone who will stand
[1:12:22] out on the front line with great power
[1:12:25] and
[1:12:27] boldness tremendous
[1:12:30] gifts
[1:12:32] discernment third pole
[1:12:35] Authority does he say any of that
[1:12:38] there he says who will stand out on the
[1:12:40] front line with one thing
[1:12:42] love love it's the the the defining
[1:12:45] trait the defining feature of God is
[1:12:46] that he is love he says not with no
[1:12:48] education I'm not trying to support my
[1:12:50] ignorance but I am trying to say that it
[1:12:52] doesn't take scholar ships it takes a
[1:12:54] surrendered heart that God Can Make Love
[1:12:59] he says you don't know the Bible half as
[1:13:00] good as the devil does what he's saying
[1:13:01] is you can study your way and the devil
[1:13:03] will twist you around like a knot no
[1:13:06] problem no problem because he's been
[1:13:07] studying it for an awful long time
[1:13:09] compared to us hasn't he but he can't
[1:13:11] get past Revelation but he can twist you
[1:13:13] in knots with the scripture if you let
[1:13:14] him do it so what happens after this you
[1:13:17] die out and what happens when you die
[1:13:19] out is as you die out you're obeying the
[1:13:21] word amen and it's the sanctification
[1:13:24] process and as we've said before this is
[1:13:26] a work of the Holy Spirit just like all
[1:13:28] other aspects are and what is it it's
[1:13:30] God's spirit striving with you it's
[1:13:33] striving because there's a battle there
[1:13:35] because you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:36] yet and so your nature is there and it
[1:13:39] wants to hold on and the holy spirit's
[1:13:41] wooing and it's calling and it's pulling
[1:13:42] and sometimes it's pushing and
[1:13:44] occasionally it's kicking to get you to
[1:13:46] do the right thing to get you to see
[1:13:47] what's going on so you'll let go so that
[1:13:50] what the sanctification process can go
[1:13:52] on and these Christian virtues that he
[1:13:54] talks about the Statue of a perfect man
[1:13:55] can step into US amen you can't say that
[1:13:59] you've died out and then not obey the
[1:14:00] word it's impossible how can you have
[1:14:03] died out and then stick to what you
[1:14:04] think rather than what the word thinks
[1:14:06] whether what the word says the word
[1:14:07] doesn't think the word is it's an
[1:14:09] absolute it's true it just is and so how
[1:14:11] can you elevate yourself above it if
[1:14:12] you've died out if you've died out then
[1:14:14] the word automatically takes preeminence
[1:14:15] in these things now this is often where
[1:14:18] we see a bit of a a span of time you
[1:14:20] know you look at the accept the word and
[1:14:22] justification that is theoretically just
[1:14:24] something that can happen like that that
[1:14:26] that really is I believe that it's
[1:14:27] something that's virtually instantaneous
[1:14:29] but now we get into this next portion of
[1:14:31] sanctification and this can take years
[1:14:33] or it could be literally the work that
[1:14:35] that was already going on in in some
[1:14:36] form or fashion if you're a religious
[1:14:38] person if you've been raised in a
[1:14:39] Christian Home sanctification has been
[1:14:41] going on most of your life whether you
[1:14:42] realize it or not so you're already
[1:14:44] mostly cleaned out in many ways you
[1:14:46] might have a few habits that you've been
[1:14:47] hiding from your parents or these
[1:14:49] different things or your spouse even but
[1:14:51] but most of your life is generally
[1:14:52] cleaned out so this can be a a short
[1:14:53] period or a long period but or a short
[1:14:55] work or a long work if I can put it that
[1:14:57] way but it's going to depend on two
[1:14:59] things first thing is what's your
[1:15:00] position in the body of Christ what is
[1:15:02] God preparing you to do what is your
[1:15:04] purpose in the kingdom and if you're in
[1:15:06] a position of Greater Authority then God
[1:15:07] traditionally is going to work with you
[1:15:08] a lot longer and he's going to work a
[1:15:10] lot deeper if I can put it that way why
[1:15:13] because you've got to be perfectly
[1:15:14] prepared for the authority that you're
[1:15:16] going to be given for the responsibility
[1:15:18] that you're going to have for the gift
[1:15:20] that you're going to have whatever it's
[1:15:21] going to be the greater The Authority
[1:15:23] the the greater the responsibility the
[1:15:24] greater the cleaning that has to happen
[1:15:26] in these things why cuz your character
[1:15:28] has to be tested and proven before God
[1:15:29] can put Power there we said it before
[1:15:32] power without character is what satanic
[1:15:35] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:15:36] that's what brother brandham said so
[1:15:38] look at this in second timothy2 it says
[1:15:40] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:15:42] stands sure having this seal the Lord
[1:15:44] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:15:46] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[1:15:48] depart from iniquity but in a great
[1:15:50] house there are not only vessels of gold
[1:15:52] and of silver but also of wood and of
[1:15:54] Earth so there's all different ones
[1:15:56] there's one with high honor and low
[1:15:57] honor ones that are used for certain
[1:15:59] things and ones that are used for other
[1:16:00] things he says and some to honor and
[1:16:02] some to dishonor if a man therefore
[1:16:05] Purge himself from these he's talking
[1:16:06] about the bad things he talked about
[1:16:08] earlier in the chapter he shall be a
[1:16:10] vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat
[1:16:13] for the Master's use ready for the
[1:16:15] Master's use acceptable for the Master's
[1:16:17] use and prepared unto every good work so
[1:16:19] in other words if this sanctification
[1:16:22] process has its Pur perfect work then
[1:16:24] when you're done you're ready for your
[1:16:25] use whatever God has determined remember
[1:16:28] he says the Lord knows them that are his
[1:16:29] and if he knows you're his then he knows
[1:16:31] what your purpose is as well and so his
[1:16:33] only work is to prepare you for your
[1:16:36] purpose in the kingdom of God cuz you're
[1:16:38] going to produce an element of the word
[1:16:40] that nobody else can do and so he's
[1:16:42] preparing you for that specific thing so
[1:16:44] if the man's life is Sanctified he'll be
[1:16:46] prepared appropriately for his end
[1:16:48] purpose and position by the washing of
[1:16:49] Water by the word and then Tim Paul says
[1:16:52] to Timothy flee also youthful lust but
[1:16:55] follow righteousness Faith charity peace
[1:16:57] with them that call on the Lord out of a
[1:16:59] pure heart so I want you to look at it
[1:17:01] this way because there are different
[1:17:03] levels of
[1:17:05] clean and and the wives would say just
[1:17:08] between us and our husbands we know
[1:17:09] there are different levels of clean
[1:17:11] she'll say go clean the kitchen and we
[1:17:13] clean the kitchen and then they come
[1:17:14] behind to us it's clean and they say
[1:17:16] that ain't clean they say can you clean
[1:17:18] up the bathroom before the guests come
[1:17:19] over we clean it up and they go in and
[1:17:21] they clean it all over again don't they
[1:17:23] but we're talking about being fit for
[1:17:24] purpose and so if you have a mechanic
[1:17:27] that's working on a car and you look at
[1:17:29] his tools tools don't have to be clean
[1:17:32] now anybody that has any sort of
[1:17:34] semblance of respectability in their in
[1:17:36] their job is going to keep their tools
[1:17:37] as clean as possible because that's how
[1:17:39] they stay in good working order and they
[1:17:40] do a better job when they're clean but
[1:17:42] you don't go to your mechanic and say
[1:17:44] how clean are your tools before he works
[1:17:45] on your car why because your car is
[1:17:47] filthy especially in new land it's
[1:17:49] covered in Rust he's going to have to
[1:17:50] use a torch on half the parts anyways
[1:17:52] half the things are going to break all
[1:17:53] you care is are they strong enough to
[1:17:55] get the job done and does he know what
[1:17:56] he's doing you don't care how clean his
[1:17:57] tools are so if there's a smudge of
[1:17:59] grease on here or some dirt or rust on
[1:18:01] the tools we don't care people won't
[1:18:03] even notice dirt after a mechanic's done
[1:18:05] his work his tools are clean but they're
[1:18:08] clean for a mechanic's work but now you
[1:18:10] go to a guy that does woodworking or
[1:18:11] maybe he's he's building furniture or
[1:18:13] something his tools have to be much
[1:18:15] cleaner because he's working now on
[1:18:16] something that's going to be uh inside
[1:18:18] the house it's out of the elements
[1:18:20] people are going to sit on it people are
[1:18:21] going to look at it and you're going to
[1:18:23] notice if your if your your furniture or
[1:18:26] your your couch or something has a dark
[1:18:27] smear of dirt or grease on it cuz he
[1:18:29] didn't keep his tools clean aren't you
[1:18:32] he's working with a product that's going
[1:18:33] to show and hold on to dirt a whole lot
[1:18:36] more and so his tools have to be that
[1:18:38] much cleaner than a mechanic's but now
[1:18:40] you go to a Chef's
[1:18:42] kitchen and he's got tools just like
[1:18:44] everybody else but a chef's tools have
[1:18:47] to be that much more clean don't they
[1:18:49] because now he's working with food now
[1:18:50] he's working with something that you
[1:18:51] don't just maybe sit but now he's
[1:18:53] talking working on something that goes
[1:18:55] inside of you and when things go inside
[1:18:56] of you they have to be very clean and so
[1:18:59] a chef's knives they have to clean them
[1:19:01] after every use because otherwise they
[1:19:02] can cross contaminate can't they and if
[1:19:05] he goes and he cuts a piece of raw
[1:19:06] chicken and then goes and cuts something
[1:19:08] that's going directly without being
[1:19:09] baked then what happens that bacteria
[1:19:12] will get transferred onto the food you
[1:19:14] eat it it can make you very sick it give
[1:19:16] you food poisoning and in the worst case
[1:19:18] it can kill you a chef that works with
[1:19:20] unclean tools with unclean knives and
[1:19:22] these different things can literally
[1:19:24] kill a person or make them very sick so
[1:19:26] there's a different level of cleaning
[1:19:27] for a chef's a Chef's Equipment doesn't
[1:19:29] it they've got to put it and they got to
[1:19:31] scrub it in really hot water and lots of
[1:19:32] soap and they got to run it through a a
[1:19:34] high-grade you know uh washing uh
[1:19:37] dishwasher and all these different
[1:19:38] things why because the impact of the
[1:19:41] dirt is much more is much higher than
[1:19:43] it's just a mechanic with dirty tools
[1:19:46] but then you step into an operating
[1:19:48] room and they're using knives just like
[1:19:51] a chef uses they're using drills just
[1:19:54] like a literally you look at some of
[1:19:56] these things on YouTube where they're
[1:19:57] doing it and they've got literally a
[1:19:58] DeWalt drill in some cases they're using
[1:20:01] the exact same thing that the Carpenter
[1:20:03] and the woodworker or even the chef
[1:20:04] might use but you talk about clean an
[1:20:06] operating room is the Apex it's the peak
[1:20:08] of cleanliness because there if anything
[1:20:11] is dirty people die they get infections
[1:20:14] and then they they might die or else
[1:20:15] they do die why everything they use has
[1:20:18] to have no bacteria no dirt no
[1:20:20] uncleanliness what whatsoever it has to
[1:20:23] be perfect and so they boil the
[1:20:24] instruments they clean the instruments
[1:20:26] they use a special antiseptic soap and
[1:20:28] then they use an ultrasonic cleaner now
[1:20:31] I know a bit about ultrasonic cleaners
[1:20:32] cuz I want to get one because they make
[1:20:34] things clean that you can't clean any
[1:20:35] other way and do you know how they do it
[1:20:37] they take sound waves and they vibrate
[1:20:40] everything that's on that object and
[1:20:42] they shake it loose and you don't have
[1:20:45] to do anything you literally just sit in
[1:20:46] there and it's goes
[1:20:47] go and it's shaking all the dirt all the
[1:20:50] bacteria everything out of it and it
[1:20:52] cleans it in the way way that nothing
[1:20:53] else can you can't clean it that much if
[1:20:55] you scrub it you could scrub it all day
[1:20:56] and never get it as clean as an
[1:20:57] ultrasonic cleaner will cuz it's shaking
[1:21:00] loose anything that wasn't there in the
[1:21:02] original God's got an ultrasonic cleaner
[1:21:04] doesn't he what is it it's the washing
[1:21:06] of Water by the word and what is it
[1:21:08] doing it's shaking loose everything
[1:21:11] that'll fall apart as soon as you get on
[1:21:13] the journey and so the cleaner you got
[1:21:15] to be the more Sanctified you got to be
[1:21:18] for your role the deeper that word's got
[1:21:20] to clean there's things that some people
[1:21:22] are God allows them to do cuz it doesn't
[1:21:24] matter in the role they're in and then
[1:21:25] he'll take the next one he'll say you
[1:21:27] can't do that remember Jesus said he
[1:21:29] says I sanctify myself for their sake
[1:21:32] there are things that we ought to
[1:21:33] sanctify for the sake of those that are
[1:21:34] beneath us and when I say beneath us I
[1:21:36] mean those that we're raising our
[1:21:37] children these different things we ought
[1:21:39] not to have such a liberty that we would
[1:21:41] bring something dirty into their lives
[1:21:42] we might be able to handle it but if
[1:21:44] they can't handle it we ought not to do
[1:21:45] it we sanctify ourselves for their
[1:21:47] reason but what is it there some of us
[1:21:49] are called to do surgical procedures by
[1:21:51] the word of God and that means means
[1:21:52] your life has to be Sanctified cuz
[1:21:54] otherwise what gets into it is your idea
[1:21:56] your preference you're doing it for
[1:21:58] yourself rather for them and what
[1:22:01] happens is that taints the whole thing
[1:22:02] you can kill somebody like that you can
[1:22:04] cause an injury you can you can get them
[1:22:06] to leave you can offend them in s sort
[1:22:07] of a way but every tool every person
[1:22:10] I've mentioned here has clean tools but
[1:22:11] clean is a relative term you'll find
[1:22:13] that's what Timothy's even talking about
[1:22:15] is we've got different ones that are at
[1:22:16] a certain level and then other ones and
[1:22:18] Jesus would talk about some of us we
[1:22:19] have a 30-fold return some of us are
[1:22:22] 60-fold and some of us are 100-fold and
[1:22:25] each one of us is cleaned and prepared
[1:22:26] for that purpose and I believe the
[1:22:28] greater the purpose the greater the
[1:22:30] return but remember brother bam says God
[1:22:32] will train a man for his entire life for
[1:22:33] 15 minutes of
[1:22:35] work but that's all you've got to do and
[1:22:37] you've got to be ready and prepared and
[1:22:38] clean for that moment listen under the
[1:22:40] blood we're all the same cleanliness
[1:22:42] don't don't think for a second I'm
[1:22:43] saying that brother Bob's cleaner than
[1:22:45] sister Selena who's cleaner than Sister
[1:22:47] Kim who's cleaner than brother Matt no
[1:22:48] no no we're not talking about that we're
[1:22:50] talking about sanctification for
[1:22:51] preparation for use under the blood
[1:22:54] we're all perfectly clean we are sinless
[1:22:56] we are spotless we are wrinkle-free
[1:22:57] there is no difference I'm not doing
[1:22:59] this to elevate one or the other but I'm
[1:23:01] saying God has to use people in
[1:23:02] different ways and he's got to prepare
[1:23:04] people to a higher level than others in
[1:23:05] some cases amen some people have to be
[1:23:08] further away from the world than others
[1:23:09] if I can just make it that simple so the
[1:23:11] first thing is what what is your
[1:23:13] position that's going to determine how
[1:23:14] long this this sanctification process is
[1:23:16] but the second thing is what's your
[1:23:17] attitude what's your attitude towards
[1:23:19] the word of God cuz if you're rebellious
[1:23:22] sanctify if is going to take a real long
[1:23:23] time if you're prideful dying out in
[1:23:26] sanctification is going to take the
[1:23:27] longest time you can ever imagine pride
[1:23:29] is the killer to the Christian walk
[1:23:31] brother Braham said humility is power
[1:23:33] with God pride is nothing pride comes
[1:23:36] before a fall that's all Pride's good
[1:23:38] for making you trip up and fall over so
[1:23:41] your attitude your approach is going to
[1:23:43] determine how long this takes because if
[1:23:44] you do it easy God will give it to you
[1:23:46] easy you go hard God will make it hard
[1:23:49] it's your decision it's your choice it's
[1:23:50] the way you approach it brother Bram
[1:23:53] says it this way he says then God
[1:23:54] representing his church as a bride a
[1:23:56] woman God represents his church as a
[1:23:58] bride and the way he brings each
[1:23:59] individual to be his son to go in that
[1:24:02] bride he has also brought the bride
[1:24:04] through these ages till he brings this
[1:24:06] one complete Church into this he says my
[1:24:08] feet move why cuz my head says so now it
[1:24:11] can't move like my hand cuz it's my feet
[1:24:13] Luther can't do the things we did
[1:24:15] neither can the Methodist because they
[1:24:17] were something else see the feet moves
[1:24:19] because the head said so and the head
[1:24:22] never says now feet you become hand ear
[1:24:25] you become eyes in other words I don't
[1:24:27] get to tell you what to be and who to be
[1:24:29] in the kingdom of God I've got my place
[1:24:32] you've got your place and you're
[1:24:33] positionally placed by the father and
[1:24:35] I'm positionally placed by the father I
[1:24:36] don't positionally place you and you
[1:24:38] don't positionally Place me and I can't
[1:24:40] say you're not like me therefore you're
[1:24:41] wrong and you can't say brother John
[1:24:43] you're not like me therefore you're
[1:24:45] wrong you can't do it why each one of us
[1:24:47] is shaped and prepared for a certain
[1:24:50] place and position and purpose in the
[1:24:51] body of CHR Christ it's the holy spirit
[1:24:54] that places us not the pastor not the
[1:24:56] preacher not Mommy not Daddy not the
[1:24:57] church
[1:24:58] nothing he says but each age God has
[1:25:01] placed these things into his church and
[1:25:03] patterned it by showing that each
[1:25:06] individual has these and possesses these
[1:25:08] qualities he's talking about the Statue
[1:25:09] of a perfect man and this being when
[1:25:12] it's completed is the Church of God
[1:25:13] going to the Rapture so he says you've
[1:25:15] got individuals and then the individuals
[1:25:16] come together form the body the being
[1:25:18] and he says that's the Church of God
[1:25:20] that's going into Rapture and this being
[1:25:23] individual and completed is a servant of
[1:25:26] God in the Church of God that's going in
[1:25:27] the Rapture so there's a working on the
[1:25:29] entire body and then there's a working
[1:25:31] on the individuals you and I inside of
[1:25:33] this he says see what I mean there you
[1:25:34] are there's the full thing so you're
[1:25:36] just a little piece in the big body but
[1:25:38] you've got to be prepared just like
[1:25:40] everybody else so that the body comes
[1:25:41] into its perfect
[1:25:43] headship he says here comes a man Paul
[1:25:46] laying the foundation irius began to
[1:25:48] pour this onto it the next one poured
[1:25:50] this the next one poured this next one
[1:25:51] that this and that on down till it comes
[1:25:53] to the last age he says but what is it
[1:25:55] it's the same Spirit The Same Spirit
[1:25:57] that dwells in me says hands reach after
[1:25:59] that case the same spirit says feet make
[1:26:02] a step see what I mean then the whole
[1:26:04] stature of your being is governed and
[1:26:06] controlled by these things what these
[1:26:09] virtues but it cannot be completely
[1:26:12] controlled till it completely possesses
[1:26:14] these qualities in other words Christ
[1:26:16] can't take full control unless the
[1:26:18] qualities are there in the first place
[1:26:20] that's in Statue of a perfect man then
[1:26:21] he comes out on and hear ye himym this
[1:26:23] is 5 years previous he says God is
[1:26:25] looking for time tested Christians time
[1:26:29] tested Christians so that means there's
[1:26:30] a time I can't tell you how long but
[1:26:33] there's a time for testing every son
[1:26:35] that comes to God must be tried child
[1:26:37] trained and tested and you who jump from
[1:26:40] pillar to pul and this to that and in
[1:26:42] and out how can God ever adopt you into
[1:26:44] his family or positionally place you now
[1:26:46] think of that for a moment how can you
[1:26:47] be positionally placed when you will not
[1:26:50] stand still long enough for God to do it
[1:26:53] dying out when you're dying out you
[1:26:54] don't do a whole lot of moving around
[1:26:56] you ever been so sick you couldn't move
[1:26:59] that's what dying out ought to feel like
[1:27:01] you're standing there and you're just
[1:27:02] letting it all out and then he's got to
[1:27:03] fill it back in not a lot of running
[1:27:06] around when you're dying out because you
[1:27:07] don't feel like anything CU you're
[1:27:08] rotting you're dying out everything's
[1:27:10] passing away old things are becoming new
[1:27:13] so things are going away and new things
[1:27:14] are coming up you're not going to be
[1:27:16] doing a bunch of running around in this
[1:27:19] but there comes a point where you get
[1:27:20] those qualities those the these these
[1:27:22] things in the Statue of perfect man and
[1:27:24] it's God that decides it not you and not
[1:27:26] me I don't decide it for myself and I
[1:27:28] don't decide it for you and you don't
[1:27:29] decide it for me why because God looks
[1:27:31] at the heart God always looks at the
[1:27:34] heart God can see things in you and I
[1:27:36] that we don't see in ourselves and he'll
[1:27:37] say it's there and we don't even realize
[1:27:39] it's
[1:27:40] there absolutely God's Sovereign he
[1:27:42] knows he can see these different things
[1:27:44] now you may not realize you have it and
[1:27:47] God will say that's it you're done and I
[1:27:49] can give you the Holy Ghost now
[1:27:50] sometimes you think you got and God says
[1:27:51] you you ain't got it let's go around the
[1:27:53] mountain one more time and you sit there
[1:27:55] and you say why do I keep going around
[1:27:57] and around and around cuz you don't have
[1:27:58] it yet you haven't figured out the
[1:28:00] problem you haven't humbled yourself you
[1:28:02] haven't died out to something so God
[1:28:03] says let's do this one more around the
[1:28:05] mountain around the desert wherever he's
[1:28:06] taking you he's got to get you to the
[1:28:07] point where you'll you'll fully die out
[1:28:10] he says in Blasphemous names he says God
[1:28:12] is building in seven Church ages a bride
[1:28:14] for Christ through the Philadelphian
[1:28:16] tharan pergamus sman and Ephesus a
[1:28:19] church age that Jesus said if the
[1:28:21] bridegroom came in the first first watch
[1:28:22] or the seventh watch all these virgins
[1:28:24] awakened they were they awoke The
[1:28:26] Virgins of Ephesus Smyrna pergamos
[1:28:28] tharus Sardis Philadelphia and Lea did
[1:28:31] you notice that he said it was the
[1:28:32] seventh age when he came and woke up
[1:28:35] those sleeping virgins that brings them
[1:28:37] all the way back down to here and he's
[1:28:38] showing the statue of a perfect man he
[1:28:40] says for in these through these years
[1:28:42] and ages he has built a bride he has
[1:28:45] borne a bride and he has begotten a
[1:28:48] bride on Earth for Christ he has
[1:28:50] begotten he's born and he's built three
[1:28:53] different things going on there he says
[1:28:55] in the same way that he begets this
[1:28:57] bride he has begot individuals so he's
[1:28:59] building up a bride body but now he says
[1:29:01] he's doing the same thing in individuals
[1:29:03] he says now these things these Virtues
[1:29:05] Of second Peter 1 he says here
[1:29:07] absolutely must be in the Christian
[1:29:10] before the holy ghost ever seals him
[1:29:12] before this comes down on top and makes
[1:29:15] a complete Unity he's talking about
[1:29:16] Christ coming down the head the top of
[1:29:18] the
[1:29:19] pyramid he says You must have these
[1:29:21] qualities before you get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:22] absolutely he's emphatic about it now I
[1:29:25] can't put a timeline on your life and I
[1:29:26] can't put it on mine amen but the
[1:29:28] prophet is adamant that you can't get
[1:29:30] the Holy Ghost unless you got the
[1:29:31] Christian virtues inside of you God has
[1:29:33] to do a work in your life and it's a
[1:29:35] working of the Holy Spirit we've talked
[1:29:37] about these things now that might seem
[1:29:39] unfair you say well how am I supposed to
[1:29:41] do that how am I supposed to be Godly
[1:29:42] without God look at the old teston none
[1:29:46] of them in the Old Testament had the
[1:29:47] Holy Ghost and yet you'll go through and
[1:29:49] you'll see it even as we get into this
[1:29:50] message on Statue of a perfect man
[1:29:52] brother Brandon will use Old Testament
[1:29:54] Saints to give give it uh examples of
[1:29:57] second Peter 1
[1:29:58] virtues so you don't they didn't have
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost but yet they have virtues
[1:30:01] you want Faith they got a whole chapter
[1:30:03] of people in the Old Testament that had
[1:30:05] Faith you see ones that have brotherly
[1:30:07] kindness You' got ones that have virtue
[1:30:08] all these different things it's all in
[1:30:10] the Old Testament that's just the nature
[1:30:13] the characteristics of God being drawn
[1:30:14] out of that c Gene inside of you by the
[1:30:17] presence of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:30:18] Brewing of the holy spirit it's bringing
[1:30:20] out what's inside you in the first place
[1:30:22] so that God can come in and inhabit it
[1:30:24] that's all that's going on they had it
[1:30:26] you look at I mean how many of the Great
[1:30:27] Heroes of the faith are in the Old
[1:30:28] Testament you'd say I wish I was like
[1:30:30] David or I wish wish I was like Ruth or
[1:30:32] whatever hopefully nobody wants to be
[1:30:33] like Rab in terms of her entire life but
[1:30:35] in certainly in how she responded to the
[1:30:37] word we should we should be like rahab's
[1:30:40] that when we hear it we lay hold of it
[1:30:41] and we get our family in brother baham
[1:30:43] said when you get the token he says you
[1:30:45] want to get everybody else to get the
[1:30:46] token you got a desire to get everybody
[1:30:49] else in the house to get them safe under
[1:30:50] that token that's a Ministry for every
[1:30:53] one of us regardless get people to get
[1:30:55] what you've got because he says if you
[1:30:56] got it you'll be convinced and concerned
[1:30:58] for others as well amen but he says it
[1:31:01] what before this comes down on top and
[1:31:03] makes them a complete unit they had
[1:31:05] these virtues under an imperfect
[1:31:07] atonement under the blood of bulls and
[1:31:08] goats like I said brother br will use it
[1:31:10] we'll see as we get into this as as he
[1:31:12] preaches on Statue of a perfect man so
[1:31:15] these things are part of being a
[1:31:16] Christian but it is not the infilling of
[1:31:18] the Holy Ghost but it's a work of the
[1:31:19] Holy Ghost but when you have it then you
[1:31:22] have this pivotal moment and what is it
[1:31:24] it's getting filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:25] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:31:27] the infilling of the spirit whatever you
[1:31:28] want to call it and it's the greatest
[1:31:30] moment of your entire life because this
[1:31:32] is the Capstone this is the ceiling of
[1:31:34] the finished work this is the baptism
[1:31:36] into the body of Christ this is where
[1:31:38] you are sealed to the day of your total
[1:31:40] Redemption it's a finished work from
[1:31:42] there you never have to worry you're not
[1:31:44] going into
[1:31:46] tribulation you've already passed from
[1:31:48] death into life you've already been
[1:31:50] judged you're under the blood you're
[1:31:51] Perfect You're spotless you have the
[1:31:53] character and now he comes on top of you
[1:31:55] and he seals it and it's God saying
[1:31:56] you're good to go you've got what I need
[1:31:58] inside of you now I'm going to come in
[1:32:00] and I'm going to dwell in you and what
[1:32:01] happens after that is you live a life
[1:32:03] that you couldn't live before not that
[1:32:05] you couldn't live a Christian life but
[1:32:06] now you're living the Christian life now
[1:32:09] you're you're acting in ways that you
[1:32:11] never could before now listen God can
[1:32:13] take 10 years to give somebody the Holy
[1:32:16] Ghost and God can take God can give it
[1:32:18] to you in a moment and as we get into
[1:32:20] scriptures we'll see is I don't speak
[1:32:22] for God he's Sovereign and I don't know
[1:32:24] all the ins and outs but there are
[1:32:25] people that get it faster and there are
[1:32:26] people that get it slower and that's
[1:32:28] just the way it is don't worry how long
[1:32:30] it takes just worry do I have
[1:32:32] it and if you don't have it stay there
[1:32:34] till you get it that's all I think I can
[1:32:36] say on that but brother BR would say
[1:32:38] this and blasphemous names he says now
[1:32:40] when the member is born by the Holy
[1:32:43] Ghost into the family of God so remember
[1:32:45] we talked about that that full service
[1:32:46] on New Birth versus born again and all
[1:32:48] these different things this what he's
[1:32:49] talking about he's saying when you've
[1:32:50] accepted Christ as your savior
[1:32:52] he says and has proven to have these
[1:32:53] virtues in him that God can see virtue
[1:32:56] knowledge Temperance patience brotherly
[1:32:58] kindness and godliness in him then God
[1:33:00] seals him or places
[1:33:03] him now brother bam will say at
[1:33:05] different times he'll say sealing and
[1:33:07] placing happen at the same time and then
[1:33:08] he splits them up in other places and
[1:33:10] we'll take it into the scriptures and
[1:33:11] you'll see there's some places where
[1:33:12] people got the Holy Ghost and were
[1:33:14] immediately adopted and there's places
[1:33:15] where people got the Holy Ghost and then
[1:33:17] God did a work with them to train them
[1:33:19] and then he adopts them and we see it in
[1:33:21] well I won't go into it I don't want to
[1:33:22] give don't want to give it all away amen
[1:33:24] but he says God seals him or places him
[1:33:27] he says and there that's when you see
[1:33:29] the Sons and Daughters of God that's
[1:33:31] when you're truly a Son of God that's
[1:33:32] where you see a Son of God manifest if
[1:33:34] we can put it that way he says then
[1:33:36] Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy
[1:33:38] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[1:33:40] until the day of your Redemption he says
[1:33:43] now some of you Baptists want to go on
[1:33:44] eternal security Now if you'll come to
[1:33:47] that stage if you'll come to this place
[1:33:48] he says I'll stand with you it's eternal
[1:33:50] security if if you'll come to this place
[1:33:53] what get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:55] he says but just to say anybody says
[1:33:57] I've joined the Baptist Church I'm a
[1:33:59] presbyter and I got eternal security he
[1:34:01] says that's wrong now that means nothing
[1:34:03] to us but if you say I attend a message
[1:34:07] church and I've accepted a
[1:34:08] prophet that's just as wrong as what the
[1:34:10] Baptists are
[1:34:12] saying why because you got to have the
[1:34:15] life lots of people can nod their head
[1:34:17] and say yes I believe it but can you
[1:34:19] live it can you be it
[1:34:22] not just live it but can you be it can
[1:34:23] you be the embodiment of the message not
[1:34:25] just nod your head and say that amen you
[1:34:27] don't you don't rest on you don't rest
[1:34:29] on what you know you got to rest on who
[1:34:31] you know and then the thing is lots of
[1:34:33] people thought they knew him at the end
[1:34:34] day and he said I never knew you so the
[1:34:36] biggest thing is does he know you has he
[1:34:38] identified himself with you he says your
[1:34:40] own life proves you haven't got it until
[1:34:43] this is there and God has adopted you
[1:34:45] and sealed you by the Holy Ghost into
[1:34:47] his kingdom then there is no getting out
[1:34:49] of it you are eternally secure believe
[1:34:52] he says grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:34:53] God whereby all you and your Godly
[1:34:56] virtues are sealed until the day of
[1:34:59] redemption he says I believe there's a
[1:35:01] bride that's predestinated I believe God
[1:35:04] said he would have a a church without
[1:35:06] spot or wrinkle I believe in
[1:35:07] predestination that the bride is
[1:35:09] predestinated she's got to be there he
[1:35:12] says I hope I'm with her that see I'm
[1:35:14] with her now it's up to me to work out
[1:35:17] my own salvation with God until these
[1:35:19] things are approved of God and then
[1:35:22] sealed into the kingdom of God there is
[1:35:24] the holy spirit he says there is the
[1:35:26] genuine works of God it's sealed until
[1:35:29] the day of redemption because sealed is
[1:35:31] what it's a it's a completed work it's a
[1:35:33] finished work it's got the the stamp of
[1:35:37] approval he would say add to your faith
[1:35:39] and virtue and so forth all this in
[1:35:41] second Peter I believe the first chapter
[1:35:43] where it's all added to your faith all
[1:35:45] these things godliness Purity Holiness
[1:35:47] everything he says and then you're
[1:35:48] sealed by the Holy Ghost he says it over
[1:35:51] over and over and over and over again
[1:35:54] out of the mouth are two or three
[1:35:55] Witnesses I I pick the best ones to do
[1:35:57] this but he says it over and over again
[1:35:59] there has to be a working to draw out
[1:36:00] the Christian virtues in your life
[1:36:02] before he gives you the Holy
[1:36:03] Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost
[1:36:06] then the Holy Ghost is the living word
[1:36:09] for your
[1:36:11] day because if you have what they have
[1:36:13] on the day of Pentecost under their
[1:36:14] message that ain't going to work today
[1:36:17] we preach the same thing but it has a
[1:36:18] different effect on us cuz they went
[1:36:20] down we go
[1:36:22] up so it's got to be the living word for
[1:36:24] your age which is what it's the word
[1:36:26] made flesh the holy spirit is the word
[1:36:29] made flesh that's what Christ
[1:36:31] was so you've got to be the same thing
[1:36:33] and so it's the life of God in you it's
[1:36:35] the Dynamics of the word of God for your
[1:36:37] age inside of you it's the Living Word
[1:36:39] inside of you it's Christ himself making
[1:36:41] you live what he said would be in this
[1:36:43] age brother B puts it this way all the
[1:36:46] way back in 1955 church he was a prophet
[1:36:49] way before
[1:36:50] 1963
[1:36:51] he says well preaching the word is the
[1:36:54] acorn but making it live is the
[1:36:57] gospel he says that's right if he
[1:37:00] promised the Holy Spirit that's the word
[1:37:03] he says and receiving the holy spirit is
[1:37:06] making it live manifested if he promises
[1:37:09] Blessings by the word then accepting and
[1:37:12] the word and producing what it said is
[1:37:14] the gospel he says go ye into all the
[1:37:17] world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:37:19] Creature so you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:22] what is it you receive the Living
[1:37:25] Word that's what the Holy Ghost is is
[1:37:27] it's the word living in you for your age
[1:37:30] and for your time and that's where you
[1:37:32] live in a place in a way in a place that
[1:37:33] you've never lived
[1:37:35] before absolutely cuz now God's dwelling
[1:37:38] in you now God's dwelling in you you
[1:37:40] have to raise up if God dwells in us and
[1:37:42] nothing changes then what does that tell
[1:37:44] us about God he has no effect he's not
[1:37:48] Supernatural he's not greater than the
[1:37:49] thing that we had before amen
[1:37:51] but doesn't mean you weren't admirable
[1:37:53] doesn't mean you weren't a Christian
[1:37:54] brother BR would never say you weren't a
[1:37:55] Christian but he'd say now you're a true
[1:37:58] Christian now you're the real deal now
[1:38:00] you're the manifested Sons and Daughters
[1:38:02] of God what is it it's not that you
[1:38:05] couldn't be used before and we'll see
[1:38:07] this as we get into adoption now you
[1:38:09] couldn't be a blessing not that you
[1:38:10] didn't have gifts before this but now
[1:38:12] you're placed positionally and now
[1:38:13] you've got what a real job to do you've
[1:38:16] got a real purpose and God starts to use
[1:38:18] you and place you into these different
[1:38:19] things scripture says what sons of God
[1:38:21] are led by the spirit of
[1:38:24] God so if nothing else you're LED
[1:38:26] different than you were LED before you
[1:38:28] could hope for it before this now you
[1:38:30] got it and now there's something in the
[1:38:31] control tower that's moving us around
[1:38:34] now I don't want to give away some of
[1:38:35] the the beautiful things I've been
[1:38:36] studying just yet but we tend to think
[1:38:38] as soon as we're doing the father's
[1:38:39] business see what I say here it says
[1:38:41] doing the father's business but
[1:38:43] underneath I put servant I didn't put
[1:38:45] son because we look at this and we say
[1:38:47] as soon as we're about the father's
[1:38:49] business we're adopted and yet brother
[1:38:51] Brandon would say time and time again
[1:38:53] especially as he preached the message he
[1:38:55] you him many times he would say that
[1:38:56] being about the father's business was
[1:38:58] part of the
[1:39:00] training and he says the the the tutor
[1:39:02] comes back and says he's about your
[1:39:04] father's business he's about your
[1:39:06] business he's about your business over
[1:39:08] and over again and remember he says
[1:39:10] while he's under the tutor he's no
[1:39:11] different than a
[1:39:13] servant so he's not a servant but he's
[1:39:15] no different than a servant you always
[1:39:17] were a son you always were a daughter of
[1:39:19] God but in this form even with the Holy
[1:39:21] H ghost there's still a Time
[1:39:23] approving and for some people it's very
[1:39:25] short and for some people it's very long
[1:39:27] again we'll see this as we get into the
[1:39:28] scriptures amen but in fact the the
[1:39:30] focus of the son on the father's
[1:39:32] business was what determined if he was
[1:39:34] mature enough and ready enough for
[1:39:35] adoption we'll find out as we get into
[1:39:37] this a little bit let's let me talk
[1:39:39] about this a bit as brother BR would say
[1:39:41] he says let God add to the church let
[1:39:43] God give to the church see those gifts
[1:39:45] are in the church right here in this
[1:39:46] morning is Gifts of speaking in tongues
[1:39:48] Gifts of Prophecy there's Gifts of
[1:39:50] everything sitting in here but if you'll
[1:39:52] just not go to hanging after that gift
[1:39:54] he says if you do you're going to get
[1:39:56] the gift without the giver you're going
[1:39:57] to go back to Pentecost I mean Pentecost
[1:39:59] isza Street he says see the thing of it
[1:40:02] is seek after God he says seek after
[1:40:07] love of God in your heart and then as
[1:40:09] God wants you he'll move you into
[1:40:11] whatever he wants you to do see that's
[1:40:14] it that's how the church is put in order
[1:40:16] that's 1954 he says that so we look at
[1:40:19] this let me take us back just for a
[1:40:21] second so when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:40:23] brother Brown says that's when the
[1:40:24] biggest battles start he says you think
[1:40:26] you that it's just a cakewalk or or that
[1:40:28] after the Holy Ghost says no that's when
[1:40:30] it starts because Satan has been kicked
[1:40:31] out of your life the control tower is
[1:40:34] full and it's sealed and he can't get in
[1:40:36] there so Satan knows once you got the
[1:40:38] Holy Ghost what he's dealing with and so
[1:40:40] every gun in Hell Comes now against you
[1:40:42] because you've been identified you got a
[1:40:45] token you've been changed you've been
[1:40:48] sealed and now the holy spirit is
[1:40:49] working through you and so Satan is
[1:40:52] helpless to mess with your soul why cuz
[1:40:54] there's a strong man in the house the
[1:40:56] door is locked he can't get in there and
[1:40:58] so the only thing that Satan's got
[1:41:00] because he can't control you is
[1:41:02] Temptation it's what he did with Jesus
[1:41:05] remember he couldn't control Jesus after
[1:41:06] he got the Holy Ghost but what did he do
[1:41:08] he tempted him to try to get him off of
[1:41:10] his position get him off of his calling
[1:41:12] get him out of his place to a place
[1:41:14] where Satan had
[1:41:17] Authority he tried to get him into the
[1:41:19] worldly side Jesus said said I don't
[1:41:21] need
[1:41:22] it it's not even yours to give to me in
[1:41:24] the first place I'm not going to be
[1:41:26] tempted by that but with us what he
[1:41:27] tries to do is he tries to tempt us away
[1:41:29] from the things of God from our focus
[1:41:31] and our purpose and the kingdom of God
[1:41:33] and when he gets us off of that we're
[1:41:36] powerless because we're not on the word
[1:41:37] anymore we're out of our place we're out
[1:41:39] of our land we're we're off the property
[1:41:41] we don't have a title deed to where
[1:41:43] we're standing so if he can get us off
[1:41:45] of that that's where he can have
[1:41:46] influence he can't get control but he
[1:41:48] can get influence but if we'll stay
[1:41:50] behind the the word if we'll stay
[1:41:52] focused on the word Satan has no power
[1:41:55] remember we have this saying that Idle
[1:41:56] Hands are the devil's
[1:41:58] workshop you get the Holy Ghost and sit
[1:42:00] around look
[1:42:01] out now the Holy Ghost puts you into
[1:42:03] action that's one thing it definitely
[1:42:05] does but you sit around and do that
[1:42:07] Satan will find something for you to do
[1:42:08] and brother Bram says to stay away from
[1:42:09] that seek after
[1:42:12] God don't seek after your gift seek
[1:42:15] after God remember brother Brown we read
[1:42:18] that he read that he says the brothers
[1:42:20] they all got the Holy Ghost and they
[1:42:21] they wrote a letter to brother Bram said
[1:42:22] brother brandom what do we do now do we
[1:42:24] seek after gifts and he says no don't
[1:42:27] seek after gifts you'll just get caught
[1:42:28] up and everything that you were in
[1:42:30] before don't seek after your gift seek
[1:42:32] after God and God will place you God
[1:42:35] will put you in the place that you're
[1:42:36] supposed to what seek to be a place
[1:42:38] where you can help you can edify you can
[1:42:40] encourage you can strengthen you can you
[1:42:42] can do something that'll be of of good
[1:42:44] and value to the kingdom of God Amen
[1:42:46] don't seek what you want seek what he
[1:42:48] wants in other words seek his will and
[1:42:51] you do that and he sees that you're
[1:42:53] focused on what he wants rather than
[1:42:55] what you want and we come to this
[1:42:56] pivotal place which is called
[1:42:58] adoption now adoption I don't again I
[1:43:00] don't want to give on everything but
[1:43:02] you'll see here that I've separated the
[1:43:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:43:05] infilling of the Holy Ghost from
[1:43:07] adoption and we'll see there that there
[1:43:08] are people that it was the exact same
[1:43:10] thing it happened in the exact same
[1:43:12] moment and I'll give a bit of it away
[1:43:14] Peter on the day of Pentecost he gets
[1:43:15] the Holy Ghost and he's adopted and he's
[1:43:17] placed immediately and he comes down
[1:43:18] he's got the Keys of the Kingdom he's
[1:43:19] got full Authority it happened right
[1:43:21] there then you look at Paul Paul gets
[1:43:23] the Holy Ghost and he gets taken out in
[1:43:24] the in the backside of the desert for
[1:43:25] three years he's been positionally
[1:43:27] placed as a prophet but he can't be a
[1:43:29] prophet yet because he's got to be
[1:43:30] trained the Holy Spirit has to go out
[1:43:32] and teach him so he has the Holy Ghost
[1:43:33] but he goes out for three and a half
[1:43:35] years and what he's not doing anything
[1:43:37] he's just a preacher he's not a prophet
[1:43:40] he's a preacher he's not positionally
[1:43:42] placed yet in what God wants him to be
[1:43:45] then we see with Jesus brother Braham
[1:43:46] says he gets the Holy Ghost and he
[1:43:47] doesn't get adopted until he's up on
[1:43:48] Mount Transfiguration there's a span of
[1:43:50] time in there and we'll get into that in
[1:43:52] more detail amen but God is Sovereign
[1:43:55] God chooses those things it's not up for
[1:43:57] me to say if you say brother John I was
[1:43:59] adopted the minute I got the Holy Ghost
[1:44:00] I say praise the Lord that's between you
[1:44:02] and God it's not between me and you and
[1:44:05] if you say I haven't been adopted yet
[1:44:06] even though I got the Holy Ghost I say
[1:44:07] that's between you and God but all I can
[1:44:10] say is what as soon as you get the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost you can be
[1:44:13] adopted and that's between you and God
[1:44:15] that's the only place I can go what
[1:44:17] adoption is placing you in your position
[1:44:20] in the king om of God it's setting where
[1:44:22] you where you can do the most damage to
[1:44:23] Satan's kingdom and the most benefit to
[1:44:25] God's kingdom damage to Satan benefit to
[1:44:28] God brother BR says it this way he says
[1:44:30] I got better hopes of you Brethren
[1:44:32] sitting here this morning that you'll be
[1:44:33] men of God who stay with the word of God
[1:44:36] and let everything else fall right to
[1:44:37] left but stay right with that word don't
[1:44:40] move no matter if you're a doormat out
[1:44:42] there be a good
[1:44:44] doormat David said I'd rather be a
[1:44:47] doormat as long as I can be in the house
[1:44:50] of God God he says don't try to compete
[1:44:53] with someone else or do
[1:44:57] this just get right in the word and stay
[1:45:00] right there and God will positionally
[1:45:03] place you into his kingdom where you can
[1:45:06] be the best where you can be the best
[1:45:10] where you can be the best where you can
[1:45:12] be the best he places you where you can
[1:45:15] be the best you don't choose you don't
[1:45:18] pick you don't influence if he does it
[1:45:21] he does a perfect work and you'll be the
[1:45:22] best you could ever be if you'll
[1:45:24] surrender to his leading in the way he
[1:45:25] does it
[1:45:26] amen he says he will do the same for you
[1:45:30] if you'll stand after you receive the
[1:45:32] Holy Ghost make yourself a Christian and
[1:45:35] act like a Christian should how does a
[1:45:36] Christian act sons of God are led by the
[1:45:39] spirit of God if you'll obey the
[1:45:41] leadership of the Holy Spirit doing what
[1:45:42] God wants you to do he'll take you and
[1:45:44] he'll place you he says if you'll put
[1:45:45] your face in God's word your eyes
[1:45:48] towards heaven and let your pants legs
[1:45:49] be bagged at the knees now do we know
[1:45:51] what that
[1:45:52] means how do your pants legs get
[1:45:55] bagged you can see I don't pray in my
[1:45:58] suit CU what happens is when you bow it
[1:46:02] stretches your
[1:46:03] knees and if I stay there long enough
[1:46:05] what happens is if I'd stood up and
[1:46:07] you'd see a big baggy section sticking
[1:46:10] right at my knees and ruin my pants
[1:46:12] brother says get that way get to praying
[1:46:16] get to seeking get to looking for
[1:46:19] leadership and then God will place
[1:46:21] you I I don't understand people that
[1:46:24] make
[1:46:25] decisions and you say how did you make
[1:46:27] it I it just
[1:46:30] happened how can we do that we're Sons
[1:46:33] and Daughters of God and we're not
[1:46:34] praying and making sure we get clear
[1:46:36] direction from God how are we making big
[1:46:39] moves jobs careers whatever it might be
[1:46:43] places churches pastors Whatever It Is
[1:46:46] Well that's just what turned up no no
[1:46:49] you got to be led and you got to know
[1:46:50] you're LED because the first thing
[1:46:52] that'll happen is Satan will put a
[1:46:53] roadblock in your way or put a hardship
[1:46:54] in your way and you're out the window
[1:46:56] you're out the door you're running away
[1:46:58] cuz why you didn't have leadership in
[1:46:59] the first place you weren't convinced of
[1:47:01] the leading of God and so you don't have
[1:47:03] any ties you don't have anything to hold
[1:47:05] you there but here's the other thing
[1:47:07] I've learned if I make the wrong
[1:47:09] decision be quick say I made that one
[1:47:13] without you lord don't pretend it it's
[1:47:17] the I'll say this in my life perhaps the
[1:47:20] greatest sign of a religious spirit in
[1:47:22] my life is when I Won't Back Down on a
[1:47:23] decision that I know was
[1:47:26] wrong if I know I messed up and I refuse
[1:47:29] to acknowledge it that's
[1:47:31] pride and God can't work with
[1:47:35] that and so I've had to be able to
[1:47:37] acknowledge I didn't make that decision
[1:47:39] with you
[1:47:41] Lord CU what fruit of it ain't of
[1:47:44] you I've had to walk it back say that
[1:47:47] one's on me head of the house all comes
[1:47:50] back to
[1:47:54] me he says let your pant legs be bagged
[1:47:56] at the knees be reverent before God
[1:47:59] there'll be someday that God will take
[1:48:01] you over to his side and give you a
[1:48:03] power and a gift that the whole world
[1:48:06] will know he's been with you he says
[1:48:08] that's placing a son to his position he
[1:48:11] says
[1:48:12] hallelujah now we think this is going to
[1:48:14] be some big show brother B said the
[1:48:16] third poll is not a public show he said
[1:48:18] the bride Revival is not a public
[1:48:21] show so don't expect all of us to be
[1:48:23] going around clearing out the graveyards
[1:48:24] and clearing out hospitals and bringing
[1:48:27] limbs back and speak no no no no no
[1:48:29] brother Bram only had spoken word a
[1:48:30] couple times in his life and every time
[1:48:32] he did it the holy spirit said it's up
[1:48:35] to you now brother bam didn't decide
[1:48:37] when he was going to have spoken word
[1:48:38] Authority brother Ram didn't decide when
[1:48:40] the third poll was going to go into
[1:48:41] action God told him it's up to you and
[1:48:45] what was it every time it was because
[1:48:47] brother brandham had the character to do
[1:48:49] the right thing
[1:48:51] every time remember he's in the meeting
[1:48:53] and the couple is making out on the
[1:48:54] front row or near the front wherever it
[1:48:57] was how many preachers would let them
[1:48:59] sit there and do it the way brother
[1:49:01] Braham said he said I personal pronoun
[1:49:05] forgive
[1:49:07] you but don't do it
[1:49:09] again we'd be yelling at the deacons
[1:49:12] we'd be calling out fire from heaven on
[1:49:14] them we'd be sending them to Hell
[1:49:16] brother Bram said I forgive
[1:49:18] you but don't do it again why cuz the
[1:49:21] holy spirit said there's a trap laid for
[1:49:23] you
[1:49:24] tonight whatever he said was going to
[1:49:27] happen to them he had spoken word
[1:49:29] authority over their Eternal
[1:49:32] destination and what was it he was a
[1:49:34] servant of love and so he brought Mercy
[1:49:35] before
[1:49:36] judgment it reminds me so often of the
[1:49:39] Suns of Thunder and the first thing they
[1:49:42] wanted was judgment that's how Christ
[1:49:45] knew they weren't
[1:49:47] ready adopted Sons don't come out with
[1:49:49] Jud judgement it's Mercy every time
[1:49:53] first cuz the spirit and the bride are
[1:49:55] saying come judgment follows doesn't
[1:49:59] lead but what is it brother Brandon
[1:50:02] wasn't just walking around speaking
[1:50:03] these things into existence but when he
[1:50:05] spoke it was by what inspiration of the
[1:50:07] Holy Spirit and by an authority given to
[1:50:10] him rather than an authority taken by
[1:50:13] him God says whatever you say it'll
[1:50:15] happen your wife she's going in she's
[1:50:17] got this tumor whatever you say will
[1:50:18] happen he says before the surgeon
[1:50:20] touches her it'll fall away and be gone
[1:50:22] and it happened just like it he's
[1:50:24] speaking to the squirrels he says
[1:50:25] whatever you say there they'll be and he
[1:50:27] picked all the worst spots where those
[1:50:28] squirrels would not be and he spoke them
[1:50:30] into
[1:50:31] existence what is it the storm speaking
[1:50:34] it out of existence what is it God
[1:50:36] moving on him to speak not him just
[1:50:38] walking around doing whatever he wanted
[1:50:40] so under adoption you are still under
[1:50:42] and we'll get to the quote here in a
[1:50:43] second you're still under Authority but
[1:50:46] you have authority and it's given by God
[1:50:48] you have a place and a purpose purp and
[1:50:50] a standing and within there you have a
[1:50:52] certain amount of authority Peter had it
[1:50:54] at the gate beautiful such as I have
[1:50:56] give I unto thee but he was inspired to
[1:50:58] do it that's what people don't realize
[1:51:00] Paul had it when he cast The Demon out
[1:51:02] of that girl with a familiar Spirit she
[1:51:03] was a she was a fortune teller remember
[1:51:05] and Paul waited for two days before he
[1:51:08] cast that demon out you go look what
[1:51:10] brother Brown says brother Brown says he
[1:51:11] waited till the Holy Spirit told him to
[1:51:13] do it for two days he let that girl
[1:51:16] harass
[1:51:17] them draw attention to them maybe that
[1:51:19] they didn't want and then he turned
[1:51:20] around and he said come out of her why
[1:51:23] he's an adopted son of God but he's
[1:51:25] still under
[1:51:26] Authority none of us takes headship over
[1:51:28] Christ none of us takes headship over
[1:51:30] the Christ that means none of us take
[1:51:33] headship over the
[1:51:34] word butam says it this way he says then
[1:51:38] when that son was adopted or placed
[1:51:40] positionally into the kingdom he was a
[1:51:42] coair he had was just as much Authority
[1:51:45] as what his father had he could bind
[1:51:49] turn loose
[1:51:50] do whatever he wished to because he had
[1:51:53] already been recognized and adopted and
[1:51:55] positionally placed and we'd all put a
[1:51:57] period right there but he says what
[1:51:59] positionally placed under the authority
[1:52:03] they're still ahead and it's still
[1:52:05] Christ and then we still have a headship
[1:52:07] in our life and it's the Holy Spirit but
[1:52:09] everything we're doing is by the Holy
[1:52:11] Spirit through the holy spirit it's not
[1:52:13] us that does it it's never us that does
[1:52:15] it it can never be us that does it amen
[1:52:18] what is it you went from doing the
[1:52:20] father's business now you're running the
[1:52:22] father's business you're the son now you
[1:52:25] went from being like a servant now
[1:52:26] you're the adopted son now you're the
[1:52:27] place son what is it now you're his
[1:52:29] hands now you're his feet now you're his
[1:52:33] voice now you're his preacher now you're
[1:52:35] all of these different things now you're
[1:52:37] his and it's him working through you why
[1:52:39] because we're
[1:52:40] amazing
[1:52:42] fabulous no because we're humble to the
[1:52:45] word that's what gets us to that as we
[1:52:47] humble ourselves to the word God tells
[1:52:49] you what to do and you do it by faith
[1:52:52] and you leave the results to him I love
[1:52:53] what brother Daryl Ward said he says
[1:52:55] it's not my it's not up to me to heal
[1:52:56] him he says it's up to me to pray for
[1:52:59] them says the prayer of faith shall save
[1:53:01] the
[1:53:02] sick it's not it's not up to me to make
[1:53:04] them better it's up to me to pray the
[1:53:06] prayer of faith it's up to him to heal
[1:53:08] him so you do the
[1:53:10] work he gets the result that's what it
[1:53:13] means to be an adopted son and daughter
[1:53:15] of God you do what he says and he comes
[1:53:17] behind it and he backs you up and that's
[1:53:19] what you find time and time again
[1:53:20] brother BR would say when you say
[1:53:22] something happens it happens that's how
[1:53:24] you know you're in an adopted state is
[1:53:26] when you pray when you ask when you
[1:53:28] believe it
[1:53:29] happens it happens what is it you're
[1:53:32] running his business but you're still
[1:53:34] under his authority why you've got a
[1:53:36] vision you've got a word you've got a
[1:53:38] direction you've got all of these
[1:53:39] different things that are working to
[1:53:40] bring you to the place where you're
[1:53:42] focused and you can do exactly what God
[1:53:43] wants you to do and what is it it's the
[1:53:45] message of the hour it's the word for
[1:53:47] your age that's what it is that that's
[1:53:49] why we preach what a prophet taught us
[1:53:52] is cuz that's the voice to our age and
[1:53:54] it's focusing us on the father's
[1:53:55] business that we're supposed to be
[1:53:57] getting into these things and we do all
[1:53:59] of those things we do all of those
[1:54:01] things there's only one thing left and
[1:54:03] that's at the very end that's a
[1:54:04] Rapture and that's his
[1:54:07] call that's his time it's his Spirit
[1:54:11] remember scripture says if the same
[1:54:13] spirit that dwelt in Christ dwells in
[1:54:15] you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:54:18] amen You' got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:21] you've got to be placed and then after
[1:54:23] that you're a candidate for the Rapture
[1:54:26] some of us will go by way of the Grave
[1:54:28] Same Spirit same effect you still get to
[1:54:30] go in the End Amen but it's him that's
[1:54:33] working inside of us amen it takes us to
[1:54:34] meet him with the air that's our full
[1:54:36] adoption that Paul would talk about he
[1:54:38] says to wit the Redemption of our
[1:54:41] bodies that's how you get the Holy Ghost
[1:54:44] that's the Walk of a Christian believer
[1:54:46] laid out in hopefully a simple easy
[1:54:50] graph amen God bless you let's stand if
[1:54:53] we
[1:54:57] would like I said and I appreciate it I
[1:55:00] was glad sister Justine walked in at the
[1:55:01] end where she did I feel for the young
[1:55:03] people and you know being raised in the
[1:55:06] message and and we've heard lots of
[1:55:08] things preached and we've heard great
[1:55:09] doctrines and great truths and and it
[1:55:11] can turn into this big thing and
[1:55:14] remember brother Bram says all he's
[1:55:15] looking for is surrendered Hearts he's
[1:55:18] not looking for great intellect
[1:55:20] he's not holding you accountable for
[1:55:22] every great revelation of every this and
[1:55:24] that and the other you don't have to be
[1:55:26] able to explain the Seven Seals you
[1:55:28] don't have to be able to explain every
[1:55:29] mystery of God but what you have to be
[1:55:31] is a mystery revealed in your own life
[1:55:33] you have to be a word living out and
[1:55:35] that comes only through humbling
[1:55:37] yourself to the word surrendering
[1:55:39] yourself to God and then he does
[1:55:41] everything else it's his work it's his
[1:55:43] promise it's his word it's his plan it's
[1:55:46] his will it's his love it's his grace
[1:55:48] it's his Mercy it's him from start to
[1:55:50] end he's just looking for people that'll
[1:55:51] believe it take it apply it work with it
[1:55:56] and he does the rest the word's got
[1:55:59] power behind it the word's got all the
[1:56:01] power we need all you need to do is let
[1:56:03] it have its way amen and then God sees
[1:56:05] us through amen let's bow our heads if
[1:56:07] we would Heavenly
[1:56:11] Father Lord you are so
[1:56:13] gracious Lord you are so good and Lord
[1:56:17] we look at these things Lord we look at
[1:56:18] this Supernatural promise Lord of a
[1:56:20] bride that's going to be spotless and
[1:56:22] without wrinkle Lord that's going to do
[1:56:24] the very works of Christ Lord and we say
[1:56:26] how can these things
[1:56:28] be Lord and maybe like Mary we Ponder
[1:56:31] them in our heart Lord but we kept
[1:56:33] walking towards it we kept believing
[1:56:35] Lord we kept looking we keep trusting
[1:56:38] Lord I'm praying that you'll help our
[1:56:39] faith to just rise to the challenge
[1:56:41] Heavenly Father Lord that we'll seek
[1:56:43] after you Lord that we'll keep our face
[1:56:45] in your word Lord that we'll keep our
[1:56:47] eyes towards you Lord that we'll
[1:56:49] separate that will sanctify Our Lives of
[1:56:51] these things Lord so that you can come
[1:56:53] in and dwell within us Lord in a greater
[1:56:55] way than we've ever had before Lord
[1:56:57] we're trusting you to take us through
[1:56:59] Lord we know we're on a journey Lord
[1:57:01] we're creatures of Time Lord but we're
