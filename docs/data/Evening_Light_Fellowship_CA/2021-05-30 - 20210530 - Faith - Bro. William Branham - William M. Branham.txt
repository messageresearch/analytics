[Music] [Music] amen yes praise the lord amen change to sing his praise praise train to acknowledge him train to worship him amen brother that's what he wants and he knows he's not going to get it here completely that's why he promised to take us back amen by the grace of god and i trust we know that we are on our way home i trust we know that we're closer to home than all than any of the others amen brother god did this and they did that god did this they did that but brother god comes down and he puts the fullness of the word in that bride amen so we're not just believing that luther did that's good but we believe as he did but when it comes to what what god asked him to believe amen to give him the faith that please god in that day amen so it please god in wesley's day in the old fashioned salvation army day that pleased god 100 years ago in the pentecostal revival but brother what pleases god today amen brother what pleases god to see in you and me what he's done and what he's doing amen so it's not just again it's not just to start a religion no no it's just it's oh yeah all the other from back they started this they started this they started this faith this this religion and so on but this will come to the hour now in this in these last days that what god has done what god is doing amen is not to start anything is to get away from the starting idea amen because that's time we're going to eternity and god is putting us more and more and more in contact with eternity amen because i don't have a jew but i i'm sick and tired of seeing what i'm seeing out there amen and hearing what i'm hearing out there and because it's all what man has done what man is doing and so on but again like god said to israel and he said he was going to come down and judge israel he said they made many inventions but i'm going to take their inventions away amen is going to destroy their inventions and we put too much emphasis on the inventions of man we want to do this we want to do that look where's our faith amen where is our faith because if we're cut off in faith we won't be caught up in the avengers the inventions of man amen no no we feel oh this is wonderful that's why yeah it is but understand dude it's not god it's the devil amen he he comes with that knowledge in their head but god comes for the revelation in your heart god is not impressed with what you've got in your head god's impressed what's in your heart amen god's not using our heads god not moving there god is moving down here and of course he's got to be down here to control your spirit and he's got to be down here to control what what the devil is trying to influence you in your mind amen remember that's what he's how he started in the garden of eden oh yeah he just too intellectually he remember satan in the in the serpent was the first evangelist he was an evangelist oh yes he was going around seeing what they believed regarding what god did and so on and so oh when he got to eve he knew that he's going to he's going to weaken her weaken her faith challenge her faith and so on so brother i pressed by the grace of god he's not finding that in you and me amen where when it comes to the devil i trust that brother he's he's going to he's going to be recognizing the faith that pleases god in you and in me and again that's why he has come down with great wrath great wrath knowing his time is short so brother i pray grace that we're not going to get caught up with what the devil's doing up there let's get caught up raptured with what god has done and with what god is doing in you and me do god be the glory praise the lord so the lord bless us as we go to the word and just to highlight again that brother tom snow amen we thought he was gone for quite a while now but he's not he's still fighting that's his nature amen when it comes to if he got any idea at all that this is the devil that's the devil get away satan amen and he's by grace through faith in jesus he's endeavoring to conquer the world the flesh and the devil amen so and i remember the like uh he's a real good soldier and uh not sure how long ago it was now that we that our brother claude gale died uh out in deer lake i believe it was at corner brook in corner brook i think it was a hospital there and of course we had the funeral service in the funeral home in deer lake and then we had to drive a couple of hours to to bishop falls to bury brother cloud in the cemetery there and i remember that when we were going through the ceremony of committing the body back to the dust and so on that i noticed brother tom was there oh yes it wasn't his fault if he didn't notice him amen because he was going around and all while we were ministering and even while a pentecostal brother was there with a piano accordion and anyone and he sang a special oh he really appreciated it and of course there was a pentecostal pastor there as well so we thank god for their help but brother brother and tom well praise the lord for him the most important one was jesus amen and so brother tom was going around uh oh my going around all the the people that were in the inside the garden i was just standing outside the garden and he was going around with books message books of the prophet and he was given to give him this one give him that one give that one yeah so i said lord i said bless our brother amen because he was really caught up with the word really oh my he was really zealous with the things of god and i said lord we need we need some of that zealousness in us amen we need something oh yeah thank god for the zeal i heard uh in in the song service it was good praise the lord you don't get that too often and certainly certainly there's not many brother ted's around amen there was one time oh yes and they were singing and shouting and so on but again in this hour goddess but wants wants what he wants us to get the faith that's going to make us sing cause us to sing causes to worship amen and saying i came across just recently on the internet there was i was searching for something else and i came across a certain church and i said who in the world are they and this was absolutely amazing i don't know who they are what they believe but and then they they definitely weren't message believers and so on but oh my they had this uh there was an old man there he was an old preacher and he was and he was just going around you know because he was bowed down because of his age and weak because of his age but he was behind the pulpit and he was agreement the word oh yeah he screamed the word then the then this young young fella took over and it seemed like he was an assistant pastor there oh my and he was running around and he framed and screamed and screamed and screamed and bro yeah but it wasn't just him because it went all through the audience all through the congregation and and you heard this one singing and shouting and dancing oh yeah up and down up and down up and down and then there were then there was even senior citizens there and these these elderly women and elderly brothers there and they were they were oh my not not in the pulpit they were in front of the pope and they just run and run and they run across they run down go across come back all they're going around and around and around the audience i said lord i said who in the world are they amen that's rare that i've seen that even in messy churches rare that i've seen that even in maybe a pentecostal church but they were just so on fire and even young people on the platform they were up and down up and down up and down praising the lord and even the young ones that were doing the organs and pianos well they oh yeah bang bang bang bang bang and yeah and and you could oh yeah and then they would step away and they'd jump up and down amen so it's been true it's tremendous i said oh my look at those senior citizens and some of them very old but i tell you not too old to worship god amen amen not too old to do this and do that and they were numbered with those that were coming up the aisle running in front of the altar going down again and come back and go around and round and round screaming praising the lord and singing amen brother brother chad would feel right at all amen but i think he would stand out as well again because i saw young people there on the platform and well i did maybe 30s and 20s and and they were jumping up and down up and down up and down they're singing a certain song and i said lord who in the world are they and i said lord i pray your grace i said take them out to the truth take them on to the revealed word so brother look up because our redemption draw at nine amen we're not going to please man we'll please god amen sorry brother and if you're born of god you'll be pleased amen so i pray god bless that church no doubt they're gathering somewhere today there's a number of them i think churches in the united states i don't know if there's any here in canada or not but god bless them but like i said don't look down just leave them because if they're not bride they're outside the city oh yeah don't think because when it comes to what god has done and what god is doing in the special word that he brings forth in every age is to separate the bride from the rest because the bride goes into the marriage supper but the others are going to be outside the city and i thank god for that revelation i'll tell you because that's why i like i said i had to preach that what i preached first when i came to the word and it was to try and change their ideas and their attitudes because there was a lot of believers i met and they were just looking down their noses at people out there in in pentecost or salvation army or this church or that church see and and so they they were again i guess calling the them rickeys and richards oh that's all they are they're not believers they're not this they're not that well brother only only the real believers of the message is going for to be part of the bride what about those outside the city amen so we've got to understand what god has done and what is god doing so he's called you but who are you are you going to be in the city or outside the city so brother keep your edges right there goes you but for the grace of god amen oh yeah thank god and brother what i know and what you know and the revelation that god has given us is all grace amen it's grace and brother if we recognize anything it is grace because we gotta recognize that grace to get the faith it is by grace through faith amen praise the lord it is grace projecting divine love and divine love giving us the result of the faith that we need amen should you have the faith you need i just say oh yeah i agree with i agree with the preacher yeah i got that faith he says what i what i believe he says to when i agree with it no his brother it's got more than that it's believing jesus amen and believing that jesus is here amen amen it wasn't william branham it was jesus they probably said you don't understand that he said you don't he said you're not getting it and again one place is not he said it's not striking me right and he said i know it's not striking you right amen well because what god the faith that god gave what is god going to accomplish with that faith brother are we getting more and more rapture conscious or just conscious of doctrines no no i trust by grace it's the rapture because god showed luther this and this and this concerning a lot of teachings in the catholic church and it was false false false false but then god got him to the revelation of justification amen not do this and do this do this god i want you to believe this god wants you to believe his word believe see when even when when martha was at the tomb there and he said he's going to rise again believe us thou this amen she believed that and believe that and believe that the past and oh god's going to do this but he said i am the resurrection not i will be i am and he said he said believe us now this that lazarus will come for. oh she said i believe you'll come forth in the resurrection oh he said i am the resurrection that's right amen the resurrection was not there the resurrection was stood there talking to her amen amen and the rapture and the change and being cut away with the with the in the marriage supper of the lamb oh brother it's it's not just an idea well that's up there no we're getting into it now amen remember again they're in the book of luke and it says go forth and call these to the marriage supper and oh no they made this excuse and that excuse and brother that's the problem even believers are making excuses why they don't go to church yeah uh no brother if god is in you you're hungry and thirst for it amen amen most definitely should the grace of god be with us as we will this morning go into a ministry of the message by brother branham and it is it is called faith pay i got about 14 or 15 sermons in there booklets faith that he preached the number of times of course he preaches many many sermons on faith that's right and these are just a 14 ones that stood out and some of the ones there's one as i printed myself finding them in the in the program there of all the messages and you can print them amen so i pray god amen brother all of it is faith faith faith oh god preached this and god and the and the prophet preached this and the prophet preached that that's good but you got to let it go take the revelation to your heart not your head too many got the revelation in their heads but not in the heart amen brother because why it was in our souls in our hearts is god in control amen and whatever you do it's not you it's god amen whatever you do when you see mice again like the bible says it's not me that lives it's christ that liveth in me if christ living in you he's controlling you amen well although i just felt to do this i just felt to do that you felt to do it are you sure that it was you or just god or jesus amen so brother i pray the grace of god help us that we're going again like i said to make our calling election sure is make sure we're in the right faith amen the faith that god has given us and god is giving us amen and god is continuing to work on that faith praise the lord so that one day it'll strike it the way you god wants it to strike you amen so brother to some or it was a change of doctrines change this change that oh yeah so they just went from the church they ran to another church oh yeah because they're preaching the word there yeah what what what effect is that having in your life amen is it christ in you the hope of glory amen so brother because jesus again they tried to prove the synagogue tried to prove a trinity in john's gospel there because as i said uh i sent addresses and put they're different things to a lot of preachers around the world and i got i received an email back from one of them there and he said oh he said you brother and he said you don't believe in the trinity and he said i'll prove the trinity to you and he's and he went to saint john's gospel he said see he said i'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter and that that was his proof of trinity the father another comforter the holy ghost and jesus said i'll pray the verb the first one second one third one i said brother thank you but i said you need to go back to that that scripture again and i said why don't you read another four or five verses i said because he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you amen so i said who's the comforter i said it's jesus i said he went he went from one phase of his ministry to another amen it's the same one by the grace of god so i said brother do you believe in a trinity that's i said that's no proof of trinity amen might be trinity newfoundland just a town so we believe that but not but not a trinity in the bible praise the lord so god bless us turn we meet at saint mark's gospel st mark did the song service now we'll read amen saint mark chapter 11. i'm glad to have our brother chad back here again amen yeah we miss him no trouble to miss him amen if you don't hear him it's not his fault amen so god's grace be with you our brother chad and family amen in saint mary's gospel and chapter 11 and verse start with verse 11. and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about all things and now the even tide was come he went out onto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if aptly he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it amen and they came to jerusalem and went and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers brother we use the temple for the grace of god the glory of god amen and it says over through the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold dogs and remembering when we were in our trip to israel and we were being driven around a certain area and we passed down a certain street and there was renovating there's something going on in another building there and our and our jewish tour guide said oh he said see that he said that's where jesus cast them out he said many years ago he said at the temple because they're making your jews using the temple to make money and he said i'll be honest he said jesus needs to do it again he said cast them out amen so he he was a he was a jewish tour guide but again he really he really respected us and even thanked us for our prayers for him amen because god delivered him from a habit that he was in and of course that brother now is i guess in his 80s but i still occasionally get emails from him amen he's still on the go praise the lord and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and over through the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves amen we're not here to sell it you're to give it amen and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves amen and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and sought out they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people were astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots amen and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god amen speak it and believe that god is going to do it amen and also turn with me to rev to hebrews rather the book of hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 praise the lord and again beginning to read at verse 1. now he said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen what you're hoping for and what you what you're not seeing with your natural eyes you see by faith amen because faith reveals it in our hearts and brother something that struck me in some study again this week past week was was the faith in the old testament because noah moses adam they all live by faith abraham uh isaac jacob they're all live by faith you talk about it go go read the bible and brother no matter what happened god was in control amen god told them do this do this do this and they did it amen they were controlled soul body and spirit by god amen they had the faith that pleased god amen and he said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report faith you obtain a good report from god by faith amen god is looking for is faith not just an intellectual knowledge of doctrines no he wants well you heard it you believe this message you believe that message you believe this doctrine that doctrine yeah what's it doing for you amen do you have control of it does it control you amen faith is god in you in control again okay is that right is that scripture yes because it's not me and not you that lives it's christ liveth in you amen let's believe that it's god in you hearing the word is god in you responding to the word yeah well thank god for brother chad amen oh yes so again don't well if he could normally he could say oh no i i better not do that might much noise god lord no no you can't make enough too much noise from god amen because you go into you're going to the temple of god they had they had this instrument this instrument that instrument amen they're playing their instruments and they're praising the lord and they're worshiping god amen oh no brother is out of the heart god god is pleased amen god oh my you're worshiping amen you worship god god help us amen and again it says for by it the elders obtained a good report faith oh my brother if any hour any age that god's looking for a good report this is our right amen we come down to the end grace that we recognize the end of all things grace that we know we're living in the hour of the resurrection and the rapture amen when i just saw the word we believe it we believe it and it's like certain churches are going to have their special service in a certain in a cemetery this cemetery that cemetery another cemetery oh yeah nobody there because it's all dust amen by the grace of god brother when it comes to again sister sadie we go where where she where she was buried well no she's not there that's right where is she oh she's in glory amen because god cursed this body amen where's the life it's in the soul and you're in contact with your theophany body praise the name of the lord amen god help us to believe it but as i said i've been in my mind in my heart for quite a while just thinking i said lord what's heaven going to be this heaven's going to be tremendous new heaven and new earth is going to be tremendous i said we're going to walk on this earth and there's no thoughts of sin there's nothing nothing nothing negative everything is positive amen oh yeah god's why because i tell you well what redeems us oh well how are we going to appreciate god and so on well we have faith in god because of what god has done why he has done it when we get there but when we're going to manifest it okay we're going to live the life that he that he purchased for us at calvary amen and brother we don't want to remember this remember that remember no by the grace of god amen we're going to be so grateful for thankful because of the atmosphere and everything is positive nothing negative you know and we're not going to remember the sin and all that because god don't even remember it it's cast into the sea of forgetfulness and people think when we get to heaven we're going to we're still going to remember this remember this we're going to remember this one or that one well no not by any means it's like again there's a number of young people that went beyond the curtain of time and they met family there but they didn't know who they were and you don't know me no i i'm your sister but again remember that's only been revealed to them in that way so as to give them an understanding when they come back amen because when we when we get out of here forget it this would be the name of the lord because again oh yeah you're only going to remember your wife your wife's going to remember you the husband and so on well yeah if it's the will of god if that's the right mate but if you don't get the right mate here you've got you're going to get in there by the grace of god amen because john john wesley he was one of the messengers that we could highlight and say he didn't get the right mate here he didn't no no in fact after he was into the ministry still so long he had to separate himself from her oh yeah brother again if again trusting you just trust and leave that with the lord amen amen god allowed it for a reason so we're going to have because there's again there's people asking the questions recently or will we recognize everybody in in in in glory we recognize this one this one recognize them you will have a revelation that dear your brothers and sisters in christ amen you have a revelation that oh that yes you're the bride they're the bride amen by the grace of god but again no brother people think we're going to remember this and that brother to do that we'd have to remember sin yeah and there's not going to be any thoughts of sin anything to look at nothing sinful it's all righteous by the grace of god amen god give us that faith let's see god what is it doing it's creating us a hunger and thirst we can't we can't take any longer and that's why like jesus like i said jesus said how much longer shall i be with you why he wanted to get out he couldn't take it no longer grace how much longer will we be here lord grace to get us out well the grace is the grace is giving us the faith to take us out amen and it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen praise the lord by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and just think as i preached years ago in empire avenue church and we had a visitor there that just dropped in and he appreciated it oh he said brother he said i never heard that before he said but you're right you're right i said which church would you go to i said would you go to abel's church or would you go to keynes and i was explaining in the sermon well if you went to abel's church this is what you're going to see and you went to king's church oh it was beautiful oh my he had it all there on the altar all the everything that he had grown in his yard oh my god given this to the lord given it to the lord and i said oh yeah but if we don't go to cain's abel's church no it's not a church of them i mean with blood blood here blood there and blood on abel that's god's church yeah it was god's church amen so i said which one would you go to and he said you're right brother you're right because he spoke to me after the sermon after the service and so on god rest god bless him and maybe rest his soul by the grace of god amen because i tell you god when it comes to god he don't reveal to him he's not revealing himself to us in our heads nobody in our hearts and through his word amen so god help us that we'll believe god we'll offer the sacrifice the right sacrifice as abel did not thank us it's got to be beautiful it's got to be this it's got to be that no amen we're coming forth in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and it says by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous amen so are you righteous you if you are you will offer the right sacrifice amen and it says he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by hit he being dead yet speaketh praise the lord amen your faith goes on and on and on one generation to another so by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god amen do you have that testimony that you please god oh well i believe the message what but do you believe it in the way that god wants you to believe it amen because again like i said he told his own church the message is it you know you're in the message but the message is not in you amen in in the heart oh yeah god help us why because how do god know it because you're not living the life of faith that the message will if it's in your heart if it's in your heart it controls you soul body spirit amen controls your spirit controls your soul amen controlling you even your body by the grace of god amen grace to us amen that we have the faith giving jesus control that's why it's not you that lives it's jesus living in you amen praise the lord and brother he raptured some of the saints back then he resurrected them and raptured them so brother now he's with us and then us what do what's he doing he's resurrecting us you know out of dead denominationalism amen oh yeah he's resurrecting us and he's and what's he doing he's rapturing us getting us caught up by the grace of god amen god help us that we're not just in religion no no it's the word of god in us and again as the prophet of god did say he says not striking me the way it should not striking you the way it should amen but there's going to rise a generation and it would strike them the way it should praise the lord grace so he said without faith it is impossible to please him do you please him not your emotions not your feelings it's your faith amen does do you please god in what you do what you don't do do you please god and in in in the witness that you give and how you give it and so on is god in control of you morning noon and night amen if god's in control there's not you i tell you you can't do this do this go here go there without talking to him oh yeah you talk to him every day you talk to him when you're when you're when you're driving your vehicle you can talk to jesus when you're when you're going and do this go and do that even if you're at work oh yeah oh i'm doing this i'm doing that well i'll tell you you'll never forget jesus because if you've got to make a decision i got to do this oh lord i need your help yeah where'd that come from it was a conviction in your heart and jesus is waiting for you to say it the manifestation of your faith no matter what it what goes on in your life if you've got faith you won't leave him out of it lord we need your leadership lord what should i do lord what should i say help me lord or if something happens and then this happens and oh it's and it's real good to you say thank you jesus you can't if you're a christian if you're born again you've got his nature in you and he's there all the time to talk to you yeah god help us oh no no i gotta be praying to talk to him no no you walk talk to jesus sit down talk to jesus go doing your work oh thank you lord oh yeah i mean many times have you said thank you lord today how many times you say thank you lord in a day yeah because you know i can't do nothing without him but with him all things are possible amen that's all such as the relationship between us and jesus no wonder he's putting the emphasis on faith amen because it brings into a relationship with him and it maintains that relationship morning noon night every second of the day amen god just think would you do this that the prophet did when he as i mentioned before when brother billy paul went to get to brother branham and to say brother uh you're you're waiting for you at the pulpit and when he did brother brown was in in the room on his knees in prayer and he was saying lord oh i'm sorry lord i didn't mean you i don't mean he said to interrupt you because he knew there was others praying yeah oh yeah he was apologizing yeah he apologized to the lord amen do you apologize to god are you are you hungry for god thirsty for god in his presence do you have that kind of relationship that well oh praise the lord i'm born again now i'm not not all conscious of this this this person or that person unconscious of jesus amen to be with you even in you to the end of the age he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you and there's i pray grace that we're not ignorant of his presence not ignorant of his anointing amen he's with you amen verse 6 again said but without faith it is impossible actually impossible to please god with opi amen for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him brother if you're going to diligently see god you can't forget him amen you can't get him out of your mind out of your way god's grace to us brother is my prayer amen let's stand stand and we'll sing only believe and go to the prophet and the message again is preached in 1957 and it is faith amen he's preaching on faith amen so god help us that we're going to receive the message believe them oh yes also i want you to remember in prayer [Music] a young brother in fort mcmurray i ministered in fort murray a couple times had brother martin martin isn't he martin warner uh he had a home there and he had a grudge attached to the home and and the great used to graduate i've caught it like we call it cottage meetings and that's where i ministered to them a couple of times and uh of course brother martin moved out and the shirt there's no church there now and my understanding is that up right up

but i don't think there's any churches in fort mcmurray now i don't know if there's any other believers there other than our brother uh bradley so we pray the grace of god to our brother bradley and and i feel that i may i will put maybe put him in contact with brother martin and brother martin is still working at certain things he does naturally but he's also still in the ministry and he does the evangelism by traveling even sometimes to africa and uh he's also right now brother martin is in uh edmonton and at brother dooley yeah brother dooley's church and he ministers there so we pray

looking for the faith amen the witness that we believe the witness lord in our hearts the witness in our souls father that we believe it is written we believe thus saith the lord so we pray the grace of your presence your anointing to continue with us into the hearing of that word that gives us the faith that you're looking for so grace lord that we're going to receive the faith father through what your servant has spoken and lord you're the faith through which the lord through what your prophet will speak so we pray the grace of god that we have a real genuine faith lord that pleases god amen trusting by grace lord that it is not just intellectual knowledge lord around us but i pray grace that it is the spiritual revelation of the word in us amen to give us the faith that pleases you amen that we will do lord and yield to you to do what you want to do amen lord because you chose the others to do what you wanted to do in luther's age wesley's age even the pentecostal age where trust by grace lord that we're yield to you so that you can do what you want to do in this bright age amen help us to recognize who we are where we are amen and to recognize the revealed word amen that's ordained that is predestinated to give us perfect faith amen hallelujah to take us out of time and into eternity and i pray grace that that faith father is already working in me that faith is already working in my brothers and sisters amen father getting us more and more and more further and further away from the world we live in and getting closer to eternity amen getting closer to the kingdom of god hallelujah getting closer to the marriage supper of the lamb all for your glory your honor your praise be with us we pray in the name of our lord jesus christ amen now i believe now i believe all things are possible now i believe now [Music] yes now i believe amen god bless us and again uh regarding the prophet we will start with his ministry on paragraph 17 and end on paragraph 95 so it might be an hour or maybe just a little less than an hour amen so god bless us you may be seated faith praise the lord amen right on just a few remarks from god's eternal and blessed word and i would like to read just a portion of it here found in the book of saint mark and the 11th chapter of saint mark i want to talk on faith just for a few moments cause many of you standing your limbs will be cramping i want to begin at the 20th verse i want to read it from the original greek lexan and in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou did curse is withered away jesus answering said unto them have faith in god amen for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he saith is coming to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen what a blessed promise amen faith in god it's a staggering thing to many people and yet we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to confess that we don't have faith in god first there is cowards who died ten deaths while they're here on earth and a hero never dies his memories linger on for his great heroic deeds and usually people who have faith are people who have experience experience brings faith i think that's the reason that the bible teaches us jesus said in saint john the third chapter except the man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of god now that's quoting from the original in the the king james it said he cannot see but the word doesn't mean see like you look with your eyes it means to understand you can't see the kingdom anyhow you must understand it and jesus said except the man be born again first he'll cannot understand the kingdom of god so it's uh it behooves us to have an experience before faith can ever accomplish very much therefore people ought to be saved before first they come to god and have an experience of salvation before they approach god for their healing it must it'll it'll work wonders if you can only believe it now notice many times in the scriptures we take the famous old scenes of israel when they were in trouble and there was a war broke out between israel and the philistines and israel had gathered themselves over on the side of the hill and the battle was set in order but no man was able to go to battle because over on the other side of the hill the enemy had a great challenger and as it was then so is it now that when god's people starts to go to do something the enemy always has a challenger challenging for and this great almost prehistoric giant stood there with 14 inch fingers on him and a spear in his hand the size of a weaver's needle he challenged any man of israel to come and fight with him that's the way the enemy does when he thinks he has the upper hand he'll never do it when he sees conquering faith but he'll only do it when he knows he's got you cowed down amen that's when the church can't move it's when he's got the weaver's needle over you but while in the armies of the israelites saul the great warrior if there was any man in the whole army that was more apt to be able to go and fight with this giant with saul first he was a well-trained wire he knowed all the maneuvers how to dodge the spears and how to knock them off with his shield and above that he was head and shoulders above any man in his arm he was more physically for a match and he was a traitor of man but as it was with saul in those days we find the same thing existing today among people who go to church some of them who are the best trained scholars has the least faith in god sometimes has the phds and deities and try to explain it or try to get away from the very fact of facing god's word they try to explain it away some other way and it's truth all of our scholarship all of our training never puts us in position to meet the enemy it takes faith in god to do that and that alone but if we notice while this giant was making his great boast and this great theologian as it would be stand there well trained you know how to fight but he had never had any experience with god amen such a pity today to see men and women who've lived in church been brought up in this crater road and knows the bible well but yet has never witnessed an experience with god what we need is to get back to a real heartfelt experience to know who you got faith in not some writings but the true and the living god and there in the midst of death way back over behind the fields god had a little ready boy by the name of david he tended his taller father's sheep and while he was tending his sheep he got some experience and it was his father who sent him up to the armies to take his brothers some fig cakes and raisin cakes and while he was up there he saw this great giant come out and make this big wide boast now little david was no match at all first he was just a young fella and the next thing he was a ready fella which means he was a little rough as we would call it and he was no match at all he never had a sword in his hand perhaps he never picked up a shield in his life he knows nothing about military training but there's one thing he didn't know he know his god amen that's the main thing he knew he had believed praise god and so when the giant made his challenge david knew another thing what was right and wrong sometimes we who go to church doesn't seem to hardly have the spiritual intelligence to know the difference if we do we don't act any different but he knew what was right and what was wrong he knew it was wrong for that philistine to defy the armies of the living god so he said these words do you mean to tell me that you let that uncircumcised philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living god what a rebuke to a trained army what a rebuke it is today for some little wash woman maybe that doesn't know her abc's but can stand in the face of a well-trained clergyman who's saying the days of miracles are past and define that word by saying i was once crippled or sick and now i'm healed amen amen she might not know all the ins and out of theology but she knows god after all that's what's required and there this little ruddy david just the youth with this little sheep coat wrapped around him walked up into the face of those towels and made them ashamed of themselves it said you stand there the trained army of the living god and let that philistine defy the armies of god amen said i will go fight himself myself oh i love that courageous spirit in david and saul tried to educate him and put him on a ecclesiastical jacket but it didn't feed him he said take this thing off of me i don't know how to say ah man the way you do i neither do i know your theology let me go with that what i've had experienced by oh a fellow said to me some time ago he said brother brown your preaching is in vain for there's no such a thing as divine healing i said this is one thing brother you just haven't been where we've walked that's all or you're just too late to tell us now we've already found it and witnessed it around the world the great revival of the outpouring of the holy spirit to bring forth signs and wonders to fulfill the word of god in these last days and this little fella took these old uh degrees off of him walked out there and he said lookie here here's why i'm going out i know who i have believed saul know nothing about that though he went to church every sabbath and he might have done all the religious things that the rest of them done but he had never had an experience and what happened david said when i was handing my father's sheep out there when i walked down to the green pastures and by the still waters hallelujah i learned of a god who made the heavens and earth and i was responsible for my papa's few sheep and a bear running and grabbed one and i saw him and a lion running and grabbed the kid and took off and i knocked him down with my slingshot and when he raised up i grabbed him by the beard and slew him he said the god that delivered the bearing how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised listening into my hands certainly he knew what he was talking about he had faith in god he had an experience to see what god would do therefore he knowed that experience would carry him on to victory oh years later when he become the king of israel there's no doubt that he become king for such a warrior as that amen when he become king he had an idea let me build the house of the lord and when the prophet nathan that night took him out i was talking to him the lord appeared to nathan he said go tell my servant david i know he was just a little ruddy thing i know he's wearing a sheep coat but i took him away from that sheep coat and made him a ruler over by people and give him a name like the great man in this earth how god seen that sincerity of faith to believing upon an experience that he was the living god how little it was for abraham after he had endured us seeing him who was invisible how after he met god and had an experience of talking face to face with god that he could call those things which were not as though they were for he had an experience he had talked to god face to face that's what we need it's a personal experience with the living god how that moses after having 40 years of religious training by his mother how having 40 years of military might in his hands of how to whip a nation how to conquer and it's taken god 40 years to take it out of him but once out there in the wilderness alone one day he'd come face to face with god in a burning bush and he was better equipped than five minutes after he had talked with god in eighty years had done anything to him he was a coward dying a thousand deaths and after meeting god he wished he had a thousand lives to die for christ he was ready to go there was nothing could stop him though he had no army though his education was no good to him he couldn't fight he had no swords he didn't have any wires any chariots to back him up as far as the world knew but he'd come face to face with god with an experience you had the armored angels of all the eternities just stand behind him as moses went his way down with his wife straddle of a little mew and a long whiskers hanging down i believe that ten thousand times ten thousands of angels rolled along down those roads with him he had an experience it was down at dawson one time when a young fellow a prophet's servant and he went down with him to dolphin and while the prophet slept the great syrian army come and and compas encamped about the great walls of gotham and when he woke up the next morning he had never had an experience he said to as he seen the great army looking for elijah he said oh my father the whole armies have gathered and surrounded here they're looking for you it didn't shake that old prophet praise god it might have been cancer it might have been tuberculosis it might have been a stroke but it didn't shake that prophet amen he looked at him and he said son there is more with us than there is with them amen he said i can only see you and i he said open his eyes god that he can see give him an experience and when his eyes open he looked in the home mountains was full of chariots and fire and horses of fire around that old shannon prophet he had an experience there was no more doubt in his mind than it was samson with a jawbone of a mew that killed a thousand philistines because he had an experience that he was born again amen he had an experience that he was a nazarite and the god of heaven was with him amen it was philip who had seen jesus in farmer experiences who went and found nathanael around behind the mountain and he said come see who we have found jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and the man being very orthodox he said now could there be any good thing come from nazareth he said come and see why he had been with jesus he knew that there was something about the man that was more than a match for anything the devil could stand up oh listen closely and as they go around the mountain philip is beginning to talk and nathaniel speaking with him and he said to him now when you get there i have seen him when peter come up and he didn't even never see peter and all his life but when he got there he said your name is simon and you are the son of jonas knew his name and knew who his daddy was or he couldn't believe that but philip had once been with him so he know to persuade him how he could be how he did it so when he walked up into the presence of jesus of nazareth he'd come then to believe then when he looked at him he said to him he said behold an israelite in whom there is no guile and he said to him when did you know me rabbi and he said before philip called you when you were under the tree i saw you now it's astonished him how could he do it but philip knew that to persuade nathanael that it could be done because he'd had an experience of being with jesus amen you know there's something about being with jesus gives you an experience being around where he's at watching his work then that gives you faith when you have an experience it gives faith faith goes by your experience now noticing this now as he come up well we can see them as they begin speaking to each other as they moved up and he began to tell him what was taking place and who he was and where he come from and all about it and then as quick as he got the experience oh blessed be the name of the lord when he got the experience that a miracle of god had been performed on him then he could fall at his feet and say rabbi thou art the son of the living god thou art the king of israel but first he had to see it done he could have faith in god after god had manifested himself that's what god does the woman that brother neville was reading about tonight in the bible she was sitting out the whale or getting her water out of the well she was a samaritan she had been taught that there was coming a messiah who would do great signs and wonders she knowed a little about it and when they dipped the bucket into the well to get the water jesus said bring me a drink and she said while you have nothing to draw with and why would you ask me for a drink see you at your samaritan first we have no dealings with each other and so forth the conversation went on by and by here's what taking place he found where her trouble was remember she first come out there to criticize him as a jew but he said go get your husband and come here she said i don't have any husband said that's right you've got five and the one that you have now is not your husband and quickly as soon as that happened she was puzzled in her mind remember she went to a coal formal church she know not what to do she said well now sir i perceive that you are a prophet that we know when the messiah cometh that he'll tell us these things he said i'm he that speaks to you oh what an experience i am he that speaks with you and what did she say she ran into the city with an experience amen that she had witnessed that jesus was the son of the living god ever she had seen a power working in him that it performed a miracle that told her who she was and where her sin was and where her trouble was therefore she could run and say truly that is the son of god come see the man that told me the things that i've done isn't this the very messiah now notice again in a few moments they had a woman that had a blood issue she cried and tried everything to do to get well she couldn't do it she pressed to the crowd and she touched the border of his garment for she believed now what faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god amen she pressed through because faith comes by hearing she touched his garment and she said that satisfies me i've touched him and she goes back into the crowd believing in her heart that something would take place am i oh if people today could only get that believing and when it taken place jesus turned and said who has touched me and peter said all of them are touching you why do you say who touched me he said but i got weak i'm so weak virtue strength has gone from me i am weak and he said well how did you know that and he looked around over the crowd she thought she was hit she was back out there hitting the crowd and when jesus turned and looked at her he told her what her trouble was and that she had been healed and that it was that she could fall down at his feet and confess all things after she had an experience of his great magnificent power to reveal to her that she had touched the garment not only of him but of him that liveth forever almighty god certainly it was now it was the people on the day of pentecost that was cowardly and they were in an upper room the doors were all closed they were afraid of the jews but when god came in the form of the holy ghost and baptized every one of that group with the baptism of the holy ghost and fire it was then they could go into the street and that man who cursed in the presence of jesus a few days before could say ye man of judea and you that dwell in jerusalem let this be known unto you and heartening my words these are not drunken as you supposed seen it's the third holiday but this is that was just spoken about the prophet joel certainly after he had an experience before he had the experience he had faith to believe it but after the experience come experience brought the results certainly at the end now those people that jesus spoke to there about the tree now notice just a moment now as we close as he was coming to the out of the temple one day he run down to a tree to find out if he can find something to eat on this tree there was nothing there because the time of figs wasn't yet and he could find nothing so he said to the tree no man eateth from thee from henceforth no one eateth and the next day they never seen any difference in the tree right then it didn't show any results any physical results now here's where i want you to get it it showed no results but what did he say no man eateth from me and 24 hours about noon the next day they passed by the same tree and in there they noticed that the tree had begun to wither and peter said behold the tree which doubted curse it's already withering from the roots now watch what jesus said now as we close have faith in god what he showed him his power first he showed it on a fig tree what he could do because when he asked the father anything he believed that he received what he asked for then he told them you have faith in god for i say to you if you'd say to this mountain be moved and be lifted up and thrown into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that those things that you say is coming to pass you shall have what you say do you get it here it is in the original greek lesson you see believe that what you say shall come to pass you can have what you say have faith in god believe that what you ask for you receive it believe it's already taken place and you can have what you say now about the mountain being moved maybe one little grain of sand begin to move but anyhow in the eyes of god it was already taking place if you believe tonight that no matter what's wrong with you if you believe when you ask god that you get what you say you can have what you say have faith in god but first god's got to prove himself to you that he he is still the same lord god he's still the same powerful jehovah now jesus said the things that i do shall you also now to you here tonight in the tabernacle while we're starting to have the prayer life how many of you would say this if i could see jesus christ perform the same miracles and do the same thing that he did when he was here on earth i in my heart would accept god and believe that whatever is wrong with me would take place as soon as i asked god would you believe it would you raise your hand say god i will believe with all no matter what it is now there's no one can heal healing is a finished product of god if any man tells you that he can heal you if he's a doctor and can tell you he can heal you he's wrong well there's only one healer that's god a doctor can give medicine he can put medicine in a sore to kill the germs in it so it'll get well what does happen the medicine doesn't heal the medicine only keeps the bad germs out kills the bad germs that kill the good germs and kill you so science works on different poisons that they put into your system to poison certain germs that won't poison you that's what science does that's what medicine is is it something that'll kill a certain germ and it won't kill you these antibiotics kill both to a great big extent so therefore they that's really hard to take like penicillin sometimes it kills a person now a doctor can move an obstruction he can uh bone together but he can heal god's the one who does the healing god produces a calcium god produces the multiplication of the cells to build your body back or they've moved appendix or something like that god is the only healer now jesus promised that he would heal us if you'll ask anything in my name i'll do it when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for you shall have it it's yours believe that it comes to pass now now when he displayed his great powers on earth now he didn't heal people until the father showed him first what to do saint john 5 19. he said if thou canst believe all things are possible and then in saint john 5 19 he said i do nothing till i see the father do it first whatever the father shows me that does the sun likewise how many knows the bible says did you ever read the bible certainly now when he did that on his journey here on earth he did it in one city they believed him they were healed thousands goes to another city does it they believe goes to his own city his own home and when he started to do it they said who is this man where did he get this wisdom how does he know how to perform these things we know him and the bible said that many mighty works he could not do because of their unbelief many mighty works he could not do now i pray if there's a sinner here tonight that when you see if he will do it this is my hometown and this is the hardest place i have ever battled in my life i've been with the hot and tots in africa i've been in india with the hoodoo isms and everything else and challenged by their witch doctors and so forth and i've never had the struggle to get the spirit of god to work like i have in my own hometown it's exactly right not because people don't love me because the bible is true verily verily i say unto you that a prophet within his own country is on his own county is not without honor except it's in that place it has to be that way now let us bow our heads just a moment while we pray oh blessed lord who made the heavens and earth created them with thy own blessed hand i pray thee lord to be kind and merciful to us tonight pardoning our sins and our transgressions i pray thee to be kind to those who are sick and needy granted lord and if there be sin in our midst o eternal god forgive it for just in the next few moments your word is either found right or it's found wrong it's either found to be true or it is an error is still god or the scriptures is wrong and lord preaching this believing it holding it to the showdown lord the word that there must be something take place there must be either god must prove himself real or the people has a right to say i first have to see it but lord the people born in sin shaped in iniquity as we all are come to the world speaking lies then we know lord that the merciful god will surely have mercy upon us and will help us dear god we pray tonight for each individual here that your spirit will rest upon them forgiving our sins and our wicked ways and may we acknowledge the lord jesus as our blessed savior just now and may his spirit be kind now father it is written in the word by the lips of our own blessed lord and savior your son that has been said this way the things that i do shall you also he that believeth on me shall do the works that i do a little while in the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you and in you to the end of the age you made a promise that the unbelieving children of adam would never be able to see you no more after you left the earth but that the believer would see you in power and demonstration in every generation we believe that lord and we believe that we're living in the last days of the gentile dispensation that it's soon to close and you've raised up these mighty works that the gentiles might not have an excuse you've had your picture taken with us as the great pillar of fire that led the children of israel and how what a phenomenon it is and to see you if it would just be the picture alone if we could say well it might have been such and such even though the scientific world said it was true but when we see the spirit come down and manifest and do the same things that he did then we're bound to recognize it to be the risen lord help us tonight lord we are eternity bound people we got our heads towards the dust where you taken us from and we're on our road back swiftly this little time of preparation is for our souls be kind now lord and as your servant stands oh god will i have faith to believe that god cannot lie that he'll keep his promise he must do it in order to be god lord is my age is creeping along and i don't know how much longer i've got to stay here i pray god that you'll give me great experiences even greater than what has been done if it be possible that the people might know and experience that the living word of god is part of god and may every person be without an excuse tonight when we leave here if they should turn their back upon thee granite save souls and heal the sick for we ask that in the name of thy child the lord jesus our blessed savior amen amen thank you for your attention i know i kept you just a little long i just love that good old word i was born in it i want to die with it the place i want to go is right here behind the platform like to go home to meet god if i had a 20 lives to live for a hundred lives i want every one of them for the lord jesus even if there wasn't a heaven to go to afterwards i'd still want to serve the lord jesus for the peace and satisfaction that i have of knowing that he lives and because he lives i can live also now if i stood here tonight to tell this little group of people that i had powers to heal someone i you would know quickly are people who knows the bible to know that i'd be deceiving i have no powers to heal neither is there any man in the world got powers to heal it's only through christ in your faith in the finished work every sinner can be saved just now but why because jesus comes down and saves you now no because he saved you when he died for you at calvary that was finished the whole plan of salvation and for your healing it's your personal faith in the living god amen praise the lord again let's test our faith making sure that it's in the heart in your soul not in your head amen but your control from the inside out not from here down but from the inside out as the bible and the prophet of god has explained to us that god through the holy ghost he said in our souls is there to control our spirits amen according to the word and then it moves on to control your thoughts amen because there's too many believers they're controlled by their thoughts and their feelings yes in their spirit but not the holy spirit amen because it's all from the inside out that the enemy is working amen that you're going by your feelings you're going by your intellectual thoughts amen this is what have the devil deceived eve and yeah in the in the garden he he said yeah yet god said so he wanted to get into a discussion on what god said the letter of the word and he would add to it and take from it and again it's just one word where it says god said thou shalt surely die but god don't put no butts in it no no the devil puts butts in it amen so i pray the grace of god then i earn our witness and what we're standing for amen there's no buts it's but rather it is written you know and that the devil comes back yes but you know thus saith the lord yes but yeah and any and he'll just change your word oh yeah just change maybe add a word take away a word and sometimes you might feel yourself being uh sense yourself being controlled by by a feeling but what about faith faith just believes the word amen don't add to it make me no wonder brother brahms warned us he said don't make it bigger than what it is don't make it smaller than what it is leave it he said the way it is amen so brother sister i pray god help us that we're going to leave it the way that it is we're not going to put any butts into it which is it is written no buts they'll say the lord no buts amen the word so brother how many of us are really truly coming into the faith that god wants to see in us how many really truly uh got resurrection and rapturing faith well this is the in all the prophet has said brothers there's anything that we got we got to focus on is the resurrection and the rapture and become and let it become more and more real to us so how many are living for the resurrection i mean living for the rapture where is our faith is it just in doctrine or they believe this but we believe that but they believe this but we believe that now forget it brother again it's like brother neville and you hear him responding to the word there when the lord called brother neville off the scene one of the brethren that was with him in the last moment was brother lee vale and our brother might have been in a hospital at the time and it was just before god took him really off the s off the earth brother level said brother neville he said is there anything you want me to convey he said to the believers to the bride anything you want to tell us he said you know that the lord wants to tell us and he said well he said yes brother neville he said go tell him he said that what they're looking for is already here yeah the resurrection the rapture it's already here the faith for it see luther believed it was there he just kept on preaching it wesley and the pentecostals the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost or they kept on preaching kept on preaching it and so on but now for you and me i trust by the grace of god we're not going to just focus on oh yeah the there we got the understanding of the trinity we got the understanding of of this this revelation that revelation oh yes and we know about denominations and so on but how many are really focusing on the resurrection how many are focusing on the rapture if you want to go you'll be focusing on and brother god is allowing all these things to bring out the hunger and thirst of the bride for the resurrection for the rapture you've got to want it if you want to go you'll go if you don't want to go you won't go well i don't mind i yeah i like to go like to go probably more than that the devil likes to go you know but all about believing that you're going i'm going this is why i'm getting more and more and more separated from the world this is why the world's getting more and more crazy to in my my eyes and in what i what i'm seeing and god god is doing that for a reason because again we were reminded that when the rapture takes place the resurrection takes place that that there's going to be those so those left behind are going to say oh i thought there was to be a resurrection i thought there was to be a rapture it already happened and you didn't know it didn't know it why didn't they know it but they weren't into the spirit of what god was doing amen and then and god allowed like this to happen that to happen he allowed this covert 19 to happen and it is to get get everybody's attention on this this and this and this and maybe like we weren't allowed to worship here there only five of us uh five including the the ministry and so on the ministry was preaching to four four people yeah when we were allowed that and that was uh brother matthew i believe at the computers back there and then uh brother bob did the song service yeah and uh that was it that and so i it was all basically was here and uh so my lord i said this this is getting unusual for sure and it's going to come it's going to get worse now and we'll we'll be separated of course the prophet is saying the hour is coming we won't be allowed to get together and preach the word and preach this and preach that no and so and again god allowed this to happen what was it to separate separate separate physically but not spiritually amen so to bring forth what where our emphasis is is our emphasis on the physical or is it spiritual are we looking for something physical or spiritual well physical in a sense but it's the only physical we're looking for is a glorified body a man by the grace of god not not in a dream not by any means and not just a vision it's going to be reality but he said there's going to be so few in the rapture that when they do we won't know it and and and another reason why we won't know is because we're going to be separated so much government is going to do this and do that not necessarily going to focus on oh you're what you teach and what you believe we've got to stop you go and join this church go join that church so on no it's just that things are going to get so bad around the world and everybody's going to get caught up with what's going on like the covert 19 thing caught up with this caught up with that amen and that they're taking up with even the vaccines that people are giving out and speaking to a brother in the states not long ago and i said well i said brother again it's what is i'll tell you what it's going to become i said everything is going to become a money-making affair oh yeah they're going to be in it for making money for this money for that you know not that they're real disappointed over the cobra 19 disease no no oh wonderful we can make more money oh yeah we sell more sell more masks and we'll get more the vast the backs of the what they call bad vaccines and so on this one's going to do it this one's going to do it that one's going to do it oh yeah money money money money but still everybody's going to get confused and they had to be separated and separated and separated and that's why when the rapture comes there's going to be a lot won't know about it that's right because the churches will be so separated and i know even the big churches in the states and uh one of our brethren there they could only worship you know and then they said what what is the the first letter of your name and they said well we can go from a to a to g or something like that and whoever got the if that includes the the letter for your name uh well that's the one that can meet in the church now on that on sunday and the others won't we won't be allowed so we'll we'll have another meeting for them maybe in in a couple of weeks then those for those who go on to another oh yeah the brother was doing that oh yeah the pastor that that's what he was advising his people that only if you're only if your name started with this letter can you come to church sunday and then next sunday there'd be the others with different letters and so on so brother and it's when people want to get confused they want to know this and know this and know that and the devil would try to get them to forget the rapture they won't focus on it about jade of the bride that's the only thing is in their mind like jesus the only thing in jesus mind was getting out of here and he knew what he knew the price he had to pay to get out and that's why he cried and wept like he did and the disciples were sleeping and and finally it got so bad he said lord he said not my will thine be done amen so are we going to in the in all those circumstances that we're going to face we're going to endure pressure is going to be put there to try to get us to compromise in our faith compromise on what we believe you know and do it this way and do it that way well god help us it's my prayer that we're going to be numbered with the few that are going honest again be on your guard please don't take it for granted say oh yeah well everything's going to be already lord look after me no god has given you what you need to look after yourself well god's going to do this no god gives you this till you do it yeah so everything becomes personal and and so on so again you know what we feel god wants to do it god wants to brother brown said yeah that's the trouble with with believers today said he said you're only interested in what god what god's going to do for you what are you going to do for him that's the truth god do this god do that god do that no god well god gave luther what he needed to do what god wanted him to do and he did it and i done to the pentecost does god give them what he wanted them to do and he did it amen and oh if oh lord do you want me to do something else and he will give you a greater anointing great anointing and you move on and do it again that's why again praise the lord that's why the prophecy that god is waiting on you god's waiting on us he said and he said the saints that are going on they're waiting on us wait waiting on us what are we waiting on us for to get into a resurrection of rapturing faith amen by the grace of god so that is not a doctrine amen it's a real faith by the grace of god it's again it's like i heard the prophet was saying concerning him and his two daughters and uh you know you know the story where brother brown was away from home when he came home his two young daughters came out to greet him and uh and they did one of his children did i like that they were jealous over those to whom he ministered oh yeah because they had more of a brother bam's attention than they did than than their his sons and daughters amen so when he came home that night and his daughters went out to greet him and of course we know what happened that that rebecca was she jumped up at her father's arms and put her put her arms around him and around his head and around his shoulders and she told sarah sarah she said oh she said i got all a daddy and there's none there for you. and so so brother branham heard rebecca say that and uh he just motioned to sarah to come toward him and he pulled her up and he put his arms around her and that oh praise well praise the lord for that revelation she said becky i got something to tell you she said you might have all of that issues but i got i want you to know daddy's got all of me amen so the grace of god brother you got all the god in in the letter of the word amen with you and so on but but how many as how many does god have does god have control of you amen so it's not not that we got all of god god got all of us and they know we know god's in control by grace for grace to help us brother with a genuine holy ghost faith in god by the grace of god he said now he said again little david was no match at all first he was just a young fellow and the next thing he was a ruddy fellow which means he and as we would call it and he said he was no match at all and he never had a sword in his hand perhaps he never picked up a shield in his life he know nothing about military training and sometimes what we're experiencing in life and the training and all that's going on oh yeah that trade that trains us but uh we're not we're not following the leadership of the holy ghost i don't remember the doctor's name now he was a medical doctor that i attended and he was it was good originally he was from greece and he used to be in charge of the hospital in bjorn but then he moved out on his own with his own clinic and and i would meet him and a couple of times that i went to him and i wondered one time there was a track in my pocket and uh when he was investigating me and checking things he said oh i got a question he said do you mean to tell me that he said somebody that maybe never had education that never went to a school never went to a college you know and trained or even the bible colleges he said you mean tell me that someone that didn't experience any of those things would have more understanding than someone that spent six or seven years in a bible college and i said yes that's what i'm telling you i said one got the letter of it in their heads and i said the other one gets the spiritual revelation in their heart and i said it's god in the soul not in the head oh that's what you meant i said yes because whenever i met him the doctor that we would talk end up talking about the word and the lord yeah and he was he was greek and so on so i said brother that that's that's the meaning of it oh i said can i have that track i said yes you can have the track he said i said take it and he took the track and laid it on his table amen so i pray god maybe he's gone on now for sure god rest his soul amen so we had to understand god god it's the devil trying to get us to put attention on the physical things of life god's put attention on the spiritual amen just leave it with the lord and then again like i said prophet said you want god to do this god do this god do that god doesn't you do it why christ speak yeah by the grace of god but no we want god to do it we want god we want this we want signs and wonders but brother god is pointing us to the word take the word and do what the word said do look up because your redemption drawn near oh you want to look up i want you to keep praying for the resurrection pray for the rapture call for the resurrection call for the rapture amen that's the hour you're living amen so grace of god we're not just sitting here and just waiting i'm gonna bring the rapture lord and i i i'll be there no the lord has already brought the rapture as the prophet said in the rapture message you see the rapture has been going on all the time and this was been caught up that was being caught up and so on so god help us that we're going to have the faith that pleases god and i'll tell you if we've got the real faith we've got real faith you won't be able to get it out of your mind the rapture thank you jesus i'm looking for the resurrection lord i'm expecting the rapture lord i want to go home i really want to get back with you lord i said take us by grace that's right but the enemy is there with the butts yeah but you got to do this you got to do that and i know too people are getting caught up too much with the natural things of life you know trust god take away the the money yeah you take away the the silver and the gold and so on amen so that he'll bring us to the place where we gotta trust him bring our faith our faith in him by grace that we really believe god have mercy on us he talked about david again yeah a god type of faith he had faith yeah just think when he he would play music and sing it when he was looking after the the animals his father's sheep and lambs and so on and uh and so and like i said when the bear did what he did david why didn't you run away run no oh a lot a lot of believers would run away no he just he was so in the spirit so going by faith by faith by faith he just believed god he just trusted god no questions no doubts whatsoever and when the bear come and he he went over and killed the bear yeah you did yes and even when the lion come went over and killed the lion yeah and then when he when he went in to see israel and what israel was doing because of goliath what you nobody you're afraid of him if goliath he was he was a giant and and so on he was this high and he had all this and and he was challenging someone to come and and child to fight him and overcome him if you overcome him they would overcome the nation that he was representing and all israel was back there hiding oh mom we can't we can't we can't fight him what he couldn't fight him and david come and how did david do it by faith what was his faith yes faith oh i have faith in god god will be with me no not not like that his faith was was based on the word yeah his faith was based on the under on the covenant that god had between himself and the jews what was the faith amen well if you had faith the faith that god did this god did this you believed it you trusted him amen it was it was the circumcision because that's why he highlighted goliath he said you mean to tell me he said you're afraid of this uncircumcised philistine you you think he's going to do you think he's going to defeat you and get the victory over you no according according to the according to the covenant he said and we got the token of it so he said i'm not i'm not afraid he's uncircumcised he said i am yeah so he said i'm going to i'm going to defeat him because he's the enemy of god and david was it was that was this was the seed of god the son son son of god amen to god be the lord see where faith come down so basic we want to build it up make it like this god says this amen believe us thou this and there's does it control when it comes to what you believe is to control your life amen it brings god in control soul body and spirit amen so you you're thinking more about god and brother amazing when it comes to all that's going on in the world we there more and more people are thinking about the natural natural natural natural natural well but spiritual no matter what the enemy is tempting us like where's your spiritual where's your faith i i a lot of people convince confess the negative confess the negative confess the negative and when you're confessing faith say get behind me satan yeah if you really believe who you are as the seed of god elohim amen that well the word made flesh in you makes you god grace to us amen get behind me satan we are on our way home amen by the grace of god so david he know nothing about the military training but there's one thing he did know he knowed his god and that's the main thing he knew who he had believed and so when the giant made his challenge david knew another thing what was right and wrong so sometimes we go to church and doesn't seem to be hardly have the spiritual intelligence to know the difference if we do we don't act any different your actions are based on what you believe amen not your feelings your faith but he knew what was wrong and what what what was right and what was wrong he knew it was wrong for that philistine to defy the armies of the living god so he he said these words do you mean to tell me that you will let that uncircumcised philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living god what a rebuke to a trained army yeah that this young man here a shepherd boy yeah you're lowering us down you feel that we're nothing you're making us so small that we you know we can't do nothing well he said something wrong somewhere like i said the king offered him his sword and his shield but he just tried it that wasn't faith that was sight oh go go use the sword and and the shield and and get the victory over over over goliath that's all no oh no i'm not i don't god never trained me with that a man training man man with the sword and the shield but he was going forth by faith that whatever he did for the glory of god yeah it was for it was god's will it was god's will so that they they wouldn't contact or or attack the jews they wouldn't attack god's people yeah they were enemies not only enemies against the people but enemies against god and that's why he did david said oh yeah i know this is the he knew it was the will of god that that enemy be destroyed he knew it was the will of god that he'd be killed yeah because he was challenging not just israel he's challenging god and god has somebody there with faith yeah faith oh yeah well they were jews and they were all in in that covenant and they and they all had the token of that covenant yeah but still they were afraid didn't believe god was going to be with them didn't believe god was going to give him the victory over that that giant but david come well goodness god give me the victory over the lion and and the bear sure he said goliath won't mean nothing yeah and uh and he's instead he didn't need the short sword he didn't need the shield now so he left that with the king but he went down as i said and he just picked up of the the stones what david what are you doing stone giant slingshot what oh yes you're going to kill goliath with a slingshot you know we think we've got to have this we got to have this guy listen god in simplicity you'd have a god hidden and revealing simplicity david amen and you go through the scriptures you'll find the same amen well people want to build it up make it big make it this make it that god help us god forgive us that we'll stay with simplicity and he went out just to the water there picked up five stones thank god and put into his thing that he had there and he only used one he just needed one stone he said do you want to use a slingshot to kill goliath how could a small man like david take take a slingshot and put a stone in the slingshot and just want to throw that goliath goliath was challenging him good luck to it well even goliath it was a joke you know just a big laugh thing and to a lot of the jews it was it was a laugh thing and making fun of david and so on but to to to david just think he wasn't going to try it he knew what he was going to do he knew he was going to defeat goliath he knew he was going to break him down and cut his head off amen and the other jews all of them just think the whole army of israel and they were afraid of goliath and there's this one young one shepherd coming and he's yeah and he's just taking a stone and a slingshot oh we used to use lu i remember using slingshots back years ago we used slingshot for this string shot for that you know so on yeah but just think it wasn't just a uh something that entertained david no amen i assure you it must be an entertaining god to see that young man go out there with a slingshot and a few stones to kill goliath and he did why because god was with him and he was in the word he was in the covenant and he believed the covenant he stayed with the covenant he ate amen oh yeah just and again something struck me when i was thinking about it again this week concerning you know all the the old testament and we say oh it's just the new testament now no there's lessons we can be taught in the old testament and i said lord this is amazing i said in the old testament i said now i understand that why the brother i said wrote hebrews 11 by faith by faith by faith they did this by faith they did that and so on this is absolutely amazing that's true lord we can look at adam we can look at abraham and look at this one and this one i said they're all lived by faith they're all controlled by faith all controlled by the will of god amen they don't know what they wanted what god wanted to do they went and did it they lived for god they were living for god and god was there oh my this is amazing no matter what they do they never left god out of it if there's something in their natural lives and something this something that god was in it all and god was controlling all right no wonder the bible's the sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and we'll find that in the bible you read you read about uh again about abraham read about this one read about that one and this prophet that problem lie why like elijah they're all going by faith the will of god and god stood with them god was behind them i trust grace lord that we'll go forth as they went forth and we have the examples there in scripture by faith they did this by faith they did that amen the same but by faith moses and so on all that he did grace grace grace for the glory of god grace to get us into a resurrection and the rapture amen to make us more and more conscious of what god is doing less conscious of what the devil is doing amen will focus on god not on the devil give the glory to jesus not the devil to god be the glory and again as i shared you this with you faith is the victory that overcomes the world amen and it says encamped along the hills of light ye christian soldiers rise and press the battle ear of the night shall veil the glowing skies amen against the foe in veils below that all our strength be hurled faith is the victory that overcomes the world amen god's grace to us amen so david knew what was right and what was wrong and he knew it was wrong for that philistine to defy the armies of the living god and he said these words do you mean to tell me that you'll let that uncircumcised philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living god what a rebuke to a trained army amen god's grace amen that we're going to follow his leadership lord bless you let's stand praise the lord the same 3 96 i am i am thine o lord i have heard thy voice and it told thy love to me that i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee amen we'll turn to our brother mark and pray the grace of god to our
