our emphasis is on the word of god we're in at his promise amen the lord shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first but then we which are alive and remain is going to be caught up together with them and i trust by grace we're already being cut off amen again as i said i shocked that church group one time when i did say i said just want to let you know i i've been resurrected amen and i i've been raptured and they were all shocked to the point that oh my everything got real quiet and i noticed that even even the pastors are sitting in the in the seat he just turned around and he looked at the congregation he shook his head i don't know if he meant no or or not not to be bothered with it but but again i had to i felt i had to explain it amen that again you me we have been resurrected we were dead in sins but not anymore amen we're resurrected giving us the power over the world the flesh and the devil amen and we've been caught up into a heavenly place in christ praise the lord i trust by grace we've experienced in our hearts in our souls redemption and resurrection we have been raptured and we are in heavenly places in christ jesus amen to listless i pray grace amen that we're experiencing the rapture amen oh yeah it started now it's it keeps going on to catch us up amen and i was gonna do it by the word believe us thou this praise the lord brother our faith is challenged as martha's faith was challenged at the grave of lazarus amen oh he was going to raise him from the dead martha said oh he'll raise up there in the future and jesus said i am the resurrection amen so i pray grace that we have experienced it and we are experiencing it amen the resurrection this is what keeps us separated from the world this is what keeps us separated from the things of the world amen what is it it's just the anointing that i'm being cut off amen the anointing is catching me away from that and catching me up to glory for the glory of god amen god help us as his sons and daughters god help us as he said that we're going to go forth and live a resurrected and a raptured life amen so that we're not caught up with that what's down here we're caught up with what's going on somewhere else the world the world don't understand it amen but thank god believers understand amen we have been redeemed we are being redeemed we've been resurrected and raptured and we are being resurrected and raptured praise the lord hallelujah god bless you turn with me in the bible to ephesians chapter one amen and again while you welcome the visitors with us amen from central newfoundland our university students and also uh visitors from the united states amen god bless you guys amen in ephesians chapter 1 be in prayer as we go into the word as i want to share with you some scriptures some and the revelation of what god has done that's good praise the lord but we want to really get into what god's doing amen praise the lord you know what god will do well to to be part of what he will do we gotta we gotta be part of what he's doing amen what he did brings us into what he's doing and what he's doing will take us into what he will do amen praise the lord praise the lord is giving us the faith to keep moving on amen praise the lord in ephesians chapter 1 and beginning to read at verse 1 and it says paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god amen not the will of man but the will of god and two and says to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus praise the lord and not just at ephesus but in newfoundland and in saint john's and it says grace be to you and peace praise the lord from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i trust we're experiencing that grace and we're here because of that grace amen and that we have that peace that passeth all understanding so blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ amen who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ praise the lord see the significance and the importance of our relationship with jesus our relationship with our lord jesus christ amen because we be blessed be be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings hallelujah this is tremendous in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him praise the lord before the foundation of the world hallelujah by the grace of almighty god brother again we've been predestinated the prophet of god said from the foundation of the world predestinated unto adoption amen that we're going to be taken back as sons and daughters of god he said we are sons and daughters of god amen from the foundation of the world but he said by the grace of god as his sons and daughters we're going to be adopted back into the family praise the lord again verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy praise the lord and without blame before him in love amen in that place where it is written that no man can lay a charge against god's elect amen again god is not looking at our our works physical works god's looking at our faith amen and that's why that as far as god's concerned no man can lay a charge against my sons and daughters oh lord this lord this lord that god said i don't see that i just see their faith amen thank god amen let's reverence it and respect it amen and it says we are without blame before m in love divine love and it says adding predestinated us unto the adoption of children praise the lord we hear the sons and daughters of god we're dead we're adopted back into the family of god so he predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will grace grace that we're in the will of god and to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved wonderful hallelujah in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence grace grace grace be on your guard amen be on your guard because the enemy is seeking whom he may deceive oh yeah the bible says he's going to deceive the very elect if possible that's how deceiving the devil is amen because remember again he's religious if he's as devil as anything he's religious he's very religious right from the beginning amen in genesis what was he doing he was quoting the word he was he was the first evangelist and area is ministering to to eve and he said yeah as god said oh yeah but what did he want to do change a little and he said but i say unto you he says amen but no there's no buts forget the butts yeah as god said leave it there amen don't change it just believe it and stay with it because we're going to be judged by what he said amen not the devil's interpretation but god's revelation amen in your heart and in your soul so having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will his will is recorded in his word and to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accept it in the beloved thank god for grace why we need that grace because we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen brother when a sinful flesh we need that grace of god to be with us continually let's keep acknowledging grace thank you lord for grace amen praise the lord again verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood amen the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace thank god wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence praise the lord and having made known unto us the mystery of his will what is the will of god for your life what is the will of god for this hour for this age that we are living in grace he has made known unto us the mystery of his will in these last days according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself amen god bless his word you may be seated amen i want to share some thoughts with you regarding redemption but onto predestination and adoption we think oh well i'm adopted so that's what that's what's bringing me in no i'm i'm there because i'm the son of god and we are the sons and daughters of god amen but because of the fall we were moved out and away from home but god has promised redemption what for to bring us back a man to adopt us back again as his sons and daughters praise the lord because from the foundation of the world we were his sons and his daughters god knew us before the foundation of the world as being is a man but he predestinated the plan to bring us back amen when adam and eve did what they did in genesis amen god also gave a promise of redemption and again as the prophet of god has explained that he said adam put himself in sin with eve he says so that god redeeming him as his son he said would repent redeem eve praise the name of the lord hallelujah so brother that's exactly what he did he came down in the promise to redeem us back it came down in the promise to bring us home praise the lord now we're not strangers amen i'm going to come we're strangers in this world and we are pilgrims in this world oh brother if we're strangers and pilgrims in this world why why it's because that we well where we come from eternity amen truly on the inside of the inside we are the sons and daughters of god amen because the seed was engrafted in us praise the lord from right for even right from our natural birth the seed was on the inside amen and brother that she was going to respond to what god would do in our day in our age amen oh praise the lord brother all the way down through when god came from great game with the revelation of the word the revelation of virtue revelation knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and to the revelation of divine love amen god knew amen it was go he was going to find his place in his seed his sons and his daughters hallelujah brother and i tell you this god knew because his sons and his daughters was going to respond to the word amen hallelujah they were they were hung in and thirsting forth it was the engrafted seed amen and bringing forth the faith of the church before the faith of the seed of god and brother and god god began to move in us and move in us all day all the way down through the ages until he would bring us to absolute complete perfection amen brother it's not just having this not just having that not this not this no no god is adding to the church to break hallelujah to the church comes in his likeness amen praise the lord and the church is like him amen the bride is like the bright group the bride is reflecting the bright room reflecting his nature reflecting his character by the grace of god oh brother i tell you what god god requires of us brother he didn't require all the all of all of the revelation of of them that he's given you and me not by any means brother because amen because the church went into darkness but god said i want to restore praise the name of the lord the enemy got in like he did in the garden of eden physically amen and he brought man down and but brother god gave him a promise to bring him up praise the lord and brother all the way through the church ages it started off with faith and god said i'm going to reveal this and this and this and the enemy got in and brother what did he do he caught that's where him he brought in denomination organization let's organize let's do this let's do that no you got to do it do you got to you got to have the freedom that god god by his revelation gives us amen not to come under the authority and influence of man but to stay under the authority of god amen and brother that's where the nomination started right around the third age the prophet said in pergamus and he said what was going on he said he was bringing man under the bringing the believers under the control of man amen bringing believers under the control of a organized church amen but i tell you this brother god didn't ordain that god didn't predestinate that that's the devil amen satan came in the garden of eden amen and through heave he added this and through evie added this he did this and did that amen and adam put himself in sin with a for god to redeem her amen and for and brother jesus came down and as we're putting himself in sin to identify with your sin my sin amen what for for brother and purchasing redemption for the seed of god amen there's nothing i could do nothing you could do but he did it praise the name of the lord hallelujah to bring us back home praise the lord the enemy got us down here but jesus is getting us back up there amen by the grace of almighty god and that's why we walk in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship one with another amen and the blood of jesus cleanses us from all unrighteousness praise the name of the lord brother again it's in our hearts it begins in our hearts is god moving in our hearts god moving in our spirits until one day is god going to change the flesh oh yeah it is the anointing in our souls that's controlling the the the nature of your spirit amen and then there's god in the nature of your spirit gonna control your flesh but the devil is working as we said the devil is working in our heads amen this is satan's watchtower but this is god's watchtower god is in here working out amen the devil's in here trying to work us down amen and and get us away from the faith oh no i'll tell you this if we're born of god we're seed of god amen when the enemy comes down like this oh get thee behind me satan it is written praise the name amen as he tempted jesus he tempts you and me but jesus got the victory for you and me praise the lord so brother when the enemy comes in on a temperature in our flesh in our feelings oh well yeah well we know it's there we were born that way physically born in sin and shaped in iniquity and the enemy is there to work on that but brother i tell you god's in our souls to give us the victory over praise the name of the lord amen if god's in our souls brother i tell you it's don't mean we don't have to deal with the devil we still got to deal with the devil amen the greater the anointing you have inside the greater the anointing that you got outside by the enemy oh yeah so again is this is his watchtower and what's what's what does this depend on it goes by what we're seeing naturally and what we feel physically amen but what god's doing on the inside is what we see spiritually and what we feel spiritually amen we're we're led by the spirit praise the lord controlled by the spirit amen again sons and daughters of god led by the spirit of god we're not we're not going to do this and do that because oh well this is what i feel in my flesh no what do you feel in your heart amen what does your heart tell you not what your flesh tells you not what your head tells you now would your five senses tell you but what what is what is god telling us by faith amen so we're going not by feelings we're going by faith amen not by not by what the body is telling me and the enemy is working in my body the enemy is working in my head and oh yeah he's getting trying to get me to focus on feelings try to get me to focus on intellect amen but brother god is working in our hearts to get us to focus our spiritual revelation amen of his word amen hallelujah now now would you feel in your flesh what do you sense in your heart amen well you sense on the inside of the inside amen right from the beginning god has chosen faith amen to control us and faith to govern us faith to counsel us amen through the revelation in our hearts and souls not in our minds brother we need to get away from the flesh we need to get away from the mind amen and to get and to live out of our hearts by the grace of almighty god and again because why because the bible says it's not me that lives it's christ living in me what christ living in me oh if christ is living in you christ is in control of your thoughts christ is in control of your spirit your feelings your attitude your actions and your reactions oh yeah so it's not you it's jesus amen oh brother in all circumstances in all situations this happens that happens you know and you have to deal with this and deal with that deal with these situations family friends neighbors amen your jobs or whatever it is brother i tell you this if you've got the holy ghost this is this is how you respond to it i don't care where you are what you're doing amen it's not you it's the holy ghost in you amen as i said that when i when i was working in the indian the retail business and for a number of years and and and wonder there were points when they they were wondering oh mr lost what are you doing don't you want to do this when you do that i can't because one time there we were looking they were looking for something in in a store that i had that i was part of the management of and look over there look over there and and they they come up mr lush why aren't you looking for this well i said the lord knows where it is you tell me you know what i said yes the lord would tell me amen see even in my job no matter what it is it wasn't me and my ideas my feelings i go by my intellect no i was still led by the spirit of god i was still under his control brother no matter what you are doing in your education no matter what you are doing rather in your job no matter what it is brother you god is in control amen again it's not you living it's not you doing this it's jesus amen brother i tell you he'll help you in in your school he'll help you in your university he'll help you in your job amen brother amen or how many times have i consulted the lord even when i was working over there in retail business and i needed to do this and i felt to do this i felt to do that amen i was following his leadership amen i wanted to do what god wanted me to do amen and sometimes they wonder well how in the world do no matter what you do this works and that works and this works well it was god it's not me it was god if it was only you maybe it's not going to work but if it's god it'll work amen god's got a reason for doing this and doing it this way in that way amen and again like i said i took my saying for the truth as i said that time let me say it again that when another part of the master came out and says oh mr lush we want you to go tell that person this i said no way i said that's not the truth no he said they don't know that jesus go tell them amen i said no if you want a lie you gonna tell it i said i'm not gonna do it amen and they and he had to do it and i assumed that he did it i didn't do it yeah amen you take your stand brother it's your education if it's in school if it's in university amen if it's your job no matter what it is you go that you go forth as christ amen they don't they don't understand it but they're working with jesus jesus is working with them yeah amazing oh god help us that we are so dead to ourselves is not me that lives is christ living in me oh yeah so they do our failings amen and so under his control praise the name of the lord praise the lord and again as i said when i was just stood there and i just waiting and another brother in the manager come up mr lush what are you doing i said i'm working they said we're not doing nothing well i said this is part of it right here i said i'm doing this and i'm doing that i got that done i got that oh it's okay yeah and then again it comes oh got a question to ask you what do you preach i said do i pray i said yes sometimes amen i'll tell you this you're preaching in your life oh yeah we're all preaching even the sisters amen and the brothers you're the young and the old you're preaching through through the life you live oh yeah even in school you're preaching you're reflecting jesus you're reflecting the word of god you're reflecting heaven amen by the grace of god oh my brother my sister just think what god's looking for and god requires of us oh my again brother so you can absolutely truly amen by the holy ghost say it's not me that lives it is christ that liveth in me amen by the grace of almighty god amen so brother sister turn with me to another scripture right here in romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8. hallelujah do god be the glory there's too many that are on my brother they're representing the church and they're representing this they're representing the uh even a doctrine even this theology that theo who's representing jesus amen who's reflecting jesus brother at all when it comes to a doctrine theology no matter what it is we know it's the whole truth nothing but the truth but if we're reflecting it we're reflecting jesus amen we're reflecting jesus we're reflecting the truth amen we're not just talking about jesus we're going to we're going to live for jesus amen and reflect the life of jesus reflect the nature of jesus reflect the thoughts of jesus by the grace of god amen so brother there's too many just put in the emphasis on all of this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine brother it's christ he's the word amen oh well we gotta we gotta re be witness for this doctrine lord if you're witness for jesus you're gonna witness for the truth amen if you're witness or jesus you'll be witnessing for this doctrine that doctrine just leave it with the lord amen and let god bring it out in your everyday living amen let god bring it out when you when you when he brings you face to face with this one and you gotta you gotta be a witness well you're going to just speak the truth no not here religiously or to tell them about this doctrine tell them about that wrong just go go and live and live and tell them about jesus amen encourage them to believe jesus encourage them to stay with jesus encourage them to have an experience with jesus amen oh well and if they do those doctrines that'll come out oh yeah god will require them to believe this and believe that but there's too many behaviors whether they're just putting emphasis on this doctrine on this doctrine oh yeah we believe this doctrine oh yeah we believe that's why god sent the prophet for this for this for this brother god sent the prophet amen to get us into the word as a part of the bride oh praise the lord oh but the word is this but there's three more emphasis on the doctrine and the letter of the word than there is on the spirit amen for years we've had to fight it for years and again as i said the first sermon that i preached as as a young man of them around 19 years 8 or 18 or 19 years old amen to correct believers concerning their attitude and their spirit and how they walked and how they talked and how they lived and amen as i said oh brother yes i saw it over and over again amen now that they would look down their noses at anybody that didn't believe the message looked down their noses at pentecostals looked down their noses at others in this church and that church and that church i said don't you do that there you go but for the grace of god amen you just pray the grace of god in their hearts and in their souls amen so brother and again understand this and the many are called if you were chosen and again the calls are not lost no not by any maze the chosen is the bride oh yeah the chosen is the right but again then the bride is in the city but then there's going to be others outside the city so you better be on your guard amen keep your spirit right keep your attitude right amen as jesus did oh yeah the disciples didn't understand jesus you know attitude toward the scribes and the pharisees and this one and that one and so on oh but lord th there this there that jesus came back to get his disciples keep your spirit right and your attitude right amen even toward them out there oh yeah brother and again who crucified jesus well i have a brother perry reading brings on that years ago amen and he said until he said i was going somewhere he said and i walked past the mirror and i looked in oh he said that's a crucified jesus amen we crucified jesus you crucified jesus amen because he laid down his life for us we amen to redeem us to redeem you to redeem me amen oh that's what put him on the cross that's what put him on the cross amen because without him there's no redemption without him there'll be no salvation so brother keep your attitude right your spirit right amen and you'll have the divine love of god in control of your life divine love of god in control brother as you look out well jesus looked out and he loved them just just automatically amen oh it's been peter and he was challenging peter on love but i got a lot of believers unlawful oh yeah oh you just love believers no no no did jesus just love this one and that one jesus no god so loved the world amen they can't they can't say he didn't love him he did amen and hallelujah and he showed his law so do we show our love not our doctrines and condemn them and put them down and brought them down put them down no let's just show the love of god look what god has done look what god is doing amen look what god's going to do amen redemption redemption redemption amen by by the grace of almighty god so brother i tell you this or yet i'm predestinated to to believe this predestination to this prison amen to these doctrines brother i tell you what we're predestinated to is adoption amen we're protesting to adoption oh yeah but god does all these things amen to bring out his adopted seed sons and daughters of god amen you're adopted you will believe if you're an avid you'll stay with the word if you're adopted amen we are placed as redeemed sons and daughters of god by the grace of god so brother help us to understand adoption we're amen we are sons and daughters and we're brought back as sons and daughters we're placed as sons and daughters and re to complete adoption amen full adoption by the grace of almighty god and i'll share with you some quotes eventually for from the prophet but again in romans chapter 8 and beginning to read at verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry abba father hallelujah the revelation of our father praise the lord if he is he was amen amen if he is he was praise the lord even from the beginning even from eternity oh oh i was born a few years ago 50 years ago whenever it was no you were born before the foundation of the world you're in it you were in his mind in his thoughts amen in his plan and his purpose in his predestination before the foundation of the world he knew you amen like god amen like oh brother god asked job the question god asked you the question where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth and and the sons of god shouted for joy sons of god would joel bring you a son of god amen brothers take us back to where we come from praise the lord so that we're going to enter into the revelation amen getting the eternal life to take us to take us back praise the lord oh brother sister it's not new to us you're just bringing back my memory we forgot it but he brought back our memories oh and memory brings back responsibility amen oh when i begin to think this remember that oh yes oh forgive me lord forgive me amen hallelujah to god be the glory for we ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to there again yeah well you got it we're not going to get it again no this is redemption i'm bringing you away from that not that you're afraid of this afraid of that you're wondering oh about this life and that life where we're going no no he said you have received the spirit of bondage you haven't received that again to fear amen but you have received the spirit of adoption hallelujah i pray god we have the spirit of adoption amen as sons and daughters of god and we're back adopted back into the family of god by the grace of god oh brother hallelujah it's a revelation that will humble us oh a revelation of a chemo symbol amen it's a revelation what caused us to keep looking up thank you lord thank you thank you amen so the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen hallelujah amen not were not will be we are the children of god hallelujah amen this is tremendous because there's too many too much revelation thinking oh we were this we were that but thank god he did this for us and oh yeah now now we're this we were oh he made us sons of no he but yeah but where when oh back 50 years ago no before time yeah we were the sons and daughters of god in the mind of god by the grace of god so the spirit itself and that's the holy spirit and it says bear witness with the our spirit that we are the children of god the holy ghost is bearing witness with your spirit he comes in and you identify with oh yes that's me thank you lord i believe it i believe it i believe the word i believe this and he goes right on back right on back yo we stay we stay with the word amen and if children then heirs of god enjoy theirs with christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also glorified together amen if you are the true seed of god you are the true sons and daughters of god amen brother with jesus you're suffering with him and we may be also glorified to yes we suffer are you suffering can you take your stand for the word you're suffering amen suffering separation you're you're suffering condemnation the the world's going to look down on you the word is going to criticize you the world's going to condemn you amen sometimes it might be family friends and neighbors would you just keep keep your spirit right keep moving on amen we're not going to compromise not by any maids brother we don't compromise for no one not by any means why we got we don't feel there's no reason to compromise i love the lord and he loves me and i pray the grace of god to the to family friends and neighbors lord and i just keep taking my stand amen knowing this that god does all things well amen knowing this that god's attitude and god's spirit towards family friends and neighbors is the same as yours yeah we're not there to hate we're not there to condemn amen no doubt not by any means you don't condemn man you might condemn faith this faith and that faith you might condemn this and this doctrine that doctrine no no take your stand against it but again keep your spirit right keep your attitude right amen whatever you do avoid a self-righteous attitude amen there's too many so-called believers that are so self-righteous oh i'm i'm the best and i'm this and i'm that and they're they're the devil you're this you're the no no brothers the grace of god we are what we are amen praise the lord so he said we suffer with him we may be also glorified together hallelujah for i reckon that the sufferings of this present times are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen help us to believe oh yeah brother if you got it you're going to be real humble oh you're gonna be real sweet and humble spirit considering oh my you consider that i was born in sin shape that iniquity come to the world speaking life oh my and look what jesus did oh my jesus came to redeem me jesus came to give me this new new anointing oh lord thank you oh yeah it'll keep you humble by the by grace amen so he said the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god is does god wait any longer in your life are we coming forth with the manifestation of sons and daughters of god amen not religious people oh not bible believers members oh not all are not just followers of william branham no brother it's like i said there are those that follow william branham therefore those that are following his son yeah but i'll tell you this he got us to follow jesus amen he points us to jesus by grace amen so the creature was made subject to vanity but not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature self also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god hallelujah brother grace that we're going to be in his liberty his freedom under his anointing again not not the false anointing of the devil again be careful because again as i said the first evangelist was the devil god gave the word that the devil came and preached it to eve but he added to it he added one word but don't bother me don't don't have not one word stay with the word amen well if it's god brother is god going to reveal christ in you if it's god in the word and the message that god has given us brother is going to reflect jesus amen it's reflecting the resurrection and the rapture glorially asked in the name of jesus amen because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travailed and pained together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves for the adoption the adoption to know the redemption of our body we got the experience in our souls but brother we're hungry and thirsting for the redemption experience in our bodies hallelujah oh hallelujah i've been redeemed yeah and i know i'm predestinated from my soul but brother we're predestined onto a glorified body by the grace of god amen let's keep pressing on amen placed as redeemed sons and daughters of god we are the sons and daughters of god and we were cut off by sin but we are re we are adopted back by redemption amen praise the lord we think adoption is oh he's just adopting strangers no he's adopting he's adopting us back the problem of god said no he said we're not well oh yeah well he's going to bring us he's going to make his sons and daughters and bring us back no we are sons and daughters and that's why he said adoption he said it's to bring us back amen we were cut off but now he said adoption is going to bring us back by the grace of god oh wonderful wonderful wonderful we are adopted back as the sons and daughters of god by the redemption of the son of god amen and we are rejoicing in spiritual adoption honoring thirsting for physical adoption in glorified bodies amen oh brother oh yes not that god's god's going to do this god well god did it and brother why is god working on us now because we are sons and daughters we are his seed that's why he's working on you now amen oh well i i well i i was maybe this serpent seed i was the devil seed but now god has changed me and in a new birth and so on no he just brings you back to himself oh yeah brother i'll tell you the devil's children are not going to be saved but god's children and i tell you god knows where they are amen and all down through the ages god has given his word to bring out his seed amen he said the seed of god all the way down through have responded to the word amen by the grace of god amen turn with me to galatians chapter 4. praise the lord hallelujah amen in galatians chapter 4 and verse 1. now i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all oh yeah oh we we were we were like the rest of the sinners out there we were all born in sin that's right but brother not all not all out there are the sons and daughters of god they're not the seed of god oh no amen so he said i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but he said is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father hallelujah to bring us back to the revelation of our sonship even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world right but again not because we were the sons and daughters of the devil no no we're the seed of god born in sin but when the fullness of time was come and god sent forth this son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were on under the law that we might receive hallelujah the adoption of sons it's an experience amen that brings us back into fellowship with god whereby we can cry father amen father father father oh what why because we got the revelation of who our father was who our father is for he's the lord that's what the bible says whereby now we can cry father father father amen amen brother water yes because why we got the eternal revelation of where we come from who we are oh oh i'm your son yes my son you are mine i come here to redeem you to bring you back amen i want you just just i give you this word and god knew his sons and daughters would believe his word yeah oh yeah he knew hallelujah and he says because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father praise the lord oh yeah the bible says now we can cry father father father amen wherefore he said thou art no more a servant he said but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ prays the name of the lord hallelujah do god be the glory amen for he has said again you know that i threw in for infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first and he said my temptation which was in my flesh he despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus amen grace of god this the sonship recognizing the sons of god that are sent to minister to us amen and to encourage us so brother god help us in adoption true holy ghost adoption he's recognizing it's a confirmation of our sonship praise the lord is it's not oh well he's going to give me some no no he's confirming your sonshi oh yeah you this is what you were this is what yeah it was in your heart in your soul amen and by the grace of god the power anointing of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost is confirming is not it's not our adoption it's confirming our adoption by the grace of god back to the family of god amen just bear with me in the message on adoption and brother brown preached four messages on adoption and in part one he said oh let's see [Applause] glory and he said again in the message on adoption in the first part that he that he ministered he said oh i tell you he says some people are afraid to receive the holy ghost they're afraid that they might speak with tongues they're afraid that somebody might say now he's one of them tongues guys and he said they're afraid to come to the church and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because they're ashamed of it and somebody said he said i'll have he should recall this and recall that and he said listen if they don't like what we did yesterday just watch what we're going to do tomorrow and he said that's the thing to do he said just keep going on amen as believers amen you know i know we did just well i i i became a believer you know so some years ago yeah and there's a lot brother they oh yeah now they're just like a denomination that's right amen because it wasn't by the holy ghost in their hearts it was by the text of the word in their heads amen and there's too many believers that just got the text but they don't have the spiritual revelation in their souls amen brother it can be the preacher controlling you through your head but it's god controlling you through your heart amen and he said they don't like what we did yesterday watch what we're going to do tomorrow and it should just keep going on there's no end to it because it is the lord it is god and he said you see as i said in my sermon this morning we are so much afraid that we want a saul to teach us but not paul and he said we want saul from some seminary to tell us how we must do our religion he said that is on the other side of jordan amen this side the holy spirit leads but the other side is man and he said listen god revealed more of it to me as he revealed it he said just keeps bringing it out and he said he never takes away from what has been he just keeps adding more on to it on what to the word the revelation he gives you the revelation the word it separates you and then he gives you more revelation to keep us moving on and looking up by the grace of god amen praise the lord bear with me hallelujah praise the lord amen something it might be a different book that i was reading yes a different book that i was in and looking for the paragraphs that i have listed here praise the lord he said listen he said you are the firstborn into the kingdom of the holy by the holy ghost and how many know that he said all right he said next you are predestinated unto what he said you're predestinated unto adoption and he said what is it you're predestinated onto the placing a man by the grace of god you're born by the holy ghost into the kingdom of god and then you're placed by adoption amen into the position where god wants you and to do so that god can is going to do this three through you and with you and in you amen oh brother but one thing to come into the message it's another thing to god for god to positionally place us in adoption amen because brother is one thing to be in the message be a witness of the message of that well brother what is god doing in the message what's god doing through the message what's what is it all about it's i'll tell you what god wants it to climax with and that is the resurrection and the rapture amen amen so brother and not all that come to the word that all that come to the message are going to be resurrected no no again many are called but few were chosen when you consider that there's something like almost two or maybe more and then two million believers around the world supposedly believe in this word supposedly believe in this message supposingly believing that god sent a prophet amen and the opening of the seven sails but brother not all that's not going to be 2 million going to rapture not living saints to us to the extent the prophet of god said oh my he said there might be a dozen they said or someone said to brother brown says oh brother branham wha what will you do he said if god told you to go and pick up the bride for the rapture concerning the saints that were alive and he said i might find it doesn't what brother is going to go on and on and on to let to the true believers get fewer and fewer and fewer amen well but brother there's going to be so many like there's 2 million or more around the world that's saying they believe the message yes but more and more and more they're getting more and more denominated more and more organized oh yeah they are yes they are god of us brother that we're going to appreciate the word and the message and the revelation now as we as we did when we first come to it amen but there's too many have settled down into denominate denominational like attitudes denominational like spirits amen but brother the bride is not she's not denominated it's not just a doctrine brother it's the revelation of god look up amen we're coming home lord we're going home and he said we have been born by the holy ghost all of us is that right he said we're born and he said and then after being born we are predestinated unto the adoption amen to be placed in the body of christ what for the resurrection and the rapture brother okay we're in the message but are we predestined to adoption oh i've had this experience of that experience exactly but are you experiencing adoption by the grace of god oh brother said complete hallelujah a complete change the grace of god he said we're predestinated to be sons and unto adoption amen what is god doing he's predestinated his sons and daughters to adoption by the grace of almighty god amen he said we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we've received the spirit of adoption amen do you have the spirit of adoption it keeps you mindful of him keeps you mindful of jesus keeps you mindful of where you come from why you are here and where you are going and how you're going to get there amen brother that's why we are pilgrims and strangers in this world whoa do you think the world's a stranger to you is the world strange or do you really fit into the world do you really fit into into into into where you're living and where you want to live if you're a seed of god no matter where you are you don't fit in you're uncomfortable lord we want to go home amen i'll tell you if we're really really the seed of god we're going to act as jesus acted when he said how long shall i be with you why he wanted to leave he said no man is to send it up only that came down even the son of man who is who is in heaven and he wanted to go back are you wanting to go back do you want to go if you feel that's where you come from and you're here to be tested and tried do you want to go back yes amen brother if you're a seed of god you've had enough you've had enough of this world amen why because jesus had enough until he eats it how long shall i be with you amen he wanted to go grace of god he said after you're adopted he said you are replaced he said in adoption he said you're placed in the body correctly you're a son and there's been a dispensation he said of the mosaic law and he said a dispensation of christ a dispensation of church organization and there was dispensation of the outpouring of the holy spirit now is the dispensation of adoption oh i thought it was just a mystery of god yeah but that is the mystery of god amen is bring us to the fullness of redemption and brother the fullness of redemption is adoption amen he said watch it he said when he said in the dispensation of the fullest of times he he might gather together in one all things in christ amen we have obtained an inheritance and somebody has to leave you something and he said god before the foundation of the world left you something he said a name written on the book amen and he said in whom also we have obtained an inheritance and he said how do we get this inheritance how did we get it because we walked upright how do we get this inheritance because we were predestinated amen according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will brother you're predestinated god is in you working all things after the council of his will you're not living for family friends neighbors you're living for jesus you can't really you can't really be a witness to family friends and neighbors unless you're living for jesus brother it's not it's not you it's jesus in you amen he said we receive an inerrance by predestination he said i inherited something he said i and he said what inheritance and he said there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance jesus left you an inheritance he said he said he only come down and paid he paid for your inheritance he brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and god give you your inheritance amen and god by his foreknowledge amen seen exactly who we who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved and he sent jesus to save those they had already chosen amen and amen and amen to god be the glory amen be with me praise the lord hallelujah okay brother faith comes by hearing the word god help us what faith are we looking for what faith do we need it's for the resurrection rapture please hear the word that gives us the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen yeah the word is here but sometimes god sent the messenger to highlight it and to point out things here that oh that we wouldn't see that we wouldn't notice that wouldn't strike us god help us to catch it he said he said we have obtained an inheritance in our lord jesus christ somebody has to leave you something but he said god left me an inheritance when he put my name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and you say wait a minute brother jesus did that when he died for you no he never jesus came to purchase the inheritance not to make me an invitation he said i i was inheritance my name was put on the last book of life before the foundation of the world and he said jesus came to redeem me oh yeah not that i or not not to give me the narrative it's mine and i he said this is mine this is mine that's mine jesus paid the price for me to have it praise the lord and look he said as predestinated us unto his this inheritance and if i'm a right inheritance of something if god is knocking at my heart saying will and random i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance of eternal life now he said god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me amen and real to you grace he said blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance to be to be what inheritance the sonship of god to be a son of god now he said this may choke you to death but did you know that man that are the sons of god are amateur gods you think you're god well the prophet has said he said gods give birth to gods so you're a god your sons and daughters of god through your gods amen praise the lord resurrection power of resurrection rapture is in you amen whether the life the life the separated life that we're living is the resurrection rapture in us separated separated separated to all caught up by the grace of god when we are totally separated we'll be caught up amen he said we are amateur gods amen but glory said we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who will come back to take it over again amen praise the lord praise the lord oh lord grace he said the bible said now watch in the last days there's going to be two classes of people and one of them is going to have the seal of god and the other one the mark of the beast if the seal of god is the holy ghost then without the holy ghost is the mark of the beast so i trust we got the seal of god not the mark of the beast unbelief the the mark of the beast is unbelief and doubt but if you got the seal of god you believe the word of god you believe what god has done you believe what god is doing amen the bible said watch because in the last days these two classes of people again one of them is that the seal of god the other the mark of the beast and if the seal of god is the holy ghost and without the holy ghost is the mark of the beast and the bible said the two spirits would be so close together it would deceive the very elective possible god help us or you think oh it's going to be out there no no it's going to be around the message be on your guard this is bible this is thus saith the lord it is written concerning that which is to come he did he did warn us and he said that it would deceive the very elect if possible amen this is amazing but brother ought to put us on our guard put us on our toes let's make sure that it's the word amen don't just follow signs and wonders follow the word by the grace of god and the bible says as he said upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said take heed that no man deceive you amen for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many i trust by the grace of god we're under the right anointing we're under the right revelation of christ amen not a false anointing but the true anointing christ in his word christ revealing his word amen to get us to look up if there's anything that christ wants to do at this hour is the resurrection and the rapture the bible said watch and he said this he said concerning the seal of god and the mark of the beast be on your guard and knowing there's ten virgins went out to meet the lord all sanctified all holy every one of them sanctify five word dilatory and let their lights go out five had oil in their lamps and behold the bridegroom cometh and the five that had oil in their lamps went into the marriage supper and the others were left outside where they were weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth are you are you entering into the revelation of the marriage supper of the lamb this is it ought to put us on our guard make sure sure you're under under the hearing of the word that's ordained to give us the faith that we need at this hour because jesus warned us of the deception when you really really receive the holy ghost how long is it to last you until the next revival until grandma crosses your path unto the boss balls you out no he said until the day of redemption hallelujah amen you're just as you are now only you've got you've moved into another body just you just changed houses so you just turned the old thing away and let it rot on down and moved into a new one amen for if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting if this one out here is going down praise the lord fine don't worry about it amen we got another one waiting that will never pass away the name of the lord amen amen and amen do god be the glory let me just try to finish with a couple more quotes here oh listen remember when this breath passes from this life to you old people or to you young people and you mothers when you see your

going to be a again going to be a young man or woman by the grace of god hallelujah thank you jesus amen believe us thou this amen listen he said you'll throw your arms around him and he won't be a hobby he'll be your brother oh my you'll be so much greater than hubby and he said you think you loved him sure you did but that was filio love human love but he said in glory it's agave love divine

ghost and they got divine love they're more than friendly oh yeah oh friendly i do this they'll do that and they're nice they're nice yeah but if you got divine love you lay down your life for one another amen that's the difference he said listen i believe them people are saved yes sir i truly believe it but always and much more is it to walk when you know where you're walking how much no to just know what you're doing instead of staggering and stumbling along let's just stand up in the light and walk in the light and know which way you're headed he said the lord be with us amen grace in the name of jesus we'll leave it there i guess let's see he just said until that time god let me stay on the field and be loyal let me i don't care what the cost is how many what i do or this that or
