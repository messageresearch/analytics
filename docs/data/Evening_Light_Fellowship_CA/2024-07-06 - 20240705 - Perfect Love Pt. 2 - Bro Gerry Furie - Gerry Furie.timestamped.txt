[1:01:06] amen God bless you Saints welcome once
[1:01:09] again amen I just want to thank brother
[1:01:11] Jonathan once again and sister Bianca uh
[1:01:13] make me feel welcome you know I mean
[1:01:17] when I started out last night like the
[1:01:18] Icebreaker like brother John said you
[1:01:20] know when you come in you start
[1:01:21] preaching to a group of people that you
[1:01:23] don't really know and and and sometimes
[1:01:26] it comes away like my wife said to me he
[1:01:28] says man that was a real Icebreaker it
[1:01:30] was you know I said it was going to be
[1:01:32] pastorial and it was real pastoral he
[1:01:33] say you don't preach like that outside
[1:01:35] your your pulpit and I just you know you
[1:01:38] want to be led by the Holy Spirit you
[1:01:40] want to have the mind of Christ you can
[1:01:42] sit there and Friends uh and you want
[1:01:45] you want to be able to get something to
[1:01:47] the heart of the people to have help
[1:01:49] them in their in their daily walk that's
[1:01:51] why you know I'm going to go on perfect
[1:01:53] love again here tonight but coming from
[1:01:55] a different angle because the
[1:01:57] understanding is that God wants a
[1:01:59] manifestation we can talk about the
[1:02:01] letters discuss about the letter we can
[1:02:03] talk about a debate about Doctrine it's
[1:02:05] not about having perfect Doctrine it's
[1:02:07] about having perfect love because
[1:02:09] brother bam tells us the only thing
[1:02:11] that's going to enter in is perfect love
[1:02:13] he said all your religious
[1:02:15] demonstrations all the things you do and
[1:02:17] all this and all it will not count in
[1:02:19] that day unless you have perfect love
[1:02:21] and that's what we're after is perfect
[1:02:23] love we want to be able to be able to
[1:02:25] submit ourselves and say Lord you take
[1:02:27] over you use me and then we then we're
[1:02:30] on our way amen we want to be on the
[1:02:33] right road map amen if you have your
[1:02:35] Bibles handy we're turn to uh you know
[1:02:37] Luke chapter 4 and we're going to read
[1:02:40] from verse 16 but you know the thing is
[1:02:43] uh you know we want to be able to
[1:02:44] express the perfect love of God and the
[1:02:47] only way you can actually Express it is
[1:02:48] knowing your place and knowing who you
[1:02:50] are and and I and I spoke about this a
[1:02:53] few times over the years and I know
[1:02:55] brother Johnson I'm going to just touch
[1:02:57] on a few things he's probably heard me
[1:02:58] somewhere else preach these things some
[1:03:00] of these things but I just want to
[1:03:02] understand is the pattern of the word is
[1:03:04] the brooding the speaking and the
[1:03:06] dividing and then the manifestation see
[1:03:09] the word is here to manifest the word is
[1:03:13] not just to stay in the Bible it's not
[1:03:15] just to stay in the message book it's
[1:03:16] here to manifest and where manifest in
[1:03:19] your lives we are the word made flesh in
[1:03:22] this day we the second coming of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ right bridegroom bride amen so
[1:03:32] friends the understanding this is that
[1:03:34] when Jesus comes on the scene he walked
[1:03:36] out of the volume of the book just like
[1:03:39] we've walked out of the volume of the
[1:03:41] book he walked out of the volume of the
[1:03:43] book of the Old Testament we're walking
[1:03:45] out of the volume of the book of the New
[1:03:47] Testament
[1:03:49] amen and you cannot express perfect love
[1:03:52] unless you know who you are now cous he
[1:03:57] came to Nazareth where he had been
[1:03:59] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:04:01] to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[1:04:04] he stood up for to read and there was
[1:04:07] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:04:09] prophet Isaiah and when he had open the
[1:04:12] book now he's opening the book Because
[1:04:15] We believe We preach from an open book
[1:04:18] nothing hidden from us so he opens the
[1:04:21] book and now you got to understand this
[1:04:23] is that he opens the book and he found
[1:04:25] the place where it is written for
[1:04:28] him he wasn't quoting talking about
[1:04:32] Moses now he's talking to Pharisees here
[1:04:35] he's doing this in front of Pharisees
[1:04:37] he's gone to the church he's gone to the
[1:04:38] synagogue and he's preaching to Prophet
[1:04:42] quoting
[1:04:45] people that believe Moses said this
[1:04:47] Moses said this but that's not what he
[1:04:49] said he said the Spear of the Lord is
[1:04:51] upon didn't say
[1:04:54] Moses he didn't say brother
[1:04:57] bradam the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:05:01] now they're going to get mad at this cuz
[1:05:03] he's they're not they're not going to be
[1:05:05] talking about their Prophet now we all
[1:05:08] believe God's in a prophet I believe
[1:05:11] God's in a Prophet this day for us to
[1:05:14] get us ready for a Rapture so he says
[1:05:17] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:05:18] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:05:20] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:05:22] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:05:25] oh I didn't I didn't probably switch it
[1:05:27] right he says preach the gospel of the
[1:05:30] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:05:31] brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance
[1:05:33] of the captives the and recovering the
[1:05:35] sight to the Blind and set of Liberty
[1:05:37] them that were are bruised to preach the
[1:05:39] acceptable year of the Lord he closed
[1:05:42] the book now the book is O was open to
[1:05:45] him he hands it back and it's closed to
[1:05:47] the Pharisees that's
[1:05:50] right right he's the open book now he's
[1:05:53] the very life he's become comes the open
[1:05:56] book they can't take it they can't see
[1:05:59] it they're going to get mad at
[1:06:02] them right he said he closed the book
[1:06:05] gave it again to the ministers sat down
[1:06:07] and the eyes of all of them were in the
[1:06:10] synagogue were fastened on him now this
[1:06:12] is a traditional thing that was
[1:06:14] happening and he begin to say unto them
[1:06:17] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:06:21] your ears we can say the same thing
[1:06:26] message people
[1:06:28] can't but the bride
[1:06:30] can they are message
[1:06:33] people that's right not seeing the word
[1:06:36] made flesh I mentioned it last night now
[1:06:38] we want to unfold ourselves in the
[1:06:42] manifestation in the manifestation of
[1:06:44] the word revealed in this day do we not
[1:06:47] amen let's have a word of prayer Father
[1:06:49] in Heaven Lord Jesus I'm just thankful
[1:06:51] God for your grace for your mercy for
[1:06:54] your love in our lives
[1:06:56] father there is no way I'll be able to
[1:06:58] see myself unless you point me to it
[1:07:00] Lord father as the Holy Ghost come in
[1:07:03] this day to lead us into all truth I
[1:07:05] pray father that the people will be able
[1:07:07] to see themselves in a greater light
[1:07:09] than they've ever seen before granted I
[1:07:11] pray I ask it in the name of Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ amen you may have your seat
[1:07:19] amen now this wasn't unusual in that
[1:07:23] day because what they would would do you
[1:07:26] know in their as their custom was they
[1:07:29] would get up and they would pick out
[1:07:31] three men from the synagogue or three
[1:07:33] men that was at the synagogue that day
[1:07:36] and they would get up get them to come
[1:07:37] up and actually read the scripture and
[1:07:40] they'd have three priests get up and
[1:07:41] read the scripture also now they didn't
[1:07:43] have scripture like we have today as far
[1:07:45] as the Bible and stuff like this they
[1:07:47] would have Scrolls and they'd be passed
[1:07:49] around to different synagogues around
[1:07:51] Israel and the thing is it just so
[1:07:53] happened in that day that here they had
[1:07:56] the scroll of Isaiah so here Jesus gets
[1:07:59] up and he knows all the plan of God he
[1:08:01] knows he has an understanding that
[1:08:02] what's going on but they don't have an
[1:08:04] understand what's going on they they're
[1:08:06] looking at him as he gets up there and
[1:08:08] he begins to identify actually who he
[1:08:10] was and he stood there before the people
[1:08:13] and he said this day the scripture is
[1:08:14] fulfilled and they begin to say well man
[1:08:17] that's too much that's just too far
[1:08:18] you're going too far now and then
[1:08:20] remember friends the thing is it was his
[1:08:22] custom to go to the synagogue it wasn't
[1:08:24] like he was a stranger he grew up in
[1:08:26] that church if I can say it that way he
[1:08:28] grew up with those people he knew those
[1:08:29] people they knew who he was they knew
[1:08:31] about his their father and like they
[1:08:33] call him Joseph they Mar they knew about
[1:08:35] the family they knew all the Dynamics
[1:08:37] and everything but here Jesus gets up
[1:08:39] here and he begins to speak these things
[1:08:41] he begin to say unto them this day the
[1:08:44] script fulfilled in your ears that's why
[1:08:46] friends the thing is it's so important
[1:08:48] to understand as a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] that you're the word made flesh in this
[1:08:52] day and I know you probably heard this
[1:08:54] from over and over again for years and
[1:08:56] years and years but it's more important
[1:08:57] than it's ever has been before and the
[1:08:59] reason why that is is that all
[1:09:01] Redemption comes through the
[1:09:03] bride they cannot be made perfect
[1:09:06] without us right they cannot be made
[1:09:09] perfect without us and the fullness of
[1:09:10] the word came back in this day and what
[1:09:12] has it done what has it done it does not
[1:09:15] make us just a bunch of debaters and uh
[1:09:17] and understanding the letter and stuff
[1:09:19] like this and be able to debate these
[1:09:21] things but it's actually a fulfillment
[1:09:23] in the word of God see when Jes Jesus
[1:09:25] came 2,000 years ago it wasn't just to
[1:09:28] debate with the Pharisees and debate
[1:09:30] with with with the Sadducees of that day
[1:09:32] and show them how wrong they were but he
[1:09:34] was going to manifest something he was
[1:09:36] going to actually manifest the love of
[1:09:38] God see because that in those days the
[1:09:41] the at the synagogue it was a breeding
[1:09:43] ground for a lot of doctrinal issues and
[1:09:45] they actually go to the synagogue and
[1:09:47] they begin to debate amongst each other
[1:09:49] and fight amongst each other and this
[1:09:50] means that means that and here's Jesus
[1:09:53] stands up before them now it's one thing
[1:09:55] to read the scriptures but it's another
[1:09:57] thing when you read the scriptures and
[1:09:59] the scriptures are about you and the
[1:10:01] thing is that here was Jesus he comes
[1:10:03] amongst them and when he reads it it's
[1:10:05] not you know they would blaspheme him
[1:10:07] for what he said in some this but they
[1:10:09] would think that the letter was so holy
[1:10:11] and the scripture was so holy they
[1:10:13] wouldn't blaspheming in that but here
[1:10:15] they're blaspheming the very word that
[1:10:16] became before them and stood before them
[1:10:19] and said I am here I am I'm the one I'm
[1:10:21] the one that you've been waiting for but
[1:10:23] they didn't have that understanding and
[1:10:25] to today right now as the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:27] Christ comes before you and says I'm
[1:10:29] here I'm here right now that's
[1:10:30] identifying who you are see it's not
[1:10:33] just about debating the message never
[1:10:35] came just to debate the message never
[1:10:37] came just to be able to you know I know
[1:10:39] the third poll and I know this because
[1:10:41] remember was preaching on perfect love
[1:10:43] last night we didn't come for that
[1:10:45] because it it came for to manifest
[1:10:48] something that God had in his mind
[1:10:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:10:52] I'm here can we say the same thing I'm
[1:10:55] here here see because it's amazing to me
[1:10:57] that as we go on in this there's more
[1:10:59] splits there's more people have you know
[1:11:02] you they'll identify with certain
[1:11:04] portions of the message they'll identify
[1:11:06] with certain doctors of the message
[1:11:07] they'll identify with certain things
[1:11:09] that but when it really comes down and
[1:11:10] do they know who they actually are see
[1:11:13] because to understand how important is
[1:11:15] the message to us see how important is
[1:11:18] it what has it has it done for us
[1:11:20] because the consummation doesn't come by
[1:11:22] the letter the consummation comes by the
[1:11:25] manifestation see the thing is Jesus
[1:11:27] couldn't say he was the word unless he
[1:11:29] manifest the
[1:11:31] word see you cannot become the word on
[1:11:34] say you're the word unless you manifest
[1:11:36] it so he walked out of the Old Testament
[1:11:39] just like the brides walking out of the
[1:11:40] new test here today and you're between
[1:11:43] the stage of the pers possession what
[1:11:45] are we waiting for now we're waiting for
[1:11:46] the body change brother bah tells us
[1:11:49] that she's waiting for the revelation of
[1:11:51] the Rapture so understand this because
[1:11:53] we look at because is actually the the
[1:11:56] opening of the word in this day or the
[1:11:58] breaking the seals in the day is
[1:12:00] actually revealing the mystery of your
[1:12:03] life because just just to go off
[1:12:06] Sidetrack here when Tamar when he when
[1:12:09] she she you know of course we know the
[1:12:10] story of Tamar when uh you know Judah
[1:12:13] you know uh took her in as a prostitute
[1:12:15] and she conce or she conceived his seat
[1:12:18] and the thing is that she he he she
[1:12:20] asked one thing from him give me your
[1:12:22] signat a couple things from him but one
[1:12:24] of the main things with the sign
[1:12:25] and there and then she was pregnant with
[1:12:27] this child they he didn't know it but
[1:12:30] the thing is that they were going to
[1:12:31] burn her they're going to kill her all
[1:12:33] etc etc it's according to the law the
[1:12:35] custom of that day and the thing is that
[1:12:37] when she came for the for it to happen
[1:12:40] what was it she broke the seal and broke
[1:12:43] the mystery of her very life of who she
[1:12:46] actually was that she was the wife of
[1:12:48] Jude see that's what the seven seal did
[1:12:50] for our lives it was the breaking of the
[1:12:53] seal in our life and what it showed us
[1:12:56] that the the wife of Jesus Christ we're
[1:12:58] not just some denomination we're not
[1:13:00] just some message people quoting quotes
[1:13:02] and believe in a prophet that's been off
[1:13:03] the scene since 1965 we're the very
[1:13:06] manifestation of the word of this day so
[1:13:09] understand this is that Paul when he
[1:13:11] came on the scene and he began to speak
[1:13:13] to the Hebrew church and he began to
[1:13:15] talk to them and one of the things he
[1:13:17] said I'm going to look look at it
[1:13:18] because now he's talking to message
[1:13:20] people here and he and he goes on to
[1:13:21] Hebrews 3:13 I'm going I'm going to go
[1:13:24] real fast here later good foundation
[1:13:26] here he said but exhort one another
[1:13:28] while call today lest any of you be
[1:13:30] hardened through the deceitful of sins
[1:13:33] he's talking to message people Hebrews
[1:13:35] and now watch what he says here he's
[1:13:37] because the reason why he's talking to
[1:13:39] them they're not progressing in the word
[1:13:42] they believe the message they believe
[1:13:44] what Jesus did for them but they're not
[1:13:46] progressing the word he said for we are
[1:13:48] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:13:52] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:13:55] onto the end so in other words friends
[1:13:57] like I said last night see about this
[1:14:00] perfect love that we' been talking about
[1:14:03] is the thing is that when brother bam
[1:14:05] talks about it's like a vast ocean love
[1:14:07] of God and it and it and it comes down
[1:14:11] to a river comes down to a creek comes
[1:14:12] down to a cap even a bottle cap brother
[1:14:14] Bram says and think is that's the love
[1:14:16] of God now they got maybe a bottle cup
[1:14:19] but they had need and Paul is trying to
[1:14:21] get them up to an adult love not a
[1:14:24] teenager love not not a baby love but an
[1:14:26] actual mature love a love that say a
[1:14:30] husband and wife maybe been married for
[1:14:32] 40 years or 38 years how long we've been
[1:14:35] married dear 38 years okay I'm on on I'm
[1:14:37] on ball here I'm I'm in our good books
[1:14:39] now but understand this is that I love
[1:14:42] her more than I've ever loved her before
[1:14:45] when I first married I love her more now
[1:14:46] than I ever have what is it it grew it
[1:14:49] became mature that's the same thing with
[1:14:52] Christ see the thing is that we are made
[1:14:55] partakers of Christ he said if we hold
[1:14:58] the beginning of our confidence
[1:15:00] steadfast unto the end remember when I
[1:15:02] was talking about OE of little faith
[1:15:05] they didn't have confidence they didn't
[1:15:07] have trust in his word so Paul goes on
[1:15:10] and he says while it is said he said
[1:15:13] today if we hear will hear his voice
[1:15:16] Harden not your hearts as in the
[1:15:19] provocation so in other words don't be
[1:15:22] like the Jews that came out of Egypt he
[1:15:24] said for some when they were heard did
[1:15:26] provoke how be it not all came out of
[1:15:28] the Egypt by Moses now they would have
[1:15:31] believed Moses was the messenger just
[1:15:33] like we believe brother Brown was our
[1:15:35] messenger actually I believe Christ is
[1:15:37] our
[1:15:39] Messenger right so watch this he said
[1:15:42] for some when they had heard had heard
[1:15:44] did provoke how be it not all that came
[1:15:46] out of the Egypt by Egypt by Moses but
[1:15:50] with whom see was he grieved 40 years
[1:15:54] what what was it not with them that had
[1:15:56] sinned whose carcass fell in the
[1:15:58] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[1:16:00] should not enter into his rest but to
[1:16:02] them that believed not so they could not
[1:16:06] enter in because they believed
[1:16:09] not right they had the
[1:16:12] promise God gave them the promise told
[1:16:15] them told them what they what they had
[1:16:18] but he says in verse 193 so we see that
[1:16:20] they could not enter in because of
[1:16:23] unbelief they had little little faith
[1:16:26] little
[1:16:27] trust God says it's yours go fight for
[1:16:31] it but watching verse chapter 4 verse
[1:16:34] one let us therefore fear now why are
[1:16:38] they fearing remember I was talking last
[1:16:41] day why was it why do people fear
[1:16:43] brother we can't move on because we have
[1:16:47] fear brother B one place he put puts it
[1:16:50] this way he says it's like a boat stuck
[1:16:52] in the harbor has a 440 Motors and could
[1:16:56] just rip around rip around but never go
[1:17:00] anywhere they never go anywhere because
[1:17:02] why they're too scared fear gripped the
[1:17:05] church amen he said lest a promise be
[1:17:09] left us of entering into his rest any of
[1:17:12] you should see him come short of
[1:17:14] it amen so he they got the message but
[1:17:19] the thing is they didn't move on they
[1:17:20] didn't progress with the message they
[1:17:23] talked about the message they debate the
[1:17:25] message they talked about the third pole
[1:17:27] they talked about the churches they
[1:17:28] talked about the different doctrines but
[1:17:31] they didn't move on with for onto US was
[1:17:33] the Gospel preach as well as unto them
[1:17:36] but the word preached did not profit
[1:17:38] them I'm preaching to you tonight the
[1:17:41] question is is a prophit in
[1:17:44] you it's
[1:17:46] important see because not being mixed
[1:17:49] with faith in them that HT
[1:17:51] it see we can preach and talk about it I
[1:17:55] could talk about many things but friends
[1:17:56] there's an unfulfilled part
[1:18:00] here we can talk about the masses and
[1:18:02] all the great stories and all I'm
[1:18:04] nothing against any of
[1:18:06] that but friends we never talk or preach
[1:18:09] about the unfulfilled part what's the
[1:18:12] unfulfilled part my body
[1:18:14] change and what I'm saying that is that
[1:18:17] the thing is is that people they can
[1:18:19] speak about things but they're no
[1:18:20] farther down the
[1:18:22] road is because the thing they they they
[1:18:25] could talk about the fulfilled every
[1:18:27] denomination talks about
[1:18:29] Calvary they talk about the fulfilled
[1:18:32] part nothing wrong with the calvary I'm
[1:18:34] not saying that that's where it starts
[1:18:36] but the thing is that what they do they
[1:18:38] stop they stop progressing they stop
[1:18:42] moving on see because what it is that
[1:18:44] the spirit of leosia gets a hold of you
[1:18:47] and say well I got the
[1:18:50] message I mean I I believe the messenger
[1:18:53] I believe just like you Brother jury
[1:18:55] absolutely I'm not we're not saying that
[1:18:58] but what it is that people become
[1:19:00] satisfied with a fulfilled part and they
[1:19:03] never move
[1:19:04] on they never move on they get satisfied
[1:19:08] with that and the thing is you know when
[1:19:10] we look at ourselves because our Focus
[1:19:12] many times is just on the fulfilled
[1:19:16] part amen so thing is that we w we want
[1:19:21] to focus somewhat on the unfilled part
[1:19:23] here on the unfill unfulfilled part
[1:19:26] because the thing is there's going to be
[1:19:27] a people that are going to fulfill the
[1:19:30] unfulfilled part
[1:19:32] amen amen see remember friend when
[1:19:35] Israel became satisfied the fulfilled
[1:19:37] part they started fighting for their
[1:19:39] full
[1:19:40] inheritance they're in the land for 28
[1:19:43] years and the thing is they failed to
[1:19:46] make progress and here was the Hebrew
[1:19:48] Church they were basking in what was
[1:19:50] already
[1:19:52] done oh man I'm a m believer oh that's
[1:19:55] so good I love coming to church we can
[1:19:57] be all church members here and we just
[1:20:00] ask what we know but the thing is we're
[1:20:02] in the age of the Harvest we're the age
[1:20:05] of the of the maturing of the grain see
[1:20:08] we're in the age of the climax of The
[1:20:09] maturity of the church this is our
[1:20:12] moment this is a predestin moment for me
[1:20:16] this is a predestinate moment for you
[1:20:18] see what it is Friends the thing is it's
[1:20:20] a time for the Holy Spirit to speak from
[1:20:23] our heart and become fulfilled what's
[1:20:26] already has not been fulfilled become
[1:20:29] that fulfillment see because Christ is
[1:20:32] here where the bride where the church
[1:20:35] where the bedding
[1:20:37] ground right thing is the SE comes forth
[1:20:42] you're to give
[1:20:44] birth right so Christ the male is here
[1:20:49] and you're the
[1:20:50] female he wants to seow seed
[1:20:55] right that's why friends the thing is
[1:20:57] we're looking to express the
[1:21:00] attribute now I want to just look at an
[1:21:02] example here and got this you know uh
[1:21:04] about you know when I I was going
[1:21:06] through a series on this back home but
[1:21:09] the thing is is that there was a woman
[1:21:10] here and I'll just show show it here got
[1:21:12] it out of the doctor's journals and from
[1:21:15] from actually from the states here I
[1:21:18] said the patient was married at 20 and
[1:21:20] wanted to start a family right away but
[1:21:22] after 3 years of trying without
[1:21:24] conception and she went to a doctor now
[1:21:26] relate this to the church he said it was
[1:21:29] known by medical SS an injury or an
[1:21:32] infection could cause the Fallopian
[1:21:34] tubes to close he said this Dr dunar Who
[1:21:37] described this case said it was known
[1:21:39] that the emotional crisis or shock can
[1:21:41] close these tubes just as it may make
[1:21:43] one clench one's fist he stated he found
[1:21:49] he found his patient tubes closed during
[1:21:52] ovulation and when the Ovation was over
[1:21:54] he found on the patient tubes open again
[1:21:57] it was believed in conclusion that Dr
[1:21:59] Dunbar believed the muscle contracted
[1:22:01] involuntarily at the illusion the
[1:22:03] closing the tubes was a woman's deep
[1:22:06] fear of pain associated with childbirth
[1:22:09] in her
[1:22:10] mind so she's wanting a baby and they're
[1:22:14] trying and trying but the problem was
[1:22:17] was in her
[1:22:18] mind and the thing is nothing wrong with
[1:22:21] her not nothing physically wrong with
[1:22:23] her but her fear in her mind of
[1:22:26] childbirth stopped the seed from coming
[1:22:30] into
[1:22:31] her amen so it caused her tubes to to
[1:22:35] close up so the
[1:22:38] subconscious remember brother BR talked
[1:22:40] about the subconscious and the conscious
[1:22:42] he said if you get the conscious and the
[1:22:44] subconscious and the Holy Ghost lined up
[1:22:47] he said something will
[1:22:49] happen amen he said you got to get him
[1:22:52] line up but he says what the problem is
[1:22:53] the subcon saying you really don't
[1:22:56] believe oh I believe no subconscious no
[1:22:58] you don't really believe you say you
[1:23:00] believe your conscious says it because
[1:23:02] you're yapping away and you're conscious
[1:23:04] saying this saying that and you're
[1:23:05] saying I believe I believe I believe but
[1:23:06] you're subconscious no you don't really
[1:23:08] believe and brother man says nothing can
[1:23:10] happen and there's a lot of things in
[1:23:12] the message brother talks about this and
[1:23:14] the subconsciousness says you really
[1:23:16] trally don't believe if I said to you
[1:23:17] you believe oh I believe I believe but
[1:23:19] your subconscious said no it's not
[1:23:21] because your subconscious like a
[1:23:22] supercomputer it's taking in all all
[1:23:24] this information over the years it will
[1:23:26] never happen it's like brother Jonathan
[1:23:28] saiding at the end of the service last
[1:23:29] night it won't happen so you don't
[1:23:30] believe it's going to happen so it never
[1:23:32] happens but hear this woman here he said
[1:23:34] these fears and images were placed in
[1:23:37] her when she was a child we see the
[1:23:39] woman's reproductive system reacting to
[1:23:42] the fears on the
[1:23:44] mind no friends the thing is it wasn't
[1:23:46] visible from the
[1:23:48] outside I can see you you dress nice
[1:23:51] nice congregation but things aren't
[1:23:53] visible on the outside to
[1:23:55] us everything is healthy everything is
[1:23:58] all right I'm a message believer I come
[1:24:00] to the church but all of a sudden
[1:24:02] friends the thing is the reason why we
[1:24:03] cannot reproduce Christ like God wants
[1:24:06] us to is because we have
[1:24:09] fear where we don't have the trust we
[1:24:12] don't have the confidence just like the
[1:24:14] children of Israel going in the promised
[1:24:16] land they say they believe they believe
[1:24:18] Moses believe we have the promise we
[1:24:19] have all this but they did not allow
[1:24:22] thems to go in and and many times we
[1:24:25] don't allow ourselves because we close
[1:24:28] off our fupi tubes spiritually speaking
[1:24:31] and we don't allow the seed to penetrate
[1:24:34] into us to Manifest this word see what
[1:24:37] it is for as we come to church we hear
[1:24:39] the word we hear the word we hear the
[1:24:41] word but we're scared see the thing is
[1:24:44] that God wants to repair us but we
[1:24:47] really don't don't let them because we
[1:24:50] close up and it's not that you're not
[1:24:53] believing but you close up oh ye of
[1:24:55] little faith right that's what Jesus
[1:24:58] said to the said to the disciples oh he
[1:25:01] of little faith why because they're
[1:25:03] closing up their flooping tubes don't
[1:25:05] sow that seed into me he brother R says
[1:25:08] don't be scared he says that's the
[1:25:10] reason you can't receive is because
[1:25:12] you're
[1:25:13] afraid it won't happen just as in your
[1:25:17] mind it already
[1:25:21] happened you're too scared to receive it
[1:25:25] now we all been around this message for
[1:25:28] years right most of
[1:25:31] us and what are the things that we're
[1:25:33] actually scared of in this
[1:25:36] message now there's always a human human
[1:25:39] element to us so we're scared of certain
[1:25:43] things now when I start preaching on the
[1:25:45] seventh seal people test up right away
[1:25:48] what's he going to say what's he going
[1:25:50] to say about the seven seal but you
[1:25:53] understand it's the seven seal it's not
[1:25:55] the first six that causes a
[1:25:57] confusion it's always the seven seal
[1:25:59] that causes a
[1:26:01] confusion and what the devil's done to
[1:26:03] us is brought it down to a
[1:26:06] debate and when you bring it down to a a
[1:26:10] debate it becomes
[1:26:13] non-effective and God wants this word to
[1:26:16] be effective in our life see this is why
[1:26:19] friends the thing is the seven seal is
[1:26:22] more than just an event is actually the
[1:26:25] mystery of your
[1:26:29] life that's what it came to do to
[1:26:32] actually unveil the mystery of your life
[1:26:36] so you stand there with the deed in your
[1:26:38] mind I got the message I got the M I got
[1:26:42] I got you know I got and the thing is
[1:26:43] that without revelation of what is
[1:26:46] supposed to be for you and no
[1:26:48] understanding of it you'll never
[1:26:50] manifest it see that's why friends the
[1:26:53] thing is is that it you know the seven
[1:26:55] seal is actually a perfect mute and when
[1:26:57] it's a mute it doesn't mean things
[1:26:59] aren't happening behind the
[1:27:01] scenes see the the seven seal is a
[1:27:04] perfect mute but you had to wait until
[1:27:06] it was time to say it the mute button
[1:27:09] was taken off and your mystery of your
[1:27:12] life becomes open
[1:27:15] hallelu of who you actually are and now
[1:27:19] you have access full access to this
[1:27:22] perfect love
[1:27:24] amen now watch what brother Brown says
[1:27:26] he says when the seven seal mystery in
[1:27:29] the book of redemption was broken open
[1:27:31] he said think of it but it's
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:34] broke I feel sorry for people that don't
[1:27:37] believe it's open because how do you
[1:27:39] know the Myster of your life is not
[1:27:42] open amen the lamb bricks you know what
[1:27:45] they were AED by it I believe they
[1:27:47] didn't know there it was they just
[1:27:49] stopped why what was it see friends the
[1:27:53] thing is there's people that
[1:27:54] believe and still believe that brother
[1:27:58] Bram didn't complete and open up the
[1:27:59] seventh seal now let me just say it this
[1:28:02] way remember the seven seal is a mute
[1:28:06] seals were preached God chose to turn
[1:28:09] off the mute button and brother Bram saw
[1:28:12] the third part of the seven
[1:28:15] seal he says there's great three great
[1:28:18] things he says there's three great
[1:28:22] things that goes with it one unfolded
[1:28:25] today or yesterday the other would
[1:28:26] unfolded today and there's one thing
[1:28:29] that I cannot interpret because it's an
[1:28:30] unknown language but the time is
[1:28:35] close now let's just take a look at some
[1:28:38] of this let's look at what the seven
[1:28:40] seal actually is because people get
[1:28:43] scared I know you frighten right now
[1:28:44] when I'm preaching on this I can just
[1:28:47] feel the atmosphere I don't have to be a
[1:28:49] prophet to discern
[1:28:51] this because really what the seven seal
[1:28:53] is is always you think it's a way out
[1:28:56] there but it's
[1:29:00] you I'll show you what brother Bram said
[1:29:03] he said we must
[1:29:05] remember that this seven seal is the end
[1:29:08] of time of all things now the breaking
[1:29:12] of the seventh
[1:29:14] seal the finish of the seventh seal are
[1:29:17] two different
[1:29:18] things the breaking of the seventh
[1:29:21] seal and the finishing of the seven seal
[1:29:25] is two separate things land breaking the
[1:29:29] seals get the book of the symbol form
[1:29:32] lamb takes the book to claim his bride
[1:29:35] this is why people will say there's no
[1:29:36] more Redemption because they sto there
[1:29:39] they put a period there and they stop
[1:29:42] there and what they're doing they're
[1:29:44] taking two events and making one out of
[1:29:47] it it's what they're doing that's why
[1:29:50] you know there's people and I you
[1:29:51] probably known people bum people that
[1:29:53] he's off The Mercy Seat all those
[1:29:54] different things you've heard that I
[1:29:56] don't believe he's off The Mercy Seat I
[1:29:57] don't believe he's off The Mercy Seat
[1:29:58] when he gets off The Mercy Seat he's
[1:30:00] come to take the bride home
[1:30:03] right so he says the seventh seal is the
[1:30:06] end of all things he said the thing the
[1:30:09] things written in the seven seven seal
[1:30:11] book sealed up the Plan of Redemption
[1:30:13] from before the foundation of the world
[1:30:14] it every bit ends but we're not there
[1:30:18] yet right now watch Stay With Me the
[1:30:22] seven seal the opening of it can happen
[1:30:26] and it happened in 1963 but the ending
[1:30:29] of it goes right up to the end of the
[1:30:31] Millennium okay so it is end and it is
[1:30:34] the end of the struggling world he says
[1:30:37] is the end of the struggling
[1:30:39] nature that hasn't happen yet it's the
[1:30:41] end of everything if there is the end of
[1:30:43] the trumpets it's the end of the seals
[1:30:44] it's the end of the set Earth it's even
[1:30:46] the End of Time Time runs out so the
[1:30:51] ending of the seven seal is the ending
[1:30:53] of time and then we go over to the
[1:30:56] eighth everybody with me right now watch
[1:30:59] what he says here he said noce is the
[1:31:01] end of the church age he says it's the
[1:31:03] end of the Seven Seals he says it's the
[1:31:06] end of the trumpet the end of the vials
[1:31:08] and even ends the ushering in on the
[1:31:09] millenni that's on the seventh seal so
[1:31:12] the seventh seal lasts over a span of
[1:31:15] years now there's many things in this
[1:31:19] now the seven seal reveals the person of
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ himself
[1:31:24] and the Advent it also reveals the
[1:31:27] ending of time ending of the strling
[1:31:29] nature the aring of the son of David and
[1:31:31] in the Millennium all under the seven
[1:31:34] seal okay everybody still with me now
[1:31:37] watch it's like the rocket into the air
[1:31:40] and the rocket explodes here and it goes
[1:31:43] up then explodes again and puts out five
[1:31:47] stars so the seven seal comes in
[1:31:51] stages okay stages or Revelation it just
[1:31:56] keeps going on and one of those stars
[1:31:59] explode and blows out five stars from it
[1:32:03] so it's happening it didn't just stop in
[1:32:07] 1963 it keeps happening it keeps
[1:32:10] exploding and he said and then one of he
[1:32:13] said one of those Stars explodes blows
[1:32:16] over five stars from it and then one of
[1:32:18] them Stars explodes blows out five stars
[1:32:21] from it so what's happening then it's
[1:32:23] not just it with the initial explosion
[1:32:26] five stars came it just keeps on
[1:32:28] exploding keeps on exploding it's
[1:32:30] exploding here
[1:32:32] tonight okay it just doesn't stop see
[1:32:36] friends the thing is the seven seal has
[1:32:38] been timed over the years it's been
[1:32:40] timed over years revelation after
[1:32:43] revelation after Revelation it keeps on
[1:32:45] veiling itself under the initial
[1:32:48] explosion of the
[1:32:49] word now people say the Seven Seals open
[1:32:53] but they'll watch the initial rocket and
[1:32:56] they
[1:32:57] stop they never go
[1:33:00] on Amen no stay with me cuz I want want
[1:33:03] you to see what what I'm seeing here so
[1:33:06] people they'll stop there but they'll
[1:33:08] never go on to the next
[1:33:10] Revelation they never grow up they never
[1:33:13] mature in perfect love they still in a
[1:33:16] baby form and theyve stopped progressing
[1:33:19] on the revelation of it and people have
[1:33:21] turned their back and and it's still
[1:33:23] unveiling still coming forth so he says
[1:33:25] it's like a fire a rocket into the air
[1:33:28] and The Rock explodes here and it goes
[1:33:30] up and then explodes again it puts out
[1:33:32] five stars and out of those Stars explos
[1:33:34] blows out of five stars from it so it's
[1:33:37] each explosion it gets smaller and
[1:33:39] smaller and small what's happening right
[1:33:41] now God's honing his
[1:33:43] bride honing her down thinning her out
[1:33:48] now watch he said that's what the seven
[1:33:52] seal see just keep keeps on going it
[1:33:55] just ends at the time for the world it
[1:33:56] ends at the time for this it means the
[1:33:58] time for that it ends the time for this
[1:34:00] it ends the time everything just ended
[1:34:03] up in the seventh seal now it was so
[1:34:06] great the seventh seal in the heavens
[1:34:09] that he couldn't say anything about
[1:34:12] it I must have skipped something
[1:34:14] here I must have cut something
[1:34:18] out anyways we'll go on so this what the
[1:34:22] seven seal it just ends are time world
[1:34:25] it ends a time for this it means a time
[1:34:27] for that it's the end of time it's the
[1:34:29] end of time everything just ended up on
[1:34:32] the seventh seal and there's another
[1:34:34] quote here I must have missed that quote
[1:34:36] and he said what the what it is he says
[1:34:39] it brings it the seven seal brings him
[1:34:41] back to Earth again but the thing is
[1:34:43] what we miss in that same quote he says
[1:34:47] it's Revelations 10 is the seventh
[1:34:51] seal Mighty angel brother brandom and
[1:34:57] you it's the unveiling of the mystery of

[1:35:58] love cast us out all
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:02] fear amen we need to get the fear out of
[1:36:05] our
[1:36:06] Lives get the fear out of our life now
[1:36:10] friends the thing is my predestinate
[1:36:12] seed in me is crying out for a glorified
[1:36:15] body it's crying out I want more I want
[1:36:19] more what what is it it's crying out I
[1:36:21] need to get out of here
[1:36:24] amen see the problem is is the identity
[1:36:27] crisis people have an identity crisis in
[1:36:30] the M oh I believe the m i well the
[1:36:32] children of Israel that came out they
[1:36:35] believe Moses was a prophet too they
[1:36:37] believed everything he was
[1:36:39] saying but why didn't they conquer why
[1:36:41] didn't they promise they got scared can
[1:36:43] you imagine Caleb being scared to go
[1:36:45] into the promised land can you imagine
[1:36:47] friends the thing is fear you know
[1:36:50] perfect love cast out all
[1:36:52] fear but kale says it's mine I don't
[1:36:54] care what anybody else says it's
[1:36:56] promised me it's
[1:36:59] mine but here was the children of Israel
[1:37:01] Led Out by a Vindicated Prophet but they
[1:37:05] were too scared to get their promise now
[1:37:08] watch this Exodus 311 and Moses said
[1:37:11] unto God who am I that I should go under
[1:37:13] pharaoh and that should bring forth the
[1:37:15] children of Israel out of Egypt and he
[1:37:17] says certainly I will be with thee and
[1:37:19] this shall be a token unto thee and that
[1:37:21] I have sent thee when thou Hast brought
[1:37:23] forth the people out of Egypt you have
[1:37:26] served God upon this mountain and Moses
[1:37:30] said
[1:37:32] and oh man you know what I mixed up here
[1:37:35] I'll go on the first I just won't read
[1:37:37] the whole thing he he he says he says in
[1:37:41] verse 13 and Moses said unto unto God
[1:37:43] behold I am unto the children of Israel
[1:37:45] and I shall say unto them the god of the
[1:37:47] father has sent me unto you and you
[1:37:49] shall say to me what is his name what
[1:37:52] shall I say unto them and God said unto
[1:37:55] Moses I am that I
[1:37:58] am right and he said thus shall thou say
[1:38:02] unto the children of Israel I am that H
[1:38:04] has sent me so friends the thing is that
[1:38:06] we look at those scriptures and we put
[1:38:08] them back in history put them back there
[1:38:11] but who are
[1:38:12] you I am that I
[1:38:14] am the Living God living in
[1:38:18] you manifesting identifying yourself in
[1:38:22] the word see when Peter came on the
[1:38:24] scene where did he identify himself when
[1:38:27] after after act after the Holy Ghost
[1:38:29] came on the day of Pentecost where did
[1:38:30] he identify himself in Joel
[1:38:33] 2:28 he didn't identify at
[1:38:36] Calvary but he identified himself in the
[1:38:39] word see because remember friends
[1:38:41] brother bam tells us that Christ Mission
[1:38:42] got reveal the Thunders are in the
[1:38:45] types read Ruth read Esther read Rahab
[1:38:49] read Tamar all those ones see it was
[1:38:51] identification of what we have but
[1:38:54] people have an identity crisis in the
[1:38:55] message who am I you are
[1:38:59] him perfect love is you because God is
[1:39:03] love he dwelleth in
[1:39:05] love and if God dwells in me I dwell in
[1:39:09] love that's why friends the thing is
[1:39:11] here here Jesus identified himself in
[1:39:13] Luke 4 brother benam identified himself
[1:39:15] in in in MA in Malachi 4 so understand
[1:39:18] this is that we got to understand about
[1:39:20] ourselves what we're actually
[1:39:22] commissioned to do so God gave Moses a
[1:39:25] commission he got Moses's attention see
[1:39:29] it overwhelmed Moses we know that the I
[1:39:31] am is a present word so and the only
[1:39:34] word can ever be affected to us is the I
[1:39:37] am word can't be a history can't be
[1:39:40] future we can talk about we can debate
[1:39:43] oh there's going to be there going to be
[1:39:45] and I believe that too we can talk about
[1:39:47] Calvary we can talk about all things
[1:39:49] around the through the church ages but
[1:39:51] only way that the word could be
[1:39:52] effective in life now is I here the I am
[1:39:56] present word so God is dealing with a
[1:39:59] group of people here that are
[1:40:02] slaves they know the spiritual uh
[1:40:05] blessings they've got blessed in
[1:40:07] Goan they've been blessed they got the
[1:40:10] plagues they see this that everything
[1:40:11] they're just worshiping God but they
[1:40:14] still have a slave
[1:40:16] mentality they come out they seen the
[1:40:19] first two signs but the first two signs
[1:40:23] never never delivered
[1:40:26] them amen see friends of thing it
[1:40:29] doesn't because what the Satan does he
[1:40:31] begins to explain away the value of the
[1:40:33] word but watch here watch what brother
[1:40:36] Bron says he said Jesus to he said Jesus
[1:40:39] told us how to do it he overcome mean
[1:40:42] overcome means to stand their test
[1:40:44] that's right like an old Saints did like
[1:40:47] Jesus did in the midst of all his
[1:40:49] enemies and stood the test everything he
[1:40:51] tested against stood it in the very face
[1:40:54] of sickness and him being the Messiah he
[1:40:56] healed them in the face of death he said
[1:40:58] he brought it back to life in the face
[1:41:00] of galary his own death he defeated by
[1:41:02] surrendering himself why by the word by
[1:41:05] by the word said by the word said you
[1:41:07] destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in
[1:41:09] three days and the word say so see the
[1:41:12] pre in the presence of death he defeated
[1:41:14] he overcome death in the presence of
[1:41:16] hell he defeated hell and overcome hell
[1:41:19] because why the word was real to
[1:41:21] him was the word to
[1:41:24] us we're trying to get to something here
[1:41:27] right so Moses was
[1:41:30] commissioned but here Moses begins to
[1:41:33] reason with God see friends the thing is
[1:41:36] anything you get from God Satan is going
[1:41:38] to fight
[1:41:40] you he's going to fight you with it
[1:41:42] because the thing is he doesn't want you
[1:41:44] to get the
[1:41:45] promise so Moses goes down to Egypt to
[1:41:49] get the children of Israel and the thing
[1:41:51] is that they're slaves for 400 years and
[1:41:55] they come out with that mentality of
[1:41:57] being a slave they had no real faith of
[1:42:00] their
[1:42:01] own and it's the same thing when brother
[1:42:03] Bram was here people their faith grew as
[1:42:07] he discerned but they never had no faith
[1:42:10] of their own they never could identify
[1:42:13] themselves with the word because they
[1:42:15] still had fear but here God was going to
[1:42:18] bring them out of of Egypt and he was
[1:42:22] going to take him to mountain and the
[1:42:24] thing is they constantly leaned on Moses
[1:42:27] or have the slave mentality they were
[1:42:29] constantly complaining their faith is
[1:42:32] always in the
[1:42:34] prophet they have no identity themselves
[1:42:37] they have an identity crisis and God
[1:42:39] said I'm going to bring you to a
[1:42:40] mountain and in the mountain I'm going
[1:42:42] to give them the true
[1:42:44] message they already seen the first two
[1:42:47] polls that didn't give them their
[1:42:50] identity we can have signs we up wonders
[1:42:53] I'm not against any of this Miracles all
[1:42:56] those different things but those things
[1:42:58] won't deliver you those things won't
[1:43:00] identify
[1:43:01] you we can speak in tongues I'm not
[1:43:03] against any of those things we can have
[1:43:05] all those gifts we can have everything
[1:43:07] but if you cannot see yourself in the
[1:43:10] word and identify yourself in the word
[1:43:13] it don't do you no good you're still an
[1:43:15] identity crisis so here is the age
[1:43:19] friends that we're living in we're
[1:43:21] living in Satan's Eden but guess what
[1:43:24] he's got us afraid of certain things in
[1:43:27] the message like I said got us afraid of
[1:43:29] the Seven Seals and he takes away the
[1:43:32] effectiveness of the message of the hour
[1:43:34] so remember be he says remember before
[1:43:37] the true message come forth Moses
[1:43:40] preached and led them out of an
[1:43:43] Egypt so what was the true
[1:43:46] message they already seen the first two
[1:43:49] polls that wasn't the true message so
[1:43:52] what he preached
[1:43:53] Egypt was just was just for to lead them
[1:43:57] out but it wasn't the true man it didn't
[1:44:00] give them an identification they still
[1:44:02] had all kinds of fear they were fearful
[1:44:04] they they were slave they had they had a
[1:44:06] slave mentality brother Ram goes on and
[1:44:08] says this he said before the true
[1:44:11] message come forth Moses preached LED
[1:44:14] them out of Egypt and there before the
[1:44:16] real Commandments was laid down the
[1:44:18] seals are brought in God come down
[1:44:21] before the people and prove that Moses
[1:44:23] was sent from
[1:44:25] him now brother Ram
[1:44:27] types The Ten Commandments to the Seven
[1:44:31] Seals and the thing is the friends the
[1:44:33] thing is he's trying to show the people
[1:44:35] and here was God trying to show the
[1:44:37] people that you got to open up your
[1:44:39] spiritual Fallopian tubes to receive the
[1:44:42] seed oh you'll never manifest it so
[1:44:45] brother man goes on he say what is
[1:44:47] taking place on the mountain is a true
[1:44:50] message coming forth to the people
[1:44:53] we always thought the true message was
[1:44:55] all three
[1:44:56] polls the first two was just to get
[1:44:59] people's
[1:45:01] attention but only this friends the
[1:45:03] thing is that we are called to go and
[1:45:06] receive the true message now Moses goes
[1:45:09] up in the mountain there's Thunders
[1:45:10] there's Lightnings and everything like
[1:45:12] that there things going on and friends
[1:45:14] is the thing is Moses is not even
[1:45:16] commissioned to take the people over in
[1:45:18] the promised
[1:45:19] land he's only commissioned to give them
[1:45:26] identity okay see he was commissioned to
[1:45:29] go up the mountain but he commissioned
[1:45:31] to only give them identity so Moses
[1:45:33] started on his journey they understood
[1:45:35] who Moses was they had an understanding
[1:45:37] they had a revelation was a prophet of
[1:45:39] God but brother goes on that ought to
[1:45:41] give you comfort see if it was God that
[1:45:44] started the journey then is God going to
[1:45:46] be God that's finishing the
[1:45:49] journey so it's not going to be
[1:45:51] confusing to the believer
[1:45:53] it's not going to be confusion because
[1:45:55] there's so much confusion and it's
[1:45:57] confusion is not around the first 2
[1:45:59] third fourth fifth six six seal it's not
[1:46:02] confusion around there the confusion is
[1:46:04] around the seven
[1:46:06] seal and people get scared they get
[1:46:08] fearful when you started talking about
[1:46:10] because they don't understand the
[1:46:11] Revival the Revival is a Revival of
[1:46:16] understanding we can have all signs and
[1:46:18] wonders we can have all things going on
[1:46:19] all and friends the thing is you can
[1:46:21] have a church Revival but the bride's
[1:46:23] Revival is understanding of who you are
[1:46:26] identifying yourself as you and Christ
[1:46:29] Alone he said he say it's the Holy
[1:46:31] Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive
[1:46:35] those people that's for ordained of God
[1:46:38] to be in the
[1:46:39] rouer it's not for everybody it's only
[1:46:42] for the elect they'll catch it see the
[1:46:46] only ones that will catch it are the
[1:46:47] ones that receive what God has done in
[1:46:49] this day of the Holy Ghost he said that
[1:46:51] is that is if he's a true Eagle he said
[1:46:55] he will understand the message of the
[1:46:56] are if he's a true Eagle now you see
[1:47:00] when Moses went up to get the true
[1:47:03] message what was he bringing down he was
[1:47:06] bringing down Israel's identity he was
[1:47:09] actually making them a citizen of the
[1:47:12] kingdom of God you realize when brother
[1:47:15] Bon went up because there only one man
[1:47:17] called to go up to the mountain came
[1:47:19] back down and what was he doing he was
[1:47:21] giving you your citizenship he was
[1:47:23] actually giving you your passport for
[1:47:26] heaven amen he was actually giving you
[1:47:29] that he was actually he what was he was
[1:47:31] identifying who you
[1:47:33] were see it was like you know brother M
[1:47:35] tells these stories about the eagle in
[1:47:37] the in the chicken barard it was a it
[1:47:40] was an identity crisis for that eagle
[1:47:42] until he heard mother Eagle come over
[1:47:45] and fly over and begin to squawk out oh
[1:47:47] and he begin to look at that I'm
[1:47:49] identified with that I'm identified with
[1:47:51] that because he was in an identity
[1:47:53] crisis he was going around trying to be
[1:47:55] like other
[1:47:56] chickens plucking away and eating this
[1:47:58] food eating he probably hated it cuz he
[1:48:01] was an eagle he wanted meat but when he
[1:48:05] looked up he looked up he said man I I I
[1:48:07] that that's me I I know I I feel it
[1:48:10] that's my identity that's the same thing
[1:48:13] with a message believer because what it
[1:48:14] is is that it gives you an identity with
[1:48:17] the breaking of the seal in your
[1:48:20] life seven seal mystery of your life
[1:48:23] life now friends the thing is we live so
[1:48:25] far bey bey below our
[1:48:28] privileges now brother bam you know he
[1:48:31] has a tent vision and remember the Ten
[1:48:32] Commandments are the type of the seals
[1:48:34] he has a tent Vision in
[1:48:36] 1956 in 1963 he says I didn't realize
[1:48:40] that I fit right in
[1:48:42] this because people are scared of the
[1:48:44] tent
[1:48:47] Vision they're scared of the tent Vision
[1:48:50] that's another thing they get scared of
[1:48:52] but we're building a pattern according
[1:48:54] to the word of God so we're looking to
[1:48:57] actually construct something that God
[1:48:59] has go given and according to the
[1:49:01] pattern of the word so the breaking of
[1:49:03] the SE seven seal brings him to Earth
[1:49:06] and God is God constructed so the seven
[1:49:11] seal for us what it is is the mystery or
[1:49:14] the breaking of the seal in your life
[1:49:15] showing you who you are because
[1:49:18] rapturing faith is not exterior it's
[1:49:20] interior you are the rapture
[1:49:23] Rapture you are that identity you're the
[1:49:25] one that's going in the Rapture it's
[1:49:27] going to be a great event but right now
[1:49:29] friends the thing is is that it's
[1:49:30] something that's actually happening in
[1:49:32] your life right now it's like Enoch it
[1:49:35] he walked with it for 365 years brother
[1:49:38] B says he kissed his kids uh bye kissed
[1:49:41] his wife goodbye went out the door and
[1:49:43] then God took him and friends the thing
[1:49:45] it was time to go it was time for the
[1:49:47] Rapture so understand this is that we we
[1:49:50] we have fellowship with him God's given
[1:49:52] us a place in his uh Kingdom he given us
[1:49:56] identity he's given the seven seal it's
[1:49:58] broken on your life it shows you who you
[1:50:01] are but listen to me friends when those
[1:50:04] when those Jews came out of Egypt and
[1:50:08] they had that state
[1:50:09] mentality and remember friends Aaron was
[1:50:12] there in the valley and he begin to make
[1:50:16] a golden calf gold is deity take all
[1:50:19] kinds of quotes together put it back
[1:50:21] where does it take you if you man made
[1:50:23] quotes takes you right back to
[1:50:26] Egypt amen takes right back to the world
[1:50:30] but I understand this friends here was a
[1:50:33] man that was called of God on the
[1:50:36] mountain Aaron will be your high priest
[1:50:39] so God didn't wait for Aaron to get
[1:50:41] right before he called him God doesn't
[1:50:43] wait for you to get right before he
[1:50:45] calls
[1:50:46] you that's the mercy and grace of God
[1:50:49] see because the thing is that when he
[1:50:51] when when we talk about you know
[1:50:53] Revelations 5 it shows the worshipper
[1:50:56] because he has made his priests and
[1:50:58] Kings under God now amen now not in the
[1:51:03] future right now that's why the real
[1:51:05] true worshiper comes from the hearts of
[1:51:07] the people and the thing is is brought
[1:51:09] by a revelation and the people say I
[1:51:11] believe this message I believe this
[1:51:12] place and they manifest it because it's
[1:51:15] something that's identified in their
[1:51:17] life it's something that's in them
[1:51:19] that's why the prophet of God when he
[1:51:20] looked at this he sees what happening
[1:51:23] he's seen you before you seen yourself
[1:51:26] he's seen there's going to be a bride
[1:51:28] he's seen that you're going to be
[1:51:29] walking this walk he seen that you're
[1:51:31] going to be understanding of the
[1:51:32] revealing word he's going to understand
[1:51:34] what it's all talk what it's all about
[1:51:37] because we look through the scriptures
[1:51:39] we look through we look what what what's
[1:51:41] wrote about this person what's wrote
[1:51:42] about that person but now I'm
[1:51:44] identifying what's wrote about me and
[1:51:46] who I am so brother B say a question and
[1:51:49] answer he say now we find out that the
[1:51:51] corruption see that hits the seventh
[1:51:53] Church age but the seventh seal doesn't
[1:51:56] reveal anything that what's what's
[1:51:58] happened to it he said because the end
[1:52:00] of the church AG has come to a prophetic
[1:52:02] gift to reveal these things are you
[1:52:04] following it because there's so much
[1:52:07] error around this stuff right so we
[1:52:09] preach from an open book do we not now
[1:52:12] watch this is the quote I'm I was
[1:52:13] looking for he said look I want to say
[1:52:16] one more thing closely now don't miss
[1:52:20] this so he's saying close put an ear to
[1:52:23] it look at he said how striking from the
[1:52:26] seven angels angels messenger of the
[1:52:29] seven seal message in Revelations 10 was
[1:52:32] the seventh
[1:52:35] seal that's what he says I didn't say
[1:52:39] that that's his words so are you in the
[1:52:42] revelations 10 are you identified there
[1:52:46] we can it's easy to identify brother
[1:52:48] Braham it's easy to identify the mighty
[1:52:50] Angel but you're also identified with it
[1:52:53] he said there is a prophet to appear
[1:52:55] before the Gentiles to call the people
[1:52:57] back to the original Pentecostal
[1:53:01] doctor see it took the opening of The
[1:53:04] Seven seal the unveiling of you to show
[1:53:07] you who you actually are now the problem
[1:53:10] is that people don't dig far enough and
[1:53:13] they don't recognize their day in their
[1:53:16] message they read the books they listen
[1:53:17] to tastes I'm I'm I'm I'm showing you
[1:53:20] your citizenship showing you your
[1:53:21] identity C because Aaron said I he he
[1:53:24] said I am that I am because remember
[1:53:26] Moses told him just do what I say to do
[1:53:29] Aaron didn't catch it at
[1:53:30] first see the thing is we didn't catch
[1:53:33] things at first I'm just being honest
[1:53:36] I've been serving the lord for 40 years
[1:53:38] now I didn't catch it at first but as I
[1:53:41] walk in this walk and keep walking and
[1:53:45] walk it keeps opening up for
[1:53:47] me that's the grace of God to me that's
[1:53:51] him showing me
[1:53:53] and you got to be the same way it's got
[1:53:54] to be to a place where God is opening up
[1:53:57] for you it's him that's doing because we
[1:53:59] know who Jesus is we know who brother
[1:54:02] Brandon was we know the prophet we know
[1:54:04] those things but as he identifies you
[1:54:07] and shows you who you are I love him
[1:54:09] more I'm serving him greater than I've
[1:54:11] ever served him why because he's
[1:54:13] identified me as his own that's why the
[1:54:17] Revelation makes go the center of my of
[1:54:19] God's thoughts that I understand that
[1:54:21] it's not a bunch you know me knowing
[1:54:24] things it's me understanding things
[1:54:26] about myself that actually protrudes
[1:54:29] from me you remember friends Mary said
[1:54:31] according to your
[1:54:33] word right she identified
[1:54:37] herself I'm the one I'm the one sitting
[1:54:40] in sitting in the synagogue and the
[1:54:43] priest read that a virgin shall conceive
[1:54:45] all a sudden something HS to her she
[1:54:47] identified herself there was an identity
[1:54:50] in the word for her just like us there
[1:54:52] identity in the word because we have
[1:54:54] actually accepted what God has actually
[1:54:56] done for us so he says this now the
[1:54:58] little Eagle
[1:54:59] probably he said
[1:55:04] the oh he oh sorry I skipped something
[1:55:07] here that's what I
[1:55:08] did but he that understandeth he that
[1:55:11] knoweth this his place in this
[1:55:14] hour
[1:55:16] now I don't know what time I got up here
[1:55:19] you guys s a little bit of time for
[1:55:21] me now now the bridegroom the bride is
[1:55:23] living in the end time right you realize
[1:55:26] you're identified in this Bible the
[1:55:29] Bible
[1:55:30] bridegroom in the bride living in the
[1:55:32] end time Bible
[1:55:35] okay right God thought a lot of you and
[1:55:40] I always say it's like the
[1:55:41] tadpole a tadpole swimming around it
[1:55:44] just eats eats eats and all of a sudden
[1:55:46] the leg pops out leg pops out the legs
[1:55:48] on the back and they go from one
[1:55:50] dimension the water onto the land
[1:55:53] you just keep on feeding feeding feeding
[1:55:55] all of a sudden one day you're going to
[1:55:56] be in a glorified body from one
[1:55:58] dimension to the next Dimension but
[1:56:00] understand that Christ is the mystery of
[1:56:02] God revealed who's the Christ we
[1:56:06] are now without explaining I'm going to
[1:56:09] say something here and it takes maybe if
[1:56:12] you don't understand it right now
[1:56:14] hopefully the Lord willing you will
[1:56:15] understand because your Bible says that
[1:56:18] that God made Jesus both Lord and Christ
[1:56:24] right got that Christ is the anal word
[1:56:28] Lord
[1:56:30] Jesus God made
[1:56:33] you both Lord and
[1:56:36] Christ Lord of lords he's the Lord Lord
[1:56:40] You're the anointed word so if I said
[1:56:43] Lord Jonathan
[1:56:45] Christ no
[1:56:47] friend like I'm telling you you need to
[1:56:50] know who you are
[1:56:53] you understand many saviors plural come
[1:56:57] out of Mount
[1:56:59] Zion right Zion's always the bride
[1:57:02] that's what your Bible says right so
[1:57:05] friends we're in the Harvest moment
[1:57:07] we're in the Harvest time do you realize
[1:57:09] every promise of God is built on adverse
[1:57:13] conditions so you're going to try to get
[1:57:16] this promise but it's going to be built
[1:57:17] on adverse conditions you'll never be
[1:57:20] trouble-free you'll always have trouble
[1:57:22] Tri you always have tribulation in your
[1:57:24] life you go through things but guess
[1:57:27] what the seed in me is thanking him for
[1:57:30] taking me out of my
[1:57:33] sin amen see I'm want to be saved from
[1:57:38] myself I want to be saved from this
[1:57:41] flesh so you're created to actually
[1:57:43] worship God now remember friends I'm
[1:57:46] going to I'm going to go into something
[1:57:48] here right away I'm only be a few
[1:57:49] minutes the beginning something said
[1:57:51] some preacher said here I'm at the
[1:57:53] beginning of winding down the beginning
[1:57:56] of it but it's winding down was another
[1:57:58] half hour I'm not going to place another
[1:58:00] half hour don't
[1:58:02] worry now the Book of Esther they always
[1:58:05] wondered about the Book of Esther they
[1:58:06] wondered why it was put in the way it
[1:58:08] was but the Book of Esther was in
[1:58:10] between Nehemiah and it was in job
[1:58:13] remember Nehemiah brought the word back
[1:58:15] to jerus job was on the as sheep he the
[1:58:19] trials the tribulation and here Esther
[1:58:21] comes in between between so Neah Israel
[1:58:24] coming back to restore job represented
[1:58:27] the resurrection so Esther takes her
[1:58:30] place now brother bam says there's it's
[1:58:34] clo a church spirit and a bride Spirit
[1:58:37] are very
[1:58:38] close so we don't want to take on our
[1:58:41] church Spirit we want to take on the
[1:58:43] bride spirit it's nice to come to church
[1:58:46] and you feel the presence of God and
[1:58:48] feel the worship and all those different
[1:58:50] things but friends I want to go farther
[1:58:52] with this I want to go farther with just
[1:58:55] being having a church Spirit where we
[1:58:57] come to church and we wor and it's great
[1:58:59] it's wonderful get around Believers we
[1:59:01] should do those things but I want to go
[1:59:03] farther than that so in Psalms 271 it
[1:59:06] says a Psalm of David the Lord is my
[1:59:09] slight and we know this is the r the
[1:59:11] Rapture uh Rapture scriptures G uh
[1:59:14] brother bam uses he say the psalm of
[1:59:16] David the Lord is my light and my
[1:59:18] salvation Whom Shall I Fear Whom Shall I
[1:59:21] Fear remember
[1:59:23] friends perfect love cast out all fear
[1:59:27] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:59:30] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:59:33] afraid now remember friends there's
[1:59:36] going to be a people that are actually
[1:59:38] going to move into these
[1:59:41] scriptures just like Jesus moved into
[1:59:43] Isaiah 53 there's going to be a people
[1:59:46] that are actually going to move into the
[1:59:48] scriptures and they'll be RT raptured so
[1:59:51] brother bam didn't use 2 uh Corinthians
[1:59:53] CH 4:1 16 he didn't use 1 Corinthians 15
[1:59:56] he uses Psalm and he's showing the
[1:59:59] background of the Rapture that's and the
[2:00:01] thing is what is the background it's
[2:00:03] something to give you would outlay
[2:00:05] something that's behind it so the psalm
[2:00:07] was chosen for the background of the
[2:00:09] Rapture and so there will be a people
[2:00:12] there will be a people that will
[2:00:13] actually walk into this word I'm one of
[2:00:17] them I'm identified with this I believe
[2:00:20] friends there's a people that are come
[2:00:22] into a place they don't fear they allow
[2:00:24] the word to have prance in their life
[2:00:26] they won't fear man they won't fear the
[2:00:28] devil they won't fear
[2:00:30] trials I believe there's people they
[2:00:32] don't fear anything but they only fear
[2:00:34] God they give God reverence because in
[2:00:37] verse two it says and when the wicked
[2:00:39] even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me
[2:00:41] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[2:00:43] fell that's a promise for us that's what
[2:00:47] it's shown who we
[2:00:48] are amen now watch
[2:00:53] I said all these things just to say
[2:00:55] this for God ha not given us the spirit
[2:01:00] of fear but of power and of love and of
[2:01:05] sound
[2:01:07] mind now he didn't he didn't say holy
[2:01:10] ghost in this he said power and love and
[2:01:13] of the sound mind so we're living in a
[2:01:16] time where people are absolutely insane
[2:01:18] in their mind they call good evil and
[2:01:22] evil good amen we all agree with that we
[2:01:24] all see that see that because the they
[2:01:27] don't seeing mind is totally
[2:01:29] unstable and I don't want that mind but
[2:01:33] theen spirit is here trying to grab hold
[2:01:36] of your mind trying to make you crazy
[2:01:39] but here I want to remind you this the
[2:01:41] book of second Timothy was the last book
[2:01:44] that Paul actually wrote before they cut
[2:01:46] his head
[2:01:48] off he's sitting in prison the prison
[2:01:52] was called maritine prison it was a
[2:01:55] prison in Rome at the time and that
[2:01:58] prison was like a hole in the ground
[2:02:01] there's no light there's nothing nothing
[2:02:05] spectacular it's not like our Resort
[2:02:06] prisons in
[2:02:08] Canada but a hole in the ground and they
[2:02:11] pour food down there and there's a
[2:02:13] stream running through the prison to
[2:02:17] take away the
[2:02:18] waste and here's Paul writing this down
[2:02:21] and he's in this
[2:02:24] condition power love sound
[2:02:29] mind
[2:02:32] huh see what it is
[2:02:35] Friends the stench didn't bother him the
[2:02:39] stink didn't bother him in that sense
[2:02:41] fleshly it might might have done but he
[2:02:44] said God has given has not given us the
[2:02:46] spirit of
[2:02:47] fear now I don't want the spirit of fear
[2:02:51] but the reason why we don't progress
[2:02:52] like brother B say because we have
[2:02:55] fear and we got to get rid of that fear
[2:02:57] we got to push that fear out and allow
[2:02:59] perfect love to come in see because the
[2:03:02] thing is is that this when he was
[2:03:04] writing this he didn't write it in some
[2:03:06] pastor's office in a comfort he wrote it
[2:03:10] in prison a place of Filth a place of
[2:03:14] human waste see it was a dungeon and
[2:03:17] here he is pening this down and Paul
[2:03:19] knew what what was going to happen to
[2:03:21] him because he's a Roman citizen they
[2:03:23] couldn't crucify him as a Roman citizen
[2:03:26] they the only thing they could do was
[2:03:27] behead him and they did behead him so he
[2:03:29] knew what was going to happen so the
[2:03:30] thing is he knew these things and he was
[2:03:32] this was written about a month before
[2:03:34] his
[2:03:35] death Now understand this he's talking
[2:03:39] to us and telling us God has given us
[2:03:43] power he's given us love and he's giv us
[2:03:46] a sound mind and when Timothy re
[2:03:49] received these letters and begin to tell
[2:03:51] the church to and he's telling these
[2:03:53] things and and Timothy's looking at this
[2:03:55] he said God's given us the spirit of has
[2:03:57] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[2:03:58] power and of love and of some mind and
[2:04:01] here's Paul I'm not nervous I'm not
[2:04:04] scared not tore up my soul's ready my
[2:04:09] thoughts are
[2:04:11] sound that's where he was we lose a job
[2:04:15] or we do something happens to us just
[2:04:17] little things throws us right off but
[2:04:19] here's a man sitting in a prison
[2:04:22] and he's writing these things down and
[2:04:24] thing you know and the stink and and the
[2:04:28] stench of the prison system of that day
[2:04:31] would have been
[2:04:32] overwhelming but here he is I'm ready
[2:04:35] I'm not
[2:04:37] worried now to get to this place now let
[2:04:39] me just say it this way you know in the
[2:04:41] Old Testament when the law came down
[2:04:43] from Mount
[2:04:45] SAR uh uh Sena he said the
[2:04:48] dispensational anointing was come with a
[2:04:51] fear
[2:04:52] the law came with a fear it frightened
[2:04:54] the people do Thou shalt Thou shalt Thou
[2:04:57] shalt Thou shalt I said I said Mount Si
[2:05:00] I should say thou shalt Thou shalt Thou
[2:05:02] shalt it frightened the people but it
[2:05:04] did not reproduce no life it just sets
[2:05:09] the fear in the
[2:05:11] people I don't want to preach a gospel
[2:05:13] of fear I don't want to preach the
[2:05:16] gospel of of of you better not do this
[2:05:18] you better not do this but I want to
[2:05:20] understand the distance ation that God
[2:05:23] has actually given us the Covenant that
[2:05:25] he gave us he never gave us the Covenant
[2:05:27] of fear I want you to understand this
[2:05:30] see people say you're going to preach
[2:05:31] you preach this loose and we you live if
[2:05:34] you that your desire do it that's not my
[2:05:37] desire I'm born again I don't have a
[2:05:40] desire to drink I don't have a desire to
[2:05:42] go to danc I don't have a desire to do
[2:05:43] any of this see what has been given to
[2:05:46] us as a dispensation of Love he'll love
[2:05:49] you into not sinning he'll love you into
[2:05:53] living rights he don't scare me he gives
[2:05:57] me love where I don't want to do those
[2:05:59] things wrong he wants me to be though he
[2:06:02] wants to love me into it but Paul's
[2:06:04] saying here he said I has given us he
[2:06:06] has not given us a spirit of fear but a
[2:06:08] power and love in a sound
[2:06:11] mind power dunamis
[2:06:14] Dynamite so amazing to me is a god with
[2:06:17] couple dynamite and love together a
[2:06:20] power in you
[2:06:22] now I'm talking about identity crisis
[2:06:25] can you identify yourself in order to
[2:06:27] have perfect love you got to be identify
[2:06:30] yourself see because God hasn't given us
[2:06:32] something that gives us fear fear fear
[2:06:35] will tell you you're going to miss the
[2:06:36] match miss the Rapture I'm not going to
[2:06:39] miss the
[2:06:41] Rapture you're not brother here no I'm
[2:06:44] not going to let fear grab a hold me
[2:06:46] fear I put a sign up no trespassing to
[2:06:49] fear amen I won't allow it in see
[2:06:53] friends the thing is I'm not going to
[2:06:54] come to a place where I'm going to let
[2:06:56] the devil have his way in my life I'm
[2:06:58] not going to
[2:07:01] fear now we live in a good country here
[2:07:04] right now every one of us are going to
[2:07:06] go home tonight and if we're hungry we
[2:07:08] can go in the fridge pull out some food
[2:07:10] and eat right just like that imagine
[2:07:14] though if you didn't have that imagine
[2:07:17] if your bills are can't get paid because
[2:07:18] you have no job imagine how would you
[2:07:21] you feel would you have the same thing
[2:07:23] as Paul has sitting in prison the love
[2:07:27] the power and a sound mind thanking God
[2:07:31] that what he's given you in this day and
[2:07:33] age you thank God for all his blessings
[2:07:36] but the thing is that we're going to be
[2:07:38] an overcomer in this age see because
[2:07:40] what it is friends when life gets too
[2:07:42] easy for us we begin to
[2:07:46] backslide we come into a backing
[2:07:49] condition for God is giving us a spirit
[2:07:52] of fear but a not giving us spirit of
[2:07:54] fear but a power love and sound mind
[2:07:57] that word sound mind is an admonishing
[2:07:59] or calling soundness a mind to
[2:08:01] moderation and
[2:08:03] self-control
[2:08:05] self-control so I have to discipline my
[2:08:08] mind I have to discipline this devil get
[2:08:11] out of here devil get away from me devil
[2:08:13] get get out of here it's not somebody
[2:08:16] saying don't do this don't do that but
[2:08:18] my mind is going to correlate
[2:08:21] with the spirit of
[2:08:23] God it's not dos and don'ts friends I'm
[2:08:26] just telling you it's not dos and don'ts
[2:08:27] it's not a legalist message it's a love
[2:08:32] message I know we should raise our kids
[2:08:35] properly I'm don't get me wrong my wife
[2:08:38] knows me what I preach all the time
[2:08:40] don't get me wrong but understand this
[2:08:42] if it's not the love of God we miss the
[2:08:46] message we've actually missed it if we
[2:08:49] see that's what the Pharisees missed
[2:08:51] when Jesus came they missed the love
[2:08:54] they could do all the dos and don'ts but
[2:08:55] they missed the love message and that's
[2:08:58] what I'm trying to tell you see you're
[2:09:00] you're going to correlate your mind's
[2:09:01] going to correlate with the spirit of
[2:09:04] God now watch I'm going to I'm closing
[2:09:06] down don't worry closing down I'm really
[2:09:09] closing down I'm not going to lie to you
[2:09:11] for as many as led by the spirit of God
[2:09:14] they are the sons of God for we have not
[2:09:17] received the the spirit of bondage again
[2:09:20] to fear
[2:09:22] so that word Spirit AB bondage is a
[2:09:25] slave now remember friends many people
[2:09:29] go by a slave mentality when they serve
[2:09:32] God you realize scared Christians don't
[2:09:34] be aren't good
[2:09:37] Christians and now friends if you have
[2:09:39] the love of God in your heart you'll do
[2:09:42] what God wants you to do you'll dress
[2:09:45] right act right say things right you
[2:09:49] won't have uh corruption l language
[2:09:52] you'll have language that is pleasing to
[2:09:54] God for you've not received the spirit
[2:09:56] of bondage so a slave is under constant
[2:09:58] fear see remember friends when they were
[2:10:01] slave when Paul wrote this they could
[2:10:03] get beat they could get sold they could
[2:10:05] be separated beat down starve him all
[2:10:08] those different things and friends the
[2:10:10] thing is they can do all these Ty of
[2:10:11] things and many Christians serve god
[2:10:13] with a slave fear but I'm
[2:10:17] free I'm free from my bondage so you're
[2:10:21] free to do what he what he wants me to
[2:10:24] do see sin friends people say well I'm
[2:10:27] going to take you know oh I going to run
[2:10:30] around friends it's not about running
[2:10:32] around I'm made free from
[2:10:35] sin that's why the people they pull away
[2:10:38] from the message because they say
[2:10:39] they're free they say they're free what
[2:10:42] are they free from there's only one
[2:10:44] place to go is back to
[2:10:46] Sodom and just a bunch of perversion out
[2:10:48] there people that you know you know
[2:10:50] saying I'm run away from the mess
[2:10:52] running away from and turning their back
[2:10:53] of the M brother a false prop where are
[2:10:56] they running from they're running right
[2:10:58] back into Sodom bunch of perversion
[2:11:01] bunch of rotten type of thinking going
[2:11:04] on but I'm talking about a love
[2:11:06] relationship because I'm under jesus'
[2:11:08] atonement what Jesus did for me he loves
[2:11:11] me he takes care of me I'm his property
[2:11:14] he owns
[2:11:16] me amen see understand this I'm free I'm
[2:11:21] free from all this things of the world
[2:11:23] I'm only waiting for my body I want my
[2:11:26] body changed I glorified my seat in me
[2:11:30] is crying out for a glorified
[2:11:33] body for you have not received the
[2:11:35] spirit of barnish again to fear but you
[2:11:38] have received the spirit of
[2:11:41] adoption you know
[2:11:43] friends serving God is a greatest thing
[2:11:45] you can ever
[2:11:47] do come to church and be able to hear
[2:11:49] the word of God man there's nothing like
[2:11:52] it you know the the you know I'm not
[2:11:54] against anything people do things in the
[2:11:56] world that's fine they you know I'm
[2:11:57] talking I I understand people at
[2:12:00] different age you can't put a 62y old
[2:12:01] head on a 18year old body I understand
[2:12:05] brother BR says those things I
[2:12:07] understand kids they're full of energy
[2:12:08] and active and stuff like that I
[2:12:10] understand all that but I want to say is
[2:12:13] that my mind is getting closer and
[2:12:17] focusing on the right
[2:12:19] things it's not focus focusing on the
[2:12:21] things of the
[2:12:22] world because the world has a lot of
[2:12:25] things going
[2:12:26] on I don't want to get into too much
[2:12:29] here but understand this whereby we cry
[2:12:33] Abba Father that word ABA actually means
[2:12:37] father what was God trying to get across
[2:12:39] to
[2:12:40] us that you are mine you don't need to
[2:12:43] fear you don't need to be scared just
[2:12:46] open yourself up and I will feel that
[2:12:49] and push that fear out of your life
[2:12:53] amen that's what he's trying to say to
[2:12:55] us and what it is friends because
[2:12:58] remember a slave back then they didn't
[2:13:01] have shoes that's how you could tell a
[2:13:03] slave back then they wouldn't have shoes
[2:13:06] and they'd have a band either around
[2:13:08] their arm or they have a band around
[2:13:09] their neck showing that they're a
[2:13:10] slave and when the prodal son came back
[2:13:13] home one of the first things that the
[2:13:16] father said get my shoes and get my robe
[2:13:19] out of my closet
[2:13:22] what is it friends he don't wants to
[2:13:24] make sure you're not slave me me
[2:13:27] mentality you are born again son and
[2:13:30] daughter of God you have all authority

[2:20:06] God praise
[2:20:09] God praise
[2:20:14] God Amen did you enjoy that
[2:20:17] tonight I could preach another hour and
[2:20:20] a half
[2:20:22] just trying to fill in the gaps that I
[2:20:24] know he left out cuz he knew he didn't
[2:20:25] have enough time to do it but you know
[2:20:28] he was talking about those
[2:20:31] seals and you see every time those seals
[2:20:34] came those first four seals brother BR
[2:20:36] would say remember there was anointing
[2:20:38] to meet the challenge as the enemy came
[2:20:41] up the spirit of God raised up an
[2:20:43] anointing to perfectly match and in the
[2:20:46] first one it was a lion and it was the
[2:20:48] Bold powerful word in its pure but then
[2:20:51] it went into an ox age and then he
[2:20:53] raised up a man in Martin Luther and he
[2:20:55] he he brought the cunningness and the
[2:20:57] ability of a man to to take it and turn
[2:20:59] it back on on what Satan was trying to
[2:21:01] cram down our throats but in the last
[2:21:03] stage there's a different anointing and
[2:21:05] it takes us not just back to the
[2:21:07] original word it takes us back to the
[2:21:09] original original word back before
[2:21:12] anything was there into eternity itself
[2:21:15] before we ever existed in anything other
[2:21:17] than his thoughts and his mind and it
[2:21:19] brings us back and it shows us who we
[2:21:21] are amen it shows us that he's got
[2:21:25] something for us to be doing here and
[2:21:28] when you catch the anointing you're
[2:21:30] under you cannot do anything else but
[2:21:33] what that anointing is causing you to do
[2:21:35] those in the days of the Dark Ages they
[2:21:38] walked willingly because the anointing
[2:21:41] could not let them do anything else they
[2:21:43] were so surrendered they were so in tune
[2:21:45] with that anointing that they walked up
[2:21:47] mothers saw their children ripped apart
[2:21:50] and fed to the lines and nothing could
[2:21:52] hold them back because there was an
[2:21:54] anointing there that they had caught
[2:21:55] hold of they had caught the word for
[2:21:58] their day and the anointing that came
[2:21:59] with it produced that very word
[2:22:02] amen the response of God is an anointing
[2:22:05] to make the word live and that's what
[2:22:09] we're trying to catch today I love how
[2:22:11] he said every promise of God is built on
[2:22:13] adverse conditions I noticed none of us
[2:22:16] said praise the
[2:22:18] Lord but we're in the darkest of times
[2:22:20] yeah exactly and when it seems like
[2:22:23] nothing is going right yet he is calling
[2:22:25] a bride out of it and not a bedraggled
[2:22:29] not a beat down bride yeah this is a
[2:22:32] bride that has Victory amen they shall
[2:22:35] know their God and they shall do
[2:22:37] exploits what is it she has surrendered
[2:22:40] to the anointing of the age which is a
[2:22:42] prophetic anointing that takes her all
[2:22:44] the way back to where she came from in
[2:22:46] the very beginning
[2:22:48] amen he read in Romans eight he says as
[2:22:52] many as are led by the spirit of God
[2:22:54] they are the sons of God but he said ye
[2:22:55] have not received the spirit of bondage
[2:22:58] again you know when he read that I was
[2:23:00] reminded of that scripture where Paul
[2:23:02] says you did run well what did hinder
[2:23:05] thee you were running so well what held
[2:23:08] you up that idea of a of a speedboat
[2:23:11] with a a 440 cubic inch motor in it
[2:23:15] running around and around in a harbor
[2:23:18] getting nowhere quickly yeah what's held
[2:23:21] us back Church yeah what's held us back
[2:23:24] in our lives
[2:23:26] fear fear to let go of the shore isn't
[2:23:29] that what brother brandom said you want
[2:23:31] to stay close you want to stay tight you
[2:23:34] want to hold to what you had and not
[2:23:37] move into what God has for you he is the
[2:23:39] I am he is the everpresent he was there
[2:23:43] yesterday he's going to be there
[2:23:44] tomorrow but where is he today he's
[2:23:46] identified with the I am bride the one
[2:23:49] that knows that she is with him and he
[2:23:51] is with her
[2:23:52] amen he says you've received the spirit
[2:23:55] of adoption because that's the anointing
[2:23:58] of this age is to take you into full
[2:24:01] spiritual
[2:24:03] maturity it's where you and Christ are
[2:24:06] one amen there is no difference he says
[2:24:09] he is she and she is he exactly right it
[2:24:11] is the unity of the bride and the
[2:24:13] bridegroom in this age the spirit of
[2:24:15] this age is to bring us into a body
[2:24:18] change which is the literal joining of
[2:24:20] the bridegroom with the bride and we get
[2:24:22] to spend eternity with him amen I ask
[2:24:26] you what will hold you back tonight what
[2:24:28] will hold you
[2:24:31] back what's been burdening
[2:24:34] you Jesus what's the fear that Twigs in
[2:24:38] that little corner of your
[2:24:41] heart and says not for me it's for
[2:24:44] somebody
[2:24:46] else we have not received a spirit of
[2:24:49] bondage
[2:24:50] again to
[2:24:54] fear what's bound
[2:24:57] you whether Jerry and I were talking in
[2:25:00] there he had a sister come up we heard
[2:25:02] our little testimony of Mary Beth he had
[2:25:04] a sister come up in his church and he
[2:25:06] was preaching on the authority of the
[2:25:09] word that was riddled with cancer wasn't
[2:25:12] it in her throat no sinuses she clogged
[2:25:15] up her lungs and everything had to have
[2:25:17] these breathing apparatuses and
[2:25:19] everything and she stood on the word and
[2:25:21] she was instantly
[2:25:24] healed of a debilitating problem in her
[2:25:28] life we've heard a message of Freedom
[2:25:35] tonight you can go free if you want to
[2:25:39] remember that slave that refused what
[2:25:40] happened they took him to the temple and
[2:25:43] they bored a hole in his ear and he
[2:25:45] could never be
[2:25:46] free but the bride has a Grace that's
[2:25:49] over her
[2:25:50] amen we overcome by the blood of the
[2:25:52] lamb and the word of Our Testimony that
[2:25:54] his word is true and his grace just
[2:25:56] keeps coming and coming and coming and
[2:26:00] coming until what we finally lay hold of
[2:26:02] it and say that's for me that's my word
[2:26:05] that's my
[2:26:06] promise that's my age that's my message
[2:26:10] that's my freedom that he's talking
[2:26:12] about there and she lays hold of it and
[2:26:15] he sets her free as we read he who the
[2:26:17] sun sets free is free indeed it's a
[2:26:19] finished work
[2:26:21] amen let's sing that
