there was one but uh we're thankful we've got a building we can come into and solid and quiet and you don't even know there's a storm going on outside amen so we're thankful for that amen good to see sister Katrina here tonight as well amen God bless you amen John chap 14 and verse 16 this is Jesus speaking now to the disciples he says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening We are continuing our series we've been preaching on the Holy Ghost amen called the token life and I want to start a another thought this evening on the spirit of Truth and we're going to spend a couple services on this because there's a lot to it amen but I want to kind of lead talk about what led us up to John chapter 14 and Beyond this morning or this evening just as we dwell on this thought of of the spirit of Truth and if we look in John 12 and I I'll just summarize it for us this evening for the sake of time but in John 12 we see Mary of Bethany that's the sister of Lazarus the man who was raised from the dead remember Jesus went up to the where he was buried and it was 4 days the body had already started to decompose and he went and he stood in front and he said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus walked out from the grave his body had already been into corruption and yet when he spoke those words everything went back to the way it was and he walked out completely healed from Death if we could put it that way amen but he Mary comes in and Jesus is sitting there and he's eating and nobody's washed his feet and they put them aside in these different things and she comes in and remember she pours the spikenard from that that alabaster box and it was a it was a fragrance that was very very expensive and we know that it was symbolic CU it was uh uh It Was preparing him for his burial amen and Mary was literally stepping into the scripture when she did that and it was it was uh related to that Prophecy of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God and yet there was somebody there that said she shouldn't have done that she should have taken that and she should have taken the money she spent and she could have should have given it to the poor and we know who that was and it was Judas who was the the one that would betray Jesus and the scripture said he said that not because he wanted the money for the poor it says he said that because he was a thief see he put a religious spin on his response he tried to elevate him above what she was and what she was doing but Mary was supernaturally led to do what she did there amen she wasn't LED of her own Des desire or her own need for recognition or anything but she went there and she poured it over his feet and then she washed his feet with it and then she wiped it with her own hair from behind she didn't even want him to see her but she went behind him and wiped his feet with with her hair amen she didn't want anything for herself and yet Judas tried to put down the sacrifice that she had made because he wanted what she had given for himself let me tell you when you do something for God it's between you and God it's between between you and God and so often what we find is people like Judas that'll put down what you're doing for God because they want it for something else of their own of their own desires and they all way of doing it but whatever you take up and give to God that's between you and him whatever you lay down for him that's between you and him whatever it might be whatever Ministry you might have whatever gift you might give of yourself whatever it might be that's between you and God and as long as it's not off the word it's not of my business it's none of your business if you're not the one doing it amen it's between awesome between God and you notice with Mary I looked it up they said that this would have cost her about a Year's wages typical person in Canada today makes about $65,000 a year can you imagine spending $65,000 to anoint the Master's feet now you can see why Judas made have had might have had something to talk about 65,000 and you poured $65,000 over the Master's feet you know people will look at what we have and what we do with it I've dealt with people and some people approach it with Thanksgiving and some people approach it with incredulity in incred incredulous they're incredulous I speak good words some people have talked to me and they said John you could do so much more in the world you could be in business you could be in management you could be running a company you could be doing so much more and they don't understand why you give it up I've got co-workers that say you shouldn't have been you shouldn't have come and done what you're doing now you should have stayed where you were you make so much more money you go so much further and then you know what I had a I had somebody come to me and said thank you somebody I work with a client in fact and they said thank you because I know what you could be doing and you chose to do what you're doing to help other people see you can look at it two different ways but my sacrifice I needed a job this is My Sacrifice this is my Ministry this is what matters more to me what I do in my my my professional life if we want to put that way it matters nothing to me at this point literally matters nothing to me I just needed a job but I understand also that I could have done it differently perhaps if the Lord would have opened the door amen but we look at those things and people can say you have so much intelligence you have great looks you have great Charisma you have a I'm not talking about me I'm talking clearly I'm not talking about me I have good words I can't even say incred incredulous incredulity there we go incredulity I can't even say that but people can look at you and whether you have a a gift or a skill or or your athletic or whatever it might be they can say you can go so far with that and yet so many times what do we do we lay it down because it's a sacrifice to our Lord and savior amen or if we do pick it up it's because he picks us up and he'll use it and he'll use it for something of his own good amen but people like Judas will stand on the side L and say you go too far you cannot go too far for somebody who gave his life for you that laid down everything he had he came from the portals of Glory laid down everything and took our place so we could take his place amen there's nothing that we could do that would be too much but you continue on in John 12 and Jesus is talking with the disciples and and a voice comes out of heaven and it identifies him and says I'm going to glorify you and some heard it as Thunder some heard it as a voice and Jesus says that voice wasn't for me it was for you well what happened here was for you and then he tells him he's going to die soon and then he says these words and we're speaking tonight on the spirit of Truth he says then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goes while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them the last word he said to the crowd was stay with the light but I want you to jump back previously in in John chapter 8 because Jesus had identified the light he said walk while you have the light and in John 8 he said then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of light Jesus is saying stay with me whatever you do stay with me whether you understand it whether you don't understand it whether you can see what what's coming whether you you're worried about what's coming it doesn't matter he's saying stay with me no matter what I do no matter what I say stay with me cuz I'm the only light you're going to get I'm the only light you're going to have amen and he's saying if you stay with me and listen to me and receive what I say and receive who I am you'll become children of light you'll have the light of life in you as well why because if they'll stay with him the light will go from him to them see so many people want Christ but they want the person outside of them but he's saying no no no you've got to have The Light Within you you've got to become children of light amen it won't be something that just they can go up and talk to in the here and then it goes away but it'll be something that'll be with them all the time he's trying to make a transition here you know he's talking about the the children of light he said walk while while you have the light believe in the light that you may be the children of light what makes you a children Child of Light well what makes me a child of Lanny and Sandy klet it's because I have a portion of Lanny inside of me and I have a portion of Sandy inside of me that's what makes me the child of Lanny and Sandy klette if you're a child of Life what does that mean you are it means you have Light Within you it's the only way you can be a Child of Light is if there is light within you and that's what he's saying is this has to make a transition from being with you to being in you and we talked about this in the past few services but I want to take us back even further in the Book of John to John chapter 1 because we'll see that this light didn't just start at Pentecost too many times we're looking at what happened on the day of Pentecost in that upper room but when we look at the light and we look at the life that dwells in Us by the holy spirit this is something that was way before Pentecost because if you can't see past Pentecost then there's a problem because you can't come to Pentecost unless you were with them before Pentecost ever happened and in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and we we preached on this in many services previously he says the same was in the beginning with With God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now catch this it's speaking of him the word the person it says in him was life and the life was the light of men amen so what is the life it's the word but it's not just the word but it's the Living Word and we see it says that it's the light of men it's the life of men it's all the Living Word it's not just theology it's not just doct it's not just church attendance it's not just water baptism it's not books and tapes but it's the living word amen that makes you live in light that's the only way it's going to work you can be around a lot of light but as soon as you walk away you don't have anything it's got to be something inside of you amen it is a Doctrine it is a theology that's all a part of it going to church and these things but what makes it life is that it's alive it's not the words that it says it's the life behind the words amen the word has a life inside itself and John 1 takes us back to the beginning and says everything that's got Life Today Is Alive because of the word the word is our source of light amen it's life and light it's supposed to produce life amen we know that the word of God is the plans of God it's the thoughts of God it's the very attributes and family of God and it's not a thing that's the problem is people look at it and say this is the word that's not what John 1 says it doesn't say the word is a thing it says the word is a himy it's a person it's a life amen it's the person of the word of God it's the light and the life of that word remember what Jesus would say later in John 6 he said it's the spirit that quickeneth he says the flesh profits nothing it's the it's the spirit that makes something alive he said the words that I speak unto you they are two things they are spirit and they are life so in other words it's not just theology it's not just Doctrine it's not just knowledge it's not just understanding that this word brings but he says it's spirit and it's life it's something that brings life to you it's something that makes you live it takes you out of death and it brings you into life amen Jesus had just preached his his famous service where he said that I am the bread of life and then he said those crazy words that he said if unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you can't have everlasting life and he never explained it now we know what he meant because he said this is it's my body and what is his body it's the word he says You' got to take all of the word you can't take just a part of it but you got to take all of it amen but if he had preached that my words are spirit and life after he had fed the 5,000 and multiplied the bread and the fishes he'd have got a standing ovation when he said my words are spirit and life they' have said Hallelujah yes we see it we see it but that's not what he was talking about that's not what he was talking about but he just preached something that went completely over their heads and he says what I'm preaching to you is spirit and it's life why was he saying this church cuz he was drawing a dividing line between why they were there because there was an awful lot of people that were sitting under the preaching of the word for what it would give them rather than how it would change them everyone wanted to be around for the signs and the Wonders the multiplying of the bread and the fish the the healing of people the casting out of demons and all these Supernatural signs and wonders but how many people were there for the word of God that was a dividing line and after he preaches these and he says these words that I'm speaking to you right here that none of you understand he says there spirit in their life and what happened the scripture says from that day on many walked not with them they left him because they didn't understand they hadn't caught the revelation of who it was who it was that was standing there and when the miracle stopped they left when he stopped giving them food the M then they left when he stopped healing they left but there was people that stuck around that stuck around even though you notice that it's not the signs and wonders that catches the True Believer it's the word you'll notice some of the greatest miracles in scripture happen to people purely by the word of God when that woman came to the well that day outside of Samaria he didn't do a single sign or wonder with her the way that he did with everyone else what caught her was the word cuz she identified what he was doing by the word of God not some great casting out of demons not producing something out of thin air not multiplying anything but he spoke to her in a way that she caught and she says when Messiah comes he'll tell us what you're telling us what was it his words that caught her it's amazing that you can listen to the word tonight and it does something for you and somebody else can sit here and it does absolutely nothing for them the exact same word and it's alive for some and it's dead for others why cuz some people are children of light and some people are children of darkness and guess what you might be a Child of Light and not even realize it right now and you could also be God forbid a child of darkness and not not realize it right now amen but there's only one way to tell and it's what the word does to you that'll tell you who you are amen if you're a child of Darkness the word of God doesn't do anything for you there's nothing in there to respond to it it there's nothing in there that says that's for me but if you're a Child of Light then there's something about the word when it's anointed to your heart that you say that's me even though I don't understand it all I'm not too sure about all of that but there's something in it that's drawing me to it amen some people all you need to do is preach it a certain way and what are they drawn to they're not drawn to the word they're drawn to the style of the word they're drawn to the spin they're drawn to the the activity that's up here the shouting and the whatever it might be but if you're a child of God you love the word no matter what you know we've had some pretty different ministers come through here haven't we we've had some that were just so calm and quiet and we've got some the building can barely contain and guess what we love them all why because the word's coming forth and it's anointed by the holy spirit amen we love the word no matter what why cuz that's what's taken us through that's what's taken us through am me the word's home to us isn't it isn't the word home to us I remember I mean I was under conviction under brother J's preaching from the age of 10 years old and I never gave my heart to the Lord until I was 17 but yet there was something about it that Drew me to it even when I didn't want it even when I didn't want it I wanted to go out as I've said before I wanted to become a doctor and buy a Porsche have a nice house and have wonderful things that's what I wanted but there was something there that kept pulling me why cuz I was a child of God and a child of God is drawn to the word no matter what sometimes it gets pushed down deep sometimes it gets dimmed some times the the volume might get turned down but there's always something that kept calling me back to it and I praise the Lord for that that's why I'm here tonight is because there was something inside of me to respond to the word Amen brother BR would say this he says a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of that baby eagle that was hatched out from under a hand he says you know that the eagle is a type of the True Believer but a farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest and placed it under a hen in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little Eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he says he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all can you imagine an eagle walking around in a barnyard trying to live trying to grow trying to mature he says but one day from way up in the air that mother Eagle that had laid the eggs spy that little Eagle on the ground and she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up and meet her it says he had never heard an eagled cry he had never heard the word before but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out towards it it says but he was afraid to try that's what held me back was I was scared I wouldn't like being a Christian miserable being a non-Christian and not knowing if I was going to like being a Christian he says again that mother screamed for him to arise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid and once more she called out screaming that he Tred beating his wings he hurled himself into the air answering the Cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies he says you see he always was an eagle now catch this he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied amen you I was talking to some some some believing friends of mine back in Alberta one time and you know they were young men and they had many of them they had they had left the church and they had they had stopped believing and there were like four or five of them and they were gathered in a bar drinking alcohol and one of them looked around and he says you know what we are he says we're a bunch of idiots and losers because none of us likes what we're doing we know better and we're sitting here trying to pretend that we belong here and you know what he did he went back and he gave his heart to the Lord and he's serving him today why he was acting like an unbeliever and saying I don't like this and you guys don't either why don't we just fess up and realize we're children of God and go back to serving God and guess what eventually every single one of them did praise the Lord lord well we can act like it sometimes this flesh may get the better of us but it won't satisfy us until we're back in our position where we're supposed to be he says but when he heard the Cry Of The Great Eagle he came to his own place and once a true Son of God hears the Cry of the spirit how by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what is it that's happening when you hear the word you're hearing from eternity you're hearing from your origin you're hearing from your Source you're hearing from your life and there's nothing that can make you respond that way except the word of God listen we can have a good time at a hockey game we can have a good time running around in race cars we can have a good time playing baseball or whatever it might be but for the believer there's nothing like the presence of God coming through his word amen I can't tell you I've had some wonderful times in my hobbies but boy I'll tell you when you're in the presence of God Nothing Compares Nothing Compares and you would never ever ever want to leave that I remember sitting in a service one time and the presence of God had dropped down so supernaturally I couldn't stand and I was just sitting there and it was just like wave after wave and just it was so warm it was so powerful it was so humbling but it was so perfect and it only lasted for about 3 or 4 minutes and I felt that starting to leave and I said don't go don't go don't leave me like this and he came back down and he stayed another L little bit and then it moved on it's the most beautiful thing you can have is when you recognize the presence of God in your midst Hallelujah that's available to every believer this evening that you can know that he's with you that you can know that he's in you that you can know that he cares about you that he could come down and let you know I'm right here tonight sometimes we get pulled away don't we sometimes we get pulled away sometimes this flesh pulls us away sometimes our needs sometimes circumstances sometimes pressure and we get down a a path or a road in life and all of a sudden we realize we're driving blind anyone ever had their lights go out in their car at night sometimes you you you you you flick the switch by mistake somehow and all of a sudden you're driving in darkness it's one of the scariest things and sometimes we're doing that through life and we're just barreling through and then we we realize oh my goodness I don't know what's coming up what does a Believer do they go to the word cuz that'll turn the lights on it'll let you see where you are it may mean you're okay like I've said before when God points me in a direction I go until he tells me otherwise but the word tells me if I'm still headed in the right direction it puts a light in front of me and then we know the scripture in Psalms by heart I'm sure it says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path that means if I compare what's around me with the word then I ought to know whether I'm with the word or not amen I got to know I'm with the will of God Amen and if it lines up with the word then we can move forward in confidence you know I've noticed this in my own life sometimes God blesses us with something and it's genuinely from him and then what does Satan try to do church he tries to come in on the coattails of that blessing and get you to turn it into an idol you brothers that own businesses know what I'm talking about where God you can take that and God has provided for you and God has given you what you have need of and all of a sudden you're turning it into something that he never intended it to be many of us have had good careers and you can you can get attached to that career rather than the will of God and it can take you places you don't need to go amen but we need that word to keep us in Balance day by day and it keeps us focused and it puts a light in front of us us and it keeps us from going too far and realizing we're completely off the path amen because the minute we lose the word we lose our leadership we lose our light we lose our guide and then we lose our confidence amen that's why we listen to the word of God constantly we read it we listen to it we come to church we play tapes we listen to other whatever that might be why because the only way I can see clear is by the word of God I can talk all day long about I have how I have the Holy Spirit to lead and guide me but he does it through this he always points me back to this amen that's the way that he works amen and it's amazing how we can look today talking with some people about this recently how we can look at everything that's going on in the world today and we can find it in the word of God we can look at politics we can look at it exactly in the word for this day and see where it is we can look at the financial systems we can look at the economy we can look at Society we can look at what they value what they're promoting what they're turning down and we can take it we can go exactly back to the word of God and say that's what it says it was going to be like at this time it's there it shows us a light it shows us exactly where we at and I found the thing is that if I spend time with the word I wonder less and less about my days the more time you're in the word of God the more you hear it the more you read it the more you're in it all of a sudden other things start to go away what is it doing it's bringing light to the situation it's burning away the fog yo you listen to a really smart person for a while they can get your theology pretty twisted up but if you are in the word on a regular basis then it'll cut through all of that and it'll show you the truth of the situation it'll show you the truth of the matter amen and you'll find that your discernment is sharpened your understanding sharpened your motives and objectives are clarified you start to walk more cleanly why because that word is changing you when you're feeding on it when you're listening to it when you're putting time into it it's changing you from what you were into what you ought to be on a daily basis it's growing and maturing us the word is not just information it's not just facts amen but it's life it's got a life behind it amen it's light Jesus said stick with me and you'll be children of light why cuz he was the word made flesh and he wanted more to be the word made flesh and it was going to take the light of the holy spirit amen and if they heard that word if they received the word if they believed it and acted on it it was going to bring them to a day of Pentecost where that life would come inside of them pet Peter knew it Peter didn't know everything but he knew that that was one to stick with remember after that sermon he preached on on You Must Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and it sounded like he was talking about being a a vampire or or or uh somebody that that that eats humans a cannibal Peter knew that it that couldn't be what he was talking about but he still didn't understand it but yet at the end of that sermon everybody else is walking away and Jesus looks at him and he says what are you going to do what did Peter say he says Lord to whom shall we go nobody else has anything for me he says Thou Hast the words of eternal life Jesus said if you do what I say you'll have eternal life he says you've told us it's good for eternal life I'm going to stick with you so we see here that that that that life and that light go in hand that says in the beginning was the word it says that word was light and that light life and that life was the light of men so the life and the light are going together you can't have full life without light it t it takes light to make a seed grow as the light varies as the seasons change you'll see that life goes up and down we're coming unfortunately into winter and what's happening the life is going out as the light shortens throughout the days life goes out and it goes back into the ground for so many things but then as the light starts to come back then what happens light comes with the light amen but Jesus was drawing a line of Distinction here between those that thought they were children of light and those that were actually children of light and in John 12 Jesus he finishes up with the triumphal entry into Jerusalem and then he's having conversations with people and he goes into the upper room with all 12 of his disciples and they're eating the Passover and he's washing the disciples feet every single one of them got their feet washed even Judas even Judas got his feet washed the man that would betrayed Jesus got his feet washed you know what that tells me it tells me you can come right up to it and not be a child of God Judas had a sanctification experience if we could put it that way but that didn't mean everything amen A Life That's cleaned up that's not the new birth that shows God's working but that's not necessarily the New Birth the new birth is when the person of God comes to live inside of you he's got to clean you up before he can come in you that's a sanctification work it means God's working in your life but the Finish is not sanctification it's to have the Holy Spirit living inside of us amen CU Judas ran all the way up to sanctification but after that washing of feet Jesus starts to talk to them and he says hey one of you is going to betray me and everyone's like well is it me is it me and Judas says is it I and Jesus says yes it's you and he lets Judas know that he knows what he's going to do and then as soon as Judas leaves then J Jesus really starts to open up after Judas leaves is when the word really starts to be opened up to them why cuz Judas couldn't hear it Judas was not a Child of Light he was a child of Darkness amen and then we come to our opening scripture in John 14 and Jesus is really opening up now he's letting them see what's coming he's showing them how the Redemption plan's going to work and he's talking about the transition of the dwelling place of God from A Man Called Jesus Christ into a multimember body of the Bride of Jesus Christ and he says in John 4:12 he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father now we said before greater doesn't mean that they're greater in magnitude it means they'll be greater in number CU Jesus was only doing things for three and a half years now through 2,000 years he's got hundreds and thousands of people working in his name and with his spirit and so it's they were going to do more than he was in terms of numers numbers but watch what he says here he says you're going to have a continuation of my Ministry that's how he starts out as he tells us what our heritage is he tells us what our inheritance is he tells us what our position is and it's to continue his work then he says now what what a thing to say verse 13 whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the Sun so this is speaking of authority in the name of Jesus Christ then he says if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it now we have to remember we have to take this through the whole filter of scripture because this is not Authority by personal will it's Authority by relationship amen it requires Unity for this to work because remember what John would say later I think in first or 2 John he says if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and we know that if he heareth us he's going to do it amen this is by unity with Christ that you can speak and receive this is not a a a k blanch as they would say to go out and just start speaking things that's false Doctrine cuz we never saw Christ himself doing that he said I only say what the father says and if you got the same Spirit then you'll have the same unity and you'll have the same surrender he says if you love me keep my Commandments how simple a test is that he didn't say keep most of them he said keep all of them and then he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever we're going to preach on the comforter in the later service but what is this comforter he says it's even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive he says because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you we know what that is it's Christ that is in the form of the holy spirit amen and now he's saying here there's a distinction being drawn and the dis and the dividing line is the spirit of Truth he says the spirit of Truth is for you he says and the world cannot receive it the world cannot receive the holy spirit it's impossible for them to do it why he says because they can't see it they can't hear it they can't receive it there's nothing in them that recognizes what it is there's no resonance there's no attraction to the word when it comes their way but for the children of God they can receive him not only can they receive him they will receive him amen they're ordained to do it they see him they know him that's the literal identification of a true child of God is that they can receive the holy spirit amen why because there's something in them that they can hear it they can receive it they can believe it they can accept it they can apply it they can surrender to it they can hold to it and then what happens is the word is Made Alive in them by the Holy Spirit that's what happens nobody else can receive the holy spirit in their soul except a child of God it's impossible Jesus said they cannot do it why cuz they're not a part of it they never were a part of it therefore they cannot be a part of it amen they aren't in the word they weren't a part of the word and so they can't be anything as it comes to relationship to God that's why Judas couldn't stick around and hear this it wasn't for him he had no part of it because he was too busy doing what he wanted to do and that's the way the world is today is they're just trying to do what they want to do rather than what the world says what rather what the word says amen he even stuck it through the foot washing he stuck it through all the signs and wonders but when it came time for the spirit of Truth he couldn't handle that he couldn't handle that anymore and he left before Jesus even opened up about it why he wasn't a Child of Light scripture says that Judas was not just a child of Darkness it says he was the son of predition Amen he's one of many he's a son of predition that word predition means destruction damnation waste and ruin so Judas was the son of Destruction and Damnation talk about a Heritage what a horrible place to be in amen and yet there's people like him all around the world all around this world and so many of them are doing exactly what he did which is sitting in church sitting in church and what happens is they hang around the word and they hang around the word and then something happens that they don't like and they walk away and what do they do they go to a word of their own making rather than the full word cuz the spirit of truth will take you all the way to the full word of God Amen what was Judas weakness money Judas wanted the money and so in the end when the money was spent in a way that he didn't like and he was a thief and that caused him to pull away some people pull away when they lose influence some people pull away when the minister says something they don't like or he offends them some people pull away when they lose their position some people pull away because of the way the pastor preaches it can be all sorts of things sometimes they get hurt by the Believers in the congregation whatever it might be but one thing is is that they end up following their own ideas they have their own goals they have their own purposes and the thing that's common to every single one of them is they walk away from the word they don't think they do but that's exactly what happens amen the effect is always that they walk away from Christ the word I know many people that left the message 10 years ago personally friends to some of them related to others but to a person every single one of them today has walked away from the word of God you know you know what some said when they left we're going back to Christ that's what they said we're going back to Jesus see what they thought was that he was he was the person of their emotions and their feelings and their good intentions and he's not he's the person of the word and when you leave the word you leave Christ you can say I'm going to church you can say that I believe this and I love this and I love God and I no no no if you leave the word you've left Christ amen he identifies himself as Christ the word and every single one of them has gone down a path of unrighteousness today some of them religious unrighteousness but most of them have just Fallen away and gone back to exactly what the rest of the world is doing why scripture says it has to be that way there's a bride being called out but the scripture says that day can't come except there be a great Falling Away first and you can't fall away unless you had something you can't fall away unless you climb some level some maybe only went to justification some might have went to sanctification some may have gone all the way to the gifts but they fell away from it and when they fall away they can't repent and bring themselves back because the scripture says they can't do that either because they'd Rec crucify Christ all over again these are not atheists these are not unbelievers we're talking about we're talking about people that profess to be Christians and yet what happens is by and by the word offends them and they walk away that's a leene condition isn't it all it is is self-deception all it is is self-deception and so they're sitting there and if you go read it in Revelation 3 about the latest Seasons it says you think you're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing it says but know not that you're miserable wretched poor blind and naked they're self deceived they have no idea of their condition that's the greatest deception this world has is self-deception because you can't fix it cuz you don't even know it that's what self-deception is is you don't know know you've been fooled and it takes the word of God by the Holy Spirit to open your eyes that's the only thing that can take us out of self-deception because that's the leot toing condition they've got to hear what the spirit says that's the only way to get out of it but the thing I love about the word of God is that it always identifies us clearly it always identifies us listen if you're a Child of Light it identifies you and if you're a child of Darkness it identifies you just as well and it's always by the word of God Amen I don't believe I'm a I'm a child of God today because I sit in church and Nod my head and say amen that's good that's a part of it but I believe I'm a Child of God because my life lines up with the word I know what I used to be I know what I am I know how I used to be led I know how I'm LED now I know how I used to think I know how I think to now why because the word is living inside of me it's the Holy Spirit you I remember a story it might have been Joseph brandom or Billy Paul maybe that gave a book to a man and that man came back to him he said said I hate that book he says that man called me a buzzard and whoever this person was looked at him said I love that man because he called me an eagle same message but identified two completely different people didn't it one was a buzzard and one was an eagle amen it's the same word but it's identifying two groups children of light and Children Of Darkness amen and they're identified by the word they're not identified by what they say they are the word identifies them amen it's not me I don't get to say I'm a Child of God the word says I am and that's going to have the final say Amen but we've been tested by the word we know that and I believe we've been found faithful children of God are tested and tried by the word and the question is always will you stay with the word of God that's the only test there is for a Believer stay with the word or go your own way that's the only test whether it's finances whether it's relationships whether it's jobs whether it's moving whether it's staying whether it's going whether it's Ministry whatever it might be your leadership is will you stay with the word of God God or do your own thing and it's usually through a religious way of self-deception that we go our own way we try and bend the word to us rather than fit ourselves to the word It's usually the way it works amen but regardless of those circumstances we stay with the word I believe we do that I believe I'm looking at people today that stay with the word no matter what I've seen the decisions you've made I've seen the things you've done with your job I've seen the things you've done with your families I've seen the things you've done with your finances and your relationships and moving and staying as the case may be I see the sacrifices that some of you have made and there's many more you've made that I don't know and what is it it's showing that there's something inside of you that there's an anchor there's an anchor in your soul and it's always going to be by the word of God Paul would say this about the children of God he says but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief he's talking about the end of it all he's talking about the day of Our Lord now you got to remember there's a day of Our Lord for us us and there's a day of the Lord for them cuz the day of the Lord for the believer is the resurrection and the Rapture but the day of the Lord cuz that's when we see him but they see him when he comes back in judgment but he says you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness he says therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober why are others sleeping cuz they have no worries they have no concerns they don't think anything's coming but he says we don't do that he says we stay sober he says and we are watching for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love forign helmet the hope of Salvation he's saying buckle up there's a battle come in here don't get LAX don't get lazy don't stay home put on the full armor of God and then he says for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ so if you're not appointed for wrath if you're not appointed for judgment you must be appointed for something else praise the Lord and then if judgment isn't for you it means that you're appointed for the opposite which is what Grace favor appointed for grace and favor this evening we spoke about it last service about how we're supposed to come boldly to the throne what of grace and mercy that's our appointment is for Mercy amen we're appointed for acceptance we're appointed for healing we're appointed to be welcomed into the presence of God our Salvation is secure amen from the foundation of the world and we see that that's what the holy spirit will do is it confirms to you who you are by the word of God that's what Paul's saying here he's saying you're children of light because you come from light and you're going back to light remember the first thing that was created was that Pillar of Fire in Genesis 1 uh 2 and 3 I think where it says he created light and what happened is God stepped into it and it was the word that's why John said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made what light and that light became life and every bit of us were in there there in that light in the beginning it's a part of the original body amen and that's why you are children of light is because you come from light your father is light that's the only thing that can make you you're a part of the word because you always were in the word and that's why you're going back to the fullness of the word in Christ amen but watch the progression now as as we're back to the upper room and on the night of the Passover and Jesus is talking with the disciples here and remember now he's with the elect he's with the chosen this is a selected group of men now Judas has gone on to do what he's got to do and he's talking to these people he's talking to the 11 remaining disciples and he's saying nevertheless I tell you the truth it's expedient for you that I go away he's saying I've got to go it's better for you that I go than I stay you think what could be more important than the personal presence of God in his form there but he says you don't understand but let me tell you just believe this it's better for you that I go think about it how much tonight would we prefer to have the body of Jesus Christ here and he says no it's better that I go because there's something coming that'll help you more than my physical presence what was he trying to do he says you got to grow you got to mature you got to come into adoption and that can't happen unless I go because they'd lean on the arm of Flesh way too much they'd lean on the arm of Flesh and guess what the arm of Flesh wasn't doing them nearly the good that they thought it was CU every time he's around there what does Jesus keep having to say oh ye of little faith oh ye of little faith they have God incarnate in flesh and he keeps saying why are you so scared why are you so worried why aren't you doing what I told you to do time and time again the physical presence of God was not doing them any good that I you know what I mean it wasn't doing them as much good as what would happen on the day of Pentecost let me put it that way he says it's obedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I'll send him unto you he says you need the Holy Spirit more than you need my physical presence he says and when he is come he will reprove that word means convict rebuke correct he will rebuke the world of sin and of righteousness and judgment now watch this is the comforter coming and he says the comforter is going to rebuke the world I what brother Aaron Oglesby spoke of when he was at Camp he said David loved correction remember what he said in Psalms he says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me a Shepherd has a rod and a staff he says and when I feel that Rod it comforts me cuz remember sometimes the rod is there to whack you to get you back to where you need to be sometimes it's there to rescue you and sometimes it's just there to let you know hey I'm with you he says that's my comfort but this is not the same Comfort to the world Amen he says I'm going to reprove them of sin because they believe not on me what is sin lying drinking stealing cheating sexual immorality that's not Sin Sin he says here is unbelief he says you're convicted of sin because you don't believe remember what the scripture says of Adam and Eve in the beginning it says that she was found in transgression she sinned because what she did was through unbelief Adam never disbelieved the word he chose to he chose to go against it for her sake but he never disbelieved he never disbelieved the scripture never accuses Adam of sinning but he broke the word of God and he had to pay the price Eve disbelieved and she sinned Adam did not disbelieve he went in with his eyes wide open knowing full well what he did he says I'll I'll rebuke them of righteousness because I go to the my father and you see me no more and of judgment because the prince of this world is judged now watch this shift now we're talking about the spirit of Truth and Jesus Takes the turn and we have a part in this we have a part in receiving it but we have a part in producing it because you see in verses 8 to 11 what the Holy Spirit Will in us will do it'll reprove the world for how they're living absolutely it will look when Peter comes down from the upper room on the day of Pentecost what does he do he reproves him he says you've killed the Prince of Glory you went and you killed him you sacrificed him he came for you he came to save you and you went and you killed him and he says there's a judgment for that there's a price to be paid but he came for you and what happens when the spirit of Truth is there and it reproves what does it do it catches the children of light they can take reproof because it says their hearts were pricked they heard the reproof and they said hey that's me I did that I was part of the crowd that did it what do I do and what did the word come forth with a remedy the word's not there to judge you the word is there to show you how to get out from under the Judgment but it let it has to let you know you're under judgment so it can take you out otherwise you're going to go bumbling through life thinking you're okay and you're going to get to the end and realize oh my goodness I wasn't okay the word comes to let you know you're not okay and shows you how to come to a place that's okay so they said to him what do I have to do how do I get rid of this guilt and he says repent for the remission of sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll receive the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that's going to work not just repentance not just baptism but it's the Holy Spirit that'll change you it's the holy spirit that will take that away amen cuz the spirit of truth comes always with salvation first and if you turn it down it's going to be judgment but Jesus is focused now on what this is going to do for us he says this is what it does but now he's talking to us because remember those disciples already had a Ministry with signs and wonders they were preaching the gospel of repentance uh that Christ had given them they had faced persecution they've been proven and they had shared jesus' message all around the land and yet that wasn't enough that wasn't enough because watch what Jesus says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now there's a time and there's a season for everything and you'll see here Jesus says there are things that you can't see you can't hear you can't understand you can't receive until you have the Holy Ghost otherwise it'll break you it'll break you sometimes it's because it's hardship and sometimes because it's Authority and you don't have that character yet but whatever it is there's some things that we can't bear we can't carry we can't handle until we get the Holy Ghost he says now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he'll guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he'll show you things to come Jesus knew things that he had held back from them amen because the Believers needed a new birth before they could receive it they had truth but he says you need to come into all Truth Listen Judas had truth but the truth did did not hold Judas why cuz he didn't have all of it he had most of it but he didn't have the most important part of it which was the life and the light of the truth not just the facts of The Truth Listen you think about it the truth hadn't held Peter either did it Peter backed down when persecution came when they kind of put him on the mark and said are you a follower of Jesus he denied him and he denied him and he denied him he had a lot of truth but the truth wasn't enough he needed the spirit of the truth to hold him that was the Difference Maker he knew plenty amen but he needed the Living Word inside of him the spirit of God inside of him not just the facts not just the doctrine not just the passion but he needed a reality a life inside of him amen being around truth won't hold you you got to become truth you got to be a part of Truth you got to receive it and let it be a living part inside of you Amen brother Brandon would say this he says when he not a thought he says he he is a personal pronoun when he the Holy Ghost has come the spirit of Truth he will reveal these things to you that I have said unto you and will show you things to come he says that's the great Shepherd that's the Shepherd that Jesus left he's saying I've said all sorts of things to you and you don't even understand it but when you get the Holy Ghost it'll be made clear what I was talking about Jesus had said before this that we read he says the works that I do shall you do also he said said if you ask anything in my name I'll do it and he said Greater Works than I do shall you do and all of those wonderful things were in the future every single one of those things and Jesus is saying the the spirit of Truth the holy spirit is going to come back and he will reveal these things to you what was he revealing on the day of Pentecost did the Holy Spirit reveal Doctrine no he revealed the reality of it he made it manifest he made it real that's what he's talking about amen yes there was Doctrine involved when the disciples walked out of the upper room but when they went to the gate beautiful and went around the city afterwards and and and working signs and wonders and going here and there what was the change the change was not the signs and wonders the change was they had leadership now they had Direction they had a guide they had something inside of them that gave them not only the faith to do it but the unction to do it in the first place they knew where to go what to do and how to do it and they they they Marvel at them because it said they saw that they were were unlearned men they were ignorant men they weren't going around converting people by great speeches and sermons but they said that they knew that they had been with Jesus why cuz he was they were doing the exact same things that Jesus was doing amen I preached on this before and this is just my personal thing to say if I could put it that way you can take it or leave it we look at that that phrase and it says that he'll show you things to come and we automatically jump to prophecy and we know know that we know that the the holy spirit is thus sayeth the Lord amen it it does speak in Prophecy amen but I believe that it's more than that because when we look at the Fulfillment of this on the day of Pentecost it wasn't just prophecy it was reality show you things to come what good is it if we're always talking about it but we never get it that's what the holy spirit is to do is to take it from words and into reality in our day-to-day lives he'll show you things to come so that the things that you speak of the things that you read the things that you hear become a reality in your life church we're in the final age the speaking is done the speaking is done there's no more prophecy coming for the Gentiles it's finished she's received her last message amen now is the time of fulfillment showing you things to come making them a reality inside of our Lives amen now is the time of showing it's the time of manifestation not the time of Prophecy prophecy he's been given now is the time where we live it where it produces itself inside of us he says I'm very thankful that the spirit of Truth was to be with us to the end and that Spirit of Truth is none other but the Lord Jesus himself in spiritual form for he said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he says and that means tonight that means tonight tonight and wherever we are we have the comforting words of knowing that Jesus will be with us how comforting would it be if he were to appear in the physical body here tonight we've got some needs we're going to pray for tonight how comforting would it be if Jesus Christ stepped Down In the Flesh here how would that change the atmosphere in this room if you knew that Jesus Christ was standing here brother Dale that he could come over there and he could touch you and lay his hands on you what would that do for you tonight it would change wouldn't it that every need that you have need of you could walk up to that person and he could answer he could deliver he could heal he could provide he could lead he could speak to the need he could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart how wonderful would that be and yet he says he's with us the same way tonight by faith you may not see him you may not feel him but he's here nonetheless cuz he said where two or three are gathered in my name there am I personal pronoun in the midst amen he's here in spirit form to carry us through and you don't have to reach out and touch him you can just touch him by faith amen he's here to lead us he's here to guide us he's here to take us all the way through as we start to close he says ' and now I come to thee he's still talking to the disciples he's talking to he's in prayer here actually he says now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them what Thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil what did Christ give them he gave them the word he gave them the word but he says my words are spirit and life so he gave them the word but he's got to give them the full word not just the letter it says they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth he says now catch this this is one of the most beautiful scriptures he says as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world how did God send that man Jesus Christ into the world he held him for 30 years and then what did he do did he have a Ministry in those 30 years not as we know but he came down on the River Jordan and he placed his very own spirit inside of him and from there he sent him into his ministry he had the word all along now he had the person of the word inside of him and only then did he send him out and Jesus says As you have sent me I'm going to send them the same way no different I've given them my word they need the spirit they need the presence amen he was sending them as he was sent with Supernatural indwelling God inside of them a life a guide a light to direct their footsteps he says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth he says Thy word is true Tru he said that the spirit of Truth was coming and then he says Thy word is truth and so if we put that together we could say that the spirit of Truth is the spirit of the word amen the spirit of Truth the holy spirit will always confirm the word it will always point to the word it will always stay in line with the word of God because that is the only truth there is amen that is the anchor for our soul it is our absolute is our foundation why CU it's the word it's the Living Word it's the spirit of the word amen it's the life of the word of God and it will always take you into the word we can have Sensations we can have emotions we can have experiences those are all good and and well but it will always take you into the word that's how you know that it's God leading you amen he will always anchor Us in the word of God I'm going to read a five quotes and we'll close he says the word always comes to the true spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said I will pray the father he'll send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive he says now we know what truth is Thy word is truth John 17:17 again in John 8:43 says why do you not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word he says did you notice and we read this that the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost he says well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets did the word would come to you you would receive it he says in John 14:26 it says the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God again in John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth word is come he will guide you into all truth he says Thy word is truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear what the word of God that shall he speak the word and he will show you things to come he says it's the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy I want you to know very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prop prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence will be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age he says the evidence has to do with receiving that word amen he says First Corinthians 14:37 37 says if any man think of himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord I was talking to brother Joe about this today at the gym I said it amazes me that the Catholic Church declares Peter to be the first pope and it's not Peter that had the scriptural Authority who had it Paul Paul says you have to acknowledge my message why because he says I didn't do this of myself I didn't come up with this he says it came out of from the Holy Ghost himself he says I can't even change it and he didn't change it the first head if you want to call it of the church on this Earth would have been Paul if we were going to pick one but he wasn't the head of the church he was was just a prophet amen he was a prophet used and led by the Holy Spirit to bring the Full Gospel to the Gentile church but in the end there was no Pope there it was just men being led by the spirit he says now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order Paul had to say to those who claimed another Revelation in verse 36 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only see it only comes to me from somebody else I've received the word for my age the holy spirit's already spoken I've received it I'm a repeater Paul got it fresh and don't don't get me wrong I believe the Holy Spirit quickens the word to me it brings the word to me but it lines me up with what the Holy Spirit has already said in this age and in this message because that's their only one voice there only one voice I've got to line up with that other wise I'm saying the word came to me no no no came to a prophet and I've received it and that was the Holy Spirit speaking through that man he says this he says uh where am I at he says Paul had to say yes the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth but to receive the truth the word and to believe and Obey it how simple is that how simple is that that's why we don't have to try and prove anything you accept the word the word does the work it's that simple that gives me such rest to just say Lord I believe it and I'm not just believing it in my mind and with my mouth but I'm applying it I'm letting it have its effect in my life and I can trust you for the results he says have you noticed in Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come he says see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she's a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word for their age he says did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that ha an ear let him the individual he what the spirit sayith to the churches he said the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age last quote each age has had its own elect and the that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them John 8:47 says and he that is of God heareth God's words so simple ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God you know what the spirit of truth will tell the truth and Jesus calls him out he says the reason you can't hear it is because you're not of it he says they refused the word Jesus and his words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of God he says and all thy children shall be taught of God the Holy Spirit Isaiah 54:13 Jesus said the same thing in John 6:45 he says being one with the word proves whether you are of God and Spirit-filled there there is no other Criterion amen God bless you let's stand if we would amen we've got a lot further to go on this but being a Wednesday night I didn't want to press the People Too Much amen the spirit of Truth we can hang our soul on what the spirit of Truth says amen tonight we've got some needs we're going to pray for we got sister Katrina butt here that wants to be prayed for she's been diagnosed with cancer she's going in for some tests tomorrow so we're going to bring her up for prayer and then brother Dale has notified us that he has also been diagnosed with prostate cancer and so we're going to bring him up to pray after we prayed for sister Katrina so we're going to sing that song If we would he is able more than able 721 and we're going to ask sister Katrina to come up first if she would and then when she's done brother Dale we'll bring you up as well and I'm going to have the two deacons come up if we would if they would and uh pray with me when we do this amen we'll sing this twice and sister Katrina can come up amen he is able more than aable to accomplish what concern me today he is able more than able he can handle anything that comes my way he is able more than able to do much more than I could ever her dream he is able more than aable to make me what he wants need to be sing it one more time and he is able more than able to to accomplish what concerns me today he is able more than able he can handle anything that comes my way he is able more than able to do much more than I could ever dream he is able more than able to make me what he wants me to be amen you know we've had testimonies in this church of the healing power of God and then we've got brother Bob's come through cancer then my sister Alanta many of you have seen her testimony stage four lymphoma healed in nine weeks completely gone never had a touch again anden I know many people have been healed by cancer so we don't have to fear it we don't have to fear a thing but one thing Satan will try and do is he'll try and flare up the circumstances amen he'll throw the doctor's reports at you he'll do everything he can to get you off the word and so when we stand here tonight the scripture says if any are sick among you let them come to the elders they'll anoint them with oil and if they have any sins they'll be forgiven of them and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick so that's all we're doing tonight we're saying Lord we believe we accept your word we've we seen it work we've seen it do what it says it will do and so we're believing that for sister Katrina tonight amen amen sister krina according to the scriptures I anoint you with oil and we're going to pray the prayer of faith amen amen Lord Jesus Lord what a place of privilege we stand in this evening Heavenly Father Lord that we've heard a
