bow again Lord and ask Lord Your Grace is upon us as we come Lord to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and Lord we just had desire to be Overcomers in this age Lord we strive Lord to surrender all to you Lord and Lord that you would just take everything in control Lord and bring it subject Lord to the word for this day and the our Lord and the spirit Lord diligently walks upon the Earth in each believer Lord getting us into the right place Lord in this final hour to be ready for that Rapture and the change of the body so we pray Lord that you would just remember each one Lord remember those that aren't with us Lord we just pray your grace and we just pray be with them and before them those that are traveling give them Lord just a blessing Lord and Lord that they would Lord just not fall into our delays Lord that they would be able to Lord just arrive their Journey safely and on time so we asked Lord that you would be with each one those who are sick member brother Kingsley if he goes to his baptism Lord we just thank you Lord for grace in his life and just be with him and Lord we just asked Lord for uh sister Emma Farrell Lord just pray your grace to her and Lord her need at this time lord we just pray you be with her and bless our Lord we're just ask and your will be done in her life so we ask Lord your grace to Brother John as he comes to minister bless his heart Lord and soul in him Lord just move himself out of the way let the Holy Spirit speak through him and Lord that we could also move ourselves out of the way and Lord that we could receive Lord your word and your will today bless us all we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated at this time so I'm just going to give a little tiny short update just we haven't done much there lately on the update so just it's only a couple of minutes there we said before that uh you know that all the things that had to be done need to get into the lawyers so we're selling this billing to 571 and we're buying 50 Longshore road trying to close all that at the one time so everything for this building is done it's all in the lawyer's hands there's nothing else to be done so there's more the issues with the other church and the other church is not as simple because there's a lot of structure on that side that's managing the sale of all of these churches that they're trying to sell so in this case here the church is all on the same property as the as the school and the residents so it's all what it was all one just one owner the RC church for that so they didn't put in a request into the town of CBS in order to get that land all divided up into three so they could get a proper survey so they didn't do that so that's a delay so there's going to be no January 4th that's not going to happen surprise surprise so uh is is now is gone out to January 11th so the lawyers kind of think that they're they're going to have that all done we hope by January 11th so the lawyer on the on the on the RC Church side they uh she she didn't work this week so so there was nothing done basically we just got into the Trap of this this uh time of the year unfortunate so if if something doesn't get done on the 11th the backup plan is that we're trying to get a rental agreement to get into the church so the lawyers are going to work on that the two lawyers are going to work to get an agreement so we would see us go in probably just pay the utilities for whatever at least we can get if we don't get that at least we're gonna work we get our stuff moved over in there anyway so but it shouldn't be any problem because in the other agreements the churches are having the same delays so they're doing rental agreements for those people too so should be a template there we'll sign it and get in so so that's the plan the backup plan is you know we'd have to get Andrew Fleming to find us a place or whatever so so it's a few things we can do but uh hopefully if the agreement doesn't go through we just get a rental agreement we go in we just it'll be normal except you won't be able to do many things and then you can uh you know when they do sign it off we can just take full control here I know that's not what that's going to be pushed out all done together he has all tied together it's still time together but but the the buyer of this place is really anxious to get in here and you can't blame him you know he wants to get started he's got all his permits in to get to get all the changes he wants in this building and stuff like that so it's unfortunate uh so everything is ready on our side the mortgage is ready all ready to go and when the lawyers wanted the money will go right too the city permit is done so for us to be uh you know uh and we don't know we're not subject to city taxes so uh because we're a charitable group so they we won't have to pay that insurance is all done and um it's just a matter of switching over some of the things like the utilities and the mailbox and all that kind of stuff so so uh so that's that's really it that's where we are it's uh really in the lawyer's hands there's nothing for us really to do only just uh if just you know just keep after him and get it done it's very busy on that side on the Ashley side with what you're doing because they started now with the schools as well so once that gets split up get a survey it should be all ready to go for us right and and hopefully we'll be in there even before you know we won't be much delay amen so that's where we are just a quick update defending changes we'll we'll be giving further updates amen so let's uh sing 237 Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Upon Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus look forward [Music] [Music] in the light of his glory and pray one more time Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] of his glory and Grace amen all our eyes are on Jesus at this time so we see everything starting to get in order it's got a lot of things falling away because he has to get it all in place now for the end everything has to be in its place and Israel is is right on the verge they they're just waiting for the bride to be out of the way in a whole Revival will come into the 144 000

certainly want to appreciate give my appreciation for that it's it's been it has been and I trust it will continue to be a pleasure to serve amen a pleasure to minister here to the Saints of like Precious faith and and everyone's been very gracious to me as I as I grow and learn and mature behind the pulpit and outside of it of course as well so I'm thankful for it and God bless you each one amen we have many prayer requests of course Mr Rochelle's family coming in tonight praying God's grace to them they should be landing fairly soon sister Betty had a some tests this week and they've got some concerns that they have there so we want to pray about those results amen trust that God will move on her behalf that he'll give her the healing that she needs guide the doctors and all these things it's been a rough year for her we want to remember our pastor's wife every day and just trust that God has his hand in it all amen certainly want to run remember brother Kingsley as he gets baptized on this frigid Sunday morning coming up I think it's supposed to be a high of about two or three degrees that morning so pray for him pray for me as I baptize him I I have I have got some protection to go in there with so that I don't get too cold or wet but he's going to be he's going to be soaked from head to toe and it's going to be cold so we trust God will be with them amen and bless them and fill them with the Holy Ghost amen amen it's uh the baptism is just the start it's just a representation amen but we want him to be baptized with fire of the Holy Spirit that'll clean his life out and make him to live like a child of God Amen I bring greetings this evening from Brother Jim Dooley from Brother Ed hammermeister from Brother Tony adma who said to mention specifically the coffees and brother Gerald and sister Betty since those are the ones that he knows and has traveled with are seen and whatnot but each of them I was talking to Brother John Andy's in the office as well so I'll pass on greetings from him but each of them wanted me to to remember them to the to the congregation and say that you have a special place in their heart and they're thinking of you brother Jim Dooley will be here in the spring Lord willing so I was telling them about the new church so he was very excited about that but each one of them wanted to be remembered so God bless you from each of those different men amen Luke chapter two I know we're past Christmas but this is kind of the Christmas message that the lord has laid on my heart so Luke 2 and verse 4 says and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth under Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the Inn amen God bless you you can have your seats and I know we're past Christmas time but certainly I wasn't sure if we were going to have have a service on on Christmas day so but I was just praying Lord what would you have me to minister and we don't want to preach a Christmas message by tradition that's for sure amen we want to go by leadership and so I just said Lord if you want me to break into to my Redemption series and whatnot then give me a thought and and so I was just dwelling on different things and this thought dropped into my heart of a title and it was the condescending God Amen condescending God and just stuck there and the Lord started to bring some scriptures to my mind and then I started to have conversations with different people about this very thing and whatnot so I said Lord I'm just going to trust you and and allow you to kind of lead me through it so I I want to speak on the condescending God Amen and we just read in Luke Chapter 2 of how God condescended how he came down and the Simplicity and the humility that was behind it but I want to start with this word condescend or condescending because today if somebody's condescending it's not a compliment it's not a good thing we say if somebody's condescending it means they're snooty they're they're haughty they think they're better than you they they think they're at a higher level of life than you they have more money than you they're better looking they're Better Built you know whatever they have a better career they have better family whatever it is and they'll be condescending if they're around you and they they talk down to you so often and you can tell that they're just not comfortable being around you that they they think they're out of their element and they're supposed to be above maybe the people that they're with but the the word condo sand in its original use and certainly in its biblical use means something different or it means what it's ought to mean before we we added the slight to it that we do today and it it means to willingly lower oneself to another's level to willingly do it because today people condescend unwillingly they come down and they'll spend time with you because they have to because they work with you because they have to deal with you in their job or or even at church or whatever it might be and they they they're condescending but they don't want to be in that position they don't want to be around the people they're with but yet when God condescended he willingly did it he did this of his own free will he desired to do it amen and he had to step into something other than a Godly form to come down and redeem this Earth so we're not I haven't titled this as part of the Redemption series but this is the start of redemption in terms of the physical portion of redemption it was the start of the the real plan of God of redemption when going into into in the manifestation but when God came down and dwelt in a body called Jesus Christ it wasn't a super body with superpowers with with super capabilities to do things that we couldn't necessarily do what he did was he came down in a body like Adam had if you because it was a body that was made without sin but yet it was still subject to the things that Adam was subject to it still had a brain it still had emotions it still had hormones it still had thoughts that could run through it it could still receive Temptation it could still receive influence from other people and and by the spirit world and all these different things amen so when he came down he didn't build himself a body that would be immune to humanity he stepped into the very thing that humanity is that Humanity was at that time and he didn't come down with a big name or a big Heritage or big wealth or Fanfare he wasn't warning born into a Grand Mansion or or the best hospital with the best doctors but he came down in a very quiet way and the only ones that knew where he was in a dirty filthy stable surrounded by livestock were shepherds and his parents that's how he came down in it amen and he came down in a humble way and we're talking about the great God the the self-existing one the one that is worthy of our praise and our honor and he came down in a way that required no worship and no praise he came down in a way that wouldn't draw people to him and the prophet of God said this he says that's what makes him God to me because he humbled himself when we talk about condescending God it means he's humbling himself willingly for purpose and he's coming to somebody that is beneath him naturally speaking with a purpose and the prophet says God is humility don't never forget that humility is God never boastful it's always humility amen I believe the prophet of God said an arrogant spirit is never of God and you know that somebody is not having the Holy Spirit influencing them if they have an arrogant spirit because we never saw that in Christ you can be hard and not be arrogant you can be right to not be arrogant you can be correct you can be corrective and not be arrogant amen but he came in humility brother Brown would say when he came he was in a barn born by a mother and a father that had an illegitimate background to it seemed to be as they thought wrapped in his swaddling clothes they tell me was off the Yoke of an ox they were that poor and God the god that created heavens and earth and made everything by Christ Jesus and here was the very Creator God who made the very heavens and earth laying in a stable in a bunch of straw that he had created himself the creator of heavens and earth humbled himself to become the lowest the highest becoming the lowest that's what made him God that's what made him what he was see he humbled himself man couldn't do that and let me say today man can't do that and you can't humble yourself in the way that he did unless you have the very nature of Christ inside of you unless you get the Holy Spirit you say I know lots of humble people in the world push him push him everybody's humble to a point sometimes but you push them beyond the point and then you see what happens guess what Pride will flare up self-preservation will flap something will come up but in if you have the spirit of Christ you have the nature of Christ you'll Humber yourself all the way to death because in death you'll find life as well when we come out of it amen but God came down with a purpose and a part of that purpose was so that he could experience what it meant to be like you and I because you've got to realize that God is a spirit the scripture says God is a spirit he doesn't have a natural body the way we have he doesn't understand he could not he does now but he could not understand what it meant to be human he could understand it in the way that we understand pain so let me put it this way if I say it what does a punch feel like if somebody punches you what does it feel like you say it hurts and you know intellectually that the definition of what you feel when you get punched is hurt pain but you don't know what it means to be punched until what you get punched and so God could say I understand that that they have emotions and I understand that they have thoughts and I understand that they have temptations but you're in a you're looking at it through the lens of a God who is completely pure there's no there's no shadow of turning no variableness in them there's no sin there's no deceit there's no hypocrisy God in that form can't even be tempted amen so he could he could have a concept of what it meant to be human but he couldn't understand it by experience and so when he came down part of the reason he came into human flesh was so that he could understand what it was that we went through and why we do things the way we do why we are so foolish so often why we fail so easily where are the faults and cracks come into our life because he could only understand it because he all he knew everything but he couldn't have the understanding of the feeling of it of the way that we work in these things God wanted to see what we see and he wanted to experience what we experienced prophet of God said when God dropped he unfolded himself unfolded himself down until he come to this man now man sinned not in his Spirit but in his body lust passion then when he sinned he separated himself from his maker and then God the logos the very creator of him came down and was made in the image of man man was made in the image of God and then he was made in the image of the Beast and he fell and God came down in the image of man in the man Christ Jesus to suffer pain God could not suffer pain in the spirit how could he suffer physical pain in the spirit he couldn't do it so God unfolded himself and was made in the image of man to redeem the man that was lost see he said and then God suffered in flesh First Timothy 3 16 says without controversy that's argument without argument great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh scene of angels preached on and believed and received up to the right hand of the father is that right God himself came down and lived in a human body and suffered remember he said God suffered In the Flesh he says God suffered Temptation God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he said see what love is the love of God that he would come down and he would suffer when he didn't have to suffer that he would go through the things that we go through not having to necessarily go through it amen it wasn't morbid curiosity that brought that brought God down from heaven amen because God doesn't do things for fun church God moves with purpose he has a plan he has a goal he knows where he's going and he knows what he has to do to get there so he doesn't play around if you see someone playing around with the gifts in their life and saying that it's God that's not God God comes down to edify the body with the gifts that we have he comes down to edify with the skills that we have with the things that we bring and it was no different here God didn't come down to have some fun in the human body just to see what it was like but he came down with purpose so that and that suffering in that Temptation in that new experience he would achieve something that he was supposed to achieve all along the prophet of God says love moved a mighty God God so loved the world the unlovable till he calmed down and made himself flash here on Earth and dwelt among men to what be spit upon mistreated laughed at made fun of and to redeem us back what are we to do tonight take our places by the side of the Cross and say here I stand Lord I come I come wash all my sins away take my malice take my difference away from me Let Me Love You Lord with a pure fervent love that all these little old things will pass away we preach a gospel a gospel of good news and so often what the world says is that good news is my sins are gone but the prophet rightly focuses here and he says it's not just that your sins are gone he says the gospel is my sinful nature is gone that is what he is he's allowed me to die and renew me in life by the holy spirit so that now I am like he is he says what take away my differences my malice and let me love you that takes the what the spirit of God inside of you to do that amen you've got to be able to die and come back again the good news is that you have died in somebody else's living inside of you it's not just that you're sinless that he took away your sin but that he now takes you someplace where you can do something with that sinlessness amen that you can be a purpose to God Amen we're born wrong and because we're born wrong we live wrong and so because we live wrong we have to die and be born Anew and you can only do that by the Holy Ghost amen we're speaking of a condescending God and I want to focus on that condescending because God didn't just condescend in a way that he could have because we looked through time and we saw what he came down in a pillar of fire and he condescended to talk to Moses but that that didn't require anything special of God God can slip into any form he wants God can slip into an Angelic form he can step into because he what he did it time and time again he can look like a man he did it as Melchizedek he did it as one of the Three Angels that walked up to Abraham on the plains of mamry before they went to to Sodom and Gomorrah right it can be a pillar of fire he can be all these things but that's not God condescending because he doesn't have to lower himself to do it he doesn't have to take himself out of that that that that perfect way that he is but when he came down this time he had to lower himself because he had to step into a body that could potentially taste sin that could feel the bad things because you can't hurt God in the sense that you can hurt a human you can't offend God in the way that you can offend offend us because God is righteous and so we even the scripture they it attributes characteristics to God of anger and love and these different things but he's Bound by the word and really what he is is he's he he's reacting by the word to situations so his his anger is not like our anger and neither is his love like our love because we'll see his love that'll that'll beat you just as hard as it'll hug you and these different things so God's attributes in in a non-condescending form are not like what he had when he came down in Christ amen amen he came completely differently because it was with a different purpose the prophet of God would say this and show us the father he says oh Christ the lovely one the darling of God's bosom coming down from the ivory palaces of Heaven clothed in the form of sinful flesh he humiliated himself born in a barn in a stable why Lord why because Lambs are not born in houses Lambs are born in Barns and they let him away to Calvary like a sheep to the slaughter they led him like Abel LED his lamb they led him away humiliated looking back seeing the people and them gambling spitting on him his face full of mockery spit but he was willing to Bear it all that we could be saved and then we pour alienated Gentiles carried away with dumb Idols in the lusts of the world living here in this day just before his coming and then he says we're ashamed to take our way with the Lord's despised God if there be a sinner man or woman here tonight who's never been born again may they be ashamed of the way they've treated you now you say brother John that's not me well here's what he says it is carry more for the things of this world than they do for you turning a cold shoulder to Christ anything you put before him is turning a cold shoulder to Christ whether it's money whether it's friendships whether it's your looks whether it's your career your education whatever it might be we can turn a cold shoulder to Christ amen we've been preaching on Redemption but I want you to catch what he did when he came down in this body of Flesh because he didn't make it easy on himself right when Christ came down he was not born knowing all things having all things Victorious over all things he had to grow and mature and God wanted an authentic experience amen he had to go through everything that you and I do amen it had to be authentic so he didn't give himself a superpower in and of itself he gave him a body that could make the same choice that Adam and Eve could have made that's how he came down and he came into a body that had no sin in it but that doesn't mean it could not sin he had to choose every day not to sin not to disbelieve not to step outside of the word of God every day of his life Christ had to make that decision amen but his very entrance into the world the very way he came in was humiliating it was unconventional it was poor it was dirty it was stinky it was cold his very entrance ought to give us a comfort to tell him about the things we're dealing with in life that we ought not to be ashamed of how we are because listen we come into this world and we didn't choose how we came into it we didn't choose our genetics we didn't choose our family traditions we didn't choose our church we didn't choose our ministry we didn't choose where we were born in terms of the geography and guess what that leads to things in our life doesn't it not all of us have a great name none of us all of us have a great family heritage not all of us are good looking not all of us are well built not all of us make a lot of money not all of us have big homes not all of us have homes to call our own but he came and he had nothing they didn't even have room for him in the hotel and he was born with the animals among the stink of the livestock why so that we would not be ashamed to come to him when we don't have anything either amen that he could under that we could go and say you know what it's like to be like I am today Lord and he'd say I've been there child I was born there and I stayed there my entire life he never Rose to Great Heights he never got a big all the Applause of people he had his moments usually around food when he did the mistake when he did he did the Miracles and he provided this and that and the other thing but as soon as it came down to the where the rubber meets the road where the word comes then they all turned their back so many times to the end where they killed him amen God came on a way that ought to let us know that we don't have to fear to tell him whatever it is we're dealing with in life to be honest with him it meant to say Lord I'm struggling Lord I'm feeling left out Lord I'm feeling isolated Lord I'm feeling rejected Lord I'm feeling poor because he can identify with that because he had an authentic Human Experience when he came down amen he knows what it is to be an outcast he spent most of his life as an outcast he was a bastard to most people they thought he was born illegitimately that's the way he spent his life and guess what in those days you couldn't come into the temple that way you are supposed to even be allowed to worship he was Outcast he was poor he was ragged he didn't have a good name he came from a bad town with a bad reputation he had a bad reputation in a town with a bad reputation that's how bad it was for Christ amen why did he have such a hard start to life and why was his life so difficult Paul talks about it in Hebrews he says in Hebrews 4 14. seeing then that we have a high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tested like as we are yet without sin let us therefore what come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy you don't need Mercy if you haven't done anything wrong Church you don't need Mercy if you're perfect so this scripture in verse 16 is for those that are imperfect for those that need Grace for those that need Mercy for those that need Deliverance for those that need healing and to come in and say that Lord I know that you know what I feel like Lord I know that you know what it's like to be in this condition to know at least the the struggle of the choice if not the condition amen he says that we may obtain obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need it gave him insight as he was going through life God can't have that Rush of adrenaline when some kid comes over and calls you a bastard and calls your mother a that's what they would have called his mother that's what they would have called him tried to pick fights and and to feel that that flush of shame but then the rage that while your body wants to reach out and strike that person for doing it he knew what that felt like to be angry he knew what it was to be unjustly accused amen he knew what rejection feels like and he knew what I felt to feel shame even when you weren't supposed to feel shame because they were wrong and you were right he felt all these things he because why he was in a body that can't control its emotions that can't control the hormones that surge through your body he know what it was like to be a young man that starts to notice what young women for the first time and all the Temptation that comes with that he knows what it's like to try and maybe joke or tease somebody that shouldn't be teased because the other boys or the other kids are doing it all of those Temptations were there for him amen but it wasn't just so he could understand us and I want you to catch this amen this is a key to this whole this whole service I believe it wasn't just so he could understand us but it's so that he could do something about it that he would know how to work with us that he would know how to deal with us that would give him maybe a greater grace and patience and mercy than he had before prophet of God says brother when I see God the god of Heaven forfeited his throne his Beauty all that he was to be born on top of him in your pile be wrapped in swaddling claws to be made fun of by his signs and his wonders be called the devil should I be ashamed of him no sir let the classic world do what they want to do to me he's a super sign the Holy Ghost In Me screams out it might make me act funny and be a crazy man by this world but I cannot deny him who has done so much for me he took my place in death he took my place at Calvary he done all these things but listen to this he said he condescended from heaven from the pearly white Thrones to become a man to taste my suffering to go through my Temptation why brother John to know how to be the right kind of mediator in me to lead me and to guide me to eternal life and through his poverty I am made Rich through his death I'm given life eternal life don't deny him don't be ashamed of him he says don't be ashamed of him again but Embrace him and say yes my dear Lord give to me like they did on the day of Pentecost Lord give to me the Holy Ghost pour it into my heart art I don't care what the teenagers say I don't care what the world says I'm not looking to them I'm looking to you what is it joining Church saying you believe the message no he says the super sign Emmanuel God With Us oh he says there to know how to be the right kind of mediator in me to lead me and guide me to her eternal life catch that church we know he's our mediator and we know that it's his blood that's on the mercy seat and when the judge looks down at us then he says what look at the blood look at the sacrifice and he's mediating for us and he's saying look at me don't look at them look at me look at me amen amen but the prophet you know the scripture says in first Timothy 2 for there is one God one mediator between man God and Men the man Jesus Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time for the prophet of God he takes it a step deeper than this it's not just that he's mediating for you but he says no he says he has to know how to be the right of the kind of mediator mediator in me to lead and guide me to eternal life why a mediator in you because the mediator in you says I understand what you're feeling I understand what you're going through I understand what it feels like to be where you're at today he understands it amen can I speak personally this evening as a father as a husband as a minister so many times we're giving direction we're telling people what to do we're telling people how to do it and we're speaking hopefully out of the word of God when we do it and sometimes we declare what is right and wrong we ought to his husbands as fathers we ought to be leading our houses that way and as a minister I better be leading by the word of God but you know what makes it easy for people to hear it is when I can come in and I can say I've been where you are I've experienced that pain I've experienced that hurt I've experienced rejection I've experienced 10 cents in the bank account I've experienced people looking at me funny I've experienced the the the the chains of lust I've experienced what it feels like to have people turn their back on you I know what you're going through but then I can say what but I got out of it and you can too if you do the same thing I did I can mediate with them I can work with them and then they can see so brother John you know what I'm talking about yes I do brother yes I do sister I've been there I've been there I've done that I know how it hurts I know the shame you feel amen I know how difficult it is but then I say but you can get out because the mediator won't leave you where you're at he'll take you to where you can be to where you ought to be and that's why the mediator has to be in you is he understands and you can say Lord do you understand he says child I understand but don't stay there I'm here to take you past that and he's saying have mercy while I work with him have mercy while I work with her look at me until I get them to a place where they can look just like me hey man what he became me so that I could become him and the mediator is taking you to where he was to where he is amen he's bringing you to that place amen there's a provided way amen I'm not just identifying with you that's not what you want but you want somebody that can take you past it amen I believe that's why a pastor can't be a novice because they have to experience the faults and the failures of humanity in themselves they have to understand what it means to battle and to fight and to know the shame that comes when you don't quite make it but then what because otherwise all they do is they preach victories they've never had in their life and that's no good for the people but when they say Brothers I've dealt with that and God has delivered with me sisters I know what you're going through I've worked with my wife through it and maybe I've worked through it myself in some cases the things that our sisters go through what is it it allows them to say so you're not preaching at me Brother John you're working with me you know where I'm at brother Gerald you know where we're at amen yes I believe that's why we can't sit up here and try and pretend we're perfect it'll never work it never engages the people in the same way because they think that we're above it all and guess what we're not I put my pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else and I deal with the same things that every man in here does we have the same imperfect family and the same and perfect spouses and the same imperfect children and the same and perfect jobs and the ups and downs of life and all these things like everybody else does but we're here to show you that God can deliver that God can lead that God can provide that God can do whatever it is that his word says he's supposed to be doing in your life amen amen what is it God didn't just condescend to feel your pain and your hurt and your rejection but he came down and he lived what you're living and he rose above it to show you that you can do the very same thing if if you get the same life in you that he had amen what it is the scripture says that what he was tempted without like as we were it's right here he says we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities in other words it's not wrong to go to God and say God this is how I feel it's not wrong to go and say God I feel angry at that brother I feel angry at that sister Lord I feel hate Lord I'm just plain annoyed and I don't want to be around them guess what Jesus was around a lot of people he didn't want to be around with if he had to make the choice but what he willingly put himself there anyways because their need was was something that he could meet if they'd only let him amen but what he got the victory he says but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin you say brother he didn't do it the scripture says everything you've gone through he went through it and he felt it and he knew what it was like and yet in all those things he got the victory that's what it means without sin was mean he got the victory didn't mean he didn't have a fight it means he got the victory amen and you say well of course he did Brother John he was God in flesh amen exactly that's the Revelation you need out of all of this God in flesh is what's going to take you through this amen it's not going to be you it's going to be God in flesh you've got to be in Christ and Christ has to be in you and then you can in all points be tempted and come through Victorious maybe not on the first try maybe not on the second try but you'll be victorious because it's only to the Overcomer that the gift is given at the end it's only to the the Overcomer that the throne is given in the end you have to overcome therefore he's going to make sure you've got the victory that you need amen if you get the same thing he did amen you say he had it easier than I do he came down in a special body and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in the he had the Holy Spirit without measure he didn't have the battle I have guess what the scripture says different scripture says different in Hebrews 5. says so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but that he said unto him Thou Art my son today have I begotten thee as he saith also in another place thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered he learned obedience how by suffering Jesus Christ wasn't born knowing all things he wasn't born Victorious over all things he wasn't born above all things he was born below all things and he had to rise above it what by obeying the word of God from his very youth amen he wasn't the scripture says and we'll get to it he was not a ready-made savior when he was born he had to become a savior he had to become the anointed one he didn't start out ready he finished ready he was brought to a place he had to grow he had to mature he had to be tempted he had to be tried he had to be tested he had to go through battles he had to get the victory the exact same way that you and I do and guess what his battles were way tougher than what we have to deal with because every gun that Satan has was focused on that one man listen he's got to spread out here but Jesus had every single gun trained on him that hell could train on him amen listen Jesus had to find himself in the word he had to come to a revelation of who he was the amazing thing was he had it by the age of 12. but he still had to come to it he still had to come to it amen he had to come to a place where he was by not just Revelation but by experience what the word said he was and then when he got there now he could do the work that his father had set out for him brother Bob says this he says you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect made perfect by the things which he suffered he reads Hebrews 5 there where we just did he says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection you know what that tells me he took the exact same path that you and I are going through he didn't say just do it he said I've done it and now you follow in my path and you do the exact same thing why did he want this James 1 2-4 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith Works patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so God condescended into a body of Flesh to show us the way back and Jesus was not exempt from the path that we are forced to walk that's what we just read there amen his character was molded it was shaped it was proven by the things that it was that he suffered now you say brother John he was perfect so how could he be molded but remember what the prophet of God said character is what a victory so your character is molded by what trials in which you get the victory so his Perfection had to be proven and it had to be tried and had to be tested and if characters have is a victory then that means there had to have been a battle that means there had to been a test that means there had to be a child and I don't know about you but I've never been in a trial or a test that was easy so his character had to be proven because God put before him time and time again trials and tests and Satan of course certainly did it as well and he put all of those things there and his character was proven by the things that he suffered guess what don't think Satan gave up after the 40 days in the desert after that every gun was trained on him and now it was influence and that was the the opinions of people and now it was the hard work that he had to do and it was disciples leaving him and all these different things people that said they believed and then all of a sudden they didn't believe and left him and this one and that one amen what is it character is proof that God has finished the work in you in an area because for us we don't have character everywhere one time do we but God's Building us up bit by bit by bit by bit so that what when we get to the fine tip of the spear everything is well supported beneath it so when the decision comes the final decision comes you make the right one and you step into Glory Jesus learned obedience by suffering through the test of his character if I could flip it around I would say Jesus learned that obedience always includes suffering if you do it according to the word of God Amen why because what God wants to prove that the words that you have are not just stuck on your tongue but they're inscribed in your heart amen that they can't be Stamped Out they can't be rubbed away with an eraser of influence or or shame or or somebody trying to put you down but that they're engraved in there and they won't go out and that you'll always stick to what the word says in that situation amen the prophet continues he says in his own personal life contending with himself speaking of Christ contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God and then he reads the scripture we just read he says what was he obedient to the word of God prophet of God says Jesus had to contend with himself you say what did he have to contend with he was perfect he was Christ he was the anointed one but remember you say he had what he had flaws cracks in his armors no but he was in a human body that could be tempted so he had to contend with the things you do he had to contend with emotions he had to contend with hormones he had to contend with being tired and be disappointed in people and being shamed and being rejected and all these things he had to contend with the body that he was in wanting to do what yours and mine does every single day that's what he was dealing with amen he didn't have an easy Road and he was a target for every devil that was out there so he's contending with a body that had to make a choice every single time because that's all Adam and Eve had to do make a choice and he was in that body that's why that's why the scripture calls him the second Adam was because he went down and he came into a body just like Adam and he overcame where Adam fell but he had to make the same choices and we'll get into it in the morning moment first Peter 2 says for even here unto where you called because Christ also suffered for us what leaving an example that you should follow in his steps that you would go the exact same way he did and have the exact same results that he had as well who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth that means there was no deception no hypocrisy and no craftiness listen this is the example that we're supposed to follow now who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously if we could do that when we're getting reviled when we're getting judged when things are misspoken about us when things are put out of context what that we could commit ourselves and say God you take care of it I'm just going to keep walking said who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed so in all of that testing Christ was obedient to the word of God and he came through Victorious and that's why God said there on Mount Transfiguration he says what this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye him he had passed every test and that's where he stepped into what the fullness and that's where he said all that's what all power in Heaven and Earth is given to him potentially it was right there because God said you did the job you've met you have the seal of approval you're good to go Hebrews 5 and verse 9 says I'm being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that today that obey him so he was born and he was built to bring Salvation but he was not there when he was born you and I are in the same boat you're born to go in a Rapture you're born to be resurrected you're born to be the word for your day but you're not born that way you gotta have a new birth that lets you start the way he started and then you got to have the same spirit inside of you that he did that'll give you the same victory that he did so that you can what be made for perfect and become the bride of Christ it's the same path it's the exact same thing being made perfect the proper word there in the original language means to be completed to bring to the goal or purpose so he was brought to completion he became a finished work he became a finished work the scriptures then says he became the author of Salvation when when he was made perfect when he became a completed work amen he still had to come to the place where he was what the word said he would be that was growth that was maturity that was testing that was trying and then he finally stepped right into it amen and all the way up to Gethsemane he had to fight his entire life he had to make the right decisions time and time and time again all the way up to Gethsemane amen you had to fight the inclinations of the body to do what self-preserve to lean to pleasure to lead to lean to ease of life to fund the good times to doing what the crowd wants rather than what the word says every day of his life was filled with controversy because he had the word and then he had just about everybody else saying don't do it and every influence that was out there from the spiritual side from the ministry side from the people every one of them or bending it you can be the Messiah Jesus but take the Romans out be a different Messiah than the word says you're supposed to be constantly all the time he was in a battle Philippians 2 says this let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man what did he do he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Christ of the Cross so catch us he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross why is humbly needed if he's already perfect why is obedience needed if he doesn't have another preference of opinion or opinion listen it's not wrong to have a preference or opinion scripture doesn't say you're not allowed to prefer not to take the harder Road right it's not wrong to say Lord I'd really rather not go this route as Christ said the very same thing amen listen Christ never said the Christian life was easy you might go that scripture it says my yoke is easy and his burden is light but he says to the disciples I'm sending you out as sheeps Among Wolves right every gun in hell is turned on you people are going to reject you they're going to kill you they're going to betray you all these different things and it hasn't ended today it's still there even amongst family even amongst message Believers at times amen there are guns trained on you every day of your life why did he have to Humble himself if there wasn't something that would resist that and there was something that was resisted his will was let this cup Pastor me his preference not his will his preference was he says if it's possible Lord let this cup pass for me don't make me go by way of the cross don't make me go this agonizing death don't let me be naked in front of all these people don't let me go through the most horrible death a man has ever experienced don't let me do it but then he said what not my will but thine be done and we've got to do the same thing we can say Lord I'd really prefer not to go this route but we still got to walk the way he says to walk if he says to walk it amen listen Christ he believed the word of God and he believed the word of God Scripture says here till what he became obedient to death his obedience took him all the way down into hell past death into hell and then back up in newness of life and all the way back up to heaven where he came from in the first place and we've got to believe the exact same way we've got to believe the exact same way we've got to believe unto a dying of ourselves of everything that we have of everything we provided of every skill of every gift we have and we've got to be able to lay it down and say Lord I'm going to trust you to bring me up in newness of life that you that that as the word says I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor a seed begging bread that he would he would give it to us pressed down shaken together until it's pouring out that he would give us family that he would give us houses that he would give us Fellowship that he would give us food in due season all of those things but we've got to be willing like Jesus to become obedient to dying out to everything else that could be self-fulfilling that could provide for our own selves prophet of God says and no one will ever know what agapo love meant to stoop down and to condescend to the lowest pits of the lowest hell to bring the Fallen creature from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity he says we could not express it we can't even understand what that was he said God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a Kinsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are is that right the blood cells were developed by God and the flesh cells were developed in the womb of Mary that brought forth the child and God came down and lived in human flesh and was tempted in every manner just like we are do you believe that he says all right he says now then when he did that he freely gave his blood he didn't have to do it he made that sacrifice he would say in the message desperations our dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's greatest Battleground Gethsemane he cried out in despair here's the question should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on Earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done he humbled himself to the word the promised word of the god of Heaven notice then he went a little further and if he went a little further how much more are we to go a little further see you notice the scripture says here in Luke that he prayed earnestly brother sister if Jesus had to pray honestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more we Sinners saved by grace pray earnestly if the decision throw the Son of God into despair what will it do to you and I desperately we must cry God in these last days has manifested himself so To Us by his Great Signs and power should make us desperate that's right and he's where and his willing to heal us and save us ought to throw us all into desperation to get to that healing stone he said what desperately we must cry out what that it should pass no what that we would find and accept the will of God in our life and that as we will believe the word he's given us for our day and time and make it happen in our own lives in these own bodies in the sinful flesh amen that we would take a hold of the word of God he's talking there about God in signs and wonders where in his ministry a first fruit a a wave offering before us and he's saying you ought to be in a desperation to have the same reality of God in your life that's been demonstrated before you here tonight that you would have the same sincerity that you would have the same commitment that you would have the the same Focus that you would have your life cleaned out so that God can use you in a way like he was using that man there'll never be another William Branham on this Earth We're not looking for that that was a son of man revealing the son of man he said that was a special Ministry but God's looking to use you as purely as he did with William Branham that he could lead us that he could guide us that he could take us to a path to a Rapture amen why so that when the decision is tough the toughness doesn't hold us back from taking what the word of God says we ought to do amen he says oh God project your love to the lost tonight let them know what you did when you came here to the Earth and died in their stead was made ugly and made death for them God made death The Immortal God humbled himself in the womb of a woman to become death and sin to take our ugliness and guiltiness away from us oh it's too much for My Heart Lord I just can't understand it why did you do it why Church why did he do it we've been covering it to redeem you but not to redeem you back to stuff not to bring you back to a worldly Kingdom but to redeem you back to fellowship with him and the blessings that come with Fellowship so often we're looking for the blessings but not the fellowship the blessings are in the fellowship that's really where you need it in his presence that's where I am loved that's where I have peace and joy and rest amen that's what we want is the fruit of the Holy Spirit that's the fruit that doesn't pass away prophet of God goes into into a very long quote here but he kind of takes this whole sermon and he condenses it down into about eight paragraphs and I just want to read them as we start to close this evening he said God came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the Holy Ghost and in that virgin room a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built a tabernacle for the purpose of death you talk about a condescending God he didn't even know what death was and he built something to experience something that a God is never supposed to experience woman came in order that he will be bruised to bring us our Salvation when the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of Our Lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of God that is who Jesus is and that Holy One was filled with Holy Blood even the blood of God that Tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went to Jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of John in the river called Jordan when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water God came and indwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the Christ as his savior he says oh how striking it is listen to this now Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your Everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals who have evolved their own Theology and denied the truth of God Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking Barn this is the condescending God now they think we have a right to be proud holding up our nose noses criticizing and acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen I'll give you a sign say God not the sign of a white-collar priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you will want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign and it is the greatest sign of whole of all listen now Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the Hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah dying now catch this last bit Jehovah praying and nothing happening and then Jehovah died amen the condescending God couldn't even have a prayer answered at the end died a sinful man he died screaming out to the father that had forsaken him and then he died condescending God amen that is the sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one then Darkness Came Upon the Earth they put him in a tomb there he lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high now listen here then Jehovah returned to indwell his church Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people what is it the condescending God and again Jehovah heals the sick raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came down and he raised The Prostitute to sin no more he came down to the druckard with blowflies on his face as he lays unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory yes Jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raise them up at the last day Hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them for they are the Lambs and they follow him wherever he goes amen he didn't just condescend in Bethlehem in a Manger but he condescended to dwell in sinful flesh again on the day of Pentecost and the prophet of God says and he is never going to leave her again that he stays there and he heals the sick and he delivers the bound and he opens prison doors and he makes us into what he says we would be amen it's amazing what he's done Church it's amazing what he did he condescended so that he could identify with us but so that he could take us out of it as well and he proved it could be done because he did it and listen he's not holding back to make sure that we aren't held back either he's gone what he's come down and he's manifested in flesh again so that you can have the same victory that you can overcome as he did why because you get the same result he did you get the same reward you get to sit in the throne with him that's how you know your path is the same as his it's because you get the same reward he gets because what's by his spirit you're going to have the exact same effect amen he's not he's not asleep he's not ignorant of what's going on he's not laying down he's not taking a break he's not watching the hockey game though it seems like it sometimes seems nothing's happening but the word is always working it's always working amen it's it's bread on the water and it won't come back without performing that which it was sent out to do I want to share one final quote and let's stand together if we would and so quote brother Branham shares and he's talking about the children of Israel and they're in the desert they're going around and around in the desert and God keeps showing them mercy and grace and mercy and Grace and they get themselves into trouble and more trouble and more trouble and they got to the place where their trouble was death but they were dying and he says now we find them after this time murmuring again weakened in faith after God had showed Mercy on them it amazes me sometimes the the the the supernatural that God showed to the children of Israel listen they went 40 years in the desert and the clothes never wore out the food never went away the shoes were as good as gold all the way through they have food every day they had a pillar of Fire by night they had a cloud by day God was constantly they had a daily Supernatural event in their life just with the manna and yet they kept turning their back on God and disbelieving him he says weakened in faith after God had showed Mercy them and we find them murmuring with God and when they did they were dying with snake bites well they deserved it they certainly did anybody that would mistake God's word and do these things that they did they deserved to die we deserve to die when we disbelieve every one of them desired and deserved to die in the wilderness but when they were so sick that even Dr Moses and none of them could do anything about it and they were dying by the thousands but God rich in Mercy he made a way of Escape for those who would believe him catch this next bit he says he made an antidote for it by setting up a brass serpent God made a way of Escape so his believing children could be healed he says God is interested in everything that's wrong everything that you participate in every Walk of Life God is interested in you you are his child and he is rich in Mercy he wants to do it for you amen reminds me of Joel 2 28 where he says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh you can be black you can be white you can be brown you
