[35:43] can have confidence in him
[35:45] let's sing let the book live in me 1:29
[35:53] that's what we want tonight as we want
[35:55] to vote the word to live in us everyone
[35:58] of course we want to become one with
[35:59] that word
[36:00] so let's sing that tonight
[36:06] [Music]
[36:31] [Applause]
[36:40] [Music]

[36:52] [Music]

[40:14] [Applause]
[40:14] [Music]
[40:17] [Applause]
[40:19] [Music]
[40:23] that's the thing more than anything else
[40:26] that we want is that we want his word to
[40:28] be living in our lives you know so much
[40:33] that's become my passion more and more
[40:36] as that you know we they have a lot of
[40:38] information that lives in us and we have
[40:40] you know a lot of times we call that
[40:42] information revelation because you know
[40:45] it's spiritual and it's you know it it's
[40:48] complicated maybe to us but but real
[40:51] revelation isn't just knowledge it isn't
[40:54] just information and we say well that
[40:55] was very interesting and you know I just
[40:57] feel like I understand God better but
[41:00] when it under when we really understand
[41:01] God God better as when it lives inside
[41:04] of us and it's become a part of us and
[41:07] nobody's ever accused me of being a deep
[41:09] preacher and come scratching their head
[41:11] after service man what what were you
[41:14] talking about I really am Not sure I
[41:15] mean there was way too many symbols and
[41:18] types and Greek words and all that
[41:19] that's not my ministry at all but what I
[41:22] what I hope it is is thought-provoking
[41:25] and heart provoking in the sense that we
[41:28] look at our lives a lot of times and
[41:29] human beings do not like to be told that
[41:32] we've got anything wrong we don't like
[41:34] to be told that you know maybe our lives
[41:37] are lacking in any way and so you know
[41:39] what I what I have on my heart a lot of
[41:42] times is just to come at it from a
[41:43] different angle and just say you know
[41:45] are we really capturing that or we
[41:47] really you know are we really in tune
[41:49] are we really in sync because a lot of
[41:50] times it's not a complete teardown of
[41:52] our lives that we need but it's it's
[41:54] just kind of a renewal or it's you know
[41:56] it's a different focus a different
[41:58] challenge and just say yeah I know this
[42:00] stuff like like Peter said you know
[42:02] we're really here to call to remember
[42:04] and stir up your pure pure minds but to
[42:06] just help us recognize hey there's
[42:08] little areas all the time where the
[42:10] devil tries to get us to compromise and
[42:12] when we compromise we find very quickly
[42:14] at the power of God just kind of get
[42:15] zapped from our lives and then we come
[42:17] and say oh man you know I'm still coming
[42:20] to church I'm still doing all the things
[42:21] I supposed to be doing but I'm not
[42:22] really having victory anymore and and I
[42:24] believe the Bride of Christ should be
[42:25] victorious and powerful and that we're
[42:28] not going to be scraping into the
[42:29] rapture just like oh I can't believe I
[42:32] made it like this is this is amazing I
[42:34] you know it's like
[42:35] when the lottery I actually got got here
[42:37] you know well had a one-in-a-billion
[42:38] chance of making it and somehow I got
[42:40] here but I think that the bride will go
[42:42] in having confidence that she's gonna
[42:44] make it having confidence that you know
[42:46] that that promise is for her and that
[42:48] not just like oh I hope I make the
[42:50] rapture but I know that the rapture
[42:51] can't even go because I'm not ready yet
[42:54] and I'm gonna be there so you know trust
[42:56] that as we get ready we you know we we
[42:59] realized that on one hand it's not up to
[43:02] us you know it takes God's Spirit to
[43:05] lead us and to guide us on every step of
[43:07] the way
[43:07] but on the other hand it is up to us
[43:09] because the scripture says that the wife
[43:11] has made herself ready you know it's not
[43:13] a time of doing nothing and so I trust
[43:16] tonight we will see that that that's you
[43:18] know as much as we've grown and we've
[43:20] come to a place with God God never wants
[43:22] us to get satisfied with that and he
[43:24] never wants us to get comfortable with
[43:26] that to the point that we say you know
[43:28] what this is good I'm just in a good
[43:30] place to sit back and wait until you
[43:32] know the rest of things unfold but
[43:34] there's still more land as as Joshua
[43:36] told our children Israel there's still
[43:37] much land to be possessed and I believe
[43:39] right till that you know right till we
[43:41] cross over we're still gonna say you
[43:43] know that rapture morning we're gonna
[43:45] say I still want to be closer to the
[43:47] Lord I still want to you know I want to
[43:49] take another step another step I don't
[43:50] know if you guys sing this song you know
[43:51] one day I want to take a step towards my
[43:52] theophany but you know it's a constant
[43:54] progress towards that place that God has
[43:57] for us and it doesn't end because you've
[43:59] been here 20 years or 30 years or
[44:01] doesn't it doesn't matter how long
[44:03] you've been serving the Lord you know we
[44:04] never want to get comfortable and
[44:05] complacent and just stop so thank you so
[44:08] much for your tenth of dish last night
[44:10] and I I hope we all came rested up and
[44:12] ready to go again looking a little tired
[44:14] but know who we're thankful for the
[44:18] brothers and the fellowship that we had
[44:19] this morning and just had a real nice
[44:21] time with brother Adam and Jamie brother
[44:23] out of sister Jamie at their house we
[44:25] appreciate their hospitality and I was
[44:27] thinking about brother Matt back there
[44:29] tonight and I thought you know he does
[44:30] such a good job and shout out to the
[44:32] sound guy because having been there it's
[44:34] a little bit of underappreciated job
[44:36] sometimes he does a real good job
[44:38] juggling the video and everything so god
[44:41] bless you brother man hey man let's bow
[44:44] our heads Lord Jesus father we're here
[44:46] tonight
[44:48] you know what you have in store for us
[44:50] most importantly Lord I've prepared this
[44:53] thought that you put on my hearts and
[44:54] and the people here tonight Lord some
[44:56] knew from last night and and I pray you
[44:58] just help us all to settle in real well
[45:00] Lord and to catch the inspiration here
[45:03] father it's nothing that I can bring but
[45:05] it's what you can bring Lord and we just
[45:08] ask that more than just our ears being
[45:10] filled with words tonight Lord that you
[45:12] would sweep through the building father
[45:14] that your spirit would anoint us and
[45:16] that Lord we'd be able to receive what
[45:19] you're really saying what our situation
[45:20] is though what I I don't know anyone's
[45:22] life here but you know it law it inside
[45:24] out and I pray that there's some
[45:26] encouragement there and there's some
[45:28] motivation father to reach higher than
[45:30] we have before and conquer more than we
[45:33] have before Lord we just commit the
[45:35] service into your hands then we ask you
[45:36] to have your perfect way in Jesus name
[45:41] so this thing will do for now we could
[45:44] turn our Bibles to Romans chapter 8
[45:47] looking at this thought tonight of
[45:49] conquerors and settlers or settlers
[45:53] however you say that I sometimes say
[45:56] both but in this case it's more about
[46:00] settlers people who have settled and
[46:03] then people that have conquered so
[46:05] conquerors and settlers and this is kind
[46:08] of a special service to me the Lord gave
[46:12] me the inspiration for it brother Jerry
[46:13] was preaching one morning back home and
[46:16] you know it really started to come on my
[46:18] mind you know this thought it was you
[46:21] know it's kind of related to what he was
[46:22] preaching but I climb for myself
[46:24] sometimes just being in the spirit of
[46:25] services when I get inspired for for
[46:27] services and and I and I really start to
[46:30] think about this like you know
[46:31] conquerors and settlers and I believe in
[46:34] the in the message there's a lot more
[46:35] settlers and there are conquerors and I
[46:37] started to think about the thought in in
[46:39] my heart just like Emma do I am I really
[46:41] willing to be a conqueror am i really
[46:43] willing to keep pressing and pressing
[46:45] and pressing and you know that service
[46:47] was the last day before I went to the
[46:50] doctor and ended up finding out about
[46:52] cancer and everything else so it's a
[46:54] special service to me because it's like
[46:56] the Lord pushed me to a point say are
[46:57] you ready to go and conquer are you
[47:00] ready to keep doing this
[47:01] are you happy with where you're at you
[47:03] know are you are you happy with what
[47:05] you've achieved are you happy with the a
[47:06] little space you've carved out or you
[47:08] want to keep going in it I trust by
[47:10] God's grace your answer be the same in
[47:11] mine I want to keep going all the way
[47:14] you know it not not to stop anywhere
[47:16] else not be satisfied anywhere else and
[47:18] so we we actually ended up the service
[47:20] on this scripture last night but Paul
[47:22] says in Romans 8:35 he says who shall
[47:24] separate us from the love of Christ
[47:27] shall tribulation or distress or
[47:31] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[47:34] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[47:37] sake we are killed all the day long we
[47:39] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[47:41] nay in all these things we are more than
[47:44] conquerors through him that loved us for
[47:48] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[47:51] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[47:55] powers nor things present nor things to
[47:57] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[47:59] creature shall be able to separate us
[48:01] from the love of God which is in Christ
[48:04] Jesus our Lord you know having read that
[48:09] it seems like there is not an enemy
[48:12] around that can stop you and that's the
[48:15] truth but except for one enemy and
[48:19] brother BAM told us this is our greatest
[48:21] enemy you know it's not the devil even
[48:24] though he's a very worthy adversary
[48:26] you know God handcrafted him to be the
[48:28] best adversary we could have but our
[48:30] greatest enemy is ourselves and so when
[48:33] we think of all of these things you know
[48:35] that that angels can't stop us that you
[48:38] know principalities powers the
[48:40] government can't stop you this one can't
[48:41] stop you this army couldn't stop you you
[48:43] know all of these things no other
[48:45] creature could stop you except yourself
[48:48] you can decide at some point I'm not
[48:52] doing this anymore I I'm happy I'm
[48:54] content and when we do that we hold
[48:56] ourselves back so you know really
[49:00] keeping that in mind if we are if our
[49:02] greatest enemy and if we're the only one
[49:04] that can really hinder God then we need
[49:06] to get ourselves out of the way you know
[49:07] we really need need to get ourselves out
[49:09] of the way and and we think about that
[49:11] for the preacher sometimes like all he
[49:12] needs to get himself all the way
[49:14] we think about that for father some time
[49:17] you may be seated sir and I can keep you
[49:18] standing that's a rookie mistake four
[49:24] hours later be like oh man that's a good
[49:26] service doesn't they how come you guys
[49:27] look so tired
[49:28] goodbye but you know we think of that
[49:34] sometimes that you know this you know
[49:35] brother Bob he's sure better we could
[49:36] come prepared tonight you know I better
[49:37] get himself out of the way and get
[49:39] yielded so that we can sing songs that
[49:40] will you know get us in the right
[49:42] atmosphere you know and the preacher
[49:43] better come ready and you know better
[49:45] get himself separated you know and get
[49:47] aside and get the Lord speaking to him
[49:49] and all those things but really all of
[49:51] that's in vain if each person coming
[49:55] doesn't do the same thing you know
[49:57] brother Brown told us that you know
[49:58] you're most of the gift is the pulling
[50:00] on the word but also you know when we
[50:02] think about that is that what kind of
[50:04] condition we bring our heart into church
[50:06] makes such a big difference of what we
[50:08] get out of it you know I I think about
[50:10] the parable of the sower and and that's
[50:11] one of you know I mentioned last night
[50:13] Jesus parables to me and brother Browns
[50:16] stories some of my favorite things
[50:18] because they're just so rich and
[50:20] detailed but Jesus tells the parable of
[50:22] a sower and he talks about all of these
[50:24] different conditions of ground you know
[50:26] and and it's very easy to say oh you
[50:29] know that that ground by the wayside is
[50:31] this person you know or this type of
[50:33] person this ground with the thorns is
[50:35] this type of person to the ground with
[50:37] the rocks it was this type of person and
[50:39] the good the good ground is this person
[50:41] you know cuz that's always the way that
[50:43] we type the parable but really when you
[50:45] think about it and I thought about you
[50:47] know in our in the western Canada where
[50:49] I live is a lot of farmland well all of
[50:52] that land was land by the wayside at one
[50:54] point and you know a lot of it is really
[50:56] good fertile soil now but it didn't get
[50:58] that way just by happening to be good
[51:01] ground it got that way because someone
[51:03] was willing to cut down all of the trees
[51:06] and pull all the stumps and work up the
[51:08] ground and pick all the rocks and and
[51:10] you know kill all of the weeds and burn
[51:13] all of that stuff up and work it up and
[51:15] get it ready to a place where it could
[51:17] actually take in new seed you know
[51:19] sometimes we come in our lives and and
[51:21] we're good ground but take the take good
[51:23] fertile soil and don't do anything with
[51:25] it for a while
[51:26] and all of those we
[51:27] start to grow in again pretty quickly
[51:29] you know all those thorns and thistles
[51:31] and stuff creepin pretty quick so you
[51:33] know we we never want to you know type
[51:34] ourselves and say oh man you know we're
[51:36] we're the bad ground you know where the
[51:38] we're the weedy rocky horrible ground
[51:41] but we do need to realize that it takes
[51:43] effort and it takes work to keep that
[51:46] ground good you know it takes it takes
[51:48] sometimes getting stirred up before we
[51:50] come to service it takes sometimes
[51:51] examining our lives at home and saying
[51:53] what what's growing here you know oh I
[51:55] was expecting to get a good wheat crop
[51:57] and yet there seems to be some fizzles
[51:58] here you know where do we pull those up
[52:00] and and really you know I believe that a
[52:02] Christian life is always in flow because
[52:05] the devil never stops to try and God
[52:07] never stops moving so you know it's
[52:09] never a place where we just stop and
[52:11] stay there but we want to keep moving
[52:14] and so no matter what our situation no
[52:17] matter what difficulty we find ourselves
[52:18] in you know it we need to realize that
[52:22] whatever those trials are God has an end
[52:25] for us that includes victory you know
[52:28] there's there's not a trial that he that
[52:29] he can allow in our lives to prevent us
[52:31] you know in God's God's point is not to
[52:33] give us the trial so that you will
[52:35] prevent us it's to give us a trial so we
[52:37] can overcome with so we can come out on
[52:39] the other side stronger with greater
[52:40] faith greater confidence in him you know
[52:42] greater trust and all of those things so
[52:44] this thought tonight conquerors and
[52:46] settlers is really about that what
[52:48] category do you find yourself in and if
[52:50] you find yourself in the wrong category
[52:51] that doesn't mean oh man I guess you're
[52:53] not making it you know you're you're
[52:55] that chicken in the barnyard you're not
[52:56] the you know you're not the eagle or you
[52:58] know you're you're the the one that's
[53:00] missing out no that's not it at all
[53:01] because we all in us have a have a
[53:04] nature that wants to settle it's only
[53:06] the Holy Ghost nature that keeps
[53:08] conquering and concrete so let's deal
[53:11] with the settlers first us get them out
[53:13] of the way and you know there's
[53:15] positives to the to the word settling
[53:17] and I don't want to discount that and
[53:19] mean if you go search the message for
[53:21] the word settle you'd be like what is
[53:23] this brother talking about here tonight
[53:24] because with every time brother branham
[53:26] uses the word settle he almost always
[53:27] use it in a positive way you know that
[53:29] and so there are some positives to the
[53:31] world words settle and just run through
[53:33] some of the dictionary definitions for
[53:35] you tonight you know that it says to a
[53:37] point fix or resolve definitely and
[53:41] conclusively agree upon that sounds good
[53:44] you know it's a place in a desired state
[53:46] or order that's wonderful you want you
[53:48] know your your affairs to be settled you
[53:50] want God to settle you in his kingdom
[53:52] you know that sounds wonderful to pay as
[53:54] a bill to close an account by payment to
[53:56] pay a bill make a financial arrangement
[53:58] you know all of those things are
[54:00] positive definitions you know brother
[54:04] BAM usually talks about our old account
[54:06] was settled you know like the song long
[54:08] ago long ago
[54:09] the old account was settled long ago and
[54:11] so there are very many positive uses of
[54:14] it and and we can do that but I want to
[54:16] show you it in terms of the contrast
[54:18] with conquering because settling and in
[54:21] some of the definitions I read next
[54:22] really come in to tell you that settling
[54:26] can also be used as a real contrast to
[54:28] conquering you know you came in
[54:29] conquering and then you chose to settle
[54:32] and the the fallout of that you know it
[54:35] produces a different kind of situation
[54:37] entirely so some of the other
[54:39] definitions and I didn't add the the
[54:41] context or the examples they were just
[54:43] in the dictionary but to me they kind of
[54:45] capture it so to migrate to and organize
[54:49] like the pilgrims settled Plymouth to
[54:52] arrange matters in a dispute come to an
[54:55] agreement to settle with a person to
[54:58] come to rest as from flight like a bird
[55:01] that's settled on a bow to gather
[55:04] collect or become fixed in a particular
[55:07] place direction etc a cold settled in my
[55:11] head as the example that they use there
[55:13] to settle down to become established in
[55:19] some routine especially upon marrying so
[55:22] here brother Paul sister Kimberly after
[55:24] a period of Independence or indecision
[55:26] that's a really good way of describing a
[55:28] period of Independence or indecision
[55:31] settle for or be satisfied with to
[55:35] settle for less and settle into or
[55:42] become established in to settle into a
[55:45] new routine you know when you think
[55:48] about these contextual examples that it
[55:50] gives here you know you start to see
[55:52] that there might be some things
[55:54] especially
[55:54] you bring it over into the spiritual
[55:56] that are negative with this word settle
[55:58] you know to migrate and to organize that
[56:02] sounds good until you apply it
[56:04] spiritually and you found that anything
[56:06] that organizes dies you know it's
[56:09] wonderful when you're singing the move
[56:10] is on the move is on my lover we're
[56:12] moving and moving and then when we stop
[56:14] and we organize and we get everything
[56:16] settle and you know everything's in
[56:18] place and everybody's happy and and all
[56:20] of that that's when God's Spirit just
[56:22] keeps moving on and that that group
[56:24] starts to die spiritually you know and
[56:26] so as much as it sounds wonderful the
[56:29] end result of that is a stagnant cold
[56:32] church that no longer moves with the
[56:34] Spirit of God to arrange matters in a
[56:37] dispute or come to an agreement you know
[56:39] that sounds wonderful you know it's
[56:41] settled until you think that many people
[56:43] have settled with the devil they've come
[56:46] to an agreement and their agreement is
[56:48] devil
[56:49] you know I want to go to church and I
[56:51] want to do this and I want to do this
[56:52] but the rest of the time I'll give to
[56:54] you or devil I'm willing to go this far
[56:57] but I'm willing to compromise here and
[56:58] I'm willing to compromise there and I'm
[57:00] willing to give you your place and time
[57:01] and and all of that kind of thing
[57:03] they've they've settled with the devil
[57:05] and they have an understanding and
[57:06] because they're not putting too much
[57:08] pressure on him he gives them space to
[57:10] be comfortable you know they come to an
[57:13] agreement I'm willing to go this far and
[57:15] a lot of times that's what what church
[57:18] becomes is that you know as long as the
[57:19] preachers talking about the things that
[57:21] you've been willing to go you know that
[57:23] far then you say oh amen amen I'm with
[57:25] you brother you know I'm right beside
[57:27] you and then the brother goes just a
[57:28] little further and it goes hush quiet
[57:30] because you know I wasn't willing to go
[57:32] that far you know I'm willing to go as
[57:34] far as I've come today and you know a
[57:37] lot of times that's that's the situation
[57:38] it's you know if we were to if we were
[57:40] to talk about the past and what God's
[57:42] brought us through you know all of us
[57:44] can rejoice in that and all of us you
[57:46] know say oh that's wonderful maybe we
[57:47] have so many testimonies we could you
[57:49] know just spend the evening discussing
[57:51] those and sharing those and that'd be
[57:52] wonderful but to talk about do we still
[57:55] have that same kind of passion to keep
[57:58] moving forward because you know I don't
[58:01] know about you but I'm not in a
[58:02] glorified body tonight and I'm not I'm
[58:04] not in a different dimension so there's
[58:06] still somewhere else
[58:07] to go from here you know there's still
[58:09] there's still steps that need to be
[58:11] taken and and we're not gonna get there
[58:13] by you know having an understanding with
[58:15] the devil the only understanding he
[58:16] needs to have is get out of my way
[58:18] because I'm still moving on you know I'm
[58:20] not making any deals here I'm I'm I'm
[58:21] moving on pressing on all the way to the
[58:24] end to come to rest us from flight you
[58:28] know that oh that's wonderful you know
[58:29] we talked about there's a rest for the
[58:31] bride there's a rest but I thought you
[58:33] know and I love the way that I said that
[58:35] as a bird to come you know it settle
[58:38] upon a bow you know we're not supposed
[58:40] to be settled on a bow you know we talk
[58:44] about the the annoying thing that's part
[58:45] of of our age you know it's not II
[58:48] what kind of anointing it is it's an
[58:50] eagle anointing you know and and you
[58:52] know of course a lot of you know
[58:54] pictures or whatever they they show an
[58:56] eagle and perch majestically in a tree
[58:58] and you think that's wonderful but I'm
[59:00] glad that you know the the Bible doesn't
[59:03] tell us that it's just an eagle but it
[59:05] tells us that the anointings are flying
[59:07] you you know it's not a resting angle
[59:09] it's not an eagle that's perched and you
[59:11] know just checking things out just you
[59:13] know it's an eagle that's meant to be up
[59:14] there in the heavenlies soaring on those
[59:17] currents and and you know in motion
[59:19] aloft and alert is not supposed to be
[59:21] resting and sitting down on the ground
[59:22] you know it's supposed to be up there
[59:24] doing something in the heavenly updrafts
[59:26] you know so when we when we think about
[59:28] that you know those those connotations
[59:30] are are just you know they sound good
[59:32] but they're just they're just speaking
[59:34] of something that's different than the
[59:36] Commission we've been given settle down
[59:39] and become routine you know with routine
[59:42] comes some loss of passion routine comes
[59:46] some loss of zeal you know when when you
[59:48] you know when you when you have a
[59:50] routine and say everybody knows okay
[59:52] everybody knows is Monday morning Monday
[59:54] mornings workday cakes I got to be up at
[59:57] this time lunch gonna be made and
[59:59] everything's kids gotta get ready for
[1:00:00] school everything's got to go and
[1:00:01] everybody works according to the routine
[1:00:03] but whether you're excited about work or
[1:00:06] school you're not you can go through the
[1:00:08] routine anyway you know whether it
[1:00:10] brings you any joy at all or at the end
[1:00:12] of the day you're already looking
[1:00:13] forward to the end of the day that
[1:00:15] routine just keeps you going you know
[1:00:17] and church can become such a routine
[1:00:19] serving God can be such a routine
[1:00:21] and we do it like why we going to church
[1:00:23] today death oh you know what Sunday you
[1:00:25] know we're supposed to you know it's
[1:00:26] it's Wednesday we're supposed to you
[1:00:28] know not not because we want to or not
[1:00:30] because you know there's there's a
[1:00:31] passion there anymore but because we
[1:00:33] want you why do we pray for our food
[1:00:34] well because you know we've always
[1:00:35] prayed for our food you know why do we
[1:00:37] you know what do we do this because well
[1:00:39] we've always done that what why don't
[1:00:40] why do we have luck here well you know
[1:00:41] the sisters have always had long hair
[1:00:43] you know it's not supposed to be a
[1:00:44] routine it's supposed to be something
[1:00:47] that's genuine and passionate and and
[1:00:49] that there's a personal reason that
[1:00:51] we've chosen to do that you know that's
[1:00:53] just like the story of the the man who
[1:00:56] marries a wife and and you know every
[1:00:58] time you know she she goes to cook or oh
[1:01:00] she cuts you know one one piece of the
[1:01:02] roast off and sets it in beside the the
[1:01:04] rest of it and you know he asks her like
[1:01:06] why did you do that like my my my mom
[1:01:08] never cooked a roast like that she
[1:01:10] always just put the whole roast in and
[1:01:11] and cooked in it I always turned out
[1:01:13] great she said I don't know my mom
[1:01:14] always did it that way so one day she
[1:01:16] asked her mom why don't we do it that
[1:01:17] way and said well I don't know my mom
[1:01:19] always taught me to do that way so you
[1:01:21] know my mom always did that so you know
[1:01:22] go back and ask grandma and when when
[1:01:24] you go far back enough grandma just
[1:01:25] didn't have a big enough pan for the
[1:01:26] roast so she always cut one part off and
[1:01:29] and stuck it in beside and so you know
[1:01:31] we can do a lot of things because it's
[1:01:34] routine we can do a lot of things
[1:01:36] because somebody did it that way at one
[1:01:38] time you know and you know it's kind of
[1:01:40] funny to me sometimes going to different
[1:01:42] churches and I haven't been to a lot but
[1:01:43] the ones that I've gone to there's so
[1:01:45] many different ways of doing foot
[1:01:46] washing and communion and in so many
[1:01:48] different ways of you know even how the
[1:01:50] service goes and the musicians and
[1:01:52] everything else and I think that is good
[1:01:54] for us to go and get exposure to
[1:01:56] different places sometimes because
[1:01:58] otherwise we think that you know the way
[1:01:59] that we do it is just the right way to
[1:02:01] do everything and you know I've sat in
[1:02:03] the seat of the scornful as they say
[1:02:05] sometimes you know sitting in different
[1:02:06] church like oh why do they do it that
[1:02:07] way that's just you know that's just
[1:02:09] totally wrong and they start thinking
[1:02:10] why is it wrong it's right it's wrong
[1:02:13] because it's a different routine then
[1:02:14] you know then what I'm used to right and
[1:02:16] so we can get in that routine experience
[1:02:18] and we can get that way to the point
[1:02:20] where you know we judge other people
[1:02:22] because they don't fit our routine we
[1:02:23] you know we have a hard time with
[1:02:25] everything else just because it doesn't
[1:02:27] fit our routine that's a very dangerous
[1:02:29] position to be in because God might
[1:02:30] shake things up one day
[1:02:32] and you're like ah what are you doing
[1:02:34] god I have a routine here don't don't
[1:02:36] mess with the routine I just want to you
[1:02:37] know I'm just gonna go with my happy
[1:02:39] little way here God's trying to get our
[1:02:41] attention sometimes you know and so when
[1:02:44] you think about that routine that's
[1:02:47] that's the way a lot of people come to
[1:02:48] Christ they've they've swapped one
[1:02:50] lifestyle for another lifestyle you know
[1:02:53] where they used to they're your routine
[1:02:55] used to take them out partying on
[1:02:56] Saturday unite and instead it takes them
[1:02:59] to church on Sunday morning you know the
[1:03:00] routine used to take them you know
[1:03:02] watching TV in the evening
[1:03:03] now they listen to a message or they
[1:03:05] read their Bible or they have some
[1:03:06] family devotions and they just swapped
[1:03:08] the routine but really they're just
[1:03:10] going through the motions either way so
[1:03:12] you know we don't want that kind of life
[1:03:14] we want a life that's much more vibrant
[1:03:15] than that and then that last definition
[1:03:18] is settle for less or be satisfied with
[1:03:23] your current condition you know and I
[1:03:25] believe that for the church relate Asiya
[1:03:27] that's that's really what the Bible
[1:03:30] speaks about you don't need anything
[1:03:32] they've got already got at all of if
[1:03:33] they're in a place where they don't need
[1:03:34] anything at all including God you don't
[1:03:37] really even need the Lord anymore
[1:03:38] because they've got you know
[1:03:39] everything's established and they got
[1:03:41] all the message books and they got the
[1:03:42] Bible and they got all the resources you
[1:03:44] know so we don't need anything else you
[1:03:47] know and Jesus is on the outside
[1:03:48] knocking it say you know what about me
[1:03:50] you know remember I was the main thing
[1:03:52] that we talked about last night you know
[1:03:53] I'm I'm the one that put all this in
[1:03:55] place and we're saying you know I know
[1:03:56] but you know we're pretty satisfied with
[1:03:58] this you know it's just sad condition to
[1:04:00] be him brother BAM says whenever I'm now
[1:04:03] all of us know that whenever a message
[1:04:05] is given in three years they formal
[1:04:07] organization when they do that it kills
[1:04:10] it right there it did it in the days of
[1:04:13] Luther so it did it in the days of
[1:04:15] Wesley it did in the days of Alexander
[1:04:17] Campbell and all the rest of them and I
[1:04:19] did it in the days of Pentecost exactly
[1:04:21] see you get to a place each one gets
[1:04:24] starchy and gets off and they can't
[1:04:27] receive new revelation they're settled
[1:04:30] down and there they are and there they
[1:04:34] die and the life goes right through that
[1:04:37] goes right on to make the wheat and when
[1:04:40] the wheat comes that life that's
[1:04:41] traveled through that wheat the
[1:04:42] resurrection brings the whole thing out
[1:04:44] brings up for the rapture you know that
[1:04:48] idea that no matter what word fresh word
[1:04:52] I'm a you know you know passion that
[1:04:55] that fresh kill of the word you know
[1:04:57] that the fresh eagle food goes forth and
[1:04:59] for a while people eat that and they
[1:05:02] enjoy it and everything else and then
[1:05:03] they settle down and say you know that's
[1:05:05] that's where I stop
[1:05:06] you know I I've noticed this pattern
[1:05:09] over my life that you know people
[1:05:11] whatever age they they embrace
[1:05:13] technology they kind of just stay at
[1:05:15] that place you know it just as you get
[1:05:18] older you always filter everything
[1:05:19] through what was fresh to you at that
[1:05:22] point you know and I worked in IT for a
[1:05:24] while and you could always tell the
[1:05:26] people that have burned around not just
[1:05:27] because they're great hair you could
[1:05:28] always tell the people have been around
[1:05:29] for a long time because every time they
[1:05:31] would make an example explaining
[1:05:33] something of how to troubleshoot it
[1:05:35] would go back to the days of you know
[1:05:37] floppy disks and you know really old
[1:05:40] technology that wasn't around anymore
[1:05:41] and they would start from there and try
[1:05:44] to add-on because at some point that was
[1:05:46] the limitation of their experience and
[1:05:48] everything new that they're trying to
[1:05:50] figure out is based on that old
[1:05:51] experience and you see that sometimes
[1:05:53] with in the message that you see that
[1:05:56] same kind of thing is that wherever
[1:05:57] somebody came to Christ that fixes their
[1:06:00] their revelation it just kind of sets it
[1:06:02] and now anything that anybody preaches
[1:06:04] guys to grind through the gears you know
[1:06:08] of where the message was at the time
[1:06:09] that they came to Christ instead of you
[1:06:11] know as Paul says you know forgetting
[1:06:13] the things in the past or moving on from
[1:06:15] the first principles it's not that those
[1:06:17] things are bad or they were we're
[1:06:19] actually giving them up but we're
[1:06:20] building onto those you know new
[1:06:22] revelation new understanding and
[1:06:24] realizing that you know even though you
[1:06:26] know the the message that we read in
[1:06:28] that and the things that were the quotes
[1:06:29] that we read are still from you know in
[1:06:31] the 1960s and 1950s that there's still a
[1:06:35] progression in the word there's still a
[1:06:36] growth in the word and so we can't still
[1:06:38] think about things you know in the days
[1:06:40] that they were in the 1960s we have to
[1:06:42] think about things in the way they are
[1:06:43] in 2017 and realize what's God doing
[1:06:46] today and not not keep shifting back oh
[1:06:48] man how does this fit all the way back
[1:06:50] to here but you say yes or no that's
[1:06:52] where I want to be I want to be right
[1:06:53] where everything's moving today
[1:06:56] Israel and the journey from Egypt to me
[1:06:58] is the prime example of people subtly
[1:07:00] you know they had every possible
[1:07:03] opportunity to conquer and to completely
[1:07:05] wipe out all opposition to them and you
[1:07:09] think about you know this this group of
[1:07:11] a couple of million people has brother
[1:07:12] Brown described it you know that had
[1:07:14] supernatural power behind them they had
[1:07:17] prophecy behind them you know all the
[1:07:19] way back to Abraham saying that you know
[1:07:21] you see to a sojourn in a strange land
[1:07:22] and I'll bring them back they had
[1:07:24] motivation behind them because they had
[1:07:26] been in in slavery and in bondage and so
[1:07:29] they had everything to motivate them to
[1:07:31] go out and and just accomplish
[1:07:33] everything that God had for them and yet
[1:07:36] every single opportunity they had they
[1:07:39] chose to settle instead they settled for
[1:07:42] less they settled for the easy way they
[1:07:45] settle for a selfish satisfaction you
[1:07:48] know and we know you know Bubba have
[1:07:49] talked about it that it should have been
[1:07:51] only like a three-week journey from from
[1:07:53] Egypt into the Promised Land you know
[1:07:55] and different scholars have looked and
[1:07:57] seeing you know the difference of the
[1:07:59] distance and how long it should have
[1:08:00] taken there's different estimates and
[1:08:01] all of those things but whatever we know
[1:08:03] we know it shouldn't have taken 40 years
[1:08:05] you know we know that about a year in is
[1:08:08] when they when they you know stood at at
[1:08:10] Kish Barnea waiting to go over and to
[1:08:13] see you know what would kind of be there
[1:08:14] and so it was a very easy thing that
[1:08:17] they should have been there much sooner
[1:08:18] but we find out that every time God
[1:08:22] bring them to a place they didn't say
[1:08:24] like okay how long we stay in here
[1:08:26] because we're ready to keep going into
[1:08:27] the you know towards the promised land
[1:08:28] now every time they came to a place they
[1:08:30] were grouchy every time they came to a
[1:08:32] place they were complaining every time
[1:08:34] they came to a place they found
[1:08:35] something wrong with they instead of
[1:08:38] something right you know those the
[1:08:40] victories that they had that they had
[1:08:42] come through the Red Sea and you know
[1:08:44] they had a great time praising the Lord
[1:08:46] and worshiping and thanking him for you
[1:08:48] know bringing them through and their
[1:08:49] enemies all you know wiped out and
[1:08:51] everything else they're so excited and
[1:08:52] then it's just a few days later well
[1:08:56] where's the water where's the food where
[1:08:57] is this where is that didn't you know in
[1:08:59] every step of the way did you bring us
[1:09:01] here to die did you bring us here to die
[1:09:03] you know what more to God have to do for
[1:09:06] them you know
[1:09:06] we always think you know I've thought
[1:09:09] there's many times and that I've heard
[1:09:11] people say this you know if only there
[1:09:12] was more supernatural you know if there
[1:09:14] was only more supernatural things you
[1:09:16] know they would encourage us and they
[1:09:17] would give us faith and you know it
[1:09:19] would be a wonderful thing if you know
[1:09:21] God was still doing all the miraculous
[1:09:23] things that he was doing on a daily
[1:09:24] basis and brother Brian's ministry but
[1:09:25] let me tell you it wouldn't give you any
[1:09:27] more faith and you me say God I don't
[1:09:30] know if I agree with that well look at
[1:09:31] Israel is the prime example of that is
[1:09:33] that God was doing supernatural things
[1:09:36] every single day and it required so
[1:09:41] little effort on their part to make any
[1:09:43] of them happen and yet did it fill them
[1:09:46] with faith no it didn't it actually made
[1:09:48] them grumble more and more and more and
[1:09:51] the more that God gave them the even
[1:09:53] less they wanted to do for themselves
[1:09:54] and so it really teaches me a lot when
[1:09:57] you look at the human nature is that we
[1:09:59] think why doesn't God just hand it to us
[1:10:00] because we'd be even lazier than we are
[1:10:03] now
[1:10:03] you know why doesn't God make it you
[1:10:05] know that much more you know why is my
[1:10:07] financial situation this much easier why
[1:10:09] are my kids this much you know sweeter
[1:10:11] why isn't this you know church that much
[1:10:12] better because we'd be even lazier and
[1:10:15] sometimes we come to church and we're
[1:10:17] not feeling it so we try a little harder
[1:10:20] you know we worship a little harder we
[1:10:21] we participate a little bit more and
[1:10:23] guess what sometimes those are the best
[1:10:25] services you know even as a minister
[1:10:27] many times you come in and you feel oh
[1:10:29] man I got service all ready to go
[1:10:30] tonight it should be wonderful and you
[1:10:32] know and anything well I just didn't
[1:10:34] feel like it went over but the day that
[1:10:35] you come and you're struggling you think
[1:10:37] oh I'm not ready for this service and I
[1:10:39] and I just don't know if I caught the
[1:10:41] mind to the Lord and everything else and
[1:10:42] you depend on God and then it becomes a
[1:10:44] real sweet service and you know I need a
[1:10:45] touch of somebody's life and you say
[1:10:47] that's really what it's about is just
[1:10:48] coming ready to do something and fight
[1:10:51] and struggle and God honors that God
[1:10:55] doesn't like it when we sit back say
[1:10:56] okay do something for me Lord he wants
[1:10:58] us to be fighting and struggling along
[1:10:59] with it so it's not the amount of
[1:11:02] supernatural you know so many people
[1:11:03] will say that in science even they would
[1:11:05] say you know show me God and not
[1:11:07] believer and then you can show them
[1:11:09] evidence of miraculous healing and all
[1:11:11] these amazing things that they can't
[1:11:13] explain and they just go like well you
[1:11:14] know I just can't quite understand I
[1:11:16] just couldn't quite believe it you know
[1:11:17] that it can be rationalized somehow you
[1:11:19] know it
[1:11:20] like what is it it's not the problem
[1:11:22] that they haven't seen enough it's that
[1:11:24] they don't have any faith because faith
[1:11:25] is not being convinced of something
[1:11:28] faith is the evidence you know if things
[1:11:31] not seeing it's a substance of you know
[1:11:33] of things not seen so it doesn't come
[1:11:35] from being explained how it all works
[1:11:38] out
[1:11:38] it comes from trusting and believing
[1:11:41] that God's keeping his promise that
[1:11:43] God's Word is true you know I had had
[1:11:46] somebody that I talked to one time not
[1:11:48] to digress too much but you know a young
[1:11:50] denominational man he was telling me all
[1:11:52] about how you know the time of Noah and
[1:11:56] I said he said do you know about the
[1:11:57] time of Noah I said well yeah I know but
[1:11:59] Noah built the ark and you know any and
[1:12:00] all the animals went into the ark and
[1:12:02] and you know God sent the flood and all
[1:12:04] that he's like he's like yeah but do you
[1:12:06] know why it never rains up until that
[1:12:09] time you know why I never in it
[1:12:10] I don't know far as I know the Bible
[1:12:12] didn't say anything about why didn't
[1:12:14] rain he said well you know we believe
[1:12:15] that there was a huge canopy of foliage
[1:12:17] that covered the earth you know and they
[1:12:20] trapped the moisture so it never formed
[1:12:22] any clouds or anything like that and you
[1:12:24] know that's why the dew watered the
[1:12:26] earth and everything and I said yeah I'm
[1:12:28] like wow you know that's interesting
[1:12:29] but like do you have to believe that in
[1:12:32] order to believe that Noah had an ark
[1:12:34] and that you know because if we can
[1:12:36] explain it all away it doesn't take any
[1:12:39] faith to believe it you know if you can
[1:12:42] prove it all out and you have a
[1:12:43] scientific explanation for anything
[1:12:45] everything then you know you don't have
[1:12:47] to have any faith but you know I don't
[1:12:49] understand how all of those animals fit
[1:12:51] in the ark I don't understand how all of
[1:12:54] the animals knew it was time to go there
[1:12:55] but I believe that it happened because
[1:12:57] God's Word said it did you know I don't
[1:12:59] necessarily understand how every part of
[1:13:01] creation worked or how any part of
[1:13:02] creation worked other than God said it
[1:13:04] and took place but I believe that it
[1:13:06] happened the way that God said that it
[1:13:08] happened you know so faith doesn't
[1:13:10] require us you know it doesn't require
[1:13:12] us to completely turn off our mind to
[1:13:14] say I just believe anything anybody
[1:13:15] tells me but there's something in faith
[1:13:17] that is always going to be required that
[1:13:19] we believe it because God said it and
[1:13:21] because it resonates with that soul
[1:13:23] inside of us so finally after 40 years
[1:13:32] and mistake after mistake and settle
[1:13:35] after settle after settle you know the
[1:13:38] most famous settling was when they came
[1:13:40] to the border they sent out the spies
[1:13:41] you know they found out that the land
[1:13:43] was just as good as God promised it it
[1:13:45] was just as wonderful as God promised it
[1:13:47] but it was going to take some battles
[1:13:50] like oh well we don't really want to
[1:13:53] fight those battles and what if we lose
[1:13:55] some of those battles and what if those
[1:13:56] battles are really hard and we heard
[1:13:58] those those guys are really big and
[1:13:59] strong and all of those things and so of
[1:14:01] course they settled for a wilderness
[1:14:03] experience 40 years instead of being in
[1:14:05] the Promised Land 40 years and finally
[1:14:09] we know that that generation is dying
[1:14:11] off the judgment that God gave them that
[1:14:13] that they would you know perish they
[1:14:16] would not be able to go in and see the
[1:14:18] Promised Land because of their disbelief
[1:14:20] and and all those things and so 40 years
[1:14:23] later they're finally you know willing
[1:14:26] to make the transition to a conquering
[1:14:28] nation all the old settlers are dead
[1:14:31] just a few left Moses and still around
[1:14:34] at that point and you know how there
[1:14:36] must have been so much excitement and
[1:14:38] enthusiasm and sometimes we get in that
[1:14:40] same kind of you know excitement and
[1:14:42] enthusiasm when we think about the
[1:14:44] rapture cycle because there's been a lot
[1:14:46] of year since brother Ram passed off the
[1:14:48] scene you know and there's a lot of low
[1:14:50] times in there where it doesn't feel
[1:14:51] like God moving it doesn't feel like
[1:14:53] we're really getting closer to that you
[1:14:54] know there's there's some of those lulls
[1:14:56] sometimes where it just feels like
[1:14:58] things are stagnant and not moving and
[1:14:59] and not growing not progressing to that
[1:15:01] place you know but then a couple things
[1:15:03] happen in the world and there's a new
[1:15:05] war and we get excited as new war you
[1:15:07] know there's rumors of wars and you know
[1:15:08] there's and there's an earthquake do you
[1:15:10] supposed to be earthquakes in diverse
[1:15:11] places I mean we started to get excited
[1:15:13] you know and things like that and we
[1:15:14] start to think that that you know this
[1:15:16] could be it you maybe you see the
[1:15:17] government system or you hear the
[1:15:19] preaching of the word hopefully is that
[1:15:20] the the most important thing that's
[1:15:21] telling you you know where we're at that
[1:15:23] time we're at that place it's time to
[1:15:25] get ready and we start to get excited we
[1:15:27] start to sense a shift a new opportunity
[1:15:29] to conquer as we should you know and
[1:15:32] right in that moment I stumbled across
[1:15:33] the scripture a while back and right in
[1:15:35] that moment where new songs were being
[1:15:37] written you know preparations are being
[1:15:38] made for them to go into this promised
[1:15:41] land finally and they're getting all
[1:15:42] excited and there's victory in a camp
[1:15:44] and all of that
[1:15:45] and God takes Moses aside to give him a
[1:15:48] little song for the children of Israel
[1:15:50] and I thought what a oh this is gonna be
[1:15:53] amazing you know could you imagine if if
[1:15:56] you know brother Bob got up and said the
[1:15:58] Lord gave me the words for this song and
[1:16:01] and the music for this song we're gonna
[1:16:03] sing this song tonight the God gave us
[1:16:06] to get ready for the rapture and you
[1:16:07] would say oh praise the Lord I am ready
[1:16:09] to hear that song what is it like let me
[1:16:12] hear the opening chords on the on the

[1:16:29] want to hear don't hear brother Bob
[1:16:31] strike that first note and you know I
[1:16:33] want it's going to be amazing well the
[1:16:35] Lord gives Moses a song for the children
[1:16:38] of Israel and this is a song excision in
[1:16:41] Deuteronomy 31 verse 14 and Lord said
[1:16:44] unto Moses behold thou thy days
[1:16:46] approached that must die called Joshua
[1:16:48] and present yourselves in the tabernacle
[1:16:49] of the congregation that I may give him
[1:16:51] a charge in Moses and Joshua went and
[1:16:53] presented themselves in the tabernacle
[1:16:54] of the congregation and the Lord
[1:16:57] appeared in the tabernacle on a pillar
[1:16:58] of a cloud and the pillar of a cloud
[1:16:59] stood over the door of the tabernacle
[1:17:01] and the Lord said unto Moses behold thou
[1:17:04] shalt sleep with thy fathers and this
[1:17:06] people will rise up and go a whoring
[1:17:08] after the gods of the strangers of the
[1:17:10] land whether they go to be among them
[1:17:13] and will forsake me and break my
[1:17:15] covenant which I have made with them
[1:17:17] then my anger shall be kindled against
[1:17:20] them in that day and I will forsake them
[1:17:22] and I will hide my face from them and
[1:17:24] they shall be devoured and many evils
[1:17:28] and trouble shall befall them so that
[1:17:31] they will say in that day are not these
[1:17:33] evils come upon us because our God is
[1:17:36] not among us and I will surely hide my
[1:17:39] face in that day for all the evils which
[1:17:41] they have wrought and in that they are
[1:17:43] turned unto other gods
[1:17:44] now therefore write you this song for
[1:17:47] them for you and teach it the children
[1:17:50] of Israel and put it in their mouths
[1:17:51] that this song may be a witness for me
[1:17:54] against the children of Israel for when
[1:17:57] I shall have brought them into the
[1:17:59] which I swear unto their fathers that
[1:18:00] floweth with milk and honey and they
[1:18:03] shall have eaten and filled themselves
[1:18:05] and wax in fact then they will return
[1:18:07] then they will turn unto other gods and
[1:18:09] serve them and provoke me and break my
[1:18:12] covenant and it shall come to pass when
[1:18:14] many evils and troubles are befallen
[1:18:16] them that this song shall testify
[1:18:18] against them as a witness for it shall
[1:18:21] not be forgotten out of the mouths of
[1:18:23] their seed for I know their imagination
[1:18:25] which they go about even now before I
[1:18:28] have brought them into the land which I
[1:18:30] swear Moses therefore wrote this song
[1:18:33] the same day and taught at the children
[1:18:34] of Israel and he gave Joshua the son of
[1:18:37] nun of charge and said be strong and of
[1:18:39] a good courage for thou shalt bring the
[1:18:41] children of Israel into the land which I
[1:18:43] swear unto them and I will be with thee
[1:18:47] sorry it wasn't a very happy song you
[1:18:50] know but they they probably thought you
[1:18:52] know this is this is wonderful we're all
[1:18:54] excited we're going into this place it's
[1:18:55] going to be so amazing we're never gonna
[1:18:57] have another problem we're just gonna
[1:18:58] roll through this Promised Land and God
[1:19:01] gives them this song instead and it's a
[1:19:04] very sobering song you know to say that
[1:19:06] you're gonna settle you're gonna go into
[1:19:10] this land and you're gonna have some
[1:19:11] victory and you're gonna carve out a new
[1:19:13] life for yourselves and then you're
[1:19:15] gonna settle down and you're gonna look
[1:19:17] at the gods of the people around you and
[1:19:19] you're gonna start to adopt their
[1:19:21] behavior and you're gonna start to take
[1:19:23] the easy way and you're gonna realize
[1:19:24] it's easier to make friends with these
[1:19:26] guys than it is to be fighting with them
[1:19:27] and you're just gonna compromise and
[1:19:29] compromise and compromise you know I
[1:19:32] thought what what a sobering thing to
[1:19:35] tell a people that's ready to go in and
[1:19:36] conquer what God knows his people well
[1:19:39] you know everyone was probably singing
[1:19:41] when the battles over we shall wear a
[1:19:42] crown you know I'm bound for the
[1:19:44] promised land and God Himself gives them
[1:19:47] a song to sing you know and I thought
[1:19:50] it's interesting that he never gave it a
[1:19:51] title you know we always like the title
[1:19:54] I don't know what scene and I thought
[1:19:55] you know what he'd have been called the
[1:19:56] settler song The Ballad of the
[1:19:59] backslider
[1:20:00] you know the psalm of the sinned six
[1:20:02] souls I don't know they're you know
[1:20:03] something with a nice ring to it but you
[1:20:05] know the message behind it it was a
[1:20:08] pretty pretty sobering one and he taught
[1:20:11] it
[1:20:11] to them think about that we sing the
[1:20:13] songs you know that we sing it and
[1:20:15] they're usually rejoicing songs you know
[1:20:18] remembering good things all that and he
[1:20:20] teaches them a song to remind them so
[1:20:22] that one day when they're singing you
[1:20:24] know how we're tracing the gods of this
[1:20:26] land and you know they can look around
[1:20:28] and say we are chasing the gods of this
[1:20:30] land
[1:20:30] you know we have let all this evil
[1:20:32] befall us we have let all of these
[1:20:34] things come to us you know in God in His
[1:20:36] mercy gives them that knowledge that
[1:20:40] warning before they even go into the
[1:20:43] land you know before they they've even
[1:20:45] made a single compromise he's already
[1:20:48] told them this is what's gonna happen
[1:20:50] beware you know be be warned and brother
[1:20:52] Brown tells us warning then judgment God
[1:20:54] always gives us a warning before
[1:20:56] judgment just his grace to us and it
[1:20:58] doesn't surprise us with the judgment at
[1:21:00] the end he tells us what the pitfalls
[1:21:01] are in the land he gave them judgment
[1:21:05] you know all of all the people of Israel
[1:21:09] that are mentioned who left Egypt all of
[1:21:13] them there's only two that we that are
[1:21:16] really recorded as conquerors you know
[1:21:21] that brother Brown when he preaches the
[1:21:22] message one in a million he comes back
[1:21:23] to that over and over again you know two
[1:21:25] million people left Egypt and only two
[1:21:27] people really were conquerors or two
[1:21:29] were really those ones one in a million
[1:21:31] you know Joshua and Caleb and and I
[1:21:34] think it's special that one of them was
[1:21:36] in the ministry and one of them was in
[1:21:37] the congregation you know that you know
[1:21:39] who were never satisfied with their
[1:21:41] present condition and who pressed
[1:21:43] forward who were faithful witnesses
[1:21:45] encouraging others to conquer and also
[1:21:48] conquering in their own lives and you
[1:21:51] know when that last verse said you know
[1:21:53] he told Joshua the son of nun you know
[1:21:55] be strong enough a good courage no
[1:21:57] wonder he told him that you know he had
[1:21:59] just given him a song that said these
[1:22:01] people are gonna give up and compromise
[1:22:03] and settle down and all of these things
[1:22:05] yeah oh yeah and you're the new guy in
[1:22:07] charge by the way you know that's a
[1:22:09] pretty daunting task right and so you
[1:22:11] you read a you know the first chapter of
[1:22:13] Joshua and and God just comes and tells
[1:22:16] him time and time again be strong and
[1:22:18] have a good courage I'm with you you
[1:22:20] know as I was with Moses over and over
[1:22:22] and over again and you start to think
[1:22:23] about that you know Joshua was thinking
[1:22:25] like
[1:22:25] wait as he was with Moses they're trying
[1:22:27] to kill Moses half the time you know
[1:22:29] they're they're trying to stone Moses
[1:22:30] they were rebelling against Moses all
[1:22:31] the time is this really the job that I
[1:22:33] want because it'd be strong and of good
[1:22:36] courage and and Joshua just kept
[1:22:38] pressing on and you know the book of
[1:22:40] Joshua is not an easy steamroll into the
[1:22:45] into the country and never have any
[1:22:47] problems you know there's problem after
[1:22:49] problem after problem that still comes
[1:22:51] up in that time you know time is when
[1:22:53] they got complacent times when they made
[1:22:55] peace with the Gibeonites when they
[1:22:57] shouldn't have they should have
[1:22:57] conquered them but they know they didn't
[1:22:59] pray about that they didn't they didn't
[1:23:01] seek the Lord I said you know they came
[1:23:03] with old clothes and moldy bread and
[1:23:05] said you know we're you know we've come
[1:23:07] from so far away and we just want to
[1:23:09] make peace with you and if we come to
[1:23:10] find out you know they they come from so
[1:23:12] far away like you know 20 miles down the
[1:23:13] road and they had you know they had
[1:23:15] deceived them and it said that they
[1:23:17] hadn't sought the Lord so you know it
[1:23:19] wasn't that they went through without
[1:23:20] any trouble but it was it was a progress
[1:23:24] that was moving on and moving on and
[1:23:25] moving on and you find a long way in you
[1:23:29] know that Joshua is still saying there's
[1:23:31] much land to be possessed there's much
[1:23:33] land to be possessed and when you look
[1:23:35] at what they really achieved they didn't
[1:23:39] achieve all the left you know they
[1:23:41] didn't drive out all the enemies there
[1:23:43] was a lot of land that still was left to
[1:23:45] be possessed you know but but Joshua
[1:23:48] also knew this he could not change the
[1:23:52] heart of a settler he could not change
[1:23:55] the heart of a settler
[1:23:56] but he proclaimed with fierceness the
[1:23:58] heart of a conqueror that was in his own
[1:24:00] chest and and he says here in Joshua
[1:24:02] 24:15 he says and if it seem evil unto
[1:24:05] you to serve the Lord choose you this
[1:24:08] day whom you will serve whether the gods
[1:24:10] which your father's served that were on
[1:24:12] the other side of the flood or the gods
[1:24:14] of the hammerites and whose land you
[1:24:15] dwell but as for me and my house we will
[1:24:18] serve the Lord you know that's a that's
[1:24:22] a strong statement in that time when you
[1:24:24] know people all around we're making
[1:24:26] peace and and saying oh it's easier to
[1:24:27] pull tribute than it is to fight these
[1:24:29] people it's you know it's easier to
[1:24:31] benefit from them than to fight against
[1:24:33] them but Joshua said choose you what
[1:24:36] you're gonna do but ask for me in my
[1:24:39] we're still gonna keep doing that you
[1:24:40] know if you want to look at examples in
[1:24:42] the church or examples in the message
[1:24:44] and see people who are compromised and
[1:24:45] people that are made peace with the
[1:24:46] devil and you know people that have come
[1:24:48] to a certain place and settled down and
[1:24:50] think that well everybody else is doing
[1:24:52] it that's not going to help you at all
[1:24:55] but when you realize that in spite of
[1:24:56] all of those things there's still a
[1:24:58] choice for you choose you this day what
[1:25:02] you're gonna do but as for me in my
[1:25:04] house I'm gonna serve the Lord
[1:25:05] you know there's far too much of this
[1:25:07] stuff that happens and especially in
[1:25:09] this information age or misinformation
[1:25:11] age as I call it that you know you see
[1:25:13] somebody else doing something you see oh
[1:25:15] man this pastor on the internet he
[1:25:16] allows this or you know this person does
[1:25:18] this so did you know that so-and-so does
[1:25:20] this so you know so-and-so has this
[1:25:21] tradition SONA and what we do is become
[1:25:24] collectors of these things and like well
[1:25:26] this person is doing it so must be okay
[1:25:27] and this person is doing this it must be
[1:25:29] okay
[1:25:29] but know what what's the thing is that
[1:25:31] God's not holding you accountable for
[1:25:32] somebody else's life he's holding you a
[1:25:34] camo for what you have in your own life
[1:25:38] Caleb he saw the mixed success that
[1:25:41] people were having you know they would
[1:25:43] drive out a certain people make peace
[1:25:45] you know and then settle and become
[1:25:48] satisfied with their circumstances and
[1:25:50] Caleb Fleming he helped many other
[1:25:52] people fight for their inheritance
[1:25:54] before he thought of his own inheritance
[1:25:55] you know you could look you've been in
[1:25:56] the land for already five years before
[1:25:58] Caleb comes in to see Joshua his own
[1:26:01] inheritance he's you know he's 85 years
[1:26:03] old when he comes to see him and and do
[1:26:05] the math and they've already been there
[1:26:06] for a while but what Caleb finally
[1:26:08] realized is that you know what I've
[1:26:10] helped a lot of people and a lot of
[1:26:12] people have not bothered to go all the
[1:26:14] way I'm gonna go and get my land now you
[1:26:17] know sometimes we say that's selfish but
[1:26:19] you know we have to be selfish to make
[1:26:21] sure that our spiritual walk is right
[1:26:23] first before we can help somebody else
[1:26:25] that jesus said take take the beam out
[1:26:27] of your own eye before you get the
[1:26:28] motive somebody else's we can see we can
[1:26:30] get so busy sometimes helping other
[1:26:31] people that our own spiritual walk
[1:26:33] suffers you know so busy thinking of
[1:26:35] others were willing to go over on their
[1:26:37] ground to try to reach them and we get
[1:26:39] off of the ground that we should be
[1:26:40] standing on so so Caleb after five years
[1:26:43] finally he comes and he sees Joshua and
[1:26:45] he said now behold the LORD hath kept me
[1:26:47] alive as he said these forty and five
[1:26:48] years even since the Lord spake this
[1:26:51] word unto Moses while the children of
[1:26:52] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[1:26:55] am this day four score and five years
[1:26:57] old as yet I am I as strong this day as
[1:27:02] I was in the day that Moses sent me as
[1:27:04] my strength was then even so is my
[1:27:06] strength now for war both to go out and
[1:27:09] to come in now therefore give me this
[1:27:12] mountain where of the Lord spake in that
[1:27:14] day for thou hardest in the day how the
[1:27:16] anakims were there and that the cities
[1:27:18] were great and fenced if so be the Lord
[1:27:20] be with me that I shall be able to drive
[1:27:23] them out as the Lord had said you know I
[1:27:26] hope we can see it it's a pretty clear
[1:27:28] difference between the settlers and the
[1:27:31] conquerors you know and I pray like like
[1:27:34] Joshua and Caleb lived an example that
[1:27:37] it inspires and it speaks more
[1:27:40] conquerors into existence the more we
[1:27:42] talk about this to say you know what I
[1:27:43] have been settling I have been you know
[1:27:45] taking the easy way but I want to keep
[1:27:47] pressing in I want to keep conquering
[1:27:49] that the settlers heart will be
[1:27:51] quickened to be a conqueror because
[1:27:52] their example did inspire other people
[1:27:54] to keep going you know but Caleb looked
[1:27:57] at this if you look at his inheritance
[1:28:00] Caleb did not choose the easiest place
[1:28:03] he's 85 year-old man you know and he
[1:28:06] says he was the same as he was when he
[1:28:07] was he's 40 years old but you know I'm
[1:28:09] sure in his body he'd gotten a little
[1:28:11] more tired he got a little more a week
[1:28:13] you know maybe lost little muscle mass
[1:28:14] maybe you know all of those things but
[1:28:16] the heart hadn't changed you know the
[1:28:19] desire the the zeal hadn't changed and
[1:28:22] so he said I'm as strong today as I was
[1:28:24] back then
[1:28:25] and so Caleb doesn't choose you know a
[1:28:28] nice easy land he chooses a mountain for
[1:28:31] one thing you know you know you know
[1:28:35] amount you guys know all about rock here
[1:28:36] you don't you know you know find that to
[1:28:39] be oh this will be the easiest place to
[1:28:40] build a house is right here on this you
[1:28:42] know big chunk of rock or this would be
[1:28:44] the easiest place to grow vegetables or
[1:28:46] raise animals you know on a big chunk of
[1:28:49] rock so a difficult place to do that you
[1:28:50] know you see even here building how you
[1:28:52] blast everything out of the rock it's
[1:28:53] difficult work expensive all of those
[1:28:56] things but that's what what Caleb wanted
[1:28:58] he didn't say now give me my valley you
[1:29:01] know give me my retirement home he said
[1:29:03] give me my mountain and not only that
[1:29:05] but
[1:29:06] didn't just pick a mountain that nobody
[1:29:08] else had any interested in he picked a
[1:29:09] mountain with the biggest Giants you
[1:29:11] know the ones that were the most
[1:29:12] intimidating so where the fences were
[1:29:15] walled and you know all of these things
[1:29:16] where the cities were walled and so he
[1:29:18] he picks that place this old guy that
[1:29:21] you know should be should be going for
[1:29:23] the easier life that's the place he
[1:29:24] picks he says that's the inheritance guy
[1:29:26] wanted that's what God promised me
[1:29:29] give me my mountain you know and when he
[1:29:31] said give me my mountain it didn't mean
[1:29:33] you know send with me a you know twenty
[1:29:35] five thousand people to go take this
[1:29:37] mountain it's like no let me know that I
[1:29:38] can go take it and I will go in there
[1:29:40] and he says if the Lord will be with me
[1:29:42] I will conquer it that's a powerful
[1:29:45] statement for a man who'd already
[1:29:47] suffered many things it already helps so
[1:29:49] many others but he was willing to do it
[1:29:51] you know if you look at at most groups
[1:29:56] you know in any industry any aspect of
[1:29:59] life you know most people will not truly
[1:30:02] ever have the will of a conqueror
[1:30:05] they'll achieve success and varying
[1:30:07] measures and and at some point though
[1:30:10] make peace that well this is about as
[1:30:12] good as it gets
[1:30:13] you know this is this is the extent of
[1:30:15] my ability this is the extent of my
[1:30:17] opportunity you know and make peace with
[1:30:19] their limitations and you know settle
[1:30:21] for what they believe is realistic they
[1:30:22] become satisfied with that you know you
[1:30:24] could take that any kind of industry any
[1:30:26] kind of group of people you always find
[1:30:27] the majority of people will get to that
[1:30:29] place you know and and like most people
[1:30:33] we can be that way sometimes too you
[1:30:35] know when when there's a you know an
[1:30:37] active conflict we're all you know oh
[1:30:39] let's go get em and everything else but
[1:30:41] you know when the conflict passes then
[1:30:43] we relax and get comfortable again you
[1:30:47] know as soon as the danger passes we say
[1:30:49] oh you know yeah well that wasn't so bad
[1:30:51] let's try I'm so glad that trials over
[1:30:53] and now we can just take a little time
[1:30:54] off you know I'm so I'm so glad that the
[1:30:56] difficulty has passed now we can just
[1:30:58] rest and relax you know but that's not
[1:31:01] really the heart of a conqueror yeah
[1:31:05] that's the heart of a settler who is
[1:31:06] kind of forced to get up off the couch
[1:31:08] when trouble arose you know and so you
[1:31:11] know kind of like you know you could say
[1:31:13] someone like or mine left me completed
[1:31:17] the one that grabbed the Ox code and
[1:31:19] and and went after the enemy you know
[1:31:21] after the Philistine Shamgar thank you
[1:31:23] you know he had he didn't let it go and
[1:31:26] go and go and go and go and finally he
[1:31:30] can't take it anymore and he grabs the
[1:31:31] Ox coat and and he goes and slays and
[1:31:34] has victory and and brings deliverance
[1:31:35] to his family but it took an awful lot
[1:31:38] to get him to go because it really
[1:31:41] wasn't enough to just go out and fight
[1:31:42] the enemy and take it to him he really
[1:31:44] had to be prodded and prodded
[1:31:46] look at someone like Samson Samson had
[1:31:49] all the power and ability by God's gift
[1:31:52] to completely annihilate the Philistines
[1:31:56] Samson had never been defeated in any
[1:31:59] conflict you know no matter what they
[1:32:02] did no matter what the numbers were no
[1:32:04] matter how many people they brought
[1:32:05] against him no matter how you no good
[1:32:08] their equipment was and how poor his own
[1:32:10] equipment was every situation that
[1:32:12] Samson got into where he went you know
[1:32:14] face to face toe-to-toe with an enemy he
[1:32:17] won every single battle and it didn't
[1:32:19] take you know it didn't take a lot of
[1:32:21] effort it didn't seem like you know he
[1:32:23] could just do whatever you wanted and
[1:32:25] show up in the middle of the battle and
[1:32:26] and have victory time and time and time
[1:32:28] again you know did he bring deliverance
[1:32:31] to Israel yeah in some circumstances he
[1:32:34] did but if you look at the heart of
[1:32:36] Samson he was a settler you know inside
[1:32:40] of him he was a settler he took the easy
[1:32:42] way every single time you know and
[1:32:45] sometimes the deliverance he brought to
[1:32:47] Israel was almost accidental you know
[1:32:50] it's like it is almost accidental you
[1:32:53] read through some of his exploits and
[1:32:54] you know it's not because Samson said
[1:32:56] let me go and drive out the enemy he was
[1:32:58] like Samson got himself in trouble and
[1:33:00] the enemy came to him and you know he's
[1:33:02] in a really difficult situation they
[1:33:04] never should have been in in the first
[1:33:05] place and you know in that moment where
[1:33:07] you know you really should have been
[1:33:08] slaughtered for his foolishness
[1:33:10] you know God God gives him deliverance
[1:33:12] and he and he's still able to overcome
[1:33:14] the enemy you know Samson's wildest
[1:33:16] exploits either come when he's gotten
[1:33:18] himself in trouble following the lust of
[1:33:20] his flesh or when he's angry and having
[1:33:22] a temper tantrum you know and he's been
[1:33:24] personally shamed those are the times
[1:33:26] when he has the most victory you know
[1:33:29] what a shame if that was our testimony
[1:33:30] that the the most victory he has is
[1:33:33] when we put ourselves in a bad situation
[1:33:34] and you know the most times we have
[1:33:36] victory is you know when we've been
[1:33:38] embarrassed or humiliated you know when
[1:33:40] Samson's own life is in danger that's
[1:33:42] when he finally steps up to the
[1:33:43] challenge and the rest of his life is
[1:33:46] just settling after settling after
[1:33:49] settling you know and he look at it
[1:33:52] Sampson was raised up as a judge over
[1:33:55] Israel God had a purpose for his life to
[1:33:58] give them deliverance to give them
[1:34:00] strength to you know to drive out their
[1:34:02] enemy to set an example before them and
[1:34:04] yet his own willing to miss to
[1:34:09] compromise and his complacency robbed
[1:34:12] him of personal victory and reward time
[1:34:14] and time again and you know it's it
[1:34:16] remarkable to me you look at the story
[1:34:18] as it unfolds with Delilah and I didn't
[1:34:20] I didn't put it all in here to save time
[1:34:22] tonight but you know he he settled
[1:34:24] himself in the arms of Delilah too many
[1:34:26] times and she never proved herself
[1:34:29] worthy of that you know every single
[1:34:31] time that he gave her a reason you know
[1:34:34] why he had this strength she wouldn't
[1:34:36] took advantage of it immediately you
[1:34:38] know she she never proved any kind of
[1:34:40] trustworthiness she never proved that
[1:34:42] you know she could handle it she didn't
[1:34:44] prove any of those things you know she
[1:34:46] was on his side every time she said what
[1:34:48] is this Samson he says Oh oh wow you
[1:34:49] know you know you know I've never had
[1:34:51] new cords on me before you know it's
[1:34:53] always these old ropes that's the
[1:34:54] problem you know so you know immediately
[1:34:56] these new ropes show up but you know
[1:34:58] when Samson falls asleep he wakes up in
[1:35:00] these he's bound by these ropes you know
[1:35:02] what did you think was gonna happen and
[1:35:03] and just time after time but yet you see
[1:35:07] that same pattern in the lives of
[1:35:10] Christians today that's what makes me
[1:35:12] sad is that you know we look at Samson
[1:35:14] and and you know we can look at his
[1:35:16] story and say what an idiot like
[1:35:17] sometimes we can think like how did he
[1:35:19] possibly not realize where this was
[1:35:21] headed how did he possibly not realize
[1:35:23] that as he got closer and closer and
[1:35:26] closer to giving away the secret that
[1:35:27] she was just gonna keep testing the
[1:35:29] intestine until he until he lost but we
[1:35:32] do the same thing so many times we've
[1:35:35] been given a Holy Ghost power that has
[1:35:38] never been defeated that could drive the
[1:35:40] devil into complete despair but the
[1:35:42] bottom tells us we can live a life that
[1:35:43] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:35:45] us
[1:35:47] so many times the devil knows exactly
[1:35:48] what to do with us you know and the
[1:35:51] devil knows exactly what to do with us
[1:35:53] and just like Delilah you know having
[1:35:56] Samson sleep upon her knees that's you
[1:35:58] know that's what the devil does to us
[1:36:00] just lulls us back to sleep like oh you
[1:36:02] know grab your phone grab your computer
[1:36:05] you know just relax you know just
[1:36:07] entertain yourself you know you just you
[1:36:09] know just just let away the cares of the
[1:36:11] world and then you know we just thought
[1:36:13] that sound good yeah that's just rest
[1:36:16] it's been a hard day it's been a long
[1:36:17] day
[1:36:18] stressed out I just need to have an
[1:36:19] escape and before we know it well
[1:36:22] where's all the power of prayer you know
[1:36:24] where does all the power of strength in
[1:36:26] our lives where's the joy where's the
[1:36:27] victory it just kind of fades away on
[1:36:30] Delilah's knees the casualties of
[1:36:35] settling are piling up all around us you
[1:36:39] know and it didn't show up years ago I'm
[1:36:41] not sure why I guess just sowing and
[1:36:42] reaping but the casualties are piling up
[1:36:47] in this message a lot of people have
[1:36:50] walked away that we never expected to
[1:36:53] walk away a lot of people have given up
[1:36:55] a lot of people have been confused a lot
[1:36:56] of people have been overcome and they're
[1:36:58] piling up more than they ever had before
[1:37:00] it you know some of have backslidden
[1:37:02] some have completely fallen away and
[1:37:04] sometimes we we can get very
[1:37:07] self-righteous about that and we can
[1:37:08] think oh man that you know I guess they
[1:37:10] were just serpent seed or I guess they
[1:37:12] you know they just weren't really
[1:37:13] children of God or make believers
[1:37:15] whatever we want to cast them off as
[1:37:16] I've heard people cannon fodder all
[1:37:18] those things but you know maybe maybe
[1:37:22] we've been sowing some of those same
[1:37:24] seeds and they just haven't reaped out
[1:37:27] yet because for a lot of them they went
[1:37:30] a lot of years - they went a lot of
[1:37:32] years coming to church singing songs
[1:37:35] shaking hands saying amen
[1:37:38] and it took a long time before they got
[1:37:40] to that place where you know there was
[1:37:42] no more power in their life where there
[1:37:44] was no more strength in their life where
[1:37:45] too many cares of life had choked out
[1:37:47] their experience you know where too many
[1:37:49] pressures are common so you know before
[1:37:51] we get too confident we need to make
[1:37:55] sure that we haven't been sowing those
[1:37:57] same things and they just haven't reaped
[1:37:59] out yet
[1:38:00] the testimony of Joshua Caleb as we turn
[1:38:04] to more to the thought of the conquerors
[1:38:06] because that's that's where we want to
[1:38:08] get to we don't want to be focusing on
[1:38:10] all the settlers unless we realize oh
[1:38:12] man there's some settling to me let's
[1:38:13] stop doing that but the testimony of
[1:38:16] Joshua and Caleb and and the other over
[1:38:18] comers in the promised land is that the
[1:38:20] people stayed true until those
[1:38:23] conquerors had died you know the people
[1:38:27] in Israel and in the promised land sorry
[1:38:29] the children of Israel the promised land
[1:38:30] they they were pretty faithful and true
[1:38:32] until Joshua and Caleb died and in the
[1:38:35] next generation was really where they
[1:38:37] stopped following those things they were
[1:38:39] there was no new conquerors that raised
[1:38:41] up there was no new conquerors that that
[1:38:43] you know kept giving them that same kind
[1:38:46] of strength and that same kind of
[1:38:47] victory and saying you know here we go
[1:38:49] and God would raise up a a judge and
[1:38:51] they would all rally for the judge the
[1:38:53] judge passed away and they all settled
[1:38:54] again and they'd run themselves into
[1:38:56] that same condition and so I believe
[1:38:58] that's why it's so important why the
[1:38:59] body of Christ needs ministry and laity
[1:39:01] that will stand as conquerors I set an
[1:39:04] example for others to follow because you
[1:39:06] know as much as we say we're all
[1:39:07] following Christ but Paul said follow me
[1:39:09] as I follow Christ know there has to be
[1:39:11] examples of someone that you can put
[1:39:13] your trust in and say I want to keep
[1:39:15] praying like that brothers pray I want
[1:39:16] to keep pushing like that brother
[1:39:18] expression I want to keep struggling
[1:39:19] like that brother struggling in his in
[1:39:21] his trials in his situation because I
[1:39:23] know if he can do it I can keep going
[1:39:25] you know as much as we'd all love to be
[1:39:27] you know David facing down Goliath
[1:39:30] there's not that many David's you know
[1:39:33] there was a lot of people out on the
[1:39:34] battlefield as we talked about a little
[1:39:35] bit last night and brother Joe brother
[1:39:37] but there was only one David but what
[1:39:40] happened when David went and defeated
[1:39:42] Goliath there you know there was only
[1:39:44] one man that was willing to step up and
[1:39:45] do that but when that one man stepped up
[1:39:47] and fought Goliath and won victory the
[1:39:50] rest of them jumped right into the
[1:39:52] battle you know the rest of them
[1:39:54] realized hey if he can do it I can be a
[1:39:56] part of this and so the children of
[1:39:57] Israel rose up and they chased and
[1:39:59] pursued the Philistines and they had a
[1:40:00] great victory because one man was
[1:40:04] willing to step up and conquer
[1:40:06] you know I believe there's a lot of
[1:40:07] people who can be like that army of
[1:40:09] Israel that saw David defeat Goliath and
[1:40:11] then charged into battle follow the
[1:40:14] examples of the conquerors around you
[1:40:16] and you can conquer as well you know
[1:40:18] follow those examples find that one myth
[1:40:20] that's pressing don't don't get
[1:40:22] distracted by all the people that aren't
[1:40:24] oppressing follow find someone that is
[1:40:26] pressing you'll find a brother or a
[1:40:28] sister that you can say I want to be
[1:40:29] like that I want to be more like that I
[1:40:31] want to have more dedication I want to
[1:40:32] keep pressing and when you find that
[1:40:34] just keep going just keep following that
[1:40:36] example and they'll help you to keep
[1:40:38] going help help you to get that
[1:40:40] conquerors mentality going on you know
[1:40:46] Samson he had that one great victory
[1:40:48] when he finally subjected his will and
[1:40:50] was willing to wait lay down his life
[1:40:52] after spending his whole life living for
[1:40:55] himself when he was willing to subject
[1:40:56] himself great victory was wrought and he
[1:40:59] conquered the Philistines in a greater
[1:41:01] way than he ever had before but you know
[1:41:04] being a true Conqueror is not about
[1:41:06] individual victories it's not about
[1:41:10] having some success you know because you
[1:41:13] can have plenty of individual victories
[1:41:15] and still be a settler you know you look
[1:41:17] at like the time of the great battles
[1:41:19] and wars have been fought you know both
[1:41:21] sides had plenty of individual victories
[1:41:23] but there was still a winner and a loser
[1:41:24] in the war and so you know we can get
[1:41:27] complacent sometimes because when we
[1:41:30] have a bunch of victories in a row we
[1:41:32] start to think oh this Devils nothing
[1:41:34] you know you really is a bluff yeah I
[1:41:36] don't even have to hardly try you know
[1:41:38] and the devil is a master at setting up
[1:41:39] easy victories for you sometimes you
[1:41:42] come to church on Sunday and man just
[1:41:45] knocking that devil aside wow this is so
[1:41:47] easy wow it's like he's not even trying
[1:41:49] well he isn't really he's he's just
[1:41:51] setting you up I said oh yeah don't
[1:41:53] worry you overcame look at you you yay
[1:41:55] family was great today the kids were
[1:41:57] wonderful everything that was perfect
[1:41:59] you're just such a good parent and now
[1:42:01] you just doing everything right and man
[1:42:03] you know that that brother says
[1:42:04] something to you should have set you off
[1:42:05] but you conquered your temper you are
[1:42:07] amazing wow look at you go you know and
[1:42:09] the devil is just getting you ready
[1:42:11] giving you a victory after victory after
[1:42:13] victory and then you'll hit you with the
[1:42:16] tough stuff you know right when you
[1:42:17] you're complacent right when you you
[1:42:19] think
[1:42:20] everything's going well that's when he
[1:42:22] hit you with the hard trials that's when
[1:42:24] he hit me with the big punches you know
[1:42:25] that you realized he was just throwing a
[1:42:27] few jabs and here comes you know the
[1:42:29] haymaker here comes the knockout punch
[1:42:30] because the devil's a master doing those
[1:42:33] things but you know to me the difference
[1:42:35] between a conqueror and a settler is
[1:42:36] that it's not about our individual
[1:42:38] victories that gives us confidence it's
[1:42:41] that we know we're not there yet it
[1:42:44] doesn't matter how many victories have
[1:42:45] already been won if we're still not at
[1:42:47] the destination then there's still more
[1:42:49] to do you know we're not resting on
[1:42:51] anything because we haven't really
[1:42:52] accomplished anything until we get to
[1:42:55] the destination you know if if I was on
[1:42:57] my way here to Newfoundland and we got
[1:42:58] the Toronto say all oh praise the Lord
[1:43:01] that was a good flight I'm so glad we
[1:43:02] made it and I'm just gonna stop here you
[1:43:04] know and everything else look how far
[1:43:06] we've come from Edmonton we've come so
[1:43:07] far already wow what a what a great trip
[1:43:10] we've had you know we would we don't be
[1:43:12] like halfway here or two thirds of the
[1:43:14] way here but but man look at all the
[1:43:15] distance we covered we never got to the
[1:43:17] destination you know you have to you
[1:43:19] have to get all the way there you have
[1:43:21] to go all the way there and if you think
[1:43:23] about your own life when you feel you
[1:43:25] have victory over your temper over
[1:43:26] temptation over the flesh what does that
[1:43:28] produce does it produce a greater
[1:43:32] urgency to keep pressing to the rapture
[1:43:34] or does it produce complacency you know
[1:43:38] most of the time it produces complacency
[1:43:41] you know when we have victory we get
[1:43:43] relaxed and we get lazy and the devil
[1:43:45] doesn't have to fight you constantly to
[1:43:48] win battles over you he just has us to
[1:43:50] fight to gain a little ground and then
[1:43:53] get you all worked up you know like
[1:43:55] Samson you know Samson you know he he
[1:43:57] would get all worked up and he'd go out
[1:43:59] and do his great big work and then he
[1:44:01] relax again and the devil would just
[1:44:03] take a little more and then he would
[1:44:05] fight it and and then he would you give
[1:44:07] back a little bit more you know and till
[1:44:09] he he really didn't find out that he had
[1:44:11] lost the battle until he had already
[1:44:13] lost it you know it's already already
[1:44:14] lost his sight till he already you know
[1:44:16] got to that place and you know and he
[1:44:18] back to Israel Israel surrendered more
[1:44:20] and more land to their enemies every
[1:44:23] year you know every year they they
[1:44:26] fought those battles and they thought
[1:44:27] they were making progress and their
[1:44:29] enemy just kept taking a little bit more
[1:44:30] a little bit more a little bit more you
[1:44:33] know
[1:44:33] to find out in the time of David you
[1:44:35] know for as much as Israel occupied
[1:44:37] their enemy's occupied most of the land
[1:44:39] you know they have really been subdued
[1:44:41] you know why does that comment comes
[1:44:43] from years of settling years of getting
[1:44:45] complacent years of fighting a few
[1:44:47] battles and then giving up spiritual
[1:44:51] settlers will always be further from God
[1:44:54] in the long run and the reason for that
[1:44:56] is because the Holy Spirit is the true
[1:44:58] Conqueror the Holy Spirit is never going
[1:45:01] to be standing still the Holy Spirit is
[1:45:03] never going to say this is good enough
[1:45:05] well you guys have have been in the
[1:45:07] message 20 years now 30 years now 40
[1:45:09] years now way to go that's wonderful you
[1:45:11] know we don't need to do anything more
[1:45:13] with you know the Holy Spirit we'll keep
[1:45:15] pressing and saying you know you've been
[1:45:17] here 40 years but just a little longer
[1:45:18] just a little longer because if you
[1:45:20] think this is great what I've got for
[1:45:22] you next is gonna be so much better than
[1:45:24] what you're at right now you know you're
[1:45:26] still in this body think about how great
[1:45:27] it will be when you're in a glorified
[1:45:29] body you're still in this world but you
[1:45:31] know think about what's coming in the
[1:45:32] world to come you know all of those
[1:45:34] things and the Holy Spirit is never
[1:45:36] gonna stop conquering and so if we
[1:45:38] settle only part of the time we're gonna
[1:45:41] get further behind all of the time you
[1:45:44] know if we settle if we settle only 10%
[1:45:46] of the time we're following 10% behind
[1:45:48] you know where God's moving all the time
[1:45:50] so it's really in our best interest it's
[1:45:52] really the the call of the Spirit of God
[1:45:54] I believe is keep pressing keep pressing
[1:45:57] keep pressing in the end it really comes
[1:46:02] down to whether or not the mind of
[1:46:04] Christ is in us you know because if it
[1:46:07] is we'll we'll keep conquering and we
[1:46:09] won't be happy subtly will keep striving
[1:46:12] because we have no inheritance in this
[1:46:14] world you know I know the pressures that
[1:46:16] are exist that way to carve out a
[1:46:18] comfortable place for yourself you know
[1:46:20] this is your little spot this is your
[1:46:22] house this is your car it's your kids
[1:46:24] this is you know where everybody's at
[1:46:25] it's nice and comfortable but that's not
[1:46:28] our home that's not our place you know
[1:46:30] it's not about getting our business to a
[1:46:31] certain spot it's not about getting our
[1:46:33] families to a certain spot we could gain
[1:46:35] everything in this world and we will
[1:46:37] still not have reached the goal that God
[1:46:39] has for our lives
[1:46:40] so if we don't have the mind of Christ
[1:46:43] on us we will be content to settle
[1:46:45] eventually it'll show up in our attitude
[1:46:48] you might have read this scripture
[1:46:51] before but to me it really captures this
[1:46:52] thought nicely second Kings chapter 13
[1:46:55] said now Elisha was fallen sick of his
[1:46:58] sickness where he died and joash the
[1:47:01] king of Israel came down unto Him and
[1:47:03] wept over his face and said o my father
[1:47:06] my father the chariot of Israel and the
[1:47:08] horsemen thereof and surprisingly enough
[1:47:10] that's actually a very good compliment
[1:47:12] you know the my my father my father the
[1:47:15] chariot of Israel and the horsemen there
[1:47:16] I was a very honorable thing to say if
[1:47:18] you said it to your brother now they
[1:47:20] probably can get it but you know it's
[1:47:21] just that it was very noble thing that
[1:47:22] he he did a give him respect and
[1:47:24] everything and Elijah said unto Him take
[1:47:27] bow and arrows and he took unto Him bow
[1:47:29] and arrows and he said to the king of
[1:47:31] Israel put down hand upon the bow and he
[1:47:33] put his hand upon it and Elijah put his
[1:47:35] hand upon the Kings hand and he said
[1:47:37] open the window eastward and he opened
[1:47:39] it then Elijah said shoot and he shot
[1:47:41] and he said the arrow of the Lord's
[1:47:44] deliverance and the arrow of deliverance
[1:47:47] from Syria for thou shalt smite the
[1:47:49] Syrians and effect till they have thou
[1:47:52] have consumed them and he said take the
[1:47:55] arrows and he took them and he said unto
[1:47:58] the king of Israel smite upon the ground
[1:48:00] and he smoked thrice and stayed stopped
[1:48:04] and the man of God was wroth with him
[1:48:06] and said thou should have smitten five
[1:48:08] or six times then a stout smitten Syria
[1:48:11] till thou has consumed it whereas now
[1:48:13] thou shalt smite Syria but thrice joash
[1:48:19] the king did not have the mind of a
[1:48:22] conqueror he had the mind of a settler
[1:48:25] God wants to deliver Israel from their
[1:48:28] enemy in Assyrians
[1:48:30] he wants to drive them out it is God's
[1:48:32] perfect will you know we wonder
[1:48:34] sometimes this is a God's perfect will
[1:48:35] we knew it was God's perfect will
[1:48:37] because he sent the prophet Elijah to
[1:48:39] tell joash specifically that God wanted
[1:48:43] him to have victory over Syria so he
[1:48:44] knew without a doubt thus saith the Lord
[1:48:47] and it's a perfect will of God for them
[1:48:49] to have victory over Syria you know and
[1:48:52] if you think about predestination
[1:48:54] and people put a lot of stock on
[1:48:55] predestination per destination means
[1:48:57] that God said a will for you knowing
[1:48:59] that you would respond to you know God
[1:49:02] set a destiny knowing that you would
[1:49:03] respond to his word because Bob taught
[1:49:06] us that you know and the Bible says it
[1:49:08] as well that it's because of God's
[1:49:09] foreknowledge that he creates a destiny
[1:49:12] for you that he predestinated you you
[1:49:14] know it's a lot of people say I'm
[1:49:15] predestinated and they do nothing that
[1:49:17] proves they're they're not very
[1:49:19] predestinated because being
[1:49:20] predestinated means that you're going to
[1:49:22] respond to the word and the spirit that
[1:49:24] God pours out him knowing that he
[1:49:26] creates a destiny for you and so you
[1:49:29] know Elijah basically tells joash here
[1:49:33] what god's predestinated will is for his
[1:49:35] life it is to have victory over the
[1:49:38] Syrians and Elijah gives him a symbol of
[1:49:41] it and it's actually beautiful is his
[1:49:43] hands overtop of the Kings hands you
[1:49:45] know in other words you know God's
[1:49:47] prophet leading God's people into
[1:49:49] victory in it is a beautiful symbol
[1:49:52] there and Elijah clearly tells joash
[1:49:54] these arrows symbolize their victory
[1:49:58] over Syria you know there's nothing
[1:50:00] mysterious about it there's nothing that
[1:50:02] difficult to understand
[1:50:03] you know joash did really good when
[1:50:06] Elisha told him exactly what to do you
[1:50:10] know joash did really well when I'll
[1:50:12] actually told him every single detail
[1:50:14] take the bow and arrow
[1:50:16] he took the bow and arrow open the
[1:50:18] window he opened the window you know
[1:50:20] fire the arrow he fired the arrow he did
[1:50:23] really good with step-by-step directions
[1:50:25] of every single thing that he should do
[1:50:28] but when all I should tell him to take
[1:50:31] the arrows and smite upon the ground he
[1:50:33] doesn't tell him how many times this
[1:50:36] might he doesn't tell him how hard to
[1:50:39] smite it's a test of his character it's
[1:50:43] a test of his character he's already
[1:50:45] told them every other step along the way
[1:50:47] but he just says take the arrows and
[1:50:49] smite on the ground and so he actually
[1:50:51] reveals the character of the King in
[1:50:54] this moment is he gonna be a conqueror
[1:50:56] or is he gonna be a settler and
[1:50:59] unfortunately joash is a settler he
[1:51:01] takes he follows Elijah's instructions
[1:51:03] but he doesn't have the heart of a
[1:51:04] conqueror you know he takes a few swipes
[1:51:07] of the ground
[1:51:07] with the arrows and then he settles like
[1:51:10] oh I'm supposed to have a part in this
[1:51:11] okay well okay one two three is that
[1:51:16] good am I good and we done like the is
[1:51:18] that enough and you know that's his
[1:51:20] mentality he sees a very casual
[1:51:22] participant in this you know he said
[1:51:24] he's willing to go and do what he was
[1:51:26] told but he doesn't have any passion for
[1:51:28] he doesn't have any desire for he
[1:51:30] doesn't have the real heart of a
[1:51:32] conqueror there you know it so he takes
[1:51:34] to me he smacks him on the ground a few
[1:51:36] times and he thinks I must have done my
[1:51:38] part you know I must have must have
[1:51:40] doing a good job here and then till he
[1:51:42] looks at it Elijah's face and Allah
[1:51:44] she's very angry
[1:51:46] Elijah's very angry is furious with him
[1:51:49] because he gets angry and he said he
[1:51:51] could have steps he could have he should
[1:51:53] have rather kept striking the ground you
[1:51:56] know he should have he should have known
[1:51:58] he was told this is God's deliverance to
[1:52:00] him and yet he's content to make a
[1:52:02] little progress and stop you know if
[1:52:07] he'd really caught the revelation if
[1:52:08] he'd really caught you know what Elijah
[1:52:10] was telling him you know he should have
[1:52:12] taken those arrows and beat them till
[1:52:15] there was nothing left because you know
[1:52:17] you know he said you mean this this
[1:52:19] country of Syria that's been oppressing
[1:52:22] us and have been making us so miserable
[1:52:24] and making us so you know you know
[1:52:28] enslave and all of those things I have
[1:52:30] the opportunity to comment and these
[1:52:32] arrows represent my deliverance over
[1:52:34] them I'm just gonna bash them on the
[1:52:36] ground you know till my hand is bloody
[1:52:38] til the shafts are broke until you know
[1:52:40] the feathers are all falling out and
[1:52:42] then I'm going to turn to you and say is
[1:52:43] this all that's left of Syria and Elijah
[1:52:48] would have been thrilled and God would
[1:52:49] have been thrilled because it would have
[1:52:51] shown that inside of him he caught the
[1:52:53] revelation that that conquering is till
[1:52:57] that enemy is destroyed not until the
[1:52:59] enemies got a couple bruises not until
[1:53:02] the enemies you know oh we better give
[1:53:03] up now but until that enemy is
[1:53:05] completely destroyed you know if we take
[1:53:09] God's Word to heart today every service
[1:53:12] we sit here the ministry is putting the
[1:53:14] power of God's Word into your hands to
[1:53:17] smite the enemy you know just like
[1:53:19] Elijah did here I said this is
[1:53:21] what you need to go to have victory over
[1:53:22] the devil this is what you need to do to
[1:53:24] have victory over your own self this is
[1:53:26] what you need to do you know to to get
[1:53:28] yourself in that place where the devil
[1:53:30] doesn't know what to do with you you
[1:53:31] have everything you need to completely
[1:53:33] destroy Satan out of your life but so
[1:53:36] many times we just take a few small
[1:53:38] swipes you know so the preacher says you
[1:53:42] know you can have total deliverance just
[1:53:43] keep pray and just keep claiming that
[1:53:45] just everything so we claim it a couple
[1:53:47] times you know we claim our healing a
[1:53:49] couple times we claim deliverance a
[1:53:51] couple times and then we stop just like
[1:53:53] Josh did and we say yeah oh okay I guess
[1:53:56] that's probably good enough well did you
[1:53:58] get here deliver it yet no but you know
[1:54:00] I kind of stopped claiming it you know I
[1:54:02] you know I didn't work the first couple
[1:54:04] times you know it did didn't seem to
[1:54:05] have the effect that I thought or I
[1:54:06] tried it for a while but that's not
[1:54:09] that's not what God's telling us to do
[1:54:11] you know get a little victory you know
[1:54:13] and then subtle again into your routine
[1:54:15] God's telling us to keep pressing until
[1:54:17] that enemy is completely destroyed
[1:54:20] you know I myself I don't really enjoy
[1:54:23] combat sports but you know I've seen a
[1:54:25] few clips of MMA fights and maybe some
[1:54:28] of you brothers have as well but you
[1:54:30] know it's quite a brutal sports mix
[1:54:32] mulcher mixed martial arts and and you
[1:54:35] know the pictures and stuff that I've
[1:54:37] seen that you know sometimes there's
[1:54:38] blood spattered all over the canvas when
[1:54:40] they're done you know people aren't
[1:54:41] bleeding and being punched and kicked
[1:54:42] and all of these things
[1:54:43] sounds wonderful I know but you know
[1:54:46] really that principle of it is that the
[1:54:48] match only stops when someone surrenders
[1:54:51] or goes unconscious you know and and it
[1:54:55] sounds wonderful it sounds like a very
[1:54:57] very Christianly thing to discuss you
[1:54:59] probably haven't seen violence like that
[1:55:01] since the last time the coffee boys
[1:55:02] played basketball but but but we we know
[1:55:07] that you know it's you know the
[1:55:09] competition is intense and it's fierce
[1:55:11] and and you know all of these things but
[1:55:13] the only because the only way to be to
[1:55:16] win is to beat on your opponent until
[1:55:18] they give up or knock them unconscious
[1:55:21] once the winner the person that you know
[1:55:23] wants to win the most you know gets into
[1:55:26] a dominant position and an MMA fight
[1:55:29] they they start throwing punches and
[1:55:31] kicks and they keep going often on
[1:55:34] till the person is completely
[1:55:35] unconscious and the ref actually has to
[1:55:37] stop to fight you know it sounds brutal
[1:55:39] it it sounds horrible you know but they
[1:55:42] they don't pin their enemy to the ground
[1:55:44] and then give them a couple little slaps
[1:55:45] and stop and you know look at the
[1:55:47] replica can I stop now like this is good
[1:55:49] you know because they would be giving
[1:55:51] their enemy an opportunity to get back
[1:55:52] up to gain an advantage on them to you
[1:55:55] know to to turn the table so to speak
[1:55:57] but you know they don't just you know
[1:55:59] smack around the guy a little bit
[1:56:01] no they punch and they punch and they
[1:56:03] punch until he looks lifeless you know
[1:56:06] and really you know you're probably
[1:56:07] thinking like this is how did this get
[1:56:09] into church but you know it says vicious
[1:56:11] and brutal you know it's not the kind of
[1:56:13] thing that we think about in our
[1:56:14] Christian life where everybody's so nice
[1:56:15] and God bless you and pat you on the
[1:56:17] back but when it comes to the devil
[1:56:19] that's the kind of ruthlessness that we
[1:56:22] need that's the kind of ruthlessness
[1:56:24] that we need because God is telling us
[1:56:26] really it's kill or be killed in this
[1:56:28] situation because the devil is certainly
[1:56:30] not going to give you a couple little
[1:56:31] swipes and then say well I guess he
[1:56:33] learned his lesson today you know if we
[1:56:35] look we look at Jobe God gave him space
[1:56:38] and he took every bit of space that he
[1:56:39] could you know every opportunity he had
[1:56:41] and that's what he does to us too many
[1:56:43] times is that whatever space God will
[1:56:45] give him he will take it and so we have
[1:56:48] to set that same kind of approach to him
[1:56:49] we get the devil on the ropes we get the
[1:56:52] devil on the ground we have an
[1:56:53] opportunity to be beaten on that devil
[1:56:55] it better not just be like a whoa I
[1:56:57] think I see a little welt there we're
[1:56:58] gonna stop devil that's probably you
[1:57:00] probably learned your lesson today but
[1:57:01] no we want to keep pushing and pushing
[1:57:03] and pushing our advantage until there's
[1:57:05] nothing left of that devil we want to
[1:57:07] keep hitting him and hitting him
[1:57:08] anything and not just until you know we
[1:57:10] get tired not just until you know we
[1:57:13] think he's had enough but until the
[1:57:14] referee until the great referee says you
[1:57:16] know that's enough you've conquered that
[1:57:18] devil keep hitting him until he's
[1:57:22] completely shattered you know sometimes
[1:57:23] we do that we just strike a couple
[1:57:25] little blows but we have opportunity to
[1:57:27] drive his kingdom completely away from
[1:57:29] our life drive him completely out of our
[1:57:32] home you know not just get a little bit
[1:57:33] of space a little bit of breathing room
[1:57:35] but drive them completely from our lives
[1:57:40] we have examples of godly men who would
[1:57:42] not settle you know one of those men we
[1:57:45] talked about last night and and I had in
[1:57:47] my notes again to read this some of you
[1:57:49] weren't here last night so let's just
[1:57:51] read this again but Paul is such an
[1:57:56] incredible example to me because he
[1:57:58] fought through so many things and yet he
[1:58:01] had just as much passion to keep doing
[1:58:03] it again you know we think about how
[1:58:06] many times we would still be willing to
[1:58:07] get up off the mat so to speak how many
[1:58:09] times we'd be willing to give it another
[1:58:11] shot
[1:58:11] but he just he just kept going and going
[1:58:14] and going as I mentioned last night I
[1:58:15] didn't read this scripture last night
[1:58:17] but you know when when God called Paul
[1:58:19] out of you know his false doctrine out
[1:58:22] of being a Pharisee and called him to
[1:58:24] walk in and to testify of Jesus Christ
[1:58:26] you know he didn't hide from Paul that
[1:58:29] it was he was gonna be challenging you
[1:58:31] know and had a nice gets sent to him and
[1:58:32] Hananiah says lord I have heard well
[1:58:37] some reason that I didn't get to make my
[1:58:39] notes and a nice answer said Lord I've
[1:58:42] heard by many of this man how much evil
[1:58:44] he had done to thy Saints at Jerusalem
[1:58:46] and here we have authority from the
[1:58:48] chief priests to bind all the call on
[1:58:50] thy name but the Lord said unto him go
[1:58:52] thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto
[1:58:54] me to bear my name before the Gentiles
[1:58:57] and kings and the children of Israel for
[1:59:00] I will show him how great things he must
[1:59:03] suffer for my sake you know Paul was
[1:59:06] going into a situation none of us would
[1:59:09] sign up for brother Gerald and I were
[1:59:10] talking a little bit at breakfast this
[1:59:12] morning we think of you know the great
[1:59:13] victories and and things that brother
[1:59:15] branham did or we think of you know many
[1:59:17] of the people and all their testimonies
[1:59:19] and we think that oh man to have
[1:59:21] testimonies like that to have visions
[1:59:23] like that to have you know all these
[1:59:25] supernatural things must have been so
[1:59:27] wonderful and then you realize the
[1:59:29] suffering and the difficulty in the
[1:59:32] battles that it took to produce those
[1:59:34] things and suddenly our excitement about
[1:59:37] walking in their shoes tends to taper
[1:59:39] off a little bit but we read this again
[1:59:41] tonight second create the in chapter 11
[1:59:44] Paul's talking about his own life he
[1:59:46] says are they ministers of Christ I
[1:59:48] speak as a fool I am more in Labor's
[1:59:51] moribund
[1:59:52] and stripes above measure in prisons
[1:59:54] more often in deaths oft both of us
[1:59:58] one death would be good enough but Paul
[2:00:00] had several deaths we know stoned to
[2:00:02] death raised back up to go and do it
[2:00:04] again you know of the Jews five times I
[2:00:07] received I forty stripes save one thrice
[2:00:10] was i beaten with rods once was i stoned
[2:00:12] thrice a chef suffered shipwreck a night
[2:00:14] in a day I've been in the deep in
[2:00:17] journeyings often in perils of water in
[2:00:20] perils of robbers in perils by my own
[2:00:22] countrymen in perils by the heathen in
[2:00:24] perils in the city in perils in the
[2:00:26] wilderness in perils in the sea in
[2:00:29] perils among false brethren in weariness
[2:00:31] and painfulness in watchings often in
[2:00:34] hunger and thirst in fastings often in
[2:00:37] cold and nakedness beside those things
[2:00:41] that are without dye which cometh upon
[2:00:43] me daily the care of all the churches
[2:00:44] who is weak and I am NOT weak who is
[2:00:48] offended and I burned not he went
[2:00:53] through all of that and yet this is his
[2:00:56] testimony not as though I had already
[2:00:59] attained either we're already perfect
[2:01:03] but Paul you've you've got a Hall of
[2:01:07] Fame list of legacy that you left behind
[2:01:09] you've you've got so many things surely
[2:01:12] God would let you in the kingdom surely
[2:01:13] you know you've done enough surely if
[2:01:16] you've you've got you know a long list
[2:01:18] of accomplishments here you could if
[2:01:20] there's anybody that can rest on those
[2:01:21] it's you Paul and he says not as though
[2:01:24] I had already attained either we're
[2:01:27] already perfect but I follow after if
[2:01:30] that I may apprehend that for which I am
[2:01:33] also also am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[2:01:37] brethren I count not myself to have
[2:01:40] apprehended but Paul you look at all
[2:01:42] these things you did Paul but acting out
[2:01:45] not myself too about behavior but this
[2:01:47] one thing I do forgetting the old Paul
[2:01:49] no we want to remember those things we
[2:01:51] went up lift them we want to want to
[2:01:52] celebrate them not forgetting those
[2:01:54] things that are in the past which are
[2:01:57] behind and reaching forth unto those
[2:01:59] things which are before I press toward
[2:02:02] the mark for the prize of the high
[2:02:04] calling
[2:02:04] God in Christ Jesus they said if there's
[2:02:07] anybody that should have been able to
[2:02:08] say oh we're just gonna sit back and
[2:02:10] wait till Jesus comes it was him and yet
[2:02:14] he says I don't count any of those
[2:02:15] things I don't count any of those things
[2:02:18] you know and I think of brother Browns
[2:02:20] life you know 50 years old he's laying
[2:02:22] in bed one morning thinking if I'm ever
[2:02:24] gonna do something for the Lord I'd
[2:02:26] better start now and you think what look
[2:02:27] at all the things that brother Browns
[2:02:29] done already if I'm ever gonna do
[2:02:30] something for the Lord I better start
[2:02:32] now what is that that's the heart of a
[2:02:34] conqueror who realizes it doesn't matter
[2:02:36] what the past victories are it only
[2:02:38] matters what the next challenge is it
[2:02:40] only matters how much further we can
[2:02:42] take it huh how much higher we can reach
[2:02:44] and so you know Paul is conquered again
[2:02:46] and again and again and again he never
[2:02:48] settled and it's not because Paul's a
[2:02:51] great man it was because Paul had the
[2:02:54] Holy Ghost and so when Paul looked at
[2:02:58] the sum of all of these things he said I
[2:02:59] didn't do all of this God did this it
[2:03:02] was God's grace that brought me through
[2:03:04] every step of the way it's God's grace
[2:03:05] that's led me to this place and so it's
[2:03:08] not because I think that it's good
[2:03:10] enough it's because I know that he still
[2:03:12] has a work to be done he still has a
[2:03:15] higher height to reach he has a deeper
[2:03:17] depth to go and so because of that and
[2:03:19] so Paul says the next verse he says let
[2:03:22] us therefore as many as be perfect be
[2:03:26] thus minded be less might have what
[2:03:28] minded just like he said I press toward
[2:03:30] the mark and if in anything you be
[2:03:32] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[2:03:35] this unto you and I love that that he
[2:03:38] says that you know he doesn't say if any
[2:03:40] of you have a different mind then you
[2:03:42] know too bad about you I guess it's not
[2:03:44] for you but he says that if anyone else
[2:03:46] has otherwise minded God shall reveal
[2:03:48] even this to you
[2:03:49] you know maybe we've come to a place a
[2:03:51] lot of years down the road a lot of
[2:03:53] water under the bridge a lot of miles
[2:03:54] that we've traveled and we say oh you
[2:03:56] know now we're just waiting for the
[2:03:58] rapture you know now we're just sitting
[2:04:00] back and one day it's gonna take place
[2:04:02] and it's gonna be glorious well Paul's
[2:04:04] telling you that God wants to reveal to
[2:04:06] you it's not as though you've already
[2:04:08] apprehended it's not as though we've
[2:04:11] already reached the goal and now we're
[2:04:12] just sitting back twiddling our thumbs
[2:04:13] waiting waiting for the train to pull
[2:04:15] into the station but there's still more
[2:04:17] for us to conquer there's still more
[2:04:19] witness to be shared there's still more
[2:04:21] more souls to be prayed for there's
[2:04:23] still more things that we need to keep
[2:04:25] pressing into and it doesn't come and
[2:04:27] just fall in our lap we've got to go out
[2:04:30] and fight for it we've got to go out and
[2:04:31] battle for it if we think that the
[2:04:33] devil's gonna have compassion on us
[2:04:35] because we're a little older than we
[2:04:36] used to be who were a little more tired
[2:04:37] than we used to be no he doesn't have
[2:04:39] any more compassion you know he's got
[2:04:41] more armies lined up than ever before
[2:04:44] brother Bram talks about dueling with
[2:04:47] swords and he says in in the breach he
[2:04:49] said the swords he's talking about two
[2:04:53] men that are fighting with swords and
[2:04:54] they're both strong and they're both
[2:04:55] capable he said the swords if they lock
[2:04:58] the enemy and you lock swords like this
[2:05:00] and you've crossed your swords he said
[2:05:02] then it takes the strength of the man
[2:05:04] dueling because his sword we pointed to
[2:05:07] my heart and might any and mine to his
[2:05:09] but they're locked as our knives
[2:05:12] striking each other and they strike and
[2:05:14] his swords come together and the one can
[2:05:16] shove the other one down the sword
[2:05:18] straight to the heart so it takes even
[2:05:21] though the sword be the word it takes
[2:05:26] the hand of strong faith to hold it
[2:05:29] there to bring it to the heart of the
[2:05:31] enemy brother branham was given the
[2:05:35] Kings sword he talks about that just
[2:05:37] before the quote today the part that I
[2:05:39] read but the sword of God's Word is not
[2:05:41] just in brother Brown's hand it's in the
[2:05:44] hand of the bride today that same King
[2:05:46] sword is in our hand today from Almighty
[2:05:49] God that word of God you know didn't
[2:05:51] leave one brother Bram left and suddenly
[2:05:52] when the church has no strength but no
[2:05:54] we have great strength but it's gonna
[2:05:57] take a hand of faith that's willing to
[2:06:00] hold it to the heart of the enemy who's
[2:06:01] willing to keep it crossed up there with
[2:06:04] that enemy until God gives us the
[2:06:05] strength to press it all the way to his
[2:06:07] heart because that's the position or
[2:06:09] head that's the battle that we're in you
[2:06:12] know and it's too late to get distracted
[2:06:14] it's too late to get you know to get
[2:06:16] tired and just say oh you know well yeah
[2:06:19] I guess we've come far enough no we got
[2:06:21] to keep that sword in place do we have
[2:06:24] the strong head of faith to bring it to
[2:06:26] the heart of the enemy or do we say well
[2:06:29] who is a good fight thanks devil can we
[2:06:30] make a kind of
[2:06:31] here now you know we've both given it
[2:06:33] our best you know how about we just you
[2:06:35] know we'll just agree to disagree here
[2:06:37] and we just form some kind of a treaty
[2:06:39] no we need to keep pressing we need to
[2:06:43] keep pressing last scripture is part of
[2:06:47] the what we read you know he says who
[2:06:49] shall separate us from the love of
[2:06:51] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[2:06:52] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[2:06:54] peril or sword and then he says as it is
[2:06:57] written for thy sake we are killed all
[2:07:00] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[2:07:02] for the slaughter that sounds negative
[2:07:03] it sounds like the devil is just gonna
[2:07:05] beat you up and and kill you and you
[2:07:07] can't do anything about it and that's
[2:07:09] why he says nay he said nay in all these
[2:07:14] things we are more than conquerors
[2:07:17] through him that loved us
[2:07:20] we're not accounted just as sheep for
[2:07:22] the slaughter we're not just there for
[2:07:24] the devil to beat on us that you know go
[2:07:26] into the kingdom as martyrs that you
[2:07:28] know they sacrificed their lives but the
[2:07:29] Bride of Christ is called to be more
[2:07:31] than a conqueror no more than a
[2:07:34] conqueror through him that loved us it's
[2:07:36] not our strength that we're depending on
[2:07:38] to put the sword to the enemy's heart
[2:07:39] you know we know the only one strong
[2:07:41] enough is our Lord Jesus Christ but
[2:07:44] we're the ones holding the sword he gave
[2:07:47] us the strength he gave us the word and
[2:07:49] everything else but he put the sword in
[2:07:50] your hand believing and knowing that you
[2:07:53] can push it into the heart of the enemy
[2:07:55] how is the bride more than a conqueror
[2:07:58] because it says that you are more than a
[2:08:00] conqueror
[2:08:01] well how is she more than a conqueror
[2:08:04] because every conqueror that's ever
[2:08:06] lived has died you know look at every
[2:08:09] gate great Conqueror Alexander the Great
[2:08:11] or Genghis Khan or Napoleon or whoever
[2:08:14] that went out they had a beginning of
[2:08:16] their conquering and they had an end
[2:08:18] where they died some of them died in
[2:08:20] humiliation some of them died by disease
[2:08:22] some of diet in interesting
[2:08:24] circumstances but there's one that will
[2:08:26] not die this bride is a conqueror that
[2:08:29] will never die she's going into a place
[2:08:31] where she's gonna have an eternal reign
[2:08:33] you know an eternal victory because
[2:08:36] every great woman and great man has died
[2:08:38] but this bride is gonna go into eternal
[2:08:41] life she is more than a conqueror she's
[2:08:43] more than a conqueror of the Dead
[2:08:45] she's more than a conqueror of death
[2:08:47] she's going to be one that reigns an
[2:08:49] eternal Kingdom an eternal king the
[2:08:51] first and a thousand-year millennium and
[2:08:53] then in a new Jerusalem for eternity
[2:08:55] so the question Conqueror or settler
[2:09:00] which one are you going to be which one
[2:09:03] are you going to be you have a choice we
[2:09:04] always have a choice you know we always
[2:09:06] have a choice to take the medicine or
[2:09:08] not take the medicine you know to be
[2:09:10] better off or or to be worse off and and
[2:09:12] brother Brown told us that that you
[2:09:14] never come to church and leave Church
[2:09:15] the same way he came in
[2:09:16] you know you might come in and you think
[2:09:18] oh you know well I'll just be the same
[2:09:21] person whether I choose to believe it or
[2:09:22] not but worried they're closer or
[2:09:24] further when we walk out you know and I
[2:09:26] trust the night that we're a little
[2:09:27] closer because we realize yeah okay I'm
[2:09:30] gonna keep fighting I'm gonna keep
[2:09:31] pressing you know it's not over yet yeah
[2:09:33] you know I might be a little bit late in
[2:09:35] the game I might have you know been a
[2:09:36] little slow to to jump and take my
[2:09:38] position but there's still time and
[2:09:40] there's still place and God is still
[2:09:42] cheering us on from the Bannister's of
[2:09:43] heaven saying keep going keep going and
[2:09:46] in our heart there's a there's an echo
[2:09:47] of a spirit that just says keep going
[2:09:49] keep pressing you know don't worry about
[2:09:51] the situation that don't that doesn't
[2:09:53] look good
[2:09:53] don't worry that you're lost loved ones
[2:09:55] not gonna be time for them just keep
[2:09:57] pressing just keep fighting that devil
[2:09:59] and let God's victory take place you
[2:10:01] know it might not be the way we think
[2:10:03] you know I have an expectation for my
[2:10:05] own life my own health man I sure like
[2:10:07] it to be a certain way but whatever the
[2:10:08] battle goes we're just gonna keep
[2:10:10] pressing one way or the other we're
[2:10:12] gonna be press in one way or the other
[2:10:13] and whatever it takes now no matter how
[2:10:15] long we're more than conquerors because
[2:10:17] he told us that's what he put inside of
[2:10:20] us you may not stand today
[2:10:32] we've been given arrows of deliverance
[2:10:35] we've been given a mighty sword and by
[2:10:39] God's grace we've been given the power
[2:10:41] to use those things lord help us to take
[2:10:44] them and to be mighty in Victoria don't
[2:10:46] point them at your brothers and sister
[2:10:47] you know no sword fight with your
[2:10:49] brothers and sisters put that sword to
[2:10:51] the heart of the enemy let's bow our
[2:10:53] heads Lord Jesus father a simple thought
[2:10:57] Lord and I I know that it takes your
[2:10:59] spirit to deal in our hearts Lord and to
[2:11:02] tell us where we've been settling where
[2:11:05] we've been relaxed where we've been
[2:11:06] complacent and so we could see the
[2:11:09] opportunity that we have Lord to to
[2:11:12] change those things father to to tighten
[2:11:14] up our lives though to get more
[2:11:17] enthusiasm lower to get a more zeal and
[2:11:20] to comment and take the word that we
[2:11:22] hear Lord and let it encourage us to go
[2:11:24] in and fight a little harder to win
[2:11:26] deliverance in our lives to win
[2:11:27] deliverance in our homes law to to focus
[2:11:30] on what really matters I pray Lord that
[2:11:33] you would just bless the people here
[2:11:34] abundantly with a stronger and a greater
[2:11:37] passion to to keep fighting lower this
[2:11:40] world that they live in this province of
[2:11:42] Newfoundland Lord maybe they've talked
[2:11:44] to many people they've witnessed and
[2:11:47] done those things but Lord you said that
[2:11:49] you put us as a city on a hill not that
[2:11:53] one that cannot be hid and that you want
[2:11:56] that witness and that testimony to go
[2:11:58] out from us every day you don't want us
[2:12:00] to to hide it you don't want us to to
[2:12:02] try to put the light aside but you want
[2:12:04] us to shine forth and Lord to be a
[2:12:06] witness in a world that continues to
[2:12:08] grow darker and and more saturated by
[2:12:10] sin but we want to stand for you Lord
[2:12:12] and we want to keep pressing as though
[2:12:14] we've not accomplished anything we're
[2:12:17] fresh on the battle battle field tonight
[2:12:19] load and we just ask
[2:12:20] lead us into battle Lord lead us and we
[2:12:22] might go and have victory for your
[2:12:24] kingdom father once you bless each one
[2:12:26] here with a greater abundance of
[2:12:28] yourself and Lord may we be able to just
[2:12:30] continue to keep pressing and fighting
[2:12:32] each step of the way in Jesus name

[2:18:56] don't you give in don't let it get you

[2:19:03] know because sometimes that's the next
[2:19:04] thing you know Sunday night or Saturday
[2:19:06] or whatever day you come to church
[2:19:08] Wednesday you feel all excited you're
[2:19:10] ready to go all where's that devil at
[2:19:12] but when trouble comes knocking at the
[2:19:14] door and you're not ready you didn't
[2:19:17] invite trouble over and trouble comes
[2:19:19] knocking at a door we start to get a
[2:19:20] little nervous sometimes but don't give
[2:19:23] in you know it's not like before it's
[2:19:25] not like last time and the mistake you
[2:19:27] made here and the you know place you
[2:19:29] fell down you know the second verse says
[2:19:30] so hold on you're getting stronger every
[2:19:33] day and there's no reason for you to go
[2:19:36] astray
[2:19:36] don't be leaning on your understanding
[2:19:38] lean on him and we'll all say we've been
[2:19:41] made more than conquerors I've seen that

[2:20:44] keep you standing too long and to
[2:20:48] continue on with the service but the
[2:20:51] temptation is there so will yield not to
[2:20:55] temptation had the grace of God a man
[2:20:59] but yeah we always just to welcome our
[2:21:01] brother Phillip and sister Susan it's
[2:21:03] been a while since we we've seen them
[2:21:05] god bless you amen and dag and and all
[2:21:10] the rest of course and our we've our
[2:21:12] brother Karsan sister Sharon's been
[2:21:14] absent from us for a while and so the
[2:21:18] Lord blessed bless us all and draw us
[2:21:20] together as one body of Christ by the
[2:21:23] grace of God but again concerning the
[2:21:26] word and the message tonight it was the
[2:21:28] Lord amen reminding us again concerning
[2:21:32] God's plan and God's purpose and God's
[2:21:37] pattern amen
[2:21:39] when it comes to God's plan purpose and
[2:21:41] pattern in the creation of the heavens
[2:21:44] the earth and the creation of man and so
[2:21:48] also there was a plan there's a purpose
[2:21:50] and there's a pattern so I pray God that
[2:21:53] help us through the word tonight Elvis
[2:21:56] to recognize God's pattern more than we
[2:21:58] had before that our God deals with you
[2:22:01] and how God deals with me amen and our
[2:22:05] brother brought it out and the and in
[2:22:09] fact there was some note that I had
[2:22:11] written here in my Bible that our
[2:22:13] brother our brother brought it out in in
[2:22:15] his prayer and it was it was concerning
[2:22:19] the Elijah and joash and so on and I
[2:22:23] would like to have fallen sick and and
[2:22:25] told him to do this and told him to do
[2:22:27] that he did you know when it comes to
[2:22:30] anything that just was just one thing to
[2:22:32] do you know and they opened the window
[2:22:35] open do they let's do that throw the
[2:22:37] arrow out and that was fine he did it
[2:22:39] but when it comes to smiting the need
[2:22:42] neither the floor smite the ground well
[2:22:46] that that would take a take what I had
[2:22:49] written
[2:22:49] here and our brother had brought it out
[2:22:51] there was the Lord in our brother
[2:22:53] brought it out in prayer and it would
[2:22:55] take what it would take zeal and
[2:22:58] enthusiasm a man and not his knowledge
[2:23:01] the old me of the window or the the
[2:23:03] firing of the arrows that way was a very
[2:23:06] basic thing that fir for him to do but
[2:23:09] when it comes to smiting the ground that
[2:23:13] was then it's going to take a little bit
[2:23:14] more energy a little bit more zeal
[2:23:17] little bit more enthusiasm more
[2:23:19] revelation in his heart he had to really
[2:23:22] come out of the heart not out of the
[2:23:25] mind you know putting the senses into
[2:23:27] anything into an action by opening a
[2:23:30] window or for firing the arrows no no
[2:23:32] but when it comes to smoke eating that
[2:23:35] takes something and I tell you brother
[2:23:37] God and God is God's working on us that
[2:23:39] way and I pray that we have the zeal and
[2:23:42] the the enthusiasm and the desperation
[2:23:45] by the grace of God now we're going to
[2:23:48] who are going to smite the devil amen
[2:23:51] and what do you mean smite the devil
[2:23:53] through the senses of our flesh because
[2:23:56] remember God's working in the soul by
[2:23:58] faith and the devil is working in our
[2:24:01] flash through its senses and amen that's
[2:24:04] the matter where we're eating to
[2:24:05] constantly day in and day out and it is
[2:24:08] the faith of God coming out of the soul
[2:24:10] into your spirit and fighting the senses
[2:24:13] of your flesh because Satan is working
[2:24:16] on that because remember that your body
[2:24:19] is not born again your soul is born
[2:24:21] again but hide your body amen that's
[2:24:25] still in sin and Satan is working on it
[2:24:27] but but I pray the grace of God that the
[2:24:30] power from within the new creature in
[2:24:33] Christ Jesus rises up in your spirit a
[2:24:36] man through then through your spirit
[2:24:38] it's God controlling the senses of your
[2:24:41] flesh bringing it subject to the word
[2:24:44] amen and we've got to have that zeal and
[2:24:47] that enthusiasm that desperation by the
[2:24:49] grace of God to yield to him and follow
[2:24:53] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:55] so that's tremendous and our brother was
[2:24:58] bringing out again about judges
[2:25:01] brother again we need to be mourn it's
[2:25:04] the word it's not over yet we're in the
[2:25:07] battle and we're still pressing on by
[2:25:10] the grace of God we've still got a
[2:25:11] battle of faith because when Joshua led
[2:25:14] them into the Promised Land the Bible
[2:25:17] speaks of the incomplete victory of
[2:25:19] Judah and unless Anna speaks of the
[2:25:22] incomplete victory of Benjamin the
[2:25:25] incomplete victory of Manasseh and
[2:25:27] others in in going into the Promised
[2:25:31] Land and our brother brought it out
[2:25:33] because they were content you know just
[2:25:35] to be friends with thee with the others
[2:25:36] there oh I pray Lord he'll help us to
[2:25:39] get the revelation of what was preached
[2:25:41] tonight
[2:25:42] amen that we're not going to be content
[2:25:44] with this content with that oh well
[2:25:46] we're in the land now no no you're in
[2:25:49] the land but you've got to possess all
[2:25:51] of it and control all of it but they did
[2:25:54] they they didn't they were in the land
[2:25:56] they didn't possess at all and it didn't
[2:25:58] control it all and that's right that's
[2:26:00] why they win it went after their gods
[2:26:03] amen and begin to worship their gods a
[2:26:06] man and and he said right here if I
[2:26:10] could just bear with me a moment here in
[2:26:16] the book of Judges he say he our brother
[2:26:21] referenced it here and or he brought it
[2:26:25] he brought some of these things out and
[2:26:28] when it comes to yeah Samson Samson and
[2:26:32] Delilah and the prophet of God said
[2:26:34] Samson give his heart to a woman but he
[2:26:36] said he just give us strength to God
[2:26:38] Amen so brother we got to give our heart
[2:26:42] and our strength to God everything has
[2:26:45] got to be under God's control and
[2:26:47] because they have the incomplete
[2:26:49] victories that they had won even in the
[2:26:52] promised land there's what to take
[2:26:54] absolute control of it
[2:26:56] amen but they didn't do it because of
[2:26:58] incomplete victories it'll lead to
[2:27:00] confusion it led to a civil and a
[2:27:04] religious confusion amen it was civil
[2:27:07] confusion politically because there was
[2:27:10] there were
[2:27:10] Tribes of Israel there were the other
[2:27:12] nations pagan nations then we're there
[2:27:17] and they ran there and irrigated
[2:27:20] becoming friends with them brother
[2:27:22] you've got to be careful you could have
[2:27:24] a right spirit of right attitude but
[2:27:26] don't go too far with it don't get too
[2:27:27] involved with it
[2:27:28] amen when it comes to the world the
[2:27:30] things of the world don't you do that
[2:27:32] amen because it could be a trap of the
[2:27:35] devil
[2:27:35] amen - you know you're a Christian so so
[2:27:38] you gotta you got to do this you got to
[2:27:40] do that we got to take our stand for
[2:27:42] Jesus we got to remain separated onto
[2:27:45] the Lord and let's not get involved in
[2:27:47] the King in the civil and religious
[2:27:49] confusion of the world amen
[2:27:52] we are separated we are going into a
[2:27:54] Indian to rapture by the grace of God
[2:27:57] amen
[2:27:58] don't don't do it and again I ministered
[2:28:02] on eight years ago ten circles where
[2:28:05] they are ten circles that a shirt that's
[2:28:08] why that's what I live in a Levite or
[2:28:11] Levitical priest solace is convictions
[2:28:15] for and his absolute stand for God for
[2:28:18] amen and he when he was s what that's
[2:28:21] what this this Jew played him it's so
[2:28:24] that you could come and be part of my my
[2:28:26] house whole part of my religion but he
[2:28:28] was also a pagan the man was was serving
[2:28:31] other gods but he went got this Levite
[2:28:34] and he persuaded him to come and all you
[2:28:38] you represent Jehovah for me and the
[2:28:40] others here these idols they represent
[2:28:43] these gods trying to please the world
[2:28:45] and the please God and he paid this
[2:28:48] Levitical priest he paid him ten shekels
[2:28:51] and a shirt and so I have Anita day are
[2:28:55] going to sell them their faith absolute
[2:28:58] separation on the Lord to the Lord I'm
[2:29:00] going to separate sell it out for ten
[2:29:02] shekels and a shirt and we are going to
[2:29:05] sell it out for the world and the things
[2:29:08] of the world or the friendship of the
[2:29:10] world brother it is total separation as
[2:29:14] our brother brought out concerning Paul
[2:29:16] as tremendous not as so we've already
[2:29:20] attained are already perfect
[2:29:23] they are Souls we are in our flesh were
[2:29:27] not and the war continues till we walk
[2:29:31] till we step from time to eternity in a
[2:29:34] glorified body and we're battling
[2:29:37] fighting what this flesh wants so are we
[2:29:40] living for the flesh are we living for
[2:29:42] out of the soul is it the soul I trust
[2:29:47] by the grace of God we are living out of
[2:29:49] the convictions of our soul the new
[2:29:51] creature in Christ not what the flesh
[2:29:55] wants we're reaching out to bring the
[2:29:57] flesh subject to the soul a man and the
[2:30:01] leadership of God the Lord bless you the
[2:30:04] Lord bless our brother Brandon thank God
[2:30:06] for the word again tonight and I pray
[2:30:08] the Holy Ghost will be able to bring it

[2:30:16] to bring to our remembrance well you

[2:30:27] but again God permitted that even there
[2:30:32] in Israel he said and the anger of the
[2:30:36] Lord was not a gate was hot against
[2:30:38] Israel because that this people has
[2:30:41] transgressed my covenant which I
[2:30:43] commanded their fathers and have not our
[2:30:46] cannot to my voice I will also not in
[2:30:49] short drive out any from them of the
[2:30:52] nations which Joshua left when he died
[2:30:54] that through them I may prove Israel and
[2:31:01] through what surround us with your jobs
[2:31:04] in your families your friends sometimes
[2:31:07] through these God is going to prove God

[2:31:15] keep the way of the Lord to walk therein
[2:31:18] as their fathers did keep it or not
