the revelation of his word amen amen amen he revealed justification and revealed sanctification amen that was good praise the lord amen and and they're going to be judged by that faith in that day in that hour but brother then then there came another and another anointing then there came another revival and god would god reveal himself in a greater way praise the lord see their their entering into

the lord god bless you turn with me to the book of romans chapter 4. sorry to keep you standing but again sometimes we we go we go to just natural things of life and we stand longer than this amen that's right sometimes people stand for them for an hour for this an hour for that they're in there they're in the things of the world so brother let's go let go and let god have his way take and we'll stand as long as he wants us to stand amen and amen in romans chapter 4 and beginning to read at verse 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he had we're off to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness amen now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly amen is faith is counted for righteousness amen praise the name of the lord so what does god see your righteousness amen well no i'm a sinner and so on yeah but you're saved by grace through faith amen so the righteousness he see in is faith your faith believe us thou this amen so again verse five to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify at the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so how much of righteousness has god seen us today almost righteousness is god's seeing you today brother it's based on your faith he's looking for faith believe us thou this amen verse 6 even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works amen but righteousness will produce works amen amen it's not the works producing righteousness it's the righteousness producing the works oh don't think well i just believe and i just go on because god god sees my faith and amen and he knows i believe yeah but if you believe you're going to go forth and it's going to be manifested in your life oh yeah it's going to reflect amen the word was made flesh to redeem us spiritually now the words make flesh redeeming us physically taking us from time to eternity taking us out of these bodies into glorified bodies amen by the grit to change us by the grace of god so again he said in verse six even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works thank god amen through and it's through christ saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin amazing this is amazing grace hallelujah and cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or he said upon the uncircumcision also yes circumcision and on circumcision amen because it is by faith for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness amen it's not what i do here and do there it's what i'm believing amen and it's to stand that i'm taking for the truth the stand that i'm taking for the word of god amen so again verse 9 cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness it was his faith how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision amen because what god was looking for and what god saw in abraham was faith and what god is looking for in us is faith amen hallelujah that we believe god that we love the lord that we believe his word amen praise the lord brothers just let god see that faith in you of what god has done what god is doing and what god will do amen so does god see that in that faith in you that you believe it i believe god did this thank you lord i believe you're doing this thank you amen i believe you're going to do this thank you jesus amen brother this is the righteousness that god's looking for amen but brother there are those that believe yesterday that but they can't recognize what god's doing today and they don't they don't believe what god's going to do tomorrow no no or they think oh yeah it's up the road it's always up the road amen brother god it's our faith that brings it into the present tense amen brother regardless of what god promised regardless of what god prophesied amen he's going to he's going to raise up his seed what for with faith to bring the word into manifestation amen hallelujah oh brother brother whatever god prophesied in justification he raised up luther amen to bring it into manifestation he raised wesley for the other he raised the pentecostals amen to believe the word that he was going to reveal in that hour but you know what he was doing he was building up faith he was oh yes increasing faith increasing faith oh justification sanctification amen all glory until he would bring in a generation that would be justified sanctified with the holy ghost yes they would have access to the gifts of the spirit amen but lord where are we going from here we're not we're not going to stay here justification we're not gonna just stay here sanctify we're not gonna just stay here and experience the gifts amen lord what else is there amen it's pointing us on to the resurrection and the rapture amen what's it doing brother we came from eternity and god's doing this to oh yes to get our attention and we're going to access this oh it's it's eternal amen brother it was justification it was eternity in luther eternity and wesley eternity in the pentecostals amen and the others amen and now brother it's eternity in the bride praise the lord hallelujah and brother is moving from the heart it to the spirit and it to change us completely soul body and spirit amen oh glory so brother what faith are you are you believing god to give you now i tell you what faith do you need now oh i need the faith for this i need the faith for that brother look into the word of god and see where we are living amen and to see what god has promised for the hour that we're living in oh lord you you promised this you did this oh yeah lord i thank you for what you did in luther and wesley and the pentecostals how many are in the world now are recognizing what god is doing now oh god you do this you did that what are you doing now well according well according to the word what else is there what what what's according to the plan of god amen where are we brother when we consider the scriptures oh yeah justification saying to the case and baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit where are we now almost we must be on our way to eternity we're going back amen brother there was a generation that believed justification and lived it amen and on them to the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost and they lived it amen but now all that's fading away that's almost i'll tell you this you're the generation that i'm ministering to now brother that you you don't have much understanding of what god did back there not the understanding but you don't see much of it not now that's practically all gone oh yeah brother the power the anointing and the revival that i experienced back there years ago in pentecost as a young man brother it's not there now because i remember brother in those meetings and and just saying oh it was powerful and the anointing was there but because that's what god was doing god was still in it amen praise the lord but there came a time when god moved out of it into the revealed word oh yeah he moved out of it now i remember being in pentecost and of course that church is not not used now and and of course it was quite a size then and maybe almost 1500 people would be able to gather there on a sunday and and there would be several hundred to gather there on a wednesday and i would be there and i listened i remember the power of the anointing of god moving the spirit of god moving among us amen oh yeah and and even even the young teenagers and i remember that we would go down into the basement and because down there was was the sunday school rooms and everything and oh the power of god in in a wednesday service but they praise the lord the anointing was there they were worshiping they were hallelujah and and i remember there there was a number of all my maybe 40 or 50 teenagers and i was one of them we got down there and we started them we started to move around the basement and we walked and walked and walked and walked and praised the lord praising the lord young people yes teenagers amen you're gonna you're not gonna thank god for the young people here in this church because i tell you this there's a lot of churches don't have young people anymore they don't have teenagers anymore because as they reach a certain age they got into the world amen but back then brother we were we were all pedic all just to teenagers and we just well maybe for an hour or more and the the older the elders will be up up up in the main auditorium we'd be down in the basement and brother just walking around and around and around and praising the lord amen we weren't just sitting there as teenagers and talking and carrying on and joking and all that no we were praising the lord oh i can remember now the building i can remember going down the steps i can remember now going and going in into the area where all these sunday school rooms were and there was a there was an auditorium there amen oh yeah even down there and we were as teenagers we were going around and around and around praising the lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus amen praise the lord the anointing was there praise the lord but of course it's not it's not there now like it used to be not by any maids but brother but there was that anointing even among the message believers years ago but again that's not there like it used to be amen because it's come to the place now brother where could you look up yes hey because i'm hungry for it i'm thirsty for it but amen where's the anointing oh yeah there was a time when i would even preach to among believers in other believers churches and oh my it was the congregation it was full and and hell what a crowd was there oh my praise the lord it was tremendous amen but then it started to cool down and cool down and cool down oh yeah and now and eventually the church the church congregations got smaller and smaller and smaller yeah brother i pray grace that we're going to keep we're going to stay in the faith amen i pray grace the faith is going to stay in us amen that we're not going to move on brother i pray god that the whole that the devil is knocking out going to influence us as he influenced the third and fourth generation in the lutherans the third and fourth generation in in the methodists and the pentecostals amen and other revivals after the third or fourth generation they were gone back into denominational spirits amen and there's many there's many a church today around the message that's just a denomination amen they got denominational spirits amen they don't have the holy ghost like it was when they first started not by any maids brother because i could give you the history but i want and then i show you what what god started and what happened what god started and what happened amen well yes but because god was moving by the spirit and then sometimes even even in even in a funeral service there was the power of god the anointing of god amen and i remember a funeral service that i that i was asked to not administer altogether i was just asked to to control the service and and lead in the song services introduce this introduce that and so on and and then to bring it to a conclusion and and sing and sing and sing amen even even when they were taking the the the coffin out and the church that i was in at the time was full and it could have been maybe two or three hundred people amen and after and i remember after the service and we were we all walked out and we're we're going to go to the funeral or the cemetery and there were others came to me and they said excuse me i said yes they said just want to let you know they said and they were not believers just want to let you know that that this is one of the best services i ever experienced say what yes i've never experienced a service like this i've never experienced a church gathering like this i've never experienced this at a funeral like this he said this is tremendous he said thank you oh i said well do god be the glory well he says i just want to let you know he said that i felt that it was tremendous amen oh yes and then they were they weren't even christian wasn't even christian no but he said it's good he appreciated it amen why they were there because the person that died he died of a heart attack amen he was a believer and the person that died amen used to work with them and he and and they knew him oh yeah he had that oh yes he said that's what he was like his his spirit was good amen it was christian so god elbows brother and sister amen and i in our stand for the gospel in our stand for the faith in these last days brother go and reflect jesus go reflect god go reflect the blessed hope amen go and reflect the faith the faith amen that god wants to reveal in this hour as he did luther there was a faith that luther went forth oh hallelujah and there were so many thousands that believed it and honored wesley and there was more that believed it but the pentecostals all it also says you know what the power of the anointing was so so great when it comes to the pentecostal revival and the restoration of the gifts that it went around the world and it shocked the world that's the truth it went we went further than bennett and then luther went further than wesley went further than all the others amen but the pentecostal and the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen oh it has such an influence and strike all around the world amen why because god was getting to the place where he's going to call the bride praise the lord to god be the glory brother amen sorry to keep you standing amen you can you can be seated amen see let's go back to verse 9. grace and he cometh and he said cometh this blessedness or rather verse 8 it says blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin that's tremendous amen it is it is the man with faith it is the man that believes what god has given him to believe in that day and in that hour amen so do we do we have the faith that god wants us to believe in this day and in this hour well is it going to be different from what from what this one had or that one at it's going to be what luther had plus what wesley had plus and what the pentecostal said plus amen unto light to the fullness of the word is revealed to give us the faith that we need to get out of time and into eternity amen because all down truth all down through the old testament there were there was by grace through faith abel offered unto god the more excellent sacrifice amen but again it went on and then by grace through faith god did this by grace through faith he did that to this one to job and and isaiah and jeremiah amen and on and into malachi amen and what did it produce it produced the the redeemer it brought jesus christ on the scene amen god was reflecting jesus and lee and abel god was reflecting in the in the prophets amen unto finally the word was made flesh in jesus amen to redeem us physically amen and then god came down in the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost and he began to reflect amen the revelation of jesus in the first age the second age all down to the to the last age amen until he would come for the resurrection and the rapture for the bright amen and again let me say it again to redeem us physically praise the name of the lord understand that i have been redeemed spiritually but now god has given us the revelation of redemption physical amen brother as he came down himself amen and flesh to reflect it he came down into himself in flesh to show redempt we well he didn't need to he didn't need spiritual redemption but he did it for you and me amen he laid down his life for you and may but then he picked it up again brother is not just oh yeah they all answer the old testament what did they do as abel did abel laid down his sacrifice a lamb and they laid down this and laid down this now we know brother abel had faith cain had wisdom oh yeah cain knew oh yeah they knew this they knew that and abel knew this and abel knew that and cain knew this and cain knew that amen but brother abel had faith and that's why that's why that that it produced the sacrifice amen of the lamb but cain never had that faith cain had wisdom again but he never had faith no so you you might have the wisdom of the word and you might have the wisdom to know this and to know that amen oya cain knew that god would require a sacrifice god they knew that god would require this oh he felt god should have this or should have that oh yeah because you know we we were we were this adam and eve was this and oh yeah and they sinned and now look where we are and so on so this is what cain was going to do and like i said he offered all these things but abel oh he just he just didn't agree with that he couldn't he couldn't he couldn't comprehend that at all amen now understand he knew that he knew that god required a sacrifice amen but he was going to give him what you know what he was growing in the field give him this and give him that and he didn't think that abel was doing right and going out to take a lamb and kill the lamb and let all the blood go air and there he went and killed abel yeah he wouldn't kill the lamb but he killed abel oh my brother sister god help us amen let's keep our attitude right in our spirit right amen toward one another but just just consider that and whether we could go on and administer that concerning the spirits they they came on cain and the spirit that was unable amen look look at the look of the results that they brought in cain's life and look at the results that they brought in abel's life so brother when it comes to the spirit that's in your life when it comes to the spirit that you have amen what what what's it producing in you look what it produced in cain look what it produced in abel amen look what it produced in the producing enlightened lot look what are producing this one and that one and in in adam amen noah yeah god help us brother it's good to have this and good to have that wisdom yeah but let it let it what about the faith is going to produce amen i know this and i know that amen oh yeah we think that's all we got to do is know it and just say acknowledge this and acknowledge that but let it produce faith yeah the word brother without faith it is impossible to please god amen and faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word amen sister that's right praise the lord that's a faith that pleases god it's not just the idea that that i believe in god and i believe there is a god and i believe god did this and i believe god did that but what's god doing oh god's going to do this what's he doing amen one generation after another they said god did this and god's going to do this god did this god's going to pass and future but they could not recognize god in the present tense amen what is god doing cain oh yeah the past tense revelation and the future tense was there everything to be all right now and i'm going to offer this as a sacrifice to the lord amen but abel it was different yeah it was going to be a blood sacrifice and that blood sacrifice go on to another one and on to another one amen pointing to jesus oh yeah but cain didn't didn't see that cain didn't understand that brother what do we understand what do we see amen what did luther understand what did luther see amen i tell you what luther saw brother there was the third or fourth generation of the lutherans that didn't see it no no because if they did they would have went on with wesley amen unless he saw it amen as i said that as i explained to you that wesley got the revelation he got in a cottage meeting that's right when it comes to sanctification he got that because why he was in a he was in a uh lutheran cottage meeting the brothers were where the the brothers that were having the cottage mean they were lutherans they believed god at saint luther they believed what god revealed through luther amen concerning justification they were preaching it preaching and preaching and that's why that's why that john wesley amen that he got the revelation the greater revelation oh sanctification justified sanctified amen praise the lord and he would move on to with with the baptism of the holy ghost as i said concerning the that preacher asked me one time and that brother's gone on now for a number of years and he wanted to know he said brother gerald he said did brother branham say anything about the salvation army and he said why he said did did god you know use the salvation army he said is there anything did prophet say anything i said yes he did just think that brother was an older brother and i thought for sure he would know the message i was shocked when he when he when he asked me that question and i said you don't know what the prophet god said no he said i don't know i was shocked and yet he was a he was a preacher and he had an evangelistic ministry and he preached practically all around the almost around the world and he preached around america in the united north america south america and in the united states and oh it's amazing i said you don't know no he said i just just wondering i was going to ask you he said do you remember the prophet saying anything about the salvation army and i said yes he did and i told him oh he said i didn't know that now that i said that the pentecost had organized or the the methodists are organized so quickly that god raised up william booth with red hot salvation he said to take them on to the pentecostal baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen brother we've got to recognize what god does we're gonna recognize what god did what god is doing amen by the grace of almighty god oh my brother and again there are saints that again in going through the messages there last night and i was saying omar this is amazing i said this was 1953 that the prophet of god was saying this and he was preaching this and saying this oh i said he's recognizing i said that he that he's he's maybe not exactly saying what he should say preaching what he should preach and he acknowledged that we said oh my ministry he said it is not what it should be oh i said what and he said oh yes no he said i should should do this i should do that i didn't do this i didn't do that yeah but then by the grace of god god started delayed on his on his on his heart what he needed to preach and what he needed to share with us the burden that he needed to give the revelation that we needed amazing oh yes and where where is where did you find that too right here in this in this book called hebrews huh it's there in this book that he explained oh yeah the change in his ministry that was coming by the grace of god amen he felt that he that he should should do this but he didn't do it he should have done that he didn't and it should have preached this and he didn't no because he didn't understand that he didn't catch that but eventually god began to reveal to him on into the opening of the word seven seals brother god help us amen wisdom good but what about faith what about faith wisdom is one thing i'll tell you this the one that highlights wisdom is the devil huh oh he does oh yeah the prophet of god said that's the devil but he said faith is god amen he said as it was in the garden of eden he highlighted that and he said go back to the garden of eden and he said god had given the word to give them the faith that they needed but is the devil come down he said what for he said to share wisdom oh yeah yes god said i know this and i know that you know this and you know that brother don't let the devil trick us into just putting the emphasis on the letter of the word we need the spiritual revelation of the word amen to know the motive and the objective that god had in saying what he said doing what he did amen revealing what he revealed amen brother it wasn't just to give us a knowledge oh i want you to know this i want you to know that he wants us to experience this he wants us to experience that not just to know it just too many got the knowledge of it too many god this revelation this idea in essentially an intellectual revelation amen oh yeah i know this and i know that yes but they don't have the spiritual revelation in their hearts so she's to recognize what god is doing in them you recognize what god is doing in the word amen brother sister you're in the message oh thank god again for it but the prophet said the message is not in you i already know that because all they were it was in their heads and they knew this and they could they could say that oh yeah the the bible says this is it this is it but brother brown was referring and putting the emphasis on the life that they were living amen brother are we not not becoming intellectual are we becoming more and more spiritual there's a lot of intellectual believers but i'm but there's very very few spiritual believers spiritual yeah they're not putting the emphasis brother on on on the just the letter of the word it's the spirit of the word that's influencing their everyday living let's see in the church in the in this series on the hebrews let me share with you uh he said oh brethren he said let me stop here for a minute he said no matter he said how much the word is preached he said how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of the word it won't do you one bit of good amen brother when the minute the ministry of the word you've got to partake of it you've got to eat it you've got to let it digest amen brother again it's like i was in a with a certain preacher one time and his wife and myself sister betty was there and uh i won't say where it was but uh and they did i administered and they they just took took my stuff and sister betty out for a meal and while we're we just had a wonderful meal there and and his wife oh my she she ate a full plate and uh oh amazing she got some appetite and but oh yeah she ate it but then she got up and went to the washroom i said oh what's wrong and her husband said oh she's she's gone in now she's going to throw it up i said what don't do what oh she's going to throw it up i said what was she sick no no he said she'll just put her finger down her throat and and she'll bring it up because she don't want to gain the weight i said what oh i said what did she eat it for oh she she liked it she liked the food she said but she don't want to stay down i said i never said to him but i said lord i said i said that's the devil i said why in the world i said that's crazy where in the world would a woman do that i said don't make sense she didn't live long she didn't live very long after that she died a young young woman it doesn't surprise me no brother but brother where's god because god she had god in her head but she never had god in her heart amen brother let's let's let's go and let god have his way to stop this foolishness of the world amen i don't care what it is what part of your life is going to affect and influence amen stop the foolishness of the world brother let's be god in simplicity amen by the grace of god and again as i said oh yeah he said oh brethren let me stop here for a minute no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of that word it won't do you one bit of good amen well it's like that sister eat full food loved it then throw it up brother that's like people doing spiritually oh i like this preach breaks breaks breaks yeah then they're going to throw it out when they go at the door they throw it up that's the truth i'll tell you this brother if they're digesting it in their souls amen as you digest natural food it becomes a part of your body amen you're going to your brother you're going to reflect it in in your everyday living and brother it's asking the natural and in the spiritual the same thing you're going to eat eat the food of god eat the word of god and you're going to digest the word of god amen in your soul amen it's going to glorious it's going to come out and it's going to amen it's going to reflect in the life you live spiritually so again let me say are you religious or you're spiritual again let me highlight that i did show you the quotes where the prophet god said you are religious but he said you're not spiritual he said you are in the message but he said the message is not in you make your calling and election short make sure you're in the message is in you exactly amen because if the message is in you you'll leave himself out through you amen it's not through your head your your tongue and brother we got we got to live it not just talk it walk it not just talk it and there are many that just talk the message but they're not they're not going to live the message they're not going to walk the message talk talk talk talk talk oh yeah to me it's like again like that sister oh she can talk the message oh believe the message thank god for the message and then go then go and eat a food meal and then go in and throw it up deliberately what was in control it wasn't god it was her pride amen pride was in control of your life is it god in control is it the word in control of your life is god governing what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it is god listen i don't care if even if it's your what you do in your home what you're doing in your fellowship what you're doing your job god in control as i've said before even when i was working in in in the retail business for a number of years and even into even into management and oh yeah they knew they just knew they would only ask me to do certain things and or just to avoid this avoid that they said well we know that you know you don't you believe this and that so on i said yeah oh yeah they respected my faith and they wouldn't they wouldn't expect me to do this wouldn't expect me to do that and there was times when they wanted me to do this why didn't we do that and it was i remember an issue one time and i said listen i said i said no no i said if you want to do that you do it but i said i'm not going to do it and they said oh i understand you know what they wanted me to do they want me to lie to a customer to leave the wrong impression with a customer no way i said you want me to tell them that i said that you're not being honest sorry i said not going to do it all case i understand even did it so brother you gotta reflect you're gonna reflect yes reflect your faith brother there's nothing you can do if you're you're born again there's nothing you can do without reflecting your faith it's going to influence your faith will you no matter who you're dealing with your family your friends your neighbors no matter who you're dealing with you stay with your faith amen don't compromise no don't compromise just for the sake of this for a sake of that don't you do that but i tell you because god sees it as a spirit of unbelief oh yeah god will judge you for it amen so brother sister god help us to be partaker of the word let the word be in control brother amen what for he said he's encouraging here to make sure the wisdom you got is mixed with faith hebrews chapter 4 amen he said unless you yourself are a partaker of the word it won't do you one bit of good you got to be a partaker of the word you got to eat the word you got to digest the word you got and if you digest it it's going to be in control yeah oh yeah your family knows it yeah as i said that that one time just one member of my family did challenge me on it but most of my family just they just respected it you know when as i said if they invited us to a certain gatherings birthday parties or whatever they they've called me and says brother gerald we want to do this would that affect your belief your faith we know that you believe this you believe that so we don't want to do anything that that would be contrary oh i said okay i said i respect you thank you oh yeah but again there was only one incident that i was challenged why because i i went and i fellowship so much with believers in that town and but i would only just drop by family and say hello and just have a little bit of short time fellowship with them and gone on to the believers yeah and they and they didn't like it i thank god yeah there was another member of the family there that took took a stand for me they did oh yes they did they knew i was being challenged and i would be put down and and they just stood up and said i said no that's their faith leave them that's their faith oh yeah they were respecting by the grace of god amen so brother sister if you're a partaker of the word i'll tell you this the word is in control whether it's you at your job whether it's you with family whether it's you with friends and neighbors the word's in control amen well they'll know there's believers there yeah oh they live across the road oh yeah they're believers they're christians as i've said we've had that our neighbors have testified of that to others oh yeah they said they did oh yes and they come to us and they said oh they said that you're you're christians and and you won't do this and you do this you you're there to help oh i said yes okay i thank god for the for for the witness that we have been where we lived it was tremendous it did come back but if we didn't take the glory to ourselves we give the glory to god amen and amen and amen so he said brethren let me stop for a minute no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's preached unless you yourself are partaker of the word it won't do you one bit of good amen you've got to receive it you've got to digest it you've got to eat it you've got to submit yourself to it you've got to follow the leadership of the word the holy ghost amen everything you do no matter what it is amen brother it's all influenced by your your your faith yeah oh yeah as i've said when i worked in the department's doors and so on just faith and uh thank god to god be the glory that i did here after somebody came to me and said oh this is uh mr lush i don't know if you know this but he says there's a number of businesses in this area that have expressed their desire for you to work for them i said what me yes he said i've heard it he said i've talked to them and they they they said oh yeah but we we want him we would love him to come and manage this we would like for him the manager here manager in another store this store i said some right oh yes they said they really appreciate the stand you take i said well thank the lord to god be the glory amen why but i tell you this if you take your stand god will bless you oh yeah god will bless you when most definitely don't think you know i got to do this i got to do that no you just leave that with the lord amen god want to put you down put it and put you down but i'll tell you this you take your stand for him he'll lift you up he promised it amen so brother the bible says that what this one did or that one did the gospel preached he said did not profit them not being mixed with faith he said in them that heard it brother so the gospel the message of the hour it may it can't prosper you if it's mixed with faith and you're receiving it into your heart into your soul thank you lord hallelujah and when you go out the word goes with you the words in control you can't get away from it amen the anointing amen no matter no matter what you do where you go and who you're going to meet you're going to you're going to reflect jesus you don't have to be talking about jesus but just that your spirit and your attitude is going to be christly oh yeah not that you're going to talk about christ not going to talk about the word it's just that your attitude and your spirit how you're going to act in in this situation are you going to react in that situation you're going to deal with this you're going to deal with that you're going to deal with it as a christian would they might might they might have to come and say what are you a christian so some have expressed that about other believers and say because they know by the way you act not what you're saying is what you're doing there are those that say it but they don't do it there are those who go and talk faith but they're really not going to live it and i'll tell you this do you know the unbelievers out there recognize that they do it's right brother they recognize it they know that you can talk it but you don't live it oh my god have mercy have mercy lord listen again he said the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hurt it whether they got the wisdom of the re of the letter of the word but they don't have the faith out of the heart they got it in their heads but not in their hearts if it's in their heads they love jesus oh yeah amen they respect jesus and and they don't want to offend jesus they don't want to offend his word they don't want to offend any of his children so you're going to go forth and just just live according to the leadership of the holy ghost but now don't think because i know there's a lot of believers think that they got to be talking the word they got to be you know talking about jesus talk about that no no you don't have to talk it walk it and you you're there you're in the spirit so that when if there's a time comes that god wants you to talk and you'll talk it but brother there's times when god don't want you to talk it he wants you to walk it amen because i tell you it's not what you're going to say it's going to influence that person it's the lady you live amen well yes they're gonna they're gonna recognize that now what you're saying is is what you do as i've said that we've had neighbors tell others oh that that couple there they're christian they're what oh yes they're christian but again i never told them that we were but they just knew the way we acted and so on and and when we put one of our houses one time we had there we put it off for sale and this uh one of the ladies that lived there her daughter wanted wanted to get a home in that area and she was appointed to her daughter she said oh right there lo she says good wonderful and she said he's a pastor pastor's wife lives there what a pastor yes she said pastor oh no no no no she said i'm not going to buy that house no why she said he's a pastor yes she says considering she said what i would do in that house she said i won't want to do it god bless her oh yes she said considering she said what i would do and what i would allow she said no no she wouldn't do it she wouldn't buy it amazing well god would respect her for that every attitude was right and her spirit was right because she she respected the ministry so she wouldn't go in there and and do this and do this and do that in that house so god be the glory amen bro that's right oh god help us to reflect jesus i tell you we weren't myself sister baby we didn't go around being religious and just showing off this and tell them about god tell them about the lord tell them about jesus no no we just live the life everyday living but they recognize the influence and they appreciated it so i said thank the lord and we'll give the glory to god amen listen again he said that the word preached did not profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith the word preached behind this pulpit amen whether it's your servant your pastor whether it's our brother jonathan or brother mark amen the word ministered won't profit you if it's not mixed with faith yeah we can get up and minister the word of god and you can say yeah sounds good in your head or in your heart you've got to be in your heart you've got to recognize it in your heart you've got to let it come in and feed your feed you on the inside of the inside amen amen amen praise the lord hallelujah oh yeah whether whether if i'm listening to brother mark or if i listen to brother jonathan minister i'm not here i'm not listening to it up here it doesn't stay here it just goes on down into the heart the prophet god said that that's where you got to receive the words in your heart but there's a lot of people just getting it up here oh yeah they come in get the word go out and leave it behind they leave the word behind yeah but as others they come in receive the word take it with them amen and brother hallelujah and they're not outside but they'll the word of the holy ghost should bring the word to their remembrance again amen then they get home and the word and the holy spirit are bringing to their remembrance again maybe they're going to work or maybe your young people going to school or university amen and there's not nearly a day hardly a time but the holy spokes is the holy ghost is going to bring the word to your remembrance you'll never get away from it amen brother i thank god for the for the education that i had and where where i was educated in that in that school that i was in and so on and and even even the other students would acknowledge they said uh general well you're just different said i am oh yes they said we know we know just you don't you don't get involved in this you don't get involved in that and that but again they knew eventually that it was it was my christian and as i said even one teacher that came up to me and he said and that teacher he always referred to all of his students as mr and miss miss he said mr lush he said you know you're going to be a pastor i said oh i don't know i said the lord knows i said lord willing that's in his ass oh yes he said you're going to be a pastor and he wanted to know where i was going to take it to take my training he said are you going to would you go to memorial university for training i said i said no brother i'll leave that with the lord i said that's in god's hands not mine oh yes he said okay and i remember years ago several years later many years later that i was in in the avalon mall there and i and this this man came over and greeted me that teacher he was he was much older than but he knew me i didn't know him oh yeah he was right there again spiritual god bless you and he and he when i told him about the church i always said i knew that i knew he'd be a pastor i said you did oh yes yeah and i remember one time he was having he had that that that teacher he also had a bible class back in school then they don't have it now but then they had a religious class and just uh teaching this and teaching that well most most uh schools did have it and he and i remember one one day i came in a bit late i was late and uh and when i he was already going through his already into his class and the religious class and when i got in and sat down he said oh he said mr lush he said welcome he said you're going to be late for the judgment i said i hope so okay he said that's good yeah so they he respected me so i pray god rest his soul yeah yeah and i did express to him what i felt because he certainly his church believed a certain thing and taught a certain thing and i said well i said a scripture says this oh he said i never heard that before he was shocked he said thank you thank you now he said i didn't understand i said okay amen now he's his wife he didn't go along with what i was saying but he did praise the lord brother i pray grace that what you believe you've got it mixed with faith spiritual revelation not just intellectual knowledge spiritual revelation in the heart it's not what you believe here it's what you believe here because what you believe here is to control what you believe here amen the anointing comes out of the heart into your spirit into your mind praise the lord but there's many they have the anointing in their heads and in their minds but not in their heart no you can have the anointing in your in your head you can have the anointing in your spirit but not in your soul the prophet of god warned us of that he said make it make sure he starts in the heart thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee grace amen the word in the heart in control by the grace of god not in the head because in the head or you can just bypass it no no grace brother make sure the word is mixed with faith in the heart not just knowledge in your head listen not being mixed with faith it didn't work he said they sing the miracles of moses he said that's pretty good he said they walked over they've seen seen him perform miracles and they seen the pillar of fire and he said heard them talk about it but he said it wasn't mixed with personal faith it didn't have the influence that god wanted to have in their lives as soon as they got to the wilderness he said they began to murmur and complain and god said because they doubted it was sin don't doubt nothing he said believe don't doubt no matter how hard the case is believe it but they begin to murmur and god overthrow them in the wilderness amen but with whom was he grieved the bible says for forty years was it not with them that sin whose carcasses fell in the wilderness amen brother there are those that come out under the revealed word die under it but not saved yeah i've experienced much of that over the years many a so-called professing believer died but i don't think they went to heaven what was the problem it was their spirit it was their attitude maybe their reaction yeah it was contrary to the word contrary to the message of the hour brothers make sure your spirit is right make sure your attitude is right do you have the spirit of jesus do you have the attitude of jesus would they think that you were jesus how close would you how close would you be in your character like jesus brother sisters if we believe in the resurrection and we're believing in the rapture we're going to have the spirit and the attitude and the character of jesus it took that spirit that attitude that character to lay down his life and to pick it up again and lord is going to take that spirit and that attitude and that anointing for the right for the for the rapture it took that takes that spirit to change us spiritually and that's going to take the same thing to change us physically he came down 2 000 years ago and was made flesh oh yeah and the word was made flesh and dwell among us and the word did this the word did that discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and the word came down was made flesh in the bride and he did this did this did this yeah just think of the ministry that was revealed in the prophet it wasn't william branham it was jesus no he didn't do that through all roberts he didn't do that through the other evangelists the signs and the wonders of miracles under pentecost oh no this was the calling of the bride in the bright age and it was jesus that had come down to receive us unto himself to redeem us physically he came down and redeemed us spiritually and he came in us amen bringing us all onto the resurrection rapture for the redemption physical into glorified bodies amen but the problem of god got up and as i've said he come to the pulpit and many times and he would say now he said this is not me it's not no he said i can't do this and he couldn't he said this is jesus that's right it wasn't like oral roberts or or the other evangelist and they would get the sick and they would pray for the sick and sometimes they'd only be there to give a prophecy or whatever for that person but here come a prophet discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart amen past present future amen declaring healing oh yeah signs wonders and miracles but it wasn't like an evangelist it wasn't like he needed the five full ministry no no it was beyond the fivefold ministry it was jesus because he the problem god kept repeating and kept highlighting to us this is not me said i can't do this he said i got to get out of the way so he can do it brother get out of the way so he can he can live the life that he wants to live in you get out of the way yeah so he can be the witness that he wants to be in you reflect jesus not religion you're not going to just reflect the church reflect jesus amen by the grace of god listen the problem is he said it is not mixed with personal faith for as soon as they got to the wilderness and they begin to murmur and it says they doubted he said it was sin don't doubt nothing please let's not doubt what god has done don't doubt what god's doing oh well god sent a prophet yes but there was more to it than that there was the opening of the word there was a revelation of the mystery of god in these in these last days the revelation of our lord jesus christ for the res for the for the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of god brothers is he giving us the faith for the rapture what are we putting the emphasis on what are we really believing for what are we really looking for i trust by grace we're looking for the rapture we're looking we're expecting the change physically brother make make your calling election short make sure you've got to change spiritually amen oh yeah make sure you change your change from the inside because if you're if you're not changed from the inside you won't be changed outside we're going to be changed from the inside out it's god working from the inside out praise the lord see he's working in your heart in your soul in your spirit and through your mind to bring this to bring the flesh subject to the word whether it's justification sanctification wesley the pentecost gifts of the spirit and the baptism of the holy ghost brother until finally he's taken absolute control of the body to change it from time to eternity oh luther was was justified praise the lord and he went and then he preached and he preached and he preached the the lutheran the methodists were sanctified and they preached and preached and preached but they weren't looking up as i said they were looking they were just going here going there yeah the salvation army and the pentecostals oh they went and they preached and preached and preached oh my oh my what revivals they had but i'll tell you this the bride revival now is not moving here moving here doing this doing that now look up all the others they just moved on moved on moved on do this do this preach it here preach it there but the ro there rises a generation hallelujah and god gives the revelation to look up because redemption is at hand it is finished if we were if we were living back in the pentecostal age we'd be we wouldn't be looking up we'd be just going here going here preaching this preaching oh come on come on this is what god has done this is what god has done now we want to preach this is what god's doing look up you've got to look up if you want the rapture you want to be changed you've got to look up because our faith is not in here here here our faith is here come on lord i feel the pull by grace amen he said please don't doubt nothing believe don't doubt no matter how hard it the case is believe it amen but again it says with whom was he grieved forty years and he said was it not with them that had sinned doubted whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and all of them that came out of egypt only two went into the promised land of the original generations that came out of egypt two went to the promised land he said listen out of the whole antediluvian world in the days gone by there were eight souls saved out of billions straight is the gate and narrow is the way but few there be that find it that's the truth he says some people say brother branham what about all these thousands that the bible said will appear just remember how many has died in each generation that's been christians down through the ages he said they'll all resurrect that makes up the body he said you expect there be hundred a hundred billion in this america come out he said of this world they said no he said there might be 50 come out of america 50. grace i'll tell you as time goes on it's going to be less and less and less it's going to get fewer and fewer and fewer because it becomes more and more religious to them but not spiritual brother we got the wisdom god give us the faith we got the knowledge but do we have the faith oh yeah you can have the knowledge of what god's done the knowledge of what god's doing but do we have the faith to look up amen god did this god did that god is doing this god's doing that so what what effect should it have on you and on on me well it should bring us to the place bring us to the to the revelation that it's over it's finished now lord but look for the rapture every day looking for the rapture every day looking for the change of our bodies remember don't leave it with god he left it with us god came down and give the word now it was up to able to able to go and fulfill the work up to able to go and do what god revealed to him amen brother now it's up to us to go and do what god has revealed to us how how does it control you does it influence you god help us let me say again he said you expect that there be a hundred billion in this america he said in this world today but he said there might not be 50 come out grace in the name of jesus grace to us brother that's in the hebrew series maybe in the 1950s i believe it was so god help us brother that in this hour god has given us wisdom to give us the faith we need for the resurrection and rapture brother it's not just a focus on what they've done in previous ages it's the focus on what god is doing amen there's still too many that are focusing on what god did yeah well pentecost yes or focus on what god did in in in the ministry of a prophet malachi 4 the first poll the second poll but what about the third poll the third poll is rapturing faith it is yeah go read the go read or listen to the message that he preached on the rapture 1965. the third pull is rapturing faith so he said he left it yeah and not long after that god called him home why because he got to the place where he knew the first pull was done the second pull was done the third pull was was done now he said here i do here i go he said back into evangelism why because he had he administered the word of god when it comes to the first poll in his ministry and the signs and the wonders signed his and the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart past present and future and then the opening of the word amen so it was all done it was all finished the third poll was over for him amen but not for the bride that's why after it was all done all over with in 1965 he said here i go he said back into evangelism yeah and god took him home why because now the emphasis was on the word and the calling of the bride grace brother we have the wisdom of god but grace to give us the faith that god is looking for brother wisdom versus faith grace grace grace he said when he preached this sermon on wisdom versus faith you see he said what is the wisdom we're talking about he says something that will not agree that all this word is the truth it is something that will take away from the truth expressing itself as a higher knowledge more wisdom no he said and if wisdom of that sort come from satan is children lived by that wisdom and he said if the wisdom of that sort and he said if the faith of god came through god and he said god's children lives on faith the bible said the just lived by wisdom and they said the congregation said no he said the just lived by faith amen not what we can learn but what we can believe amen he said let's take wisdom first wisdom has reasoning but faith has no reasoning wisdom has reasonings now he said what are we doing trying to do this morning follow what the lord said lay out food you're going to need it one of these days lay up food and this is where he come to preach this wisdom versus faith he said the lord told me to lay out food it's because you're going to need it and we do after all those years we need it to know what god has done yes to know what god is doing we need to know and to know what god will do there's too many that are still focusing on what god did oh god sent a prophet god's not a prophet yeah what was he doing the prophet's gone what's he doing now oh well he sent the prophet revealed the word what are you doing with the word now we got to get into the word and getting into the word will give us the faith for the rapture grace to us he said what are we trying to do this morning follow what the lord said lay up food by grace amen to god be the glory listen he said the bible says the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die what was satan doing he was reasoning with eve and he was getting need to reason with the word and there's many trying to reason with the message no he said reason he said god is too good god's too merciful he loves you too much and you hear that same old devil today he said god's too good to do this god won't do this god won't punish he said he'll do just exactly what his word said he will do believe it he says you shall not surely die that's what he said to eve see what she's trying to do he's trying to get her to reason with him in a minute that you reason on god's word then you're losing faith he said don't have no yes knows maybe he says stay right with it he said eve had the right approach but she listened to his reasoning so he said there's just so many people today he said that has the right to knowledge he said that knows that this word should be god's word and it is god's word but they stand and let some seminary student he said reason them out he said reasonings he said we're cast we're to cast down reasoning amen now he said what's started these things he said in the garden he said it was reasoning the enemy the devil getting eve to reason he said faith has no reason he said you don't reason at all but faith you believe you leave it with the lord amen everything that can be presented contrary satan will do it and he'll try to reason you can't do it you leave it with god he said don't reason he said believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe stay with the word amen but eve she responded to the devil she said oh she said we'll die and he says surely god won't do that but he knows what you'll be wise to putting his wisdom against god's word he said there's the wisdom i'm talking about he's a wisdom against faith he said there's the battle the first battle and god's word held steady and true when they partook of the forbidden they died brother don't reason just believe the word amen he said what does wisdom do wisdom oh he said now you know we couldn't do that in this time we must do it anyhow he said tries to wisdom is trying to find an easier way amen it tries to make the bible say things that it does not say oh yeah wisdom the better way the modern way an easier way stay with the word he said wait just a moment he said what was it the devil tried to do with wisdom make god's word say something that it didn't say and he said so that's the way it comes today amen when brother don't reason there are those that take the message of the hour they're still taking the word of god and reasoning to justify what they want to do you got to follow god's leadership stay with the word he said when they try to make god's word say something that it doesn't say well i'll tell you brother branham you ain't got the right interpretation the bible said the prophecy is of no private interpretation he said why ain't it of private interpretation because the word of the lord came to the prophets it is interpreted by the prophet not a private interpretation no the prophets already interpreted to you and he said there it is written right there that's the way it's supposed to be amen god's way amen praise the lord he said god's thoughts is as eternal as god amen and he said that ain't skim milk brother and he said this sauce is what he was that's you too and he said what's your thoughts he said our is what you are no matter what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are and he said you might go along and act like a nice fellow but in your heart you are an adulteress or whatever it is that's what you are your thoughts amen and god's thoughts was his word and that was him in him and it was god so brother the enemy is there to control our thoughts but let god control your thoughts let god keep your thoughts and in line with his word let god keep your thoughts under the control of his word amen let the holy ghost control your thoughts by the grace of god amen so lord help us is my prayer and again there's many other thoughts concerning wisdom versus faith god help us to stay with faith if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let the devil pervert it if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let the devil add to it if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let the devil take away from it he's there to add a word or take a word amen god help us don't reason believe he said look at cain and abel he said abel was going by faith but cain wisdom he said like his mother he took reasoning wisdom his own wisdom a beautiful sacrifice he had the flowers he had the fruit of the field and said surely god will receive my sacrifice i built a lovely altar i have it so pretty it's so decorated just like this easter will be and he said they'll spend he said millions of dollars across the nation to put easter flowers on some altars he said the altar wasn't made for flowers he said it's for sacrifice he said you just show the same old spirit of cain and he said it's the same old devil from eden oh yeah because there's under under the this easter and even thanksgiving days and so on they're going to fill the altar with beautiful things kill the altar with food and this and that and something else brother put yourself on the altar amen that's what god wants you it's not what oh you can do this you can do oh this is nice lord thank you all the vegetables you're going to grow all this you're going to get all you're going to do it might be close whatever no put yourself on the elder god wants you so he can use you amen it's not using the vegetables he's not using the clothes he's not using that he's using you your life amen i'll finish with this praise the lord he said surely god will receive my sacrifice i built a lovely altar i have it so pretty it is so decorated and again he said just like easter will be and they'll spend millions of dollars across the nation to put easter flowers on some altars and the altar wasn't made for flowers he said no he said you just show that same old spirit of cain he said that same old devil from eden he said you know that the man was sincere because it meant life or death to him and then them people don't think they're hypocrites they're sincere he said listen that don't do it it's truth not sincerity you can be sincerely wrong yeah so what about the truth is it truth governing you today is the truth controlling you today is it because of the truth that you're here today yeah well there's there's still others that would come here they would come to church one time we had to deal with that and i remember there was a gentleman used to go to church here one time he doesn't go to any church now of course and when he went to the mainland he met believers from here and he's saint john's he said oh okay he thought they would go to this church and he said no no you didn't go to our brother's church no and he said why not although he wasn't going to church at the time it's not going to church now but still he was encouraging them that they should have come to the church here they said no they said that brother they said he got no sense of humor he says he won't even laugh and the brother said what might laugh he said it can't be the same one i know he said he's left with me and they said no wouldn't have nothing to do with because again i remember that quote that couple used used to be here and one time this year some years ago and uh they didn't go to church for a while but they did they couldn't take the ministry of the word and because uh and when they left his wife did call me on the phone and tell me later she said oh brother she said he couldn't take the word he said because she said oh we after after you preached he said we after the service we go out and we would drive around for an hour and he would be criticized and then talking about the what you preached i said what oh yes she said she said he just didn't like it and so on oh i said okay thank you but she she she appreciated it amen the word so so again brother sister i trust by grace we're coming not just to get all a good feeling well if you're if you're receiving it in your heart you'll feel good if you're perceiving it in your head no you won't feel so good you know god help us brother that we're going to be spiritual and be sincere not carnal not intellectual but spiritual brother abel was spiritual cain was carnal oh yeah grace that we're gonna that we appreciate the word so he said brother truth and sincerity is what we need praise the lord but he said listen he said people don't want to suffer and he said that's what's the matter today he should they come right now and believe this word if they didn't have to get out of their church if they didn't have to be laughed at made fun of no they want botany life some kind of a wisdom well this life is just as good as that well that's what if they feel but he said it's not he said i'll show you where that comes just in a minute he said the lord willing he said abel by what wisdom theology no he said abel by faith offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and by faith in what by faith he said in the word he said it was just his father mother him and his half brother how in the world could it be he said what did he have faith in he said faith in botany no faith in this or that no he said he had faith in the word because he wanted to know why he was out of the garden amen and god had revealed to him why and that's why he made the sacrifice he made but cain never had that full revelation that abel had amen that's why he came when offered the fruit of the field and what he had grown and so on on the altar brother god wants you to offer yourself give yourself to god give your life to jesus amen listen the mother would have to say because i listened to a lie of the devil because this boy here was born and he said that's why god put us out well he said i can't even get around the gate and he said there's a chair up there with a sword guarding that tree of life and so on and he says so by wisdom cain he said you know that not nothing the not knowing the word but just by thought by wisdom he made a nice place and made it pretty and beautiful but abel by faith he saw what was in botany life he saw it was a sexual affair through blood there you are brother wade over the top of that one time and by faith his children still sees it amen cain tried to make it nice pretty but abel was facing reality of what happened let's face the reality brother there's none righteous no not one physically in our new birth in our in our natural birth it takes an uber and then we're coming into the revelation of the righteous jesus he is our righteousness amen oh god give us that faith not just intellectual belief but that real faith that i well jesus and we read it in romans that he is our righteousness he is my righteousness he is your righteousness that's why we got to honor jesus re reverence jesus amen by the grace of god let jesus have control let jesus control your thoughts your words your deeds well well i just got to do all i gotta do is believe jesus believe that he was he was he was no he is amen not be was he is he's the same yesterday today forever not he was he is the same god help us by faith abel saw the revelation the vision and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood and he said life is in the stem of the flower and it's botany life which has no feeling and he said i was in hopes that this would soak him amen that came that the the cain was offering the things without feelings but abel was offering the lamb with feelings he said i was a man through wisdom going to understand and he said when the whole bible and the whole church of god is built upon the divine revelation by faith upon this rock i'll build my church amen finish with this satan's got more wisdom in that word than all the preachers thrown together he's got more wisdom than all the priests and everything he's got more wisdom but he can't have faith faith will make it live faith would make him repent will make him get away from his organization he's got wisdom so he just stays with the word amen god help us to have the faith that pleases god amen for without that faith it is impossible to please him grace that the word will strike us right amen again the thought from the messenger he said we see him meeting after meeting and sometimes we just sit just as cold and indifferent and say yes i know the scripture says it oh i've seen it done he said we have no enthusiasm it don't seem to strike us right there don't seem to be that something so he said listen he said taking a match and striking it if the match he said hasn't got the sulfur right on the head of the match it cannot strike and it's you can rake and rake and rake but he said if some chemicals has killed the sulfur he said it will not strike trying to light a match and he said there will be no light but if that chemical that sulfur is still on there when it strikes he said it will light and when the true genuine vindication of the scripture of this last day the message and you see the presence of jesus christ that you had heard what he done in his life and hearing the scripture say is the same yesterday today and forever and just before the sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of god see jesus return amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same thing he done my it ought to strike our souls to glory and it ought to do something to us amen praise the lord brother it ought to bring us into a rapturing faith for the glory of god amen grace that by faith the holy ghost controls you and controls me amen for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god i trust by grace you're here because the holy ghost led you here to hear the word today some was for this brother this sister something else was said for that brother or that sister i trust you were in the spirit to receive it for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry father father and the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god i trust the holy ghost is bearing witness with your spirit confirming that you are the sons and daughters of god that you are the seed of god by the grace of god amen lord bless you oh i didn't realize this sorry amen god bless you turn with me to 40. no yeah number 336 for brother faisal 336 to god be the glory great things he has done
