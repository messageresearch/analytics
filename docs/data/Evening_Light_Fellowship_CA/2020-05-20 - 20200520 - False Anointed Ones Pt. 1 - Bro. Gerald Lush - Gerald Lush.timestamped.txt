[50:04] amen Lord bless you turn with me to
[50:07] first Corinthians 13 a familiar
[50:10] scripture that I want to read and
[50:11] connect back to some of the things that
[50:14] our brother Ben has ministered to us
[50:16] over the weekend on Friday Saturday and
[50:20] Sunday and God bless our brothers
[50:22] ministry amen wherever he might be at
[50:24] this time
[50:25] Amen we look forward to having our
[50:27] brother eventually visit with us a man
[50:30] and des Minister personally face-to-face
[50:32] and not just not just online so the
[50:36] grace of God be with us for the glory of
[50:38] God and ask you yes to continue to
[50:40] remember the Saints in prayer and a to
[50:46] remember brother cars assembly because
[50:48] they understand there might be two in
[50:51] that assembly that does have the covet
[50:53] 19 problem in their in their beans so we
[50:58] pray the grace of God to our brother car
[51:00] at this time and our brother Carmen
[51:02] whose brother cars assisted right there
[51:05] and brother car as I say 90 or 92 but
[51:08] he's still ministry and he's still
[51:11] active well it's amazing now if you saw
[51:15] him online that he wouldn't look like
[51:17] someone 90 years old but he is a nanny
[51:20] and not talking like somebody 90 years
[51:22] old but he is so pray the grace of God
[51:25] to brother to brother a car and also to
[51:28] brother Carmen and we have been hoping
[51:32] to get our brother Carmen to come visit
[51:34] us
[51:35] but because of the Cobra 19 issue he had
[51:38] to cancel his flight here and there was
[51:41] also I think as three other places that
[51:44] he was planning to go and he had to
[51:46] cancel them as well so when this is
[51:49] passed we pray the grace of God to open
[51:52] the way for our brother Carmen to come
[51:54] and minister to us and just keep him in
[51:59] prayer and I'm not sure it was once
[52:01] somebody there might have been his wife
[52:03] and Mary Lee
[52:04] sister Maryland sheds I think she was
[52:07] supposed to have surgery whether or not
[52:08] she's still at it or not I'm not sure
[52:10] but we pray the grace of God to Mary
[52:13] Lynn and also the others their brother
[52:16] Mark mentioned as well that at surgery
[52:18] and in your sister at surgery twice and
[52:23] brother Barry twice
[52:24] well the grace of God be with them a man
[52:27] so keep them in prayer because listen
[52:29] because brother sister this is the hour
[52:33] for for healing sure because the
[52:36] prophecy if you can't believe it for
[52:37] healing how you going to believe for the
[52:39] rapture a man so god help us to believe
[52:42] for the healing of our bodies question
[52:45] what for were believed for the change of
[52:46] our bodies by the grace of Almighty God
[52:49] so let's let's press on and fight the
[52:52] devil amen and it is the devil not early
[52:55] he know he knows this is the time for
[52:57] the resurrection he knows this is time
[52:59] for the rapture that's why yes and he's
[53:01] tried to hinder it he's trying to stop
[53:03] it so brother sister remember when we
[53:05] experiencing those things is Satan a man
[53:08] so get away get thee behind me Satan a
[53:11] man he was tempting Jesus he tempts them
[53:14] right to a man so the grace of God be
[53:16] with us is our prayer so we're not
[53:19] looking for Satan to do this Satan to do
[53:20] that well I can do this and I can do
[53:23] that and I'll give you this now I'll
[53:24] give you that yeah well look for look
[53:26] for God's blessings not the devil's a
[53:28] man so the grace of God be with us and
[53:32] yes to say that we welcome our brother
[53:35] Chad yes because we've missed him
[53:38] quite a bit since this this issue has
[53:40] been going on and and we've only had
[53:44] five in the service here and then now it
[53:47] Stan a van and and even if everybody
[53:51] goes up to 20 I don't know if we can
[53:52] arrange that because you got to be still
[53:54] going to be six feet apart and so on so
[53:58] we're gonna leave it all with the Lord a
[53:59] van or we'd have to go rent another
[54:02] church amen because many of the churches
[54:06] are are there large churches especially
[54:08] are they are closed they don't have five
[54:12] people gathered there or ten people
[54:14] gathered there they did some of them are
[54:17] closed
[54:17] and I spoke with one gentleman and he
[54:20] said always said I went to visit two
[54:22] churches and he said there wasn't nobody
[54:24] not not one person there and even though
[54:28] they're allowed to have five 1.10 at
[54:30] another point but no they just closed it
[54:32] but I prayed but the Bride of Christ
[54:34] doesn't want it closed a man by the
[54:38] Christ as our brother prayed brother
[54:41] Chad prayed that's right yeah right we
[54:43] want the fellowship all to get to come
[54:46] back into the church and we want the
[54:48] fellowship with one another
[54:49] amen by the grace of God so god help us
[54:52] is my prayer and Anna yes brother
[54:55] brother because why - you can't
[54:58] fellowship with Jesus unless your
[55:00] fellowship one another its Christ in
[55:02] Christ in the earth flesh a man is
[55:05] Christ in my flesh he's revealed in you
[55:07] reveal of me and a fellowship of me and
[55:10] I got a felt straight with you of Mebane
[55:11] fellowship with Jesus a man for the
[55:13] grace of God be with us
[55:15] amen to really have the revelation that
[55:17] God wants us to have in this hour do we
[55:20] have it in our heads and I just been not
[55:22] just our heads but in our hearts a man
[55:24] what God wants us to have a man so God
[55:28] is looking at the Holy Ghost in us and
[55:30] not just not just a whole not just in
[55:33] our ain't my entire our souls rather but
[55:35] in our heads so that he's in control
[55:38] amen is the Holy Ghost in control that's
[55:42] the question we want to answer tonight
[55:44] and I've got some scriptures that we
[55:46] want to break bring out to show you if
[55:49] the Holy Ghost is in control this is the
[55:52] life you live a man so brothers you talk
[55:56] about an hour an hour that we need to
[55:59] make our colony on electric shore is
[56:00] this hour
[56:01] amen brother you what you want to be
[56:04] sure you're going into resurrection we
[56:06] really need to rapture make our called
[56:08] an election shore because it is it is
[56:10] the elect or I called to go into the
[56:12] rapture amen by the grace of God a
[56:15] million and you're not oh don't say tell
[56:17] me yours brother brother ben was
[56:19] bringing it out don't tell me you're
[56:20] elect just because you're saying oh I'm
[56:22] in the message and I believe that what
[56:25] the Bible says about the rapture I
[56:27] believe this I believe that no no
[56:29] no it's got to be in you a mayor it's
[56:32] not just you and the message you the
[56:34] message guardian you see I brought that
[56:36] quote out where the problem of God said
[56:38] always would you say you're in the
[56:39] message yeah he said but he said the
[56:41] message is not in you and he was
[56:43] preaching that to believers a man and I
[56:46] tell her this very few on the earth
[56:48] tonight we're in the the messages in
[56:51] there many in the message and I would
[56:54] say maybe I remember hearing our brother
[56:56] Perry green Greg give a give a quote of
[56:58] a number then he said there's a route 2
[57:00] million people he said around the world
[57:02] that are professing this message that
[57:04] was many years ago how many is it there
[57:07] tonight a man there might be three
[57:09] million but I tell you it's not 3
[57:11] million going in a rapture god help us
[57:14] those who make their calling and
[57:16] election sure are going into rapture god
[57:19] help us
[57:19] anybody it's more than just saying I'm
[57:22] in the message brother the message the
[57:25] word is made flesh in you a man is it
[57:29] well that's what you've got make your
[57:31] call and election short that's what
[57:33] you're doing making sure that the word
[57:35] is fleshing you not just in your head
[57:37] but it's in your heart
[57:38] and controlling you receivers
[57:42] controlling you because if if it's in
[57:45] your head your flesh controls you it was
[57:48] in your heart the word controls you will
[57:51] see who's controlling you our brother
[57:54] Benton was bringing those things out and
[57:55] it was good I thought well Lord praise
[57:58] the Lord and he was confirming as a word
[58:01] vindicated some things that I was
[58:03] already preaching a manner I already
[58:05] bleached old lately
[58:09] a man so I thank God for that a man so
[58:12] god bless our brother Ben and God bless
[58:15] the word that he ministered I pray in
[58:17] your art he meant not in your head in
[58:20] your heart
[58:21] amen in 1st Corinthians 13
[58:28] and verse one though I speak with the
[58:34] tongues of men and of angels and have
[58:39] not charity which is divine law many of
[58:44] the message but they don't have divine
[58:46] love many in the message but they don't
[58:51] have the baptism of divine love and
[58:54] though I speak with the tongues of men
[58:57] and of angels and have not charity or
[59:00] divine love I am become as sounding
[59:04] brass or a tinkling cymbal a man-god
[59:09] elbows that were not sounding brass or a
[59:12] tinkling cymbal a man and though I have
[59:17] the gift of prophecy and understand all
[59:21] mysteries amazing and all knowledge make
[59:29] our calling and election sure and though
[59:32] I have all faith this is amazing this is
[59:37] absolutely a challenge to our
[59:39] relationship with God and though I have
[59:43] faith so that I could remove mountains
[59:45] and have not charity I am nothing
[59:51] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[59:55] to feed the poor just think I'm nothing
[59:59] yet in our eyes we think were something
[1:00:01] in our eyes everything was spiritual in
[1:00:05] our eyes we think we believe this we
[1:00:07] believe that but it's only in our heads
[1:00:09] pray Grayson it's in our hearts by
[1:00:12] divine love and he said though I bestow
[1:00:15] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:00:21] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:00:24] charity it profiteth me nothing amazing
[1:00:30] because why because charity suffered
[1:00:35] long and is kind charity envieth not
[1:00:42] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[1:00:46] puffed up definitely not
[1:00:51] if charity does anything it humbles you
[1:00:55] divine love and it says does not behave
[1:00:59] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[1:01:02] not easily provoked and thinketh no evil
[1:01:07] the grace of God read it again verse 5
[1:01:11] it does not be behave itself unseemly
[1:01:14] seeketh not her own is not easily
[1:01:18] provoked thinketh no evil God grant us
[1:01:23] divine love a double portion and it says
[1:01:28] rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoices
[1:01:32] in the truth amen
[1:01:35] we're not going to rejoin them no matter
[1:01:37] who it is whether we're not going to
[1:01:39] rejoice over this one feels good that
[1:01:41] one feels good and it might be the
[1:01:43] result of sin in their life on belief in
[1:01:45] their life but we're not going to
[1:01:46] rejoice in that we're not going to all
[1:01:48] praise the Lord that's wonderful
[1:01:50] God has blessed you this god bless you
[1:01:52] there and so on no no no no better make
[1:01:55] your calling and election sure so he
[1:01:58] rejoiceth not in iniquity or unbelief
[1:02:01] but it rejoices in the truth and a
[1:02:07] beareth all things
[1:02:08] Oh God have mercy on us beareth all
[1:02:12] things believeth all things hopeth all
[1:02:15] things endureth all things by the grace
[1:02:20] of God charity or divine love never
[1:02:24] faileth but whether they be prophecies
[1:02:27] they shall fail whether to be tongues
[1:02:30] they shall cease whether there be
[1:02:31] knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[1:02:34] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[1:02:37] when that which is perfect is come then
[1:02:41] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:02:45] grace God is bringing us to perfection
[1:02:50] why was that by a perfect faith
[1:02:55] as the prophet of God preached the
[1:02:57] message perfect faith and he said it's
[1:03:00] ordained for what it's ordained he said
[1:03:02] we got to have it he said because he
[1:03:04] said we're going to need it for the
[1:03:06] rapture amen so God has given us perfect
[1:03:09] faith not just for justification or
[1:03:13] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:03:16] ghost but for the rapture a man the
[1:03:20] crowning of what God has done down
[1:03:22] through the ages praise the Lord
[1:03:24] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:03:27] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:03:29] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:03:32] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:03:36] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:03:40] away childish things for now we see
[1:03:44] through a glass darkly but then face to
[1:03:48] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:03:52] know even as also I am known
[1:03:55] God helped us and now abideth Faith Hope
[1:04:01] charity these three but the greatest of
[1:04:07] these is charity god bless his words you
[1:04:10] may be seated the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost is the baptism of divine love amen
[1:04:18] charity and not in our heads but in our
[1:04:22] hearts by the grace of God turn with me
[1:04:26] to the galatians chapter 2
[1:04:40] and in Galatians chapter 2
[1:04:49] verse 16 knowing that a man is not
[1:04:52] justified by the works of the law but by
[1:04:58] the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:04:59] a man so brother I got to have the faith
[1:05:04] of Jesus Christ a man to believe God and
[1:05:08] to believe the word as Jesus believed a
[1:05:11] man why - because brother sister a man
[1:05:14] because what he did in the flesh 2,000
[1:05:17] years ago he's going to do now a man
[1:05:20] when it comes to he laid down his life
[1:05:22] for us and he picked it up again now
[1:05:25] we're gonna lay down our lives for him
[1:05:27] and pick it up again in resurrection and
[1:05:30] rat-free glory praise the name of the
[1:05:33] Lord so knowing this that a man is not
[1:05:36] justified by the works of the law but by
[1:05:39] the faith of Jesus Christ even we have
[1:05:43] believed in Jesus Christ that we might
[1:05:46] be justified by the faith of Christ and
[1:05:49] not by the works of the law for by the
[1:05:53] works of the law shall no flesh be
[1:05:55] justified
[1:05:56] amen but that's why I've got to be in
[1:05:59] Christ and Christ in me because God is
[1:06:02] looking for that faith that perfect
[1:06:04] faith that pleases him and Jesus came
[1:06:07] and manifested that faith a man and that
[1:06:10] and brother he laid down his life and
[1:06:12] picked it up again and all those for the
[1:06:14] age of the prophets that faith paid
[1:06:16] faith they did this they did that but
[1:06:18] they lay down their lives but they
[1:06:20] didn't pick it up again because they
[1:06:22] were born in sin a man and not able to
[1:06:25] manifest the faith that God was looking
[1:06:27] for that God would come in flesh and he
[1:06:30] would manifest that faith himself a man
[1:06:32] that he would be the example that he
[1:06:35] would be that he would expect to see in
[1:06:37] the end time bride they met because he
[1:06:40] said I will restore save the Lord I'm
[1:06:42] going to do this I'm going to do that he
[1:06:44] started out with it in the in the first
[1:06:46] ages that were and oh yeah they believe
[1:06:49] this is they believe that a man they're
[1:06:51] looking for the resurrection looking
[1:06:53] with a rapture but a man but the enemy
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] so this darkness there and increase it
[1:06:59] and increased it increased it but God
[1:07:01] did gave a promise he said I'm going to
[1:07:03] restore a man and God allowed it and God
[1:07:06] permitted it priestly a man this is not
[1:07:09] just just don't think oh that's the
[1:07:10] devil he did this he did that
[1:07:12] brother the devil can't do anything
[1:07:14] without God's permission a man but a God
[1:07:17] God is going to let him do this God's
[1:07:19] going to let him do that and brother
[1:07:20] even in our in our day to day living
[1:07:22] brother you got are you got to deal with
[1:07:24] the devil and sometimes God is going to
[1:07:26] allow Satan to tempt you here tap you
[1:07:29] there what for is to bring out your
[1:07:31] faith a man is to bring out the faith of
[1:07:33] Christ in you a man just raised for me
[1:07:37] is not neither lives as Christ liveth in
[1:07:39] me by the ground he's going to prove it
[1:07:41] amen hallelujah brother he experienced
[1:07:46] this he experienced that when he was in
[1:07:48] the flesh himself Amen praise the name
[1:07:50] of the Lord
[1:07:51] oh yeah brother I tell you this just
[1:07:55] just assured that it was God in flesh
[1:07:56] brother when he would when he went out
[1:07:59] there at 30 years old and the devil came
[1:08:01] and tempted him and the devil did the
[1:08:03] devil tempted where they attempt him
[1:08:05] with that and he should need to get thee
[1:08:07] behind me Satan though shall not tempt
[1:08:08] the LORD thy God amen
[1:08:11] Oh Ted God the Father no there with him
[1:08:14] God was in the flesh a man the father
[1:08:17] came down and they in the form of the
[1:08:18] son though should not tempt the Lord

[1:09:10] man whether it's a spirit or whether
[1:09:12] it's the devil and who's influencing you
[1:09:15] more and more than anything else in this
[1:09:16] world is it going to be Jesus or is it
[1:09:18] Satan a man sir brother I pray the grace
[1:09:22] of God that we got the anointing of the
[1:09:24] Holy Ghost same again brother if you got

[1:09:27] the wisdom of God amen

[1:09:32] of God and I just seen your head because
[1:09:35] if you're Eve is in your head a man the
[1:09:37] devil will cost you two reasons
[1:09:39] you remember that cuz that's a prophecy
[1:09:41] he said this is the devil's Watchtower
[1:09:43] he said it's your brain and he said the
[1:09:46] soul the heart he said this is God's
[1:09:49] Watchtower amen
[1:09:51] so brother what's in control is your
[1:09:52] hater your brother your soul is it your
[1:09:55] reasoning up here in the head or a
[1:09:57] series of their faith in the soul the
[1:09:59] revelation of the will of God on the
[1:10:02] inside of the inside brother there's
[1:10:04] many a believer brother this guy's got
[1:10:05] one God and God the anointing got the
[1:10:07] word got the message up here but they
[1:10:09] don't have it in here
[1:10:10] amen that's the part of God said you're
[1:10:13] in the message but the message is not a
[1:10:15] you a man sir but I pray the grace of
[1:10:18] God that we got it in our hearts not in
[1:10:20] our heads a man we cast down reasoning
[1:10:23] the devil one of Jesus the reason the
[1:10:26] devil wants us to reason and that's why
[1:10:28] God allow this and now that judges to
[1:10:30] get us a reason a man and all the flesh
[1:10:33] we feel this we feel that we know this
[1:10:36] we know that we got knowledge but again
[1:10:39] we read it there and you know you could
[1:10:40] have all knowledge to understand all
[1:10:42] this
[1:10:43] you can have all faith to do this and
[1:10:44] this or this but if you don't have
[1:10:46] divine love it's all vain a man this is
[1:10:51] absolutely amazing brother
[1:10:53] and again there's things that I want to
[1:10:55] bring out when I get to that message on
[1:10:57] the anointing ones at the end time but
[1:11:00] it because when I went back to that
[1:11:02] message and I begin to think on things
[1:11:04] in that message and and the focus on
[1:11:06] what the prophet of God was saying I
[1:11:08] salute my lord I say this all my lord I
[1:11:11] said helpless Oh Lord Alba's I say that
[1:11:14] we're going to have the true anointing
[1:11:16] of the Holy Ghost and not only in our
[1:11:18] heads were
[1:11:18] have it in our hearts and oh hey man and
[1:11:21] Lord that our motives are gonna be right
[1:11:23] or objectives are go to right hey man
[1:11:25] and Lord brave man so there your your
[1:11:28] that your the Lord you're controlling it
[1:11:30] a man and not not our feelings your
[1:11:34] control you're not the devil you can add
[1:11:36] the true and knowing of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:37] and brother you can be under Satan's
[1:11:39] influence that is the absolute truth oh
[1:11:43] is that true is that right did the
[1:11:45] prophet of God really say that yes he is
[1:11:48] warning the people and he feel
[1:11:50] absolutely felt he said I fear Lee and
[1:11:52] his message was in July of 1965 and he
[1:11:57] actually felt lit of the Lord he because
[1:11:58] it took to get here take this truth to
[1:12:02] the Saints to give this to the
[1:12:03] professing believers because he felt
[1:12:05] that they whether we needed to know this
[1:12:07] we needed to understand this right
[1:12:10] should be on our guard
[1:12:11] amen and to make our County and election
[1:12:15] sure not to grow to say well I got the
[1:12:17] Holy Ghost because I was baptized in his
[1:12:19] name I got the Holy Ghost because all I
[1:12:21] do this and I do that and I wouldn't do
[1:12:24] this and I wouldn't do that
[1:12:25] by the way sure where we'll see what you
[1:12:27] would do wouldn't do it's right there in
[1:12:30] the word oh yeah our brother then made
[1:12:33] reference to to to it not not not he
[1:12:36] didn't take it all but he just made
[1:12:38] reference to it to one article there but
[1:12:41] there's many a man and we'll see we'll
[1:12:46] see if we really got the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:49] control of us in our hearts
[1:12:51] oh yeah again like I said the part of
[1:12:54] God is bringing it out in the anointing
[1:12:56] ones at the end time that you can have
[1:12:57] the anointing in your head you could add
[1:12:59] the anointing in your flesh and he said
[1:13:01] you could have the Holy Ghost she said
[1:13:03] on you he said you know where you could
[1:13:05] have experienced the Holy Ghost 24 hours
[1:13:08] a day he said I go to hell
[1:13:11] Amen so if I got the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:13:14] just outward twenty-four hours a day
[1:13:16] amen what if what is what I said what
[1:13:20] influence does the Holy Ghost had on me
[1:13:22] amen you'll have a certain amount of
[1:13:24] influence but not all amen and Satan he
[1:13:28] said we'll be there to control
[1:13:29] pet influence amen
[1:13:32] oh my god the Holy Ghost but he said the
[1:13:35] God will allow this to happen God allow
[1:13:37] that to happen
[1:13:37] a man just to bring out whether it's in
[1:13:40] your head or in your heart
[1:13:42] a million with a man
[1:13:45] and what's authority and control do you
[1:13:47] have over Satan now much controlling a
[1:13:49] fairy and there's oh it's a Satan have
[1:13:51] over us as individuals brothers sister
[1:13:55] the grace of God because God said I'm
[1:13:57] going to restore he said because it
[1:13:59] because the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God
[1:14:01] was leaving and then the influence of
[1:14:03] shame was getting greater and greater
[1:14:05] and greater and so great that brother
[1:14:09] sister with me I like this again that
[1:14:10] the public god brother sister when the
[1:14:13] pillar of fire drew this on the wall in
[1:14:15] Brenham tabernacle when the proud of God
[1:14:17] was preaching the church ages the pillar
[1:14:19] fire came in and he went over to the
[1:14:22] truth of the wall there and he drew this
[1:14:25] on the wall this is where the power of
[1:14:27] God got it yeah and but he said I don't
[1:14:31] know and the people did see the light
[1:14:33] but they were looking this way and the
[1:14:35] problem of God said no he said he said
[1:14:37] you're looking the wrong way so you're
[1:14:38] looking at the reflection a man he said
[1:14:42] but he said the pillar fires right here
[1:14:43] oh yeah and many there's many brother
[1:14:46] looking at the reflection of the message
[1:14:48] not the real thing
[1:14:50] hey man and brother and this is what
[1:14:53] they a day a true on the wall but but
[1:14:55] they were looking over here and he was
[1:14:57] over there the pillar of fire was drawn
[1:14:59] on the wall of the seven church ages and
[1:15:02] the brother God said I said but I want
[1:15:04] you to sit notice he said that when he
[1:15:06] drew this he said it was all black amen
[1:15:10] anyway he said brother bound put that in
[1:15:12] the areas of the red to represent the
[1:15:14] brain age he put that in there to
[1:15:16] represent of the revealed word and what
[1:15:18] God was promising in these last days
[1:15:20] through Malachi 4 and he said there was
[1:15:23] really a little bit of
[1:15:24] they're what for it is to give the
[1:15:26] Buried wrap tree faith it is to give us
[1:15:29] the revelation or you can understand
[1:15:31] this and you can understand that you can
[1:15:33] believe that God sent a prophet you can
[1:15:35] believe that the stable seals are open
[1:15:37] and you can believe the mystery of God
[1:15:39] is revealed and go to hell
[1:15:41] amen why because it all comes down to
[1:15:45] Christ in you Christ in Nate the hope of
[1:15:49] glory amen
[1:15:51] it comes down to us not me that lives
[1:15:53] this crease that liveth in me
[1:15:54] amen amen soul body and spirit that is
[1:15:59] Christ liveth in me
[1:16:00] amen oh boy oh you mean to tell me
[1:16:03] you're not going to make no mistakes yes
[1:16:05] you'll make mistakes but again it crises
[1:16:07] and yeah you're going to do be right
[1:16:09] there to repent right there to call the
[1:16:12] Lord forgive me I want to keep pressing
[1:16:14] on Jesus amen
[1:16:16] you'll forgive you you'll be there amen

[1:16:20] amen and you do sin and you do this all
[1:16:23] you would have a mighty conviction amen
[1:16:26] maybe and there will be a tremendous
[1:16:29] repentance by the grace of God so
[1:16:32] brother God was real it was restoring it
[1:16:34] and bringing it back and bringing it
[1:16:35] back and bring it back the light through
[1:16:37] through through through Martin Luther
[1:16:39] and so on and on down I had to bring it
[1:16:41] by Louis before brother Gant our brother
[1:16:44] but you been we're bringing it up and he
[1:16:46] talked about just st. a justification
[1:16:48] strain to the occasion baptism of the
[1:16:50] Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen
[1:16:52] oh well praise that all I got the
[1:16:54] bathroom of the Holy Ghost and I got the
[1:16:56] gifts of the Spirit I could do this and
[1:16:58] I can do that well brother we just read
[1:17:00] it in in 1st Corinthians 13
[1:17:02] you can do this and you could do that
[1:17:03] but you don't have the baptism in your
[1:17:05] soul divine love the bedroom of the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost is the baptism of divine love
[1:17:11] because God is love a man and game what
[1:17:17] does love project log projects Grace and
[1:17:20] well there's grace project faith
[1:17:23] amen so brother no no it's not just say
[1:17:27] I got I got this faith I got their faith
[1:17:29] and to us faith is a revelation I got
[1:17:32] this revelation of that revelation
[1:17:33] not all it is more than that let's go
[1:17:35] back to see where that revelation is
[1:17:37] coming from and is it out of your soul
[1:17:39] or is it out of your hand
[1:17:41] amen Israel you're just gotta get you
[1:17:44] were just there and when the anointing
[1:17:46] comes down and you get this and you get
[1:17:48] that yeah there's one brother there got
[1:17:50] the anointing in his soul and the other
[1:17:52] one is sitting next to him got it in his
[1:17:53] head oh yeah
[1:17:56] and they're both rejoicing over the word
[1:17:58] oh yeah that's wonderful I believe that
[1:18:01] I believe that yeah but he won't let the
[1:18:06] Holy Ghost when he further than his mind
[1:18:09] not into his soul but for the true
[1:18:12] believer it go down indeed your suburban
[1:18:15] dust goes down into the soul by the
[1:18:18] grace of God amen so brother sister
[1:18:21] again as our brother beam was bringing
[1:18:24] out because she are sons God does this
[1:18:28] because your sons God does that because
[1:18:31] your son's God is going to test you God
[1:18:33] is gonna try you God is going to bring
[1:18:34] out a man the attributes of true sons
[1:18:37] and daughters of God he made he's not
[1:18:40] going to God's not there just to make
[1:18:41] everything good and everything easy for
[1:18:43] you and he could to bless you and he's
[1:18:45] gonna do this sometimes he'll put you
[1:18:46] right down oh yeah they're there those
[1:18:50] that you love raise up well yeah well
[1:18:54] that's they got that anointing they got
[1:18:55] that spirit they got that attitude but
[1:18:57] then there's others even though they're
[1:18:59] sons of God God got a deal with this
[1:19:01] spirit that spirit and he'll dropped you
[1:19:03] and drop you and drop you hey man but
[1:19:06] then after a while he knows your seat of
[1:19:10] God he's gonna bring you back up a mate
[1:19:14] he's not gonna leave you down no no is
[1:19:16] there a reason see brother sister see
[1:19:18] summer tempted this way summer tempted
[1:19:20] that way
[1:19:21] summer tested this way other attested
[1:19:23] that way amen
[1:19:24] it seemed like we wonder Lord why is it
[1:19:27] that I'm tested so much like this and
[1:19:29] that brother is not tested that sister's
[1:19:31] not tested love like that
[1:19:33] but yet they still got that faith that
[1:19:35] pleases God amen and got to attest to us
[1:19:39] some digest you or test somebody else or
[1:19:41] tested just me look for you get us get
[1:19:44] us two more and more
[1:19:45] they trust him more and more love him
[1:19:48] more and more servant die more and more
[1:19:52] flesh and they come more and more alive
[1:19:54] to Jesus amen but we need even more and
[1:19:57] more sensitive to God more and more
[1:20:00] sensitive to the Holy Ghost and less and
[1:20:02] less and less sensitive to the feelings
[1:20:04] of our body
[1:20:05] hey man brother that's the truth amen
[1:20:08] and I believe our brother our brother
[1:20:10] Ben was hitting on those things and he
[1:20:12] was bringing out those things because he
[1:20:14] brought out certain scriptures but we'll
[1:20:16] read those scripture said but not just
[1:20:18] one one he just referenced it but not
[1:20:21] not bringing out and reading does this
[1:20:23] verse from this verse and this verse a
[1:20:24] man will do that show you what's in
[1:20:28] control of your life
[1:20:29] yours is it oh it's the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:20:32] but it does he have full control out of
[1:20:34] your heart or is it just in your head
[1:20:36] and giving you revelation this this yeah
[1:20:42] her brother brought that out when he
[1:20:43] showed us the books
[1:20:44] oh yeah should they believe this they
[1:20:46] believe that yeah but it's in the book
[1:20:48] about in their heart yeah it's the same
[1:20:51] thing where there's a lot of things here
[1:20:52] in the Bible but if you're baptized with
[1:20:54] the Holy Ghost in your heart amen
[1:20:58] what you believe is on the inside of the
[1:21:00] inside and it is eternal life amen
[1:21:04] and again this night you two lives is
[1:21:05] Christ living in you
[1:21:07] amen in the beginning was the word the
[1:21:10] Word was with God the Word was God the
[1:21:12] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us

[1:21:17] a man oh god help us brother sister to
[1:21:21] get more and more and more amen under
[1:21:24] the control of the word under the
[1:21:26] control of the Holy Ghost in our souls

[1:22:01] of a sudden he said you find they're
[1:22:02] teaching what they're teaching is not
[1:22:04] right it's a false teaching a man and
[1:22:10] brother we got a lot much of a brother
[1:22:11] in every age God God has had to deal
[1:22:14] with it
[1:22:14] God revealed the word and there was
[1:22:16] Luther but after Luther became those
[1:22:19] that made a denomination out of it oh
[1:22:21] yeah and they went on preaching
[1:22:23] justification justification amen but
[1:22:26] then God had move on move on and there
[1:22:28] was Wesley and the public Gossage is
[1:22:30] just three generations later and he said
[1:22:32] they'd innominate yeah three generations
[1:22:36] how many generations as their bed since
[1:22:39] they're going to the Prophet and there's
[1:22:42] mid there's many around this message
[1:22:43] that are denominated it's no more than
[1:22:46] the denomination it is not a
[1:22:48] resurrection and a rapture in faith it's
[1:22:50] just the denomination amen and as I've
[1:22:53] said this is their Creed brother and

[1:26:13] said not by the works of the law
[1:26:14] for by the works of the law shall no
[1:26:17] flesh be justified but if while we seek
[1:26:22] to be justified by Christ we ourselves
[1:26:24] also are found sinners is there
[1:26:28] therefore is therefore Christ the
[1:26:31] minister of sin no righteousness God
[1:26:36] forbid for if I build again he said the
[1:26:40] things which I destroyed I make myself a
[1:26:43] transgressor frights through the law am
[1:26:47] dead to the law that I might live unto
[1:26:50] God
[1:26:51] I got a die to that for Christ to come
[1:26:54] in and raise me up with razor with
[1:26:56] resurrection a man not just physical
[1:27:00] brother will break it out for me to
[1:27:04] experience a physical resurrection I've
[1:27:06] got to experience a clear spiritual
[1:27:08] resurrection and we'll give you the
[1:27:11] scripture because there a spiritual
[1:27:14] resurrection as I said I preached in
[1:27:16] that church one time certain church and
[1:27:18] it was two or three hundred people there
[1:27:21] and I said I just want to let you know
[1:27:22] I've been resurrected and I want to let
[1:27:25] you know I've been raptured oh it was
[1:27:29] quiet everybody got quiet they were
[1:27:32] looking at one another and they're all
[1:27:34] looking at their pasture to pasture were
[1:27:36] looking at them and shaking his head I
[1:27:40] said I'm gonna prove to you by the word
[1:27:42] that I have been resurrected I have been
[1:27:47] raptured I will read the scripture just
[1:27:49] shortly amen brother god help us to have
[1:27:54] faith brother everywhere not resurrected
[1:27:57] spiritually I can actually be late for a
[1:28:00] physical resurrection a man a man a man

[1:28:05] and yet there's many a believer doesn't
[1:28:07] they they don't recognize that they've
[1:28:09] been resurrected they don't recognize
[1:28:11] her they've already been raptured
[1:28:12] they've already been changed they don't
[1:28:15] recognize that but I got to have that
[1:28:18] experience in me for it to take control
[1:28:21] one day a man it'll take control and
[1:28:25] that all be changed in a moment
[1:28:27] give an eye for the dead in Christ shall
[1:28:31] rise first and then we which are alive

[1:28:45] God amen
[1:28:47] praise the name of the Lord I'm going to
[1:28:50] tell you a certain thing I saw one time
[1:28:53] when I was I was on my way to our
[1:28:55] brother burns as a sister burns his
[1:28:57] house for a cottage meeting and when I
[1:28:59] looked up I turned I looked up to the
[1:29:02] sky it was dark but hold the light thy

[1:29:39] that God did he we did reveal what he
[1:29:41] has revealed as our brother it is
[1:29:43] because of the resurrection of the
[1:29:44] rapture the prophet of God brings it out
[1:29:47] well yeah and I are they I lighted it in
[1:29:50] the message on perfect faith in the
[1:29:52] message and then then he preached the
[1:29:54] rapture and he said God did this and God
[1:29:57] did that the mystery of God was what was
[1:29:59] the mystery of God revealed for he said

[1:31:16] resurrection amen
[1:31:19] that we're not going to just go to a
[1:31:20] passive graveyard and feel that all
[1:31:23] they're all dead to need man they're all
[1:31:25] dust and so on Oh Lord that's what you
[1:31:27] said no you're not there if they're
[1:31:30] dating Christ are not there during
[1:31:33] another dimension that's the prophet of
[1:31:37] God said me say it again he said they're
[1:31:39] waiting on us for what Rhianna us for
[1:31:44] the resurrection the Old Testament
[1:31:48] Saints were waiting on Jesus look what
[1:31:51] he did know they're the new judgment
[1:31:53] straights are waiting on mrs. Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ because the powder God said
[1:31:58] Christ is made flesh in the bright the
[1:32:01] fullness of the Godhead bodily said is
[1:32:03] now in the bright brother/sister God
[1:32:06] Elvis what are you do you really feel
[1:32:09] like that do you really feel that that
[1:32:12] you are the fullness of the Godhead
[1:32:14] bodily you really fail in your spirit
[1:32:17] and in your soul as Jesus felt just
[1:32:22] think Jesus went went knowing who he was
[1:32:24] he didn't doubt who he was he knew what
[1:32:28] he had to do knew what I knew what he
[1:32:30] had to accomplish and how he had to do
[1:32:32] it that's right brother that's why he
[1:32:33] went into the Garden of Gethsemane and
[1:32:35] he got down and he cried and he cried
[1:32:37] and he cried knowing what he had to
[1:32:40] endure in the flesh for your sake and
[1:32:41] mine
[1:32:43] it struck me a couple of days ago
[1:32:49] that by grace through faith I'm saved

[1:32:57] I said Lord what it want will I'm sorry

[1:40:56] amen
[1:40:57] oh my forgive me he said verse 17 he
[1:41:05] said if why we seek to be justified by
[1:41:07] Christ we ourselves also are found
[1:41:09] sinners if there is therefore Christ the
[1:41:14] minister of said no god forbid he come
[1:41:19] to redeem us from seeing
[1:41:20] a man for if I build again the things
[1:41:24] which I destroyed
[1:41:25] I make my supper transgressor for I
[1:41:28] through the law am dead to the law that
[1:41:30] I might live unto God how many are
[1:41:33] living under God so that each
[1:41:35] controlling your thoughts your spirit
[1:41:38] your soul oh yeah not just not just your
[1:41:43] thoughts and not just your your even
[1:41:45] your spirit he's got to have controlling
[1:41:47] your soul why so they is living in you
[1:41:53] you can add the powder God is warning us
[1:41:56] you can have it in your head you can
[1:41:57] have it in your spirit and Satan being
[1:41:59] control still in control of your senses
[1:42:02] oh yeah grace to us he said I through
[1:42:09] the law am dead to the law that I might
[1:42:12] live unto God amen and verse 20 he said
[1:42:18] I am crucified with Christ any man I
[1:42:24] trust I am I trust you err because if
[1:42:29] you're crucified with Christ you are
[1:42:31] dead to sin a man I am crucified with
[1:42:37] Christ nevertheless I live and yet not i
[1:42:41] but Christ liveth in me is that true I
[1:42:46] remember it's not just if Christ has
[1:42:49] hidden you in your soul is your just not
[1:42:52] just say oh I believe the message I
[1:42:54] believe this I believe that so does the
[1:42:57] devil yeah but there is a life that
[1:43:04] Christ in you is going to reflect
[1:43:05] there's an attitude that Christ in you
[1:43:08] is going to reflect there's a spirit
[1:43:10] that Christ in you is going to reflect
[1:43:12] and we will show you now in the
[1:43:15] scriptures that life that spirit and
[1:43:18] that attitude how many got it
[1:43:24] I'll tell you this after the prophet of
[1:43:29] God was taken off the scene a Roman
[1:43:31] Catholic priest or whatever he was in
[1:43:36] the church there he said listen he said
[1:43:39] I tell you what William Branham he saw
[1:43:42] tell you this he said if you ever met
[1:43:44] him he said you knew he loved you yeah
[1:43:50] he had divine love again first
[1:43:53] Corinthians 13
[1:43:54] you know oh he knew this and he knew
[1:43:57] that he had this and he had this being a
[1:44:00] prophet he had this gift and this
[1:44:01] anointing so on yeah but he had a
[1:44:03] greater 90 in his soul of divine love
[1:44:05] search should annoy that even those out
[1:44:08] there said oh if you've met him you knew
[1:44:11] that he loved you if somebody met you
[1:44:17] would they sense that you loved them
[1:44:22] would they discern that that you had a
[1:44:25] loving spirit yeah not an attitude
[1:44:29] spirit life
[1:44:35] god help us I've met a lot of believers
[1:44:39] but I didn't I didn't sense love no
[1:44:43] they're just religious and they're
[1:44:45] believers oh I believe the message I
[1:44:47] believe this
[1:44:47] yeah and they could talk your blue I'm
[1:44:50] gonna come to the doctrine now but they
[1:44:54] never had divine love I am crucified
[1:44:59] with Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[1:45:02] i but Christ liveth in me and the life
[1:45:05] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:45:09] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:45:13] and gave himself for me the life that I
[1:45:19] now live and this at you don't just

[1:49:48] actions and their reactions god help us
[1:49:50] and brother he's got to be in control in
[1:49:56] Ephesians chapter 2 okay and verse 1 you
[1:50:08] as he quickened it is what the scripture
[1:50:11] I gave it to that church when I told him
[1:50:13] I was resurrected I said I've been
[1:50:16] resurrected in my soul I was dead but
[1:50:19] now I'm alive in my soul and you and
[1:50:24] they quicken who were dead in trespasses
[1:50:26] and sins I trust you got the revelation
[1:50:30] of Resurrection that trust you got the
[1:50:33] experience of resurrection and that
[1:50:36] you're a new creature in Christ he
[1:50:40] changes your nature oh you're still
[1:50:44] you're still dealing with that old
[1:50:46] nature because it's in your flesh and
[1:50:47] the devil is there to get you to try to
[1:50:49] focus on that but no God has given us a
[1:50:53] new nature in our souls what for the
[1:50:57] soul is to control the spirit and the
[1:51:00] Spirit is to control the flesh amen
[1:51:03] so I pray grace that you got the
[1:51:06] anointing power of the Holy Ghost in
[1:51:09] your soul to control your spirit because
[1:51:12] that's a prophet of God brought out he
[1:51:13] said that your flesh has got five senses
[1:51:16] and he said your soul has got five
[1:51:19] senses the instincts of your spirit of
[1:51:25] your flesh is
[1:51:28] case feel smell and here yet what you're
[1:51:32] hearing
[1:51:33] but the instincts of your spirit is
[1:51:38] imagination conscience memory reason
[1:51:46] affection the instincts of your spirit a
[1:51:50] man and the anointing in your soul will
[1:51:54] control the instincts of your spirit and
[1:51:56] the instincts of your spirit will
[1:51:58] control the instincts of your flesh and
[1:52:01] if you born with a worldly nature in
[1:52:04] your soul you're still there it'll
[1:52:06] control your spirit and your flesh and
[1:52:08] you'll live like the world but if you're
[1:52:10] born again and you got a new nature in
[1:52:13] your soul a man well it's going to
[1:52:16] control your spirit it's gonna be an
[1:52:18] oligo stin fluence in your spirit and
[1:52:20] that's going to be influencing your
[1:52:22] flesh by the grace of God hey man oh
[1:52:27] brother
[1:52:28] grace that we're resurrected in our
[1:52:31] souls you as a quicken who were dead in
[1:52:36] trespasses and sins we've been made
[1:52:39] alive we were dead but now we're alive
[1:52:43] we're you know we were dead to God cut
[1:52:47] off him and now we're united with God
[1:52:49] we're in back in fellowship with God
[1:52:51] because why we are sons and daughters of
[1:52:53] God a man we're in times pass he walked
[1:52:58] according to the course of this world
[1:53:00] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:53:02] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:53:05] the children of disobedience are you
[1:53:08] will be inter disobedient or eyes goes
[1:53:12] beyond just water baptism goes beyond
[1:53:15] just so I believe in the oneness of the
[1:53:17] Guardian I believe what the prophets
[1:53:19] said there and so on I believe in the
[1:53:22] invisible Union but are you experiencing
[1:53:24] it one thing to say I believe what the
[1:53:27] what he said about the invisible union
[1:53:29] of the evany bridegroom and the earthly
[1:53:31] bride yeah but are you experiencing it
[1:53:36] there's many believe it but they're not
[1:53:37] experiencing the invisible union
[1:53:40] with Christ God Elvis this is we're in
[1:53:48] time past ye walked according to the
[1:53:49] course of this world according to the
[1:53:52] Prince of the power of the air the
[1:53:54] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:53:56] of disobedience yeah I see that worldly
[1:54:01] spirit working in a lot of believers
[1:54:02] yeah among whom also we all had our
[1:54:07] conversation in times past in the lusts
[1:54:10] of our flesh yep fulfilling the desires
[1:54:14] of the flesh and of the mind and we're
[1:54:17] but and we're by nature the children of
[1:54:20] Wrath even as others for God who is rich
[1:54:24] in mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:54:26] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:54:30] as quickened us together with Christ
[1:54:34] we've been resurrected spiritually amen
[1:54:39] by the grace ye are saved and as raised
[1:54:42] us up together and made us sit together

[1:54:50] places raise us up together and made us
[1:54:53] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:54:56] Christ Jesus amen I've been resurrected
[1:54:59] I've been raptured a man I would
[1:55:04] resurrect it in myself and rapture him
[1:55:06] my soul into a heavenly place in Christ
[1:55:08] where the word is revealed part of God
[1:55:12] say what's going on in heavenly places
[1:55:14] in Christ he said the word is being
[1:55:18] revealed amen so it's not me that lives
[1:55:23] it's not you that leaves us Christ
[1:55:24] living in you oh yeah he's living in you
[1:55:29] in your house he's living in you in your
[1:55:30] home he's living in you and your job oh
[1:55:32] yeah you're you're doing it now you're
[1:55:35] doing there's not there not as an
[1:55:36] unbeliever you you go work as a
[1:55:38] Christian yeah you talk as a Christian
[1:55:44] you you you think as a Christian you do
[1:55:46] the work as a Christian as Christ would
[1:55:48] do it it's not you doing this and then
[1:55:52] always just Christ is just with you
[1:55:53] Church Oh crisis just with you when you
[1:55:56] when you say to prayer see or your
[1:55:58] Greece in your home crisis just there
[1:56:00] you know it's oh no no he never let he
[1:56:02] never leaves you
[1:56:03] you never forsake you he shall be with
[1:56:07] you even in you to the end of the age
[1:56:10] I'll never never lead you the brother no
[1:56:14] matter what you're doing
[1:56:15] he's not he's not going to leave you if
[1:56:18] you're a Christian you will have a right
[1:56:22] spirit and a right attitude right action
[1:56:26] right reaction I've given you different
[1:56:35] witnesses and different testimony but
[1:56:36] it's not me because I feel that I'm not
[1:56:41] righteous it's he's righteous not me but
[1:56:48] yet if your spirit is right in your
[1:56:49] attitudes right others were some not not
[1:56:52] everybody but some will recognize it all
[1:56:55] right
[1:56:55] they recognize it in Jesus they'll
[1:56:59] recognise it in you now grace of God
[1:57:07] he has raised us up together and made us
[1:57:10] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:57:13] Christ Jesus brother we have been
[1:57:16] resurrected spiritually
[1:57:17] we've been raptured spiritually we are
[1:57:19] in heavenly places in Christ brother how
[1:57:22] can you live any other kind of life or
[1:57:24] have any other kind of an attitude if
[1:57:26] you've been if you got resurrection in
[1:57:28] you and you got a rapture a spirit in
[1:57:30] you how can you you can't there's no way
[1:57:35] you can get away from it because why
[1:57:39] you're one he is one with you you're one
[1:57:41] with him
[1:57:44] so again as we read in the scripture
[1:57:47] there is he says Christ in you the hope
[1:57:50] of glory he's not you there not me that
[1:57:53] lives it's Christ that liveth in me
[1:57:54] amazing how you met did you manifest
[1:58:00] Christ to it to the ones you work with
[1:58:03] do they do they recognize you as being a
[1:58:05] Christian do they know that you take
[1:58:09] your stand for this and you're standing
[1:58:10] for that and they reverence you and
[1:58:11] respect you most will not all but most
[1:58:16] will and he said why we've experienced
[1:58:25] this with the experience that that in
[1:58:27] the ages to come he might show the
[1:58:29] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[1:58:32] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[1:58:35] and again the familiar verse for by
[1:58:39] grace are you saved through faith not
[1:58:42] just grace well I say by great no it's
[1:58:46] grace through faith and that not of
[1:58:50] yourselves it is the gift of God amen
[1:58:55] praise the name of the Lord one other
[1:58:57] scripture and then we love to try to
[1:58:59] bring it to a conclusion Galatians
[1:59:02] chapter 5 the challenge of our faith
[1:59:11] as sons and daughters of God did this be
[1:59:18] a challenge to our faith to us who
[1:59:23] profess to be borned again to us who
[1:59:28] believe that it's not me that lives as
[1:59:30] Christ that liveth in me this is going
[1:59:33] to be a challenge Galatians chapter 5
[1:59:37] and verse 16 this I say then walk in the
[1:59:44] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[1:59:48] of the flesh regardless of what you do
[1:59:51] when you do it where you do it how you
[1:59:53] do it you've got to do it in the spirit
[1:59:55] a man oh yeah no matter if you're a job
[1:59:59] no matter what you're doing you're doing
[2:00:01] it in the spirit you're controlled by
[2:00:03] the Holy Ghost you do it as as Christ
[2:00:05] would do it amazing not me that lives
[2:00:08] not you the lives as Christ that liveth
[2:00:10] in you and if Christ is living in you
[2:00:12] when he's doing it oh yeah
[2:00:14] he'll bless you if you're going to if
[2:00:17] your spirit is right and your attitudes
[2:00:18] right you'll bless you or did I don't
[2:00:21] mean you got to be religious it's just a
[2:00:25] right spirit a right attitude right
[2:00:27] actions right reactions ain't man there
[2:00:31] are others they just reckon all you're a
[2:00:33] good person now some might recognize you
[2:00:35] if they got that discernment they might
[2:00:37] recognize oh they must be Christian you
[2:00:42] don't have to be in the sense of
[2:00:44] Christian - you got it you got to say
[2:00:45] this and say that say no no your life is
[2:00:49] going to reveal it if Christ is in you
[2:00:52] he'll make yourself known and some will
[2:00:57] look at your said well Lee he's a good
[2:01:00] person
[2:01:01] and moving that's it others look and say
[2:01:03] oh he must be a Christian I think that
[2:01:07] brother that that that man rather or
[2:01:10] that woman is a Christian grace to us
[2:01:18] see walk in the spirit and he shall not
[2:01:22] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[2:01:25] remember the book of Romans about the
[2:01:28] seed of God the sons and daughters of
[2:01:29] God are led by the Spirit of God so walk
[2:01:32] in the spirit and he shall not fulfill
[2:01:34] the lust of the flesh for the flesh
[2:01:37] lusteth against the spirit and the
[2:01:40] spirit against the flesh and these are
[2:01:42] the contrary the one to the other so
[2:01:45] that he cannot do the things that she
[2:01:47] would but if he be led of the Spirit ye
[2:01:50] are not under the law now the works of
[2:01:54] the flesh are manifest which are these
[2:01:57] and more often than not will focus on
[2:02:00] the these first four or five year but
[2:02:04] ignore the others why not guilty of this
[2:02:08] one not giveth at what about would the
[2:02:10] next not guilty of verse nineteen but
[2:02:12] what about verse twenty our brother then
[2:02:18] did bring out one in verse twenty there
[2:02:21] he didn't highlight verse 19 he
[2:02:24] highlighted verse 20 or one thing in
[2:02:27] verse 20 but the works of the flesh are
[2:02:31] manifest which are these adultery don't
[2:02:38] give much hope to anyone that committed
[2:02:40] adultery because man is there to condemn
[2:02:44] them oh yeah then to put them down but
[2:02:48] brother they can commit adultery
[2:02:50] naturally and be forgiven commit
[2:02:52] adultery spiritually yea and be lost God
[2:02:57] help us keep your attitude right there

[2:03:02] and it said the works of the flesh are
[2:03:06] these adultery fornication uncleanness

[2:03:19] pray for that brother pray for that

[2:05:02] the kingdom of God no we're not guilty
[2:05:09] of verse 19 but if you're guilty of
[2:05:11] anything in verse 20 you still want to
[2:05:13] want an heir of the kingdom of God but
[2:05:17] the fruit of the Spirit oh how many are
[2:05:21] going to judge ourselves by this now we

[2:14:11] someone recognized your Christian I mean
[2:14:13] I don't know if anyone could recognize
[2:14:15] you as a Christian because I know one
[2:14:18] over a Christian is that I've known I've
[2:14:21] been around I mean I don't know anyone
[2:14:23] around where I work I mean this goes to
[2:14:25] church or anything I remember times the
[2:14:28] one guy he had kind of a church
[2:14:29] upbringing that and I would say I was
[2:14:30] church last night Wednesday night you
[2:14:32] know I mean he was I had explained that
[2:14:34] like why did you go to church for
[2:14:39] Wednesday night I mean it was like
[2:14:41] nothing really cool enough you know what
[2:14:44] it just did not know I need to know why
[2:14:48] you would go to church on Wednesday
[2:14:49] night people don't go to church on
[2:14:51] Wednesday night I mean Costco is not
[2:14:54] empty when said I you know I mean you
[2:14:59] know it's just there's no one there they
[2:15:01] just don't know I mean they see you're
[2:15:04] different there's something like that
[2:15:05] you know he's different but I mean they
[2:15:07] don't know what it is you say it's
[2:15:09] religious well they don't know what that
[2:15:10] means you know I mean that's way King
[2:15:16] came to me is just it's just not
[2:15:18] recognizable anymore because in darkness
[2:15:20] right yeah I don't know what it is you
[2:15:23] know I'd say if you were going home they
[2:15:25] say if you were going hunt your hunters
[2:15:27] but say if I went home to her I wouldn't
[2:15:30] know what a terror look like I can see
[2:15:32] big flocks of tears and I'll hoping to
[2:15:33] get terrible I don't know what it looks
[2:15:35] like they can plow right past you though
[2:15:38] I'm here waiting for tears you know but
[2:15:40] you don't know what a tear is so I mean
[2:15:42] this that's what brother brother Ben was
[2:15:47] talking about you know when that debt
[2:15:50] that see comes through the body you know
[2:15:52] as Brent said in spoken words original
[2:15:55] seed that's he comes to the body and it
[2:15:57] takes a person to who has the seed to
[2:16:01] pass to see you know and I remember when
[2:16:04] I when I came in to miss you a good
[2:16:05] friend
[2:16:06] and he he came down to see me you wanted
[2:16:09] to talk to me he didn't understand it
[2:16:11] and we come coolly and he said I want to
[2:16:15] he said I want to explain to you what I
[2:16:18] believed I am on explain to you and so
[2:16:22] we sat down and he said I believe in God
[2:16:27] it was short I see it's all mean he'll I
[2:16:34] mean didn't I I wasn't much better
[2:16:36] you know I mean that's just the way the
