So they're trying to figure out uh what the problem is. So, uh, let's remember those needs as well. And, uh, also just, you know, we had, uh, the prayer service once again last night. And what's, uh, what stands out is, uh, well, answered prayer for some of the needs that were in the past. And but also the fact that there are a lot of needs among us. So I just wanted to highlight that not the individual ones of course but the fact that you know we all have needs and we need to be praying for each other even more so as we approach uh the end of all things. So let's uh do that pray one for another as we approach the throne. We'll sing this to brother Chad. Lead us in prayer. And he's ever interceding. [music] Amen. To the father for his children.

Lord, as we pray, Lord, give us patience to wait upon your answered prayer, Lord. Sometimes it's not always in the way that we would like it, Lord, but it's in the way that you have said it would be, Lord. And we just pray, Father God, for all those on the prayer list, Lord. We just pray that those that are requiring a special touch, Lord. We pray that you touch them, Lord, and and really touch them, Father God. We live in a world, Lord, that's just getting darker. The enemy roars, Lord, like a cunning lion, Father God, and sometimes he creeps up unaware, Lord. I just pray, Father, that anybody's going through any kind of attacks, Lord, that you touched him, that you be with them, Lord, that your angels gather around them, Father God. Lord, we pray for my employee, Lord. He is in a bad wreck, him and his family, and we ask, Father, a special blessing for him, Lord, and and his kids and his wife.

[music] The trials we may have [music] to face [singing] when we leaning on your grace. [music] It will be your strength [music] that guides [singing] us. Your love that makes us strong. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And through [singing] it all [music] we'll sing [singing] this song. [music] Amen. And praise the Lord. Here [singing] we are [music] lifting our hands. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, here [singing] we are [music] giving you thanks for all you do. [music] And as we praise [music] and worship [singing] your holy name. [music] For you are here dwelling within our praise. [music] And here we are. We're lifting our [music and singing] hands to you. Oh, here [singing] we [music] are. We're giving you thanks [music] for all you do. And as we praise [music] and worship your [singing] holy name [music] for you are here, dwelling within our praise. Amen. Lord, we've got something to praise and worship you about this morning. Lord, that we can stand in your presence, Lord, under the hearing of your word, Lord, and that we can be changed, Lord. That we have been changed and we're being changed even in these moments, Lord, as we can take in this word and let it do a work in our life, heavenly father. Lord, the soul is [music] sealed by the spirit, Lord. But the spirit and the flesh are coming into subjection day by day, Lord. You're giving us the victory, Lord, as we yield ourselves to you, Lord. So, we want to thank you this morning, Lord, for another year you brought us through, Lord. We want to thank you for a gift that you've given us, Lord, not just that you came and died, Lord, but that you came back, Lord, in the form of the Holy Spirit so that we could live a life that we could never live in our own. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're thankful this morning for the work that you've done. Lord, we're thankful for the work you're doing, Lord. And we're thankful, Lord, that it's a completed work in eternity, Lord, that we're walking into something that you've already written. It's something you've already spoken, Lord. It's already done, and we've just got to make it to the finish line. Lord, I pray you help us to keep our faith up, Lord. Get our eyes on you and keep them firmly there, Lord. As things in this world change, Lord, as they often do, Lord, may we just keep our eyes fixed on you, Lord. The author and the finisher of our faith, we pray. Lord, bless your people. Each one that's gathered here, Lord. remembering those that are sick, Lord. Remembering Jeremiah and Mary Beth, Lord, Sister Karen Wiffin, Lord, Sister Nadine, Lord, praying your grace to them, each one. Heavenly Father, Lord, your merciful touch we ask in Jesus Christ's name we're praying it. [music] Amen. And amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Luke chapter 2. Luke chapter 2. I want to bring greetings this morning from Brother Ed Hammermeister. I talked to him for maybe 10 or 15 minutes yesterday. At the end, he said, "Please greet the church. Send them my love." So, I'm sending that over the pulpit to you this morning from him. Amen. I sure enjoyed Brother Garfield's service on Wednesday night. But I did want to apologize or clarify when I said I thought we might need to pull the plug. That was not in any way insinuating that I wanted him to stop or he was going too long or anything like that. It's because I know what it's like. You get going and then you get into the good things of God. Brother Brandon, remember what he was talking about when he said uh how long a service should go. He says if we've got unbelievers here, he says 30, 45 minutes. He says, "But if we've just got believers here, we could go all night." Amen. And sometimes the preacher thinks we can go all night. And I know what that's like. So, Brother Grant, there was no disrespect meant whatsoever. I sure appreciated it. And I thought it was just a wonderful job just masterfully done. So, uh, we're thankful to the Lord for that. Amen. I wanted to clarify that we don't have service on Wednesday just to remind the folks and then we'll come back again on Sunday. Also, Brother Garfield's been sharing some videos from the churches in Jamaica that we helped and the roof is, I think, pretty much done at this point. Certainly the outside a bit of flashing maybe on the lower edges, but it looks like they've more or less completed that. So, wanted to thank the church for that. It's a wonderful thing that we can help them and just trust the Lord to help them as they try and get everything back to normal. Amen. I wanted to thank the church also for your very generous gift to me for Christmas. It certainly humbled me and I just wanted to thank you all for that. It certainly can go to good use with me needing a new car now. So, God bless you each one. Amen. Luke chapter 2. [snorts] Amen. It's a Christmas message this morning. Maybe not the one we're used to though, but we will still read this. And it says, "And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Sirenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child. And so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. And they were in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. And they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. And I want to take a very simple topic and thought this morning and I want to preach on good news this morning. And we look at this birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. And we spoke of it a bit in the the Christmas program. How we see that everything that happened in that birth was for a purpose. Amen. He was born in a stable. He wasn't born in a clean house. He wasn't born in a hospital or anything like that. And he didn't have a cradle to to rest in. He didn't have special clothes for him. and they wrapped him up like a a newborn lamb and they laid him in a manger and it was perfectly done because he was the lamb of God. And they used to take those newborn lambs that had no blemish and they'd wrap them up tightly so that they wouldn't hurt themselves. They wouldn't scrape themselves and then they'd lay them in that stone manger to protect them because they could be used for sacrifice later. And we talked on on that that Christmas program how that all the discomfort and all the frustration and all the hardship and all the pain and all the suffering that Mary and Joseph went through was for purpose. Amen. It was because he had to be born in a certain place at a certain time in a certain way and God had to get them into position &gt;&gt; so they could fulfill the word exactly. And you look at how God used pain and suffering and an oppressive government and taxation and long trips and these things to get them into position. Church, if you're a child of God, God uses situations to get you into position. Amen. Hallelujah. He wants to get you to a particular place. I loved how how brother Garfield brought this out on on Wednesday night, how he said, "We are not just living life. We are not just making decisions. We are not just having things happen to us. We do not just have conversations. We do not just run into people. Amen. Good things, bad things, that is not what it is. God has a purpose. God has a script that he is working from. Amen. And we may not realize it. We were talking about this with our daughter uh earlier this week. How do you know when you're in a trial for yourself or for somebody else? And and do we go through these things with the realization that there's purpose in it? or are we just trying to get through it? Because so often we want to avoid the pain. We want to get rid of the pain and we forget there's purpose inside of it. I remember a brother in Texas said, he said, "I've stopped asking God to take away the issue and help me to learn what he wants me to learn. &gt;&gt; Cuz when I learn what he wants me to learn, then I can get out of the issue." Amen. That's when he can move it on. Amen. But we may not realize it. We may not even like it at times. Come on. We may not even like what he's putting us through, but there is a purpose behind it. You know, I was playing hockey a couple of weeks ago and we were down 7 to2 and the guy next to me said, "We've got them right where we want them. We're losing 7-2." I said, "That's not." I said, "I'd rather be up 7 to2." He says, "No, we got them right where we want them." And we went back and we won 10 to nine. Now, that man was foolish. We shouldn't have won, but we had a superhero on our team that carried the team. Amen. But he said, "We've got them right where we want them." You know what? God does that sometimes. We can look at the the situation. We can look at the circumstances and we can say, "This is ridiculous. It hurts too much. It's it's too much bother. It's too much burden." And God says, "I've got you right where I want you. I've got Satan right where I want him, too." And what is he doing? He's trying to show you that he is in it. And when all seems hopeless, when it all seems too much, when you can't bear it anymore, then he comes through. And all you can say is, "Praise the Lord." Because it wasn't me. It wasn't me. I would have broke and I would have failed a long time ago. You know, I look back at my life so many times and I I I looked at so many decisions in the moment and I thought I'd made mistakes and I'd missed the will of God and I'd overstepped and these different things. And I would say, "How God, how can you be in this if it's so difficult? If it's it seems so broken, if it if it hurts too much, if the offense is too great, if I'm not being used, all these different things." And you look and you say, "Lord, where are you?" But you've got to realize God has to break you down so he can build you up. Amen. And he had a plan for me and he had a purpose for me. And I had to go through a lot of breaking before he could do a lot of building. Amen. And as we were going through those things, amen, I could come to a place where even today I could be a not just a minister, but I could be a pastor. And I didn't get here by my decisions. I didn't get here by my vision, by my strategy, by my foresight. It was the almighty hand of God that brought me to this place cuz I didn't want to be here. Didn't want to be here. I look at brother Garfield raising his hands. I get I'll tell you one thing. Never in his wildest dreams did he ever think I should move to Newfoundland. That's where I want to be. But here he is. And we trust that there's a purpose in those things. Amen. I look at the wife that I got. God had to pre-plan. God had to know where I was going to give me the right kind of wife for what I was going to be. I couldn't pick her. He had to pick her. He had to prepare. And I say, "Lord, praise you. I'll give you the glory for that today that you prepared a wife that could support me in this church in the way that's needed for a pastor's wife. I couldn't pick a pastor's wife. He had to pick a pastor's wife. I just thought I was marrying this pretty Mexican girl. I thought I was making the decision. Church, a child of God, we've got things we can make. Absolutely we can. I'm not saying we don't make our own decisions. But there's pivotal points where God has ordained for you to be somewhere, do something, and he makes sure you do it. Amen. That's what he does when he works with a child of God. Listen, I didn't like all the things that God did with me. I didn't enjoy it all. Can you say amen this morning? We don't always enjoy the work of a a child. No child enjoys chastisement. Nobody enjoys being broken down so that the potter can build us back up again. But if we're going to be of any use in the kingdom, we've got to get into position. And it takes the hands of Almighty God to do that. Amen. I was saying to somebody earlier this week, we'd live a more rested life if we could start with the faith that we usually finish with. When we go through hard times, if we could start with the faith we get at the end, when the trial's over, when we see the purpose, when we see what God was trying to do, if we could by faith say, "This is for my good, and God has a hand in it because my life is dedicated to him. I give him my life. I give him my mind. I give him my decisions. I give him my time. If you have given your all to him, then whatever happens is his handiwork. Amen. And if we could trust him upfront, how do we do that? We believe the word. Romans 8:28, he says, "All things work together for good to them who are the called according to his purpose." He did not say every individual thing is going to be good. He did not say every circumstance, every event, but he says collectively they work for your good, for your eternal good, not this temporal good. Amen. I'm not wanting to be a downer today. We're preaching on good news, but I want to say this. Good news does not always come the way we want it to come. It does not always say the things we want to say. Does not always do the things we want to do. But if it's from God, it is for our good. Amen. And so often we limit him because his ways are higher than our ways. His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. He knows what he's doing. We don't. And we limit him by setting our expectation of what and how he's going to do and when he's going to do it rather than letting him be God and us just be the little puny humans that we are. Amen. He's trying to get us into position. Amen. And he's brought good news to take us there. The angels came to the shepherds and they gave them this wonderful message of hope and love and peace and joy. I want to go back to that this morning because it's the inspiration for the service this morning. And it says there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. And they were so afraid. You notice when God starts moving, fear creeps in many times. Church, don't be afraid when God starts moving. God shakes things up a lot of times. Don't be scared when the shaking happens. Scripture says, "Everything that can be shaken will be shaken. But if you're firmly grounded on Christ, the word, you won't be moved." He says, "And the angel said unto them,"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be all people." I went to the Common English Bible for this. I didn't know who was going to be here, but it says this. The angel said, "Don't be afraid. Look, I bring good news to you." And here's the inspiration for the service this morning. wonderful, joyous news for all people. And he said, "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." And when you hear that a Savior has come, that ought to make you rejoice. And when you think about where those people were at that time, no doubt this would have absolutely caused their hearts to swell and they would think, "This is it. The Messiah is here. The Savior's here. Life is going to be different because life at that time was so difficult. They were under Roman rule. The Romans had conquered them 63 years before. So they were under heavy taxation. They were under oppression. They had a rule that if a Roman asked you to carry something, then you had to carry it for a mile. Didn't matter if you were busy. Didn't matter if you were in an urgent situation. Didn't matter if you had better things to do. They a Roman citizen could walk up to a Jew and just say, "Carry this for me." And you had to carry it a mile because they were the conqueror and you were the conquered. This is what they were living in. They had to ask permission. They couldn't they couldn't have their own laws that they could apply. They couldn't worship freely. Everything was under a Roman's thumb. Amen. And so whatever this this looked like, it wasn't fun. This was their day-to-day life was constant wonder and worry and fear. No freedom. They're in bondage. And 63 years of being under somebody's thumb will wear anybody out. I'm sure they were sick and tired of being sick and tired of these things. Amen. And so they wanted out of this situation. And so they they were believing that this Messiah was going to come and he was going to save them from the Romans. That's what they were looking for. Amen. These were a people that had a promise. They had a word promise of a land that they could have where they could be at rest. A place that would belong to them where God would be their God and they would be his people. And their greatest desire was for that Messiah because they wanted that promised land. They wanted that promised time where they could have peace and rest. And the scripture said of them, you know, that they would build and another would not inhabit and they would plant and another would not reap and and the ox would eat straw and the wolf would lay down with the lamb and all these different things. And you know, they go back to Isaiah 65 and read these things and they were so caught up in the benefits of the Messiah that they forgot why they needed him in the first place. You look at Isaiah 65 where it talks about all those promises and it starts and it says, "You're a rebellious people." It tells them their condition. It tells them why they got to where they got in the first place. And they forgot about how they got there. And they started focusing on what they were going to get when Messiah came. And they forgot about the real reason why he had to come in the first place was that they rebelled constantly. Amen. They they worshiped false idols. They constantly provoke God to anchor. Anger, it says, and they were living by their own thoughts, by their own dreams, by their own intentions. And that was the problem that needed to be resolved. They wanted to get rid of the Romans. Amen. But the promise of Isaiah 65, if you look at it, is actually first to the Gentiles because of the rebellion of the Israelites. The promise is first to the Gentiles and then the Israelites get it in the millennial kingdom. And then you go back to Isaiah 6 and perhaps that was the greatest one that they looked to because it said that the Messiah would stand up for the poor and he would bring equity to those that were suffering and he would have a rod of authority that would strike their enemies and and those that were harming God's people. And so they were all set up for a deliverer. They were set up for a prophet like unto Moses to deliver them. And Moses delivered them out of Egypt, but he never delivered them from themselves. And so only two went into the promised land. He delivered them out of their natural condition, but it never brought them into the promised land because they didn't change. Only the circumstance changed. &gt;&gt; Right? And so I look at at at these verses in Isaiah 65 and Isaiah 6, and we won't go there for the sake of time this morning, but I can imagine the priesthood preaching these things and say the Messiah is coming and look at the conditions we're around and he's going to deliver us from these conditions. They would have preached, "One day the Roman rule will be off of us. One day we'll be out from under the thumb of these Romans. One day we won't have to walk a mile for them. One day we're going to be set free." And they would have been preaching all those things. And it's I find honestly it's the same thing today where everybody's preaching about the freedom, but nobody's preaching about the condition. Everybody's preaching about the authority. Everybody's preaching about the power, but nobody's talking about where are you at and what's going on in your soul. Have you recognized your true condition and what needs to be changed? Because you can be healed every day of your life and still go to hell. You can be set free from your financial burdens and still go to hell. You can come to church every day and still go to hell. We're so often looking for the circumstances to change and that's not what he came to do. The problem is you can't fix the problem by changing the situation. That's what we all want. We're all praying for situ I'm not I'm not saying all of us. You know what I mean? The royal you people pray God changed the situation. Problem with that is when that situation goes away, there's just another one that comes down the road and a next one and a next one and the next one and all you're consumed with is God change the situation rather than God give me a way to go through the situation with victory. God, give me a way to go through these things where I can give you the glory, where I can have peace and rest in these times. Amen. And why is that? It because you just go from one situation to another situation because you're stuck in your own humanity. We're stuck in a broken condition. We're stuck in a broken world. And that means situations are going to come up no matter what. Jesus said, "You're going to have hard times. You're going to have persecution in this world." He never promised that would go away. You know, we're coming up to the new year and it's a time when people make New Year's resolutions where they make plans. They say, "There's going to be a new me. I'm going to uh stop doing this. I'm going to start doing that. I'm going to do better here and I'm going to do better there." And most make it less than seven weeks before they're right back to their original condition. And most go further than they were before. As you go back, you slide even deeper into the very thing you were trying to get out of. If you wanted to lose weight, you wanted to go to the gym, you go and most are out by seven weeks and they're back and they're heavier and less fit than they were when they started because the failure brings them into a a lower state of being and they just go back and they're even worse than they were. Why is it church? They tried to change their results without changing who they were. You can't do that. We can sit here all day long. We can say, "Lord, I need healing. Lord, I need a house. Lord, I need a car. Lord, I need a new job. Lord, I I need a a spouse. I need a place to live." And those things are true, but that is not our greatest need this morning. That's not our greatest need. But we think it is because that's what consumes our feelings. It's what consumes our five senses. It's what can consume our mind. But like I said, there's always going to be another burden. There's always going to be another situation. There's always going to be another problem, another issue around the corner. And we're never going to get away from it, church. Until we go into eternity, we will not get away from it. Even in the millennial reign, we'll still have problems. We've got to rule with the rod of iron in the millennial kingdom kingdom. That ain't because everything is perfect. No. Satan's bound by chains of circumstance, but you're dealing with still dealing with people that are going to have problems there. Amen. Salvation, a savior, is not about saving us from circumstances. That's just what our humanity wants. Save me from my circumstances. We want to be saved from the pain. We want to be saved from the suffering, from the worry, the difficulty. And our idea of salvation is take away the things that cause us that pain and worry or take away the circumstances of them. Amen. But church, we've got to be able to have peace in the storm. Whether the storm goes or whether the storm stays, we've got to be able to have peace in the storm. Amen. We need love not for those that are lovable, for those that are unlovable. We need to have kindness for those that don't deserve it. We need to have peace when everything around us is falling apart. And it is. It's broken. Everything's falling apart. We don't need the circumstances to change because the circumstances are there for purpose. But we're the one that needs to be changed. Amen. The freedom that Israel wanted had never lasted in the past. Once David left, once Solomon left, they never really could stick it out. They were in and out. They were up and down. They'd serve God. They they'd fall away. They'd come back to God. They'd fall away. And then eventually, they just fell away, church, and they stayed away. And it was just one person, one country after another. Amen. So God wasn't there to give them the freedom they wanted because that freedom didn't work. God had to come with a salvation that was greater than what they realized. God couldn't give them what they wanted because that wouldn't do them any good. God had to give them what they needed. And that's what God's here to do. Amen. I want you to hear what God had to say about the savior and what he would do. Says, "Then Joseph, her husband, you know, he finds out Mary's pregnant." He says, "Being a just man, not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately. So, he was engaged to her. She's pregnant, and he was just going to put her away and and not tell anybody about it. Just just let it go." But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying Joseph, thou son of David. Fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. He's going to save them from their sins. The angels come and they say, "We've got good news." And everybody says, "Great. The Romans are going to go." No, that was not the good news. The good news is I'm going to fix your condition. I'm going to con fix the thing that brought the Romans here in the first place. And before them, the Persians and the Babylonians and the Egyptians and the Philistines and all these different things. Church, I'm going to fix the root of the problem. &gt;&gt; And it's you. I'm going to fix you. I'm going to fix the condition that brought you here. Amen. The good news is not that we can cope with life, brother Garfield. Is it? The good news is that eternal life is for us. That before time began, God had a thought of us and he spoke it and he wrote it and he's calling us back to him. And so we don't have to go through this life coping. We can walk through this life with confidence and faith that God is with us that he loves us and he cares for us. The s the angel said to Joseph, he says, "This this this savior is going to save them from their sins. Not from their earthly circumstances, not from their hardships, not from their difficulties. No, he's going to save them from what keeps defeating them. What? Their sins, their unbelief, their inability to stick with the word of God. That's it. I'm going to make it so you can live a law you couldn't live before. I'm going to write it on your heart. I'm going to fill you with my spirit. I'm going to save you from your unbelief. Not the Romans, not the Philistines, not the Babylonians, the Persians, all these different ones. No. What kept defeating them was their own fallen nature. And that's what he came to save them from. Amen. Their habits, their their their ways of thinking, all these different things, their arrogance of thinking that they knew best. And worst of all, the religious cloak that covered it up that said, "I don't need to change. Everyone and everything else needs to change." Church, when all your prayers are for somebody else to be changed, you're in a backsliding condition cuz we are all in a process of being changed. We're all in a process where God is working in our life. Amen. He's got to come and save them from themselves. That's what he's trying to do. Remember what John would say. He said, "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health." We're praying for a lot of sick people these days. We're praying for a lot of rough situations. But he says, "I want you to prosper in health." Prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers. Amen. God is the savior of our soul. This flesh is not going anywhere. This flesh is unconverted. It's going to fight us the rest of our life. So God is saving our soul first. And the flesh, church, is a very distant second because it has to be completely changed. It has to be glorified to do anything that is of any value to us. Amen. And we see that in the scriptures. God makes let people's lives miserable. God will put them on their sick bed. He'll let people get in tough situations. He'll let people get so broken that they don't think they can be fixed. Why? Cuz this flesh has no value to him. He's here for a soul. Amen. And it's to get people to a place where they need something greater than they've got. greater than what they are. Self-help is no help, church, because self is broken and it's been broken since that faithful day in Eden. Amen. It's fallen from its original position. We need Christ to change us. Amen. To lead us and to guide us. You know, they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. And Israel did the same thing over and over and somehow expected that things would work out differently. And it never did. Amen. They had the same cycle of the ups and downs and the ever ins and outs and they never could come to a stabilized place, a place of rest, a place of security. They couldn't they wouldn't stay close to God in and of themselves. They just couldn't do it. Amen. They could never get out of their own way. Anybody else ever run into that? Just can't get out of my own way. Just keep making the same mistakes. Keep falling into the same pit. keep falling down the stairs at the same place at the same time. They looked at the Romans and they said, "They're the problem." No, they were tools in the hands of God and every other one before that. God would raise them up. God would use them and then God would destroy them. You ever read that? Go back and read Isaiah and Jeremiah. God will raise up a a country to take over Israel and then he'll he'll absolutely demolish them because they touched his children Israel. [laughter] You can't tell me there aren't classes of people in this gospel. God has his children and then there's everyone else. Amen. I'm glad we've got a God that knows better than we do. Amen. That he doesn't sit there and listen to what we think about the situation cuz God knows our real situation. God knows our real condition. God knows where we're at in our heart. Amen. Everyone else doesn't know. We don't even know. Like I I keep promising, we're going to preach on blind spots here in the not too distant future. We don't even know where our problems are, but God knows and our spouse if we've got one. God knows where the problems are. I want you to see this now. I want you to see what a savior does today because the gospel has not changed. The gospel has not changed. What worked then works today. Amen. God doesn't change. His ways don't change. The first recorded sermon we have for Jesus is two chapters later in Luke chapter 4. And it was a fulfillment of the prophecy of the Messiah. And now remember Jesus has come down. He'd been baptized at Jordan by John and the Holy Spirit comes in him. The fullness of God now comes into a human body. God dwelling in flesh. He goes into the desert for 40 days. He's tempted by Satan. He completely annihilates Satan, defeats him at every turn. And then he comes back out and he starts his ministry. And I want you to hear now and see how he starts his ministry. It says, "And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him throughout all the region and roundabout. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all." So he was showing signs and wonders, and he was preaching in their churches. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. Jesus went to church habitually. You know, we've got a real push against people going to church these days. Jesus went habitually. He says, "And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written." And here we go. Now, this is from Isaiah. He says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." Who's he coming for? The poor. Who are the poor? That word means beggarly, worthless. He's anointed me to preach the gospel to the beggarly and the worthless. What do they look like? He says, "He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, those that have been battered, those that have been crushed, those that have been shattered." He says, "To preach, to proclaim, to announce deliverance to the captives." Now this word captives is very interesting because the literal translation is to preach deliverance to the spears. See in those days they didn't say how many. They they'd say how big is the army? And they'd say they've got 10,000 spears. They were identified by the weapons that they carried. And what is he saying? He's saying we've got soldiers bound in prison that can't fight anymore. people that are meant to be out there destroying the works of Satan that are bound in a place that they can't get out of and they can't fight anymore. It means prisoners of war. So to preach deliverance to the prisoners of war and recovering of sight to the blind. They used to see, now they can't see. That word blind doesn't mean that they are completely blind. It means things are smoky. They're opaque. It's like you can you you know there's something there but it has no definition. You've lost the sense of what is correct of what is true. He says and to set at liberty them that are bruised. That word set at liberty actually means send out. And there's a beautiful thing here because that word the root word of bruised or that root that root of to set at liberty is the root word is apostle. He says to make apostles of those that are bruised, those that are oppressed, those that are crushed. So Jesus is saying, I'm going to take those out that are completely beat up by their humanity, by their circumstances, by their situations, by their genealogy, by their family traditions, religious traditions, whatever it might be. I'm going to take those that are so completely beat up that they can't do anything, and I'm going to send them out. And I'm going to turn them into apostles. I'm going to turn them into messengers. I'm going to turn them into people that can do something for the kingdom. And he says, I'm anointed to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, to proclaim, to announce that this is the year, this is the time of the Lord's favor and approval. Hallelujah. It says, "And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." In other words, Jesus is saying, "It starts today." You have been waiting for hundreds and hundreds of years for this scripture to be fulfilled. And he says, "It starts today." It's here right now. It's right in front of you. Amen. And church, what did he do after he said those words? Did he go out and destroy the Roman garrison in Jerusalem? Did he go and kick Pilate out of the palace? Did he go and scatter the enemies to the four corners of the earth? No. It says, "And all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and said, "Is not this Joseph's son?" How was he setting them free? He preached gracious words. And you know what happened, church? after he preached these gracious words. You go down just a few verses later and they tried to kill him. He's preaching liberty. He's preaching deliverance. He's preaching healing. He's preaching sight. And they went and they tried to kill him. Do you know why, church? Because he pointed to their condition. He pointed to their condition and he said, "Listen, look in the days of of Elijah and Elisha." He says, "There were many widows, but he went to a gentile widow. And there were many lepers, but there was only one gentile that was healed of leprosy." And what was he saying? He was saying, "Listen, you that call yourself the people of God have an awfully bad track record of accepting God's messengers, of recognizing the word when it comes your way." And church, he was trying to show them this can change. But instead they were offended at what he said and they tried to kill him. They were the natural seed of Abraham, but they were not the spiritual seed of Abraham because they couldn't receive the word of God. Listen to this. He says, "Now, how could those people ever to have failed to see who he was? How did they ever miss it? How could it be when it was so plainly made known and showed? How could they have ever missed seeing it? What a word." He says, "Think of it. This day is a scripture fulfilled before your ears. Who said it? God himself. Who's the interpreter of his own word? This day is a scripture fulfilled. The Messiah himself standing in the presence of the congregation and reading the word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then saying, "Today this scriptures fulfilled and they still failed to see it." He came in power and authority and demonstration doing exactly what the word said and they missed it. He says, "What a tragedy that would be, but it's happened. It's happened many times. He says, "How could it happen?" Of course, he says, "It's like it did in other times by believing man's interpretation of the word." That's what caused it. Those believers in those days, so-called believers, were taking the interpretation of what the priest had said about the scripture. Therefore, Jesus, not belonging to any of their ranks or their societies, he was excommunicated from their company. and therefore they could not identify him with them because he was different from them. He says the person of Jesus Christ was so unique that no one should have missing that that was the son of God because he was the perfect identification of the scripture that was written of him. And then he says that's the way any Christian is known when his life identifies the very things that the Christian is supposed to do. Not words only his life. He says now how could he stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled right before your eyes. How outstanding. How so plainly and yet those people misunderstood. He said why? It's because they took the interpretation of some order of priests that they were listening to. They missed the good news because they had a different message that had already filled their head. They were full up already. They didn't need anything else. They had already decided that they had all the truth, that they have figured it out. You know, I've said this before. I'll say it again. And I'd rather witness to somebody that doesn't know Christ than somebody that says they do. Because the one that doesn't know him can accept truth. The one that does believe they've already received him and known him. You've got to beat down a bunch of denominational walls to get to the truth. And it's so hard to do. Every single messenger of God and God himself dealt with it. People that had already decided what the word meant rather than letting God interpret it by bringing it to pass. What did it make them do, church? Made them reject their own Messiah. Made them reject the word made flesh. Reject the only one that could restore their sight, that could heal their condition, that could set them free and make them of use. Amen. Church, Jesus said, "It's the blind leading the blind." And light came and stood before them. And they rejected it. And they walked back out more blind than ever. And then wondered why nothing ever changed. How could it change? Their condition wasn't changed. You can't get different results by being the same person. And so they walked away and they lost every opportunity that they had to be set free. I'm here to tell you, church, you don't have to stay where things don't change. But the change has to start in here. That's the good news. The change has to start in here before he can start working on our circumstances. Amen. We don't have to have this mindset of always working and never finding the solution. We don't have to walk around bound by these things. Amen. This is the good news. Christ came with good news. And the good news is this. You can go free today. Today. Today is the day of salvation. Amen. Today the scripture is fulfilled in your ears. And he said, "This is what's possible. You're brokenhearted. I can heal it. You're blind. I can open your eyes. You're bound up and can't move. I can get you moving. But you got to take the light. You got to take the word when it comes your way. Amen. Church, I can't promise your situation's going to change. I can't promise your relationships are going to change. I can't promise you your finances are going to change. But I'm saying you can go free today. You can go free today. Amen. Jesus said, "I'm anointed to set people free. He didn't say, "I'm anointed to change all your situations." He said, "I'm anointed to set you free today." And that's what he offers every single time. He says, "I'm here to preach to the poor, the beggarly, the worthless." You know what we call him today, church? I'm here to preach freedom to the losers. To the losers. We say, "I'm not a loser." How's your victory track record look like? Because church, we're all losers. Oh, we build ourselves up. We say, "Well, I'm better than brother so and so or sister so and so, or I look at that person out in the world and I got way more than they do." Church, without him, we are losers. We cannot save ourselves and we're all going to the bad place. We lose and we lose and we lose. Eternally, we lose without him. Oh, some of us can make money and some of us can have good jobs and we can be No, no, no. That's not winning. That's temporal and it all fades away. Winning is the eternal side of things when we can look at that. Amen. Jesus would later say, he said, "Listen, those that are whole don't need a physician. Those that are healthy don't need a physician." He says, "It's the sick that need a physician." He says, "I came for the sick." He says, "I didn't come to call the righteous." And the word there is the self-righteous. I didn't come for them. And he says, "I came to call those that know they're a sinner, that know they're broken, those that know that they can't make it." And he didn't just preach it with words. He went out and he demonstrated what he was talking about. Not to the Romans. The Romans had nothing to fear from Jesus. He died under Roman rule, under Roman law. The Romans had nothing to fear. What had to fear? Satan. Because he went out and he started breaking change and he started opening eyes. Amen. Jesus was there for the lost sheep. He said, he said, "I've come for the lost. I've come for the sick. I've come for those that know they're a sinner." The one of the first things he did, church, was he went and he cleaned up Mary Magdalene's life. Scripture says she had seven demons. It doesn't tell us what they were. Now, if I were to guess in those days, a woman that was demonpossessed is probably the same as today. I'll bet you, this is brother John, this is not scriptural because again, it's silent. She was probably a loser. She was probably on welfare. She probably had common law relationships. She maybe she had a teenage pregnancy. Maybe she was a drug or an alcohol addict. We don't know. But I'll tell you this, Mary was not somebody you'd look at and say, "That's a child of God." She was bound completely by seven demons. And one of the first miracles he did was he set her free to do what? Serve him. And she stuck with him when nobody else would stick. She was one of the only ones that was always there. &gt;&gt; Why? One moment in the presence of Christ. Amen. That woman at the well church, she was the worst church member of church members. She was the worst. The absolute worst. This was a woman that went with man after man, never learning her lesson, always ending up in divorce, always ending up in disgrace. five divorces, gets up with another guy now, and she's living common law because she can't even get him to marry her. She's failed time and time again. And we look at that woman, and we'd say, "Worthless, broken, loser, unworthy. Why would you waste your time, Brother John?" But Jesus said, "I have to go by Samaria." Church, we are looking for the last seat. And if we got to dig in the dirt to get it, I say, "Lord, give me a good shovel. Give me patience to keep digging. Give me patience to keep turning things over. Patience to give people their opportunity." Amen. We're not here to say who's seed and who's not. We're here to shine the light. We're here to give them the good news. Amen. This woman had a broken record of making the same stupid mistake over and over again. That was her life story. Gotchi's enjoying the service this evening, this morning. [snorts] The same broken record. Those are the ones we think are hopeless. They just can't seem to get it. and church. And we can sit in this church and be a broken record. Hey church, we've all got battles to fight. We've all got battles to fight. And just cuz somebody doesn't see mine doesn't mean I don't have a broken record in my life, too. Come on. Amen. We're going to Listen, we got to This is This is church. We got to be real. I've got to be as real as you are. I'm asking you to be. Amen. We've all got broken records, but he's here to say, "Listen, I can set you free from your broken record. We can break the record. The track record is the past. Paul said, "Forgetting those things which are behind, I press towards the prize for the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus." That woman at the well could never realize she was the problem. And if she did, she couldn't fix it. The problem wasn't men. The problem was the woman. The problem was that she kept thinking that man's going to satisfy this desire I have in myself and it never did. Five straight marriages living with a six. But one day she meets Jesus and he has a personal conversation. And I want you to recognize something church. He has the same conversation with her that he had with those in Luke 2, Luke 4, sorry, where he goes and he points to their track record. And he comes to this woman and he exposes her track record. And where everybody else gets offended and kill wants to kill him, you know what she says? She says, "I know when Messiah comes, he'll tell us these things. He'll show us what we need to get fixed. and he'll not only tell us, but he'll give us the solution. And he said, "If you drink of the water that I have, you'll never thirst again." Cuz he knew there was a thirst that was driving her back to man after man after man. And there was something in her heart that was thirsting. And when a man came and said, "You're right. You don't have a husband. You've had five, and the one you're living with is no longer is not even your husband." She said, "I know that when Messiah comes, he'll tell us these things." Everyone else wants to kill him. [clears throat] Everyone else says, "You're of the devil." And she says, "We know Messiah when he comes, he'll tell us these things." And he says, "I am he that speaketh unto thee." Hallelujah. That woman that nobody would think had any value was worth 10,000 worlds to God Almighty. To where he would go into Samaria, he would take the longer road. He would take the the the the the people scoffing at him. The rejection of going to a place of half and half believers. Why? To find that woman who had something that was more valuable than everybody else. She had a soul that was crying out for and could receive the word of God. Buried under the muck of five divorces and a common law relationship. Church, does God know how to find his children? God knows how to find his children. It doesn't matter what you've got covering you up this morning. God knows what he's doing. Amen. Remember that woman after he talks to her, remember it says, "I'm here to set uh to bring deliverance to the captives, to get the spears working again." And as soon as he's done with her, she runs in and she says, "There's a man that told me anything, everything I ever did is not this the very Messiah." And a bunch of the city comes out on the basis of her testimony. She's effective. But when they get there and they stay there for a couple days and they say, "We believe because of what you said, but now we believe because of what he said." And they receive the same message that she received. And those people not too long in the in the in the future would go back and receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and they'd never ever be the same again. Amen. church. He came to preach to the broken, to the poor, to those that know I'm losing. And he came to make us not losers anymore. He came to bring victory into the camp. Amen. He came to turn beggars into witnesses or Christ. That's why we're here today, isn't it? I want the full treatment of the gospel this morning. I don't just want to say he saved my soul. I say, Lord, give me everything. Give me everything that you have. I want the full treatment because the full treatment includes a resurrection and a rapture. Amen. I don't want to have a church experience. I want to have a resurrection and rapturing experience. Amen. I want to have a life inside of me. I don't want to have to wait till the rapture to know he's alive. I don't want to have to wait till eternity to know he's a healer. I don't want to have to wait till he comes and shows his face to know that he's alive and well. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the full treatment here today. Amen. I don't want us to sit back here and say, "Well, I'm not hurt. I'm not worthless. I'm not losing. I'm not cold and formal. I want us to say, Lord, you see my condition. You see my hurt. You see my pain. You see my sickness. You see my worry. You see my concern. You see my frustration. Lord, you see my coldness and formality. But God, I'm here for the full treatment this morning. Why? Because the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach deliverance to the captives. blindness going away. When the Holy Ghost is in the building, I don't have to leave the way I came in. Amen. Church, I don't care if you take a big step or a small step today. Just take a step. Let him do a work in your life this morning. Amen. Lord, take one Lord, give me one step closer to victory, one step closer to home, one step closer to overcoming. Amen. Remember, we're in a redemption process. &gt;&gt; It's a process of time. And I don't care if it's from the pulpit to the back door. Every single one of us is in a process of being set free to do what? To serve him more completely, to express him more perfectly, to be used of him more easily. Amen. [snorts] You know, if you go through those automated car washes, they always have options, don't they? And they got the base, the base car wash, which is the base price, $9.99, but they've got the next one. And they, you know, the base wash is just you go in, they do a a quick rinse of your, you know, they they spray the car, they put soap on it, they quickly rinse it off, and then they air dry it. That's $9.99. Well, you can step up to the next level, you know, and with that one, maybe they'll throw on some liquid wax. But then you go to the the top, the premium, the luxury wash, and for only $5 more, they'll do an extra- long soap. They'll put a special uh soap on your wheels and tires to get all the brake dust off of them. They'll they'll put a a special polish. They'll they'll they'll make your car smell nice. And that's what they want you to do. They want you to go for the full treatment. Well, God wants you to go for the full treatment this morning. But the beautiful thing is that this treatment is without money and without price. He's paid the price. Now, you're going to have to lay some things down. You're going to have to lay some things down. First thing is to say, "I need it." Lay down your pride. Lay down your formality. Lay down this this stiff upper lift. Lay down this facade of being untouchable and say, "Lord, you know what's in my heart. You know what I need this morning." And then say, "Lord, I want the full treatment. Lord, let me have everything that you have to offer this morning." Church, I I know this is simple this morning, but the gospel has always been simple. The gospel is here to set us free to serve God. That's what it's always been about. To step into his word and let the word live through us. Everything Everything that God has for us is to draw us back into relationship with him. To draw us back into fellowship and bring us into a closer walk with him. And nothing can stop you when you're doing that. Nothing can stop you. [snorts] Listen to this. He says, "Jesus plainly explained it when he said to the woman that had been stooped over. He healed her. He laid her his hands upon her. She raised up and they began to find fault. The teachers did. He said, "Ought not this daughter of Abraham be loosed, set free from this bondage that she's been in of Satan." He says, "So Christ, our redeemer has come to do what? Set men and women free from sin and free from sickness." He says when he died at Calvary, he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed. He says now that's the good news. That's the gospel. The gospel is that Christ died and took the sinner's place. That Christ took the sick man's place. Christ took the sinner's place. Christ took the worried man's place. Christ took the maniac's place. You say, "I'm not a maniac." Some of us are running around like maniacs. He came to save us from running around like a chicken with his head cut off. I have had such a frustrating couple of weeks. And I'm saying, "Lord, help me to lay it at your feet." Not running around, not seeking this, not figuring this out, not trying to get that done. Just say, "Lord, it's in your hands." We need to slow down. [snorts] He said, "Christ took every place and freed us from every affliction and every sin that the devil put us in the prison house by." Christ came to pardon us freely. He said, "Everything goes free." Hallelujah. What a message this morning. Everything goes free. We read in Luke 4 how Jesus said, "I'm here to proclaim. I'm here to announce the acceptable year of the Lord. And what was he announcing? He was announcing freedom. He was announcing liberty. Amen. That's the gospel. It's freedom. It's liberty. And remember in the Old Testament, as we're closing this morning, they had a liberty year. They had a freedom year. They had what they called the Jubilee year every 50 years. And at that particular year and a particular day, at a particular time, they would blow a trumpet. And that year was the year of Jubilee. And when that trumpet was blown, every Israelite that was in debt, that was in slavery, that was in bondage of any sort, could walk away completely free. All debts erased. Not only that, they didn't have to pay what they owed, but they could go back and take what was taken from them. They got to go back to their original family inheritance that they got under Joshua. They could get back what they lost and they didn't owe what they they didn't have to pay what they owed. What a year that must have been, church. Every 50 years, God gave them a grand reset. Sometimes we need to realize, I need a reset. God guaranteed every person if they lived a typical length of time would always have one opportunity at least to have a reset. That's the grace of God, even under law. But now Jesus comes out. He announces a different jubilee because remember we're under a new covenant now. The law has been fulfilled. You don't get one in 50. Now it's a constant jubilee. It's a constant freedom because the anointing in the word hasn't changed. So the purpose of the word is to set you free, to set you at liberty, to break those chains that are holding you. And he was announcing a jubilee. He was blowing a trumpet and saying, "If you want to go free, you can go free. If there's a desire to go free, you can go free. If you don't realize you're bound, nothing's going to happen. But if you know you're bound and you want to go free, you can have it." He was starting a great jubilee and he didn't finish it in three and a half years. What he did was he demonstrated what it could do. But that jubilee really didn't fully start until the day of Pentecost when he came back in the form of the Holy Spirit and he started to live through you and I. He started to live in human flesh all over again. And they came down and they were completely changed. They were no longer bound up in themselves. Peter was no longer worried about self-preservation. He wasn't worried about death. He wasn't worried about if people knew that he was a friend of Jesus. All he wanted to do was tell people about Jesus. Why? He was completely changed. Amen. But Jesus would say here, "It's starting and you can go free." You know, those disciples had an experience with God for three and a half years. And an experience with God didn't hold them. An experience with God is just God getting your attention. It's letting you know he's there. It's letting him know he cares about you. You know, I think about that woman at the well. Listen to this. When he told her her track record and she realized he knew this before he started the conversation and he's still talking to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew who I was before he started talking to me and yet he's still talking to me. That's what a personal experience with Christ is like. He let you know, hey, I know your track record and I'm still talking to you. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I'm glad he talked to me. But that is just letting you know he's there. It's him trying to let you know who you are. But that experience will not hold you unless you come to a place where he goes from talking to you to living in you. It takes the Holy Ghost to anchor us. Amen. We want to become a vessel for God, not just say, "I met him." He's got to dwell inside of us. Amen. The disciples had a lot of wonderful ministries, a lot of wonderful things, but that didn't hold them. That experience didn't hold them. It took the inddwelling spirit. It took the true Pentecost where they went up under a promise and they stayed there and they prayed and they believed and they stuck it out until they got what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; That's it. Church, you say, "I'm lacking something." Stay there until you get it. Stay there until you get it. Brother Bam says, "If I don't get it, they're going to find a corpse out in the woods." He says, "Cuz I'm not moving till I get what I came for." Not what you want. What he promised, what he said, he's here to do. Amen. It changed those men from captives into true apostles, men on a mission for God. Listen to this. He says, "We can start a meeting, work signs and wonders." He says, "I notice it here. I go out and sometimes in the meeting blind see deaf hear the people come around look and say that's wonderful when the revival's gone you don't hear of them anymore they're right back out well yes I believe in that what is it they believe in the moving of God they believe in an experience with God but they don't actually have something that holds them he says what it needs tonight is not a new preacher what it needs is the Holy Spirit to get out amongst the people and go to stirring them up hungering and thirsting for righteousness sake. He said, "Blessed are they when they hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled." He says, "Whatever it is, it takes the Holy Spirit to do it." &gt;&gt; It doesn't take mom and dad giving you good advice. Doesn't take the preacher telling you over the pulpit what to do. It takes the Holy Spirit pulling something out that's in there in the first place. And that's what you're responding to. Amen. Amen. It's the inddwelling God that's going to make the difference here. It takes the spirit of God moving and then dwelling to produce what we're looking for. Otherwise, what do we do, church, do it on our own, and we fail on our own miserably. I speak from experience. Amen. It takes the inddwelling God to do it. Listen to what Jesus said. Again, I went with the Common English Bible because it it's just an easier thing for for many to hear. He says, "Therefore, if the Son makes you free, you really will be free." Church, you know when you've been set free. Hallelujah. You know when you've been set free. Listen, you don't know what desires I have inside of me, but I do. And I know what he's changed. And I know what used to be there. And I know what's there now. I know he has set me free. Amen. I believe we've got many testimonies of God setting us free this morning. But there are areas where we still need freedom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Absolutely we do. And I'm here to tell you the good news. He can set you free this morning. Amen. [snorts] Listen. When he makes you free, not when I choose a new direction. We're coming into the new year, church. Don't choose a new direction. Not I'm going to make different decisions. Not I'm going to get more disciplined. You are what you are. You are what you are. Again, I speak from experience. Amen. Not a new you. You got to die. It has to be Christ in you, the hope of glory. A new birth. That'll do it. And if you got it, say, "Lord, clean out the rooms of my life. Open up the doors and let the light shine into the darkness." Amen. When he sets you free, you'll be free. How does he do it? By the Holy Spirit taking that engrafted word and making it live out of your life. You got to take the word in and the Holy Spirit will live it out inside of you. That's the only way. It's got to be an inside out. Amen, church. This isn't this isn't advice here. This is eternal life. This is eternal life. Let him do the work and it'll be a real work. And you won't have to. You can stop trying then and you can start trusting and you can start resting in those things. Listen now. He says, "Notice, every slave, every slave, when he heard that trumpet sound, he could, here's our choice. He could throw down his hoe or whatever he was working with and say, "I am a free man. I couldn't redeem myself, but God through his grace has declared a year of jubilee. Therefore, I believe God and I don't have to work anymore." He says, "And the laws of the land claimed him free." He says, "What a beautiful type of today." Hallelujah. Let's listen to it. He says, "We poor aliens. Nothing we could do." Nothing we can do if we kept every Sabbath, every new moon, quit eating meat, if we kept all kinds of days, and did all kinds of religious sacrifice. He says, "We are under a load." Parents, let me talk to you this morning. Don't put a load on your children that they can't carry. Don't ask them to be a Christian without Christ because that is a load that puts pressure. It puts worry. It puts guilt. Preach freedom. We want our children to obey. We're here to help them. Protect them from themselves. But don't try and make them a Christian until they get the Holy Ghost. Teach them, show them, live a life before them of what it looks like, but do not force them to be what they are not yet. Otherwise, you put a load on them, that they are not fit to carry. He says, "We are sold in sin. Our parents sold us out to sin in the Garden of Eden, and we are laden under the bonds of sin as a slave to the devil." He says, "We're born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. There is nothing we can do to help us because our whole makeup, our whole nature and everything we are is sin. Amen. Hopeless, broken, crushed people, beggarly. We can't help ourselves because we don't have anything good to start with. It's all broken. He says, "But when the jubilee comes that we are free," he says, "the trumpet's the gospel, the good news." The trumpet was the gospel, then the good news. You're no longer bound. You no longer have to live in sin. You can go home and be free. You don't owe any debts at all. The whole emancipation of proclamation is signed and you are free. Notice he says, "No longer have to." Satan tries to make an absolute here. You have to, you know, you're weak. You know you're lost. You know you can't do it. You know you've tried. You don't have to. He says, "Why?" Because there's an absolute beyond Satan and it's the word and it says you can go free. You can go free. He says the whole emancipation proclamation proclamation emancipation is signed and you are free. He says and today when a man hears the good news, Christ died in yourstead. Nothing that you can do about it. Christ paid the price. He said, "The gospel sounds." You can drop every cigarette, every true tobacco, every whiskey bottle. And most of us are saying, "Well, okay, who cares? I don't do that anymore." Listen to this. Everything that's binding you and say, "I am free. This is the good news. Christ has made me free." He says, "You're a free people. You don't have to go any longer. You don't have to serve the devil any longer. You can be free if you desire to be free. Not mommy and daddy forcing you. Not the preacher forcing you, but there's a desire in your heart to say, "I want to be free." He says, "That's the one that can be free this morning." Amen. He says, "You don't have to drink. You don't have to run around. You don't have to mistreat your wife. You don't have to curse. You don't have to lie. You don't have to steal." Again, probably not really something this church needs. Catch this one. You don't have to be weary. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Anybody else feeling weary? I don't have to be weary this morning. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be weary. You don't have to be weary of planting and not seeing the harvest yet. Of giving and so rarely getting. Of working and not getting to play. Of serving rarely being served. of taking the slap on the cheek and never getting the satisfaction of coming right back with another one. You don't have to be weary. He says, "Why? You have the resources up yonder that's never been tapped of the bountiful blessings of God that the world knows nothing about." Now, catch this as we're closing. One more page. He says, "You say, I must have a little pleasure. A bag of chips and a pop. I must have a little guilty pleasure is what we usually call those things. I'm going to be a Christian, but I got to have a little taste of something I really shouldn't be tasting. We're closing. Are you with me? He says, "Why, brother, if you ever hear the good news of the trumpet, the worldly pleasure seems so little, you don't need it anymore. So much greater is this news than the old boundaries of slavery, the old marks of sin that caused you to be badeyed wretches by smoking cigarettes, alcoholics on the street trembling. He says, "You don't have to go that way. The gospel trumpet is sounding. Whosoever will, let him come and drink from the fountain of the waters of life." Hallelujah. You know, it reminds me of that testimony I shared of Selena talking to that lady at the at the stables that was saying, "Well, do you believe in alternate lifestyles and these different things?" And our answer is, "Listen, what we believe in is the is the the life-changing power of Jesus Christ. You come any way you are, but he won't let you stay that way. You won't want to stay that way if there's a child of God buried inside that soul." Amen. Let me close. I've got three short quotes here. I want us to be encouraged on this good news as we head into the holidays. He says, "For the gospel is delivered. It's good news." And this morning, the Holy Spirit through the word is bringing you the good news. Here's your good news. That from the foundation of the world, God wrote your name in the Lamb's book of life. All the devils out of hell can't erase it out of there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says God's word has spoken it just as sure to happen as God's wrote it in there before the foundation of the world. He says how glorious our heavenly father is in his infinite love and his mercy to do that for us. Now catch this. Now he said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your heavenly father is perfect." How can you be? He says, "When it's not my perfection, it's not your perfection. It's his perfection." What is his perfection? Of his word. Remember, God is perfect. His word is perfect. It is not a lie. of his word that he chose you and you never chose him. Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord this morning that his perfect word chose you and you didn't choose him. That means I can't unchoose him. I can't erase my name by my works. I'm not giving you an excuse to sin. I'm saying he's already chosen those who he had called, he justified, he sanctified. He has already perfected. He says he brought you into Christ and you are secured with Jesus Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God. No, he says, "For you're not standing with your own. You're standing in him with one thing. Here's your part, church. I believe God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "On the other side of Eden, what a wonderful time it'll be someday when you look back and say, why did I fear? Look at the joy I missed." Young man, young woman this morning or you old man or woman who has never been a Christian, God has continually knocked at your heart. He says, "Oh yes, you might come in at the end of the road, but you'll have no joy. [snorts] The thief on the cross had no joy. He never got to experience what he could have experienced so much earlier." He says, "You'll have no joy. There'll be no stars around you to shine. You're not bringing anyone with you. You did no work." That's true unmmerited favor. That's grace. He says, "But you missed out on an opportunity. We're going to preach on an opportunity in the new year." He says, "I don't want to stand like that. I want to hear him say, it was well done, my good and faithful servant. I want to show him my appreciation. Amen. Let's stand together if we would. He says,"I want to show him my appreciation." That's our response, not works. Appreciation. Lord, thank you. Lord, I love you. Lord, I worship you for what you did before I could ever choose you. Before I could ever make a a right step or a wrong step. Before I could go one way or go a different way, before I could get caught up in myself, you chose me before I chose you, church. He came to save us from our sins, not our situations. Amen. He came to restore us to fellowship, not financial freedom. Amen. He came to redeem us, to restore us back to the condition we had in his mind like Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden. Amen. He's [snorts] the savior of our soul. first and foremost. And that's what he's here for this morning. If he can get control of the soul, and we're going to get into this as we come back to our series on a position of dominion, when that soul has been set back to its original condition, and Christ is living out, it brings the spirit and flesh into total subjection to the place where he can resurrect and rapture us. Everything flows from the inside out. And we're saying, "Lord, change the outside in." He says, "That's not the way I work. When I get the preeminence, then I'll show the preeminence. And that's when you'll get the benefit. Amen. I was speaking with someone recently, and they're saying, "It seems more and more lately that God keeps reminding me that everything we touch is temporary. It comes, it goes." You know, my wife and I were reminiscing the other night and we were talking about all the things we've gone through and the places we've been. And we've lived in tiny little apartments and having, you know, no money left at the end of the month. And we've lived in nicer homes and we've rented and we've been here and busy places and smelly places and houses that were just mostly holes and not much else. We've had good jobs. We've had bad jobs. We've had appreciative churches and not so appreciative. We've been everywhere, done everything, been in every condition, financially, spiritually, career-wise, marily, everything. We've been through all of the struggles that you can probably imagine. And you know what? Through it all, when we had him, when we were focused on him, we were content. We were happy. I was as happy having $200 at the end of the month as I was with 2,000 at the end of the month. Cuz why? If you're in his will and you're walking with him, everything else tends to fade away. Doesn't mean you don't wouldn't appreciate more. And I appreciate more. I'd rather have more money than less money. I think most of us would. But I'll tell you this, it didn't change who I was when I had less. when I didn't own a house, living in a little apartment, dealing with noise above and around us. Old cars. I remember I had an old Honda Accord. We paid $2,800 for it. Had, you know, 250,000 km on it. Had the paint all fading on it. The clear coat was gone. It didn't matter. Church, much. Amen. When we've got him, that's our satisfaction. So many people are chasing everything except the one thing that'll satisfy them. Amen. Prophet God would say there's a little place inside of you that only he can satisfy. And when that's satisfied, everything else, that's where your satisfaction comes from. Amen. [snorts] My prayer this morning is, Lord, keep setting me free. Amen. Keep opening those doors. Keep raising those bars. Help me see where I'm not so strong. Help me to see where I'm bound up. And then, Lord, give me the full treatment. Give me the full gospel wash. Paul said, "By the washing of water, by the word." That's how he does these things. Lord, let your word have full control. Amen. That's the good news. If you want it, he'll do it. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, it's a pleasure and it's a joy to preach good news. Lord, it's a pleasure and a joy to know that you are a God that cannot and will not lie. Lord, there's no darkness in you. There's no shadow. Lord, there's no variableness. You don't whiffle waffle. Lord, what you say is right and it is true from the beginning. And Lord, you came down in flesh and you said, "I'm here to set you free." Lord, we need freedom this morning. We need liberty this morning. We need liberty to worship. We need liberty to live. Lord, we need liberty to trust, to rest. Lord, we need liberty to be anchored. Lord, we need liberty for healing, for direction. Lord, we need our souls to be healed. And Lord, we're coming to you this morning by your word, Lord, by the promise, Lord, that you would do it if we would receive it. So, Lord, you know each heart and soul here. Lord, you know where we're at. You know the broken records that are playing in our lives, heavenly father. Lord, you know our track records. You [snorts] know our ins and outs and ups and downs, Lord. You know our faults and failings. But Lord, we're here to confess this morning, Lord, that we want to be free. Lord, I pray you'd minister, Lord, that you would speak to our hearts and souls, Lord, as we worship you this little bit, Lord. Touch your people. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen. And amen. We're going to sing that song. Jehovah Gyra 7:22, my provider. Jehovah [singing] Jer my proider. [music] You [singing] are more [music] than enough for me. Jehovah, by your stripes [music] I been set [music] free. Jehovah [singing and music] Sham, you are with [music] me and you supply [singing and music] all my needs.
