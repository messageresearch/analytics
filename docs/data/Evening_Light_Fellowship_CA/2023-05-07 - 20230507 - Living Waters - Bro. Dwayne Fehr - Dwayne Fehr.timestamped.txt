[1:09:09] a land beyond the river
[1:09:11] to that
[1:09:13] you ever been taking up all this time

[1:09:17] talking I don't know why but you guys
[1:09:22] you guys just make me feel so at home
[1:09:23] and I just want to appreciate that this
[1:09:25] morning it's uh
[1:09:27] oh there goes all my little
[1:09:28] nervousnesses and
[1:09:30] you know why because the presence of God
[1:09:32] is here that's why
[1:09:34] so God bless you
[1:09:37] certainly do want to tell you we love
[1:09:38] you again bring you greetings for
[1:09:41] the Saints back at home and I'll be sure
[1:09:44] to take your love back home with me and
[1:09:47] I'll I'm going to go back and brag on on
[1:09:50] the newfoundlanders
[1:09:53] let me rephrase that the sons of God in
[1:09:55] Newfoundland
[1:09:57] I'm gonna go back and brag on them
[1:10:00] I suspect brother Dale some will end up
[1:10:02] like you I hope they don't come to live
[1:10:04] because I don't want to lose them
[1:10:07] anyhow
[1:10:09] I don't know if I can get started this
[1:10:11] morning but maybe I should
[1:10:14] you know brother Dale was giving me a
[1:10:15] hard time again last night he's like
[1:10:17] brother Dwayne you're only here one more
[1:10:19] service
[1:10:23] is it okay if we sing this morning is it
[1:10:29] honey why don't you come take the piano
[1:10:31] for me
[1:10:32] for a minute don't go away guys
[1:10:34] this is my new backup team while I'm in
[1:10:36] Nova Scotia Newfoundland Newfoundland
[1:10:44] just wanted
[1:10:45] to see how much I appreciated those
[1:10:46] specials all these young ladies moms
[1:10:49] yeah did I just say this you know I just
[1:10:52] believe that the church is a body
[1:10:56] you know I don't believe I've been to
[1:10:59] too many places and been you know too
[1:11:02] often gone and and I just don't believe
[1:11:05] that the churches is just elders and I
[1:11:08] don't believe the church is just
[1:11:09] middle-aged people and I don't believe
[1:11:10] the church is just young people but I
[1:11:13] have been to churches where it's only
[1:11:14] Elders that are left and I've been to
[1:11:16] churches where it's only young people
[1:11:18] and you know there's not there's not
[1:11:21] hardly even an elder around and I I just
[1:11:23] don't believe that was a God had in mind
[1:11:26] you know every generation has the value
[1:11:29] of that generation cannot go on it
[1:11:32] cannot go unnoticed it cannot go
[1:11:33] unappreciated uh and yet the Zeal of the
[1:11:38] young people coming up because God knows
[1:11:40] as we get my age and we start pushing
[1:11:42] the upper limits you know we want to go
[1:11:45] but her body doesn't want to keep up
[1:11:47] anymore
[1:11:48] and so when you see the young people
[1:11:49] coming on I think God how precious it is
[1:11:52] and then when I see moms God bless you
[1:11:54] sisters moms standing there singing with
[1:11:59] their children
[1:12:01] to tell you what it's that was precious
[1:12:02] to me it really was and I wanted to say
[1:12:04] God bless you whoever whoever went to
[1:12:06] all the effort of getting those kids to
[1:12:08] play like that oh my goodness bless your
[1:12:10] heart that would be a challenge
[1:12:15] this is a little song and uh
[1:12:19] I don't know the lord gave it to me
[1:12:20] years ago
[1:12:22] I'll take this one brother
[1:12:23] so the Lord the lord gave me this song
[1:12:25] many years ago
[1:12:30] I'll go through battles in life
[1:12:32] we all go to struggle no matter what
[1:12:35] stage we're at this journey that we're
[1:12:37] on is a battle
[1:12:39] and we're not promised you know a bed of
[1:12:43] ease while we're here
[1:12:45] but we are promised that if we'll fight
[1:12:46] the good fight that when we get there we
[1:12:48] can rest
[1:12:50] and so this this song Just
[1:12:53] is maybe a little bit like that just
[1:12:55] encourage you in your battle this
[1:12:56] morning
[1:12:58] foreign
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:34] well seems so much greater
[1:13:39] I wonder
[1:13:41] Lord how King I stand
[1:13:49] and down on my knees

[1:14:08] and he lived

[1:14:20] he's still
[1:14:22] in commands
[1:14:27] he says
[1:14:31] [Music]

[1:15:16] Could Only See
[1:15:19] there's no such thing as failure
[1:15:24] why it's all
[1:15:26] just according
[1:15:29] to his play
[1:15:34] we'd stand up tall
[1:15:38] and confess
[1:15:41] our God is able
[1:15:43] he has promised
[1:15:46] your Heir too this land

[1:16:17] whatever I have started I chose a new
[1:16:23] child

[1:17:39] what is in the elements he's the one
[1:17:42] that places it all together you know
[1:17:44] when he puts you together he knew just
[1:17:46] what you were made out of
[1:17:49] you say well brother Dwayne you just
[1:17:51] don't understand you don't know where I
[1:17:52] come from
[1:17:53] and I don't care
[1:17:57] God planted you where he planted you for
[1:17:59] his glory
[1:18:01] you know what you uh
[1:18:03] here I was and you know I was raised in
[1:18:05] a message home and I thank God every day
[1:18:08] uh for my parents and for the for the
[1:18:10] blessing that he it allowed me to be
[1:18:12] raised that way
[1:18:14] but regardless of what home you came out
[1:18:16] of and regardless of how dirty or or or
[1:18:19] or deep you were planted in the muck in
[1:18:21] the mirror of of the sin of this world
[1:18:24] you're here
[1:18:25] you're here
[1:18:27] look at when the sun comes up and and

[1:18:37] honest and uh
[1:18:39] and I love to fish even though I don't
[1:18:41] get to do it very often and but I'll
[1:18:43] tell you what if it hadn't been

[1:18:53] like little ones not like those great
[1:18:55] big things that were crashing the other
[1:18:57] day

[1:19:00] I mean it wasn't Resurrection I'd like
[1:19:02] to go fishing there's one boat out on
[1:19:04] the on the water and I thought that

[1:21:27] Lord help me this morning please
[1:21:29] Revelations chapter seven if you got
[1:21:31] your Bibles why don't we stand together
[1:21:32] we'll just change your positions for a
[1:21:34] few minutes and
[1:21:43] Revelations chapter 7 and I myself have
[1:21:46] been
[1:21:48] I would guess I would say on a little
[1:21:49] journey the last couple years a couple
[1:21:51] years ago I started into the Book of
[1:21:52] Revelations and I got I don't know what
[1:21:55] it was about it but it so inspired me it
[1:21:57] so begin to throw my soul and maybe it
[1:21:59] was just the time for me and uh you know
[1:22:01] I just beginner this is the bride's book
[1:22:04] this is the bride's portion right here
[1:22:06] and we got the whole Bible as the
[1:22:08] bride's portion but when you get to the
[1:22:09] Book of Revelations you and I actually
[1:22:11] have a revelation
[1:22:13] and the rest of the world is still just
[1:22:14] grasping at it trying to oh we just
[1:22:16] don't understand it but you and I
[1:22:17] actually have an understanding and and
[1:22:19] we thank God for that this morning and
[1:22:21] so the Lord will help me I want to speak
[1:22:23] on Living Waters this morning
[1:22:25] Revelations chapter 7 starting at verse
[1:22:28] 9 it says and after this I beheld and
[1:22:32] Loa great multitude which no man could
[1:22:34] number of all Nations and kindreds and
[1:22:36] peoples and tongues to stood Before the
[1:22:39] Throne and before the lamb clothed with
[1:22:42] white robes and Palms in their hands and
[1:22:44] of course we're not going to stop on all
[1:22:45] these because we would just be here for
[1:22:47] the next couple years and and it says
[1:22:49] and uh
[1:22:51] robes Palms in their hands and cried
[1:22:53] with a loud voice saying salvation to
[1:22:55] our god which sitteth upon the throne
[1:22:58] and unto the lamb and all the Angels
[1:23:00] stood round about the throne and about
[1:23:02] the elders and the four beasts and fell
[1:23:04] Before the Throne on their faces and
[1:23:06] worshiped God saying amen and blessing
[1:23:09] and glory and wisdom Thanksgiving honor
[1:23:13] and power and might be unto our God
[1:23:16] forever and forever
[1:23:18] amen and one of the elders answers
[1:23:20] saying unto me what are these which are
[1:23:22] raid in white robes and once Kim and
[1:23:25] once came they and I said unto him sir
[1:23:28] thou knowest
[1:23:30] and he said unto me these are they which
[1:23:32] came out of Great Tribulation have
[1:23:35] washed their robes and made them white
[1:23:37] in the blood of the Lamb ah somehow I
[1:23:40] believe I was standing there at that
[1:23:42] time
[1:23:43] you know this whole book is a book of
[1:23:45] Prophecy so John was already caught up
[1:23:47] into it into the into the eternities
[1:23:48] into an element of Revelation and I
[1:23:51] believe it's just for us now therefore
[1:23:53] are they Before the Throne of God and
[1:23:55] serve him day and night in his Temple
[1:23:57] and he that sitteth on the throne shall
[1:23:59] dwell among them
[1:24:01] and they shall hunger no more neither
[1:24:03] thirst anymore neither shall the
[1:24:06] sunlight on them nor any heat
[1:24:09] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[1:24:11] the throne shall feed them
[1:24:13] and shall lead them unto living
[1:24:15] Fountains of water
[1:24:18] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:24:21] their eyes
[1:24:22] can we bow our heads for a moment one
[1:24:24] more time Heavenly Father
[1:24:25] or we're so grateful for your word this
[1:24:28] morning Lord it is our life we ask
[1:24:31] father that the great spirit of God
[1:24:32] would come this morning Lord once again
[1:24:35] that you would show yourself real
[1:24:37] minister to the hearts of your children
[1:24:38] Lord break the bread of life to them
[1:24:40] personally
[1:24:42] or let them know you love them and you
[1:24:44] care in Jesus name we ask amen
[1:24:47] amen God bless you and take your seats
[1:24:49] again this morning
[1:24:51] and I just want to uh I want to I want
[1:24:54] to look into this scripture this morning
[1:24:56] just a little bit and I need to set a
[1:24:58] little background so if I trust that
[1:25:00] will be okay for a few moments here but
[1:25:02] when we get to looking at the Scripture
[1:25:04] it says you know for the lamb which is
[1:25:05] in the midst of the throne shall feed
[1:25:07] them and when if you were to you know if
[1:25:09] we were to mention that word throne we
[1:25:11] get to we get to thinking uh we we get a
[1:25:14] mental picture of what that should look
[1:25:16] like and and you know sometimes when we
[1:25:19] get our our mental pictures you know
[1:25:21] things books we've read and and and you
[1:25:25] know documentaries you've seen and and
[1:25:27] all these different things we get mental
[1:25:29] pictures in our mind but
[1:25:31] sometimes those pictures actually cause
[1:25:33] us trouble when we get to reading the
[1:25:35] scripture they begin we find something
[1:25:37] that conflicts it's not really what God
[1:25:40] even though it's a it's maybe a shadow
[1:25:42] or a type but it's not really what God
[1:25:44] is trying to say it's not really what
[1:25:45] God means and and so you know we we get
[1:25:49] this idea sometimes that you know that
[1:25:51] God being so great in him being a king
[1:25:54] and him being Lord of all and you
[1:25:56] forgive me if I if if I'm just a little
[1:25:58] bit off this morning but but you know
[1:26:00] you you would get to thinking uh uh that
[1:26:02] you know God somewhere is out in the
[1:26:05] eternities he's sitting on a great
[1:26:07] throne and you know he's sitting in in
[1:26:09] his Royal robes with his crown on his
[1:26:11] head and and he's sitting there in all
[1:26:13] of his glory and all of his majesty and
[1:26:15] you know he's got this huge you know how
[1:26:17] you know the chairs I'm talking about a
[1:26:20] great magnificent chairs it's all
[1:26:23] stately and kingly and we get that kind
[1:26:25] of a picture when we're reading the
[1:26:27] scripture and we see that word thrown
[1:26:28] you know we think well that's you know
[1:26:30] there he is he's it's the king of kings
[1:26:32] and look at him in his majesty and his
[1:26:34] plan and I don't say that he's probably
[1:26:36] not that way but but we need to we need
[1:26:39] to forget about him being somewhere else
[1:26:41] out in the eternities
[1:26:43] and so I I want to bring this down you
[1:26:45] know we we get to looking at a mode in
[1:26:46] another dimension and brother Brown
[1:26:47] would speak this way and sometimes when
[1:26:49] we're in prayer we find ourselves
[1:26:51] actually in subconsciously thinking you
[1:26:55] know you get to praying and and you get
[1:26:58] down in your knees or you get to talk in
[1:27:00] the Lord and you're praying to something
[1:27:02] like way out there
[1:27:04] you understand what I'm saying this
[1:27:05] morning
[1:27:06] we're praying to God that's like way out
[1:27:08] there in eternities but I know you hear
[1:27:09] me Lord even though I can't see you but
[1:27:11] some words he's way out there but but
[1:27:13] he's not
[1:27:14] even though he is he's not
[1:27:17] as a fact you know brother Brown would
[1:27:19] make this statement you know that you
[1:27:21] know when Jesus
[1:27:22] was praying
[1:27:24] and he was praying In The Garden of
[1:27:26] Gethsemane and he was wrestling it out
[1:27:28] and and you know somebody would say to
[1:27:31] him you know well you know he was
[1:27:33] praying to God the father and brother
[1:27:35] Brown would come and say no he was
[1:27:36] praying to the God that was in him
[1:27:39] the God that was in him
[1:27:42] and so I I need to break this this
[1:27:44] thinking this morning of of a God in all
[1:27:47] of his Splendor even though I believe he
[1:27:49] is all of that
[1:27:50] but I need to break that mental picture
[1:27:52] that that he's sitting somewhere in a
[1:27:54] great throne in eternity you know Jesus
[1:27:56] said I'll go to sit on my father's
[1:27:58] throne and we get this mental picture
[1:28:00] that that's what it is
[1:28:01] but I think sometimes we're missing the
[1:28:03] actual revelation of what God is doing
[1:28:05] and brother Brown would say this as I
[1:28:07] get started here this morning you say
[1:28:09] this heavenly father is in prayer right
[1:28:11] now he says we are approaching listen to
[1:28:13] this we are approaching the Great Mighty
[1:28:16] Throne of God
[1:28:18] as mortal beings in a natural body and
[1:28:21] yet our voices speaking out words that's
[1:28:24] coming into that great Throne somewhere
[1:28:27] in the other dimension where God sits so
[1:28:31] you see brother Brown actually the same
[1:28:33] way we do
[1:28:34] he was praying but there's a greater
[1:28:36] reality to this
[1:28:38] and I want to take God and bring him
[1:28:40] where he is this morning even though
[1:28:42] he's omniscient so he covers all space
[1:28:44] all time you know he's he's omnipresent
[1:28:46] he's just there he's God but but I want
[1:28:48] I want to bring it to a different spot
[1:28:49] we would you know because God didn't it
[1:28:52] was never God's purpose
[1:28:54] to remain the Unseen God or he never
[1:28:56] would have created this Earth
[1:28:58] he never would have created Angelic
[1:29:00] beings he would never would have created
[1:29:01] cherubims and seraphims you say well yes
[1:29:04] that's that's God I mean he needs
[1:29:05] worship but it was never his idea to
[1:29:08] remain unseen he was trying to express
[1:29:10] himself and the only way he could begin
[1:29:12] to express himself because he is a
[1:29:15] Heavenly creature
[1:29:16] he's not an earth-bound creature like we
[1:29:19] are he would have to start in his
[1:29:21] expression would have to start in the
[1:29:23] heavens
[1:29:25] and then he would begin to condescend
[1:29:28] right around would say this that he when
[1:29:29] he created man he created him for a
[1:29:31] purpose and that's because God himself
[1:29:33] was lonely
[1:29:35] and God wanted fellowship and God's not
[1:29:37] just this spirit that floats around out
[1:29:40] there but he is actually a being
[1:29:42] he is actually a being and and so we
[1:29:45] know that you know in the condescending
[1:29:47] of God God would come down and and he
[1:29:49] would find himself not find himself he
[1:29:51] would create himself a tabernacle of
[1:29:53] Flesh
[1:29:54] and he would come and step into that
[1:29:57] Tabernacle and so in Matthew 28 we would
[1:29:59] find out that we would read a scripture
[1:30:01] like this that says you know it says all
[1:30:04] power in Heaven and Earth Jesus would
[1:30:06] say has been given into my hands
[1:30:09] all the power in Heaven and Earth all
[1:30:11] the power in Earth has been given unto
[1:30:14] me
[1:30:15] all right
[1:30:17] and my brother I would say what was it
[1:30:19] man and God had United
[1:30:23] now what was Jesus
[1:30:26] I mean we could look at him and we
[1:30:27] immediately think well he was the
[1:30:29] Redeemer he was you know he was the he
[1:30:31] was the great Lamb of God and yeah he
[1:30:33] was all of that but what actually was he
[1:30:35] he was actually the first of a new
[1:30:38] creation of God
[1:30:40] he was the first of a new creation of
[1:30:42] God even though he was all flesh he was
[1:30:44] all God
[1:30:45] it was all you know it wasn't just God
[1:30:47] in the Yonder somewheres now God had
[1:30:49] literally been birthed out and a body
[1:30:52] had been you know he had eaten he had he
[1:30:54] he you know he had I I would say this he
[1:30:57] had sucked on his mama's on his mama's
[1:30:59] breast he had nursed his just like just
[1:31:01] like every one of us had been born he
[1:31:03] subjected he became us like us
[1:31:06] that we could become like him
[1:31:08] so when we get to looking at these
[1:31:10] things you know you know the reality was
[1:31:12] that God was God was no longer just out
[1:31:15] in the heaven somewhere else now he's
[1:31:16] here and I want to I want to drop this
[1:31:18] in brother Brown says man and God had
[1:31:21] United the logus had been made flesh and
[1:31:25] had been killed and rose again for our
[1:31:27] justification and was the and was then
[1:31:30] the anointed Emmanuel forever now listen
[1:31:32] to quotes God changed his Dwelling Place
[1:31:36] from a throne Yonder out in the spaces
[1:31:38] Yonder
[1:31:40] to the heart of his son
[1:31:42] Christ Jesus to live and to Reign
[1:31:44] forever
[1:31:46] so was was the Throne of God still out
[1:31:49] yonder when Jesus was on Earth
[1:31:52] no
[1:31:54] no now Jesus had become that God had
[1:31:57] changed where he left
[1:31:59] The Eternity that he dwelt in he'd
[1:32:02] stepped into a body of Flesh and now
[1:32:04] that body had become
[1:32:06] Throne of God
[1:32:08] why the throne because the throne is
[1:32:09] where the king sits
[1:32:12] and when a king sits what he's what if
[1:32:14] if the only way you can be a king is if
[1:32:16] you have a kingdom
[1:32:19] and if you have a kingdom that means
[1:32:20] that you have a Dominion if you're the
[1:32:22] king
[1:32:24] and so that Tabernacle of clay that you
[1:32:26] know I keep looking up because at home
[1:32:28] we have the picture of Christ over here
[1:32:29] so I keep looking for that and I see
[1:32:31] you've got it right where it belongs you
[1:32:33] know where everybody can see it but
[1:32:35] that was the Throne of God
[1:32:37] that was the Throne of God while it was
[1:32:39] on Earth listen he said God was in
[1:32:41] Christ he's the final resting place of
[1:32:45] the spirit
[1:32:46] the spirit stayed tabernacled uh the
[1:32:48] spirit stayed in a tabernacle one day he
[1:32:51] gets to talking about you know trying to
[1:32:53] show the shadow of it in the Old
[1:32:55] Testament about how that God would come
[1:32:57] down with the children of Israel and
[1:32:59] find himself not just in the outer court
[1:33:02] and you we all know this because you've
[1:33:03] been taught well not just in the inner
[1:33:05] court but in the holiest of holies God
[1:33:07] would come to dwell there why would he
[1:33:09] come to dwell in a Tabernacle in a
[1:33:12] tabernacle of of tents and and a box of
[1:33:14] wood why would he come to do that
[1:33:17] to show that God what he wanted to be
[1:33:20] with his children
[1:33:22] listen he was trying to express it he
[1:33:24] didn't want to just stay Yonder you know
[1:33:26] they would say they followed him out by
[1:33:27] a pillar of fire which he was at night
[1:33:30] in a cloud a cloud during the day which
[1:33:32] he was the expression of what he was but
[1:33:35] Jehovah God would come and he would
[1:33:37] dwell with his children
[1:33:39] right in the same you all remember the
[1:33:41] scriptures they had there they had all
[1:33:43] their camps and all four sides of the uh
[1:33:45] you know of the Tabernacle of God and
[1:33:47] it's all a great representation of what
[1:33:49] what God is trying to accomplish and we
[1:33:51] don't have time to go into this this
[1:33:53] morning but the reality was that that
[1:33:55] right in the center of it all
[1:33:58] God would take his Dwelling Place
[1:34:02] and the only ones there was only one man
[1:34:04] that was allotted to go Beyond the Veil
[1:34:06] then
[1:34:07] but since the veil has been wrenched
[1:34:09] since Christ has died and the veil has
[1:34:11] been rent you and I are obligated to go
[1:34:14] Beyond the Veil and to go into the
[1:34:16] holiest of holies listen now it's death
[1:34:19] to stay just just to stay out in the you
[1:34:21] know justification is a good thing and
[1:34:23] out in the out in the outer Court they
[1:34:25] had justification they they'd bring
[1:34:26] their lamb and and the sacrifice would
[1:34:28] be made for them and they'd walk away
[1:34:30] justified in the eyes of God and that
[1:34:32] was a great thing and sanctification was
[1:34:35] a great thing they'd go into the you
[1:34:36] know they go into the inner court and
[1:34:38] there they would take their position
[1:34:40] their lives were clean they were they
[1:34:42] were you know God had done a work in
[1:34:44] them and their you know there was the
[1:34:45] the show bread and there was the
[1:34:47] candlesticks and and there was all you
[1:34:49] know the priests would do the work from
[1:34:51] the inner court and that and we've been
[1:34:53] called to be Kings and Priests and that
[1:34:55] was a great thing but but that is not
[1:34:57] where God wanted his children
[1:35:00] God himself was beyond that he was in
[1:35:02] the Holy place
[1:35:04] and he was actually waiting to bring his
[1:35:06] children listen what would happen when
[1:35:08] everyone would go behind the veil
[1:35:11] listen even the dead rod
[1:35:14] would Bud overnight
[1:35:16] and if his walk wasn't just right when
[1:35:18] he got behind the veil
[1:35:20] they would have pulled him out they
[1:35:22] would have dragged him back out he would
[1:35:23] have been a dead man
[1:35:25] but he and he alone was welcome to come
[1:35:28] be behind the veil
[1:35:30] well that was just a shadow of you and I
[1:35:33] he was a high priest he was he was the
[1:35:35] one that was making it but here we are
[1:35:37] and we The Veil The Way has been made
[1:35:39] and we have been invited I'm getting way
[1:35:42] off my topic this morning again Lord
[1:35:43] help me this morning you know we've been
[1:35:45] invited to go Beyond the Veil to get it
[1:35:48] to find ourselves in the place where God
[1:35:50] dwells and and so we know that that Ark
[1:35:53] was you know the ark was made out of
[1:35:55] wood and oh such beautiful types in the
[1:35:58] scripture but the ark was made out of
[1:35:59] wood and that's a representation of you
[1:36:01] and I just our Humanity
[1:36:03] but the reality was is when the when
[1:36:06] when God showed Moses how to build it it
[1:36:09] was literally encased in gold
[1:36:12] and what does gold represent deity
[1:36:16] that means that that the Life of Christ
[1:36:18] is greater
[1:36:20] than your life when God's looking at it
[1:36:23] he's looking at his life he's not
[1:36:24] looking at at the at the mortality of
[1:36:27] you know the wood the humanity of man
[1:36:29] he's not looking at that he's looking at
[1:36:31] the Gold that has been beaten out and
[1:36:33] and it's made it's been made a precious
[1:36:35] work before him just like the
[1:36:37] candlesticks in the old you know how the
[1:36:39] candlesticks in the Old Testament Moses
[1:36:40] he he sees the type and a shadow and
[1:36:42] here I'm getting off my notes again Lord
[1:36:44] help me this morning
[1:36:46] but we see Moses when the when the
[1:36:49] Candlestick is was made when those
[1:36:51] candlesticks were made which was a which
[1:36:53] was a type of the seven Church ages that
[1:36:55] would be and not just the church ages
[1:36:58] but literally your life would be around
[1:37:00] your life would be wound up in those
[1:37:02] ages
[1:37:03] and brother Brown would say that when
[1:37:05] Moses saw the the Candlestick being made
[1:37:07] he saw a lump of pure gold
[1:37:11] and that Candlestick was formed out of
[1:37:13] one lump of pure gold
[1:37:17] and a prophet would come and tell us
[1:37:18] that that those candlesticks represented
[1:37:20] the church ages
[1:37:22] and the life that was in the ages
[1:37:27] and what's it made out of
[1:37:30] gold
[1:37:31] which is
[1:37:33] Christ
[1:37:34] in the ages remember he's the one that
[1:37:37] walked in the midst of the seven golden
[1:37:39] candlesticks it's Christ in the ages I'm
[1:37:42] so thankful he looks on us this way Lord
[1:37:44] help me this morning anyhow you know God
[1:37:47] said he was looking at uh you know he's
[1:37:49] he's looking at uh at the Tabernacles
[1:37:52] that they made for him and he said you
[1:37:54] know silver and gold I I I I I I I have
[1:37:57] it all I don't need any of that what I
[1:37:58] need is a body
[1:38:00] and he says a body hast thou prepared
[1:38:03] for me
[1:38:03] and we would say we look at Jesus Christ
[1:38:05] this morning and we know he was the body
[1:38:09] of he was the body of Emmanuel God he
[1:38:11] was he's the body of Jehovah God
[1:38:13] manifested in this world and and brother
[1:38:15] Brown would go on to say this he said
[1:38:17] listen he said uh there's there's going
[1:38:19] to come a day you know Jesus said is you
[1:38:22] know I I sit with my uh you will sit
[1:38:24] with me in my Throne as I sit with my
[1:38:26] father and his throne and he'd say just
[1:38:27] a minute there there is going to come a
[1:38:29] day
[1:38:30] that Jesus is literally going to sit on
[1:38:32] a throne on a physical Throne you and I
[1:38:35] will be there in that new kingdom he'll
[1:38:37] sit on the throne of David and he will
[1:38:39] be king of kings he will be Lord of
[1:38:41] lords just like he would have been all
[1:38:43] along and just like he is to us this
[1:38:44] morning but he'll actually be there you
[1:38:47] and I will be able to you know wrap our
[1:38:49] arms around we'll be able to get down
[1:38:50] and kiss his precious feet and he'll
[1:38:52] just be he'll be there for us and he'll
[1:38:55] reign in that kind of a in that kind of
[1:38:57] a situation or as that kind of a king
[1:38:59] but but now now it says now listen
[1:39:02] brother Brown says this and he that
[1:39:04] overcomes will sit with me in my Throne
[1:39:06] as I have overcome and sat on my
[1:39:07] father's Throne he's wanting to come
[1:39:09] back and he says now where is his
[1:39:11] Earthly Throne the Throne of David God
[1:39:13] said he'd give him the Throne of David
[1:39:15] in the millennium
[1:39:18] okay so now we're back to that picture
[1:39:21] in our minds about a throne he'll give
[1:39:23] him the Throne of David in the
[1:39:26] Millennium he'll sit on David's throne
[1:39:28] and we'll see him the great king of
[1:39:30] kings sitting there there he is he said
[1:39:32] now now he's setting on his father's
[1:39:35] throne in other words
[1:39:37] now he brings it right back home today
[1:39:39] now he's sitting on his father's throne
[1:39:43] in other words he's setting in God's
[1:39:46] power
[1:39:48] now let's get an understanding of the
[1:39:50] throne
[1:39:51] here he is he's setting in the power he
[1:39:54] actually has the authority as king he
[1:39:57] has Authority overall he's got dominion
[1:40:00] over all things listen brother Brown
[1:40:02] would say this that even Satan has to
[1:40:04] come and ask permission like he did job
[1:40:07] hey have you considered my servant joke
[1:40:10] and then and when God draws a line in
[1:40:12] the sand that is as far like we don't
[1:40:13] have to fear about our lives when God
[1:40:16] draws a line in the sound that is as far
[1:40:18] as say he might take you to the door of
[1:40:21] death but unless God has called your
[1:40:23] name to come up Beyond the Veil Satan
[1:40:26] cannot take your life he just can't do
[1:40:29] it
[1:40:30] and so God as king sits on he's sitting
[1:40:33] he said on my father's Throne he's
[1:40:35] sitting there in the reality he is a
[1:40:37] king right now
[1:40:39] all right he said he's sitting in God's
[1:40:41] power in his Spirit now but when he
[1:40:44] comes back
[1:40:46] he'll set in an Earthly body
[1:40:49] on David's Throne I'm just establishing
[1:40:52] something here this morning
[1:40:53] so we we see that there was there was a
[1:40:56] throne that God had he had a Dominion in
[1:40:58] heaven and now we see God has moved from
[1:41:01] the heavenlies down into an Earthly
[1:41:03] Tabernacle which was the god man
[1:41:06] The One and Only God man that there was
[1:41:08] at the time
[1:41:09] and the Dominion of God has come down
[1:41:11] from the heavens and now Jesus says I
[1:41:14] judge all things
[1:41:16] I judge all things
[1:41:17] now the very Throne of God is in the
[1:41:20] Tabernacle of Christ I'm talking about
[1:41:22] when he was here on Earth
[1:41:24] but Brett Brown would say this God has
[1:41:26] three Thrones
[1:41:28] he's got three Thrones
[1:41:31] we think well that's kind of strange
[1:41:33] but it's not if we understand what God
[1:41:35] is really trying to do
[1:41:38] what God's really trying to accomplish
[1:41:39] what was the threefold purpose of God
[1:41:41] brother Brown would speak to this I
[1:41:43] think in the spoken words Original Seed
[1:41:45] what's the threefold purpose of God the
[1:41:47] first thing was God wanted to be able to
[1:41:48] express himself
[1:41:50] to make himself known
[1:41:52] then he wanted to have preeminence
[1:41:54] he wanted to to show them that he was
[1:41:57] King then he wanted to have preeminence
[1:41:58] in a bride body
[1:42:00] and then he wanted to restore the
[1:42:02] kingdom
[1:42:03] all right so listen brother Brown says
[1:42:06] this
[1:42:07] the first Throne was in heaven now
[1:42:09] listen close he said the Shekinah Glory
[1:42:10] was raised from The Mercy Seat one day
[1:42:12] in the Tabernacle he said father judges
[1:42:14] no man but he's committed all judgment
[1:42:16] to the son God's judgment seat wow he
[1:42:18] says he says you speak to me it'll be
[1:42:20] forgiven you speak uh be forgiven you
[1:42:23] speak against me it'll be forgiven you
[1:42:24] uh speak against another one that's
[1:42:26] coming now listen what brother Brown
[1:42:28] says he says you speak against the son
[1:42:30] of man I'll forgive you but someday the
[1:42:33] Holy Spirit Will Come
[1:42:36] and dwell in the hearts of the people
[1:42:39] now watch mom my goodness you talk about
[1:42:41] the Judgment of God
[1:42:43] you know there's Jesus when he was he
[1:42:45] was on Earth there's Jesus when he was
[1:42:46] on Earth
[1:42:48] and they begin to call him Beelzebub and
[1:42:50] they call them all sorts of vowel names
[1:42:51] and he would be he would so much as say
[1:42:53] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:42:55] they're doing
[1:42:56] father forgive them that you know they
[1:42:58] had to do that for our sake he said
[1:43:00] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:43:01] they're doing and he would stand there
[1:43:02] and saying you say these things now and
[1:43:05] I'll forgive you for it but there's one
[1:43:06] coming the Judgment of God was was going
[1:43:09] to become more since it was going to
[1:43:10] become more severe
[1:43:13] because the one that's coming behind me
[1:43:16] Now isn't that just a good Trinity thing
[1:43:18] it's not just perfect for the Catholics
[1:43:20] there's God the Father there's Jesus and
[1:43:22] and he said when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:43:23] there's another so now we have three and
[1:43:25] that's such nonsense
[1:43:27] but the spirit of God when he begins to
[1:43:29] come again you speak against him now
[1:43:32] he's got a redeemed body
[1:43:34] you know I think the scripture would say
[1:43:36] this you know we go to the communion
[1:43:37] table and say yeah we read the scripture
[1:43:39] where we talk about you know that many
[1:43:42] are weak and sickly among you because
[1:43:43] you don't discern the body of the Lord
[1:43:46] and we think well that's just the broken
[1:43:48] bread and the wine and that has nothing
[1:43:50] to do with it that's just that that's
[1:43:51] those are just that's just the the you
[1:43:53] know what we take and what what we do is
[1:43:55] as what's been given to us but I'm
[1:43:57] looking at the body of the Lord I'm
[1:43:59] looking at the body of the lord we don't
[1:44:01] discern the body of the Lord and brother
[1:44:03] Brown would say this he goes back to
[1:44:05] scripture he says he says but the holy
[1:44:06] spirit will come and dwell in the hearts
[1:44:08] of the people and one word against it
[1:44:11] it will never be forgiven
[1:44:13] oh how careful are we to be how careful
[1:44:16] a hot way to be listen brother says it
[1:44:18] keeps getting more severe more severe
[1:44:20] all the time the Judgment because God is
[1:44:22] continually wearing his patients out
[1:44:24] trying to get Sinners to come to Christ
[1:44:26] to be reconciled first he was in the
[1:44:29] heavens
[1:44:30] above shining through the Stars second
[1:44:34] he was on the earth shining through the
[1:44:36] Shekinah Glory
[1:44:38] next
[1:44:39] he came and went and was made flesh and
[1:44:42] dwelt Among Us he's still wearing his
[1:44:44] patience out
[1:44:46] then he redeemed Man by the blood and
[1:44:49] came into his church in the form of the
[1:44:52] Holy Ghost
[1:44:54] and speak against that
[1:44:56] and it's a finished thing it's done
[1:44:58] now you can see the shaking time that
[1:45:00] we're in where he says the people just
[1:45:02] don't realize people can't comprehend
[1:45:04] what it means now listen what he says
[1:45:06] the first Throne was in heaven
[1:45:11] the Judgment seat the second throne was
[1:45:14] in Christ
[1:45:16] the third throne
[1:45:18] is in man
[1:45:21] all right
[1:45:24] the third Throne is in man and brother
[1:45:27] Brown would go on to say this God chose
[1:45:28] man's heart for his con for his control
[1:45:31] tower the devil chose his head for his
[1:45:34] control tower see he makes him see
[1:45:36] things and look through his eyes but God
[1:45:38] it's God in his heart makes him believe
[1:45:40] things that he cannot see
[1:45:43] he said did he of course we would say
[1:45:45] amen he said see God is on his heart in
[1:45:48] the heart of man is the Throne of God
[1:45:51] oh
[1:45:53] well hold on
[1:45:55] now the big picture of the big ornate
[1:45:57] chair that the king I I think we're
[1:45:59] right about the time that the new king
[1:46:00] is going to be you know crowned here
[1:46:02] pretty soon and and I you know I just
[1:46:05] seen a little clip here when we were
[1:46:06] staying the other night man they got a
[1:46:08] golden Chariot what would you call that
[1:46:10] that Carriage whatever it was I mean it
[1:46:13] is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful
[1:46:18] and he's a sin-born
[1:46:21] unregenerated filthy dirty defiled I say
[1:46:25] well brother Dwayne don't say that about
[1:46:26] our King listen I don't care what kind
[1:46:28] of man he is God is not a respecter of
[1:46:30] person it takes the blood to cover it
[1:46:33] all
[1:46:34] you look at him been married divorced
[1:46:36] ran around and and all the filthiness in
[1:46:40] this world is going to count him King
[1:46:43] I'll tell you what I'm thankful for a
[1:46:45] king he didn't come in a chariot a
[1:46:48] splendor like that you know all the eyes
[1:46:50] of the world weren't on him he'd come in
[1:46:52] in humility brother Brown would say this
[1:46:53] he said God uh he said did you get it
[1:46:57] ma'am
[1:46:58] God made his throne
[1:47:01] in the heart of man
[1:47:03] so now I want I want to I want to just
[1:47:06] go back and read that scripture again
[1:47:07] I'm just going to read verse if we can
[1:47:09] just get on down to about verse 17.
[1:47:13] I want to read that scripture again if
[1:47:14] you got it
[1:47:17] says for the lamb and and maybe just
[1:47:20] take and leave it up there if that works
[1:47:21] all right
[1:47:22] verse 17 we'll go back to Revelations
[1:47:24] chapter 7 and verse 17 and now I want to
[1:47:27] take my text from here now that we've
[1:47:29] established this for the lamb which is
[1:47:32] in the midst of the throne
[1:47:35] shall feed them
[1:47:37] and shall lead them unto living
[1:47:39] fountains
[1:47:40] of water
[1:47:42] for the lamb which is in the midst
[1:47:45] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[1:47:49] the throne
[1:47:50] come on don't you go and put it off way
[1:47:52] into the Millennium somewheres
[1:47:54] don't you go wait till he's sitting on
[1:47:56] his throne and you know in the
[1:47:58] Millennium for the lamb which is in the
[1:48:00] midst of the throne where is the Throne
[1:48:02] of God in the heart of man
[1:48:06] for the lamb which is in the mid where
[1:48:08] does the Holy Ghost come to dwell in the
[1:48:11] heart of man what did the Holy Ghost
[1:48:13] promise to do to you I will lead you and
[1:48:16] guide you into all truth
[1:48:19] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[1:48:22] the throne will lead you and guide you
[1:48:26] what does it say will lead you unto
[1:48:28] living Fountains of water
[1:48:32] and they say well yeah but brother
[1:48:33] Dwayne it says and God shall wipe away
[1:48:35] all tears from their eyes well I didn't
[1:48:37] do very good in school but those two
[1:48:38] little dots that's a correlation that
[1:48:41] all he will also do that
[1:48:43] but let's look at it the way it's look
[1:48:45] at the way it's written for the lamb
[1:48:47] which is in the midst of the throne
[1:48:49] that's the holy ghost that is sitting on
[1:48:52] the throne of your life right now shall
[1:48:54] lead you and shall feed you and Lead You
[1:48:58] unto living Fountains of water all right
[1:49:02] so I want to look at this little this
[1:49:04] little thought of of waters and and
[1:49:06] living Fountains of water and it's
[1:49:09] always been God's purpose you know
[1:49:10] brother Brown would say this if you get
[1:49:12] God on the inside then then everything
[1:49:14] that you begin the moral Gods you get on
[1:49:16] the inside the more you look around you
[1:49:18] you begin to see more of God on the
[1:49:20] outside I'll tell you what you get in
[1:49:22] love with the author of the book and
[1:49:24] he's gonna he's gonna show you he's
[1:49:26] going to reveal to you his little hidden
[1:49:27] secrets his little love letters here I
[1:49:30] am here I am in your midst listen not
[1:49:33] just in the midst of the congregation
[1:49:35] here but in your midst in this vessel
[1:49:38] right now here I am in your midst of if
[1:49:40] we could just recognize that God has
[1:49:43] come to to be crowned the king of my
[1:49:45] life I want to Crown Him King in my life
[1:49:48] I want him to have dominion in my life
[1:49:50] when you get the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:49:53] now he's promised to lead you and to
[1:49:55] guide you through life and where is he
[1:49:57] at is he is he out there he honor yes he
[1:49:59] is but he's in his word and he becomes
[1:50:02] the quickening spirit that literally
[1:50:05] quickens his word gives you dominion
[1:50:08] over sin gives you a dominion over your
[1:50:10] flesh gives you dominion over over the
[1:50:13] lust of the eye and the lust of the
[1:50:15] Flesh and all these things that Satan
[1:50:17] would use to drag you down now the god
[1:50:19] that's in you come on Church the god
[1:50:22] that's in you not just the god that's
[1:50:24] around you listen Peter and Paul and not
[1:50:26] Paul Peter and James and John and and
[1:50:29] all the disciples they had Jesus around
[1:50:31] them they they they were right there and
[1:50:33] and there he was in his ministry and
[1:50:36] they surrounded him and I tell you what
[1:50:38] he'd even gave him them power over over
[1:50:40] unclean spirits and over devils and and
[1:50:43] giving them the ability to you know to
[1:50:45] cast out devils in his name and preach
[1:50:48] the gospel and and but they have Jesus
[1:50:50] there around them
[1:50:52] and then one day he wasn't around them
[1:50:54] and they found this man that had
[1:50:55] epilepsy and and you know he he got you
[1:50:59] know that he went into a fit and and
[1:51:01] they began trying to cast these Devils
[1:51:03] out and the devil wouldn't leave and it
[1:51:04] wouldn't leave and it wouldn't leave it
[1:51:06] and finally Jesus came and said why
[1:51:08] couldn't we cast The Devil out and he
[1:51:09] looked right at him and said oh ye of
[1:51:11] little faith and not many days hence not
[1:51:14] long after that Jesus gets called to
[1:51:16] that little point in his life where he's
[1:51:18] got to be willing to die to death and
[1:51:20] Peter or that man that had sat there
[1:51:22] with him and said I'll go with you to
[1:51:24] the death I'll stand right beside you
[1:51:26] remember Jesus around them there's a
[1:51:29] difference here Jesus around them
[1:51:31] absolutely standing in a I want to say
[1:51:34] in a Sanctified condition and Jesus
[1:51:36] would look at him and say Peter before
[1:51:38] this day is over you're going to deny me
[1:51:40] three times
[1:51:41] not on your life Lord you know Peter
[1:51:43] just had that kind of a he was just bold
[1:51:45] like a lion and he said not on your life
[1:51:47] I'll go with you to the death and Jesus
[1:51:49] looked right at him and said not today
[1:51:50] you won't
[1:51:52] not today you want but Peter when you're
[1:51:54] converted
[1:51:56] strengthen your brother
[1:51:58] you know so many times we come to this
[1:52:00] place in our lives where where the
[1:52:02] spirit of God you know we we've got I'm
[1:52:05] gonna say we got the best of it all we
[1:52:07] got the full word of God being revealed
[1:52:09] to us and yet just knowing that God sent
[1:52:12] a prophet don't save you just knowing
[1:52:14] that there that a message has come to
[1:52:16] deliver us don't save let me rephrase
[1:52:19] that maybe it'll save you but God don't
[1:52:22] want you to stay there I'll tell you
[1:52:24] what every Israelite that came in could
[1:52:26] bring their lamb and they could be
[1:52:28] justified for their sins and sit in the
[1:52:30] congregation and enjoy the Fellowship of
[1:52:32] the brothers and and it felt so good but
[1:52:34] they would still go back out and fall to
[1:52:36] the same things over and over and over
[1:52:39] and over and bring their lamb back God
[1:52:41] forgive me again and over and over and
[1:52:44] bring their lamb back and God forgive me
[1:52:46] again and he did and he did he's God and
[1:52:49] he loves us but God wasn't Desiring for
[1:52:51] them to stay there in the outer Court
[1:52:54] God was desirous that they would that
[1:52:56] they would move from a state of
[1:52:58] justification to the state of
[1:52:59] sanctification here's here's the
[1:53:01] disciples standing in an absolutely
[1:53:03] Sanctified condition standing there you
[1:53:06] know you know Jesus says literally he's
[1:53:08] there with them
[1:53:10] but he knew he wasn't going to be with
[1:53:12] them forever
[1:53:13] the plan of God was listen I'm not going
[1:53:15] to be with you forever I'm going to come
[1:53:17] back though and I'm going to live in you
[1:53:20] and it's going to give you power to
[1:53:22] stand the test of time it's going to
[1:53:24] give you power against the enemy you're
[1:53:26] you're going to have what it takes
[1:53:28] because Jesus had that power he was that
[1:53:30] God he had the ability in him to
[1:53:32] withstand every test and overcome every
[1:53:35] enemy he could just stay he was that God
[1:53:37] and here's his disciples around him and
[1:53:40] they want to listen they want to be like
[1:53:42] Jesus
[1:53:44] and you and I sing that song over and
[1:53:46] over to be like Jesus to be like oh on
[1:53:49] Earth I long to be like him but do you
[1:53:51] really
[1:53:53] do I really
[1:53:58] because he had
[1:54:00] no home to go to
[1:54:03] you got a nice home
[1:54:06] I got a comfortable home
[1:54:10] Ed
[1:54:12] no place to lay his head
[1:54:16] but I can come here
[1:54:18] or I can go to Alberta
[1:54:20] or I can go to British Columbia
[1:54:22] or I can go across the ocean
[1:54:24] and there's Saints like you that would
[1:54:25] give me a place to lay my head
[1:54:27] but he had no place to call his own
[1:54:30] he was literally despised and rejected
[1:54:34] of all men
[1:54:36] well yeah but not his children
[1:54:38] oh let me let's back up a little bit
[1:54:40] Peter before this day is over
[1:54:43] you'll deny me three times
[1:54:45] no way Lord
[1:54:47] no way Lord
[1:54:49] you go back and read your Bible and
[1:54:51] literally when Peter is put on the spot
[1:54:52] and you know he's standing there in that
[1:54:55] court and Jesus has been taken in there
[1:54:57] he's standing there in the court and
[1:54:59] Peter's you know it's cold out and I'll
[1:55:02] tell you what you get away from God and
[1:55:03] you'll get cold
[1:55:04] you get cold real fast he's standing
[1:55:07] there by a fire trying to man-made fire
[1:55:09] trying to warm himself and and and and a
[1:55:12] woman says to him hey
[1:55:14] you look Vaguely Familiar are you one of
[1:55:16] them
[1:55:18] no no I don't know anything about those
[1:55:20] people
[1:55:22] and then they begin to communicate
[1:55:27] she says hey
[1:55:29] you talk like them people
[1:55:31] I'll tell you the bride the Bride of
[1:55:32] Jesus Christ talks different
[1:55:34] all right we have a different language
[1:55:35] we got a pure language a Heavenly
[1:55:38] language and Peter had been around
[1:55:39] Christ long enough that he caught the
[1:55:42] way he talked and hey you even sound
[1:55:45] like him the Bible says that Peter
[1:55:47] literally cursed
[1:55:50] can you imagine
[1:55:52] can you imagine brother Gerald
[1:55:55] what a testimony
[1:55:57] what a testimony
[1:55:59] Peter literally cursed I don't know him
[1:56:05] here's the good part
[1:56:08] you realize that Judas did the same
[1:56:10] thing
[1:56:11] sold them out for 30 pieces of silver
[1:56:14] and God said I'll never forgive it
[1:56:16] Son of Perdition he fulfilled his part
[1:56:20] Peter did the same thing walked away
[1:56:22] from me he didn't sell him out but
[1:56:23] walked away and cursed
[1:56:25] proclaimed I never knew him I had no
[1:56:27] part of him
[1:56:30] but the grace of God
[1:56:32] cause he was already elected to be a Son
[1:56:36] of God the grace of God covered it
[1:56:38] anyhow it's not precious ain't that
[1:56:40] precious man here I am off my notes
[1:56:42] again Mercy
[1:56:44] I don't know what you people do but
[1:56:45] you're doing something to me and that
[1:56:47] I got to get back to my notes because
[1:56:49] otherwise we're going to be here
[1:56:51] till lunch
[1:56:54] I want us to just jump back and look you
[1:56:56] know when we think about the the water
[1:56:58] I'll lead you to Living Waters
[1:57:01] Living Waters
[1:57:03] and you know if we just jump back to we
[1:57:06] could go back to the Book of Genesis and
[1:57:07] we could you know we could have a look
[1:57:09] at we begin to see God as he begins to
[1:57:12] unveil and express himself and what's
[1:57:14] the first thing that we that we find
[1:57:16] happening in Genesis after creation is
[1:57:18] all set up and you know the Garden of
[1:57:20] Eden is all set up and I'm going to jump
[1:57:21] into Genesis chapter 2 for a moment here
[1:57:23] and I'm just going to begin to read it
[1:57:24] because I want us to I want to catch us
[1:57:26] I want us to catch something here said
[1:57:27] in the Lord God planted a garden
[1:57:29] Eastward in Eden this is verse 8.
[1:57:32] the Lord God planted a garden Eastward
[1:57:34] in Eden and there he put the man
[1:57:37] whom he had formed
[1:57:39] now watch the wording
[1:57:42] and out of the ground
[1:57:44] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[1:57:48] that is Pleasant
[1:57:49] to the site
[1:57:51] and good for food
[1:57:54] now watch what he says
[1:57:59] the tree of life also
[1:58:01] in the midst of the garden
[1:58:03] and the tree
[1:58:05] of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:58:09] who was the Tree of Life
[1:58:13] who's absolutely Christ Jesus Christ
[1:58:16] who was the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:58:18] and Evil
[1:58:20] Satan
[1:58:25] what were the other trees in the garden
[1:58:26] then
[1:58:29] if one was a man and the other was a man
[1:58:33] what were the other trees in the garden
[1:58:35] just food for thought
[1:58:39] we'll go on I just want you to catch
[1:58:40] that
[1:58:41] this morning
[1:58:43] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:58:45] Evil and a river
[1:58:47] went out of Eden
[1:58:50] to water the garden
[1:58:53] and a river went out of Eden to water
[1:58:56] the garden in other words God himself
[1:58:58] the great husband and planted a garden
[1:59:00] in this earth and it needed to be
[1:59:02] watered
[1:59:03] now we're just looking so many so often
[1:59:05] we look at these things and we just read
[1:59:06] them natural and we get these and
[1:59:08] they're they are as natural but listen
[1:59:10] does God is God not a husband man
[1:59:13] is he not the one that loves to tend the
[1:59:15] garden is he not the one that said he
[1:59:16] would prune the trees these branches
[1:59:18] that don't bring forth out for well hold
[1:59:20] on
[1:59:21] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:59:23] about people's lives
[1:59:24] he's talking about men that the great
[1:59:27] God of creation is beginning to express
[1:59:30] himself even in his creation he's coming
[1:59:33] down and he's beginning to express
[1:59:34] himself what is this great Garden of
[1:59:36] Eden we want to look at that spot and
[1:59:38] say well it was the paradise of God but
[1:59:41] the word would say that that every
[1:59:42] fruitful tree every good tree was there
[1:59:46] in the garden and that that kind of tree
[1:59:48] was good for it was good the ones that
[1:59:50] would sustain you and I
[1:59:52] trees that would sustain you and I just
[1:59:55] love it you know you begin to go through
[1:59:56] the scripture and you find trees that
[1:59:58] represent kingdoms and and trees that
[2:00:00] represent Nations and trees that
[2:00:02] represent Kings and what was it it's
[2:00:05] that God is trying to express himself
[2:00:07] he's trying to show a pattern there's
[2:00:09] trees there that literally are going to
[2:00:11] feed his children
[2:00:14] and can I say it this way God has still
[2:00:16] had trees all down even though this
[2:00:19] world has become sin cursed there is
[2:00:21] still trees that God fruit trees that
[2:00:24] God is using to feed his children and
[2:00:26] I'm looking at an old oak tree sitting
[2:00:28] in the back right now that God has used
[2:00:30] us to feed his children for the last 40
[2:00:32] years he's given to you a weekend and
[2:00:36] week out he's been faithful he's he's
[2:00:38] literally been standing by the River of
[2:00:40] Life and sucking up the the moisture of
[2:00:43] God so that he could do what give out to
[2:00:45] you and every now and again you know
[2:00:47] maybe the season would change and and
[2:00:50] like we have a fall season and a winter
[2:00:52] and a spring and he'd call somebody else
[2:00:54] in and what was it it would be another
[2:00:56] tree of life that he would call in to do
[2:00:58] what to bring fruit so that you could
[2:01:00] eat
[2:01:01] you see God's God the patterns of God
[2:01:04] are the same he's trying to express
[2:01:05] himself in everything and out of the
[2:01:08] Garden of Eden goes what a river
[2:01:12] a river
[2:01:14] because without moisture we're nothing
[2:01:17] here's a great spirit of God going out
[2:01:20] here I'm just going to so we recognize
[2:01:23] brother Brown says this he says he
[2:01:24] prophesied that he would give them
[2:01:25] Living Waters and if a man drank he
[2:01:27] would never thirst again but would live
[2:01:29] eternally he showed himself as The Great
[2:01:31] I Am he is the bread of life now listen
[2:01:34] close he is the bread of life The Well
[2:01:37] of life
[2:01:38] the Eternal one the tree of life he was
[2:01:43] back there in the midst of the garden
[2:01:45] and even as he will be in the midst of
[2:01:48] the paradise of God
[2:01:51] now so we think of Paradise in one way
[2:01:53] but God thinks of it in a total
[2:01:54] different way God could
[2:01:57] like that he can create whatever he
[2:01:58] wants I believe I'm looking at the
[2:02:00] paradise of God I'm looking that what
[2:02:03] was what do we look at Eden and we say
[2:02:05] Oh Maya that's pear we all look for a
[2:02:07] paradise like that you know if you're
[2:02:10] like me man for years and years I you
[2:02:12] know I had one thing in my mind and I I
[2:02:14] believe God just gives us the desires of
[2:02:16] our hearts and you know as you see these
[2:02:17] little you go by the travel places and
[2:02:19] you see these little you know grass
[2:02:21] thatched huts and you know they got the
[2:02:23] grass on them and they're by these these
[2:02:25] just turquoise blue uh you know oceans
[2:02:28] and White Sands and it just looks like
[2:02:30] oh if I could just get there I could
[2:02:31] just relax I could just let off all the
[2:02:34] pressure it would just be so good don't
[2:02:36] you think so yeah right no it doesn't
[2:02:38] work like that it doesn't work like that
[2:02:40] because wherever you are you are
[2:02:43] uh you know many years ago I was over in
[2:02:45] New Zealand preaching an Easter meeting
[2:02:46] and at my sister-in-law lived in Fiji at
[2:02:48] the time it just worked that we could go
[2:02:50] there and she not unbeknownst uneven
[2:02:54] nothing said she just texted my wife and
[2:02:56] said hey I Connie we got we got a little
[2:02:59] getaway plan for you and and Dwayne and
[2:03:01] and when you get here this is what we
[2:03:03] want to do and
[2:03:04] I mean it was the very thing that I had
[2:03:06] looked for for all my life I thought oh
[2:03:08] we could just get there
[2:03:10] came off a week of meetings brother
[2:03:12] brother Gerald you know what I'm talking
[2:03:13] about I came off a week of meetings and
[2:03:15] you're so so caught in the spirit so
[2:03:17] wound up I got there and we had the
[2:03:19] place for three days and on the third
[2:03:20] day we were about to leave and my wife
[2:03:22] looks at me she goes oh welcome
[2:03:25] now we leave
[2:03:27] couldn't enjoy it
[2:03:30] I wanted to but I couldn't my spirit was
[2:03:31] in a different place and I was caught
[2:03:33] between these dimensions of trying to
[2:03:34] come back to earth and just enjoy life
[2:03:36] I'd wander around and look at the seed
[2:03:38] there's nothing really
[2:03:41] why because nothing on this world
[2:03:43] satisfies nothing it's all there it's
[2:03:46] all we will enjoy it all one day but in
[2:03:49] this flesh you have to actually be in
[2:03:51] the flesh to enjoy it and I got to be
[2:03:53] there for a while before I can enjoy it
[2:03:55] but but you see there's God is wanting
[2:03:58] rivers of Living Water he's wanting to
[2:04:00] feed us with the Waters of of Living
[2:04:02] Water
[2:04:03] and you know there's you know we look at
[2:04:05] Abraham the Great
[2:04:06] patriarch of the faith and and and and
[2:04:09] you know he had God had given him a a
[2:04:12] promise that you were going to have a
[2:04:13] son and I'm gonna I'm gonna raise up a
[2:04:15] lineage unto you uh you know people that
[2:04:17] that are Faith are our faith-based
[2:04:19] people they got my spirit in them and we
[2:04:21] know you know Abraham and he'd gone so
[2:04:23] many years and Sarah had gotten trouble
[2:04:25] about she'd heard the promise of God
[2:04:27] just I would say like the uh like like
[2:04:29] so often we get you know God's given us
[2:04:32] promise and and time goes on and if
[2:04:34] we're not careful we get to wondering
[2:04:36] God are you going to keep your word God
[2:04:37] are you going to keep your word Lord I I
[2:04:39] thought I heard you right are you really
[2:04:41] going to keep your word and you know
[2:04:42] Abraham it had become a revelation to
[2:04:44] him but it had not become Revelation to
[2:04:47] his wife Sarah even though they had
[2:04:49] lived together and they know they were
[2:04:51] their husband and wife and and but she
[2:04:53] was part of the promise because she was
[2:04:55] part of Abraham oh I hope you get that
[2:04:57] this morning church you are part of the
[2:04:59] promise because you're part of Christ
[2:05:00] you are part of the inheritance because
[2:05:02] you're part of him and here's you know
[2:05:04] here's Abraham and he's got this little
[2:05:06] wife and and Sarah finally gets to the
[2:05:08] place she says listen Abraham I'm
[2:05:10] getting too old I just can't go I don't
[2:05:12] know if God's gonna do this are you sure
[2:05:13] you misunderstood why don't you take my
[2:05:16] hands Maiden Hagar
[2:05:18] and you live with her and bring forth a
[2:05:20] child and and I'm sure that's what
[2:05:22] probably what God had in mind but that's
[2:05:24] not what God had in mind God don't want
[2:05:26] you taking some man-made idea God
[2:05:29] doesn't want you consuming yourself with
[2:05:31] some man-made thought he doesn't want
[2:05:33] you trying to bring his promises to uh
[2:05:36] to pass in your life he wants to bring
[2:05:38] him to pass and when he brings him
[2:05:40] listen you try to bring it to pass and
[2:05:42] you end up in the same boat that Hagar
[2:05:44] ended up in same boat Sarah and she
[2:05:46] wanted Abraham to have a son like God
[2:05:48] wanted Abraham to have a son she wanted
[2:05:51] to have a little boy running around just
[2:05:53] like any other woman wants a little boy
[2:05:54] running around but when she gave haggar
[2:05:57] to Abraham we find out what did it costs
[2:06:00] it caused nothing but trouble matters of
[2:06:03] fact when Hagar conceived and Hager
[2:06:06] started getting all this attention and
[2:06:08] you know I'm sure Abraham he was still
[2:06:10] his son either way listen haggar's son
[2:06:13] Ishmael was still Abraham was still his
[2:06:15] father to this day you go and talk to to
[2:06:18] the those people of those countries and
[2:06:20] they Proclaim Abraham is our father they
[2:06:23] just don't recognize Jesus as the Christ
[2:06:24] but they Proclaim Abraham is the
[2:06:27] muhammadans the Buddhists they operate
[2:06:29] I've known what the Buddhist but I know
[2:06:30] the Bahamas do for sure they believe
[2:06:32] Abraham is their father and he is
[2:06:36] can you go read the scriptures and you
[2:06:38] find out that that here's Sarah
[2:06:41] and also she sees haggar getting all
[2:06:43] this attention and this little boy come
[2:06:45] on church this is a little baby
[2:06:47] Abraham's waited for years to have a son
[2:06:49] and now he has a son just not a
[2:06:53] god-given son
[2:06:55] this one was conceived of a man's idea
[2:06:59] of a woman's idea and here's this little
[2:07:01] boy and this boy and Abraham starts
[2:07:03] paying attention and the Bible says and
[2:07:05] when Sarah looked at Hagar she resented
[2:07:09] her
[2:07:11] all of a sudden there's this conflict
[2:07:14] why
[2:07:16] because Sarah was promised a son
[2:07:20] but because that she had that she had to
[2:07:23] try and make it come to bed God said go
[2:07:25] ahead give her a rehearse desire
[2:07:27] but what did it cause
[2:07:29] conflict
[2:07:31] how about the time you start trying to
[2:07:32] make your own will happen
[2:07:34] by the time you start trying to think
[2:07:36] you know God I I believe you promised
[2:07:38] this and I believe you promised that and
[2:07:39] I just believe I'm just going to go get
[2:07:40] it and make it happen listen you leave
[2:07:42] those things up to God
[2:07:44] you leave your I think brother Jonathan
[2:07:46] I think you said something about your
[2:07:48] your you know your our positions in life
[2:07:50] and and what do you call that your
[2:07:52] occupation whatever you you had a nice
[2:07:54] word for it I don't have that but anyhow
[2:07:56] yeah you know what I'm saying your
[2:07:57] position in life and you know like I'm
[2:08:00] listen Joseph God exalted Joseph
[2:08:03] Joseph didn't have to exalt himself
[2:08:06] he didn't have to work day and night and
[2:08:08] day and night and try and please the
[2:08:10] boss I don't know why I'm on this right
[2:08:11] now but he didn't have to do that
[2:08:14] he found favor in the eyes of he was
[2:08:16] just Joseph he just did what he was
[2:08:17] doing and God blessed him because of it
[2:08:20] he found favor
[2:08:22] so when we go to try and making God's
[2:08:24] promises come to pass you're going to
[2:08:26] come you're going to find out you're
[2:08:27] going to find yourself in a terrible
[2:08:29] predicament one day
[2:08:31] you're going to stretch out and while
[2:08:32] brother Dwayne I live by faith so I'm
[2:08:34] going to buy the best and I'm going to
[2:08:35] have the best and I'm going to own the
[2:08:36] best and God's promise to take care of
[2:08:38] me no he didn't he said he'd provide
[2:08:40] your needs and you might find yourself
[2:08:41] like I talked about brother Corey the
[2:08:43] other you might find yourself in a box
[2:08:45] on the street someday
[2:08:46] When God says that's not my plan for
[2:08:48] your life
[2:08:50] it's best to say father thy will be done
[2:08:53] I thy kingdom come here I'm way off my
[2:08:55] notes again
[2:08:56] let's go back so we see you know we got
[2:08:59] haggers there anyhow and she's she's got
[2:09:02] this little baby and Sarah sends her out
[2:09:03] into the desert
[2:09:05] she says just get rid of her go on and
[2:09:07] Abraham says do what you want she's your
[2:09:08] hands made you know go on and we find
[2:09:11] out that that hagger gets out in the
[2:09:13] desert and here she is dying of thirst
[2:09:16] but here's the part that's blessed she's
[2:09:18] dying of thirst and somehow her eyes are
[2:09:21] open to a well of water
[2:09:23] that's out there in the wilderness
[2:09:26] and it's an angel that comes and talks
[2:09:28] to her says no hagger you're not going
[2:09:30] to die and the child's not going to die
[2:09:32] how can the child die it's Abraham's
[2:09:34] seed
[2:09:35] come on Church how can even though it
[2:09:37] was conceived in all the wrong ways it
[2:09:39] was still Abraham's seed it cannot die
[2:09:42] God has a promise God's going to raise
[2:09:45] up that seed just the same
[2:09:47] and here's little haggar and she she
[2:09:49] gets this you know you know the word
[2:09:52] from the angel that she's not going to
[2:09:53] die just go home it's going to be okay
[2:09:55] but what did God lead her to
[2:09:58] a fountain of water
[2:10:03] a fountain of water she was absolutely
[2:10:05] desolate dying she thought life was over
[2:10:08] there was no hope for me but God opened
[2:10:11] her eyes to a what Fountain of water
[2:10:16] matter of the fact she'd go ahead and
[2:10:17] call it I'm not even going to try Bell
[2:10:19] hello Lori or something like that some
[2:10:21] of you some of you brothers be able to
[2:10:23] pronounce that but I I don't but I know
[2:10:25] what it means
[2:10:26] it means The God Who lives sees me
[2:10:30] I might not be able to pronounce the
[2:10:32] name but the God who lives
[2:10:33] listen that was 4 000 or maybe six
[2:10:36] thousand five thousand years ago but the
[2:10:38] God who lives sees me this morning that
[2:10:41] same God sees you this morning where
[2:10:43] you're at he knows if you're empty he
[2:10:45] knows if you're dry and he knows
[2:10:47] how to show you where The Well of of
[2:10:49] water is The Well of life is how about
[2:10:52] Moses when they're out in the you know
[2:10:53] leading the children when they're out in
[2:10:55] the wilderness there the children got to
[2:10:57] complaining all of a sudden they found
[2:10:59] themselves you know without water and
[2:11:00] and you know they're coming down pretty
[2:11:02] hard on the pastor right now because
[2:11:04] because they were just feeling empty and
[2:11:05] we just don't feel like we've got hey
[2:11:07] you know we're just we're just hungry
[2:11:08] and we just don't feel like we're being
[2:11:09] fed anymore and Moses and Aaron go to
[2:11:12] before God and they begin to cry out and
[2:11:14] God says go and go and speak to the Rock
[2:11:17] and it'll bring forth his Waters
[2:11:20] why didn't he say it's Waters
[2:11:22] why didn't he say Moses just go go speak
[2:11:24] to the Rock it'll bring forth its Waters
[2:11:26] a rock isn't it it's just a uh you know
[2:11:29] a hard what do you call it I don't know
[2:11:32] just a hard
[2:11:33] piece of dirt I guess I don't know what
[2:11:35] they're even made out of stone
[2:11:39] I see how God does
[2:11:41] most ridiculous things go speak to the
[2:11:43] Rock
[2:11:45] why
[2:11:47] because the rock was not just a rock go
[2:11:50] read the chapter go read Corinthians
[2:11:51] what would Paul say he says The Rock was
[2:11:54] Christ
[2:11:56] go speak to the Rock and we know the
[2:11:59] story you know Abraham or Abraham Moses
[2:12:01] would go and because of the pressure of
[2:12:03] the people and he you know he already
[2:12:05] had a little issue with his temper and
[2:12:07] because of the pressure of people he'd
[2:12:09] take the same the Judgment Rod of
[2:12:11] God that led the children out of is out
[2:12:13] of Egypt and he'd take the same rod in
[2:12:15] his anger and he would instead of
[2:12:17] speaking to the Rock he would Smite The
[2:12:19] Rock
[2:12:20] but this is just the same The Rock still
[2:12:23] gave out its water
[2:12:25] you know brother Brown would bring this
[2:12:27] to reality to us just like the paintings
[2:12:28] that we see you know there's the Rock
[2:12:30] and Moses and the little stream
[2:12:31] trickling up we know we know that wasn't
[2:12:33] what it was
[2:12:35] it was there was two million people just
[2:12:38] besides all the animals and everything
[2:12:40] else
[2:12:41] we did that last night we just we
[2:12:43] touched on this little thing fill my cup
[2:12:44] Lord I asked that little sister right
[2:12:46] here how big was your cup
[2:12:48] this big and this morning I asked her
[2:12:50] and she said it was a barrel I brought a
[2:12:52] barrel
[2:12:53] bless her heart
[2:12:55] but listen The Rock was Christ it wasn't
[2:12:58] just a stone out in the wilderness
[2:12:59] matters in fact if you go and read the
[2:13:01] scriptures the Bible say the rock
[2:13:03] followed them
[2:13:04] through the wilderness
[2:13:06] I'll never leave you and I won't forsake
[2:13:09] you the rock followed them through the
[2:13:11] wilderness
[2:13:12] why
[2:13:14] because it was Living Waters
[2:13:17] I will sit on the throne the lamb that
[2:13:20] sits on the throne will lead you to
[2:13:22] Living Waters
[2:13:24] Fountains of Living Waters you know a
[2:13:26] prophet of God would come out in this
[2:13:27] generation he would look he would look
[2:13:29] at at the ministry of the of the age
[2:13:31] that we're living in and he'd come right
[2:13:33] down to the Pentecostal pastors and the
[2:13:35] Baptist pastors and you know the
[2:13:37] Methodist preachers and he would pull
[2:13:39] out a a little thought out of Jeremiah
[2:13:41] he says and you've hewed yourself
[2:13:43] cisterns
[2:13:45] you forsaken me the Living Word of God
[2:13:48] you forsaken me
[2:13:50] you forsaken me and you've hewed to
[2:13:52] yourself cisterns
[2:13:55] when I could have given you Living
[2:13:56] Waters and now because you polluted the
[2:13:59] water now you're going to die
[2:14:01] listen church we can say oh brother
[2:14:03] Dwayne you know that that that that was
[2:14:05] that was brother Branham speaking to the
[2:14:06] you know to the Pentecostal people and
[2:14:08] he was right at the LA at the last part
[2:14:10] of Lady of CN and he was rebuking them
[2:14:12] but I'll tell you what the same spirit
[2:14:15] of God could come down to you we don't
[2:14:16] we don't maybe have denominations around
[2:14:18] the message but you can become it'll
[2:14:21] never the message will never denominate
[2:14:22] but you can become denominational
[2:14:24] you can stop in your walk if the day you
[2:14:27] stop walking with the Lord remember this
[2:14:30] Our God the son is like the s-u-n it
[2:14:34] never stops IT continually comes up and
[2:14:36] it goes down it keeps moving and the
[2:14:39] moment you stop and say you know what I
[2:14:42] got it I understand it this is what I've
[2:14:44] got I know this is truth and I praise
[2:14:46] God I've just got it the moment you stop
[2:14:49] in your walk with the Lord I don't care
[2:14:51] if you're here for 15 years or if you've
[2:14:53] been here for brother Gerald forgive me
[2:14:55] for this but if you've been here for 42
[2:14:57] years or 43 years it doesn't matter if
[2:15:00] we ever stop
[2:15:01] listen the spirit of God never stops
[2:15:03] moving it's always taking us higher
[2:15:05] always taking us higher and if we ever
[2:15:07] get hunkered down and stop what happens
[2:15:10] we now get a true now we become
[2:15:13] traditional and we start cueing out
[2:15:16] man-made tradition this is how you know
[2:15:19] I I so are you going to different
[2:15:21] churches and if we're not careful we
[2:15:22] could we become traditional too don't
[2:15:25] just look out at the Baptist and the
[2:15:26] Pentecost if we're not careful we become
[2:15:28] traditional we want to put God in a
[2:15:30] little box and say you know what Lord
[2:15:32] I'll let you move if you do it this way
[2:15:35] because that's what I've been raised and
[2:15:37] that's how I'm comfortable and God's
[2:15:38] going to say you know what that's fine
[2:15:40] but I'm not staying there if you want to
[2:15:42] come follow me follow me God is not
[2:15:46] interested in our little boxes church I
[2:15:48] preach this at home all the time we can
[2:15:49] become traditional
[2:15:51] and God bless you brother Gerald I want
[2:15:53] to take my spiritual hat off to you
[2:15:55] today brother Jonathan told me don't
[2:15:57] even think about the time brother Gerald
[2:15:59] has taught us better than that
[2:16:01] but I'll tell you what I've been in
[2:16:03] churches and I know this to be true I
[2:16:05] have been in churches ministering before
[2:16:07] them and at 10 minutes to 12. all of a
[2:16:10] sudden people start fidgeting they just
[2:16:11] get they just start fidgeting and you're
[2:16:13] thinking what's wrong like what's
[2:16:15] happening
[2:16:17] because their Pastor has closed at 12
[2:16:19] o'clock on the dot for the last 20 years
[2:16:22] it programmed the people you know what
[2:16:24] you just did
[2:16:25] you created a tradition in your church
[2:16:28] you absolutely bucks got up and said at
[2:16:31] 12 o'clock Lord we are done here and
[2:16:33] we're going home this whether you've
[2:16:34] moved or not we're going home by then
[2:16:37] God forbid I don't believe for a minute
[2:16:40] God said I will lead you to rivers of
[2:16:43] live Fountains of Living Water and it
[2:16:46] might the fountain that might the gusher
[2:16:47] might not come forth to 12 15 12 35
[2:16:51] quarter to one you don't know
[2:16:54] listen you and I we're we're sorry God
[2:16:57] forgive me for using this I think this
[2:16:58] is a mourner's mention we're not
[2:17:00] mourning this morning we're rejoicing
[2:17:02] but listen you go home and you you'll
[2:17:04] sit down in front of your little uh you
[2:17:06] know your little handheld tablet or your
[2:17:08] computer or whatever you got and you'll
[2:17:10] get onto YouTube and you'll start
[2:17:12] looking at something and you'll be
[2:17:14] scrolling and what up three hours later
[2:17:16] you'll look at the time and think where
[2:17:18] did the time go
[2:17:21] and then you'll pick up a message book
[2:17:23] and you'll read it for about 10 minutes
[2:17:25] and also you'll be drifting off
[2:17:27] you'll think oh Lord
[2:17:29] come on
[2:17:31] what kind of battles are we fighting
[2:17:32] this morning church
[2:17:34] what kind of battles are we fighting
[2:17:35] this morning we are contending earnestly
[2:17:37] for the faith of God
[2:17:39] Satan knows how to Captivate you it used
[2:17:42] to be a television
[2:17:44] and brother Brian would rebuke us and
[2:17:46] say shame on you you Pentecostal people
[2:17:48] you wouldn't go out to the movies and
[2:17:49] now he says you brought a television
[2:17:51] into your home but watch how slick he
[2:17:53] said Satan pulled one over on you and he
[2:17:56] said and he bought and he put one in
[2:17:57] your house and I believe we're children
[2:17:59] of God and we'd be careful what we
[2:18:00] watched anyhow about watch how shrewd he
[2:18:03] is in this last day he won't only put
[2:18:06] one in your house but now brother he'll
[2:18:08] put it right in your pocket and it's not
[2:18:10] just a television it is whatever you
[2:18:14] desire it is called YouTube because it's
[2:18:18] all about you
[2:18:19] if you like cars you can watch it there
[2:18:21] if you like building you can watch it
[2:18:23] there if you've got a problem with your
[2:18:24] truck brother and you don't know how to
[2:18:26] fix it you're going to go to YouTube and
[2:18:28] you're going to figure out how to fix
[2:18:29] your truck because it's there what is it
[2:18:31] it's all the wisdom it's all the
[2:18:32] knowledge it's all the understanding and
[2:18:35] not hardly any of it praise God brother
[2:18:37] Gerald my hat comes off to you again
[2:18:38] first website I just got just he was
[2:18:41] just telling me about that listen there
[2:18:43] was hardly for years there was nothing
[2:18:44] about God and now we're finally starting
[2:18:47] to see
[2:18:48] the spirit of the Living God can take
[2:18:50] Satan's Eden and use it for his own
[2:18:52] Glory
[2:18:53] but let me tell you something you can be
[2:18:55] as distracted as anything
[2:18:58] we waste more of our time
[2:19:01] in front of Satan's devices
[2:19:04] oh I'll tell you what would we be
[2:19:07] you know what
[2:19:12] brother Jonathan you said something
[2:19:16] we were talking about something you said
[2:19:17] you have to schedule it
[2:19:18] you know because some of us are just
[2:19:20] natured that way you got to schedule it
[2:19:25] I would just make a suggestion I'm so
[2:19:27] far off my notes right now
[2:19:30] I'll just make a suggestion to you this
[2:19:31] morning
[2:19:33] if you can't control you
[2:19:36] I suggest that you schedule in your time
[2:19:38] with the Lord
[2:19:40] and make it a priority in your life
[2:19:43] if you can't control you
[2:19:46] if you don't know how to just shut it
[2:19:47] off and walk away from it
[2:19:51] you know for years I would take and put
[2:19:53] my phone in a different room when I
[2:19:55] slept
[2:19:56] I would just shut it off as a pastor I
[2:19:58] can't shut it off but it's still in the
[2:19:59] other room
[2:20:01] I don't care about the beep I don't care
[2:20:03] about the buzz I don't care about the
[2:20:05] twinkle or whatever the little whatever
[2:20:06] little icon thing comes your way every
[2:20:08] time you get a message I don't care
[2:20:10] about any of that
[2:20:13] and I would just encourage you
[2:20:15] how many of you
[2:20:18] first thing in the morning
[2:20:20] you wake up and the first thing you
[2:20:22] reach for
[2:20:26] just check the time right
[2:20:28] in case you can sleep for 10 more
[2:20:29] minutes
[2:20:31] but I got all these messages
[2:20:34] Well that took me about 10 minutes and
[2:20:36] then huh I wonder what the news is
[2:20:38] that took me 30 minutes and
[2:20:41] got to fix my truck
[2:20:45] and now I gotta go to work and I haven't
[2:20:47] spent one minute with the Lord
[2:20:50] deception deception
[2:20:55] Lord help me
[2:20:59] let me just jump down I'm just going to
[2:21:01] skip a whole bunch of this this morning
[2:21:02] for time today
[2:21:04] I kept you so long this weekend I'm
[2:21:05] ashamed of myself
[2:21:07] all right you know we go back to the
[2:21:09] scripture and Jesus would our Peter
[2:21:12] would say to them and Paul would say to
[2:21:13] the Corinthians he'd say listen speaking
[2:21:16] about that rock he would say that rock
[2:21:17] was Christ
[2:21:20] that rock was Christ
[2:21:22] you know and isn't it true I mean when
[2:21:24] they smote it he didn't just give him a
[2:21:26] little bit
[2:21:27] Christ isn't here just to give you a
[2:21:29] little trickle the River of Life is
[2:21:31] flowing
[2:21:33] the River of Life is Flowing he came to
[2:21:35] bring you a stream not just a stream but
[2:21:37] a river he came to absolutely supply all
[2:21:40] your needs to quench the very thirst of
[2:21:43] God in your life he came to do that for
[2:21:45] you and you know you remember out in the
[2:21:47] wilderness when they were you know I
[2:21:48] think it was back in the days of uh not
[2:21:50] ahab's son jaharam or something like
[2:21:52] that do you remember when him and
[2:21:53] Jehoshaphat made a you know there's a
[2:21:55] great Warfare going on and johoram said
[2:21:57] Joshua I need you to come and stand by
[2:22:00] and stand by my side I I need somebody
[2:22:02] to fight with me and and Jehoshaphat
[2:22:04] said yeah sure I'll go I think there was
[2:22:05] like five Kings or I might be mixed up a
[2:22:07] little bit no there wasn't that was in a
[2:22:09] different time but you know they were
[2:22:10] going they went out into the Wilderness
[2:22:12] in the Bible say this that you know they
[2:22:13] went out seven days journey and then
[2:22:15] they found out hey
[2:22:16] we ran out of water
[2:22:18] we got nothing to feed our animals and
[2:22:20] we haven't even started this battle yet
[2:22:22] we've got nothing to sustain us and we
[2:22:23] we haven't even started our battle and
[2:22:25] now and now what do we do and
[2:22:28] Jehoshaphat as a godly man would look at
[2:22:30] jeharram and say hey isn't there a
[2:22:31] Prophet or something in this land isn't
[2:22:34] there somebody a God-fearing man some
[2:22:35] words that we could go talk to we got a
[2:22:38] Warfare coming on here and we haven't
[2:22:39] gone very far isn't there a God-fearing
[2:22:41] man oh yeah of course you know Elisha is
[2:22:44] there and we can we go talk to him and
[2:22:45] here comes isn't it funny how
[2:22:49] how Cycles repeat
[2:22:51] because wasn't it Ahab that had the same
[2:22:53] problem with Elijah and Elijah would
[2:22:56] look at him and say if it wasn't for
[2:22:57] Elisha I wouldn't even if it wasn't for
[2:22:59] Joshua I wouldn't even look at you
[2:23:01] and now here we have johoram's son
[2:23:03] ahab's son in the same predicament
[2:23:06] and Elijah should say hey if it wasn't
[2:23:09] for Elisha if it wasn't for uh
[2:23:11] Jehoshaphat this godly man I wouldn't
[2:23:12] even consider what you're talking about
[2:23:14] right now
[2:23:16] you know it actually frustrated actually
[2:23:17] made it made I'd say this it made Elisha
[2:23:21] spiritually angry
[2:23:22] that these two men would would somehow
[2:23:24] get together
[2:23:27] but God will not forsake his own
[2:23:29] even in your mistakes God will not
[2:23:31] forsake you
[2:23:33] here's Jehoshaphat absolutely married up
[2:23:35] in the wrong crowd and and now they go
[2:23:38] to the word of God the living word for
[2:23:40] that day and and Elisha would say listen
[2:23:42] listen I I ca there's no way I can I'm
[2:23:45] so angry about what you've done right
[2:23:47] now my spirit is so upset come on Daddy
[2:23:50] Come on Mommy come on preacher
[2:23:53] brother Jonathan let me talk to you for
[2:23:55] a minute there comes times that you're

[2:24:00] what's happened at home and how the
[2:24:01] enemy just hey I I my wife married a
[2:24:04] preacher she knows what I'm talking

[2:25:52] also in the spirit of God

[2:26:19] it ain't nothing about the way you think
[2:26:20] it's going to be
[2:26:22] but if you'll be obedient
[2:26:24] he will fulfill his word

[2:26:42] the thing that we're going to do is
[2:26:43] we're going to go out into the desert

[2:26:46] ditches because there's water there
[2:26:47] somewheres

[2:26:57] walk sometimes with these sticks in
[2:26:58] their hands or these little wires in
[2:27:00] their hands and as they're walking along
[2:27:01] they call it witching as they're walking
[2:27:03] along if they hit a water vein
[2:27:05] underneath those wires will go like this
[2:27:07] and you'll know right there is where you
[2:27:10] drill your well
[2:27:11] it's a for real thing
[2:27:15] I tell you what kimi's can you see those
[2:27:17] men well let's get some branches and
[2:27:19] let's go figure out where where's the
[2:27:21] water in this desert I tell you what I
[2:27:23] want you troops going that way I want
[2:27:24] that troop going that way we got to
[2:27:26] figure out where the no no that's not
[2:27:27] what Elisha said at all don't try and
[2:27:29] figure it out
[2:27:30] just get in the desert and start digging
[2:27:32] dishes just get where just get in your
[2:27:35] Battle Zone and start digging out the
[2:27:37] trash
[2:27:38] and Brethren would say this he says they
[2:27:40] got to you know he says they they didn't
[2:27:41] know what they're going to do I I can
[2:27:43] hear the humanity I could I can just
[2:27:45] hear how we would be brother Mark we'd
[2:27:46] start digging and the sun's beating down
[2:27:48] on us and we think is our Superior is he
[2:27:50] crazy is he is who is this crazy man
[2:27:53] that gave this kind of a direction dig
[2:27:55] ditches they just dig in the desert what
[2:27:58] are we supposed to do dig in the desert
[2:27:59] and I can see you know you know I can
[2:28:01] see Jehoshaphat standing there and
[2:28:03] making sure he's telling the captains of
[2:28:04] the host saying Hey listen listen I
[2:28:06] don't want you digging little ditches I
[2:28:08] want those ditches wide I want those
[2:28:10] ditches deep I can hear men complain
[2:28:12] listen any time that that God wants to
[2:28:14] do something in your life Satan is going
[2:28:16] to be there to buff at you and you're
[2:28:18] not going to want to dig the ditch out
[2:28:20] but let me say this in the name of the
[2:28:22] Lord this morning dig the ditches of
[2:28:24] your life out watch brother Brown said
[2:28:27] as they begin to dig you know the word
[2:28:28] of God sometimes it gets sharp and and
[2:28:31] it gets it gets to a place in our lives
[2:28:33] where we don't like it it comes down so
[2:28:34] close and you don't run around and make
[2:28:37] a statement like this he said you know
[2:28:38] maybe your pastor gets a preaching on
[2:28:40] he'll get to preaching on tithing and
[2:28:42] offering and you you know you don't pay
[2:28:43] your time so it's like I don't like that
[2:28:45] I didn't enjoy that service I don't
[2:28:47] really want to hear that because because
[2:28:48] it convicts me we don't want to hear
[2:28:50] about that come on that's just as much
[2:28:52] part of the word of God as any other
[2:28:54] part of the word of God not just the
[2:28:55] fact that you're Son of God and that
[2:28:57] you've got power and you've got
[2:28:58] authority over the devil and and you can
[2:29:00] you can oh you could you can climb all
[2:29:02] the mountains and you can take your
[2:29:03] Mountain we love to hear those things
[2:29:05] but when it comes to our daily life
[2:29:08] and a pastor come and the spirit of God
[2:29:10] moves him he begins to talk about
[2:29:11] tithing and offering and and the
[2:29:14] importance of it and and how vital it is
[2:29:16] to you and you you know you know I've
[2:29:17] heard people say this further Dwayne I I
[2:29:20] heard a pastor tell me this one time and
[2:29:22] it just floored me I both fell out of my
[2:29:24] chair he said brother Dwayne he said my
[2:29:26] people are so poor he says I can't
[2:29:27] expect them to pay tithes and offerings
[2:29:29] I looked at him I said brother the
[2:29:30] reason they're poor is because they
[2:29:32] don't pay tithes and offerings I said
[2:29:34] the word says that if you would give God
[2:29:36] his portion I don't know how I got here
[2:29:37] this morning but if you would give God
[2:29:39] his portion he would open up the windows
[2:29:42] of heaven and pour out a blessing on you
[2:29:44] that you can't even contain
[2:29:47] yeah but brother Dwayne you don't
[2:29:49] understand no I do understand
[2:29:52] listen I know what it's like to have
[2:29:54] that little woman right there try and
[2:29:56] raise a family try and buy groceries for
[2:29:59] two hundred dollars a month for four
[2:30:01] kids

[2:30:17] what am I gonna what am I going to serve
[2:30:19] them

[2:31:15] I'm going to be faithful
[2:31:18] you know one day the Lord spoke to me
[2:31:20] about that because we all struggle with
[2:31:21] this
[2:31:23] because of the pressures of life that we
[2:31:25] live under
[2:31:27] as soon as we get down we see the bills
[2:31:28] getting too much we're like Lord

[2:31:45] I want you to have it
[2:31:49] but I want to be your provider
[2:31:51] remember the testimony I gave you last
[2:31:53] night about that needing my land payment
[2:31:57] God does that all the time
[2:32:01] if you serve him
[2:32:04] and if you give him Brothers I don't
[2:32:06] know what is going on Jonathan
[2:32:08] you can just ship me out and never have
[2:32:10] to call me back again but listen
[2:32:13] I'm just going to just preach because
[2:32:14] it's all my heart
[2:32:20] God requires the first fruit
[2:32:23] God requires the first fruit
[2:32:25] I remember when I caught this revelation
[2:32:28] you know the money you make
[2:32:31] God gave you ten percent more than you
[2:32:33] deserve to have period
[2:32:36] foreign I hardly have enough to pay my
[2:32:39] bills he gave you it's not your money to
[2:32:41] begin with
[2:32:42] he gave you the health he gave you the
[2:32:43] strength he gave you the position he
[2:32:46] opened the door he he actually put
[2:32:48] something on your employer's heart to
[2:32:49] pay you
[2:32:50] yeah but brother Dwayne my bills are so
[2:32:52] high and I listen he gave you ten
[2:32:54] percent more you know what God wanted to
[2:32:55] do about it
[2:32:57] you know what he want to do about it
[2:32:59] he wanted to see if I was willing to
[2:33:01] give it back
[2:33:04] so he lets the bills come in
[2:33:09] and I'm looking at it and my heart is a
[2:33:12] daddy because I am the provider

[2:42:54] have you gone to pick up your truck have
[2:42:56] you gone to pick up your truck have you
[2:42:58] gone to pick up your truck
[2:43:02] what I'm saying is if you'll be faithful
[2:43:06] he promised to take care of our needs
[2:43:10] you say well brother Dwayne that wasn't
[2:43:12] neat I didn't need a truck like that but
[2:43:13] he knew the desire of my heart too
[2:43:16] I I I I'm okay to drive little old
[2:43:19] things I'm happy just driving I'm okay
[2:43:21] either way
[2:43:23] but he even wants to give you the desire
[2:43:25] of your heart
[2:43:28] I don't know why I'm on this but I'm
[2:43:29] going to close on this because I just
[2:43:30] think I should right now I'm so far free
[2:43:32] forgive me I'm so far away from my notes
[2:43:34] but I'm just going to commit it all to
[2:43:35] God and
[2:43:36] listen I I believe that the same spirit
[2:43:39] of God
[2:43:40] that's here this morning the same spirit
[2:43:42] of God that gave you life the same
[2:43:43] spirit of God that brought you here if
[2:43:45] he is not almighty God
[2:43:48] if he was if he's
[2:43:50] if the god that created the Earth
[2:43:53] and created every portion of this world
[2:43:55] and has for six thousand years kept
[2:43:58] everything in order
[2:44:01] it's not a great enough God to take care
[2:44:03] of your finances
[2:44:05] then why are you serving him
[2:44:10] he is
[2:44:12] he is
[2:44:13] of course you know I'm speaking like a
[2:44:15] pastor right now right I'm not supposed
[2:44:17] to be doing that but I am
[2:44:22] he cares
[2:44:23] he cares
[2:44:25] and all he wants you to just by faith
[2:44:30] I'm on the train anyhow so I'm just
[2:44:32] going to talk
[2:44:35] we've got a brother back home at church
[2:44:37] and for years I didn't know him he he
[2:44:40] used to Fellowship somewhere else I've
[2:44:42] known him all my life but I didn't know
[2:44:44] the kind of man he was and he used to
[2:44:46] Fellowship somewhere else he's a
[2:44:47] businessman
[2:44:50] and his pastor at the time had a men's
[2:44:51] meeting
[2:44:52] I don't maybe I'm stepping on toes this
[2:44:54] morning but Lord you know where we're at
[2:44:57] pastor had a men's meeting
[2:45:00] and he got talking about
[2:45:01] the importance of tithing and offerings
[2:45:04] he walked right up into the face of this
[2:45:06] man
[2:45:07] he said brother
[2:45:09] I bet you're the kind of man
[2:45:11] that never drops a dollar in the
[2:45:13] offering basket as it goes by
[2:45:16] his Pastor said that to him
[2:45:18] and I know this man so he would have
[2:45:19] been offended by that
[2:45:22] but this is his testimony not mine
[2:45:27] he said he was right brother Dwayne
[2:45:30] he said I have this opinion
[2:45:33] the church has lots they don't need mine
[2:45:40] you know his Pastor told him
[2:45:42] never moved he said I rather let me give
[2:45:44] you a little challenge
[2:45:46] he said no next time the basket gets you
[2:45:49] next time the basket goes around why
[2:45:51] don't you drop something in there
[2:45:52] he said before the end of the week
[2:45:54] God will probably restore to you ten
[2:45:56] times
[2:46:00] of course you have to know this brother
[2:46:02] he's a good German
[2:46:06] the basket came around
[2:46:09] kept his hands in his pockets
[2:46:12] next Sunday the basket goes around again
[2:46:15] kept his hands in his pockets
[2:46:17] about the third Sunday
[2:46:19] this little thought about it he's a
[2:46:20] businessman 10 times
[2:46:23] 10 times
[2:46:25] 10 times
[2:46:27] reaches in his pocket
[2:46:29] pulls out a hundred dollar bill and
[2:46:31] drops it in the basket we'll see
[2:46:35] I'm telling his testimony
[2:46:39] he looked me in the face and said
[2:46:40] brother Dwayne
[2:46:42] he said all week
[2:46:44] crazy busy
[2:46:46] I get to the end of my week
[2:46:48] it is Friday at four o'clock and I get a
[2:46:51] phone call
[2:46:54] and it's a woman saying hey
[2:46:57] I got a problem in my laundry room I
[2:46:59] need some cabinets hung and if you could
[2:47:00] just come and hang them it'll only take
[2:47:02] it would only take you probably an hour
[2:47:03] and a half to do it
[2:47:05] he's like sure
[2:47:07] he knows the woman knows the family they
[2:47:10] weren't Believers but he knew him he
[2:47:12] went and did the job for him
[2:47:13] husband
[2:47:15] walks out
[2:47:18] his hand in his pocket
[2:47:22] thank you sir
[2:47:24] the brother says you're welcome puts it
[2:47:25] in his pocket walks out to his car and
[2:47:27] he starts Counting
[2:47:30] one two three four five six seven eight
[2:47:35] nine
[2:47:42] thousand dollars
[2:47:44] for a job that took me an hour and a
[2:47:46] half
[2:47:51] Sunday comes around
[2:47:53] puts his hand in his pocket
[2:47:55] I'm not I'm not preaching a Prosperity
[2:47:57] Gospel I'm talking about a God that
[2:47:58] cares
[2:48:00] listen when Hagar was at the well what
[2:48:03] was what was the well called a God that
[2:48:05] sees the Living God and he sees me he
[2:48:09] knows where you're at he knows what you
[2:48:11] have need of and this brother just
[2:48:12] happened to need a revelation of that
[2:48:14] and God was giving him one
[2:48:16] he goes and he throws it back in the
[2:48:18] bucket again another hundred dollars he
[2:48:20] said brother Dwayne before the end of
[2:48:21] the week
[2:48:22] he said the same thing happened
[2:48:25] he said I did it again the same thing
[2:48:27] happened he said I looked at my wife I
[2:48:29] said honey how much money do we need to
[2:48:31] live
[2:48:32] she said she rattled off the number he
[2:48:33] says he says at the beginning every
[2:48:35] month you write the check whether the
[2:48:37] money's there or not this is what we're
[2:48:38] going to pay for our tithing this is
[2:48:40] much we're paying for offering write the
[2:48:41] check he says brother Dwayne I've never
[2:48:43] thought about it since
[2:48:44] and God has blessed him and blessed him
[2:48:46] and blessed him and blessed him it was
[2:48:48] God giving him a revelation
[2:48:50] the very things that he'd thought about
[2:48:52] and wondered about and fought with and
[2:48:54] we all do this we've all got to grow
[2:48:56] through these things so that God can
[2:48:57] prove that I am I am Jehovah Jireh I am
[2:49:01] your provider I am your healer I am the
[2:49:04] one that's I am here to care for you I

[2:49:16] of Living Waters and if you need
[2:49:19] something drink and I'll fulfill your
[2:49:21] desire

[2:50:26] now what
[2:50:30] Jonathan kind of kind of reminds me of
[2:50:32] your sister
[2:50:34] she was sitting back there in the
[2:50:36] audience

[2:50:40] anyhow
[2:50:42] doctors give her a death certificate
[2:50:43] fourth stage you got there's no hope

[2:50:52] music begins to play
[2:50:54] song leader comes up
[2:50:57] he begins to lead the people to a place
[2:50:58] of worship
[2:51:00] and while the presence of God is there
[2:51:03] now this is not at home she was at a
[2:51:05] different church at the time
[2:51:06] while the presence of God is there
[2:51:09] the holy spirit says to her
[2:51:12] stand up
[2:51:14] worship me
[2:51:18] now she's a big lady
[2:51:20] so what would she think
[2:51:22] like I saw she becomes self-conscious
[2:51:26] everybody's going to see me Lord
[2:51:28] I don't want to make a spectacle
[2:51:31] a few minutes later the Holy Spirit come
[2:51:33] back and said
[2:51:34] stand up and worship me
[2:51:37] should big tumors
[2:51:39] hang him off the side she could feel him
[2:51:42] with her arms
[2:51:45] she sat there a little bit and the Holy
[2:51:47] Spirit said stand up
[2:51:50] she got up out of her seat and put both
[2:51:52] hands in the air just began to cry out
[2:51:54] to God just begin to worship Him
[2:51:57] she said brother Dwayne I felt something
[2:51:59] go from my head to my foot
[2:52:04] and in that moment
[2:52:07] I knew God healed me
[2:52:09] I knew God healed me
[2:52:11] should I sat down beside my husband
[2:52:14] and I put my arms down and the pain that
[2:52:17] would have been there
[2:52:18] was gone the tumors that were there were
[2:52:22] gone
[2:52:23] he said I looked at my husband I said
[2:52:31] they're gone
[2:52:32] God healed me
[2:52:34] obedience
[2:52:36] is better than sacrifice
[2:52:39] she got to a place in her life where
[2:52:41] finances got real real real tight
[2:52:44] touch you had four children and she's
[2:52:46] trying to raise him
[2:52:50] he said God I don't know how we're going
[2:52:51] to do this
[2:52:55] she got to thinking about you know if
[2:52:58] you give me my portion I'll open up the
[2:52:59] windows of heaven and I'll pour it a
[2:53:01] blessing you can't contain
[2:53:03] she looked at her bills and she began to
[2:53:05] tally him up
[2:53:08] she said Lord I'm making this right now
[2:53:11] but I need to make this to pay my bills
[2:53:15] so Lord I'm gonna pay you
[2:53:18] my tithing
[2:53:19] on what I need

[2:54:47] children that are Wayward I'm standing
[2:54:50] daily
[2:54:51] you know what I've got
[2:54:53] I got the flag in the ground
[2:54:56] the great Banner of Heaven waving
[2:55:01] you know what's going to happen
[2:55:04] remember you remember around and said
[2:55:05] about that woman
[2:55:07] those two people he prayed for those two
[2:55:09] sisters and two women that he prayed for
[2:55:10] in that little Community one had a big
[2:55:12] goiter on her neck
[2:55:14] remember that the other one had an
[2:55:15] ulcerated stomach
[2:55:18] said there they were he said they come
[2:55:20] through the prayer line and God
[2:55:21] pronounced each one of them healed
[2:55:23] he says and they both walk back to their
[2:55:26] homes
[2:55:27] for the next three weeks or even more
[2:55:29] maybe it was even six weeks
[2:55:31] nothing happened
[2:55:34] that doesn't mean that he's not here
[2:55:35] that doesn't mean that he didn't hear
[2:55:37] nothing happened
[2:55:41] and then one day
[2:55:44] I said oh God
[2:55:48] the angel of the Lord
[2:55:52] because it was thus saith the Lord
[2:55:55] you're healed
[2:55:58] God would have to send an angel a
[2:56:01] Healing Ministry he would have to send
[2:56:04] it to their neighborhood
[2:56:06] to fulfill that word
[2:56:11] son there she is standing doing her
[2:56:13] dishes crying because I haven't been
[2:56:15] able to eat a good breakfast for years

[2:56:20] know what I'm gonna do
[2:56:22] thank you Lord for healing me Lord I
[2:56:24] believe what that man said
[2:56:26] don't you believe the Angel's message
[2:56:28] this morning

[2:56:31] believe God you're going to bring that
[2:56:32] to pass and as she's standing there this
[2:56:35] cool Feeling Just
[2:56:39] she knew
[2:56:42] touched me

[2:56:50] dropped her dishes she ran down the
[2:56:52] street she was so she just wanted to
[2:56:53] tell her friend
[2:56:55] when she got to her friend's house what
[2:56:57] did she find
[2:56:58] the same angel

[2:57:05] anymore brother Bob
