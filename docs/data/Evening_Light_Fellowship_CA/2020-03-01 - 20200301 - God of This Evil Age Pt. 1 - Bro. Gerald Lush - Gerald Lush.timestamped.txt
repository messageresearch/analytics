[46:24] absolutely without the grace of God we

[46:29] world we're not living in Luther's age
[46:32] Wesley or the Pentecostal my brother
[46:34] worked further down the road a man and
[46:37] when we consider the world that the
[46:39] Scriptures tell us that we're going to
[46:41] be living in brothers serious oh it is
[46:44] serious we need grace when the Bible
[46:46] says this is going to be in the last day
[46:48] this and this and this
[46:49] brother we need the grace of God to give
[46:52] us his wisdom and his leadership and
[46:54] we'll get into some of that again this
[46:55] morning as we go into the message on God
[46:57] the God of this evil age a man we're
[47:01] gonna find out who that God is and how
[47:03] we worship meet him are we worshiping
[47:06] Genesis 1:1 or we worshiping the God of
[47:09] these last days so god help us brother
[47:11] because after it is it's gonna be so
[47:13] close to deceive the very elect so god
[47:16] help us
[47:16] so the Lord bless you also to announce

[48:47] you that I think was sweaty that I heard
[48:49] from another brother concerning the scam
[48:51] on my email and so on so the brother was
[48:56] in Frederick 90 Fredersen but rather in
[48:58] British Columbia brother Stuart Cummings
[49:00] and it's been a long time since we've
[49:02] had any communication and if the last
[49:05] time was when brother Harry Green passed
[49:07] away but we've been in fellowship in
[49:10] contact with our brother Stuart for many
[49:13] years and his life is a testimony of the
[49:16] grace of God for sure
[49:18] amen because he went awry he went around
[49:20] Canada around America looking for truth
[49:24] yeah he was he was a worldly man and
[49:27] into worldly things and I can't remember
[49:30] how other believer Chad there he would
[49:33] identify with it for sure because there
[49:36] any what our brother Chad was involved
[49:37] with I could see what I brother Stewart
[49:39] was also involved with a man but
[49:42] something happened to him and God began
[49:44] to deal with him and he went he went all
[49:46] over Canada as it were all over the
[49:48] United States he said brother Esau I was
[49:50] looking for the truth
[49:51] looking for what was right hey man I had
[49:55] to finally when he got back into Canada
[49:57] and he found a message Church always
[49:59] said I found the truth amen so it was
[50:02] the grace of God in his life so we pray
[50:05] god bless our brother Stewart and and
[50:07] his wife in British Columbia and of
[50:11] course brother Don and brothers do it

[50:22] saying only believe all things are
[50:23] possible only believe as we go to the
[50:25] word please be in prayer in your heart
[50:28] for the going foot of the word and let's
[50:30] be in prayer for the rossini of the word
[50:32] because there's some tremendous
[50:34] the prophet of God as I lighted in this
[50:37] in this message on the god of this evil
[50:39] age and Satan see so I pray grace
[50:42] brother that we're going to have the
[50:44] revelation I just at the Garden of Eden
[50:46] and Adam and Eve but we're going to have
[50:48] the revelation of Satan seen a man and
[50:51] that we're not going to be deceived and

[51:05] age he knows the word and he'll quote
[51:08] the word and he'll quote the message and
[51:10] so on but again whether what is his
[51:13] motive what is his objective God is
[51:15] doing it to increase our faith the devil
[51:18] is going to do it in such a way as to
[51:19] decrease our faith so I pray the grace
[51:22] of God whether that we're going to be
[51:24] found
[51:25] serving the god of creation not the god
[51:28] of this evil age a male so grace to us

[59:42] Genesis chapter 1 well I'm gonna say try
[59:56] not to be too long with it
[59:57] that'd be difficult for me a man so you
[1:00:00] be in prayer but again considering the
[1:00:03] the forecast news well I said before the
[1:00:07] Lord willing God what the weather will
[1:00:08] be forbidding a man so we've committed
[1:00:11] into the hands of the Lord and the grace
[1:00:13] of God so this will be in prayer as we
[1:00:17] get into these thoughts concerning the
[1:00:19] god of this evil Ayse it is tremendous
[1:00:22] and in Genesis 1 and beginning to read
[1:00:26] at verse 1 in the beginning God created
[1:00:29] the heaven and the earth amen
[1:00:32] and it's Elohim the self-existing one
[1:00:36] that created the heaven and the earth
[1:00:38] and the earth was without form and void
[1:00:41] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:00:46] deep and the Spirit of God moved upon
[1:00:49] the face of the waters praise the Lord
[1:00:52] and God said let there be light and
[1:00:56] there was light and God saw the light
[1:01:00] that it was good and God divided the
[1:01:05] light from the darkness amen it's the
[1:01:09] god of creation it's the self existing
[1:01:11] one it is not certainly not the God of
[1:01:13] this evil age and God called the light
[1:01:17] day and the darkness he called night and
[1:01:20] the evening and the morning were the
[1:01:24] first day a man God blesses words you
[1:01:28] may be seated
[1:01:32] turn with me to galatians chapter 1 and
[1:01:37] these are the scriptures that the
[1:01:39] problem was using in the message on the
[1:01:44] god of this evil age he has made
[1:01:49] reverence to even to Genesis but he's
[1:01:51] highlighting the god of this evil age
[1:01:54] we're in that we had been warned in the
[1:01:57] scriptures concerning him we have been
[1:02:00] warned in the scriptures concerning is
[1:02:01] this
[1:02:02] a man so grace that were serving and
[1:02:06] were worshipping the god of creation not
[1:02:09] the god of this evil age well yet there
[1:02:12] are many that are worshipping the god of
[1:02:14] this evil age thinking they're
[1:02:16] worshiping the god of creation because
[1:02:18] as he deceived Eve
[1:02:20] he's also deceiving believers even in
[1:02:22] this hour and in this age so that God
[1:02:25] help us that we're going to stay with
[1:02:26] the truth the whole truth nothing but
[1:02:29] the truth not add to it not take from it
[1:02:32] we're gonna we're gonna believe it and
[1:02:34] amen and by the grace of God yield to it
[1:02:36] and live it amen brother - there's this
[1:02:40] is this is the proof that it's going to
[1:02:42] be lived in your life amen and it's
[1:02:44] going to wreak and bring us into a total
[1:02:46] separation from the world and the things
[1:02:49] of the world
[1:02:49] amen you're just going not going to do
[1:02:52] anything to prove please the world not
[1:02:54] doing anything to please even worldly
[1:02:56] family or friends or neighbors no no
[1:02:58] you're gonna do that which pleases God a
[1:03:00] man but the devil is there to get us to
[1:03:03] compromise and he is indeed he is the
[1:03:06] God of this evil age it is not Jesus
[1:03:09] it is not Elohim because there is so
[1:03:11] little concerning God today there is so
[1:03:14] little that we know about Jesus today
[1:03:16] there's so little even even in the
[1:03:18] so-called denominational churches
[1:03:19] internet nomination 'el and
[1:03:21] non-denominational churches there's so
[1:03:23] little emphases that are put this put on
[1:03:25] God they're putting the emphasis on
[1:03:27] themselves they're putting the emphasis
[1:03:29] on what they want to do they're putting
[1:03:31] the aims in what's going on in the world
[1:03:32] but not on God and what he has promised
[1:03:36] amen because there was an hour when in
[1:03:38] Delisle Luther they put the emphasis on
[1:03:40] the word they put the emphasis on the
[1:03:42] wording Wesley and in the early
[1:03:44] Pentecostal church but brother I tell
[1:03:46] you they're not putting the emphasis on
[1:03:47] the word today that they did back then a
[1:03:51] man but by there's going to be a very
[1:03:53] very very few that are going to keep
[1:03:56] putting the emphasis on the word the
[1:03:58] word that then the whole truth and
[1:04:00] nothing but the truth so god help us
[1:04:02] that we're not going to be deceived by
[1:04:04] the god of this evil age that we're not
[1:04:07] as he was the seat and brother what did
[1:04:09] it would he get a quote he quoted the
[1:04:11] word equal to God amen
[1:04:14] accorded a quarter quarter jehovah
[1:04:16] elohim the self existing one yay and God
[1:04:19] said and brother and he's deceiving the
[1:04:22] world today with an especially believers
[1:04:24] with the same thing yay and God said
[1:04:27] through William Branham yes God said in
[1:04:30] his word jazz God said but a man and
[1:04:33] there's true many but preachers a man
[1:04:36] and then you know we know as our brother
[1:04:38] for sure brought it out
[1:04:39] he said when it comes to buts he said
[1:04:41] the only one the butts he said it is the
[1:04:43] goats a man so he said as to many are
[1:04:46] our sheep how many are lambs or how many
[1:04:50] are just playing goats brother I pray
[1:04:53] the Grace and listen what did he use the
[1:04:55] goats for the goat was used to lead to
[1:04:57] lead the Sheep of up into the the path
[1:05:00] ear to be slaughtered and when the pole
[1:05:02] goat got up on the top he moved away and
[1:05:04] the sheep went on in and they were
[1:05:06] slaughtered that's right so brother
[1:05:08] sister I pray the grace of God that
[1:05:10] we're following Elohim we're now
[1:05:12] following the god of this evil age the
[1:05:14] devil and remember it's going to be so
[1:05:17] close to seed the very elect if possible
[1:05:20] if you're elect you want me to see if
[1:05:22] you're electing you're gonna be on your
[1:05:24] guard if you're relaxed you're gonna
[1:05:25] know that oh what influenced me to do
[1:05:27] this what influenced me to say that oh
[1:05:29] you you know that it's the devil that is
[1:05:32] not God amen not Elohim and again it is
[1:05:35] a god but not the God of creation in the
[1:05:39] beginning God the self-existing one
[1:05:42] created the heavens and the earth a man
[1:05:45] but this is not the God that we're going
[1:05:47] to preach on and Minister on in in this
[1:05:49] series on the god of this evil age and
[1:05:51] it is absolutely tremendous the the some
[1:05:54] of the things that the prophet of God is
[1:05:56] bringing out and I'll had to be honest
[1:05:58] brother it is it is very hard and it's
[1:06:01] very challenging a man to our faith and
[1:06:04] many things of the prophet Isaiah saying
[1:06:06] we we were considered to be hard and
[1:06:08] blunt amen
[1:06:10] and he is right and he is blunt but he
[1:06:13] said I feel he said that you have need
[1:06:14] of this you need to have this revelation
[1:06:17] need to have this understanding if not
[1:06:19] we're gonna really be deceived a man
[1:06:22] because the devil is gonna be there and
[1:06:23] he's gonna he's gonna act like God talk
[1:06:25] like God a man and he'll quote the word
[1:06:28] the message and so on so brother I pray
[1:06:30] the grace of God that as a result of
[1:06:33] this this message and the series that
[1:06:34] we're doing on it we're going to
[1:06:36] understand what's going on we're gonna
[1:06:38] understand what we're dealing with we're
[1:06:40] gonna understand brother sister and a
[1:06:42] man the spirits that are working in this
[1:06:44] world today and the one that's got the
[1:06:46] pre evidence is not God Elohim it is the
[1:06:49] devil a man oh yeah and then and it is
[1:06:53] religious and oh yeah and he quoting the
[1:06:56] message quoting the scriptures amen
[1:06:58] but still it is the god of this evil age
[1:07:01] it is the god of this world and brother
[1:07:04] is not only William Branham and God
[1:07:06] through the prophet warning us
[1:07:07] concerning these things in the last days
[1:07:10] brother we find that their warning to
[1:07:12] the Christians even in the first church
[1:07:14] age a man that Satan becomes the god of
[1:07:17] this world a man he was the God he was a
[1:07:20] God here in the first stage a brother he
[1:07:23] was a guy he was a God in the Garden of
[1:07:24] Eden a man because Satan Eve recognized
[1:07:28] him and listened to him instead of
[1:07:30] staying with the word a man oh yes she
[1:07:33] had the word but he she let the devil
[1:07:35] add to the word a man why for all for
[1:07:39] the sake of the flesh it was real
[1:07:40] pleasing it was good for food it was
[1:07:42] good for this it was good for that yeah
[1:07:44] but was it good for your soul a man was
[1:07:47] there was an increase in your faith or
[1:07:49] decreasing your faith well that's that
[1:07:51] is the question so I pray the grace of
[1:07:53] God to help us brothers sisters to
[1:07:56] seriously consider the hard things that
[1:07:58] the Prophet is bringing out a man and
[1:08:01] brother and again he's not preaching
[1:08:02] that out there he's preaching that in
[1:08:04] his own church because why because he
[1:08:08] was no doubt dealing with those spirits
[1:08:10] even in his own church a man as I have
[1:08:13] violated before on certain messages that
[1:08:15] we have considered that the Prophet was
[1:08:18] ministering to his own church and
[1:08:19] knowing that as I just recently said he
[1:08:22] highlighted Weiland Branham Tabernacle
[1:08:24] with what to and he told them and he
[1:08:27] said he said you are he said you're in
[1:08:29] the message but he said the message is
[1:08:31] not in you yeah and brother what we say
[1:08:35] today because even even before the Lord
[1:08:37] called him home he said now he said I
[1:08:40] know he said isn't
[1:08:41] the message is not striking you the way
[1:08:43] that it should he said because he does
[1:08:45] not even striking me he said the way
[1:08:47] that it should a man because why because
[1:08:50] he wasn't meant for that hour but is
[1:08:52] meant for this hour and for this age if
[1:08:54] there's ever an hour to time that we
[1:08:56] needed the Lord to strike us with the
[1:08:58] word is this hour why so that will not
[1:09:01] be deceived a man and that we need the
[1:09:05] Lord to be there with us to encourage us
[1:09:07] to to give us wisdom to give us
[1:09:09] understanding hey buddy
[1:09:10] so that we're not going to see what the
[1:09:12] devil is saying and what the devil is
[1:09:14] doing amen
[1:09:15] but I tell you this there's many a
[1:09:17] believer there that's deceived and a
[1:09:20] that's the absolute truth and just
[1:09:22] talking about again there concerning the
[1:09:24] the the foolish virgins brother they
[1:09:28] went on a day or they were doing the
[1:09:30] father god I need to know understand he
[1:09:32] said they're virgins but are not wise
[1:09:34] virgins amen then it read the wisdom of
[1:09:37] the word like the wise words are did a
[1:09:39] man
[1:09:40] sweeter they're like Eve in the garden
[1:09:42] she's deceived so brother I trust were
[1:09:45] not the foolish virgins were the wise a
[1:09:47] man and there are a lot of believers
[1:09:49] that are just got the foolish virgin
[1:09:52] anointing on them and it's the deceit of
[1:09:55] the devil making them believe they're in
[1:09:58] the message but the message not in them
[1:10:00] a man it is in their heads but not in
[1:10:03] their hearts and brother we need to get
[1:10:06] this word we need to get this revelation
[1:10:08] in our hearts it is to give a speak amen
[1:10:12] it's got to be even if a comes out of
[1:10:14] the heart brother when it comes to hey
[1:10:16] if you got the word you got the word and
[1:10:17] you don't have the faith it's in your
[1:10:19] head but not in your heart because if
[1:10:22] the word is in your heart
[1:10:23] it gives faith and only that it gives
[1:10:26] the faith that pleases God amen so you
[1:10:29] can have faith but it's not pleasing to
[1:10:31] God well how come is not pleasing to God
[1:10:34] is faith because it's not for this hour
[1:10:36] for this age for what God is requiring
[1:10:38] in this hour what God is recording that
[1:10:41] we can have the faith of a previous age
[1:10:43] but God is not into that God is into
[1:10:46] this amen God is into into the into the
[1:10:49] end God is into the revelation of the
[1:10:51] resurrect
[1:10:51] the rapture God is into the revelation
[1:10:53] of the second coming of the Lord for his
[1:10:55] bride he came to Redeemer he has come
[1:10:58] together and to take her home to a

[1:11:57] to apply it to our own hearts play to
[1:11:59] our own lives hey man now I think I'm a
[1:12:02] believer so the prophet of God they all
[1:12:04] he's not saying that about me
[1:12:05] oh he's talking about those out there in
[1:12:07] the world no he's talking to believers
[1:12:10] yeah what the believers under guard so
[1:12:13] they'll know what's going on
[1:12:14] they'll be aware of what's going on and
[1:12:17] they'll get the faith to overcome it but
[1:12:21] grace to his brother I tell you it's
[1:12:24] serious it's serious in Galatians
[1:12:28] chapter one and verse one and again this
[1:12:39] is one of the Texas that the public got
[1:12:42] used in 1965 when he preached concerning
[1:12:45] the god of this evil age and in verse 1
[1:12:47] he said appalled and apostille not of
[1:12:50] men neither by man but he said but by
[1:12:54] jesus christ and god the father who
[1:12:57] raised him from the dead and all the
[1:13:00] brethren which are with me and onto the
[1:13:03] churches of Galatia
[1:13:05] grace be to you and peace from God the
[1:13:08] Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:12] who gave himself for our sins that he
[1:13:17] might deliver us from this present evil
[1:13:19] world it was an evil world ed it's an
[1:13:23] evil world now but it's much worse now
[1:13:25] than it was then a man and it's more
[1:13:30] deceived now than it was then and he
[1:13:34] said to him or he said deliver us from
[1:13:37] this present evil world when he grace of
[1:13:41] God to deliver us from the influence of
[1:13:43] the god of this evil age a man he said
[1:13:49] according to the will of God and our
[1:13:52] Father to whom be glory for ever and
[1:13:55] ever a man and one other scripture
[1:14:00] second Corinthians just turned back to
[1:14:06] second Corinthians chapter 4 amen
[1:14:11] and again beginning to read at verse 1
[1:14:15] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:14:19] seeing we have this ministry seeing we
[1:14:23] have this message grace as we have
[1:14:29] received mercy we faint not a man let's
[1:14:34] not compromise let's have the same faith
[1:14:37] that we had when we first came to this
[1:14:39] word only a greater faith amen
[1:14:43] by the grace of God because we're going
[1:14:45] from the revelation of God has sent a
[1:14:48] prophet and the revelation of the
[1:14:49] opening of the mystery of God to the
[1:14:52] purpose of why God did it and that was
[1:14:54] to give us rapturing faith a man are we
[1:14:59] getting Rattray faith there are those
[1:15:01] that are getting more and more knowledge
[1:15:02] of the message
[1:15:03] but less and less and less faith where
[1:15:06] is your faith brother we got the word we
[1:15:14] got the message now where's faith
[1:15:18] brother again the profit challenge to
[1:15:21] our face when he said if you can't
[1:15:23] believe for divine healing how can you
[1:15:24] believe for a rapture amen
[1:15:27] the faith for divine healing is any the
[1:15:31] physical body but the referee faith is
[1:15:33] changing the physical body completely
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:37] from time to eternity brother I tell you
[1:15:40] there's very few that are exercising
[1:15:43] faith are they are thinking faith how
[1:15:48] many are believing faith and they are
[1:15:50] trusting Amen or how many are confessing
[1:15:53] what the devil is putting in their minds
[1:15:56] yeah they're under Satan's anointing any
[1:15:59] and they're going to say this they're
[1:16:00] gonna say that do do this to do that
[1:16:02] that's the devil that's the god of this
[1:16:05] world brother if there's the God of
[1:16:06] creation you believe with a complete
[1:16:11] belief again as I mentioned the other
[1:16:14] night concerning the brother that was it
[1:16:16] saying oh that we gotta lay hands on the
[1:16:17] sick lands on the stake lands on the
[1:16:19] sink and I know there were giving me
[1:16:21] scripture scripture scripture scripture
[1:16:23] but laying on the bed laying all the
[1:16:25] veins the power of God said he said
[1:16:26] basically he said the laying on the
[1:16:28] veins with a Jewish tradition amen
[1:16:31] but when that surgery income and said to
[1:16:33] Jesus I'm not worthy you come under my
[1:16:35] roof he says speak the word only and
[1:16:37] Jesus said I had not found so great
[1:16:39] faith no he said not in Israel does he
[1:16:41] find that faith in you and me a man but
[1:16:45] that's the faith that God is looking for
[1:16:46] a man and it's a faith that the devil is
[1:16:49] there to challenge it's a faith that the
[1:16:51] devil is there to to get us away from
[1:16:54] but God wants us to get us more and more
[1:16:56] into that faith that believes God like
[1:16:59] like the Centurion Jesus I've not found
[1:17:01] so great faith not in Israel will he
[1:17:03] find that faith in you is he finding
[1:17:05] that faith in me that your glory so that
[1:17:08] we're not concentrating on the negative
[1:17:10] we're concentrating on the positive Amen
[1:17:13] is the revealed word it is written does
[1:17:16] not say the devil's to the demo I read
[1:17:18] this you had the devil got you to read
[1:17:19] it and the devil is trying to get you to
[1:17:21] put everything on this whatever's on
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:23] so God is putting Washington portents on
[1:17:25] the word stay with the word a man stay
[1:17:28] with the truth the whole truth nothing
[1:17:30] but the truth
[1:17:31] oh my god help us to go and live as

[1:17:49] right that's all you can do this God has
[1:17:51] said this God has said that yes God has
[1:17:53] said it a man but God has also said God
[1:17:57] has also said a man and brother in this
[1:18:00] hour of this age what did he do what he
[1:18:02] do in sending a ministry in this hour in
[1:18:05] this age like a brother/sister just like
[1:18:08] the ministry that a they came into the
[1:18:10] first stage in our Lord Jesus Christ a
[1:18:12] man in the beginning was the word the
[1:18:15] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us a
[1:18:17] man sweather was then so it is now in
[1:18:20] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:18:23] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:18:25] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:18:26] and brother it was to redeem us
[1:18:28] physically spiritually now he's made
[1:18:30] flesh in us to redeem us physically amen
[1:18:33] brother that what he started he's
[1:18:35] finishing us amen there was an elephant
[1:18:38] now we're in the Omega a Ministry of our
[1:18:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:42] and the Omega very is Christ in the
[1:18:45] bright crisis may flesh in the bright it
[1:18:47] is mrs. Jesus Christ if there's
[1:18:49] resurrection arrived through faith it is
[1:18:51] in mrs. Jesus Christ hey man if there's
[1:18:54] any resurrection raspberry faith you're
[1:18:56] the one that's what's that seen it
[1:18:57] amen if you're believing the word the
[1:19:00] way that God wants you to believe it if
[1:19:02] you're accepting it the way God why
[1:19:04] should accept it and again brother
[1:19:07] sister let's take it serious serious
[1:19:10] where the boat of God said he said God
[1:19:12] is waiting on us why for the
[1:19:16] resurrection the rapture got me yummy
[1:19:18] but yet there's too many believers are
[1:19:20] waiting on God
[1:19:21] Oh God do this guy do that God do this
[1:19:24] no God wants you to do it a man and
[1:19:27] brother sisters gave us the word he's
[1:19:30] done this he done that
[1:19:31] amen to give us the faith whereby we can
[1:19:33] do it amen
[1:19:36] but brother again the words got to
[1:19:37] strikers right anybody surely after 50
[1:19:41] years since they're going to the private
[1:19:43] over 50 years that the word is going to
[1:19:46] strength is right anyway that it's going
[1:19:48] to control us a man is gonna lead us
[1:19:50] guide us it's our wisdom it's our
[1:19:52] leadership amen
[1:19:53] that we become as I just preached on a
[1:19:55] prisoner to the word hey man anybody if
[1:19:59] you're a if you're in a national prison
[1:20:01] bringing your honor you're under control
[1:20:03] of all the rules and regulations and you
[1:20:05] gotta you gotta go by this rule that
[1:20:06] rule and so on so if you're prisoners of
[1:20:09] the word you stay with the word amen
[1:20:11] it's the whole truth nothing but the
[1:20:12] truth
[1:20:13] ain't man brother you're not gonna
[1:20:15] compromise no no not not because you
[1:20:17] like this or you like that no not by any
[1:20:19] means well I don't think the or
[1:20:20] reminders remind that wait this thing if
[1:20:24] it is do you need it do you want to do
[1:20:26] that do you really need to do that but
[1:20:29] most people want one to want to do this
[1:20:31] want to do that oh so we could enjoy
[1:20:33] life in what you got the Holy Ghost that
[1:20:36] is the joy of the Lord brother I can't
[1:20:39] see how you can enjoy this old world
[1:20:40] there's something wrong with your faith
[1:20:42] if you think all day if this is fine
[1:20:44] this is fine this is good this is good
[1:20:46] no no no not good by any means we want
[1:20:50] to get out of it and because God
[1:20:52] it said he's gonna destroy it with fire
[1:20:55] ain't man brother and the brother God
[1:20:58] brings those things out here in this
[1:21:00] message the god of this evil age and he
[1:21:04] said no he said it's hard to you but he
[1:21:06] said he said I got I gotta say it he's
[1:21:09] not that I want to but I got to ain't
[1:21:12] mad because why that was his is his
[1:21:14] calling his ministry amen is to separate
[1:21:18] the break for the resurrection and the
[1:21:21] rapture as I said God's waiting on us
[1:21:23] and then the prophet of God said yeah
[1:21:25] and he said the dead in Christ are
[1:21:26] waiting on us are we responding to their
[1:21:32] hunger and thirst responding to their
[1:21:35] hunger and thirst for the for the
[1:21:37] rapture the resurrection and a glorified
[1:21:40] body they're in their fee off anybody
[1:21:43] yeah and we all know but the theophany
[1:21:46] body is rate we're next to you
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:49] yeah and probably hasta is not is not
[1:21:52] anymore it's not 12 feet from you at any
[1:21:54] given time and have you seen if you're
[1:21:56] not believing the way you should he said
[1:21:58] it'll pull away and you'll be convicted
[1:21:59] and then when you repent it comes back a
[1:22:02] man so they're in there theophanies as
[1:22:04] the powder god said now they could see
[1:22:06] one another talk to one another but they
[1:22:08] can't touch one another no they're
[1:22:10] waiting on us for the glorified body
[1:22:13] everybody the resurrection and a
[1:22:16] glorified body brother are we really
[1:22:18] just getting increasing in in the
[1:22:20] knowledge of the message this doctrine
[1:22:21] this doctor of that doctrine or we are
[1:22:23] as the message given us more and more
[1:22:24] faith for the resurrection hey BAE C
[1:22:28] Luther went on and did what he did he
[1:22:29] did what he did a man and all made
[1:22:31] sacrifices after sacrifice all he
[1:22:34] thought he would justify himself but he
[1:22:35] didn't feel justified under finally a
[1:22:38] struggle in his heart the just shall
[1:22:41] live by faith and in Christ were
[1:22:43] justified oh then he went for preaching
[1:22:46] hey man he wasn't going for sacrifice in
[1:22:50] this sacrifice of that he went for
[1:22:51] preaching oh I justify you're justified
[1:22:55] Jesus justified us a man praise the name
[1:22:58] of the Lord he went on into the message
[1:23:00] so are we gone on into the message the
[1:23:04] message in us and I'll send the message
[1:23:06] well what are we going to be doing
[1:23:08] moving on to the resurrection moving on
[1:23:11] to the rapture because that's the climax
[1:23:13] of what God has done and what God is
[1:23:17] doing get out of here as I said I don't
[1:23:21] want to stay here when I consider what's
[1:23:25] going on in the world and I consider the
[1:23:27] compromising that believers are doing I
[1:23:29] said Lord get us out of here or all I
[1:23:32] agreed or if you don't get us out soon I
[1:23:34] still won't be any flesh saved there
[1:23:37] were nobody left for the rapture hey man
[1:23:40] he's hardly talked to a one out of a
[1:23:43] million well if there's 2 million
[1:23:44] believers do you mean you tell me it's
[1:23:46] only 2 going living Saints brother we
[1:23:51] got to take this more serious than what
[1:23:53] Luther took what he had take it more
[1:23:55] serious than 1 Wesley had take it more
[1:23:58] serious than the early Pentecostals oh
[1:24:00] yeah
[1:24:02] now at the climax and now God is
[1:24:04] finishing now see it's the Omega grace
[1:24:07] of God to his brother that were going to
[1:24:09] be more subject to the God of creation
[1:24:11] brother we're not going to listen to the
[1:24:13] god of this evil age and I tell you the
[1:24:15] devil is God what we're saying is the
[1:24:18] works of the devil the works of the god
[1:24:20] of this evil age is not God it's Satan
[1:24:23] and brother and not your anything he's
[1:24:27] in politics you see it but it's also in
[1:24:28] religion oh yeah those out there that
[1:24:32] are religious and they're just religious
[1:24:34] but they're not spiritual God Elvis in
[1:24:38] 2nd Corinthians 4 and verse 1 therefore
[1:24:43] seeing we have this ministry we have
[1:24:45] received mercy we faint not
[1:24:48] don't faint but have renounced the
[1:24:53] hidden things of dishonesty not walking
[1:24:58] in craftiness nor handling the Word of
[1:25:02] God deceitfully but he putting self
[1:25:07] interpretations to it no no you leave it
[1:25:13] the way God gave it not only the Word of
[1:25:17] God deceitfully but by manifestation of
[1:25:20] the truth commending ourselves to every
[1:25:23] man's conscience in the sight of God
[1:25:27] manifestation of the truth in you
[1:25:30] manifestation of the word in you and
[1:25:33] brother not just in this church God
[1:25:37] looking for it in your heart your soul
[1:25:39] even out there oh yes most definitely
[1:25:45] but more and more believers are starting
[1:25:48] to fall compromise but for to look more
[1:25:54] better in the eyes of the world all the
[1:25:56] old victors did they they'll receive us
[1:25:58] more oh they're like knowledge is more
[1:26:02] they'll have more fellowship with us
[1:26:03] no that's compromising that's the devil
[1:26:08] that's the god of this evil age getting
[1:26:11] you to compromise a little here a little
[1:26:12] there so you get more and more friends
[1:26:14] of the world brother Jesus stood more
[1:26:17] and more with the word and he got less
[1:26:19] and less and less till they crucified
[1:26:21] him he may understand the same things
[1:26:25] wouldn't happen to the troupe right the
[1:26:27] more you stay with the word take your
[1:26:28] stand for the word amen they're gonna
[1:26:32] try to crucify you god help us notice
[1:26:42] verse 3 again but if our gospel be hid
[1:26:45] it is hid to them that are lost in whom
[1:26:51] the god of this world amen
[1:26:54] the god of this world and he's not
[1:26:56] referring to Jesus he's referring to the
[1:26:59] devil in him the god of this world has
[1:27:03] blinded the minds of them he said which
[1:27:07] believe not lest the light of the
[1:27:10] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:27:12] image of God should shine unto them but
[1:27:15] it's more deceiving in this hour
[1:27:17] amen for we preach not ourselves but
[1:27:23] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:27:28] servants for Jesus sake for God who
[1:27:30] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:27:32] darkness as shine in our hearts to give
[1:27:35] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:27:37] of God in the face of Jesus Christ and
[1:27:41] we go for reflecting Christ go for
[1:27:47] reflecting the God of creation not the
[1:27:50] god of this world not the God of
[1:27:53] compromise we're going for it to reflect
[1:27:56] the God of the resurrection the god of
[1:27:58] the rapture amen again as Luther put the
[1:28:02] emphasis on justification we're putting
[1:28:04] the emphasis on the resurrection and the
[1:28:06] rapture amen god help us and in this
[1:28:11] message on the god of this evil age the
[1:28:13] property is hard blunt and challenging
[1:28:16] the sanity of worldly men and women and
[1:28:19] challenging the faith professing
[1:28:22] Christians and or professor
[1:28:26] to have in this insane world brother
[1:28:30] don't act like the world don't doctor
[1:28:32] the world don't live like the world
[1:28:33] because it's insanity brother again
[1:28:39] during denominational that back years
[1:28:42] ago that saw this and saw that out there
[1:28:44] and they said oh that's insanity what
[1:28:49] what are we as believers see if
[1:28:51] denominations would see that and call it
[1:28:54] insanity what would well what what we to
[1:28:57] see brother away if it was striking
[1:29:00] there have much more to strike us if
[1:29:05] they see this they see that brother
[1:29:07] again we were considered them to be
[1:29:08] foolish virgins but they see this to see
[1:29:11] that how much what ought we to see if we
[1:29:13] profess to be wise virgins what are we
[1:29:15] to see brother either wise they're gonna
[1:29:20] do a foolish virgin acts like that
[1:29:22] what a device virgin to act like brother
[1:29:26] the wise virgin wasn't looking for this
[1:29:28] the wise virgin was looking for the
[1:29:30] marriage supper we're looking for them
[1:29:33] for the rapture the resurrection taking
[1:29:35] us to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:29:37] amen
[1:29:39] to sit with him in his strong so brother
[1:29:41] in this message as we get into it you'll
[1:29:43] understand and I'll emphasize I heard
[1:29:46] and I blurt it out challenging then the
[1:29:50] prophetic ministry is when I lifting up
[1:29:53] william branham it wasn't William
[1:29:55] Brennan was God in William Brennan and
[1:29:59] not many preachers or professing
[1:30:02] Christians will repeat what the Lord
[1:30:04] through his prophet preached brother god
[1:30:09] help us I was amazed when I got back to
[1:30:13] this sermon that's the Lord graceful God
[1:30:18] we're not going to ignore it
[1:30:19] Oh Lord and we'll just we'll just take
[1:30:23] the sermon on choosing a bride we just
[1:30:26] take the sermon on perfect faith we'll
[1:30:27] just take the sermon on this subject
[1:30:29] that's sort of this doctrine that
[1:30:30] doctrine
[1:30:31] no this was one of the last service that
[1:30:33] he preached and he and he felt within
[1:30:36] himself that God wanted him to preach it
[1:30:38] and
[1:30:39] that we needed it and we do a man so
[1:30:43] that we're not going to be deceived as
[1:30:44] Eve was a man
[1:30:47] Satan was also a God in the garden he
[1:30:51] was and he did say yet God said he
[1:30:57] quoted the scripture and yes God said
[1:30:59] and they quote the message let's be
[1:31:04] careful there we're going to stay with
[1:31:05] what God said and there's too many
[1:31:09] believers in compromising I have to be
[1:31:12] honest as I said I've been hitter I
[1:31:14] around this message now since 1966 over
[1:31:18] 50 years and all the changes I've seen
[1:31:22] the compromising I'd say yeah among the
[1:31:26] people among ministry and brethren oh
[1:31:28] yeah compromising so brother I pray
[1:31:33] God's grace to help us to stay with the
[1:31:35] truth and the whole truth and nothing
[1:31:37] but the truth and it will indeed take
[1:31:39] the grace of God to enable us to stay in
[1:31:41] line with the truth of the will of God
[1:31:46] as I said we ought to come to that place
[1:31:49] now not my will don't be done because
[1:31:52] we're fighting it Jesus fought with an
[1:31:55] unbelieving world with the same curse
[1:31:58] world with an insane generation so god
[1:32:04] help us to stay in line please don't go
[1:32:11] back into denominational ideas don't
[1:32:15] don't believe that denominational spirit
[1:32:16] get on you and you and you make a
[1:32:18] denomination out of the message oh yeah
[1:32:21] there's a lot of searches message
[1:32:23] churches and then we'll know more than
[1:32:24] the like denominations out there they're
[1:32:29] just a denomination but how many are
[1:32:31] hungry thirsty for the resurrection
[1:32:33] trusting for the rapture screaming
[1:32:35] crying praying and the ministry
[1:32:37] preaching on its Laura careful be
[1:32:39] careful be careful if this go let's go
[1:32:41] let's go let's get out of here no grace
[1:32:49] not only this our sisters will indeed
[1:32:53] need the grace of God to dress and to
[1:32:56] act as old-fashioned only ghost filled
[1:32:59] Christians yeah and brother the powder
[1:33:04] God is highlighting not just the
[1:33:06] Brethren but the sisters and what
[1:33:10] they're doing
[1:33:11] yeah these are knocked on with worldly
[1:33:15] people out there but believers what
[1:33:18] they're doing it's the influence of the
[1:33:20] god of this evil age God's grace they
[1:33:29] will not face we a rather God's grace
[1:33:36] said we will have faith to catch the
[1:33:38] revelation of the god of this evil age
[1:33:41] and let the word put us on our guard
[1:33:44] against the deception of the devil
[1:33:46] there's a lot of believers are dissolved
[1:33:49] is he deceived they're deceived and
[1:33:52] that's why they're not as much into it
[1:33:57] like they used to be years ago why
[1:34:02] they're under Satan's a-19 not on not
[1:34:04] God's anointing if as a Holy Ghost of 90
[1:34:08] you're on fire for the things of God
[1:34:10] you're unfair for the resurrection
[1:34:12] rapture amen
[1:34:15] but I tell you there's so few that have
[1:34:17] that anointing of God in their hearts
[1:34:20] and souls that's why I said like they
[1:34:22] one time their atmosphere there were so
[1:34:24] much so much of 19 in the world and not
[1:34:26] around the earth that your mind it was
[1:34:28] in the atmosphere you walk outdoors
[1:34:30] anywhere and you could feel it you could
[1:34:32] sense it but now you don't sense it I
[1:34:38] don't feel it why because they're so few
[1:34:42] that got the Holy Ghost oh yeah I don't
[1:34:49] feel the atmosphere is not like it used
[1:34:52] to be why because there's less and less
[1:34:55] and less and less with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:57] where is there where is back so many
[1:35:00] years ago the anointing was was on the
[1:35:02] Saints then do you know any was out of
[1:35:04] states here the anointing was on the
[1:35:05] Saints in central do you know any one of
[1:35:06] the Saints around the world not anymore
[1:35:12] god help us the Satan is so deceiving in
[1:35:17] these last days that we are warned that
[1:35:20] there will be no flesh saved if the Lord
[1:35:22] didn't shorten time let's not assume
[1:35:26] that we are believers let's make sure
[1:35:28] we're believers by lining constantly
[1:35:31] lining up with the word yeah asking
[1:35:34] grace Lord in the name of Jesus grant
[1:35:36] grace Lord please Lord that we're going
[1:35:39] to stay in line with the word we're
[1:35:41] going to we're gonna become more and
[1:35:42] more of the word in flesh amen
[1:35:46] and if you were the word in flesh you're
[1:35:48] going to act like the word in flesh
[1:35:49] Jesus oh yeah you can have the attitude
[1:35:55] Jesus hedge you're gonna have the spirit
[1:35:56] Jesus head the hunger he had the thirsty
[1:35:58] aid and brother he wasn't interested in
[1:36:00] soul world he was interested in the
[1:36:02] world to come there's like I said Jesus
[1:36:05] said I'm not longer shall I be with you
[1:36:07] well how much longer should I be in this
[1:36:10] whole world I'm sick of it Lord it's
[1:36:16] time to go please but there's not many
[1:36:19] believers had that attitude they're just
[1:36:21] believers and they're satisfied and
[1:36:23] going on
[1:36:31] Issy he said tonight I want to speak if
[1:36:38] the Lord willing he said of God or
[1:36:40] rather there was another message but he
[1:36:44] wanted to minister on this subject in in
[1:36:47] the morning message on the god of this
[1:36:50] evil age and he read from Galatians he
[1:36:53] read from second Corinthians as we've
[1:36:54] already read and he did say he said in
[1:36:57] whom the god of this world has blinded
[1:36:58] the minds of them which believe not lest
[1:37:01] the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:37:03] Christ he soon as the image of God
[1:37:06] should shine unto them
[1:37:07] and he said the same as it was in the
[1:37:11] Garden of Eden amen
[1:37:15] what brought the deception the devil and
[1:37:18] he was using the serpent and again the
[1:37:22] serpent wasn't was he was an operator
[1:37:24] creature like a man and so close to man
[1:37:27] that is see seed would mingle with the
[1:37:29] man woman seed yeah Satan got into the
[1:37:34] serpent and he influenced the serpent
[1:37:36] the serpent influenced II so Satan is
[1:37:38] getting into the Serpent's in this day
[1:37:40] and in this hour and he what he's there
[1:37:42] to influence the bride yeah he-man Satan
[1:37:48] was talking to Eve through the serpent
[1:37:51] this is God is talking to the bride
[1:37:54] through a prophet but don't brother
[1:37:57] who's talking to you if it's a ministry
[1:38:00] make sure it's a god called ministry
[1:38:02] make sure it's God and not the devil
[1:38:04] because remember we're warned in the
[1:38:06] Bible that even the devil's angels are
[1:38:08] preaching the gospel that's right devil
[1:38:14] yeah the Devils are preaching it Paul
[1:38:17] warned us why he knew that they're going
[1:38:21] to preach this and add to it or they
[1:38:23] would take away from the truth oh yeah
[1:38:26] their own ideas brother again that
[1:38:29] that's what the God was highlighting in
[1:38:31] the book of Revelation the deeds of the
[1:38:33] Nicolaitans in the first church age and
[1:38:38] eventually it became doctrine and
[1:38:41] eventually it became an organization
[1:38:43] controlling the people oh yeah right on
[1:38:47] down to the third age of legally the
[1:38:49] third age he became an organization and
[1:38:50] a denomination controlled the people and
[1:38:53] God hated it but God loved the first
[1:38:56] stage second date because you you also
[1:38:58] hate the diesel and Acadians there was
[1:39:01] believers there that recognized that it
[1:39:03] was the devil brother do you recognize
[1:39:07] Satan's influence in your life Satan
[1:39:11] trying to do this train trying to get
[1:39:12] you to do this
[1:39:13] yeah god help us he says the same as it
[1:39:19] was in the Garden of Eden the god of
[1:39:21] this old world blinding the minds of
[1:39:24] them that believe not one believer know
[1:39:27] God knows God I said you're hurt do you
[1:39:30] believe in your heart make sure you make
[1:39:34] sure that you're not one of those that
[1:39:35] are dead the devil the god of this world
[1:39:37] is blinding so he said my text this
[1:39:44] morning is the god of this evil age and
[1:39:46] he said as we read in the scriptures now
[1:39:49] he said this message points out the
[1:39:51] evils of this evil age and it is fitting
[1:39:54] to prophesy for this evil age and it's
[1:39:58] my belief that the Bible has every
[1:40:01] answer for every age and he said written
[1:40:05] in the Bible for the believer and I
[1:40:08] believe that everything that we have
[1:40:10] need of is written here he said just
[1:40:13] needs to be interpreted by the Holy
[1:40:15] Spirit a man make sure is that the Holy
[1:40:22] Spirit not the Holy Spirit and Satan is
[1:40:25] there with his ministry to try to
[1:40:27] interpret this preach this priest is
[1:40:29] preached this oh they love to hear this
[1:40:31] they love to hear that yeah that's the
[1:40:36] truth he's going to give you what you
[1:40:38] want to hear physically not spiritually
[1:40:43] he said notice closely as we study the
[1:40:46] word he said the god of this evil age
[1:40:49] that we are now living he said it may
[1:40:51] seem strange a very strange thing in
[1:40:54] this age of grace when God has taken a
[1:40:56] people for his namesake is bright and he
[1:41:00] said this in this age that should be
[1:41:04] called the age of evil and is evil yes
[1:41:11] because according to the revelation they
[1:41:14] put Jesus out of the church jesus said
[1:41:19] he highlights - there he said jesus said
[1:41:21] you say you're rich and increased with
[1:41:23] Goods and have need of nothing see where
[1:41:26] they're putting the emphasis finance on
[1:41:28] money but names on prosperity part name
[1:41:30] is on this this world and this life but
[1:41:33] not the world could come but jesus said
[1:41:36] you know not that you're wretched
[1:41:38] miserable poor blind naked and don't
[1:41:42] know what that is blind the devil is
[1:41:47] blind them to that truth but in the
[1:41:50] emphasis on the natural but not on the
[1:41:51] spiritual brother and as I said don't
[1:41:55] don't sing a lie if we sing a tender and
[1:41:58] cottage why should I care when this
[1:42:01] generation does care they do they don't
[1:42:05] want to tent
[1:42:06] they don't want a cottage they want it
[1:42:07] they want a nice house they're building
[1:42:10] a mansion for me over there how many
[1:42:12] really really truly believe it or is it
[1:42:16] just religion
[1:42:22] it's the age of evil this last stage in
[1:42:28] each of the very age that God is calling
[1:42:30] her people for his namesake by grace and
[1:42:35] he said it's this is called an evil age
[1:42:38] and we'll prove it by the Bible that
[1:42:40] this is the age that he was speaking up
[1:42:42] now this is very strange he said say
[1:42:45] it's a very strange thing to think he
[1:42:47] said that in an evil age that God would
[1:42:50] be calling his bride he is but there's
[1:42:56] not many he said listen he's calling not
[1:43:03] a group church but a people for his name
[1:43:07] that receives his name engaged in his
[1:43:10] name going to a wedding to be married
[1:43:13] and become part of him by predestination
[1:43:16] that's what he's doing through the word
[1:43:19] it's calling out the bride separating
[1:43:22] the bright on Dame Psalms so grace in
[1:43:28] the name of Jesus that we can make our
[1:43:30] calling an election sure by the word by
[1:43:32] the message a man with a brother do you
[1:43:35] have a right attitude do you have a
[1:43:37] right spirit do you have a right motor
[1:43:40] and objective well what is the right
[1:43:45] attitude right motive right objective
[1:43:47] the same one that Jesus had we have
[1:43:52] grace but yet as I said I've noticed not
[1:43:57] a believers don't have the right
[1:43:58] attitude they don't have the right
[1:44:01] spirit they don't have right motives and
[1:44:03] right objectives again as I said that
[1:44:06] person that I was dealing with that had
[1:44:08] just been introduced to the message that
[1:44:11] he felt that the person that was dealing
[1:44:13] giving him the witness of the message
[1:44:15] never had that right attitude never had
[1:44:18] that read spirit right motive an
[1:44:20] objective and as I searched first when I
[1:44:22] come to this message I discerned that
[1:44:24] spirit I'm many many believers back
[1:44:26] there over fifty years ago and that's
[1:44:28] why I preach what I preach in life to
[1:44:31] ever knock
[1:44:33] I said he loved them which love you what
[1:44:36] reward have you do not even the
[1:44:38] publicans the same oh yeah they were
[1:44:41] caught up with themselves caught up with
[1:44:43] other believers come up with this but
[1:44:44] look down their noses at anybody that
[1:44:47] didn't believe the message don't do that
[1:44:50] keep your spirit right in your attitude
[1:44:52] right because a brother a man if your
[1:44:55] attitudes not right your motives not
[1:44:56] right objectives not right your spirits
[1:44:58] not right then brother that person out
[1:45:00] there we're gonna rise in judgment
[1:45:01] against you come maybe their attitude
[1:45:04] was right their spirit was right just
[1:45:06] say God and I had not revealed to them
[1:45:08] the message that he that was ordained to
[1:45:10] call it a bride they're not lost
[1:45:14] he was thought all just hey as long as
[1:45:16] you're in the message you're safe no
[1:45:19] it's the bride many are called few are
[1:45:24] chosen but as I said the called are not
[1:45:26] not lost the children is the bride
[1:45:30] because why there's gonna be millions
[1:45:32] and millions and millions and outside
[1:45:34] the city again brother diamond was
[1:45:39] highlighting those thing when we are in
[1:45:40] our conversation about the word about
[1:45:42] those in the city and those outside the
[1:45:44] city
[1:45:44] I said yes brother that's right I said
[1:45:48] keep your attitude right because there's
[1:45:49] a lot of people are there's gonna be
[1:45:50] outside the city amen
[1:45:53] the grace of God and no doubt I guess
[1:45:56] there's some a lot of believers to that
[1:45:58] be outside the city
[1:45:59] I pray grace that again because they're
[1:46:02] not bright but I'll tell you this if
[1:46:05] they're in the message and the messages
[1:46:06] in them they got a right attitude they
[1:46:08] got a right spirit right motive right
[1:46:10] objective and they are spiritual not
[1:46:16] religious but spiritual are you
[1:46:19] spiritual are you spiritual in your
[1:46:22] thoughts spiritually in your words
[1:46:23] virtually your deeds are you spiritual
[1:46:25] in your actions proving that is Christ
[1:46:30] living in you
[1:46:35] yeah grace of God he said last week in
[1:46:40] Matthew 24 he said it was most deceiving
[1:46:44] age of all ages all the ages of deceit
[1:46:47] from the Garden of Eden all the way down
[1:46:50] he said there's never been an age so
[1:46:52] deceptive as this age and that's the
[1:46:55] truth there were a generation of
[1:46:59] believers that need to be under guard as
[1:47:01] this generation he said false prophets
[1:47:07] will rise and show signs and wonders and
[1:47:09] if possible to deceive the very elect
[1:47:12] 'add but he said it's up there almost
[1:47:15] like the real thing
[1:47:16] just leaving out one word is all you
[1:47:18] have to do leave out one word you're
[1:47:22] deceived and he said Christians
[1:47:26] everywhere taking each of the hour we
[1:47:28] are living and he should mark down and
[1:47:31] read and listen close brother he's
[1:47:33] getting serious he's getting more
[1:47:36] serious than what they thought he would
[1:47:37] get and he was going more harder than
[1:47:40] what they realized he would be but today
[1:47:43] most message believers they don't want
[1:47:45] preachers to preach art don't get
[1:47:47] personal
[1:47:48] impersonal oh I just preached the
[1:47:50] message so yeah this doctor that I
[1:47:54] preached this preached the early they
[1:47:55] can preach with the resurrection of
[1:47:56] rapture - oh good good praise the Lord
[1:47:59] Amen thank you Jesus and Jesus will see
[1:48:03] thank me can I thank you for your faith
[1:48:09] as Jesus recognized the Centurions faith
[1:48:13] Wow he said I've not found so great
[1:48:16] faith no not in Israel amen he
[1:48:20] recognized it he acknowledged it he may
[1:48:23] that's the guy I paid God's looking for
[1:48:25] Oh Lord you do this you do that then the
[1:48:29] prophet of God said that's the trouble
[1:48:30] with us he said when it comes to being
[1:48:32] Christians God do this God do this God
[1:48:34] do that but you get the Holy Ghost God's
[1:48:37] giving you the power to do it
[1:48:40] amen
[1:48:43] the Christians everywhere take heed to
[1:48:45] the hour we are living in he said mark
[1:48:47] Adele and listen close one would God
[1:48:50] call the people out of this evil age for
[1:48:52] his name and he said the reason is to
[1:48:55] try her is bright and he said when she
[1:48:58] has made manifest been tried proven and
[1:49:01] he's approved to Satan he said like it
[1:49:04] was at the beginning so shall it be in
[1:49:06] the end Amen brother that Satan won't
[1:49:11] deceive us
[1:49:12] by grace listen we find now this evil
[1:49:20] ages prove to Satan she is not like Eve
[1:49:25] and she is not that type of woman and
[1:49:28] she will be tried by His Word the bride
[1:49:31] as Adams bride was tried by the word and
[1:49:34] Adams bride will eat every bit of the
[1:49:37] word all but one confused
[1:49:40] promise yeah don't let the devil give
[1:49:45] you a promise make sure it's God but the
[1:49:49] devil promised Eve this he said yes is
[1:49:53] Eve he said God as said but I say unto
[1:49:57] you you shall not God said you shall die
[1:50:02] is you shall not surely die surely let's
[1:50:07] be plain yeah and so she did fall to his
[1:50:13] deceit and many and many believers today
[1:50:16] are falling to the devil's deceit please
[1:50:20] let's not ignore the revelation of the
[1:50:22] Garden of Eden because now we're under
[1:50:26] the influence of the god of this evil
[1:50:27] age and we are in Satan's Eden because
[1:50:33] not long after he preached this message
[1:50:34] on the god of this evil age he preached
[1:50:37] Satan's Eden oh and I'm not going to
[1:50:42] worry with this it's not gonna worry
[1:50:44] about that you better be on your guard
[1:50:56] she believed but confused on one promise
[1:50:59] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:02] forever but failed on one promise under
[1:51:04] the temptation of the enemy face-to-face
[1:51:06] and now the people that's called for his
[1:51:09] name is his right and she has come to in
[1:51:12] contact again by the same thing not just
[1:51:15] denominational truth but every word does
[1:51:19] not get it let's get the Holy Ghost not
[1:51:21] not a nomination spirit but the Holy
[1:51:23] Spirit and I'll be honest just many a
[1:51:27] believers got denominational spirits
[1:51:30] they think like denominations act like
[1:51:32] denomination yeah talk like denomination
[1:51:35] yeah Dena there's people out there in
[1:51:37] denomination to talk this this and this
[1:51:39] while we believe this we believe this we
[1:51:40] believe that yeah and same thing wrong
[1:51:43] believers but they're not living it it's
[1:51:46] not in control of them morning noon and
[1:51:48] night
[1:51:49] what is the will of God again sons and
[1:51:58] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[1:51:59] of God amen are you led by the Spirit
[1:52:07] the Holy Spirit what brought you here
[1:52:10] today a religious spirit or the Holy
[1:52:14] Spirit to some people religious spirits
[1:52:19] bring them to the church that's right
[1:52:22] but if they're brighter Christ warned
[1:52:26] again the Holy Ghost brings you amen
[1:52:30] it's God in control by the grace of God
[1:52:37] he said in the beginning of the Bible
[1:52:39] man was given the Word of God to live by
[1:52:42] and he said it must be every word and in
[1:52:46] the middle of the Bible Jesus came and
[1:52:48] said man shall not live by bread alone
[1:52:50] but by every word and when he was
[1:52:53] tempted by Satan and God telling us here
[1:52:56] in the last days that the god of this
[1:52:58] world will rise up in the last days anew
[1:53:01] so ever shall add one word or take one
[1:53:04] word it is his part will be taken from
[1:53:06] the book of life and he said God be
[1:53:09] merciful
[1:53:09] to us and let us not walk as stiff
[1:53:12] shirts with our chest stuck out our head
[1:53:16] up know-it-all for we too are one one
[1:53:20] time we're in disobedience
[1:53:22] let us with grace and mercy and feeling
[1:53:25] in our hearts toward God only come to
[1:53:28] the throne of grace amen
[1:53:30] be humble strange after nineteen hundred
[1:53:36] years of gospel preaching that she that
[1:53:40] is the world system is more evil than in
[1:53:43] the days when he was here yeah they're
[1:53:47] more evil today than they were two
[1:53:48] thousand years ago more deceived today
[1:53:52] than they were two thousand years ago he
[1:53:54] said the world system is more evil and
[1:53:57] the world is heading to a climax a great
[1:54:00] climax and he said you know that the
[1:54:02] Lord is fulfilling his word on every
[1:54:05] hand and that's the truth
[1:54:09] god help us
[1:54:13] brother it is a climax listen as I've
[1:54:18] said over the last few years scientists
[1:54:20] even science certain scientists have
[1:54:22] acknowledged that there's something
[1:54:24] going on and that the earth is coming -
[1:54:28] it's in yeah that's why I said that
[1:54:31] they're certain scientists had told told
[1:54:35] to other scientists he said make the
[1:54:38] moon livable because he said the earth
[1:54:41] is getting coming to the place where it
[1:54:43] will be unlivable we know there's
[1:54:47] something going on in the earth
[1:54:48] something going on around the world on
[1:54:50] the earth and there's things that we
[1:54:52] know and things we don't know so let's
[1:54:54] be on our guard because why scientists
[1:54:59] acknowledge that but they don't
[1:55:00] acknowledge the scripture where he said
[1:55:02] he's gonna have a new heaven and a new
[1:55:04] earth they know that this Old Earth and
[1:55:08] heaven is passing away there's something
[1:55:10] going on they know in the atmosphere
[1:55:12] everything is changing
[1:55:14] we know it's the fire of God amen
[1:55:18] but he said I'll create a new heaven and
[1:55:20] a new earth
[1:55:23] I'm longing for it are you longing for
[1:55:27] the kingdom of God can you imagine what
[1:55:28] the kingdom of God is gonna be like
[1:55:31] perfect you know and there's gonna be no
[1:55:35] no thoughts about the world no thoughts
[1:55:38] about evil no thoughts of sin no one
[1:55:40] belief absolute perfection what I said
[1:55:46] but it's gonna be real and if you can't
[1:55:48] serve God here you won't serve there if
[1:55:51] God can't use your here he won't use her
[1:55:53] there and that's why we're here and
[1:55:56] going through all we're going through
[1:55:57] God wants to see how you're going to act
[1:56:00] now you're going to react oh good good
[1:56:02] so what so now he said I could use them
[1:56:05] in the world to come in these Kingdom
[1:56:11] but I tell you there's a lot of
[1:56:13] so-called believers he won't be able to
[1:56:14] use because they're absolutely lazy
[1:56:19] spiritually lazy their brother those
[1:56:27] that were filled with the Holy Ghost or
[1:56:29] mine they weren't lazy they were in in
[1:56:31] it Oh morning noon and night they were
[1:56:33] filled with the Holy Ghost they were
[1:56:35] doing this doing this they just live for
[1:56:37] God they live for Jesus they live for
[1:56:40] one another they weren't caught up with
[1:56:42] the food of this world they were cut
[1:56:44] they were caught up with the spiritual
[1:56:45] that had that had a greater premise in
[1:56:47] their life than anything natural yeah
[1:56:52] absolutely changed by the grace of God
[1:56:57] but again there's a lot of so-called
[1:56:59] believers are just carnal just Karen
[1:57:03] just lived in this world same as the
[1:57:05] same as those out the people out there
[1:57:07] living same mode of same objectives same
[1:57:10] attitude some of them might be religious
[1:57:13] some are not religious so I'm don't even
[1:57:15] believe in God you know but again just
[1:57:17] to do his believers out there just
[1:57:18] caught up with the natural world but
[1:57:23] their spiritual ones that I caught up
[1:57:26] with the promise of the world to come
[1:57:30] they're with me it says what is it the
[1:57:35] world is heading to a climax why the
[1:57:38] spirit of lawlessness moral decay
[1:57:41] scientific religion has led it to the
[1:57:44] cage of every eighth full and unclean
[1:57:48] bird as the Bible said and he said
[1:57:53] revelation 18 and he asked him to turn
[1:57:57] to Revelation 18 you turn your Bibles to
[1:58:01] Revelation 18 I'll just be another two
[1:58:06] moments
[1:58:17] and verse 1
[1:58:26] and after these things I saw another
[1:58:29] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:58:32] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:58:35] his glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:58:39] strong voice saying Babylon the Great is
[1:58:43] fallen is fallen is become the
[1:58:47] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:58:50] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:58:54] unclean and hateful bird you know God
[1:59:00] help us to recognize prophecy fulfilled
[1:59:03] in the world we're living in
[1:59:05] why are we experiencing this why are we
[1:59:07] seeing this where we're seeing that it
[1:59:09] is it is written its thus saith the Lord
[1:59:13] for all nations and drunk of the wine of
[1:59:15] the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:59:18] kings of the earth have committed
[1:59:20] fornication with her brother again does
[1:59:26] not focus on the natural spiritual you
[1:59:32] can commit spiritual fornication yeah we
[1:59:36] focus on all the natural if the natural
[1:59:37] know spiritual the kings of their the
[1:59:42] committed fornication with her and the
[1:59:44] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[1:59:47] through the abundance of her delicacies
[1:59:52] amen
[1:59:53] I have heard another voice from heaven
[1:59:59] saying come out of her my people that ye
[2:00:04] be not partakers of her sins and that ye
[2:00:06] receive not of her plagues amen for her
[2:00:12] sins have reached unto the heaven and
[2:00:14] God has remembered her iniquities pray
[2:00:19] grace that were increase and there's no
[2:00:22] remembrance of our sin but if your
[2:00:27] spirit is not right you had to it's not
[2:00:29] right God remembers her sin yeah but
[2:00:33] your spirit is right your attitude is
[2:00:35] right amen and you got the Holy Ghost
[2:00:38] God doesn't remember
[2:00:39] is cast into the sea of forgetfulness
[2:00:42] praise the Lord just a couple of quotes
[2:00:48] he said what a warning that throws the
[2:00:52] church exactly back to Revelation 3 to
[2:00:56] the lauda C&H lawlessness real religious
[2:01:01] but lawless and he said now because I'll
[2:01:05] say us that we are rich increased with
[2:01:07] Goods and have not need of nothing and
[2:01:10] knowest not that thou art naked and
[2:01:13] miserable and blind and don't know it
[2:01:15] he said perfectly with the scripture of
[2:01:18] this age not for the scripture of the
[2:01:20] age of Daniel not for those in the age
[2:01:22] of Noah but is in the last evil age is
[2:01:25] worse worse than the time of Daniel
[2:01:28] worse than the age of Noah a man has
[2:01:31] gone beyond and it's worse than Sodom
[2:01:34] and Gomorrah I don't know if you're
[2:01:38] seeing it or not and it's brother Brown
[2:01:41] especially emphasizes because he said
[2:01:43] the woman is the god of this world and
[2:01:45] so on but he emphasizes what the devil
[2:01:50] is using the woman to do this do this to
[2:01:51] that and brother as I said what I'm
[2:01:56] seeing out there now even even senior
[2:01:59] citizens the way they're dressed I said
[2:02:03] Lord I said the world is insane
[2:02:06] you're right I sure was right when I see
[2:02:09] seniors where there's at a bank or in
[2:02:12] this in a mall or wherever it is and you
[2:02:14] see them dressed this way a dress that I
[2:02:16] said Lord that's insane I said one time
[2:02:21] I said young people dressed a certain
[2:02:22] way but the the older ones didn't didn't
[2:02:24] dress like that and I said oh my said
[2:02:28] what kind of spirit is on her lord I
[2:02:29] pray grace or salvation of her soul but
[2:02:32] I said oh my their spirit is hunter says
[2:02:34] she's dresses this way Natura this is
[2:02:36] just this way oh it's just it's a insane
[2:02:42] brother grace to us and now of course
[2:02:45] it's affecting the whole world and again
[2:02:48] you'll find that it's more you see this
[2:02:51] more on that more on the sisters are
[2:02:52] under brother under women rather than on
[2:02:55] men there are some out there that are
[2:02:59] perverted some of them that are that are
[2:03:01] crazy in the way they're acting and
[2:03:03] dressing but mostly it's the women as it
[2:03:08] was in the Garden of Eden Saudis today
[2:03:10] sisters be on your guard
[2:03:21] he said he said let it soak real deep
[2:03:25] oh yeah he's taking his time as he goes
[2:03:31] into the word and he's landed he and
[2:03:33] Blane today and he gets heard heard
[2:03:35] heard blonde blonde blonde he said there
[2:03:41] are naked he said let that soak real
[2:03:44] deep I know I may have much disagreement
[2:03:47] on this tonight but he said it's got to
[2:03:49] a place that a Christian can only walk
[2:03:52] out of his house and not be brought into
[2:03:54] the presence of this evil age and that
[2:03:57] is the truth that's the truth
[2:04:01] and he said out he said by on sufficient
[2:04:06] he said dressed women as as the devil
[2:04:11] the god of this world used a woman in
[2:04:14] the first time in the Garden of Eden so
[2:04:17] he's using the women today such as
[2:04:20] anyone needs to be under guard as two
[2:04:22] sisters the brothers he said women I'm
[2:04:27] going to say this and I want you to
[2:04:29] listen and men and women you might
[2:04:31] disagree with this but I feel led to say
[2:04:34] it and he said did you know any woman
[2:04:37] that dresses like hers herself like that
[2:04:39] is not in her right mind are you insane
[2:04:45] have you lost your right mind I know
[2:04:47] there's a lot of believers that Jesse
[2:04:49] more like the world now yeah
[2:04:53] because I would see it sometimes you
[2:04:55] only in a certain place serve like my
[2:04:57] lord I said that's crazy
[2:04:59] during Saint I said not normal anymore
[2:05:01] and then all of a sudden you'd begin to
[2:05:03] see maybe a sister here it's sister
[2:05:05] there sister somewhere else you know Oh
[2:05:09] taking on to taking on the spirit of the
[2:05:12] world that's the influence of the god of
[2:05:15] this evil age are you more concerned
[2:05:19] about pleasing God or pleasing man now
[2:05:25] I'll finish with this here but also to
[2:05:28] say that the problem God said do you
[2:05:31] know he says you can be good you can be
[2:05:34] this you could be that and never
[2:05:36] unfaithful to your husband but it's you
[2:05:37] dressed like that and you go out there
[2:05:39] and he's you cause a man he said to look
[2:05:41] look at you and lust after you and he
[2:05:42] said he said you'll be guilty of
[2:05:44] adultery yeah oh don't worry about this
[2:05:51] don't worry about that
[2:05:51] are you better God looks at the heart
[2:05:59] he said I feel laid to say this and
[2:06:02] woman that dresses herself like that is
[2:06:05] not in her right mind and do you know
[2:06:08] she is whether she believes or not or
[2:06:10] things that are not she is a prostitute
[2:06:13] though the woman might stain with her
[2:06:16] hand before God and swear she's never
[2:06:18] touched been touched by any other man
[2:06:22] but her husband and that might be honest
[2:06:24] truth but still she's a prostitute she
[2:06:28] got a prostitute spirit causing her
[2:06:31] dress like that Jesus and whosoever
[2:06:35] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[2:06:37] hath committed adultery with her and he
[2:06:40] said she and she said she's naked the
[2:06:43] Bible says and don't know it
[2:06:44] the spirit that's an annoying year to do
[2:06:46] such a thing is an evil prostitute
[2:06:48] spirit well spirit see sisters be
[2:06:53] careful let the Holy Spirit cover you
[2:06:55] don't let the devil the god of this
[2:06:58] world bring a prostitute spirit on you
[2:07:03] he said our outward being her physical
[2:07:06] body or flesh
[2:07:07] she might be clean she might not commit
[2:07:09] any adultery or could swear to God that
[2:07:12] she never but he said her spirit is a
[2:07:14] prostitute spirit and she has been
[2:07:17] blinded by the god of this world blinded
[2:07:22] by world of fashion she dressed herself
[2:07:25] six sexy and got out there you better be
[2:07:29] careful yeah he said the other day said
[2:07:35] brother wood and I were putting our boat
[2:07:37] in the river and I was to get away from
[2:07:39] the house for a few minutes to go up to
[2:07:42] the river and wherever you went
[2:07:44] he's a women with these and I don't know
[2:07:47] what okay nice
[2:07:51] bikinis that's right brother I didn't
[2:07:53] want to say he caught it kidneys it was
[2:07:57] bikinis he said budget of bikinis or
[2:08:02] something either around them he said
[2:08:04] that's a disgrace he said a woman can't
[2:08:06] be in her right mind and put on anything
[2:08:08] like that she is possessed with a
[2:08:10] positive spirit and you settle that with
[2:08:12] God lady because you'll find out someday
[2:08:14] that that's the truth what would you say
[2:08:17] today if he would have seen see what
[2:08:20] he's seeing today what would he say what
[2:08:23] you and I are seeing because one time as
[2:08:27] I said even though women who wore wore
[2:08:29] slacks you know but they were they were
[2:08:31] normal and new with pant legs but now
[2:08:34] when they put on the slacks and these
[2:08:36] things today it is skin tight you know
[2:08:42] that is the influence of the god of this
[2:08:45] evil age when we're seeing politics and
[2:08:50] everything else is going on
[2:08:51] spiritually religiously you know even
[2:08:53] this was outside the message around the
[2:08:55] message it is the influence of the god
[2:08:57] of this evil age god help us and if
[2:09:02] there's anyone he's going to attack as
[2:09:04] he did in the Garden of Eden so it is a
[2:09:06] in the in Satan's Eden it's gonna be the
[2:09:09] sisters the woman and the women out
[2:09:11] there in the world and not only that
[2:09:14] I've noticed
[2:09:16] and sisters around the mission now are
[2:09:17] getting more and more like worldly the
[2:09:20] World'd women out there the way they act
[2:09:24] the way they dressed and so on
[2:09:27] oh yeah amazing where is God in
[2:09:37] simplicity how could you a lady knowing
[2:09:42] how sacred your body is and exposed that
[2:09:45] over there to these lustful sinful
[2:09:47] Devils that walk the streets of this day
[2:09:50] if sons of God were was all still sons
[2:09:53] of God your other was the son of God
[2:09:55] he'll either make you put on clothes or
[2:09:58] leave you
[2:09:59] and then he sister how many brothers to
[2:10:01] take nurse Dan if a boy was the son of
[2:10:07] God he never marries such a thing he
[2:10:10] said you I'm telling you the truth and
[2:10:12] someday he said you'll meet it naked
[2:10:17] adulteress don't know it he said I swear
[2:10:21] that I never trespassed the mouth of my
[2:10:24] husband oh yeah your husband will judge
[2:10:26] you for for it if you did
[2:10:28] but God will judge you by what kind of a
[2:10:31] spirit you got in you and not judge you
[2:10:34] by your body but by the spirit that
[2:10:36] inner part of you while spirit influence
[2:10:40] you to live this way do this talk this
[2:10:42] way act this way or dressed this way you
[2:10:45] know or even the way you have your hair
[2:10:47] as a sister yeah it's amazing the number
[2:10:55] of spirits that's influencing the
[2:10:57] sisters today
[2:11:04] I'll have to finish see how hard he's
[2:11:09] getting and he's preached in his own
[2:11:11] church yeah and he's gonna get harder
[2:11:17] and harder and harder and he
[2:11:21] acknowledges it he said it's hard and he
[2:11:26] brings in again about the brother that
[2:11:27] that come to him and told to stop
[2:11:29] preaching that he said brothers you're
[2:11:32] preaching that you're preaching to hurt
[2:11:34] you should preach this shouldn't preach
[2:11:37] that yeah they feel the same way to day
[2:11:39] but certain of the ministry they preach
[2:11:41] to her numbers nerd enough yeah why
[2:11:46] because I don't have to preaching
[2:11:48] preaching according to the will of God
[2:11:50] is going to bring separation separation
[2:11:52] separation greater and greater and
[2:11:54] greater separation and you just want you
[2:11:59] just want to get more and more more like
[2:12:01] God more and more closer to the Lord by
[2:12:03] the grace of God grace I'd love to stop
[2:12:10] here because maybe they see he's
[2:12:14] bringing out the two nature's in the
[2:12:17] human body there's a physical nature and
[2:12:20] there's a note inside nature he said the
[2:12:25] outside man is a physical being and he
[2:12:28] said see taste feel smell and hear and
[2:12:30] these are the inside of that spirit is a
[2:12:33] soul and it's controlled by one thing
[2:12:35] your free will and you can accept what
[2:12:39] the devil says or accept what God says
[2:12:41] and that will determine what spirit is
[2:12:44] in there if it's the Spirit of God it'll
[2:12:47] feed on the things of God and it won't
[2:12:49] feed on anything of the world brothers
[2:12:52] sister you won't allow what's going on
[2:12:54] out there to influence you because
[2:12:57] you're led by the Spirit the Holy Ghost
[2:12:59] out of your heart God in simplicity
[2:13:07] and he said that'll determine II said
[2:13:09] what spirit is in you you either accept
[2:13:11] what God says or what the devil says and
[2:13:14] he said the Spirit of God it'll feed on
[2:13:16] the if it's the Spirit of God it will
[2:13:18] feed on the things of God it won't feed
[2:13:21] on anything of the world and he said
[2:13:23] Jesus said if you love the world or the
[2:13:25] things of the world is because the love
[2:13:27] of God's not entered here to enter this
[2:13:31] inner part
[2:13:32] he's a Satan's deceive you amen
[2:13:37] never at any age did women ever act like
[2:13:40] that they do in this age that's the
[2:13:44] truth has God lost control or is he just
[2:13:50] permitting another agency to control I
[2:13:53] wonder the true answer to this question
[2:13:55] to my opinion there is two opposing
[2:13:58] spirits in the world today at work and
[2:14:00] he said now so there can't be not more
[2:14:03] than two two heads and one of them is
[2:14:06] the Holy Spirit and the other one is the
[2:14:08] spirit of the devil in the last days in
[2:14:12] deception now I said I'm going to base
[2:14:14] my thoughts right here on the rest of
[2:14:16] the text and he said the two spirits a
[2:14:20] man one of them God's Holy Spirit and
[2:14:23] the other one is the devil Spirit
[2:14:25] working in deception a man and the
[2:14:28] people of the earth are now making their
[2:14:31] choice and the Holy Spirit is air
[2:14:33] calling out a Bride of Christ and he's
[2:14:35] doing it by vindicating his word of
[2:14:38] promise to earth for this age showing
[2:14:41] that it is Christ and he said the age we
[2:14:45] are now living the Holy Spirit is here
[2:14:47] vindicating the message of the hour and
[2:14:49] the Holy Spirit is doing this and the
[2:14:52] people that believe God will be called
[2:14:54] out of this chaos and the Devils aren't
[2:14:57] only spirit is here calling his church
[2:14:59] by Herer as usual by perversion of the
[2:15:04] word of God like he did at the beginning
[2:15:06] see it's coming right back to that seed
[2:15:10] time again from Eden amen grace
[2:15:17] that will not believe that god of this
[2:15:19] world but believe the god the self
[2:15:22] existing one the God of creation the God
[2:15:25] of eternity for the glory of God rather
[2:15:28] stop there and continue Lord willing on
[2:15:31] Wednesday amen
[2:15:33] because I want to because again we never
[2:15:35] got into some of the even very very very
[2:15:37] hard things he's saying to the sisters
[2:15:41] add to the brothers amen and then maybe
[2:15:44] we'll move on into Satan's Eden by the
[2:15:48] grace of God so brother let's recognize
[2:15:51] what what we're doing where we are what
[2:15:54] we're dealing with please don't just
[2:15:56] ignore the devil well the devil would
[2:15:59] has the devil's influence - oh I ignored
[2:16:02] it yeah Satanist Satan to get you to do
[2:16:05] that but not exactly the way that that
[2:16:07] we need to do it let's listen to God
[2:16:10] judge everything by the word amen by the
[2:16:13] grace of God thank God god bless you
[2:16:16] listing oh my one o'clock let's say
