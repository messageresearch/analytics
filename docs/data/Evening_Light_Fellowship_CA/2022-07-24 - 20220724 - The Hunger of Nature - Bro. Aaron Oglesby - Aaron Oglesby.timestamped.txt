[50:29] always gone and um
[50:31] and brother chad collins and his family
[50:33] for opening up their home and and
[50:35] that's been an incredible blessing and
[50:38] if i forgot somebody just thank you all
[50:40] for being here and we we've been blessed
[50:42] i'm so grateful to be here with friends
[50:43] so thankful that i was able to do this
[50:45] trip with my wife
[50:47] and it has been just a wonderful time
[50:49] for us and i look forward to a wonderful
[50:50] time in the presence of the lord today
[50:53] if you have your bibles with you and
[50:55] you'd like to stand with me
[50:57] we're going to open to the book of
[50:58] proverbs
[51:00] uh 24th chapter proverbs 24
[51:03] and verse 30.
[51:06] amen isn't god good to us
[51:08] he is so wonderful to us i love
[51:11] what he said well i go about counting
[51:13] your blessings truly we should do that
[51:15] more often
[51:17] proverbs 24 and 30
[51:21] says i went by the field of the slothful
[51:25] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[51:27] understanding
[51:29] and lo it was all grown over with thorns
[51:32] and nettles had covered the face thereof
[51:35] and the stone wall thereof was broken
[51:38] down
[51:39] then i saw and considered it well
[51:42] i looked upon it and received
[51:44] instruction
[51:46] yet a little sleep a little slumber a
[51:49] little folding of the hands to sleep so
[51:51] shall thou poverty come as one that
[51:54] travaileth
[51:55] and thy want as an armed man
[51:59] also i want to look at galatians 5. if
[52:01] you'll turn with me there to galatians 5
[52:05] and 22
[52:10] and it says in verse 22 but the fruit of
[52:13] the spirit is love
[52:15] joy peace
[52:17] long suffering gentleness
[52:19] goodness
[52:20] faith
[52:21] meekness temperance
[52:23] against such there is no law
[52:26] and they that are christ have crucified
[52:28] the flesh with the affections and lust
[52:31] if we live in the spirit
[52:33] let us also walk
[52:35] in the spirit amen let's pray together
[52:38] our gracious heavenly father lord how we
[52:40] love you how we appreciate you lord your
[52:43] goodness and mercy lord that has been
[52:45] with us all the days of our lives
[52:47] lord we just want to give you praise
[52:48] this morning lord lord we just ask lord
[52:50] that as we begin to minister lord that
[52:52] you would just take take my body lord
[52:54] move it out of the way take my flesh and
[52:56] move it out of the way and allow your
[52:58] spirit to speak lord and just allow the
[53:00] word lord to fall lord on good ground as
[53:03] we said lord that you'll take control
[53:05] lord from this moment lord all the way
[53:07] through the end we already recognize
[53:08] your presence in our midst your word
[53:10] declares it and we thank you for that
[53:13] and we ask now lord that you'll just
[53:14] take control and speak to your people
[53:16] father in jesus name we pray amen amen
[53:20] you may have your seats
[53:23] hey man what a wonderful honor it is as
[53:25] i said to be here
[53:28] you know i believe as christians
[53:31] and and we are
[53:32] christians today i believe that we must
[53:35] always be progressing i don't believe
[53:38] that we can become comfortable where we
[53:40] are and become stagnant in our
[53:42] relationship with god but we are to
[53:44] always be progressing and in the world
[53:46] that we live in we can't take a moment
[53:48] to relax we can't relax because we live
[53:51] a life that is contrary to the flow of
[53:54] what the world is doing and where the
[53:56] world is going in other words we're
[53:58] going against the currents of the times
[54:01] we're going against the currents of this
[54:03] age and and if you've ever thrown
[54:05] anything into a river or a stream that
[54:07] didn't have the ability to fight against
[54:09] it it's going to go right where the
[54:10] current takes it and so in these times
[54:13] if we sit down and we relax and we
[54:14] become comfortable with where we're at
[54:16] what happens is you end up going with
[54:18] the current or going with the flow of
[54:21] society or the flow of the age so we
[54:23] must always be pushing hard against that
[54:25] current we must always be pushing hard
[54:28] and never relaxing in order for us to
[54:30] gain ground you're never going to gain
[54:32] ground in a battle by sitting back and
[54:34] doing nothing but you're going to have
[54:36] to take the battle to the enemy you're
[54:38] going to have to begin to push and
[54:39] you're going to have to begin to fight
[54:41] because we are to always be gaining
[54:43] ground and we're also to be producing
[54:46] fruit we are called to be a
[54:48] fruit-bearing people as christians we
[54:51] are supposed to have fruitful lives
[54:53] we're supposed to be have supposed to
[54:55] have lies that would produce the fruit
[54:57] of the spirit as it were lives that
[54:59] produce the fruits of the things that we
[55:02] claim that we have the fruits are the
[55:04] things that we claim to believe and i
[55:07] would say that more than anyone else on
[55:08] the face of the earth today we as a
[55:10] people who who have an uh a revealed
[55:13] word a book that is open we should have
[55:15] the ability to produce the fruits of the
[55:18] spirit people living lives on on half
[55:21] truths and seeing things through a glass
[55:23] darkly shouldn't be producing more
[55:26] fruits than the people who claim to be
[55:28] the bride of jesus christ we shouldn't
[55:30] have an issue producing a fruitful life
[55:33] in this day with what has been given to
[55:35] us
[55:36] so as individuals as we come to that and
[55:38] we look at that and we recognize the
[55:40] word is open um
[55:42] we've been restored back to a full word
[55:45] to a revealed word when we look at those
[55:47] things i want to ask you and ask myself
[55:49] even as we go into this
[55:51] what is it that hinders
[55:54] what keeps you from having the harvest
[55:56] that you should have or what is it that
[55:59] keeps you from reaching your maximum
[56:01] potential as a christian in this day
[56:04] okay what keeps you from being all that
[56:07] you can be in christ
[56:09] and not saying oh not that you're a
[56:11] sinner not not putting you on the
[56:13] outside not saying that you're not
[56:15] fighting but what keeps us from a more
[56:18] bountiful harvest
[56:20] he's called you to be fruitful he's
[56:22] given you something to do what keeps you
[56:24] from reaping a greater harvest
[56:27] brother branham says god bless you god
[56:29] bless you god bless you
[56:31] in the balcony is somebody up in the
[56:33] balcony would say brother branham i once
[56:36] had the victory
[56:38] i once was a godly person
[56:41] but somehow another the weeds and the
[56:44] thorns and things has choked me down
[56:48] somehow another the weeds and the thorns
[56:51] and things has choked
[56:53] me down now what what has happened to
[56:56] this person
[56:57] what has happened to their life this
[56:59] person says i once had the victory
[57:02] we're not talking about somebody who
[57:04] doesn't claim anything we're not talking
[57:06] about a ranked center this is someone
[57:08] who for a time could look at you and say
[57:10] i'm walking in victory i'm possessing
[57:12] what god has given me they had a
[57:14] victorious life for a time and they're
[57:17] saying but something has changed i once
[57:19] was a godly person
[57:21] now notice what he says has stolen away
[57:23] that victory the weeds and thorns in
[57:27] things has choked me down
[57:31] the weeds and thorns and things has
[57:34] choked me down now as we said christians
[57:37] are called to be fruitful
[57:39] we've been given every tool and
[57:41] everything that we would ever need every
[57:43] resource we would ever need in order to
[57:45] do that and we're instructed be fruitful
[57:48] these are the fruits of the spirit these
[57:50] are the things that you should be
[57:51] producing
[57:52] as a church you're called to be a
[57:54] fruitful church
[57:56] you're called not to just be dead not to
[57:58] just be living on on some past moves on
[58:01] some past glory
[58:03] on some past traditions
[58:05] but you're called to be a church that's
[58:07] bringing forth the same fruits as the
[58:09] very first church there in the book of
[58:11] acts
[58:12] because it's the same brother branham
[58:14] would say if it ever puts forth another
[58:15] branch it'll write another book of acts
[58:18] because it's off of that same vine so
[58:21] you're called to be fruitful brother
[58:23] branham said there in the ephesian age
[58:25] he said that the church at pentecost is
[58:26] the standard it is the pattern and god
[58:30] has not changed that pattern he says
[58:32] there is no other pattern
[58:36] so you're given a pattern and you see
[58:38] what's supposed to happen and you see
[58:40] the harvest that's supposed to come
[58:41] forth and you're called to be fruitful
[58:44] we're called to have fruitful homes
[58:47] we're called to have a to create an
[58:49] atmosphere that is right for the
[58:51] spiritual growth of the family
[58:53] where children can be nurtured where
[58:55] evils are kept out and where the token
[58:57] is applied
[58:59] and so many times we focus on taking
[59:01] care of the physical needs of our
[59:03] children and being providers and doing
[59:05] those things and god bless you we should
[59:06] do those things but in that home it is
[59:09] to be fruitful in spiritual things to
[59:12] nurture your children in spiritual
[59:14] things a place where the evils of the
[59:16] world are kept out so many times we want
[59:19] to keep kids away from well don't do
[59:20] that that's bad don't go there that's
[59:22] bad and then we turn around and allow
[59:24] things into our home that are just as
[59:26] evil or influence them in just a way
[59:28] we're so focused on don't go don't go
[59:31] don't go and let things in the home that
[59:33] have just as evil and influence but we
[59:36] can't have a fruitful home if we're
[59:38] allowing those influences into our home
[59:41] so we're called to have a spiritual
[59:43] church
[59:44] built on spiritual families
[59:47] which are built by spiritual leaders
[59:51] our lives to are to be set aside and
[59:53] dedicated to him in a way that his
[59:55] fruits can be brought forth through our
[59:58] lives
[1:00:00] amen not bearing forth my own fruits not
[1:00:03] seeing what i can produce not what i can
[1:00:06] be not living according to how i see fit
[1:00:09] or what i think brother brano meant
[1:00:10] right here
[1:00:12] be careful with your own interpretation
[1:00:14] and twist and your own seasoning as we
[1:00:16] would call it the lord delivered this
[1:00:18] message exactly the way he wanted it it
[1:00:20] was put before us the way he wanted we
[1:00:22] don't have to spice it up and season it
[1:00:24] to our taste
[1:00:25] you may you should feed on it enough to
[1:00:27] where that is your taste that is what
[1:00:29] you love that is what you want to ingest
[1:00:32] you don't have to change it to fit your
[1:00:34] liking change your liking to fit the
[1:00:36] word
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] so people like to say well it's my life
[1:00:42] it's my life actually it's not your life
[1:00:44] it's his life lent to you
[1:00:46] and he intends for it to be surrendered
[1:00:48] back to him for his purpose to bring
[1:00:50] forth his fruits here upon the earth
[1:00:53] he expects your life surrendered
[1:00:56] amen not conforming to the world and
[1:00:59] producing fruits of the world but living
[1:01:02] a life led by the spirit
[1:01:05] producing the fruits
[1:01:07] of the spirit
[1:01:09] so what hindereth
[1:01:11] amen in galatians we read that the fruit
[1:01:13] of the spirit is love
[1:01:15] joy peace
[1:01:17] longsuffering gentleness goodness
[1:01:20] faith meekness
[1:01:22] temperance which there means
[1:01:24] self-control
[1:01:26] no i'm not sure about you and your
[1:01:28] personal testimony some of you i haven't
[1:01:30] spent a ton of time around but i will
[1:01:32] openly admit i haven't maxed out all of
[1:01:34] these
[1:01:36] i haven't taken all of these and went
[1:01:38] yep got all that got all that got out
[1:01:41] i'm not there yet i'm willing to be
[1:01:43] honest i look at some of these and i go
[1:01:46] long suffering that means patience
[1:01:49] eh
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:57] i struggle having patience
[1:01:59] i used to think i was a very patient
[1:02:01] person but then 15 years in the public
[1:02:03] school system made me extremely
[1:02:05] unpatient impatient i think would be the
[1:02:06] proper way to say it
[1:02:08] either way my patience is messed up
[1:02:12] so i understand that i can look at these
[1:02:14] things and i can say there's things in
[1:02:16] here i can pick out way more than that
[1:02:18] that i need more of but you got to be
[1:02:20] willing to say god i recognize my lack i
[1:02:23] recognize those things aren't happening
[1:02:24] lord whatever it takes break me mold me
[1:02:27] move me to the place where i need to be
[1:02:29] where i can bring forth the fruits that
[1:02:30] you've called me to bring forth so i can
[1:02:33] be the christian that you've called me
[1:02:35] to be
[1:02:36] i know that my harvest could be more
[1:02:39] bountiful i know that i could be
[1:02:41] bringing forth more fruits of the spirit
[1:02:44] because a life fully surrendered to
[1:02:46] christ will bring forth his fruits
[1:02:49] and for us as christians
[1:02:52] it's not an option
[1:02:55] it is what the master expects of you
[1:02:59] he expects you to be bringing forth his
[1:03:01] fruits it's not an optional thing it's
[1:03:03] not something we just chalk up to
[1:03:05] personality well that brother he was
[1:03:07] just blessed with a meek personality and
[1:03:10] he's just blessed with patience listen
[1:03:12] when you get there on that day your
[1:03:13] excuses won't matter
[1:03:15] he's going to say i put you there on the
[1:03:16] earth to show the world what a human
[1:03:18] would be with my spirit living in them
[1:03:21] what it would produce with my spirit
[1:03:22] living out from them it doesn't matter
[1:03:24] what family you're from it doesn't
[1:03:26] matter we can't use those things as
[1:03:28] crutches anymore well my family just has
[1:03:30] temper problems we're called to be cycle
[1:03:33] breakers in this day we're called to
[1:03:35] show the world that the holy ghost will
[1:03:36] break the powers of the flesh the holy
[1:03:38] ghost will help you rise above family
[1:03:40] cycles
[1:03:42] the cycle of revival and death has never
[1:03:44] failed but there is a people in this day
[1:03:46] that will break that that cycle
[1:03:49] year after year you've seen revivals
[1:03:51] going to death revivals going to death
[1:03:53] you've seen people go a little bit and
[1:03:54] slide back but there is a people on the
[1:03:56] face of the earth today they're not
[1:03:58] going down into death they're not going
[1:04:00] back to a denomination but he's called
[1:04:03] them for a rapture he's called them to
[1:04:04] produce fruits he's caused them to
[1:04:06] overcome in this day and that's who
[1:04:08] we're called to be
[1:04:11] we can't just chalk these things up to
[1:04:12] personality
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:15] which surely your personality and plays
[1:04:17] a role in who you are
[1:04:23] surely it plays a part but that is flesh
[1:04:29] and although it will always war with you
[1:04:31] it is not to control you
[1:04:34] you hear all the time but my flesh is
[1:04:36] unconverted my flesh is unconverted
[1:04:38] there is truth in that this flesh is
[1:04:40] unconverted but greater is he that's in
[1:04:43] you than he that's in the world there is
[1:04:46] a holy ghost light that rises up on the
[1:04:48] inside of this flesh that controls this
[1:04:50] flesh says you're a son of god you turn
[1:04:52] your head from those things that's not
[1:04:54] what we feed on yes we're going to
[1:04:56] church yes we're going to worship yes
[1:04:58] we're going to overcome the inside man
[1:05:01] rises up and takes power over the flesh
[1:05:03] not vice versa not i sin because my
[1:05:06] flesh is unconverted i couldn't turn my
[1:05:08] head because my flesh is unconverted
[1:05:10] that's not how it works there is a token
[1:05:12] life on the inside of you that takes
[1:05:15] control of this flesh that subdues this
[1:05:17] flex and brings it subject to the word
[1:05:20] of god
[1:05:23] galatians 5 24 and they that are christ
[1:05:26] have crucified
[1:05:28] the flesh
[1:05:30] listen to life with the holy ghost
[1:05:32] living on the throne of it
[1:05:34] we'll have a battle as much as the next
[1:05:35] man
[1:05:37] he'll have struggles as much as the next
[1:05:39] man
[1:05:40] but that life will bear out victory
[1:05:43] that life will bear out fruits that man
[1:05:46] will walk after the spirit and not after
[1:05:48] the flesh
[1:05:49] and the fruits of the spirit will be
[1:05:51] evident
[1:05:53] listen all lives have seasons it's not
[1:05:55] that it's always mountain top mountain a
[1:05:57] matter of fact the mountaintops isn't
[1:05:59] where the fruit is grown
[1:06:02] all lives have seasons there's valleys
[1:06:04] there's mountains there's things you go
[1:06:05] through there's briar patches there's
[1:06:07] brambles
[1:06:08] there's troubles and there's hardships
[1:06:11] all lives have mountains and valleys and
[1:06:13] therefore you're going to have times
[1:06:14] where the harvest is great
[1:06:17] and other times where it seems as if
[1:06:19] it's such a struggle
[1:06:20] i'm going through such a hard time
[1:06:23] i'm struggling but even when it seems
[1:06:26] that you are not in a fruit growing
[1:06:27] season
[1:06:28] it is your responsibility to make sure
[1:06:30] that the ground stays prepared
[1:06:33] that you stay in a place that the walls
[1:06:36] of your estate stay fortified
[1:06:38] that the walls of protection around the
[1:06:41] garden stays up and strong not torn down
[1:06:44] and that you are in a condition to
[1:06:46] produce fruit so that your life is
[1:06:49] prepared to take that seed and nurture
[1:06:51] it and allow it to manifest exactly what
[1:06:54] god intended for it to manifest when he
[1:06:56] sent it by your way
[1:06:58] but if we're just sitting there in the
[1:06:59] mother grubs and i'm going through hard
[1:07:01] times and a seed of the word can come
[1:07:03] across the pulpit that is supposed to
[1:07:05] manifest a hundredfold in your life but
[1:07:07] the ground isn't prepared
[1:07:10] and you're not in a position to produce
[1:07:11] fruits because you haven't kept the
[1:07:13] ground prepared you haven't stayed on
[1:07:15] top of the situation and if you allowed
[1:07:17] you've allowed that season in your life
[1:07:20] to dictate your mood
[1:07:21] you've allowed that season in your life
[1:07:23] to dictate your worship you've allowed a
[1:07:26] season in a life to dictate your amount
[1:07:28] of overcoming but no sir whether it's a
[1:07:30] good season a bad season a good time or
[1:07:32] a hard time christians for the holy
[1:07:35] ghost press on with their head held high
[1:07:37] they worship anyway they push through
[1:07:39] anyway they overcome anyway they prepare
[1:07:43] to to produce the fruits of the spirit
[1:07:45] at all times
[1:07:47] good yes sir
[1:07:49] praise the lord
[1:07:50] it's not to say you never have issues
[1:07:53] it's not to say that bringing forth good
[1:07:55] fruit won't be a struggle at times
[1:07:58] that you're never going to have an
[1:08:00] argument or a disagreement
[1:08:07] except for me and my wife
[1:08:12] it's humanity
[1:08:15] struggles and hardships are gonna be
[1:08:17] there
[1:08:19] i won't say that you won't ever do
[1:08:21] something wrong
[1:08:23] goodness
[1:08:24] because
[1:08:26] nature
[1:08:28] is hungry
[1:08:31] and it wants to consume you
[1:08:35] and that's what we're going to speak on
[1:08:36] today is the hunger of nature
[1:08:40] the hunger of nature
[1:08:42] this beast nature is your enemy
[1:08:47] the way i like to say it is this you are
[1:08:50] not your friend
[1:08:53] this flesh as we said is unconverted
[1:08:58] and it will be a thorn in your side as
[1:08:59] long as you are here
[1:09:02] and it will try to fill your life with
[1:09:04] thorns and thistles to choke out the
[1:09:06] fruits that the spirit
[1:09:08] is supposed to bring forth in your life
[1:09:12] we know that originally adam and eve
[1:09:14] didn't have to deal with the sin nature
[1:09:16] when they were first placed in the
[1:09:17] garden
[1:09:19] but because of reasoning and eve
[1:09:21] stepping out from behind of her wall of
[1:09:24] protection
[1:09:25] the serpent was able to get in and cause
[1:09:27] eve to fall
[1:09:29] then mankind and all of the earth
[1:09:32] fell with adam and eve
[1:09:34] genesis 3 and 17 says and unto adam he
[1:09:37] said because thou has hearkened unto the
[1:09:39] voice of thy wife
[1:09:41] and has eaten of the tree of which i
[1:09:42] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[1:09:44] of it
[1:09:45] cursed is the ground for thy sake
[1:09:48] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:09:50] days of thy life
[1:09:52] thorns also and thistles shall it bring
[1:09:54] forth to thee and thou shall eat the
[1:09:56] herb of the field
[1:09:57] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:09:59] bread till thou return unto the ground
[1:10:02] for out of it was thou taken
[1:10:04] for dust thou art
[1:10:06] and unto dust
[1:10:08] thou shalt return
[1:10:10] so earth
[1:10:12] was cursed
[1:10:14] before this time
[1:10:15] adam had no trouble getting food
[1:10:18] he had no trouble finding food it was
[1:10:20] all produced and waiting and ready for
[1:10:22] him
[1:10:22] adam had no trouble bringing forth fruit
[1:10:25] he never had to work and he never had to
[1:10:27] sweat for anything
[1:10:29] in eden nature was not adam's enemy but
[1:10:33] it all worked in harmony together as god
[1:10:36] intended
[1:10:38] it had not been a war with him
[1:10:40] in the eden condition adam was in total
[1:10:43] control
[1:10:45] the weeds didn't try to take over
[1:10:48] the life of the flu
[1:10:49] fruit-bearing plants wasn't choked out
[1:10:51] by thorns and thistles
[1:10:54] adam operating from this place
[1:10:57] called eden
[1:10:58] he was told there in genesis 1 28 to
[1:11:01] subdue the earth
[1:11:02] so operating from this place god says
[1:11:05] subdue the earth in other words eden is
[1:11:07] to stretch from sea to sea expand it
[1:11:10] take more possess more make it all
[1:11:13] operate underneath your dominion go and
[1:11:16] subdue the earth
[1:11:18] but instead of fulfilling this
[1:11:19] commission what adam does is he falls
[1:11:22] and the earth that he was to control
[1:11:25] fell also
[1:11:27] and now a constant struggle begins
[1:11:30] cursed is the ground
[1:11:31] thorns and thistles shall it bring forth
[1:11:34] dust thou heart dust thou shalt return
[1:11:38] listen what are we talking about it's
[1:11:39] not just dust out here that's cursed
[1:11:42] it's not just gonna be difficult to
[1:11:44] bring forth fruits out in a garden
[1:11:47] but he's saying this earth is now cursed
[1:11:50] now it's gonna be difficult to bring
[1:11:52] forth the fruits that this life is
[1:11:54] intended to bring forth because earth
[1:11:56] has been cursed
[1:11:58] this nature is now against you this
[1:12:00] nature is now your enemy
[1:12:04] and now earth the cursed earth begins
[1:12:08] calling for the bodies that came out of
[1:12:10] it to return unto it
[1:12:13] this is where death sets in
[1:12:15] and now dust thou heart
[1:12:17] dust thou shalt return
[1:12:19] and the earth begins to call and it
[1:12:21] begins to draw your bodies back and as
[1:12:23] you get older you begin to stoop a
[1:12:25] little bit you begin to ache a little
[1:12:27] bit you begin to hurt a little bit
[1:12:29] sickness comes in
[1:12:31] nature always has a desire to reclaim
[1:12:35] what has been taken from it amen
[1:12:39] and so these bodies come from the earth
[1:12:41] and earth is calling it back you came
[1:12:43] from the earth and the earth is drawing
[1:12:46] you back into it
[1:12:48] that sounds uh dismal
[1:12:50] that sounds disappointing you came from
[1:12:52] the earth you're going back to it but
[1:12:54] don't you worry about it none little
[1:12:55] children even if you were to go by the
[1:12:57] way of the grave there is a resurrection
[1:13:00] that is the truth of the word there is a
[1:13:02] resurrection brother branham says over
[1:13:04] and over again even he says it's not
[1:13:06] even a replacement it is a resurrection
[1:13:08] this body that you're living in even if
[1:13:11] satan takes it by the way of the grave
[1:13:12] he does not win he does not possess it
[1:13:15] your body will not be annihilated he
[1:13:18] said these same 16 elements these same
[1:13:21] ones he says he will resurrect he said
[1:13:23] the same one that took dust that day and
[1:13:25] went and stepped into a body to come to
[1:13:28] abraham he said he'll come and he'll
[1:13:30] take a handful that day on the day of
[1:13:32] resurrection he'll go
[1:13:34] step into it he said it'll be that
[1:13:36] simple it'll be that simple this same
[1:13:38] body that i live in here i will dwell in
[1:13:41] there in an immortal condition in a
[1:13:44] glorified condition satan does not win
[1:13:47] no matter what a loved one goes down and
[1:13:50] death satan does not win no matter what
[1:13:53] our god has the final say
[1:13:56] yes sir
[1:13:57] brother brown says christianity believes
[1:13:59] in resurrection the whole thing's based
[1:14:02] on resurrection
[1:14:03] he says everything that death has did to
[1:14:06] you will be forgotten in the
[1:14:07] resurrection
[1:14:08] glory everything that death did all the
[1:14:11] decay everything will be forgotten when
[1:14:14] my god says
[1:14:15] step into it glorified once again
[1:14:18] hallelujah
[1:14:19] he said that's my father
[1:14:21] no matter what happens to this potassium
[1:14:23] calcium he knows right where it's laying
[1:14:27] i was standing before a glass not long
[1:14:29] ago combing these few hairs i got left
[1:14:31] my wife said to me said billy you're
[1:14:34] almost completely ball headed i said i
[1:14:36] haven't lost in one of them she said
[1:14:38] pray tell me where they're at
[1:14:40] i said i'll answer you when you answer
[1:14:43] me
[1:14:44] tell me where they were before i got
[1:14:46] them i'll tell you where they're waiting
[1:14:48] for me
[1:14:49] hallelujah this body will not be
[1:14:52] annihilated
[1:14:54] this earth brother brown talks about it
[1:14:56] he says god laid out everything on the
[1:14:58] earth before we even got here
[1:15:00] your body was here waiting on the time
[1:15:03] that you would arrive
[1:15:05] your body was already here he said it's
[1:15:07] like a contractor laying out his lumber
[1:15:10] he had it all laid out waiting for you
[1:15:12] here
[1:15:13] listen this body was god's first
[1:15:16] it never did belong to the devil it
[1:15:18] never was meant for sin it never was
[1:15:20] meant for sickness it never was meant to
[1:15:23] go down into death that's why we have a
[1:15:25] right to say satan get out this isn't
[1:15:27] your body this is god's body it may be
[1:15:30] it may be brought down by the curse but
[1:15:33] there's something on the inside of me
[1:15:34] being drawn back and i can subdue it and
[1:15:37] i can say sickness go death go sin go i
[1:15:41] have a right to do it because this body
[1:15:43] belonged to god first
[1:15:46] hallelujah
[1:15:47] no matter what satan does
[1:15:50] satan loses
[1:15:52] i'll rise again not in a replacement
[1:15:55] but in a resurrection
[1:15:59] brother brown says now if that's the
[1:16:00] kind of god we're serving
[1:16:02] if that's the omnipotence we're serving
[1:16:05] then what have we got to worry about
[1:16:07] sickness or death or sorrow or
[1:16:09] corruption or whatever more
[1:16:11] one of these days all these old atoms
[1:16:13] that's holding these bodies together is
[1:16:14] going to be broke away
[1:16:16] and we're going back to the dust
[1:16:20] and the lights going back and all the
[1:16:22] other parts of the earth is going back
[1:16:23] to its place but at the resurrection he
[1:16:26] will
[1:16:28] step into it and that'll be it yes sir
[1:16:31] isn't that wonderful
[1:16:33] amen i say it's wonderful today
[1:16:36] amen that even though there is a curse
[1:16:38] and there's a time element to these
[1:16:40] bodies satan doesn't win
[1:16:42] he doesn't when he doesn't even
[1:16:43] annihilate our bodies
[1:16:45] so many times we we focus on the soul as
[1:16:47] we should but we just want to let satan
[1:16:49] well i'm sick well i'm this tell him to
[1:16:52] go it wasn't his body to begin with it
[1:16:55] wasn't his to begin with god laid it out
[1:16:57] here on the earth before i ever even
[1:16:59] showed it before there was a fall before
[1:17:01] satan even rose up in heaven to rebel i
[1:17:03] was already here upon this earth
[1:17:08] but it is true
[1:17:10] that earth is drawing and pulling at
[1:17:12] these bodies
[1:17:15] seeing nature laid a claim on mankind
[1:17:18] right there at the fall
[1:17:20] and the earth became crowned in
[1:17:22] attributes of sin
[1:17:24] there's wickedness sickness and death
[1:17:27] thorns and thickets became a symbol
[1:17:30] of the curse
[1:17:33] how could one bring forth fruits
[1:17:36] in that condition
[1:17:38] how could someone bring forth fruits
[1:17:40] living
[1:17:41] in cursed earth
[1:17:44] how can you be required to overcome the
[1:17:47] curse walking around in a part of
[1:17:50] cursed earth
[1:17:52] and i'm thankful that god didn't just
[1:17:54] let adam and eve walk away that day
[1:17:56] without the promise of a redeemer
[1:17:58] brother brown says and then
[1:18:00] when i see adam as it was standing there
[1:18:02] and eve the beautiful stature of her
[1:18:05] and while she's standing there these old
[1:18:06] bloody sheepskins the blood running down
[1:18:09] her legs adam and this great fine
[1:18:11] stature of a man
[1:18:13] the blood of these sheepskins running
[1:18:15] down him standing there pronouncing
[1:18:17] death sorrow heartaches and destruction
[1:18:20] watch then i see put her lovely head
[1:18:23] over on adam's shoulder and him put his
[1:18:24] arms around her they started weeping
[1:18:27] turned around and started to walk out of
[1:18:29] his presence
[1:18:30] god depart from him
[1:18:32] he sinned there's your judgment
[1:18:35] then when i hear going down along the
[1:18:37] path through the garden of eden
[1:18:38] something like this
[1:18:41] what is it
[1:18:42] bloody sheepskins slapping on adam's leg
[1:18:45] as he went down
[1:18:46] then i could see all that great
[1:18:48] spaceless eternity come forming down
[1:18:50] like a funnel to form four little
[1:18:52] letters l o v
[1:18:55] e
[1:18:56] you know that's the part that satan
[1:18:57] never can't understand that's the part
[1:18:59] he never can wrap his little mind around
[1:19:01] is every time you struggle every time
[1:19:03] you fail every time you were out in the
[1:19:05] world wayward from god he said i got him
[1:19:07] he'll never forgive him he'll never
[1:19:09] accept him back and god said come on
[1:19:11] back little son come on back little
[1:19:13] child because satan can't comprehend
[1:19:15] love he thought i had him i've got him
[1:19:18] wrapped up i've got him bound down and
[1:19:20] then one day in one moment's time you're
[1:19:23] back in the presence of god forgiven
[1:19:25] with the robe of righteousness wrapped
[1:19:27] around your life how how l o v e
[1:19:32] satan can't comprehend that
[1:19:35] brother brother says he loved his
[1:19:36] children so much until he couldn't turn
[1:19:38] them away
[1:19:39] then i hear him say stop
[1:19:41] oh hallelujah i'll put enmity between
[1:19:44] thy seed in the serpent seed
[1:19:46] promising a redeemer
[1:19:48] god making preparation
[1:19:50] to redeem
[1:19:52] hallelujah
[1:19:54] what god gave in that moment was a
[1:19:56] substitute
[1:19:58] there in the garden he took the life of
[1:20:00] an innocent lamb
[1:20:02] and it covered their nakedness
[1:20:04] the shedding of that blood covered their
[1:20:06] sins
[1:20:07] but that blood didn't have the power to
[1:20:10] bring cursed earth subject
[1:20:14] it didn't have the power to bring the
[1:20:15] earth's subject it didn't have the power
[1:20:18] to subdue nature
[1:20:20] we see it there at mount moriah genesis
[1:20:23] 22 and 11
[1:20:25] and the angel of the lord called unto
[1:20:27] him out of heaven and said abraham
[1:20:28] abraham and he said here am i
[1:20:30] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[1:20:32] lad neither do anything unto him for now
[1:20:35] i know that thou fearest god
[1:20:37] seeing thou hast not withheld thy son
[1:20:39] that only son from me
[1:20:41] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:20:43] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:20:45] caught in a thicket by his horns
[1:20:48] and abraham went and took the ram and
[1:20:49] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:20:51] instead of his son
[1:20:54] what is this we know this is just a
[1:20:56] foreshadowing of christ to come
[1:20:58] but it was still a woolly lamb
[1:21:02] even though it is a foreshadowing of the
[1:21:04] great kinsmen redeemer it is still a
[1:21:06] woolly lamb
[1:21:07] the life of that lamb could not come
[1:21:10] back upon abraham
[1:21:12] it could not come in and subdue
[1:21:14] abraham's nature
[1:21:16] and and give him the power to live above
[1:21:18] sin nature it couldn't give man power to
[1:21:22] subdue this flesh
[1:21:24] so year after year even with that
[1:21:27] substitute man would have to come back
[1:21:28] in again and offer another
[1:21:30] come back in and offer another and yes
[1:21:32] the sin was covered but he would walk
[1:21:34] back out with the same habits he would
[1:21:36] walk back out with the same struggles he
[1:21:38] would walk back out with the same sins
[1:21:40] the same failures
[1:21:41] in the scripture we just looked at i
[1:21:43] want you to notice the thicket there the
[1:21:45] ram is caught
[1:21:47] in the thicket
[1:21:48] a thicket is made of thorns and a
[1:21:50] thicket is made of brambles if you're
[1:21:52] literally seeing the curse from genesis
[1:21:55] 3 18 represented here in this
[1:21:57] foreshadowing
[1:21:58] you're seeing the curse from genesis 3
[1:22:00] 18 and the thorns are upon the head of
[1:22:03] the ram showing that sin's curse would
[1:22:06] be upon his head
[1:22:08] notice when he goes to calvary what's on
[1:22:10] his head his sins curse the thorns and
[1:22:12] the curse from genesis 3 and 18 but the
[1:22:15] difference here in the two is in this
[1:22:17] moment it's the ram that is trapped by
[1:22:20] the thicket sin's curse still has power
[1:22:23] over a woolly lamb he's trapped he can't
[1:22:26] go anywhere yes it'll cover sins but
[1:22:28] it's not going to break free oh but it's
[1:22:30] just a foreshadowing of things to come
[1:22:32] what was it foreshadowing behold the
[1:22:34] lamb of god who takes away the sin of
[1:22:37] the earth when they put those thorns on
[1:22:39] his head jesus wasn't trapped he wasn't
[1:22:42] caught in a tangle but he took those
[1:22:44] thorns and he marched up calvary's hill
[1:22:46] and there he crushed sin's curse he
[1:22:48] broke the power of the curse right there
[1:22:52] and now because he wasn't trapped but
[1:22:55] the tables were turned and he carried
[1:22:57] sins curse up calvary
[1:22:59] because he isn't trapped
[1:23:01] now since curse is broken off of man
[1:23:04] now there is a power
[1:23:08] for you to be able to overcome
[1:23:11] the lamb takes those thorns to calvary
[1:23:12] and he crushes the curse and through his
[1:23:15] death and through his burial and through
[1:23:17] his resurrection and then the return of
[1:23:19] his holy spirit there on the day of
[1:23:21] pentecost now man has the power once
[1:23:24] again to subdue
[1:23:27] once again man has the power to subdue
[1:23:29] nature that has been ruling over him
[1:23:33] ever since the fall this has ruled man
[1:23:36] this has ruled man but now now that this
[1:23:39] lamb has come not a woolly lamb but the
[1:23:41] great kinsmen redeemer he's turned the
[1:23:43] tables and now this doesn't rule you but
[1:23:46] you have the power to rule over this
[1:23:49] hallelujah
[1:23:51] now there is a place
[1:23:53] inside of man
[1:23:55] that he can operate from
[1:23:57] in order to bring forth
[1:24:00] fruit
[1:24:02] now there is a place
[1:24:04] returned back to the eden
[1:24:07] condition
[1:24:08] once again
[1:24:10] not since genesis 1 28 had man been in
[1:24:13] the position
[1:24:15] to subdue nature
[1:24:18] back in 128 and god blessed them and god
[1:24:20] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[1:24:22] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[1:24:26] not since the time of fall has man
[1:24:28] stepped back into this place but now
[1:24:30] there is a portion of the inside man
[1:24:33] that is back in that condition and he
[1:24:35] says subdue the earth
[1:24:37] what the earth no subdue the earth
[1:24:40] subdue the earth take control of it take
[1:24:43] more take more press forward press
[1:24:45] forward overcome more cast down the
[1:24:47] flesh more subdue the earth be fruitful
[1:24:50] and multiply upon the face of the earth
[1:24:53] what happens when you are saved and
[1:24:55] filled with the holy ghost
[1:24:56] it takes a part of you
[1:24:59] back from fallen nature
[1:25:02] it takes a part of you back from the
[1:25:04] curse and puts it back in its original
[1:25:06] condition once again
[1:25:08] your soul
[1:25:10] is now ruled by the spirit
[1:25:13] a part of you is now beyond the control
[1:25:17] of the flesh
[1:25:19] and that part
[1:25:21] begins to rule
[1:25:23] over the flesh
[1:25:25] and then we get in behind the wall of
[1:25:26] the word
[1:25:27] and behind that wall we're safe behind
[1:25:30] that wall nothing can hurt us and behind
[1:25:32] that wall we produce fruits
[1:25:36] the wall keeps out the enemy the wall
[1:25:38] keeps out the wild beast the wall of his
[1:25:40] word and behind that wall we're growing
[1:25:42] and we're fruitful and the things that
[1:25:44] we're called to do are taking place
[1:25:46] there
[1:25:48] and sin nature once again
[1:25:50] is being ruled
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:55] and so now because of this change in
[1:25:57] your life when sin would rise up
[1:26:00] you have the power to put it down
[1:26:02] when sin is placed before you you have
[1:26:04] the power to rise above it and overcome
[1:26:06] it when temptation comes instead of it
[1:26:08] ruling over you and you falling to it
[1:26:10] now you rise above it and you conquer it
[1:26:12] because now you are no longer walking by
[1:26:15] the flesh you're no longer walking
[1:26:16] according to the curse but you are
[1:26:18] walking according to the spirit
[1:26:20] oh what a power that is what a place
[1:26:23] that is for a believer whereas before
[1:26:25] you couldn't now you can whereas before
[1:26:28] you would fall now you have the ability
[1:26:30] to stand what a place to stand as a
[1:26:32] redeemed blood boat blood washed sons
[1:26:34] and daughters of the living god filled
[1:26:36] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:38] you can't fail
[1:26:40] you can't fall oh yeah don't say that
[1:26:42] brother and i can't say that brother
[1:26:44] branham said this eve will not fall like
[1:26:46] the first eve dead he says she's
[1:26:48] predestinated not to fall
[1:26:51] what a place to stand what a place of
[1:26:53] empowerment knowing that you o god
[1:26:56] prepared a way that i can rule over the
[1:26:58] curse of the earth
[1:27:00] hallelujah
[1:27:02] once again earth is subject to a son of
[1:27:05] god
[1:27:08] and you were told
[1:27:10] subdue it
[1:27:12] take more
[1:27:14] control more
[1:27:15] overcome
[1:27:16] more hallelujah
[1:27:19] a place within you has returned to a
[1:27:21] condition of power
[1:27:23] an eden on the inside of cursed earth
[1:27:28] and the cursed earth around that eden
[1:27:31] now here's where we get into our title
[1:27:34] the cursed earth around that eden
[1:27:37] wants to take it back
[1:27:39] nature hungers
[1:27:41] to take back what was taken from it
[1:27:45] the cursed earth wants to subdue your
[1:27:48] place of eden
[1:27:49] it wants you to back off what you've
[1:27:51] claimed
[1:27:52] it wants you to back off and give back
[1:27:54] over to the desires of the flesh
[1:27:56] listen you don't have to back off one
[1:27:58] thing that god's promised you you don't
[1:28:00] have to back off with one thing it
[1:28:02] doesn't matter the doctor's report it
[1:28:03] doesn't matter what the devil says to
[1:28:05] you if god says you're healed you can
[1:28:07] stand right there on that it's yours god
[1:28:10] said i give you the baptism of the holy
[1:28:11] ghost you can stand there and lay claim
[1:28:13] to that promise you don't have to back
[1:28:15] off of it you don't have to back off one
[1:28:17] thing
[1:28:18] amen brother branham said that satan was
[1:28:20] stripped of every right he ever had that
[1:28:22] day on calvary and every redemptive
[1:28:24] promise is given back to the believer
[1:28:26] this morning stand there stand firm
[1:28:29] overcome rejoice in it be fruitful in it
[1:28:32] it's yours this morning church you can
[1:28:34] have all of it don't stop short don't
[1:28:36] settle for a little don't just strike
[1:28:38] two or three times be victorious
[1:28:41] overcome claim at all for you and your
[1:28:43] family
[1:28:44] hallelujah
[1:28:48] oh it wants to claim you it wants to
[1:28:50] take you back it wants you to back off
[1:28:52] but just like adam in the garden of eden
[1:28:54] you are told
[1:28:55] expand your dominion
[1:28:58] subdue
[1:28:59] subdue the flesh
[1:29:01] when the flesh doesn't want to worship
[1:29:03] my soul sings
[1:29:05] when the flesh says it's time to quit i
[1:29:08] can't quit i can't back down when the
[1:29:10] flesh says give up i can't give up
[1:29:12] there's a seed gene of god down on the
[1:29:14] inside of me and it's pulling me higher
[1:29:17] it's pulling me further something keeps
[1:29:19] holding me what is it it's not me i
[1:29:21] failed too many times i gave up too many
[1:29:24] times but when something down on the
[1:29:25] inside of me quickened that same gene of
[1:29:28] god there's no going back i can't go
[1:29:30] back there's nothing to go back to
[1:29:32] church
[1:29:33] hallelujah
[1:29:35] expand your
[1:29:36] dominion press the battle this morning
[1:29:40] overcome the world
[1:29:42] hallelujah
[1:29:44] walk in victory
[1:29:45] and bring forth fruit
[1:29:50] colossians 1 10
[1:29:53] that you might walk worthy
[1:29:55] of the lord unto all pleasing
[1:29:58] being fruitful
[1:29:59] in every good work
[1:30:02] increasing in the knowledge of god
[1:30:06] strengthening
[1:30:08] with all might according to his glorious
[1:30:10] power
[1:30:11] unto all patience
[1:30:13] and long-suffering
[1:30:14] with joyfulness
[1:30:17] brother brown says and the fruit of the
[1:30:18] spirit is love joy peace
[1:30:21] long suffering goodness gentleness
[1:30:23] patience meekness temperance
[1:30:26] fruits of the spirit
[1:30:28] god knows today
[1:30:30] that what the holiness people need
[1:30:32] and also the calvinist and all of them
[1:30:34] needs today
[1:30:36] is more fruits of the spirit
[1:30:39] more lives to prove it he says
[1:30:42] we've had many testimonies but as the
[1:30:45] old saying is
[1:30:47] your life speaks so loud i can't hear
[1:30:50] your voice
[1:30:52] we are written epistles of god
[1:30:54] read
[1:30:55] of all men
[1:30:58] even in this condition that i've spoke
[1:30:59] of where
[1:31:01] a part of you is returned to eden once
[1:31:02] again your soul
[1:31:06] even in these conditions we can go
[1:31:08] through dry times
[1:31:11] we can go through times where we
[1:31:12] ourselves maybe
[1:31:14] get just a little lacks and i'm not
[1:31:16] speaking of backsliding
[1:31:17] i'm just speaking of
[1:31:19] maybe fervency
[1:31:23] it's where we get a little relaxed
[1:31:25] go through dry times we find ourselves
[1:31:28] in a situation like the ones where
[1:31:30] brother branham was speaking to at the
[1:31:32] very beginning of our service
[1:31:34] where he says god bless you in the
[1:31:35] balcony
[1:31:37] if somebody up in the balcony would say
[1:31:38] brother branham i once had the victory
[1:31:41] i once was a godly person but somehow
[1:31:44] another the weeds and the thorns and the
[1:31:46] things has choked me down
[1:31:48] the curse
[1:31:50] has choked me down
[1:31:53] now look i'm not talking about going
[1:31:55] back into the world that's not what
[1:31:56] we're dealing with today
[1:31:58] i'm not even saying living a life with
[1:32:00] sin in it
[1:32:01] i'm talking about someone who finds that
[1:32:03] they don't have the victory quite like
[1:32:05] they once did
[1:32:08] that their joy just isn't full like it
[1:32:10] once was maybe little things are nagging
[1:32:13] at your life
[1:32:14] something is choking down the harvest so
[1:32:16] you just aren't bringing forth a harvest
[1:32:18] like the scripture would say to 30 60 or
[1:32:22] even a hundred fold
[1:32:24] maybe you're still harvesting the fruits
[1:32:25] but it's there should be more
[1:32:27] something's lacking lord i know there's
[1:32:29] more
[1:32:30] and what we have to realize is it
[1:32:31] doesn't take sinful things sinful things
[1:32:34] to rob you
[1:32:36] the bible says seeds were choked out by
[1:32:38] the cares of life
[1:32:42] guys the cares of life and my estimation
[1:32:46] just means the things that you have to
[1:32:48] take care of
[1:32:50] and sure there may be some other things
[1:32:51] mixed in there but going to work is a
[1:32:53] care of life
[1:32:54] paying the bills is a care of life
[1:32:56] providing for the family is a care of
[1:32:58] life these are things you have to take
[1:33:00] care of these aren't sinful things but
[1:33:02] if you allow them to come to the
[1:33:03] forefront if you allow them to become
[1:33:05] your focus if you begin to allow those
[1:33:07] things to choke out your joy and choke
[1:33:09] out your peace then your harvest gets
[1:33:12] robbed
[1:33:13] but regardless of why regardless of what
[1:33:15] it is
[1:33:16] if you find yourself in this place where
[1:33:18] you just aren't progressing forward the
[1:33:20] way you would like to
[1:33:22] i want to ask you a question
[1:33:24] so that we can reflect on ourselves so
[1:33:27] we can self-reflect for just a moment
[1:33:30] how up-to-date
[1:33:32] is your experience
[1:33:36] when is the last time you took another
[1:33:38] step with god
[1:33:39] now notice i'm not saying you've gone
[1:33:41] backwards
[1:33:42] how long have you been standing in the
[1:33:44] same place is what i'm asking you
[1:33:50] our experiences with god i believe it's
[1:33:52] very important for us to understand i
[1:33:54] believe most of us do but our
[1:33:56] experiences with god are not to be one
[1:33:57] and done
[1:33:59] it's not a one time thing
[1:34:01] yes you must have your upper room
[1:34:03] experience i believe that you must have
[1:34:06] your own backside of the desert burning
[1:34:08] bush experience just like moses had i
[1:34:10] believe that brother branham said that
[1:34:12] burning bush had what moses lacked i
[1:34:14] believe he has what you lack today
[1:34:17] i believe he has what i lack today he
[1:34:20] you must have those experiences there's
[1:34:22] no doubt but we also must remember that
[1:34:24] he is el shaddai the strength giver he
[1:34:27] is there with you all the time he is an
[1:34:29] ever present help in a time of need when
[1:34:32] is the last time you called out for more
[1:34:34] of god
[1:34:35] when is the last time you said lord i
[1:34:37] need a refilling of the baptism of the
[1:34:40] holy ghost i need you to pour it out in
[1:34:42] my life today i need more of you today
[1:34:45] thank you for what you did last time
[1:34:46] thank you for wednesday night thank you
[1:34:48] for sunday before but i'm standing here
[1:34:50] today lord in need of more of you in
[1:34:53] need of an outpouring in need of
[1:34:55] overcoming you i need more joy i need
[1:34:57] more peace i need more patience lord
[1:35:00] everything you have for me pour it out
[1:35:01] today lord i need more of you today
[1:35:04] father
[1:35:06] because we can't serve god on a memory
[1:35:09] we can't serve god on what he's done
[1:35:12] oh i love what god's done i believe we
[1:35:15] should testify of what god's done
[1:35:17] but i believe we lose the purpose of
[1:35:19] testimony many times
[1:35:21] it's not just so we know that god was
[1:35:23] powerful
[1:35:24] we tell testimonies of god's power so we
[1:35:27] can know what he'll do today so we know
[1:35:29] if he did it yesterday he'll do it today
[1:35:32] he healed yesterday he'll do it today he
[1:35:34] filled with the holy ghost yesterday he
[1:35:37] will do it today
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:41] i say if you come into dry places this
[1:35:43] morning take a drink
[1:35:45] he is el shaddain he's here for you take
[1:35:48] another drink this morning
[1:35:50] your experience is not to be a one-time
[1:35:52] thing
[1:35:53] he's calling you today to new heights
[1:35:56] he's calling you today to deeper depths
[1:35:58] there is more of god for you today
[1:36:02] he calls you two more
[1:36:04] but in order to get that you got to
[1:36:05] press forward
[1:36:07] you've got to subdue the curse you've
[1:36:10] got to operate from the dominion of that
[1:36:12] place that has been restored back
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:16] listen
[1:36:18] and not to get things twisted up i fully
[1:36:20] understand
[1:36:23] that once you have received the baptism
[1:36:25] of the holy ghost the bible teaches us
[1:36:26] you were sealed until the day of your
[1:36:27] redemption
[1:36:29] i'm not talking about you losing your
[1:36:30] salvation
[1:36:32] i'm saying become all that god has
[1:36:34] called you to be
[1:36:35] maximize everything he's called you to
[1:36:37] be
[1:36:38] he didn't restore this word and send a
[1:36:40] prophet in this day so we could barely
[1:36:41] make it
[1:36:42] no sir this word gives us overcoming
[1:36:44] power amen this book was open and i saw
[1:36:47] my name there and now what can stand
[1:36:48] before me what can hold me back what can
[1:36:51] keep me here nothing can keep me here
[1:36:54] i'm not gonna barely make it but i'm
[1:36:56] going in as a conqueror i'm going in as
[1:36:58] an overcomer because that's what we're
[1:37:00] called to do hallelujah
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] press the battle this morning to another
[1:37:08] outpouring
[1:37:09] seek for more
[1:37:11] walk to another milestone
[1:37:15] pray for more revelation
[1:37:17] brother branham would say you could
[1:37:19] never pray too much about revelation or
[1:37:22] to receive too much revelation
[1:37:24] you know one thing i i've said before
[1:37:26] that if you're always walking forward
[1:37:29] you will never point backward
[1:37:32] to a time you were greater in the lord
[1:37:35] than you are now
[1:37:37] to point backward to something you were
[1:37:39] is the testimony of a backslider
[1:37:41] if you were at a greater place with god
[1:37:43] a year ago then you are backslidden
[1:37:46] but if you're always walking with god
[1:37:48] and progressing with god then today
[1:37:50] you're at the greatest point the apex of
[1:37:53] your spiritual walk with god right now
[1:37:55] in this moment you don't have to point
[1:37:58] back you can say god is good today god
[1:38:00] is my savior today god is my healer
[1:38:02] today i am an overcomer today because he
[1:38:05] is a present god he is a living god and
[1:38:07] you have been fellowshipping with him in
[1:38:10] the moment
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:14] hallelujah
[1:38:16] if god has done something wonderful for
[1:38:18] you in your life don't stop there
[1:38:20] we praise god for that but you feed it
[1:38:23] you grow in it you be more tomorrow
[1:38:27] it's been many situations and many
[1:38:28] moments where i've
[1:38:30] been a part of where i see
[1:38:32] dealing with somebody in their life or
[1:38:34] praying with somebody at the altar
[1:38:37] where i see the holy ghost fall on
[1:38:38] people
[1:38:40] or discern hearts in ways that would
[1:38:42] blow your mind
[1:38:44] whatever the case may be
[1:38:47] but then within just a month or two or a
[1:38:49] year or whatever it is find that person
[1:38:52] right back in the same situation
[1:38:54] and you know god came down you were
[1:38:57] there when it happened
[1:38:58] you know what they experienced was a
[1:39:00] real touch of god you were there when it
[1:39:02] happened
[1:39:03] but what happens is that person thought
[1:39:06] that was it
[1:39:08] i've received it
[1:39:10] that's all there is instead of
[1:39:12] recognizing that was my start
[1:39:14] from here i press forward from here i
[1:39:17] feed it that was god showing me he loved
[1:39:19] me that was god speaking to me telling
[1:39:21] me i was his that was god moving on my
[1:39:23] heart now from here i'm gonna grow from
[1:39:25] here i'm going to put another log on the
[1:39:27] fire to here from here i'm going to seek
[1:39:29] another experience with god
[1:39:32] one of the greatest signs that i know of
[1:39:34] of a sold-out experience is an intense
[1:39:36] desire for more
[1:39:39] brother branham says now i'll give you
[1:39:42] my estimation of what i think the
[1:39:43] closest thing to an evidence that a man
[1:39:46] is a christian than anything i know of
[1:39:49] you know what it is it's travail of soul
[1:39:53] a person that's always so hungering and
[1:39:56] thirsting for god they just simply day
[1:39:59] and night they just can't stand it
[1:40:02] they need more they want to experience
[1:40:05] more they want to taste more if you've
[1:40:07] ever tasted it you want to taste more
[1:40:11] amen i i say if there is no desire in
[1:40:13] your heart to taste more i i doubt if
[1:40:16] you ever tasted it the first time
[1:40:19] if you ever get a little taste you're
[1:40:20] going to want more of that taste you're
[1:40:22] going to feed more on that you're going
[1:40:24] to want to pour in more of that into
[1:40:25] your body into your soul
[1:40:28] when you have an experience with god
[1:40:32] when you reclaim a portion of that
[1:40:34] fallen nature and you begin to subdue
[1:40:37] this flesh
[1:40:39] then the battle begins
[1:40:42] because nature will always try to take
[1:40:44] back
[1:40:46] what it has lost
[1:40:50] listen a person with the holy ghost is
[1:40:52] not going to go out and commit adultery
[1:40:57] a person with the holy ghost is not
[1:40:58] going to go out and and seek out and
[1:41:01] look at
[1:41:02] pornography a person with the holy ghost
[1:41:05] isn't going to go out and willfully sin
[1:41:08] can we all agree to that
[1:41:10] but don't think that there aren't going
[1:41:11] to be traps for you just because you
[1:41:13] have the holy ghost
[1:41:16] don't think there's not going to be
[1:41:17] attacks at you and probings and looking
[1:41:19] for your points of weakness and looking
[1:41:21] for ways to get you to stumble
[1:41:23] listen the devil's been studying man a
[1:41:25] long time
[1:41:26] you know we like to say things like dumb
[1:41:28] old devil and yeah he is dumbo devil
[1:41:31] but let me tell you what
[1:41:32] he knows you
[1:41:34] he knows your shortcomings and your
[1:41:36] weaknesses i know he knows mine because
[1:41:37] he likes to point them out all the time
[1:41:40] but this is why you must have an
[1:41:42] up-to-date and fresh experience
[1:41:44] you have to have the strength to keep
[1:41:46] pushing
[1:41:47] you have to keep subduing because the
[1:41:49] minute you sit down the minute you relax
[1:41:51] and the moment you take a break the
[1:41:53] weeds
[1:41:54] and the thorns
[1:41:55] and the thistles
[1:41:57] and the hunger of nature
[1:41:59] begins to creep in to what you have
[1:42:01] taken back
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] what do i mean by the hunger of nature
[1:42:07] what do i mean that nature will always
[1:42:09] try to reclaim what is taken from it
[1:42:11] brother if you'll give me
[1:42:15] the pictures up here
[1:42:18] i think
[1:42:22] i want to give you an example
[1:42:25] of the hunger
[1:42:27] of nature
[1:42:31] it's an escalator in a once extremely
[1:42:34] busy area that led to a mall
[1:42:38] the hundreds and thousands of people
[1:42:40] that rode this escalator through the
[1:42:41] years probably never envisioned this
[1:42:44] they never saw this
[1:42:46] it was well oiled it was working it was
[1:42:50] used it was beautiful it was set apart
[1:42:54] it was set aside for service
[1:42:57] but the moment that it quit being used
[1:43:00] and tended to and was neglected
[1:43:04] it almost looks like a jungle
[1:43:10] maybe
[1:43:14] thank you
[1:43:19] he said he made this dummy proof i knew
[1:43:21] we'd test that
[1:43:25] look at this house
[1:43:27] yeah i saw this
[1:43:29] it almost caused a little bit of
[1:43:30] melancholy to come over because i
[1:43:31] thought that house once experienced the
[1:43:33] pitter patter of
[1:43:35] new
[1:43:36] life feet running through the living
[1:43:38] room
[1:43:40] of holidays
[1:43:42] meals together
[1:43:43] supper as night fell
[1:43:45] they had carved out this this place and
[1:43:48] made it a home you know you can clear
[1:43:50] out a spot in the woods you can cut down
[1:43:53] all the trees you can clear a nice yard
[1:43:55] there you can build a house
[1:43:57] you can plant a nice garden
[1:44:00] and that place can be so full of so much
[1:44:02] life
[1:44:03] but you got to stay on top of it because
[1:44:06] nature is going to try to creep back in
[1:44:09] this weed pops up and you deal with it
[1:44:12] this thorn bush pops up and you deal
[1:44:13] with it
[1:44:14] but you stop taking care of that place
[1:44:16] for a minute
[1:44:18] listen i'm not exactly sure how it is up
[1:44:20] here from what i've been told i've been
[1:44:21] experiencing incredible weather that you
[1:44:24] know you don't usually get tons of this
[1:44:26] but back home during the growing season
[1:44:29] this is my yard after like three weeks
[1:44:33] at least it feels that way
[1:44:35] not the trees
[1:44:37] that'd take a minute
[1:44:39] but you stopped tending to something for
[1:44:41] a minute
[1:44:43] it's no longer an inhabitable place
[1:44:46] it's no longer a fruitful place
[1:44:49] it's no longer a place where the right
[1:44:51] type of life is abounding
[1:44:55] stop tending to it for one little bit
[1:44:57] stop reading your bible the way you're
[1:44:59] supposed to
[1:45:00] stop playing sermons as much as you used
[1:45:03] to
[1:45:04] stop praying and having prayer time and
[1:45:06] alone time as much as you used to
[1:45:08] and soon the weeds begin to move in
[1:45:10] amongst your grass
[1:45:11] stop working the garden the way you used
[1:45:13] to and keeping the weeds out and soon
[1:45:15] your harvest will not be what it once
[1:45:18] was
[1:45:23] an entire village
[1:45:25] reclaimed by nature
[1:45:30] nature's hungry
[1:45:33] the house is completely almost growing
[1:45:35] back into the hillside
[1:45:39] one person
[1:45:40] keeping it off
[1:45:42] one section of their house
[1:45:46] one person here in the midst of laodicea
[1:45:49] one person here in the midst of legacy
[1:45:51] of fighting back
[1:45:52] taking the sword keeping it off
[1:45:54] keeping it pushed back keeping it fought
[1:45:56] back
[1:45:57] i will have a place where the fruits of
[1:45:59] the spirit can come forth i will have a
[1:46:01] place cleared of all the of the curse i
[1:46:03] will not let the curse and the thorns
[1:46:05] and the thickets overtake my home and
[1:46:07] overtake my soul and overtake my life
[1:46:13] completely overtaken
[1:46:16] imagine what it would take to clear this
[1:46:18] away
[1:46:22] a lot more work than it would take to go
[1:46:24] deal with that weed that's sprouting up
[1:46:25] in your life
[1:46:29] you know a weed here and a weed there
[1:46:30] you can deal with it that's what you're
[1:46:31] called to do is deal with it
[1:46:33] but let it grow for a while don't deal
[1:46:36] with it don't tend to it
[1:46:38] and what do you have
[1:46:39] you have a place overgrown
[1:46:41] you have a place that you don't even
[1:46:42] know where to start
[1:46:44] but lord where do i start what do i do
[1:46:47] soon weeds begin to move in and choke
[1:46:50] out your harvest
[1:46:52] listen the weeds and the thorns and the
[1:46:54] curse that this earth is under will
[1:46:55] never stop trying
[1:46:58] because nature is hungry to consume and
[1:47:01] take back what it has lost
[1:47:04] but but pardon my
[1:47:06] little analogy here but you're the one
[1:47:09] that has all the roundup that's what we
[1:47:11] call the spray that kills the weeds back
[1:47:12] home i don't know what it's called here
[1:47:14] but you got the roundup
[1:47:16] you've got the lawnmower
[1:47:18] you've got the proper fertilizer you've
[1:47:21] got the weed and feed
[1:47:22] it's time to pour the weed and feed back
[1:47:24] on the lawn again it feeds the good and
[1:47:26] it kills the bad it feeds the spiritual
[1:47:28] man and it pushes the natural man down
[1:47:30] and says no boy you're not going to rise
[1:47:32] up here feed on the right things it'll
[1:47:34] take care of the weeds feed on the right
[1:47:36] things and it'll strengthen your harvest
[1:47:38] feed on the right things it's time to
[1:47:40] date no matter what condition you're in
[1:47:43] you may be getting all tangled up in
[1:47:44] complexes
[1:47:46] thorns and things tangling you up
[1:47:48] robbing your joy robbing your peace
[1:47:50] choking out your victory we've all been
[1:47:52] in places like that but it's not too
[1:47:54] late today to say i'm gonna take a stand
[1:47:57] and i'm gonna take the sword of the word
[1:47:59] and i'm gonna begin chopping at it lord
[1:48:01] i don't know where to start but i'm just
[1:48:03] going to start swinging the sword at the
[1:48:04] word against anything that's contrary to
[1:48:07] what you promised me i could have
[1:48:09] i'm going to cut back the thorns i'm
[1:48:11] going to cut back the weeds this is my
[1:48:14] portion of eating i'm claiming my
[1:48:16] portion you can't have it back
[1:48:19] not only that but i'm going to subdue
[1:48:21] more i'm going to take more i want more
[1:48:23] joy and i'm going to take it i want more
[1:48:25] peace and i'm going to take it i want
[1:48:27] more victory today lord and i'm going to
[1:48:29] take it
[1:48:30] i'm gonna take it today
[1:48:33] i'm gonna be an overcomer i'm called to
[1:48:35] be a fruitful christian
[1:48:38] i'm gonna subdue pride
[1:48:40] i'm gonna subdue my temper
[1:48:43] i'm gonna subdue selfishness and i'm
[1:48:45] going to do it by pouring in the
[1:48:47] nutrients of the word pouring in the
[1:48:49] nutrients of the spirit
[1:48:51] hey it's a fight church but i'm going to
[1:48:53] fight for more i'm going to claim more
[1:48:55] i'm going to subdue more because nature
[1:48:58] hungers
[1:48:59] but the spirit hungers as well which one
[1:49:02] are you going to feed i'm going to feed
[1:49:03] the spirit and i'm going to subdue
[1:49:05] nature i'm going to subdue the earth i'm
[1:49:07] going to rise above it
[1:49:09] because the spirit on the inside will
[1:49:11] also hunger and as long as that's what
[1:49:13] you're feeding it'll never end up like
[1:49:15] this
[1:49:17] the spirit man will continually subdue
[1:49:19] the flesh
[1:49:20] that's why we feed on spiritual food
[1:49:23] that's why your experience must be up to
[1:49:25] date
[1:49:26] because when it becomes stagnant
[1:49:28] that's when the weeds grow
[1:49:31] that's when the thorns come in
[1:49:33] listen you can't feed the natural all
[1:49:35] the time
[1:49:37] your diet can't be constant movies
[1:49:39] and worldly music and you going what
[1:49:41] happened to my harvest
[1:49:43] you sprayed poison on it that's what
[1:49:45] happened to it
[1:49:47] that's right
[1:49:48] but if your diet is the word
[1:49:50] if the nutrients that you're pouring
[1:49:52] into the ground
[1:49:56] is the right fertilizer
[1:49:58] then the ground will produce the right
[1:50:00] harvest
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:04] hallelujah
[1:50:06] thank you jesus
[1:50:09] oh my
[1:50:10] you're right there is no clock in here
[1:50:15] hallelujah
[1:50:18] maybe you've been noticing that the
[1:50:19] harvest hasn't been as plenty as it
[1:50:21] should be
[1:50:23] maybe the joy isn't there
[1:50:26] maybe your self-control isn't there the
[1:50:28] patience the kindness
[1:50:30] it's time to start examining your patch
[1:50:32] of ground
[1:50:34] time to examine it
[1:50:36] have you been tending your life the way
[1:50:38] you used to when you first fell in love
[1:50:39] with jesus
[1:50:41] checking up at all times
[1:50:43] watching vigilantly over the fruit
[1:50:45] making sure there was no weeds coming in
[1:50:48] making sure there was nothing there
[1:50:49] robbing the life from your harvest
[1:50:52] me and my wife we try to grow a few
[1:50:54] tomatoes
[1:50:57] and we don't even eat tomatoes
[1:51:00] but we do like salsa and so
[1:51:02] we grow tomatoes for that purpose
[1:51:04] and i haven't been doing it very long
[1:51:07] but one day i come out
[1:51:09] and like an entire
[1:51:10] top half of one of my bushes was just
[1:51:12] gone there was nothing there but stems
[1:51:17] look i'm not a gardener but that ain't
[1:51:19] right
[1:51:21] that's not how it's supposed to work
[1:51:23] and so you get to looking
[1:51:25] and sometimes you have to look really
[1:51:27] hard
[1:51:29] sometimes it's not just this obvious
[1:51:31] thing
[1:51:32] but there's this big
[1:51:34] giant green horn tomato worm
[1:51:38] and you think oh that'd be easy to find
[1:51:40] but he blends right in
[1:51:42] so many times
[1:51:44] the message has become such a lifestyle
[1:51:46] to us that you can blend right in and
[1:51:49] there's tomato worms all in your life
[1:51:51] eating up your harvest
[1:51:52] but nobody else can see it
[1:51:55] you've learned how to blend listen guys
[1:51:57] this
[1:51:58] this is supposed to be more than a
[1:51:59] lifestyle
[1:52:01] you know we're not here to bash anybody
[1:52:03] or talk down anybody but but we're not
[1:52:04] the amish in that this is our lifestyle
[1:52:08] this is a life you've been called to
[1:52:10] that you can only live truthfully with
[1:52:13] the holy ghost living on the inside of
[1:52:15] you overcoming through you
[1:52:17] and if it's just a lifestyle then then
[1:52:19] you're basically a make-believer
[1:52:22] you're pretending
[1:52:23] but sometimes you got to get down close
[1:52:25] and look and it's hard to spot and it's
[1:52:27] hard to find and one of the hardest
[1:52:28] things to do is to be honest with
[1:52:29] yourself it's easy to be honest about
[1:52:31] what's bothering other people
[1:52:33] they need jesus that prayer
[1:52:36] that's easy
[1:52:38] but sometimes can we be real with us
[1:52:41] can we be honest with ourselves it's
[1:52:43] amazing there's a certain honesty that
[1:52:45] you can't control that honesty that runs
[1:52:47] through your heart when you're laying
[1:52:48] there with your head on your pillow and
[1:52:49] you know
[1:52:51] but when it comes time to dealing with
[1:52:53] it you don't
[1:52:54] because you convince yourself that it's
[1:52:56] not that big a deal that little bitty
[1:52:58] green horn tomato worm will go from like
[1:53:00] that to like that overnight
[1:53:03] and they'll eat one leaf one day and
[1:53:04] it's not that big a deal and the next
[1:53:06] day your bush is gone
[1:53:07] your harvest is ruined
[1:53:10] instead of getting in there and finding
[1:53:11] what it is and dealing with it so that
[1:53:14] you can produce the harvest you were
[1:53:15] called to produce
[1:53:18] what is it that choked the life out of
[1:53:20] my harvest
[1:53:21] thorns and thistles cursed earth
[1:53:24] your flesh
[1:53:26] brother brown would say what we needs in
[1:53:28] old-fashioned scoring out digging out
[1:53:30] get those weeds out of the patch so the
[1:53:32] corn can grow jesus is coming all right
[1:53:35] that's what we need back to the old
[1:53:36] hewing line again back to the way god
[1:53:39] will come among us
[1:53:42] he says sometimes we have to go through
[1:53:43] terrible chastisement chastening of the
[1:53:46] lord many things to correct us that will
[1:53:48] be fruit bearing christians sometimes he
[1:53:51] has to prune us cut off take away take
[1:53:54] out our hands we think sometime oh god
[1:53:57] what are you doing to us but he knows
[1:53:59] what he's doing so we pray father that
[1:54:01] today you'll prune every one of us from
[1:54:04] the least to the greatest the pastor god
[1:54:07] we pray that you'll prune every one of
[1:54:09] us take away all that's unlike you
[1:54:11] father take away the thing that's
[1:54:13] hindering us from being fruit bearing
[1:54:16] christians
[1:54:19] matthew 21 19 and when he saw a fig tree
[1:54:21] in the way he came to it
[1:54:23] and found nothing there on but leaves
[1:54:25] only and said unto it let no fruit grow
[1:54:28] on thee henceforward forever
[1:54:30] and presently the fig tree withered
[1:54:32] away
[1:54:34] well what's that got to do with it
[1:54:35] brother aaron he expected that tree to
[1:54:37] bear fruit because that's what he put it
[1:54:38] there for
[1:54:40] don't let the master come walking by
[1:54:42] your way and find you not bearing the
[1:54:44] fruit that he put you there to bear
[1:54:47] finding he comes walking by and he finds
[1:54:50] the field overgrown like we found in
[1:54:52] proverbs
[1:54:53] finding the wall torn down
[1:54:56] seeing that nature has now taken the
[1:54:58] fruit
[1:54:59] this is back where we were at the
[1:55:00] beginning proverbs 24 31 and lo it was
[1:55:03] all grown over with thorns and nettles
[1:55:05] had covered the face thereof
[1:55:07] and the stonewall thereof was broken
[1:55:09] down
[1:55:11] then i saw
[1:55:12] and considered it well
[1:55:14] i looked upon it and received
[1:55:17] instruction
[1:55:18] listen this is solomon and he's
[1:55:20] strolling by
[1:55:22] and this man did not know that the king
[1:55:24] was walking by his field that day
[1:55:27] think about that for a moment
[1:55:29] he didn't know it was the day the king
[1:55:31] was going to come inspect his field
[1:55:33] that he was going to look and see as the
[1:55:35] tenant in the home doing what i asked
[1:55:36] him to do
[1:55:37] is the fence built properly
[1:55:40] is the field properly taken care of is
[1:55:41] he bearing fruit for me
[1:55:44] first thessalonians 5 1 but of the times
[1:55:46] and the seasons brethren you have no no
[1:55:48] need that i write unto you for
[1:55:50] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:55:51] of the lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:55:53] night
[1:55:54] mark 13 33 take ye heed watch and pray
[1:55:57] for you know not when the time is
[1:56:00] but what i'm asking you is is when that
[1:56:02] time is when the king comes is he going
[1:56:03] to find you bearing fruit
[1:56:05] or is he going to find nothing but
[1:56:07] symptoms of the curse
[1:56:10] excuses symptoms of the curse
[1:56:14] fall in nature reclaiming the field
[1:56:17] the wall of protection all broke down
[1:56:19] listen he gave us a wall that would
[1:56:21] completely protect us
[1:56:23] eve stepped out from behind it we must
[1:56:25] not
[1:56:25] he gave us a word he gave us the
[1:56:28] protection brother brown says we're
[1:56:30] fortified by the word of god and the
[1:56:31] devil knew that so he tried in the only
[1:56:34] the spy the devil was trying to find a
[1:56:36] way into that wall he might have tried
[1:56:39] pleasure he might have tried everything
[1:56:41] but you know where he got eve reasonings
[1:56:44] the bible said we should cast down
[1:56:46] reasoning faith does not reason is isn't
[1:56:49] it reasonable brother branham that the
[1:56:51] church is in a better state today than
[1:56:53] it was at azusa street or back in that
[1:56:55] time
[1:56:56] no sir they've got away from the word
[1:56:58] they've got away from from where they're
[1:57:01] shield the word is our protection and
[1:57:03] though people wouldn't dare to say they
[1:57:05] didn't believe it they claim it but
[1:57:07] their action speaks louder than their
[1:57:10] words
[1:57:14] we're going to begin to bring this down
[1:57:16] now i want to focus on this
[1:57:18] we are to be fruitful christians
[1:57:21] we are to tend the field we are supposed
[1:57:23] to take care of the wall and stay behind
[1:57:25] the wall that protects our field
[1:57:28] even if the field
[1:57:30] had been growing crops that solomon
[1:57:32] walked past
[1:57:34] they wouldn't ever come to harvest
[1:57:35] because the wall was torn down and the
[1:57:37] wild beasts would have come in and eaten
[1:57:38] up all the the fruits laying on the
[1:57:40] ground
[1:57:41] so even had he tended the field
[1:57:44] he had he had neglected the word
[1:57:47] he had neglected
[1:57:49] his protection he had allowed it to
[1:57:51] crumble
[1:57:53] and so what i'm saying today is you got
[1:57:54] to repair the gaps in the wall
[1:57:56] you got to build up the broken parts in
[1:57:59] your life
[1:58:00] accept correction from the word of god
[1:58:02] when it is coming your way
[1:58:04] accept that correction and allow the
[1:58:06] spirit to lead you and allow that word
[1:58:08] to be stacked stone upon stone upon
[1:58:11] stone to protect your harvest
[1:58:13] listen the stones are there the stones
[1:58:15] have been restored what you need to fix
[1:58:18] the wall and what you need for
[1:58:19] protection is there for you
[1:58:21] but you've got to allow god to place
[1:58:23] those stones in your life for solid
[1:58:25] fortification
[1:58:27] to protect from the beast
[1:58:29] to protect from the curse
[1:58:31] to protect the ground from that which
[1:58:33] would rob you
[1:58:36] and solomon says as he goes by i
[1:58:38] received instruction
[1:58:41] he immediately knows all he needs to
[1:58:43] know about this man is what he's saying
[1:58:46] i looked at his field
[1:58:48] and received all i needed to know about
[1:58:50] who this person was
[1:58:54] i received instruction
[1:58:56] because he hasn't repaired the wall
[1:58:58] and he hasn't tended his field
[1:59:01] i asked you this morning how's your

[1:59:16] fortified and it surrounds you and it's

[2:00:36] right
[2:00:38] brother branham says enforce it
[2:00:41] we are we have the privilege to enforce
[2:00:43] upon satan the claims that god gives us
[2:00:46] for god has a law and his word is a law
[2:00:48] and god in his word made certain claims
[2:00:50] to the church
[2:00:52] therefore we have a right to force these
[2:00:54] claims upon satan say give it back and
[2:00:56] he has to do it because we can take
[2:00:58] god's agent the holy spirit go right
[2:01:01] down on our knees and say it's thus
[2:01:02] saith the lord he's got to give it up

[2:01:07] there to make him do it the law of the
[2:01:09] land is to enforce it's by the land
[2:01:13] for the land

[2:01:57] they're out of their natural condition
[2:01:59] then we have a right to enforce our
[2:02:01] claim not our claim it's our claim
[2:02:03] because god gave it to us by his stripes
[2:02:06] we were healed he was wounded for our
[2:02:08] transgressions with his stripes we were
[2:02:10] healed now we have a right to enforce

[2:02:38] start looking down the old dusty road
[2:02:40] prepare for those to come back to the
[2:02:42] house of god
[2:02:44] sometimes we want to rejoice when we see
[2:02:45] the miracle i say prepare for the
[2:02:47] miracle
[2:02:48] sometimes we want to rejoice we say when
[2:02:51] i get healed i'll rejoice when i get
[2:02:53] this i'll rejoice sometimes your answer
[2:02:55] is on the other side of your rejoicing
[2:02:58] sometimes your answers on the other side
[2:03:00] of your praise praise your way through
[2:03:02] the storm produce fruits in the storm
[2:03:04] overcome in the storm
[2:03:08] yes sir
[2:03:09] amen
[2:03:11] proverbs 25 28. he that hath no rule
[2:03:15] over his own spirit
[2:03:17] is like a city that has broken down
[2:03:19] without walls
[2:03:22] see when the walls are broken down
[2:03:25] all that is good flows out
[2:03:28] and all that is evil
[2:03:30] flows in
[2:03:33] how is the wall around your soul this
[2:03:35] morning
[2:03:36] how's the wall around your children the
[2:03:38] wall around your home
[2:03:41] is it fruitful
[2:03:42] inside those walls
[2:03:44] listen the devil won't make it easy on
[2:03:46] you
[2:03:48] no
[2:03:49] as a matter of fact anytime we start
[2:03:51] having honest assessments of our lives
[2:03:53] it'll stir the devil up always because
[2:03:56] he wants you to be comfortable right
[2:03:58] where you are
[2:04:00] he wants you to be comfortable where
[2:04:02] you're sitting he wants you to be
[2:04:03] comfortable with half a harvest
[2:04:06] when there's so much more many times we
[2:04:07] don't even know what we're capable of
[2:04:09] producing because we've never done it
[2:04:10] we've never stepped out we've never
[2:04:11] surrendered everything
[2:04:13] many times we don't know what gift may
[2:04:15] be in our life we've never surrendered
[2:04:17] our life fully enough sanctified enough
[2:04:18] to where god can use a gift
[2:04:23] there's more for you
[2:04:24] amen there's more for you today
[2:04:28] he wants you comfortable though right
[2:04:30] where you're at
[2:04:31] right where you're sitting this morning
[2:04:36] he don't want you to rebuild the wall
[2:04:39] he doesn't want you to push back against
[2:04:41] the thorns and the brambles
[2:04:43] because those things are his access to
[2:04:46] your victory
[2:04:50] we're gonna end with this
[2:04:52] look when nehemiah went back to rebuild
[2:04:54] the wall around jerusalem
[2:04:59] it was recognizing
[2:05:00] that the wall needs to build back up so
[2:05:02] we can have our own harvest
[2:05:04] so we can establish what's rightfully
[2:05:06] ours
[2:05:07] so we can keep the enemy out
[2:05:10] and he goes back nehemiah 2 19. i'm
[2:05:13] going to read a good bit of scriptures
[2:05:14] here as we close
[2:05:15] it says but when sin ballot the hornite
[2:05:17] and tobiah the servant the ammonite and
[2:05:20] geshom the arabian heard it they laughed
[2:05:23] us to scorn
[2:05:25] and despised us and said what is this
[2:05:28] thing that you do will you rebel against
[2:05:31] the king
[2:05:32] you know what's amazing about this
[2:05:35] if you read nehemiah much and realize it
[2:05:37] was literally the king who had given him
[2:05:39] the commission to do this
[2:05:41] the king had commissioned him so many
[2:05:43] times you go to do things
[2:05:46] for the lord and the devil comes and he
[2:05:48] tries to point out why are you even
[2:05:49] trying to do this what's your purpose
[2:05:52] what are you doing you're trying to do
[2:05:53] this to build yourself up are you trying
[2:05:55] because i have a commission from the
[2:05:57] king
[2:05:58] i can cast you out because i have a
[2:05:59] commission from the king i can lay hands
[2:06:01] on the sick and they shall recover that
[2:06:03] goes for all of you because you have a
[2:06:06] commission from the king
[2:06:08] don't be afraid to exercise what the
[2:06:09] king has given you authority to do amen
[2:06:13] then answered them and said unto them
[2:06:15] the god of heaven he will prosper us
[2:06:18] therefore we his servants will arise and
[2:06:20] build
[2:06:21] i love this part but you have no portion
[2:06:25] nor right nor memorial in jerusalem he
[2:06:28] instantly sets them in their place why
[2:06:30] are you worried about it because you're
[2:06:31] not going to be coming in here anymore
[2:06:33] anyway you're not coming in my home to
[2:06:35] rob anymore you're not coming to take my
[2:06:37] joy you're not coming to pa take my
[2:06:39] peace you have no right in this church
[2:06:40] anymore why are you worried about the
[2:06:43] fact that we're building up the walls of
[2:06:45] the holy spirit around this home and
[2:06:46] around this church this is our portion
[2:06:49] this is our inheritance this is what god
[2:06:51] has called us to you have no rights to
[2:06:53] it you have no portion here
[2:06:57] notice the mocking and the jeering
[2:07:00] devil always tries to mock your progress
[2:07:02] i don't care if you took a tiny step
[2:07:04] today take a tiny step
[2:07:06] i don't care if you just crawled a
[2:07:08] little bit you crawl a little bit
[2:07:10] he tries to mock your progress
[2:07:12] and they act as if all that has happened
[2:07:15] to you
[2:07:17] is nothing
[2:07:18] but all the while what it is is they're
[2:07:20] seeing a wall go up
[2:07:22] and they're not liking what they're
[2:07:24] seeing
[2:07:25] and so they're trying to mock it and
[2:07:27] they know this wall is going to keep
[2:07:29] them out
[2:07:30] and so they try to keep you from
[2:07:32] building the wall
[2:07:34] and he says this how it's got to be
[2:07:35] because you don't belong here anyway
[2:07:37] it's not for you
[2:07:38] listen the beasts don't like it when you
[2:07:40] put a wall up around your garden that's
[2:07:42] right
[2:07:43] but remember that harvest is not their
[2:07:46] portion
[2:07:47] that harvest is not for them to partake
[2:07:49] of
[2:07:50] young people old people alike but
[2:07:52] especially young people whenever you
[2:07:54] start building
[2:07:56] and you have an experience and then this
[2:07:58] happens and then you and the devil will
[2:07:59] come go you didn't get anything
[2:08:02] that wasn't real you haven't done
[2:08:03] anything what would you really do maybe
[2:08:05] you got a little excited
[2:08:08] look at all the rest of this wall in
[2:08:09] your life that's torn down
[2:08:11] and what he likes to do is he'll take
[2:08:13] away from the portion that's been
[2:08:14] rebuilt
[2:08:15] and point to your struggles
[2:08:17] point to your failures i say point back
[2:08:20] and go that's okay this section was once
[2:08:23] looking like that as well but look today
[2:08:25] this section's rebuilt this section's
[2:08:27] strong and i move into that section and
[2:08:29] i'm moving to that section i'm gonna put
[2:08:31] stone upon stone and word upon word and
[2:08:33] i'm gonna allow myself to be fortified
[2:08:36] by the word listen it doesn't matter how
[2:08:38] little of the victory every victory
[2:08:40] matters
[2:08:41] every experience you have with god
[2:08:43] matters they were real they were
[2:08:45] important and the devil was just upset
[2:08:47] because he just saw another stone go on
[2:08:49] top and he goes that's just one more
[2:08:50] place i can't get in that's one more
[2:08:52] place i can't attack their family and so
[2:08:54] he tries to mock it and he tries to jeer
[2:08:57] chapter four verse one and it came to
[2:08:58] pass that when sam balot heard that we
[2:09:00] builded the wall he was wroth and took
[2:09:03] great indignation and mocked the jews
[2:09:05] and he spake before his brethren and the
[2:09:07] army of sumerians said what do these
[2:09:10] feeble jews will they fortify themselves
[2:09:13] will they sacrifice will they make an
[2:09:15] end in a day will they revive the stones
[2:09:18] out of the heaps of the rubbish which
[2:09:20] are burned
[2:09:21] i'll answer those questions for the
[2:09:22] devil today that's exactly what we're
[2:09:25] going to do we are going to fortify
[2:09:27] ourselves we are going to sacrifice unto
[2:09:29] the lord we are going to restore the
[2:09:31] walls that have been torn down that's
[2:09:32] what we're doing and we're gonna keep
[2:09:34] doing it until there's no access of the
[2:09:36] enemy into our lives to our souls are
[2:09:39] fortified our homes are fortified our
[2:09:41] souls our children each and every one
[2:09:44] are inside the walls of protection yes
[2:09:46] satan we are building the wall
[2:09:49] hallelujah
[2:09:50] now tobiah the ammonite was by him and
[2:09:53] said even that which they build if a fox
[2:09:56] go up
[2:09:57] he shall even break down their stone
[2:09:58] wall
[2:10:00] mocking the wall is so weak
[2:10:03] that if a fox were to bump into it it
[2:10:05] would fall over
[2:10:07] how many times oh you didn't get what
[2:10:08] you got last night
[2:10:10] you really thought the lord touched you
[2:10:13] you really thought that was any little
[2:10:15] devil brush up against it
[2:10:18] you know one thing i noticed teaching
[2:10:19] middle school
[2:10:21] is that bullies run their mouth
[2:10:24] because they really don't want to fight
[2:10:27] and so they try to talk you out of a
[2:10:28] fight by intimidation
[2:10:30] you think you want some of this you
[2:10:32] think you want this i'll do this to you
[2:10:34] i'll do that to you and i'm sorry maybe
[2:10:36] this is the southerner i don't know
[2:10:38] maybe y'all would like it too
[2:10:41] but you see so many times little kids
[2:10:42] get bullied and go into submission and
[2:10:44] you have to step in and be like you're
[2:10:46] not going to talk to them that way but
[2:10:47] really you didn't teach the bully a
[2:10:48] lesson
[2:10:49] one of my favorite things i ever saw was
[2:10:51] this bully with this little kid's arm
[2:10:53] twisting it and you're gonna do this and
[2:10:54] you're gonna find that little kid had
[2:10:55] enough and just said bam
[2:11:00] bully fell out and i'm like
[2:11:04] yes sir
[2:11:06] i'm telling you this morning the devil's
[2:11:08] gotta hold to your arm and the devil's
[2:11:10] twisting it and he's making fun of all
[2:11:12] that you've done and what god's done in
[2:11:13] your life and the wall is getting built
[2:11:15] up but he's bullying and he's bullying
[2:11:17] it's time some of us turn and take a
[2:11:19] little aggression out on him and give
[2:11:20] him one right to the face say i'm not
[2:11:22] going to tolerate it i'm not going to
[2:11:24] stand but i have a sword of the word i'm
[2:11:26] going to take it to your heart i'm going
[2:11:28] to quit arguing with you i'm going to
[2:11:29] quit talking to you about it but i'm
[2:11:31] going to cut down the enemy so that i
[2:11:33] can have a harvest so that my family can
[2:11:35] have joy and peace deal with the bully
[2:11:38] this morning deal with the one robbing
[2:11:40] your harvest deal with him one time put
[2:11:42] him in his place
[2:11:43] [Applause]
[2:11:50] hallelujah
[2:11:53] i'm trying to find where i was
[2:11:58] ah there it is
[2:11:59] verse seven
[2:12:00] but it came to pass that when sand
[2:12:02] balance obaya and the arabians and
[2:12:03] ammonites and the ashtonites heard that
[2:12:06] the walls of jerusalem were made up
[2:12:08] they actually finished the walls
[2:12:11] and that the breaches began to be
[2:12:13] stopped
[2:12:14] in other words their ability to get to
[2:12:16] you
[2:12:17] his ability to get into your home his
[2:12:20] ability to get into your life began to
[2:12:22] get stopped up the walls began to become
[2:12:24] repaired they were very rough
[2:12:27] and conspired all of them together to
[2:12:29] come and to fight against jerusalem and
[2:12:31] to hinder it
[2:12:33] notice when you go to repair things and
[2:12:34] get things right he's going to try to
[2:12:36] hinder you
[2:12:37] he's going to fight against you
[2:12:39] nevertheless we made our prayers unto
[2:12:41] god and set a watch against them day and
[2:12:43] night hallelujah because of them and
[2:12:45] judah said the strength of the bearers
[2:12:48] of burdens is decayed and there is much
[2:12:50] rubbish so that we are not able to build
[2:12:52] the wall and our adversary said they
[2:12:55] shall not know neither see till we come
[2:12:57] in the midst among them and slay them
[2:13:00] and cause the work to cease and it came
[2:13:02] to pass that when the jews which dealt
[2:13:04] dwelt by them came they said unto us ten
[2:13:07] times from all places which you shall
[2:13:09] return unto us they will be upon you
[2:13:12] therefore said i in the lower places
[2:13:14] behind the wall and on the higher places
[2:13:16] i even set the people after their
[2:13:18] families with their swords and their
[2:13:20] spears and their bows and i looked and
[2:13:23] rose up and said unto the nobles and to
[2:13:25] the rulers and to the rest of the people
[2:13:28] be not ye afraid of them remember the
[2:13:31] lord that's our cry this morning be not

[2:14:56] chance to check up
[2:14:58] better do it he says
[2:15:01] god expects fruits
[2:15:03] and when he comes i don't want him to
[2:15:04] find me like that fig tree
[2:15:07] just leaves
[2:15:08] just able to blend in look like any
[2:15:11] other tree but there's really no fruits
[2:15:12] there
[2:15:13] but he inspects it because he wants that
[2:15:15] fruit because it's for him
[2:15:18] and he comes to get some of that fruit
[2:15:20] and it's not there
[2:15:22] you can't stop today
[2:15:24] you've been called to subdue
[2:15:26] you've been called to conquer
[2:15:29] you're called to be fruitful
[2:15:31] sis you can just play something
[2:15:34] as we wind this down before we go to
[2:15:36] prayer
[2:15:38] yes the flesh is going to war against
[2:15:40] you
[2:15:42] nature is going to war against you the
[2:15:44] curse is going to war against you
[2:15:46] but greater is he
[2:15:48] that is within you
[2:15:50] and you're called today to subdue those
[2:15:52] things
[2:15:54] that portion of you that's been returned
[2:15:56] back to an eden condition we operate
[2:15:58] from there and we subdue the flesh
[2:16:00] we pull the flesh down
[2:16:02] we are to be ever subduing pushing back
[2:16:05] against the hunger of nature
[2:16:08] today i say it will not reclaim this
[2:16:10] land
[2:16:12] it will not reclaim this portion that
[2:16:14] god has given me
[2:16:16] yes the flesh is unconverted but there's
[2:16:18] a power on the inside of me subduing it
[2:16:20] pulling it down bringing it into
[2:16:22] subjection
[2:16:25] it's the last quote i want to read
[2:16:27] brother branham says that's the same way
[2:16:28] that an unbeliever or a sinner is ever
[2:16:32] laid in the presence of almighty god
[2:16:34] under the influence of the holy spirit
[2:16:36] he becomes a new creature right then
[2:16:39] his life becomes fruitful
[2:16:42] fresh
[2:16:43] life comes in and he yields what he was
[2:16:46] supposed to be
[2:16:47] a son of god
[2:16:49] he was took off the tree
[2:16:51] so was that olive branch he was took off
[2:16:54] of the tree but sinners and lukewarm
[2:16:56] church members become dry sticks
[2:16:59] with some kind of a memory that some
[2:17:02] time there was a supernatural god of the
[2:17:05] past that had life
[2:17:08] and way
[2:17:09] back there
[2:17:11] but if you believe and lay in his
[2:17:12] presence it'll produce the same thing to
[2:17:16] you
[2:17:17] you will realize that you were born sons
[2:17:20] and daughters of god
[2:17:22] and will yield the fruit
[2:17:24] of the spirit
[2:17:28] i want to be a fruit-bearing christian
[2:17:31] that's my desire this morning
[2:17:34] that's the desire of my heart lord
[2:17:35] whatever i wherever i am lord take me
[2:17:37] another step today let me push you
[2:17:39] against the currents of this age today
[2:17:41] let me push against what the world says
[2:17:43] is right let me fight for more ground
[2:17:45] let me subdue more of my greatest enemy
[2:17:48] let me bring this earth and this flesh
[2:17:50] that's been that's been cursed under
[2:17:52] subjection
[2:17:53] knowing that even one day there's been a
[2:17:55] claim not only on my soul but on this
[2:17:58] body he laid it out here and in the
[2:18:00] resurrection i'll get to living this
[2:18:01] body in a glorified condition in the
[2:18:04] eternities but to make sure i get there
[2:18:07] i want to be doing what he's called me
[2:18:08] to do
[2:18:09] i want to be producing
[2:18:11] what he's called me to produce
[2:18:15] we love you with the love of the lord we
[2:18:16] so appreciate you god bless you
[2:18:19] if there's any here that would desire

[2:34:00] amen
[2:34:02] amen i know we sang this recently but i
[2:34:04] want to sing it again i feel the lord
[2:34:06] wants us to sing it it's uh i'm no
[2:34:08] longer a slave to fear
[2:34:11] amen
[2:34:12] i really believe that by grace as
[2:34:14] believers as we get more and more of the
[2:34:15] holy ghost
[2:34:17] more and more of god that's our desire
[2:34:21] then we get the fire of the holy spirit
[2:34:23] it will burn away
[2:34:25] you know
[2:34:26] look at that pictures one of the things
[2:34:27] that stands out was the houses with the
[2:34:29] grass on it and the trees and everything
[2:34:30] else and i the thought that struck me
[2:34:32] was the only way that that can be
[2:34:34] cleared off is by fire
[2:34:36] burning
[2:34:37] [Music]
[2:34:39] and that's
[2:34:40] that analogy comes
[2:34:42] to us as well right i mean if if there's
[2:34:45] too much on us there's too much of those
[2:34:47] weeds on us
[2:34:48] that may the fire of the holy ghost burn
[2:34:50] it off
[2:34:51] and we need more of that holy ghost in
[2:34:53] order to burn it off
[2:34:55] don't let the devil give us the weeds of
[2:34:58] fear
[2:35:00] and all and all that he can give he got
[2:35:02] lots of tools but god god has
[2:35:05] given us greater tools
[2:35:07] amen
[2:35:08] we're children of god so we claim it we
[2:35:10] step forward and we believe that we we
[2:35:12] claim the promise we have needed and let
[2:35:14] the fire of god burn off the weeds
[2:35:17] amen let's sing it
[2:35:18] you have covered me
[2:35:23] with a melody
[2:35:27] you surround
