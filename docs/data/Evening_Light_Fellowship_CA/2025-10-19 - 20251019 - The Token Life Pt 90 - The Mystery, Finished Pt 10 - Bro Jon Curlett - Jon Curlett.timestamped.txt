[18:24] [Music]
[18:27] Our
[18:34] heavenly father
[18:36] once again we bow Lord to thank you for
[18:38] the opportunity to come into your house
[18:40] Lord that we might come aside from the
[18:42] things of the world Lord and Father by
[18:45] grace come to a place Lord that makes
[18:47] perfect sense Lord to be in your
[18:49] presence Father to hear your word Lord
[18:52] and to rejoice therein Lord as David
[18:55] said Father he rejoiced at your word as
[18:57] one who had found great spoil. And
[19:00] Father, that's the desire of our hearts,
[19:02] Lord, that we might just continue to
[19:04] rejoice in your word, Lord, and treat it
[19:06] as the greatest treasure, Lord, one
[19:08] could give. And Father, we just uh pray
[19:11] you'd forgive us of our sins, our
[19:13] mistakes, Lord, and all that we've done
[19:15] wrong, we please, under the blood of
[19:17] Jesus Christ. And ask, Lord, that you
[19:19] help us, Lord, to surrender, Father, to
[19:21] your will. As we just sang, Lord, we
[19:24] want to give ourselves away for the life
[19:26] of your children, Father, is one of
[19:29] surrender, Lord, to you. And Father, we
[19:31] don't want to surrender to the world,
[19:33] but Father, to surrender to your
[19:35] leadership and to your will, Father, in
[19:37] everything that we say and do that we
[19:38] might be a testimony of your grace and
[19:41] your presence, Lord. So bless us, we
[19:44] pray, Father, those needs that were
[19:46] mentioned this morning, Lord, there's
[19:48] much sickness, Father. There were many
[19:50] needs, Lord, and her sister with the job
[19:53] interview, Lord, and Father, the family,
[19:55] Lord, that lost a loved one, Father.
[19:57] We're just praying, Lord, your grace to
[19:59] be with each and every one as we lift up
[20:02] those that mourn. Father, those that are
[20:04] sick, Father, we know there's many needs
[20:06] in the body of Christ. But, Father,
[20:09] Lord, you're greater than all those
[20:10] needs. Your promises are yay and amen to
[20:13] all who will believe. So, Father, bless
[20:15] each one, Lord. Lift up the sick,
[20:17] Father, we pray. And Lord, let the
[20:20] promise of divine healing Lord be made
[20:22] manifest in each and every one. So be
[20:24] with us today Lord in the service. We
[20:26] ask your presence to be here from the
[20:28] pulpit to the door that brother John
[20:29] would come Lord under the anointing
[20:32] father and the of the sanctuary Lord
[20:34] where Lord each one is worshiping you
[20:36] Lord and Father by grace lift us up we
[20:39] pray in heavenly places. So bless
[20:41] brother John we pray. We bless the song
[20:43] leaders, Lord, and and Lord, the
[20:45] musicians, Father, as they do their
[20:47] part, Lord, to create the atmosphere
[20:49] that you'd be pleased to dwell in. So be
[20:51] with us, we pray, Lord, as we commit the
[20:53] service into your hands in Jesus
[20:55] Christ's name. Amen.

[29:31] [Music]
[29:46] Satan showed me
[29:49] the shiny things. Let me look the other
[29:55] way.

[30:02] hunt me down, draw me closer to you day
[30:08] by day.

[30:15] understand,

[35:42] I'll sing that when I don't have a
[35:44] number. Let your word be born of my
[35:46] heart.
[35:56] [Music]
[36:00] It was a tiny simple
[36:04] stable
[36:07] all be
[36:10] and worn. Let's stand.
[36:14] Huntly
[36:16] a place
[36:19] for a king to be born.
[36:24] He didn't choose
[36:27] something special
[36:31] to reveal his majesty.
[36:37] I know if I give him control,
[36:44] he'll be born in me.
[36:50] Let your
[36:52] word
[36:55] be born
[36:58] in the manger of my heart.
[37:04] Let it live in me.
[37:09] Let it start.
[37:13] [Laughter]
[37:15] Live inside this house of clay
[37:21] and mold it every day.
[37:27] Let your word be born
[37:32] in the manger
[37:36] of my
[37:40] life.
[37:42] Outwardly
[37:44] I'm nothing.
[37:47] Not much to behold.
[37:53] unlikely
[37:56] a place
[37:58] for his word to unfold.
[38:04] But if I just yield this vessel,
[38:10] just let him have his way
[38:16] from glory unto glory.
[38:22] You change me day by day.
[38:28] Let your word
[38:33] be born
[38:36] in the manger of my heart.
[38:43] Oh, let it live in me.
[38:47] Let it
[38:54] live inside his house of clean
[39:00] and mold it every day.
[39:06] that your word be born
[39:10] in the manger
[39:14] of my heart.
[39:20] Let your
[39:23] word
[39:25] be born
[39:28] in the manger of my heart.
[39:34] Let it live in me.
[39:38] Let it start.
[39:45] Live inside this house of clay. Got it.
[39:50] Lord have it every
[39:54] day.
[39:57] or let your word be born
[40:02] in the manger
[40:06] of my heart.
[40:11] I will leave. I'm nothing,
[40:16] not much to behold.
[40:22] unlikely
[40:25] a place
[40:28] for his word to unfold.
[40:33] But if I just heal this vessel,
[40:39] just let him have his way
[40:45] from glory
[40:47] to glory. I thank you, Lord. You change
[40:52] me day by day.
[40:57] God bless you.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Your word
[41:02] be born
[41:04] in the manger of my heart.
[41:11] Let it live in me.
[41:15] Let it start.
[41:21] Live inside this house of clay
[41:27] and mold it every day.
[41:34] Let your word be born
[41:39] in the manger
[41:42] of
[41:44] my heart.
[41:48] Well, outwardly
[41:50] I'm nothing,
[41:53] not much to behold.
[41:59] unlikely
[42:01] a place
[42:04] for his word to unfold.
[42:10] But if I just yield this vessel
[42:16] and let him have his way
[42:21] from glory unto glory.
[42:27] He'll change me day by day.
[42:33] Let your word
[42:38] be born
[42:41] in the manger of my heart.
[42:47] Let it live in me.
[42:52] Let it start.
[42:58] Live inside this house of clay
[43:04] and mold it every day.
[43:10] Let your word be born
[43:15] in the manger
[43:18] of my heart.
[43:24] Amen. Lord Jesus.
[43:27] Lord, that's our prayer,
[43:29] Lord. But it comes in recognizing one
[43:31] thing,
[43:33] Lord. It's got to be you and us that's
[43:34] doing it, Lord. We've got to be yielded
[43:37] vessels to the master's hand. Lord,
[43:40] filled by your spirit, motivated by your
[43:42] spirit, Lord, letting your word flow
[43:45] through us, Lord, that we could be your
[43:47] hands and feet, Lord, that we could be
[43:48] Christ to this world. Lord, I pray you
[43:51] help us to recognize every day it's not
[43:53] us that's doing it. It's Christ in us,
[43:55] Lord. It's your strength. It's your
[43:57] leadership. It's your provision. It's
[43:58] your gifts. Lord, it's your strength.
[44:02] Lord, it's your patience, your love,
[44:04] your peace, your rest, your joy that
[44:06] holds us day by day. Lord, I pray you
[44:09] help us to keep our eyes on you, Lord.
[44:12] Pray you help keep us, Lord, in the
[44:14] shelter of your wings, Lord, that we
[44:15] would know, Lord, where our strength and
[44:17] our help comes from, Lord. It comes from
[44:19] our Lord who made heaven and earth.
[44:21] Amen, Lord. So, we're trusting you again
[44:23] this morning, Lord. Draw us closer to
[44:26] you,
[44:27] Lord. Set our hearts on you, set our
[44:30] eyes on you, set our faith on you, Lord.
[44:33] Let us ignore all else Lord, but give
[44:34] you everything we have. Not just this
[44:36] morning, Lord, in this building, but
[44:38] Lord, when we walk out, may we give you
[44:40] everything there as well. We pray, Lord,
[44:42] touch your people, those that aren't
[44:43] here, Lord. Remember the Collins family,
[44:46] Lord, not feeling well this morning.
[44:47] Praying your grace to them. Lord, Sister
[44:49] Kimberly, I believe, is home as well
[44:51] with Wesley. Lord, praying your grace
[44:52] and strength, Lord, that you would touch
[44:54] him as well. Lord, bless us each one
[44:56] now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[44:58] ask it. Amen. Amen. Turn if you would to
[45:02] Romans chapter 8. this morning. Good to
[45:03] see each one that was able to make it.
[45:05] Good to see Nadine with us again this
[45:07] morning. God bless you. Amen. It's
[45:09] always good to see her. Amen. Enjoyed
[45:11] the special this morning. It was I I'm
[45:13] guessing it was meant for the special
[45:14] meetings, but uh that's okay. We can
[45:17] have a special meeting here this
[45:19] morning. Amen. So, sure enjoyed that.
[45:21] Make me desperate. Amen. Keep us
[45:23] desperate for that. You know, we can get
[45:25] caught up in so many things and get
[45:27] frustrated and flustered and and drawing
[45:30] after this and seeking after that. But
[45:31] boy, if we can just seek after God, that
[45:33] puts everything into perspective and it
[45:35] just keeps us anchored in the middle of
[45:36] the road where we ought to be. Amen.
[45:39] Romans chapter 8:14, very familiar
[45:42] scripture says, "For as many as are led
[45:44] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[45:46] of God. For ye have not received the
[45:49] spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye
[45:51] have received the spirit of adoption,
[45:54] whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The spirit
[45:57] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[45:59] that we are the children of God. Church,
[46:01] if you got the Holy Ghost, it'll point
[46:03] you to your position. It'll point you to
[46:06] your relationship to God. It'll point to
[46:08] you that you're a child of God. If
[46:09] you're having negative thoughts, if
[46:11] you're having negative feelings, if
[46:12] you're wondering and worrying, that
[46:14] ain't the Holy Ghost. Amen. It'll point
[46:16] you back to your relationship to God. He
[46:20] says, "And if we are children, then we
[46:21] are hes of God and joint hes with
[46:24] Christ. If so be that we suffer with him
[46:26] that we may also be glorified together."
[46:28] Church, this is what the Holy Spirit's
[46:30] supposed to be teaching us. That's what
[46:31] he's supposed to be reminding us to
[46:33] today. Who we are, what God has for us,
[46:35] what God intends for us. Why? Because
[46:38] when things come our way and it seems
[46:39] like it's evil, it seems like it's hard,
[46:41] it seems like it's not the thing that we
[46:42] would choose, we can say, "Hey, I'm a
[46:44] child of God. I'm a joint air." He's
[46:46] preparing me for something beyond what
[46:47] I've got here today. And what he has for
[46:49] me is far more important than what I'm
[46:51] worried about here in this world today.
[46:53] Why? He says, "So if so be that we
[46:55] suffer with him, that we may also may be
[46:58] also glorified together. For I reckon
[47:00] that the sufferings of this present time
[47:03] are not worthy to be compared with the
[47:05] glory which shall be revealed in us. For
[47:09] the earnest expectation of the creature
[47:11] of creation waiteth for the
[47:13] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[47:16] God bless you. You can have your seats
[47:18] this morning. We're still preaching on
[47:19] the Holy Ghost this morning. We're still
[47:21] preaching on the mystery finished. And
[47:23] we've been preaching on Christ having
[47:25] the preeminence in our life. And I
[47:27] believe this will sort of be the end of
[47:28] that. We've got just a little bit more
[47:30] to go in this before we finish it. But
[47:32] we spoke last service about how Christ
[47:35] having the preeminence is not lip
[47:36] service. Amen. It's not just saying the
[47:39] right things or repeating what the
[47:40] preacher says. Amen. We need to say the
[47:42] right thing, but it needs to come from
[47:44] the heart. Amen. It needs to be
[47:45] something that's on the inside of the
[47:47] inside. And we spoke last service on two
[47:49] very different people. And we started
[47:50] with the rich young ruler that came to
[47:52] Jesus and he came with haste and he had
[47:54] a real desire. And it seemed like he was
[47:56] desperate. And he came and he said,
[47:58] "Good master, what must I do to have
[48:01] eternal life?" And he gave Jesus his
[48:02] due. He gave him his recognition. He
[48:04] acknowledged his position. And he said,
[48:06] "Hey, how how do I get eternal life?"
[48:08] And he's saying all the right things.
[48:10] He's saying all the right things. Amen.
[48:12] But when the word got personal to him
[48:15] and it required a sacrifice, he said,
[48:17] "I'm sorry. I'm not interested." Jesus
[48:20] said, "What?" He says, "Take your your
[48:22] earthly treasure and give it to the poor
[48:25] and I'll give you treasures in heaven."
[48:27] And then he said, "Take up your cross
[48:28] and follow me." And know what he did,
[48:30] church? He said, "I'm sorry. I'm not
[48:32] interested." Why? because in his heart
[48:34] he didn't believe who Jesus was and
[48:36] therefore he couldn't believe Jesus'
[48:38] words and so he walked away and the
[48:40] scripture says he was grieved he went
[48:41] away with a storm cloud over him because
[48:44] he didn't get the answer he was looking
[48:45] for and he went away upset but then we
[48:49] preached on the widow of Zerapath in the
[48:51] days of Elijah she was a gentile woman
[48:53] and remember she was a single mother a
[48:55] widow she had her husband had died she
[48:57] had this young boy and she only had a
[48:59] little bit of flour and a little bit of
[49:01] oil left to make one little cake or one
[49:03] little loaf of bread and she'd been
[49:05] praying and praying and praying for God
[49:07] to send her an answer and know so the
[49:10] prophet Elijah being directed by the
[49:12] spirit of God comes to her and he says
[49:14] to her feed me your food
[49:19] church he's the answer to her prayer and
[49:22] he says feed me first make your cake but
[49:24] give it to me first and if you'll do
[49:26] that then the barrel of flour will not
[49:29] run run out and the the crews of oil
[49:32] will not run dry until the drought's
[49:34] over. But he says, "You've got to give
[49:36] me first place."
[49:38] Church, he wasn't doing that of his own
[49:40] accord. The spirit of God said, "Bring
[49:42] the answer to the widow woman, but she's
[49:44] got to give me the preeminence before I
[49:47] can answer her prayer." And what did she
[49:49] do, church? She obeyed the word of the
[49:52] prophet that came to her. She believed
[49:54] it was thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. And
[49:56] when she did that, she gave it to him
[49:59] and she went in and all of a sudden
[50:00] there was more flour and there was more
[50:02] oil and she made for herself and her
[50:04] son. And it says, "And many days
[50:05] afterwards they did eat." And the
[50:07] prophet stayed with her. He met her
[50:09] need, she met his need, and God was in
[50:12] their midst. And she survived all the
[50:14] way to the end of the drought just
[50:15] according to the word of the Lord. Not
[50:17] only that, church, but you'll see if you
[50:19] keep reading in First Kings 17, her son
[50:22] dies of sickness.
[50:24] The prophet's in the house. He's come
[50:26] and he saved her life. He's gave her the
[50:29] answer to her prayer. And then her son
[50:30] dies. And she says, "How how can this
[50:33] be? I fed you. I obeyed the word of God.
[50:35] And now God kills my son." And what does
[50:37] the prophet do? He goes in. He says,
[50:38] "Lord, what's this all about? Lord, why
[50:40] have you done this?" And what happened
[50:42] is God raised that boy up from the dead.
[50:44] See, her decision up front, that one
[50:47] decision, church, kept life in her home,
[50:51] when the next circumstance came along.
[50:53] God wasn't just preparing to feed her
[50:55] day by day. He was preparing to save her
[50:57] son from something that was coming down
[50:59] the road that she couldn't even see of.
[51:01] God had prepared an answer to a prayer
[51:03] she hadn't even prayed yet. That's the
[51:06] way God works, church. When we obey him,
[51:08] when we give him the preeminence, he
[51:10] prepares us for everything that's coming
[51:12] our way. He's got an answer for it.
[51:14] Amen. But notice, she had to believe and
[51:17] obey.
[51:19] To believe is to obey. That's the only
[51:21] way. They go hand in hand. They're one
[51:23] in the same thing. You cannot say I
[51:25] believe the word and then not obey the
[51:27] word. Amen. In the scriptures, in the
[51:29] Old Testament, I've said this before,
[51:31] they don't have that word obey. They
[51:32] just have believe and accept because
[51:34] that would it's inferred that if you do
[51:36] that, then you'll obey the word of God.
[51:38] Amen. You can't say I believe the word
[51:40] and then disobey it. That would be
[51:42] impossible. Listen to this. He says,
[51:44] "Now to be born of the flesh and have
[51:46] the wisdom of the world, the wisdom will
[51:48] obey its fleshly teacher."
[51:51] He says, "But to be born of the spirit
[51:53] is to believe and obey the teaching of
[51:56] the Bible by the Holy Ghost." He says,
[51:58] "And a man that's born of the spirit
[52:00] will obey God's word regardless of what
[52:02] any tradition tells him." I want to
[52:05] highlight that second portion. He says,
[52:06] "To believe and obey the teaching of the
[52:08] Bible by the Holy Ghost." Because there
[52:10] are plenty of people that are reading
[52:12] this Bible and they're obeying it, but
[52:14] they're obeying it by their own
[52:15] understanding, by their own filter, by
[52:17] the traditions of the day, by the social
[52:20] gospel that we have today. And they come
[52:22] out with their own understanding, and
[52:24] they do it in a way that makes sense to
[52:26] them, but it doesn't go according to the
[52:28] way that God intended Jesus. And it's
[52:30] not just people out there. It's it's
[52:32] people that are very sincere. You look
[52:34] at the priesthood, the religious leaders
[52:35] of the day, and when Jesus was there,
[52:37] and he rebuked them because they took it
[52:40] and they changed it into something that
[52:41] God never intended. Amen. I was thinking
[52:45] yesterday morning, I was just praying
[52:46] and dwelling on some things. And you
[52:48] know what? I came to I said, "Lord, it's
[52:50] only by your grace I can stand behind
[52:53] that pulpit and preach the truth of the
[52:55] gospel by your understanding and not
[52:57] mine." Because there's a church. I'm not
[53:00] up here preaching because I'm the
[53:02] world's most educated, the world's most
[53:03] studied, the world's most dedicated. I'm
[53:06] preaching because he's called me. But
[53:08] that doesn't make me effective. Amen.
[53:11] Church, I there are men that have
[53:12] studied all their life, given all their
[53:14] life, 50, 60, 70 years of ministry and
[53:18] studying this Bible sincerely, and they
[53:20] study and they study, and they get more
[53:22] and more education, and they pray, and
[53:24] they seek God. And when they come out
[53:26] from all of that, they preach that there
[53:28] is no divine healing. There's no gifts
[53:30] in the church. There's no true
[53:31] leadership of the Holy Spirit. God's not
[53:33] revealing truth still.
[53:36] What happened?
[53:39] They're led away by themselves. What's
[53:42] the difference between me and a man or a
[53:43] woman like that? Only one thing, church.
[53:47] God's grace to give me his spirit
[53:51] to lead me and to guide me. That's the
[53:54] only difference. I'll tell you this, and
[53:55] I've seen it time and time again, you
[53:57] don't have to look far to see this, that
[53:59] if a man stands behind a pulpit without
[54:02] the leadership of the Holy Spirit, it'll
[54:04] go two ways. It'll go towards money, or
[54:06] it'll go towards control. Well, he'll
[54:09] say and do things that force people to
[54:10] tie up to him, or else he'll go to
[54:13] expand it and make it a big money-making
[54:14] machine. That's what happens when men
[54:16] have unrivaled power behind the pulpit.
[54:19] But you see what happens when the Holy
[54:21] Spirit is not leading us to believe and
[54:24] obey. I heard a woman preacher, that's a
[54:26] that's a paradox in itself, but I heard
[54:28] a woman preacher say the other day, she
[54:29] said that the the the great commission
[54:32] is the source of colonialism and white
[54:34] privilege.
[54:35] That's what she got out of reading her
[54:37] Bible church.
[54:39] What nonsense. But what is it? In all
[54:42] her sincerity, that's all she can come
[54:43] up with because she's tied to the
[54:45] traditions of society today, not to the
[54:47] Holy Ghost. And that's what she came out
[54:49] of it. Amen. The difference is the Holy
[54:51] Ghost. Difference is not study. It's not
[54:53] all the time that we put in. It takes
[54:55] God to quicken these things. And what
[54:57] happens? What is that woman worshiping?
[54:58] What are these people worshiping?
[55:00] They're worshiping a God and a gospel of
[55:02] their own making. And it's no different
[55:03] than the golden calf that Israel made in
[55:05] the wilderness. This is the God that
[55:07] delivered us up out of Egypt. It's
[55:09] something of their own hands that
[55:10] they've made. But we want to close out
[55:12] this morning on this idea of Christ
[55:14] having the preeminence. not close on it
[55:16] forever, but just close out on it in a
[55:18] service. Amen. I believe that ought to
[55:20] be our story every day. Does Christ have
[55:21] the preeminence inside of our lives?
[55:23] Amen. But we preach that it is to have
[55:25] the preeminence is to be first, to be in
[55:27] first place, to have the top position.
[55:29] And Paul would say this, we've read it
[55:31] many times. I'll read it for the last
[55:32] time, Lord willing, for a while. He
[55:34] says, "For by him were all things
[55:36] created that are in heaven, that are in
[55:38] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[55:40] they be thrones or dominions or
[55:42] principalities or powers. All things are
[55:45] created by him and for him." It says,
[55:48] "And he is before all things, and by him
[55:50] all things consist." That word before is
[55:53] pro. The word is pro. The the original
[55:56] word there is pro. And we use that. What
[55:59] do we call pros? If we say, "Hey, I met
[56:01] a pro today. I bought a set of skates
[56:02] last night from a pro." real story.
[56:06] What are we talking about? We're talking
[56:07] about a professional. We're talking
[56:09] about an athlete. We're talking about
[56:11] somebody that's the best of the best. We
[56:13] call them pros. But here it says Jesus
[56:15] is pro. He's not just a pro. He is pro.
[56:20] He's before all things. Amen. He's the
[56:23] one that's in front of this. Amen. And
[56:25] then and he is first always. It says,
[56:27] "And he is the head of the body, the
[56:29] church, who is the beginning, the
[56:30] firstborn from the dead, that in how
[56:33] many things?
[56:35] All things he might have the
[56:37] preeminence." Church, that is not a work
[56:39] that he can do. That's the only work
[56:41] that we can do is we have to give
[56:44] ourselves, we have to yield ourselves to
[56:46] him that he would have the preeminence.
[56:48] What we have today is a a society that
[56:50] is built around people wanting their own
[56:53] preeminence.
[56:55] Everybody wants to have a voice.
[56:56] Everybody wants to be heard. Everyone
[56:58] wants to be recognized. Whether it's
[56:59] it's in politics, whether it's online,
[57:02] whether it's in work, whatever it might
[57:03] be. And everybody is about the I, me,
[57:05] and mine. It's the me monster that some
[57:08] of you know about. Amen. It's all about
[57:11] self. Amen. And it's just the nature of
[57:12] the world today that everybody wants to
[57:14] feel important. They want to feel like
[57:16] they have input. They want to feel like
[57:17] they have control, like they have
[57:18] influence. And what have we ended up
[57:20] with? We've ended up with a lot of
[57:22] bickering, a lot of fighting. And what
[57:23] we've got absolutely is polarization.
[57:26] where you're either right or left.
[57:28] You're either liberal or conservative.
[57:29] You're either Republican or Democrat.
[57:31] You're one thing or another and
[57:32] everybody's fit into boxes and everybody
[57:34] fights from within those boxes. Amen.
[57:37] And so it is we see what happens with
[57:39] social media in particular. It's
[57:41] empowered people to say and do whatever
[57:44] they want to do, usually without
[57:45] consequences.
[57:48] And what it has done is it has unleashed
[57:50] a look into the souls of mankind.
[57:54] When you go on social media, what you're
[57:55] seeing there is what people have always
[57:57] wanted to say and do, but never had the
[57:59] courage to do in person because they
[58:01] won't do it in courage and in person.
[58:02] The crazy thing, it's starting to bleed
[58:04] into reality now. And that's why we're
[58:06] seeing the insanity of the world and the
[58:08] things breaking down the way that they
[58:10] are. But Jesus would say this, and he's
[58:12] talking about the inside of a man. He
[58:14] says, "These things, those things which
[58:16] proceed out of the mouth come forth from
[58:18] the heart and they defile the man."
[58:20] Listen, when you're typing on your
[58:21] keyboard, that's still a mouth.
[58:24] Okay. He says, "For out of the heart
[58:26] proceed evil thoughts, murders,
[58:29] adulteries, fornications, thefts, fault
[58:31] whis, false witness, blasphemies. These
[58:34] are the things that defile a man." I'll
[58:36] tell you this, as a deacon, as a pastor,
[58:38] as a minister, the greatest insight I've
[58:40] gotten into a lot of people's life is
[58:42] taking a look at their social media
[58:43] accounts because there is something
[58:45] about being online that takes the
[58:48] filters off. It's like people stop
[58:51] thinking. It's like the Holy Ghost gets
[58:53] set aside.
[58:55] I've had brothers that I respected from
[58:58] a distance and when I saw what they did
[58:59] online, I lost total respect for them
[59:01] because it's like they lost the Holy
[59:02] Ghost whenever they got on there. What a
[59:04] shame. What a rebuke to us. But what is
[59:07] it? It's it's something about it brings
[59:09] out the innermost parts of people. And
[59:11] what I found is that the people that are
[59:13] on there the most are those that are the
[59:15] most poisonous and the least happy and
[59:17] usually the least genuine. Always. Not
[59:19] always, but usually. That's what I
[59:21] found. And I've been able to look into
[59:23] those things and and I'll watch it and
[59:24] sometimes I'll even let my wife in on
[59:26] her. I'll talk to the deacons or the
[59:28] pastors the time was and I'll say, "Hey,
[59:30] this is what I'm seeing. We need to be
[59:32] on the lookout for this." And it's crazy
[59:34] the things that I've been able to see on
[59:36] there because what you find is people
[59:38] that spend more time on there than
[59:40] anywhere else, they're living their
[59:42] lives on there. They've got more of a
[59:44] virtual life than they have a real life.
[59:46] And so they're on there trying to build
[59:47] themselves up into something that
[59:49] they're not. Amen. And I've seen
[59:51] heartbreak. I've seen infidelity. I've
[59:52] seen idolatry. I've seen people leave
[59:54] the church coming weeks, months, even
[59:56] years ahead of when it happened purely
[59:58] based on how people act on social media.
[1:00:00] It's an insight into what's on the
[1:00:02] inside of people because it pulls those
[1:00:04] filters away. You give somebody a
[1:00:06] platform to speak openly, church,
[1:00:08] eventually what's inside's going to come
[1:00:09] out. Absolutely it is. But what we see
[1:00:12] today is people that'll go online,
[1:00:14] they'll say anything, do anything,
[1:00:15] express anything. They'll be shameful,
[1:00:17] vindictive, they'll be rude, and they
[1:00:19] would never do those things in person.
[1:00:21] Absolutely none of them would. But what
[1:00:23] is it doing, church? It's giving them a
[1:00:25] way to express that inner voice, those
[1:00:28] inner thoughts, those inner desires that
[1:00:30] they've never been able to express in
[1:00:32] person. They just can't do those things.
[1:00:34] They've got something inside of them
[1:00:36] that's wanting to be expressed. And when
[1:00:38] somebody gives them a channel to express
[1:00:40] it, they jump into it. They jump into it
[1:00:42] like a pig to its wallow. Amen. And then
[1:00:45] what happens is some of them they get a
[1:00:47] following, they get a ministry, they get
[1:00:48] some influence and what do they do? They
[1:00:50] go more and more extreme
[1:00:53] and they build it into something and it
[1:00:55] leads to everybody to a road of
[1:00:57] destruction and it just implodes on
[1:00:58] itself usually. But church, I'm not here
[1:01:01] to talk about them. I'm here to talk
[1:01:03] about a people that have a different
[1:01:05] voice, that have a new voice, that have
[1:01:08] a new heart, that have a new spirit, and
[1:01:11] that's what speaks out of their lives.
[1:01:13] Amen. That's what the preeminence looks
[1:01:15] like. Amen. And they'll walk away from
[1:01:17] those sorts of things. You know, I I I
[1:01:19] like the way Brother Jason Watkins does
[1:01:21] it. He's on Facebook, but you know what
[1:01:23] he does is he posts his messages. He
[1:01:26] posts things that are edifying. And if
[1:01:28] people get on there and start to argue,
[1:01:30] you know what he does? He blocks them
[1:01:32] from his profile because he's not there
[1:01:34] to argue. He's not there to fight. He's
[1:01:37] just out there to present the gospel.
[1:01:40] And if you don't want it, go away. He's
[1:01:42] there to edify, not to fight, not to get
[1:01:45] into it, not to mix it up with people. I
[1:01:47] respect that. That's something. I'll say
[1:01:48] this. I've never seen anybody saved on
[1:01:50] Facebook. But we can be a witness, but
[1:01:53] make sure it doesn't turn it turn into
[1:01:55] something where we're just there to mix
[1:01:57] it up with people. We're not there to
[1:01:58] start fights, church. We're there to be
[1:02:00] a witness in all of these things that we
[1:02:02] do. Amen. And what is it? It's a people
[1:02:04] that'll live a real life off of social
[1:02:06] media rather than ones that will present
[1:02:08] it on on social media. Amen. It's a
[1:02:11] people that have come under the headship
[1:02:12] of Christ. And let me tell you, church,
[1:02:13] when you come under his headship, you
[1:02:15] lose your voice. You lose your mind. You
[1:02:18] lose your desires. You lose your
[1:02:20] influence. You lose all those things
[1:02:23] that's driving people to get on there
[1:02:25] and fight and tussle so much. Why?
[1:02:27] Because you've died out. You've been
[1:02:30] born again. That's why we don't get on
[1:02:32] there and do those things. Let me show
[1:02:34] you what it looks like when you come
[1:02:36] into a place of real headship. Amen.
[1:02:38] where you don't need to beat everyone,
[1:02:40] where you don't need to be the best of
[1:02:41] everything, where you don't need to get
[1:02:43] the last word. Anyone ever Anyone else
[1:02:46] struggle with getting the last word?
[1:02:48] Amen. Me and Brother Joe.
[1:02:51] We've got to learn to walk away. Winning
[1:02:54] the argument doesn't convert anybody.
[1:02:58] Remember what Paul said. I think it was
[1:02:59] to Felix. He said, "Paul, thou almost
[1:03:01] convinces me."
[1:03:03] You can't argue somebody into the
[1:03:05] kingdom of God. It takes a new birth to
[1:03:07] do it. Best way you can do that, show
[1:03:08] them what a new birth looks like. Amen.
[1:03:12] This is Revelation 22. This is this is
[1:03:15] the culmination of a of a a people that
[1:03:18] have died out and come under headship.
[1:03:20] This is a the the result of of a bride
[1:03:22] that has given Christ the preeminence.
[1:03:24] It says, "And the spirit and the bride
[1:03:26] say, come, and let him that heareth say,
[1:03:30] come, and let him that is a thirst come.
[1:03:34] And whosoever will, let him take the
[1:03:36] water of life freely. So what is the
[1:03:38] bride's voice? Come.
[1:03:41] It's an offer. It's an invitation.
[1:03:45] It's not a you stupid idiot. How could
[1:03:48] you believe that? Where do you get that
[1:03:50] in your Bible? No, it's come. Come and
[1:03:52] drink of eternal life. Come and drink
[1:03:54] from a water that will satisfy your
[1:03:56] thirst. Come and drink what's changed
[1:03:58] me. Come and drink what's made me come
[1:04:01] under this headship. come and drink
[1:04:03] what's changed my life so that Christ
[1:04:05] could be reflected inside of me. We're
[1:04:07] looking here and this is at the end of
[1:04:08] the cycle of time in the scripture. And
[1:04:11] we see one thing here and it's not new,
[1:04:13] but it's the culmination of the working
[1:04:15] of the Holy Spirit. And what is it? It
[1:04:17] is a bride and a and and a bridegroom
[1:04:20] that are saying the same thing.
[1:04:24] Church, in perfect headship, there's no
[1:04:26] contrariness.
[1:04:29] They're both saying the same thing.
[1:04:31] Amen. There's no willfulness from one or
[1:04:33] the other. Under proper headship, under
[1:04:35] preeminence, there's only yielding and
[1:04:37] surrender by the bride to her groom.
[1:04:40] That's the scriptural precedent. Amen.
[1:04:42] They're both saying the same thing.
[1:04:43] That's what the preeminence of Christ
[1:04:45] looks like in our life when we're saying
[1:04:47] the same thing he does. Now, don't just
[1:04:49] make it about speaking the same thing.
[1:04:51] Because remember, talk is cheap. That's
[1:04:53] what Israel had was their lips and their
[1:04:55] mouths were close to him, but their
[1:04:57] heart was far from them. Amen. We're not
[1:04:59] talking about speaking voices only. What
[1:05:01] we're talking about is lived voices.
[1:05:04] Amen. That's when we see that Christ has
[1:05:06] the preeminence. Amen. Not just when
[1:05:08] we're talking it, but when we're a
[1:05:09] living voice.
[1:05:11] Let me say it this way. If we are going
[1:05:14] to speak as the spirit would speak, that
[1:05:16] means our lives have to reflect what
[1:05:19] he's been saying to us first. Amen.
[1:05:21] We've got to have a life that's
[1:05:23] surrendered to the spirit. We're not
[1:05:24] just here to talk. We're here to walk
[1:05:26] the walk. That's what people see. That's
[1:05:29] what people judge now more than anything
[1:05:30] is do you live the way that you talk?
[1:05:33] And if you don't,
[1:05:36] maybe it's time to be quiet
[1:05:39] and sit back a bit and say, "Lord, help
[1:05:42] me to live it before I start talking
[1:05:44] again." Because people know a hypocrite.
[1:05:47] People know a hypocrite. Amen. We've met
[1:05:50] them. We know people. I I've got names
[1:05:52] in my head right now, unfortunately, of
[1:05:54] people that will go out and they'll go
[1:05:55] to their workplace and what do they do?
[1:05:57] They've got so much zeal. They go out
[1:05:59] and they start teaching this message and
[1:06:01] preaching this message. And what do they
[1:06:02] do? They're hitting people over the face
[1:06:04] with it. And they're trying to cram it
[1:06:06] down their throat and they're belittling
[1:06:07] what they have instead of building on
[1:06:09] what they have that might be truth. And
[1:06:11] what happens is people reject it. Why?
[1:06:14] Because their life doesn't match what
[1:06:15] they're saying. They're saying, "If that
[1:06:18] what you're saying makes me act like
[1:06:19] you, then I don't want it." Remember
[1:06:21] what Jesus said? He says, "Ye are the
[1:06:23] salt of the earth." He said, "And if the
[1:06:26] salt has lost its savor, if it's lost
[1:06:28] its flavor, if it's lost its ability to
[1:06:30] make things better,"
[1:06:32] he said, then it's only good to be
[1:06:34] trotten underfoot. And if our it's our
[1:06:36] life that is the flavor that draws
[1:06:38] people when people see our joy, our
[1:06:41] happiness, our rest, our contentment,
[1:06:45] our ability to take an offense
[1:06:48] and walk away and not hold it against a
[1:06:50] person. That's what draws people to us.
[1:06:53] It's not just the words that we speak.
[1:06:55] Amen. It's got to be that that that life
[1:06:57] of Christ inside of us that they see,
[1:06:59] not just a a message or a word that we
[1:07:02] can preach to them. Listen to what he
[1:07:04] says here. He says, "Now, everyone can't
[1:07:06] be a preacher, but you've got a voice."
[1:07:08] He said, "And if you can't preach the
[1:07:10] people a sermon, if you're a preacher,
[1:07:12] you're called to the pulpit to preach.
[1:07:14] If you're not, you're still a preacher,
[1:07:16] but live the people a sermon. Let your
[1:07:18] sermon be lived." And it's the voice of
[1:07:22] God that will bring reproach to them who
[1:07:25] reject it. That also means it will be
[1:07:28] what? The voice of salvation to those
[1:07:31] that will accept it. What is God's voice
[1:07:33] in you and I? Your life. That's what
[1:07:37] he's talking about here. You say,
[1:07:38] "Brother John, do we have a work to do,
[1:07:40] church? We're the last voice. We're the
[1:07:42] last message to this age." And it's your
[1:07:44] life.
[1:07:46] You can draw somebody to salvation or
[1:07:49] push them to judgment purely based on
[1:07:51] the life that you live.
[1:07:54] He said, "If you're not a preacher,
[1:07:55] you're still a preacher, but live the
[1:07:57] people a sermon. Let your sermon be
[1:07:59] lived. It's the voice of God that'll
[1:08:00] bring reproach to them who reject it.
[1:08:02] They say, "No one can put a finger on
[1:08:04] his or her life." They're sweet and
[1:08:06] living. If there ever was a man of God,
[1:08:09] it's that man or that woman. I say,
[1:08:12] "Lord, help me to have that testimony
[1:08:13] day by day that people could say,
[1:08:15] "There's a real Christian." Not just
[1:08:18] because he talks it, but because he
[1:08:20] walks it. He says, "See, live your
[1:08:22] sermons. Don't try to preach them if
[1:08:24] you're not called to be a preacher. you
[1:08:26] get all mixed up anyhow and messed up
[1:08:28] and you'll get people tangled up and you
[1:08:30] won't know. He says, "Well, you'll ruin
[1:08:32] them and yourself, too." What did he say
[1:08:34] elsewhere? He said, "Tell people what
[1:08:35] God has done for you. Give them your
[1:08:37] testimony. Tell them what you used to be
[1:08:39] and let him compare to what you are now.
[1:08:42] And if they have more questions, say,
[1:08:43] "Come and see a man. Come to church.
[1:08:47] Come and hear a sermon. Come talk to a
[1:08:49] minister. He'll answer your questions
[1:08:50] for you."
[1:08:52] He said, "Just live your sermon. The
[1:08:55] preacher's called to preach his and to
[1:08:56] live it, too. And if you can't live it,
[1:08:58] then you stop preaching. But you're
[1:09:00] supposed to live your sermons. He says,
[1:09:02] "All right, but here were voices." He's
[1:09:04] preach preaching out of Revelation
[1:09:06] chapter 4. He says, "Oh, how we need
[1:09:09] thousands of
[1:09:12] lived voices."
[1:09:14] I have this written in my Bible on the
[1:09:16] leaf. This is one of the greatest quotes
[1:09:19] you'll ever read. Lived voices. the
[1:09:22] thunder of God.
[1:09:25] You know, most of us have seen that that
[1:09:28] that movie series, The Chosen, and where
[1:09:30] you have the Sons of Thunder. You know
[1:09:33] that scene where they said, "Lord, these
[1:09:34] people, you know, they've offended us.
[1:09:37] Shall we call down thunder and lightning
[1:09:39] out of heaven?" He calls them sons of
[1:09:41] thunder there. I thought it was a great
[1:09:42] way to attach that to them, you know,
[1:09:44] but that's what we think so many times
[1:09:47] is is the thunder of God is the signs
[1:09:50] and the wonders and the laying out of
[1:09:52] hands and the casting out of demons and
[1:09:54] the deliverance and all these things.
[1:09:56] But he says, "Your lived voice is the
[1:09:58] thunder of God."
[1:10:00] The thunder of God thundering out in
[1:10:03] what? Power and authority.
[1:10:07] No, in sweetness and holiness,
[1:10:12] purity, undefiled lives, walking around
[1:10:16] in the earth today without a blemish. He
[1:10:18] says, "Yes, sir, real Christians, that's
[1:10:21] thunder against the enemy." The devil
[1:10:23] doesn't care how loud you can holler.
[1:10:25] The devil doesn't care how much you can
[1:10:27] jump or how much you can do this or
[1:10:28] shout. So, what does he care about? What
[1:10:32] makes the devil anxious,
[1:10:35] church? Isn't that his job is to torment
[1:10:37] us and make us anxious? How many of us
[1:10:40] would like to make the devil anxious?
[1:10:42] How many would like him to be nervous
[1:10:44] when he has to be sent your way? I've
[1:10:47] said it before. I'd like to make Satan's
[1:10:49] life a living hell. How do you do it,
[1:10:52] church? You want the answer? I've got
[1:10:53] the answer for you this morning. He
[1:10:56] said, "What hurts the devil?" You want
[1:10:58] to hurt the devil? Here it is. is to see
[1:11:01] that sanctified holy life consecrated to
[1:11:06] God.
[1:11:09] He says, "You say anything to him, to
[1:11:11] this man, this this believer, call him
[1:11:14] anything, just as sweet as it can be,
[1:11:16] and move right on." He says, "Oh my,
[1:11:18] that throws him away. That's the thunder
[1:11:21] that shakes the devil." Church, doesn't
[1:11:24] that put us all on the same page now? On
[1:11:26] the same playing field. We're all at the
[1:11:28] same level. Anyone can do this. Any
[1:11:31] child of God, that is. We're not all
[1:11:34] called to get up here and preach the
[1:11:35] gospel. But I'll tell you what, you can
[1:11:38] shake the foundations of hell with a
[1:11:41] sanctified, holy life,
[1:11:45] with a sweetness to your life. No matter
[1:11:48] what comes your way,
[1:11:51] you got power this morning
[1:11:54] to get Satan anxious. I say, "Lord, I
[1:11:58] help us make Satan anxious every day."
[1:12:01] I'd love it that he's more scared of me
[1:12:04] than I am of him. That ought to be our
[1:12:07] testimony. Amen. I'm thankful we've got
[1:12:09] some living voices here today. I say,
[1:12:12] Lord, make us all living voices
[1:12:16] that we're preaching the greatest
[1:12:17] sermons
[1:12:19] ever seen in this last dark age.
[1:12:23] Paul would say this. He says, "For in
[1:12:25] him we live
[1:12:28] and move and have our being as certain
[1:12:31] also of your own poets have said, "For
[1:12:33] we are also his offering." He says, "For
[1:12:36] in him we live. He is our life." In
[1:12:38] other words, then he says, "In him we
[1:12:41] move." And that original word there in
[1:12:44] the original Greek, it means to be
[1:12:45] stirred, to put into action or provoked.
[1:12:48] In other words, Christ is our motivation
[1:12:51] of our life. He's what gets us moving in
[1:12:53] a particular direction or action. He's
[1:12:56] what gets us going every time we make a
[1:12:59] move. Amen. He's the one that puts an
[1:13:02] uncction in our heart to do something.
[1:13:03] He's the divine initiative in our lives.
[1:13:06] Let me put it another way. He's the
[1:13:08] dynamics.
[1:13:10] We all have cars sitting out there. Now,
[1:13:12] I haven't noticed any of you running out
[1:13:14] there to see if your car has moved since
[1:13:16] church started. Just on the off chance.
[1:13:19] Why?
[1:13:20] Because you know once that car has been
[1:13:22] shut off, it has all the mechanics, but
[1:13:25] there are no dynamics. And that car
[1:13:27] won't move until you get in there and
[1:13:29] you turn the key and you start it. And
[1:13:31] when you start it, what happens, church?
[1:13:34] Fire is added. Spark is added. And what
[1:13:37] does that do? It takes the mechanics and
[1:13:39] it puts it into perfect operation.
[1:13:43] That's what Christ does by the spirit in
[1:13:45] our life. He makes us move. That car out
[1:13:48] there, I don't care how long we sit
[1:13:49] here, it will not move of its own accord
[1:13:52] unless something breaks. It'll stay
[1:13:54] there. Why? Because the dynamics aren't
[1:13:56] working. But it just takes the key of
[1:13:58] faith to turn it. And all of a sudden,
[1:14:00] that car will go anywhere you want
[1:14:02] because it's got its own source of
[1:14:04] propulsion inside. He says in him, we
[1:14:07] also have our being. It's our existence
[1:14:09] is is hidden in Christ. It's that hidden
[1:14:11] life that we've heard about so much,
[1:14:12] that we've talked about and preached
[1:14:14] about so much. Amen. Where it's just you
[1:14:16] and him.
[1:14:17] Amen. This isn't a church entity.
[1:14:21] This isn't a social group. It's not a
[1:14:23] community. It's a body. But it's
[1:14:26] individuals that are tied into Christ.
[1:14:29] Amen. It's not a congregational moment.
[1:14:32] It's not special meetings. It's it's
[1:14:34] none of these things. Amen. It is you
[1:14:36] and Christ united. That's what this
[1:14:39] looks like. That's what the preeminence
[1:14:40] look like. But in him we live and move
[1:14:43] and have our being. It's as I said last
[1:14:44] service. Can we say he's initiating
[1:14:48] everything we do in every part of our
[1:14:50] life?
[1:14:52] That's a heavy question.
[1:14:55] That's a hard question. That's a very
[1:14:57] personal question. Amen.
[1:15:01] Does he initiate our entertainment?
[1:15:04] The books we read, the places we go, the
[1:15:07] friends we have, the career moves we
[1:15:08] make,
[1:15:10] our friendships, our relationships.
[1:15:14] Can we say he's the one that's driving
[1:15:16] those things? He started it, not me. He
[1:15:20] led me, not me. Paul's talking here
[1:15:24] about a people that is so lost in Christ
[1:15:27] that you can't see them anymore.
[1:15:31] That's a lofty standard. And you say,
[1:15:33] "How in the world are you going to put
[1:15:36] that on us, Brother John? How in the
[1:15:37] world can we be there?" But let me ask
[1:15:39] you, let me ask our elders. Is your life
[1:15:41] hidden in Christ?
[1:15:44] Please nod your heads.
[1:15:46] Help me out. Brother Gerald, is your
[1:15:49] life hid in Christ?
[1:15:52] It should be.
[1:15:54] But did it happen overnight?
[1:15:58] No, it didn't.
[1:16:02] But eventually you got there. Why? By
[1:16:04] inviting him into every door, every
[1:16:08] room, every situation.
[1:16:12] And how'd you do that? Usually by making
[1:16:14] the mistake of not inviting him in and
[1:16:16] seeing the results that you didn't like.
[1:16:20] I'm not your age yet, but I that's the
[1:16:22] way it's worked with me so far is the
[1:16:24] more that I surrender, the lighter my
[1:16:26] load. The more I yield to him, the
[1:16:29] better it works out. Not that I don't go
[1:16:31] through trials and tribulations, but
[1:16:33] there's a benefit to me in those that I
[1:16:34] don't see if I'm doing it of my own
[1:16:36] accord. Amen.
[1:16:40] He's talking about a people so lost in
[1:16:42] Christ that you can't see them anymore.
[1:16:45] But listen, we look around and Brother
[1:16:48] Mark's way of approaching things is not
[1:16:50] the same as Brother Bob's is not the
[1:16:51] same as Brother Grants is not the same
[1:16:52] as Brother Gerald's. We're all different
[1:16:54] people.
[1:16:56] It doesn't mean that we all act the same
[1:16:58] way,
[1:16:59] but it means that we're yielded the same
[1:17:02] way because God works with us according
[1:17:04] to the way he's built us. We've got
[1:17:07] people that are real connectors
[1:17:10] that really like to be with people. We
[1:17:11] got, you know, a brother Joe would be a
[1:17:13] real connector in our church. Brother
[1:17:15] Paul's a real connector to the young
[1:17:16] people, I think.
[1:17:20] Right.
[1:17:22] But we got real workers here. We got
[1:17:25] Sister Amber and Brother Matt. Real
[1:17:26] workers, real diligent, real duty
[1:17:29] driven. But guess what? But if we put
[1:17:31] them in the connection choir,
[1:17:35] I hope I'm okay saying this. Guess what?
[1:17:37] It's not going to work so well, cuz
[1:17:39] they're one-on-one people. Paul can wow
[1:17:42] a crowd. He can connect with a crowd.
[1:17:44] Joe's the life of the fellowship,
[1:17:47] but they're one-on-one people.
[1:17:50] Then we got musicians.
[1:17:52] We got Brother Levi and Sister Lydia up
[1:17:55] here this morning. I thought that was
[1:17:57] wonderful. I was surprised to see
[1:17:59] because I thought Paul was playing.
[1:18:00] Brother Levi, that's the highest
[1:18:01] compliment I can give you. I thought
[1:18:02] Brother Paul was playing. Then when I
[1:18:03] looked out, I saw he was singing. So
[1:18:05] what is it? We got a generation rising
[1:18:07] up of musicians.
[1:18:09] But guess what? I don't know. Maybe
[1:18:11] brother Levi's going to be song leader.
[1:18:12] I don't know. But for now, he's a guitar
[1:18:14] player and Sister Lydia is a piano
[1:18:16] player. And we've got all these things.
[1:18:19] Listen, Brother Garfield and I are the
[1:18:21] only preachers left. We got Brother
[1:18:22] Gerald who's retired. There's only two
[1:18:23] preachers in this church. And God forbid
[1:18:26] anyone else try and be it if you're not
[1:18:28] called to be it. And I don't know if you
[1:18:30] noticed, but brother Garfield preaches
[1:18:32] differently than I do. The difference is
[1:18:34] slight. I I admit,
[1:18:39] but but is brother Garfield yielded to
[1:18:41] the spirit?
[1:18:43] Am I yielded to the spirit?
[1:18:46] Totally different approach. Totally
[1:18:48] different approach.
[1:18:50] So don't try and make yourself like
[1:18:52] brother so and so or sister so and so.
[1:18:55] But you got to find his way and his will
[1:18:57] for your life. the way that he wants to
[1:18:59] lead you. Amen. We've got great
[1:19:01] providers here, but we don't all provide
[1:19:04] the same. We have the slightly insane
[1:19:06] business owners
[1:19:08] and the more sane employees amongst us.
[1:19:12] Some of us are built for the risks and
[1:19:14] the the the high-risk, highreward life
[1:19:17] of entrepreneurialship.
[1:19:20] And some of us are meant for the slower,
[1:19:22] steadier employee line. And that's okay.
[1:19:27] But God works with all of us as he's
[1:19:29] built us because he's built us with
[1:19:31] purpose, for purpose. Amen. So, we've
[1:19:33] got to be able to see that in our own
[1:19:35] lives. Amen. And that's where the
[1:19:37] personal intimacy of the leadership of
[1:19:39] Jesus Christ in your life comes in.
[1:19:42] Amen. I look at our young people here
[1:19:44] today. I look at where they're going.
[1:19:47] Listen, some are going to university and
[1:19:50] some are going straight into the
[1:19:51] workforce. Some are going blue collar,
[1:19:53] some are going white collar.
[1:19:56] Some aren't even going into the
[1:19:57] workforce.
[1:19:59] Why? It's got to be God's leadership for
[1:20:02] you. And you got to be able to be
[1:20:04] satisfied with the leadership that he's
[1:20:06] given you and trust that he'll work it
[1:20:07] out for you. Amen. But here's one thing
[1:20:09] we know that whatever God's doing in our
[1:20:12] life, it's based on his unmmerited grace
[1:20:14] and love for us. Remember what what
[1:20:18] Jesus said. He said, "Listen, your your
[1:20:19] your um judges and your elders, they
[1:20:22] judge they they they they disciplined
[1:20:24] you." He says, "And they did it for your
[1:20:26] good." You know, so many times we're
[1:20:28] disciplining our kids for our good,
[1:20:30] church, I'm way off this morning, okay?
[1:20:32] Just let me preach this morning. You
[1:20:34] know why we discipline our kids
[1:20:36] sometimes? For our good.
[1:20:38] Sit down, shut up, be quiet. That's what
[1:20:41] we're disciplining them for. That's how
[1:20:43] the elders and the judges did it. We
[1:20:45] just want some peace and rest and time
[1:20:49] to take a shower.
[1:20:51] But he says he does it for our good. For
[1:20:55] our good. So when we're when he's
[1:20:58] working in our lives and we're giving
[1:21:00] him the preeminence, hey, sometimes it's
[1:21:01] going to be hard, but he's doing it for
[1:21:04] our good, not for his good. Amen. Listen
[1:21:07] to this. He says, "These those days he
[1:21:09] dwelt in his tabernacle," pointing back
[1:21:10] to the days of Israel. "And today he
[1:21:12] dwells in you as his tabernacle." He
[1:21:15] says, "But we must take make this place
[1:21:17] a dwelling, not an outer court place or
[1:21:19] the first holy place." Remember, they
[1:21:21] had the outer court, the inner court,
[1:21:22] and the holy of holies. And there were
[1:21:24] certain groups of people that could come
[1:21:26] into each. He says, "But you got his
[1:21:27] presence was only in the holiest of
[1:21:29] holies, and that's where he wants you to
[1:21:31] be." We know that's where he wants us to
[1:21:33] be because he tore the veil when Christ
[1:21:35] died. And he made a way for every man
[1:21:37] and woman. You didn't have to be a
[1:21:40] priest. You didn't have to be a a member
[1:21:41] of the tribe of Levi. You didn't have to
[1:21:43] have a body without blemish.
[1:21:46] Anybody can go in. Well, he says, "But
[1:21:49] we must live with God in the holiest of
[1:21:51] holies, a consecrated, hidden life,
[1:21:53] alone, quiet with God." He says, "We
[1:21:56] become too excited, upset about too many
[1:22:00] things." He says, "And it shows there's
[1:22:02] something lacking.
[1:22:05] The church ought to be a million miles
[1:22:06] up the road to what it is now. We're
[1:22:09] still back down in the adolescent age,
[1:22:10] fussing and fighting and quarreling and
[1:22:12] stewing when we ought to be consecrated,
[1:22:15] hid away in the holiest of holies with
[1:22:17] God. He says, "It's better we come easy
[1:22:18] and take our time and see where we're
[1:22:20] going." Notice, he says, "Every year the
[1:22:23] high priest entered into that place, the
[1:22:25] congregation followed him up. And when
[1:22:27] he went into the great place where the
[1:22:28] veil dropped behind him, the inner
[1:22:30] courts, the holiest of holies, no one
[1:22:32] dared to go after him. Then he was alone
[1:22:35] with God.
[1:22:37] I can't imagine what it felt to be the
[1:22:40] ones that had to stay outside
[1:22:43] because really church, you were trusting
[1:22:45] that man by faith to tell you the truth
[1:22:48] that God would accept him in your place.
[1:22:50] The blood that he brought in in your
[1:22:52] place, but people didn't get to
[1:22:54] experience God directly because he dwelt
[1:22:58] behind the holiest of holies behind the
[1:22:59] veil there.
[1:23:01] He says he was alone with God. What a
[1:23:03] beautiful picture it is today of a
[1:23:05] consecrated life who once enters in with
[1:23:08] Christ dead to the things of the world
[1:23:11] and hid away with God and the veils drop
[1:23:14] down around and all the world shut off.
[1:23:18] He said then Christianity and religion
[1:23:20] become a pleasure to every believer.
[1:23:24] The hardest thing to deal with church is
[1:23:26] all the other voices so many times
[1:23:28] pulling, pushing, trying to influence.
[1:23:31] But he says when you get in there with
[1:23:33] just God and the veil drops behind it's
[1:23:36] just you and him. He says then your
[1:23:38] Christianity and religion becomes a
[1:23:39] pleas a a pleasure to every believer.
[1:23:42] Catch this. He says today people just
[1:23:44] have enough religion to make them
[1:23:46] miserable.
[1:23:48] Knowing that they ought to do this and
[1:23:51] they're trying to escape hell. See, it's
[1:23:54] all about their effort and their trying.
[1:23:57] And I don't want to go to hell and I
[1:23:58] want to save myself. And so everything
[1:24:00] is try, try try, try try and there's no
[1:24:02] rest in the trying cuz you'll never do
[1:24:05] it. Brother Joe shared a quote this
[1:24:07] morning says, "We all backslide every
[1:24:10] day." And you know what? If you don't
[1:24:12] have an anchor of your soul, that
[1:24:14] backsliding, those trips, those faults,
[1:24:16] those mistakes will beat you up until
[1:24:18] you convince yourself you're not a child
[1:24:19] of God.
[1:24:21] But when that veil drops in and you know
[1:24:23] that you are and you know the blood's
[1:24:25] been applied now you can have rest. He
[1:24:27] says they've got just enough religion to
[1:24:29] make them miserable knowing they're
[1:24:30] trying to they ought to do this and
[1:24:32] they're trying to escape hell. He says
[1:24:33] well if that's the way I felt about it
[1:24:34] brother I don't know what I would do. He
[1:24:36] says oh get in with Christ shut off from
[1:24:38] the things of the world for to commune
[1:24:40] with him is a pleasure. It's beautiful.
[1:24:44] We're talking about preeminence. He says
[1:24:47] it's something that fills and satisfies
[1:24:50] the soul. Something that gives you peace
[1:24:52] that passes all understanding.
[1:24:56] He says all the crosses become flying
[1:24:59] wings.
[1:25:01] All the burdens are chariot wheels. He
[1:25:03] says, "Oh, you can fly away. My burdens
[1:25:06] are light. Yoke up with him." He says
[1:25:08] the yoke is all padded with hallelujah.
[1:25:11] When you're once inside the veil with
[1:25:12] him, he becomes your life. I say, "Lord,
[1:25:18] keep me behind the veil." What a place
[1:25:20] to live where your burdens, your crosses
[1:25:25] just lift you higher.
[1:25:28] They just lift you higher. Why? Because
[1:25:31] you're drawn to him. Not drawn to doubt,
[1:25:34] not drawn to despondency, not drawn to
[1:25:36] bitterness, but you're drawn to him. And
[1:25:38] what does it do? As your crosses get
[1:25:40] heavier, as your trials get more
[1:25:43] difficult, it draws you closer to him.
[1:25:46] And there's a peace and there's a rest.
[1:25:48] And there's a satisfaction that comes
[1:25:50] with that. Church, I think the reason
[1:25:52] that we don't sing sweet hour of prayer
[1:25:54] anymore is we don't have the sweet hours
[1:25:56] of prayer anymore. We've got the sweet
[1:25:58] 10 minutes in the morning and it's not
[1:26:00] very sweet. It's very hurried and rushed
[1:26:01] because the kids are about to get up and
[1:26:03] we got to make breakfast and we got to
[1:26:04] get showered and we got to get to work.
[1:26:07] When's the last time you can say it's
[1:26:09] been sweet to be in his presence? That
[1:26:12] wasn't in a church service.
[1:26:15] Let me say it this way. You don't have
[1:26:17] to wait for the resurrection, the
[1:26:18] rapture to get close to Christ.
[1:26:21] That's for sure. You don't have to wait
[1:26:23] to meet him in bodily form to have a
[1:26:25] relationship with him. Amen. You don't
[1:26:27] have to wait then to experience his
[1:26:29] love, his joy, his peace, his patience,
[1:26:31] his goodness, his longsuffering, all of
[1:26:33] these different things. Amen. But you've
[1:26:35] got to set aside time for him. And
[1:26:38] that's something we have to do. That's
[1:26:40] something we've got to do. We've got to
[1:26:42] book time for Jesus.
[1:26:44] Church, these days, we got our phones
[1:26:45] and we use them for everything but
[1:26:47] what's good for us.
[1:26:49] I needed uh my shirts laundered for for
[1:26:52] this service this morning. And uh we
[1:26:54] don't launder them until they're all
[1:26:55] used up, of course. And so I I I had to
[1:26:58] go out and and get something. I I
[1:27:00] brought my wife with me. So before I
[1:27:01] left, I said, "Uh, Siri, remind me to
[1:27:04] put my shirts in the dryer when I get
[1:27:06] home." Cuz I'd have just forgotten them.
[1:27:08] See, if we can use things for tools,
[1:27:10] remember I preached on on uh on marriage
[1:27:13] and husbands treating your wife special.
[1:27:16] I said, "Do what I do. Put a reminder in
[1:27:18] your phone to get her flowers once a
[1:27:19] month, every month. Use it." We use our
[1:27:23] phones for everything but good. so many
[1:27:25] times.
[1:27:27] Put in there and say, "Have devotions at
[1:27:30] 9:30 p.m. every night. If you can't get
[1:27:33] up in the morning, put it in. Lock it
[1:27:35] in. Block your space out.
[1:27:37] Block your calendars out. Put a reminder
[1:27:40] there that won't go away to say, "Hey,
[1:27:42] set some time for Jesus." Amen. Church,
[1:27:45] I set aside time to talk with my wife,
[1:27:48] to walk with my wife, to share things
[1:27:51] with my wife, to spend time with my
[1:27:53] wife. And church, there are times where
[1:27:55] I don't set aside the time, but you know
[1:27:57] what happens? She interjects herself oh
[1:28:00] so sweetly into my life. And she says,
[1:28:03] "Can we talk? Can we go for a walk? Can
[1:28:07] we go on a date?"
[1:28:10] And if I, as an imperfect husband,
[1:28:14] can make that time for her,
[1:28:17] how do you think Christ's response is to
[1:28:18] us when we say, "I'd like to spend some
[1:28:20] time with you." He's never too busy to
[1:28:23] spend some time with you. You're not
[1:28:24] bothering him to go and have a chat with
[1:28:27] him. But I think we've got to do
[1:28:28] something. And this has been on my
[1:28:30] heart. Brother Vichel talked to me a
[1:28:32] long time ago about some aspects of
[1:28:33] prayer. Brother Vichel, I'm hoping to
[1:28:34] start that as I start this next series.
[1:28:36] I want to preach on prayer for a while.
[1:28:38] I may have two s going simultaneously.
[1:28:41] Wednesday nights will be prayer and and
[1:28:43] the Sundays will be this this other
[1:28:44] series I've got. But we've got to get
[1:28:47] away from the idea of saying a prayer.
[1:28:51] and come to praying,
[1:28:54] having a conversation with God.
[1:28:57] We got to get into fellowship,
[1:29:00] relationship,
[1:29:01] connection.
[1:29:04] Husbands, we're really good at surface
[1:29:06] talk. But how many of you find surface
[1:29:08] talk satisfies your wife's need for
[1:29:10] connection? No. She wants to get deep.
[1:29:14] She wants to talk about things that
[1:29:15] matter to her. Deep emotional things,
[1:29:18] deep relational things.
[1:29:20] And God's looking for us to connect with
[1:29:22] him beyond just us saying what we think
[1:29:26] he wants us to say. That's what saying a
[1:29:29] prayer is. Saying what you think he
[1:29:32] wants you to say. Amen. We're not just
[1:29:34] subject and king. It's bride and
[1:29:35] bridegroom now. And we got to start
[1:29:38] acting like a married couple. Amen. If
[1:29:40] you've got a healthy marriage, your
[1:29:41] spouse can talk to you about anything.
[1:29:44] Anything.
[1:29:45] They can talk to you about you and they
[1:29:48] can talk to you about them. Amen.
[1:29:52] And we respond and we go back and forth.
[1:29:55] But if we've got this idea of I'm just
[1:29:56] going to say to God what I think he
[1:29:58] wants me to hear, all we've got is false
[1:30:01] fellowship. It's a surface relationship.
[1:30:03] There's no reality in those things. Can
[1:30:06] I can I show you what a real prayer life
[1:30:08] looks like, church?
[1:30:10] I don't have it in my notes. Came to me
[1:30:12] in there. Turn if you will to Psalms
[1:30:14] chapter 10.
[1:30:17] Psalms chapter 10
[1:30:24] and verse one.
[1:30:27] This is David's prayer.
[1:30:34] Have you ever prayed a prayer like this?
[1:30:38] Why standest thou aar off, O Lord? Why
[1:30:42] hideest thou thyself in times of
[1:30:45] trouble?
[1:30:48] What's he saying?
[1:30:50] He's saying, God, why do you not come on
[1:30:53] my scene? Why are you not in my
[1:30:56] circumstances?
[1:30:58] I've prayed, I've served, I've lived
[1:31:01] according to your requirement, and yet
[1:31:03] when I come before you, you stay at a
[1:31:06] distance.
[1:31:09] He says, "You hide yourself in times of
[1:31:11] trouble." Turn a few pages over. Psalms
[1:31:14] 13,
[1:31:16] verse one. How long wilt thou forget me,
[1:31:19] oh Lord? Forever. How long wil thou hide
[1:31:23] thy face from me?
[1:31:26] How long shalt I take counsel in my
[1:31:28] soul, having sorrow in mine heart daily?
[1:31:31] How long shall mine enemy be exalted
[1:31:33] over me?
[1:31:35] David's not going in and saying, "Oh
[1:31:37] Lord, thou art the greatest.
[1:31:40] Lord, I am I'm good.
[1:31:44] Lord, I'm thankful for this trial you've
[1:31:47] given me."
[1:31:49] He said, "Jesus, why?
[1:31:53] Why is it that you haven't moved yet?
[1:31:58] How come I can't feel your presence?
[1:32:01] How come you haven't answered my prayer?
[1:32:03] I've done everything you've asked me to
[1:32:05] do.
[1:32:09] And yet you stand still.
[1:32:12] You move not. You answer not. And I'm
[1:32:15] running for my life.
[1:32:23] Church, we've got to bring our needs to
[1:32:24] him,
[1:32:26] our burdens to him,
[1:32:28] your feelings to him.
[1:32:39] I'll tell you this
[1:32:41] and I pray this regularly. I say, "Lord,
[1:32:44] you see how I feel about this situation,
[1:32:47] about this person,
[1:32:50] about this action,
[1:32:52] reaction,
[1:32:54] lack of action.
[1:32:57] Lord, you see I'm frustrated.
[1:33:00] You see I'm anxious.
[1:33:03] You see I'm critical.
[1:33:05] You see I'm bitter.
[1:33:11] You see I've made it about me.
[1:33:16] But notice David never stays there.
[1:33:23] Bring your need to him and leave it
[1:33:26] there. Look at what he says. Consider
[1:33:30] and hear me, oh Lord my God. Lighten
[1:33:33] mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of
[1:33:35] death, lest mine enemies say, I have
[1:33:37] prevailed against him, and those that
[1:33:40] troubled me rejoice when I am moved. He
[1:33:42] says, but I have trusted in thy mercy.
[1:33:46] My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
[1:33:51] I will sing unto the Lord because he
[1:33:54] hath dealt bountifully with me.
[1:33:57] He doesn't even have the answer,
[1:34:00] but he says, "I'll sing anyways. I'll
[1:34:03] praise you for what's coming even when I
[1:34:05] don't see it." But church, we've got to
[1:34:08] be honest with God.
[1:34:11] We've got to be able to say, "This is
[1:34:13] where I am. This is what I'm dealing
[1:34:15] with. This is what I'm feeling. This is
[1:34:18] what I'm fighting. This is what I'm
[1:34:20] losing.
[1:34:24] But Lord, I know there's victory. I know
[1:34:27] there's deliverance. I know there's
[1:34:29] healing. I know there's salvation. I
[1:34:32] know there's a restoration coming. Lord,
[1:34:35] I'm here for that. I'm here to pour out
[1:34:38] my heart so you can fill it up with you.
[1:34:43] I'm here to lay down my rights
[1:34:46] to feel, to harbor,
[1:34:50] to get prickly.
[1:34:54] and say, "Lord, fill me up with some of
[1:34:55] that joy, that love, that peace, that
[1:34:58] rest, that longsuffering, that patience
[1:35:02] that passes my own understanding. I
[1:35:05] can't explain it. All I can tell you is
[1:35:07] he touched me."
[1:35:09] Glory to God.
[1:35:11] Church, don't leave the way you came in.
[1:35:14] But it's okay to come in the way you
[1:35:15] are. That's what he wants you. He wants
[1:35:18] you to express yourself so that he can
[1:35:20] change you. Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; We read at last service about going in
[1:35:25] and praying. What's the purpose of the
[1:35:27] Holy Spirit in our lives? To change our
[1:35:29] attitude. To change our atmosphere. To
[1:35:32] change our reaction to things. To let us
[1:35:34] go in one way and come out the other.
[1:35:37] Day in and day out. Day in and day out.
[1:35:40] A daily entrance into the Holy of Holies
[1:35:42] where it's just you and Christ together.
[1:35:44] Amen. Where we can admit we've got some
[1:35:46] work to do. We've got battles we need to
[1:35:49] win. We've got battles we're losing.
[1:35:51] We've got battles we've lost.
[1:35:54] But the war isn't over. And we're
[1:35:56] coming. We're saying, "Lord, we need
[1:35:57] some general help here."
[1:36:03] Look at our marriages. Look at our
[1:36:05] relationships. Say, "Lord, I need help.
[1:36:08] I've had to do it." I guarantee most of
[1:36:11] us do as well.
[1:36:13] Because remember, church, the first
[1:36:14] place the word is expressed right here.
[1:36:19] It's in you.
[1:36:21] You don't walk out and express the word
[1:36:22] in someone else. You walk out and
[1:36:24] express the word in yourself. It's got
[1:36:26] to be that inward work. It's got to be
[1:36:27] him having the preeminence as may in us
[1:36:30] so that when we walk out and something
[1:36:33] happens, what happens is not my
[1:36:34] reaction, it's his reaction. It's not my
[1:36:36] word, it's his word. It's not my
[1:36:38] thought, it's his thought. And that's
[1:36:40] when we can start to see these. My
[1:36:42] response is his response because I've
[1:36:44] yielded myself to his tender embrace and
[1:36:48] faith taking hold of the word. My
[1:36:50] feathers fell off
[1:36:52] and I anchored my soul. The haven of
[1:36:55] rest is my Lord.
[1:36:58] Amen.
[1:36:59] Doesn't mean I don't feel hurt, bad,
[1:37:03] offended.
[1:37:04] Let me tell you, church, as a pastor,
[1:37:06] it's easy to get offended.
[1:37:08] But, you know, I I put it in our with
[1:37:11] Sister Priscilla. We grant her grace and
[1:37:13] we we share some of the songs we think
[1:37:15] we may sing. And I put on there, I'm
[1:37:16] coming back to the heart of worship
[1:37:18] because it can be real easy as a pastor
[1:37:19] to take things personally. But you know
[1:37:22] what? It's not about me. It's always
[1:37:24] about him. And we get worked up when we
[1:37:27] make it about us instead of we realize
[1:37:29] it's all about him in the first place.
[1:37:32] church. What this means is when Christ
[1:37:34] gets the preeminence, he wins the
[1:37:37] victory over me.
[1:37:40] That's what he's looking for. Remember
[1:37:42] what it says in Revelation 3, that you
[1:37:44] can sit in the throne even overcome as I
[1:37:47] overcame. Jesus says that you would
[1:37:48] overcome as I overcame and sit in my
[1:37:50] throne. Who did Jesus overcome? Self.
[1:37:54] Self.
[1:37:56] He didn't rule over the earth. He had
[1:37:59] authority and a dominion, but he did not
[1:38:00] rule over the earth. He ruled over self
[1:38:02] because he yielded himself. Not my will
[1:38:04] but thine be done. So the victory that
[1:38:07] God is looking for is to have the
[1:38:08] preeminence. Because when he has the
[1:38:10] preeminence, church, me winning over
[1:38:13] Satan is just a function of Satan having
[1:38:16] no access to me because Christ has the
[1:38:19] preeminence.
[1:38:20] That's it. Satan can't fight with me if
[1:38:24] I've already lost to Christ. Now he's
[1:38:27] got to deal with Christ one-on-one. And
[1:38:29] guess who wins that battle? It's already
[1:38:31] won. He's holding the keys to his house.
[1:38:35] He's holding the keys to his gates.
[1:38:38] I'm not fighting now. It's Christ in me
[1:38:40] that's fighting because I've yielded
[1:38:41] myself to him completely. He has full
[1:38:44] control of my life and now Satan has no
[1:38:45] access points.
[1:38:48] Remember what happens in the millennium
[1:38:49] is Satan is bound by chains of
[1:38:51] circumstance. He's got nobody to work
[1:38:53] with. Church, in the lives of believers,
[1:38:55] that ought to be our testimony, Lord. By
[1:38:58] chains of circumstance, Satan has no
[1:39:00] power over me because you've taken full
[1:39:02] preeminence in my life.
[1:39:05] Jesus would say this in John 15,
[1:39:08] I am the true vine. That means there's a
[1:39:11] false vine, too. But I am the true vine,
[1:39:13] and my father is the husbandman. Every
[1:39:16] branch in me that beareth not fruit, he
[1:39:18] taketh away. And every branch that
[1:39:20] beareth fruit, he purges it that it may
[1:39:22] bring forth more fruit. I remember I
[1:39:24] preached on that. And when you look at
[1:39:25] them purging a vineyard and purging the
[1:39:27] vines, it looks so rough and harsh, but
[1:39:30] it produces more fruit than it had
[1:39:31] before. He said, 'Now ye are clean
[1:39:34] through the word.' How does God clean up
[1:39:36] our life? The washing of water by the
[1:39:38] word,
[1:39:40] which I have spoken unto you. Abide in
[1:39:42] me and I in you. As the branch cannot
[1:39:44] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[1:39:46] the vine, no more can ye except ye abide
[1:39:50] in me. I am the vine, ye are the
[1:39:53] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[1:39:56] him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:39:58] For without me, ye can do nothing. What
[1:40:01] is the secret? I can do nothing in
[1:40:04] myself, but I can do all things through
[1:40:06] Christ, which strengthens me
[1:40:09] as a believer. That's the first lesson
[1:40:11] he tries to teach you. In yourself,
[1:40:14] you'll never win. Otherwise, you'd have
[1:40:15] won already.
[1:40:17] But we need him. He says, "If a man
[1:40:19] abide not in me, he's cast forth as a
[1:40:21] branch and is withered. and then gather
[1:40:23] them and cast them into the fire and
[1:40:25] they are burned. If you abide in me, and
[1:40:29] here's that wonderful word, and my words
[1:40:32] abide in you, you shall ask what you
[1:40:35] will and it shall be done unto you.
[1:40:36] We've preached on this many times, but
[1:40:38] notice the promise is for those that are
[1:40:40] abiding in Christ,
[1:40:43] not with Christ, in Christ. And that's
[1:40:46] only 1 Corinthians 12. By one spirit,
[1:40:48] you're baptized into one body. It takes
[1:40:51] the Holy Spirit to abide in Christ.
[1:40:53] Amen. He's in you. You're in him. It's
[1:40:56] for those that are joined to Christ. Not
[1:40:57] a personal connection. Not I go to this
[1:40:59] church, my name's on a book, I pay
[1:41:01] tithe. No, it's abiding in Christ. And
[1:41:03] you know that you are abiding in him
[1:41:05] when his word is abiding in you. When
[1:41:07] it's engraved on your heart. Amen. And
[1:41:10] he says when you're there, when you have
[1:41:12] this condition, when you're living in me
[1:41:14] and I'm living in you,
[1:41:17] then you can ask whatever you want and
[1:41:19] you'll get it. Why? Because you won't
[1:41:22] ask by selfishness. You'll ask by
[1:41:24] surrender.
[1:41:26] You'll say, "Lord, what is your will?
[1:41:28] This is what your word says. That is
[1:41:29] your will. That's what I'll ask for."
[1:41:32] You're never against God's will to ask
[1:41:33] what's in his word. But you got to put
[1:41:35] it into the right time and season.
[1:41:37] That's all. But we won't be selfish.
[1:41:39] We'll be surrendered. He listen to this.
[1:41:41] He says, "There's only one thing that
[1:41:42] never did begin, and that was God."
[1:41:44] Therefore, the only way we can ever live
[1:41:46] eternal is to have God's own life in us,
[1:41:48] and that's eternal life. God separated
[1:41:51] himself among us and gave his spirit
[1:41:53] like he did on Pentecost and it was seen
[1:41:55] in symbols of fire from the pillar of
[1:41:57] fire that separated itself amongst the
[1:41:59] people to give his own life out to the
[1:42:03] people. What was the purpose of the day
[1:42:05] of Pentecost? To put eternal life into
[1:42:08] each and every one of us. He says and
[1:42:10] through this the mind of Christ should
[1:42:13] be operating amongst us. In other words,
[1:42:15] it takes the indwelling of the Holy
[1:42:17] Spirit to have the mind of Christ. What
[1:42:20] is the mind of Christ? To know the will
[1:42:22] of God and be surrendered enough to
[1:42:24] fulfill it instead of fight it. That's
[1:42:27] what it is is to surrender rather than
[1:42:30] to fight. Amen. That's what the mind of
[1:42:33] Christ does in our life. He says, "And
[1:42:35] then God is the word. In the beginning
[1:42:36] was the word. The word was with God. The
[1:42:38] word was God. And it's still God."
[1:42:40] That's right. Is the word. And when we
[1:42:42] get away from the word, then we're away
[1:42:44] from God.
[1:42:48] That's straight.
[1:42:50] You can't say, "I'm being led by the
[1:42:52] Holy Spirit," and be contradicting the
[1:42:54] word of God. Impossible.
[1:42:57] He says, "And when we get away from the
[1:42:59] word, then we're away from God." Jesus
[1:43:00] said, "If you abide in me," he says
[1:43:02] there's their mystery, there's the
[1:43:05] secret. If you abide in me and my word
[1:43:07] in you, then ask what you will. He says,
[1:43:09] "See, the idea is first, God's word has
[1:43:12] got to abide here." Remember, we're
[1:43:14] talking about he is the dynamics. He's
[1:43:16] the divine inspiration of our life. And
[1:43:19] he's saying before you can come into
[1:43:20] John 15 like this, you got to have
[1:43:23] something on the inside that will drive
[1:43:25] what comes out. The idea, the word, the
[1:43:28] genesis has to be here. The source has
[1:43:31] to be here to pull out what God's trying
[1:43:33] to do in your life. And until that's
[1:43:35] there, you'll speak all you want. You'll
[1:43:37] believe all you want, but it'll be
[1:43:39] according to the lust of your own flesh.
[1:43:41] That's what James talks about. You'll
[1:43:44] ask the wrong way. You'll ask a miss,
[1:43:46] and it'll take you down a path you don't
[1:43:48] want to go to.
[1:43:50] Like we said earlier, if you're a
[1:43:51] believer, a real believer born again by
[1:43:53] the spirit, that word has been carved
[1:43:55] into your heart. It's not negotiable, is
[1:43:58] it, Brother Joe? It's not negotiable.
[1:44:01] Brother Joe has told me so many
[1:44:02] testimonies of people that he works with
[1:44:05] that have tried to get him to do things,
[1:44:07] that have tried to give him contracts to
[1:44:08] do things that are contrary to the word.
[1:44:10] And you know what he says? No,
[1:44:14] it's not negotiable. And he's had people
[1:44:16] come back at him and try over and over
[1:44:18] and even say, I'll give you all this if
[1:44:20] you'll give me if you'll just do this.
[1:44:22] And he says, I don't need and they'll
[1:44:24] say, you know, give it a week and come
[1:44:25] back. He says, I don't need to go back.
[1:44:28] It's not negotiable. I will not do it. I
[1:44:31] will not do it. No matter how much the
[1:44:33] business needs it, I won't do it because
[1:44:35] it's contrary to the word. And what has
[1:44:38] God done every time? Come back around
[1:44:39] and give him the work that they offered
[1:44:40] him in the first place. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:43] You stand for him, he'll stand for you.
[1:44:46] Amen. But we've got to get out of this
[1:44:47] idea of it's negotiable.
[1:44:50] It's Christ the word or nothing.
[1:44:54] On Christ the solid rock I stand. All
[1:44:56] other ground is sinking sand. You
[1:44:58] compromise one step, you go next year,
[1:45:01] and you'll be a mile away. Because it'll
[1:45:03] just be a departure of one step a day,
[1:45:06] one step a week, and pretty soon you
[1:45:07] say, "Holy cow, how did I get here?"
[1:45:11] That's what compromise is. It's usually
[1:45:12] one step, not a bunch. Amen. What he's
[1:45:17] showing us here is we don't initiate
[1:45:19] anything.
[1:45:21] We are yielded. We're receiving, not
[1:45:24] initiating these things. We're under
[1:45:25] headship, not taking authority. We have
[1:45:27] authority. Absolutely, we have
[1:45:29] authority. That's all we have is
[1:45:30] authority. But it's authority under
[1:45:33] headship. I've talked many times about
[1:45:34] this about Paul going on his mission
[1:45:36] trips in Acts 16 and he was going
[1:45:38] through Asia. And the scripture says
[1:45:40] that they were forbidden by the Holy
[1:45:42] Ghost to preach the word in Asia. Now,
[1:45:44] Paul's a preacher. He's an apostle. He's
[1:45:47] a prophet. He's gifted. He's called and
[1:45:50] he's ordained to preach the gospel. And
[1:45:52] then the Holy Spirit says, "Don't preach
[1:45:53] the gospel in Asia.
[1:45:58] Why? Why did he obey? Because he was a
[1:46:01] vessel.
[1:46:03] A vessel doesn't move on its own. That's
[1:46:06] like I said, those cars out there aren't
[1:46:08] moving because there's nothing to
[1:46:10] operate them. A vessel sits there until
[1:46:13] the master takes it and pours it out
[1:46:15] where he would want to pour it out. And
[1:46:17] then he fills it up. And when he fills
[1:46:18] it up, you may sit there for a week, a
[1:46:20] month, or a year. And then he'll pour
[1:46:21] you out again wherever he wants to do
[1:46:23] it. That was Paul's life. He's a yielded
[1:46:26] vessel. Amen.
[1:46:28] So he says, "Okay, we can't preach in
[1:46:30] Asia." Well, we're close to Bethnia. We
[1:46:32] really want to go. And they tried. The
[1:46:33] scripture says they attempted to go to
[1:46:35] Bethnia to get some fellowship.
[1:46:38] They were actively pursuing going to
[1:46:41] Bethnia. And then the Holy Spirit said
[1:46:43] no. And you know what they did, church?
[1:46:45] They stopped attempting.
[1:46:49] If it's not working out,
[1:46:51] maybe we need to let it go. Okay.
[1:46:56] Did it make sense to Paul at the time?
[1:46:58] Did Paul know at that moment why he
[1:47:00] wasn't allowed to preach in Asia and why
[1:47:02] he wasn't allowed to preach in Bethnia?
[1:47:04] He had no clue. But what he knew God's
[1:47:07] will was don't do it. And he said,
[1:47:09] "Okay, I won't do it." Later, God would
[1:47:11] show them the way. Listen to this. He
[1:47:13] says, "You'll never know him by
[1:47:14] reasoning." God is not God is not known
[1:47:17] by reason. He's known by faith. You
[1:47:19] accept it. You believe it. But he says
[1:47:21] you can't do it until something happens
[1:47:23] in you. Then the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:47:26] and you have the mind of Christ.
[1:47:28] Remember the Holy Spirit is the spirit
[1:47:30] of truth. It's the guide. It's the
[1:47:31] tutor. It's the teacher. It's divine
[1:47:33] intelligence. It's everything we need to
[1:47:35] walk us in the proper direction. But
[1:47:38] we've got to accept it in its position
[1:47:40] and in its role. That's the way it has
[1:47:42] to work. Church. You've got to be led by
[1:47:45] the spirit. And you've got to know
[1:47:48] you're led by the spirit. Otherwise,
[1:47:50] you'll be so hard trying to just break
[1:47:52] down doors that aren't going to open.
[1:47:54] And you'll be frustrated because you've
[1:47:56] been beating on this door for so long
[1:47:59] and nothing's happening. And meanwhile,
[1:48:01] God's got a door right over there for
[1:48:03] you to walk through.
[1:48:05] Why? He's got a perfect will for your
[1:48:07] life. You'll drive yourself baddy trying
[1:48:10] to go through doors that God doesn't
[1:48:12] want you to go through if you're a child
[1:48:13] of God. Amen.
[1:48:16] We think we can do it by sheer will,
[1:48:18] sheer effort, sheer skill even.
[1:48:22] And he's there saying, "No, leave it
[1:48:25] alone. Leave it alone."
[1:48:28] He said, "God is not mocked. Be not
[1:48:30] deceived. God's not mocked. Whatsoever a
[1:48:32] man seweth or a nation," he says, "So
[1:48:35] shall they reap to individuals or to
[1:48:36] nations." And we must keep that in mind.
[1:48:38] While we believe with all of our heart
[1:48:40] that God's visiting us now on a special
[1:48:42] occasion to get together here, keep that
[1:48:44] in mind. God doesn't do anything for
[1:48:46] myth. He's got a purpose in doing these
[1:48:49] things. He's got something in his mind
[1:48:51] that he's trying to do. He says if we
[1:48:54] can only find what he's doing and find
[1:48:58] his will.
[1:48:59] He says it will behoove us to take a
[1:49:02] little time and pray and find out what
[1:49:05] our father's trying to do. See, we've
[1:49:08] talked before about presumption.
[1:49:10] Presumption takes you into the land of
[1:49:12] permissive will.
[1:49:14] Amen. And we can say, well, I'm a child
[1:49:17] of God, and therefore, if I feel or I
[1:49:19] think or I've got initiative or I've got
[1:49:20] an uncction, that must be the leadership
[1:49:22] of God. No. It behooves us to take a
[1:49:25] little time and pray and find out what
[1:49:28] our father's trying to do. If the doors
[1:49:30] you're knocking on aren't opening, maybe
[1:49:32] it's time to move on. Maybe it's time to
[1:49:35] step back and say, "Lord, is this me or
[1:49:38] is this you?" That's all.
[1:49:41] Amen. It might be his will to open it,
[1:49:44] but not right now. I've had many times
[1:49:47] in my life where I was trying to do it.
[1:49:49] Hey, I tried to come back to
[1:49:50] Newfoundland since I left Texas.
[1:49:53] 2010,
[1:49:55] it took 10 years for me to get back
[1:49:57] here, church.
[1:49:59] 10 years to get back. I was attempting
[1:50:01] to do it, but when God had a time for it
[1:50:04] to happen, it happened. And it happened
[1:50:06] so sovereignly and miraculously
[1:50:09] that you almost wonder how it was
[1:50:11] possible. Why? Cuz God's got a time and
[1:50:13] a season for everything. And if he's
[1:50:16] shutting the door, it's for my good and
[1:50:18] your good. And we're best to leave it
[1:50:20] alone. Paul would go back. The Holy
[1:50:23] Spirit in Acts 16 forbade him to preach.
[1:50:25] In Acts 19, he goes to Asia and he
[1:50:28] preaches there for two years. Two years.
[1:50:32] Paul didn't spend two years in many
[1:50:34] places. He spent two years in Asia and
[1:50:36] God blessed his ministry there. God had
[1:50:39] a time and a season. Amen. But Paul had
[1:50:42] to be sensitive to the leading of the
[1:50:44] Holy Spirit. How do you become sensitive
[1:50:45] to the leading of the Holy Spirit,
[1:50:47] church?
[1:50:49] Shout it out.
[1:50:52] Thank you, brother Paul. Read your Bible
[1:50:55] and pray. Amen. Spend time with God.
[1:50:59] Listen, the Holy Spirit speaks primarily
[1:51:01] by his word. We don't have a prophet
[1:51:04] here. As far as I know, we don't have a
[1:51:08] prophet. We don't have somebody that has
[1:51:10] dreams and visions.
[1:51:12] I was talking to a brother in British
[1:51:14] Columbia,
[1:51:16] owns multiple businesses
[1:51:19] and he was seeking leadership on
[1:51:21] something
[1:51:23] and he just wasn't sure. You know, it
[1:51:25] seemed like a good opportunity, but he,
[1:51:27] you know, his life is dedicated to the
[1:51:28] Lord. He's a sincere believer. and he
[1:51:31] said, you know,
[1:51:34] he talked to his pastor said, you know,
[1:51:37] if you're looking for God's leading,
[1:51:38] look for how he's led you in the past
[1:51:40] and he'll probably do the same thing.
[1:51:42] And so that's what he did. And he says,
[1:51:43] "God has always given me clear direction
[1:51:46] in the word." And so he just went and he
[1:51:48] start he he was praying about it and he
[1:51:50] just read his Bible. And there was just
[1:51:52] this one little scripture he came across
[1:51:55] that completely addressed the situation
[1:51:57] he was facing. and he said, "I'm going
[1:51:59] to go ahead with this."
[1:52:02] And he didn't there was stress involved
[1:52:03] with it. He didn't have the money for
[1:52:05] it. He didn't have anything to move
[1:52:06] ahead with this. But the word told him,
[1:52:08] "Do it." He said, "And the day we
[1:52:11] closed, the money went into the account
[1:52:14] to close the deal." The day
[1:52:18] does God know how to test our faith? God
[1:52:21] knows how to prove his word is what he
[1:52:22] does. the day he had to have it, it was
[1:52:26] there.
[1:52:29] What a mighty God we serve, church. But
[1:52:31] he's looking for people that'll seek him
[1:52:34] and then trust him and wait on him.
[1:52:36] Amen.
[1:52:38] How do you get more sensitive? Read your
[1:52:40] Bible and pray. And by prayer, I mean,
[1:52:43] don't say what you think he wants to
[1:52:44] hear. Have a real conversation with God.
[1:52:47] Have a real conversation with God. Amen.
[1:52:49] That has to be a daily thing for us.
[1:52:51] Proverbs 3 says, "Trust in the Lord with
[1:52:53] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[1:52:56] own understanding. In all thy ways,
[1:53:00] in all thy ways, in all things he should
[1:53:03] have the preeminence. In all thy ways
[1:53:05] acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
[1:53:07] paths." That word acknowledge means
[1:53:09] know, be aware of, recognize beyond a
[1:53:12] shadow of a doubt by intimate
[1:53:14] relationship.
[1:53:16] In other words, make sure he is present
[1:53:18] in all areas of your life. Make sure
[1:53:21] that he is there, that he is approving,
[1:53:25] that he is willing, and that he is
[1:53:28] leading and guiding. Okay? What it means
[1:53:31] is make sure that God is present in
[1:53:34] every area of your life. That's what it
[1:53:36] means to acknowledge him in all your
[1:53:38] ways.
[1:53:40] And then it says, "And then he shall
[1:53:42] direct thy paths." So acknowledging God
[1:53:44] in your in your ways is not saying,
[1:53:46] Lord, I'm going to go do this. Please
[1:53:48] bless it. Lord, I'm gonna go marry this
[1:53:51] person. Please bless it. Lord, I'm gonna
[1:53:54] go to this church. Lord, I'm going to
[1:53:55] start this job. Lord, I'm gonna buy this
[1:53:57] business. Please bless it. No, that's
[1:53:59] him acknowledging you.
[1:54:02] That's self worship. That's idolatry.
[1:54:04] But what you're saying is, Lord, here's
[1:54:06] my circumstances.
[1:54:08] Lord, I'm a young person. I've got to
[1:54:10] make decisions about school, about jobs,
[1:54:14] about a spouse.
[1:54:16] What would you have me to do?
[1:54:19] And remember, you have to be quiet
[1:54:21] before God. When you've done asking,
[1:54:24] when you've done crying, when you've
[1:54:26] done expressing, when you've done asking
[1:54:29] questions, sit back and give them a
[1:54:32] chance to talk back.
[1:54:35] And that can be hard. That can be hard
[1:54:37] in a house as ours that is just built
[1:54:39] acoustically to magnify every patter of
[1:54:41] footpr foot footsteps above you, every
[1:54:44] barking dog, every fighting child.
[1:54:49] You got to get away and get quiet. Go
[1:54:52] for a walk.
[1:54:54] Go drive somewhere.
[1:54:57] Husbands, give your wives time to get
[1:54:58] away. Give them a break.
[1:55:02] Give them a chance to be quiet with God.
[1:55:04] Let them settle their spirits. and let
[1:55:06] him speak.
[1:55:08] And then when you've done that, check it
[1:55:10] with the word.
[1:55:13] And if he doesn't answer the first day,
[1:55:15] go back the second day. Daniel prayed an
[1:55:18] awful long time before he got the angel
[1:55:20] to him. There's other battles that are
[1:55:22] going on. Amen.
[1:55:26] Wait on him.
[1:55:28] Wait on him.
[1:55:30] We open with this. We'll close with it.
[1:55:33] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:55:36] God, they are the sons of God. Brother
[1:55:39] Abraham says, "He that hath an ear, let
[1:55:41] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:55:42] churches." How tragic it is that the
[1:55:45] first age did not listen to the spirit.
[1:55:47] Instead, it listen to man. But thank
[1:55:49] God, in the last age, there will be a
[1:55:51] group that will rise up, the true bride
[1:55:53] of the last day, and she will listen to
[1:55:56] the spirit. In that day of gross
[1:55:59] darkness, the light will return by the
[1:56:01] pure word and we will return to the
[1:56:04] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:56:07] Lord Jesus Christ. Church, that can only
[1:56:10] happen to sons and daughters of God.
[1:56:12] That's a promise that's only for the
[1:56:14] children of God. But I was reading
[1:56:17] something this week on Balum that a a
[1:56:19] minister had preached recently. And you
[1:56:21] look at Balum. Balam had God's word,
[1:56:23] which was God's will. But you notice
[1:56:24] Balum refused it. He was anointed by the
[1:56:27] spirit of God to speak thus sayeth the
[1:56:29] Lord. But he kept going back to try and
[1:56:32] get God to adjust or moderate or
[1:56:34] manipulate his will so that it would
[1:56:36] work out better for Balum. He kept
[1:56:39] trying to find a way to make it good for
[1:56:40] him without obviously contradicting
[1:56:43] God's will. And God had told him,
[1:56:45] "Balam, you can't go and curse Israel.
[1:56:47] They are my people. I've blessed them.
[1:56:49] And you can't curse what God has
[1:56:50] blessed. You can't do it." And Baal kept
[1:56:53] going and going. And the preacher said
[1:56:54] this, and it struck me. He said, "Balam
[1:56:57] was a real prophet, but he wasn't a true
[1:57:00] prophet.
[1:57:02] He was a real prophet. He had a real
[1:57:03] gift, a real calling, a real anointing,
[1:57:05] but he wasn't obedient to God in his
[1:57:08] personal life." Amen. And God's looking
[1:57:10] for sons and daughters that will be true
[1:57:12] to his word, not trying to manipulate it
[1:57:15] for their own benefit.
[1:57:18] Listen to this. He says, "The true
[1:57:19] church of Christ, the bride, is soul
[1:57:22] sold out to him and his promised word
[1:57:24] till the very mind that's in Christ is
[1:57:27] in you." What a difference. What is it?
[1:57:30] Not my will, but thine be done. Balam
[1:57:32] wanted his wanted to fit his will inside
[1:57:35] of God's will. God never promised that.
[1:57:40] Amen. But he was willing in the end to
[1:57:43] work outside of God's will, too. That's
[1:57:44] what you see is when you're trying to
[1:57:45] force yourself in, you're always usually
[1:57:48] willing to go outside of his will. And
[1:57:50] Balam, when push came to shove, he said,
[1:57:52] "God, if you're not going to give it to
[1:57:53] me, I'm going to take it." And he tried
[1:57:55] to do that. Amen. And so he tried it his
[1:57:58] way and it didn't work. I mean, he went
[1:58:00] there and Bao set up everything the way
[1:58:01] he told him. They set up altars and
[1:58:03] sacrifices, but when Balam spoke, he was
[1:58:05] still a real prophet. And he could only
[1:58:07] say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, according
[1:58:09] to truth." And so he blessed Israel time
[1:58:11] and time again. And Bale got bail got so
[1:58:13] mad at him. The king, I'm paying you to
[1:58:15] curse them and all you do is bless. He
[1:58:16] says, I can only say what God puts in my
[1:58:18] mouth. But what happened after the
[1:58:21] spirit of prophecy left him?
[1:58:25] What did he say then? He told Bao, he
[1:58:27] says, "Listen, I can't curse them, but
[1:58:30] God will judge them if they do these
[1:58:32] things." He says, "Here's how you get
[1:58:34] them." And he told them how to lead them
[1:58:35] into idolatry and sexual impurity and
[1:58:37] those different things. And Balam caused
[1:58:39] them to be judged.
[1:58:42] He caused God to judge Israel. But in
[1:58:44] the end, Israel got him back and they
[1:58:46] killed him in battle. Didn't work out
[1:58:48] well for Balam. A real gift,
[1:58:51] not a real prophet, not a true prophet.
[1:58:54] Amen. He was so busy cashing in on the
[1:58:57] gift, he forgot about the giftgiver. He
[1:58:59] forgot who had made him that way, who
[1:59:00] had ordained him that way, who had
[1:59:02] called him that way. And in doing so, he
[1:59:03] chose a path that he thought would work
[1:59:05] out best for him. and all it ended in
[1:59:07] was his own death. And he wasn't
[1:59:09] anything after that. As as people, as
[1:59:12] humans, we tend to want these great
[1:59:14] gifts.
[1:59:16] We tend to want to have a big impact. We
[1:59:17] want to we want to do great things. And
[1:59:19] it's not wrong to do that. Paul said,
[1:59:20] "Cove the greatest gifts." He says, "But
[1:59:23] I show you a more excellent way. I show
[1:59:26] you a more excellent way." Brother Brown
[1:59:28] would say this. He says, "The real gift
[1:59:31] is your soul." Down in there. See, that
[1:59:34] was born of God.
[1:59:37] If you don't have a soul that comes from
[1:59:39] God,
[1:59:41] we can pour gallons of oil on you. We
[1:59:43] can baptize you every single day of your
[1:59:45] life, lay hands on you, and it won't do
[1:59:48] a lick of good. At best, it'll turn you
[1:59:51] religious, but it won't make you a child
[1:59:53] of God. He says the real gift is your
[1:59:55] soul down in there. See, that was born
[1:59:57] of God, and that controls the whole
[2:00:00] thing to the word of God and the will of
[2:00:02] God. He says, ' And there you grow up
[2:00:04] then. See, and then you're a son and a
[2:00:07] daughter of God. You're a child of God.
[2:00:09] That's the difference between a real
[2:00:10] Christian and a religious person. Is
[2:00:13] that a real Christian can surrender
[2:00:16] themselves to the word of God and the
[2:00:18] will of God.
[2:00:21] That's it.
[2:00:23] And how is it? It's because there's an
[2:00:25] eternal life inside of them. It's not a
[2:00:28] put on. It's not a robe of Christianity.
[2:00:30] It's not a jacket of Christianity, but
[2:00:32] it's something on the inside. And that
[2:00:34] comes from God in the very beginning.
[2:00:35] Listen, we make our mistakes.
[2:00:38] This isn't about a perfect life. This is
[2:00:40] about a yielded life. That's what we're
[2:00:42] talking about. Sinless perfection
[2:00:44] happens to nobody on this earth. Christ
[2:00:46] already did that. And that's why we get
[2:00:49] his righteousness and he took on ours.
[2:00:51] We claim his. Amen. But I'll tell you
[2:00:53] this, for the believer, our trajectory
[2:00:55] is always upward by God's grace. If you
[2:00:58] ever look at data,
[2:01:00] data rarely goes perfectly in a curve.
[2:01:02] It's usually doing this. You know, it's
[2:01:03] going all over the place. But the vice's
[2:01:05] nodding his head. The engineers,
[2:01:07] statistitians know this. Anybody that's
[2:01:09] looked at data, but what happens is
[2:01:10] you're looking for the direction
[2:01:12] overall. And listen, there are days
[2:01:13] where I I'm going up and then all of a
[2:01:15] sudden I go down, but then the Lord
[2:01:17] picks me up and all of a sudden I'm
[2:01:18] going higher and then my flesh catches
[2:01:20] me and I But what's happening is the
[2:01:23] general trajectory is up because he's
[2:01:25] drawing me up. It's his work. It's not
[2:01:27] mine. And it's his strength. It's his
[2:01:28] word. It's his spirit that's drawing me
[2:01:30] up. Amen. I'm going to close with this
[2:01:32] scripture. We close out John 15. He
[2:01:35] says, "Herein as my father glorified
[2:01:37] that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be
[2:01:40] my disciples. As the father hath loved
[2:01:43] me, so have I loved you. Continue ye in
[2:01:46] my love. If you keep my commandments,
[2:01:49] you shall abide in my love." In other
[2:01:52] words, if you stay with my word, you'll
[2:01:54] stay in my love.
[2:01:56] Now, let's not make this into when I
[2:01:59] disobey, I'm out of God's love. No. But
[2:02:02] his love will be a little more
[2:02:04] disciplinary and a little less huggy and
[2:02:05] kissy.
[2:02:08] But if you can stay there, and that's
[2:02:10] the nature of the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:02:11] is to stay with the word, then you stay
[2:02:14] close.
[2:02:16] You have the joy of your salvation, not
[2:02:18] just the salvation, if I could put it
[2:02:20] that way.
[2:02:22] You don't lose the ooey gooies of it. Do
[2:02:25] you ever have a, you know, sometimes we
[2:02:26] take our spouses out and we go away for
[2:02:28] a weekend or a week and it's just us and
[2:02:30] our spouse and you come back and you're
[2:02:31] just like, man, I just love her. I just
[2:02:34] love him. He's so good. He's so great.
[2:02:37] What is it? That closeness, that
[2:02:38] intimacy with no kids running around and
[2:02:40] no distractions and you don't have to
[2:02:42] cook supper for the wives and you don't
[2:02:44] have to make the bed and and he doesn't
[2:02:46] have to worry about work and all these
[2:02:47] things. It's just spend, spend, spend
[2:02:49] and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. You come back
[2:02:51] and you feel so connected.
[2:02:53] Only two wives are smiling. Brothers, we
[2:02:55] need to do better.
[2:03:01] Right?
[2:03:03] Sometimes we lose the joy of marriage.
[2:03:06] Don't lose the love, but we lose the
[2:03:08] joy. It can be the same thing in our
[2:03:10] relationship with Christ. When we know
[2:03:11] we're doing what we ought not to do,
[2:03:15] does he stop loving us?
[2:03:18] No. But our conscience is bothering us.
[2:03:20] And so we're sitting over on the side
[2:03:21] saying, "Yeah, he probably doesn't want
[2:03:22] to spend time with me now cuz I'm not a
[2:03:25] good wife."
[2:03:27] He says, "Stay with my word.
[2:03:30] It works. It'll keep us close."
[2:03:35] He said, "If you keep my commandments,
[2:03:37] if you keep my word, you shall abide in
[2:03:38] my love, even as I have kept my father's
[2:03:41] commandments and abide in his love.
[2:03:43] These things have I spoken unto you that
[2:03:46] my joy right might remain in you and
[2:03:49] that your joy might be full. Amen. God
[2:03:53] bless you. Let's stand if we would.
[2:03:57] Amen.
[2:03:58] What's the purpose of abiding in Christ?
[2:04:02] What's the what's the end result there?
[2:04:04] He says that your joy might remain.
[2:04:09] There's a joy you have. How many
[2:04:10] remember the day they gave their heart
[2:04:12] to the Lord? the joy that was there.
[2:04:14] Isn't that I mean I I'll never forget
[2:04:16] it. I'll never forget it. It was the the
[2:04:18] the the most amazing day of my life. Far
[2:04:22] and away. Nothing else compares to that
[2:04:25] moment where you realized he's accepted
[2:04:27] me. He's cleansed me. He's forgiven me.
[2:04:31] I felt like I could float on air. Felt
[2:04:34] like I could run or fly a million miles
[2:04:35] an hour. There's a joy there. But he
[2:04:38] says, I want the joy to remain.
[2:04:42] Not just come and go. I want to remain.
[2:04:43] Not only that your joy remain, but your
[2:04:45] joy will be full.
[2:04:48] You'll be topped up with joy. Amen.
[2:04:51] Lasting joy. He doesn't say happiness.
[2:04:54] He says joy. Joy is eternal,
[2:04:57] supernatural happiness. That even in our
[2:04:59] trials, we can say I'm still happy.
[2:05:03] I still have a satisfaction. And I still
[2:05:05] have a contentment because I've got him
[2:05:07] with me and I'm talking to him daily and
[2:05:09] he walks with me and he talks with me
[2:05:11] and he tells me I'm his own as the song
[2:05:14] says. It's that day-to-day relationship
[2:05:16] that keeps us going. Listen, my wife and
[2:05:18] I, life is not always great in the
[2:05:20] Kurlet house. We have days of stress. We
[2:05:23] have days of financial hardship. We have
[2:05:24] cars breaking down left, right, and
[2:05:26] center. We have sick kids. We have sick
[2:05:28] dogs.
[2:05:29] We have sleepless nights. All these
[2:05:32] things. But boy, if we spend that bit of
[2:05:34] time together, the joy stays with it.
[2:05:39] And it doesn't take much.
[2:05:42] It doesn't take much. When I get up in
[2:05:44] the morning, I kind of do the rounds.
[2:05:45] Usually the boys are on the couch and
[2:05:46] the dogs there. So, I kind of go around
[2:05:48] and I ruffle their heads, give him a
[2:05:49] hug, tell Biscuit he's a good dog, even
[2:05:51] though he's not. And then I go to my
[2:05:52] wife. But you know where I spend the
[2:05:54] most time? With my wife.
[2:05:57] I put my arms around and I hug her and I
[2:05:59] ask her how her sleep was and how did
[2:06:01] the boys do through the night. because I
[2:06:02] don't hear any of it usually.
[2:06:04] And what do I do? I connect with her
[2:06:06] first thing.
[2:06:08] And that's to help settle our day in
[2:06:11] unity.
[2:06:13] I love you. You're important to me. I'm
[2:06:17] here to help you. I'm here to support
[2:06:18] you. I care about you. And it sets the
[2:06:21] tone for the day. And listen, if we do
[2:06:24] that and just spend those little
[2:06:26] minutes, it means that when friction
[2:06:28] comes up, it means when when when issues
[2:06:30] pop up,
[2:06:32] we're okay to come and say, "Hey, can I
[2:06:34] talk? Hey, we need to talk about
[2:06:36] something. We need to deal with
[2:06:36] something." Okay, the joy is still
[2:06:38] there. The love's still there. The
[2:06:40] feeling's still there to take us into
[2:06:42] each other's presence without ripping
[2:06:43] each other's throats out. Otherwise,
[2:06:45] what do we do? We get into business
[2:06:47] transactions.
[2:06:49] We're partners,
[2:06:51] not spouses. That's what he's saying
[2:06:53] here. He's saying, "Your joy might be
[2:06:56] full." So that when we feel we're under
[2:07:00] attack, we've got something to draw
[2:07:02] from.
[2:07:04] We've spent time in his presence, we've
[2:07:06] been refreshed, we know there's a place
[2:07:08] we can go and we can just step aside and
[2:07:11] say, "Lord, top up the joy tank a little
[2:07:14] more. Lord, I'm going through it today,
[2:07:18] this month, this year, this decade,
[2:07:21] whatever it is. Say, Lord, keep my joy
[2:07:23] full. Let your spirit refresh me. Let me
[2:07:26] be in your presence so we can connect
[2:07:28] again cuz I'm not feeling it right now.
[2:07:31] And he's always willing to do that. He's
[2:07:33] always willing to do it. He's always got
[2:07:35] time for his bride. Amen. Amen. God
[2:07:38] bless you. There's no place you can get
[2:07:40] it outside of him.
[2:07:42] I spent some time yesterday going
[2:07:43] through my notes, pages after pages, and
[2:07:46] I've cut it down to 10 more pages of
[2:07:49] notes. So, I've got 13 here today, but
[2:07:52] that's not just quotes and scriptures.
[2:07:54] So, one maybe two more services, and
[2:07:57] then we're going to move on by God's
[2:07:58] grace. So, hang in there with me. We'll
[2:08:00] see where the Lord would lead, but uh
[2:08:02] we're coming close to the end of this.
[2:08:03] Certainly, by November, we should be
[2:08:05] into a new set of series. Amen. God
[2:08:08] bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:08:11] Father,
[2:08:12] Lord, what a joy it is. What a rest it
[2:08:14] is to know there's a place of comfort.
[2:08:16] Lord, a pa place of strength, a place
[2:08:19] where we can go when we've given all we
[2:08:21] can. When we're worn out and rung out
[2:08:23] and frustrated and anxious and Lord,
[2:08:26] just frazzled so many times. Lord, when
[2:08:28] our emotions get the better of us, when
[2:08:30] situations seem to overwhelm us. Lord,
[2:08:32] David said, "Lead me to the rock that's
[2:08:34] higher than I that can lift us up above
[2:08:36] it." Lord, we're under an eagle
[2:08:38] anointing in this last age, Lord. And it
[2:08:40] lifts us, Lord. The winds of this life,
[2:08:43] they lift us up, Lord. They raise us
[2:08:46] closer to you and into your presence.
[2:08:48] Lord, I pray you help us to seek after
[2:08:50] you day by day. Lord, there's a rest,
[2:08:53] there's a joy, there's a peace, there's
[2:08:55] a love that surpasses all of our
[2:08:57] understanding, Lord, to take us through
[2:08:59] this daily walk that we face. Lord, help
[2:09:02] us to seek after you, Lord, as the young
[2:09:04] people sang. Lord, as the choir sang
[2:09:06] today, Lord, keep us desperate for you,
[2:09:09] Lord. And when we feel that thirst, when
[2:09:10] we feel something's off, when we feel
[2:09:12] like we're not quite where we ought to
[2:09:14] be, Lord, help us to go after the right
[2:09:16] thing, Lord. Not after screens and
[2:09:18] entertainment and all these different
[2:09:21] things, Lord, but let us go to that
[2:09:22] which satisfies our soul, Lord. That
[2:09:25] eternal on the internal, Lord, that's
[2:09:27] inside of us. I pray, Lord, strengthen
[2:09:29] us, Lord. Lift up weary hands, feeble
[2:09:32] knees. Lord, help us to stay in your
[2:09:35] word day by day. Lord, help us to seek
[2:09:37] your presence, your will, and your way.
[2:09:40] We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:09:42] it. Amen.
[2:09:46] Hear my prayer, O Lord. 8.87.
[2:09:52] Hear
[2:09:54] my
[2:09:56] prayer, O Lord.
[2:10:00] From the ends of the earth I cry.
[2:10:08] And your peace will lead me to
[2:10:14] the rock that is higher than I.
[2:10:19] For you have been my strength in times
[2:10:25] of trouble,
[2:10:27] a tower above
[2:10:30] my eneies.
[2:10:34] And Lord, I will abide with you
[2:10:40] forever
[2:10:43] in the shelter
[2:10:46] of your wings.
[2:10:51] So hear
[2:10:54] my
[2:10:55] prayer, oh Lord.
[2:11:00] From the ends of the earth I cry.
[2:11:08] Your peace will lead me to
[2:11:14] the rock that is higher than I.
[2:11:19] For you have been my strength in times
[2:11:24] of trouble.
[2:11:27] a tower above
[2:11:30] my enies.
[2:11:34] And Lord, I will abide with you
[2:11:40] forever
[2:11:43] in the shelter
[2:11:46] of your wings.
[2:11:51] So hear
[2:11:54] my
[2:11:56] prayer. Oh Lord,
[2:12:00] from the ends of the earth I cry.
[2:12:08] Your peace will lead me to
[2:12:14] the rock that is higher than I.
[2:12:20] For you have been my strength in times
[2:12:24] of trouble,
[2:12:27] a tower above
[2:12:30] my eneies
[2:12:34] and Lord I will abide with you
[2:12:40] forever
[2:12:43] in the shelter
[2:12:46] of your wings.
[2:12:50] Psalm 34, I sought the Lord. 1274,
[2:12:55] I sought the Lord
[2:13:00] and he answered me
[2:13:04] and delivered me
[2:13:08] from every fear.
[2:13:12] Those who look on him,
[2:13:17] our radant,
[2:13:20] they'll never be ashamed.
[2:13:24] They'll never be ashamed.
[2:13:28] And this poor man cried.
[2:13:33] And the Lord heard me
[2:13:37] and saved me from
[2:13:41] my eneies.
[2:13:45] The son of God
[2:13:49] surrounds his saints.
[2:13:52] He will deliver them.
[2:13:56] He will deliver them.
[2:14:01] Oh, magnify
[2:14:04] the Lord
[2:14:06] with me.
[2:14:09] Come exalt
[2:14:11] his name
[2:14:14] forever.

[2:14:46] who abides in him.

[2:15:06] Oh, magnify.
[2:15:14] Oh come exalt
[2:15:16] his name
[2:15:18] together
[2:15:22] glorify
[2:15:24] the Lord
[2:15:26] with me.
[2:15:30] Come exalt
[2:15:32] his name
[2:15:34] forever.
[2:15:39] Oh, taste and see
[2:15:43] that the Lord is good.
[2:15:47] Oh, blessed is he
[2:15:51] who hides in him.
[2:15:54] Oh, fear the Lord.
[2:15:58] Oh, all you saints.
[2:16:02] He'll give you everything.
[2:16:06] He'll give you everything.
[2:16:10] Oh, magnify
[2:16:13] the Lord

[2:19:41] Come exalt
[2:19:44] his name
[2:19:46] together.
[2:19:50] Oh, taste and see
[2:19:54] that the Lord is good.
[2:19:58] He'll give you everything.
[2:20:02] He'll give you everything.
[2:20:08] Amen.
[2:20:11] Going to sing one more song.
[2:20:14] Goodness of God 1271.
[2:20:17] Amen.
[2:20:19] I'm going to ask brother Vichel to close
[2:20:20] in prayer again if he would and then
[2:20:23] remember the Collins family. Remember
[2:20:25] Biscuit. We took him to the vet and came
[2:20:28] home with medications and a $517 bill,
[2:20:31] but he's doing better. Um just trusting
[2:20:34] the Lord to heal him completely. He's
[2:20:36] just an animal. I know that. But listen,
[2:20:38] God sent a possum to a prophet and he
[2:20:41] laid hands on him. He raised a fish that
[2:20:43] had its guts torn out from the dead.
[2:20:46] It's okay. Amen. But let's not forget
[2:20:48] the Collins family especially.
[2:20:51] Amen. Those that aren't here, I see
[2:20:53] Cassandra. Is Cassandra here today? I
[2:20:54] didn't see her. No, she's not here.
[2:20:56] Let's remember her. She bears a heavy
[2:20:58] burden. Church, she needs our prayers,
[2:21:00] our support as much as we can give it.
[2:21:02] Amen. And pray for each other. There's
[2:21:04] many things people are dealing with.
[2:21:07] Sickness, hardship, darkness,
[2:21:11] unending sometimes. Amen. We need to be
[2:21:14] praying for one another. Say, "Lord, lay
[2:21:16] someone on my heart." Amen. We thank the
[2:21:18] Lord that Sister Sarah Graham came
[2:21:20] through her surgery, trusting the Lord
[2:21:22] to continue to be with her. Help her to
[2:21:24] heal completely. My father as well.
[2:21:26] They're saying sometime between now and
[2:21:28] Tuesday, they keep waiting for an
[2:21:30] opening. They're monitoring him. Let's
[2:21:32] continue to pray for him. Amen. That the
[2:21:35] Lord would just touch his soul above all
[2:21:37] else. Amen. Amen. Let's uh sing this and
[2:21:41] brother Visha will come and close in
[2:21:43] prayer.
[2:21:46] I love you, Lord,
[2:21:51] and for your mercy never fails me.
[2:21:56] And all my days
[2:21:59] I've been held in your hands.
[2:22:04] From the moment that I wake up
[2:22:09] until I lay my head.
[2:22:12] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:22:17] of God.
[2:22:19] [Music]
[2:22:23] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:22:31] And all my life you have been so so
[2:22:36] good.
[2:22:38] With every breath that I am aable,
[2:22:44] oh I will sing of the goodness
[2:22:49] of God.
[2:22:52] I love your voice.
[2:22:57] You have led me through the fire
[2:23:02] in the darkest night.
[2:23:05] You are close like no other.
[2:23:10] I've known you as a father.
[2:23:14] I've known you as a friend.
[2:23:18] And I have lived in the goodness
[2:23:23] of God.
[2:23:28] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:23:36] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:23:43] With every breath that I am able.
[2:23:49] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:23:54] of God.
[2:23:59] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:24:07] And all my life you have been so so
[2:24:12] good.
[2:24:15] With every breath that I am able,
[2:24:20] oh I will sing of the goodness
[2:24:25] of God.
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:31] Goodness is running after. It's running
[2:24:34] after me.
[2:24:38] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:24:41] running after me.
[2:24:44] With my life laid down, I've surrendered
[2:24:48] now. I give you everything.
[2:24:53] And your goodness is running after. It's
[2:24:57] running after me.
[2:25:01] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:25:05] running after me.
[2:25:09] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:25:12] running after me. With my life laid
[2:25:17] down, I'm surrendered now. I give you
[2:25:21] everything.
[2:25:24] And your goodness is running after. It's
[2:25:28] running after me.
[2:25:32] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:25:40] And all my life you have been so so
[2:25:45] good.
[2:25:48] With every breath that I am able.
[2:25:53] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:25:58] of God.
[2:26:01] Just put up that third one, Selena, if
[2:26:03] you would. Your goodness is running
[2:26:06] after me. Remember we read that
[2:26:10] scripture in Jeremiah. He said, "My
[2:26:12] thoughts I have you towards you are
[2:26:14] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[2:26:17] bring you to an expected end." I said
[2:26:20] last service, why does he say not of
[2:26:22] evil? Because so often it looks like
[2:26:24] it's not for our good. It hurts, drags
[2:26:28] us down, wearies us out.
[2:26:33] But his goodness, he said, all things
[2:26:36] work together for the good of them who
[2:26:40] are the called according to his purpose.
[2:26:45] So you say, "I'm trying to get away from
[2:26:47] this."
[2:26:49] Say, "Lord, let your goodness come out
[2:26:51] of it."
[2:26:52] That's when it'll be over is when you
[2:26:54] see his goodness. And you'll be able to
[2:26:56] see that no matter what happens, his
[2:26:58] goodness is chasing me. Whether it feels
[2:27:01] good or not, whether it looks good or
[2:27:02] not, whether I can see the good or not,
[2:27:05] his goodness is chasing after me because
[2:27:07] it's trying, not trying, it will produce
[2:27:11] a bride of Jesus Christ that is holy,
[2:27:14] unblameable, unreprovable
[2:27:17] in his sight. That's what's happening
[2:27:20] day by day.
[2:27:22] His goodness is chasing after you.
[2:27:25] How do you get a good kid? You chase
[2:27:28] after him with the things that'll make
[2:27:30] him good. You keep working on him. And
[2:27:33] it's his goodness that keeps him working
[2:27:36] on us. Amen. His goodness is running us
[2:27:38] down. It's about time we stopped and
[2:27:41] said, "Lord, I surrender. I want to be
[2:27:43] good. I want your goodness, not just
[2:27:46] what I think is best for me." Amen.
[2:27:49] Let's sing that chorus just one more
[2:27:50] time. The the main chorus if you would,
[2:27:52] Selena, as brother Vasha would come. And
[2:27:56] all my life you have been faithful.
[2:28:04] And all my life you have been so so
[2:28:09] good.
[2:28:11] With every breath that I am able.
[2:28:17] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:28:22] of God. One more time as he comes.
[2:28:27] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:28:34] And all my life you have been so so
[2:28:39] good.
[2:28:42] With every breath that I am able.
[2:28:48] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:28:52] of God.
