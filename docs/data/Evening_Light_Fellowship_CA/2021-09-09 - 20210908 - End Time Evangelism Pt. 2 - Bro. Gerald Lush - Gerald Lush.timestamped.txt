[1:01:09] and by the grace of god we'll try to get
[1:01:11] through some of these notes here and
[1:01:13] maybe touch on some things in the
[1:01:15] message that brother branham preached in
[1:01:18] 1962
[1:01:20] concerning the end time evangelism
[1:01:23] what he was focusing on what god was
[1:01:25] focusing on and are we focusing on the
[1:01:28] same thing
[1:01:29] amen i believe that we ought to because
[1:01:32] there are those that feel anytime
[1:01:34] evangelism is this is sad something else
[1:01:37] but the problem of god clearly
[1:01:38] identifies
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:41] that the end time evangelism for the
[1:01:43] bride for the elect is to get us into a
[1:01:46] resurrection and a rapturing faith amen
[1:01:49] and for god to bring to pass the promise
[1:01:52] of the resurrection amen the promise of
[1:01:55] the rapture
[1:01:56] do we truly sincerely honestly believe
[1:02:00] amen that there is a resurrection

[1:02:06] believe that there is a rapture

[1:02:33] into a church that's preaching it
[1:02:34] constantly but nothing to really truly
[1:02:37] in your heart believe it amen that's
[1:02:39] what god is working on brother is to
[1:02:41] bring of that faith in in the heart of
[1:02:44] the bride brother i i trust we are the
[1:02:47] right
[1:02:48] amen and that what god has worked on god

[1:03:09] generation to have that generation that
[1:03:11] generation amen he gave them the word

[1:03:16] out the faith amen he has given us the
[1:03:19] word he's given us amen the message but

[1:12:39] away from it oh
[1:12:42] he's with you morning noon and night
[1:12:44] every day you can't for forget him if
[1:12:47] you're like i said if you're driving
[1:12:48] your car and you're going down the
[1:12:50] street and you're doing no matter how
[1:12:51] busy it is you can't forget jesus
[1:12:54] and like i said i drove do i drive and
[1:12:56] drive and drive and i'm doing this doing
[1:12:58] that you're coming down to a light oh
[1:13:00] but again there's a spiritual revelation
[1:13:02] strikes your heart you can't get away
[1:13:04] from it
[1:13:06] can't get away from it
[1:13:08] no if he's in control
[1:13:10] amen your thoughts your words your dates
[1:13:13] amen are going to be influenced by him
[1:13:16] god help us that we're not living for
[1:13:18] ourselves we're living for jesus
[1:13:20] it's not me that lives it's christ that
[1:13:22] lives in me
[1:13:24] that's tremendous
[1:13:25] brother's a challenge
[1:13:27] no wonder the place the prophet of god
[1:13:29] has said he said when it comes to the
[1:13:30] rapture
[1:13:33] and then and that sister said brother
[1:13:35] branham what if god asked you to
[1:13:37] pick to choose to choose
[1:13:38] the bride you had to go into rapture and
[1:13:40] so on he said i might find it doesn't
[1:13:44] it doesn't yeah and again there's
[1:13:46] another quote right there somewhere
[1:13:48] where is this where they asking all
[1:13:50] about you know how many is going to go
[1:13:51] into rapture he said it might be that
[1:13:53] was in 1962 i think he said there might
[1:13:55] be 500
[1:13:57] they said 500
[1:13:59] yeah 500 around the world
[1:14:02] well is that scriptural yes
[1:14:05] even less than that
[1:14:07] because he did as he got near the end of
[1:14:09] his ministry he got down to the place
[1:14:11] where he said oh oh no there might be
[1:14:13] this 200 300 there might be this and so
[1:14:16] on just a few
[1:14:18] why is that scriptural yes
[1:14:20] what scripture is it
[1:14:22] the bible says when the son of man comes
[1:14:24] will he find faith
[1:14:25] on the earth that's right
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:30] why it's going to be why because the
[1:14:32] devil is going to have such control and
[1:14:34] there's going to be such unbelief how
[1:14:35] many really believe i trust by god by
[1:14:38] grace that you're believing here
[1:14:41] in the name of jesus you're believing in
[1:14:43] your heart in your soul amen that it oh
[1:14:46] it's it's a real anointing a real holy
[1:14:49] ghost faith
[1:14:50] brother you can't get away from it's
[1:14:52] there
[1:14:53] morning new tonight you can't get away
[1:14:54] from jesus do you think about him oh
[1:14:56] yeah and people oh yeah
[1:14:58] brother the world going to call you
[1:15:00] fanatical
[1:15:01] oh yeah praise the lord i trust by grace
[1:15:04] you'll recognize yourself as being
[1:15:06] fanatical in the eyes in the eyes of the
[1:15:07] world why because you're you're
[1:15:09] spiritual
[1:15:10] you're spiritual
[1:15:12] amen because most of the world is just
[1:15:14] religious or they talk about jesus and
[1:15:16] they'll they'll talk about this and that
[1:15:18] but they're not spiritual they're just
[1:15:20] religious
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:22] oh so i pray the grace of god that we
[1:15:25] are spiritual and brother we just can't
[1:15:27] get away from it christ in us christ in
[1:15:29] control christ living christ making the

[1:36:48] vision that he seeth is for many days to

[1:39:19] not in this fleshly body for sure
[1:39:21] amen but we're going back by grace of
[1:39:24] god so brother it's way

[1:39:28] back to eternity and from eternity comes
[1:39:30] right on that oh thank god i pray grace
[1:39:33] that we can we can trace
[1:39:35] our experience
[1:39:37] right on back to eternity
[1:39:39] amen or we can go back to eternity and
[1:39:41] see what god has done all down through
[1:39:43] the angels all down through this through
[1:39:45] the centuries and see what god has done
[1:39:47] oh yeah praise the lord
[1:39:49] we're not over here we're not over there
[1:39:51] no no
[1:39:52] what god god did this did this oh i just
[1:39:54] line right up with the word
[1:39:57] i line right up with the plan and
[1:39:58] purpose of god
[1:40:00] lining right up with the will of god
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] brother we know that it's the devil
[1:40:06] that makes the confusion
[1:40:09] amen because again
[1:40:16] this is god
[1:40:18] amen
[1:40:19] and this is as it were the alpha
[1:40:21] and the omega but it was the enemy that
[1:40:23] come when god when god still had a word
[1:40:25] here had a word there had an idea had a
[1:40:27] thought amen no leave it the way god
[1:40:30] makes it
[1:40:31] leave it the way that god does it leave
[1:40:33] it the way that god reveals it
[1:40:35] amen don't and don't let the enemy come
[1:40:38] into your mind and put this thought in
[1:40:40] it that's all in another song
[1:40:42] brother
[1:40:43] leave it leave it with the word
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:46] because it's it's god said this god said
[1:40:48] this god said this and the enemy comes
[1:40:50] down as he did in the garden of eden but
[1:40:52] and goes off and it had it right on down
[1:40:56] through even for the jews and now
[1:40:58] especially down for the gentiles down
[1:41:00] through those seven church ages
[1:41:02] that the enemy has come in and say yeah
[1:41:04] yeah as god said but
[1:41:06] and they go off to that church age and
[1:41:08] it goes on down again yeah god said but
[1:41:11] amen it goes off to another church age
[1:41:13] yeah
[1:41:14] because
[1:41:15] these are the church ages these are the
[1:41:17] messengers and basically the message and
[1:41:20] so on of what god god is revealing but
[1:41:22] the enemy wants to add to it or take
[1:41:24] from it
[1:41:25] and brother what he'll do he'll all
[1:41:27] he'll do he'll add maybe a word just one
[1:41:29] word change a little here add a little
[1:41:30] there amen nothing big about it and of
[1:41:33] course when you when you get off when
[1:41:36] you get off the enemy when and the more
[1:41:38] the more that he goes out
[1:41:40] you know
[1:41:40] or you can he can lead you off that way
[1:41:42] and he only only changed maybe a word or
[1:41:44] two here and there and so on but then he
[1:41:47] gets out there and he oh oh oh oh and
[1:41:50] he'll change a lot of words
[1:41:52] and that's why we got these uh
[1:41:54] all
[1:41:56] what they call them out there
[1:41:58] when it comes to religion all the
[1:42:00] different the groups
[1:42:03] and and they believe this they believe
[1:42:04] that all mine
[1:42:06] but they got so much added to it it's
[1:42:07] absolutely amazing
[1:42:09] you know so we pray the grace of god
[1:42:11] that we stay with the word god brings us
[1:42:14] back in line say with the word stay with
[1:42:16] the word amen where we come from that's
[1:42:19] what we're going back by grace
[1:42:21] amen
[1:42:22] so brothers keep keep in line with the
[1:42:26] word of god
[1:42:28] amen again the scripture said
[1:42:32] yeah verse 18 it said though these three
[1:42:35] men were in it as i live saith the lord
[1:42:38] god they shall deliver neither sons nor
[1:42:40] daughters but they only shall be
[1:42:42] delivered themselves
[1:42:45] or if i send a pestilence into that land
[1:42:48] and pour out my fury upon it in blood to
[1:42:51] cut off from it man and beast and though
[1:42:54] noah daniel and job were in it as i
[1:42:57] lived saith the lord god they should
[1:42:59] deliver neither son or daughter they
[1:43:01] shall but deliver their own souls
[1:43:05] by their righteousness for for us it's
[1:43:07] not our righteousness
[1:43:09] and it is because imputed to us
[1:43:11] and according to our faith it is the
[1:43:13] righteousness of jesus
[1:43:14] amen imputed to us
[1:43:17] for thus saith the lord god how much
[1:43:19] more when i send my four sword judgments
[1:43:22] upon jerusalem the sword and the famine
[1:43:25] and the noisome pestil are beasts
[1:43:28] and
[1:43:29] the pestilence to cut off from it man
[1:43:32] and beast
[1:43:33] yet behold therein shall be left a
[1:43:35] remnant that shall be brought forth both
[1:43:38] sons and daughters thank god
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:42] he said you won't bring them but i will
[1:43:46] thank god
[1:43:48] and he said they shall come forth
[1:43:51] unto you and ye shall see their way and
[1:43:53] their doings and ye shall be comforted
[1:43:56] concerning the evil that i have brought
[1:43:58] upon jerusalem even concerning all that
[1:44:01] i have brought upon it and they shall
[1:44:03] comfort you
[1:44:04] when ye see there
[1:44:06] oh
[1:44:09] ezekiel 12 i was reading ezekiel 14.
[1:44:12] maybe the lord
[1:44:14] led me to read it for somebody here
[1:44:17] or somebody online
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:20] and ye shall be comforted concerning the
[1:44:22] evil that i have brought unto jerus upon
[1:44:24] jerusalem even concerning all that i
[1:44:27] have brought upon it and they shall
[1:44:28] comfort you when ye shall see their ways
[1:44:32] and their doings and ye shall know that
[1:44:34] i have not done without cause
[1:44:36] all that i have done in it saith the
[1:44:38] lord god amen god has got a reason to do
[1:44:42] what he what he does
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:46] again the word of the lord came on verse
[1:44:48] 26
[1:44:49] of
[1:44:50] ezekiel 12.
[1:44:54] he said in verse 25 i am the lord i will
[1:44:58] speak
[1:44:59] and the word that i shall speak shall
[1:45:00] come to pass and it shall no more
[1:45:03] prolong
[1:45:04] for in your days o rebellious house will
[1:45:06] i say the word and will perform it saith
[1:45:09] the lord god
[1:45:11] and again the word of the lord came unto
[1:45:12] me saying son of man be o they of the
[1:45:15] house of israel say the vision that he
[1:45:18] seeth is for many days to come and he
[1:45:21] prophesied of the times that are far off
[1:45:23] therefore say unto them thus saith the
[1:45:26] lord god there shall none of my words be
[1:45:29] prolonged anymore
[1:45:31] but the word which i have spoken shall
[1:45:33] be done
[1:45:34] saith the lord god amen brother god just
[1:45:38] keeps on going and brother down the end
[1:45:41] amen it's finished
[1:45:43] it is finished
[1:45:47] i'll just share with you some
[1:45:49] notes or thoughts
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:55] already been an hour over an hour maybe
[1:45:59] but i think sufficient has been said
[1:46:03] in the way of a foundation to lead us
[1:46:05] into what the prophet said in his
[1:46:08] message on end-time evangelism
[1:46:12] brother we think sometimes it's all
[1:46:13] let's let's send the preachers out to to
[1:46:16] the to this country that country there
[1:46:18] there there see if we can find the last
[1:46:20] predestinated seed no
[1:46:22] that's not the end time evangelism for
[1:46:24] the bride as i quoted i believe during
[1:46:27] the last message the last sermon that
[1:46:30] the power of god did say
[1:46:32] he said now he said they're going to
[1:46:33] take
[1:46:34] the gospel of jesus and bait the basic
[1:46:37] gospel of jesus and go to the whole
[1:46:38] world
[1:46:39] but he said this message is for the
[1:46:41] bride only amen it is for the elect only
[1:46:44] amen because many are called but few are
[1:46:47] chosen
[1:46:49] so brother we yes we pray and we commit
[1:46:51] all the other ministries in into the
[1:46:53] hands of god and praying the grace of
[1:46:55] god for for this for this country and
[1:46:58] that country yes but our focus is mainly
[1:47:01] right now on the bride
[1:47:03] it is on the resurrection it is on the
[1:47:05] rapture
[1:47:06] by the grace of almighty god
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:11] so brother when it comes to the ministry
[1:47:12] to the bride the the message ministry
[1:47:15] this this ought to be the emphasis
[1:47:18] of
[1:47:19] the ministry
[1:47:21] the resurrection and the rapture
[1:47:25] considering lord brother sister the hour
[1:47:26] that we're living considering what god
[1:47:28] has done considering what god is doing
[1:47:31] what are we to be preaching
[1:47:33] for the bride resurrection
[1:47:35] rapture
[1:47:36] amen we ought to be focusing on the
[1:47:38] resurrection and the rapture because
[1:47:40] that's what well that's what god's
[1:47:42] waiting on now
[1:47:44] that's what the the elect of god that
[1:47:46] are going on amen
[1:47:48] and they're waiting on us to come to
[1:47:49] that faith
[1:47:51] brother
[1:47:52] lazarus was waiting on jesus to call it
[1:47:54] back and he came back praise the lord so
[1:47:57] now he's waiting on us christ in you
[1:48:00] christ in in the bride amen for the
[1:48:03] resurrection and the rapture amen by the
[1:48:05] grace of god because the power of god
[1:48:08] was one time
[1:48:10] and i think it was only one time that he
[1:48:12] had that experience that that he was he
[1:48:15] was
[1:48:15] in his in basically lying in his bed
[1:48:18] and he and he just he was looking that
[1:48:20] way and oh
[1:48:22] then all of a sudden
[1:48:24] he broke into eternity
[1:48:26] the vision broke and he began to see
[1:48:28] this and see this and see that
[1:48:30] and he found himself as it were going
[1:48:33] right into eternity but yet he looked
[1:48:35] back and saw him so he could see his own
[1:48:37] his physical body on the bed
[1:48:39] oh yeah but yet he turned around oh
[1:48:43] who are these
[1:48:45] oh my and he was looking at this this
[1:48:47] group of people that group of people and
[1:48:49] some were somewhere from
[1:48:51] other other church ages and they were
[1:48:54] fellowshipping with one another
[1:48:55] those that were from the different ages
[1:48:57] and then it's then he looked and he saw
[1:48:59] those over there and those over there
[1:49:01] and they were from the the age in which
[1:49:03] he was living the age in which you and i
[1:49:04] are living and they were fellowshipping
[1:49:06] one another
[1:49:07] and the angel
[1:49:09] did say to brother branham they said oh
[1:49:12] do you see that woman there
[1:49:13] yes
[1:49:14] always said do you and she only looked
[1:49:17] to she only looked to be maybe in her
[1:49:19] 20 22 two years old something like that
[1:49:22] and uh he said do you know he said no
[1:49:25] he's i don't know her oh he said she was
[1:49:27] 95 years old we said when you let her to
[1:49:30] the lord he said what
[1:49:32] yes she was 95. of course and again
[1:49:35] brother when we when we go out of time
[1:49:37] and into eternity you're not going to
[1:49:38] find no old people when it comes to when
[1:49:41] i say old people you're going to find
[1:49:42] someone oh they're gray hair and oh my
[1:49:45] they're all old with
[1:49:47] wrinkles and everything no no
[1:49:49] no
[1:49:50] because we're going to be young
[1:49:52] the bible tells us no no
[1:49:54] no if enough days nor an old person that
[1:49:56] haven't fulfilled their days
[1:49:58] no
[1:49:59] no not by any means and like
[1:50:01] if if when when if the lord takes takes
[1:50:04] the one of these young people home and
[1:50:06] into eternity oh
[1:50:09] when they get into eternity they're into
[1:50:10] it they're into a body around maybe 20
[1:50:12] years old
[1:50:14] oh yeah and if your great-grandma your
[1:50:16] grandpa or whatever

[1:50:50] immortal will stand in his likeness the
[1:50:52] sun and the stars to shine
[1:50:54] by the grace of god brother end time

[1:51:16] all the way he did this he did that with
[1:51:17] the opening of the word the mystery of

[1:51:22] it it was to give us faith for the
[1:51:24] resurrection and the rapture

[1:51:29] was to give them the faith for like for
[1:51:31] the different
[1:51:32] messages that that god was revealing

[1:59:48] it will be
[1:59:49] maybe the last week of uh
[1:59:52] this month that we'll be maybe trying to

[2:00:32] lot of things
[2:00:33] so grace to us
[2:00:35] as as we plan to travel by grace
[2:00:40] so let me say that sufficient has been
[2:00:42] said to help us distinguish between
[2:00:44] beginning evangelism
[2:00:46] middle of the day evangelism and end
[2:00:49] time evangelism
[2:00:52] it has progressed from prophets
[2:00:55] into the god prophet
[2:00:57] for the redemption of our souls
[2:01:00] and since the day of pentecost it has
[2:01:02] progressed from god
[2:01:04] the god prophet
[2:01:05] into the church age messengers
[2:01:08] forming up into the body of the logos
[2:01:11] word bride
[2:01:13] for the redemption of our bodies brother
[2:01:16] beginning back in the first age and even
[2:01:19] our lord jesus christ the redemption of
[2:01:21] our souls amen
[2:01:23] and on down through the last age
[2:01:25] the revelation of our lord jesus christ
[2:01:27] for the redemption of our bodies
[2:01:30] amen
[2:01:32] amen we've been changed inward inside
[2:01:34] now god's going to change us outside
[2:01:36] amen and also bring forth others into
[2:01:39] the resurrection of glorified bodies
[2:01:42] so god help us brother to understand
[2:01:45] that end time evangelism
[2:01:47] has to do with what god is doing in the
[2:01:50] end time
[2:01:51] amen

[2:02:27] and it is to restore the faith

[2:02:47] with a good sharp tool
