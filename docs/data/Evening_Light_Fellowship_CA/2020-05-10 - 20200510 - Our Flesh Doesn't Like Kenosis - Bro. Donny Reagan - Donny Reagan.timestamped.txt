[52:02] I mentioned just a moment but first I
[52:05] want to bring greetings to the Saints
[52:07] from our brother dawn snow he called a
[52:10] couple of days ago because a brother in
[52:14] two states that we're playing to come
[52:16] there and here in May and June called
[52:19] him and of course it's canceled because
[52:23] of what's going on and he can't come out
[52:27] of the states into Canada and he can't
[52:29] come from anywhere else in Canada to
[52:31] Newfoundland and so it's been canceled
[52:35] and right now I understand that the
[52:37] weekend he's ministering to somewhere in
[52:38] the southern United States our brother
[52:41] Glover so god bless him and brother Dom
[52:45] wanted to send his greetings to the
[52:46] Saints here as well amen so we had a
[52:49] wonderful time of fellowship on the

[53:13] what we're experiencing shutdowns and

[53:30] with sister Beverly and he told her he
[53:34] said well he said the world will never

[53:40] different and he said listen and he said
[53:42] the generation if there's another
[53:44] generation rises up he said they won't
[53:47] be able to identify with the world we
[53:49] lived in they won't they won't know
[53:51] anything about it and that's the truth
[53:52] and of course we know that it's it is
[53:55] going to get worse amen
[53:57] so and but again when it comes to
[54:01] getting worse is to get us to look how
[54:03] by the grace of God to get us to press
[54:06] on to the spiritual press on to the
[54:09] eternal not to keep our focus on the
[54:11] natural no no just leave that and let's
[54:13] move on by the grace of God just
[54:15] committed into the hands of the Lord
[54:16] when it comes to the when it comes to
[54:19] those that are that are experiencing
[54:21] suffering yes and and mourning the loss
[54:27] of loved ones many many many that have
[54:30] died around the world but it's going to
[54:33] get worse and again also of course
[54:37] remembering those in New Brunswick and
[54:39] what what they're enduring there and
[54:41] just to consider that after they lost
[54:44] and we're the number that was murdered
[54:47] in New Bronson gets tremendous and we
[54:49] pray the grace of God to the families of
[54:52] those that are mourning their loss and I
[54:54] understand - I think it's Nova Scotia
[54:57] where a young child just three years old
[55:02] I think is missing
[55:03] they found it's they found the shoes of
[55:06] the child in water so they assumed
[55:08] somewhere the child's body would be
[55:10] there so we pray the grace of God to the
[55:12] family there's no doubt mourning the
[55:14] loss of that loved one and to many
[55:17] others as well so grace grace grace and
[55:20] brother and I pray grace to the bride
[55:23] all we need grace for them yep but my
[55:26] brother we need grace when we consider
[55:28] this the services and how we have them
[55:32] how we're loud to have them not allowed
[55:34] to have them and so on it is absolutely
[55:37] amazing and sister Beverly did highlight
[55:40] that she did witnessed some brother she
[55:44] don't know it was online and but he was
[55:47] and it was a believer and he was taking
[55:50] his stand
[55:51] he said regardless of what the
[55:53] government says he said I got to do what
[55:54] God says a man and so he said even if I
[55:58] got to go to jail
[55:59] he said I'll do what God wants me to do
[56:01] and so I pray God blessed that brother a
[56:04] man and give him a greater and a greater
[56:06] a man encouragement and a greater and
[56:10] greater yes a man not to be afraid and
[56:12] keep pressing on
[56:15] so the Lord blesses and also to remember
[56:18] again of course other ministry and
[56:20] brethren that are under the same
[56:22] condition as we are here they have only
[56:24] a very few in their church and
[56:26] especially it's hard on those that have
[56:28] maybe hundreds in a search and now
[56:30] they're ministering just to maybe a few
[56:32] a man just five maybe in some churches
[56:34] might be ten and that's it and I believe
[56:38] that this weekend I think would be ten
[56:40] allowed for us the Lord willing so we
[56:43] will commit that to the Lord as our
[56:45] brother being nor rod with minister for
[56:47] us but and to let you know that we will
[56:51] be listening to our brother Donnie
[56:52] Reagan this morning during the last
[56:54] sermon that he preached and I think this
[56:58] sermon is let's see brother Donnie oh
[57:03] yeah
[57:04] our flesh doesn't like kenosis now he's
[57:08] been preaching on this for a long long
[57:10] long time on the different different
[57:13] ideas of kenosis and what is Kenosha's
[57:17] kenosis is getting rid of your will and
[57:20] accepting god's will a man so he said
[57:23] the flesh don't like that because the
[57:25] flesh wants to do its will but by the
[57:28] power of power of God in our souls we
[57:31] want to get rid of our will and have the
[57:32] will of God I don't care what it is
[57:35] because he's in control
[57:37] amen so if we're born again we want the
[57:40] will of God in all circumstances and in
[57:44] all situations amen so God's grace to us
[57:47] as we go in and here shortly our brother
[57:50] Donnie Reagan and one reason is that for
[57:54] the last couple of days I've had some
[57:57] back pain and I don't know what the
[57:59] problem was or is and I still got it and
[58:01] it's been very very difficult so I said
[58:05] maybe I stood up standing to preach and
[58:07] I said I'll get brother Donnie to preach
[58:09] for us they man and of course our
[58:11] brother Donnie he's experiencing what we
[58:14] experienced he feels the way we feel
[58:16] when it comes to the services and so on
[58:18] so the grace of God with him as he
[58:20] ministers to us concerning our flesh
[58:23] doesn't like canosa's and as I said he'd
[58:27] been ministry on earth
[58:28] a long long long time I couldn't believe
[58:31] it was indeed the I lied to something a
[58:33] hundred and some loud sermons part 132 I
[58:38] think or something like that so god
[58:40] bless the people and again when you hear
[58:43] the word don't just say well that's nice
[58:45] that's good I agree with that yeah if
[58:47] you agree with apply it the thing of it
[58:50] is people are hearing the word but
[58:51] they're not applying it so what we got
[58:54] to do is apply the word Amen so God
[58:56] gives it to us to obey it God gives it
[58:59] to us to challenge us God gives it to us
[59:01] to do to put it in action in our lives
[59:04] too many are listening to it hearing it
[59:07] and that's it they get up they come in
[59:10] and hear it they get up and walk out and
[59:11] leave it yeah they leave the message
[59:13] behind basically just goes oh yeah I
[59:16] agree with the message huh yeah we're
[59:18] taking apply it to your everyday living
[59:20] amen by the grace of God so the grace of
[59:24] God be with us and and be with our again
[59:30] sister Jaya Beverly and brother Doug and
[59:33] understand that they have quite a bit of
[59:35] snow we were having rain there every
[59:38] snow and she told us all the snow that
[59:41] they still got and and they have
[59:43] received it's tremendous a lot of snow
[59:46] so god bless our brother Doug and our
[59:49] sister Beverly and the other believers
[59:50] in that area and especially sister in I
[59:54] know and I know it Edna Gail in the home
[59:57] and I understand brother is at George my
[1:00:01] brother Georgia in the home there as
[1:00:03] well so God's grace to them god help us
[1:00:06] brother as we get closer to closer to
[1:00:08] the end that will have more concern for
[1:00:10] one another and love one another that we
[1:00:13] don't want this one to miss it we don't
[1:00:15] want that one to miss it and we're
[1:00:16] cleaning the token for each other
[1:00:18] amen and for our family grace grace
[1:00:21] grace amen
[1:00:24] so I turn with me to Luke chapter 22
[1:00:34] god bless our musicians it's good praise
[1:00:38] the Lord in Luke chapter 22 and
[1:00:44] beginning to read at verse 39 he said
[1:00:55] and he came out and went as he was
[1:00:58] walked to the Mount of Olives and his
[1:01:02] disciples also followed him and when he
[1:01:06] was at the place he said unto them pray
[1:01:10] that ye enter not into temptation a man
[1:01:15] Grace and the greatest temptation is to
[1:01:21] keep our will over the will of God and
[1:01:25] he was withdrawn from them about a
[1:01:28] stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed
[1:01:31] saying father if thou be willing remove
[1:01:36] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[1:01:41] will but thine be done and concerning
[1:01:44] what the bride is experiencing a mad
[1:01:48] that we would pray lord if it be your
[1:01:50] will remove this cup if it be your will
[1:01:53] change these circumstances in this
[1:01:55] situation but again if we're a bride
[1:01:58] where there's anointing will seek the
[1:02:00] will of God not my will father
[1:02:03] don't be done we want to do this we want
[1:02:05] to do that but God maybe wants us to do
[1:02:08] something else so not my will father
[1:02:11] don't be done and this is what our
[1:02:13] brother Donnie premonition for so long
[1:02:15] regarding kenosis is emptying our own
[1:02:18] will and receiving God's will
[1:02:20] a man grace to us and it says he said in
[1:02:26] verse 42 father if thy will if thou be
[1:02:29] willing remove this cup from me
[1:02:32] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:02:35] done a bed thank God for his will and
[1:02:40] there appeared an angel unto him from
[1:02:43] heaven strengthening him and
[1:02:46] being in it in an agony he prayed more
[1:02:48] earnestly god help us and his sweat was
[1:02:53] as it were great drops of blood falling
[1:02:56] down to the ground
[1:02:59] amen and when he rose up from prayer and
[1:03:03] was come to his disciples he found them
[1:03:07] sleeping for sorrow and he said unto
[1:03:11] them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye
[1:03:16] enter into temptation the temptation to
[1:03:19] seek your own will and not the will of
[1:03:21] God does temptation to do what we want
[1:03:24] to do but not what God wants us to do so
[1:03:26] I pray the grace of God that we are
[1:03:29] yield to his will
[1:03:30] will we be receptive to the will of God
[1:03:33] but empty our own will regardless of
[1:03:37] what the situation is regardless of what
[1:03:39] the circumstances is regardless of what
[1:03:41] the issues might be Lord your will be
[1:03:44] done I don't care what it is what it
[1:03:47] concerns amen
[1:03:49] just consider all that have paid the
[1:03:52] price for their stand for the gospel
[1:03:55] sixty-eight million lay down their lives
[1:03:58] what are we doing amen
[1:04:00] no gotta sacrifice they make all down
[1:04:04] for the aid and that's more than 68
[1:04:05] million when you consider all the other
[1:04:07] ages so what sacrifice are we making for
[1:04:10] the gospel see what are we doing for
[1:04:12] Jesus a man they laid down their life
[1:04:15] they didn't live for themselves they're
[1:04:17] living for Jesus amen and they died for
[1:04:20] Jesus they praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:22] so god help us just yes not my will time
[1:04:26] be done sixty-eight million took the
[1:04:28] will of God 68 million laid down their
[1:04:31] lives amen grace or Jesus that will lay
[1:04:35] down our lives and we're going to make
[1:04:36] whatever sacrifice we need to make in
[1:04:38] this whole world for Jesus for the
[1:04:40] Gospels sake for the kingdom of God sake
[1:04:43] for the sake of the rapture for the sake
[1:04:45] of the resurrection we're going to
[1:04:46] sacrifice the foolishness of this world
[1:04:48] we want to get out of here into glory so
[1:04:52] I pray God by grace then he make us more
[1:04:54] and more and more conscious of the
[1:04:56] eternal and
[1:04:58] less of the temporal amen more conscious
[1:05:01] of eternity in less of time they may it
[1:05:03] brother Terry this as Joshua and Caleb
[1:05:06] were more conscious of the promised land
[1:05:08] that they were the wilderness he didn't
[1:05:11] Matt didn't make it ever something what
[1:05:12] was going on in the wilderness God
[1:05:13] blessed them their God did this God did
[1:05:15] that a man but they still wanted to get
[1:05:18] into the lane they couldn't forget it a
[1:05:21] man and as time went on they had a
[1:05:24] greater hunger and a greater thirst to
[1:05:26] Gideon praise the lame of the Lord why
[1:05:29] because he knew that God was going to
[1:05:31] bless them in that Lane and get brother
[1:05:33] we're going to be blessed in the
[1:05:34] resurrection blessed in the rapture
[1:05:36] praise the name of the Lord get out of
[1:05:39] this old time and get into eternity or
[1:05:41] just think are you hungry for it are you
[1:05:44] thirsty for it it's going to be such a
[1:05:46] different world a man that there's not
[1:05:48] gonna be any thoughts of sin no thoughts
[1:05:52] of unbelief there's not gonna be nothing
[1:05:53] dark of all light by the grace of God
[1:05:57] amen no hate all love just think because
[1:06:01] everything else is done away with
[1:06:02] everything else is gone so do I pray God
[1:06:05] that we really really want to go we want
[1:06:08] to get there a man it's all mine I pray
[1:06:12] that we're experiencing it in our souls
[1:06:15] a man the anointing the love the life

[1:09:09] Christ amen
[1:09:11] god bless you and you may be seated and
[1:09:14] to say that I wanted to I've mentioned
[1:09:19] before to administer on the anointing
[1:09:21] was at the end time
[1:09:22] it's such a tremendous revelation that I
[1:09:26] may have to take a few sermons on that
[1:09:27] for sure concerning the anointing ones
[1:09:30] at the end time to explain
[1:09:32] concerning the anointed ones brother
[1:09:35] Brownlee is explaining concerning false
[1:09:37] Christ's he says not false Christ he
[1:09:40] said is plural false Christ's and he
[1:09:44] said false prophets a man and we're
[1:09:47] going to will bring out by the grace of
[1:09:49] God the things that the prophet of God
[1:09:51] was highlighting and bringing out the
[1:09:52] things that struck him and to explain to
[1:09:55] you the reason that William Branham
[1:09:57] preached the anointed once at the end
[1:09:59] time oh yeah
[1:10:01] he felt little the Lord and he said
[1:10:03] there's a reason for it and he was
[1:10:05] explaining what he felt was the reason
[1:10:07] that we need to hear the message that we
[1:10:10] needed to hear it and we need to really
[1:10:12] pay attention and get the revelation of
[1:10:14] the anointed ones at the end time lest
[1:10:16] we be deceived grace to us so God
[1:10:19] blessed us and we go to hear our brother
[1:10:21] Donnie Reagan amen brother Matthew
[1:10:39] thank you Lord Jesus what a great
[1:10:43] privilege it is to be able to live for
[1:10:46] him I've been serving him for many many
[1:10:49] years of my life and I think I'm more
[1:10:52] amazed now than I was whenever I first
[1:10:56] felt his tug on my heart there's a
[1:10:58] little boy because he's dealt with so
[1:11:01] many failures faults shortcomings
[1:11:04] problems issues and things of my life
[1:11:07] and it seemed like they never end closer
[1:11:10] we get to the end of the way and the
[1:11:12] more you think in our minds that we
[1:11:14] would know more about God and what truly
[1:11:17] we do but yet knowledge alone does not
[1:11:20] prevent us from heaven mess-ups and how
[1:11:24] great he loves us in spite of all that
[1:11:26] we greet just in that and the name of
[1:11:28] the Lord Jesus and hopefully this is the
[1:11:30] last time we'll have service like this 1
[1:11:34] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
[1:11:38] it's just not the same but how I've
[1:11:41] enjoyed these 10 brothers 11 whatever
[1:11:43] it's men from time to time it's coming -
[1:11:46] we just appreciate the Lord helping us
[1:11:48] Lord willin Sunday we'll start with our
[1:11:52] new program a through G's many of you
[1:11:55] already got the letters and so on and
[1:11:58] we're going to try to make this work I
[1:12:00] know we will by the grace of the Lord I
[1:12:02] know most of us don't like rules and
[1:12:04] regulations and do's and don'ts and
[1:12:06] haves and have-nots and cants and ken
[1:12:08] Ott's and all that sort of thing but in
[1:12:10] order to make this work we're going to
[1:12:12] need the cooperation to people because
[1:12:14] once we start having church we don't
[1:12:16] want to stop having it because somebody
[1:12:18] got sick so we're gonna try to do our
[1:12:21] best to be able to comply to these
[1:12:23] things and don't stop praying now just
[1:12:25] because we're all able to come back
[1:12:26] together Church pray this thing's leaves
[1:12:29] us and gets away from us don't come back
[1:12:31] again because we certainly don't want no
[1:12:33] resurgence of it I don't want to start
[1:12:35] being able to come back to church and
[1:12:36] people go back to work and all that and
[1:12:38] then
[1:12:38] we have to stop again so we will make do
[1:12:42] with it
[1:12:42] Lord willing we'll start back three
[1:12:44] times a week after Sunday we'll have
[1:12:46] Sunday and then Wednesday and then
[1:12:47] Saturday and send in we'll keep on going
[1:12:49] that way
[1:12:50] alphabetically until they say that we're
[1:12:52] able to phase it all back together full
[1:12:55] time and we're just looking forward to
[1:12:57] that time Matthew chapter 10 verse 37 if
[1:13:01] you'd like to read with me to noun in
[1:13:03] the scripture I want to speak to you
[1:13:05] tonight on our flesh doesn't like
[1:13:10] canosa's our flesh doesn't like enosis
[1:13:17] this is going to be one of them services
[1:13:19] that everybody's going to shout and I
[1:13:20] understand it may be hard for you to
[1:13:22] hold your peace and keep from shouting
[1:13:24] but if you get a little out I'll I'll
[1:13:26] understand that so I just trusted you
[1:13:30] know you try to enjoy the word as much
[1:13:32] as you can the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:36] he that loveth father or mother more
[1:13:42] than me is not worthy of me I wonder how
[1:13:50] many people those few words out there
[1:13:53] believe totally out of the kingdom of
[1:13:57] God because if religion crosses mama
[1:14:01] they're out religion crosses daddy
[1:14:04] they're out but a real believer will go
[1:14:07] with mama or without mama if necessary
[1:14:11] they are worthy of him now think of
[1:14:14] these words this is the only creator and
[1:14:18] only creation of the creator that is
[1:14:22] worthy but he's identifying a group of
[1:14:26] human beings that were born lost
[1:14:30] unworthy and he's saying there's a group
[1:14:33] of people on the earth that's going to
[1:14:35] be worthy of me listen to those words he
[1:14:40] that loveth father or mother more than
[1:14:43] me is not worthy of me he that loveth
[1:14:48] son or daughter more
[1:14:51] and me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:14:57] taketh not his cross and followeth after
[1:15:02] me is not worthy of me now remember
[1:15:07] whenever the Lord Jesus mentions this in
[1:15:10] Matthew 10 he has as of yet not mention
[1:15:14] anything about him dying on a cross so
[1:15:17] when the disciples hear this they do not
[1:15:20] their minds don't automatically go to
[1:15:23] Jesus on a cross because he hasn't
[1:15:26] mentioned that yet he mentioned our
[1:15:28] cross before he mentioned his but when
[1:15:32] he heard when they heard this they were
[1:15:34] very familiar with the cross because the
[1:15:37] Romans had killed hundreds and hundreds
[1:15:40] and even thousands of their people so
[1:15:43] whenever he mentioned cross they didn't
[1:15:44] think about Jesus but they talked about
[1:15:47] all them people they passed by and saw
[1:15:49] them dying on the way so remember when
[1:15:53] we think about this and our minds most
[1:15:55] of us was then where Jesus and his death
[1:15:57] and all that that's not what they
[1:15:59] thought about because they had not heard
[1:16:01] this at all notice again in Matthew
[1:16:03] chapter 16 verse 24 then said Jesus unto
[1:16:07] his disciples If any man will come after
[1:16:12] me let him deny Who the hardest person
[1:16:20] in the world that there is to deny we
[1:16:25] can deny our lives our children our
[1:16:28] parents our friends our closest buddy we
[1:16:32] can deny them easier than we can deny
[1:16:34] ourself if any man will come after me
[1:16:38] now we're talking about Brian material
[1:16:40] now not the church you can see why the
[1:16:42] church world will never fit into this if
[1:16:45] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:16:48] himself and take up not my cross but his
[1:16:55] cross and follow me
[1:16:58] mr. pray together Heavenly Father we are
[1:17:02] so blessed to hear these words tonight I
[1:17:06] am so thankful Lord Jesus when I read
[1:17:10] this or when I hear it read it is not
[1:17:16] something of some historical
[1:17:17] significance it is not that I hear you
[1:17:22] the greatest figure of all eternity
[1:17:26] saying such beautiful poetic words the
[1:17:31] Father it's something that I have
[1:17:33] experienced myself and for that I am so
[1:17:37] grateful Lord Jesus I pray that you
[1:17:41] would take your word tonight speak to us
[1:17:44] father help us to see that if we have
[1:17:47] experienced and are experiencing this
[1:17:51] work was in our hearts all God helped us
[1:17:55] to understand it is of such great
[1:17:58] significance that the token life is
[1:18:01] living out of us everyday for we know to
[1:18:05] live a selfish life is to die and to be
[1:18:09] separated but father when we are looking
[1:18:13] heaven in the face is when we live our
[1:18:17] life for others that does not mean of
[1:18:22] what others can do back for us it means
[1:18:25] if they hate us if they despise us you
[1:18:29] turn alive he is living and doing for
[1:18:33] others without any hope of repayment at
[1:18:37] all speak to us tonight father your
[1:18:40] great words of eternal life for they are
[1:18:43] awesome to us and will give you praise
[1:18:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen god
[1:18:50] bless you you may be seated god bless
[1:18:51] you st. chatter streaming tonight let me
[1:18:54] call your attention back to Matthew
[1:18:57] chapter 10 again verse 38 when Jesus
[1:19:00] says he that taketh not his cross
[1:19:05] and follow us after me is not worthy of
[1:19:09] me so to carry a cross is a figurative
[1:19:13] expression of denoting that which God by
[1:19:18] his sovereign decree gives each of us in
[1:19:21] our lives it's not that we actually make
[1:19:26] our own cross we don't sit down and
[1:19:29] contemplate and say well what could I do
[1:19:32] and what can I be able to bear for the
[1:19:35] calls of the Lord Jesus and would it be
[1:19:38] this or would it be a certain way that I
[1:19:40] would dress or certain places that I
[1:19:42] cannot go and God gives us a
[1:19:44] questionnaire and it's a multiple-choice
[1:19:46] and you pick you can pick a B or C or D
[1:19:49] it's not of our own making at all but
[1:19:52] it's actually that which the Lord out of
[1:19:55] his own sovereign grace knows what each
[1:19:59] of us needs to be able to deal with it
[1:20:01] simply consists in doing our duty but
[1:20:05] not doing our duty with an attitude but
[1:20:09] doing our duty with the attitude of
[1:20:12] submission and love and that God has
[1:20:15] actually helped us to conquer our own
[1:20:19] will from within and the the revelation
[1:20:24] of this whole thing it involves that
[1:20:27] it's not the power of God constantly
[1:20:30] constantly day in and day out just
[1:20:33] beating our flesh down and whipping us
[1:20:36] and God kicking us about and stomping us
[1:20:39] nope that's not it it's the Spirit of
[1:20:42] God so prevalent in our soul by the new
[1:20:45] birth that God from within us is helping
[1:20:49] us to submit everything that we are now
[1:20:54] remember we are born wrong were born
[1:20:56] between Satan and evil born contaminated
[1:20:59] even after the new birth we are left
[1:21:02] with this mark that is still in our
[1:21:04] spirit still in our human nature so
[1:21:08] cross bearing I remember this is pre
[1:21:11] Catholicism so there look
[1:21:14] in a total different way the cross backs
[1:21:16] did not come to sum a couple hundred
[1:21:18] years after that so when the disciples
[1:21:21] here it automatically in their mind
[1:21:23] they're thinking of the mem that they
[1:21:26] would see by walking by the way and they
[1:21:29] would put them as we would say the
[1:21:31] highway out here going from Johnson City
[1:21:33] to Elizabeth then they would not pick
[1:21:35] them over into place of shame a disgrace
[1:21:37] but they wanted them to be seen so
[1:21:40] everybody along would come through they
[1:21:43] would write their crime over the top of
[1:21:46] their head so they would see joy and
[1:21:49] robbed a bank joy yarns done this Donnie
[1:21:51] Reagan done that so they wanted you to
[1:21:54] know your crime was right above your
[1:21:57] head so remember what they wrote above
[1:22:00] his head Jesus of Nazareth King of the
[1:22:03] Jews
[1:22:03] this was his crime so and whenever they
[1:22:06] would go by it wasn't a stigma about it
[1:22:10] so the disciples you imagine as they
[1:22:12] begin to hear the Lord Jesus say you've
[1:22:15] got to take up your cross and follow me
[1:22:18] now the way that it was it was two
[1:22:20] members of the cross actually of course
[1:22:22] our insignia is like this more than
[1:22:24] likely it was not like that at all but
[1:22:26] it was two members that was more like
[1:22:28] this only had a little a very little bit
[1:22:31] that was right above it where they would
[1:22:32] nail your crime and the the man that was
[1:22:36] going to be crucified he would take the
[1:22:38] cross member this part right here this
[1:22:41] was the part that the Lord Jesus began
[1:22:43] to carry and he became weaker and weaker
[1:22:46] and we know that there was one according
[1:22:48] to the Gospel of John that was beckoned
[1:22:51] to help the Lord Jesus carry so the
[1:22:54] disciples when they hear these words
[1:22:56] they saw it since they were little boys
[1:22:58] so in their mind maybe their mind
[1:23:01] flashed back to seeing this man or maybe
[1:23:04] this old man or this young boy and they
[1:23:06] would see him as he would have his hands
[1:23:09] stretched out like this and they would
[1:23:11] have cords or ropes upon that and he
[1:23:14] would pack his
[1:23:16] so he was actually carrying the cross
[1:23:18] member or the top member like this and
[1:23:21] they would make him pack it for quite a
[1:23:23] ways the Lord Jesus was led down what
[1:23:26] was later called the Via Dolorosa the
[1:23:29] several steps of the cross which will
[1:23:31] mark today by churches and various
[1:23:33] things that you can walk through but in
[1:23:36] that day it was not a place of glamour
[1:23:38] there was no cathedrals ever no churches
[1:23:40] there so they would pick a public route
[1:23:42] that was very heavily traveled a trade
[1:23:45] route to the market to all the places
[1:23:47] you were spit upon you were a live tank
[1:23:50] you were ridiculed you but made fun of
[1:23:52] and the whole time you were carrying
[1:23:54] this cross member something like this
[1:23:56] now it was up and down steps it was
[1:23:59] through inclines it was through twists
[1:24:01] and turns in the road and the people
[1:24:02] along the way were more than welcome to
[1:24:05] ridicule you they were more than welcome
[1:24:08] to hit you they were more than welcome
[1:24:10] to run up and pull the beard out of your
[1:24:12] face to hawk spit and spit right in your
[1:24:15] face and kick you that was perfectly
[1:24:17] fine the Roman guards had no problem
[1:24:19] with that at all as a matter of fact the
[1:24:22] more pain that was inflicted the more
[1:24:24] shamed the more it served their purpose
[1:24:27] so remember when the disciples hear this
[1:24:30] they do not identify with something
[1:24:32] hanging around someone's neck on a gold
[1:24:35] or silver shape they do not identify
[1:24:37] with a symbol hanging outside of a
[1:24:39] church door but they identify with blood
[1:24:43] and pain and suffering and sorrow and
[1:24:46] humiliation and shame the lowest
[1:24:49] degradation that a person commands I
[1:24:52] remember a Roman citizen no matter how
[1:24:55] low that they stooped in life that they
[1:24:58] were given and spared this - it was so
[1:25:01] low no Roman citizen could ever be
[1:25:05] crucified because it was deemed the
[1:25:07] lowest of all deaths for anyone so when
[1:25:11] the Lord Jesus you're imagine now this
[1:25:14] 2,000 years of tradition
[1:25:17] now whenever you're hearing this for
[1:25:19] your first time so you don't identify as
[1:25:22] I said with a necklace around your neck
[1:25:23] or something hanging on your mirror in
[1:25:26] your automobile but what you see is
[1:25:28] these people that have been beat and
[1:25:30] spit upon and they would raise them up
[1:25:33] just high enough off the ground and the
[1:25:35] wild dogs would come and rip the meat
[1:25:37] from there
[1:25:38] the crows would come and pick their
[1:25:40] eyeballs out they've been known to hang
[1:25:42] on the cross for six to seven days and
[1:25:45] they would hang there and actually start
[1:25:48] mortification setting in their body and
[1:25:50] they would begin to sink and rot you
[1:25:53] imagine the Lord Jesus speaking a symbol
[1:25:56] to be able to identify following him now
[1:26:00] these disciples had in their mind that
[1:26:03] the Messiah was gonna come and he was
[1:26:05] going to be the son of David he was
[1:26:07] going to be a mighty Conqueror he was
[1:26:10] going to throw down the Romans and he
[1:26:12] was going to raise up his kingdom what
[1:26:14] did her cross have to do with the Lord
[1:26:17] Jesus you can see why the disciples they
[1:26:20] were so stumbled because he said Lord
[1:26:22] will you now restore to us the kingdom
[1:26:25] of Israel they did not understand they
[1:26:28] did not grasp the full the purpose of
[1:26:32] our Lord's Advent but they had it all
[1:26:35] run together that Psalms 2 and Psalms 84
[1:26:38] and how they're 7 and all these Isaiah
[1:26:41] 35 in Zechariah 6 all these things the
[1:26:44] mighty conquer the serpent bruiser they
[1:26:47] did not understand that he come to first
[1:26:50] on aisle eight sin then he would come at
[1:26:52] us you're in his kingdom so when he says
[1:26:55] this
[1:26:56] these horrific images come into their
[1:26:58] mind you imagine them looking at one
[1:27:01] another and thinking across across has
[1:27:04] to do with the Lord Jesus what what does
[1:27:07] this mean what what the significance to
[1:27:10] it and when he says he that taketh not
[1:27:13] his cross and followeth after me it's
[1:27:17] not worthy of me
[1:27:18] now if you notice the word that the Lord
[1:27:20] Jesus uses there he does not say he that
[1:27:24] make us not his cross but he that taketh
[1:27:28] not so it's not up to us to make our own
[1:27:32] cross because God knows how we are if
[1:27:35] each of us would make our own cross
[1:27:38] instead of it being spread from tip to
[1:27:40] tip to our fingertip and said if it
[1:27:43] being were often rough-hewn Omar we
[1:27:45] would have its wick like this and it'd
[1:27:47] be so nice
[1:27:49] my be high-gloss Paulie and he'd be
[1:27:51] rough down that wouldn't be mold
[1:27:53] splinters on it would take it all and
[1:27:55] smooth it down and you know just make it
[1:27:58] really really lie and make it so easy
[1:28:00] and so that we'd all be able to make it
[1:28:03] right through but you see the Lord
[1:28:05] custom makes each of our cross and the
[1:28:09] last time I look none of us get
[1:28:11] high-gloss poly or lacquer that's right
[1:28:14] he's not making a piece of furniture
[1:28:17] he's not making something that's going
[1:28:20] to be set in a museum but it is
[1:28:22] something that will help us along our
[1:28:25] journey in life in order to make us as
[1:28:28] the people of God that will stand there
[1:28:31] that day as overcomers because if he
[1:28:34] pushes us through one end of the pipe
[1:28:35] and reaches in the middle of the pipe
[1:28:37] and jerks aside on the other sides and
[1:28:40] said blessed are they that overcome
[1:28:42] really we haven't done anything we just
[1:28:44] held our best from the end of the pipe
[1:28:46] to the other end of the pipe but God
[1:28:48] knows exactly what each of us need in
[1:28:51] order to make us those blessed
[1:28:53] overcomers that he
[1:28:55] so he's so designed figuratively in his
[1:28:58] mind of what a Christian wall will do
[1:29:01] never remember as I said they did not
[1:29:03] have a clue that he himself was also
[1:29:05] going to be first for taker of the cross
[1:29:08] for whatever reason the Lord Jesus is
[1:29:10] now trying discipleship and you see it's
[1:29:14] so hard preaching it is so difficult
[1:29:16] preaching and preaching that
[1:29:18] requirements are laid out
[1:29:20] that's what scatters many times the
[1:29:22] sheep from the goats and that's why
[1:29:24] we've had many many visitors over the
[1:29:26] years and probably will continue to do
[1:29:28] so and if they hear something about do's
[1:29:30] and don'ts and this and that ma they'll
[1:29:32] sit there and clap their hands and they
[1:29:34] love the music and they love the feeling
[1:29:37] and the church until the preacher gets
[1:29:39] up to preaching on something of course
[1:29:41] that they're doing or something that
[1:29:42] they enjoy dying and then they do never
[1:29:44] could do come back again why it is a
[1:29:47] test of discipleship now a test of
[1:29:50] discipleship is not those who believe
[1:29:53] Jesus died on the cross a test of
[1:29:56] discipleship it's not that God so loved
[1:29:58] the world that He gave His only begotten
[1:30:00] Son a test of discipleship is not John
[1:30:04] 3:16 that Matthew 1038 a man a test of
[1:30:09] discipleship is not believing that
[1:30:11] there's a God a test of discipleship is
[1:30:14] not believing there is a heaven a test
[1:30:17] of discipleship is he that will not
[1:30:19] forsake father mother houses lands and
[1:30:22] even himself and take up his cross and
[1:30:25] follow me is not worthy of me now notice
[1:30:29] this is why that there is such great
[1:30:31] designation between the bride and the
[1:30:33] church because the bride or the only
[1:30:36] ones on the earth that are worthy to
[1:30:39] match he
[1:30:40] to be his missing piece of his mystical
[1:30:44] body and they are worthy
[1:30:46] Allisyn they are actually worthy of him
[1:30:50] because he has made them worthy and they
[1:30:55] past not only believe in John 3:16 but
[1:30:58] they passed the very test of
[1:31:00] discipleship which helps them to crucify
[1:31:03] their greatest enemy which they love
[1:31:06] more than anybody else and that is
[1:31:09] themselves can you all say Amen you know
[1:31:12] looking at this course God will custom
[1:31:16] make each person's cross that it will
[1:31:18] have an element of affliction it will
[1:31:21] have an element of persecution it will
[1:31:24] have an element of glory mixed in that
[1:31:27] and it will have an element of suffering
[1:31:29] for some it will be suffering and shame
[1:31:31] and humiliation and if their feeling was
[1:31:33] the pride of life is very you know it's
[1:31:36] a very big thing to them that more than
[1:31:37] likely God will custom-fit their cross
[1:31:40] to where it will actually work against
[1:31:42] them and help humble that so God will
[1:31:45] it's not like that God makes one and
[1:31:47] then you get in line and yours is the
[1:31:49] same as the four thousand five hundred
[1:31:50] eighty two in front of you but each one
[1:31:53] of us will have a his cross or a her
[1:31:56] cross now I can pray for you and I can
[1:31:59] ask God to help you and you can pray for
[1:32:01] me but actually I cannot bear your cross
[1:32:04] and you cannot bear mine is that right
[1:32:06] Peter could not bury James cross and
[1:32:09] James could not bury his and shoot us
[1:32:11] you know here hears his own place of
[1:32:13] sycamore tree Judas was the one that
[1:32:15] chose to go that way and Judas went back
[1:32:17] to Hell where he come from and he took
[1:32:19] the thief on the cross with him Jesus
[1:32:21] took the other thief on the cross back
[1:32:23] where he come from so each of us have
[1:32:25] got a place to where we are I did
[1:32:28] five well now the Lord Jesus says again
[1:32:30] in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said
[1:32:33] to them all If any man will come after
[1:32:36] me let him deny himself and take up his
[1:32:40] cross daily so notice this is not
[1:32:43] something that happens one time at the
[1:32:46] moment or the instant of the new burst
[1:32:48] and then we do it then and it's done
[1:32:50] once and forever it's actually something
[1:32:52] that we do every day of our life and it
[1:32:56] may change from one day to another what
[1:32:59] the cross curtails it may be one day it
[1:33:01] may be affliction the next day it might
[1:33:03] be a persecution from without the next
[1:33:06] day it might be a persecution from
[1:33:08] within and God is the only one that can
[1:33:10] intertwine it all together now you can
[1:33:12] imagine us having many many hundreds of
[1:33:15] people that come here to church how that
[1:33:16] the complexity of this body is that
[1:33:20] while some are going through sickness in
[1:33:22] their body some are suffering with their
[1:33:24] families some are going to financial
[1:33:27] things others are going to other things
[1:33:29] in life and you might try to relate to
[1:33:31] this person and that person said well I
[1:33:34] really don't understand what you're
[1:33:35] going through because that's not really
[1:33:37] my battle and yeah you imagine that
[1:33:39] around the world that God has it so
[1:33:41] diversified that whether it's in Africa
[1:33:44] whether it's in China now most of us
[1:33:46] more than likely will never go through
[1:33:47] what some of our Chinese brothers have
[1:33:50] gone through and some of them even this
[1:33:52] very night in jail because having the
[1:33:55] soul made it available Chinese Bibles in
[1:33:59] this very night imprisoned because of
[1:34:02] standing for the gospel you know we know
[1:34:04] we don't believe anyway that most of us
[1:34:07] will ever go through that so it would be
[1:34:09] hard for us to bear that cross but I
[1:34:12] don't think that should put us to where
[1:34:13] that we're unconcerned for our brothers
[1:34:16] that are there is that right but yet the
[1:34:18] Lord Jesus knows how to make
[1:34:21] cause to her it will work on one person
[1:34:24] now another person may give to you their
[1:34:27] cross all you know I'll go through this
[1:34:29] and I'll go through that and you're
[1:34:30] sitting there listen and you're trying
[1:34:32] to give it a 10 of year and a heart that
[1:34:34] is touched by their burden and you're
[1:34:36] just thinking wow and you get done and
[1:34:38] you set that well brother god bless you
[1:34:39] god bless your sister I should be
[1:34:41] praying for you and then whenever you
[1:34:43] leave and you sing man hours that's all
[1:34:46] I had to go through Wow I wish that was
[1:34:49] my cross now you see what you're doing
[1:34:52] is you're measuring their cross most of
[1:34:55] the time by our strengths and by the
[1:34:58] great things that we have in our life
[1:34:59] and more than likely what they said
[1:35:01] never bothered you or it wouldn't
[1:35:02] affected you in that voice I said boy
[1:35:04] ours that's what I went through but if
[1:35:06] you would have told them what you went
[1:35:08] through they might have felt the exact
[1:35:10] same thing about what Google said wow I
[1:35:13] wish that was my burden but remember
[1:35:15] it's not us that picks what we go
[1:35:18] through either that'll for our brothers
[1:35:20] and sisters now let me just be honest
[1:35:21] with you as your pastor many of you that
[1:35:23] go through various things of life and
[1:35:25] you call Carol and I to pray for you or
[1:35:27] you send me an email or text or
[1:35:29] something like that our hearts hurt boy
[1:35:31] it's been so difficult going through
[1:35:33] this time different one's been in the
[1:35:34] hospital I've not been able to see
[1:35:36] nobody go talk to nobody and it's been
[1:35:39] very very hard but yet it's immortal I
[1:35:42] realize if there was much much of what I
[1:35:45] could do if it was left up to me I would
[1:35:48] lift many many of y'all's burdens off of
[1:35:51] you as a shepherd because I love you so
[1:35:55] much but you see my love loving you like
[1:35:59] that it's not to the deepest degree by
[1:36:02] which God loves you because I look at
[1:36:04] you now I feel sorry for you and a lot
[1:36:07] of what I'm feeling is the love of God
[1:36:09] but it is also human compassion
[1:36:12] remember human compassion is not doing
[1:36:15] the will of God and a lot of times we
[1:36:18] try to minister to one another through
[1:36:20] human compassion and then we
[1:36:22] misunderstand God because we judge and
[1:36:24] we said well if I'll tell one thing if I
[1:36:27] was God I'd heal that person why would
[1:36:29] God leave that on them because see
[1:36:31] you're judging it by human compassion
[1:36:33] and you're look I say that ain't funny
[1:36:35] right why all God would have to do is
[1:36:37] just speak and it would lift that burden
[1:36:39] from them but God sees this tremendous
[1:36:42] victory that's going to come to pass if
[1:36:44] that brother sister be faithful going
[1:36:46] through that trial and if you and I
[1:36:48] would lift it off of them that big
[1:36:50] testimony maybe ten people will get
[1:36:52] saved by them coming through a trial
[1:36:54] maybe 15 more people will get healed of
[1:36:57] cancer by hearing their testimony maybe
[1:36:59] 35 more people will get delivered of
[1:37:02] something else and you and I would have
[1:37:04] stopped that complete victory by our
[1:37:07] human compassion so it shows we cannot
[1:37:10] go by human compassion so what does God
[1:37:13] do then god custom makes every one of
[1:37:16] our crosses that will fit us exactly to
[1:37:19] the T now the bottom line of what God
[1:37:22] wants to look at is God wants to work on
[1:37:24] this element that's left inside of every
[1:37:26] one of us that has the capability the
[1:37:29] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:37:30] and the pride of life all of that
[1:37:32] sinners around that part left in our
[1:37:34] natural human makeup which is called
[1:37:37] selfishness
[1:37:39] praise God now from here on I imagine
[1:37:43] even the mass won't say man now when
[1:37:46] Adam was the image of God in him was
[1:37:50] willing to walk out with his wife with
[1:37:54] the image of God still in Adam he was
[1:37:56] willing to forfeit his position of being
[1:37:59] God on the earth the image of God was
[1:38:01] still in it
[1:38:02] but once the image of God left him then
[1:38:06] the selfishness entered him after his
[1:38:10] fall that he never had before
[1:38:12] find one degree of selfishness and Adam
[1:38:14] at all until he failed then after he
[1:38:17] fell that lathe that was which was in
[1:38:19] him it's like it was awakened somehow
[1:38:22] another two thought the permissive one
[1:38:24] of God and it awakened in him and you
[1:38:26] see this first exploit of selfishness
[1:38:29] and the man says whenever God come
[1:38:32] question him the woman that Dow gave us
[1:38:35] to be with me now he was willing to
[1:38:37] forfeit his god ship he was willing to
[1:38:40] forfeit his power to be able to move
[1:38:42] trees and speak to whatever more the
[1:38:44] wind he was willing to forfeit every bit
[1:38:47] of that with the godlike image inside of
[1:38:50] him what's the godlike image loved him
[1:38:53] what was there to rule in its place
[1:38:57] selfishness then when God comes down
[1:39:01] what is Adams first response selfishness
[1:39:05] so instead of him saying now God don't
[1:39:08] don't take her place it's my fault I
[1:39:10] shouldn't have done this I should have
[1:39:12] stopped her it's my fault totally you
[1:39:15] don't see him saying that at all but he
[1:39:17] blames God and he blames her the woman
[1:39:20] vow gave us to be women if you don't let
[1:39:23] me make another choice god I'd never
[1:39:25] married her in the first place that
[1:39:27] she's the only woman on the earth so I
[1:39:29] actually ain't my fault nohow it's your
[1:39:31] fault her fault
[1:39:32] now what was the difference the image of
[1:39:35] God left him and when people get out
[1:39:38] from under the impression of the image
[1:39:41] of God what do we see that's the most
[1:39:43] prevalent force in their life
[1:39:45] selfishness well praise God
[1:39:49] what causes so many marital problems
[1:39:52] selfishness
[1:39:54] what causes parent children problems
[1:39:56] many times selfishness
[1:39:58] what causes problems in the church most
[1:40:01] of the time selfishness a man mother
[1:40:06] Donny
[1:40:08] tracie brother Donnie Donnie well I
[1:40:12] can't wait to Sunday like it all them
[1:40:14] people saying hey man god bless your
[1:40:17] heart now the woman the woman truly was
[1:40:21] desiring to be like God and we know
[1:40:24] that's what Satan offered her but Adam
[1:40:26] it puts him at a total different spot
[1:40:29] the one of course tries to pass the book
[1:40:31] as we say right on down but notice what
[1:40:33] brother Graham says you're a person who
[1:40:35] lives their life for their self lives a
[1:40:40] selfish life we must live for others now
[1:40:43] this is why our flesh does not like
[1:40:46] canosa's because canosa's the full
[1:40:49] effect of canosa from the soul than the
[1:40:53] inside out constantly wants to bring
[1:40:55] this flesh subject to the dominating
[1:40:58] force that lives inside the soul now
[1:41:01] brother don't hear you saying we're not
[1:41:02] even to do anything for ourselves we
[1:41:04] don't know I'm not saying that at all
[1:41:06] God left within us the ability of
[1:41:08] self-preservation this is wife an
[1:41:11] automobile stops in front of you and 3/4
[1:41:14] of a second you will respond by putting
[1:41:16] on your brake pedal it is an amazing
[1:41:17] that God makes you that fast and the
[1:41:19] lows no automobiles when God made man in
[1:41:21] the Garden of Eden we've been very very
[1:41:23] bad shape if God would have made our
[1:41:25] response 38 seconds long but I'll be
[1:41:27] dead tonight wouldn't it so God made
[1:41:29] that in us it's self-preservation you
[1:41:32] know your body if you're living if
[1:41:33] you're outside and the temperature
[1:41:35] starts to drop what will begin to get
[1:41:37] cold your fingertips are start getting
[1:41:38] cold as the cold moves closer your body
[1:41:40] will start cutting off the extremities
[1:41:43] that rival the terrible jaw it'll start
[1:41:45] cutting off your toes the blood will
[1:41:47] come on in closer closer and the heat
[1:41:49] will start coming right around your
[1:41:50] heart to protect the product organs and
[1:41:53] all inside what is that it's
[1:41:54] self-preservation is it wrong for us to
[1:41:57] feed ourselves of course not
[1:41:58] is it wrong for us to have hobbies and
[1:42:01] things out there that just we and
[1:42:02] ourselves enjoy doing no it's not
[1:42:05] until that becomes a primary saying that
[1:42:08] we want to do and whenever we do then we
[1:42:11] are actually asserting the very nature
[1:42:13] that we were given they trying to fall
[1:42:16] between the birds of Satan and Eve now I
[1:42:19] know I don't want to hear that but it's
[1:42:20] the truth
[1:42:21] so selfishness actually comes under the
[1:42:24] control of the Holy Ghost but instead of
[1:42:26] God annihilating it at the new birth he
[1:42:29] wants it to be that constant struggle
[1:42:32] that'll be there every day of our lives
[1:42:34] so we don't overcome it once we overcome
[1:42:36] it once every second or two or three
[1:42:40] praise the Lord
[1:42:41] well baby y'all don't but I'm just doing
[1:42:42] my me I guess now burdens and so fulfill
[1:42:47] the law of Christ and we've got to have
[1:42:49] a feeling for one another
[1:42:53] notice again he says so each day I want
[1:42:55] to live not from her cell if I live for
[1:42:57] myself I live a selfish life I want to
[1:43:01] live for others and give more strength
[1:43:03] to ham not to myself and to my own
[1:43:05] pleasure but for the benefit of others
[1:43:08] that will build the kingdom of God
[1:43:12] now once then selfishness and we said
[1:43:14] what I do to do things for others sure
[1:43:16] but selfishness is more than just doing
[1:43:19] things for others watch this and the
[1:43:21] word made first I recognize the other
[1:43:24] day a selfish spirit coming up in me oh
[1:43:30] my goodness this is Elijah y'all believe
[1:43:34] he had the Holy Ghost I recognize a
[1:43:37] selfish spirit notice he didn't say
[1:43:39] getting on me but he said coming up in
[1:43:43] me oh praise God
[1:43:47] now notice coming up in me of saying
[1:43:51] this man's wrong I'll to tell him about
[1:43:56] it
[1:43:57] oh my goodness well I thought that was
[1:44:00] standing for the word I thought that was
[1:44:02] uh huh
[1:44:03] see how easy selfishness gets
[1:44:07] intertwined with the work of God now
[1:44:10] watch how brother Ram senses she said I
[1:44:13] to tell him about it that's wrong God's
[1:44:17] the one to tell him about it that's not
[1:44:19] it's none of my business all my goodness
[1:44:24] so whenever we get involved and we want
[1:44:28] to take the place of God until this
[1:44:31] person in that person that person that
[1:44:33] person is wrong actually that's none of
[1:44:36] your business
[1:44:37] oh Jesus
[1:44:42] what is it
[1:44:43] selfishness all but it's my place to
[1:44:47] correct him what brother Branham
[1:44:49] identified that is being selfish I
[1:44:51] wonder how many of us have got selfish
[1:44:53] actually would probably do more good if
[1:44:55] we pray for him instead of trying to be
[1:44:57] their head or their leader now once this
[1:45:00] he says it's not about business it's my
[1:45:02] business to preach the gospel I love my
[1:45:05] enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I
[1:45:09] was his enemy oh my that's right when I
[1:45:12] was unlovely he loved me to his bosom
[1:45:14] and anybody that's unlovely met me love
[1:45:17] them the same
[1:45:18] let the spirit that was in Christ being
[1:45:20] us amen I love him or love him oh ma now
[1:45:24] what's out then that selfishness can be
[1:45:27] able to enter work itself in the very
[1:45:30] work of God and convince us that it's
[1:45:33] godly seal it's godly says you talking
[1:45:39] about a mimic you talking about a devil
[1:45:43] trying to hide himself the devil of
[1:45:46] selfishness that puts on the face mask
[1:45:50] of integrity and stand for the word when
[1:45:55] it's really all about selfishness praise
[1:45:59] be to God notice again he said when a
[1:46:02] man's ever truly born of the Spirit of
[1:46:04] God from the crown of his
[1:46:06] to the end of his toenails he's been
[1:46:09] changed by the resurrection power of the
[1:46:12] Lord Jesus Christ and his own selfish
[1:46:14] ideas have faded away and God has got
[1:46:19] complete control of that man of a Lord
[1:46:27] Jesus Christ and practice the same buddy
[1:46:31] that is a powerpack gentleman right
[1:46:32] there I'm telling you what notice this
[1:46:35] ceremony and look at the title here he
[1:46:38] preached this now not in a 55 in
[1:46:40] Campbellsville this is where sister
[1:46:42] Natalie Cox actually got saved this
[1:46:44] particular night brother Charlie didn't
[1:46:47] give his heart to God but from this
[1:46:49] sermon the Lord started dealing with him
[1:46:51] and maybe a week or so after that's won
[1:46:53] by the Charlie had given his heart to
[1:46:55] the Lord you say by the random I'm no
[1:46:57] prostitute I don't know together mean
[1:47:00] sexually prostitution on a higher level
[1:47:04] you can prostitute your time how much
[1:47:10] time do you give to him prostitute your
[1:47:14] own selfish motives now what does the
[1:47:19] prostitute do cause a prostitute sells
[1:47:22] her body to someone else while the
[1:47:25] prophet of God use such a word or words
[1:47:29] that we would associate with filthy
[1:47:31] unclean living he wanted to drive home
[1:47:34] the point brother Darrell that we also
[1:47:36] can give our motives our objectives our
[1:47:40] ideas our goals and so on and let our
[1:47:44] goals our motives our objectives become
[1:47:48] a prostitute to the devil and the devil
[1:47:52] will take our time our motives our
[1:47:55] objective our so-called zeal and he will
[1:47:58] take that
[1:47:59] use that for his own pleasure oh praise
[1:48:05] be to God can't you see why our flesh
[1:48:07] don't like enosis hey my flesh don't
[1:48:10] like this preacher no more than you do
[1:48:12] I just like it twice I'm having to
[1:48:15] preach it and yet it worked at the same
[1:48:16] time but you know what it's the truth
[1:48:19] it is the truth in reading this I read
[1:48:22] this many years ago of course but going
[1:48:24] back the other day look at this I
[1:48:26] thought oh god help me help the church
[1:48:28] Lord the bride around the world that we
[1:48:31] don't prostitute our time and prostitute
[1:48:34] our knowledge when you look at all the
[1:48:37] avenues by which Satan would want to try
[1:48:39] to prosper how many brother Darrell that
[1:48:41] we know that prostitute their knowledge
[1:48:43] of the message and they give their
[1:48:45] knowledge of the message as a prostitute
[1:48:48] and Satan will project his own motive
[1:48:51] inside of their knowledge or prostitute
[1:48:54] their gift or prostitute their ability
[1:48:56] or their influence and Satan will use
[1:48:59] their influence oh god help us that we
[1:49:02] do not give our motives our time our
[1:49:05] emphasis nothing about us to the devil
[1:49:08] now notice he said prostitute your own
[1:49:12] motives going around saying well I
[1:49:15] belong to this church oh my goodness so
[1:49:20] you mean when a person is going around
[1:49:23] and pride and arrogance and identifying
[1:49:28] themselves in a certain group they are
[1:49:32] prostituting their identification I
[1:49:35] belong will you imagine whenever I'm
[1:49:37] seventh under I don't believe in
[1:49:40] preachers I'm tape only you're a
[1:49:41] prostitute well praise the Lord you're a

[1:50:12] attitude I'm better than you I'm more
[1:50:14] Revelator than you we got more miracles
[1:50:17] than you we got more people you're a
[1:50:18] prostitute

[1:50:46] I'm better no you're not you can
[1:50:50] prostitute otherwise then sexually the
[1:50:53] Holy Spirit will speak to your heart and

[1:51:28] you're saying
[1:51:29] and punctuating your prayer can you
[1:51:34] imagine a person giving their prayer as
[1:51:38] a prostitute so when they pray and they
[1:51:43] won't impress people in my they want to
[1:51:45] have all the nouns and the pronouns and
[1:51:47] all that sort of thing and whenever they
[1:51:49] do it even stain them they may be sent a
[1:51:51] rubber hammer
[1:51:52] but the pride gets involved in it you
[1:51:54] know what happened right ahead Satan
[1:51:57] took that prayer and had his pleasure
[1:52:01] with their prayer
[1:52:06] brothers we may not have to worry about
[1:52:08] Sonny having social distancing everybody

[1:52:28] listening to her own prayer God's
[1:52:31] supposed to be listening to it but
[1:52:34] you're listening to your own prayer

[1:52:38] god help you to turn loose wants and
[1:52:41] pray

[1:52:49] their same prayers prostituting oh
[1:52:57] praise God
[1:52:59] listen Tish you talking about what a
[1:53:02] devastating thing that selfishness is
[1:53:05] and the mighty clunker brother Branham
[1:53:08] says this we will never conquer as long

[1:53:42] what are you talking about take up your

[1:54:19] self and be yoked to him no matter what
[1:54:23] the rest of the world thinks what the
[1:54:25] rest the world does were yoked with
[1:54:28] fetters of love we are prisoners and

[1:55:28] he ain't got her chained down no long
[1:55:30] chain but he's got her right there she
[1:55:32] is a prisoner of love over the devil
[1:55:35] says come around the Prophet said yeah
[1:55:37] you could if you wanted to but you don't
[1:55:39] want to know more
[1:55:42] you have become our love slave to Jesus
[1:55:44] Christ
[1:55:46] all my love this and their known and
[1:55:49] once he said many of you here not be
[1:55:51] Trinitarian preachers we don't want you
[1:55:54] to be angry with you said we love you if
[1:55:56] we did not believe that I'd never leave
[1:55:58] this church so I got down there and my
[1:56:00] knees and said God make me right I don't
[1:56:02] want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed
[1:56:06] up was mine now listen how he looks at
[1:56:08] arrogance and selfishness I want my
[1:56:11] spirit to be pure and clean so you can't
[1:56:13] be arrogant and selfish and pure and
[1:56:16] clean at the same time if you're pure
[1:56:20] and clean you won't be arrogant and
[1:56:22] selfish but if you're arrogant and
[1:56:23] selfish you're not pure and clean well
[1:56:26] praise the Lord you can mix it together
[1:56:27] you're not making a cake you're making a
[1:56:29] born-again experience I've never oh my I
[1:56:32] want my spirit to be pure and claim
[1:56:34] brotherly love holy and the Holy Spirit
[1:56:36] now if someone does anything wrong to me
[1:56:39] that's all right whoa and though I might
[1:56:47] have the right to get back at them I
[1:56:51] don't want that in my life no I want to
[1:56:57] have love I want to be ready to correct
[1:56:59] for the loved and was loved that
[1:57:00] absolutely answers out yonder for it ma
[1:57:05] now look at what Satan wants to do oh
[1:57:08] you know the complexity of the new birth
[1:57:10] to us as mortals imagine have must have
[1:57:12] been quite overwhelming for him as well
[1:57:14] because the picturesque view of the new
[1:57:16] birth never come into clarity really
[1:57:18] whenever the Lord Jesus even speaks to
[1:57:20] Nicodemus because he speaks him in
[1:57:22] parables and we don't have any direct
[1:57:24] place where the Lord ever actually
[1:57:26] mentioned the new birth directly through
[1:57:27] the apostles but yet John must have
[1:57:30] either been around been near Jesus told
[1:57:32] him later so when the new verse came
[1:57:34] over there Pentecost it must have been
[1:57:36] quite mysterious even to them and
[1:57:38] imagine they
[1:57:39] wondered in the heart now that this has
[1:57:41] come down and this great thing has
[1:57:43] touched our souls in our hearts what
[1:57:45] will we be will would be absolute little
[1:57:48] amateur gods upon the earth is there an
[1:57:50] element of our humanity left I wonder
[1:57:52] how long it took them to the day before
[1:57:54] they realize that the humanity will
[1:57:56] still there mix in with the deity you
[1:57:59] need they leave the upper room and they
[1:58:01] go down they start preaching so it must
[1:58:03] have been maybe hours that they were
[1:58:05] caught up into this and they begin to
[1:58:07] feel this supernatural phenomena and I
[1:58:09] wonder if they doubt in their minds Oh
[1:58:11] Lord we've been changed forever we'll
[1:58:13] never go back to being immortal again
[1:58:15] we'll never feel this way again but then
[1:58:17] the anointing begin to wear off and
[1:58:19] maybe somebody said one to another you
[1:58:21] know and they begin to kind of get
[1:58:23] aggravated and then they realize it
[1:58:25] stroked him oh my goodness we've got
[1:58:27] changed and we've got born again but the
[1:58:30] element of our humanity still remains in
[1:58:33] the mix so it is the mixture of what he
[1:58:37] was imagine it must have come back to
[1:58:39] their mind and then the contemplation of
[1:58:41] what God had done for them was mirrored
[1:58:44] from the first one of the new race
[1:58:46] because they would see him gone with a
[1:58:48] headache in another moment of time they
[1:58:50] seemed stopped a coffin and raised a boy
[1:58:52] from the dead and they in there they
[1:58:54] begin to see himself mirrored in there
[1:58:57] they would see them lay their hands on
[1:58:59] the sick and cast out devils and they
[1:59:01] would see themselves getting sick and
[1:59:03] they would see themselves having
[1:59:05] problems in their own flesh and troubles
[1:59:08] in their church
[1:59:09] it's alright now miss brother Bheema
[1:59:12] says this if you profess to be a
[1:59:14] Christian depart from sin and
[1:59:19] selfishness and tempers and live like
[1:59:23] Christ they're peaceful humble
[1:59:27] god bless life Ava I agree with that
[1:59:32] don't you amen
[1:59:34] notice again you see what pride and
[1:59:37] selfishness does it shuts you out from
[1:59:45] the kingdom of God now even when I talk
[1:59:50] about drinking and running around with
[1:59:52] somebody else's wife selfishness and
[1:59:56] pride shuts you out from the kingdom of
[2:00:01] God notices and images of Christ while I
[2:00:06] love this one here I remember it's only
[2:00:08] the sick that demands attention service
[2:00:11] just the sick they demand attention when
[2:00:14] you see a preacher and they are not only
[2:00:19] limited to a preacher but they are
[2:00:20] limited to every church member that
[2:00:22] wants attention I'm somebody just
[2:00:27] remember there's a spiritual sick person
[2:00:31] there needing attention now this is what
[2:00:35] he says they need they need the
[2:00:37] attention of the Spirit of God to give
[2:00:39] them something that'll take that
[2:00:40] attitude out of them and heal them from
[2:00:43] their selfishness God that sounds like a
[2:00:47] spanking to me now they think they need
[2:00:50] attention and here comes God with a big
[2:00:52] battle or a big whip he's gonna whoop up
[2:00:55] on you why because that's what you need
[2:00:58] now you
[2:00:59] you need attention more accolades
[2:01:01] appraised all my everybody just makeover
[2:01:03] you makeover you're making God sad I
[2:01:04] know what you need
[2:01:05] bend over my knee here son oh praise God
[2:01:09] one of the best signs I know that I've
[2:01:11] got I've still got scars and marks all
[2:01:12] over my spiritual body because of
[2:01:14] Benwick child of God but I'd rather be a
[2:01:16] whoops I love God than be a Bachelor of
[2:01:18] the devil and God let me live like the
[2:01:20] devil and do everything in the world and
[2:01:22] still annoy men let me scream and shout
[2:01:23] I'm glad my older ghosts won't let me do
[2:01:26] that on the inside of me that if I even
[2:01:31] step over that and feel like I took any
[2:01:33] glory anything away from him at all that
[2:01:36] something smarts me like a 10-ton truck
[2:01:38] I'm glad I can do that aren't you
[2:01:40] brother Darrell I'm glad that's inside
[2:01:42] of me that built-in something inside of
[2:01:44] me but no there's a line between what
[2:01:46] God wants to share with us and what
[2:01:49] belongs to him only hey man

[2:04:05] transfusion of Calvary that'll give them
[2:04:08] rich royal blood in the old fashion know
[2:04:15] where the Holy Ghost hewed out way of
[2:04:17] God that'll give them something to live
[2:04:19] for
[2:04:20] give them a confidence that will make

[2:04:44] blood I said you need more blood you
[2:04:48] might need a whoopin to stir up your
[2:04:51] simulation a little bit praise God to be
[2:04:58] a Christian well it's self-denial deny
[2:05:10] yourself take up your cross follow me
[2:05:12] daily today it's so soft and people call
[2:05:15] it what in the world for instance this
[2:05:17] is 1963 what would he say today 2020 if
[2:05:21] he thought they were soft at them oh my
[2:05:25] goodness people call themselves
[2:05:28] Christians well he used to mean death -
[2:05:31] confess Christ you have to depend on him
[2:05:34] daily forever saying you I'd need up
[2:05:38] again Christianity is self-denial take
[2:05:42] up your cross daily follow him down to
[2:05:45] the things of the world when all
[2:05:46] condemnation is gone now let me skip
[2:05:51] over here just a little bit to our
[2:05:52] brother Brad let's go to second
[2:05:53] Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 let's
[2:05:55] just touch on this a little bit and pick
[2:05:56] it up in Orland sending look notice the
[2:05:58] difference now between selfishness and
[2:06:01] self about us which of course comes from
[2:06:04] Satan did not come from God notice this
[2:06:07] appalled said therefore if any man be in
[2:06:09] Christ he is a new creature all things
[2:06:11] are passed away and behold all things
[2:06:14] are become new and all things are of God
[2:06:18] who has reconciled us to himself by
[2:06:24] Jesus Christ
[2:06:26] I love the meaning of this word it is to
[2:06:31] change or exchange as coins for others
[2:06:39] of equivalent value you see that's not
[2:06:47] the way we understand reconciliation we
[2:06:51] think reconciliation is we were a piece
[2:06:55] of trash junk rats on the garbage heap
[2:06:58] and God took us all some awesome
[2:07:03] pearl the great price this beautiful
[2:07:05] beautiful treasure is heaven and bought
[2:07:09] this piece of junk but that's not
[2:07:12] reconciliation at all even you brothers
[2:07:17] still looking at me funny but God
[2:07:20] actually took one coin which he made
[2:07:24] untouched with the dust of humanity
[2:07:27] glory and took that coin in the place of
[2:07:33] those other seeds which were represented
[2:07:36] in dust as well but they were actually
[2:07:40] of the same value to him
[2:07:43] praise be to God the one that he took
[2:07:47] this invaluable piece that was totally
[2:07:50] completely priceless and he bought this
[2:07:53] piece of junk with it and he's spending
[2:07:55] his whole time trying to modify this
[2:07:58] junk and change the show no that's not
[2:08:00] what he's doing at all that is not
[2:08:03] reconciliation how could you be
[2:08:06] reconciled to a friend you never had how
[2:08:11] could you and John Doe and Jim doe and
[2:08:14] Frank know and and you say I don't even
[2:08:16] know the doughboys
[2:08:20] be reconciled to them what did you know
[2:08:23] no I never know him in my life did you
[2:08:26] go to school them on no I never once go
[2:08:27] but I want to be reconciled with people
[2:08:29] the good you said well you're crazy
[2:08:30] forget it we preach reconciliation to
[2:08:33] God they say we're nuts but this is what
[2:08:37] the Bible
[2:08:38] he has reconciled us to himself by his
[2:08:43] human temple human anointed temple to
[2:08:50] hoover god anointed in a human body
[2:08:53] hukum gnosis himself so here was this
[2:08:57] coin upgrade by others the first
[2:08:59] attribute of the logos they come out of
[2:09:01] the eternal but when all these other
[2:09:03] attributes of wealth and they were the
[2:09:05] same value why they were the elect
[2:09:08] quality they were not opinion he was a
[2:09:11] silver dollar they were from the throne
[2:09:14] of God but they were lost
[2:09:25] out of friendship out of fellowship out
[2:09:30] of circulation remember when Jesus gives
[2:09:35] the three parables there in Luke of the
[2:09:40] man within hundred sheep and then the
[2:09:43] woman who lost the coin and then the
[2:09:46] prodigal son look at him all three of
[2:09:48] them dating with the elect he didn't
[2:09:52] have 99 sheep and one goat went out
[2:09:54] turned made that goat and changed him
[2:09:55] over and transformed him into a sheep it
[2:09:57] was a hundred sheep and went out Joe
[2:09:59] walked a reconciler bring that one sheep
[2:10:01] back and the woman that had them coins
[2:10:03] if they know what it was it was that
[2:10:04] headband around her you know someone
[2:10:07] before mother necklace and she lost that
[2:10:08] coin but remember the coin was hers
[2:10:11] first what was those parables ministry
[2:10:14] of reconciliation
[2:10:16] he come to get the church he come to get
[2:10:20] them and he offered them Grace and they
[2:10:22] were undeserving that's exactly right
[2:10:24] they were undeserving they were not of
[2:10:27] his she knows they were not his kind but
[2:10:29] the blood is his kind because he is the
[2:10:33] word the word so what did she do she
[2:10:40] takes the lamp and she goes to sleep in
[2:10:42] the house looking for what something she
[2:10:44] never had if she never had it how does
[2:10:48] she know what to look for but she took
[2:10:53] the broom and swept the house
[2:10:56] I love the Prophet said one day you'll
[2:10:58] be standing and all of a sudden
[2:11:05] [Applause]
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:14] [Applause]
[2:11:15] [Music]
[2:11:17] unless she knew exactly what that point
[2:11:20] was all but may I remind you that coin
[2:11:24] had an image on it an image and
[2:11:27] superscription on it the image of the
[2:11:31] issuing came of that day so it's a Roman
[2:11:36] Denari eye hallelujah speaking in
[2:11:39] tongues already a God it was lost but it
[2:11:43] was lost in the terms of election lost
[2:11:47] it was simply out of circulation
[2:11:52] glory be to God as she confined it it
[2:11:56] still has value and she can find it it
[2:11:59] still has buying power if she can find
[2:12:01] it and restore it back to his face it
[2:12:04] still has the same power that the rest
[2:12:06] of them had there was no loss
[2:12:08] this is reconciliation we were not a
[2:12:12] bunch of goats around and a bunch of
[2:12:14] weeds and somehow the Lord done
[2:12:16] something to us that was a new birth
[2:12:18] that ain't a new verse lost condition
[2:12:22] and the Holy Ghost coming inside that
[2:12:25] senior and quickly new to eternal life
[2:12:28] Lord God all things are of God who has
[2:12:36] reconciled us reconciled reconciled
[2:12:43] reconcile no I'm stuck I just want you
[2:12:45] to get it reconciled us to himself by
[2:12:52] Jesus Christ they don't stop there but
[2:12:58] he says he has given to us the Ministry
[2:13:01] of reconciliation praise be to God
[2:13:07] we have been given the Ministry of
[2:13:09] reconciliation to do one brother Darrell
[2:13:12] go out there and find those other coins
[2:13:14] that are not in their place
[2:13:16] hey man maybe preach a lesson Tom
[2:13:18] preached predestination - oh my never
[2:13:21] eat something tom that will help them
[2:13:22] the real heart you never want to coach
[2:13:24] you never like that you always was a
[2:13:28] shape can't you see why the church world
[2:13:33] itself really don't understand or
[2:13:36] believe in reconciliation why because
[2:13:38] their preachers have preached to them
[2:13:40] don't preach to them their reconcile as
[2:13:42] they were a friend with God before their
[2:13:44] preaching to them truly the truth for
[2:13:47] who they are
[2:13:49] to hear that true I used to hear yes I
[2:13:51] did but I thank God I thank God one day
[2:13:54] I realized all them years of hearing
[2:13:56] that that wasn't really who I was they
[2:13:58] really who I was I thought that's who I
[2:14:01] was and it took me years to get that
[2:14:03] tradition out of me but now realize I've
[2:14:06] been reconciled to God I was a kind that
[2:14:11] was lost oh man so she sweeps the house
[2:14:16] and she sweeps the house and she finds a
[2:14:18] gravel and she takes this gravel over to

[2:17:27] thinking I don't know about this man I'm
[2:17:28] worth right now
[2:17:29] the Prophet said the reason she was in
[2:17:31] that shape was because of mom and daddy
[2:17:33] turned her out when she was young and
[2:17:35] she started living that kind of life and
[2:17:37] he said people talk about child

[2:19:11] old gravel because she wasn't no gravel
[2:19:13] she was a redeemable attribute and
[2:19:16] through the man Christ Jesus God had
[2:19:19] performed the Ministry of reconciliation
[2:19:22] this is why friend it's so important
[2:19:25] that we get ourselves out of the way
[2:19:27] this is what he wants to do through all
[2:19:29] of us maybe not to the same degree but
[2:19:32] he wants to let his life be live sir
[2:19:35] well shine through us and reconcile
[2:19:38] maybe another coin out there that you're
[2:19:40] working with the stairs
[2:19:48] place Peter gotta aim thank you Lord
[2:19:55] Jesus thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah
[2:20:02] oh ma no wonder our flesh don't like
[2:20:07] your sister it's the last hold that
[2:20:11] Saint has on you
[2:20:13] it's the last hold he has on me to keep
[2:20:18] me from completely surrendering to God
[2:20:23] the people at CNN know my name they've
[2:20:27] called it before the people at ABC know
[2:20:31] my name the people at Fox know my name
[2:20:36] well it ain't ten people thats ever
[2:20:38] hindered me from going on with god so in
[2:20:42] reality they're not my enemies it's this
[2:20:45] oh boy right here
[2:20:50] Oh mother God if I could just kill it
[2:20:52] get away with it it's not that he wants
[2:20:57] you to take up your cross every day as
[2:21:01] soon as you get out of the bed of the
[2:21:02] morning whatever it is and remember
[2:21:05] you're Pro your cross can be multi-facet
[2:21:08] in the persecutions afflictions pain
[2:21:11] personal suffering being run down by
[2:21:14] people hurt having your reputation
[2:21:16] marred by Liars whatever more it may
[2:21:19] change from one day to the next one week
[2:21:21] to the next but it wants us to be able
[2:21:24] to patiently carry it as he did his have
[2:21:30] always carried it faithfully I have not
[2:21:33] now daresay I can speak for everyone
[2:21:35] that's visible here tonight and those
[2:21:36] that are invisible as well and say most
[2:21:38] of us have not either even the Lord
[2:21:40] Jesus when it come to facing this his
[2:21:42] humanity must feel this drawback because
[2:21:46] he knew I would
[2:21:49] he knew I would he knows how I am he
[2:21:55] knows every time he goes to leading me
[2:21:56] down sermons of this line right here our
[2:21:58] question I'll battle it
[2:22:00] I don't like preaching him I walked here
[2:22:04] left after service Sunday went home wet
[2:22:08] clothes on so I want to change my
[2:22:09] clothes Carol come in the closet where I
[2:22:11] said said don't you let the devil
[2:22:14] where are you out clothes what you
[2:22:16] preached because we need it iced I know
[2:22:20] it I know it but I still don't like it
[2:22:25] what is it part of my cross its whipping
[2:22:30] the people I love more than I love my
[2:22:34] own life I would die for you folks and
[2:22:38] then I have to turn around and whip you
[2:22:40] does that make sense well your parents
[2:22:44] had to do the same thing to your tune
[2:22:45] you would give your life for your
[2:22:47] children but you love them so much when
[2:22:50] they were wrong you corrected him that
[2:22:53] proved the extent of your love it was
[2:22:56] beyond human compassion
[2:23:00] let me just give you a little glimpse
[2:23:02] before we close there he was in the
[2:23:07] circle of eternity and he was the father
[2:23:09] actually
[2:23:11] but he must condon sin and become in the
[2:23:14] form of sonship so the Great Creator
[2:23:19] took on dust imagine when there was no
[2:23:24] cosmic light or no atomic dust or
[2:23:26] anything out there but yet he himself
[2:23:28] knew one day he would take on dust and
[2:23:32] become dust the Prophet said when he was
[2:23:40] born a baby
[2:23:41] that little toothless mouth that little
[2:23:45] toothless mouth when he opened that
[2:23:49] little toothless mouth and cried it was
[2:23:54] Jehovah like a baby
[2:24:00] he said he could have come a foamer tour
[2:24:03] man but he didn't want to come like a
[2:24:06] man he wanted to be born a baby so he
[2:24:10] would know how babies feel he grew up as
[2:24:16] an eight-year-old a nine year old a 10
[2:24:18] year old as a teenager again the Prophet
[2:24:21] says we have him listen to it listen to
[2:24:22] it 12 2759 he said he wanted to come up
[2:24:29] and grow up as a teenager to face the
[2:24:32] tests and trials as a teenager and
[2:24:35] remember he faced those things as a
[2:24:37] teenager without the baptism of the Holy
[2:24:41] Ghost you said why would he do that
[2:24:45] because he wanted to be the high priest
[2:24:48] not only for Holy Ghost field but for
[2:24:51] those who are justified and sanctified
[2:24:54] aren't you glad he didn't wait to become
[2:24:56] your high priest just when you got the
[2:24:58] Holy Ghost he wanted to understand how
[2:25:01] babies would feel how children would
[2:25:03] feel how teenagers would feel praise God
[2:25:09] Satan can't relate to this friends this
[2:25:12] is why he totally missed it you imagined
[2:25:14] Satan and his demons and they hear
[2:25:15] sermons like this tonight which had been
[2:25:17] preached since the gospel has been
[2:25:18] preached for 2,000 years and he's still
[2:25:20] to this day he cannot process it it
[2:25:25] makes no sense to him the only thing he
[2:25:29] understands is rebellion and hatred he
[2:25:33] loves that sort of thing humility it's
[2:25:35] not in him what in him is pride and
[2:25:38] arrogance and puffed up and bragging on
[2:25:41] yourself and making yourself this and
[2:25:44] that are there stepping on whatever you
[2:25:46] have to step on to get to the top of the
[2:25:48] ladder but I'm so glad that's not who we
[2:25:53] are the ladder we're trying to get a top
[2:25:56] of is not Satan's ladder but Jacob's
[2:25:59] Ladder it anchored the Prophet said down
[2:26:02] on the earth and then it anchored up in
[2:26:04] heaven in the angels of God were
[2:26:07] ascending and descending up that ladder
[2:26:08] and later we know that ladder was called
[2:26:12] is Christ coming about our hits tonight
[2:26:14] I wonder how many of you that are
[2:26:18] present and those of you that have
[2:26:19] streamed the service and those of you
[2:26:21] that will archive it would you just say
[2:26:24] with me tonight Lord Jesus help me to
[2:26:27] take up my cross help me not to complain
[2:26:30] if you're like me probably it's not that
[2:26:33] you haven't bore your cross but you born
[2:26:36] it was complaints you've borne it with
[2:26:38] attitudes you've borne in with growling
[2:26:41] and all kinds of things that comes with
[2:26:43] it Oh Lord Jesus we ask you tonight for
[2:26:48] forgiveness Lord Father it's north and
[2:26:53] I'm asking for the first time in our
[2:26:54] life to take up my cross but lord I
[2:26:58] desire to take it up Lord with an
[2:27:01] adjustment in my attitude my hell look
[2:27:06] heavenly father help me Lord Jesus
[2:27:11] none of us and our human makeup we we
[2:27:14] want to be accepted we want to be loved
[2:27:16] we all of those things lord help us out
[2:27:20] pray to love you more than anything or
[2:27:23] anyone else in the world help me Lord
[2:27:26] Jesus you didn't tell me to deny my wife
[2:27:30] Lord you didn't say if any man will the
[2:27:33] nice children but he brought her right
[2:27:36] down repeated it over and over again in
[2:27:38] the four Gospels you must deny himself
[2:27:42] help us Lord Jesus I pray we love you
[2:27:46] too my father thank you for this word
[2:27:48] lord I thank you so much that we're
[2:27:51] going to get to start assembling
[2:27:53] together again Lord and we so look
[2:27:55] forward to it on Sunday father I pray
[2:27:58] that you'd help us through this time
[2:28:00] it's going to be a little different for
[2:28:01] still yet but help us to get through it
[2:28:04] Lord we would just pray for your mercy
[2:28:06] we realize Father that we're not dealing
[2:28:09] with just sales and that sort of thing
[2:28:11] under a microscope but we know this
[2:28:13] thing come from the fourth dimension
[2:28:15] it's a disease unlike anything as far as
[2:28:19] we know that man has ever dealt with
[2:28:21] before
[2:28:22] with the flu with the cold with many
[2:28:25] things people that are infected they
[2:28:28] have symptoms but this one Lord it is so
[2:28:31] well camouflaged that people can be
[2:28:34] asymptomatic Lord they can be spreading
[2:28:37] it from one to another to another and
[2:28:39] they don't even know that they're sick
[2:28:41] so it is truly showing us that Satan has
[2:28:46] found a way from that fourth dimension
[2:28:49] to be able to break into cells and into
[2:28:53] the human race in a higher way than what
[2:28:57] we have ever known before scientists
[2:29:00] microbiologists all these folks that are
[2:29:03] studying it they're finding out more and
[2:29:05] more and more about it Lord but we
[2:29:08] realize its origin we realize father
[2:29:11] it's demons so Lord God we pray bring
[2:29:15] healing to our nation father to our
[2:29:18] world I think about our brothers and
[2:29:20] sisters in the third world countries god
[2:29:21] they're suffering greatly I pray for
[2:29:24] them father for the sake of your elect
[2:29:26] Lord Jesus and Lord as we get back to
[2:29:30] work and get to come back to church and
[2:29:32] start to be able to go back to a normal
[2:29:34] sea of our lives father I pray that not
[2:29:36] be a resurgence of this thing Lord
[2:29:38] dear God may it leave us Granite Lord
[2:29:42] Jesus help us I pray father I know some
[2:29:45] of you children have actually succumbed
[2:29:47] to this and died Lord some of the
[2:29:49] message have actually died because of it
[2:29:51] some Lord just sharing some more today
[2:29:53] that have gotten sick one very very sick
[2:29:56] and then Lord another one in the same
[2:29:58] household Lord hardly any symptoms at
[2:30:01] all so it's it's a mystery it's an
[2:30:03] unusual thing how it affects us the Lord
[2:30:06] God it ain't no mystery to you nor do we
[2:30:09] believe the stripes that was laid upon
[2:30:10] your back covered this as well as into
[2:30:13] everything else Minister healing I pray
[2:30:16] to your children father we love you
[2:30:18] tonight Lord in the name of Jesus God

[2:31:01] will

[2:31:05] it's a greek word in the in description
[2:31:07] so god help us to do it brother we got
[2:31:11] to do that every time we hear the word
[2:31:13] just get rid of our wheel take God's
[2:31:15] will every every sir every temptation
[2:31:18] every trial amen God allows this God
[2:31:23] loves that just to see and you it'll
[2:31:25] bring out with your going and living in
[2:31:29] his will or living according to your own
[2:31:30] a man but it's most people today are
[2:31:34] living according to their own will you
[2:31:36] know the the will of their selfish will
[2:31:39] human will they controlled what they do
[2:31:42] how they do it when they do it where
[2:31:44] they do it I don't think and so on it's
[2:31:47] just serious human will oh well I should
[2:31:50] do this I should do that well what does
[2:31:52] God want you to do how does God want you
[2:31:55] to do it where does God want to do it
[2:31:56] when what what's the attitude God wants
[2:31:59] us to have what's the action or reaction
[2:32:02] that God wants to test see if we're born
[2:32:05] again we're going to reflect the nature
[2:32:09] of the one they're born were born by and
[2:32:13] it's God amen but there's too many
[2:32:16] that's really not born again they're
[2:32:18] religious but I born again if you're
[2:32:21] born again it's Christ in you if you're
[2:32:23] born again you got the nature of Christ
[2:32:25] you got the nature of God a man
[2:32:27] wonderful and well if you're if you're
[2:32:30] born again your reconciled this is
[2:32:34] absolutely amazing it's not just getting
[2:32:36] getting religious or I'm going to become
[2:32:40] a Christian home you got to be
[2:32:43] reconciled back to what you were a man
[2:32:46] so thank God for the
[2:32:48] for their greater revelation of
[2:32:50] reconciliation by the grace of God the
[2:32:54] scripture says it says for the love of
[2:32:59] christ constraineth us because we thus
[2:33:03] judge that if one died for all then
[2:33:06] we're all dead
[2:33:07] a man and when we say all we're not
[2:33:10] referred to all the world but we're
[2:33:13] referring to all the seed of God the
[2:33:15] predestinated seed those whom he
[2:33:17] foreknew before the foundation of the
[2:33:20] world and it says that he died for all
[2:33:23] and that they which live should not
[2:33:27] henceforth live unto themselves but unto
[2:33:30] Him which died for them and rose again
[2:33:33] amen
[2:33:34] see Christians are living for Jesus and
[2:33:38] a living and again it's not now then but
[2:33:41] Christ living out through them by grace
[2:33:44] this is absolutely amazing wherefore in
[2:33:48] sport no we no man after the flesh
[2:33:51] yeh though we have known Christ after
[2:33:54] the flesh yet now in sport no we am no
[2:33:57] more a man not after the flesh no we're
[2:34:03] waiting to get into a glorified state by
[2:34:05] the grace of God born again by the grace
[2:34:08] of God not sinful flesh no no
[2:34:13] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[2:34:16] a new creature before we were born again
[2:34:20] we lived after the flesh according to
[2:34:22] the flesh the will of the flesh and so
[2:34:24] on you know he's just doing what doing
[2:34:26] what human nature would give us to do
[2:34:28] but now we got divine only ghost nature
[2:34:32] amen therefore therefore if any man be
[2:34:37] in Christ he is a new creature old
[2:34:40] things grace to us grace old the old
[2:34:47] things are passed away oh my
[2:34:51] I trust by grace that the old nature has
[2:34:55] passed away and not not controlling us
[2:34:58] amen
[2:35:00] and it says behold all things are become
[2:35:05] new
[2:35:06] a man praise them all things become new
[2:35:09] you're a new creature in Christ grace
[2:35:13] grace grace and all things are of God
[2:35:16] who has reconciled us to himself by
[2:35:21] Jesus Christ he's brought us back to
[2:35:24] himself and his nature and has given to
[2:35:28] us the Ministry of reconciliation praise
[2:35:33] the Lord
[2:35:33] you're gonna reflect that to family
[2:35:35] friends neighbors so on amen that you're
[2:35:38] absolutely different person to know that
[2:35:42] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[2:35:45] unto himself not imputing their
[2:35:48] trespasses unto them and has committed
[2:35:51] unto us the word of reconciliation now
[2:35:57] then we are ambassadors for Christ as
[2:35:59] though God did beseech you by us we pray
[2:36:02] you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled
[2:36:06] to God amen praise the Lord
[2:36:10] thank God for the Ministry of
[2:36:13] reconciliation by the Holy Ghost amen
[2:36:17] through our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[2:36:24] just needed this quote
[2:36:32] he said referring to again this is the
[2:36:38] message that administered on and knoweth
[2:36:41] it not he said oh my brother sister
[2:36:45] every one of you conscious I know what
[2:36:48] that means
[2:36:49] he said just watch he says stay close to
[2:36:53] Christ and he said let me warn you as a
[2:36:57] minister of the gospel
[2:36:59] don't take any foolishness a man don't
[2:37:07] imagine anything stay right there until
[2:37:10] this inside of the inside is anchored to
[2:37:14] the word and that you're right in Christ
[2:37:17] because that's the only thing he said
[2:37:20] because we're in the most deceiving age
[2:37:23] that we ever lived in and it would
[2:37:25] deceive the very elect if possible
[2:37:27] he said because they have anointing and
[2:37:30] he says they can do anything like the
[2:37:32] rest of them but not stay with the word
[2:37:36] they can feel God since God after God's
[2:37:39] anointing and yet refuse his word oh
[2:37:42] yeah
[2:37:43] God allows this God allows that to bring
[2:37:46] out this to bring out that and so on
[2:37:48] what is anointing yes so let's make sure
[2:37:52] it's anointing is a man is bringing us
[2:37:55] more and more to eternal life amen
[2:37:58] not condemn us but save us for some of
[2:38:02] the anointing will condemn them amen
[2:38:04] because they won't stay with the word so
[2:38:07] he said it would deceive the very elect
[2:38:08] if possible because they have anointing
[2:38:11] and they can do anything
[2:38:13] like the rest of them and Lord willing
[2:38:16] we'll bring those things out in the
[2:38:18] message at ninety ones at the endtime
[2:38:20] tremendous it's serious it's absolutely
[2:38:23] serious
[2:38:24] gotta keep coming back to the word
[2:38:26] everything everything gotta be judged by
[2:38:29] the word a man he said clean up your
[2:38:33] lives pay your debts oh no man remember
[2:38:37] in the name of the Lord
[2:38:39] something is fixing to happen and he
[2:38:43] said are we coming here playing a game
[2:38:46] are we coming here meeting as a lodge he
[2:38:50] said Christ can't come on to the church
[2:38:52] is perfectly right he is waiting on us
[2:38:57] this coming line with the word stay in
[2:39:00] line with the word a man by the grace of
