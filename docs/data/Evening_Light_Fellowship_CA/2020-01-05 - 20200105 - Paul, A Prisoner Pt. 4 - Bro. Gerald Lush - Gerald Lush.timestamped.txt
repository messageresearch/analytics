[48:49] [Music]
[48:51] amen praise the Lord God blesses will
[48:54] give the glory to Jesus but let's tell
[48:57] of his wonderful love a man that he
[49:00] loved us a man truly had to see
[49:03] something that we didn't see event ever
[49:05] the devil was putting putting us the
[49:07] emphasis on other things negative things
[49:09] but Jesus was seeing the positive amen
[49:12] Satan was reminding us you're born and
[49:15] see it conceived and seeing shaped in
[49:17] iniquity you come to the world speaking
[49:18] lies a man would thank God that Jesus
[49:21] saw something else a seed in our hearts
[49:24] a man and all he needed to do is water
[49:27] that seed oh and it would come forth I
[49:30] trust this bringing forth the revelation
[49:32] of Christ in you amen by the grace of
[49:34] God Amen Lord bless you turn with me to
[49:37] the Book of Luke chapter 22 amen
[49:41] and considering the number of sermons I
[49:43] have to press to preach three or four
[49:45] sermons this morning a man so we'll see
[49:49] what the weather's going to be like well
[49:51] we leave that with the Lord amen so it
[49:55] is absolutely amazing that you that I
[49:57] could go so far not to preach not preach
[49:59] not preach amen
[50:01] and it's really a burden so we pray the
[50:04] Lord be with us and help me as we go
[50:05] further into what we've been ministering
[50:07] on and it has to do with being a
[50:10] prisoner of Jesus Christ
[50:11] a man not a prisoner of the devil and
[50:15] for the world this the last few days
[50:17] they've been prisoners of Santa Claus
[50:19] that's the truth they've been prisoners
[50:21] of Santa Claus and it's amazing after
[50:23] all those years they don't want to bring
[50:25] Christ into craving into Christmas they
[50:27] want they want still put the emphasis on
[50:29] Santa Claus Santa Claus Santa Claus a
[50:31] man and Santa Claus well I won't say it
[50:34] but you know a van we're gonna put the
[50:37] images on Jesus amen because we know
[50:40] Santa Claus is a lie
[50:41] they've made it remember as as the devil
[50:44] lied to Eve at the beginning and whether
[50:47] he's like a plaintiff there there's us
[50:48] Eve's a day he's still lying to her a
[50:51] man and what it was then so it is now
[50:54] always good it's wonderful is this is
[50:56] this is this well let's get let's become
[50:58] a person of Christ

[51:01] attitude Amen to see if we think it's
[51:03] still good
[51:04] hey vana says our brother was
[51:06] appreciated that God is good
[51:07] hey man let's see if we really believe
[51:09] most of the world they believe the Santa
[51:11] Claus is good no no we believe Jesus is
[51:15] good god is good
[51:16] a man considering the mercy and the
[51:19] grace that he has toward us he's good
[51:21] a man we don't deserve it that's the
[51:23] truth in this flesh we don't deserve it
[51:25] amen but still praise the Lord he came
[51:28] and did what he did in a sinless body a
[51:31] man he laid down his life picked it up
[51:33] again what is it what for not for
[51:35] himself for you and me a man he could
[51:38] have called ten thousand angels
[51:39] destroyed the world set him free but he
[51:41] didn't do it you know why he stayed
[51:43] there for you and me
[51:44] hey man praise the Lord you talked about
[51:47] the prisoner to Christ he was a prisoner
[51:49] to Redemption a man he wanted to do what
[51:52] he had to do to redeem us and remember
[51:54] again he fought it or he struggled with
[51:57] this in the flesh but and he went and
[51:59] win and win and to finally he said not
[52:01] my will
[52:01] I'd be done amen let the Word of God
[52:04] that let that preeminence in you and in
[52:07] me a man is not what I want it's what
[52:10] God wants it's not what I want to do
[52:12] it's what God wants to do and this is
[52:14] Saints did anything God wants to do
[52:16] right now it is the resurrection and the
[52:18] rapture a mad look will again look back
[52:21] what God was doing in Luther's age
[52:23] Wesley's age - Pentecostal age so what's
[52:26] he doing now

[53:04] revelation there and the revelation that
[53:06] John out of Jesus a man I said Lord this
[53:09] is a witness to the world this is
[53:11] absolute I was absolutely amazed
[53:13] because all through the book they had
[53:15] this they had that about Jesus they're
[53:16] dead about his method of ministry and to
[53:19] finally they got into revelation and the
[53:21] revelation that John add of Jesus a man
[53:23] and the revelation that Christ was
[53:25] revealing the John concerning the the
[53:27] mystery of the seven seals as I said
[53:30] what they're seeing that if they're
[53:32] seeing that what are we to see a man if
[53:35] they are acknowledging that and but
[53:37] that's one of the most famous magazines
[53:40] around the world and it's been on the
[53:42] goal for years and years and years I
[53:44] remember as a boy that my parents you

[53:48] monthly basis to their homes a man and
[53:50] now it's out there still still in the
[53:52] supermarket still in the end where over

[54:02] gonna be a witness to the whole world
[54:03] a man that's the truth concerning Jesus
[54:06] a man Jesus but concerning the mystery
[54:09] of the seven seals that's to the bright
[54:11] and is to give us a resurrection and

[55:01] this morning
[55:02] amen so Lord bless you and in Luke
[55:05] chapter 22 and beginning to read at
[55:10] verse 28 that we have read this before
[55:13] but to bring to our remembrance because
[55:17] we have missed maybe several services
[55:19] and it says in verse 28 ye are they
[55:24] which have continued
[55:27] than my temptations a man and he said an
[55:31] I appoint unto you a kingdom as my
[55:35] father has appointed unto me a man
[55:38] wonderful that ye may eat and drink at
[55:42] my table in my kingdom praise the Lord
[55:46] and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes
[55:51] of Israel
[55:52] let's give God the glory brother
[55:55] Lilith's brother let's see if Amen God
[55:58] is putting you to the test here by the
[56:01] grace of God a man so you can judge
[56:04] things there you were judged things
[56:06] there a man and you're going to judge it
[56:08] by the words you're going to stay but
[56:09] with the word a man it's got to be the
[56:11] truth the whole truth nothing but the
[56:12] truth and it says so he said eat and
[56:15] drink that you made and drink at my
[56:17] table in my kingdom and sit on the
[56:20] thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[56:23] Israel and the Lord said Simon Simon
[56:27] behold Satan has desired to have you
[56:31] then he may sift you as wheat and he was
[56:35] desired to have Simon he desired to have
[56:37] us that he may sift us as wheat but he
[56:41] said I have prayed for thee that thy
[56:44] faith fail not and when thou art
[56:46] converted a man thank God Jesus prayed
[56:51] for Peter jesus prayed for you and me so
[56:54] that when we were converted we were
[56:55] going to become prisoners to him a man
[56:58] and prisoners to the word so he said I
[57:01] have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
[57:05] not email because he believed that Jesus
[57:09] was the Messiah and when thou art
[57:12] converted strengthen thy brethren and if
[57:16] we are converted will strengthen our
[57:18] brothers and sisters in the faith a man
[57:20] Nigel please in the name of the Lord
[57:22] we're not living just living for
[57:23] ourselves we're living for Christ and
[57:26] we're living for Christ we're living for
[57:27] the body of Christ a man because Christ
[57:30] is in his body the bride and he said
[57:34] unto Him Lord I am ready to go with thee
[57:36] both into prison and to death
[57:40] a man and he said I tell thee Peter the
[57:45] shall not crow this day before thou
[57:49] as well did not
[57:50] thrice deny that thou knowest me a man
[57:54] it was before he was converted not after
[57:57] but after he would never deny you
[58:00] godless his word may be seated
[58:02] and after when Peter was imprisoned he
[58:07] was a prisoner of Christ before the
[58:09] remember before you become a prisoner
[58:10] when it comes to the natural presence of
[58:13] this day you become a spiritual prisoner
[58:15] to Jesus a man Paul was a prisoner of
[58:18] Jesus Peter became a prisoner of Jesus a
[58:21] man and then when he was converted a man
[58:24] by the grace of God he truly entered
[58:26] into that that control of our Lord Jesus
[58:30] Christ so that to the extent that
[58:32] brother when they were going to take
[58:33] Peters life he didn't want to do it the
[58:35] way they want to do it he said I tell
[58:37] you there were two crucify him as Peter
[58:39] has he crucified Jesus they did but he
[58:42] said now he said but don't do it the way
[58:44] you did Jesus and he said because Jesus
[58:46] was like this but he said I want you to
[58:48] deter me I'd down all mine
[58:51] praise the name of the Lord just think
[58:53] that he wasn't worthy he didn't feel
[58:56] worthy to die the same way that Jesus
[58:58] died on the cross now we know that we
[59:00] will see the cross I know that there's
[59:03] there's there crosses there somewhere
[59:05] but but when it's not exactly the cross
[59:08] that they crucified Jesus on because the
[59:11] cross that word that we're having now
[59:13] really it's the image that they started
[59:15] with the Catholic Church and it
[59:17] continues right on down to this hour and
[59:19] it's a cross like this but that's not
[59:21] what Jesus was crucified on while Jesus
[59:24] was crucified on was this a man it
[59:27] wasn't this it was this a man why
[59:30] because well I'll come that they would
[59:33] do that
[59:34] because when they do that a man then
[59:37] they they're going to they're going to
[59:38] die because they're trying to get their
[59:40] breath and they can't get the red a man
[59:43] and it's the same thing when Jesus of
[59:45] course he already a down he's like a man
[59:47] but the thing of it is what happened to
[59:49] those two two thieves that were
[59:50] crucified with him
[59:52] but they were holding their feet and
[59:54] holding their body up trying to stay
[59:56] alive trying to trying to keep their
[59:58] breath and so on but Jesus let go and
[1:00:00] Jesus died he gave up the ghost amen he
[1:00:04] willingly they didn't take it from him
[1:00:06] he willingly laid down his life for you
[1:00:08] and for me
[1:00:09] amen praise the name of the Lord the
[1:00:12] devil was there to try to kill him but
[1:00:14] he laid down his life a man he gave up
[1:00:16] his life but when it comes through the
[1:00:18] other thieves they went the soldiers
[1:00:20] went there what do they do they drove a
[1:00:21] spear at their side a man so their blood
[1:00:24] would go out banner and they would just
[1:00:26] I don't know they didn't drive the spear
[1:00:28] in their sight they broke their legs a
[1:00:30] man they broke their legs praise the
[1:00:33] name of the Lord because the Bible
[1:00:35] prophesy concerning Jesus that not a
[1:00:37] bone should be broken praises the name
[1:00:39] of the Lord Amen hallelujah for they
[1:00:43] broke their the legs of the thieves so
[1:00:45] that they never had the strength to keep
[1:00:46] themselves up and to keep breathe
[1:00:48] breathing and so they just suffocated
[1:00:50] and they died but when they got the
[1:00:52] Jesus says oh he's already dead what
[1:00:56] he's already dead yeah why because he
[1:00:59] gave up his life he didn't lose it
[1:01:01] because of while he was on the cross but
[1:01:03] he gave it up he yielded up the ghost
[1:01:05] but still a man there was no bone broken
[1:01:08] that was prophecy praise the Lord
[1:01:10] but still they drove the sword amen and
[1:01:13] the spear in his sight why because the
[1:01:16] blood had to be shed a man he was sure
[1:01:19] he's going to shed his blood for you and
[1:01:20] me and brother the thing of it is the
[1:01:22] prophet has highlighted it and he said
[1:01:24] the blood where did that blood go a man
[1:01:26] he says that blood went down he said to
[1:01:29] the earth he said because he's not only
[1:01:31] redeeming you and me he's redeeming the
[1:01:33] earth praising hallelujah he said where
[1:01:36] he said we're gonna receive a new body
[1:01:38] like unto his glorified body and he see
[1:01:40] there's going to be a new heaven and a
[1:01:41] new earth a man redeemed he said as
[1:01:44] we're changed so the earth is changed as
[1:01:46] we're changed so the heaven is change a
[1:01:48] man just think as I said we're going out
[1:01:50] of time and into eternity and we're
[1:01:52] going out of the case of man into the
[1:01:55] kingdoms of God and just saying there's
[1:01:57] going to be absolutely no sin there's
[1:01:59] going to be absolutely nothing to remind
[1:02:01] us of sin there's gonna be nothing in
[1:02:03] our flesh
[1:02:03] nothing in her bodies nothing they may
[1:02:05] that we're not going aqua amen to top of
[1:02:08] God taking Oh taking it all away from
[1:02:10] our memory amen
[1:02:12] we're going to go into a bar listen by
[1:02:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost restores
[1:02:16] our memory and we now we know where we
[1:02:18] come from and by the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:20] Ghost and the Word of God we know where
[1:02:23] we're going
[1:02:23] amen we are the sons and daughters of
[1:02:26] God and he may have filled with the Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost the life of God to take us back
[1:02:30] will he come from he knows us no it's
[1:02:33] not it's not that there is say a serpent
[1:02:35] seed out there there's the seed of the
[1:02:37] devil a man but God is looking for any
[1:02:40] redeem what the seat of God those who me
[1:02:42] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:02:44] those that were with him any in eternity
[1:02:47] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:48] we were in theophany bodies a man but
[1:02:52] Jesus came to lay down his life to share
[1:02:54] his life with you and me to bring us
[1:02:56] back to a glorified body a man and
[1:02:59] brother like onto the body that he
[1:03:01] raised up from the dead a body that
[1:03:03] didn't know when he sinned amen he
[1:03:05] identified that he was tested in all
[1:03:07] points like as we are yet without sin a
[1:03:10] man thank God for that
[1:03:12] absolute perfect sacrifice a man and
[1:03:15] brother hallelujah and you get to the
[1:03:18] revelation of Jesus the revelation of
[1:03:21] redemption you're going to become a
[1:03:23] prisoner to Jesus a man not a prisoner
[1:03:26] to the Rome that a prisoner to this
[1:03:28] church or that church not a prisoner to
[1:03:30] the governments of the world amen
[1:03:31] you're a prisoner to Jesus a man and
[1:03:34] you're gonna do what Jesus wants you to
[1:03:36] do when he wants you to do it how he
[1:03:37] wants to do it and where he wants you to
[1:03:40] do it brother sister we come to the will
[1:03:42] of God now I will then be done amen and
[1:03:45] brother what was the will of God that
[1:03:47] controlled all of the will that
[1:03:48] controlled us in these last few days
[1:03:51] what was the will that control you in
[1:03:53] the last few days brother are we living
[1:03:55] for ourselves are we living for Jesus
[1:03:57] amen and we are going to go forward
[1:03:59] reflecting our natural lives are we
[1:04:02] going forward to reflect the life of
[1:04:03] Jesus amen by the grace of Almighty God
[1:04:06] amen brother and this is this is what
[1:04:09] the new birth is all about you're dead
[1:04:11] the crisis living in you
[1:04:13] amen and if you're dead to you to
[1:04:15] yourself and you're dead to your old
[1:04:17] nature rather than the new nature's in
[1:04:20] control amen when it comes to your
[1:04:22] thoughts and your motives and your
[1:04:24] objectives amen it's all under the
[1:04:27] control of the new nature it's all of
[1:04:29] the control of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:33] again it is not you that it is what race
[1:04:35] they live within you brother
[1:04:36] ease in control a man so it was in
[1:04:40] control these last few days who has been
[1:04:43] in control these last couple of weeks
[1:04:44] when we when we have put off the
[1:04:47] services to put off the services and so
[1:04:49] on
[1:04:49] amen who are we serving a man I trust
[1:04:53] brother that we still we don't we don't
[1:04:54] lose and lose the remembrance of Jesus I
[1:04:57] trust we did we weren't giving no
[1:04:59] attention to Santa Claus amen brother
[1:05:03] then again he's the god of this world a
[1:05:06] man especially at this time of the year
[1:05:09] and again when it comes to another two
[1:05:10] or three months and Easter comes they're
[1:05:12] going to make the the rabbits the god of
[1:05:14] this world a man when I know Jesus see
[1:05:18] they're putting less and less emphasis
[1:05:19] on cheese and brother as it was in the
[1:05:22] sin in the first ministry of the
[1:05:24] revealed Word 2,000 years ago so it is
[1:05:27] in this hour and in these last days
[1:05:28] there's going to be less and less and
[1:05:31] less emphasis put on Jesus as the
[1:05:34] absolute truth and as I reminded you
[1:05:36] where the prophet of God did ask the
[1:05:38] Lord the question when he was in that
[1:05:40] hotel and they wanted to see him want to
[1:05:42] see him and he said Lord who are they
[1:05:43] coming to see near you they were coming
[1:05:45] to see William Branham they were coming
[1:05:48] to see this they're coming to see that
[1:05:49] but not Jesus why because they wanted a
[1:05:52] miracle they wanted healing a man and
[1:05:55] they'll probably do that their emphasis
[1:05:57] wasn't on Jesus give the glory to Jesus
[1:06:00] it was they ought to get what they
[1:06:02] wanted amen and brothers are part of God
[1:06:04] said you can be healed and go to hell
[1:06:06] amen and you can have the Holy Ghost he
[1:06:09] said on your life outside wordly and he
[1:06:11] said and go to hell you can have it 24
[1:06:13] hours a day so then go to hell
[1:06:15] a man but that's all I were to saw what
[1:06:17] you're feeling in your flesh is all what
[1:06:19] you're doing your pleasure and what you
[1:06:21] want in your flesh what is your you feel
[1:06:23] in your soul and whatever you want in
[1:06:25] your soul what
[1:06:26] the soul on weena thirsting for a man if
[1:06:29] we were born again by the baptism of the
[1:06:32] Holy Ghost we're hungry and thirsty for
[1:06:34] the same thing Jesus I'm gonna thirst
[1:06:35] for a man and that was the good at a
[1:06:38] time and into eternity and then again
[1:06:41] that's why he said much longer shall I
[1:06:44] be with you and he said he said the
[1:06:46] finally he got he cut he passed by the
[1:06:49] first or second pole and he and he was
[1:06:51] entering the third pole and he said well
[1:06:53] he said I have no more in the world oh
[1:06:55] brother what a revelation amen
[1:06:58] it a come to that hour to come to that
[1:07:00] place in his natural life in the
[1:07:03] physical life amen the lay down his life
[1:07:05] pick it up again amen and go from time
[1:07:08] to eternity a man and he was anyway he
[1:07:11] would send the anointing of the of that
[1:07:13] light the anointing of the blood that he
[1:07:15] was going to shed the life of the blood
[1:07:16] that he was setting he was going to send
[1:07:18] it back to this to catch his sons and
[1:07:20] daughters and they were going to bring
[1:07:23] us back to glory praise the name of the
[1:07:26] Lord Alleluia brother God's got a plan
[1:07:28] God's got a purpose in God's plan a
[1:07:30] pattern and brother I tell you it wasn't
[1:07:33] emphasized with them through the church
[1:07:35] ages only in the last stage it was an
[1:07:38] emphasis even in the Pentecostal age but
[1:07:40] it was mainly in this last page amen and
[1:07:43] that is why God sent Malachi for a may
[1:07:47] that is why the Prophet was sent on the
[1:07:49] scene a man a man it was to reveal Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ like John the bed and point the
[1:07:54] boy to Jesus Christ but it was also to
[1:07:57] give us the revelation we need in this
[1:08:00] day
[1:08:00] what is that revelation it is the
[1:08:02] revelation that God got a plan
[1:08:04] God got a purpose and God got a pattern
[1:08:07] Amen because no other age was kidding
[1:08:09] but it was taken into consideration the
[1:08:11] plan the purpose of the pattern
[1:08:13] oh god I tell you this brother sister
[1:08:15] mother most that we knew was oh yeah oh
[1:08:18] yeah the devil did that in the Garden of
[1:08:20] Eden and we're all in seeing so Jesus
[1:08:22] has come to save us from sin if we want
[1:08:25] to be saying amen not having the
[1:08:27] revelation of the pre decimated seed of
[1:08:30] God amen

[1:12:25] believers brother sister amen they're
[1:12:28] not doing what Jesus wants them to do
[1:12:29] they're doing what they want to do and
[1:12:31] really it is Satan influencing them in
[1:12:34] their flesh it is Satan influencing I
[1:12:36] saying that as our as the flesh and the
[1:12:38] natural things of life not the spiritual
[1:12:40] but brother it were born again we are
[1:12:43] caught up and caught into the revelation
[1:12:45] of what God is doing
[1:12:47] amen we're not gonna look back and say
[1:12:49] he did this and he did that oh yeah I
[1:12:51] did this with Luther he did that with
[1:12:53] Wesley did that with it willaboo he did
[1:12:55] that with a better cause no no what is
[1:12:57] he doing now see he was trying to get
[1:12:59] Martha into the presence to tense
[1:13:01] revelation of Jesus Christ and when he
[1:13:04] said Martha I
[1:13:06] am the resurrection and life believest
[1:13:08] thou this a man not dead Lancers is
[1:13:12] going to rise up in the future but he
[1:13:14] said I in the resurrection why the
[1:13:16] resurrections right there a man no no
[1:13:19] the resurrection wasn't up in the future
[1:13:20] the resurrection was raped right in the
[1:13:22] present tense he was right there outside
[1:13:24] outside Lazarus - hey and as I said they
[1:13:28] noted in the Bible that Jesus wept and
[1:13:30] again he wasn't crying for Lazarus boy
[1:13:33] in the world would he cry for Lazarus a
[1:13:35] man because he said he said I got to go
[1:13:37] around and wake him out of his sleep he
[1:13:40] knew what he was going to do and he and
[1:13:42] the way that he said Lazarus is not dead
[1:13:44] I trust praise the Lord amen I trust the
[1:13:48] saints that are gone on they're not dead
[1:13:49] what do you mean dead totally separated
[1:13:52] from God
[1:13:52] amen but there are those that are dead
[1:13:55] in Christ amen but they're not separated
[1:13:57] from God amen to God be the glory amen
[1:14:00] so Jesus and Jesus stood there and he
[1:14:03] was crying because of their unbelief oh
[1:14:05] yeah and they didn't believe oh yeah
[1:14:08] we're all come to these state of ways
[1:14:10] for so long and now he's here because
[1:14:12] Lazarus is dead and Lazarus in the tomb
[1:14:14] and now he's crying and even they
[1:14:16] thought well if he if he came back when
[1:14:18] Lazarus was sick he with a healed
[1:14:20] Lazarus and those who wouldn't have died
[1:14:22] but as far as these were concerned it
[1:14:24] was no man no more for Jesus to raise
[1:14:26] him than to heal him hey man Alleluia so
[1:14:30] brother we thank God for the revelation
[1:14:32] that God has given us in this hour of
[1:14:34] Jesus but let's not let's not let's not
[1:14:37] turn it down let's not turn away from it
[1:14:39] let's not ignore it
[1:14:40] brother we gotta we gotta read and
[1:14:42] become one with the revelation one with
[1:14:44] the revelation what God has done and one
[1:14:46] with the revelation what God is doing
[1:14:49] amen so let's not let's not reject the
[1:14:52] revelation and there's a quote sure you
[1:14:54] can pick up on the way out and it's
[1:14:56] referring to rejecting Jesus oh yeah he
[1:15:00] said they said they rejected Moses you
[1:15:03] rejected this prophet that prophet who
[1:15:05] they're rejecting they're rejecting God
[1:15:06] they're rejecting Jesus amen and to
[1:15:10] reject the revelation that God has
[1:15:11] ordained for them right in this hour if
[1:15:13] surgery is to reject Jesus amen
[1:15:16] God is Jesus easier and Jesus is
[1:15:18] endeavoring to give us what we have knee
[1:15:20] a million and yet there's a lot of
[1:15:22] believers have rejected it oh yeah
[1:15:25] there's a lot of hi and I don't know be
[1:15:27] offended but a lot of believers that are
[1:15:28] living more for their natural family
[1:15:30] than they are for Jesus brother you
[1:15:33] can't live for your natural family the
[1:15:34] way you should
[1:15:35] unless you live for Jesus first Jemez if
[1:15:38] you live for Jesus and he got
[1:15:40] preeminence in your life now you know
[1:15:41] you go and live and live for your family
[1:15:44] and now you can go and be the example
[1:15:46] that God wants you to be to your sons
[1:15:48] your daughters a man your husband your
[1:15:50] wife a man grandmas and grandpas a man
[1:15:53] see it's got to be Christ is Christ
[1:15:56] Christ in them Christ in you a million
[1:15:58] by the grace of Almighty God so God
[1:16:01] elbows brother that we will lay aside
[1:16:03] every weight and every sin that easily
[1:16:05] besets us amen every weight and every
[1:16:09] sin that the devil can use to weaken us
[1:16:11] the desert they used to get us out of
[1:16:13] the will of God a man so brother let's
[1:16:15] make sure that we are a prisoner of
[1:16:17] Jesus Christ and not a prisoner of the
[1:16:19] devil a man he became a prisoner of
[1:16:22] Satan he became a prisoner of the server
[1:16:25] of the serpent amen brother banana gain
[1:16:28] hey Adam was still a prisoner of God but
[1:16:31] he voluntarily put himself in sin with
[1:16:34] Eve so that God redeeming Adam would
[1:16:36] redeem Eve see that spirit of Christ in
[1:16:40] the first annum and the Spirit of Christ
[1:16:41] in the second Adam any man the second
[1:16:44] Adam put himself and said for you and me
[1:16:47] so they hallelujah redemption in him
[1:16:50] will bring for redemption in you and me
[1:16:52] brother although the Bible is absolutely
[1:16:54] perfect amen
[1:16:56] the Word of God is absolutely perfect
[1:16:59] eight million and brother again it's
[1:17:01] only in this hour to the bride that we
[1:17:03] got the revelation of planned purpose
[1:17:05] and pattern
[1:17:05] why so that will recognize what God has
[1:17:09] done what God is doing and what God will
[1:17:12] do how do we know it because of the
[1:17:15] revelation of the plan the purpose and
[1:17:17] the pattern amen they didn't need that
[1:17:19] full revelation in other ages like we do
[1:17:22] now
[1:17:23] amen because they God just know what
[1:17:25] they need it for that our take them
[1:17:27] through that age
[1:17:28] a Manny and the next stage in the next
[1:17:30] stage Amen moving on moving on 8 million
[1:17:33] but in this hour brother without moving
[1:17:35] from one age to another we're moving
[1:17:36] from time to eternity hey man so brother
[1:17:40] God is requiring more of us than he
[1:17:42] required although the other ages hey
[1:17:44] because God has given us a greater
[1:17:46] revelation than he has given the others
[1:17:48] and they they never preached planned
[1:17:50] purpose and pattern they just all mine
[1:17:53] well well praise the Lord we're sinners
[1:17:55] wiener in need of celebrations thank you
[1:17:57] Jesus for saving us and they went on and
[1:17:58] preached it salvation salvation
[1:18:00] salvation but now and that was the
[1:18:03] salvation of our souls
[1:18:04] anybody oh we're gonna go to heaven
[1:18:06] we're gonna go to heaven amen
[1:18:08] when we die no now we're to the place
[1:18:11] where if the if the daddy Christ rise
[1:18:15] first
[1:18:15] what about those that are alive you song
[1:18:18] the song those that are alive are gonna
[1:18:20] rise a man and we're going to ascend
[1:18:23] with the dead in Christ to meet the Lord
[1:18:25] in the air
[1:18:25] hey bad prey and the emphasis was
[1:18:28] important listen he's been in the
[1:18:30] Pentecostal age there was some depth of
[1:18:32] the emphasis on the resurrection of
[1:18:34] rapture but MOOCs are putting the
[1:18:35] emphasis on the gifts and the signs and
[1:18:38] the wonders a million two finally God
[1:18:40] takes all that away preach the Lord any
[1:18:43] minute he takes it all the way so that
[1:18:45] now we believe the word because see it
[1:18:48] got our attention to the Lord and saying
[1:18:50] again praise the Lord
[1:18:52] God God gave the prophet of God that you
[1:18:54] know there this sign in the hand and oh
[1:18:57] yeah left hand not the right amazing we
[1:19:01] shake hands with our shake right hands
[1:19:03] but no it's the left hand was it it's
[1:19:07] hard to hurt amen praise the Lord and he
[1:19:12] gave me that sight of the hand and he
[1:19:13] gave me the power of the anointing of
[1:19:15] the revealed word of the Messiah God
[1:19:19] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:19:20] the heart
[1:19:21] and what for what was that for what did
[1:19:23] God do that to get their attention it
[1:19:27] wasn't all just to heal them just to do
[1:19:29] this just to do that know once to get
[1:19:30] their attention
[1:19:31] but after after after he had used that
[1:19:34] person's second pull aim and of these
[1:19:36] two signs and and what happened till
[1:19:39] finally got had to tell him to stop it
[1:19:42] praise the Lord Gaza stop it don't use
[1:19:44] that don't use those signs no more he
[1:19:45] could but but to fight anyway because
[1:19:48] they were leaning on the signpost a man
[1:19:52] it's like I said but but us years and
[1:19:55] years and years ago when we when we
[1:19:57] first lived in here at Saint John's and
[1:19:59] we would drive from our hometown back
[1:20:01] here during the summer and we look after
[1:20:03] a while would be looking at the signs oh
[1:20:05] how much longer how much longer oh oh

[1:20:11] at st. John's this yeah well I'll tell
[1:20:13] you

[1:20:16] different
[1:20:17] a man brother back in Pentecost if one
[1:20:20] thing now it's different a man know now
[1:20:24] the signs are going to strike us
[1:20:25] differently it's going it's going to
[1:20:27] produce in us something that anybody
[1:20:29] that the other message has never
[1:20:30] produced that's the truth praise the
[1:20:32] name of the Lord
[1:20:33] I'll turn you all down through was just
[1:20:36] adding to their faith adding to their
[1:20:37] faith justification sanctification the
[1:20:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[1:20:41] the Spirit but now God is giving us
[1:20:43] faith for rapture any man that this
[1:20:47] brother God Israel is requiring a
[1:20:50] tremendous revelation of us tremendous
[1:20:52] faith you talk about without faith it is
[1:20:55] impossible to please God amen and
[1:20:58] whether it's got me the faith that God
[1:20:59] is looking for in you and in me a man
[1:21:03] Bible says by faith able to this my
[1:21:05] faith that you know Noah did it by faith
[1:21:08] Enoch did this it's a man by faith by
[1:21:10] faith by faith God gave him their faith
[1:21:13] and that was the painter please God a
[1:21:15] may just say well the faith that it ever
[1:21:17] there please God in a table was the
[1:21:19] right sacrifice amen
[1:21:22] they paid that please God and Noah was
[1:21:24] believing what God said about the flood
[1:21:26] in the ark and he built the ark amen
[1:21:28] it was the evidence of his faith amen
[1:21:31] praise the name of the Lord and Noah was
[1:21:34] the voice that the ark was a sign oh
[1:21:36] yeah praise the name of the Lord and
[1:21:39] then what we've with a port for Enoch
[1:21:42] because before Oh hallelujah Amen
[1:21:44] because before the flood came
[1:21:46] Enoch walked with God was not because
[1:21:50] God took him hey and yet he know he had
[1:21:53] that son and we need any and
[1:21:55] in the name of his son prophesied of the
[1:21:58] judgment that was coming on the air

[1:22:33] wouldn't destroy the earth with a flood
[1:22:34] no more
[1:22:35] I said noise he's not I said but that's
[1:22:37] that's the sign of God's judgment I said
[1:22:39] is not God destroying the earth like he
[1:22:41] did in the days of Noah I said it's just
[1:22:43] a judgment that God is striking this

[1:29:15] door in going into the chapel and he
[1:29:17] stayed there the whole time of the
[1:29:19] funeral standing by the door and he was

[1:29:42] church and and of course ours kept
[1:29:45] coming back coming back coming back a
[1:29:47] bad told to God neither glory amen he
[1:29:51] was I said well Louis the grace of God
[1:29:53] brother that I did what I did and not
[1:29:55] only that I said it was sister parents
[1:29:57] that told me I was called to be a pastor
[1:29:58] I said I told her I said no I said I
[1:30:01] don't feel that no yes she said you got

[1:30:05] your life
[1:30:06] okay sister we'll see we'll see so the
[1:30:09] Lord the Lord did it amen so brother
[1:30:13] again as a prisoner of Christ brother is
[1:30:16] not Austin makes the decision its Jesus
[1:30:18] makes the decision amen
[1:30:20] and you and you follow the decision that
[1:30:22] Jesus makes as Paul was a prisoner of
[1:30:25] Jesus so now all the elect of God are
[1:30:27] prisoners of Jesus amen
[1:30:29] all we consider ourselves prisoners of
[1:30:31] this prisoners are that and I'll tell
[1:30:33] you the hardest area like I say there
[1:30:35] are those that those are this this or
[1:30:37] this age they they've been prisoners
[1:30:38] amen prisoners of Santa Claus that's the
[1:30:42] truth
[1:30:43] now they be prisoners of the Easter
[1:30:45] bunnies
[1:30:47] and there are those that are prisoners
[1:30:49] of the church they are in but I tell you
[1:30:51] this there's a few and getting less and
[1:30:54] less and less fewer and fewer of those
[1:30:56] who are prisoners of Jesus that's right
[1:31:00] even even believers I find that there's
[1:31:02] less and less and less prisoners of
[1:31:04] Jesus they're living for themselves oh
[1:31:06] thank you Lord for what you did
[1:31:08] yeah well what am i doing son what am i
[1:31:11] doing daughter Oh Lord well you're just
[1:31:15] revealing what you did know he's
[1:31:18] revealing what he's doing and who a lot
[1:31:20] of believers is just what he did
[1:31:22] oh I'm seeing it more and more now what
[1:31:25] he did no sir
[1:31:26] you got to get beyond that into what
[1:31:28] he's doing amen
[1:31:31] the present tense revelation this is
[1:31:33] what Jesus was encouraging his disciples
[1:31:36] to get in present tense revelation but
[1:31:38] they didn't get it on to the day of
[1:31:39] Pentecost amen and Jesus prayed for them
[1:31:43] by the grace of God amen so let's make
[1:31:47] sure that we are prisoners of the Lord
[1:31:49] Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:51] and as Jesus was prophesying to Peter
[1:31:53] that it was the hours coming when he
[1:31:55] become a prisoner of Jesus amen but on
[1:31:58] but before he became a prisoner of Jesus
[1:32:01] he denied Jesus amen because they're
[1:32:04] three times and they said oh you didn't
[1:32:06] with jeez no he said I don't know what
[1:32:08] don't know no there are those that would
[1:32:12] deny william branham
[1:32:14] that's right walk away from there denied
[1:32:18] those that would and brother and deny
[1:32:20] the revelation of the word that
[1:32:22] revelations word 39 Jesus were they
[1:32:25] doing they're doing they're rejecting
[1:32:26] Jesus amen the grace of God brother
[1:32:30] let's let's be sincere and understand
[1:32:33] what it means to reject Jesus oh well I
[1:32:36] believe Jesus was the Messiah I believe
[1:32:39] Jesus too came and did this and did that
[1:32:40] yes so does the devil but what about
[1:32:43] believing what Jesus yes has come to do
[1:32:47] who believes that Jesus is here
[1:32:50] who believes Jesus has come he should
[1:32:53] descend from heaven with a shout the
[1:32:54] voice of the Archangel the Trump of God
[1:32:56] he descended in the opening of the word
[1:33:00] revealing the mystery and become one
[1:33:02] with the bride the fullness of the
[1:33:05] Godhead bodily is in the bright it's not
[1:33:09] in that body called Jesus no no it's
[1:33:14] like I asked a preacher I said where is
[1:33:16] the body of Jesus I was shocked when I
[1:33:21] got the answer I thought that he would
[1:33:24] know better
[1:33:24] oh he said the body of Jesus always said
[1:33:28] I guess he said he went out to the
[1:33:29] desert and dropped it in the desert
[1:33:31] what dropped it in the desert yeah but
[1:33:37] the problem God said he ascended up in
[1:33:39] that body and he said that bodies at the
[1:33:42] right hand of the through of the throne
[1:33:44] of God and he said the life that was in
[1:33:47] the body the Holy Ghost Christ and now
[1:33:50] he's come back into the bride a man I
[1:33:53] was shocked at that a brother so much
[1:33:55] older than I am and yet back then he
[1:33:58] didn't the revelation of where the body
[1:34:00] of Jesus was amazing thank God for the
[1:34:04] opening of the of the mystery of God any
[1:34:06] man but the Bible tells us he didn't
[1:34:08] drop it in the desert the Bible says
[1:34:10] that in in in in the book of Acts there
[1:34:13] says he ascended up into the integrand
[1:34:14] of cloud him in the Angels and only that
[1:34:18] the the Old Testament Saints that were
[1:34:19] dead in Christ amen that laid down their
[1:34:22] lives they ascended with him and they
[1:34:25] were the ones they were crying out in
[1:34:26] River in the book of Revelation they
[1:34:28] were they cried out open up the gates
[1:34:30] well over the gates let the King of
[1:34:34] glory come in who is the king of glory

[1:34:41] he overcome the world the flesh the
[1:34:43] devil amen open up the city there in the
[1:34:47] book of Rundlett Psalms rather a man so
[1:34:50] brother let's make sure we got the gate
[1:34:51] open Christ in us amen that we are
[1:34:54] prisoners of Jesus Christ amen not of a
[1:34:58] church none of a doctor not a william
[1:34:59] branham we're prisoners of Christ amen
[1:35:02] by the grace of Almighty God
[1:35:04] he made turn with me to Isaiah chapter
[1:35:08] 58
[1:35:11] oh my Isaiah 58 a man you're here
[1:35:30] because you're a prisoner of Jesus not a
[1:35:32] prisoner just of the word of the message
[1:35:35] doctrines you're president of Jesus not
[1:35:37] a prisoner of this church but a prisoner
[1:35:39] of Jesus brother I'll share some
[1:35:43] scripture with you to show you what God
[1:35:46] experiences what God witnesses in those
[1:35:48] that he calls in those that he reveals
[1:35:51] himself to a man oh brother sister I
[1:35:55] trust were elect I trust we're bright
[1:35:58] Alleluia I trust we heard the fullness
[1:36:00] of the Godhead bodily
[1:36:02] just tremendous revelation to have what
[1:36:05] me I'll tell you it'll do one thing
[1:36:07] it'll humble you any man it'll certainly
[1:36:11] humble you to think that God came and
[1:36:14] did this for me and God is doing this in
[1:36:16] me yes Almighty God most think I saved
[1:36:23] so I got no worries now but they're not
[1:36:25] humble oh I'm saved
[1:36:29] yeah wait you say for where you going
[1:36:33] and wanted to save you what's he doing
[1:36:35] now oh brother sisters there got to be a
[1:36:38] personal relationship with Jesus again
[1:36:43] it's not me that lives
[1:36:45] it's Christ that liveth in me well what
[1:36:47] a Paul I believe yeah Paul Paul could
[1:36:50] say he was the prisoner of jesus he
[1:36:52] could say and he was dead to himself he
[1:36:55] was no longer putting the emphasis on it
[1:36:57] on what he wanted and there's not
[1:36:59] natural things you've put more and more
[1:37:01] emphasis on Jesus on God on the word and
[1:37:03] on the bright but most are still putting
[1:37:09] the emphasis on there now every day now
[1:37:10] they love it I tell you they love the
[1:37:14] natural things more than the spiritual
[1:37:15] oh and they love this and they love that
[1:37:17] I want to do this I want to do this and
[1:37:19] so is that what Jesus wants you to do
[1:37:21] now if he wants to do it fine but you
[1:37:24] did you consult the Lord first
[1:37:27] well what's it your natural instinct the
[1:37:30] cause you do this cause you do that
[1:37:33] grace brother you know Isaiah chapter 58
[1:37:39] he said cry aloud that's why you're here
[1:37:43] brother Journal crying loud you know a
[1:37:47] lot would like for me to be quiet
[1:37:49] cry aloud and spare not oh lift up thy
[1:37:54] voice like a trumpet and show my people
[1:37:58] their transgression and the house of
[1:38:01] Jacob their sins
[1:38:03] oh they're called of God they're the
[1:38:05] elect of God yeah but they need to be
[1:38:07] reminded of their troubles and they're
[1:38:09] so there's their sins and so on to
[1:38:11] Humble himself in the presence of God
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:14] yet they seek me daily and delight to
[1:38:19] know my ways as a nation that did
[1:38:22] righteousness and forsook not the
[1:38:25] ordinance of their God they asked him
[1:38:27] the ordinances of justice and take did
[1:38:30] they take delight in approaching to God
[1:38:32] but we have read another scripture to
[1:38:34] show you what they do after when it
[1:38:38] becomes a form of godliness - oh yeah
[1:38:42] wherefore he said have we fasted yea say
[1:38:47] they and thou see us not wherefore have
[1:38:51] we afflicted our soul and thou take us
[1:38:54] no knowledge behold in the day of your
[1:38:58] fast she find pleasure and exact all
[1:39:01] your Labor's and that's why that those
[1:39:03] feathered in a certain place there and
[1:39:06] trying to put the emphasis on this
[1:39:07] brother oh fast and pray fast and pray
[1:39:10] oh they're giving themselves the glory
[1:39:13] not God but I told the brother I said
[1:39:16] brother no I said listen the prophet of
[1:39:20] God said to the sister that came in the
[1:39:22] in the prayer line and she was healed

[1:39:32] said that's not what healed you

[1:40:21] word that he reveals to you it is such
[1:40:24] effects that I have this is it such a
[1:40:27] fast that I have chosen a day for a man
[1:40:29] to afflicted soul is a to bow down his
[1:40:32] head as a bulrush and to spread
[1:40:34] sackcloth and ashes under him he said
[1:40:37] well they call this a fat an acceptable
[1:40:40] day to the Lord is not this the fast
[1:40:43] that I have chosen a man as to it God
[1:40:47] God wants us to do a man he said to
[1:40:52] loose the bands of wickedness to undo

[1:50:21] yeah by the grace of God and he said I'm
[1:50:24] up there looking down on the
[1:50:27] congregation and here in the Book of
[1:50:30] Ezekiel he explains the glory of God
[1:50:34] a man and his Inc your chapter to see us
[1:50:37] all the word brothers sister thank God
[1:50:40] his Eco chapter 2 beginning to read at
[1:50:42] verse 3 and he said unto me son of man I
[1:50:48] send thee to the tournament of Israel to
[1:50:51] a rebellious nation and observe an hour

[1:51:03] and they rebelled against God they and
[1:51:06] their fathers have transgressed against
[1:51:08] me then on to this very day he said for
[1:51:13] they are impudent children and Steph
[1:51:18] arted I do send thee unto them and thou
[1:51:22] shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord
[1:51:24] God and they whether they will hear or
[1:51:28] whether they will forbear for they are a
[1:51:30] rebellious house yet shall know that

[1:51:37] man and thou son a man
[1:51:42] be not afraid of them brother ever ever
[1:51:46] an hour that the ministry needs to take
[1:51:48] on to this revelation we needed don't be

[1:52:08] thorns be with thee thou does dwell
[1:52:10] among scorpions be not afraid of their
[1:52:13] words nor be dismayed at their looks
[1:52:17] though they be a rebellious house and
[1:52:20] he's talking about Israel yeah and he
[1:52:24] said thou shall speak my words unto them
[1:52:27] whether they will hear whether they will
[1:52:29] forbear for they are most rebellious but
[1:52:33] not but thou son a man hear what I say
[1:52:36] unto thee be not thou rebellious like
[1:52:38] that rebellious house he said open
[1:52:45] they move and eat that I give thee a man
[1:52:50] eat the word that you're hearing today
[1:52:53] eat the word a man and when I looked
[1:52:57] behold and hand was sent unto me and lo
[1:53:01] a roll of a book was therein and he
[1:53:04] spread it before me and it was written
[1:53:06] within and without and he said there was
[1:53:10] written therein he said lamentations
[1:53:13] morning and wool and brother the Prophet
[1:53:18] preached lamentations morning in wool to
[1:53:21] get us out of the churches and into the
[1:53:27] bright God is getting preaching
[1:53:30] lamentations the morning in wool to get
[1:53:33] us out of time and into eternity a man
[1:53:35] and there's one more scripture Psalms
[1:53:38] 106 it's been a long time since I have
[1:53:44] read this one I shared it with the beat
[1:53:48] Saints Amen still never got to the
[1:53:52] message on Paul a prisoner will see and
[1:53:59] the brethren can the brothers kind of
[1:54:01] keep me informed two cuts only to
[1:54:03] weather ok thank you amen Psalms 106 and
[1:54:09] beginning to read at verse 1 pay
[1:54:12] attention to the word a man praise ye
[1:54:17] the Lord all give thanks unto the Lord
[1:54:20] for he is good for his mercy endureth
[1:54:24] forever a man who can utterly utter the
[1:54:30] mighty acts of the Lord who can show
[1:54:32] forth all his praise
[1:54:33] he said blessed are they that keep
[1:54:35] judgment and he that doeth righteousness
[1:54:37] at all times
[1:54:40] God help us remember me O Lord with the
[1:54:45] favor that thou bear'st unto thy people
[1:54:47] or visit me with thy salvation that I
[1:54:50] may see the good of thy chosen that I
[1:54:53] may rejoice in the gladness of thy
[1:54:55] nation that I may glory with Dyne
[1:54:58] inheritance
[1:54:59] have sinned with our fathers we have
[1:55:02] committed iniquity we have done wickedly
[1:55:04] and our fathers understood not they
[1:55:08] wonders in Egypt a man how many have
[1:55:13] understood the wonders of Malachi 4
[1:55:17] again it's a challenge even to
[1:55:21] denominational brethren out there and
[1:55:25] even nondenominational brethren yeah as
[1:55:28] I said they had that internet site and
[1:55:29] they said this was william brown
[1:55:31] ministry when it comes to the signs and
[1:55:33] wonders and how in the world can we can
[1:55:35] we reconcile it to his message they
[1:55:40] didn't understand it how could a man
[1:55:42] with this kind of a ministry preach this
[1:55:44] message you know as like again that
[1:55:47] evangelist and he approached whether
[1:55:51] Romney said brother Ram stop preaching
[1:55:53] that yeah that was all Roberts he said
[1:55:59] brother Ram stop preaching that just
[1:56:01] just just preach this you know his signs
[1:56:03] and his wonders and so on and healing
[1:56:04] and all that but don't go preaching
[1:56:06] about the what the women should do
[1:56:07] shouldn't do whatever what the brothers
[1:56:08] should do and shouldn't do and the
[1:56:10] prophet of God said well he's her
[1:56:11] brother he said oh yeah I said the
[1:56:14] brothers who lit the pastor's to it and
[1:56:16] he said well if the pastors are not
[1:56:17] doing he said who was going to do it he
[1:56:20] said I got to do it oh yeah because
[1:56:24] again he was ordained with those signs
[1:56:25] and wonders to get the people to believe
[1:56:27] believe what believe the word what God
[1:56:30] was going to reveal a man sir brother
[1:56:33] they understood not the wonders in Egypt
[1:56:35] they understood not what God was doing
[1:56:38] and what what was God doing those things
[1:56:40] back therefore in the Ministry of
[1:56:42] winning around the 1st and 2nd pole it
[1:56:44] was to get bring the bride out of
[1:56:46] denominational Egyptian bondage provide'
[1:56:51] God said yeah he said we've been brought
[1:56:54] out of denominational each bondage
[1:56:56] Israel's brought out of the politically
[1:57:00] Egyptian bondage were brought out of
[1:57:02] spiritual Egyptian bondage a man by what
[1:57:05] God has done in this hour in this age
[1:57:07] but there's a generation that didn't
[1:57:09] understand and the father got even even
[1:57:12] to concerning the
[1:57:13] the generation that was believing his
[1:57:15] message back then and he said he said to
[1:57:18] one brothers brotherly veil now he said
[1:57:20] brother veil he said most of the older
[1:57:23] generation around this message they're
[1:57:24] going to go before the rapture he said
[1:57:27] they're going to go on because they
[1:57:28] won't live to have that rapture in faith
[1:57:30] a man why they weren't ordained they
[1:57:33] weren't predestinated onto the rapture
[1:57:35] so God was going to take them off the
[1:57:37] scene but they're there now in that
[1:57:39] dimension waiting on us but he's going
[1:57:41] to be a generation raised on the scene
[1:57:43] that will have wrapped repaid and again
[1:57:47] he said listen he said you young
[1:57:49] ministers are gonna take this message on
[1:57:52] to the coming of the Lord and we're
[1:57:55] trying to preach the coming of the Lord
[1:57:57] that he has come amen
[1:57:59] as the Provost said it's not me it's
[1:58:02] that other angel it's Christ hey man you
[1:58:06] remember and the Bible says he went up
[1:58:08] in a cloud and the Bible says that the
[1:58:11] angel said he's going to come back in a
[1:58:13] cloud you'll come as you have seen him
[1:58:15] go well there's a cloud of angels and he
[1:58:19] came in a cloud of angels and again as I
[1:58:22] said come near nearing the end of his
[1:58:25] ministry the parlor God preached and he
[1:58:27] says see he said there he is he said
[1:58:30] he's looking down on us amen
[1:58:34] and he is as I said brother it's a
[1:58:38] witness to the world know Jesus now but
[1:58:40] back back back in 1963 in 64
[1:58:43] brother these things were printed in in
[1:58:45] in worldwide magazines the picture this
[1:58:49] picture and that one yeah and as I said
[1:58:52] if you if you ever got the magazine and
[1:58:55] you saw behind this one what's behind it
[1:58:57] it is a rainbow at midnight in Mexico
[1:59:00] midnight a rainbow yeah and they
[1:59:04] published that picture and then next
[1:59:06] beyond it on the other side they
[1:59:08] published this picture and they said all
[1:59:11] it's a mystery they said it's not a ray
[1:59:13] it's not a plane it's not a jet because
[1:59:16] it's too high
[1:59:17] did they express how high it was and so
[1:59:20] on and so on how big it was well thank
[1:59:22] God that we got the revelation amen
[1:59:26] that we God have us that will by
[1:59:29] reverence respected what there he is
[1:59:34] looking down at us as I said most people
[1:59:37] just see this what's it gonna be like
[1:59:47] when we see him really got the
[1:59:50] revelation of Jesus the Prophet God's
[1:59:52] that I want introduce the bride to Jesus
[1:59:54] and he said then he said I want to get
[1:59:56] on my knees and crawl up to his feet
[2:00:00] what do we want to do because we
[2:00:06] considered that he saved us and he's now
[2:00:10] working in us to a mayor to work out the
[2:00:12] old nature to work in the new praise the
[2:00:16] Lord says verse 7 our fathers understood
[2:00:21] not they wonders in Egypt this
[2:00:24] generation didn't understand what God
[2:00:26] was really doing in the first and second
[2:00:28] pull of the province ministry not
[2:00:30] understanding what he was really doing
[2:00:31] in the opening of the seven seals the
[2:00:34] mystery of God what for
[2:00:36] oh yeah the mystery of God's revealed
[2:00:38] down but what was heard is it or is it
[2:00:40] complem what he wanted to accomplish and
[2:00:42] that is to give us rapturing hey grace
[2:00:47] he said they remembered not the
[2:00:51] multitude of thy mercies
[2:00:53] but provoked him at the rate at the sea
[2:00:56] even at the Red Sea don't provoke him
[2:01:00] don't provoke God with our on with
[2:01:06] unbelief let's believe God this please
[2:01:10] God and he said nevertheless he saved
[2:01:13] them for his name's sake our Lord Jesus
[2:01:18] Christ he said that he might make his
[2:01:22] mighty mighty power to be known he
[2:01:25] rebuked the Red Sea also and it was
[2:01:27] dried up so he led them through the
[2:01:30] depths as through the wilderness you
[2:01:33] think they would believe God to glean
[2:01:34] and possess the promised land concerning
[2:01:38] what he did in Egypt
[2:01:39] considering what he did at the Red Sea
[2:01:41] considering the pen of that fell down
[2:01:43] and he fed them their signs and the
[2:01:47] wonders and the miracles no they still
[2:01:53] didn't believe and he said he led them
[2:01:57] through the dead says through the
[2:01:58] wilderness and he saved them from the
[2:02:00] hand the hand of him that hated them and
[2:02:03] redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
[2:02:06] but they turned down his Redemption
[2:02:09] please let's not refuse his Redemption
[2:02:12] let's not refuse the revelation of the
[2:02:15] Resurrection and the rapture brother as
[2:02:17] the Lutheran's put emphasis on
[2:02:19] justification justification by faith
[2:02:21] justification and sanctification and the
[2:02:24] baptism of the holy ghost from Pentecost
[2:02:26] and the gifts oh my I was a part of that
[2:02:28] oh yeah I was in the in Pentecost over
[2:02:34] fifty years ago
[2:02:35] it's quite different now but this the
[2:02:39] emphasis was on the baptism the baptism
[2:02:41] yeah any went out after the service and
[2:02:43] they all went up around the altar and
[2:02:44] they were down on their knees praying
[2:02:45] and I was one of them one time and and I
[2:02:48] remember brethren coming over and over
[2:02:50] to this one over though that one over
[2:02:52] this one that went over to me and laying
[2:02:53] hands on me Lord filled with the Holy
[2:02:55] Ghost that's what they were praying Lord
[2:02:57] filled my brother with the Holy Ghost in
[2:02:59] the name of Jesus Christ and so on but
[2:03:02] they were looking for a sign of the
[2:03:03] speaking in tongues yeah I remember when
[2:03:07] God filming with the Holy horse but it
[2:03:10] wasn't then yeah it was we got filled
[2:03:14] with the Holy Ghost it was I was in the
[2:03:17] bedroom in the house praying and
[2:03:21] anointing struck me and I got up I stood

[2:04:13] our way home don't put the emphasis on
[2:04:15] the foolishness of this world by dams on
[2:04:17] the spiritual all right that's the ones
[2:04:19] that are going in the rapture that's the
[2:04:21] ones they're gonna be taken out of here

[2:04:25] the Lord but love the Lord the
[2:04:26] resurrection the rapture and brother

[2:04:29] saints that are gone on how many of us
[2:04:34] are hungry on thirsty persister coffee I
[2:04:36] made so hungry and thirsty for
[2:04:38] fellowship with sister Dunford brother
[2:04:41] sister burns yeah and other saints
[2:04:43] probably God said he even said that in
[2:04:46] the natural he said in the natural he
[2:04:48] said when you begin to when you're
[2:04:50] thinking about those that are gone on
[2:04:51] he said your Lord is gonna take you soon
[2:04:54] well if in this hour and the
[2:04:57] resurrection of rapture age if we're
[2:04:59] thinking about those that have gone on
[2:05:00] and we're hungry and thirsty for
[2:05:02] fellowship with them again oh we've
[2:05:03] missed it nor we miss it
[2:05:04] oh think it's gonna it's gonna bring the
[2:05:07] resurrection you're gonna bring the
[2:05:09] rapture you got to be you got to want it
[2:05:13] not just and this is what Jesus wanted
[2:05:15] Martha they do have that anointing in
[2:05:17] her life that she would want the
[2:05:19] resurrection she would want the rapture
[2:05:22] by the grace of God there's be sensitive
[2:05:28] to it in verse 9 he said he rebuked the
[2:05:33] Red Sea also and it was dried up so he
[2:05:36] led them through the depths as for the
[2:05:39] wilderness and he saved them from the
[2:05:42] hand of him that aided them and redeemed
[2:05:44] them from the hand of the enemy and the
[2:05:47] waters covered their enemies and there
[2:05:49] was not one of them left then verse 12
[2:05:54] notice verse 12 then believe they is
[2:05:57] words they saying
[2:05:59] is praise miss tremendous but the next
[2:06:04] verse is tremendous they believe those
[2:06:07] words as saying his praise verse 13 they
[2:06:11] soon forgot is yeah they waited not for
[2:06:19] his counsel now it's a generation that
[2:06:23] believed and paying praises to the Lord
[2:06:26] for what he's done in this hour but it
[2:06:28] got to the place where they have
[2:06:29] forgotten his works amen and they waitin
[2:06:34] up for his counsel I know because I have
[2:06:37] meet meet believers meet believers meet
[2:06:38] believers I said lord I say things are
[2:06:41] going in the rapture oh I believe the
[2:06:42] message but I said they said they
[2:06:44] believe the message intellectually and
[2:06:46] in their heads but I said they're going
[2:06:48] off and they're like their lives are not
[2:06:49] reflecting it I said they're not
[2:06:52] prisoners of Jesus then our prisoners of
[2:06:54] the world if you're a prisoner of the
[2:06:57] word you're controlled by the word your
[2:07:00] prisoner of Jesus are controlled by
[2:07:01] Jesus amen
[2:07:04] again I said the poverties bringing out
[2:07:06] in this message Paul a prisoner he said
[2:07:08] Paul recognize himself not as just a
[2:07:10] prisoner of of the government or the
[2:07:12] prisoner of Rome and whatever was no
[2:07:14] he's a prisoner of Jesus yeah and he
[2:07:18] said he had he had a friend there's also
[2:07:19] a fellow prisoner not just in in in the
[2:07:23] in a jail but in the word a man
[2:07:26] controlled by the word so the prophet of
[2:07:30] God is and may praise the Lord as I told
[2:07:33] you the last time right sermon I
[2:07:34] preached I said I was shocked had the
[2:07:37] number of times that william branham
[2:07:38] mentioned about a prisoner of christ
[2:07:40] after he preached that message in these
[2:07:43] two messages right here and when we
[2:07:45] would get to it and it says christ the
[2:07:46] mystery of god revealed and perfect
[2:07:49] faith and again perfect faith and in
[2:07:53] price christ a mystery of god revealed
[2:07:54] it is among the fewer messages that he
[2:07:58] was preaching after the seals and the
[2:08:01] revelations that he wanted us to get
[2:08:04] after the opening the seals because
[2:08:05] remember after 1963 he went back into
[2:08:08] evangelism amen
[2:08:11] so brother though was going in the
[2:08:15] rapture will be prisoners of the
[2:08:18] revelation absolutely controlled and
[2:08:21] governed by the revelation listen in
[2:08:24] verse 13 they soon forget is works they
[2:08:28] waited not for his counsel and brother
[2:08:30] there's a generation of believers now
[2:08:32] they have forgotten the works of God and
[2:08:33] they're not waiting for God's counsel oh
[2:08:35] I just believe this doctrine this
[2:08:37] doctrine that doctrine yeah I believe
[2:08:39] the message I said Lord I said they're
[2:08:41] not believers that's not reflecting the
[2:08:44] message they're not reflecting Christ
[2:08:48] ice to reflect in religion reflecting
[2:08:51] theology intellectually but spiritually
[2:08:54] on every day s not in their everyday
[2:08:56] lives
[2:08:56] oh just because the woman you know she
[2:09:00] got along really day she got to getting
[2:09:01] good clothes every day yeah or the
[2:09:02] prophet of God said it can be dead works
[2:09:05] it was not faith he said it's a dead
[2:09:07] work you go get baptized in the name of
[2:09:10] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's not faith
[2:09:12] it's dead work God yes god help us we're
[2:09:17] going by faith not by sight not by the
[2:09:19] intellectual word but by the spiritual
[2:09:21] revelation in our hearts amen
[2:09:24] that the word control you and that your
[2:09:28] life reflect
[2:09:29] Christ and it says they soon forgot his
[2:09:33] works and they waited not for his
[2:09:35] counsel please wait on the Lord for his
[2:09:38] counsel through the Ministry of the word
[2:09:40] oh well I don't have to do that I don't
[2:09:45] have to do no you don't have to us your
[2:09:47] choice but if you're born again you will
[2:09:50] a man and he said but lust they lusted
[2:09:55] exceedingly in the wilderness as a
[2:09:58] generation is lusting after the world
[2:10:00] and the things of the world or they love
[2:10:01] this world I don't I hate it I want to
[2:10:07] get ahead here as Jesus did I want to
[2:10:11] get out of here
[2:10:12] why because Jesus was this nature Jesus
[2:10:15] was saying yeah yeah that that anointing
[2:10:18] and so on it on why and you you you know
[2:10:21] he had this thought and these thoughts
[2:10:23] and he
[2:10:24] he thirsted for righteousness yeah he
[2:10:27] said remember he was in heaven he said
[2:10:31] no man has ascended up he that came down
[2:10:33] he said even the son of man who is in
[2:10:36] heaven
[2:10:37] Harry was there but he was also in
[2:10:40] heaven why because he came through his
[2:10:43] siapa knee in flesh we bypass but we're
[2:10:47] going back to it
[2:10:48] North theophanies was pulling on us for
[2:10:51] the resurrection the rapture and getting
[2:10:54] us to a glorified body amen
[2:10:57] so finally Jesus got to that place the
[2:10:59] third pole finished I finished oh yeah
[2:11:05] they would they were wondering about
[2:11:06] Jesus worrying about his ministry
[2:11:08] wondering about his attitude Idzik
[2:11:09] what's what's going on he was getting at
[2:11:12] a time and he was more conscious of
[2:11:14] eternity he was going home and he said
[2:11:19] but that generation of the Jews back
[2:11:22] there said lusted exceedingly in the
[2:11:24] wilderness and tempted God in the desert
[2:11:26] he got to the place where they said Oh a
[2:11:28] bit better if we let we were still in
[2:11:29] Egypt what if you're prisoners of God
[2:11:33] prisoners of the word your thank ghost
[2:11:35] be thankful what you're where you're
[2:11:37] experiencing God is look at what God did
[2:11:40] in Egypt look what he didn't bring in
[2:11:42] you out of Egypt look what he did in in
[2:11:44] in the wilderness providing you a man
[2:11:45] and providing you with this providing
[2:11:47] you with that even even you wanted water
[2:11:49] and rock and host Moses struck the rock
[2:11:51] and he they made him mad because of
[2:11:53] because he was a because of their
[2:11:56] unbelief and the finally God says speak
[2:11:59] to the rock but Moses struck it why
[2:12:01] because of the people there on belief
[2:12:06] amen
[2:12:07] they lusted exceedingly in the
[2:12:10] wilderness tempted God in the desert and
[2:12:11] he gave them their requests but sent
[2:12:16] leanness into their soul as a generation
[2:12:20] amen
[2:12:21] they got this they got that ecology with
[2:12:23] its kind of bless you with that but what
[2:12:25] about your soul it's better not better
[2:12:28] not to have that and to be blessed in
[2:12:31] your soul amen
[2:12:35] by the grace of Almighty God God Elpis
[2:12:39] the confirmation that we are prisoners
[2:12:42] of Jesus I'll add the finish why I just
[2:12:48] started how for starters the preaching
[2:12:53] of only preach one amazing well thank
[2:12:59] God listen he said I'll repeat these
[2:13:07] quotes cuz them in a while and maybe
[2:13:09] forget them he said always he said don't
[2:13:15] judge her life by how much power you
[2:13:18] have to perform miracles he said we
[2:13:20] don't judge ourselves by how much
[2:13:22] knowledge you have of the word but
[2:13:25] always judge herself he said look back
[2:13:27] and take an inventory of what kind of a
[2:13:29] fruit that the life you presently live
[2:13:32] is now buried exactly that's right so
[2:13:37] what's the fruits are bearing is it
[2:13:40] fresh fruit amen you're supposed to have
[2:13:44] fresh fruit
[2:13:45] amen and I say that we too often like a
[2:13:53] mirror reflecting something he said our
[2:13:56] life is reflected and now if we lived in
[2:13:59] the days of Noah whose side would we
[2:14:01] take what side would we have to taken in
[2:14:05] those days that Noah lived what side
[2:14:08] were we have taken in the days of Moses
[2:14:11] was sight in the days of Elijah the
[2:14:14] prophet when all the world was gulped up
[2:14:17] in great mass of modernism yeah it said
[2:14:23] they envied Moses and Aaron the saint of
[2:14:28] the Lord amen
[2:14:29] but they still they envied them why
[2:14:32] because of the faith that that they had
[2:14:35] you know and Joshua and Caleb and so on
[2:14:37] oh my what faith didn't matter to them
[2:14:41] you know concerning what was going into
[2:14:44] the Promised Land what they had priced
[2:14:45] they had to pay the sacrifice the
[2:14:47] well if God be for us who can be against
[2:14:49] us but the rest of the Jews forgot what
[2:14:53] God had done amen brother
[2:14:56] there's a lot of lot of believers have
[2:14:58] forgotten and God is past tense not
[2:15:02] present tense God did this but they
[2:15:06] don't have the revelation of what God is
[2:15:08] doing oh yeah
[2:15:11] and you and I said you can be all right
[2:15:14] strict when it comes to I'm a believer
[2:15:16] and I dress like this and I don't do
[2:15:18] this and I don't do that yeah but and
[2:15:21] again the sisters dress this way and
[2:15:23] that way yeah but but is the
[2:15:26] resurrection living in you it's the
[2:15:29] rapture in you is you're hungry and
[2:15:31] thirsting for more and more and more and
[2:15:33] more of for eternity god help us you
[2:15:39] know I I'm that's that's very
[2:15:41] discouraging to see so many believers
[2:15:45] yeah but they're only intellectual
[2:15:48] believers oh yeah they want and they
[2:15:51] they're not there to deny this or deny
[2:15:52] that or do you know the this doctor that
[2:15:54] died home yeah we don't go along with
[2:15:56] denominations and all that well God is
[2:15:59] still out there
[2:16:01] God still working on some of those out
[2:16:03] there in denominations oh yeah
[2:16:05] there's foolish virgins and so on
[2:16:09] there's wise virgins oh yes
[2:16:12] and some that some of those in there out
[2:16:15] there in denomination they rise in
[2:16:16] judgment against those that not in
[2:16:18] denomination they will yeah
[2:16:21] god help us so what what side would you
[2:16:26] take in the days of Moses did you char
[2:16:30] Israel coming out of Egypt they never
[2:16:31] stayed with Moses no God judge them in
[2:16:34] the wilderness brother what to what side
[2:16:37] would you take in the days of Elijah or
[2:16:39] Elijah brother like Elijah was reserved
[2:16:44] was a raptured yeah and even even the
[2:16:48] the other priesthood in Israel they came
[2:16:52] down to the sea when Elijah walked
[2:16:54] across where's Elijah oh he went over
[2:16:59] there
[2:17:00] they went over there looking for him
[2:17:02] couldn't find him couldn't find no
[2:17:04] graves no nothing you rapture me you
[2:17:08] mean he was caught up into theophanies
[2:17:10] of fire Chariots of Fire theophanies of
[2:17:14] fire by the grace of God and brother
[2:17:17] they're there waiting for us to be cut
[2:17:21] off amen
[2:17:24] he's been now in the days of the Lord
[2:17:26] Jesus what side would you have taken
[2:17:30] your life that you live now reflects
[2:17:33] just what you would have done then
[2:17:35] because you still are possessed with the
[2:17:38] same spirit so what what's why would you
[2:17:41] take when if Jesus when Jesus was there
[2:17:43] physically on earth and he's here now in
[2:17:46] the bright sea the devil never takes his
[2:17:52] spirit he just goes off from one man to
[2:17:55] another God never takes his spirit
[2:17:57] either it goes from one to another so
[2:17:59] the very spirit that was um Elijah came
[2:18:02] on Elijah and the one on John the
[2:18:04] Baptist and so forth the Holy Spirit was
[2:18:07] upon Christ came upon the disciples so
[2:18:11] God never takes his spirit so he said
[2:18:14] there we are left to make a choice I
[2:18:16] can't see where here where Paul was
[2:18:18] regretting anything and saying he was
[2:18:21] sorry he was a prisoner but he was
[2:18:24] addressing himself I believe that Paul
[2:18:27] as he wrote this letter with the pen
[2:18:29] that it was the Holy Spirit causing him
[2:18:32] to write it that they maybe even to this
[2:18:35] night that we might call out the context
[2:18:38] of our texts to show why Paul did this
[2:18:41] and I believe that sitting in this dingy
[2:18:44] old jail Paul calling here that his
[2:18:47] brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus
[2:18:50] Christ he could express it by seeing
[2:18:53] what was around him now he was in jail
[2:18:56] but that wasn't what Paul was speaking
[2:18:59] to his servant of Christ he said he was
[2:19:03] speaking that he was a prisoner to the
[2:19:05] word of Jesus Christ because Christ is
[2:19:08] the word amen
[2:19:11] god help us
[2:19:13] we become prisoners to the word
[2:19:15] prisoners to Jesus finally he said Oh
[2:19:23] God make us prisoners from our own
[2:19:27] selfish ambitions from our own judgment
[2:19:31] amen amen
[2:19:34] praise the Lord make us prisoners from
[2:19:38] our own selfish ambitions from our own
[2:19:41] judgements and our own what we think
[2:19:45] better way of thinking he said to be a
[2:19:49] prisoner of Jesus Christ amen
[2:19:53] I think he said that was a great
[2:19:55] statement that I'm a prisoner to Jesus
[2:19:58] Christ amen
[2:20:00] and brother Brennan makes it
[2:20:04] personal with Brenham tabernacle that
[2:20:06] they need to become prisoners of Christ
[2:20:08] god help us this best stop there so
[2:20:13] brother sister don't reject Jesus by not
[2:20:18] allowing him to become the control of
[2:20:21] your life and refusing to become his
[2:20:24] prisoner
[2:20:25] amen God's grace to us is prayer you'll
[2:20:29] get to it again more concerning the
[2:20:32] quotes in that message and the other
[2:20:33] messages so the Lord bless you amen
