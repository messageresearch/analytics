[34:54] preeminence again Lord we ask these
[34:56] things in Jesus Christ's name name amen
[34:59] amen God bless you this morning turn if
[35:01] you would again to Colossians chap 1
[35:04] verse 9 Colossians 1 and9 certainly want
[35:07] to show my appreciation and thanks to
[35:10] the church officers this morning as you
[35:11] know we're having our annual election
[35:14] and each one of them has served very
[35:16] faithfully and certainly as a pastor it
[35:18] is a huge huge help if you really don't
[35:22] have to think about a lot of things and
[35:23] so from our Sunday school superintendent
[35:25] brother Paul and he manages that so well
[35:28] and the young people to our trustees
[35:30] brother vichel brother Bob and they just
[35:32] they take care of everything I don't
[35:34] have to talk about it I don't even have
[35:35] to ask about it the few times ask
[35:37] questions usually it's we've already
[35:38] taken care of it or we've got a plan and
[35:40] they've just done a wonderful job and
[35:42] then of course the deacons brother Matt
[35:44] Brother Joseph certainly appreciate them
[35:46] and the hard work they do and the
[35:48] awkward things they willingly take on as
[35:50] part of their services and then brother
[35:52] Mark of course is the treasurer managing
[35:54] the finances you'll see as he gives his
[35:56] report at the end of the service us
[35:57] we're in good hands then we're not in
[35:59] brother Mark's
[36:00] hands but he's managing for us amen so
[36:03] we're so thankful for each one and I
[36:05] appreciate it I know it's a it's a
[36:07] burden of a certain sort and it takes
[36:09] time away from your families and your
[36:10] spouses and so your families bear that
[36:12] burden as well but I just want to thank
[36:14] each one of you from the bottom of my
[36:15] heart for your faithful service and then
[36:17] of course we have those that are serving
[36:19] without being voted in and they serve at
[36:22] the at the desires of their hearts from
[36:24] our musicians Our Song leaders the
[36:26] audiovisual people a janitor and all
[36:29] these different things I sure appreciate
[36:30] each one of you so God bless you this
[36:32] morning we're a body amen we're a body
[36:34] and we need each everyone to be in their
[36:36] place and I believe the Lord has done
[36:38] that in our midst amen Colossians 1 and
[36:40] ver9 same scripture we opened with last
[36:43] service Paul says for this cause we also
[36:45] since the day we heard it do not cease
[36:48] to pray for you and to desire that you
[36:50] might be filled with the knowledge of
[36:52] his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[36:55] understanding that ye might walk worthy
[36:57] of the the Lord unto all pleasing notice
[36:59] the standards him not us anden it's
[37:02] worthy in his eyes not in ours being
[37:04] fruitful in every good work and
[37:08] increasing in the knowledge of God
[37:10] strengthened with all might according to
[37:12] his glorious power unto all patience and
[37:16] longsuffering with joyfulness and the
[37:18] church said amen God bless you you can
[37:21] have your seats this morning we are
[37:22] continuing our thought on the the token
[37:24] life the the Holy Spirit and we're again
[37:27] continuing on this idea or this question
[37:29] of how do I know I have received the
[37:31] Holy Spirit and we've been talking a lot
[37:32] about fruit and we haven't quite come to
[37:34] the fruit of the Holy Spirit we'll do
[37:36] that today by God's grace but we've
[37:38] talked last service about what it takes
[37:40] to produce fruit just Naturally Speaking
[37:42] we built that Foundation through the
[37:44] last couple of services how that we're
[37:46] supposed to produce the fruit of the
[37:48] spirit and Paul talked about what keeps
[37:49] us from producing the fruit of the
[37:51] spirit then we went through what Jesus
[37:52] said there is a group that's supposed to
[37:54] produce the fruit of the spirit it's the
[37:56] children of God and they're the good
[37:57] ground and they're supposed to produce
[37:59] something all the way to harvest amen
[38:01] and so we talked last service especially
[38:03] about that tree that's planted by rivers
[38:05] of water and we know that for a tree to
[38:07] produce fruit it needs a lot of water it
[38:09] needs a lot of water if it wants to
[38:11] produce fruit it can't just sprink
[38:13] enough fruit to survive that's not what
[38:15] it's about if you're going to produce
[38:16] fruit remember you got to drink more
[38:18] than what you need you got to drink more
[38:20] than what's allotted to you because
[38:21] you've got to push you got to grow and
[38:23] you got to drive your branches out and
[38:24] produce the leaves and the blossoms and
[38:26] the fruit amen and so we can't just get
[38:28] enough of the word of God to keep us
[38:30] going amen as Believers we're not just
[38:33] supposed to slide into heaven saying
[38:35] well I'm alive I made it no we're
[38:36] supposed to produce fruit that's the
[38:38] requirement of the believer is that we
[38:40] produce fruit because it's not for us
[38:42] it's for others as we'll see as we go
[38:43] through here today but that's a big
[38:45] distinction between just showing up
[38:47] alive and maturing and growing am me
[38:50] you're a child of God and remember we
[38:51] spoke a couple Services ago how every
[38:54] one of us has a foundation that
[38:56] Foundation is Christ but what we build
[38:58] on that he leaves up to us as in we can
[39:01] choose to build what he wants us to or
[39:03] we can build what we want to and in the
[39:05] end what we build is Judge so you can
[39:07] come to the end of this and you'll be
[39:08] saved and have nothing to show for it or
[39:11] you can do it his way and you can come
[39:12] through and you have something to show
[39:14] for it and I believe for a child of God
[39:16] we want to get to the other side and say
[39:17] I've got something to show for my life
[39:19] beyond just saving my own soul if we
[39:22] could look at it that way amen but we
[39:24] want to come to the end and say I became
[39:25] what he wanted me to be I did what he
[39:27] asked me to do brother brownan would say
[39:29] this he says now that's what's the
[39:30] matter with the Christians they don't
[39:33] drink enough you want to drink till you
[39:36] just spread out and let somebody else
[39:39] see it he says see push out get a
[39:43] testimony committed to God now catch the
[39:45] distinction here we talk about eating
[39:48] the the the the the word about drinking
[39:50] The Living Waters amen and he's saying
[39:53] it doesn't mean just read it see I can
[39:56] talk to you about having your devotions
[39:58] in the morning and your prayer time and
[39:59] spending time with God and that's the
[40:02] start of it but it has to become a part
[40:04] of you you have to apply it amen if all
[40:08] we do is we get it in our head we become
[40:10] religious but if we can take it and make
[40:12] it a part of us he says push it out get
[40:15] a testimony have a a testimony that
[40:18] tells other people what I eat Works what
[40:21] I'm taking in is coming out in the thing
[40:23] that I expected it to come out in that's
[40:25] how you want to be able to show it
[40:27] spread it out and let somebody else see
[40:29] it he says believe it step out on it
[40:33] claim God's promise just commit it to
[40:35] God believe it and then he quotes the
[40:37] scripture commit thy ways unto the Lord
[40:39] and He will bring it to pass whatever
[40:41] you want so we don't want to just talk
[40:44] about having devotions we don't just
[40:46] want to talk about reading your Bible
[40:47] and these different things but we want
[40:49] to say let's make it a part of us a tree
[40:51] when it drinks it it's making the water
[40:53] part of itself it's not just letting the
[40:55] rain fall on it but it's absor being
[40:57] what it is so that it can do some good
[40:59] amen but I want to do a quick recap this
[41:01] morning and it will be quick from where
[41:04] we started last service because I picked
[41:06] up on a thought and really I didn't stay
[41:08] with it all the way through because I
[41:09] had other things that I I felt to go
[41:11] through but I want to take it from
[41:13] Genesis again for those that weren't
[41:15] here and even for those that were CU I
[41:17] really want to build on that thought of
[41:19] of being fruitful and we open with this
[41:21] scripture last time and it says God
[41:23] created man in his own image in the
[41:25] image of God created he him male and
[41:27] female created he them and God blessed
[41:30] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[41:33] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[41:36] subdue it and have dominion over the
[41:39] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[41:41] air and over every living thing that
[41:43] moves upon the Earth so we see that the
[41:45] first commandment of God to mankind to
[41:48] Adam is be
[41:50] fruitful and we're talking about the
[41:52] fruit of the Holy Spirit here but if we
[41:53] go to the very beginning it was to
[41:55] produce fruit and that fruit was the
[41:57] fruit of the body if we could put it
[41:59] that way it was to produce children and
[42:01] not just children not sons of men but
[42:04] sons of God Adam was a Son of God Eve
[42:06] was a daughter of God and the purpose
[42:08] for them was to produce more sons of God
[42:11] that was supposed to be the fruit of
[42:13] Adam's life amen they were to produce
[42:15] children of God by the will into the
[42:18] perfect of image of God that's what they
[42:20] were supposed to do now let's catch
[42:22] something here because the fruitfulness
[42:24] that God is talking about here could not
[42:26] be the fruit of their own
[42:28] body it couldn't be the fruit of their
[42:31] own body the method of producing
[42:32] children in creation was not physical
[42:34] intimacy the way it was today we know
[42:37] that because we know how Jesus was born
[42:40] Jesus was born
[42:42] what by the
[42:44] word he was born through a woman but he
[42:48] was born by the Holy Spirit that's how
[42:52] he came into being amen and so he was
[42:54] the result of the spoken word of God in
[42:56] the timing of God and he Mary was then
[42:59] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and the
[43:02] Holy Spirit put inside her the word and
[43:06] then out of her body came the word and
[43:08] it was Christ the word made manifest
[43:11] amen he was born the original way he was
[43:13] born the correct way that God intended
[43:15] he was born in the timing of God by the
[43:18] word of God by the will of God and so
[43:20] when he's born he is the word because
[43:22] that's what he started as Adam and his
[43:24] wife were supposed to produce that way
[43:27] they weren't supposed to have physical
[43:28] intimacy and we've we've preached on
[43:30] this before so I won't go into it again
[43:32] amen but to be fruitful as the original
[43:35] commandment was given Adam had to stay
[43:38] close to the tree of life because the
[43:40] Tree of Life which was Christ amen would
[43:44] tell him when to go tell him when to do
[43:48] it tell him when was the time when was
[43:50] the season and then in being in the
[43:52] presence of the Tree of Life Christ the
[43:54] word then the spirit would have come on
[43:56] the woman and she would have produced
[43:58] the word again she would have produced a
[44:00] son or a daughter of God so it would be
[44:02] by God's will not Adam's will by God's
[44:05] desire not by Adam's desire and out of
[44:07] Eve then would have come the spoken word
[44:10] again so unless they could stay by the
[44:12] tree of life they could not be fruitful
[44:15] if they got away from Christ they could
[44:17] not be fruitful in the way that he
[44:18] intended keep that in your mind as we go
[44:20] through you've got to be connected to
[44:22] Christ in order to be fruitful in the
[44:24] way that he requires it says in God said
[44:27] behold I've given you every herb bearing
[44:29] seed which is upon the face of all the
[44:31] Earth and every tree in the which is the
[44:33] tree yielding in which is the fruit of a
[44:36] tree yielding seed to you it shall be
[44:38] for meat and to every beast of the earth
[44:40] and to every fowl of the air and
[44:42] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[44:44] wherein there's life I've given every
[44:46] green herb for meat and it was so so the
[44:49] plants and the trees and the fruit and
[44:51] the the vegetables and all these things
[44:53] in the garden were meat they were food
[44:55] for the natural bodies and it was a
[44:57] tended to sustain this Natural Body it
[44:59] had nothing to do with eternal life I
[45:02] want you to see that the fruit of the
[45:04] trees the fruit of the Earth had nothing
[45:06] to do with n it had only to do with
[45:08] natural life not with eternal life
[45:10] eternal life was through the tree of
[45:12] life it was through Christ the word amen
[45:14] but the natural body was satisfied and
[45:17] sustained by the fruits and the
[45:18] vegetables of the earth so it wasn't
[45:21] just for humans but it was for the
[45:22] animal life as well so notice now so the
[45:25] fruit of the earth is for sustaining
[45:27] natural life but the fruit of the tree
[45:29] of life is for eternal life two
[45:31] different sources tied to two different
[45:33] purposes and tied to two different
[45:35] commandments so to produce a Son of God
[45:38] they had to be close to the tree of God
[45:41] and then to produce or to sustain
[45:43] Natural Life they had to be close to the
[45:44] Earth and doing what God told them to do
[45:47] and so we saw in Genesis 2:15 it says
[45:49] the Lord God took the man and put him in
[45:51] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[45:53] keep it so to plant and and to to
[45:56] intelligently set things up so that
[45:58] things would produce fruit and lots of
[46:00] fruit because everything now is looking
[46:02] for this fruit amen So Adam has to stay
[46:05] close to God to produce children and
[46:07] he's got to stay close to the Earth and
[46:09] stay in his his position and stay in his
[46:11] job to sustain the rest of life amen the
[46:14] rest of creation is relying on Adam to
[46:17] stay in his
[46:18] position I want to say that again the
[46:20] Earth is is relying on Adam to stay in
[46:25] his position to stay close to God to
[46:27] stay close to the word to be renewed in
[46:29] his purpose every single day because if
[46:32] Adam gets away from the earth from the
[46:34] word then he's going to fail in his
[46:36] other job if he falls they all fall amen
[46:40] because if he stays close to God then he
[46:42] will stay in his position and he'll do
[46:44] what he's supposed to do and we know
[46:46] that what happened is when Adam fell
[46:49] when e fell and then Adam joined her he
[46:51] lost his Dominion he lost his power he
[46:54] lost his support he lost his birth right
[46:57] he lost all of that Dominion that he had
[46:59] as a child of God when he left the word
[47:02] he lost everything that kept him in his
[47:04] position so now it's on him and he's got
[47:07] to work by the sweat of his brow and the
[47:09] the power of his body and these things
[47:11] but that's a lesson for us to have this
[47:13] morning is that when you leave Christ
[47:15] the word you're left to your own devices
[47:17] and let me tell you Church my own
[47:19] devices don't match up to Satan's ever I
[47:22] can't beat him with my intellect he's
[47:24] smarter I can't beat him with my
[47:25] discipline he's got all the time in the
[47:26] world and he doesn't need to
[47:28] sleep I can't beat him I've got to stay
[47:31] in in contact with something that's
[47:33] greater than him and that's greater than
[47:34] me and that's always going to be the
[47:36] word I've got to stay close to Christ
[47:38] he's the eternal life that we're looking
[47:40] for then we read the scripture in Psalms
[47:42] where David said blessed is the man that
[47:44] walketh not in the counsel of the
[47:46] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[47:48] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[47:50] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[47:53] of the
[47:54] Lord can I say this way his choc
[47:58] is the light is the is the law of the
[48:00] Lord his
[48:02] canoli is the word of God pick whatever
[48:06] you like for food whatever you like to
[48:09] do most he says this guy his Delight is
[48:11] the
[48:12] word he says and in his law do he
[48:15] meditate day and night this is a man
[48:17] this is a child of God that's feeding on
[48:19] the word not just occasionally this is
[48:22] somebody that's that feeds on it and
[48:24] meditates on it and thinks about it and
[48:26] dwells on it day and night he says and
[48:29] he shall be like a tree that's planted
[48:31] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[48:33] forth his fruit in his season his Leaf
[48:35] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[48:38] doth shall prosper so a tree that's
[48:39] planted by water will never be
[48:42] unfruitful why because all it needs
[48:44] really is that water that water will
[48:46] bring the nutrients it'll bring
[48:47] everything it needs for growth and
[48:49] because it has an unlimited supply of
[48:51] water it doesn't hold back it doesn't
[48:54] have to to to to conserve the water it
[48:57] doesn't have to conserve the strengths
[48:58] of the nutrients because it knows when I
[49:00] use it up I've got more there there's
[49:03] always something coming in and so I
[49:04] don't have to preserve myself there's no
[49:07] self-preservation in a tree that's got
[49:09] an unlimited supply of water and
[49:10] nutrients it will do what it's meant to
[49:13] do and it'll do it in Leaps and Bounds
[49:15] it'll grow faster than any other tree
[49:17] because it knows that it has no lack
[49:20] amen and Paul David says here that's
[49:24] what a Believer is when they're just
[49:25] drinking and drinking ining and drinking
[49:27] from the Fountain of Life when they're
[49:29] feeding on the word of God when they're
[49:30] applying the word of God he says it's
[49:32] just like they can't stop it it's just
[49:35] doing something in them and it produces
[49:36] fruit and it produces fruit and the
[49:38] leaves don't wither and this person
[49:40] prospers in whatever they do because
[49:42] they're feeding on the right thing day
[49:43] in and day
[49:45] out he says he meditates day and night
[49:49] what are we meditating
[49:51] on are we meditating because David
[49:54] doesn't say if I meditate on the
[49:55] problems I'll produce
[49:57] fruit if I meditate on the circumstances
[49:59] if I meditate on how he's wrong and I'm
[50:01] right if I meditate on how they failed
[50:04] me and I haven't failed them no he says
[50:07] if I meditate on the word then that's
[50:09] when I'm going to get the results our
[50:11] thoughts need to be under the control of
[50:13] the Holy Spirit and brought subject to
[50:14] the word of God because if all I've been
[50:16] meditating on is circumstances and
[50:19] people and and attitudes and
[50:21] personalities and these things that's
[50:23] not going to produce fruit that's going
[50:25] to choke up my life that's going to to
[50:26] choke up what's going on in my life and
[50:29] so when I've been thinking on the word
[50:30] of God when I'm dwelling on the word of
[50:32] God what comes out now is instead of
[50:34] that bitterness and that angst and that
[50:35] resentment and that fear and that
[50:37] selfishness now comes faith and love and
[50:41] joy and peace and rest because what I'm
[50:43] drinking in is what starts coming out of
[50:46] me amen that's what the Holy Spirit does
[50:49] in a Believer we're talking about the
[50:51] evidence of the Holy Spirit the greatest
[50:53] one you'll find is that the holy spirit
[50:55] will make you feel feed on the word of
[50:57] God day in and day out the scripture
[51:00] says that the holy spirit will lead you
[51:02] into all truth that's the word of God so
[51:05] he'll take you to a place and it's not
[51:07] because you have to do it it's because
[51:09] there's a deep calling to the Deep
[51:10] there's something in you that satisfi
[51:12] when it feeds on the word not just
[51:15] feeding on it intellectually or by your
[51:16] mind but when it goes into effect in
[51:19] your life and you see it produce that
[51:21] gets you addicted can I put it that way
[51:23] is it okay to use that word you get
[51:25] addicted to the results of the
[51:27] word when you see God fulfill his
[51:30] promise one time that gives you faith
[51:32] for the next promise and the next
[51:33] promise and the greater promise and the
[51:35] greater promise so you can leave your
[51:38] your trucking job and you can start a
[51:39] company and say he's provided for me now
[51:41] he's going to provide for me again next
[51:43] year so that when you step out in faith
[51:46] and you move somewhere or you change
[51:48] something or you let something go you
[51:50] say I'm feeding on the word and he'll
[51:52] provide what I have need of he'll fill
[51:54] up what I have a lack of this morning
[51:58] amen it keeps you coming back you like
[52:01] the
[52:02] taste you like the results more than
[52:07] anything Braham says this he says we
[52:13] grow
[52:14] when
[52:16] daily you can't grow daily if you're
[52:19] only eating on Wednesdays and
[52:21] Sundays you can't grow daily if you only
[52:24] eat a little bit of in the
[52:27] morning you got to eat daily you got to
[52:30] drink daily to grow
[52:32] daily you know you guys know I I like to
[52:35] work out and I work out to stay in shape
[52:37] not to get big but if you want to get
[52:39] big and have really big muscles you got
[52:41] to eat like you want to be you've got to
[52:45] take in more food and you see these guys
[52:47] that are just huge you know how many
[52:49] meals they eat a day six six meals a day
[52:54] I couldn't do it but they do it because
[52:57] what they want to grow daily and so they
[53:01] eat vast amounts of food he says each
[53:03] day our heart hungers keeps moving on
[53:06] there's something growing inside of you
[53:08] amen you get bigger you spread out you
[53:11] can take more Paul told the Corinthian
[53:14] Church said you're maturing you're
[53:15] growing but when you ought to be
[53:17] teachers you're still babes needing
[53:20] teaching is that right when you ought to
[53:22] be teachers he says there's something in
[53:23] there growing pushing out making ger
[53:26] it's the Holy Spirit growing it's
[53:28] growing in you he says it's a new birth
[53:31] and if a birth is born from the out from
[53:33] the inside out the child it grows if it
[53:36] lives and if it doesn't it remains is
[53:39] that right a baby that's not growing
[53:41] inside of the mother they have big
[53:44] concerns cuz babies grow so fast nothing
[53:48] grows faster than a
[53:50] baby it's amazing I I put our youngest
[53:53] on the scale yesterday because I always
[53:55] not always most nights I brush his teeth
[53:57] and I have to lift him up and sit him on
[53:58] the counter and he's just getting
[54:00] heavier and heavier and I don't know if
[54:02] I'm getting weaker or he's getting
[54:03] bigger and so the decision maker is the
[54:05] scale so I put him on and he's 50 lb 50
[54:09] lb at almost 5 years old where did he go
[54:12] where did that little talk go babies
[54:15] grow faster than anyone and when they
[54:16] stop growing doctors get
[54:18] worried Paul said the same thing he says
[54:21] you ought to be growing but you're
[54:23] having to go through the first works
[54:25] again you're still feeding on baby stuff
[54:28] you got to grow up you got to move on he
[54:31] says well when a birth is on the inside
[54:32] shouldn't It Grow he said the Christ in
[54:35] your heart ought to be growing daily
[54:37] getting bigger more
[54:40] powerful understanding things better can
[54:42] we say
[54:44] Amen
[54:46] forgiving can we say
[54:49] amen and walking on as God would until
[54:53] Christ be formed in you the hope of
[54:56] Glory I think it's so amazing where you
[54:59] can read a scripture and and and then
[55:02] you come back 6 months later and you're
[55:04] at a completely different place with
[55:06] that scripture you get a minister comes
[55:08] in and he preaches on something you've
[55:09] heard before and it means way more to
[55:11] you today than it did then why cuz
[55:13] you're growing you're maturing you're
[55:15] coming up to a higher level a higher
[55:17] plane in your walk with Christ amen and
[55:20] so when that happens what does it do it
[55:22] shifts our attitude it shifts our spirit
[55:25] it shifts our understanding standing and
[55:26] it takes us to a place where we haven't
[55:28] been before and we start to apply it and
[55:30] we start to believe it in a greater way
[55:32] and our faith takes hold of it and the
[55:34] word starts to produce itself in a way
[55:36] that it hasn't before it's just opening
[55:38] up and opening up and opening up I was
[55:41] dealing with a personal situation not
[55:42] too long ago and I opened up my Bible
[55:45] for devotions that morning and there was
[55:47] a scripture there that perfectly
[55:49] addressed it perfectly I didn't have to
[55:52] stop and say Lord is that you I said
[55:54] Lord that's you now it hurt because it
[55:57] put me into a position of growth it put
[56:00] me into a position where I have to
[56:02] humble myself and do what the word says
[56:04] rather than what this flesh wants but I
[56:06] said praise the Lord that you didn't
[56:08] leave me questioning what I needed to do
[56:10] you showed me very clearly what was in
[56:12] your word for me to do and so now that's
[56:14] all it's left is for me to do it see I
[56:17] fed on it by reading it but now I got to
[56:19] feed on it by putting it into action
[56:21] that's really what we're talking about
[56:22] amen it's only going to make me grow if
[56:24] I make it part of me it's only going to
[56:27] grow if I take it down and I digest it
[56:29] and I really eat it and really consume
[56:31] it rather than just mull it over in my
[56:33] mind but the idea is to take it into my
[56:35] life amen but I want to jump ahead this
[56:37] morning now that's our that's our
[56:39] Preamble that's our our reminder of what
[56:41] we've been going through over the last
[56:43] couple services and I want to go to the
[56:45] to Galatians 5 and talk about the fruits
[56:48] of the spirit but I want to start well
[56:50] before the fruits of the spirit because
[56:52] the Holy Spirit had Paul give us this
[56:54] way give it to us this way for a reason
[56:57] amen I believe the scriptures inspired
[56:59] and I believe it's done in a particular
[57:01] order and so Paul starts out he says for
[57:02] Brethren I preached on this recently I
[57:05] know he says for Brethren you have not
[57:07] you have been called unto Liberty only
[57:10] use not Liberty for an occasion to the
[57:12] flesh but by love serve one another so
[57:14] remember we're not under the laws or the
[57:16] covenants of dos and don'ts we're under
[57:19] the Covenant of overcoming power church
[57:22] and so it's not now I can't or I won't
[57:25] it's that the desire has been taken away
[57:28] and I have power inside of me to
[57:29] overcome the fleshly desires of my life
[57:32] that's the Covenant we're living under
[57:33] so we're not in a place of legalism but
[57:36] now we're in a place where our Liberty
[57:38] is for service and for help and support
[57:42] amen I was praying the other day I don't
[57:44] tend to have a whole lot of free
[57:46] time but I was as I read this scripture
[57:49] and I said Lord where I have my free
[57:52] time help me to use it to benefit
[57:57] listen I need a break as much as anybody
[57:58] else but if every time I've got Liberty
[58:01] I use it for me rather than somebody
[58:04] else I'm not fulfilling the scripture I
[58:07] said Lord help me to be aware of how I'm
[58:10] burning up time of how I'm wasting time
[58:14] so that I can do something hey I may not
[58:17] go talk to somebody or fellowship with
[58:18] somebody but it may be that I read the
[58:20] better thing that I watch the better
[58:23] thing that I look up something
[58:27] and of course that I spend time with my
[58:28] family and these things and I tend to do
[58:30] okay with that but just to say Lord help
[58:32] me not to instantly switch to relaxation
[58:34] mode the minute I get a free moment my
[58:37] life's pretty hectic and it can be easy
[58:39] to do that but I believe our lives ought
[58:41] to be rung
[58:43] out we've got a time of refreshing but
[58:45] that's so that we can be rung out
[58:48] again amen our our our mothers and our
[58:52] wives know about this they're looking at
[58:54] me kind of grinning painfully right now
[58:58] us Brothers know about it two different
[59:00] sides of the same coin I
[59:01] think but our Liberty is not for S it's
[59:04] for you my Liberty is for you and your
[59:06] Liberty is supposed to be for me let's
[59:09] stop he says for all the law is
[59:11] fulfilled in one word even in this Thou
[59:14] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I
[59:16] want to jump back to Jesus words before
[59:17] we come back to Galatians 5 he says and
[59:19] one of the scribes came and having heard
[59:21] them reasoning together and perceiving
[59:23] that he had answered them well asked him
[59:25] which is the first commandment of all
[59:26] what's the greatest commandment Jesus
[59:28] and Jesus answered him the first of all
[59:30] the Commandments is this here o Israel
[59:33] the Lord our God is one Lord and thou
[59:36] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[59:38] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[59:40] mind with all thy strength this is the
[59:43] first commandment we read this last
[59:44] service about how producing fruit in our
[59:46] lives we're supposed to give God
[59:48] everything not just be partway not just
[59:51] be halfway give them everything or give
[59:53] them nothing cuz otherwise it's idolatry
[59:55] it's something else that's there he says
[59:58] but the second is like namely this Thou
[1:00:02] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there
[1:00:04] is none other commandment greater than
[1:00:06] these so if you do these two things in
[1:00:10] that order you'll stay in the word of
[1:00:12] God every time Jesus said if you want
[1:00:14] the laws this is it you do this that's
[1:00:17] it you're
[1:00:19] set because if you love God you'll do
[1:00:22] his will you'll follow his word you'll
[1:00:24] accept his word and if you love your
[1:00:26] brother and your sister as much as you
[1:00:28] love
[1:00:29] yourself then you'll treat them as much
[1:00:31] as as well as you treat yourself and
[1:00:33] guess it nobody knows how to treat us as
[1:00:34] well as we do
[1:00:36] ourselves I can pamper myself like
[1:00:38] nobody else I just can't
[1:00:42] cook we know how to treat each other we
[1:00:44] know how to treat ourselves well we're
[1:00:46] supposed to take that and use it for
[1:00:48] others now so that what I would do for
[1:00:51] myself I'll do for you and not hold back
[1:00:56] it's critical to get that order right
[1:00:58] because if we love our neighbor first
[1:01:01] and we love God second you know what
[1:01:02] happens we start to love our neighbor
[1:01:04] the way they want to be loved instead of
[1:01:06] the way they should be loved as parents
[1:01:08] we know what love means don't we as a
[1:01:11] spouse we know what that love means our
[1:01:13] love is not to give them what they want
[1:01:14] it's to give them what they need
[1:01:17] sometimes to give them what they want
[1:01:18] God gives us a desires of our heart but
[1:01:21] he gives us what we need his promise is
[1:01:23] for our needs and then the wants is
[1:01:26] really his Sovereign Grace and Mercy to
[1:01:28] us if if he would do that amen but if we
[1:01:30] want to be loved correctly it's got to
[1:01:33] be by the word it's got to be pulled
[1:01:34] through Christ the word amen you I heard
[1:01:37] a man speaking the other day a preacher
[1:01:39] he was talking about being merciful and
[1:01:41] he says he he said the least I'm
[1:01:43] paraphrasing he said the least merciful
[1:01:46] thing we can do is hear somebody say
[1:01:49] something that's wrong and keep our
[1:01:51] mouth
[1:01:53] shut why because because the only thing
[1:01:56] that's going to set them free is
[1:01:59] truth and so if we hear them say
[1:02:02] something and remember it's 99% true
[1:02:04] usually and just that little bit that's
[1:02:05] missing but if we leave them in that
[1:02:08] condition they can never be set free now
[1:02:11] we don't be rude we don't be egotistical
[1:02:13] we don't be pushy we're not trying to be
[1:02:14] overbearing but if we can in love and
[1:02:16] humility show them what the word says
[1:02:19] that gives them an opportunity to come
[1:02:21] up a little higher but it's not merciful
[1:02:23] to keep our mouth shut and so often we
[1:02:25] keep our mouth shut because we don't
[1:02:27] want the awkwardness we don't want to
[1:02:29] deal with potential rejection and so
[1:02:32] we'll say well that's just the way they
[1:02:34] believe
[1:02:35] it
[1:02:37] sure but that didn't stop the the
[1:02:39] disciples from going out and preaching
[1:02:40] the gospel to everyone that believed it
[1:02:42] completely
[1:02:43] differently amen we give a witness of
[1:02:46] what God has given
[1:02:47] us whether or not we feel good about how
[1:02:50] the other person's going to feel if I
[1:02:53] love somebody remember there was I think
[1:02:55] it was a a
[1:02:57] barber Billy Paul's
[1:02:59] Barber and he the his Barber he never
[1:03:03] told
[1:03:04] him about the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[1:03:07] one day the man came up to him and he
[1:03:09] was he was in tears and he says why did
[1:03:12] you never tell me about
[1:03:17] this well you're just cutting my
[1:03:20] hair I didn't think you needed to know I
[1:03:22] what what no our Mercy is in showing
[1:03:26] them the word our love is in showing
[1:03:29] them the word that's how we show a
[1:03:31] person love as we show them the word not
[1:03:33] to
[1:03:34] condemn but to offer them the mercy of
[1:03:38] Christ if they can come to the truth and
[1:03:40] they can receive it
[1:03:43] amen Paul
[1:03:45] continues he says but if he bite and
[1:03:48] devour one another take heed that you be
[1:03:51] not consumed one of another nobody wins
[1:03:53] when we're fighting basically he says
[1:03:55] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[1:03:58] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:04:00] flesh so if you want to defeat this
[1:04:02] flesh you've got to be led by the spirit
[1:04:04] if you're struggling with something in
[1:04:06] your life you need to be led by the
[1:04:07] spirit out of it because we get drawn in
[1:04:10] by the flesh remember God doesn't lead
[1:04:12] us into that we lead ourselves into it
[1:04:14] James said we're drawn aside by our own
[1:04:16] things amen but this is a daily thing
[1:04:19] walking in the spirit like I said it's
[1:04:21] not a Sunday and Wednesday night thing
[1:04:24] it's a daily thing walk walk in the
[1:04:26] spirit brother John how do I be led by
[1:04:28] the spirit find yourself in the word
[1:04:30] find your life in the word find your
[1:04:32] situation in the word and then stick to
[1:04:34] what the word says about it because the
[1:04:36] holy spirit will never lead you contrary
[1:04:37] to the word of God but it's a daily
[1:04:40] experience not a one time not a church
[1:04:42] experience not a an occasional
[1:04:43] experience it's a day-by-day thing that
[1:04:45] we do why do we have to do it he says
[1:04:48] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:04:51] and the spirit against the flesh so
[1:04:52] there's a war that's going on in every
[1:04:54] believer there's a War every single day
[1:04:57] he says and these are contrary the one
[1:04:59] to the other so that you cannot do the
[1:05:01] things that you would Paul's not writing
[1:05:03] to unbelievers church he's writing to
[1:05:05] spirit filled Christians and he's saying
[1:05:08] you've got a fight on your hands so this
[1:05:11] morning if you've got a fight with this
[1:05:13] thing in your flesh don't say that means
[1:05:15] I don't got the Holy Spirit the fact
[1:05:17] that you're fighting shows that there's
[1:05:18] something in you that's Waring and it's
[1:05:20] something in your soul and something
[1:05:22] that's in your flesh and what's in your
[1:05:24] soul is of God what's in your flesh is
[1:05:26] not and so there's a battle that's going
[1:05:28] on but the fact that there's a battle
[1:05:30] shows there's something inside of you
[1:05:32] that doesn't get along with this flesh
[1:05:33] that's a great evidence that you fight
[1:05:36] not that you give in yes we lose
[1:05:39] sometimes we lose don't we but I still
[1:05:41] get up and I fight again that's the
[1:05:43] nature of a Believer we get up and we
[1:05:45] fight and we fight but there's always
[1:05:47] going to be this dispute with the
[1:05:50] flesh he says but if you be led of the
[1:05:53] spirit you are not under the law now
[1:05:55] Paul goes here and if we read ahead to
[1:05:58] all this you'd say brother John that is
[1:06:00] not in our church we don't deal with
[1:06:02] this and some of it by God's grace I
[1:06:04] believe we don't but watch what he says
[1:06:06] now now the works of the flesh are
[1:06:09] manifest which are these so he says if
[1:06:12] you want to know if you're doing what
[1:06:13] the flesh wants this is it adultery so
[1:06:16] that's breaking your marital vows
[1:06:17] fornication that's intimacy outside of
[1:06:20] marriage uncleanness lasciviousness this
[1:06:23] is all tied to sexual immorality and you
[1:06:26] say well brother John we don't deal with
[1:06:27] that well let me tell you if you're a
[1:06:30] man you're going to be tempted
[1:06:32] especially in this area
[1:06:34] 100% this is a struggle for men mostly
[1:06:37] not for women and the flesh desires
[1:06:40] certain
[1:06:41] things but there's a spirit there to
[1:06:43] combat it amen Paul isn't mentioning
[1:06:47] this because it's not in the
[1:06:49] church amen Paul's mentioning it because
[1:06:53] Satan is always trying to get his licks
[1:06:56] in and he's trying to put things in
[1:06:58] front of your eyes and in front of your
[1:06:59] mind and in front of your flesh and
[1:07:01] these different things so these are
[1:07:03] actions of the flesh now these are the
[1:07:05] works of the flesh then he says idolatry
[1:07:08] and Witchcraft and I've I've preached on
[1:07:09] this before we would say well brother
[1:07:11] John we don't have idolatry here we took
[1:07:13] all the Catholic statues out we're good
[1:07:16] and we definitely are not into
[1:07:18] witchcraft here but remember what Samuel
[1:07:21] said to Saul he said that Rebellion is
[1:07:24] the same as witchcraft
[1:07:26] and iniquity is the same as idolatry to
[1:07:28] God so to do something iniquity is to
[1:07:31] know to do something and not do it what
[1:07:33] do you do you make something else an
[1:07:35] idol ahead of God then he says Rebellion
[1:07:38] is as witchcraft what is rebellion
[1:07:44] self-will he says
[1:07:46] hatred now there's a lot of these words
[1:07:48] look very similar and as I went through
[1:07:50] these when I was studying I went back to
[1:07:51] the original words and I want to kind of
[1:07:53] open them up as we go through
[1:07:56] so if we could say idolatry let's say
[1:07:58] it's iniquity witchcraft let's call it
[1:07:59] Rebellion hatred is enmity deep-seated
[1:08:04] animosity variance means Strife conflict
[1:08:08] and disagreement or
[1:08:11] rivalry
[1:08:12] emulations these are jealousies by
[1:08:16] competition due to
[1:08:19] comparisons now catch this one wrath the
[1:08:23] root word here is breathing heaven
[1:08:26] I had a bit of a
[1:08:28] giggle you ever get so mad and you're
[1:08:30] just
[1:08:32] like and you don't know what to
[1:08:35] do it's outbursts of anger it's boiling
[1:08:39] agitation it's being worked up and
[1:08:42] letting it all out in a moment anybody
[1:08:46] ever done
[1:08:48] that nine of
[1:08:51] us we get worked
[1:08:54] up he says this is the works of the
[1:08:57] flesh Strife now this one's different
[1:08:59] this is selfish contentions when you're
[1:09:02] seeking influence and you have Ambitions
[1:09:05] for self-gain which lead to division and
[1:09:07] separation amongst the
[1:09:09] body then it's seditions this is Discord
[1:09:13] amongst the body leading to separations
[1:09:15] into factions or
[1:09:17] groups and the last one he says here is
[1:09:20] heresies this is a self-chosen opinion
[1:09:23] or doctrine that disagrees with the
[1:09:26] word and you gather people around
[1:09:29] it okay so these are issues of the mind
[1:09:33] they issues of attitude they issues of
[1:09:37] emotions that lead to actions catch this
[1:09:41] these are the works of the flesh amen I
[1:09:44] don't think there's a person in here can
[1:09:45] say that not one of those has ever
[1:09:47] touched
[1:09:48] them if only on the anger side of things
[1:09:51] I don't think I've known anybody that's
[1:09:53] never exploded at some point or another
[1:09:55] things just build up and we let go but
[1:09:58] we can absolutely get into
[1:10:01] comparisons we can get into they do
[1:10:03] things that I don't get to do or they
[1:10:05] have things that I don't
[1:10:07] have people like them better than they
[1:10:09] like
[1:10:10] me they're more
[1:10:12] accepted more
[1:10:15] appreciated that's why I try and thank
[1:10:17] everybody that does what they
[1:10:19] do so you don't think I've got favorites
[1:10:23] even though brother Bob is my favorite
[1:10:29] that's
[1:10:30] it you got two votes brother Bob we
[1:10:34] laugh we laugh but guess what if I go up
[1:10:37] and I spend all my time with brother
[1:10:39] brother Bob after service you're going
[1:10:40] to believe me if you've got that
[1:10:44] spirit I say that it's the flesh it's
[1:10:47] Satan trying to get in and divide us
[1:10:51] amen listen Satan will play your
[1:10:54] feelings and emotions like a banjo you
[1:10:56] you ever see those those uh those
[1:10:58] hillbilly Pickers when they're playing a
[1:11:01] banjo and they're going nuts and you're
[1:11:03] like how can human hands pick that way
[1:11:06] That's what Satan loves to do with our
[1:11:08] emotions with our mind with our thoughts
[1:11:11] with our attitudes he can play us like a
[1:11:14] banjo why this flesh is susceptible to
[1:11:18] him
[1:11:20] amen it takes walking in the spirit to
[1:11:24] keep this flesh from walking all over
[1:11:27] you takes meditating on the word it
[1:11:30] takes thinking about the promises and
[1:11:33] the good things and the pure things
[1:11:36] rather than the situations and the
[1:11:37] people and the
[1:11:39] personalities then he
[1:11:41] continues envyings this is grudges and
[1:11:44] spites that are usually tied to jealousy
[1:11:46] or
[1:11:47] rivalry we're not meant to
[1:11:49] compare we're not meant to compare what
[1:11:52] we're meant to be is in our place and do
[1:11:54] our own part heart amen we're meant to
[1:11:56] be what God made us to be murders now we
[1:11:58] do not commit murder in this church we
[1:12:00] are firmly against
[1:12:02] murder brother Bram says you can murder
[1:12:05] a man or a person by character
[1:12:08] assassination you can hit their
[1:12:11] character you can hit their influence
[1:12:16] you can hit their image their reputation
[1:12:20] and it just takes a little hint just a
[1:12:23] hint of something wrong can turn
[1:12:25] somebody against
[1:12:28] them
[1:12:29] drunkenness I hope we don't have that
[1:12:32] here but maybe we do I don't
[1:12:37] know he says Rings
[1:12:40] partying and such like of the which I
[1:12:43] tell you before as I have also told you
[1:12:45] in time past that they which do such
[1:12:48] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:12:50] God God help
[1:12:53] us but he says now notice this is the
[1:12:55] works of the flesh not the
[1:12:58] fruit this is the works of the flesh
[1:13:01] because the works are the fun part if I
[1:13:02] could put it that way even letting go of
[1:13:05] all those emotions feels good sometimes
[1:13:08] in the flesh but then what do I have to
[1:13:10] deal with I've got to go and I've got to
[1:13:12] apologize after and that's the fruits if
[1:13:14] I'm a Christian listen if we let things
[1:13:17] go you know what's going to happen we're
[1:13:18] going to get humiliated and humiliation
[1:13:21] should lead to
[1:13:22] humility which should lead us to a place
[1:13:24] where where we say God I really prefer
[1:13:26] that not happen again and so we put
[1:13:28] ourselves down and we say God would you
[1:13:31] make a change in our life but during the
[1:13:33] work of the flesh that's when the fun
[1:13:36] is listen I've never committed adultery
[1:13:39] by God's grace or fornication those
[1:13:40] things but people aren't talking about
[1:13:42] the fruit of it when they're doing it
[1:13:45] all they're focused on is the enjoyment
[1:13:47] how it makes them feel the acceptance
[1:13:50] they have the the the sensuality
[1:13:52] whatever it might be the sensations and
[1:13:53] these different things but N9 months
[1:13:55] later sometimes you get the fruit don't
[1:13:57] you and you say I really wasn't thinking
[1:13:59] about that I wish I'd thought about the
[1:14:01] fruit but notice Satan focus is on the
[1:14:03] works not on the fruit if he can get you
[1:14:06] by the works you'll just keep doing the
[1:14:08] works because they're so much fun and
[1:14:09] then you reap a harvest down the road
[1:14:12] that you didn't think about because you
[1:14:13] were feeling too good when you're doing
[1:14:15] those things but the fruit of it always
[1:14:17] is what pain separation death disease
[1:14:23] the wages of sin is death scripture says
[1:14:25] it's going to cause bad things down the
[1:14:27] line
[1:14:28] amen watch what brother Braham says he
[1:14:30] says and a man is what he is when he's
[1:14:33] under pressure his real true
[1:14:36] characteristics will show when he's
[1:14:38] under pressure get them all riled up
[1:14:40] stirred up then you'll see the real man
[1:14:41] come out if he's got temper it'll show
[1:14:43] himself I used to say I don't have a
[1:14:45] temper but see what it is I'm really
[1:14:47] good at holding
[1:14:50] it me and
[1:14:53] Vel I'm really good at holding it it
[1:14:55] takes longer maybe for mine to go off
[1:14:57] now I don't actually think I'm that that
[1:14:58] good at holding it back if I was to be
[1:15:00] honest but what I wouldn't do is get
[1:15:03] necessarily upset at little things
[1:15:04] people would do but I'd let them build
[1:15:06] up into big things and then it' blow
[1:15:09] up he to get them all riled up stirred
[1:15:11] up then you'll see the real man come out
[1:15:13] if he's got temper it'll show itself if
[1:15:15] he's meek and gentle it'll show itself
[1:15:17] put him under pressure once he said and
[1:15:20] God puts all his children under test to
[1:15:23] see whether there's any flaws in them I
[1:15:26] used to do a lot of work with pressure
[1:15:28] vessels when I was back in my
[1:15:29] engineering days and anytime you do a
[1:15:31] pressure vessel you have to do a
[1:15:32] pressure
[1:15:34] test but the last thing we want to do is
[1:15:36] do the pressure test and have it fail so
[1:15:39] what do we do Church you don't know
[1:15:41] brother Matts knows Michel knows you do
[1:15:44] Quality Inspection and assurance and
[1:15:47] they go over it and they put fluorescent
[1:15:49] lights on it and they check it for
[1:15:50] cracks they do Meg particle inspection
[1:15:52] they do visual inspection they do
[1:15:54] measurement they do everything they
[1:15:56] inspect every weld they look at every
[1:15:58] material certification to say is this
[1:16:00] thing going to hold and then only when
[1:16:03] they believe it will hold do they put it
[1:16:05] under pressure because when metal
[1:16:07] explodes especially if there's air
[1:16:09] inside of it it's a bad thing it's a
[1:16:12] bomb he says God puts all his children
[1:16:15] under test to see whether there's any
[1:16:16] flaws in them because he doesn't want
[1:16:18] you blowing up at the worst moment he
[1:16:20] wants you to hold he wants you to be
[1:16:23] able to hold when the when when things
[1:16:24] hit hard see we tend to look at it the
[1:16:27] other way it's how we are 99% of the
[1:16:29] time that's what validates our
[1:16:30] Christianity he says no it's the
[1:16:33] 1% everybody does good when things are
[1:16:36] good so what's the test in
[1:16:39] that amen but it's when life isn't easy
[1:16:42] when conditions are rough when health is
[1:16:44] failing finances are are are are are
[1:16:46] falling out of the bank account faster
[1:16:48] than they're filling up when we're under
[1:16:50] the gun when we're under the microscope
[1:16:51] that's when the pressure hits and that's
[1:16:54] when it we really show are true
[1:16:55] colors he says this if somebody says
[1:16:58] sister so and so or brother so and so
[1:17:00] he's speaking somebody speaking of a
[1:17:02] fellow believer in some way don't you
[1:17:04] believe one word of it you just leave it
[1:17:07] go because remember it's the devil
[1:17:09] trying to tear you to pieces now just
[1:17:12] look for him to come in cuz he'll do it
[1:17:13] who Satan Satan is trying to get into
[1:17:16] the body of Believers now you let the
[1:17:19] good man so he says don't let him in
[1:17:21] what here's what you do now you let the
[1:17:23] good man of the house f
[1:17:25] stand right there and don't you receive
[1:17:27] one thing those people have been set in
[1:17:31] Heavenly places with you Hallelujah when
[1:17:34] I look around this morning each believer
[1:17:38] here has been set in Heavenly places in
[1:17:40] Christ with me we're fellow heirs we're
[1:17:43] joint hirs we're at the same level we're
[1:17:47] at the same calling we're at the same
[1:17:49] position we're together around the
[1:17:51] blessings of God taking the communion at
[1:17:53] the table and the the Holy Spirit has
[1:17:55] witnessed that they are the children of
[1:17:58] God so who am I to
[1:18:02] judge it's not mine to
[1:18:05] judge he says let's just be real sweet
[1:18:08] kindhearted forgiving
[1:18:12] loving oh boy I didn't see this in
[1:18:16] here yes I did and if the other person
[1:18:21] talks evil against you you talk sweet
[1:18:24] against
[1:18:27] them that's a little
[1:18:29] rough I don't get to get my licks in I
[1:18:32] just got to take the
[1:18:34] hits
[1:18:36] yep he says watch how sweeter comes to
[1:18:39] you
[1:18:41] then see you reap what you sow a soft
[1:18:45] answer turns away wrath if you come back
[1:18:49] with a hammer what are you going to get
[1:18:52] a bigger hammer
[1:18:55] he says see that's right just always
[1:18:58] return good for evil and love for
[1:19:02] hate continuing on now the fruits of the
[1:19:04] spirit he says but the fruit of the
[1:19:06] spirit see the works of the flesh was
[1:19:08] all those things now we're at the fruit
[1:19:09] of the
[1:19:10] spirit so if you got the spirit it's
[1:19:13] done a work and this is what that work
[1:19:15] produces the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:19:19] this is the nature of God it's Agape
[1:19:22] it's it's it's the the the definition of
[1:19:24] God God God is love God is agape this is
[1:19:27] him in his Essence it says the fruit of
[1:19:30] the spirit is Joy now when I looked at
[1:19:33] this it the the root is not Joy it says
[1:19:35] it is the source of
[1:19:39] joy in other words you've got a source
[1:19:42] inside of you you've got a Wellspring of
[1:19:45] Joy so it's not based on what the
[1:19:47] situation is or how you're feeling it's
[1:19:49] based on what you are that's where the
[1:19:52] joy is it's always there it's is
[1:19:54] available it says you are the spir fruit
[1:19:57] of the spirit is peace that word means
[1:20:00] you are complete you are sound you are
[1:20:03] tied together into a whole unit let me
[1:20:06] put it this way you know what my boys
[1:20:10] like to wrestle and and fight and these
[1:20:12] different
[1:20:13] things did you know that I'm at peace
[1:20:16] when I'm wrestling with my
[1:20:18] boys except Jonathan I haven't wrestled
[1:20:20] with him in a while but the younger ones
[1:20:22] you know why I'm at peace cuz they can't
[1:20:25] do anything to
[1:20:26] me I'm sound I'm whole I'm bigger I'm
[1:20:31] stronger I'm meaner if I got to be they
[1:20:33] can't touch me they can't do anything
[1:20:36] that would truly conquer me and so I'm
[1:20:39] at peace even in the storm if I could
[1:20:42] put it that way because I'm secure I'm
[1:20:45] not worried about what they can do and
[1:20:48] see so often that's our problem is that
[1:20:50] we get worried about what's going to
[1:20:52] happen rather than recognize izing where
[1:20:55] our foundation
[1:20:56] is and people will rage and people will
[1:20:59] get up in arms and they'll I've got a
[1:21:01] coworker that's always up in arms and
[1:21:03] I'm like you're going to go to you're
[1:21:04] going to die in early death you have no
[1:21:07] peace everything's bad everything's gone
[1:21:09] to Hell in a hand basket and you don't
[1:21:11] know how to get
[1:21:13] out I'm living in the same world but
[1:21:15] I've got a piece he doesn't have cuz I'm
[1:21:18] secure in Christ I'm resting in
[1:21:21] him then he says longsuffering
[1:21:25] oh my our flesh hates this one
[1:21:28] longsuffering patient slow to anger and
[1:21:32] it says this is specifically the quality
[1:21:35] of God in enduring and showing
[1:21:39] Mercy
[1:21:41] wow the flesh hates
[1:21:44] that
[1:21:46] gentleness this is kindness and
[1:21:50] benevolence seeking the good of
[1:21:53] others then says goodness Pleasant
[1:21:57] agreeable
[1:21:59] beneficial then he comes to this this
[1:22:01] wonderful one faith and the word there
[1:22:03] is actually not Faith the word is
[1:22:06] faithful it's reliable trustworthy
[1:22:10] confidence inspiring you know you You'
[1:22:13] you met these people no matter what
[1:22:15] happens you can trust them they're
[1:22:18] always there you can always rely on them
[1:22:20] you can always depend on them that's
[1:22:21] literally the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:23] coming out in their life
[1:22:25] then he says this I love meekness
[1:22:28] meekness it's humility it's
[1:22:32] calmness exercising power to help and
[1:22:36] assist others and then it says it is
[1:22:38] gentle strength like a gentle
[1:22:41] giant have you ever I've never met
[1:22:43] really a woman like this maybe sister
[1:22:45] Joan might have met done this you ever
[1:22:47] meet these guys I've met them you see
[1:22:49] him in the gym Joe Joe and I were
[1:22:51] working out the other day and and this
[1:22:53] guy was warming up with the weight that
[1:22:54] we maxed out
[1:22:56] at and so we went and we baited his
[1:22:58] knees in and ran away laughing
[1:23:01] gleefully he was so strong just big not
[1:23:06] all muscles just big a gentle giant and
[1:23:10] he's making things that we can't do look
[1:23:13] easy just a gentle giant and you'll see
[1:23:16] people like that I know a guy in in in
[1:23:18] British
[1:23:21] Columbia and he's always happy
[1:23:25] but he's like 6'4 and about 260
[1:23:28] lbs and he wanted to play basketball
[1:23:30] against me one time now I I was you know
[1:23:33] 70 pounds lighter yeah I'm a little
[1:23:35] shorter but I figured I'm going to be
[1:23:37] way faster than this guy it's not going
[1:23:38] even going to be a challenge to beat
[1:23:39] this guy in basketball I don't think I
[1:23:41] scored a point on him he had everything
[1:23:43] he needed but he was so calm he just was
[1:23:46] swatting the ball away swatting the ball
[1:23:48] away I'd try and drive through him he
[1:23:50] just kind of look down at me and then
[1:23:51] throw me away and take the ball a gentle
[1:23:54] giant
[1:23:55] his strength was not there to beat me
[1:23:58] up he just was strong but he was gentle
[1:24:03] with it one of the nicest Brothers I've
[1:24:04] met in my life wonderful guy gentle
[1:24:07] Giants people that just go in and they
[1:24:10] get stuff done for you and they're not
[1:24:13] trying to hurt you they don't get riled
[1:24:15] up if you don't quite appreciate them a
[1:24:17] certain way they're just there and they
[1:24:19] get it done then he says
[1:24:22] Temperance self-control
[1:24:25] strength and restraint controlling one's
[1:24:28] emotions thoughts and actions now I
[1:24:32] think every single one of us can use
[1:24:34] some Temperance because we've all got
[1:24:36] areas where we're less temperate than
[1:24:38] others listen whether it's food whether
[1:24:40] it's exercise whether it's reading your
[1:24:42] Bible whether it's Electronics
[1:24:44] entertainment books whatever it might be
[1:24:47] careers making money whatever it is
[1:24:50] we've got areas where we need to be more
[1:24:52] temperate and guess what that's what the
[1:24:54] whole H spirit's here to do is to bring
[1:24:56] you into
[1:24:57] moderation to bring you into
[1:24:59] control he says against all of these
[1:25:02] against all of the fruits of the spirit
[1:25:04] there is no other law there is no no law
[1:25:07] so in other words these nine attributes
[1:25:08] of the spirit see in some things under
[1:25:11] the law you could only do so much you're
[1:25:14] only supposed to do so much but Paul's
[1:25:16] saying when it comes to these things
[1:25:18] there's no limit on how much you can
[1:25:20] have you can't have too much
[1:25:22] meekness you can't have too much
[1:25:24] patience patience you can't have too
[1:25:25] much longsuffering you can't have too
[1:25:26] much love this is the very nature of God
[1:25:29] and the more you have the better off you
[1:25:31] are and the better off those that are
[1:25:33] around you will be as well amen but
[1:25:36] these fruits notice these are the
[1:25:38] external evidence of an internal work it
[1:25:43] has to be the spirit inside of you this
[1:25:45] is not from an anointing on you this is
[1:25:48] from Christ Living inside of you pushing
[1:25:51] himself out the fruits are an internal
[1:25:53] work EXP exed outwardly then you have
[1:25:55] the gifts of the Spirit which are an
[1:25:57] external thing expressed externally it's
[1:26:01] for other people but it's not an
[1:26:03] Evidence of the Holy Spirit the fruit is
[1:26:04] the evidence of the spirit the gifts are
[1:26:07] independent because they have nothing to
[1:26:08] do with the condition of your soul we've
[1:26:11] said it many times Judas had gifts balam
[1:26:14] had gifts Caiaphas had
[1:26:17] gifts we said last service how that
[1:26:19] Rebecca had the gifts of Isaac before
[1:26:21] she ever got married to Isaac she hadn't
[1:26:23] even met him and yet she had his
[1:26:25] gifts the disciples before they ever
[1:26:28] received the Holy Spirit had power they
[1:26:29] had authority over demons over sickness
[1:26:32] over death itself but they hadn't
[1:26:34] received the Holy Spirit and Judas was
[1:26:35] numbered amongst them the gifts are just
[1:26:38] that they're gifts but they're intended
[1:26:40] to draw you to The Giver they're
[1:26:42] intended to bring you to the bridegroom
[1:26:44] Jesus Christ not so you can sit there
[1:26:45] and say and be warm and fuzzy and look
[1:26:47] how much he loves me look how much he's
[1:26:49] given me no he wants to give you himself
[1:26:52] that's the purpose of this is that you
[1:26:54] could be United with him not with his
[1:26:58] gifts he says there was no blemish on
[1:27:01] him and yet he suffered Temptation like
[1:27:04] any other man he's speaking of Christ
[1:27:06] yet he was scorned he was made fun of he
[1:27:08] was persecuted from the hour he was born
[1:27:10] until the hour he died and yet he
[1:27:13] returned good for evil what kind of
[1:27:15] character did that take that at the very
[1:27:17] end he said father forgive them for they
[1:27:20] don't know what they're doing
[1:27:25] what ought we to have as an attitude
[1:27:27] when people do us
[1:27:30] wrong justly do us
[1:27:33] wrong not that they did it justly but
[1:27:36] that we know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:27:37] they've done us
[1:27:39] wrong what ought our attitude to be the
[1:27:42] bride is always
[1:27:44] forgiveness always forgiveness amen
[1:27:47] judgments coming after judgment comes
[1:27:49] after we leave
[1:27:54] he says you cannot no way ever produce a
[1:27:58] character like
[1:27:59] that he says only you can do it by
[1:28:03] accepting that character in you a church
[1:28:07] cannot do it a Creed cannot do it a
[1:28:09] denomination cannot do it an education
[1:28:12] cannot do that it must be a birth it's
[1:28:16] got to be a dying out and let God in by
[1:28:18] the grace of Christ to mold this type of
[1:28:21] character in you he says then you be
[1:28:24] become him and your life and his is the
[1:28:27] same then you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:28:32] God so every single one of these
[1:28:35] attributes ought to be in the life of a
[1:28:38] mature
[1:28:40] believer now notice how I'm saying that
[1:28:42] mature believer because it's only a
[1:28:45] mature tree that produces
[1:28:48] fruits you know we've got an apple tree
[1:28:50] outside of our
[1:28:52] house you plant an apple apple tree they
[1:28:54] say it takes about 8 years to produce
[1:28:56] fruit that doesn't mean it isn't an
[1:28:58] apple tree until it produces fruit it's
[1:29:01] always an apple tree but there's a time
[1:29:03] and a season as it matures as it grows
[1:29:06] that it can bear the fruit and it can
[1:29:08] bear the stresses that come with the
[1:29:10] fruit it's built itself up to a place
[1:29:12] where it can produce the fruit and not
[1:29:14] itself die and shrivel away amen
[1:29:17] remember we read in the in the
[1:29:18] scriptures a while ago that you're born
[1:29:21] a baby in Christ you're not born IM
[1:29:23] mature
[1:29:24] believer but as you come to maturity the
[1:29:28] purpose of a Believer is to produce the
[1:29:30] fruit of the Holy Spirit that's a
[1:29:32] process of time it's a process of eating
[1:29:34] it's a pro process of maturing it's a
[1:29:37] process of spending time with God and if
[1:29:39] you do that then in time you'll produce
[1:29:41] every single one of these
[1:29:44] fruits but remember Adam couldn't be
[1:29:48] fruitful unless he was in the presence
[1:29:51] of the Tree of
[1:29:53] Life his fruitfulness as he was intended
[1:29:56] to produce
[1:29:57] it was through Christ the word Adam was
[1:30:01] of no use to the creation if he wasn't
[1:30:04] eating from the Tree of
[1:30:05] Life he was of no
[1:30:08] use that personal dayto day dying out
[1:30:13] that relationship that closeness that
[1:30:15] checking in that inspiration that
[1:30:17] guidance is what we need to keep us in a
[1:30:21] fruitful condition that's the way it was
[1:30:23] with Adam the way it it is for a child
[1:30:25] of God I referenced this quote last
[1:30:27] service but I wanted to put it up here
[1:30:29] just officially and brother says here we
[1:30:31] are formed to the word image to be a
[1:30:35] partaker of the word to feed on the word
[1:30:38] by being predestinated since the
[1:30:39] beginning so he's looking to God is
[1:30:42] trying to produce the the the word in
[1:30:44] you and I that's why he sent it that's
[1:30:46] why he sent the spirit is to produce
[1:30:48] himself in us again be fruitful he's
[1:30:50] trying to produce God in in in sons and
[1:30:53] daughters again but he says we're formed
[1:30:55] to that word in order to what so we can
[1:30:58] take the word and feed the word to
[1:31:01] produce the word that's what we're
[1:31:03] brought in the first place then he would
[1:31:05] say this in spiritual food and due
[1:31:06] season he says now we notice here again
[1:31:08] if the word is in us and has come to us
[1:31:12] as it did Elijah in that day it'll do
[1:31:14] the same thing that he did he would feed
[1:31:16] on the secret things of God which is
[1:31:19] hidden from the world he says oh again
[1:31:21] it makes the message and the messenger
[1:31:23] is one
[1:31:24] the spiritual food's ready and it's in
[1:31:26] the season now he says for each one of
[1:31:29] you can have this food if you wish
[1:31:32] it if you're willing to steal away from
[1:31:36] all of the unbelief of this hour and if
[1:31:39] you're ready to come into Christ and
[1:31:40] come into his promise what is it what
[1:31:43] the world sees us do what the world sees
[1:31:45] us say what the world sees us live every
[1:31:48] day is based on what they cannot see
[1:31:51] which is the hidden life in Christ what
[1:31:53] we do in private is what comes out in
[1:31:55] public
[1:31:57] amen what we do in private is what comes
[1:31:59] out in public that's the hidden life of
[1:32:02] the believer and we cannot hide it even
[1:32:04] if we try to listen if you're feeding on
[1:32:07] the word it's going to come out you
[1:32:09] can't hide it and if you're not feeding
[1:32:11] on the world word then guess what that's
[1:32:13] going to come out as well because you're
[1:32:14] feeding on something else if all we feed
[1:32:17] on in a week is a couple of church
[1:32:18] services guess what's going to come out
[1:32:20] a couple of church services that's not
[1:32:23] going to do the job amen if all we feed
[1:32:25] is a SC on is a scripture here and a and
[1:32:27] a quote there that's not going to do it
[1:32:29] amen look at our natural relationships
[1:32:32] look at our marriages our marriages
[1:32:34] cannot live on a fleeting touch or a
[1:32:37] smile go try that doesn't work but what
[1:32:41] does it do in our relationships we have
[1:32:44] to have seasons where certainly we're
[1:32:45] giving more and there's situations where
[1:32:47] we're giving less but in the end they've
[1:32:49] got to average out to a continuance a
[1:32:52] constancy of connection
[1:32:55] that keeps us strong so that in the
[1:32:57] moments when we're super
[1:32:59] busy and we can't connect we know he
[1:33:02] loves me or she loves me but how do we
[1:33:05] do that there were times where we have
[1:33:06] an excess of time and so what do we do
[1:33:08] we
[1:33:10] reconnect why to keep the marriage
[1:33:15] strong we can't be super dad Super Mom
[1:33:19] super husband Super Wife all the time
[1:33:22] but if we can be constant
[1:33:24] it'll maintain the marriage it'll
[1:33:25] maintain the family unit and structure
[1:33:28] that's what gives us that Foundation
[1:33:29] amen Paul would say it this way in
[1:33:31] Colossians he says as ye have therefore
[1:33:33] received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk
[1:33:36] ye in him
[1:33:37] rooted what settled founded you you've
[1:33:41] got a foundation you're tied deeply and
[1:33:43] you're built up in him you're maturing
[1:33:45] you're growing in Christ and established
[1:33:48] in the faith you're
[1:33:49] anchored he says as you've been taught
[1:33:52] abounding therein with Thanksgiving that
[1:33:54] abounding is speaking of fruitfulness
[1:33:56] you're rooted you're tied down you're
[1:33:58] growing up you're maturing and now
[1:34:00] what's it doing it's producing fruit he
[1:34:03] says but beware lest any man spoil you
[1:34:06] through philosophy and vain deceit can I
[1:34:08] can I put that into common words talk
[1:34:11] talk talk talk talk and no
[1:34:14] life I'm sure you've met them people
[1:34:17] that can talk your ear off but they
[1:34:19] can't get the
[1:34:20] victory they can't get along with people
[1:34:22] they can't stay in a church Church they
[1:34:24] can't Fellowship all they can do is talk
[1:34:26] talk talk talk talk philosophy and vain
[1:34:31] deceit they have no
[1:34:33] power just a lot of
[1:34:36] understanding through philosophy and
[1:34:38] vain deceit after the traditions of men
[1:34:40] and after the rudiments of the world and
[1:34:43] not after Christ brother BR puts it this
[1:34:45] way he says for Christ indeed is the
[1:34:46] life of the church she has no other
[1:34:51] life without him she is simply a
[1:34:54] religious
[1:34:55] Society a club a meaningless Gathering
[1:34:59] of
[1:35:02] people it's the simple
[1:35:04] truth we are not here just for each
[1:35:08] other we get along because we have the
[1:35:11] spirit of
[1:35:13] Christ otherwise half of us wouldn't be
[1:35:15] friends that's the simple truth you say
[1:35:19] well we would brother John we would but
[1:35:21] listen we don't all have the same
[1:35:22] Hobbies we don't all have the same
[1:35:24] interests your kids may not play the
[1:35:26] sports my kids play you may not do the
[1:35:29] things in your spare time that I do in
[1:35:32] mine but what draws us here is the Same
[1:35:34] Spirit under the same word that's what
[1:35:37] makes us it's Christ in our midst that
[1:35:38] makes us a church otherwise we're just a
[1:35:42] religious Society a club a meaningless
[1:35:45] Gathering of the people as a corpse
[1:35:48] bejweled and dressed is still a corpse
[1:35:51] so the church no matter what her
[1:35:52] programs and her gracious efforts might
[1:35:54] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:35:57] also but with him in her midst with him
[1:36:00] motivating her she becomes to the
[1:36:02] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[1:36:06] of him that filth all in
[1:36:09] all stay close to him he's the life he's
[1:36:14] the inspiration he's the light he's the
[1:36:16] strength he's the power what did Eve how
[1:36:18] did Eve get in trouble she got away from
[1:36:21] the Tree of Life she started talking to
[1:36:23] someone else philosophy and vain
[1:36:28] deceit she started to talking to
[1:36:30] somebody that was beneath her she
[1:36:33] started talking to a
[1:36:36] beast because he can talk he must be
[1:36:38] worth listening to church that's not
[1:36:40] true you've got to judge it amen don't
[1:36:43] ever let a child of this world give you
[1:36:46] advice for your
[1:36:47] life if they cannot give you the full
[1:36:50] word they have nothing to offer you and
[1:36:53] there influence is satanic that's hard
[1:36:56] but it's true Satan gave Eve 99%
[1:37:00] truth One Lie One Lie changed the entire
[1:37:04] course of this world because she
[1:37:06] believed it if your advice does not
[1:37:09] include the word it is
[1:37:14] satanic we're to be led by the
[1:37:18] spirit as we start to wrap this up this
[1:37:20] morning we talk about the fruits of the
[1:37:22] spirit we have all those fruits those
[1:37:23] nine fruits through the spirit and we
[1:37:24] got a lot of homework to do I think
[1:37:26] don't we say Lord I I've had I've had
[1:37:30] situations this week where I could say I
[1:37:32] failed in those areas I got a lot of
[1:37:35] homework to do I got things that God
[1:37:37] needs to change in my life why because
[1:37:39] who is the fruit
[1:37:40] for I preached a whole service on this
[1:37:43] before but I want to touch on it again
[1:37:44] we're talking about this this the the
[1:37:46] beautiful fruit of the attributes of God
[1:37:49] of the Holy Spirit but what's this
[1:37:51] purpose what's what's it it produced for
[1:37:53] is it for because remember the Holy
[1:37:56] Spirit produces them in
[1:37:58] us but not necessarily for
[1:38:02] us remember I have to receive the nature
[1:38:05] of God I've got to receive the benefits
[1:38:07] of God before I can ever give them I
[1:38:10] can't love like God does until I receive
[1:38:12] the love of God I can't have the
[1:38:14] patience and and peace and and
[1:38:15] longsuffering of God unless I've receive
[1:38:17] that Jesus said freely you've received
[1:38:19] freely give I've got to get it before I
[1:38:21] can give it but do I need my own
[1:38:25] fruit well you could say John you need
[1:38:27] patience sure I do I need patience do I
[1:38:29] need love for myself the world teaches a
[1:38:31] lot of self Lov these
[1:38:33] days yes sure I need the love of God so
[1:38:36] we need to let that love of God work in
[1:38:38] us before it can work through US
[1:38:39] absolutely but once it does I'm not
[1:38:42] producing fruit for myself I'm producing
[1:38:44] fruit for everybody else that's the
[1:38:46] purpose of it when a tree produces fruit
[1:38:49] the fruit is not for itself it's for the
[1:38:51] animals that walk by that come and stay
[1:38:53] in its branches it's for the passer by
[1:38:55] the person that comes by and wants to
[1:38:57] eat of the
[1:38:58] fruit the tree what does it do it takes
[1:39:01] the nutrients in the water and that's a
[1:39:04] hidden
[1:39:07] process but out of that hidden process
[1:39:09] come the
[1:39:10] fruits amen and it pushes out those
[1:39:13] fruits for everyone else it's not
[1:39:15] intended for the tree the tree really
[1:39:17] only gets the
[1:39:18] leftovers if if nobody comes and picks
[1:39:21] that tree then that fruit drops off and
[1:39:23] it rots and it gives nutrients back to
[1:39:25] the ground so the tree can take that and
[1:39:27] produce more
[1:39:30] fruit sometimes nobody's picking our
[1:39:33] fruit because we're not letting them get
[1:39:35] near we're trees that can walk if I can
[1:39:37] put it that way aren't we I can choose
[1:39:41] to separate myself from people picking
[1:39:43] my
[1:39:44] fruit and we'll get into why we do that
[1:39:48] but that fruit is the sacrifice of the
[1:39:50] tree it's the nature of the tree to
[1:39:52] produce it but it's a sacrifice because
[1:39:54] it's for others not for itself it's the
[1:39:56] offering of the tree it's meant to
[1:39:58] sustain others not itself amen my
[1:40:01] patience isn't for me my joy isn't for
[1:40:03] me my rest isn't for me my longsuffering
[1:40:05] isn't for me it's for you that's what
[1:40:08] it's meant to do I have Christ that's
[1:40:11] why I don't need what you have
[1:40:12] necessarily I have Christ I've got
[1:40:14] something inside of me that's producing
[1:40:17] what I have need of he's my Joys he's my
[1:40:19] peace he's my rest he's my love love
[1:40:21] he's my longsuffering man He's My All In
[1:40:24] All and it's because I have him that I
[1:40:26] can give what I have to you cuz he's the
[1:40:29] fountain that never runs dry he's the
[1:40:32] the flowing Waters of life amen we're
[1:40:34] planted by those streams of Living Water
[1:40:36] so I don't have to worry about tomorrow
[1:40:38] and whether I'm going to have fruit
[1:40:39] because I've got life inside of me Adam
[1:40:42] kept going back to that tree of life
[1:40:44] brother BR would talk about how in the
[1:40:45] evenings he would come in and he would
[1:40:47] lay down and and and Christ would be
[1:40:49] there and they would lay their heads and
[1:40:50] he would smooth their their their their
[1:40:53] head and their brows and and make make
[1:40:55] them feel so calm and warm and and loved
[1:40:58] and he would say go to sleep now in my
[1:41:00] presence it was a constant reunion and a
[1:41:03] and a relationship with God Amen and
[1:41:05] that's the way it's supposed to be for
[1:41:06] us is we know we have a fountain but
[1:41:09] will we keep drinking from it we know we
[1:41:11] have a source we know we have a strength
[1:41:13] that comes from Beyond us but the
[1:41:15] question is will we drink or will we
[1:41:19] not I don't need my fruit for me I need
[1:41:21] it for you and you need it from
[1:41:26] me puts it this way he says I believe in
[1:41:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:41:31] in speaking in tongues but I think we
[1:41:32] lay too much emphasis on that a man can
[1:41:34] speak with tongues and a woman speak
[1:41:36] with tongues and in her life and his
[1:41:38] life doesn't compare with the what
[1:41:39] tongues you're speaking in then it's the
[1:41:41] wrong tongue because the holy spirit
[1:41:43] will make you act like the Bible it'll
[1:41:45] bring you to the fullness of the stature
[1:41:47] of Christ he says you take a person that
[1:41:50] speaks with tongues with enough temper
[1:41:52] to fight a buzz song and talk about the
[1:41:54] neighbors and everything like that he
[1:41:55] says why you call that the Holy Ghost it
[1:41:57] cannot be no sir the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:01] meekness joy peace longsuffering
[1:42:04] goodness gentleness patience faith it is
[1:42:08] that's it that that's its Essence that's
[1:42:10] its nature he says the Holy Ghost that's
[1:42:12] the fruit of the spirit that the Holy
[1:42:14] Spirit bears in the Church of the Living
[1:42:16] God sweetness and humbleness humility
[1:42:18] love for one another and
[1:42:20] longsuffering if a brother has gone
[1:42:22] wrong just can't just don't don't just
[1:42:25] beat him or something another go after
[1:42:28] him and see if you can get him
[1:42:30] back watch this don't wait for the
[1:42:33] preacher to do it you do it somebody
[1:42:35] else the preacher can't do it all
[1:42:37] neither can the deacons everybody is a
[1:42:39] member of this body of Christ and should
[1:42:41] go after one another and if we have the
[1:42:44] spirit of Christ in us he taught us the
[1:42:46] great Parable they left the 90 and n and
[1:42:49] went after that one that's what we're
[1:42:51] supposed to do but we say oh let them go
[1:42:54] we should never do we never should do
[1:42:57] that we should be gentle forgiving
[1:43:00] longsuffering that's the fruit of the
[1:43:03] spirit but why do we begrudge people
[1:43:07] from eating our fruit I'll pick patience
[1:43:09] or
[1:43:10] longsuffering how many of us want to go
[1:43:13] into situations where people try our
[1:43:15] patience because that's what that's what
[1:43:17] eating our fruit is is it tries it it
[1:43:19] takes it away from us why do we stay out
[1:43:22] of those situations
[1:43:24] why do we stay out of situations where
[1:43:26] somebody always makes us angry because
[1:43:28] we're worried we're running out of
[1:43:31] fruit we're worried that what we have
[1:43:33] will not last the
[1:43:36] encounter we've used up what we had and
[1:43:40] we haven't produced
[1:43:42] anymore the only thing that stops a tree
[1:43:44] from producing is when it stops
[1:43:46] drinking and if we're dry in our
[1:43:49] personal life we have no fruit to help
[1:43:51] our brother and sister or our neighbor
[1:43:54] or our community or our co-workers or
[1:43:56] these different things when we're down
[1:43:58] to that last fruit of patience you've
[1:43:59] always seen that thing that says I've
[1:44:01] only got one nerve left and you're
[1:44:02] getting on
[1:44:03] it that's the way we feel sometimes AR
[1:44:06] doesn't it why because we haven't been
[1:44:10] drinking we haven't been drinking now
[1:44:13] I'm not going to say that as a Believer
[1:44:15] you should go out constantly and put
[1:44:17] yourself in situations for people to eat
[1:44:19] your
[1:44:20] fruit we've got to be led
[1:44:23] we've got to be led but if the leading
[1:44:25] always keeps us home it's not his
[1:44:27] leading somebody's supposed to eat our
[1:44:30] fruit if you can receive that this
[1:44:33] morning somebody needs our fruit so
[1:44:36] we're down to our last fruit of patience
[1:44:37] we're down to our last fruit of meekness
[1:44:39] and if he says that one more time or he
[1:44:40] does that one more time he's going to
[1:44:42] get
[1:44:43] it Moses was the meekest man on Earth
[1:44:46] and Moses had maybe the greatest
[1:44:49] Authority given to a man in the
[1:44:50] scripture aside from Jesus Christ
[1:44:54] everything he did God God would honor
[1:44:57] it Moses spoke and things happened he
[1:45:00] was a meest man on Earth but one day his
[1:45:03] temper let go and what did it do it lost
[1:45:07] him his opportunity to go into the
[1:45:08] promised
[1:45:10] land
[1:45:12] Moses had been pushed too far and he
[1:45:15] took it on himself to take control the
[1:45:17] situation and that's when he caused the
[1:45:19] damage God didn't judge the people for
[1:45:20] that God judged Moses for it
[1:45:23] what is it we've got to go back to that
[1:45:25] tree of life every single day you ever
[1:45:29] notice when you have a lot of money you
[1:45:31] give money really easily you have a lot
[1:45:33] of food you'll have people
[1:45:37] out when we have a lot we give it very
[1:45:41] freely and very easily now some people
[1:45:43] will do that even when they have a
[1:45:45] little and that's the way we ought to be
[1:45:49] is that regardless of what we have we
[1:45:51] give as he leads us to give
[1:45:54] amen but why do we give so easily when
[1:45:57] it's all there because we got no
[1:46:00] worries there's they can't use up my
[1:46:03] money they can't use up my patience they
[1:46:05] can't use up my grace man if we were all
[1:46:09] millionaires we wouldn't have any
[1:46:11] issue with giving money because we got
[1:46:14] tons of money if I made a million bucks
[1:46:16] a year I would I need a million bucks a
[1:46:18] year I could give half of it away and
[1:46:20] still live like a
[1:46:21] king I be right in checks left right in
[1:46:23] center anybody that needed
[1:46:26] it why cuz I've got a lot of
[1:46:31] it question is why don't we have much
[1:46:34] fruit Jesus said I would that you would
[1:46:36] bear much
[1:46:38] fruit brother John I got patience how
[1:46:40] much patience you
[1:46:43] got but when somebody constantly draws
[1:46:45] down our patience what do we do
[1:46:48] eventually we say you know what I'm just
[1:46:51] going to avoid him
[1:46:54] instead of saying what God I really need
[1:46:57] to be in your presence today because
[1:46:59] that brother clearly needs what I've
[1:47:02] got nobody else seems to want to hang
[1:47:04] out with him nobody else wants to seem
[1:47:06] to do that Lord can you fill up my tank
[1:47:09] so I can push out the patience so I can
[1:47:12] push out the grace so I can push out the
[1:47:13] mercy the longsuffering the love
[1:47:16] whatever that might be but instead we
[1:47:18] adjust to the thing that makes life
[1:47:21] easier for us rather than doing the
[1:47:23] harder work of getting into the presence
[1:47:24] of God and getting rejuvenated and
[1:47:27] drinking in more so we can push out more
[1:47:29] we lack so we stop offering rather than
[1:47:32] going to get more so we can offer more
[1:47:34] that's our human nature that's the works
[1:47:36] of the
[1:47:37] flesh these things are a sacrifice it's
[1:47:40] a sacrifice to let somebody keep picking
[1:47:43] your fruit and not give you any of
[1:47:46] theirs listen if I go by and I pick
[1:47:48] something from an apple tree what do I
[1:47:49] give that apple tree nothing I just take
[1:47:51] it and go that's what he's there for
[1:47:55] that's what we are we're there for
[1:47:57] people to eat our
[1:47:59] fruit but it's when they don't let us
[1:48:01] pick theirs that's when we get a little
[1:48:02] bit
[1:48:04] prickly let's be
[1:48:06] honest right
[1:48:09] takers not givers when I was moving into
[1:48:12] pastorship I was I had a number of
[1:48:14] pastors spoke to me and paraphrasing
[1:48:17] they said you'll get 80% of your help
[1:48:19] from 20% of your congregation most are
[1:48:21] takers the rest are giv
[1:48:23] sorry yes most are takers the rest are
[1:48:25] givers by God's grace I don't believe
[1:48:28] that's our church but I have been in
[1:48:30] places where that's it and you have a
[1:48:32] tiny group of people that give and give
[1:48:34] and give and everybody else gets the
[1:48:36] benefit even though there are others
[1:48:37] that could absolutely be doing the work
[1:48:39] and helping out in these different
[1:48:40] things amen that ought not to be as we
[1:48:43] become in as we come into maturity as a
[1:48:45] Believer we ought to be giving more and
[1:48:48] taking from Christ amen we've got a
[1:48:52] place where we can go to develop these
[1:48:53] things it's a real sign of maturity when
[1:48:55] somebody says how can I help not what do
[1:48:58] you have for
[1:49:01] me also falls on us I guess to let
[1:49:03] people know how to
[1:49:05] help sometimes we've got a communication
[1:49:07] problem where there's all sorts of needs
[1:49:08] and we don't talk about it well that's
[1:49:10] how we can get people to help as we let
[1:49:12] them know there's a need and they'll do
[1:49:13] it as we start to
[1:49:15] close he
[1:49:17] says they that are christs have
[1:49:19] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:49:20] and lust this is the hard work remember
[1:49:23] it talked about the works of the flesh
[1:49:25] now here's the work of the Spirit In the
[1:49:27] Flesh it crucifies
[1:49:29] it the affections and the lust this is
[1:49:32] the hard work this is the daily struggle
[1:49:34] is to crucify this flesh because if we
[1:49:36] don't do this then the fruits of the
[1:49:38] spirit are going to get choked
[1:49:40] out he says if we live in the spirit let
[1:49:43] us walk in the spirit let us not and he
[1:49:46] gives us these three admonitions let us
[1:49:48] not be desirous of vain Glory so let us
[1:49:51] not be boastful talking up our gifts or
[1:49:54] contributions let us not provoke one
[1:49:57] another this one means challenging and
[1:50:00] calling each other out for
[1:50:05] shortcomings the scripture says that I
[1:50:08] should confess my fault to you not that
[1:50:11] you should tell it to
[1:50:14] me right this is not the scripture is
[1:50:18] not that of calling out prophets call
[1:50:21] out you got to have thus sayeth the Lord
[1:50:24] to do that and if maybe I'll say it this
[1:50:27] way when you see a gross and glaring
[1:50:31] fault in me come talk to me that's what
[1:50:33] the scripture says and if I see one in
[1:50:35] you I'm supposed to come talk to
[1:50:38] you
[1:50:40] in humility the scripture says lest we
[1:50:44] also go into the same
[1:50:46] thing that's how we deal with
[1:50:48] shortcomings first if we're not willing
[1:50:51] to talk about it with God
[1:50:53] then we don't get to talk about with
[1:50:54] anybody
[1:50:55] else and so we take it to God in prayer
[1:50:58] and we commit it to him but if we can't
[1:51:01] let it go in humility you come talk to
[1:51:04] me or I come talk to you that's it
[1:51:08] nobody else needs to be involved that's
[1:51:10] the way it
[1:51:12] works and then he says let us not be
[1:51:15] envying one another jealousy by way of
[1:51:18] comparison so the fruit remember Adam
[1:51:20] Adam comes to the tree of life and he
[1:51:22] has eternal life he's sustained he's
[1:51:25] rejuvenated he's strengthened day by day
[1:51:27] and from that basis from that Wellspring
[1:51:30] of life he goes out and he gives life to
[1:51:32] everyone else he gives the fruit he
[1:51:34] produce helps the fruit produce he helps
[1:51:36] the ground produce the fruit and these
[1:51:38] different things animals don't have
[1:51:41] Christ they have us to help them in
[1:51:44] their way we're walking around this
[1:51:46] world and guess what we're dealing with
[1:51:47] church animals beasts remember I said
[1:51:51] the last service that a a a a man or a
[1:51:53] person without the Holy Ghost is a beast
[1:51:56] Peter called them brute beasts that's
[1:51:58] what we're dealing with today is brute
[1:52:00] Beast church and they have no access to
[1:52:02] the tree of life and so what they're
[1:52:04] relying on until they get to that tree
[1:52:07] of life is your fruit to keep them going
[1:52:10] day by day that's the only source that
[1:52:13] they have our attitude could determine
[1:52:15] their Eternal destination the prophet of
[1:52:16] God
[1:52:17] said why because until they come to
[1:52:21] Christ all they have is an opportunity
[1:52:23] by
[1:52:24] works to receive eternal life and our
[1:52:28] attitude our reaction our action could
[1:52:30] determine their action and reaction and
[1:52:33] if ours is right then theirs can be
[1:52:36] right and it gives them an
[1:52:39] opportunity remember in that day they
[1:52:40] said he says you know enter
[1:52:43] in he said because when I was hungry you
[1:52:46] fed me when I was naked you clothed me
[1:52:47] and these different things they said 'h
[1:52:48] did we do it he said 'h you did it to
[1:52:49] the least of these my brethren you've
[1:52:51] done it unto me our attitude the fruit
[1:52:55] of the spirit coming out of our life
[1:52:57] gives people that
[1:52:58] opportunity if I'm angry if I'm grumpy
[1:53:02] if I'm short-tempered
[1:53:04] if I'm never out people have no
[1:53:08] opportunity people often won't see
[1:53:10] Christ until they see us they'll see
[1:53:12] religion but they won't see
[1:53:14] Christ Adam had to stay with Christ so
[1:53:17] that he could go out and help feed those
[1:53:18] brute
[1:53:19] beasts amen
[1:53:22] they have to eat your fruit until they
[1:53:24] can come to their own source if I could
[1:53:26] put it that way until they come to
[1:53:28] Christ they're left with the fruit off
[1:53:29] of your tree to sustain their natural
[1:53:31] life to keep them going to let them Live
[1:53:35] Another Day that per chance they could
[1:53:36] come and receive the same word that
[1:53:38] you've
[1:53:39] got that they could actually see there's
[1:53:41] more to life than what they
[1:53:43] have we're the only living testimony In
[1:53:46] This World Church we're the only living
[1:53:49] testimony and if we've got no fruit then
[1:53:51] what kind of testimony are we
[1:53:54] dead
[1:53:56] cold twice plucked up by the roots no
[1:53:59] life in
[1:54:00] us let's finish in the Book of
[1:54:03] Revelation started with the tree of life
[1:54:05] and watch How It Ends in revelation 22
[1:54:07] he says and he showed me a pure River of
[1:54:10] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[1:54:12] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[1:54:14] of the lamb and in the midst of the
[1:54:16] street of it and on either side of the
[1:54:17] tree was there the Tree of Life which
[1:54:20] bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her
[1:54:22] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:54:25] tree were for the healing of the Nations
[1:54:27] and there shall be no more curse but the
[1:54:30] Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be
[1:54:32] in it and his servants Shall Serve him
[1:54:34] even in eternity even in Perfection
[1:54:38] there's still fruit being produced but
[1:54:40] notice here this is not just any tree it
[1:54:43] says it's producing 12 different types
[1:54:45] of fruit and every month it produces a
[1:54:48] different
[1:54:49] fruit and what is it for it's for
[1:54:53] people the fruit is for
[1:54:56] people the fruit that you produce is for
[1:54:58] a person it's not for New Finland it's
[1:55:01] not for Canada it's not for North
[1:55:03] America it's for the people that come
[1:55:05] your way eternal life is not to a
[1:55:09] nation it's never been that way with
[1:55:12] Israel it was never to the nation it was
[1:55:14] to the faith Nation not to the Natural
[1:55:17] Nation but our fruit is for people and
[1:55:19] it's to draw them to Christ it's so that
[1:55:22] they could could see something that
[1:55:23] they've never seen before so what God
[1:55:25] gives us is for a people and up there
[1:55:27] it's for a people it's for eternal life
[1:55:30] up there but notice how we spoke about
[1:55:32] leaves and we said even if you're not at
[1:55:34] the fruit bearing stage a tree with
[1:55:36] leaves still has great benefit it's a
[1:55:38] shade it's a shelter it can protect you
[1:55:40] from the Sun maybe protect you from the
[1:55:42] wind and these different things and up
[1:55:44] there it says the leaves of the tree
[1:55:46] were for the healing of Nations that the
[1:55:48] Kings could come in and they could sit
[1:55:50] under that tree and it would bring peace
[1:55:52] where there was never peace before
[1:55:54] listen Donald Trump thinks he's going to
[1:55:56] bring peace let me tell you he ain't
[1:55:58] bringing
[1:55:59] peace no man can do it no man can do it
[1:56:02] remember what's going to happen is is
[1:56:04] that Satan's going to be incarnate in a
[1:56:05] man and he'll bring peace for six months
[1:56:07] the whole world will be at peace for 6
[1:56:08] months and they think they've got it
[1:56:09] made and then he breaks
[1:56:12] it he cannot do it only God can bring it
[1:56:17] and it's through the tree of life amen
[1:56:21] let's stand together for we would this
[1:56:27] morning it's not I can do it it's not
[1:56:29] you can do it it's going to take Christ
[1:56:32] in you to do
[1:56:33] it I love how brother Braham said he
[1:56:35] says you can't produce that character on
[1:56:38] your own you know what that you know
[1:56:40] what we do when we do that we do an
[1:56:42] impersonation and you know what happens
[1:56:44] to impersonators they're always exposed
[1:56:47] they're always exposed we always see
[1:56:49] what they are in reality and it takes
[1:56:51] time to do that
[1:56:52] but if you got him on the inside then
[1:56:54] what it'll do it'll expose Christ in
[1:56:56] your life and people will be able to see
[1:56:58] that and they'll be able to see a
[1:56:59] difference between you and just a
[1:57:01] religious person you and just somebody
[1:57:02] that goes to church because the fruit of
[1:57:04] your life is something that they can
[1:57:06] taste that they can
[1:57:08] experience that they can come to and you
[1:57:11] don't flashback the way other people do
[1:57:12] and you're understanding and you're
[1:57:14] patient and you listen and you're able
[1:57:17] to give them advice from the word of God
[1:57:18] in these different things that's what
[1:57:21] God's looking for as people
[1:57:22] that can be the word with flesh on it
[1:57:25] that can produce him all over again and
[1:57:28] the thing is it takes a suppressing of
[1:57:30] this flesh and the only way we're going
[1:57:31] to do that is by the holy spirit amen
[1:57:35] remember this is leoa people's rights
[1:57:38] somebody does us wrong we have every
[1:57:41] right every civil every legal
[1:57:45] right to respond as they say and do to
[1:57:48] us but remember we've got the nature of
[1:57:51] a lamb got the nature of a
[1:57:53] dove that when he was riled upon he
[1:57:56] riled not back and he forgave them in
[1:57:59] what they were
[1:58:00] doing that's what people are looking
[1:58:02] for we can talk about the truth we can
[1:58:06] talk about the message of the hour we
[1:58:07] can talk about this age wherein we can
[1:58:09] place ourselves in the scripture but if
[1:58:11] we can't place the scripture in us then
[1:58:12] what are we just
[1:58:15] religious the work of the spirit is what
[1:58:19] he's looking for the fruit out of our
[1:58:21] Lives amen
[1:58:22] let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:58:26] Father lord it's challenging this
[1:58:28] morning no
[1:58:30] doubt Lord I'm challenged by what I'm
[1:58:32] hearing and but I'm what I'm
[1:58:35] reading Lord in heaven knows there's
[1:58:37] many areas in my life that need to be
[1:58:40] strengthened Lord we know the answer
[1:58:43] though is to keep drinking Lord It's to
[1:58:46] stay close to Christ the word the Tree
[1:58:48] of Life Lord It's to feed every day
[1:58:52] it's to stay connected every day Lord
[1:58:55] and it's to have no worry about what
[1:58:57] tomorrow holds Lord we know your
[1:58:59] scripture says sufficient to the day is
[1:59:02] the evil
[1:59:03] thereof lord it's for us to give
[1:59:05] everything we've got every day for your
[1:59:07] service for your kingdom Lord for the
[1:59:09] benefit of those that are around
[1:59:11] us Lord it takes a new heart Lord it
[1:59:15] takes a new mind it takes a new spirit
[1:59:17] to do those things Lord and you said you
[1:59:20] give them those us those things
[1:59:22] Lord you said you'd change us said you'd
[1:59:24] fill us said you Empower us Lord for
[1:59:27] service for your
[1:59:29] kingdom Lord where I fall short Lord I
[1:59:31] pray your
[1:59:32] forgiveness Lord but in that forgiveness
[1:59:35] Lord would you strengthen me Lord would
[1:59:37] you help me to feed on the right things
[1:59:38] day by day Lord not just me but everyone
[1:59:41] that's here Lord we want to be a witness
[1:59:43] for
[1:59:44] you Lord we want to show people a living
