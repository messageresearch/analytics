[59:38] oh my they're just so-called christians
[59:42] and they're saying oh i'm a christian
[59:44] i'm this i'm a believer but again it's
[59:46] like the prophet of god said
[59:48] he said you're in the message but the
[59:49] message is not in
[59:51] you and just think he was challenging
[59:54] his own church
[59:55] with that statement yeah random
[59:58] tabernacle he said you're in the message
[59:59] but the message is not in you
[1:00:01] amen brother he could prove that with
[1:00:04] and he did prove it when he preached
[1:00:06] church order amen
[1:00:08] when when a lot of the people in bradham
[1:00:10] tabernacle they got up
[1:00:11] and they left amen went to another
[1:00:14] church
[1:00:15] brother did they believe him to be the
[1:00:17] prophet
[1:00:18] if it's the prophet is god speaking
[1:00:20] through the prophet amen
[1:00:22] and they'll be subject to it but no they
[1:00:24] just disagree with it
[1:00:25] and moved on amen they got to that place
[1:00:28] where the prophet of god
[1:00:30] even had to stop testimony meetings in
[1:00:33] blatant tabernacle i've told i've told
[1:00:36] a certain pastor that one time i said
[1:00:38] brother you need to stop testimony means
[1:00:40] in this church
[1:00:41] why because the same as it was then so
[1:00:44] it was
[1:00:44] in that church amen there were those
[1:00:46] that get up and testify
[1:00:47] and they go on and on and on and on for
[1:00:50] maybe 45 minutes or an hour
[1:00:52] they were preaching amen oh yeah and not
[1:00:55] only that
[1:00:56] i i got to the place where i had to tell
[1:00:57] the brother that was doing it i said
[1:00:59] brother
[1:00:59] look in in you know out there having
[1:01:02] open air services
[1:01:03] i said please i said don't have
[1:01:05] testimony meeting why
[1:01:07] because even those out there they would
[1:01:08] come up to the microphone during the
[1:01:10] open air service and they would talk and
[1:01:12] talk for maybe 30 minutes
[1:01:13] or 40 minutes oh yeah and this one get
[1:01:16] up and talk this one get up and talk
[1:01:17] and then i would notice again of those
[1:01:20] that had gathered to hear the air
[1:01:21] the the meeting amen oh this one would
[1:01:24] leave that would lead a few more would
[1:01:26] leave
[1:01:26] yeah and i said brother i said stop
[1:01:29] those testimonies
[1:01:30] i said you can you can get somebody to
[1:01:32] read something or give us give a brief
[1:01:34] statement here and there but i said
[1:01:36] don't let them do that
[1:01:38] amen that's not the will of god amen
[1:01:41] sure brother we guess what it is
[1:01:43] important to reflect christ
[1:01:45] amen brother by the grace of god and
[1:01:48] brother for reflecting christ will
[1:01:49] reflect his wisdom amen brother
[1:01:52] you have the wisdom holy ghost wisdom
[1:01:54] that's one of the gifts
[1:01:56] amen and then anything believers need is
[1:01:59] wisdom
[1:02:00] amen and wisdom not just no don't do
[1:02:02] this don't do they don't do this
[1:02:04] sometimes it's wisdom to do this with
[1:02:06] them to do that
[1:02:07] and and again remember just to remind
[1:02:08] you because i had to remind somebody
[1:02:10] just during the last
[1:02:11] two or three days uh not not a believer
[1:02:14] as far as i know
[1:02:15] but to remind them i said well i said i
[1:02:16] just preached on this i said going to
[1:02:18] hell i said not because of what you did
[1:02:21] is what you didn't do oh yeah and
[1:02:24] another brother contacted me oh my
[1:02:25] brother he said
[1:02:26] that's true that's the truth he said i'm
[1:02:28] going to preach on that
[1:02:29] oh yeah and he's in western canada he
[1:02:32] said i'm going to pray china i said well
[1:02:33] praise the lord
[1:02:34] oh brother i've never heard that before
[1:02:35] but but it's right and he said now that
[1:02:37] not only
[1:02:38] just saying it right he said it's
[1:02:39] scripture he said jesus said it
[1:02:42] amen jesus said it and as much you
[1:02:44] didn't do it unto me
[1:02:46] did do it unto the least of these my
[1:02:47] brethren he said you didn't do it to me
[1:02:50] and he said go to hell boy he knew their
[1:02:53] heart he knew their soul he knew their
[1:02:54] spirit
[1:02:55] i'm right see not because of what they
[1:02:58] did
[1:02:58] what they didn't do amen and brother
[1:03:01] make sure what you're
[1:03:02] what you're doing is god's will
[1:03:05] amex don't don't don't be found not
[1:03:08] doing this not doing that
[1:03:09] because may god god wants you to do this
[1:03:11] god wants you as a believer
[1:03:13] as the bride of christ he wants you to
[1:03:14] go and live this kind of life be this
[1:03:16] kind of a believer
[1:03:17] amen and do this so that you're you're
[1:03:19] there instant in season out of season
[1:03:22] to do his will by grace amen
[1:03:25] because if you don't oh i don't i don't
[1:03:27] have to do this
[1:03:28] i don't have to do that or you better
[1:03:30] make sure does god want you to do it
[1:03:33] jesus wants you to do it brother
[1:03:35] whatever jesus is doing
[1:03:36] he's doing it through you and me so
[1:03:39] brother give him control
[1:03:41] amen let god have control
[1:03:45] amen and brother eventually that that
[1:03:47] pastor also
[1:03:48] stopped testimony means he had to
[1:03:51] because even even i've been there
[1:03:55] and i've swatched it and that pastor was
[1:03:57] sitting on the platform
[1:03:59] on a chair there or on a seat and he
[1:04:01] holding his bible
[1:04:02] amen and he wait and wait and wait and
[1:04:05] wait
[1:04:06] yeah or four wait till the testimony
[1:04:08] means over three get up and preach the
[1:04:09] word
[1:04:10] oh yeah and he maybe had to wait three
[1:04:12] hours
[1:04:13] and again it's like like one of the
[1:04:15] brothers i think the
[1:04:16] ministry brother that we had here once
[1:04:18] years ago but i think he's gone on now
[1:04:21] and uh and he got up one time he went he
[1:04:24] also waited
[1:04:25] in a certain church oh and after he got
[1:04:28] up
[1:04:28] he said all right he said i'm going to
[1:04:30] preach as long as i had to wait
[1:04:33] he said i waited i waited and waited for
[1:04:35] you to finish
[1:04:36] for you to stop this stop that now he
[1:04:38] said i'm going to preach the same length
[1:04:39] of time
[1:04:40] he says so as i have patience for you
[1:04:42] you're going to have patience for me
[1:04:44] amen so he said he's going to preach for
[1:04:46] how and i have
[1:04:48] amen so brother just beyond beyond your
[1:04:51] god
[1:04:52] amen so verily verily i say unto you he
[1:04:55] that believeth on me
[1:04:57] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:05:00] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:05:04] because i go to my father amen
[1:05:08] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name

[1:05:12] that will i do that the father
[1:05:15] may be glorified in the son and what is
[1:05:18] asking in his name
[1:05:19] is asking according to the will of god
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] and if ye shall ask anything in my name
[1:05:25] i will do it
[1:05:27] and if you love me keep my commandments
[1:05:30] god bless this word you may be seated
[1:05:33] so i want to share a number of things

[1:07:30] but then you got to go beyond gosh and a
[1:07:32] prophet you know
[1:07:34] what did he do go beyond what god is
[1:07:36] doing not what he did
[1:07:37] god sent the prophet and he did this and
[1:07:39] he did that but what's god now doing the
[1:07:41] prophet is gone
[1:07:42] amen since 1965. so brother and i know
[1:07:47] yes and for years preachers around the
[1:07:50] world
[1:07:50] basically preached god sent a prophet
[1:07:53] god has sent a prophet
[1:07:55] but it was in 1971 or 72
[1:07:59] that's when uh one of the when the
[1:08:00] certain of the brethren
[1:08:02] began to get into what god did through
[1:08:05] the prophet
[1:08:06] amen and he was trying to encourage the
[1:08:08] ministry
[1:08:09] now i said let's move on he said we have
[1:08:11] preached god sent a prophet
[1:08:13] around the world but now he said we need
[1:08:15] to get into what
[1:08:16] what god did through the prophet amen
[1:08:19] and to get into the message he said
[1:08:21] by the grace of god again the problem of
[1:08:23] god said you're in the message but it's
[1:08:25] the message in you
[1:08:26] and again there's still believers around
[1:08:28] the world that are in the message but
[1:08:30] the message is not in them
[1:08:32] because if the message is in you god is
[1:08:35] god is using you to reflect the word
[1:08:37] god's re using you
[1:08:38] to reflect what he's doing amen and god
[1:08:41] is
[1:08:41] in you to give you a hunger and a thirst
[1:08:44] for what he wants to do
[1:08:46] amen so brother we thank god for what he
[1:08:49] did
[1:08:49] and we appreciate what he's doing and
[1:08:52] we're getting more and more into what he
[1:08:53] what he's doing
[1:08:54] in in in maturing us in the word of god
[1:08:58] and hallelujah and to give us the faith
[1:09:00] that that
[1:09:01] that god revealed the seals to give us
[1:09:04] to give us the faith that god sent the
[1:09:06] messenger to give us
[1:09:07] amen brother he sent he said
[1:09:11] he sent luther martin luther to give
[1:09:13] them the faith that he required of them
[1:09:15] in that day
[1:09:16] and he said john wesley to give them the
[1:09:18] faith that that god
[1:09:19] wanted in that hour and of course we
[1:09:21] know that he
[1:09:22] said the pentecostal revival amen to
[1:09:25] give the the pentecostals the faith that
[1:09:27] he was looking for
[1:09:28] a hundred years ago amen in the
[1:09:31] pentecostal revival
[1:09:32] by the grace of god but brother what is
[1:09:35] god looking for now
[1:09:37] but god sent a prophet in the in the
[1:09:39] last days amen
[1:09:41] and brother and again it's not just to
[1:09:42] put us back under pentecost no
[1:09:45] we we believe pentecost we were that's
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:49] it was god and we and we got an
[1:09:51] experience with god amen god justified
[1:09:53] us
[1:09:54] god sanctified us god baptizes with the
[1:09:56] holy ghost
[1:09:57] amen gave us access to to the lord
[1:10:00] access to the gifts amen healing
[1:10:03] salvation and right on right on right on
[1:10:06] but now brother he's increasing our
[1:10:07] faith to believe
[1:10:09] amen not just for the gifts of the
[1:10:11] spirit but to believe for the change of
[1:10:13] our bodies
[1:10:14] amen brother now god's required yes
[1:10:18] brother we're not going to do away with
[1:10:20] what god revealed but where god is
[1:10:22] adding to his word amen multiplying his
[1:10:25] word
[1:10:26] increasing his word and begins with
[1:10:28] faith and he brings it on up till he can
[1:10:30] crown it in your life
[1:10:31] and crown it in my life with the with
[1:10:33] the genuine anointing of divine love
[1:10:36] amen that i love him and he loves me
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:40] that i know who i am praise the lord
[1:10:42] praise the lord he knows who i
[1:10:44] am but it brother through the word he's
[1:10:46] got to give you a revelation of
[1:10:47] to you of who you are amen do you know
[1:10:50] who you
[1:10:51] are amen and brother if you know who you
[1:10:54] are then you know what god's requiring
[1:10:56] of you
[1:10:57] so brother what is god doing now in
[1:11:00] these
[1:11:00] last days but again thank god for what
[1:11:03] he did
[1:11:04] but what's he doing amen where is god
[1:11:06] now
[1:11:07] the prophet is gone and many of the
[1:11:09] messengers there are not messengers of
[1:11:11] many of the the
[1:11:12] brethren that took their stand for the
[1:11:16] word back then
[1:11:17] they're gone and again it was confirming
[1:11:19] what the prophet said to brother level
[1:11:22] that he said the older ones around the
[1:11:23] message he said would not
[1:11:26] be in the rapture then when it comes to
[1:11:29] to live to be in the rapture but he
[1:11:32] still go on
[1:11:33] and they'll be they'll be identified
[1:11:35] with the resurrection amen
[1:11:37] but but i trust by the grace of god that
[1:11:39] we're here to experience the rapture
[1:11:42] amen and brother i tell you this as we
[1:11:44] go on
[1:11:45] in in what into the word and what god
[1:11:48] has revealed
[1:11:49] what god has done it ought to give us
[1:11:51] more and more
[1:11:52] rapturing faith yes pray
[1:11:56] praise the lord and again god is waiting
[1:11:58] on you and god is waiting on me
[1:12:00] what for to get into rapturing faith
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:03] god's looking for that it's not god
[1:12:05] gonna god has already done it
[1:12:07] but now he's looking on our response
[1:12:10] he's looking on our attitude toward what
[1:12:12] he's done
[1:12:13] amen brother it's unfortunate
[1:12:16] that so many years the problem of god
[1:12:18] said it was around three years
[1:12:20] after the after the messenger i guess
[1:12:22] left a scene or after
[1:12:24] yes or after the the revival that they
[1:12:27] went into a denomination
[1:12:28] but three years after god brought the
[1:12:31] the lutheran revival
[1:12:32] brother what happened they went they
[1:12:34] went back into a denomination
[1:12:36] and he said the same thing happened to
[1:12:37] wesley eventually he said they went back
[1:12:39] and organized it
[1:12:40] and became a denomination and brother
[1:12:42] there's many are reading around the
[1:12:44] message
[1:12:45] brother just there's no more no more
[1:12:46] than the denomination
[1:12:48] oh yeah the way they act the way they
[1:12:50] live the way they worship
[1:12:51] and and and they they feel you know
[1:12:54] i'm a believer i'll do this i do that
[1:12:56] well yeah but they're just living for
[1:12:58] what they want to do
[1:12:59] you know when it comes to the natural
[1:13:02] the
[1:13:02] not not the spiritual brother the
[1:13:05] attitude
[1:13:06] of most believers i tell you this the
[1:13:09] the attitude and the anointing that we
[1:13:10] experience first when we come to this
[1:13:12] word
[1:13:12] brother the believers are not into that
[1:13:14] now there's not many believers into that
[1:13:17] anointing
[1:13:18] it's not many believers feel that that
[1:13:20] moving of the spirit of god
[1:13:21] in their hearts amen oh there was it was
[1:13:24] tremendous
[1:13:25] when god gave the the revelation to
[1:13:27] luther it was tremendous when god gave
[1:13:29] the revelation to wesley
[1:13:31] and the pentecostals and was getting
[1:13:33] more and more and more excited
[1:13:35] amen they're getting more and more
[1:13:37] spiritual oh yes
[1:13:39] amen why because they were coming more
[1:13:41] and more into fellowship with god
[1:13:43] amen they're getting more and more into
[1:13:46] a personal relationship with god
[1:13:48] amen god revealed himself and he in
[1:13:51] in luther oh yeah by the grace of god
[1:13:54] he gave ruth of the revelation
[1:13:56] justification then sanctification then
[1:13:58] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:00] and the gifts of the spirit and brother
[1:14:03] as oh yeah
[1:14:04] the more that god began to reveal the
[1:14:06] more the more excited the people begin
[1:14:08] to get
[1:14:09] amen oh yeah i'll tell you this
[1:14:12] when he struck oh yeah even the
[1:14:13] old-fashioned salvation army
[1:14:15] and again as the brother asked me
[1:14:18] in in a certain brother's home in
[1:14:20] ontario and he said brother
[1:14:22] he said brother gerald he said what did
[1:14:24] what did william branham say about the
[1:14:26] salvation army
[1:14:27] and i thought because he was much older
[1:14:29] than i was he's going on now
[1:14:31] and he said did he say anything about
[1:14:33] the salvation army i said yes he did
[1:14:35] and he said well what did he say because
[1:14:38] he was wondering what part
[1:14:39] the salvation army was playing in what
[1:14:41] god had done and what god was doing
[1:14:44] and i well i said he said that he said
[1:14:46] the methodists he said it organized so
[1:14:48] quickly
[1:14:49] he said that god had to raise up william
[1:14:52] booth with red-on
[1:14:54] salvation amen he said to take the
[1:14:57] message on
[1:14:58] he said to the pentecostals amen and
[1:15:01] they did
[1:15:02] brother and and they preached it and
[1:15:03] they preached it and they preached it
[1:15:05] and we
[1:15:05] and we know both brother nearing the end
[1:15:07] of his ministry yeah
[1:15:09] during the end of that revival william
[1:15:11] booth and yes even his wife because she
[1:15:13] preached also
[1:15:14] and they were preaching and and
[1:15:16] exhorting the people
[1:15:18] what that we need this is what they were
[1:15:21] preaching and i've read it and i got
[1:15:22] those sermon
[1:15:23] sermons in in a book form and they said
[1:15:26] listen what what
[1:15:27] what do we need now and william booth
[1:15:29] preached it and his wife preached
[1:15:31] and they said we need now is what they
[1:15:34] had on the day of pentecost
[1:15:36] amen they said we need the anointing of
[1:15:38] the holy ghost
[1:15:39] we need the baptism of the holy ghost so
[1:15:42] they're getting so that god is taking
[1:15:44] more and more and more control
[1:15:46] of us amen they recognize that amen
[1:15:49] they were going on with wesley's message
[1:15:52] but brother as they went on and on and
[1:15:54] on
[1:15:54] and brother and the anointing was there
[1:15:56] and they felt a greater and a greater
[1:15:58] anointing
[1:15:58] in their hearts in their souls amen with
[1:16:01] their message
[1:16:02] amen they went on and they were
[1:16:04] appointing us to pentecost
[1:16:06] he said they they were pointing us to
[1:16:08] pentecost yes
[1:16:09] i said we'll move with preaching it we
[1:16:11] need
[1:16:12] the baptism of the holy ghost we need
[1:16:15] the gifts of the spirit he was preaching
[1:16:16] it

[1:17:15] to the kingdom of god it's the door of

[1:17:21] keep going on looking at the door
[1:17:23] amen and they went off from john from

[1:17:27] and the the old fashioned salvation army
[1:17:29] and on into the pentecost

[1:17:41] pentecost doesn't recognize what god is
[1:17:43] doing amen
[1:17:44] oh yeah the others went on and on and on
[1:17:47] and on they weren't going to fall back
[1:17:48] in into any denomination they were going

[1:30:44] amen oh yeah and he was having prayer
[1:30:47] and he was praying for what god did on
[1:30:49] the day of pentecost

[1:31:02] the baptism of the holy ghost oh yeah
[1:31:05] and
[1:31:06] and i've read proportions where they
[1:31:08] they
[1:31:09] said to that brother and he he would get
[1:31:11] there in the pulpit to pray
[1:31:13] and he'd have he'd have a box a
[1:31:15] cardboard box and he put it over his
[1:31:16] head

[1:31:19] over his head and he started to pray
[1:31:20] amen and nobody was to disturb him
[1:31:23] praying
[1:31:23] honest they wanted to pray with him amen
[1:31:26] and brother it was it was through that
[1:31:28] that hour through that anointing through
[1:31:30] that anger and that thirst
[1:31:32] that god set down the baptism of the
[1:31:34] holy ghost amen
[1:31:36] in our brother through our brother but
[1:31:38] again where where are we now
[1:31:40] amen god wanted that any amen
[1:31:44] and praise the lord the father of god
[1:31:47] said
[1:31:47] he said god always sends the holy ghost

[1:31:52] is it a hunger for what god wants to do
[1:31:56] amen praise the lord and god that god
[1:31:59] has sent the holy ghost ahead created
[1:32:01] luther
[1:32:01] amen a hunger for justification amen
[1:32:05] a hunger for sanctification and wesley a
[1:32:08] hunger for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:10] and gifts of the spirit and pentecost
[1:32:12] amen getting more and more and more
[1:32:15] spiritual
[1:32:15] and coming more and more in contact with
[1:32:18] god
[1:32:19] amen god was dealing with them
[1:32:22] in their hearts and in their souls
[1:32:25] praise the lord
[1:32:27] and yet yes yes back then
[1:32:30] pentecost they believed oh
[1:32:33] concerning what god had done and what
[1:32:36] god was doing
[1:32:37] back there they felt oh this must this
[1:32:40] might be going to take us on to the
[1:32:41] coming of the lord
[1:32:45] some pentecostals believed it not all
[1:32:48] but some did
[1:32:50] amen and the thing that they failed to
[1:32:52] recognize
[1:32:53] was the message amen the messenger and
[1:32:56] the message
[1:32:57] that would give them resurrection and
[1:32:59] rapturing faith
[1:33:01] amen by the grace of god so brother
[1:33:05] is the message giving you resurrection
[1:33:07] and rapturing faith god help us to
[1:33:08] believe
[1:33:09] god god allow us to trust god
[1:33:12] amen that we're not going to get caught
[1:33:14] up with with the devil
[1:33:16] because he wants to get caught up with
[1:33:17] the natural things
[1:33:19] yeah in this world and in your life
[1:33:23] there's too many believers caught up
[1:33:24] with natural but how many are caught up
[1:33:26] with the spiritual
[1:33:28] amen oh you're
[1:33:31] again don't be religious be spiritual
[1:33:37] amen there's too many believers just
[1:33:39] religious
[1:33:40] to go to church some don't go to church
[1:33:43] amen there's a lot of believers feel
[1:33:45] that they don't need a pastor
[1:33:46] they don't need the ministry and so on
[1:33:50] and yet as i i said listen i said
[1:33:53] those people they need to go and listen
[1:33:55] to the the
[1:33:56] questions and answers on the seals why
[1:34:00] because they asked the father of god in
[1:34:01] questions and answers on the seals
[1:34:03] amen does the bride have a ministry
[1:34:07] he said yes she said he said she's at it
[1:34:10] he said since
[1:34:11] since the day of pentecost right on
[1:34:13] through
[1:34:14] and she still got it now he said amen
[1:34:17] what was that he said oh it's just a
[1:34:18] vibe full ministry
[1:34:21] in the bride amen and yet there are
[1:34:24] those that didn't
[1:34:25] deny it feeling that we don't have that
[1:34:27] need a pastor we don't need this we
[1:34:29] don't need that as i said
[1:34:30] brother it struck me when i when i when
[1:34:32] i was in the church and and we all went
[1:34:33] around the altar and knelt down and
[1:34:35] prayed
[1:34:36] and by the uh after after the main part
[1:34:39] of the service was over
[1:34:40] after the you know the sermon was over
[1:34:42] and everybody was getting to praise the
[1:34:44] lord and worship the lord and we come to
[1:34:46] the altar and knelt down to pray
[1:34:48] and others were standing behind us
[1:34:50] aren't just still praying
[1:34:51] amen and yet as i said there was that
[1:34:54] sister that knelt down next to me
[1:34:56] and she started to pray and she said she
[1:34:58] said oh i thank you lord
[1:35:00] for the message amen for bringing us to
[1:35:03] the message and bringing bringing the
[1:35:04] message to us
[1:35:05] amen and and now she said we don't have
[1:35:07] to come under any
[1:35:08] the authority of any man
[1:35:11] i said lord i said please convict her
[1:35:15] i said she needs to come under the
[1:35:16] authority of a ministry
[1:35:18] amen not that i don't not that i was in
[1:35:21] the ministry then that i knew of i
[1:35:22] didn't know
[1:35:23] amen and as i said the first time i
[1:35:26] preached was
[1:35:26] was in that church amen and i was only
[1:35:29] maybe 18 or 19 years old
[1:35:31] and i i don't i don't recall exactly how
[1:35:34] old i was
[1:35:35] but again like i said amen i preached
[1:35:38] and then
[1:35:39] again because why to 45 minutes
[1:35:45] you know you're wishing that now maybe
[1:35:50] no amen well although
[1:35:53] because we all got together in the
[1:35:55] church there and
[1:35:56] because we're going brother cater god
[1:35:59] bless him
[1:36:00] and he was going to show us the films of
[1:36:02] brother branham
[1:36:03] and it was so far back then
[1:36:06] that that the the projector that he was
[1:36:08] using
[1:36:09] of course the films was a big round oh
[1:36:13] that's that's what it was like on the
[1:36:14] machine he was using amen and back then
[1:36:18] not like now back then you had to wait
[1:36:19] till it got dark
[1:36:21] amen when the sun went down and and
[1:36:23] everything got dark
[1:36:24] then we could show the show the film but

[1:36:30] light you would you wouldn't see the
[1:36:31] film like as you should
[1:36:32] amen so that's why the pastor
[1:36:36] said all right he said why well we wait
[1:36:38] for it to get dark
[1:36:39] he said i'm going to ask our brother
[1:36:42] brother geraldo she said from saint

[1:37:26] could see the
[1:37:27] the tears were leaving stains on the
[1:37:29] floor
[1:37:30] and uh but the lord says it was my word
[1:37:34] not not the brother's word amen
[1:37:38] and so on and he confirmed it this way

[1:38:54] faith that
[1:38:55] that is going to fulfill what what he's
[1:38:57] promised in these last days
[1:39:01] what's what's next thing in order well
[1:39:03] they're not going back to luther we're
[1:39:04] not going back wesley
[1:39:06] not going back to the pentecostals and
[1:39:08] you know
[1:39:09] we're not going back to william branham
[1:39:14] he was the prophet and we thank god for
[1:39:16] what he did through him
[1:39:18] amen but then he said he
[1:39:21] he had to go he knew he was going
[1:39:25] oh yeah he he mentioned that on tape
[1:39:28] that he knew he was gone so brother
[1:39:32] why because there's another generation
[1:39:34] rising to believe the word
[1:39:36] for the rapture
[1:39:42] are you going to be so in the spirit
[1:39:45] that when you're walking somewhere
[1:39:47] and and you look and you see
[1:39:50] somebody there and there's somebody that
[1:39:52] came that rose from the dead
[1:39:55] or do we have that kind of faith
[1:39:59] amen do we have that kind of faith to
[1:40:01] believe
[1:40:02] in the resurrection really looking for
[1:40:04] the resurrection
[1:40:06] really experiencing the resurrection if
[1:40:09] sister coffee appeared to you would you
[1:40:10] recognize her
[1:40:13] she'd be young it's like i said a few
[1:40:16] times
[1:40:17] i've been in maybe a shopping mall
[1:40:21] and i saw this person saw that one i
[1:40:23] said who's that
[1:40:25] and i was thinking oh lord that's not
[1:40:28] brother stones was it it's not sister
[1:40:30] sonzo
[1:40:32] no no
[1:40:35] because well if it is it's the prophet
[1:40:38] god said they're going to appear to us
[1:40:40] and we're going to change and go into a
[1:40:42] dimension with them and we're going to
[1:40:44] have fellowship with them
[1:40:46] for for certain we call it time certain
[1:40:48] period
[1:40:49] and so on and then he said alleluia
[1:40:52] then he said we're going to look up and
[1:40:54] there's jesus
[1:40:56] he said in the cloud praise the lord
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:00] please please let's not let's not
[1:41:04] ignore it let's not forget it the
[1:41:06] promise listen
[1:41:08] when it comes to what god promised god's
[1:41:10] done this god's done that god has
[1:41:12] fulfilled this fulfill
[1:41:13] that and right on down to the end we can
[1:41:15] say oh my we're at the end of the bible
[1:41:17] now
[1:41:18] so what's the next thing well we've got
[1:41:21] to recognize
[1:41:22] what god has done for the gentiles and
[1:41:24] that is sending the prophet of god
[1:41:26] and the opening of the word oh yes like
[1:41:29] i said he had those three signs
[1:41:31] and he's the first and the second and
[1:41:34] the third was to get the people to
[1:41:35] believe
[1:41:37] yeah he had the sign in the hand he had
[1:41:40] the discernment
[1:41:41] that god gave him and so on it was god
[1:41:44] with him
[1:41:44] god in him doing it and he had that sign
[1:41:47] in the hand
[1:41:48] then he had the discernment he said what
[1:41:50] was god what why was he given that
[1:41:53] why did he have to do that and that was
[1:41:55] to get their your attention
[1:41:57] and to get you to believe because the
[1:42:00] angel said get
[1:42:01] the people get them to believe
[1:42:04] amen and what was it to believe believe
[1:42:07] the message
[1:42:08] it was to believe what god was doing
[1:42:11] amen is to point them to the
[1:42:13] resurrection the rapture and believe
[1:42:16] god is waiting on us
[1:42:20] to surrender to that faith
[1:42:24] right amen
[1:42:27] he told me to say it that way
[1:42:31] god's waiting on us to surrender to that
[1:42:34] faith
[1:42:34] it's there oh yeah we're not looking for
[1:42:37] it it's there
[1:42:39] it's not looking for us it's there amen
[1:42:43] but he's waiting for us to surren we've
[1:42:45] been oh we believe in the resurrection

[1:43:25] how much where should we be uh conscious
[1:43:28] of what god is doing spiritually
[1:43:31] not in the judgment that all that's a
[1:43:33] part of judgment around the world
[1:43:35] what about the grace of god to the bride
[1:43:37] to get us out
[1:43:40] let's worship him amen and brother
[1:43:43] the more more though the more that those
[1:43:45] things are happening in the world
[1:43:47] and around the world and in this whole
[1:43:48] earth the more that the bride is going
[1:43:50] into glory
[1:43:52] getting closer and closer and closer to
[1:43:54] the reality of the resurrection and the
[1:43:56] rapture
[1:43:56] but
[1:44:00] as i said if the problem of god said
[1:44:03] it's you know there's only going to be
[1:44:04] this number going to resurrection
[1:44:06] going to rapture brother what about hog
[1:44:09] again all the people around the message
[1:44:14] that are going to be left behind
[1:44:19] brother oh well god's done this god done
[1:44:22] that god done it yeah but what
[1:44:23] what have you done and what are you
[1:44:25] doing
[1:44:27] what effect is that having on you is it
[1:44:29] controlling your life
[1:44:30] is it changing the way you think is it
[1:44:32] changing the way you act
[1:44:35] so that you're controlled by by the word
[1:44:37] you're controlled by
[1:44:38] by by the the by the message of the hour
[1:44:40] you're controlled by
[1:44:41] all the promise of god oh yeah see
[1:44:44] god is going to make the word flesh in
[1:44:46] you and if if anything god's
[1:44:48] word that is making flesh in you is is

[1:45:16] why cry speak unfortunately there's
[1:45:19] going to be too many left behind to cry
[1:45:21] because they missed it oh thought to mr

[1:45:27] didn't know it
[1:45:28] what didn't know it after all god did
[1:45:32] and after all god revealed to his elect
[1:45:37] and we and we knew that it was going to
[1:45:39] there was will be a resurrection rapture
[1:45:41] but it was just part of a religion
[1:45:45] it's unfortunate that the message is no
[1:45:48] more than a
[1:45:48] religion to a lot of people they got
[1:45:52] these cree and oh yeah
[1:45:53] as i said now now the different things
[1:45:55] in the message are just
[1:45:57] just creeds boy this message that
[1:46:00] message
[1:46:01] it's just a creed well i believe this i
[1:46:04] believe that
[1:46:05] oh yeah this message there on the seals
[1:46:07] this message of the church ages
[1:46:09] oh yeah to a lot of people it's just a
[1:46:11] doctrine and just
[1:46:12] just the oil a part part of the creed
[1:46:14] that makes of their
[1:46:15] their religion they're denominated
[1:46:20] but i tell you if it it is the holy

[1:47:01] natural things
[1:47:02] than they are with the spiritual

[1:48:00] revelation oh god's not a prophet
[1:48:02] oh yeah he revealed the mysteries

[1:48:17] done is to give us rapturing
[1:48:19] faith amen

[1:48:46] revelation of resurrection
[1:48:47] rapture amen pray the grace of god
[1:48:52] that he'll make it real in us
[1:48:57] what's got more control of you malachi 4

[1:49:01] sent a prophet or is it the message
[1:49:05] and what god has done what god is doing
[1:49:08] amen
[1:49:10] so he said i hope and trust that you
[1:49:13] have had
[1:49:14] a spiritual understanding of what god
[1:49:17] has been trying to get over to the
[1:49:19] church
[1:49:21] without saying it right out
[1:49:26] yeah it's with the prophet
[1:49:31] he's been doing this saying it this way
[1:49:33] doing it that way
[1:49:34] amen but he said yeah god says this but

[1:49:49] amen so he said but being trying to get
[1:49:53] over to the church
[1:49:55] without saying it right out see
[1:49:58] he said we have to say things in such a
[1:50:01] way
[1:50:02] that it might thin down
[1:50:05] it might bring some to go out yeah it
[1:50:07] does
[1:50:09] some to leave some to ponder over
[1:50:13] amen grace
[1:50:16] and he said but that's done purposely
[1:50:19] and it must
[1:50:21] be done that way amen
[1:50:24] and some would say you mean god would
[1:50:26] purposely do a thing like that
[1:50:29] he said he certainly did and he does it
[1:50:32] yet today well when did he say that
[1:50:36] 1964. yeah what was the message
[1:50:40] the unveiling of god
[1:50:44] and it was page 5 paragraph 22
[1:50:48] amen grace to us

[1:50:57] and the storms of life are no
[1:51:00] signs of god's disapproval
[1:51:04] amen neither are bright skies
[1:51:07] and still waters signs of his love and
[1:51:10] approval
[1:51:14] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:51:17] beloved

[1:51:30] does he love us he says yes he loves us
[1:51:35] but how shall we know that he loves us

[1:52:28] i've had experience with jesus i love
[1:52:30] him
[1:52:32] yeah he loves you amen
[1:52:35] you don't love him because he did this
[1:52:37] because he did that
[1:52:38] you love him because it's just you it's
[1:52:39] just the nature amen
[1:52:42] because you're related amen in the new
[1:52:45] birth
[1:52:46] as the prophet preached on you must be
[1:52:48] born again
[1:52:50] amen amen so you're not you're not
[1:52:52] subject to the natural birth
[1:52:55] you've got the nature of your parents
[1:52:57] the nature of your grandparents
[1:52:59] in the natural birth but if you're born
[1:53:01] again you've got the nature of your
[1:53:03] heavenly father
[1:53:04] amen and that's there to control
[1:53:08] the old nature amen some of it it'll
[1:53:12] take away
[1:53:13] and it'll it'll kill it amen but others
[1:53:16] there
[1:53:16] just control it oh yeah so great
[1:53:20] we got to live in the spirit walk in the
[1:53:22] spirit so the spirit is in control
[1:53:25] amen wonderful
[1:53:28] so again he said
[1:53:32] does he love us yes how shall we know
[1:53:35] we shall know because he said so
[1:53:38] amen do we believe god
[1:53:42] see god said this and and the devil
[1:53:46] quoted it
[1:53:47] to eve remember he was the first
[1:53:51] evangelist
[1:53:52] and he said yea god said
[1:53:56] he quoted the word yeah
[1:54:00] but i say unto you
[1:54:03] but you shall not surely die god said
[1:54:08] you shall surely die
[1:54:10] he said but you shall not surely die
[1:54:14] he just put in a word god said you shall
[1:54:16] surely die the devil said you shall not
[1:54:19] amen he wasn't denying the absolute the
[1:54:22] all the word
[1:54:23] no no he wasn't denying what god said he
[1:54:25] was just going to go to get her to think
[1:54:27] different about it
[1:54:28] amen is going to just just get her to
[1:54:31] have a different idea
[1:54:33] oh oh yes yes jeff right oh yes because
[1:54:36] it was so close to the truth
[1:54:38] she believed it she believed it
[1:54:42] and there's believers today brother god
[1:54:44] said this god said that got you oh my
[1:54:46] the lord wants to do this the lord wants
[1:54:48] to do that in their life but they must
[1:54:50] want to
[1:54:51] just relax a little and do this do that
[1:54:53] and something else
[1:54:54] family friends neighbors no no stay with
[1:54:57] the word
[1:54:58] amen stay as separated as god wants you
[1:55:01] to stay separated
[1:55:04] yeah oh yes
[1:55:08] and and there's there's not many that
[1:55:09] are willing to let go and let god have
[1:55:11] that way
[1:55:12] they don't want to do this they want to
[1:55:13] do that and sometimes that's where god
[1:55:15] is testing you your faith amen
[1:55:19] so how extremity does god want you to be
[1:55:23] amen so god help us see again that's
[1:55:26] like family and i know that hurts a lot
[1:55:28] of people
[1:55:29] when it comes to separation from natural
[1:55:31] family
[1:55:33] but like brother branham said to his
[1:55:36] brothers
[1:55:37] his natural sibling brothers after after
[1:55:40] after their mother died
[1:55:42] yeah and he said oh
[1:55:45] he said okay
[1:55:48] he said we want we won't see one another
[1:55:50] now
[1:55:51] as much as we did he said we would see
[1:55:54] one another
[1:55:55] coming back to visit mom but she's gone
[1:55:58] so he said he says we won't see each
[1:56:01] other very much
[1:56:03] why because they never read anything in
[1:56:06] common
[1:56:07] that would draw them together yeah
[1:56:11] to god be the glory amen
[1:56:16] so brother what what what kind of a
[1:56:19] separation are you willing to take
[1:56:22] what kind of separation are you willing
[1:56:23] to endure
[1:56:26] grace to us now be careful
[1:56:31] you got to control it don't let the
[1:56:32] devil control it
[1:56:35] yeah you got to keep it on your guard
[1:56:38] amen
[1:56:39] what is the will of god
[1:56:43] yeah well there's times when god with
[1:56:45] god to separate you from this
[1:56:46] this relative and he he wouldn't have
[1:56:49] you do anything with that one
[1:56:51] and there's others maybe the lord will
[1:56:52] allow you to just have fellowship with
[1:56:54] that one
[1:56:55] because that one got a right spirit and
[1:56:57] right attitude oh yeah
[1:56:59] if they got the right spirit right at
[1:57:00] you the lord will allow you a lot of
[1:57:02] that fellowship
[1:57:03] but it's radically not right the
[1:57:04] spirit's not right now yeah
[1:57:07] so god help us brother let jesus
[1:57:10] control you let jesus lead
[1:57:14] amen amen just do what the lord wants
[1:57:17] you to do
[1:57:18] just and keep your spirit right and keep
[1:57:21] your attitude right by the grace of god
[1:57:23] amen
[1:57:27] yeah because uh i know that my
[1:57:30] natural parents one time did
[1:57:33] strike me because they said oh because
[1:57:38] when we go when we went out to that area
[1:57:39] we'd always go down to brother and
[1:57:41] sister barnes
[1:57:42] and we did occasionally drop in to see
[1:57:45] my natural parents
[1:57:47] you know and just to say hello or
[1:57:48] something you know and
[1:57:50] but once one time we met there and they
[1:57:52] they really
[1:57:53] blasted me you know oh
[1:57:56] you you come and you always bypass
[1:57:59] us and you go down there and uh
[1:58:03] to to that house yeah because we were
[1:58:06] there for fellowship
[1:58:07] but we again there's a number of times
[1:58:09] we'd always drop in to
[1:58:11] to greet my natural parents and say
[1:58:13] hello to them
[1:58:14] well thank the lord because that we
[1:58:17] still manifested the right attitude
[1:58:19] because
[1:58:20] they even in in their house and in their
[1:58:22] living room
[1:58:24] they had the pictures they had pictures
[1:58:26] of brother branham and the pillow fire
[1:58:28] on the wall yeah they had two or three
[1:58:32] of those pictures
[1:58:33] and another time i went in there and i
[1:58:34] was looking around oh
[1:58:36] and i noticed that they had some message
[1:58:38] books
[1:58:39] and i don't know if i gave them to give
[1:58:41] the book message books to them or not
[1:58:43] oh yeah and in the library there was the
[1:58:44] message books yeah
[1:58:47] and they were marked yeah so i said
[1:58:50] amazing
[1:58:51] so brother you got to be led by the
[1:58:53] spirit
[1:58:55] amen so but again like i said that
[1:58:58] doesn't bother me if they they didn't
[1:59:01] like this or didn't like that and i just
[1:59:02] leave that with the lord
[1:59:04] and pray for them oh yeah you pray for
[1:59:06] them
[1:59:07] amen so brother
[1:59:11] jesus brought us to himself and gave us
[1:59:14] of his spirit
[1:59:15] amen remember he said the cloudy skies
[1:59:19] and the storms of life are no signs of
[1:59:23] god's disapproval
[1:59:25] and he said neither are bright skies and
[1:59:28] still waters
[1:59:29] signs of his love and approval no
[1:59:33] everything going for everything looks
[1:59:34] good so god of god's approving what i'm
[1:59:36] doing
[1:59:36] no that doesn't mean that
[1:59:40] and he says his approval of any of us is
[1:59:43] only
[1:59:43] in the beloved he said his love
[1:59:46] is elective which he had for us before
[1:59:49] the foundation of the world
[1:59:51] does he love us yes
[1:59:54] how shall we know and he said we shall
[1:59:57] know
[1:59:58] because he said so and manifested that
[2:00:01] he did love us
[2:00:02] for he brought us to himself and he gave
[2:00:06] us
[2:00:06] of his spirit amen placing us
[2:00:09] as sons how shall i prove my love to him
[2:00:13] by believing what he said and by
[2:00:16] conducting myself with joy
[2:00:19] amidst the trials that he in his wisdom
[2:00:22] allows to come to pass in your life
[2:00:26] amen that's god's approval
[2:00:29] well we think oh if god's god's god's
[2:00:32] approval everything's going to go good
[2:00:34] everything's going to be nice
[2:00:35] everything's going to be
[2:00:36] he's going to let this work out no no no
[2:00:38] no god doesn't necessarily do that
[2:00:42] no as the prophet of god said you know
[2:00:45] there's just time from
[2:00:47] the cloudy skies and storms of life it
[2:00:49] says are no
[2:00:51] signs of god's disapproval no
[2:00:54] and neither are bright skies and still
[2:00:57] waters
[2:00:57] signs of his approval no because
[2:01:00] sometimes god allows us to go through
[2:01:02] the rough times
[2:01:03] to bring out our faith and to keep our
[2:01:06] faith strong give us
[2:01:08] you know strength in our faith amen
[2:01:12] he's trying us testing us and making us
[2:01:14] a witness
[2:01:17] to family friends and neighbors the
[2:01:19] grace of god
[2:01:21] so brother grace brother i tell you this
[2:01:24] we must be born again to bring out the
[2:01:27] life that god's looking for
[2:01:29] requires a new birth by the grace of god
[2:01:33] amen my
[2:01:37] sorry it takes so long
[2:01:41] it'd be before coming to a close here
[2:01:48] we're born again by by the grace of god
[2:01:52] to bring us to a living faith not a dead
[2:01:56] letter but a living faith
[2:01:58] amen representing the kingdom of god
[2:02:02] amen not representing the natural things
[2:02:05] of this whole world
[2:02:06] but representing the eternal by the
[2:02:08] grace of god

[2:03:06] and like i said he was a few months here

[2:03:10] and he apparently i'm not sure the exact
[2:03:12] time but he was
[2:03:13] he's still open to get back here again
[2:03:16] even again this year so he says
[2:03:20] so we're going to keep praying for our

[2:03:49] on sunday he says thank the lord amen
[2:03:53] oh he was he was he was i guess in a
[2:03:56] sense i said lord if he's here he said
[2:03:58] he'd be jumping up and down
[2:04:00] you know because he was that happy
[2:04:04] sounded that happy on the phone so he
[2:04:06] shared
[2:04:07] these three quotes of the prophet
[2:04:10] on the subject of prayer
[2:04:14] and he said prayer in the message
[2:04:17] expectation
[2:04:18] 1961. he said prayer is the most
[2:04:22] powerful weapon that ever was put
[2:04:25] in the control of human beings yeah
[2:04:29] prayer why because it's
[2:04:32] it's coming into a real contact with
[2:04:34] jesus
[2:04:36] and he said there is listen he said
[2:04:38] there is no
[2:04:39] atomic bomb and no hydrogen bomb
[2:04:43] as powerful as prayer
[2:04:46] your prayers can accomplish more than
[2:04:49] the bombs
[2:04:50] amen and he said prayer
[2:04:54] will change the mind of god did you know
[2:04:57] that
[2:04:58] he said it did ethan in the scriptures
[2:05:04] and in the message my angel shall go
[2:05:07] before thee
[2:05:08] 1953.
[2:05:11] he said now he said he gave us the
[2:05:14] strongest
[2:05:15] weapon that there is in all the world
[2:05:19] and that weapon he said his prayer
[2:05:22] amen prayer is what changes things
[2:05:27] he said the christian doesn't realize
[2:05:28] what a force
[2:05:30] he has when he kneels on his knees
[2:05:32] before almighty
[2:05:34] god in the name of jesus christ
[2:05:39] and he said he doesn't realize what
[2:05:41] power
[2:05:42] that is and brother oh my
[2:05:45] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05:47] through prayer we've been put out given
[2:05:49] access to such
[2:05:50] power such anointing amen
[2:05:53] no wonder that god has given us the
[2:05:55] power over all the power of the world
[2:05:58] over the world the flesh and the devil
[2:06:01] yeah who's controlling you
[2:06:06] the world the nature of the world
[2:06:11] or is it your flesh or is it the devil
[2:06:16] grace
[2:06:19] and he said again 1961 in the message of
[2:06:22] greater than solomon is here
[2:06:26] now he said we want you to remember that
[2:06:29] prayer
[2:06:30] is the most mighty force that there is
[2:06:32] in the world
[2:06:35] prayer even changes the mind of god
[2:06:38] he said how many know that he said
[2:06:40] that's right god told a prophet one day
[2:06:43] go up and tell a king hezekiah
[2:06:46] say go tell him to set his house in
[2:06:48] order
[2:06:49] because he's going to die
[2:06:52] but lived if he set his house in order
[2:06:56] amen god's looking for obedience
[2:06:59] by the grace of god amen shall the lord
[2:07:02] help us of my prayer
[2:07:04] brother grace
[2:07:08] in the name of jesus
[2:07:14] we'll get to the maybe the lord willing
[2:07:15] we'll try to get to him you must be born
[2:07:17] again on wednesday or on sunday
[2:07:21] and uh after sunday we're hoping to get
[2:07:24] our brother jonathan
[2:07:26] to minister again by the grace of god
[2:07:30] amen so be in prayer
[2:07:35] in the message perfect faith brother
[2:07:38] brown said jesus lived in a world that
[2:07:40] no one knowed about
[2:07:42] he was an odd person are you odd
[2:07:46] to the world
[2:07:50] and he lived in a world of perfect faith
[2:07:53] in the perfect god and it says if we
[2:07:57] lived
[2:07:57] in a perfect faith of a christian to
[2:08:00] what we are
[2:08:01] we'd be a mystic to the world and that's
[2:08:03] true
[2:08:05] the people wouldn't understand you you'd
[2:08:07] walk in the spirit
[2:08:09] and what the spirit said you would do
[2:08:11] what it forbid
[2:08:12] you'd not do and then the people begin
[2:08:15] to save
[2:08:16] and you'll be a mystic person to them
[2:08:19] he said that's the way it is to all
[2:08:21] believers they are
[2:08:22] mystics and the people that don't
[2:08:25] understand
[2:08:26] because they live in a world to
[2:08:28] themselves and he said jesus lived in a
[2:08:30] world that nobody
[2:08:32] else could touch the disciples couldn't
[2:08:34] understand him
[2:08:35] and when he spoke to them they say this
[2:08:38] and then
[2:08:38] they said why you talking riddles
[2:08:42] we don't understand this how can this be
[2:08:44] see
[2:08:45] there wasn't in the world that he lived
[2:08:47] in and they couldn't understand him
[2:08:50] nobody could understand him amen
[2:08:53] and brother if we are living christ
[2:08:55] living in us
[2:08:56] the world don't understand us why do we
[2:08:59] do this why we leave that out why we're
[2:09:00] going to do this why we're going to act
[2:09:02] this way say this or whatever
[2:09:04] yeah brother they don't understand the
[2:09:06] total separation
[2:09:09] from unbelief
[2:09:12] grace to us so he said when a man lives
[2:09:17] by faith
[2:09:18] and walks by faith i mean substance
[2:09:21] faith he is isolated from the entire
[2:09:24] world
[2:09:25] and becomes a new creature in christ
[2:09:28] he said there now you're getting into
[2:09:31] bright material
[2:09:32] and you're getting into a rapturing
[2:09:35] condition
[2:09:36] amen so are we in dried material
[2:09:40] and a rapturing condition by the way we
[2:09:42] live
[2:09:43] act and talk amen and react
[2:09:48] what's it reflecting is it reflecting
[2:09:50] your old nature your new nature
[2:09:52] is it reflecting all just time or is
[2:09:55] reflecting our faith in eternity
[2:09:57] grace amen
[2:10:00] you walk by faith getting into a
[2:10:03] rapturing condition
[2:10:04] bright material amen
[2:10:09] he said that means for each of us not
[2:10:11] just the pastor
[2:10:12] not just the deacons trustees that means
[2:10:15] for the laity
[2:10:16] every individual walks in a world with
[2:10:19] god alone
[2:10:20] and you're baptized into this kingdom
[2:10:22] and there's nobody
[2:10:24] he said in there but you and god amen
[2:10:28] god's dealing with you god's leading you
[2:10:31] amen god's encouraging you amen
[2:10:35] again it's not you that lives is christ
[2:10:37] that liveth in you
[2:10:39] i pray this grace for our young people
[2:10:42] amen
[2:10:43] that you have the experience that you're
[2:10:45] living for jesus
[2:10:48] and jesus has lived for you amen
[2:10:51] and he's sharing his life with you and
[2:10:54] in you
[2:10:55] oh praise god grace in the name of jesus
[2:11:00] yeah even to our young brothers and
[2:11:02] sisters here
[2:11:03] as i said i was very very young and
[2:11:07] and i look back and see things that
[2:11:08] happened that was even a mystery to me
[2:11:11] but i go back with that revelation that
[2:11:14] it was god with me god in me
[2:11:16] and he was using me and i i didn't know
[2:11:19] that that
[2:11:20] they that you know even family or
[2:11:24] friends and neighbors
[2:11:25] thought this about gerald lush you
[2:11:26] thought that about you know
[2:11:28] and i i didn't consider myself to be
[2:11:30] religious
[2:11:31] or spiritual not back then not when i
[2:11:34] was that young you know
[2:11:36] but they did and that's why they tested
[2:11:38] me and they were tempting me
[2:11:39] you know like i said the one time they
[2:11:41] were trying to get cheryl lost
[2:11:43] to swear you know and they they're kind
[2:11:46] of
[2:11:46] gerald yeah say this
[2:11:50] what say that no
[2:11:53] what am i going to say that for it was a
[2:11:55] swear word
[2:11:57] and and just my friends you know my age
[2:11:59] or a little older than me and
[2:12:01] oh because apparently they knew that i
[2:12:04] would seem to see like they knew
[2:12:05] something about me that i didn't know
[2:12:07] and i i didn't think about that young
[2:12:10] and the same thing again as i said when
[2:12:15] my uncle died and my mother's brother
[2:12:19] and
[2:12:19] oh she was really upset and all down and
[2:12:21] out because of it
[2:12:22] and so they didn't know what to do and
[2:12:24] and when they got the flowers for him
[2:12:27] and to take up to see him and
[2:12:31] that's when the were saying oh
[2:12:35] uh gerald they said
[2:12:38] would you write something on a note just
[2:12:41] a note and write something so that we
[2:12:42] can attach to the flowers
[2:12:45] and i said oh okay you know
[2:12:48] i didn't uh not that i said that i
[2:12:51] didn't think well i said why in the
[2:12:52] world did they ask me
[2:12:54] so then why didn't my mother do it why
[2:12:56] didn't my father do it
[2:12:57] so on now so anyway i went and did it oh
[2:12:59] they said good good
[2:13:01] so they went and took it and attached it
[2:13:02] to the flower so
[2:13:04] again it was it's god it's christ
[2:13:08] so he's with you as he was with me and
[2:13:11] he as he is with me he was with you
[2:13:13] amen of course again i didn't know that
[2:13:16] i was
[2:13:17] being going to be called to preach to
[2:13:19] pastor
[2:13:20] because sister byron said brother
[2:13:23] because she said
[2:13:25] when they come to the message i'll tell
[2:13:27] you there was a there was another sister
[2:13:29] in control of the of the cottage
[2:13:30] meetings
[2:13:31] and she basically that sister basically
[2:13:34] preached and did this
[2:13:35] controlled everything and finally when
[2:13:37] they come to the message they said oh
[2:13:40] well we've got to get a brother
[2:13:44] and so they contacted me and said
[2:13:45] brother we want you to take control
[2:13:47] of the cottage meetings i said oh no
[2:13:51] i don't want to do that i said let
[2:13:54] brother burns do it and i said or this
[2:13:57] other brother

[2:13:59] than i am they said no
[2:14:01] no no they said we want you to do it
[2:14:04] i said no i don't want to do it. they
[2:14:07] said we feel that you are called to do
[2:14:08] it brother
[2:14:10] and i said oh i'm not called to preach
[2:14:12] she said yes you are

[2:14:18] occasionally in a college meeting and
[2:14:20] there's a little fellowship with them
[2:14:21] here and there
[2:14:22] they said no brother we feel that we
[2:14:24] thank the lord for that amen
[2:14:26] so we i we had to have a meeting and the
[2:14:29] sister pulled back
[2:14:30] for me to move in to to control the
[2:14:33] cottage meetings

[2:15:02] amen praise the name of the lord to god
[2:15:05] be the glory
[2:15:06] i never thought about that when he was
[2:15:07] just the two-year-old
[2:15:10] it's hard to believe that he was two
[2:15:13] years old sitting in academy
[2:15:15] on a chair yeah but again he had the
[2:15:18] respect
[2:15:20] amen and as i said he kept he kept
