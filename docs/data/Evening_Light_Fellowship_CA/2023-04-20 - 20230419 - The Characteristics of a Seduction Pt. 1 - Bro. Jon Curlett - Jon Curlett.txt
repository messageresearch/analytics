the same way we've come in Lord but we want to be lifted to a higher plane Lord a higher Revelation Lord a higher plane of Victory Lord a higher Dimension Lord where there's more of you and less of us Lord God so Lord I'm asking you once again to speak to your people this evening Lord that you would Minister into our lives Lord that you would touch the hearts and souls Lord that Lord you would speak to things that have I have no idea of even Lord God Lord but that you discern the thoughts and intents of the hearts Lord Lord and that your Holy Spirit would have free reign amongst us we pray Lord remembering especially again brother stride in the hospital Lord praying your grace to him Lord praying for sister Betty also not here brother Gerald Lord pray in your ministry and power your healing touch to them we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it thank you musicians that'll be it I meant turn if you would in your scriptures to Second Corinthians chapter 11 I'm still not anywhere close to 100 percent of the sickness has really been dragging on me and my Energy's not there my sleep's not there yet so certainly covet your prayers my voice isn't a hundred percent either but I'm good enough to preach amen so so I appreciate that amen it's good to be back here I certainly appreciate the confidence of the vote of the church and the pastorship and I talked to my dad and and he said he was going to wear the black armband of mourning for me not because he disagrees with what I'm doing or what I believe but he knows the burden that comes with it and he knows the sacrifice and the responsibility and how that can weigh on a man and I talked to Mom and she said I'll be praying for you and congratulations at the same time so brother John Andy said the same thing so it is a big responsibility amen it's it's not just me that gets called into this my wife gets called into it and my family pays a price for it as well and so we appreciate your grace amen I'm not perfect I won't be perfect I'll make mistakes but trust that you'll see my heart and it all in when I trip up and when I fail then you'll grant me Grace for that and and that the Lord would give me Grace in your sight that he'd be able to use me for your benefit amen amen God bless you there's no other place I'd rather be amen I was telling my wife I said and one of the deacons I said there's no other place I'd rather be I trust the hearts of the people I trust the experience of the people here you have to be a hearty Christian to live in Newfoundland because we don't get all the people rolling through we don't have big churches and tons of friends so guess what we got to make do with each other no matter what and through the years we've not just made do but we've learned to come to love and appreciate one another amen and I believe that's a legacy that we want to keep going on the scripture says that by your loved one for another all men will know you amen so that's what we want in our midst is certainly the love of Christ amen second Corinthians chapter 11 we're taking a different direction I'm going in a in a different way for the next few services second Corinthians 11 verse 1 says wood to God you would bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I Fearless by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for of he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another Spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him amen God bless you you can take your seats this evening amen and I I listen this this little mini series it's going to be maybe two maybe three services Lord knows I certainly got notes enough for one more maybe two more services but this has been laying on my heart for quite a while and I talked to my wife about it as I often do about just things that are going and Weighing on my heart and I said I'm going to preach on seduction and she she gave me the startled look that sister Maureen just gave me and I said no it's not on you know that that's that's that's the the modern world you know as everything is is centralized in these different things but I said we I want to preach on the seduction of the Bride because that's what Satan is trying to doing and so trying to do and so I want to take a series uh just a like I said two or three services maybe on the characteristics of a seduction amen and and I I just want to to maybe say that this is more of a public awareness campaign you know this is something that we need to be aware of is that Satan is is coming in and his approach is a seduction it is not obvious it is not always uh the angle that we're expecting in these things and if we're not on guard against seduction we're easily seduced we'll find Eve if you remember as it was was the first one that was seduced and I believe a great deal of that was because she wasn't aware that it was possible to even be seduced she didn't know that there was somebody out there that might have a a different idea or a different purpose or a different motive in their conversation or fellowship with her and she fell for it so if that's what Satan did with the first Eve then believe me he's going to be trying to do the same thing with the seconde he's going to be trying to seduce the bride amen and Satan is not obvious and I say that because so often what happens is we go through life and nothing seems to be happening bad and we think we're doing well and sometimes that's the greatest uh the greatest thing that will alert you that maybe something is happening that you need to stop and take a closer look because Satan is Relentless in his attacks he's just not always obvious so if we're not realizing we're under attack chances are he's gotten one over on us at least a little bit in our life and he's wormed something in that we weren't expecting and then he's had two thousand or six thousand years of practice in terms of humanity as we know it and he's been doing it for a long time and the best of us have 70 to 75 years of resisting him so it's something we want to be aware of is that we are not always we're not a people that engages in seduction and so it means that we often don't recognize it when it hits our path but if we go back to our opening scripture and Paul says I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ meaning you've never been touched by another man you've never been embraced by another man you've never been intimate with another man he says I'm trying to take you to Christ in a way that is pure and I want you to arrive to your destination pure and untouched because he knows by history that Eve did not come back to her husband untouched he says but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so the seduction of Eve's body started with her mind if he could get her mind to accept his seduction then he could have access to her body and Paul is saying that in this day I'm worried that the church the bride of Christ is going to be seduced in the exact same way that Eve was and should be found with child not of God that shall have a life inside of her that is not a holy life that is not by the Holy Spirit and brother Branham talked about this beguiling hundreds and hundreds of times in the in the message and and when we took that word beguiling back to the original Greek it says it's to seduce holy w-h-o-l-l-y not in a holy way but completely to completely seduce to deceive or to manipulate or to create a false illusion by way of deception so this is not something that's going to be obvious and then he says he beguiled her he seduced her completely through subtlety and that means through craftiness through cunning through false wisdom so when I say Satan is tricky and not obvious I'm just repeating what Paul is saying and that's that if he's not obvious that means that you're going to have to be on the lookout for him because he's not going to hit you from the front Satan does not come in with blunt force he's not a big bully in that way many times and and so often we look at the things that go on in in our life and we think the things of the world and the Temptations of the world that Satan trying to seduce us and it is in a way but those are the obvious ones and we're well taught enough that we ought to be able to turn those things down because they're obviously not of the word they're not obviously they're obviously not of God but when we look at this the scene between Eve and the serpent we see that the seduction of an eve was subject was it was centered around the word of God so that he the Eve's approach from the serpent the way he took her on was he approached her through the word he approached her through the promises of God he approached her through the guidance of God and from there he applied slow and gentle pressure to get her to the place where she would believe a lie that was 180 degrees from what God had told her she went from thou shall not to Thou shalt and that didn't happen over time and we're not told in scripture how long that is but her commission was to be fruitful and multiply and I you'll have to bear with me this evening because this is this is me speaking it's the scripture is silent but I believe that what happened was Eve started to get tired of waiting that God had told her to do something that God had told her to bring forth life and nothing was happening no matter how hard she believed how faithful she was yet nothing was changing and so when another voice came her way that seemed to have some input on how to be fruitful and multiply something turned her ear just for a moment and she was willing to listen to a different voice a different opinion a different message than that which she first received something Twisted her something changed her and it was Satan coming in under the false pretense of helping her to do what Manifesto produced the word of God in her life that's how tricky he is he came in trying to help her in her Christian walk we could say trying to help her produce or be what God said she was supposed to be be but we know that this took a while because God doesn't just walk out of our lives that way and we don't just go into a backslidden conditioner we don't go into a fallen condition just at the drop of a hat but in the end Satan's seduction was so complete that he convinced her that her best course of action was completely contrary to the word of God that's how effective Satan is as he will get you to say no where God said yes and he'll get you to say yes where God said no if we're not careful in these things listen that doesn't happen overnight it doesn't happen overnight this is the process of days and hours and weeks and these different things because Satan has nothing but time his only goal is to get us off the word and so he's patient and he's Relentless and all he's looking for is a little bit of ground every day in our lives the prophet of God would say this he said Satan is the best of that there is for he is deceived Eve by that way saying them same things and the biggest lie was ever told had a lot of Truth in it and that's the way Satan approaches us is he'll get us close to what the word says but he won't give us the full word he'll give us three quarters of it but he won't give us the full thing brother Brian would say in knowing this that Satan is making his last punch at the church he'll never be able to do it after this age she'll be safely under the wing of her lover after this time and where he realized that he's impersonating in the way of religion so that means he's going to take a word based approach it just won't be the full word he says he's doing all kinds of things and the Bible said he'd be like a roaring lion devouring what he would he'd be so shrewd and cunning that he would deceive the very left if possible and then he repeats if possible we ought to take hope tonight that it's not possible for him to fully deceive the bride amen because by Grace God has said we're going to make it by Grace he said we'll be spotless we'll be pure we'll be a virgin bride to him but that doesn't stop Satan from trying he says but oh Lord Thou Art the protection of those who flee to thy bosom for a refuge amen there is a place to go when Satan comes in amen and it is to the lover that we have it is to our husband it is to our headship amen but listen what he's saying there he's saying that he's impersonating in the way of religion that's why I say it's not that Satan won't tempt our young people and even our middle-aged people with careers and with with entertainment and with money and with popularity and all of these different things influence and whatnot he's going to do that but by God's grace I believe we're well taught enough to recognize those almost immediately we ought to be able to recognize when it's something of the world and something that's of God up front when those things so we ought to be able to make the right call on those things but when we start talking now about a religious seduction about a religious deceit about coming from a religious Angle now we've got to be really careful we've got to know what the word says about every aspect of our life there is nothing in our lives that can't be reflected in the word of God and so we've all we've got to be able to bring it back to the word every single time in our decisions in our lives and our priorities and how we respond to things we've got to come back to the word because otherwise Satan will take an angle that gets us to tie the word Plus and that's his seduction is the word Plus brother Branham says Satan is not some big brute with a forked tail and forked hoofs he's a spirit and the Bible said he's so cunning that he would deceive the very elected if possible he is religious he's religious that means he can be in our midst and you not necessarily recognize him right away that means he can be in your life and you not recognize him immediately listen we look at Eve's motive we look at what brought Eve to the place where she would even listen to The Serpent and I believe Eve's motive was good to be fruitful and multiply to get to the place that God had told her to get and to get to the place where God could say Well done you did what I asked you to do you fulfilled the word and you stayed obedient to me I believe she had a great motive amen what turned her away we don't know but all I can say is something turned her away and she decided that there might be a different route and something got a hold of her ear and she got away from her headship she got away from her first love she got away from her husband she got away from her protection and when she did that now she was open to anybody who walked across her path listen all she needed was just a moment away and that serpent had a chance to have a talk with her and listen we may walk away from fellowship we may walk away from church we may walk away from the word once and nothing happens but if you keep doing it then Satan is watching and those demons are watching and the spirits of of his kingdom are watching and they're going to come and approach you at some point it's going to happen if you step away from your protection then something's going to happen prophet of God would say this he says Eve never just simply walked out willfully and said I don't believe in God he said no it was an error she believed Satan never come out and said oh well that's not even the word of God he admitted it was the word of God but he put his own interpretation to it which God plainly told them not to do it what does this do he says it makes a strong delusion for the people to believe a lie and be damned by it so we're talking about the characteristics of a seduction but I want you to understand that the condition that has first has to be met is you have to get away from the word you have to get away from your first love you have to get away from your protection and the minute you do that then you're fair game that's why you stay with the word at all times you don't make excuses for yourself you don't make excuses for the other person you stay with the word at all times you Brothers can you imagine if a man tried to sweet talk your wife while you were standing there what would you do you would punch him in the nose in Christian love you would not allow a man to sweet talk your wife in front of you and listen if Adam had stayed close to Eve if he had cleaved to her completely then that serpent would have never had the opportunity so wives or daughters don't walk away from your headship but I'm talking to husbands and and fathers tonight it's up to us to guard our homes it's up to us to guard our wives it's up to us to guard our children amen because we are the first line of defense between them and everything that Satan's going to throw what we let into our homes we answer for listen if we let our kids do things we answer for we let our wife do it we answer for it they don't answer for it but they pay the price they pay the price but we answer for it so we answer to him but guess what the effects the fruit of what we allow they they have to deal with that and sometimes the complexes they get and sometimes the the addictions they get go back completely to us as husbands and as as fathers because we've let down the bars because we haven't what held against that seducing spirit that says it's okay we've got it under control a seducing Spirit lets you think you're the one that's making the move lets you think that you're the one that's controlling the pace but they've got an ulterior motive at all times amen so brother Brandon is saying here that Eve didn't walk out looking to disobey God even look out go out looking for a different voice but guess what when you walk away a different voice will come to you eventually and you've got to decide if that's of God or if it's somebody else because when you're alone you're a target for the enemy I know I said last service that there's only one definition in the scripture for a sheep by itself and that is lost it's lost it's lost it's lost and your only protection is with the shepherd that's Christ and with the other sheep and that's the body of Christ amen we are of protection to each other listen even a herd of wolves can't get into a flock of sheep if they band together and just face outwardly they can't get at them when we stick together that's when our protection is amen and like I said you might not get attacked the first time you go out but given enough time a predator will come across your Trail and he'll track you down and he'll attack you and then you're going to be on your own and you're going to have to trust that a Shepherd is going to come grab you out of where you've gotten yourself listen it's interesting as a as a deacon for the many years that I did it when I was in in other places the first thing I notice is that when Satan got a hold of somebody they stopped coming to church it's the first thing you see dropping off is they don't make it to church where they did before and when we don't track Church attendance here and I'm not talking about that but I'm saying when somebody regularly attends and then stops attending even occasionally it's indicative of what a seducing spirit that has pulled them away from The Fellowship of the Saints brother Brown would say this he said then just as sure as Church time comes you just can't keep from coming to church that ought to be our testimony he says see you're just going to go up if you have to hobble by hook or by crook you're going to make it to church he says you're going to church because the spirit itself Bears record of gathering together in Christ Jesus why because you can't be in Christ and out of fellowship with the bride of Christ that's the simple truth amen that's the only way that you're going to be in this body is to be in this body and it's a mystical body and it's not just this church but it's a global group of Believers of like Precious faith that have the Holy Spirit that are gathered together for the hearing of the word amen you don't have to attend this church you don't have to hear air me preach you don't have to have me as your pastor but you need to have a church and you need to have a pastor even the rest of the fivefold ministry needs to have a pastor amen we're there to support one another we're there to put our shoulder to the wheel and when Satan can pull you away from being a servant then guess what happens you get really selfish and you get introspective and you get egocentric and it means you're all in it for you and you're not in it for anybody else and not only are you hurting them but you lost their help for you as well and nobody wins and everybody loses amen listen I've seen it and what happens is if you actually survive out there you survive because you take on a goat nature why your ornery you're hard to be around and you hit anything that comes your way because that's what a goat does a go to go after anything that comes around it and that's the thing that survives is it just goes on the attack all the time and what happens is they can't get along with the people in the church and then they can't get along with their spouse and pretty soon they can't even get along with themselves and they're just grumpy and alone and they don't know why and then you go back to them and you ask what happened and they Point like Adam and Eve did to the one that was next to them well brother so-and-so did this her sister so and did this this or my past and we what is it everybody's looking at everybody else and nobody wants to look in the mirror and realize you made a decision you make a decision every single time how you're going to respond to situations and in the end whether we're in or whether we're out is our decision and we have to stand up and say that was my decision I am where I am because I chose to walk this path amen listen Church isn't always easy to attend amen it's not always easy to attend the preaching isn't always to our liking listen I struggle sometimes with the things I say up here not just because sometimes they're hard but because then I have to not only say them but I have to apply them to my own life as well I get a double spanking and so and you know my nature that Germanic side listen I don't need a ton of encouragement I just need somebody to tell me what to do and I'll go do it whether it feels good or not that's my nature I appreciate the encouragement don't stop encouraging me but I'll do it whether you encourage me or not because that's the way I'm built but I have to really balance that and this is me speaking just just personally now I've got to find that balance in my preaching where I'm not just telling you to do it but I'm encouraging you how to do it and why you do it in these different things so that's where you need Grace with me because my nature is to just lay it in your lap and never encourage not never encourage but less often because I'm Duty driven I'm high performance driven and so that's all that works for me but I I ran across this quote I was I was trying to find something else and I thought I'd include it here because it it starts off feeling a little harsh and then brother Brown just just wraps it in such a beautiful little picture he says and that's what we come to church for is what to find out where our faults is and the things we might better ourselves by oh no he says if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get much out of coming to church oh man the start of brother John's pastorship and this is what he's reading to us listen to this next line though he says we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are but don't stop there because he says and put our trust in somebody that's strong Hallelujah that's why I come is not to know just where I'm wrong not to just know where I'm weak but to know that where I am weak Thou Art strong when I can't do it you can do it when I don't want to do it there's something inside of me that says do it anyhow that's why I'm here is the growing grace and it's his grace that tells me to change it's his grace that tells me you can't stay in that condition it's his grace that says you've got to come up higher son you've got to come up higher daughter you cannot stay here and go in a rapture that's why we come to church it is not to be just rubbed up and down and told we're amazing but it is to be told a son and a daughter of God does not live that way and there's a higher plane for you tonight that is why I come to church that is why I preach the way I do because that's what he's doing with me and my personal life you cannot stay in that condition and walk this road with me you got to come up a little higher and you got to lay it down you've got to die you've got to surrender you've got to give everything you've got and lay it aside and let the power of the Holy Ghost work through you that's why we come to church this is not a place for people that are perfect it is people that are called to be perfect before him amen I'm here because I'm called I don't come here to get actually accolades and and pats on the back but he gives it he does he lets us know we're doing good he gives us encouragement how many times have we sat in the pews and and something comes over the pulpit and we're able to say Thank You Lord that's what I did and that's how I did it and he encourages us but at the same time his love is always corrective and corrective means he'll tell you the right way to go he'll tell you the way to be he'll tell you the things to do in your life amen we're talking about the characteristics of Seduction and I'm starting with our part today because we have to get to a place where we can be seduced for Satan to ever have an effect in our life and so I'm talking about what we have to get out of so that he gets in and if we can stay where we're supposed to be if we can do what we're supposed to do then Satan has no access to you listen there's nobody going to seduce my wife if I'm constantly beside her only a stupid man would do that or a very very big mean man but nobody's going to do it all you have to do is say that's my wife and they'll walk away sometimes all we have to do is say I'd like you to meet my husband the word have you met Jesus Christ and Satan doesn't like that when you say can I introduce you to two or three Witnesses in Scripture that say that you're a liar then he backs away real quick but when we'll stop and listen for a while that's when he's got some he's got an effect amen that's why I say fathers watch your sons and daughters we are the first line of defense and listen the Holy Spirit does not compromise and it's in in in in what it tells us to do it does not compromise on the word of God and if our answer to the situation compromises on the word of God it's not the Holy Ghost it cannot be the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God and it won't give us anything that's contrary to it amen listen we don't just need discernment as parents to see the effects but we need to see what the root cause of it listen we're coming into dandelion season hopefully in the next three to four months dandelions the bane of every man that wants to have a nice lawn or woman I guess what is it about dandelions that they grow faster than anything I know in the world because you see a dandelion and you reach down and you pluck the flower and two days later it has grown back completely and flowered and shedded seeds all over your lawn in two or three days why because you address the symptom of the dandelion rather than rooting it out and so you have to go to Canadian Tire you have to go get a steak knife and you get a machine or or something and you go in and you dig that thing out by the roots and you realize that a dandelion that's this tall has sometimes a root that's this deep and it's got a bunch of them stuck down inside of your lawn most of our grass is showing now and we walked over it the other day and I said to my wife I said look at all those little divots in our lawn it's from all the dandelions I pulled out that haven't grown back again sometimes it leaves holes in our lives when we dig things out and we've got to be okay and give give enough time for them to grow back and and produce what they're supposed to do but we've got to get to the root cause and that means parents we've got to be praying for each and every one of the situations we deal with with our children with our spouses these different things we've got to be praying parents because the answer for one is not always the answer for another the root cause for one is not always the root cause for another and so we've got to be able to go and find our answers for each child amen look at this brother Brian says Abraham trusted in God's word and we're children of Abraham today because we trust in God's word We Believe regardless of what people says and what the theologians say what Educators say science says if it's contrary to the word Every Man's word is a lie and God's is true it's the way I believe it and no matter how strange it may seem I believe it to be true anyhow listen in the way that is called heresy worship we today and don't ever expect the world to ever understand or acknowledge that the way we're doing things is going to be right fair or reasonable or have a good effect they just won't do it we're going to have to be able to stand and be counted Prophet God says this now it behooves us to stay spiritual now the problem with this is that we all have an idea of what spiritual means but can we let the prophet identify what spiritual means he says let us it behooves us to stay spiritual read the word that's where it starts because we can have gifts and we can have what we call leadership and we can have unctions and we can have visions and dreams and all these things but if it doesn't pull through the word then it can't be God so to be spiritual you have to know the word you have to know the scriptures he says and anything anything that rises outside contrary to that word then cast it aside you know what happens we get problems when spiritual people aren't actually living by the word they've got gifts they've got dreams they've got ideas they have all these things but they don't pull it through the word and all of a sudden they're off in this weird direction and you don't know why they're going that way and it's because they're spiritual but they're not reading their Bible really what that means is they're too lazy to go in and get the answer that God gave them and so they come up with a dream or a vision or this or that the other thing I don't believe we see those things in our church but it's out there I was commenting to my wife the other day and she shared a few things with me over time and I'm seeing this among professing message Believers and professing Christians and the repeating things and they're sharing things on social media that are completely contrary to scripture completely contrary to scripture completely contrary to what a prophet of God came and told us and yet because it sounds good or it looks good or it responds to a situation in a way they think it should they'll post it and they'll repeat it and you look at that and you say oh my goodness what are you thinking what is it because it appealed to their senses they were seduced enough that they would repost it and share with a bunch of people now listen it's one thing if if all your friends are message Believers and they kind of just say oh whatever I know where she's coming from where he's coming from but if you've got an unbelieving friend or a bible-believing friend that reads their Bible and they see you posting something that's completely off the scripture what does that do for our testimony because they say I thought that they were a Christian and then they're posting something and even I know better than that and they always tell me they know so much and they've got this Revelation that Revelation and then they look at that and they can't even see the falseness behind it because it's always just a little bit off it's rarely completely off it's just that little tinge in it and you stop and you say that's not quite right there ought to be a check in US that'll be a balance in us that says hey I better check that with the word before I share these things listen it's it's a seducing spirit that makes people want to sound great and sound good rather than actually be in line with the word and that's what's pulling people into it social media is all about image it's all about appearance and these people aren't actively trying to leave the word they're just not applying it in this part of their life and so people are looking at that and your testimony gets smeared because you didn't take the time to check it with the word of God Paul warns us about this he says in second Timothy 3 says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come listen we're in the last day so that means we're in perilous times right now that means it's dangerous for your Christian walk it's dangerous for your Christian testimony it's dangerous for our young people it's dangerous for our families it's dangerous for the church body today because he says this is when the most perilous times are going to come and Satan is only looking sometimes just to put a smear on your testimony just to take away your influence just to take away that thing that people admired enough so that they turn away he's just looking to get a little bit of dirt on you that's it just a just a whiff of something is enough to sometimes turn people away he says why for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy I've got to go to work two days a week these days and I'll tell you the hardest thing for me to take is the cursing and The Taking of God's name in vain everybody does it men and women alike and it's horrible it is rampant it's amazing if you spend time around worldly adults almost every other sentence is a curse word it's just built into them it's a sign of the end times listen everybody's doing it it says without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent that word incontinent means no self-control unable to tame their emotions or base nature or desires it says they'll be fierce listen social media has turned people crazy they're willing to fight over anything or nothing at the drop of a hat they're willing to fight somebody else's fight for them having never known that person never actually knowing what's right or wrong they'll just jump in and wait in and fight for somebody else it's a big mess it's a dog's breakfast as they say despisers of those that are good listen you can't even do anything right anymore with somebody without somebody coming and criticizing it brother Brown would say they call you Holy Rollers even within the Christian ranks Traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of self now cash is because we would say these are people in the world these are sinners these are unbelievers that Paul is talking about look at the next scripture verse 5 he says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof Church These are professing Christians these are professing believers that have these characteristics how did they get there it doesn't happen overnight but something turned them and in the end their last condition is worse than their first they're too full full more a child of Hell than when they started and yet they are religious they're under a different anointing they're under a different Spirit than they think amen listen these are people that are baptized these are people that attend church Faithfully that pay their tithes these are supposed faithful Christians and yet they're completely off the word why because they'd rather believe a lie than the truth that hurts because they want affirmation rather than correction and in the end that's why you'll break your promise and that's why you won't hold yourself to anything you don't hold yourself to a word standard you don't hold yourself responsible to the local body you don't do anything you're just Rogue you're just running around doing your own thing that's it listen it says from such turn away that means it can be in our midst that means Satan's trying to get this on me and this on you every single day he's trying to get you to the place where Paul would would have this very same description of us Prophet God says oh my having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away he says get away from it and stay away from it sometimes you've got to move and then you've got to stay moved he says get out to God and pray through to God and stay right with God he says live for God but I feel the time has come friends when something's got to be said he says and Friends turn away from your ways there is no halfway Christians you're just fooling yourself see you're either a Christian or a sinner as I said you never did see a drunk sober man you're either drunk or sober he's saying what get in or get out but don't pretend you're both at the same time because you can't be both at the same time listen if you're on the fence the fence belongs to Satan there is no neutral ground because those that aren't for us are against us Christ said brother Brian would say the social gospel denying the blood denying the need for the blood denying the power denying the Holy Ghost and all he says but thank God there is some who does believe it listen church this message we believe is not a social gospel this is not a community this is not group think this is not something we've come up with on our own this is life this is not a life this is life itself this is the very Source within us that drives us day in and day out this is a day in and day out experience that's supposed to be bubbling out of us it's that unquenchable fire that we've talked about it's not a social gospel amen this must Rule and reign in our hearts it's got to it's got to otherwise we're half in and half out and that means we're out it's time to decide am I in or am I out because listen time is running short brother Graham says puts in mind of the church no matter how much you substitute how big a congregation you get how well you sing your songs how good your congregation dresses how much you got this that or the other you could strike or feel or whatever it'll never take the place of life until Christ comes down in the form of the Holy Ghost into that church and gives it a new experience of being born again it'll never take the place of God's word God's word stands alone listen we're talking about our condition and where we have to be and where we have to stay in order to keep from giving Satan access to us but as part of that protection we have to realize that this is first and foremost an individual affair we do not get into our rapture we do not get married to Christ as a base on the basis of who's sitting next to us in our pews it has to be one-on-one amen you walk with God Amen your first step is with Christ and then your second is you're baptized into that body amen first is with him and second it's with the rest of us and we're all United and we work together amen but there's an individual Affair and you've got to be led you've got to have the Holy Ghost in your life you've got to be able to hear that still Small Voice that we were singing about so much in the service before I came up here this morning or this afternoon amen listen You'll never be able to work effectively until you've settled in your heart I've got the Holy Ghost and I've got a new birth and I know that I've been changed from what I was to what I am here today brother Brown would continue he would say having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof the power that can deliver you from this haunt this present World System he says from such turn away don't care what the rest of the people says it's you as an individual before God you've got to answer no matter what this woman does or that woman does or this man does or that man does or this preacher says or that preacher says it's you and God he says having a form after tradition but denying the power thereof from such turn away he says are we living in that day we sure are I I was looking up that that phrase denying the power thereof and brother Branham hits it well over a hundred times and most of the time when he talks about it he says that means to deny that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and how do we do it we make it about Doctrine we make it about what church we attend we make it about what Ministry we sit under we make it about how we dress and all of these different things and he says no it's the word being manifested in your life that's what the power is I was talking to brother Ed hammermeister and he said we're we're seeing a real transition in the message to where people are less focused on on individuals and Ministries and these things and they're focused on manifesting the word of God we've had so many powerful Ministries and we've had so many uh celebrities and these things and I'm not saying it's bad but that was really through the we saw in the 70s and 80s you know really keeping the church together and guarding them and very powerful men very powerful Ministries but what we're seeing now is what it's breaking into smaller groups and it's breaking into nobodies but it's now breaking into the ranks of the people where they realize that what they've got the Holy Ghost just the way the ministry does not in the same anointing and not with the same purpose but it's no less the Holy Ghost in their life and they're supposed to be something happening in the laity's life not just in the ministry's life these signs shall follow them that believe listen that's why when sister Betty came up it wasn't just me praying and it wasn't just the elders praying it was the whole church praying because there is power when the body is Unified in prayer and when we ask something of God together that means it's got to be all of us together pulling the load here it's not just me it's not just the ministry it's not just the the elected officers it's everybody coming in on this and that's when we see the results the Great results how much Faith do I have it's it is what it is but when we all add it together I guarantee all of us together have more than I do by myself and that's why we want these things that's why we want the people to see that as an individual you have power with God and through God through the Holy Spirit that's in your life quickening the word to you and through you each and every one of us young and old men and women alike God is working through his bride each and every one world religions will say they'll say as long as you've accepted Christ as your savior then that's all you have to worry about can you imagine how miserable it is if that's the only place we get to where we accept the free work of Grace but yet we never change we stay the same nothing ever moves we never give Victory listen it's not just a life that that that that that takes away our sins our blood that covers amen but it's a life that changes us from a fallen son and daughter into a manifested son and daughter of God Amen it's a life that not only separates us and cleanses the effects of rock and roll and drugs and alcohol and and all these different things that are in the world but it's a life that takes the very desire for those things out of us so that we now have a desire to do something else in our life so that instead of fighting what sin wants us to do now we're fighting to do what God wants us to do that there's something in us that's driving us forward and that's the life that we're looking for is something that that pushes us forward I was listening to Brother John Andes and and he preached a sermon a long time ago called come and then this last this last weekend he preached one called go come and get the change that you need and then go and do something with it and that's what we're supposed to be doing is we come and we get what we need but then we come to a place and it's adoption where God says now it's time for you to start working for me child and that's where we'll go when we get back to our our Redemption series amen but I want you to understand that these things that Paul talked about in heady and high-minded and Traders and all these things that is not a place where you can grow in God if that spirit's got you in a hold in a headlock you're not going anywhere you've got to break that Spirit you've got to break that effect you've got to break that influence before you can ever go anywhere because otherwise you're going to be internally focused and that'll never make you the kind of Christian that God wants us to be listen if Satan think of this if Satan can get us to stand still he's one that's all he's trying to do remember the prophet said footsteps is possession and I've said this many times all you're trying to do is get one step a day get one step more into your property give one more step that you haven't taken before and Satan's objective is to keep you from moving forward and if he can hold you steady then he is one because why you're supposed to be progressing you're supposed to be mature and you're supposed to be changing so keep fighting for that one step if only it's one step a day get that one step a day get that one Victory a day move forward and press the battle just a little bit more Paul continues in second Timothy he says for this of this sort these type of people are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women laid him with sins LED away with diver's lusts notice this is a seducing spirit it's a man going into a woman's house and she ain't his wife and he ain't her husband it's a seducing Spirit that's doing these things and we know that as Eve was seduced in Genesis the churches are being seduced by Satan today to the point where he can sit in the congregation being worshiped as God and they don't know it that's what the scripture says amen but watch now because he's talking about women being Laden with sins and led away and the these men come into their lives and it's not talking about women it's talking about churches it's talking about organizations it's talking about groups of people that get what they get under this this need for a certain type of thing and they're LED Away by their own desires and what happens is they end up what unmarried but soiled and nobody wants them anymore he says what ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of The Truth Listen a man that'll do that he'll say anything you want him to say to stay in influence and stay in power and take your money and all these different things so first sign of seducing spirit is that it'll tell you whatever you want to hear I want to stop here because we see a trend and Paul's pointing to this seduction he and he points to the women falling for it and we don't look at our women and say there you go sisters look out because we're all a part of the bride of Christ we're all a part of the bride of Christ listen we are typed as a bride in the scripture so that means all of us are under a nature that can be seduced Naturally Speaking that means that we are the target he's not trying to seduce Christ he already tried that and it didn't work so now he's coming to seduce us and each and every one of us is potentially susceptible to this seduction and it's a spirit that'll tell us what we want to hear because what does any time if you've ever talked to somebody that's Fallen by seduction that's that's cheated on somebody or or let a man take advantage of them what do they say that man did the first thing he did was tell them whatever they wanted to hear whatever they wanted to talk about they talked about it whatever issue they had they sat there and they commiserated listen sometimes women just want an agreeable listening ear that's all they want they want somebody to say you're right you're right you're so right yes absolutely and never challenge them in any way and just agree with them and you do that and they feel validated and they feel supported and they feel all these things and they'll get to the point now where they're they're putty in your hand they'll do whatever you want because you you you you approved of them where they're at and what they're saying in these different things I dropped in just for like five minutes to listen to brother Donnie Reagan the other day and he said this thing he said Satan will convince you of his sincerity and his concern about your situation or condition that's the seducing Spirit that's what he was doing with Eve oh Eve you're trying to be fruitful and multiply it's tough isn't it have you what about this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil have you ever ever considered that what did God say about that well he said don't touch it oh yeah but why do you think he said that do you think that maybe God's got a motive here that maybe isn't good sounds silly the god of love the god that created them the god that that gave them everything they had would somehow withhold something that would keep them from fulfilling his word but in the end he he got into her head and he got her to the point where she said you know what you're right God's got it out for me this is the way to go God's been holding me back she got to the place where she literally thought that God was holding her back listen I want to put it this way a seducing spirit is an echo chamber it repeats back what you say without a challenge without any sort of a a pushback it just says exactly what you say and repeats it back and validates you where you're at that's a seducing spirit listen as friends you'll know somebody's your real friend the first time they say all right when you say something that's off the word up till then it's just friendship but when you get into Fellowship now we can talk and you can say sorry brother John I don't think you're quite right on that because not because I feel not because I think but because thus say at the word and you'll point me back to the word every time you're not an echo chamber listen it's wonderful when we have fellowship and we're all in agreement isn't it but sometimes Fellowship means we have to correct as well and we have to tighten things up a little bit as iron sharpness iron the scripture says that's half the reason why we're in a body is because what we need that sharpening listen we've been around Church long enough to know that guess what sometimes it's not always fun being in the body and listen the bad things that happen to us in church are just as important as the good things because what it does is it shapes us and it molds us into better Christians that are more reflective of the word of God and the love of Christ the good and the bad are equally important in a body like this that friction sometimes is what some of the best things we can have because it proves Who You Are I'll tell you one of the one of the the neatest things I had happen in this church was a brother called me and said I messed up and I need help on figuring out how to make it right had nothing to do with me or anything like that and that's all I say about it that to me I was like wow wow when somebody can humble themselves and say I messed up and I need your help to make it right I'm like that is a believer because they're not all about ego they're all they're not about the front they put up they're not about their reputation they're about getting things made right and it absolutely amazed me and I was so so proud I don't know why I'd be proud of it but I was just like wow that's the caliber of people we have in this congregation and it's happened many times with different people where they'll come up and they'll say either I think something's off or I did something off and they make it right and I've had people come to me and say you are off and you need to make it right and guess what that's got to be okay as well that's what happens inside of a body is we're sharpening each other we're actually making each other better and we don't get that in an echo chamber a seducing Spirit never improves you it says you're great just the way you are and that's why you don't try moving forward because you think you're good enough where you're at why would you change if you're already great listen the holy spirit will always point us back to the word both as confirmation and correction so if you're right the holy spirit will say you're right because the word says and if you're wrong the holy spirit will say you're wrong because the word says but the Holy Spirit doesn't just tell us to do things it points us back to the word because that's where our foundation is that's where our absolute is and so if we're making decisions and we have no word for it I would recommend this stay until you get the word for it I'm not saying you're wrong I'm saying stay until you get the word for your decision because now you've got an anchor now you've got a foundation now you've got something sure to go back to and you can say Lord this is what I'm basing my decision on Lord this is what I'm basing my leadership on because your word says and it doesn't just say it once but it says it from Genesis to Revelation don't take one take two or three that's what the scripture says a Witnesses out of the mouth the two or three Witnesses out of the mouth of two or three scriptures get your foundation and then Satan can trip you up because remember with Jesus he tried one scripture at a time but if he would have read the ones before and the ones after then it wouldn't have worked so he only pulled out the one and that's what he'll do is he'll give you one scripture but you've got to get it in context and you've got to read it from Genesis to Revelation you've got to get aligned gun sites you got to have at least two otherwise it could mean anything you can make it mean anything brother Brown put it this way he says look so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits there in the world they're demons and they go out into places and they get amongst men and ministers guess what I gotta look out doubly so because if he can get me off then I can spread that to an entire church husbands fathers if he can get us off he can spread it to our entire families he says they go out into places and they get amongst men ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people and they cause them to come into to an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the word of God what's an illusion something that appears real but isn't it's a pretense it's a fake it has no substance and that's the great letdown at the end of a seduction is that you realize it wasn't real in the first place that man didn't really love me that person isn't really my friend why because they were in it for themselves not for you and when that whole facade crumbles it hurts listen I have been hurt by Ministries I've been hurt by Believers I've been hurt by church people I've been hurt by family I've been in had so many disappointments and on the flip side I've caused disappointments to people I've caused disappointments to ministers I've caused disappointments to family I've been on both sides of it and that is sometimes the hardest thing to handle is when it crumbles and you're not what you thought they thought you were and they're not what you thought they were and often what happens is the letdown is so sharp because we put them in a place that we ought not to have I appreciate each and every one here but if I get you two lifted up or you get me too lifted up God's Gonna Knock us down a little bit because he won't share his glory with anyone and then he wants to work through you he doesn't want you to take his place and these things listen anything that points you to a man is a seducing spirit 100 percent so if a Ministry keeps pointing you to him or his church that man's under a seducing spirit and anybody that points you to a man anyone that says I've got all the answers this one has this and no no no that's a seducing spirit because that belongs to God and God Alone Paul would say this and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God listen when I when I hear Paul talk about himself I sometimes wonder if we'd even have him preached in our churches Paul was not a good speaker listen Paul put eudicus to sleep Paul was not a big Dynamic minister we wouldn't say he had a gift as an or-raider that people will be drawn by the way he spoke his sermons listen uticus literally fell asleep while Paul was droning on and on and on Not only was Paul a bad speaker but he was a long-winded bad speaker how many of us would have Paul in our church based on that and yet you look at what he said I mean amazing the things that he said but he says I didn't come to you with Excellency of speech or wisdom Paul didn't have a a big following because of his dynamicism he says for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the power of the spirit and the power listen Paul might have put uticus to sleep so that he fell out of the window and died but then Paul had power to raise him up again that's the kind of preacher Paul was he might put you to sleep with his preaching but he always made sure you wake up in the end I'll take that preacher anytime somebody that's got what the real life of God inside of him and isn't just a bag of wind he says why why did I do it that way he says that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God what was it Paul didn't want people's eyes on him before Paul got saved all he cared about was his image he talked about it remember he says earlier he says bear with me and my Folly but you think you were great I was greater you think you were from a great place I was from a greater family you think you were this well I was better he said bear with me and my Folly now this is how I used to think whatever you think you're good at I was better and yet now Paul says now I don't want anything to do with me I don't want you to look at me in any way but I want you to only know Jesus Christ and him crucified and raised again and see the power of him in my life brother Brown will put it this way he says now watch what for Paul why'd you do this why did you come this way he says power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God he says oh what a preacher that great man who he sought God and he said God I am weak and I don't know what to do I just pray you God to strengthen me and take my affirmities away from me and these things so I can be stronger that's a wonderful prayer that's a great thing Lord take away my weaknesses so I can be better in your service watch what he says God spoke back to him Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness then Paul said when I am weak then I am strong yes he said I will glory in my infirmities of my weaknesses and so forth I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me and when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as long as I got some of myself there God can't get in he says there that's it we smother him out from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves a seducing spirit will say you're capable you can do it you got the gifts you got the the anointing you got this that and the other thing listen you better make sure you're truly subject to the word when you do that otherwise you do a lot of damage I don't have the quote in here but brother Brown says the greatest damage he says is a true gift operated wrongly greatest damage happens in the Church the true gift operated wrongly what when we get our fingers in the pie he says we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy seventh angel Prophet to the age gets in the way and he's lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture if that's the prophet of the age saying that then what does that mean for us he says but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place where he is out of the way then God can come over and do things that William Branham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody even a nobody especially a nobody he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we get ourselves in the way he says then we cannot listen we have a word that has all the answers we need I believe that with all my heart everything you have need of is right here listen but he gave a five-fold Ministry and sometimes we can rely on that so heavily that we forget that we've got a relationship with God that can give us answers too that's why I'm not meant to have every answer for the congregation so when you ask me to pray about things I'll pray about them but my prayer is always that God will move on your life to give you the unction and give you the leadership not to give me the leadership because if I get it and I tell you then you're going to come back to me if things go wrong and it may or may not be my fault but if you go and you get your answer then he answers for it and now you've got a one-way you've got a two-way connection with him that doesn't have to run through a man there's no mediator between you and Christ it's just you in Christ that's what he's there for so I'm there to pray for you but I'm not always there to get an answer now sometimes God will use that sometimes God will use a pastor God will use a minister to give you an answer I believe that wholeheartedly we've seen it many many times but that doesn't mean that every answer you're going to get has to come from a minister you're supposed to be able to go in your prayer closet and get your answers for yourself amen listen you're marrying Christ not me go to your husband that's where your safety is that's where your safety net is that's where you can't be seduced down another path I can mislead you but Christ can't we're speaking on the characteristics of a seduction and listen Satan's aim is to get us to rely on Humanity rather than the Holy Spirit quickening the word to our lives if he can get us away from that and get us dependent on each other for everything then he's got us licked because in the end we will fail each other we're only human we can only do so much but that Holy Spirit has no lack of energy doesn't have to go to sleep but doesn't have to leave and come back in these different things but it's an ever-present help in a time of trouble it's always got an answer for us if we'll wait for him to show us amen Paul continues in second Timothy he says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived listen it's one thing when somebody knows they're wrong but when somebody doesn't know they're wrong and they're convinced they're right then they're even more effective in convincing others of it as well so the one that is self-deceived is the greatest deceived of all and when they don't realize they're deceived and they go certain they start to tell other people what they think or believe guess what they're all the more effective because there's no doubt they're they're a deceiver with faith in their deception because they have no idea that they're wrong in these things he says how do we counteract this how do you keep from falling into this trap he says but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them in other words stick with what's come from a proven Source Paul said follow me as I follow Christ as long as you've seen the works of Christ in my life follow me and heed the things that I tell you led me to that place and if not he says look out because that's just a good talker you've got to have a proven source for these things it's got to be proven by what the word and the life of the speaker that's giving you that word you've got to be very careful who you're listening to verse 15 says in that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine forever proof for correction and for instruction in righteousness with what angle with what purpose he says that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works thoroughly furnished under all good works in ed in other words everything you need for your life is found right here the inspiration you need is right here and all you need is something to Quicken it as we spoke about in the last service amen how do you know a seducing spirit keeps you away from this every time it keeps you away from this it'll give you a little bit here and it might give you a little bit there but it'll never give you the full word I'm going to close with these two quotes and brother Branham is talking about that Vision he had of the bride at the end and he says then I heard something like all more Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging down way down on their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel he says she was the word they look like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed by and seen them pass by by appearance they were perfect but Watch What Happens he says instead of going down they started going up remember he had seen the different brides and he saw the bride from America and he said she was walking to that rock and roll she was marching the rock and roll beat she was Boogie and she was swaying her hips and he says what happened was they started what going down down down until they fell into what hell he says but this one everyone else was going down he says and instead of going down now this one started going up she was dressed right she was acting right she looked it right by appearance by walk by all of these things she was perfect she was headed in the right direction they're headed for heaven he says but then I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line and I screamed stay in line and if you hear him and he's preaching this and he screams it out stay in line why because he knows that something got a hold of their ear and was pulling them away from the Tree of Life he said the holy spirit is here to drive us to the tree of life and there's something now Satan he says is trying to hold us back he says what happens something pulled him away he says and I was stand the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line it so moved him it so overtook him what he saw happening there that all he was left to do was scream stay in line don't move away from what's been proven hold fast to that which you've been taught taught knowing who taught it to you knowing who brought it to you stick with what is proven don't get out of line he says I wonder could it already be passed could the bride already be called is that what we're going through today she has to be molded and made into the image of Christ and Christ is the word amen God bless you the musicians would come it's perilous times we can stand together it's perilous times we know Satan's going around like a roaring lion he's trying to get us out of line he's trying to get us off the Mark he's trying to get us discontented he's trying to get us mad he's trying to get us sad he's trying to get us in any way he can to get our eyes off of the word of God Amen the last one the last services that was the message the Rapture that was just 21 days before brother Branham died and what was he doing he was saying stay in line stay with the Simplicity that is in Christ stay with what has been proven to work we saw a chief offering we saw a wave offering that went before us and it proved what this message is capable of doing when it takes us back to that word and that word is quickened to us and he's saying don't be seduced by quick results by promises by Echo chambers that just tell you everything you say and think is right that don't ever challenge you but stick with the word of God and take the lumps take the lumps because that's what means you're growing The Growing Pains that come with sticking with the word they don't always feel so good but it shows that something's happening amen we can't get lazy we can't get tied down but we've got to be quick to keep moving with what the word of God is trying to do in our lives amen don't get drawn away by a fancy message by a dynamic gift stick with the simplicity and you'll be right you'll do just fine amen stay humble stay surrendered and stay close to Christ and you won't have to worry about it amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's a warning we've received tonight Lord and I think sometimes we forget the battle's not over until we're out of here and Lord it's not always obvious Lord sometimes it's embarrassing the things that we let in and we look back and we wonder how we got there but Lord God I'm asking your grace to come in tonight Lord that you'd help us to look in the mirror of your word Lord that you'd help us to say I'm not where I need to be in this something's got in and it wasn't the holy spirit in my life and it's pulling me away and it's hindering me and I can't have any hindrances because it's time to get going Lord God I pray each one of us old and young alike or from the front to the back lord may we take Lord inventory of our life Lord if it seems like we've been winning all the time Lord let's take a closer look to see if maybe something snuck through what if we've opened a loophole Lord if we've opened a window in our home Lord that's let Satan in order we're just starting to see some effects Lord help us to stay close to that word Lord help us to read your word every single day Lord that we would know it Lord like the back of our hand Lord that it would be the first thing that comes to our mind and the first thing that comes out of our lips heavenly father is it is written though because your word says that's what defeats him Lord we live by every word Lord help us to stay with it we pray Lord keep us simple keep us humble Lord let us not get lifted up but may we just Trust You Lord trust your grace trust your plan trust your process each one we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen

the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen praise the Lord I've often said that the songs we sing sometimes are prayers and sometimes they're commitments so if we're serious about that Jesus draw me close and we get to be obviously the opposite of that it's a we're closer to him We're farther away from the world and we don't want the world right right by grace I see nothing out in the world anymore that really really attracts me it's a it's just it's just gone I don't know what else I could say it's just gone you know that's why I don't listen to the news anymore it just I can't take it just can't
