[43:38] plan come to pass in every one of us we
[43:41] talked about that jehovah jireh
[43:42] attribute of god and how he's put that
[43:44] in the man to be the provider how he's
[43:46] put it in him to be the one that toils
[43:48] and sweats and and breaks his body for
[43:50] the sake of his family and for his
[43:52] household and then we ended that service
[43:54] with the realistic reminder that we
[43:56] probably didn't need and that's that men
[43:58] are not perfect and men husbands are not
[44:00] perfect and fathers aren't perfect and
[44:02] that can certainly lead to issues and
[44:04] one of those issues we talked about was
[44:06] putting the women into the role of
[44:08] having to provide for the family in some
[44:10] form or fashion and that's where we want
[44:11] to pick up again today to hopefully
[44:13] close us out before i head off for a
[44:15] week of hunting and relaxation and
[44:18] that's walking 10 to 20 kilometers a day
[44:20] in bog and bush and eating my own
[44:21] cooking so we'll see if that actually is
[44:24] a break and relaxation but regardless
[44:27] i'm looking forward to getting out and
[44:28] just getting away from everything for a
[44:30] while amen now let's drop back into the
[44:32] scripture here and see the response we
[44:34] take and really what we're talking about
[44:36] here in this book of james is when a man
[44:37] gets in over his head amen and it
[44:40] doesn't just apply to the brothers of
[44:41] course it applies to all of us but i
[44:43] want us to see what the the scriptural
[44:46] you know response is when we get into
[44:47] something and we say i've got nothing
[44:49] left i don't know what to do i don't
[44:51] have anything to offer i'm out of my
[44:53] depth and these different things so
[44:55] james 1 verse 2 says my brethren counted
[44:58] all joy when you fall into divers
[45:00] temptations that means different
[45:02] temptations we don't face the same thing
[45:03] all the time if we miss if we're going
[45:05] through the same thing all the time it's
[45:06] usually because we haven't actually won
[45:08] that battle yet we haven't gotten the
[45:10] victory but that word temptations means
[45:12] trials and provings and when i took it
[45:14] back to the to the root word there it
[45:16] had this to say it said it is the trial
[45:18] of man's fidelity
[45:20] integrity
[45:22] virtue
[45:23] and constancy
[45:24] it's an enticement to sin temptation
[45:27] whether arising from the desires
[45:29] or from the outward circumstances so it
[45:31] can be something pushing in on you to
[45:33] try and get you to do something that
[45:35] you're not supposed to do or it can be
[45:37] an internal temptation to sin and it
[45:39] reminds us of the temptation which the
[45:41] devil sought to divert jesus the messiah
[45:43] from his divine aaron it's trying to get
[45:45] you to go to an end result without going
[45:47] through the work of the res of what's
[45:49] required to get you there with character
[45:51] and with strength and with victory amen
[45:53] so you have an outside one trying to get
[45:54] you to do something that's against the
[45:56] word but then there's an inward
[45:57] temptation to skip the process and jump
[45:59] to the end goal and we know that never
[46:01] works either it says the condition of
[46:03] things or a mental state by which we are
[46:06] enticed to sin or to elapse from the
[46:08] faith in holiness this is one of those
[46:10] little things where you say i'm just
[46:12] going to do this i'm just going to give
[46:13] in today and then i'll go back to being
[46:15] a christian tomorrow or that sort of
[46:16] thing it's those little things that we
[46:18] give into on a maybe a daily or a weekly
[46:20] basis where we just have this little
[46:22] thing that kind of we like to do from
[46:23] time to time
[46:25] it says adversity
[46:26] affliction trouble now catch this it's
[46:30] sent by god and serving to test or prove
[46:33] one's character
[46:35] faith and holiness so what james is
[46:37] talking about here when he's talking
[46:38] about these divers or different
[46:40] temptations is something that proves
[46:42] whether what you say you are is actually
[46:44] what you are amen whether you've got the
[46:46] goods if you can just not only walk talk
[46:49] the talk but if you can walk the walk
[46:51] and so we have to remember when we're
[46:53] walking through life and when we're
[46:54] talking about these things is that we
[46:55] are one thing and that is a work in
[46:57] progress amen that we are not perfect we
[47:00] are not whole in and of ourselves do we
[47:02] do not have the experience we do not
[47:03] have the knowledge we don't have the
[47:04] training as soon as we are born as soon
[47:07] as we get the holy ghost to overcome
[47:09] necessarily in every situation the
[47:11] simple fact is we don't know what we
[47:13] don't know
[47:14] and it's going to take sometimes a
[47:15] situation to let us realize what we
[47:17] don't know or what we don't have and
[47:18] conversely to let us know what we do
[47:20] have and what we do know amen because
[47:23] the test or the trial proves whether
[47:25] what you have is the real deal whether
[47:27] it's the real goods amen like i said
[47:29] before we're speaking to the men tonight
[47:30] not so much to the women but when we
[47:32] were born a man when we were born a male
[47:34] we did not automatically get everything
[47:36] that we need to do everything we're
[47:38] supposed to do in this world according
[47:40] to the word amen and when we got the
[47:42] holy ghost we didn't get that sudden
[47:43] download of all the character of all the
[47:45] knowledge of all the experience of all
[47:47] the faith of all the strength all of
[47:48] these patiences that we might need we
[47:50] didn't just get that when we got the
[47:52] holy ghost we got access to it and then
[47:54] we got a guide and a trainer and a
[47:55] mentor that can bring us into it we got
[47:57] a god that can change us into his
[47:59] likeness but we did not automatically
[48:01] download that because we need the way to
[48:03] apply it as well and sometimes we get
[48:05] into a situation then we realize i need
[48:07] more of god than i have amen and that's
[48:09] what james is talking about here and the
[48:11] simple fact in all of this is there is
[48:13] no replacement for experience there's a
[48:15] reason why a pastor has to be
[48:16] experienced is because you don't want
[48:18] somebody inexperienced in that role
[48:20] because the inexperience make mistakes
[48:22] amen and sometimes you can't afford
[48:24] those mistakes and so you need to have
[48:26] somebody that's been proven and that has
[48:27] been tested in these things and it's the
[48:29] same thing as we go through our lives as
[48:31] men we've got to get to the place where
[48:33] we have an experience and that
[48:34] experience is not in head knowledge or
[48:36] understanding of the word but it's in
[48:37] the reality of the word it's in the
[48:39] power of the word it's in the provision
[48:41] of the word and that's godly experience
[48:43] that we're looking for as men amen so
[48:45] what these trials are for us and what
[48:47] they're talking about is taking what we
[48:49] believe to be right and testing it to
[48:51] see if it actually is right and if what
[48:53] we believe is right and we're putting it
[48:55] through the test then what comes out on
[48:56] the other side should be the word fruits
[48:58] and the word results and then because if
[49:00] what we believe is the word and what
[49:02] comes out on the other side is not the
[49:04] word then we've got a disconnect
[49:05] somewhere something isn't according to
[49:07] the word like we said before when we
[49:09] look at the stature of a perfect man we
[49:12] have what we have faith and then from
[49:13] there comes strength to believe it and
[49:15] after that comes knowledge and this
[49:16] knowledge is when your faith becomes
[49:18] sight because at this point when god
[49:20] proves himself you no longer have to
[49:22] wonder is he going to do it next time
[49:24] once he proves himself to be a healer
[49:25] you'll believe it for the next time once
[49:27] he proves himself to be a provider then
[49:29] you believe it for the next time brother
[49:30] branham talks about getting into your
[49:32] car and turning the key the first time
[49:33] you get in the car you may not know if
[49:35] it's going to start or not but every
[49:37] time after that after it starts the
[49:38] first time you go in expecting the key
[49:41] to start the car every time and that's
[49:43] what godly knowledge is is that every
[49:44] time you do things according to the word
[49:46] because he's proven it over and over and
[49:48] over again you just go in and you turn
[49:50] the key of the word by faith and what
[49:52] happens happens because what you're
[49:54] believing the word and this becomes
[49:55] sight to you now it's not something you
[49:57] have to work up it's not something you
[49:58] have to pray down it's just knowledge
[50:00] you know that god is real in this area
[50:02] in this situation and so you just say
[50:04] god i'm turning the key and god does
[50:06] exactly what you expect him to do
[50:08] because you're in the word and the word
[50:09] has been made flesh and it's been made
[50:10] an experience and a reality in your life
[50:12] amen
[50:14] what faith becomes routine and when
[50:15] faith becomes routine it becomes
[50:17] knowledge and you can use it all day
[50:18] every day right you don't have to sit
[50:20] there believing believing believing
[50:21] because you know and therefore it's
[50:23] knowledge to you
[50:24] amen verse 3 says knowing this that the
[50:27] trying of your faith
[50:29] worketh patience so the trying of your
[50:31] faith is what these trials are about is
[50:33] proving what you believe it's proving
[50:35] what you believe the word to say it says
[50:37] it does what it works patience now the
[50:39] word patience means steadfastness
[50:42] constancy and endurance see a lot of
[50:44] times we think of it as the endurance
[50:46] part
[50:46] hold on
[50:48] that's patience but he says no no it's
[50:50] the steadfastness and constancy it's the
[50:52] unwillingness to change from the word in
[50:55] the trial it's the unwillingness to go
[50:57] to the side to the left or to the right
[50:59] but to stay true to the word through it
[51:02] that's your constancy is to stay with
[51:04] what god has said regardless of what the
[51:06] circumstances look like
[51:08] it says here in the new testament it's
[51:10] the characteristic of a man who is not
[51:12] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[51:15] his loyalty to faith and piety by even
[51:19] the greatest trials and sufferings
[51:21] basically it doesn't matter how
[51:22] desperate the situation gets how bad
[51:25] things get you stay with the word you
[51:27] stay with what god has told you to do
[51:29] each and every time it says a patient
[51:31] steadfast waiting for that's what we
[51:33] think of most often and that says a
[51:35] patient enduring sustaining and
[51:38] perseverance now that means patience
[51:40] can't happen overnight
[51:42] when we pray for patients look out
[51:45] i never pray for patients because you
[51:47] know what patients mean it's going to be
[51:49] a while
[51:50] because that's what patience has to has
[51:52] to see is that there is a space between
[51:54] the request and the answer and in the
[51:56] middle is patience and that's the trial
[51:57] of your faith amen so when i've prayed
[51:59] for things
[52:01] then what the trial is that will we hold
[52:03] on and will we have patience until the
[52:05] answer comes
[52:06] james says the trial and the proving of
[52:08] your faith comes through patience
[52:11] you've got to be able to wait it out
[52:12] you've got to be able to let god be god
[52:14] and come into the situation so a
[52:17] prayerful request always follows with a
[52:19] need for patience because god does not
[52:21] always answer that moment the answer may
[52:24] be on the way but the appearance or the
[52:25] manifestation of that answer is not
[52:27] necessarily going to come the next day
[52:30] he says but let patience have her
[52:32] perfect that means her complete work
[52:35] that you may be perfect that means
[52:38] doesn't mean complete it means brought
[52:40] to an end or finished
[52:43] it's talking about the process of god to
[52:45] change us it means talking about the
[52:46] process of god to grow us to mature
[52:49] to take us to what he wants us to be
[52:52] that's what this patience requires amen
[52:54] and what's what it produces it says that
[52:55] ye may be perfect and entire that word
[52:59] entire means complete in all its parts
[53:01] in no way wanting or unsound
[53:05] they used to call horses they had to
[53:07] check them whether they were sound or
[53:09] unsound you know what unsound meant it
[53:11] meant that they had bad teeth so they
[53:13] couldn't eat properly which meant they'd
[53:14] be malnourished and they wouldn't have
[53:16] their health for very long but the
[53:18] unsoundness was that they would break
[53:19] down after a short burst of exercise you
[53:22] wanted a horse that could go all day
[53:24] long and if it didn't it was unsound
[53:27] and it's the same thing for humans we're
[53:28] looking at somebody that can do what
[53:30] that can hold on for the long run that
[53:32] can work their way through the situation
[53:34] that doesn't fall down as soon as things
[53:36] get a little bit tough
[53:38] it says without blemish or defect free
[53:41] from sin
[53:42] faultless and complete in all respects
[53:46] that's what he's talking about here
[53:47] that's the purpose of these trials these
[53:48] testings that we go through he said what
[53:51] wanting nothing
[53:54] and if any of you lack wisdom let him
[53:57] ask of god that's what we're talking
[53:59] about when we get in over our head he
[54:01] says if any one of you lack wisdom let
[54:03] him ask of god that giveth to all men
[54:06] liberally and upbraideth not and it
[54:08] shall be given to him that means when
[54:10] you ask he doesn't say you're supposed
[54:12] to have this
[54:13] he doesn't say but you've been a child
[54:15] of mine for 22 years and you still don't
[54:18] have this figured out what's going on no
[54:20] no he says if you'll come and ask for
[54:22] what you have need of then he gives to
[54:24] you and he doesn't say you're supposed
[54:25] to have this already and then when we go
[54:27] to him in humility when we go to him
[54:29] with the need and we say lord i need
[54:31] more of you i need you in this situation
[54:34] that he always responds with i'll give
[54:35] you more i'll give you what you have
[54:37] need of i'll step up your game by
[54:40] stepping myself into your situation amen
[54:42] i'll grow and mature you into what you
[54:44] need to be
[54:46] but let who let this man ask him faith
[54:49] nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
[54:52] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[54:54] wind and tossed it has no direction it
[54:56] has no control the waves have no choice
[54:58] they go where the wind blows them amen
[55:00] he's saying that's the way that man is
[55:02] if he's wavering on it you'll be pulled
[55:04] and pushed and you'll be turned this way
[55:05] in that way in the situation he says no
[55:07] no hold fast don't expect anything other
[55:10] than what you've prayed for right if you
[55:12] go in asking then come out expecting
[55:15] amen so the question is why do we ever
[55:17] go to god and say we lack something
[55:19] why do we ever go to him and say i have
[55:21] need of something
[55:22] pain pain is what does it isn't it now
[55:25] you say no it's when i have a need but
[55:26] what is that need brought about by it's
[55:29] in pain if you're if you need food what
[55:32] is the pain it's hunger amen if you need
[55:34] more of god in your marriage then what's
[55:36] the pain your marriage isn't doing so
[55:38] well amen if you need if you're going to
[55:40] him and say lord i need financial
[55:42] blessing what is it the needs aren't
[55:44] being met you're in a difficulty and
[55:46] it's causing pain it's causing
[55:47] discomfort in your life and that's the
[55:49] thing that usually drives us to god
[55:50] unfortunately is when things aren't
[55:52] going so well when we're feeling pain
[55:54] rather than we are in feeling loved and
[55:56] protected and provided for that rarely
[55:58] drives us to god but the minute we feel
[56:00] pain the minute we feel discomfort the
[56:01] minute things aren't going our way then
[56:03] we run to god very quickly
[56:05] amen
[56:07] what is it james says look but when you
[56:09] get into those situations go talk to god
[56:11] about it go talk to god and say god you
[56:13] are my great provider we talked about
[56:15] that last time jehovah jair lord you see
[56:17] and you will see to it if i will only
[56:19] invite you into the situation if i will
[56:21] only ask you to do
[56:23] what i need done in this situation now
[56:25] you look at that and you say brother
[56:26] jonathan he's asking for wisdom i don't
[56:29] need wisdom i need more money
[56:32] i don't need wisdom i need deliverance i
[56:34] don't need wisdom i need healing but
[56:37] when we look at wisdom
[56:39] it covers more than just this idea of
[56:41] knowledge or understanding it's it's a
[56:43] whole gamut of things amen you say i
[56:46] don't need wisdom i just need to make a
[56:47] career change or know if i need to make
[56:49] it i need to know if i need to upgrade
[56:51] my education i need to know if i have to
[56:53] move someplace else
[56:54] right i'm not looking for wisdom i'm
[56:56] looking for leadership but we'll find
[56:58] that leadership is encompassed in wisdom
[57:00] if we look a little more closely and we
[57:02] look at the original word in the bible
[57:04] in the greek and it says wisdom is broad
[57:07] and full of intelligence and that's
[57:08] usually what we think about when we say
[57:10] wisdom but then it says the knowledge of
[57:12] very diverse matters specifically the
[57:15] very knowledge of things human and
[57:17] divine what it means is that you know
[57:18] things that are carnal and spiritual
[57:21] because what we're carnal creatures and
[57:22] you've got to be able to address carnal
[57:24] situations through a spiritual filter so
[57:26] you've got to know the carnal but you've
[57:27] got to know the spill spiritual you've
[57:29] got to know how those things integrate
[57:31] and how they can work together he says
[57:33] skill in the management of affairs
[57:37] amen if we're a husband if we're a
[57:38] father we know to know how to manage our
[57:40] affairs don't we if we're in the
[57:42] ministry we need to know how to manage
[57:43] our affairs if we're in any sort of a
[57:46] position of authority or responsibility
[57:48] we have to know how to manage what's
[57:49] underneath ah say amen
[57:52] it says
[57:53] devout and proper prudence in discussion
[57:55] with men not disciples of christ and
[57:57] skill and discretion and imparting
[57:59] christian truth so this is the ability
[58:00] to witness
[58:02] not only to those that are of the
[58:04] household of faith but those that are
[58:05] outside the household of faith the
[58:07] ability to speak to people at their
[58:09] level
[58:11] and then it says the knowledge and
[58:13] practice of the requisites for godly and
[58:15] upright living
[58:17] this is in other words living the life
[58:20] that's what wisdom is is the ability to
[58:22] take what you've been taught and put it
[58:24] into action so that you live what you
[58:26] believe this is all encompassed in
[58:27] wisdom so wisdom does what it takes
[58:30] everything intellectual and everything's
[58:32] spiritual and it brings them into a
[58:34] package that you can apply in your
[58:35] everyday life
[58:36] amen you don't need to be spiritual to
[58:39] step out of the way of a car driving
[58:41] down the road at you you don't need
[58:42] spiritual discernment for that amen
[58:44] that's colonel
[58:45] but you do have to know how you're going
[58:47] to lead your family and that is not
[58:49] something that's supposed to be carnal
[58:50] it's supposed to be spiritual amen so
[58:52] we've got to know when to be practical
[58:54] and we've got to know when to be
[58:55] spiritual if i can put it that way and
[58:56] wisdom takes those two and it puts us
[58:58] together so that we're not over
[58:59] spiritualizing something that's simple
[59:01] and we're not under spiritualizing
[59:03] something that has a far greater impact
[59:04] than we might happen or know
[59:06] amen so when we get into a situation
[59:08] where we're over our heads what is the
[59:10] thing we need wisdom that's what solomon
[59:12] asked for when he was put into the
[59:14] kingdom position when he took the throne
[59:16] of david is he said i need wisdom if you
[59:18] give me wisdom everything else will
[59:20] follow
[59:21] but without wisdom he says i'll fall
[59:23] flat on my face you can give me all
[59:25] these other things but without wisdom
[59:26] i'll waste it right i won't use it in
[59:28] the way that i'm supposed to
[59:31] so what this wisdom encompasses not only
[59:33] the knowledge but it's the experience
[59:35] and you say well how am i going to get
[59:36] experience
[59:37] you get experience through trials that's
[59:39] what god does is he puts you into a
[59:41] situation where you have to apply what
[59:43] you know or what you think you know and
[59:44] then he brings you through it and as
[59:46] you're going through it you start
[59:47] applying what you've been taught how
[59:49] you've been raised the the input you get
[59:51] from the people that you trust and look
[59:53] to and you start to apply it and then
[59:55] you see how it takes you through and
[59:57] you're going to get experience one way
[59:58] or the other aren't you now it might be
[1:00:00] bad experience or it might be good
[1:00:02] experience and most of us we get bad
[1:00:03] experience before we get good experience
[1:00:05] but it's supposed to teach us for the
[1:00:07] next time that we do it and we get a
[1:00:08] good experience the next time and then
[1:00:10] don't look down because you made a
[1:00:11] mistake don't look down because you're
[1:00:13] failing just say what did i learn and
[1:00:15] how do i keep from doing that the next
[1:00:17] time amen the righteous man follows down
[1:00:19] what seven times but he gets up again we
[1:00:21] want to be able to get up from those
[1:00:22] mistakes learned from it and move on
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:27] but the thing is god has a way of doing
[1:00:29] things and god's given us the word to
[1:00:30] lead us and guide us and we always want
[1:00:32] to look to that as we step into
[1:00:34] situations and say god what is your
[1:00:36] provided way that's what we focused on
[1:00:38] last time is god has a provided way
[1:00:40] can we find it can we see in the world
[1:00:42] where he's provided for where we can
[1:00:43] find a promise where we can find that
[1:00:45] guidance and direction and then we can
[1:00:47] step into that and we can move forward
[1:00:49] with full confidence amen now we're
[1:00:52] talking about men and we're talking
[1:00:53] about provision and i think we've proven
[1:00:55] at this point by the scriptures that god
[1:00:57] has put the man in the place of being
[1:00:59] the provider for the family amen
[1:01:02] now we're going to be talking a little
[1:01:04] bit about this and this isn't directed
[1:01:05] at anyone we don't have any wives in
[1:01:07] this church that are working as far as i
[1:01:09] know out in the workforce so i'm not
[1:01:10] speaking to this church in the sense
[1:01:12] that there's somebody here that needs
[1:01:14] this specifically amen but we do have a
[1:01:17] lot of young people that are coming up
[1:01:18] and need to know what they're getting
[1:01:20] into so again we're talking to the
[1:01:22] brothers not to the sisters specifically
[1:01:24] and because we've got young men that are
[1:01:27] coming up that are going to be getting
[1:01:29] married lord willing and they're going
[1:01:30] to be raising families because we've got
[1:01:31] young sisters that lord william will
[1:01:33] someday accept proposals of marriage
[1:01:35] they need to know what it looks like
[1:01:36] when they get into these things and how
[1:01:38] you make a decision and how you step
[1:01:40] into that and when you step into it and
[1:01:42] when will be the best time to do it and
[1:01:43] then how do you deal with situations as
[1:01:45] you move forward in finances and whatnot
[1:01:47] in the family that's why we're preaching
[1:01:49] it here is because we may not need it
[1:01:50] right now but we're going to need it
[1:01:52] very quickly i do believe amen so we
[1:01:54] want to set ourselves up for success in
[1:01:55] these things by preaching it before the
[1:01:57] need is so that you're ready and
[1:01:58] prepared for it so as you start to move
[1:02:00] into relationships as you start to get
[1:02:02] into marital age as you start to move
[1:02:04] into education as you start to move into
[1:02:06] the workforce you understand what the
[1:02:08] influences are and what the impacts are
[1:02:09] of your decisions as you move forward in
[1:02:11] life amen
[1:02:12] our sisters need to know how to pick a
[1:02:14] proper husband because remember the man
[1:02:16] asks but the woman accepts and she needs
[1:02:19] to know if that man is going to be a
[1:02:20] good provider for her and then she needs
[1:02:22] to know if he's got the characteristics
[1:02:23] of the providing husband and if she
[1:02:25] steps in without him being that then she
[1:02:27] may pay a price for it later
[1:02:29] now we're not going to cover all of it
[1:02:30] today i've got a relatively short stack
[1:02:32] of notes here but we'll pick up some of
[1:02:34] this certainly when i come back but the
[1:02:36] beautiful thing about this is that you
[1:02:37] don't have to hear my opinion the word
[1:02:39] speaks to everything that i've just
[1:02:41] mentioned there is nothing that i've
[1:02:43] just talked about that the word doesn't
[1:02:44] tell us amen so we've got word answers
[1:02:48] so i'm not going to be sitting up here
[1:02:49] saying i think or i believe i'm going to
[1:02:51] be pointing us back to scriptures amen
[1:02:53] i'm going to take us back to the word
[1:02:54] because we have examples for what men do
[1:02:57] we have examples for what women do in
[1:02:59] the workforce in provision when things
[1:03:00] get tough we have all of it in the
[1:03:02] scriptures if we'll only look and to me
[1:03:04] if we only get one example in the
[1:03:05] scripture that's enough and then if god
[1:03:07] tells us once that's enough we don't
[1:03:09] have to do it two or three times if he
[1:03:10] only says it once that's good enough for
[1:03:12] me but we have examples for everything
[1:03:14] in this amen so i'm not preaching down
[1:03:16] to anyone i'm going to use myself for
[1:03:18] the bad examples today
[1:03:20] amen so i'm going to put myself out
[1:03:21] there for ridicule and and these
[1:03:23] different things and we'll talk a little
[1:03:25] bit about about me and my marriage and
[1:03:27] some of the decisions i've made because
[1:03:29] i'm preaching one thing but i haven't
[1:03:30] always lived what i've preached amen
[1:03:32] we're all like that we're all like that
[1:03:34] we've we always want to do the best but
[1:03:36] we don't always do the best if i can put
[1:03:38] it that way amen so we aren't perfect if
[1:03:40] we're lucky we've been raised in a
[1:03:41] christian home with good parents with
[1:03:43] good mentors with strong ministry and
[1:03:45] these different things and if we're
[1:03:46] really blessed we get the holy ghost
[1:03:48] early on in our life and that gives us
[1:03:49] at least a fighting chance in some of
[1:03:51] these things amen but satan is trying to
[1:03:53] attack us on every front and the first
[1:03:55] place he's going to go for young people
[1:03:56] is going to be as soon as they start
[1:03:57] looking at marriage there's where your
[1:03:59] biggest battle is going to be is do you
[1:04:01] get the right one up front because if
[1:04:02] you don't you're in for a life of
[1:04:04] serious unpleasantry amen it's going to
[1:04:07] be very difficult
[1:04:08] amen we don't know in the end what we
[1:04:10] don't know like i said and we step into
[1:04:12] some of these things and and we're young
[1:04:14] at best like we said last time when
[1:04:16] you're a young person you're usually
[1:04:17] just around here you've had faith enough
[1:04:19] to believe christ for your your
[1:04:21] salvation you've got the holy ghost and
[1:04:23] you're starting to work through this and
[1:04:25] yet when we step into something like
[1:04:26] marriage if we could step in up here we
[1:04:28] do it we do great but unfortunately we
[1:04:31] usually step around here and so we've
[1:04:32] got to have an understanding of what
[1:04:34] satan's going to try and hit us with as
[1:04:36] we go into these things amen
[1:04:38] now when it comes to that marriage
[1:04:39] decision and we're going to spend only a
[1:04:40] very short period of this time and i'm
[1:04:42] going to pick a scripture that's
[1:04:44] probably going to make you laugh about
[1:04:46] what this decision looks like
[1:04:48] and it's luke 14 31.
[1:04:51] this is your marriage decision right
[1:04:52] here
[1:04:56] it says are what king
[1:04:57] going to make war against another king
[1:05:00] sitteth not down first and consulteth
[1:05:02] whether he be able with ten thousand to
[1:05:04] meet him that cometh against him with
[1:05:07] twenty thousand
[1:05:08] now that's a weird scripture for
[1:05:09] marriage isn't it
[1:05:11] all the married couples giggled because
[1:05:13] they think we're talking about marriages
[1:05:14] fighting and no no no i know they're not
[1:05:17] but what are we talking about we're
[1:05:18] talking about make sure you have what's
[1:05:20] needed to get to the finish line or to
[1:05:22] get to the goal before you step into it
[1:05:24] in the first place that's what he's
[1:05:25] talking you don't start to build a house
[1:05:27] unless you know you've got the funds to
[1:05:29] build the house to the end amen
[1:05:30] otherwise you're going to end up with a
[1:05:31] half-built house that you can't use and
[1:05:33] all your money sunk into it and you've
[1:05:34] got nothing to really show for it amen
[1:05:37] listen to this one in three first-time
[1:05:39] marriages doesn't work
[1:05:42] you got a 33 chance of failing in your
[1:05:44] marriage from the get-go now you say
[1:05:46] we're in the message we don't believe in
[1:05:47] divorce we don't believe in these things
[1:05:48] doesn't matter look around there's lots
[1:05:50] of people haven't made it including my
[1:05:52] own mother and father amen so there's no
[1:05:54] guarantee that you're going to get it
[1:05:56] right so know this that when you step
[1:05:57] into marriage when you step into a
[1:05:59] relationship that you are on a battle
[1:06:01] zone and not with each other but rather
[1:06:02] satan's going to be trying to get in
[1:06:04] there to get your eyes off the word to
[1:06:06] get your eyes on each other's flaws and
[1:06:07] failures and try and drive a wedge
[1:06:09] inside there and push you apart amen
[1:06:12] amen now for this scripture i'm going to
[1:06:14] use myself as an example because i got
[1:06:16] married when i was 21 and i completed
[1:06:19] four years of a six-year engineering
[1:06:20] degree my wife and i have been courting
[1:06:22] for nearly four years when she accepted
[1:06:25] my proposal of marriage so i had two
[1:06:27] years left of university now look at
[1:06:28] that situation i have no stable job
[1:06:32] i have a difficulty to provide a steady
[1:06:34] income because i'm going to be studying
[1:06:36] and my engineering degree is not
[1:06:38] completed so my career is not guaranteed
[1:06:40] beyond that point and there's no
[1:06:42] guarantee that i'll even finish that
[1:06:43] once i get married so that's what i did
[1:06:46] that's the situation i was in when i
[1:06:49] proposed to my wife amen now if we are
[1:06:51] wise
[1:06:52] we would have said wait the extra two
[1:06:54] years and get married then at least
[1:06:56] you've got what a career you can step
[1:06:58] right into the workforce you've got a
[1:07:00] way of making money in these different
[1:07:01] things but unlike brother joe and sister
[1:07:03] priscilla we did not do that and we
[1:07:05] elected to get married with still some
[1:07:07] time left before that was done now on
[1:07:09] the other hand my wife was looking at me
[1:07:11] and she has no proof that i'm going to
[1:07:13] be a great husband
[1:07:14] in terms of the provider role and that's
[1:07:15] really what we're talking about these
[1:07:17] days and then she's looking at that and
[1:07:18] she sees a guy that's gotten great
[1:07:20] grades that seems to be a hard worker
[1:07:23] but at the same time i haven't proved
[1:07:25] myself yet right i've held some jobs
[1:07:27] down through the summer and these
[1:07:28] different things and and some
[1:07:30] internships and what now that and i've
[1:07:31] done well in them but i still have
[1:07:33] improved my constancy i mean i haven't
[1:07:35] proved that i'm able to commit to a job
[1:07:37] and do the daily grind you know from
[1:07:39] eight to five every day no matter what
[1:07:41] to take the low salaries and the the
[1:07:42] tough gigs and the work that you don't
[1:07:44] really enjoy and whatnot i haven't
[1:07:45] proven myself for that but she looks in
[1:07:48] there and she's saying does he look like
[1:07:49] he's going to do it and she has to make
[1:07:51] a calculated decision when she did it
[1:07:53] and of course we know that she decided
[1:07:55] to go for it because she accepted my
[1:07:57] proposal of marriage but knowing that i
[1:07:59] was going to have to go right back to
[1:08:01] school within
[1:08:03] eight months
[1:08:04] meant that we had made a decision up
[1:08:06] front for my wife to go into the
[1:08:08] workforce as soon as she could because
[1:08:10] it was going to be difficult for me to
[1:08:12] provide for the family while doing a
[1:08:14] full-time engineering degree so we in we
[1:08:16] literally invited strain into our
[1:08:19] marriage from the get-go
[1:08:21] because why
[1:08:22] it wasn't according to the perfect
[1:08:24] pattern
[1:08:25] amen we did not go into this into the
[1:08:27] word pattern where the man is set up to
[1:08:29] provide for the household we went in for
[1:08:31] a man that is looking to but in all
[1:08:33] probability is not going to be able to
[1:08:35] provide for the family in the fullness
[1:08:36] that's required amen
[1:08:38] so what happens when we don't match the
[1:08:40] perfect type
[1:08:42] we pay a price amen and we did pay a
[1:08:44] price
[1:08:45] and i said this last service and it
[1:08:46] bears repeating amen when we leave the
[1:08:48] perfect type the perfect way the perfect
[1:08:50] plan when we leave the word pattern we
[1:08:52] always pay a price and that goes whether
[1:08:55] we're talking about providers whether
[1:08:56] we're talking about anything when we get
[1:08:58] off the word a price has to be paid and
[1:09:00] then somebody always has to pay and
[1:09:02] guess who pays
[1:09:03] it's the innocent it's the innocent that
[1:09:06] pay it's not the one that's doing that
[1:09:07] work
[1:09:08] proverbs 22 8 says he that soweth
[1:09:10] iniquity shall reap vanity now iniquity
[1:09:14] we know is when you do what you know
[1:09:15] you're not supposed to do
[1:09:17] now sometimes that's not strict
[1:09:19] disobedience it's partial disobedience
[1:09:21] where you say i'm going to do most of it
[1:09:22] but i'm not going to do all of it well
[1:09:24] that little bit of all of it
[1:09:26] is called iniquity when you know not to
[1:09:28] do it but you do it the amplified says
[1:09:30] he who sows iniquity will reap calamity
[1:09:34] and futility
[1:09:36] now i thought that was interesting
[1:09:37] because in other words he's saying if
[1:09:39] you know to do better and you ignore it
[1:09:41] then you're not going to get the results
[1:09:42] that you were expecting
[1:09:45] and you're going to reap something else
[1:09:46] instead
[1:09:47] now you may get what you were expecting
[1:09:49] in the sense of for us we got the
[1:09:51] finances we needed but what we didn't
[1:09:53] know was what else was going to come
[1:09:54] with that amen because we're sowing
[1:09:56] something different than the word and so
[1:09:58] we're going to get something different
[1:09:59] than the word in it now we got the
[1:10:01] finances and that was great but we know
[1:10:03] that according to the word when you give
[1:10:05] way to something else over the word then
[1:10:07] something important to the word is going
[1:10:09] to take a hit amen the blessing of god
[1:10:11] the protection of god the provision of
[1:10:12] god whatever it looks like something
[1:10:14] else is going to give on the word side
[1:10:16] if you get off of the word it's every
[1:10:18] time anytime you let something from the
[1:10:20] word slide then something that's in the
[1:10:21] word will also slide out the other way
[1:10:23] somebody's got to pay the price
[1:10:24] something's got to give amen
[1:10:27] and chances are the thing that's got to
[1:10:28] give is going to matter more to god amen
[1:10:31] it's going to be something that matters
[1:10:32] more to him
[1:10:33] hosea 10 says sow to yourselves in
[1:10:36] righteousness and reap in mercy
[1:10:39] break up your fallow ground for it is
[1:10:41] time to seek the lord till he come and
[1:10:44] reign righteousness upon you ye have
[1:10:46] plowed wickedness ye have reaped
[1:10:48] iniquity you have eaten the fruit of
[1:10:50] lies because thou distrust in thy way in
[1:10:52] the ulti in the multitude of thy mighty
[1:10:54] men remember we're talking about me here
[1:10:56] okay so what if you sow in righteousness
[1:11:00] if you do it the way he wants you to do
[1:11:01] then he can do what he can provide but
[1:11:03] if you sow your own way then you're
[1:11:05] going to reap something else
[1:11:08] galatians 6 says be not deceived god is
[1:11:10] not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth
[1:11:13] that shall he also reap now that's a
[1:11:15] curse and a blessing isn't it because if
[1:11:16] you sow by the word you'll reap by the
[1:11:19] word and if you sow by your own way then
[1:11:21] you'll reap by your own way and the only
[1:11:22] way to gather something different than
[1:11:24] what you've sown is to sow something
[1:11:26] else
[1:11:27] amen you've got to sow something
[1:11:28] different to get something different you
[1:11:30] can't sow something and get something
[1:11:32] different than what you've you've sowed
[1:11:33] you can't reap something different than
[1:11:35] what you sowed amen somebody else can
[1:11:37] give something to you but you can't reap
[1:11:39] of your own thing that you sowed amen
[1:11:40] any different than what you put in there
[1:11:42] if you planted apples you can't reap
[1:11:44] peaches amen if you sow wheat you can't
[1:11:46] reap barley right and if you sow sin you
[1:11:48] can't reap faith
[1:11:49] amen and if you sow against the word you
[1:11:51] can't reap the word at any point
[1:11:54] he says for he that soweth to his flesh
[1:11:57] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[1:11:59] he that soweth to the spirit shall of
[1:12:01] the spirit reap life everlasting and let
[1:12:04] us not be weary in well-doing for in due
[1:12:07] season we shall reap if we faint not now
[1:12:10] i find it's interesting that there is no
[1:12:12] fear of fainting or being weary when
[1:12:13] we're sowing to our flesh
[1:12:15] have you ever noticed that we never get
[1:12:18] tired about doing things that this flesh
[1:12:20] really enjoys do
[1:12:21] we'll do that all day long our kids will
[1:12:23] sit in front of movies for 15 hours a
[1:12:25] day if we let them and they won't get
[1:12:27] weary they'll they'll fall asleep
[1:12:30] of of complete and total exhaustion at
[1:12:33] midnight maybe if we let them watching
[1:12:36] movies
[1:12:37] right but get them to do something
[1:12:39] healthy like play sports
[1:12:41] right like go have fellowship play lego
[1:12:44] build something and they're done after
[1:12:46] 30 minutes
[1:12:47] they get weary and well doing don't they
[1:12:50] what the flesh is never the struggle
[1:12:51] it's the things that are of the spirit
[1:12:53] the things that are of the word that are
[1:12:55] difficult for us to keep doing amen we
[1:12:57] have so much patience and energy and
[1:12:59] drive and passion for things that are
[1:13:01] fun or enjoyable to the flesh but we
[1:13:03] lack that same constancy that same
[1:13:05] patience that same endurance when it
[1:13:06] comes to the things that are in
[1:13:08] well-doing as the scripture says amen
[1:13:10] god help us to be rugged in the faithful
[1:13:12] things of well-doing amen amen
[1:13:14] but the point in all of this is that
[1:13:16] what make the word decision reap the
[1:13:18] word benefit that's what we're talking
[1:13:20] about tonight make the not so word
[1:13:22] decision
[1:13:23] reap the not so word benefit amen
[1:13:26] now like i said my wife and i made a
[1:13:27] conscious decision to add strain to our
[1:13:29] marriage by putting her into the
[1:13:31] workforce shortly after we got married
[1:13:33] and so
[1:13:34] it's never a good thing if anybody's
[1:13:36] interested adding strain early on to a
[1:13:38] marriage is never a good thing
[1:13:41] right we're young
[1:13:43] we're impressionable we don't know
[1:13:44] anything we have no practical experience
[1:13:47] in marriage and then you add strain to
[1:13:48] that then something's going to break at
[1:13:50] some point amen and what did we say we
[1:13:52] said it'll just be temporary we can
[1:13:54] handle it it's only two years we'll make
[1:13:56] it through it won't be a big deal and
[1:13:58] we'll come out on the other side we'll
[1:13:59] laugh about it that's what we said
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:02] and by the time she got her permanent
[1:14:04] residence and could work i was back in
[1:14:05] school and she was not working days she
[1:14:07] was working nights
[1:14:09] amen i'd drop her off in the evening
[1:14:11] pick her up in the morning and then i
[1:14:12] take her home and i rub her feet because
[1:14:14] she was working at tim horton's night
[1:14:15] shift doing the baking every night so
[1:14:18] she's on her feet for eight and a half
[1:14:20] hours every night i'd bring her home rub
[1:14:22] her feet for a little bit put her to bed
[1:14:24] then i'd jump off the school i'd be gone
[1:14:26] all day i'd come back and then we'd have
[1:14:28] a little bit of time together and then
[1:14:30] i'd have to hit the books to study and
[1:14:31] then i'd drive her in at you know 11
[1:14:33] o'clock 11 30 at night for her shift so
[1:14:35] we had this big disconnect between when
[1:14:38] i had time and when i had energy and
[1:14:40] when she had time and when she had
[1:14:41] energy so that's going to add strain to
[1:14:43] the marriage amen and even though you're
[1:14:45] young and in love and and things you
[1:14:47] know it's honeymoonish and all these
[1:14:49] different things it's still adding
[1:14:50] difficulty because there's a we're not
[1:14:52] on the same timeline we're not doing the
[1:14:54] same things together and whatnot i'm
[1:14:56] going to bed alone and she's going to
[1:14:58] bed alone and we never see each other
[1:15:00] and then there's no physical connection
[1:15:01] there's no emotional connection you're
[1:15:03] kind of just ships passing by each other
[1:15:04] in the night half the time amen
[1:15:09] what is it we left the word pattern and
[1:15:11] we did it willingly we did it willingly
[1:15:13] we said it's better for us to marry
[1:15:16] than for us to be a part and we're
[1:15:18] willing to take the pain of being
[1:15:20] married at a time when we shouldn't
[1:15:22] really be married
[1:15:23] so we made the choice
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:26] so
[1:15:27] two years later who comes along
[1:15:30] selena
[1:15:31] right out of nowhere selena appears
[1:15:34] so now what do we do i'm still doing my
[1:15:36] degree and now my wife can no longer
[1:15:38] work
[1:15:39] and now we need the finances that she
[1:15:41] doesn't have the ability to produce
[1:15:44] so what did i have to do i had to try
[1:15:46] and get a job to provide in the meantime
[1:15:48] and so i got a job with a company that i
[1:15:50] work with in one of my internships and i
[1:15:52] actually held down a 32 hour a week job
[1:15:55] for for a great deal of that time amen
[1:15:57] and god provided for it now the simple
[1:15:59] question sort of is why didn't we just
[1:16:01] do that in the first place
[1:16:03] why didn't we
[1:16:05] because it was easier to put her in than
[1:16:06] it was easier to put me in
[1:16:08] right had nothing to do with what does
[1:16:10] the word actually tell john to do we
[1:16:12] said it's easier for her to do it than
[1:16:13] for me to do it and she said i'm going
[1:16:15] to help you you know i'm going to do my
[1:16:17] part i don't have a ton to do at home
[1:16:18] you know these different things so i'll
[1:16:20] step in there she's willing to help
[1:16:22] but the simple fact is the word way
[1:16:24] should have been for me to shoulder the
[1:16:25] load and get in there that would have
[1:16:27] been tough and it was tough when i
[1:16:28] finally got into it but we also see that
[1:16:30] god can provide those things and he can
[1:16:32] make a way for me to do what i should
[1:16:33] have been doing all along now that would
[1:16:36] have added stress to our marriage but we
[1:16:37] would have had a promise to go back to
[1:16:39] because i was doing exactly what i was
[1:16:40] supposed to be doing but in the meantime
[1:16:42] you're struggling through different
[1:16:43] things and you don't really have the
[1:16:45] same thing to go back to because you're
[1:16:47] out of the word of god and when you're
[1:16:48] out of the word of god then you're
[1:16:50] potentially out of the will of god of
[1:16:51] course amen now
[1:16:53] we love the fact that we both have
[1:16:55] contributed to where we are today i
[1:16:57] don't have anything by my own
[1:16:59] achievement i have it because my wife
[1:17:01] has helped me in those things amen i
[1:17:03] have a finished degree because she
[1:17:04] helped me in it and she's she's worked
[1:17:06] with me through all my life and and
[1:17:08] these different things so i didn't get
[1:17:10] there i didn't come in with everything
[1:17:11] and then just added her to the mix sort
[1:17:13] of thing we've built our life together
[1:17:15] and that's forged a great deal of
[1:17:16] strength in our marriage maybe in a way
[1:17:18] that some younger couples won't have
[1:17:19] because they haven't had to go through
[1:17:21] the fire that quickly the simple fact is
[1:17:23] though that we could have easily just as
[1:17:25] a i mean it wasn't that bad folks i'm
[1:17:26] not you know it wasn't brutal but with
[1:17:29] some people they that would have put
[1:17:30] them into divorce after two years
[1:17:32] because of the strain because of the
[1:17:33] disconnect
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:35] so when you step into that you've got to
[1:17:37] know that something's going to give and
[1:17:38] something did give and something will
[1:17:39] give every time we make the less than
[1:17:41] perfect decision and that's all we're
[1:17:43] talking about amen but i want to also
[1:17:45] say this that it's not usually going to
[1:17:47] kill you
[1:17:48] and then it's not going to kill you
[1:17:49] you're not going to die if you do things
[1:17:50] less than perfectly i'm not advocating
[1:17:52] getting off the word i'm saying that
[1:17:54] there's a grace for it if i can put it
[1:17:55] that way because we didn't think too
[1:17:58] much if i was to be honest we didn't
[1:17:59] think too much about whether i should do
[1:18:00] it or she should do it the idea was
[1:18:02] john's at school all day and then he's
[1:18:04] going to be studying all night and so
[1:18:05] therefore it makes sense for her to do
[1:18:06] the work right and we we elected to do
[1:18:09] that we didn't even look that closely at
[1:18:10] the word i think if i was to think about
[1:18:12] it we just didn't think about it but i'm
[1:18:14] telling you today think about it because
[1:18:16] somebody's got to pay a price at some
[1:18:18] point and it can be a relationship it
[1:18:20] can be a person it can be these
[1:18:21] different things amen
[1:18:24] but the simple fact is is that there is
[1:18:26] grace for these things
[1:18:27] for less than perfect situations there
[1:18:29] are often less than perfect answers and
[1:18:31] god has grace for it i've always taken
[1:18:33] great comfort from this scripture and
[1:18:34] it's romans 8 28 we all know it it says
[1:18:36] and we know that all things work
[1:18:38] together for good to them that love god
[1:18:41] that's it
[1:18:42] that's it all things work together for
[1:18:44] good it doesn't say that we have to be
[1:18:46] in his perfect will for him to work it
[1:18:47] out to our good doesn't mean we have to
[1:18:49] be perfect for him to work it out for
[1:18:51] good it says we know that all things
[1:18:54] work together for good to them that love
[1:18:56] god
[1:18:56] and that's it that's simple and i can
[1:18:58] take great rest in that it says to them
[1:19:00] who are the called according to his
[1:19:02] purpose now i've been listening to it
[1:19:04] greater than solomon is here and brother
[1:19:05] braham says this about jonah he says
[1:19:07] let's find out if the footsteps of the
[1:19:09] righteous isn't ordered of the lord and
[1:19:12] if we're trusting him with all our heart
[1:19:15] though we make a mistake god will make
[1:19:18] it work around to his glory
[1:19:20] now he's talking about jonah
[1:19:23] he's talking about jonah and jonas and
[1:19:25] brother brown said people like to pick
[1:19:26] on jonah
[1:19:27] because he disobeyed god he said did you
[1:19:30] know jonah was in the perfect will of
[1:19:32] god
[1:19:33] why because god knew his prophet's
[1:19:36] response to his request and he knew that
[1:19:38] he was going to run that he would refuse
[1:19:40] to do what god asked he knew he was
[1:19:42] going to get on a boat he knew that he
[1:19:44] was going to create a storm that would
[1:19:46] force jonah to say kick me off the boat
[1:19:48] so the storm will be calmed and then he
[1:19:50] knew that he would have a fish or a
[1:19:51] whale prepared for him jonah could go in
[1:19:54] and then after three days and jonah
[1:19:55] praying and repenting that fish or that
[1:19:58] whale would spit him out onto the beach
[1:20:00] and jonah would walk out onto dry land
[1:20:02] from the mouth of the god of the people
[1:20:04] of nineveh
[1:20:05] because god wanted him in the whale's
[1:20:07] mouth
[1:20:08] he wanted him to walk out of their god's
[1:20:10] mouth so they could say this guy ain't
[1:20:12] just a normal man i mean this is coming
[1:20:14] from our god and they'd listen to him
[1:20:16] maybe in a way that they wouldn't before
[1:20:19] amen that's why i say in all of this we
[1:20:21] have to have grace for one another we
[1:20:23] don't have to condone poor decisions
[1:20:26] but we can show grace and mercy to the
[1:20:28] people that do it amen because what i'm
[1:20:30] putting myself up here to say i haven't
[1:20:32] always made them i won't always make
[1:20:34] them i'll make mistakes so we've got to
[1:20:36] have grace for somebody without
[1:20:38] condoning what they're doing they've got
[1:20:39] to learn their own way amen we're
[1:20:42] raising children guess what do our
[1:20:43] children ever make mistakes after they
[1:20:45] come out for our household that we don't
[1:20:47] agree with all the parents can say yes
[1:20:49] they do
[1:20:50] but what do you do you commit them to
[1:20:52] god we've always committed them to god
[1:20:54] we're not here for legalistic children
[1:20:56] anyways right we commit them to god and
[1:20:58] we say god they're your children before
[1:20:59] they were ever mine and we're trusting
[1:21:01] you to work all things for their good
[1:21:04] even if they're blatantly in
[1:21:06] contradiction of the scripture
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] every one of us has blatantly gone
[1:21:10] against the word at some point i
[1:21:12] guarantee you whether our response has
[1:21:14] been wrong we've lied we've cheated
[1:21:16] we've said something about someone that
[1:21:18] we shouldn't we've believed a lie we've
[1:21:20] gossiped
[1:21:21] whatever it might be we've all done
[1:21:23] something amen we've all been blatantly
[1:21:24] wrong in the word and yet god in his
[1:21:26] tender and rich mercies has come around
[1:21:28] and brought us back to a place where he
[1:21:30] can restore us back to the word amen so
[1:21:32] he's looking for us to do the same thing
[1:21:35] to have that grace and mercy and trust
[1:21:37] him to work it out and let us keep our
[1:21:39] hands off of the situation amen it's a
[1:21:41] beautiful thing when we can back away
[1:21:43] and say god this one's yours
[1:21:45] i'm not going to do it you're going to
[1:21:46] have to do it amen amen
[1:21:48] blanc and i were certain and still are
[1:21:50] certain for the record that we were
[1:21:52] meant to be married
[1:21:54] but were we meant to be married at 20
[1:21:56] and 21 i have no idea
[1:21:58] all i can say is god has worked it
[1:22:00] around to something good amen and i
[1:22:02] trust that that's the grace that he's
[1:22:04] going to have for each and every one of
[1:22:05] our lives regardless of the decisions we
[1:22:07] make
[1:22:08] but
[1:22:09] be not mocked god is not mocked whatever
[1:22:12] we sow we're still going to reap
[1:22:14] but god can take that and still turn it
[1:22:16] into something good but we're still
[1:22:17] going to have to pay a price a sacrifice
[1:22:19] is still going to have to be made amen
[1:22:23] but if we realize we've made a wrong
[1:22:25] decision the big principle is this
[1:22:28] don't try and fix it by making another
[1:22:30] bad decision that's the problem is when
[1:22:32] we compound when we double down on our
[1:22:34] mistake when we compound and double down
[1:22:36] on our position on our belief whatever
[1:22:38] it is
[1:22:39] and we jump even further behind amen
[1:22:43] two two wrongs don't make a right isn't
[1:22:45] that what what the world says it's the
[1:22:47] same thing here don't do another thing
[1:22:49] that's off the word or the other thing
[1:22:50] that's off the word pattern can i say
[1:22:52] that off the word pattern don't do
[1:22:53] another thing off the word pattern to
[1:22:55] try and bring you back to the word it'll
[1:22:56] never work amen
[1:22:58] now i was talking to brother ellie about
[1:23:00] this this dowry situation
[1:23:02] you know in in the african countries in
[1:23:04] the arab countries in the asian
[1:23:06] countries they have a dowry system for
[1:23:08] brides
[1:23:09] and i'm starting to think this might be
[1:23:11] the way to go quite frankly
[1:23:14] but not for my boys because it is a
[1:23:16] tremendous strain
[1:23:18] but when we're talking about providers
[1:23:21] then what the per the dowry system is a
[1:23:24] great
[1:23:25] filter for who's a good provider isn't
[1:23:27] it because before that young man can
[1:23:30] ever get married he has to prove that he
[1:23:33] has the stability to financially provide
[1:23:35] for that young woman
[1:23:38] now when we look at some of the biggest
[1:23:40] things that we deal with in marriage
[1:23:42] finances is one of the top three and so
[1:23:44] in a dowry system while not perfect it
[1:23:47] helps to eliminate at least one of those
[1:23:49] things up front and that's that he
[1:23:51] proves that he can be committed to a
[1:23:53] goal that he can focus on saving and
[1:23:56] putting something in priority and
[1:23:59] holding to it until he gets it it also
[1:24:01] shows how much he values that young
[1:24:03] woman
[1:24:04] because if he's running around and he's
[1:24:06] getting vacations and he's buying nice
[1:24:08] cars and he's doing all sorts of flashy
[1:24:10] things and having fun and buying man
[1:24:12] toys
[1:24:13] then guess what that dowry's not going
[1:24:14] to come very quickly is it and that
[1:24:16] young lady knows exactly where she
[1:24:18] stands in his heart
[1:24:19] but if he is sitting at home and he is
[1:24:22] working day in and day out and every
[1:24:24] dollar that he has is going to provide
[1:24:27] for the dowry so his love can come and
[1:24:29] live with him then she knows that she is
[1:24:31] a priority in his life and there is a
[1:24:33] now an outward sign of an inward love
[1:24:36] that he is showing not only to her but
[1:24:38] to her family so that the father has
[1:24:40] confidence that this young man is going
[1:24:42] to provide for my daughter amen it's a
[1:24:45] beautiful thing
[1:24:46] when
[1:24:47] it's applied properly amen
[1:24:49] so again i'm not endorsing it
[1:24:52] but it's a beautiful way to screen isn't
[1:24:54] it now that has nothing to do with
[1:24:56] spirituality amen and that's where you
[1:24:58] need a strong father that's where you
[1:24:59] need a strong pastor just to to have the
[1:25:02] insight in the and and the uh the
[1:25:04] discernment to look at that young man
[1:25:06] and say is he is he gonna provide in the
[1:25:08] other ways because you have to provide
[1:25:10] physically but you also have to provide
[1:25:12] spiritually and if you provide
[1:25:14] physically and you don't provide
[1:25:15] spiritually then god help you
[1:25:17] amen
[1:25:18] if i had to pick one i'd pick a lazy
[1:25:19] spiritual husband rather than
[1:25:21] an unspiritual well-providing husband
[1:25:24] amen we want to get to glory and that's
[1:25:25] the thing that matters most and if your
[1:25:27] husband's on spiritual then it's going
[1:25:28] to have a real a real strain on your
[1:25:30] walk with god that's for sure
[1:25:32] amen but the three most common problem
[1:25:35] areas in marriage are money
[1:25:36] and that's due to differing priorities
[1:25:38] overspending and a lifestyle bigger than
[1:25:40] your income
[1:25:41] the second thing is intimacy physical
[1:25:44] especially for men and emotional
[1:25:46] especially for women and the third thing
[1:25:48] is communication mainly the inability to
[1:25:51] share feelings express concerns or
[1:25:53] disagree without being offended that's
[1:25:56] the three areas that satan tends to hit
[1:25:58] on those that are married
[1:26:00] or about to get married those are going
[1:26:02] to be prime considerations obviously not
[1:26:04] the physical intimacy side amen
[1:26:06] but knowing that those are the key areas
[1:26:08] of marriage when we get into situations
[1:26:10] where we ask our wives to start working
[1:26:12] then we have to ask which of these areas
[1:26:15] is going to take a hit because these are
[1:26:16] the top three and which one's going to
[1:26:18] take a hit when we move somebody that is
[1:26:20] supposed to be primarily engaged in one
[1:26:22] role and we move her into or we ask her
[1:26:25] to move into a different role
[1:26:27] something's gotta hit something's gotta
[1:26:28] go right something's gotta give and then
[1:26:31] you can't have your wife working at 150
[1:26:33] percent of her capacity and you expect
[1:26:35] her to do everything that you want her
[1:26:36] to do she can't do it she ain't
[1:26:38] superwoman right she doesn't have a
[1:26:40] movie about her
[1:26:41] right you can't expect her to do
[1:26:43] everything the word asks her to do and
[1:26:45] then everything that you ask her to do
[1:26:47] in the workplace
[1:26:48] and she do it she can't do it she's not
[1:26:51] built to do it any more than your built
[1:26:53] to do all the cooking and cleaning and
[1:26:55] all those other things and raising the
[1:26:56] children and go work amen you both got a
[1:26:59] dedicated primary role and when you push
[1:27:01] or pull or ask to to go full-time into
[1:27:04] something or even part-time as the case
[1:27:06] may be something's got to give
[1:27:08] something's got to give and she's going
[1:27:09] to have to be
[1:27:11] you're going to have to be able to say
[1:27:13] i'm ok with that
[1:27:14] because something's going to give and
[1:27:15] again it's usually the innocent that pay
[1:27:17] for those things amen
[1:27:21] the funny thing is so often when we ask
[1:27:23] our wives to step into the workforce
[1:27:25] and we say well the scripture doesn't
[1:27:27] forbid it we're going to read where
[1:27:28] brother braham says it we say the
[1:27:29] scripture doesn't forbid her to go into
[1:27:31] the workforce
[1:27:32] it's true
[1:27:33] but the scripture says a lot about what
[1:27:35] she's supposed to be doing and let's not
[1:27:37] forget that amen it says she's supposed
[1:27:39] to be at home it says she's supposed to
[1:27:40] be taking care of the children raising
[1:27:41] the children taking care of the
[1:27:43] household these different things so when
[1:27:44] we take her out of that and we put her
[1:27:46] someplace else we're not we're not
[1:27:47] telling her to do something that the
[1:27:49] word forbids but we are taking her away
[1:27:51] from doing something that the word does
[1:27:52] tell her to do amen and that's often
[1:27:54] what's forgotten is the sisters often
[1:27:56] say or the husbands is the case maybe
[1:27:58] say the word doesn't forbid it yes but
[1:28:00] the word does have a command for our
[1:28:01] sisters and then there's a place that
[1:28:03] they're supposed to be and when we take
[1:28:04] them out of that then there's a price
[1:28:06] that has to be paid in those situations
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:09] amen but let's presume for a second that
[1:28:12] we haven't made all the right decisions
[1:28:13] let's presume you're like me and you
[1:28:14] haven't made all the right decisions
[1:28:16] that you've made mistakes and and you've
[1:28:18] gotten off of the perfect pattern at
[1:28:20] different times amen and let's look at
[1:28:22] what the prophet said i had five pages
[1:28:25] and i'm going to replace it with one and
[1:28:26] it's one big quote from brother branham
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] let's i figure if there's an opinion out
[1:28:31] there
[1:28:32] let's use his rather than mine i think
[1:28:34] that'll work a little better amen
[1:28:36] again not directed at anyone but it's
[1:28:39] directed to what's coming down the road
[1:28:40] for our young women and our young men
[1:28:42] especially okay
[1:28:44] brother branham are women allowed to
[1:28:46] work in public affairs when they have a
[1:28:47] healthy husband and children
[1:28:50] now he's talking to wives not to women
[1:28:52] he's talking to wives okay
[1:28:54] and he says well i don't know about that
[1:28:56] i can't say but i just have this feeling
[1:29:00] now watch so this is brother branham's
[1:29:02] opinion
[1:29:03] this is not the word this is not
[1:29:05] scripturally based in its totality he
[1:29:08] says i have this feeling
[1:29:10] now let me say this i believe if i was a
[1:29:12] woman and i know that my husband was
[1:29:14] healthy and had a good job working i
[1:29:16] believe it would be a great pleasure to
[1:29:18] me to stay home take care of my children
[1:29:20] and raise them up and love the lord and
[1:29:23] the church said amen
[1:29:24] and if i had any time for my washing and
[1:29:27] things i was going to do i think i would
[1:29:29] teach my children how to serve the lord
[1:29:31] because one of the things that that
[1:29:32] we'll hear is that well i've got some
[1:29:34] spare time
[1:29:36] no mother ever said that ever but just
[1:29:38] in case they did he says if you've got
[1:29:40] any spare time then teach them how to
[1:29:42] serve and love the lord
[1:29:44] and then if on top of all the daily
[1:29:46] chores and the errands and the work of
[1:29:47] upkeeping the house and and getting the
[1:29:49] kids out the door and that if there's
[1:29:51] any spare time in it then use that to
[1:29:53] teach your children how to serve the
[1:29:55] lord amen
[1:29:56] now listen to what he says here now if
[1:29:58] you've got a debt or something that
[1:30:00] you're trying to help your husband pay
[1:30:01] for or something you have to do that
[1:30:04] well i think that's fine if you'll try
[1:30:06] to help him
[1:30:08] and you live a lady he says and i think
[1:30:10] it's hard
[1:30:11] no man that's got good understanding
[1:30:13] wants his wife to get in a bunch where
[1:30:15] there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and
[1:30:17] things like that
[1:30:19] and if the woman has to get in that i
[1:30:20] think her husband ought to know that
[1:30:22] she's a genuine christian that can be
[1:30:24] trusted a trustworthy woman so brother
[1:30:27] branham's opinion
[1:30:29] is that the only reason for a wife to go
[1:30:32] out into the workforce is if there's a
[1:30:34] debt or a true need in their family amen
[1:30:38] and then he puts a caveat at the end and
[1:30:40] he says it doesn't matter the need or
[1:30:43] the debt because if she's not
[1:30:44] trustworthy if she's flighty or if she's
[1:30:47] easily influenced don't put her out
[1:30:49] there no matter what don't put her in
[1:30:51] that situation you are first and
[1:30:52] foremost her protector
[1:30:54] and you do not sacrifice your wife for
[1:30:56] the sake of a debt or a need amen
[1:30:59] so he shouldn't be put in this situation
[1:31:01] if she can't handle it
[1:31:03] now i'm going to add something here i'm
[1:31:05] going to presume i think brother branham
[1:31:06] backs it up as we go in there but a debt
[1:31:08] is not the 50 000 truck you went out and
[1:31:11] bought yesterday
[1:31:12] and then it's not stuff he's talking
[1:31:14] about debts things that have to be paid
[1:31:17] not things you chose to incur debt over
[1:31:20] to pay amen this is not for toys this is
[1:31:22] not for living high on the hog amen this
[1:31:25] is about real needs that he's saying
[1:31:27] he says but now as to say that she
[1:31:29] shouldn't work i don't know see there's
[1:31:31] no scripture to back that up i'm just
[1:31:33] passing that opinion and he's right
[1:31:35] there's no scripture that says a woman
[1:31:37] can't and shouldn't work outside of the
[1:31:38] home and we actually see examples of her
[1:31:40] working outside the home and we'll get
[1:31:42] into that when we start talking about
[1:31:43] our sisters much later
[1:31:45] he says now i'm certainly against women
[1:31:47] working in these offices where all these
[1:31:50] businessmen that carry on tell them
[1:31:52] dirty jokes and a nice clean woman
[1:31:54] sitting there and all these smutty dirty
[1:31:55] things told around like that i'm against
[1:31:57] that i think you ought to come out from
[1:31:59] among such stuff is that so he said it's
[1:32:02] now a condition for you to put your wife
[1:32:04] into work there's an environment that
[1:32:06] she's supposed to be in it can't be a
[1:32:07] bunch of men standing around saying
[1:32:09] things they shouldn't be saying
[1:32:11] and these days
[1:32:12] these days it's not just the men
[1:32:15] it's the women as well amen there's a
[1:32:17] situation the situation is such these
[1:32:19] days that you don't know what you're
[1:32:20] dealing with in there and if you find
[1:32:22] out that that's the situation you need
[1:32:24] to pull your wife out amen
[1:32:26] he says don't put her in there don't
[1:32:28] force her into that situation amen and
[1:32:30] don't put her someplace where it's all
[1:32:32] men
[1:32:33] because when you do it what are you
[1:32:34] doing you're taking your wife out from
[1:32:36] under your headship and you're putting
[1:32:37] her under somebody else's that doesn't
[1:32:38] have the holy spirit more to the point
[1:32:40] that isn't anointed or elected or chosen
[1:32:43] to be her head
[1:32:44] and then now she's got two heads
[1:32:45] throughout the day and it's real
[1:32:47] difficult for her to keep that straight
[1:32:48] sometimes you're really putting pressure
[1:32:50] on her
[1:32:51] he says but now if a woman can hold
[1:32:53] herself as a real lady
[1:32:55] and trying to help her husband do
[1:32:57] something to meet some clothes for the
[1:32:59] kids to go to school or pay off a bill
[1:33:01] or something like that and she wants to
[1:33:03] work till that's over
[1:33:06] that's why i said he's not talking about
[1:33:07] 50 000 brand new f-150s we just bought
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:11] i hope nobody just bought an f-115
[1:33:14] right
[1:33:16] he's pointing to actual physical needs
[1:33:18] isn't he
[1:33:19] he's talking about your kids need
[1:33:21] clothes before they go to school he's
[1:33:23] talking about debts he's talking about
[1:33:24] something that has to be paid amen he's
[1:33:27] not saying go get the latest and
[1:33:28] greatest things in your life go for the
[1:33:30] bigger house go for the nicer car the
[1:33:31] better vacation the extra vacation no no
[1:33:34] he's saying you only do this when there
[1:33:36] is a great and desperate need within the
[1:33:38] family
[1:33:39] he says and notice this he puts a time
[1:33:42] stamp on it and he says what until it's
[1:33:45] over until the needs met keep her in
[1:33:47] there and then yank her out as soon as
[1:33:49] you can why she's not supposed to be in
[1:33:51] there and she's paying a price every day
[1:33:53] that she's in there and you're paying a
[1:33:54] price and the family's paying a price
[1:33:56] amen now remember at the beginning he
[1:33:58] said a wife that has a
[1:34:00] a healthy husband and children
[1:34:03] so there's two things there the
[1:34:04] husband's able to work and she's got
[1:34:05] children at home
[1:34:07] now you look at what he's saying here he
[1:34:09] still doesn't think the workplace is a
[1:34:10] great place for a woman to be in general
[1:34:12] but if there's a decent job available
[1:34:14] then he says have at it but he's still
[1:34:16] saying in general this is only for when
[1:34:18] there's a physical need in the family
[1:34:20] that has to be met
[1:34:22] then he says now this is not the lord
[1:34:24] because i have no scripture for this i
[1:34:25] love that i love that the prophet of god
[1:34:28] is sitting there and saying
[1:34:29] i can't tell you what to do
[1:34:31] and if he can't do it why would i
[1:34:32] presume to do it and why would brother
[1:34:34] gerald presume to do it amen not here to
[1:34:36] tell you what to do but i will take a
[1:34:38] prophet's experience over anybody else's
[1:34:40] as far as i can tell in this world amen
[1:34:42] i'll take a prophet's experience that's
[1:34:43] talked face-to-face with the angel of
[1:34:45] the lord on these types of situations
[1:34:47] that's why i took out my five pages of
[1:34:49] opinion and replaced it with one he also
[1:34:51] says it better than i do
[1:34:53] amen he says now to say that she
[1:34:55] shouldn't work i don't know see there's
[1:34:56] no scripture to back that up i'm just
[1:34:58] passing that opinion now i'm oh sorry
[1:35:01] now this is not the lord because i don't
[1:35:02] have no scripture for this i'm just
[1:35:04] saying that to be my opinion but
[1:35:06] otherwise i wouldn't think just because
[1:35:08] she wants to work just to run around and
[1:35:10] have more money to spend run around run
[1:35:13] to bar rooms or drink or smoke and carry
[1:35:16] on i don't think she should do it i
[1:35:18] think she should stay home try to be a
[1:35:20] lady and take care of her house what's
[1:35:23] he saying she's not out there to work to
[1:35:24] get more money to get more stuff to have
[1:35:27] more fun to have more vacations to get
[1:35:30] the latest clothes
[1:35:32] he says that is not the time or the
[1:35:34] place or the reason to have a wife
[1:35:36] sitting in a workforce amen
[1:35:40] now that's hard
[1:35:41] that's hard preaching brother branham he
[1:35:43] lays it pretty straight there doesn't he
[1:35:45] he lays it pretty straight now i could
[1:35:47] argue in my situation my wife was
[1:35:49] working because there was a real need
[1:35:51] but what happened i put her in the
[1:35:53] position for that need to be met by her
[1:35:56] i chose we chose together to do it but
[1:35:58] it was my decision to ask her to marry
[1:36:00] it was my decision to move into marriage
[1:36:02] as quickly as i did and i'm the one that
[1:36:04] put her into that position and i'm the
[1:36:06] one that put her into a place where she
[1:36:07] had to pay a price for it amen and what
[1:36:09] he's saying is man do you really want
[1:36:11] your wives to pay a price
[1:36:13] do you want to put her in a place where
[1:36:15] she's outside of the influence that
[1:36:16] she's supposed to be under
[1:36:18] do you really want to put her in there
[1:36:19] because she's going to pay a price and
[1:36:21] you're going to pay a price is it really
[1:36:22] worth it amen i think it's so good when
[1:36:25] we can work with other believers we can
[1:36:26] work with family members and these
[1:36:28] different things because at least we've
[1:36:29] got a guaranteed atmosphere if i can put
[1:36:31] it that way amen if you can work with
[1:36:33] other believers if you can have a
[1:36:34] believing boss amen brother paul if you
[1:36:37] can have a believing boss it's a
[1:36:38] wonderful thing
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:40] but if you've got to go out into the the
[1:36:43] the natural workforce if i can put it
[1:36:44] out in the world boy it's a tough place
[1:36:46] to be it's a tough place to be my own
[1:36:48] daughter just started work and she's
[1:36:49] lucky to work in a place where there's a
[1:36:51] lot of professing christians amen and
[1:36:53] they're clean
[1:36:54] but not everybody does it you can't work
[1:36:56] in retail anymore you can't work in
[1:36:58] retail anymore without dealing with all
[1:36:59] the smut and the nastiness and the
[1:37:01] disgusting things i mean i'm working a
[1:37:04] government job and i still deal with
[1:37:05] this sort of thing you know and the the
[1:37:07] different measures that they put in
[1:37:08] place and the the
[1:37:10] you know
[1:37:11] policies and whatnot it's a messed up
[1:37:13] world
[1:37:14] i mean it's tough enough on us brothers
[1:37:16] and we're supposed to be able to take it
[1:37:19] and then when we start asking the women
[1:37:20] to go in there scripture calls her the
[1:37:22] weaker vessel and then eve when she got
[1:37:25] out from around her husband what
[1:37:26] happened that's when she messed up
[1:37:27] wasn't it if she just stayed tight to
[1:37:29] him we wouldn't be where we are today i
[1:37:31] don't believe amen
[1:37:33] but i want to finish with some
[1:37:34] encouragement here
[1:37:35] because that's pretty straight stuff and
[1:37:37] again i'm glad we don't have i'm not
[1:37:39] preaching to a person here because we
[1:37:41] don't have that happening in this church
[1:37:42] amen but it's a warning to our brothers
[1:37:44] as you step into this or if you're in a
[1:37:46] situation where things are difficult
[1:37:48] this should be the last resort rather
[1:37:50] than the first resort amen we should go
[1:37:52] in anticipating and expecting that we
[1:37:54] will be the provider for the family's
[1:37:56] physical needs throughout our entire
[1:37:57] life amen that's the scriptural position
[1:38:01] but i want to show you how ingrained
[1:38:02] this provision is
[1:38:04] into the into christ and the types of
[1:38:05] christ that we see in the scripture in
[1:38:07] ruth chapter three this is remember
[1:38:09] they're on the threshing floor and naomi
[1:38:11] tells ruth she says go and lay down at
[1:38:12] boaz's feet and let him know that you
[1:38:15] know he's the kinsmen redeemer and tell
[1:38:16] him you want him to redeem you
[1:38:21] and verse 7 says and when boaz had eaten
[1:38:23] and drunk and his heart was merry he
[1:38:24] went to lie down at the end of the heap
[1:38:26] of corn and she came softly and
[1:38:28] uncovered his feet and laid her down and
[1:38:30] it came to pass at midnight that the man
[1:38:32] was afraid and turned himself and behold
[1:38:34] a woman lay at his feet
[1:38:36] and he said who art thou and she
[1:38:38] answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread
[1:38:40] therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid
[1:38:42] for thou art near kinsmen
[1:38:45] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[1:38:47] my daughter for thou has showed more
[1:38:49] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:38:51] beginning inasmuch as thou follows not
[1:38:53] young men whether rich or poor whether
[1:38:56] poor or rich sorry and now my daughter
[1:38:59] fear not i will do to thee all that thou
[1:39:02] requirest for all the city of my people
[1:39:04] that know that thou art a virtuous woman
[1:39:07] and now it is true that i am thy near
[1:39:09] kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman
[1:39:11] nearer than i
[1:39:13] tarry this night and it shall be in the
[1:39:15] morning that if he will perform unto
[1:39:17] thee the part of a kinsmen well let him
[1:39:19] do the kinsman's part but if he will not
[1:39:22] do the part of the kinsman to thee then
[1:39:24] will i do the part of a kinsman to thee
[1:39:25] as the lord liveth lie down until the
[1:39:28] morning
[1:39:29] and she lay at his feet until the
[1:39:30] morning and she rose up before one could
[1:39:33] know another and he said let it not be
[1:39:35] known that a woman came into the floor
[1:39:38] also he said bring the veil that thou
[1:39:40] hast upon thee and hold it and when she
[1:39:43] held it he measured six measures of
[1:39:45] barley and laid it on her and she went
[1:39:48] into the city
[1:39:50] and when she came to her mother-in-law
[1:39:52] she said who art thou my daughter and
[1:39:54] she told her all that the man had done
[1:39:56] to her and she said these six measures
[1:39:59] of barley gave he me for he said unto me
[1:40:02] go not empty into thy mother-in-law
[1:40:05] then said she sit still my daughter
[1:40:08] until they'll know how the matter will
[1:40:10] fall for the man will not be in rest
[1:40:14] until he had finished the thing
[1:40:16] this day
[1:40:18] now have you ever noticed that as soon
[1:40:20] as boaz committed to redeeming
[1:40:23] ruth
[1:40:24] what's the first thing that he did
[1:40:27] he provided for her
[1:40:29] he gave her something that would not
[1:40:31] require her to labor anymore because up
[1:40:34] to this point and we don't know how long
[1:40:35] ruth was there what was she doing every
[1:40:37] day she was laboring she was toiling she
[1:40:40] was doing back-breaking work to provide
[1:40:42] for her house for herself and naomi
[1:40:44] she's out in the fields doing the work
[1:40:46] of a man and he sees her out there doing
[1:40:48] it and everyone sees her doing it and
[1:40:50] they know she's got great work ethic and
[1:40:52] they know she's able to do it but as
[1:40:54] soon as he says you're going to be my
[1:40:56] wife as long as the other guy doesn't
[1:40:58] claim you then what does he do he says
[1:41:00] and because i'm committed to that i will
[1:41:02] provide for you until i come and get you
[1:41:05] amen
[1:41:06] i will provide for you until i come and
[1:41:08] get you that's how ingrained it was to
[1:41:10] be the provider for the men at that time
[1:41:13] a bow as we know was a type of christ
[1:41:15] amen there was a type of christ in all
[1:41:17] of this but i want you to notice the
[1:41:19] significance of the barley because how
[1:41:21] many measures did he give her
[1:41:23] he gave her six
[1:41:25] not five
[1:41:27] and not seven he gave her six why six
[1:41:30] if we look in exodus 20 we know that six
[1:41:33] represents mankind
[1:41:35] represents humanity and it represents
[1:41:38] our labor
[1:41:39] amen it says six days shalt thou labor
[1:41:42] and do all thy work but the seventh day
[1:41:44] is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it
[1:41:47] thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy
[1:41:49] son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor
[1:41:51] thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy
[1:41:53] stranger that is within thy gate the
[1:41:55] entire household doesn't do any work
[1:41:58] the six days everybody works but on the
[1:42:00] seventh you don't work anymore he says
[1:42:02] for in six days the lord made heaven and
[1:42:04] earth the sea and all that in them is
[1:42:06] and rested the seventh day wherefore the
[1:42:09] lord blessed the sabbath day and
[1:42:11] hallowed it what was boaz doing when he
[1:42:13] gave her six measures he was setting her
[1:42:15] up for rest he was setting her up for
[1:42:17] provision he was setting her up for
[1:42:19] stability he was setting her up so that
[1:42:21] she wouldn't have to work again under
[1:42:23] his house amen that he was now the great
[1:42:25] provider he was the great protector he
[1:42:28] was the one that was responsible for her
[1:42:30] and as soon as he committed he says you
[1:42:32] don't have to work anymore
[1:42:34] because the other guy was going to going
[1:42:36] to redeem her if he didn't so he knew
[1:42:38] somebody's going to take care of her but
[1:42:39] i've got to get her to that place as
[1:42:41] soon as i committed i'm going to commit
[1:42:43] to give her what she has need of until
[1:42:45] the time that i can come back to her
[1:42:47] why six
[1:42:48] because the seventh measure was boaz
[1:42:50] himself and then he comes back and he
[1:42:52] has what he has the shoe that says he
[1:42:54] told me he wouldn't take you so you're
[1:42:56] mine and now you can come to my house
[1:42:57] and you don't ever have to work a day in
[1:42:59] your life amen i will be the great
[1:43:00] provider i'm the one that knows what
[1:43:02] your needs are i know what you've done
[1:43:04] to this point but now you're under my
[1:43:07] house now you're under my authority and
[1:43:09] that authority gives me responsibility
[1:43:11] to make sure that you have every single
[1:43:13] thing that you have need of now that
[1:43:15] veil isn't used to carry now that bail
[1:43:17] is transferred to him and she doesn't
[1:43:18] have to carry any more because he's
[1:43:20] carrying the veil and then he's the one
[1:43:22] that fills
[1:43:23] her every need amen
[1:43:26] reminds me of the scripture we read last
[1:43:28] verse
[1:43:29] it said the lord is the portion of my
[1:43:31] inheritance
[1:43:32] and of my cup
[1:43:34] thou maintaineth my lot
[1:43:37] amen we've all got a portion
[1:43:39] we've all got gifts we've all got things
[1:43:41] that god has given us to do amen
[1:43:44] we've got attributes different things to
[1:43:45] offer but he is our portion he's the one
[1:43:48] that gives he's the one that sets a time
[1:43:49] he's the one that sets the trials to
[1:43:51] bring it out he's the one that puts us
[1:43:53] in a place where we've got to reach out
[1:43:54] to him and say lord i need more of you
[1:43:56] i've got to be able to surrender what
[1:43:58] i've got a little more to you amen that
[1:43:59] greatest blessing is when we say lord
[1:44:01] i'm inviting you into my situation amen
[1:44:04] i am not able to handle what i'm going
[1:44:06] through i have no answer for it but your
[1:44:09] word has an answer for it and because
[1:44:11] your word has an answer i'm asking you
[1:44:12] to put that word inside of me in a way
[1:44:14] that i've never had it before amen to
[1:44:16] lift my faith to a higher plane and then
[1:44:18] to stabilize the boat amen panic has no
[1:44:22] place in these decisions and then fear
[1:44:24] has no place in these these these
[1:44:26] decisions
[1:44:27] what is it desperation to get to him not
[1:44:29] desperation to go against the word amen
[1:44:31] that desperation should never take us
[1:44:33] out of that perfect pattern it should
[1:44:35] drive us to him and say let the pattern
[1:44:36] be manifested in my life amen
[1:44:39] amen i want to finish with a promise
[1:44:41] before we close the service here tonight
[1:44:43] it's in second corinthians 9 it says
[1:44:46] and god is able to make all grace abound
[1:44:49] towards you
[1:44:51] that ye
[1:44:52] always having all sufficiency
[1:44:56] in all things
[1:45:00] let's read that again always
[1:45:03] so there's no time where we don't
[1:45:06] having all sufficiency so there is never
[1:45:09] a time where he doesn't have the
[1:45:10] provision that we need in all things
[1:45:13] all in all in all what is escape from
[1:45:16] that what can we say that doesn't apply
[1:45:18] to this scripture amen all sufficiency
[1:45:20] in all things that in those things we
[1:45:23] may abound to every good work
[1:45:25] as it is written he had dispersed abroad
[1:45:28] he hath given to the poor and his
[1:45:30] righteousness remaineth forever now
[1:45:33] catch this verse 10 he says now he that
[1:45:35] ministers seed to the sower both
[1:45:38] minister bread for your food and
[1:45:41] multiply your seeds sown and increase
[1:45:43] the fruits of your righteousness what
[1:45:45] he's saying is that what you have is
[1:45:47] because god gave it to you in the first
[1:45:48] place you took it you sowed it and in
[1:45:52] that he is multiplying it and providing
[1:45:53] for you what you have need of in your
[1:45:55] day-to-day life
[1:45:56] amen the one that gives you the seed
[1:45:58] will make sure that that seed multiplies
[1:46:00] when you plant it
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:02] he said being enriched in everything to
[1:46:06] all bountifulness
[1:46:08] it doesn't matter if it's a need of this
[1:46:10] life it doesn't matter if it's a
[1:46:11] spiritual need a relational need a
[1:46:13] marital need a physical need an
[1:46:15] emotional need an intellectual need
[1:46:17] a career change whatever it might be
[1:46:20] he says being enriched in everything to
[1:46:23] all bountifulness
[1:46:25] but you've got to see bountifulness
[1:46:26] through his eyes not through the world's
[1:46:28] eyes amen because he's still doing a
[1:46:30] work in us right he's trying to bring us
[1:46:31] into that perfect image and that's the
[1:46:33] bountifulness that he's most engaged in
[1:46:35] i mean that's what he's most worried
[1:46:36] about but if we're working into that he
[1:46:39] has no problem blessing us with the
[1:46:40] things of this world because it's not
[1:46:42] holding us back it's not what's defining
[1:46:44] our life it's not what's defining our
[1:46:46] our time and our energy and our efforts
[1:46:48] amen and he's willing to give us what we
[1:46:50] have our need of in our life every
[1:46:51] single day
[1:46:52] if we can only step into what he's he's
[1:46:54] showing us amen
[1:46:56] he says being enriched in everything to
[1:46:58] all bountifulness which causeth through
[1:47:01] us
[1:47:01] thanksgiving to god
[1:47:04] that in all of it we'll be able to say
[1:47:06] thank you lord thank you lord for the
[1:47:08] trial thank you lord for the need thank
[1:47:10] you lord for the difficulty amen how do
[1:47:13] we know he's god if he never shows
[1:47:15] himself god if we are in such ease of
[1:47:17] life and things are going so great that
[1:47:19] we never get to see god's supernatural
[1:47:22] amen we want a supernatural god and yet
[1:47:24] when the time comes to be supernatural
[1:47:26] what do we do we go back to colonel
[1:47:28] right that's not the way to experience
[1:47:30] god the way to experience god is say
[1:47:31] lord you promise supernatural answers
[1:47:33] we're looking for supernatural answers
[1:47:35] and i'm going to be patients i'm going
[1:47:36] to have that constancy i'm going to have
[1:47:38] that stability i'm going to have that
[1:47:39] faith to wait for you to come on the
[1:47:41] scene amen
[1:47:42] amen brothers god has promised us the
[1:47:44] skills the attributes the drive the
[1:47:47] commitment and the focus to provide for
[1:47:49] our households
[1:47:50] and if we don't have it he's promised to
[1:47:52] give it to us if we ask him
[1:47:54] right
[1:47:55] and that doesn't mean it's easy
[1:47:57] doesn't mean that it's going to be a
[1:47:58] walk in the park and you're going to
[1:47:59] pray for it one day and wake up the next
[1:48:01] and it's there but if we will submit
[1:48:03] ourselves to him to do the change amen
[1:48:05] look for god to move in and change us
[1:48:08] and grow us and mature us then he'll do
[1:48:10] it amen and then we can stay inside the
[1:48:12] word pattern and he can bless us in a
[1:48:14] way that we could never be blessed
[1:48:15] outside of it amen
[1:48:17] but when we lack and we will every one
[1:48:19] of us we will and we do at some point
[1:48:21] amen when we can't seem to get there
[1:48:23] what is our solution going to be
[1:48:25] is our solution going to be well
[1:48:27] desperate situations require desperate
[1:48:29] measures or is it going to be desperate
[1:48:31] situations require supernatural god amen
[1:48:34] is that what we're going to do are we
[1:48:35] going to go and ask of him so that he
[1:48:36] can give us liberally or are we going to
[1:48:38] say let's resolve it our own way and
[1:48:40] that's the simplest way it's the
[1:48:41] simplest may but the price is going to
[1:48:43] have to be paid amen
[1:48:44] we know our wives are more than willing
[1:48:46] to help i believe that with all my heart
[1:48:47] i got a wife that's that's easily a
[1:48:49] harder worker as i am maybe harder and
[1:48:51] then she's got a work ethic that is
[1:48:53] unparalleled i believe amen
[1:48:55] but i want that to be the last resource
[1:48:57] the last resort
[1:48:59] rather than the first amen amen let it
[1:49:01] be the work done in me let i let me take
[1:49:03] the burden let me be the one that steps
[1:49:06] into that role in a in a greater way in
[1:49:08] a more more uh committed way rather than
[1:49:11] have her step into it amen
[1:49:13] let's stand together if we would
[1:49:15] we're talking about doing what the
[1:49:16] harder work and inviting god into the
[1:49:18] situation amen amen
[1:49:23] now by god's grace that's
[1:49:26] it's going to be it for the brothers so
[1:49:28] sisters you have a couple weeks to
[1:49:30] psych yourself up and
[1:49:32] enjoy the break
[1:49:34] brothers don't get comfortable because
[1:49:36] we are the bride of christ and as we're
[1:49:38] preaching to the sisters then what
[1:49:39] applies to them applies to us
[1:49:41] in our walk with god amen and i
[1:49:42] guarantee you it will be a great
[1:49:44] challenge to all of us
[1:49:45] as we go through today man pray for me
[1:49:47] as i'm going through
[1:49:48] like i said i i don't want to preach
[1:49:50] opinions i want to stick it to the word
[1:49:52] and by god's grace the things i'm
[1:49:54] studying he shows me in the word so i
[1:49:56] don't have to have an opinion on it
[1:49:58] where there is an opinion i'll take the
[1:49:59] prophets i won't inject mine by god's
[1:50:01] grace but if you feel it is an opinion
[1:50:03] then you pray for me
[1:50:05] and we'll trust god to sort it out amen
[1:50:07] i mean let's bow our heads together
[1:50:09] lord jesus another challenge to
[1:50:12] our lives this morning heavenly father
[1:50:14] to step up to a higher plane

[1:50:34] our sisters lord we know that there's
[1:50:36] going to be pressure to give in
[1:50:39] or that there's going to be pressure to
[1:50:40] compromise or that there's going to be
[1:50:42] pressure to step out of the perfect word
[1:50:44] pattern but lord i pray you give us
[1:50:46] courage
[1:50:47] lord i pray you give us faith i pray you
[1:50:50] give us discernment that when the enemy
[1:50:52] comes in lord we'd be able to hold to
